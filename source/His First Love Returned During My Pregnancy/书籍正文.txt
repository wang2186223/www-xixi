###Chapter 1: An Unexpected Night

"Evelyn..."

His voice melted like chocolate, warm enough to make her shiver.

After three years of marriage, Evelyn Carter still found Alexander Hamilton a completely different man between day and night.

By daylight, Dr. Hamilton was the picture of refinement—polite, measured in speech, every word perfectly calibrated. But when night fell, those eyes behind gold-rimmed glasses turned dangerously intense.

"No more..." She curled into the sheets, her voice trembling. "I have rounds tomorrow..."

Alexander chuckled, brushing damp strands from her forehead with slender fingers. "One last time."

By the time it ended, Evelyn's fingertips were trembling.

Drowsy, she closed her eyes—only to feel warm hands settle on her waist.

"Don't—"

"Relax," his voice softened back to its daytime gentleness. "Just a massage."

Those surgeon's fingers found her sore muscles with precision, pressure perfectly controlled. A soft sigh escaped her as tension unwound from her body.

"When did you learn this?"

"Took a course in therapeutic massage during med school." Amusement colored his tone. "Seems I haven't forgotten."

Evelyn turned, studying her husband in the moonlight.

At thirty, Alexander Hamilton had everything to envy—an illustrious family, surgical brilliance, and the face that made nurses blush behind clipboards.

She'd never imagined marrying someone like him during their first blind date.

"Next weekend's your birthday," she murmured. "I have a gift for you."

Alexander opened his mouth—then froze as his phone vibrated.

One glance at the screen, and his expression shattered.

"What's wrong?"

"Emergency at the hospital." He dressed with uncharacteristic haste, his tie askew.

"Should I come?"

"No." Already at the door. "Rest."

The slam of the door echoed.

Evelyn stared at the still-vibrating handle, unease coiling in her chest. Alexander never lost composure like this.

Her phone rang.

"Dr. Carter! Pregnant patient hemorrhaging—OR now!"

Fifteen minutes later, Evelyn burst into the ER.

Her assistant Olivia Lightfoot thrust scrubs at her. "Six months pregnant, placental abruption from car crash, already in shock."

Six hours later, she emerged from surgery, legs barely functional.

"Dr. Carter!" Olivia caught her elbow, whispering, "You're pregnant too—you shouldn't have—"

Evelyn's hand drifted to her abdomen. This secret was meant for Alexander's birthday.

"The family's been demanding entry," Olivia frowned.

"I'll explain."

Pushing through the OR doors, Evelyn froze.

The disheveled man with bloodshot eyes—still in the same rumpled suit—was the husband who'd rushed out an hour ago.

"Doctor! How's my wife?"

Their eyes met. The air turned to ice.

"...Evelyn?"

Alexander's face went deathly pale.
###Chapter 2: When Intuition Becomes a Curse

"Dr. Carter, do you know the patient's family?"

Olivia Lightfoot's voice reached Evelyn Carter's ears, but her gaze remained locked on the painfully familiar face before her.

Alexander Hamilton's brows were furrowed, his eyes betraying a panic he couldn't conceal.

"Are you her..." Evelyn's voice tightened as she glanced toward the operating room. "Husband?"

"Yes," Olivia chimed in. "He signed the consent forms."

Evelyn's fingers dug into her palms unconsciously.

Alexander swallowed hard. "Evelyn, let me explain."

"The surgery was successful." Her voice sounded mechanical. "Mother and baby are both stable. They'll be discharged in a few days."

The tension in his shoulders visibly eased. "Thank you."

"Just doing my job."

——

The office door creaked open as Evelyn stared blankly at her water glass.

"It's me."

Alexander stood in the doorway, his dress shirt stained with dried blood, sleeves damp at the cuffs.

"She's asleep," he offered.

Evelyn sank into her chair, fingertips cold. "The baby..."

"Not mine." The words came too quickly.

She exhaled sharply, collapsing against the backrest.

"There was an accident. It was an emergency." His voice cracked. "They needed a relative's signature, so I..."

"I understand."

The explanation made perfect sense. Yet something felt off.

——

The Cayenne idled outside the hospital entrance, the acrid smell of cigarettes making her nose wrinkle.

A dozen crushed butts littered the pavement.

"Work stress," he said preemptively, opening the passenger door.

The SUV lurched forward abruptly, nearly hitting a pedestrian.

"Watch out!"

Amid angry shouts, Alexander's face went pale.

"Sorry," he muttered as they drove. "It's been... a lot lately."

Evelyn kept her eyes on the passing buildings. "Drive safely."

"What if she's alone at the hospital?" he suddenly asked.

"There are nurses."

"But if no family comes..."

She turned to study his profile. "Why do you care so much?"

Silence swallowed the car whole.

——

Dawn was breaking when they reached home.

"I'm heading to the office." He didn't turn off the engine.

Evelyn nodded, not questioning the lie.

Some truths were better left unknown.

——

Saturday morning found her absently tracing the pregnancy test in her wallet when the phone screamed to life.

"Evelyn!" Vivian Dempsey's voice was razor-sharp. "Your husband just brought some pregnant woman into your house!"
###Chapter 3 Childhood Sweetheart

Expected?

Perhaps.

Though their marriage wasn’t built on love, three years of living together had convinced her she knew Alexander Hamilton inside out.

Unlike those arrogant tycoons, he was always gentle and courteous. His refined demeanor and considerate nature made him a rare gentleman.

Any woman who could rattle him must be extraordinary.

She had braced herself for a heartbreaking reunion of old flames. But reality surprised her.

When she stepped into the family home, the pregnant woman was chatting warmly with Margaret Hamilton. Alexander sat alone nearby, rising the moment she entered and naturally taking her bag. "Let me put this away for you."

"Evelyn’s back," Margaret greeted warmly. "Come sit."

She called her "Mom," then turned to the pregnant woman. "And this is…?"

"This is Annabelle," Margaret introduced. "The Taylors’ daughter from next door. She just returned from abroad. Annabelle, this is Alexander’s wife."

The pregnant woman slowly stood, supporting her rounded belly. "Hello, I’m Annabelle Taylor."

She paused. "Your name is…"

"What a coincidence—same pronunciation, different characters." The woman smiled. "Mine is ‘Annabelle,’ like the flower. Yours is ‘Evelyn,’ like the wood."

Margaret added with a laugh, "Alexander has a connection with that name. One’s his childhood sweetheart, the other his wife."

"Speaking of which," Annabelle suddenly said, "Dr. Carter was the one who performed my surgery."

Margaret looked at her in surprise. "Really?"

"Yes." Annabelle extended a hand. "Thanks to her, my baby and I are both safe."

She shook the offered hand firmly. "Just doing my job. Your case wasn’t complicated—just rest well post-op."

At dinner, Margaret and Annabelle reminisced. The two families had been neighbors for decades. Alexander and Annabelle were born the same year and attended the same classes from elementary through high school.

"Those two were inseparable," Margaret said, giving her a meaningful glance. "I even thought they were dating, but it turned out to be a misunderstanding."

Annabelle chimed in playfully, "He was always delivering my love letters to my crushes."

"Too familiar to date." Annabelle’s joke drew laughter around the table.

She understood Margaret’s good intentions. This marriage was flawless—her husband attentive, her mother-in-law open-minded, never pressuring them about children. Perfect, except for the lack of love.

But the coincidence of "Annabelle" and "Evelyn" stuck in her throat like a fishbone.

Late that night, Alexander towel-dried her damp hair. "I didn’t get to explain at the hospital. Annabelle flew back from abroad for my birthday but got into a car accident on the way."

So the night of her birthday, his abrupt departure had been to pick Annabelle up.

"We’re best friends." He emphasized the last two words.

"Flying internationally at six months pregnant," she murmured. "That’s certainly not an ordinary friendship."

His hands stilled briefly. "...Yeah."

"By the way," he changed the subject, "you said you had a birthday gift for me?"
###Chapter 4: The Best Friend's Test

Evelyn's nails dug deep into her palms. The medical report hidden in her wallet seemed to burn against her skin.

"No gift prepared?" Alexander chuckled, pinching her cheek. "Having my Dr. Carter spare time for dinner is the best birthday present."

"I took next week off," Evelyn blurted.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Isn't your research paper due soon?"

"I'll manage." She pressed her lips together. "We skipped our honeymoon. This will make up for it."

His eyes lit up. "Perfect timing—my project wraps up next week."

"Won't it interfere with work?"

"I'll adjust my schedule." He suddenly remembered something. "You're off tomorrow, right? High school reunion. Come with me."

Three years married, and this was his first invitation to meet his friends. Thinking of her canceled birthday plans, Evelyn nodded quietly.

......

After a 36-hour hospital shift, Evelyn slept like the dead.

She woke to an empty bed.

As a doctor, she was used to this rhythm. She and Alexander lived like parallel lines—sharing a bed yet rarely intersecting.

"Alexander's waiting outside," called Margaret from downstairs.

Evelyn rushed out to find a white Cayenne idling at the curb. She opened the passenger door—and froze.

Red-rimmed eyes met hers.

"Dr. Carter?" Annabelle stroked her rounded belly, the crimson dress accentuating her porcelain skin.

Evelyn suddenly remembered—Alexander and Annabelle had been classmates for twelve years. She just never expected this "childhood friend" to be sitting in her husband's front seat.

"I get carsick," Annabelle said, tossing her hair. The SUV's height gave her a condescending vantage. "I'll vomit in the back."

Evelyn noted her full makeup and the tear tracks still glistening at her temples.

"Sorry, Dr. Carter—you'll have to sit behind me." Annabelle caressed her stomach. "In my condition..."

"How long?"

"Until the baby comes." Annabelle smiled. "My parents are at the care facility. Alexander's kind enough to help. Oh, and your downtown apartment is closer to the hospital. I'll be moving in."

This wasn't a request—it was a decree.

Evelyn turned to the driver. "Your idea?"

Alexander looked uncomfortable. "It is more convenient for the hospital..."

"So it's decided?"

"Annabelle's my closest friend..."

Closest friend? Evelyn scoffed inwardly. A three-year silence, then she reappears pregnant—and her husband surrenders the front seat without a fight.

"Get in," Alexander urged, his eyes avoiding the rearview mirror.

......

The lounge bar was dimly lit. Throughout the drive, Annabelle had been touching up her makeup.

"Pretty?" She turned to Alexander.

"Beautiful."

"Pregnant women can't even wear lipstick." She pouted, then extended a hand. "Where's my phone?"

Alexander instinctively pulled it from his pocket. "Still forgetting everything."

"You kept the same passcode!" Annabelle winked.

Evelyn's grip tightened on her purse. This "best friend" who supposedly hadn't spoken to him in three years remembered his phone password perfectly.

"Look out—!"

Screeching brakes filled the air as a truck barreled toward them. Alexander swerved violently—just as Annabelle threw herself into his arms.
###Chapter 5: The Title Dispute

The tires screeched against the pavement.

Evelyn Carter lurched forward, only to be jerked back by her seatbelt. Heart pounding, she looked up to see an electric bike swerving dangerously close to their car.

"Focus on the road," she said, her voice trembling slightly.

Alexander Hamilton's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. His Adam's apple bobbed as he muttered, "Sorry."

From the backseat, Annabelle Taylor let out a derisive snort and snapped her compact shut. "Give me your phone."

"The passcode is ry2—"

"Alexander!" Annabelle's voice sharpened as she snatched the phone from his hand. "Since when do you share passwords with outsiders?"

The air in the car turned icy.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, fingers tightening unconsciously over her knees.

"Don't take it personally, Dr. Carter," Annabelle said with a saccharine smile. "Mood swings are common during pregnancy. Besides, phone privacy is protected by law. I'm just asserting my rights."

"Understood." Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "But you can call me Mrs. Hamilton now."

Annabelle's smile twitched. "Dr. Carter sounds so much younger. Mrs. Hamilton makes you sound middle-aged—"

"I am Mrs. Hamilton."

Their stares locked in a silent battle.

"Alexander," Annabelle suddenly turned to the driver's seat, "we'll be late if you don't hurry."

——

Neon lights flickered outside the lounge bar.

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the car, her phone rang. Alexander frowned. "The hospital again?"

"Probably." She glanced at the caller ID. "Go ahead without me."

"Let me drive you—"

"Alexander!" Annabelle waved from a distance. "Richard's waiting!"

Olivia Lightfoot's excited voice came through the phone. "Dr. Carter! There's an overseas training opportunity next month—"

"I'm not going." Evelyn's hand instinctively rested on her abdomen. "It's better for the baby to be born here."

By the time she hung up, the parking lot was empty.

Deafening music pulsed through the entrance.

Evelyn stood at the doorway, her gaze cutting through the crowd to land on that familiar, upright figure. Alexander stood in the corner, his gold-rimmed glasses reflecting cold light, starkly out of place amid the chaos.

"...Never thought Alexander Hamilton would end up marrying Annabelle."

"Heard he completely changed his temper just to chase her..."

"Used to be the school's biggest troublemaker. Now he acts all refined..."

Clatter.

Her phone slipped from her fingers.

A man in a blue suit bent to pick it up. "You okay, classmate?"

"Thanks." She forced a smile. "I'm not your classmate."

"Oh, sorry. We booked this place for a private event—"

"I'm here for Alexander Hamilton."

The man's expression shifted. "You're his...?"
###Chapter 6: The Line Between Men and Women

"I'm his wife."

The two men before her froze, their eyes scanning her up and down. "You are...?"

"Evelyn Carter. Evelyn, like the scent of sandalwood."

The air turned thick with tension.

A faint smile touched her lips. "Are spouses not allowed at tonight's gathering?"

"Oh, no, of course they are."

"Then I'll head in."

The lounge bar buzzed with noise. Alexander Hamilton stood at the center of the crowd, fielding endless greetings. She chose a secluded booth and settled in quietly.

Amid the music, Alexander undid his suit buttons and draped the jacket over his arm. A slender hand suddenly reached out. "Let me take that for you."

He sidestepped. "No need."

Annabelle Taylor chuckled. "They won't go easy on you tonight. Trust me."

After a pause, he relented and let go.

The expensive suit jacket crumpled in her grip. Suddenly, she tugged at his sleeve. Alexander bent down obligingly as she whispered in his ear. A flicker of amusement crossed his eyes before he gave a slight nod.

"What secrets are you two sharing?"

Annabelle grinned openly. "Listen up, everyone! If anyone dares to get Alexander drunk, you'll answer to me!"

"Oho, Annie's protective now?"

A blush crept up her cheeks. "Don't be ridiculous!"

Alexander frowned. "Watch your words. Annabelle is pregnant."

The group fell silent. Someone quickly smoothed things over. "Alex and Annie have a friendship forged in steel."

"Exactly! Even if they booked a hotel room, they'd just game all night. Cut the nonsense."

In the commotion, Annabelle slipped a wine dispenser into Alexander's hand—its contents already swapped for water. He took it without missing a beat, filling his glass. "A toast to everyone."

"To youth!"

The reunion reached its nostalgic peak. As the others grew increasingly drunk, Alexander remained sharp. He loosened his collar and rolled up his sleeves, the deep blue armbands accentuating his toned arms. Behind his gold-rimmed glasses, his gaze was razor-sharp.

Abruptly, his expression darkened. He strode toward a male classmate and kicked his chair. "Put that out."

The man hastily stubbed out his cigarette. "Sorry, Alex. I forgot."

"Don't forget again."

"Right, right."

"First time seeing him like this?"

Evelyn looked up. A man with black-framed glasses and a scholarly air had taken the seat opposite her unnoticed.

"And you are?"

"Richard Jackson."

Recognition dawned. "Big Richard?"

He smiled faintly. "You've heard of me?"

"Just now, yes." She studied him. "Why aren't you drinking?"

Richard shook his head. "Alexander's here."

"So?"

"In college, Annabelle had a thing for me."

Everything clicked. This was the man her mother-in-law had mentioned.

"You're Alexander's wife?"

"Yes."

"He's lucky." Richard swirled his drink. "Back in school, he was untouchable. Every guy looked up to him."

"Is that so?"

"Girls back then loved the tough types." He paused. "Except Annabelle."

"She liked you."

"Liked me?" He laughed bitterly. "Doubtful."

"What do you mean?"

As the alcohol took hold, he stared into his glass. "Mrs. Hamilton, tell me—do you really think men and women can be just friends?"
###Chapter 7: Drawing the Line

The summer night breeze carried the sharp scent of alcohol.

Evelyn noticed Alexander's flushed ears and realized he'd had too much to drink. The decanter he always carried was nowhere to be seen—its supply of water must have run out long ago.

"Alex, one more round!"

"Yeah, we're not leaving until you're wasted!"

A group of drunken men crowded around Alexander, shoving glasses into his hands. Annabelle stood nearby, her pregnant belly prominent, weakly protesting, "Stop drinking," but her voice was lost in the noise.

Evelyn stood. "I'll check on him."

Richard gave her a knowing look but said nothing.

As she approached, she saw Alexander being forced to accept a glass of liquor. His brow furrowed, but he took it anyway.

"Enough." Evelyn snatched the glass from his hand.

"Hey, who's this?" A drunk squinted at her. "Since when do waitresses tell Alex what to do?"

The man reached for her arm. Alexander suddenly blocked him, pulling Evelyn behind him.

"Don't touch her."

"Alex, these gold-diggers are all the same—"

"She's my wife."

The air turned icy. The drunk sobered instantly, his gaze darting between Evelyn and Annabelle.

"But... Annabelle—"

All eyes shifted to Annabelle, standing in the corner. She clutched Alexander's jacket tightly, forcing a smile. "We're just friends."

The smile looked more like a grimace.

Alexander's gaze cleared slightly. "That's enough for tonight. Evelyn, let's go home."

Annabelle stepped forward. "I'll come too."

Evelyn held out her hand. "Give me the jacket."

"No need." Annabelle hugged it closer. "I've got it."

The three left the room in tense silence, leaving the guests bewildered.

"What just happened?"

Richard downed his drink, watching Annabelle leave. "If she knew this would happen, why did she start it?"

The night breeze was chilly. Evelyn shivered, drawing warmth from Alexander's body.

"Call a driver," Alexander said.

Annabelle immediately pulled out her phone.

"I'll drive," Evelyn said.

Alexander blinked in surprise. "You can drive?"

"I can. Just never had the chance." For three years, no matter how late, he had always been the one to drive her.

"Where are the keys?"

"In my pocket."

Annabelle rifled through the jacket. "They're not here."

Alexander leaned heavily on Evelyn, his words slurring. "Pants pocket."

"I'll get them!" Annabelle moved forward, reaching for his waistband.

Evelyn blocked her. "Miss Taylor, that's hardly appropriate."
###Chapter 8: Undercurrents of Conflict

Annabelle froze for half a second before lifting her chin. "Alexander and I have known each other for over twenty years. Everyone knows we're just close friends. Are you really that insecure, Dr. Carter? Should men and women never be friends at all?"

Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "Friendship between genders is fine. But you're both married now. Boundaries matter."

Annabelle scoffed. "Weren't you the one who always says 'doctors have no gender'? Last week when that male anesthesiologist rushed into your OR, why didn't you fuss about propriety then?"

"That was an emergency!"

"How urgent could it be?" Annabelle arched a brow. "More important than two decades of friendship?"

Evelyn's fists clenched. "You were hemorrhaging. Any longer and we would've lost the baby."

"Convenient," Annabelle sneered. "You're the doctor—you can say whatever you want."

"Enough!" Alexander Hamilton staggered to his feet, the alcohol making him unsteady. He shoved his keys into Evelyn's hand, voice hoarse. "She's hormonal. Don't take it personally."

Evelyn didn't accept them, staring into his eyes instead. "Are you really just friends?"

His Adam's apple bobbed before he looked away. "Let's go home."

As Evelyn helped him into the car, she noticed Annabelle sliding into the backseat, carefully draping a jacket over his shoulders.

"I thought you got carsick, Miss Taylor. The front would be more comfortable."

Annabelle buckled her seatbelt with a serene smile. "I'm fine today. It's no trouble."

Headlights cut through the night. Evelyn's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

Back at the Hamilton estate, Margaret was already asleep. Evelyn had just guided Alexander up the stairs when Annabelle's voice rang out behind them. "Aren't you taking his jacket?"

"Leave it on the sofa. I'll deal with it tomorrow."

"Don't you have morning rounds?" Annabelle crossed her arms. "What kind of wife neglects her husband's laundry?"

Evelyn turned, voice barely above a whisper. "First, folding clothes takes five minutes. Second, Margaret's asleep. Do you really want to shout the house down?"

"Aunt Margaret wouldn't—"

"Annabelle!" Alexander cut in sharply, massaging his temples. "Just leave the damn jacket. Go to bed."

Her face darkened. "After everything I did for you tonight—covering your drinks, fetching your coat—this is how you treat me?"

"What do you want from me?" His voice was glacial. "Should I prioritize my 'bro' or my wife?"

His grip on Evelyn's wrist as he hauled her upstairs was bruising, like years of suppressed emotions were finally breaking through.

Under the shower's scalding spray, Evelyn watched the red marks on her skin fade. She changed into long-sleeved pajamas only to find Alexander missing from their bedroom.

The man on the balcony exhaled cigarette smoke, his tailored suit clashing with the haze around him. Hearing her approach, he hastily stubbed out the cigarette but found no ashtray.

"I didn't know you smoked."

"Quit years ago." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Bad for your health."

The excuse sounded rehearsed. When he passed her, the scent of tobacco mixed with alcohol was overwhelming.

His phone lit up on the coffee table.

[Annabelle: Your wife's got a sharp tongue. Even I couldn't outtalk her.]

[Annabelle: Can't sleep. Watch the stars with me like we used to?]

[Annabelle: Last chance to reply before I cut you off for good.]

The screen's glow reflected in Evelyn's eyes—cold as embers.
###Chapter 9: Ink-Stained Night

The phone screen glowed in the darkness, its incessant buzzing like a death knell.

Alexander Hamilton's phone lay unlocked on the nightstand. Evelyn Carter stared at the flashing screen displaying the name "Annabelle Taylor."

She turned away, pulling the covers over her head.

But the phone refused to relent, vibrating without pause. Finally, Evelyn snatched it up and typed a reply: He's in the shower. This is Evelyn.

Silence fell instantly.

The sound of running water stopped. Alexander emerged from the bathroom, towel-drying his hair, and found Evelyn lying with her back to him, breathing evenly.

He picked up the phone with careful fingers, his brow furrowing. After a moment, he slid open the balcony door and lit a cigarette.

Evelyn opened her eyes.

The scent of tobacco drifted in, mingling with the cool night air. This was the third time she'd caught the smell on him since Annabelle returned.

"...It's not what you think," Alexander's hushed voice carried from the balcony. "Evelyn isn't that kind of person."

Silence.

"Fine. I'll be right down."

The glass door slid open quietly. Alexander froze when he saw Evelyn sitting up in bed.

"Work emergency?" she asked.

"Yeah. A last-minute project." He avoided her gaze. "Go back to sleep."

As she watched him hastily change clothes, Evelyn spoke again. "Annabelle called."

His hands stilled on his tie.

"She sounded urgent," Evelyn said softly. "I promised I'd tell you."

"...Right."

"Aren't you going to call her back?"

Alexander turned with that familiar gentle smile she knew so well. "You look pale. Have you been overworking? I'll give you a massage later."

He leaned down to tuck her in, pressing a kiss to her forehead.

The engine of his white Cayenne roared to life below. Evelyn stood by the window, watching its taillights vanish into the night.

"You just let him go?!" Vivian Dempsey's shriek blasted through the phone. "He runs off to see his ex in the middle of the night, and you cover for him?!"

Evelyn gazed at the starless sky. "He said it was work."

"Bullshit! What company holds meetings at 2 AM? Evelyn, wake up! They're clearly rekindling their old flame!"

A lighter clicked on the other end. Vivian took a furious drag. "That Annabelle—her name's practically identical to yours. Doesn't that strike you as suspicious?"

Of course it did.

She should've realized when Richard asked if she believed in platonic friendships between men and women. The way Alexander looked at Annabelle wasn't how one looked at a friend.

It was twenty years of repressed longing.

"Vivian," Evelyn's voice trembled, "why do you think he chose me?"

A beat of silence.

"Are you stupid?!" Vivian exploded. "Because your goddamn name is Evelyn! The man's obsessed with some twisted replacement fantasy!"

The night breeze lifted the curtains. Evelyn hugged herself.

During those intimate nights, when he whispered "Annabelle" against her skin—who had he really been calling for?

"Divorce him," Vivian said. "Before there's a child—"

Evelyn cut her off. "I'm pregnant."

Glass shattered on the other end of the line.
###Chapter 10: Shattered Reflections

Vivian Dempsey's eyes widened in shock. "You're pregnant?!"

"Just confirmed. Four weeks."

"..."

Evelyn Carter rested a hand on her still-flat abdomen. "I wanted to surprise him on his birthday."

Vivian bit her lip. "But Annabelle is also pregnant now. Surely Alexander wouldn't—"

"What do you think he'll choose?"

The examination room fell silent.

Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating Evelyn's pale face. Vivian's eyes reddened as she noticed her best friend's trembling fingers.

"Give him a chance. For the baby's sake."

The hospital corridor was eerily quiet at dawn.

Evelyn finished her rounds alone, scribbling notes in a chart. Olivia Lightfoot trailed behind with a clipboard, hesitating before speaking.

"Dr. Carter, Mr. Hamilton isn't escorting you today?"

Her fountain pen paused mid-sentence.

"He's busy at work."

As she pushed open her office door, her phone screen lit up.

Alexander's voice came through the receiver. "Evelyn, I—"

"I'm working."

"I'll pick you up at five."

After hanging up, Evelyn stared blankly out the window. Her reflection showed fingers absently tracing her stomach.

Olivia suddenly appeared beside her, whispering conspiratorially. "Dr. Carter, there's a surprise downstairs!"

Outside the hospital entrance, Alexander stood holding an enormous bouquet of red roses. Sunlight glinted off the sapphire cufflinks at his wrists. Behind gold-rimmed glasses, his gaze was tender.

"For the hardest-working Dr. Carter."

The heavy roses nearly slipped from Evelyn's grasp. Their heady fragrance made her eyes sting.

"Thank you."

Alexander smiled as he took back the flowers and opened the car door. Evelyn's eyes darted to the empty backseat.

"Looking for something?"

"Nothing."

As they merged into traffic, Evelyn secretly photographed the roses in her lap. Her social media exploded with notifications—Vivian's profile picture stood out among the likes.

"See? He chose you."

Evelyn traced her phone screen without replying. In the rearview mirror, Alexander's sharp profile reminded her of how his Adam's apple had bobbed during last night's phone call.

Had he really chosen?

At a red light, Alexander turned. "What would you like for dinner?"

Watching traffic blur past, Evelyn murmured, "Let's eat at home."

She missed how his fingers froze on the wheel. She didn't notice the new notification flashing on his locked screen—where "Annabelle" burned like a brand.
###Chapter 11: The Intruder

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile.

"But if you two have been... intimate lately, you should be careful. The baby is still so small." Vivian's voice carried a hint of shyness. "You're the professional here. You know better than I do."

"Mm. I know."

Alexander kept one hand on the steering wheel and glanced at her. "Who has you smiling like that?"

"Vivian."

"That's an unusual name. Did her parents choose it?"

Evelyn chuckled. "She changed it herself. The day she turned eighteen, she rushed to the police station—couldn’t wait a single day."

"Why?"

"Some guy broke her heart in high school. She swore off love forever. Hence, 'Vivian'—as in, 'ending love.'"

Alexander shook his head. "Teenage heartbreak. No need to be so dramatic."

"What about you?" Evelyn suddenly asked. "Do you have an unforgettable first love?"

His grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly. "...Too long ago. I barely remember."

"Oh."

"And you?" he countered. "Ever liked someone before?"

"I did," Evelyn said, watching the scenery blur past the window. "But I was very young. Maybe four or five."

"That early?"

"What do kids know? I just thought they were special. Seems silly now."

Alexander laughed softly. "Five or six is when gender awareness starts. It’s normal."

Evelyn raised a brow. "Sounds like you speak from experience?"

He reached over to brush aside a low-hanging branch. "Careful. Don’t let it scratch your eyes."

The apartment was only a ten-minute drive from the hospital.

The complex wasn’t high-end, but Alexander had chosen it for Evelyn’s convenience. To him, an extra twenty minutes of driving each day meant nothing.

Beep— The fingerprint lock clicked open.

"Surprise! Welcome home!"

Evelyn nearly dropped the bouquet in her arms. That voice—

She bent to set the flowers down, only to freeze at the sight before her.

Annabelle stood there in Evelyn’s pink slippers, wearing a silk nightgown, her face bare of makeup.

Their carefully decorated home had been completely transformed.

The floral curtains Evelyn loved had been yanked down and crumpled in a corner. The plush toys neatly arranged on the sofa were gone. The lace tablecloth had vanished, leaving the glass dining table bare—except for the toys now haphazardly taped to its edges.

Alexander’s expression darkened. "Annabelle. What are you doing?"

"Redecorating for you," Annabelle said sweetly. "Dr. Carter is so busy. She must not have time for housekeeping."

"You could’ve at least asked us first!"

"Ask what?" She tilted her head. "I’ve always handled your living arrangements, haven’t I?"

Evelyn clenched her fists, her voice trembling. "Miss Taylor, this is my home with Alexander."

"Oh?" Annabelle stroked her rounded belly. "Is your name on the deed?"

"..."

"You couldn’t afford this neighborhood on your salary, could you? Since Alexander paid for it, the right to decide is his." She lifted her chin proudly. "And his affairs have always been my call."

Alexander pulled Evelyn close, his voice icy. "Annabelle, that was then. This is our marital home now. Evelyn is the lady of this house."

"Marital home?" Annabelle blinked. "Pre-marital asset, more like. In a divorce, she wouldn’t get a cent. But as your best friend, I can visit whenever I please."

"Enough!" Alexander snapped.

Annabelle’s eyes instantly welled up. "Alexander, you’re yelling at me for her? You never treated me like this before!"

"I didn’t— You could at least show Evelyn some respect."

"You yelled at me!" Annabelle suddenly clutched her stomach. "Ah— It hurts..."

Alexander rushed to steady her. "What’s wrong? Sit down!"

She slumped weakly onto the sofa, tears glistening. "If anything happens to the baby..."

"Let Evelyn check you," Alexander turned to his wife, his tone pleading. "She’s a professional—"

"I don’t want her!" Annabelle turned away. "After that male anesthesiologist incident? I don’t trust her."

Evelyn smirked coldly. "This is my personal time. I’m not on duty."

"Evelyn..." Alexander lowered his voice. "Pregnant women are emotional. Be understanding—"

"Fine." Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Specialist consultation fee: 15 dollars. Scan to pay."

Annabelle let out a derisive laugh. "Keeping score between husband and wife? How thrifty of you, Doctor."

"Exactly," Evelyn met her gaze squarely. "I’m saving for my own place. Then no one can barge in and rearrange my home without permission."
###Chapter 12: She Couldn't Stay Another Minute

"Dr. Carter, do I need to educate you on marital property laws?" Annabelle lounged on the sofa, fingertips lightly tapping her glass. "Any property acquired during marriage is considered joint assets, even if purchased with personal funds."

"So Alexander gets half ownership, and that gives you the right to destroy my things?"

Annabelle smirked. "If you'd bought it before marriage, it would've been yours alone. Same applies after divorce."

"Are you implying something, Miss Taylor?"

"Don't misunderstand," Annabelle set down her glass. "Just sharing some legal basics."

Evelyn turned to Alexander. "Seems Miss Taylor is in excellent spirits."

"Evelyn..."

"Don't forget to transfer me $15." She headed for the bedroom. "As for the living room, it's your house—your rules."

Alexander caught her arm. "Stop this."

"Oh," Evelyn shook him off, "the curtains and sofa covers were my purchases. I have receipts. Miss Taylor will compensate for damages—I do know basic property laws."

"The roses are by the entryway. Handle them yourself."

The bedroom door slammed shut.

As Alexander knocked outside, she put on headphones and queued a random show.

When the episode ended, she opened the door thirsty—just in time to hear Annabelle's shrill voice: "...When did you become so spineless? Where's the confident Alexander I knew?"

"You think I should fight with her?"

"At least stop groveling! Marriage takes two—why should you always compromise?"

Alexander scoffed. "With your marital expertise, how'd your own marriage turn out?"

Annabelle paled. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Cheated on while pregnant, left with nothing," his voice turned icy. "Did you really fly back just for my birthday?"

Her lips trembled silently.

"Stay out of my marriage."

"I'm trying to help!" Annabelle's voice cracked. "If Dr. Carter can't get along with anyone, shouldn't she reflect?"

"She gets along perfectly with my mother."

"Superficial politeness! How could she compare to my twenty-year bond with Aunt Margaret?"

Alexander stood abruptly. "What more do you want? Midnight stargazing, living in our marital home—still not enough?"

"Fine, I'll leave!" Annabelle grabbed her purse.

"It's the middle of the night—where would you go?"

"Not your concern!" Tears streamed down. "We're done!"

"Enough," Alexander seized her bag. "I can't let a pregnant woman stay alone at a hotel."

Bang!

Evelyn deliberately made noise.

Both turned. Alexander looked guilty; Annabelle's eyes glistened.

She couldn't stay another minute.

"Emergency at the hospital." She grabbed her bag and shoes.

Alexander reached for his keys. "I'll drive you."

"Miss Taylor needs your attention more."

She sped through the neighborhood, his shouts fading behind her.

"Driver, any hotel."

"There's one right—"

"The farther the better."

As the car pulled away, someone chased them in the rearview.

"Miss, that man—"

"Don't stop. Faster."
###Chapter 13: Fate's Cruel Joke

Evelyn Carter had a peculiar trait—no matter how terrible things got, her sleep remained undisturbed.

Those dramatic TV scenes where heartbroken heroines toss and turn all night? They simply didn’t apply to her.

Vivian Dempsey once sighed enviously, "You’re so lucky. If I’d had your ability back then, I wouldn’t have lost sleep before the college entrance exams and ended up at a mediocre university."

In high school, she and Vivian had dominated the top two spots in their grade.

Their scores always left the third-place student far behind.

Everything changed during their final semester.

The boy who’d perpetually ranked third suddenly launched an intense pursuit of Vivian. His love letters were poetic, and his public confession became campus legend.

What seventeen-year-old girl could resist such charm? Within two months, Vivian was swept off her feet.

The teachers turned a blind eye—after all, they were all top students.

But the happiness didn’t last. The boy abruptly broke up with her, as if it had all been premeditated.

Vivian was shattered. Her grades plummeted.

Evelyn juggled comforting her best friend with tutoring her, stretching herself thin.

When exam results came out, Vivian barely scraped into a second-tier university. Evelyn fell out of the top five. And that boy? He secured a spot at Peking University.

Even now, a decade later, Vivian still seethed. "That bastard planned it all! He knew he couldn’t win over an ice queen like you, so he targeted me instead."

Evelyn tried to soften the blow. "Maybe… he just realized you weren’t compatible?"

"You really believe that?"

Seventeen-year-old Evelyn might have.

But now, nearing thirty, staring at the chasm between Peking University and a second-tier college, she couldn’t lie to herself.

In the operating room, Evelyn had just finished her fourth C-section of the day.

Two boys, two girls—an unusually balanced ratio.

Olivia Lightfoot flipped through the charts, impressed. "This kind of gender balance is rare."

Since the three-child policy was introduced, despite strict bans on gender testing, the imbalance in newborn ratios had only worsened.

"I prefer girls," Evelyn said.

Olivia casually asked, "What about your husband? Does he want a boy or a girl?"

"...I haven’t told him yet."

"I thought it was supposed to be a birthday surprise?"

"There was a complication."

Olivia patted her shoulder. "Don’t worry. You’re still early. Plenty of time."

"Yeah."

"By the way, didn’t your husband come to pick you up today? I checked the parking lot earlier—his car wasn’t there."

Evelyn busied herself with organizing instruments. "He’s probably busy at work. Speaking of which, when’s the deadline for that overseas assignment we talked about?"

"End of the month." Olivia hesitated. "Are you seriously considering it? It’s a three-year commitment. You’d have to give birth abroad. Would your husband even agree?"

Evelyn counted the days. Ten left to decide.

"I’ll think about it."

"You start your annual leave tomorrow, right? If you’re applying, you’ll need to submit the form as soon as you get back."

Annual leave.

Evelyn’s hands stilled.

Originally, she’d planned to use it for a belated honeymoon.

Now, she couldn’t even go home. What honeymoon?
###Chapter 14: I Set You Free

At the end of her shift, Evelyn Carter hailed a cab straight to the hotel.

A familiar figure at the entrance made her pause.

Alexander Hamilton leaned against his car door, a cigarette between his fingers. The curling smoke obscured his expression. For once, he wasn’t in a suit—casual wear softened his usual sharp edges.

"You came." He stubbed out the cigarette and approached.

Evelyn glanced at the hotel sign. This place was clear across the city from their apartment.

"How did you find me?"

"Hamilton Group owns shares in this hotel."

Her brow furrowed. She’d never paid attention to his business empire, yet somehow, she still couldn’t escape his reach.

"Where’s Annabelle?"

"At home." Guilt tinged his voice. "She can stay there. I’ll stay here with you."

Evelyn shook her head. "She needs care."

The elevator doors opened. She stepped in quickly. Alexander caught up, holding the door. "I requested your vacation days. Let’s go to Cloud Terrace Resort for a few days. We have a property there."

"I just want rest."

"Your choice. Sightsee or stay in. Whatever you prefer." He hesitated. "I hired a caregiver for her."

Silence filled the elevator.

"Alexander." Evelyn met his gaze. "Do you still want this marriage?"

His expression froze.

"If you can’t let her go, I’ll step aside." Her tone was calm, as if discussing the weather. "We can part amicably."

His Adam’s apple bobbed.

"Annabelle and I… it’s impossible." His voice was barely audible. "Forever impossible."

In the room, Alexander busied himself with boiling water and ordering room service, deliberately avoiding the subject. Adults understood the courtesy of preserving each other’s dignity.

Vivian Dempsey’s call came at the perfect time. "Go! You have to! That’s a luxury resort—free stay, why not?"

Evelyn checked the room rates and gasped.

"Annabelle isn’t going?" Vivian pressed.

Alexander’s assurance echoed in her mind: "She’s pregnant. Not suitable for mountain trips."

But fate loved cruel jokes.

The next morning, they froze at the sight of Annabelle in the parking lot, her baby bump prominent.

"Alexander," she said sweetly, "I’m visiting my parents. It’s on the way."

He frowned. "I’ll call you a cab."

"Is your car full?" Her gaze slid past him to Evelyn. "Dr. Carter wouldn’t mind, would you?"

Evelyn smiled. "Does the sanatorium allow overnight guests?"

"Of course not." Annabelle’s tone was pointed.

Meaning they’d share the hotel.

Evelyn tossed the car keys to Alexander. "Your call."
###Chapter 15: I've Decided to Divorce

The air froze.

Three people stood in tense silence.

Evelyn Carter and Annabelle Taylor stood apart, with Alexander Hamilton between them.

Evelyn's lips twisted into a bitter smile. What an ironic scene.

A cliché love triangle straight out of the melodramas she despised.

"Oh my, isn't that Alexander?"

An elderly woman in a wheelchair approached, pushed by a middle-aged lady.

Alexander nodded politely. "Grandma Wen, Auntie Wen."

Before he could introduce Evelyn, Annabelle eagerly clasped the old woman's hands. "Grandma Wen, you look radiant today!"

The woman beamed. "Annabelle, still as sweet as ever."

Auntie Wen gasped. "Mom, you're so alert today! Just last week you barely recognized me."

"How could I forget Alexander's little wife?" The old woman patted Annabelle's hand. "He used to follow her everywhere—carrying her backpack, buying her snacks..."

Auntie Wen paled, hastily pointing at Evelyn. "Mom, you're mistaken. That's Alexander's wife."

The woman stubbornly shook her head. "Nonsense! I don't even know that girl. Alexander, tell her!"

Alexander's brow furrowed as he opened his mouth to explain.

"Alexander!" Annabelle tugged his sleeve, her voice sugary. "Remember that rainy day we took shelter under Grandma Wen's eaves?"

The old woman nodded enthusiastically. "Yes! You held your jacket over her head while you got soaked. Even then, I knew you'd grow into a devoted man."

Auntie Wen stamped her foot. "Mom, stop this—" She shot Evelyn an apologetic glance. "Please don't mind her, she's—"

Annabelle cheerfully interrupted. "Auntie Wen, you weren't home that day. Grandma lent us her umbrella."

Auntie Wen froze, giving Evelyn a helpless look.

Evelyn said calmly, "It's fine."

The old woman kept rambling. "Soon you'll be parents! How time flies..."

"Mom!" Auntie Wen hastily wheeled her away. "We're late for the hospital. Alexander, do visit us soon."

As they left, Auntie Wen gave Evelyn an awkward nod—without even knowing her name.

Annabelle waved enthusiastically. "Bye, Grandma Wen!"

Evelyn met Alexander's gaze briefly before silently sliding into the backseat.

The door slammed shut.

Vivian Dempsey had been right. How could she compete with twenty years of history?

This backseat was her answer—she'd surrendered the front to them.

Alexander hesitated.

Annabelle already buckled herself into the passenger seat. "Hurry up! We'll miss our sushi reservation."

Alexander remained still.

"Even Dr. Carter doesn't mind," Annabelle pouted. "Why the hesitation?"

As the engine roared to life, Evelyn turned toward the window.

Through the rearview mirror, Alexander's conflicted expression spoke volumes.

His sigh was drowned by the engine's growl.

Her phone buzzed.

Vivian's text: "On your way?"

Evelyn typed: "I've decided."

A string of question marks followed.

Her fingers tapped: "Divorce."

......

The resort lobby glittered with opulence.

The receptionist smiled. "Our deluxe suites are $1,000 per night."

Alexander said, "Two rooms."

Annabelle arched a brow. "Why two?"

"My wife and I will share one. You'll have your own."

Annabelle crossed her arms. "You've changed. In high school, you wouldn't even let me into your room."

"We were teenagers."

"Prude." She turned to the receptionist. "Make it three."

Alexander frowned. "We're married—"

"Cheapskate!" Rolling her eyes, Annabelle told the receptionist, "Three rooms. Final answer."

The receptionist glanced at Alexander uncertainly.

Annabelle snatched the keycards. "He does what I say."

She frowned at the allocation. "Why two on the 8th floor and one on the 2nd?"

The receptionist explained, "It's peak season—"

"A standard suite? Unacceptable!" Annabelle waved dismissively, shoving a keycard at Evelyn. "Second floor's closer to the restaurants. How convenient."
###Chapter 16: A Long-Planned Declaration of War

Alexander Hamilton reached for the keycard, but Annabelle Taylor dodged his grasp like a nimble butterfly, flashing him a provocative smirk.

"Annabelle!" His voice simmered with suppressed anger.

"What?" She twirled the keycard between her fingers. "Dr. Carter is here for the first time. I'm just showing her around the hotel."

"Stop this."

Ignoring him, she pressed the keycard into Evelyn Carter's palm. "Second-floor suite. The restaurant is to your right." Her fingertip grazed Evelyn's skin—a subtle but deliberate provocation.

The two women locked eyes, tension crackling between them.

Evelyn glanced at the keycard, her lips curving slightly. "Thank you, Miss Taylor. Though I’d prefer directions from the hotel staff—they’re more professional."

"Suit yourself." Annabelle's smile was enigmatic.

Evelyn's luggage was minimal—a few changes of clothes stuffed into a tote, her white coat neatly folded. She never bothered with excess; in the hospital, everyone dressed the same.

"I'll head up now."

The motion-activated lights flickered on as she ascended the stairs. The moment the door closed behind her, she slumped against it, sliding to the floor, all pretense abandoned.

Her phone screen lit up with a string of missed calls from Vivian Dempsey.

"Hello?"

"What the hell? Vacation turns into divorce?" Vivian's voice exploded in her ear.

Evelyn summarized the situation in a few clipped sentences. A sharp shattering sound followed—Vivian had probably thrown a glass.

"Divorce her! That woman is clearly here to steal him!" Vivian hissed. "I'll pick you up tomorrow."

At lunch, Alexander's call came right on schedule.

"Seafood allergy," Evelyn said, staring at the swaying trees outside.

"There are other options."

"Not hungry."

"What did you eat?"

"Dog food."

Silence.

"See you tonight." She hung up and tossed the phone onto the bed. Exhaustion hit her like a wave, and she was unconscious before her head hit the pillow.

When she woke, the sunset painted the room gold. Evelyn lay still, staring at the ceiling, then froze as realization dawned. Her fingers drifted to her abdomen.

As a doctor, she knew exactly what this abnormal fatigue meant.

The restaurant was nearly empty. She ordered two bowls of congee and hot milk. The moment the server set them down, the golden couple appeared in the doorway.

"Wasn’t sure about your preferences, Miss Taylor. Just milk." Evelyn pushed the cup toward her.

Annabelle took a sip, then abruptly spat it out.

Instinct kicked in. Evelyn handed her a napkin. "Morning sickness?"

"I can’t stand sweetened milk." Annabelle ignored the offered napkin.

Alexander took it instead. "She only drinks plain milk."

Evelyn laughed softly. "A little sugar makes you vomit?"

"Personal preference." Annabelle shoved her half-finished milk at Alexander. "Don’t waste it."

When she started picking through his congee with chopsticks, Evelyn finally set her spoon down.

"Ginger?" Annabelle held up a strand. "Alexander hates ginger and century eggs."

Evelyn kept eating, eyes on her bowl.

"I never mentioned it to Evelyn," Alexander said, downing several spoonfuls. "The mountain air is damp. Ginger helps."

Annabelle stood abruptly, snatching the bowl. "Marriage is supposed to make you happy, not miserable!"

The porcelain clattered against the table, drawing stares.

"Enough." Alexander's expression darkened.

"You don’t even know each other. How can this be a marriage?" Annabelle sneered.

Evelyn wiped her mouth and stood. "Enjoy your meal."

"I'll walk you back," Alexander offered.

"Unnecessary."

"Then a stroll? The night view—"

"Reports to write." She strode toward the elevator without looking back. Annabelle's shrill voice chased her: "Alexander, how long will you keep lying to yourself?"

The elevator doors slid shut, sealing her in silence. Staring at her distorted reflection in the metal, Evelyn suddenly wanted to laugh.

This battle? She’d lost it from the start.
###Chapter 17: Alexander, Stop Playing Dumb

Fate is always fair.

Evelyn Carter discovered that when love failed her, work flourished. The project report that had plagued her for two months was miraculously completed after one sleepless night.

At 5:30 AM, her phone screen lit up.

"I'm on my way. Be there in an hour," Vivian Dempsey's voice came through the receiver.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone. "You didn’t have to come this early."

"Any later and we’ll hit traffic!" Vivian yawned. "Hurry up and get ready. I hate waiting."

Her luggage was already packed—a backpack with a charger and a few changes of clothes sat quietly on the coffee table.

She hadn’t brought her laptop, finishing the entire report on her phone. Now her eyes burned as if rubbed with sandpaper.

With time to spare before Vivian’s arrival, Evelyn stepped onto the balcony. The mountain breeze was crisp, unexpectedly refreshing.

The luxury suite’s terrace offered a breathtaking view of the entire mountain range. But the peaceful morning was shattered by a heated argument from above.

She didn’t need to look up. That voice was all too familiar.

"So, you’re abandoning me now?" Annabelle Taylor’s tearful voice cut through the quiet.

"I’m married," Alexander Hamilton replied, his tone icy.

"But you love me!"

Silence.

"Alexander, the woman you married is also named Evelyn. Don’t tell me that’s a coincidence!"

He suddenly laughed, the sound laced with mockery. "And what position are you asking from? My best friend?"

"You’re angry with me."

The scent of tobacco drifted through the air. He was smoking again.

"I know I was wrong. Terribly wrong."

"You weren’t wrong," Alexander’s voice turned sharp. "How could you ever be wrong?"

Annabelle’s tone softened. "Alexander… let’s stop being friends. I want to be your woman."

Evelyn turned and walked back inside, her fingers cold.

The thin veil had finally been torn apart.

Her phone lit up again. Margaret Hamilton had sent over a dozen wedding dress photos. "Evelyn, which one do you like?"

"Mom, why are we looking at wedding dresses all of a sudden?"

"You never had a proper wedding. Let’s make up for it during your vacation. The Hamiltons won’t shortchange you."

Messages kept coming—invitation designs, favor boxes, guest gifts. Her mother-in-law had planned every detail.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn, are you awake?"

Alexander stood at the door, his eyes bloodshot.

"What is it?"

"...Yeah."

She stepped aside to let him in and gestured to the sofa. "Sit."

He glanced around. "Why aren’t you in pajamas?"

"Alexander." She called him by his full name for the first time. "Say what you need to say."

He hesitated several times. Evelyn waited patiently.

"Let’s… get a divorce."

"Sure." Her reply was immediate, her lips even curving into a smile.

His head snapped up. "Aren’t you going to ask why?"

"I already know." She met his gaze squarely. "Alexander, stop playing dumb."

He covered his face, his voice hoarse. "...I’m sorry."

"Congratulations."

"For what?"

"Your twenty-year wait has finally paid off."

"...You knew all along?"

"It wasn’t hard to guess."

Alexander shut his eyes in pain. "I really did want to spend my life with you..."

"If Annabelle hadn’t come back," Evelyn finished for him.

"The house is yours..."

"I don’t need money."

"Then if you ever—"

"Let’s not stay in touch after the divorce."

He gave a bitter laugh. "We could still be friends..."

"Friends?" Evelyn scoffed. "The best friend kind?"

Alexander fell silent.

Her phone rang at the perfect moment. Vivian’s voice was bright. "I’m here. Come down!"

Evelyn slung her backpack over her shoulder and reached for the doorknob.

"Who was that?" Alexander asked.

"A friend." She turned back with a faint smile. "A real one."
###Chapter 18: The Bloodstained Gift

Vivian Dempsey's Porsche 911 gleamed a blinding red under the sun.

As the only daughter of the Dempsey Group, she had been pampered since childhood. Except for that dark period during senior year, her life had been smooth sailing.

"Don't go back to that dingy apartment," Vivian turned the steering wheel. "Stay at my place for a few days."

Evelyn Carter stared at the scenery rushing past the window. "Take me to the hospital."

"Are you insane?" Vivian slammed the brakes. "Drowning your heartbreak in work?"

"No."

"Then why? How about Bali? I heard there's a new diving club—"

"An abortion."

......

From medical student to OB-GYN, Evelyn had seen countless girls coming in for abortions.

She never imagined she'd one day lie on the examination table in her own clinic.

"Dr. Carter, are you sure?" Olivia Lightfoot's pen clattered to the floor. "Your husband is so—"

"Perfect?"

"All the female staff envy you for marrying the ideal man. Remember that pregnant car crash victim? He was the one who brought her in."

The ideal man?

Evelyn thought of the typhoon two years ago.

Winds howled, trees toppled, roofs collapsed. When she got the emergency call, Alexander Hamilton had only said one word: "Go."

The car swayed violently in the storm. His knuckles whitened on the wheel, jawline sharp as a blade.

"Don't be afraid," he'd said.

In that moment, she truly wasn't.

At the hospital, he ruffled her hair. "I'll wait for you at home."

Falling in love takes an instant.

So does heartbreak.

"Prescribe the pills," Evelyn said.

......

The medication abortion felt like torture.

Four hours later, Evelyn staggered out of the restroom, leaning against the wall, her face ghostly pale.

Vivian rushed to support her. "Can you walk?"

"Vi..." Evelyn weakly rested her head on Vivian's shoulder.

The childhood nickname made Vivian's eyes redden. She carefully avoided the bloodied tissue in Evelyn's hand. "Let me throw it away."

"I'll do it."

Understanding flashed in Vivian's eyes. She gently patted Evelyn's back. "Okay."

When Olivia brought hot water, Evelyn was already standing.

"Where are you going?"

"The medical waste center."

"At least rest first—"

"Now." Evelyn clenched the tissue. "It ends today."

They walked slowly toward the hospital entrance.

A figure stood at the foot of the steps.

Alexander held the prenatal report, his fingers bone-white. "You left your wallet at the hotel."

Evelyn smiled bitterly. "How careless of me."

His gaze locked onto her hand. "What's that?"

She slowly uncurled her fingers.

The blood-soaked tissue revealed a small, indistinct mass of flesh.

"A birthday gift," she said with a smile. "Do you like it?"
###Chapter 19: Alexander, Let's End This Here

Alexander Hamilton's knuckles turned white, veins bulging. He took a deep breath, his voice hoarse. "Evelyn, you're always so composed."

"Clarity comes from composure. This is best for all three of us."

"Three?"

"I can start my life anew. You won't be tied down by a child—Annabelle will give you children someday. As for Miss Taylor..."

A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips. "She won't need to study inheritance laws anymore, or scheme to secure her future child's share of the family fortune."

Alexander remained silent.

He knew Annabelle's tactics better than anyone.

"Most importantly," Evelyn gently touched her abdomen, "I want my child to be born into a family filled with love. At the very least, his father should genuinely love his mother."

Alexander kept his head lowered, unable to meet her gaze.

"Let's leave it at this," Evelyn turned away. "Going our separate ways is the best outcome."

A single tear slid down the man's cheek.

Years in the OB-GYN department had shown Evelyn too many indifferent husbands. Wives screaming in agony during labor while their partners scrolled through videos outside.

At first, she'd confront them angrily.

The response was always the same: "None of your business."

Eventually, she understood—men would never comprehend the hardships of pregnancy. They'd never endured morning sickness or the bone-shattering pain of childbirth.

The most chilling case was the woman who went into shock from the pain, only for her husband to insist on waiting for an "auspicious date" before allowing a C-section.

After that, Olivia swore off marriage entirely.

"Dr. Carter," Olivia had asked, trembling, "do men just not care about their unborn children? Even if they don't love their wives, aren't they afraid something might happen to the baby?"

Evelyn had no answer.

She'd seen too many men coldly say, "Get rid of it," to their weeping wives.

If she'd told Alexander about the pregnancy back then, what would he have chosen?

Keep the child?

Forever placing an outsider between him and his first love.

Would Annabelle have tolerated that?

Evelyn even thought of that age-old question: If she and the child were both in danger, who would Alexander save?

The answer had always been obvious.
###Chapter 20: This Is Where We End

Alexander's knuckles turned white, veins bulging. He stared at Evelyn, his Adam's apple bobbing. "You're always so rational."

"Those who aren't rational only end up hurting more."

"You won't even give me the chance to hurt?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Give you a chance, and then what? Watch you and Annabelle argue over this child? Watch my baby grow up unwanted?"

Alexander abruptly turned his face away.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting fragmented shadows across his profile. His lashes trembled like a dying butterfly's wings.

"Alexander, let's be realistic. This child shouldn't be your burden or Annabelle's resentment."

"How do you know she—"

"I've seen too many stories like this." Evelyn cut him off. "A hospital is where human nature is laid bare."

She remembered the woman last week, enduring twenty hours of labor pains while her husband played games outside the delivery room. When a nurse spoke up, he snapped, "None of your damn business."

Or last month’s case—a mother-in-law insisting on natural birth because a C-section would "ruin" the chance for a second child. Even as the mother hemorrhaged, the family was still debating the baby’s astrological fate.

"Alexander, ask yourself honestly." Evelyn met his gaze. "If it were Annabelle lying here, would you let her suffer like this?"

His pupils constricted.

The answer was obvious.

"So, this is where we end." Evelyn pulled the blanket higher. "I’ll handle the baby."

"Evelyn!" Alexander suddenly seized her wrist. "Let me think—"

"Think about what?" Her laugh was cold. "How to balance two women? Or how to explain this to Annabelle?"

She yanked her hand back, leaving a red mark on her wrist.

"Leave. While I can still speak to you calmly."

Alexander stood frozen, like a statue. The setting sun stretched his shadow long across the floor.

Finally, he turned and walked out.

The door closed softly—like a sigh.

Evelyn stared at the ceiling, counting the cracks. One, two… By the seventeenth, her pillow was soaked.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Olivia: Dr. Carter, the family of Patient 3 is causing a scene again. They’re accusing us of refusing a C-section on purpose…

Evelyn wiped her tears and replied: On my way.

She pulled out the IV needle. A bead of blood welled up. What was this pain compared to the women screaming alone in delivery rooms?

In the hallway, she passed Alexander.

Neither looked back.
###Chapter 21: Intrauterine Pregnancy Approximately 4+ Weeks, Viable Embryo

Alexander Hamilton stood at the end of the hospital corridor, the cigarette between his fingers burned down to the filter.

He stared at the crumpled and then smoothed-out prenatal report in his hand. The words were still legible.

Intrauterine pregnancy approximately 4+ weeks, viable embryo.

The word viable stabbed into his vision like a needle.

He remembered Evelyn’s straight-backed figure as she walked away, and the hostile glare Vivian Dempsey had thrown over her shoulder.

Evelyn had never been a fragile woman.

He should have known.

From the first time she stood in the operating room for eight hours straight, to the way she calmly faced down questioning families in the hospital hallway.

There was a cold, unshakable logic in her bones.

Even now, she had arranged the abortion with clinical precision.

No hysterics. No tears. Not even a word to him—the father.

If not for that wallet, if not for that neatly folded prenatal report…

He might never have known how close he’d come to fatherhood.

His phone buzzed again.

The name Annabelle Taylor flashed insistently on the screen.

He muted it and shoved the phone back into his pocket.

At the far end of the hallway, a surgical light glowed.

He didn’t know if it was Evelyn’s operating room.

But he knew that when that light went out, nothing would remain between them.

Ash fell onto the back of his hand, the burn making him flinch.

Suddenly, he remembered the way Evelyn had told him about the pregnancy.

She had just come home from a night shift, her face alarmingly pale.

He thought she was just exhausted.

Until she pulled out the pregnancy test—two clear lines.

"Alexander, we’re going to be parents."

She had smiled so softly then, her eyes bright.

Now, that light was gone.

The operating room door swung open.

A nurse hurried out, holding a clipboard.

"Family of Evelyn Carter?"

He instinctively stepped forward—then froze.

What right did he have to call himself family now?

The nurse gave him a puzzled look before striding off in another direction.

His phone vibrated again in his pocket.

This time, he turned it off completely.

The antiseptic hospital smell suddenly turned acrid.

He turned toward the elevators—only to collide with Vivian at the corner.

She was holding a water bottle, her expression hardening when she saw him.

"What are you still doing here?" Her voice was ice.

He opened his mouth, but no words came.

Vivian scoffed. "Evelyn was right. You didn’t deserve to know."

She brushed past him, leaving behind a faint trace of disinfectant.

As the elevator doors closed, he heard the distant clatter of surgical instruments.

Soft, but piercing.

Like something being severed forever.
###Chapter 22: She Wants Nothing

Annabelle's saccharine voice grated on Alexander's nerves like nails on chalkboard.

His knuckles turned white as he gripped the phone, veins bulging along his tensed forearm.

"Alexander, did you find her?" Annabelle feigned concern.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Yes."

"Did she use the baby to blackmail you?" Her voice turned shrill. "I've seen plenty of women like her, trying to climb the social ladder with a pregnancy."

"Enough!" Alexander's sharp interruption cut through her words. "Evelyn would never do that."

Silence stretched for several heartbeats.

"Then..." Annabelle's tone brightened suddenly. "Did she agree to the divorce?"

Alexander felt like a blunt knife was sawing through his heart.

"She wants nothing." His voice came out hoarse. "Not even... me."

Annabelle's laughter tinkled through the receiver. "Perfect! Saves us the trouble."

Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "But we should make her sign an agreement. Just in case she secretly keeps the baby—"

"The baby's gone." His words were glacial.

"Really?" Her pitch skyrocketed. "Fantastic! Now there's absolutely no loose ends."

She prattled about celebration plans for the evening, but Alexander stopped listening.

"Alexander? Are you there?" Annabelle cooed. "We can finally start fresh."

He stared at the leaden sky outside the window.

"That was my child." Each word fell like a hammer blow.

Dead silence filled the line.

"Alexander..." Panic edged her voice now. "You don't mean—"

He ended the call with decisive finality.

Standing before the window, he studied his own reflection in the glass.

His eyes held oceans of unspeakable grief.
###Chapter 23: Farewell in the Ashes

Evelyn finally understood the reason behind all his unusual behavior today.

She softened her voice. "You love me, don't you?"

"......"

"We'll get married. That child would only stand in the way of our happiness. You can easily have children—we'll have our own someday. The one in my belly will carry the Hamilton name."

"......"

"Don't overthink it. She's only been pregnant for a month. That’s not even a life yet, just—"

"Enough."

The image of that blood-soaked tissue flashed before Alexander’s eyes, the searing crimson burning his heart.

"When will you be back? I’ll wait for you for dinner."

"I need to be alone."

......

The distance from the OB-GYN Department to the Medical Waste Center was only two hundred meters.

As a doctor, she usually covered it in two minutes. Today, it took her twenty, even with Vivian’s support.

Waves of pain radiated from her abdomen, her hospital gown soaked with cold sweat.

Vivian turned away, discreetly wiping her tears.

"Vivian."

Vivian quickly wiped her face. "What is it?"

"Do you have a lighter?"

"I don’t smoke. Why do you need one?"

"I want to burn it." Evelyn stared at the crumpled paper in her hand. "Medical waste gets shredded and buried. I don’t want it mixed with all that filth."

Vivian nodded firmly. "I’ll find one."

"Where?"

"I’ll manage. You rest."

Evelyn held her back. "No smoking on hospital grounds."

Vivian suddenly remembered. "Alexander was smoking earlier..."

"......"

"Forget I said that."

In the end, Vivian bought a lighter from a convenience store outside the hospital.

They found an empty corner.

The paper dissolved into ashes in the flames.

A gust of wind scattered the remnants until nothing remained.

Vivian lifted her head, watching the last traces vanish into the air.

She turned to Evelyn.

The oversized hospital gown made her look even frailer, as if the wind could carry her away at any moment.

"Evelyn, just cry."

Evelyn shook her head. "Let’s go, Vivian."

"I’ll help you back to your room."

"Not this way." Evelyn pointed to another path. "We can go around."

"But that’s much longer. In your condition—"

Then Vivian understood.

Alexander was still there. She’d rather endure the pain of a detour than see him again.

Tears spilled over.

Evelyn gently wiped them away. "I’m not even crying."

Vivian turned her face. "The wind got in my eyes."

Evelyn leaned against her shoulder. "Don’t cry."

"Okay." Vivian whispered, "You’ll have a better life."

"Yes, I will."

"Alexander just now... he looked terrible."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Did he?"

"Like he’d lost his soul. I’ve never seen him like that."

Evelyn gazed into the distance. "Time heals everything."
###Chapter 24: A Thousand Days and Nights

Does time heal all wounds?

A minute? An hour? Or a lifetime?

Evelyn stood by the window, watching a young couple laugh and play in the morning light. The boy clumsily handed her breakfast, and the girl’s laughter rang like wind chimes.

She suddenly remembered the first time Alexander brought her breakfast.

Back then, he was dressed in a tailored suit but blushed like a schoolboy as he pressed a steaming cup of soy milk into her hands.

"Dr. Carter, drink it while it's hot."

Now, he had finally found the person he truly wanted to bring breakfast to.

Vivian’s apartment was in the heart of the city, floor-to-ceiling windows framing the bustling streets below. Evelyn watched elderly joggers, housewives with grocery bags, and office workers rushing for buses.

The world kept turning. Only her time had stopped.

"Cry if you need to," Vivian said, handing her a cup of tea. "The walls are soundproof."

The fragrant steam curled upward. Evelyn stared at the tea leaves swirling in her cup.

Three years ago, on a rainy night, Alexander had shown up at her on-call room, drenched.

"Dr. Carter, can I borrow an umbrella?"

Later, he always said that rain had brought them together.

Now she wondered—maybe that rain had always been meant for someone else.

"I'm fine," Evelyn heard herself say. "I just need time to adjust."

Vivian scoffed. "Oh please. That’s not what you told me when I got dumped."

She remembered. Vivian had been sobbing on the rooftop, and Evelyn had gripped her wrist tight.

"Is a scumbag worth this?"

Now she was asking herself the same question.

Children’s laughter drifted in from outside. Evelyn recalled Alexander saying he wanted a daughter.

"One just like you," he’d murmured, brushing her hair aside. "Smart and gentle."

Now he could have that with the woman he truly loved.

Vivian suddenly shoved a pillow into her hands. "Go on, punch it. It’s new—soft enough."

Evelyn shook her head, but something warm trailed down her cheek.

The body was more honest than the heart.

Her fingers brushed the faint mark on her ring finger. Three years of marriage had left a deeper imprint than she’d realized.

"I always knew," she whispered. "Every time he drank, it was her name he called."

Vivian’s hand froze mid-air.

The spring breeze carried in the scent of flowers. Evelyn remembered the last time she and Alexander saw the cherry blossoms.

His phone had lit up then—Annabelle glaring on the screen.

"A colleague," he’d explained.

How ironic. Even their names felt like a cruel joke.

"Evelyn." Vivian’s voice turned serious. "Let’s go somewhere."

"Hm?"

"Tibet, Xinjiang, Antarctica—anywhere far." Her eyes sparkled. "The farther, the better."

Evelyn looked out the window. The sunlight was blinding, burning her eyes.

Funny how the world seemed unbearably bright when your heart was breaking.
###Chapter 25: The Agonizing Choice

Evelyn Carter leaned against the sofa. Sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains, casting a thin golden line on the floor.

Vivian Dempsey's words were like a key, unlocking the floodgates of memory.

At seventeen, she had been a lovesick girl who nearly paid with her life. Now, at least, she still had her sanity.

"Back then..." Evelyn asked softly, "how did you get through it?"

Vivian shrugged, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her coffee cup. "Time heals all wounds. Even the deepest scars will eventually scab over."

Evelyn looked down at her abdomen.

It had once cradled a tiny life. Now, only a dull ache remained, a constant reminder of what had been.

Vivian suddenly leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "Want me to introduce you to some eligible bachelors?"

"Now?" Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "Do you really think I'm in the mood?"

Her fingertips pressed lightly against her stomach. Waves of post-surgical pain ebbed and flowed.

Vivian covered Evelyn's hand with her own. "Evelyn... do you really not regret it?"

Evelyn closed her eyes and shook her head.

"I get it." Vivian sighed. "You're much stronger than I thought."

"It's not strength," Evelyn said, opening her eyes. "It's just... there was no other choice."

Vivian's expression turned solemn. "The greatest pain in life isn't making the wrong decision. It's not even having the chance to regret it."

Evelyn picked up her phone and scrolled through Vivian's social media feed.

The screen was filled with melancholic quotes and Zen-inspired images.

Under the latest post, someone had commented: "Another breakup?"

Vivian's reply made Evelyn raise an eyebrow: "Fools repeat mistakes. The wise pursue doctorates. Are you prepping for grad school?"

"Just rhyming for fun," Vivian said with a dismissive wave.

Suddenly, her face froze.

Evelyn refreshed the page but saw no new comments.

"What's wrong?"

Vivian shot to her feet. "I need to make a call on the balcony."

The moment the balcony door closed, furious shouting erupted.

"Have you lost your damn mind? Changing your profile picture now?!"

"..."

"You couldn't wait to flaunt your new relationship? At least let Evelyn recover first!"

"..."

"She told you to change it, so you did? Alexander Hamilton, have you no conscience? She just had surgery!"

"..."

"Bullshit! Do you have any idea what she's been through these past two days? You think she doesn't feel pain?!"

Evelyn's fingers went numb.

So that was it.

He and Annabelle Taylor had changed to matching couple photos.
###Chapter 26: The Secret Behind Matching Profile Pictures

Evelyn tapped open WeChat, her finger pausing mid-air.

Alexander Hamilton had indeed changed his profile picture.

The solitary cloud that once symbolized his aloof demeanor was gone. In its place stood a cartoon boy puckering his lips to the right, as if blowing a kiss.

It didn’t take a genius to guess Annabelle Taylor’s matching avatar—a cartoon girl leaning left for a kiss.

Such a childish, overt display of coupledom clashed starkly with Alexander’s usual composed and restrained style.

No wonder Vivian Dempsey had smashed her phone in fury.

The balcony door slid open as Vivian stormed inside, her energy electric.

Evelyn quickly locked her screen and stuffed the phone into her pocket.

"Where’s your phone?" Vivian’s gaze swept the room like a bloodhound on alert.

"In my pocket," Evelyn gestured casually. "Sixteenth floor. Didn’t want to risk dropping it."

Vivian exhaled in relief, slinging an arm around her shoulders. "Good thinking. Would’ve been a shame to break it."

She hesitated, then added, "Try not to stare at screens too much these days. Bad for your eyes."

"Mm." Evelyn deftly changed the subject. "Who were you yelling at on the phone earlier?"

"Just some idiot who learned the hard way not to mess with me." Vivian smirked, tilting her chin up. "You know how I get."

Evelyn offered a practiced smile.

The TV droned on with midday news, dull and lifeless.

Normally, she’d be buried in work at the hospital by now. The sudden emptiness of free time made the hours drag.

"Let’s go!" Vivian sprang up. "I’m taking you to karaoke to blow off steam!"

Half an hour later, the private room thrummed with noise.

Vivian had rallied five or six friends, now belting lyrics into microphones. Amid the deafening music, Evelyn rubbed her temples.

"Your turn!" Vivian thrust a mic at her.

Evelyn shook her head. "I’m terrible at singing."

"Who cares?" Vivian was already at the song selection screen. "Pick something! I’ll queue it!"

A young man in a polo shirt approached. His gold-rimmed glasses gave him a scholarly air.

"Need help choosing?" he asked Vivian, though his eyes lingered on Evelyn.

Vivian arched a brow. "My bestie’s a first-timer. Keep it simple."

"Do you know any Faye Wong songs?" He turned to Evelyn.

"A few old ones."

"How about 'Red Bean'?"

"I can manage, but I’m rusty."

He smiled. "I’ll guide you."

His voice was warm, his gaze behind the lenses friendly. Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, her phone buzzed insistently.

Alexander Hamilton’s name flashed across the screen.
###Chapter 27: Love's Red Bean

Before Vivian Dempsey could react, the man gently pulled her up and guided her to sit on the nearby couch.

He settled naturally beside Evelyn Carter, maintaining just the right distance—close enough to hear each other clearly, yet not so close as to make her uncomfortable.

The song's prelude began to flow softly.

On the large screen, the youthful face of Faye Wong appeared, her eyes clear and bright, carrying a hint of a young girl's stubbornness and liveliness.

Evelyn's profile looked especially gentle in the dim light. Hers wasn't a striking beauty, but more like a cup of delicate tea—subtle yet growing richer with every sip.

"Ready? Five, four, three, two..."

Evelyn held the microphone and softly sang along with the rhythm: "Haven't had the chance to feel the snowflakes bloom in the air... If we shiver together, we'll understand what tenderness truly means..."

Her voice lacked Faye Wong's ethereal quality, but it carried its own warmth—like a spring breeze skimming the surface of a lake.

Someone nudged Vivian. "Viv, you call this 'can't sing'? Who are you kidding?"

Vivian, mouth full of honeydew melon, mumbled, "I've honestly never heard her sing before..."

"A woman in her twenties who's never been to karaoke?"

"She's a doctor. She's always swamped with work. When would she have the time—"

The friend smirked. "Maybe she came with a boyfriend?"

Vivian smacked the back of his head. "Shut up! Don't mention that word!"

"...Oh." The friend suddenly lowered his voice. "Look at Gregory..."

Vivian turned and saw Gregory Wilson had already set down his microphone, his gaze fixed intently on Evelyn.

"You don't think he..."

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Hmm... Maybe it's not such a bad idea?"

"Both doctors. Perfect match."

Vivian asked cautiously, "He's single now, right?"

"Total virgin bachelor."

Vivian stroked her chin, deep in thought.

"Sometimes, sometimes... I believe everything has an end... Meetings and partings all have their time... Nothing lasts forever..."

As the song faded, Evelyn realized her cheeks were already wet.

Meetings and partings all have their time. How fitting those lyrics were.

A tissue appeared in front of her. She looked up and met a pair of gentle eyes.
###Chapter 28: A Confession Hidden in Time

Evelyn's fingers tightened slightly around the tissue.

"The lyrics of this song are beautiful," Gregory remarked softly, as if afraid to disturb someone's dream.

"Mmm."

"Some melodies are like time machines—they always bring you back to specific moments."

She lowered her lashes. He was covering for her earlier emotional slip.

"Gregory Wilson. The Dempsey family's old friend."

"Evelyn Carter."

"The youngest OB-GYN director at Central Hospital. A legend in Hudson's medical field." He paused. "I'd heard about you before returning."

She looked up. "You're a doctor too?"

"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Just came back last month."

"So an elite returnee." A faint smile touched her lips.

"Your voice suits this song perfectly." His gaze lingered on her flushed fingertips. "Not just being polite."

"Perhaps... it's the mood."

A sudden weight pressed on her shoulder. Vivian had appeared unnoticed, half-draping herself over Evelyn.

"What's so engrossing?" Vivian blinked, mischief dancing at the corners of her mouth.

Gregory adjusted his glasses. "Medical research papers and nostalgic golden oldies."

"How rare. You usually don't speak more than three sentences to women." Vivian nudged Evelyn. "Seems our Dr. Carter has quite the charm."

Evelyn pinched her. "Stop talking nonsense."

"Which part is nonsense?" Vivian turned to Gregory. "Right, Greg?"

Before Evelyn could intervene, Gregory said, "Actually, I've known Dr. Carter for eight years."

"What?!" Vivian's exclamation drew glances from nearby guests.

Evelyn froze. "We've... met before?"

"During the Sino-American medical exchange our freshman year. You gave me a note at Yifu Building."

The floodgates of memory burst open. Evelyn's ears burned instantly.

Vivian gripped her arm excitedly. "Oh my god! Was it a love letter?!"

"Technically," Gregory produced a yellowed envelope from his inner pocket, "it was a memo."

Evelyn stared at the familiar pale blue envelope, her breath catching.

It was the confession letter she'd delivered for a friend.

"Eight years..." Vivian gasped. "Greg, don't tell me you—"

Gregory set the envelope gently on the coffee table. Behind his metal-framed glasses, his gaze was profound yet tender. "I've always wanted to return this to you personally."
###Chapter 29: The Truth About the Crush

Gregory Wilson spread his hands helplessly. "I lost my luggage when I returned home. That letter didn’t make it back either."

Vivian Dempsey pressed eagerly, "Do you still remember what it said?"

"It’s been so many years," Evelyn Carter murmured. "Love letters are all the same—just confessions of feelings, maybe with a few lines of poetry thrown in?"

"Greg, out with it!"

The atmosphere in the private room shifted instantly.

Those singing put down their microphones. Those drinking set aside their glasses. Everyone crowded closer.

Evelyn felt like she was under a spotlight, with nowhere to hide.

Gregory’s voice was calm. "I remember that letter very clearly. The first line was—"

He paused.

"Your zipper is down."

The air froze.

"Looks impressive."

Bang!

Someone kicked over the coffee table. The fruit platter shattered, sending pieces rolling across the floor.

Vivian slapped Evelyn’s back. "Evelyn, I had no idea you were so bold!"

Gregory added, "The writing was quite good. Rhymed perfectly."

Evelyn’s face turned as red as a boiled crab.

"Wait, that’s a mistake!" she stammered. "I didn’t write that! My roommate had a crush on someone and asked me to deliver the letter. There were too many people around—I must’ve given it to the wrong person... But no, I remember no one saw me leave it. How did you know it was me?"

A flicker of amusement crossed Gregory’s eyes. "Fate, I suppose."

The suggestive answer made the room erupt in even louder excitement.

Evelyn had never been in a situation like this. During her school days, though some had shown interest, she’d always kept her distance. After starting work, she spent her days with expectant mothers and newborns—the only man she interacted with was the married anesthesiologist.

She shot a pleading look at Vivian.

Vivian was too busy cheering to notice.

One of the guys cut straight to the point. "Greg, do you have feelings for Dr. Carter?"

Evelyn’s heart skipped a beat.

The room fell silent.

"No."

She exhaled in relief.

"I’ve liked her for a long time."

Crash!

Another beer bottle toppled over, glass shattering everywhere.

The room exploded with whoops and cheers.

"No wonder Greg actually showed up to the reunion today! He had ulterior motives!"

"Seven years, from freshman year till now? That’s some serious restraint!"

Vivian slammed her palm on the table. "I approve of this match!"

But Gregory turned to Evelyn, his voice soft. "I’m sorry."

"What?"

"I didn’t plan to say it this soon, but the conversation led here. I hope I haven’t made you uncomfortable."
###Chapter 30: The Heart's Desire

Evelyn Carter felt her ears burn.

Her fingers twisted together unconsciously as she murmured, "It's fine."

"What about you?" Gregory Wilson asked.

"Me?"

"What kind of person is your ideal partner?"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Vivian Dempsey jumped in. "Someone gentle, successful, from a good family—and most importantly, handsome."

Every criteria seemed tailor-made for Alexander Hamilton.

Gregory's lips curved slightly. "Aside from looks being subjective, I believe I meet the rest?"

Vivian tilted her head, studying him. "Different style, but yeah, you're attractive."

"So," Gregory turned to Evelyn, "Dr. Carter already has someone in mind?"

A timid voice piped up from behind them. "They already broke up."

Evelyn whirled toward Vivian, who threw her hands up. "Not me!"

She immediately smacked the man who'd spoken. "Mind your own business! Apologize!"

The man ducked away. "Sorry, sorry..."

Gregory nodded in understanding. "Heartbreak takes time. Focus on healing first. The rest can wait."

Evelyn studied him.

This man's composure was unnerving. If the rumors were true—that he'd harbored feelings for her for years without ever showing it—his self-control was remarkable.

Her thoughts drifted to Alexander.

The man who always appeared refined in public became reckless when in love. Changing his profile picture, his phone wallpaper—as if he wanted the whole world to witness his happiness.

"Dr. Carter?"

Gregory's voice pulled her back.

"Hmm?"

"You haven't answered my question." His gaze was gentle. "I want to hear it from you. What kind of person do you like?"

Evelyn hesitated. "I..."

Gregory waited patiently, his attention unwavering.

"I just want someone who genuinely loves me."

Vivian couldn't resist interjecting. "Well, duh. Who doesn't—" She abruptly clamped a hand over her mouth.

Hadn't Alexander been the perfect counterexample?

Vivian lowered her head in regret.

Evelyn continued calmly. "Looks, background, personality—none of that matters. What matters is that he chooses me for who I am. Not because I resemble someone else, or because of any connections."

Gregory gave a slight nod. "I understand."

Those words sent a pang through Evelyn's chest. Just how much did he know?

Night had deepened.

Vivian's red Porsche sped through the streets. Evelyn watched the neon lights blur past, her thoughts tangled.

"Don't overthink it," Vivian said. "Give Greg a chance. I've known him since we were kids. He's a good man."

The car hummed with the engine's roar. Evelyn closed her eyes, letting the night air brush against her skin.
###Chapter 31: The Elusive Devotion

Evelyn's fingers absently traced the rim of her coffee cup.

"Alexander hasn't either."

Her voice was soft as she gazed at the plane tree leaves drifting outside the window. That man, too, had been trapped in the cage of "best friends" by Annabelle—never truly experiencing love.

Vivian pursed her lips. "He's not like Alexander. Back when Gregory was abroad, he didn’t even have a fling. Just buried himself in the lab every day."

"Vivian."

"Hmm?"

"If someone confessed to you right after a breakup, would you say yes?"

Vivian's smile froze.

The café's gentle piano music stretched the silence unbearably long.

"...Fair point." Vivian finally sighed. "No one moves on that fast."

Evelyn took a sip of her now-cold coffee.

"But Gregory’s waited seven or eight years already. What’s a little longer?" Vivian suddenly leaned in. "Honestly, I think you two would be perfect together."

Evelyn closed her eyes, pretending to rest.

Perfect?

The Dempsey family had deep roots in H City. Anyone who could be their longtime friends must come from elite circles.

Would such a family accept a divorced woman who’d lost a child?

Vivian seemed to read her thoughts. "Alexander did. He even accepted the baby in Annabelle’s womb."

"There aren’t many fools that devoted in this world."

The piano music shifted abruptly to a cheerful tune, clashing with the mood.

Vivian opened her mouth but said nothing.

Romantic TV plots could never withstand reality’s cruelty.

The days that followed kept Evelyn unusually busy.

For the first time, she used up all her accumulated vacation days. A new runner appeared in the park at dawn, the kitchen smelled of freshly baked goods, and gym equipment bore witness to her sweat.

A month later, the mirror reflected rosy cheeks—even a slight weight gain.

Then one day at the gym entrance, a toddling little girl suddenly hugged her leg.

"Mommy!"

The sweet, childish voice was a blunt knife plunging into her heart.

If her baby had lived, would they be crawling by now? Would they have called her "Mommy" in that soft voice?

The child’s mother hurried over, apologizing that her daughter called everyone that.

Evelyn forced a smile.

Neither she nor Alexander were outgoing. Their child probably wouldn’t have been this lively. But remembering Alexander had been a school troublemaker in his youth, she laughed despite herself.

Then the tears fell.

I’m sorry, baby.

I hope you’ve found a better mommy in heaven.

One... whose daddy loves her with all his heart.
###Chapter 32: He Couldn't Let Go

Evelyn had completely severed ties with the Hamilton family.

During her leave, her apartment overflowed with gifts. Colleagues, friends, even her ex-mother-in-law Margaret had sent care packages.

Alexander's gifts were the most excessive. When Vivian opened the door, a towering stack of gift boxes nearly toppled onto her.

"These are all high-end," Vivian remarked, flipping through the items. "Some aren't even available domestically. What should we do with them?"

"Return them."

"Even Margaret's?"

"Yes." Evelyn's voice softened. "I'll buy some age-appropriate supplements to send back to her."

Vivian raised an eyebrow but didn't press further.

Evelyn had her reasons. Margaret had treated her like a daughter, and she cherished that bond. But she refused to keep anything from the Hamiltons. A blunt return would hurt the older woman, so she chose to express gratitude in her own way.

The deliveryman arrived as Vivian lounged on the couch scrolling through her phone.

She suddenly snorted in derision.

Evelyn glanced up from studying real estate listings. "What's wrong?"

"Nathan York," Vivian growled through clenched teeth. "Just messaged me out of nowhere."

Evelyn shook her head. Their social circles barely overlapped—she knew little about the youngest York heir.

"The Yorks collaborate with Hamilton Group," Vivian said with a dismissive wave. "Haven't spoken in years, and now he's sending me a screenshot of my own social media post."

Evelyn frowned. "Wrong recipient?"

"Probably meant to send it to Alexander." Vivian shook her phone. "Did you block him?"

"Yes."

The day Alexander reverted to his cloud avatar, Evelyn had deleted him without hesitation.

"Figures." Vivian smirked. "Now he's reduced to stalking you through my feed. Classic Nathan—screws up even that."

Evelyn returned to her property research. "Or maybe someone has a crush on you."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Then why panic-delete the message?"

Minutes later, she thrust her phone forward. "See for yourself."

The chat log showed Nathan's awkward greeting after the deleted screenshot.

Vivian cackled. "Worst cover story ever."

Evelyn focused on her tablet's real estate data. Buying a home required thorough research.

"Evelyn." Vivian rested a hand on her shoulder. "Alexander... he still cares about you."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "That 'care' changes nothing. Time will fade it all."

"But the baby—"

"Vivian," Evelyn interrupted, "what exactly did you post earlier?"

"Just a handbag photo." Vivian shrugged. "Nothing related to you."

Evelyn nodded. "Post something new for me."

"Sure." Vivian winked. "Might as well use Nathan as our messenger pigeon."

"Share this address."

"Why?"

"I've signed the divorce papers." Evelyn's voice remained steady. "Two copies. Mailed them to him."

Understanding dawned on Vivian's face.

This was a silent nudge—a reminder for Alexander to sign and return them promptly.

"Got it."
###Chapter 33: Gaze in the Rain

On the last day of her annual leave, Evelyn Carter walked through the hospital gates at dawn. Her body had fully recovered, and her figure remained poised beneath the white coat.

"Good morning, Dr. Carter!"
"You're looking well, Dr. Carter!"

Colleagues greeted her warmly. Only Olivia Lightfoot trailed behind, her eyes flickering with unease.

After rounds, Olivia finally blurted out, "Dr. Carter, are you really going to—"

"The divorce is just one step away." Evelyn calmly organized the medical records. "I'll visit the civil affairs bureau when I have time."

Olivia bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. "But—"

"Get back to work." Evelyn handed her a stack of test forms. "Bed 3's ultrasound results should be ready."

She had ultimately declined the overseas assignment. On the deadline day, the dean personally came to her office.

"Those high-risk pregnancies require continuous monitoring," she explained.

The old dean smiled knowingly. "Just admit you can't bear to leave your husband."

Evelyn simply smiled without further comment.

The following days were unusually hectic. The OB-GYN department was flooded with expectant mothers, surgeries lined up one after another. Evelyn practically lived at the hospital, even eating meals in the on-call room.

Oddly, Olivia kept making trips to the hospital entrance lately.

"Dr. Carter!" She sidled up conspiratorially. "I keep feeling like someone's watching us."

Evelyn didn't look up from her charting. "Cut back on those mystery dramas."

"It's real! That sensation of being stared at—"

"Report it to security." Evelyn finally glanced up. "With recent patient tensions, we need to stay alert."

Evening brought a sudden downpour.

Evelyn stood at the hospital entrance, waiting for a cab. Through the rain, a taxi slowly pulled up before her.

"Sunset Gardens," she gave Vivian Dempsey's address.

The car crawled through traffic. The driver suddenly chuckled. "Look at that guy—drenched like a drowned rat."

Evelyn followed his gaze—

Beside a white Cayenne, Alexander Hamilton stood motionless in the rain. His shirt clung soaked to his skin, water dripping from his hair, yet he seemed oblivious.

Through the curtain of rain, his gaze remained fixed on her.
###Chapter 34: Neither Love Nor Hate

"That man keeps staring at our car," the driver muttered nervously, his grip tightening on the steering wheel.

Evelyn Carter glanced indifferently out the window. "You must be mistaken."

"No, no—he's definitely watching us. I've driven for twenty years without a single accident. I couldn't have scratched his car..."

"Sir, did you see him when you arrived at the hospital?"

"Exactly! He was standing in the rain earlier. Now that we're turning around after picking you up, he's still there getting soaked. What kind of fool does that?"

Evelyn took a deep breath and turned away. "Just focus on driving."

"Oh no—he's coming this way!"

Suddenly, Evelyn despised the perpetually gridlocked traffic outside the hospital.

What was he doing here?

Would he knock on the window and demand answers? Or yank the door open?

What could they possibly say to each other if they met?

They'd already settled everything. Why show up now?

"Can we take a detour?" Her voice tensed slightly.

"Look at this traffic—it's a parking lot. Where would we go?"

The figure drew closer through the rain, heading straight for the taxi.

Evelyn braced herself for the impending awkward confrontation. But then—

Alexander Hamilton walked past their car and approached another taxi on the opposite side. He bent down, opened the door, and carefully shielded the roof with his hand as he helped Annabelle Taylor—her belly swollen with pregnancy—step out.

"Oh, he's just picking up his wife. False alarm."

Amid the chorus of car horns, Evelyn gave a faint, wry smile.

"Miss, what's so funny?"

"Why were you so afraid of him approaching?"

"Didn't you see the look in his eyes? Like he wanted to devour someone. Didn't that unsettle you?"

Evelyn shook her head. "He's not frightening."

Truly, he wasn't. In three years of marriage, she'd never seen Alexander lose his temper.

Except once.

A week ago at Cloud Terrace Resort, she'd stood on the balcony and heard the violent argument from the eighth floor. It was the first time she'd heard him speak with such sharpness—each word a blade, each sentence a strike to the heart.

So it wasn't that he couldn't get angry. It just depended on the person.

With Annabelle, the emotions he'd suppressed for twenty years had finally found release. He resented her—for offering twenty years of friendship only to turn back when he'd already let go.

And as for Evelyn... She'd merely been a placeholder. Without love, there could be no hate.

"Mind if I smoke?" The driver surrendered to the standstill.

Evelyn meant to refuse, but instead said, "Go ahead."

"Thanks."

He lit a cigarette but considerately rolled the window halfway down. The post-rain air, laced with tobacco, drifted in—making the scene outside even clearer.

Alexander supported Annabelle as they walked slowly past. Just as they neared the window, Evelyn abruptly reclined her seat, vanishing into the shadows.
###Chapter 35: Just a Stand-In

Her finger barely touched the window button when regret flooded in.

Cold wind and rain lashed at her face, stinging her eyes.

Why was she hiding?

As a doctor, she'd done everything to save Annabelle's baby. As a wife, she'd stepped aside with dignity to let their love flourish. Through it all, she'd maintained her self-respect.

"Everything alright?" The cab driver glanced at her through the rearview mirror.

"Back pain." She reclined the seat slowly. "Need to lie down."

"Doctors have it rough," the driver sighed. "My daughter's one too. Stands in surgery for twelve hours straight."

The traffic light turned green. Cars began inching forward.

That couple passed right by her window. Alexander held the umbrella at an angle that sheltered Annabelle's pregnant belly completely. Not a single raindrop touched her.

"Your hair's soaked," Alexander's voice carried through the half-open window.

Annabelle tilted her face up with a smile. "Why were you standing in the rain? I spotted you from blocks away."

"We agreed you'd wait at home."

"Wanted to surprise you." She shook the thermal container. "Made you soup. Special delivery."

Alexander took the container, keeping the umbrella steady. "Don't do this again. It's typhoon season."

"Fine—" Annabelle drew out the word, then rose on tiptoes to whisper in his ear.

His expression softened instantly.

Evelyn looked away.

How pathetic.

She'd actually thought that figure in the rain was waiting for her.

"Such a loving couple," the driver remarked. "Rare to see marriages like that nowadays."

Evelyn watched the receding cityscape. "Yes."

The windshield wipers moved rhythmically, wiping away raindrops only for more to fall.

Just like her marriage.

Alexander's tenderness was never meant for her. She'd merely stolen three years by sharing Annabelle's name.

Now that the real one had returned, the stand-in's time was up.

That soup probably smelled delicious. Unlike her attempts—even simple egg drop soup ended up burnt.

The car hit a puddle, spraying water.

In the reflection, the perfect couple shrank into distant specks.
###Chapter 36: So Even the Massage Was for Her

She pressed the seat adjustment button lightly, and the backrest rose slowly. Outside the window, rain fell in slanting threads, blurring the view.

Alexander Hamilton stood under the shade of a tree, his fingertips brushing gently through Annabelle Taylor's hair. He tossed away the soaked tissue, his brow slightly furrowed. "Does your back still hurt today?"

"It's killing me," Annabelle groaned, rubbing her lower back with a pained whimper. "I haven't had a single comfortable day since getting pregnant. Especially on gloomy days like this—it feels like every bone in my body is protesting." Suddenly, her eyes brightened. "Wait, didn't you learn how to massage? Give me one when we get home."

"Alright."

Annabelle tilted her head, a mischievous glint in her eyes. "Alex, you were so busy in your senior year of high school. Why did you take the time to learn massage?" She leaned closer, whispering near his ear, "Was it for me?"

Alexander sighed. "You were always complaining about neck pain back then. With college entrance exams coming up, I couldn’t let you take them with a stiff neck."

"So you really wanted me to go to Peking University with you?" Annabelle blinked playfully.

"You already know the answer."

"But you know my grades. Peking University was a pipe dream for me."

Alexander's gaze softened. "I just wanted you to come to Beijing. I wanted to start a new life there with you."

Annabelle's cheeks flushed pink as she rested her head against his shoulder. "I miss our school days. It's a shame time can't turn back."

"Mhm."

"But it's okay," she wrapped her arms around his waist, her voice muffled against his chest. "We took a long detour, but we still ended up together."

A sharp car horn blared abruptly.

Evelyn Carter covered her ears instinctively. The driver in front slammed his palm against the steering wheel in frustration. "Is the car ahead moving or not? If we stall any longer, we'll be stuck in this traffic forever!"

Finally, the vehicle in front began inching forward. The driver hit the gas, muttering under his breath, "I'm never picking up fares from the hospital again. This place is a black hole for traffic."

"Sorry," Evelyn murmured.

"Not your fault," the driver glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "Next time, try walking to the intersection up ahead to hail a cab."

"Okay."

The driver abruptly changed the subject. "Are you married, miss?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched. "...Sort of."

"In this heavy rain, why didn’t your husband come pick you up?"

The corner of her lips curled into a bitter smile.

"Did you two fight?"

"No," she turned to look out the window. "We never fight."

"That’s a good sign."

Evelyn didn’t respond. Some marriages couldn’t even afford the luxury of arguments.

Sensing her disinterest, the driver tactfully switched topics. "Back pain is nothing to ignore. Have your husband learn some massage techniques—he can help you at home."

Evelyn closed her eyes. She remembered the first time Alexander had massaged her, his skilled hands moving with practiced ease. At the time, she’d been surprised that a man of his status knew such a thing.

Now, it all made sense.

Her phone buzzed suddenly. A string of exclamation marks from Vivian Dempsey lit up the screen: "HELP!!!"

"What’s wrong?"
###Chapter 37: Mrs. Hamilton Is History

Vivian Dempsey's WeChat message arrived abruptly—just a location pin.

After knowing her for years, Evelyn Carter had never seen her this flustered. Vivian was always the epitome of composure. Whatever had rattled her must be serious.

Evelyn immediately hailed a cab. "Tianjie Tower, please."

The scenery blurred past the window as she clutched her phone, her palms damp with sweat.

When she arrived, everything seemed normal. She dialed Vivian's number. "Where are you?"

"Starbucks—first table on the left when you walk in!"

Pushing through the glass door, a blast of cold air hit her. Vivian sat across from a stranger and waved urgently.

"Viv?"

Vivian yanked her close, looping an arm around her waist. "See? Told you I wasn't lying."

Evelyn was lost. "What's going on?"

"Let me handle this." Vivian shot her a look before turning to the man. "Just report back that it's my fault."

The man chuckled, his gaze flickering between them. "Playing games, Miss Dempsey?"

Evelyn pulled free. "Someone explain. Now."

"I'll do it." The man stood, smirking. "Family-set blind date. Miss Dempsey claimed she prefers women and insisted on proving it by bringing her girlfriend."

Evelyn's temple throbbed. She knew Vivian hated setups, but this was extreme.

"We're serious. Not breaking up," Vivian insisted.

The man crossed his arms. "You're not convincing."

"How so?"

"Not sure about her," he said, eyeing Evelyn, "but you? Definitely not into women."

Vivian stiffened. "What makes you say that?"

He laughed. "Mrs. Hamilton—does Alexander know about this hobby of yours?"

The air turned to ice.

Vivian gaped. "You know her?"

"The lounge bar. Your reunion." He tapped his temple. "I even picked up your phone."

Recognition flashed. "You're Alexander's college friend?"

A sharp pain stabbed her abdomen. She doubled over, clutching her stomach.

"What's wrong?" Vivian steadied her.

"Probably... ran too fast..."

"You just had surgery!" Vivian's voice shook.

The man's expression darkened. "An abortion? Does Alex know?"

"He does." Her face was ghostly pale.

"Then you two—"

"Divorced." She lifted her chin with a faint smile. "Call me Dr. Carter from now on."
###Chapter 38: Alexander's Package

Vivian frowned at Evelyn's pale complexion and went to fetch a cup of hot water from the counter.

"Drink this to warm your stomach." She pressed the cup into Evelyn's hands. "Let's go to the hospital."

Evelyn forced herself to stand and followed Vivian out of the café.

Once in the car, Vivian fastened her seatbelt and prepared to turn around.

"Not the hospital." Evelyn stopped her.

"Look at how pale you are. Stop being stubborn."

"I'm an OB-GYN doctor."

Vivian paused, then chuckled. "Right. No resident could match your expertise."

"Just take me home."

"Are you sure you don't need the hospital?"

"Yeah."

Vivian sighed and started the engine. "At least let me stop by a pharmacy for medicine."

Evelyn gazed out the window at the passing scenery. "Alexander and Annabelle are at the hospital."

Vivian's grip on the steering wheel tightened. She didn't insist further.

"Stomachache?"

"Probably caught a chill from the rain."

Vivian drove straight home without stopping.

Half an hour later, a deliveryman arrived with stomach medicine and painkillers.

Evelyn took the pills and drifted into a heavy sleep.

Late at night, her phone buzzed, startling her awake.

"Miss Carter, your package has arrived."

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "I didn't order anything."

"There are several items, all addressed to you with your contact number."

She suddenly became alert.

The recent name confusion had left her so tense she'd forgotten basic logic.

The doorbell rang.

A deliveryman stood at the door with a large cardboard box. "Miss Carter, please sign for this."

Vivian emerged from the bedroom, rubbing her eyes. "What did you buy in the middle of the night?"

"I didn't."

Together, they carried the box inside.

Vivian swiftly tore open the packaging. "A hairdryer, towels, an umbrella..." She froze. "This bag..."

Evelyn stared at the familiar design, her fingers trembling slightly.

"It's identical to the one you carried today?" Vivian sounded puzzled. "Who could be this thoughtful—"

"Alexander." Evelyn whispered.

He had seen her at the hospital entrance after all.
###Chapter 39: Awakening After the Shattered Marriage

Evelyn Carter dragged her exhausted body to Vivian Dempsey's apartment.

She had only packed a few changes of clothes and a small purse, not even her daily skincare products.

During the downpour, she held a cloth bag over her head, but still got drenched. Water droplets slid down her cheeks—whether rain or tears, she couldn’t tell.

The cheap bag was now soaked and misshapen, unusable by tomorrow.

Alexander Hamilton had sent her a new bag, identical to the old one, down to the worn edges. She didn’t want to know how he found it or why he bothered.

Vivian shook the gift box. "Same as before—return it?"

"Just throw it away."

"No return this time?" Vivian raised an eyebrow.

"Returning it would just give Annabelle another excuse to stir trouble." Evelyn rubbed her temples. "I don’t want anything to do with them anymore."

Vivian scoffed. "That Annabelle is clearly trouble."

Deep down, Evelyn knew what truly hurt her was Alexander’s choice. Annabelle was just the catalyst that sped up the collapse of her marriage.

Together, they carried the box downstairs and tossed it into the trash bin. Evelyn snapped a photo and sent it to Vivian.

"Post it? How about the caption 'Screw your pity'?" Vivian grinned.

"No words. The picture speaks for itself."

The moment Vivian posted it, Nathan York’s like popped up.

"Does this guy live on social media?" Vivian muttered.

Evelyn checked the time. "Delete it."

"So soon?"

"The right person has already seen it."

Vivian’s eyes widened in realization. "Brilliant. You’re drawing the line for good."

"I just want my life back." Evelyn gazed at the night outside.

Those three years of marriage had been an elaborate lie. She thought she’d found true love, that her mother-in-law treated her like a daughter.

Only when the truth came out did she realize she was merely a supporting character in Alexander and Annabelle’s love story. Her existence was just to highlight their "unbreakable bond."

The next day during rounds, Olivia Lightfoot sidled up to her, whispering, "Dr. Carter, guess who I saw last night on duty?"

Evelyn flipped through charts without looking up. "Hmm?"

"Your ex-husband brought his mistress for a prenatal checkup!" Olivia stomped her foot indignantly.

"I know."

"You knew?!" Olivia gaped. "He actually told you? Don’t tell me he expects you to deliver her baby!"

Evelyn tapped Olivia’s head with the chart. "Don’t be ridiculous."

"Good." Olivia exhaled. "But how did you find out?"

"Check their next appointment for me."

Olivia quickly pulled up the records. "Every Saturday morning."

Evelyn nodded and went to adjust her shift schedule with the scheduling coordinator.

She thought this would keep her far away from those two—but fate had other plans.

That afternoon, she ran into Alexander again in the hospital hallway.
###Chapter 40: The Scheme in the Pear Soup

Sunlight slanted into the examination room as Evelyn Carter finished seeing off a patient. When she looked up, Alexander Hamilton was helping Annabelle Taylor inside.

Annabelle's pregnancy was unmistakable now, her rounded belly visible beneath the loose maternity dress. Her face had filled out since their last meeting, her skin glowing with health—clear signs of being well cared for.

Alexander stood beside her, one hand hovering protectively at the small of her back while the other carried an insulated bag. His gaze darted away the moment it met Evelyn's, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Olivia Lightfoot muttered under her breath, "Again?"

Annabelle settled into the chair across from Evelyn with a gentle smile. "Dr. Carter, long time no see."

Evelyn didn't respond, pulling up her medical records instead. "What seems to be the problem?"

"Nothing's wrong," Annabelle said, stroking her belly. "I just had a prenatal checkup last night. The baby's perfectly healthy."

"Then why are you—"

"I came to apologize." Annabelle cut her off, retrieving an elegant thermal container from the bag. "I made this pear soup myself. It's excellent for the throat."

Alexander spoke abruptly, "That's enough."

Annabelle ignored him. "The things Alexander sent you were so thoughtless. I already scolded him." She shot him a glare before turning back to Evelyn. "Gifts should be something the recipient actually needs. What use does a doctor have for umbrellas and hair dryers?"

Evelyn's fingers paused on the keyboard.

So that's how it was.

Her eyes flicked to Alexander, whose face had gone ashen, a vein pulsing at his temple.

"I've paid the consultation fee," Annabelle said, placing her medical card on the desk. "Fifteen dollars should buy us some conversation time, no?"

A child's wail echoed from the hallway, followed by impatient催促 from a parent.

Evelyn closed the file. "Are you finished?"

"Not quite." Annabelle lowered her voice. "I heard you've been dating lately? Alexander was so worried when he found out—afraid you'd just marry anyone..."

"Annabelle!" Alexander seized her wrist. "Time to go."

She shook him off. "What's the rush?" Her smile turned knowing as she addressed Evelyn. "Dr. Carter, out with the old, in with the new—wouldn't you agree?"

The sickly sweet aroma of pear soup wafted from the container.

Evelyn rose slowly. "Next patient."
###Chapter 41: To Add or Not to Add

Seeing Alexander Hamilton remain silent, Annabelle Taylor finally turned around with a gentle smile. "Don't take it to heart, Dr. Carter. Alex has always been like this since childhood—always worrying about others. It often leads to misunderstandings. Please don’t mind it."

"Misunderstandings?"

"Yes. Girls tend to think he’s interested in them." Annabelle's eyes curved into crescents. "Back in school, he once lent his umbrella to a girl who forgot hers. She misunderstood his kindness and wasted years pining for him. Such a pity, don’t you think?"

Evelyn Carter let out a quiet chuckle.

"Dr. Carter, I hope you understand what I’m trying to say."

"Crystal clear."

"Good. It’s always easier talking to someone intelligent."

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "Are you done, Miss Taylor?"

"Almost."

"Then please leave. My next patient is waiting."

Annabelle stood but pushed the thermal container forward. "Drink the pear soup while it’s hot. It loses its effect when cold."

Evelyn smirked. "You should be saying that to Mr. Hamilton. Tell him to hurry up with signing the divorce papers."

Annabelle immediately feigned hurt. "Oh, Dr. Carter, you’ve misunderstood! I just wanted to bring you something soothing for your lungs. I wasn’t rushing the divorce."

"Whether you were or not, you know the truth."

Alexander reached for Annabelle’s arm. "Let’s go."

She jerked away and sat back down.

Evelyn raised a brow. "Something else?"

Annabelle smiled, resting a hand on her stomach. "Dr. Carter, could we exchange WeChat contacts?"

"Unnecessary."

"It’s my first pregnancy, and after the scare we had, I’m terrified. If anything happens, I’d like to reach you quickly."

Evelyn took a deep breath and leaned back in her chair. "You live five minutes from the hospital."

Annabelle brightened. "Right! Pregnancy brain—they say it lasts three years. We’re staying in that apartment now, so close to the hospital."

"Anything else?"

"Let’s add each other. You saved this baby’s life. I’d love for you to attend the first-month celebration. It’ll be easier to coordinate."

Evelyn turned to Alexander. "Your firstborn?"

His face darkened, unable to meet her eyes.

Annabelle had already extended her phone with the QR code displayed. "Just scan it, Dr. Carter."

Evelyn stared at her. "I don’t add strangers."

Annabelle’s smile faded, her tone turning edged. "But hospital policy allows patients to add their doctors. You wouldn’t violate regulations, would you?"

Evelyn scoffed. How observant—even quoting hospital rules now.
###Chapter 42: Destiny's Design

"Okay."

Her fingertip lightly tapped the screen, accepting Annabelle's friend request.

Annabelle's profile picture was unmistakably Alexander's side profile. The man in the photo wore a blue-and-white school uniform, his brows still carrying the sharpness of youth, yet already hinting at the refined elegance he would grow into.

Her WeChat nickname read: "Missing Xi."

Longing for Alexander?

Or unable to forget Alexander?

Evelyn locked her phone and shoved it back into her white coat pocket.

"Did you see my profile picture?" Annabelle's smile was loaded with meaning. "Couple avatars are so tacky. Why not just use each other's photos? Even though we're thirty now, when we're together, we still act like silly high schoolers..."

Alexander suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Let's go."

"Wait." Evelyn spoke up.

He froze mid-step, his brow furrowing. "Evelyn, I'm sorry."

"Take your things with you."

She pointed at the thermal container on the desk. "Hospital policy prohibits accepting gifts from patients."

Olivia swiftly snatched the container and shoved it into Alexander's arms, pushing both of them out the door. "Next patient!"

The door slammed shut.

Olivia rolled her eyes at the closed door. "Since when do mistresses flaunt themselves so brazenly?"

Evelyn cleared her throat in warning.

But the pregnant patient currently being examined asked with keen interest, "Do you get a lot of dramatic situations like this in OB-GYN?"

Olivia immediately perked up. "Oh, you have no idea. Our department has more drama than a soap opera."

"Olivia."

"Well, it's true."

By six in the evening, patients were still waiting outside the clinic.

Evelyn worked an extra half hour to see them all.

In the parking lot, Vivian impatiently honked the horn. "Hurry up! We'll lose our reservation!"

"Where are we going?"

"Get in first."

Only after they'd left the hospital did Vivian reveal they were heading to a viral restaurant.

Evelyn scrolled through her phone with little interest.

Her social media feed was flooded with Annabelle's posts.

The latest update read: "Destiny always brings us back to where we began."

The accompanying photo showed a high school graduation picture. Only Annabelle and Alexander's faces were clearly visible—every other classmate had been blurred out.

The comments section overflowed with congratulatory messages.

"Is she doing this on purpose?" Vivian glanced at the screen. "You actually added her?"

"Hospital policy."

Vivian snorted. "How convenient."
###Chapter 43: No Words Left

Annabelle had clearly planned this for a while.

The moment Evelyn accepted her friend request, her social media feed flooded like a broken dam.

In just minutes, nine wedding photos, nine traditional gowns, nine candy favor designs, and nine invitation mockups bombarded the screen.

The caption read: Can’t decide! Help me choose!

Evelyn scoffed and muted her updates without hesitation.

Vivian parked outside the trendy restaurant.

It was barely past six, but the line already stretched across the street.

"Wait here. I’ll grab snacks to tide us over," Vivian said before darting off.

Evelyn sighed at the endless queue. "This is ridiculous."

Her phone buzzed—Olivia’s name flashed on the screen.

"Dr. Carter! Come back to the hospital—it’s an emergency!"

The familiar black sedan sat idle outside the hospital entrance.

Alexander stood under the streetlamp, the ember of his cigarette flickering. The dim light elongated his tall frame, casting a lonely shadow.

His head snapped up, eyes locking onto her instantly.

He crushed the cigarette and strode forward.

Evelyn quickened her pace, but he seized her wrist. "Evelyn!"

The scent of tobacco and alcohol hit her.

"You’ve been drinking?"

His Adam’s apple bobbed. "Business dinner."

"Drunk driving is illegal."

"...I know."

She yanked her arm free. "Let go. I have patients to save."

"Five minutes."

"They don’t have five minutes."

His grip loosened. "I’ll wait."

She didn’t look back. "Don’t bother."

Olivia’s voice echoed from the entrance. "Dr. Carter! The patient’s hemorrhaging!"

Evelyn shook him off. "Mr. Hamilton, let’s end this cleanly. Yesterday you sent gifts, today Annabelle flaunts her wedding plans. If she finds you here harassing me, will she storm the hospital tomorrow for another scene?"

Alexander paled. "I’m sorry—"

"Disappearing would be apology enough."

Her white coat swirled as she sprinted toward the ER.

Olivia hurried after her. "He’s been standing there since afternoon. Like a statue."

Evelyn fastened the last button on her coat. "Focus on saving lives."
###Chapter 44: She Has Better Things to Do

The night deepened, the hospital corridor bathed in harsh fluorescent light.

Alexander Hamilton leaned against the wall, the cigarette between his fingers burned down to the filter. He checked his watch—the hour hand pointed to eleven.

"Is Dr. Carter still here?" He stopped a nurse rushing past.

The nurse paused, eyes above her mask flickering with confusion. "Dr. Carter? She left after seven."

"I heard there was an emergency surgery."

"Oh, the ectopic pregnancy case?" The nurse nodded. "The surgery went smoothly. Dr. Carter left right after."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "I've been waiting since six. I didn't see her leave."

The nurse gestured toward the end of the hallway. "The ER has a separate exit. She probably took that route."

He froze.

She’d rather take the long way than walk past him.

The nurse studied him curiously. "Did you need something from Dr. Carter?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "The ectopic pregnancy patient... was it life-threatening?"

"Nearly bled out," the nurse murmured. "They had to remove one fallopian tube."

"Must have been painful."

The nurse sighed. "What do you think? Ruptured blood vessels, losing half her blood volume—of course it hurt."

On the drive home, streetlights cast fractured shadows across the windshield.

He remembered seeing Evelyn outside the hospital that day.

She’d been pale as paper, lips bloodless, barely standing without Vivian’s support.

So that was the pain she’d been hiding.

The moment he opened the door, the greasy scent of fried chicken assaulted him.

Annabelle Taylor sat cross-legged on the sofa, takeout containers littering the coffee table. The raucous laughter of a variety show blared through the living room.

"You're back late." She didn’t look up. "Seeing Evelyn again?"

Alexander loosened his tie. "She wouldn’t seek me out."

Annabelle licked sauce off her fingers with a scoff. "Playing hard to get? Please. She’s just after your money."

His gaze swept over the disaster zone—chip crumbs embedded in cushions, cola stains dried on the leather.

"This is why you insisted on a leather sofa?"

"Easy cleanup." She shrugged. "Just wipe it down."

"Stop eating on the couch."

"Make me." She tilted her chin up. "I’ve always done this. Why complain now?"

He turned toward the bedroom.

"Wait!" Annabelle sprang up, greasy fingers clutching his sleeve. "Watch TV with me!"

"I'm tired."

"You used to skip class for amusement parks," she shrilled. "Now you won’t even sit through a show? Did Evelyn poison you against me?"

"This isn’t about her."

"Liar!" She made a grab for his phone. "She saw me at the hospital today—I bet she tattled! Let me check!"

Alexander seized her wrist, voice glacial. "Annabelle, drop it. Evelyn wants nothing to do with us. Stop dragging her into this."
###Chapter 45: The Price of Saving a Life

Evelyn's fingertips trembled.

She stared into Alexander's eyes with unyielding intensity. "You lied to me."

Alexander turned his face away, water droplets sliding from his hair onto his bathrobe. "Stop this."

"Give me your phone!"

She lunged at him, her nails scraping his cheek. Alexander instinctively stepped back, but she seized the chance to shove her hand into his trouser pocket. The greasy sensation made him grimace, yet he didn't dare push her away forcefully.

The bathroom door slammed shut.

Hot water cascaded over his body, but it couldn't wash away the radiant smile etched in his mind. The way Evelyn had leaped from the taxi earlier, clad in her white coat, mirrored their first encounter three years ago.

Back then, she had sprinted just as desperately to save a patient.

Alexander's fist struck the tiled wall.

He had wanted her to move on, to be happy. But now that she truly had, the feeling of being utterly forgotten gnawed at his heart like a venomous serpent.

A month ago, her signature on the surgical consent form had been resolute.

"Mr. Hamilton, please sign."

She hadn't even glanced at him.

In the steam, he saw her again—standing at the operating room doors, pale as paper after her abortion, yet insisting on checking Annabelle's condition.

"I'm a doctor."

With those words, she had dragged her weakened body into the ward.

Alexander would never forget the way she staggered as she turned away. She had saved Annabelle, but in doing so, she had ended their child's life.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The violent knocking shattered his memories.

"Come out!" Annabelle's voice was shrill, piercing. "Now! Immediately!"

Before he could fasten his robe, his phone was thrust into his face. Her crimson nails nearly punctured the screen. "Explain this! Why is your gallery filled with her photos?!"

In the image, Evelyn was making her rounds, sunlight streaming through the window behind her. Last Wednesday, he had followed her all day, driven by some inexplicable compulsion.

"Delete them! All of them!" Annabelle's scream bordered on hysteria. "She doesn't want you anymore! What are you clinging to?!"

Exhaustion crashed over Alexander.

He remembered how Evelyn's hair had caught the wind this afternoon as she jumped from the taxi—vibrant, luminous, as though untouched by pain.

But he knew the wound would never heal.

Just as the scalpel that saved Annabelle hadn't just opened a patient's abdomen—it had severed the last thread between them.

"Say something!" Annabelle hurled the phone against his chest. "Do you even know how well she's doing now? Vivian said she's applied for an exchange program in England!"

Alexander's head snapped up.

On the bathroom mirror, droplets of condensation trembled, then slid silently downward.

###Chapter 46 It's Already a Marriage Affair.
Alexander Hamilton's gaze fell on his phone screen, his brow instantly furrowing.

An unfamiliar interface displayed a progress bar already at 96%.

"Did you touch my phone?" His voice turned icy.

Annabelle Taylor casually shook her head. "Just looking. Why so tense?"

"What exactly did you do?"

"Cleaning up your trash contacts." She snatched the phone from him. "Almost done."

His expression darkened. "What did you delete?"

"What else?" She smirked. "Evelyn Carter's contact. You're getting divorced. Why keep her on WeChat?"

He inhaled sharply, suppressing his anger. "This is my personal property."

"Yours? Mine?" She lifted her chin defiantly. "We're getting married soon. What's yours is mine. Keeping your ex's number—what are you planning?"

His knuckles whitened. "Annabelle, you've crossed a line."

"I'm doing this for you!" Her voice rose sharply. "Do you know what the nurses say behind your back? That you can't let go of the past!"

"What have I done to lose your trust?"

"You visit the hospital daily. Think I'm stupid?" She waved her own phone. "If I hadn't installed tracking, I'd never know."

His eyes locked onto the blinking red dot on her screen. The absurdity struck him.

"You're spying on me?"

"It's called caring!" She jutted her chin. "If I didn't love you, why bother?"

The phone vibrated. The progress bar hit 100%.

"Done." She triumphantly raised it. "No ties left."

He grabbed it back, frantically checking his contacts. Evelyn's name had vanished—all calls and messages wiped.

"She's still hospitalized. What if there's an emergency—"

"Spare me." She cut him off. "Plenty of doctors there. You just can't move on!"

He closed his eyes, voice hoarse. "Twenty years of friendship, and this is how you see me?"

"I—" She faltered, then hardened. "No contact. If you reach out to her, I'll—"

"You'll what?"

Her lips curled unnervingly. "Tell everyone she came between us. Her reputation's already ruined—one more scandal won't matter."

His head snapped up, shock flashing in his eyes. "You're insane."

"Fighting for my love." She pressed closer, voice sickly sweet. "Alexander, we finally have our chance. Don't disappoint me."

After a long silence, he rubbed his temples wearily. "Delete the tracking app."

"No!"

"Delete it, or we're done." Quiet but final.

Her eyes widened. "You'd choose her over me?"

"For the last shred of trust between us." He held her gaze. "No respect means nothing left to say."

Her lips trembled, tears welling. After a searing glare, she grabbed her purse and stormed out.

The door slammed violently.

Alexander slid to the floor, staring at his phone. Annabelle's digital footprint remained.

Where Evelyn's number once was—now only garbled code.
###Chapter 47: Love Means Obedience

"I factory reset your phone." Annabelle Taylor waved the device with a triumphant smirk. "Now there won't be any traces of her left."

Alexander Hamilton's head snapped up. "How dare you?"

"Because I'm your girlfriend." She tilted her head, her gaze both innocent and cruel. "I checked. You've been good—no evidence of lingering attachments."

He snatched the phone back, frantically pressing the power button.

The screen lit up. The progress bar showed 95%.

"Don't bother," Annabelle leaned against the desk, enjoying his panic. "It's almost done."

98%. 99%. 100%.

The phone rebooted—blank.

Alexander's fingers froze mid-air.

"Happy?" She moved closer. "Now you won't repeat past mistakes. Just like how you kept my photos, holding onto her things would only make you nostalgic."

"That was my work phone!" His voice shook. "It had important files! Client data! Project updates!"

Annabelle waved a dismissive hand. "Let your secretary handle it."

"Do you know how long that will take?"

"Then make her work overtime." She blinked. "She's paid for this. Deduct her salary until she's scared of failing."

He took a deep breath. "Emily has three children to care for."

"Fire her then." Suddenly, Annabelle wrapped her arms around his waist. "I'm jealous. No other woman should be near you."

"She's been with me for eight years!"

"So what?" She looked up stubbornly. "If you love me, you'll obey me."

Alexander tried to push her away. "Be careful—your stomach—"

"I won't let go until you agree!" She tightened her grip. "Fire her tomorrow. Promise?"

Silence.

Outside the window, the setting sun stretched their intertwined shadows into a silent battle.
###Chapter 48: Dawn of a New Life

By the time Evelyn Carter heard news about Alexander Hamilton again, the plane trees outside her window had sprouted fresh buds.

Vivian Dempsey burst into the examination room like a whirlwind while Evelyn was performing a prenatal checkup for an expectant mother. Seeing her friend mysteriously close the door behind her, Evelyn nearly dropped the fetal doppler. "Don't tell me you're—"

"Get your mind out of the gutter!" Vivian patted her flat stomach and leaned in conspiratorially. "I'm here with juicy gossip."

Evelyn exhaled in relief and resumed organizing the medical records. "What gossip is worth making an actual appointment for?"

"The Hamilton Group is in chaos lately." Vivian lowered her voice. "Annabelle Taylor stormed into the office and forced Alexander's chief secretary to resign."

Evelyn's hands stilled briefly. "Emily Zade?"

"Exactly. The one who'd worked for Alexander for eight years." Vivian scoffed. "Annabelle accused her of seducing Alexander and made such a scene—flaunting her pregnancy and everything—that Emily ended up quitting."

Evelyn remembered the poised woman who always wore tailored suits. Emily had been instrumental in organizing her and Alexander's wedding, even hand-selecting their wedding favors.

"But here's the kicker," Vivian continued. "Annabelle installed her useless cousin Andy Taylor as the replacement. The idiot lost a crucial contract, costing the Hamiltons a nine-figure deal."

Evelyn quietly closed the medical file. Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting dappled patterns across her serene expression.

She hadn't thought much about Alexander this past month.

The OB-GYN department was always brimming with hope. Delivering newborns daily and witnessing new parents' tearful joy gave her a long-missing sense of fulfillment. After work, she'd sweat it out at the gym. On weekends, she experimented with new baking recipes. Her life was simple yet satisfying.

"Evelyn, aren't you even angry?" Vivian couldn't help asking.

Evelyn looked up, a faint smile on her lips. "I'm happy with my life now."

A newborn's cry echoed through the hallway outside—clear and vibrant. Evelyn gazed out the window where spring sunlight warmed everything it touched.

Those old wounds were like winter ice, destined to melt away when spring arrived.
###Chapter 49: The Scapegoat

Evelyn Carter rubbed her temples and closed the medical chart.

The hospital workload had surged recently, leaving her no time to dwell on anything else. The names Alexander Hamilton and Annabelle Taylor hadn’t crossed her mind in a long while.

"He chose his own path. If he thinks it’s worth it, then so be it."

"Worth it?" Vivian Dempsey scoffed. "Alexander is drowning in regret. You have no idea—he’s become the laughingstock of our social circle..."

Evelyn raised a hand to stop her. "There are patients waiting outside. We’ll talk later."

Vivian finally realized she’d overstayed her welcome and awkwardly stood. "I’ll wait in your office."

It wasn’t until 7:30 PM that Evelyn dragged her exhausted body back to her office.

Vivian immediately approached. "Finally done?"

Evelyn pressed a hand to her lower back, her face pale. "Sorry to keep you waiting so long."

"Since when do we stand on ceremony?" Vivian frowned, steadying her. "What’s wrong with your back?"

"...My period."

Vivian’s eyes widened in realization. "Is this... the first one since the miscarriage?"

Evelyn gave a slight nod, her gaze dimming for a fleeting moment.

A heavy silence settled over the office.

"Weren’t you going to share some gossip?" Evelyn forced a smile, leaning back in her chair. "Go ahead. I’m listening."

Vivian studied her with concern. "Are you sure you’re okay?"

"I’m fine. It’s a good distraction."

Only then did Vivian launch into her story.

"Hamilton Group lost another few million recently."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Andy Taylor again?"

"This time it’s even more outrageous." Vivian’s lips curled into a sardonic smile. "That idiot drove Alexander’s car drunk and killed a traffic officer."

Evelyn bolted upright. "What?"

"And here’s the kicker," Vivian lowered her voice, "Annabelle told Alexander to take the blame."

Evelyn’s pupils constricted. "Is she insane?"

"The reasoning was even crazier." Vivian mimicked Annabelle’s tone. "'The car is registered under your name anyway—as the owner, you’re legally responsible. Besides, the Hamiltons have influence. If you confess, you might not even serve time. Just pay some fines and it’ll blow over.'"

Evelyn was speechless. "Alexander agreed to this?"
###Chapter 50: Time Heals All Wounds

"I can't believe Alexander Hamilton would stoop this low. The man's a business genius, yet he's making such a foolish mistake."

Evelyn Carter stirred her coffee absently. "Maybe it's true love."

Vivian Dempsey rolled her eyes. "What does Annabelle Taylor even have? How dare she make such outrageous demands? It's humiliating!"

Evelyn took a sip. "A willing victim."

"Rumor has it your ex-mother-in-law fainted from rage. The whole social circle is buzzing about it!"

"...Mm."

"That's all you have to say? Come on, let's celebrate at that viral restaurant. We missed it last time—today's the day."

Evelyn shook her head. "Too crowded. Anywhere else is fine."

Vivian dragged her up anyway. "No way! I've been craving their food forever!"

Seeing Evelyn's stomach pain had eased, Vivian shoved her into the car and even buckled her seatbelt.

Noticing Evelyn's frown, Vivian winked. "Relax, I’m never dating. This seat is yours forever."

Evelyn chuckled.

She almost regretted telling Vivian everything about Annabelle.

Vivian never held back. "She’s the definition of a manipulative schemer! You should’ve put her in her place back then."

Evelyn gazed out the window silently.

What would it have changed?

Alexander would’ve defended Annabelle anyway.

No point in humiliating herself.

Vivian sighed in frustration. "You always care about being dignified. The divorce was clean, but you’re the one who got hurt. Meanwhile, they’re probably living it up."

"Is he happy now?"

"Of course—" Vivian paused. "Well, he was. But with the company taking such a hit, who knows? Men don’t handle career setbacks well."

Evelyn opened the financial news for the first time in weeks.

She’d deliberately avoided anything about Alexander this past month.

Time really was the best medicine.

Seeing his name now stirred nothing in her.

The headline was brief: Hamilton Group CEO Alexander Hamilton Faces Trial for Fatal Drunk Driving Incident.

"Vivian, if the Hamiltons paid millions in compensation, will he still go to jail?"

"I’ll ask around and let you know."

"Don’t—" Evelyn hesitated. "Actually, yes. Tell me."

Vivian scowled. "You still care about him?"

"I just need to know how it affects the divorce paperwork."

Vivian burst out laughing. "Now that sounds like the Evelyn I know."
###Chapter 51: Evelyn, Don't Flatter Yourself

Evelyn Carter and Vivian Dempsey had agreed to meet at this newly opened Italian restaurant.

"I'll get the queue number. You find us a seat," Vivian said before pushing through the crowd.

The restaurant was lavishly decorated with Baroque-style domes and crystal chandeliers. Renaissance-era oil painting replicates adorned the walls. A pumpkin carriage parked at the entrance drew a line of young women waiting to take photos.

Evelyn had just settled into an empty seat when a commotion erupted nearby.

"How rude can young people be these days? Don't they know pregnant women get priority?"

The shrill voice made Evelyn freeze.

She turned and saw Annabelle Taylor—her slightly rounded belly protruding—berating a schoolgirl in uniform. Standing behind her was Alexander Hamilton.

He'd lost weight. His suit jacket hung loosely on his frame. The spot where he used to wear sleeve garters was now bare, the cuffs drooping limply.

"That's enough," Alexander said, frowning as he tried to pull her away.

Annabelle shook him off. "I'm going to teach these brats some manners today!"

The girl's eyes reddened as she defended herself, "This isn't a bus..."

"Public spaces require courtesy! And why were you hovering near my husband? Can't you see he's married?"

"I wasn't!"

"I saw you taking pictures of him!"

The girl, speechless, covered her face and fled—bumping into Evelyn on her way out.

"Sorry..." The girl sobbed as she ran off.

"Evelyn..."

Without looking back, Evelyn disappeared into the crowd.

The restaurant was packed, swallowing her within seconds. Alexander's voice drowned in the noise—if he'd even called her name at all.

Evelyn smiled bitterly.

When she returned to the waiting area, her seat had been taken. Vivian came back with their queue number, confused. "Where's our spot?"

"Just now—"

"I know!" A ponytailed girl nearby cut in. "Was it that pregnant woman bullying the schoolgirl? We all saw it!"

Her boyfriend nodded. "She went ballistic over nothing. The girl just took a photo, and she accused her of hitting on her husband."

"Exactly!" The ponytailed girl huffed. "Okay, the guy's handsome, but that doesn't mean every girl wants him. Pregnancy doesn't give you a free pass to be awful."

Vivian blinked. "That intense?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze and murmured, "Yeah."
###Chapter 52: First Love Drama

Vivian blinked. "Didn't that girl know he was married?"

"Apparently not! His pregnant wife was waiting for a table while he went to get their number. The girl only found out after taking the photo. She deleted it immediately and even apologized to his wife. Very polite about it."

"So it was resolved?"

"The pregnant woman wouldn't let it go! She chased the girl all the way from the restaurant entrance to the pumpkin carriage, accusing her of seducing her husband. The girl kept trying to avoid her, but the wife threw a tantrum, playing the victim card..."

Vivian scoffed. "Seriously?"

The short-haired girl suddenly pointed at Evelyn. "Hey, that girl looked just like you!"

Her boyfriend added, "Same innocent campus vibe."

"Exactly!" The girl gestured excitedly. "Ponytail, simple outfit—total good-girl energy..."

Vivian burst out laughing. "Now I get why that pregnant woman lost it. If my husband got photographed by someone that pretty, I'd freak out too."

Evelyn lightly swatted her arm. "Don't be ridiculous."

"I mean it!" Vivian leaned in. "Remember how many guys had crushes on you in high school? Too intimidated to make a move."

Evelyn shook her head. "You were top of the class too."

"Not the same!" Vivian rolled her eyes. "The guy who pursued me only wanted connections through my family."

Just then, another commotion erupted near the restaurant entrance.

The boyfriend craned his neck. "It's that pregnant woman again!"

Vivian perked up, dragging Evelyn toward the crowd. "Let's check it out!"

Evelyn's ponytail swayed as sunlight from the glass ceiling haloed her silhouette.

"Coming through—" Vivian weaved through the gathering.

A visibly pregnant woman was shrieking at a girl in a white dress. "Stop pretending to be innocent!"

The girl stood with her back turned—slender frame, high ponytail. From behind, the resemblance to Evelyn was uncanny.

The woman suddenly yanked at the girl's bag. "Hand over your phone! You must've saved his photo!"

"I already deleted it..." The girl's voice trembled.

Vivian gasped. "Even her voice sounds like yours..."

Evelyn frowned, stepping forward—until a deep voice roared, "Enough!"

A tall, strikingly handsome man shielded the girl.

The pregnant woman instantly switched tones, whimpering as she clung to him. "Honey, she was taking pictures of you—"

He pushed her away. "You've humiliated yourself enough. She apologized!"

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

Vivian gaped, tugging Evelyn's sleeve. "This is juicier than a soap opera!"
###Chapter 53: He's Not the Only Man in the World

Vivian Dempsey gripped Evelyn Carter's wrist, pushing through the dense crowd.

"Excuse me! Move aside, please!"

Evelyn stumbled, nearly colliding with a passerby.

"Vivian, slow down—"

"Slow down? The show'll be over by then!" Vivian didn’t look back, charging forward.

When she finally saw the two people arguing outside the restaurant, she skidded to a stop.

"Holy—" Her eyes widened as she turned to Evelyn. "This is the 'show' you meant?"

Evelyn gave a small nod.

Vivian scoffed. "What’s Alexander Hamilton playing at? Didn’t he love Annabelle Taylor for twenty years? Now he can’t resist someone who just vaguely resembles you?"

Annabelle’s shrill voice cut through the restaurant’s noise.

"What kind of service is this?! Don’t you see I’m pregnant?!"

The young waiter bowed his head, clutching a queue ticket. "Ma’am, we’ve already arranged a sofa for you—"

"A sofa won’t feed me! I’m starving!" Annabelle slapped the ticket out of his hand. "I’m reporting this place!"

Murmurs rippled through the waiting crowd.

"Who does she think she is?"

"Some lawyer. Thinks being pregnant means she can skip the line."

"Two hours we’ve waited. Being a lawyer doesn’t make her special."

A young mother holding her baby whispered, "This place specializes in seafood. Pregnant women shouldn’t even be here..."

Alexander stood nearby, his expression dark. He reached for Annabelle’s arm. "Annabelle, let’s just go somewhere else—"

"No! I’m eating here today!"

Her gaze suddenly locked onto Evelyn in the crowd.

"Well, if it isn’t Dr. Carter?" Annabelle smirked, raising her voice. "What a coincidence. Or did you follow us here?"

Alexander whipped around. The moment he saw Evelyn, he froze.

Vivian immediately stepped in front of Evelyn. "Get over yourself! You don’t own this place. Are you the only ones allowed to eat here?"

Annabelle narrowed her eyes. "Someone’s defensive. Could it be—" She glanced pointedly at Alexander.

"Vivian, let’s go," Evelyn said softly.

"Go? No way!" Vivian planted her hands on her hips. "We’re eating here tonight! Waiter, get us a number!"

The waiter practically threw the ticket at her in relief.

Annabelle’s face twisted. "Alexander! Are you just going to let them—"

But Alexander’s eyes stayed fixed on Evelyn, words caught in his throat.

Vivian snorted, pulling Evelyn away. "Some people really think they’re the center of the universe. News flash—he’s not the only man in the world."
###Chapter 54: Who Gave You That Idea?

Annabelle's laughter was shrill and grating, like nails on a chalkboard. "Dr. Carter, why pretend to be so noble? Just admit you can't let go of Alexander."

"Where did you get the idea that I can't?"

Evelyn's voice was soft, but sharp as a scalpel.

She had never been one for arguments, but she wasn't a pushover either.

This was the first time she had ever shown Annabelle her edge.

Annabelle faltered for a moment before lifting her chin defiantly. "Stop pretending. I heard you were trying to buy a house. Did you manage it?"

"..."

"Couldn't afford it, could you?" Annabelle sneered. "With that salary of yours, you probably couldn't even scrape together a down payment. Where are you living now? Under a bridge?"

Evelyn met her gaze calmly. "No need to worry. I have friends."

"Oh, so you're mooching off someone." Annabelle dragged out her words mockingly. "And now you're here to cry to Alexander about it?"

"I earn my own living."

"Then why are you here?" Annabelle's voice rose sharply. "Trying to relive the past?"

"Enough!" Alexander's face darkened. "Are you done making a scene?"

Annabelle refused to back down. "Am I wrong? Someone like her wouldn't come to a viral restaurant unless she was after you!"

"You—"

"Excuse me, sir." A calm male voice interrupted.

A waiter stepped forward. "How may I assist you?"

"I'm here to pick up a friend."

"May I ask who—"

"Dr. Wilson!" Vivian waved excitedly. "Over here!"

Gregory adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and nodded politely to the waiter.

The waiter immediately understood and gestured for Evelyn and Vivian to proceed.

Annabelle blocked their path. "Why do they get to skip the line?"

"This gentleman already waited in line earlier," the waiter replied coolly.

"What friend?"

Gregory walked over slowly.

He wore a simple white shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, revealing well-defined forearms.

"Vivian. Dr. Carter." He gave a slight nod.

Vivian grabbed Evelyn's hand and started to lead her inside.

"Stop right there!" Annabelle snapped.

Gregory paused, his gaze steady behind his glasses. "Is there a problem?"

Annabelle looked him up and down. "And you are...?"

Gregory's lips curved slightly. "Currently, a suitor."
###Chapter 55: A Tainted Heart

The viral restaurant buzzed with chatter, every table occupied.

Waiters weaved through the crowd with trays, barely pausing for breath.

Vivian Dempsey pulled Evelyn Carter into an empty seat, her expression darkening. "What rotten luck. Can't even enjoy a meal without running into trash."

Gregory Wilson settled across from them, his gaze thoughtful. "You know Annabelle?"

"'Annabelle'?" Vivian scoffed. "Fitting name for a snake."

Gregory slid menus toward them. "See what you'd like."

Vivian snatched one up. "I'll order. I've studied their signature dishes."

"And you, Dr. Carter?" Gregory's eyes shifted to Evelyn.

She shook her head slightly. "Anything's fine."

"Any dietary restrictions?"

"None. I'm not picky."

Gregory adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, lips quirking. "Rare to meet someone so easygoing these days. Heard some women dump men for ordering the wrong entrée."

Evelyn chuckled. "Speaking from experience?"

"Friends' complaints." He lifted his teacup. "But I believe it's not about the food—it's whether the other person cares."

She nodded. "Exactly. Women don't crave luxury. Just sincerity."

"Noted." Approval flickered in his eyes.

Vivian suddenly sneered. "Too bad some assume everyone's as money-hungry as they are." She jerked her chin toward the entrance. "Case in point."

Evelyn remained composed. "People see others through the lens of their own heart."

"Damn right!" Vivian slapped the menu shut. "This isn't her private club. We belong here too."

Evelyn changed the subject. "Decided what to order?"

"Done via app." Vivian turned abruptly to Gregory. "Greg, you know that Annabelle Taylor?"

His gaze lingered on Evelyn. "Pardon?"

"Not my Evelyn," Vivian clarified, lip curling. "The pregnant princess swanning around outside."

"What a coincidence."

As Vivian opened her mouth, Evelyn gently nudged her under the table.

"...So you only knew her by her English name?" Vivian amended quickly.

Gregory sipped his tea. "We crossed paths in London. A case—I was the victim's physician. She defended the accused."

"A murder?" Vivian's eyes widened.

"Husband cheated, refused to split assets, so..." He left it hanging.

Vivian slammed the table. "And she took that monster's side?"

"Just doing her job." His tone was neutral. "The courts decide right and wrong."

"Did they convict?"
###Chapter 56: Uninvited Guests

Gregory Wilson frowned slightly. "Attorney Jane returned to China mid-case, and it was transferred to another lawyer. As the emergency physician, I only issued the death certificate before leaving. The case was still pending when I departed."

Vivian Dempsey scoffed. "Foreign bureaucracy never changes—always dragging their feet."

"But Attorney Jane was quite... memorable."

"Oh?"

Gregory shook his head. "That involves personal privacy. I shouldn’t elaborate."

Vivian smirked in understanding. "Must’ve been something scandalous."

Gregory smiled without confirming.

A waiter approached nervously. "Excuse me—"

Vivian cut him off impatiently. "Out of pineapple fried rice again? Fine, cancel the order."

"No, it’s... two guests claiming to be your friends asked to share your table."

"Friends?"

Vivian shot Gregory a puzzled look, but he seemed equally confused.

"They said they spoke to you earlier at the entrance..." The waiter stepped aside, revealing Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton.

Vivian’s lips curled coldly. "They’re not my friends."

The waiter froze awkwardly.

Evelyn approached, her pregnant belly prominent. "Miss Dempsey, we just met outside."

"Does a glance from a stray dog on the street make it my friend too? Should I feed every creature that looks my way?"

Evelyn stiffened. "I’m pregnant. Must you be so cruel—"

"Who fathered that child isn’t my concern." Vivian turned to the waiter. "Escort them out."

The waiter hesitated, glancing at Alexander.

Alexander’s expression darkened. "Let’s go."

He reached for Evelyn’s arm, but she shook him off.

Evelyn locked eyes with Evelyn. "Dr. Carter, you wouldn’t turn away a pregnant woman, would you? Alexander’s been trying to reach you about the divorce paperwork for days."

"I blocked him." Evelyn’s gaze shifted calmly to Alexander. "Is there an issue with the agreement?"

Alexander gave a bitter smile.

The terms were brutally simple—split assets evenly. She wanted nothing, only a swift exit.

"If there are no objections, set a date. Just sign a power of attorney, and Emily and I can handle the formalities."
###Chapter 57: Keep Your Woman in Check

Alexander Hamilton forced a bitter smile. "Emily Zade...is no longer with the company."

Evelyn Carter finally remembered.

Emily had been fired by Annabelle Taylor and replaced with her cousin.

"Then have the company's legal team come with me to the civil affairs office to finalize the paperwork."

"Evelyn," Alexander's voice was low. "I failed you and our child..."

"What's done is done." Evelyn turned to Annabelle. "Happy now, Miss Taylor?"

Annabelle smiled slyly. "I hope Dr. Carter keeps her word."

"How about this?" Evelyn said coolly. "Have Alexander sign a power of attorney, and the two of us can handle the divorce? Since you're a lawyer, you'd prefer handling it yourself."

Annabelle's grin widened. "That’s a great idea. Actually, why bother with the hassle? Alexander and I are getting married anyway. We could just handle the divorce and marriage registration together—efficient, don’t you think?"

"Suit yourselves."

"Don’t take it personally, Dr. Carter. Alexander is just worried about me and the baby. My belly’s getting bigger, and he doesn’t want people gossiping. You know how protective he is of me."

Evelyn scoffed. "Of course. After all, you two are the best of friends."

She emphasized the word friends with biting sarcasm.

Everyone at the table caught the jab—except Gregory Wilson.

Alexander’s expression darkened. He had lost weight recently, his once-confident demeanor now shadowed by gloom.

In just a month, he had become a different man.

Vivian Dempsey rolled her eyes. "Are you done? If so, get out. You’re ruining everyone’s appetite."

Annabelle feigned offense. "Dr. Carter, does your friend always speak so rudely?"

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "What part was rude?"

"Telling someone to leave isn’t rude?"

"Oh." Evelyn pointed at the door. "Then leave."

Vivian burst out laughing, slapping the table. "Miss Taylor, you must be something special to push Evelyn this far."

The waitstaff began serving dishes.

"Your order is complete. Enjoy your meal."

Gregory gave a polite nod. "Thank you."

Vivian picked up her chopsticks, eyeing the lingering couple. "Still here? Waiting for security to escort you out?"

Annabelle lifted her chin. "Who dares? I’m carrying the future heir of the Hamilton Group!"

Thud!

Evelyn slammed her chopsticks down.

She rarely lost her temper.

Even with the most difficult patients, she remained composed.

Alexander spoke quietly. "Evelyn, I’m sorry. I’ll take her away now."

Evelyn let out a cold laugh. "If you could control her, would she have barged in here in the first place?"

He closed his eyes briefly. "My apologies."

"Mr. Hamilton, I thought we could part amicably. But clearly," Evelyn met his gaze, "you need to keep your woman in check. Disrupting my clinic was bad enough—must you humiliate yourselves in public too?!"
###Chapter 58: The River Gambit

"I'm sorry, Evelyn—"

"I'm tired of apologies." I cut him off, staring calmly out the window.

Alexander Hamilton's knuckles turned white, his jaw clenched tight. "Give me one more week."

"Your promises mean nothing now, Mr. Hamilton."

Annabelle Taylor suddenly rushed over, grabbing his sleeve. "Alex, let's go!"

He shoved her away, his voice dangerously low. "Enough."

"I'm the one causing trouble?" Tears sprang to Annabelle's eyes instantly. "Ever since she showed up, you’ve been obsessed! You won’t even look at me anymore!"

The restaurant chatter quieted.

Nearby diners began glancing our way.

Annabelle raised her voice. "Alexander Hamilton! Who was it that took the long way home just to walk me back every day? Who confessed to me in front of the entire graduation ceremony?"

Her trembling finger pointed at me. "And now, for her, you’re throwing away twenty years of love?"

Vivian Dempsey snorted. "Someone get this woman an Oscar."

Gregory Wilson wordlessly slid his plate of sliced steak toward me. "It’ll get cold."

"Thanks."

Annabelle’s sobs cut off abruptly.

She lunged at me like a furious lioness, nails digging into my wrist. "This is all your fault!"

I stumbled back from the force.

Alexander moved instantly. "Let her go!"

"No!" Annabelle shrieked, hysterical. "I’m taking her to the river! Let’s see who you’ll save when we’re both drowning!"

The restaurant fell dead silent.

Every eye locked onto us.

Annabelle’s swollen belly and tear-streaked face would soften anyone’s heart.

"You swore to protect me forever," she choked out. "Time to prove it."

Alexander’s expression darkened.

Vivian whistled. "Drama of the year."

Gregory stood, shielding me. "Ma’am, do you need medical assistance?"

Annabelle’s pupils dilated.

Her gaze fixed on Gregory’s protective stance—then she yanked my hair with a snarl. "Whore! How many men have you bewitched?!"

Sharp pain shot across my scalp.

I seized her wrist, my voice icy. "Take your theatrics elsewhere."

Alexander finally snapped, scooping her up by the waist.

"Put me down!" She thrashed wildly. "If you walk away today, I’ll jump from the hospital rooftop!"

Outside the window, the sunset bled across the sky.

Rubbing my numb wrist, I signaled the waiter. "A fresh set of cutlery, please."
###Chapter 59: Clear Boundaries

Evelyn Carter never imagined she'd find herself in such an absurd situation.

Her relationship with Margaret Hamilton had always been harmonious.

Though not as intimate as biological mother and daughter, they maintained perfect mutual respect and care.

This ideal mother-in-law dynamic had spared Alexander Hamilton from ever facing those dreaded "life-or-death" dilemmas.

The cruel irony? When finally confronted with one, the scales balanced his ex-wife against his current partner.

Annabelle Taylor's pregnant belly protruded prominently, yet her grip remained steel-strong. She dragged Evelyn toward the restaurant exit.

The dining room buzzed with chatter, but nobody dared intervene with an emotional pregnant woman—too much liability.

Knowing Annabelle's cervical cerclage procedure, Evelyn resisted struggling, allowing herself to be pulled along.

"Alexander!" Evelyn turned and shouted sharply.

He snapped from his daze and rushed to block Annabelle's path. "Enough."

"Not nearly!"

He tried prying Annabelle's fingers loose. "Come home with me."

"Never!"

Her grip only tightened, making Evelyn gasp in pain.

Alexander's eyes flickered with concern, his hold instantly softening. "Please don't..."

Annabelle sneered and suddenly yanked Evelyn toward the street.

Screams erupted.

Screeching brakes harmonized into chaos.

"Pedestrian hit!"

"Blood! Call an ambulance!"

"Watch the pregnant woman!"

Alexander's blood turned to ice as he shoved through gawking bystanders.

The road became bedlam.

A dozen vehicles sat askew—rear-enders, side-swipes, one plowed into the median.

Drivers spilled out, furious, hunting the cause.

Waiters shielded Annabelle in a safe zone, even providing a chair.

While Evelyn alone faced the storm.

She sat crumpled on the asphalt, encircled by irate motorists.

Alexander threw himself between them. "I'll cover all damages."

"Who the hell are you?" The lead driver eyed them. "Her man?"

"No." Evelyn pushed up from the pavement, pointing at Annabelle. "That's Mrs. Hamilton."

The driver smirked. "Got yourself in a pickle, huh buddy?"

Alexander ignored him, reaching for Evelyn. "Are you hurt?"

She stepped back, voice frosty. "Mr. Hamilton, maintain your distance."
###Chapter 60: This Farce Must End

Alexander Hamilton's hand hovered in the air, fingers trembling slightly. He slowly withdrew it, his voice low. "I was just worried you'd get hurt."

"I'm fine." Evelyn Carter's gaze shifted past him to Vivian Dempsey and Gregory Wilson rushing over. "My friends are here."

Vivian sprinted to her side, eyes scanning the ground. Seeing no blood, she exhaled in relief and steadied Evelyn's arm. "Where are you hurt?"

Evelyn shook her head gently. "Vivian, I don't think we're having dinner here today."

"We should've listened to you and avoided this damn place." Vivian gritted her teeth. "What rotten luck."

"Yeah."

"Can you walk?"

Evelyn tested her ankle, wincing slightly.

Without hesitation, Gregory knelt. His fingers barely brushed her skirt before Evelyn stopped him. "Let's just leave. We're blocking the way."

Gregory stood, studying her pale face for a moment. Then he swept her into his arms and strode toward the sidewalk. Vivian hurried after them, shooting Alexander a glare over her shoulder.

At the curb, Gregory showed no intention of putting her down. He murmured something to Vivian, who immediately dashed to the parking lot. Moments later, her bright red sedan screeched to a halt beside them.

Gregory carefully settled Evelyn into the backseat before sliding in beside her. The car sped away, leaving only a crimson blur in its wake.

"Sir?" A waitress panted as she approached. "Your wife says she has stomach pains. She asked for you."

Alexander turned mechanically. Annabelle Taylor lounged on a sofa, surrounded by half a dozen fawning servers. She sipped water leisurely, her face devoid of any discomfort.

From the distance, a driver shouted, "Hey! What about our compensation?"

Alexander numbly handed over a business card. "Send the repair bills to this address."

"CEO of Hamilton Group?" The driver's eyes widened before twisting into a sneer. "No wonder you can afford two women."

Another driver gasped. "Wait—wasn't she the one who killed that traffic cop in the drunk driving accident last week?"

"Shouldn't she be in jail? How'd she get out?"

"Rich people play by different rules..."

"This needs to go viral. I'm recording this..."

The tide of murmurs swelled around him. Alexander hastily settled the claims, promising additional hush money to disperse the crowd.

Traffic gradually resumed. The queue reformed at the restaurant entrance. Servers returned to work—except those still trapped by Annabelle's whims.

As Alexander trudged over, he caught a server's tearful plea:

"Ma'am, we'll prepare our best private room immediately!"

"Your meal is complimentary today!"

"You'll never need reservations again..."

Annabelle crossed her legs, savoring her water while ignoring the desperation around her. Spotting Alexander, she smirked. "Alexander, my stomach hurts so much."
###Chapter 61: Final Warning

Alexander's brow twitched.

He reached out to steady Annabelle. "I thought you had stomach pains. Let's go to the hospital."

"Alexander!" Annabelle suddenly perked up, bouncing on her toes. "They agreed to give us a private dining room—and it's complimentary!"

His gaze turned icy. "The pain's gone?"

"It was terrible earlier, but I feel much better now."

"Did you threaten the staff again?"

"I merely educated them on legal liabilities," she said smugly, tilting her chin up. "If anything happened to me here, they'd face immediate shutdown. Do you know how much this viral restaurant makes daily? Imagine their losses."

Alexander studied her triumphant expression, his chest tightening.

"Let's eat." Annabelle moved to loop her arm through his.

He sidestepped her. "Go ahead. I'm not hungry."

"Running back to Dr. Carter at the hospital?" She scoffed. "Even after deleting her contact, you still can't let go?"

"You dragged her into traffic. Shouldn't I check on her?"

"She's got her white knight guarding her," Annabelle sneered. "Since when is that your concern?"

"Taking responsibility is basic decency."

Her face darkened. "I just wanted to scare her off. If a pregnant woman like me is fine, what could possibly happen to her?"

Murmurs rippled through the queue. "If she hadn't shielded you, would you be standing here unharmed?"

Annabelle whirled around. "You saw her shield me? We walked out together—I was just slower! Slander is actionable!"

"Then sue me!" A young woman stepped forward. "You stopped abruptly and flung her into the road. She could've escaped, but she turned back to protect you—that's why the car hit her!"

Alexander's pupils constricted. "She was hit?"

"Rolled across the pavement multiple times," the woman pointed at the ceiling. "It's all on camera. Control your wife, handsome. Not every woman who glances your way deserves a death sentence."

Annabelle exploded. "One stalked my husband with her phone, the other tailed us here! They got what they deserved—shameless homewreckers!"

"Stalking?" The woman snorted. "This is a viral restaurant. People come for photos. She never even spoke to your husband. More like unlucky—"

"Who are you calling unlucky?!"

Alexander clamped onto Annabelle's wrist. "We're leaving."

"Go by yourself!"

His voice dropped to subzero. "Last chance. Are you coming?"
###Chapter 62: If You Dare Leave, I'll Make Her Die

"What did I do wrong?" Annabelle clutched the napkin so tightly her knuckles turned white. "That bitch Evelyn just won't give up! I already showed her mercy at the hospital last time—even personally delivered pear soup to her. Doesn't she get the message? It's been a month, and she still hasn't signed the divorce papers. And today, she just happened to run into us..."

A cold smirk twisted her lips, her eyes glinting with malice. "I've seen plenty of women like her—playing the innocent saint. If I don't teach her a lesson, she’ll really think she can walk all over me."

Alexander Hamilton abruptly stood, his chair screeching against the floor.

"Enjoy your meal. I'm leaving."

"Alexander!" Annabelle slammed her hands on the table, rattling the dishes. "Don’t you dare walk away!"

He paused for only a second before continuing toward the parking lot without looking back.

"Fine! Go ahead!" Her voice rose to a shrill, hysterical pitch. "I’ll throw myself in front of a car right now! See if you can live with that guilt!"

Patrons turned to stare.

"Sir," a middle-aged woman interjected, "pregnant women are emotional. You should be more understanding."

"Exactly," another diner chimed in. "She’s sensitive right now. You must not be giving her enough security."

"Those homewreckers are cunning—always targeting married men."

"The worst are the ones who pretend to be friends while scheming behind your back!"

Amid the murmurs, Annabelle’s sobs grew louder. "Alexander! You heartless bastard! Twenty years of love, and you just throw it away like this?!"

Alexander clenched his jaw, his Adam’s apple bobbing.

Who was the real schemer here?

"Sir," a waiter whispered, "your wife’s distress isn’t good for the baby..."

"Alexander!" Annabelle suddenly grabbed a steak knife and pressed it to her throat, her voice piercing. "Take one more step, and I’ll slit my throat right here!"

The restaurant fell dead silent.

Alexander slowly turned, his gaze fixed on her trembling hand. "Put the knife down."

"Come back!" Tears streaked her face. "I’ll drop it if you come back!"

He walked back to the table, his voice icy. "Happy now?"

Her lips quivered. "You... you only came back because you were afraid I’d kill myself?"

"Annabelle," he rubbed his temples wearily, "what happened to the proud, confident woman I knew?"

"And what about you?" Her bloodshot eyes burned with fury. "You used to listen to everything I said! Now, because of her, you won’t even look at me!"

Alexander studied her in silence.

"Fine," he finally said. "What do you want?"

A triumphant smile curled Annabelle’s lips as she lowered the knife. "Finish this meal with me."
###Chapter 63: The Blood-Stained Truth

Alexander Hamilton's knuckles turned white.

"Fine."

He strode toward the restaurant.

"Stop." Annabelle Taylor's voice was shrill. "What kind of attitude is this?"

"I did as you asked."

"But your face says otherwise!"

"What do you want from me?" Alexander suddenly gestured around them. "See those cameras? Tomorrow's headlines will read 'Hamilton Group CEO spotted with pregnant woman at upscale restaurant.' The drunk driving scandal isn't even over yet."

Annabelle paled. "I..."

"You know better than anyone how precarious Hamilton Group's situation is." His voice dropped low. "Your cousin cost the company dearly. If this escalates further, can you handle the consequences?"

She reached for his arm.

Alexander jerked away. "Didn't you want dinner? The private room's complimentary—courtesy of Attorney Taylor."

"..."

"Let's go."

"..."

"Now!"

Annabelle staggered back, tears welling. "You're shouting at me?"

A cold smile twisted his lips. "This is the real me. I've played the refined gentleman for twenty years to please you."

"Shouldn't love mean acceptance?"

"And what about you?" His gaze pinned hers.

Her expression hardened. "Regretting this now?"

"Just realizing we're incompatible."

"Alexander Hamilton!" Her voice rose sharply. "Don't forget who chased after whom!"

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Two officers approached briskly. "We received reports of an altercation and car accident here."

Bystanders turned to stare.

The lead officer froze. "Mr. Hamilton? Not you again..."

Alexander dragged a hand down his face. "I'll cooperate. She's pregnant—please see her home."

The officer nodded. "We'll arrange it."

Annabelle clutched the officer's sleeve in panic. "It's just a marital spat—"

"Any injuries require investigation."

Alexander walked to the police car without looking back.

Inside the vehicle, the officer ventured carefully, "That's your wife?"

Silence.

"Pregnant women have mood swings. Be patient—it's your child after all..."

"My child?" Alexander suddenly laughed.

"Isn't it?"

The window reflected his bloodshot eyes.

The child that was truly his had vanished from this world a month ago—nothing but blood on an operating table.
###Chapter 64: What If He Comes Back

Evelyn Carter was rushed to Central Hospital.

The familiar scent of disinfectant eased her tense nerves slightly. After a thorough examination, Dr. Porter said, "No broken bones—just a sprain and some abrasions. I'll prescribe some medication to reduce swelling. Keep the area dry for a week."

"Thank you, Dr. Porter."

"Don't mention it. Someone come with me to get the medication."

Vivian Dempsey started to stand, but Gregory Wilson was already on his feet. "Stay with Evelyn. I'll go."

Evelyn didn’t go to the surgical clinic. She returned directly to her own office.

Vivian crouched in front of her, frowning at the angry scrapes on her legs. "She was trying to kill you, and you still saved her?"

"I didn’t save her."

"Please. Eyewitnesses saw you turn back and shield her when you could’ve run."

Evelyn opened her palm. "I went back for this."

Vivian froze when she saw what lay in Evelyn’s hand. "Why are you still holding onto this?"

"I forgot to return it." Evelyn rubbed the diamond ring between her fingers. "It’s worth tens of thousands. Marital property. If it went missing, Annabelle would make a scene."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Let her! Fighting over an ex-wife’s engagement ring? Alexander should be ashamed."

"I don’t want anything more to do with them."

"Fair," Vivian scoffed. "After today’s spectacle, it’s clear she doesn’t care about embarrassing Alexander."

The phone rang.

"Who is it?"

Evelyn’s brow furrowed at the caller ID—Margaret Hamilton, her former mother-in-law.

"Hello?"

"It’s me."

Evelyn hesitated. "Mrs. Hamilton."

A pause on the other end.

Finally, Margaret sighed. "You’re right to address me that way. I heard you were hurt. Is it serious?"

"Just minor scrapes. Nothing to worry about."

"You returned all the gifts I sent..." Margaret’s voice trembled. "I understand you want a clean break. But I feel terrible..."

"You weren’t at fault."

"Wasn’t I? I swore up and down they were just friends..."

Evelyn cut her off. "It’s over. I’ll always remember how kind you were to me these past years."

"Evelyn," Margaret suddenly lowered her voice. "If Alexander wanted to come back... would you give him another chance?"

Evelyn’s fingers twitched. "Did he say something to you?"
###Chapter 65: Legally Married

Margaret Hamilton's call had just ended when Evelyn Carter's phone buzzed urgently again.

An unfamiliar number flashed on the screen.

Assuming it was an emergency patient, Evelyn hastily bid farewell to her mother-in-law and answered.

A stern voice spoke: "Ms. Carter, this is the H City Police Department."

——

In the police station lobby, Evelyn limped forward with difficulty, her injured leg slowing her progress.

A female officer hurried over to support her. "Do you need assistance?"

"I'm here to bail out Alexander Hamilton."

"You are Mr. Hamilton's...?"

Evelyn hesitated.

The divorce papers hadn't been finalized yet. Legally, they were still married.

But in reality, their marriage had long been dead.

As she struggled for words, Alexander emerged from the interrogation room, accompanied by a male officer.

The male officer eyed Evelyn. "Here to file a report?"

The female officer clarified, "She's here for Mr. Hamilton's bail."

The man raised an eyebrow. "Family? Sister?"

"My wife," Alexander said quietly.

The two officers exchanged glances. The female officer couldn't resist asking, "Then what about the pregnant woman earlier—"

"Ex-wife," Evelyn cut in. "She's the current one."

The male officer scoffed. "Bail requires immediate family. An ex-wife doesn't count."

"We haven't finalized the divorce yet."

The officer gave Alexander a meaningful look. "So you're still legally married."

The female officer's eyes widened. "Not even divorced, and the new flame is already pregnant?"

Evelyn had no interest in explaining further. "Where do I sign?"

The female officer handed her a form. "Over here."

Leaning against the wall, Evelyn slowly made her way to the desk. Alexander moved to help, but she declined. "No need for your concern, Mr. Hamilton."

She carefully filled out her personal information, pausing briefly at the "Relationship" field before finally writing "Spouse."

"Done."

The female officer took the form. "One moment—I'll get the receipt."

Alexander spoke up quickly. "Let me. Her leg—"

The male officer stopped him. "You're not free to move until the paperwork is complete. I'll handle it."

Evelyn nodded politely. "Thank you."

The waiting area was tucked in a corner.

Evelyn continued her slow journey along the wall. Alexander followed at a respectful distance—close enough to catch her if she fell, but not so close as to intrude.

Those few meters felt endless.

When she finally sat down, Alexander chose the seat beside hers, leaving one space between them.

"Your leg injury—"

"Don't apologize." Evelyn cut him off. "Every time we've met since deciding to divorce, you've said sorry. I've heard enough."
###Chapter 66 The Final Farewell

Alexander Hamilton's Adam's apple bobbed as he nodded slowly.

"I'm surprised you saved her," he said in a low voice.

Evelyn Carter gave a wry smile. "I surprised myself too."

"Compassion is in your blood," Alexander murmured, his gaze drifting into the distance. "Just like that typhoon years ago when you risked your life to make your hospital shift—"

"Don't bring that up," Evelyn cut him off. "It's pointless."

"It matters to me." He drew a deep breath. "Today... I must have looked pathetic to you."

"You mean Annabelle?"

"...Yes."

"Not pathetic," Evelyn said flatly. "Just not funny at all."

Alexander let out a self-deprecating chuckle. "I've become a walking joke lately."

"Your personal life isn't my business to judge." Her voice remained calm. "All I can offer is my blessing."

"Blessing for what?"

"A long marriage? A house full of children?"

His smile froze. "That sounds like sarcasm."

"I didn't mean it that way."

"I know." His lips twisted bitterly. "I'm mocking myself."

"After twenty years of obsession, you finally got what you wanted. Why doubt it now?"

Alexander's eyes darkened. "Twenty years... yet now that we're together, it's nothing like I imagined."

Evelyn looked away. "You made your choice."

"I heard if it weren't for you today, Annabelle would've been the one hit by that car." He paused. "I know you hate apologies, so I won't say it. But thank you—that I must say."

Evelyn pulled a velvet box from her pocket and handed it to him.

"Returning what's yours."

His hand trembled slightly. "This is..."

"The wedding ring." Her tone was matter-of-fact. "I heard it's worth a house. Not appropriate for me to keep."

"Evelyn..."

"Enough." She interrupted firmly. "We failed as spouses, and we can't be friends either. Strangers is the cleanest way. Oh, and there are some things I left—"

She broke off mid-sentence.

That place wasn't her home anymore.

It belonged to Alexander and Annabelle now.

"Just mail my belongings to me. Three years' worth might be too much—feel free to toss them if it's troublesome. But please send back the medical books on the shelf. I need them for my thesis."

Alexander nodded. "To Vivian Dempsey's address?"

"Yes. Include the divorce papers too."

"No rush on the paperwork," he said. "We can sign during the formalities."

Evelyn considered this. "Fine. When are you available? Let's settle this quickly."

A bitter smile touched his lips. "The company's had some issues lately. You've probably heard."

She recalled Vivian's gossip—Annabelle's cousin had botched a major deal, costing Hamilton Group tens of millions.

"How long will it take?"

Alexander suddenly asked, "Why the hurry to divorce... Planning something new?"
###Chapter 67: A Prayer for the Departed

Evelyn met Alexander's gaze directly. "I want to buy a house."

He instantly understood her concern.

The hidden risks of dividing marital assets made his brow furrow.

"Annabelle's words aren't trustworthy."

"I've checked the marriage laws. She wasn't wrong."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "I thought... someone was pursuing you."

"Legally, I'm still Mrs. Hamilton. Besides, I don't have an old flame waiting in the wings, ready to rekindle things the moment we divorce."

He gave a bitter smile. "I used to think you were gentle as water. Now I see the steel in your bones."

"I won't deny I'm mocking you." Evelyn tapped the table lightly with her fingertips. "Had she approached me openly, I might have stepped aside. But she chose the cruelest way—from start to finish."

"She wasn't like this as a child..."

"How young?"

"Before she turned four."

Evelyn froze. "...That is early."

How clear could memories from age four really be?

"People change."

"True. When I saw her again at seven, she was already climbing trees and getting into fights. Her teachers called her parents constantly."

Evelyn murmured, "You two were well-matched."

"How so?"

"Richard mentioned you were quite the troublemaker in middle school."

Alexander arched a brow. "You've met Richard?"

"At the class reunion. I overheard some chatter."

He didn't deny it.

"The bullies at our school never picked on the weak. We only fought outsiders."

"Who did I bully? Is that what Richard said?"

"He didn't elaborate. I'm just reminding you—Annabelle's recklessness could lead to disaster. If someone had actually died today..."

Alexander nodded solemnly. "You saved her. I'm ashamed."

"When she pushed me into traffic, she didn't care if I lived or died." Evelyn's laugh was cold. "I'm not that noble."

Her gaze drifted to the window. "But when I saw her clutching her stomach as she fell... If it had been me, I'd have walked away with minor injuries. But she was pregnant..."

"Consider it..." Her voice trembled. "...a blessing for the unborn child. May they find happiness in the next life."

Alexander's knuckles turned white, veins standing out.

"I wouldn't have been a good mother. I refused to trap a marriage with a child, and I couldn't bear to let them grow up without a father's love..."

"...Evelyn." His voice was rough. "Can I ask you something?"

"Go ahead."

"During the procedure... Did it hurt the baby?"
###Chapter 68: Next Time It Might Be Someone Else

"Evelyn, does it...hurt for the baby during a miscarriage?"

"It was only five weeks. Not even an embryo yet."

"What about you?"

Evelyn's fingers curled slightly.

"From the moment you left the resort until the procedure ended—eight full hours. Was that your last chance for me, or..."

"The wallet was an accident." Evelyn cut him off. "I heard everything you said on the terrace that day."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed.

"I should've known the moment Annabelle returned, the ending was already decided." Her voice was soft. "I just...didn’t want to see you two again."

His knuckles turned white.

"The hospital was quiet that day. Olivia prescribed the medication quickly." Evelyn gazed at the night outside the window. "But I sat in the exam room, staring at those two pills for a long time."

Four hours of hesitation.

Alexander suddenly raised a hand to cover his eyes.

A female officer stepped out with paperwork. "The bail process is complete."

He reached for it, but she bypassed him and handed it to Evelyn. "Regulations require it to go to family."

"Give it to him." Evelyn smiled faintly. "Next time, someone else might be here to bail him out."

"Alexander!"

Annabelle rushed in, her belly prominent, and clung to his arm. "I was so worried! Did they give you any trouble?"

He frowned. "I told you to rest at home."

"I was worried about you!" She pouted, shaking his arm. "I’ll forgive you this time, but if it happens again, I’m taking the baby back to England!"

His eyes followed the figure by the wall.

Evelyn leaned against it, then suddenly swayed.

"Careful!"

He shoved Annabelle aside and lunged forward—only for Evelyn to step away. "Don’t."

"Where’s Vivian? I asked her to—"

"Alexander!" Annabelle yanked his sleeve. "My stomach hurts..."

The officer smirked. "So this is the real Mrs. Hamilton?"

Annabelle’s expression darkened. "What nonsense did she tell you? Playing the victim—"

"She came to post bail for Mr. Hamilton." The officer slapped the paperwork onto the desk.

Annabelle shrieked, "I could’ve bailed him! Why involve her?"
###Chapter 69: I Might Just Slap You

The female officer smirked. "Don't you know why he called her and not you?"

Annabelle Taylor bit her lip hard, nails digging into her palms. "Next time, it'll be me."

"What, you're hoping Mr. Hamilton gets arrested again?"

Annabelle's face stiffened.

Too afraid to argue with the officer, she redirected her anger toward Evelyn Carter.

"Dr. Carter," she said, clicking her heels closer with a fake smile. "Alexander is usually so reserved. Let me thank you on his behalf."

Evelyn leaned against the wall, her knuckles turning white.

She wished she could vanish.

But her injured leg slowed her down, and now this woman wouldn't let her go.

"Mhm." Evelyn kept moving toward the exit without looking back.

Annabelle's gaze lingered on her leg, lips curling in disdain. "That car barely grazed you. You're really milking it, huh?"

"Miss Taylor."

"What?"

"Stay away from me."

"Afraid I'll push you again?"

"No. I'm afraid I won’t be able to stop myself from slapping you."

Annabelle’s eyes widened. "You—"

"Listen carefully," Evelyn met her glare. "If you come at me again, don’t blame me for what happens."

Annabelle laughed, resting a hand on her belly. "I’m pregnant, Dr. Carter. If you lay a finger on me and something happens to my baby—"

"Don’t worry," Evelyn smirked. "I specialize in putting people like you in their place. You’ll be screaming in pain, but your baby will be just fine."

She suddenly turned to Alexander Hamilton. "Mr. Hamilton, control your dog. If she bites again, I’ll take down the owner too."

"Who are you calling a dog?!"

"The one who answered."

"Officer! She just publicly insulted me! That’s slander!"

The female officer shrugged. "Take it to civil court."

Evelyn scoffed. "Make sure the subpoena gets delivered to the OB-GYN department."

"You’ll regret this!"

"Stop with the empty threats," Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Show me what the great Miss Taylor is really capable of."

Annabelle suddenly lashed out, aiming a vicious kick at Evelyn’s injured knee.

Alexander yanked her back.

"Have you lost your mind?!" he snapped.

"She insulted me!" Annabelle shrieked. "You’re taking her side?!"

"Enough!" Alexander shoved her into a chair. "Haven’t you embarrassed yourself enough?!"

The officer steadied Evelyn. "Let me walk you out."

This time, Evelyn didn’t refuse.

At the precinct entrance, the officer hailed her a cab.

"Thank you."

"Of course."

When the officer returned to the lobby, she gasped—

Annabelle had Alexander by his tie, the two of them locked in a violent struggle.
###Chapter 70: Alexander, Have You Fallen for Her?

Annabelle lunged at him like a madwoman, clawing and hitting. Alexander shielded her with his arms, careful not to harm the baby in her womb. His gold-rimmed glasses clattered to the floor, lenses shattering.

"Enough!" The female officer barked. "Take your fight elsewhere. This is a police station!"

Annabelle wrenched her arm free and turned her back on him. "I'm not going anywhere with him!"

Alexander adjusted his disheveled collar, exhaustion weighing on him. "Are you done?"

"Not even close!" Her voice trembled with fury. "This isn't over, Alexander!"

He methodically smoothed his rolled-up sleeves. "Fine. I'll leave first."

"You wouldn't dare!" She whirled around, shrill. "I'm pregnant! You'd just abandon me here?"

A cold smirk curled his lips. "You didn't seem concerned about safety when you dragged Evelyn into traffic earlier."

"Alexander." Her glare burned into him. "Have you fallen for her?"

The air turned to ice.

"You've grown impatient with me lately." Her voice shook. "You used to comfort me. But ever since you married her, you changed!"

Changed?

A bitter smile tugged at his mouth.

The girl he'd waited twenty years for was finally his. He'd thought Evelyn would be the biggest obstacle—even prepared a hefty compensation.

Yet Evelyn had cleanly severed all ties, even terminating the pregnancy.

What he never expected was that the love he'd dreamed of would turn out like this.

"Maybe," Vincent swirled his drink, "Annabelle was always like this?"

Vincent was a few years younger, their junior. The guy cycled through women like outfits but would take a bullet for his friends.

Alexander used to despise that about him.

"So? Did you really leave her at the station?"

"...No."

"She refused to leave. How'd you handle it?"

Alexander massaged his temples. "Promised her a bag."

Vincent choked on his whiskey. "That's it?"

"Mm." Alexander drained his glass. "'Retail therapy' works wonders."

"Knew it." Vincent shook his head. "No way you'd actually walk away."

Alexander gave a hollow laugh, signaling for another drink.

"You and my brother are two peas in a pod," Vincent muttered. "Both utterly whipped. Gregory's been overseas since—"

The glass slammed onto the bar.

Alexander's gaze turned glacial. "Who did you say?"
###Chapter 71: Don't Ask About Alexander's Private Matters

"Gregory Wilson. The 'Gregory' is like 'thunder'—just one character different from my name."

Alexander Hamilton's gaze sharpened instantly. "From the medical school?"

Vincent Wilson's eyes lit up. "You know my brother? I told you he's impressive. Even you—"

Alexander let out a cold laugh.

A server arrived with their drinks. He took the glass and downed it in one go.

Vincent quickly intervened. "Alexander, that's vodka. You shouldn't drink it like—"

"Who is your brother in love with?"

Vincent shook his head. "He's kept it completely secret. Not even our mother knows."

Just then, Vincent suddenly waved. "Nathan! Over here!"

Nathan York hurried over and greeted respectfully, "Alexander."

Vincent slung an arm around him. "What took you so long? Alexander's been waiting."

"Traffic."

Nathan sat beside Alexander and immediately pulled out his phone. "Should I brief you, or do you want to see for yourself?"

Alexander glanced up. "She posted again?"

"Just now."

Gregory frowned. "Who got rich?"

Nathan rolled his eyes. "She posted on social media."

"Whose social media?"

"Vivian Dempsey's."

Gregory tensed. "Why are you checking her social media?"

Nathan shot back, "Don't pry into Alexander's business."

He handed the phone to Alexander. "Take a look."

The photo was taken outside a trendy restaurant, the crowd blurred in the background. The two figures at the center stood out starkly.

A man carried a woman as he ran forward. The woman was almost entirely hidden, only her flowing dark hair and skirt visible.

Nathan analyzed, "The composition is straight out of a romance drama. Vivian never used to post stuff like—"

Alexander abruptly stood, grabbing his coat.

Nathan chased after him. "Alexander, don't leave yet—"

He cut himself off mid-sentence.

Alexander's expression was terrifyingly dark.

Vincent caught up too. "What's wrong?"

"Annoyed. I'm leaving. Put it on my tab."

"Wait, your company's been—"

Alexander turned a cold glare on him. "Think I can't afford it?"

"No, no, of course not..."

Nathan pressed, "Should we keep monitoring Vivian's posts?"

Alexander paused briefly. "...Notify me immediately if there's any news."

The two watched him leave, exchanging bewildered looks.

Back at the bar, Nathan recounted what had happened.

Vincent was stunned. "So the 'wife' Alexander mentioned in that interview wasn't Annabelle?"

Nathan nodded. "Same pronunciation, different name."

"We all thought he was still hung up on her. Turns out he really got married."

"Honestly, Nathan, how was Alexander with Annabelle?"

"Need you ask? He gave her everything."

"Stringing him along for over twenty years... that's just cruel." Nathan's tone was heavy.
###Chapter 72: Am I That Boring?

Vincent Wilson awkwardly rubbed his nose and took a large gulp of his drink. "Annabelle always said she and Alexander were just friends."

"Friends?" Nathan York scoffed. "Even a blind man could see how Alexander feels about her."

Vincent chuckled nervously but didn’t respond.

Nathan swirled his glass, the ice clinking softly. "The real tragedy is Evelyn Carter. Used as a stand-in without even knowing it. Every kindness Alexander showed her was meant for Annabelle. Now that the real one is back, she’s been tossed aside."

Vincent shrugged. "Was marrying into the Hamilton family such a hardship? The divorce settlement alone would set her up for life."

"True," Nathan agreed.

"What’s her background like?"

"Rumor has it she couldn’t even afford a place in Hudson City. After the divorce, she had to crash at a friend’s place."

Vincent smirked. "Then she should be thanking Annabelle. If it weren’t for sharing her name, would someone like her ever have gotten so lucky?"

The next day, Evelyn finally had a day off.

She limped to the hospital to change her bandages, then stayed in her office to review patient files.

At noon, Olivia Lightfoot walked in with takeout from the cafeteria and shut the medical chart in front of Evelyn.

"Working on your day off?"

Evelyn looked up with a faint smile. "I had nothing better to do."

"You could’ve slept or played games."

Her smile faded. "Olivia."

"Yeah?"

"Am I that boring?"

Olivia handed her a pair of disposable chopsticks. "Of course not. The interns all say your lectures are engaging."

"I mean in life," Evelyn said quietly. "I don’t watch short videos, don’t follow celebrities, can’t even name half the makeup brands."

Olivia chewed on her chopsticks thoughtfully. "Isn’t that normal for doctors? Especially in OB-GYN—we can’t afford to slack off. Lives are at stake."

Evelyn stared out the window. "Dating a doctor must be really dull."

"That’s why most of us end up dating within the profession," Olivia joked. "No one can complain about the other."

The phone rang abruptly.

It was the hospital director.

"Dr. Carter, are you at the hospital?"

"Yes."

"Come to my office."

Evelyn glanced at her bandaged leg. "Can we discuss it over the phone?"

"Better in person." The director paused as someone spoke to him, then corrected himself. "Wait in your office. I’ll come down."

After hanging up, Olivia paled. "Do you think… they found out about the abortion pills?"
###Chapter 73 The New Anesthesiologist

Evelyn's fingers twisted together unconsciously.

Her stomach churned with unease.

She hadn't registered for an appointment when getting medication from Olivia this time.

The central hospital's system showed no record of her surgery.

Technically, Olivia had violated protocol for her.

Evelyn bit her lip. "If the director asks, tell him I forced you. Say I used my position as your mentor to pressure you."

Olivia wrung her hands anxiously. "Dr. Carter, I can't possibly—"

"Do it." Evelyn cut her off. "Don't worry about me."

Ten minutes later, a knock sounded at the office door.

Olivia's shoulders hunched visibly as she went to answer. "D-Director, good afternoon."

The director raised an eyebrow. "Do I frighten you that much?"

"N-no..." Olivia forced a laugh. "Just professional respect for authority."

He chuckled. "Most young people these days have rebellious streaks. You're refreshingly proper."

Olivia ducked her head sheepishly.

As the director entered, Evelyn pushed herself up from the desk. "Director."

He waved her back down. "Still recovering from the leg injury?"

"It doesn't affect my work. Just slows my walking. Consultations and surgeries aren't an issue."

"Who said anything about firing you?" The director smiled. "Focus on healing. Let your assistant handle the running around. Our OB-GYN department still needs you."

"You flatter me."

"Just stating facts." His expression turned serious. "By the way, blood bank supplies are low. Join the bloodmobile team—you can work seated and get some fresh air."

Evelyn frowned slightly. "Director, was there something you needed?"

"I have good news to share early." His eyes sparkled. "We've recruited an anesthesiology specialist returning from abroad. He turned down higher salaries and even provincial hospitals to join us."

"An anesthesiologist?"

"Exactly. Reports to OB-GYN tomorrow." The director beamed. "Make sure you keep him happy here."

Evelyn nodded. "I'll do my best."

The director gestured toward the door. "Come meet your new colleague—Dr. Wilson, come in."

The door opened.

A tall, broad-shouldered man entered in a crisp suit, his calm gaze steady behind gold-rimmed glasses.

He extended a hand. "Dr. Carter. Long time no see."

Evelyn froze.

The director introduced, "This is Dr. Gregory Wilson, our new anesthesiology specialist. Dr. Wilson, meet Dr. Evelyn Carter from OB-GYN."

Gregory's lips curved. "I see you remember me?"

Evelyn mechanically shook his hand. "Why would you—"

"Not welcome?"

"No..." She withdrew her hand. "With your credentials, you could work anywhere."

Gregory adjusted his glasses. "First, my family is here in H City. Second..." His gaze lingered on her. "An anesthesiologist needs the right partner. I value collaboration."

Evelyn looked away.

The director noticed the tension. "You two know each other? When Dr. Wilson requested OB-GYN, I assumed it was because of you."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "You told the director we're acquainted?"
###Chapter 74 Traces of Attraction

"Mhm." Gregory Wilson remained composed. "I happened to witness your car accident when we ran into each other at the restaurant last time, so I brought you to the hospital."

Evelyn Carter's tense nerves relaxed slightly.

For a moment, she'd feared Gregory would bring up that love letter...

"Perfect!" The dean clapped his hands cheerfully. "Since you two know each other, collaboration will be even smoother. With both of you leading the charge, our OB-GYN department will reach new heights!"

"Dean..."

Olivia Lightfoot's timid voice came from the corner. "Is this why you wanted to see Dr. Carter?"

"What else?" The dean raised an eyebrow. "Dr. Carter is outstanding—did you think I was here to give her trouble?"

Olivia exhaled in relief. "Good, good. I thought..."

"Thought what?"

"Nothing, nothing." Olivia forced a laugh. "I assumed you were promoting Dr. Carter for her exceptional performance."

The dean stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Not a bad idea. Though I've been concerned—if she gets pregnant and takes maternity leave, we'd be short-staffed..."

"Don't worry about that!" Olivia blurted. "Dr. Carter is divorced—no risk of pregnancy!"

The moment the words left her mouth, she clapped a hand over it, eyes wide with regret.

The dean's gaze flickered between them. "...Divorced?"

Evelyn nodded awkwardly. "Yes."

"When?"

"During the holiday break."

"Why?" The dean looked puzzled. "You two seemed happy—your husband drove you to work every day. How did it fall apart so suddenly?"

Evelyn hesitated, unsure how to respond. "I..."

Gregory intervened smoothly. "Dean, weren't you going to show me the pharmacy storage?"

"Right, right." The dean snapped back to attention. "Let's go now."

Before leaving, Gregory paused briefly, glancing back at Evelyn.

She thought he might say something.

But he only offered a faint smile before following the dean out.

Olivia stood frozen until their footsteps faded before shutting the door.

"Dr. Carter! Did you see that? So handsome!"

Evelyn sighed. "Not scared anymore?"

Olivia grinned sheepishly. "Crisis averted! I was too nervous earlier to really look. Dr. Wilson is ridiculously attractive!"

"Crushing on him?"

"Absolutely not!"

Evelyn pointed toward the hallway. "There's a mirror at the end of the corridor. Go take a look—your face is red as a lobster."

Olivia cupped her cheeks, murmuring dreamily. "He really is gorgeous... I wonder if he's single..."

Just then, the office door knocked again.

Olivia pulled it open. "Who—oh! Dr. Wilson? Weren't you going to the pharmacy?"

Gregory smiled. "You're Olivia, right?"

"Yes, yes!" Olivia nodded eagerly. "You know me?!"

"Dr. Carter's right-hand assistant. You've been with her since graduation."

Olivia bobbed her head like a buoy. "That's me!"

Gregory handed her an elegant gift box. "I forgot to give you this earlier."

Olivia's eyes widened. "Oh my god! These cookies are impossible to find domestically!"

"I had a friend mail them from overseas."

Olivia was beside herself. "How did you know I love this brand? I've been out for ages—even resellers don't have them!"

Gregory simply smiled, his gaze drifting to Evelyn. "Let me know when you finish them. I'll have more sent."

Evelyn felt his stare like a physical heat, making her fidget. She ducked her head, focusing on her meal.

Suddenly, she envied Annabelle Taylor.

How had she accepted a man's obvious affection for over twenty years without flinching?

Facing that devotion daily yet remaining unfazed.

Even without explicit declarations, she'd basked in Alexander Hamilton's care without guilt.

Evelyn shook her head.

She couldn't do it.

Gregory's subtle gestures alone left her flustered.

His eyes still lingered on her.

Evelyn turned her back to the door, finally able to breathe.

"Dr. Wilson, you're the best!"

Gregory replied gently, "Looking forward to working together."

Bribed by both treats and charm, Olivia switched allegiances instantly. "Of course! By the way, Dr. Wilson... can I ask something personal?"

"Go ahead."

"Do you have a girlfriend?"

Gregory finally looked away from Evelyn. "Not currently. But... there is someone I like."

Cough cough—

Evelyn suddenly choked violently, tears springing to her eyes.
###Chapter 75: Allergic Reactions

Olivia Lightfoot finally gave in to her loyalty and obediently fetched a glass of warm water, gently patting Evelyn Carter's back. "Dr. Carter, slow down. The blood draw isn't until tomorrow."

Evelyn's face flushed red from coughing as she waved her hand. "Too spicy..."

"Have some soup." Gregory Wilson appeared beside her without warning, placing an elegant thermal container on the table. "Cordyceps and goji berry chicken soup. Good for replenishing energy."

"From the cafeteria?" Evelyn looked surprised.

The hospital cafeteria usually served simple fare—lucky to even get seaweed egg drop soup.

"Made it this morning," Gregory said casually. "I have a meeting with the director. I'll pick it up later."

With that, he turned and walked away, his steps steady.

Evelyn sat frozen, chopsticks still hovering mid-air.

Olivia immediately scooted closer, eyes gleaming. "Dr. Carter—"

"Speak normally." Evelyn frowned. "You're giving me goosebumps."

Olivia tapped the thermal container meaningfully. "Do you think Dr. Wilson came here just for you?"

Evelyn lowered her head and shoveled rice into her mouth. "Don't speculate. He said it's because his family is in H City."

Olivia propped her chin on her hand. "Homemade soup? That's some serious effort."

"Maybe it was for himself."

"Then he's being awfully generous."

Evelyn didn't respond, focusing on her meal.

Olivia reached for the container. "Let me see how good his cooking is—"

"Don't." Evelyn swatted her hand away. "It needs to be returned exactly as is."

"That's harsh." Olivia pouted.

Evelyn set down her chopsticks, her voice soft. "If there's no possibility, don't give false hope. Stringing someone along isn't right."

Olivia lowered her voice. "You're divorced now. You could start as friends and see where it goes..."

Evelyn coughed violently.

"Today's food isn't spicy." Olivia quickly handed her a tissue. "Are you okay, Dr. Carter? Allergic reaction?"

Evelyn wiped her mouth. "I'm allergic to the word 'friends.'"

"Huh?" Olivia looked baffled.

Evelyn had already packed her lunchbox and pushed Gregory's container toward her. "Leave this at the reception desk for Dr. Wilson to pick up."

"What about you?"

"Blood draw tomorrow." Evelyn stood. "I need to prepare."

Olivia hugged the container and nodded. "Leave it to me."

At the door, Evelyn suddenly turned back. "Do you still have those cookies Dr. Wilson gave you?"

Olivia immediately shielded the bag. "You're not giving these back too, are you?"

"Hand them over." Evelyn extended her palm.
###Chapter 76: Radiant in Widowhood

"Dr. Carter..."

"Relax, it's just a photo."

Olivia hesitated before handing over the cookie. "These are seriously amazing—zero fat and limited edition..."

The moment Evelyn snapped the picture, Olivia snatched the treat back.

"I told you not to repay me."

Olivia's eyes lit up. "You're giving it to me? I love you!"

Evelyn held up a hand to block her enthusiastic lunge. "You helped tremendously during that last surgery. I'll supply your cookies for six months."

"Ahhh! You're the best!"

Eventually, Olivia supported Evelyn out of the hospital and watched her taxi pull away.

Inside the cab, Evelyn opened her messages.

[Vivian: ?]

[Evelyn: Get me 200 boxes of these cookies]

[Vivian: Opening a convenience store?]

[Evelyn: Thank-you gift. For that nurse]

[Vivian: Got it. Five extra boxes?]

[Evelyn: Three for you, two to repay a favor]

[Vivian: What favor costs that much?]

[Evelyn: Emotional debt]

......

The next morning.

Vivian insisted on driving her. "Anything Alexander can do, I can do better."

Evelyn frowned at the bandage on her leg—all her dresses were at Alexander's place.

"I've got the perfect thing!" Vivian pulled out a sky-blue chiffon maxi dress. "It'll cover the wound."

Evelyn held it up skeptically. "The neckline..."

"That's called elegance! Hurry up, we're late."

The bloodmobile departed at 7:30 AM, and rush hour traffic was brutal.

When Evelyn emerged wearing the dress, Vivian whistled.

The fitted silhouette accentuated her curves, with collarbones peeking through the delicate neckline. The chiffon floated around her like morning mist.

"Alexander must be blind." Vivian snapped a dozen photos.

Evelyn sighed. "We'll really be late if you keep this up."

"Almost done!" Vivian adjusted the filter. "Perfection!"

At the bloodmobile, nurses were unloading equipment.

"I'm going in." Evelyn opened the car door.

Vivian waved without looking up, fingers flying across her screen.

Three minutes later, her social media updated:

A nine-photo grid featured Evelyn's profile, the sky-blue dress rippling in the dawn breeze.

Caption: [More radiant after widowhood]

###Chapter 77 What If I Refuse?

Alexander Hamilton's knuckles turned white as he stared at the screenshot Nathan York had sent him.

He snapped his phone shut and grabbed his coat, storming toward the door.

"Stop!" Annabelle Taylor sprang up from the couch and yanked his sleeve. "Where are you going this early?"

He shook her off. "Business at the company."

"What's so urgent?" She narrowed her eyes. "You looked off the moment you checked your phone."

Alexander took a deep breath. "Annabelle, I'm not your prisoner."

"Then why are you acting guilty?" She smirked. "Let me see your phone."

"Why should I?"

"Because I'm your fiancée!" Her voice rose sharply. "Were you talking to Evelyn again?"

A vein pulsed at his temple. "Must you always be so paranoid?"

"Paranoid?" She snatched his phone. "You've changed ever since she came back!"

He reached for it. "Give it back!"

Annabelle dodged, swiping the screen open. "Let's see what has you so worked up—"

Her words died in her throat.

"Happy now?" Alexander's voice was icy. "May I have my phone back?"

She stared at the screen, frozen. "This can't be..."

"The proof is right there." He reclaimed his phone. "May I go now?"

Annabelle lunged, gripping his collar. "You're lying! This has to be fake!"

"Black and white, clear as day." He pried her fingers off one by one. "Enough, Annabelle."

"I don't believe it!" she shrieked. "You must've photoshopped this!"

Alexander straightened his tie. "Think whatever you want."

As he turned to leave, she hurled a vase at him.

It shattered at his feet with a deafening crash.

"Take one step out that door and see what happens!" Her eyes burned with fury.

Alexander slowly turned, his gaze glacial. "Are you done?"

"Not even close!" She blocked his path. "Explain this to me!"

"Nothing to explain." He pushed past her. "Move."

"No!" She barricaded the exit. "Delete everything about Evelyn right now!"

A cold smile curved his lips. "And if I refuse?"
###Chapter 78: Is This Your House?

"I... I..."

Annabelle's gaze darted around the living room before she suddenly grabbed a crystal ornament from the coffee table and pressed it against her abdomen. "If you won't show me your phone, I'll smash it!"

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed.

"You really must see it?"

"Yes!"

"Fine." Alexander tossed his phone into her lap. "Have your fill."

The screen was suspiciously bare.

Only work emails, financial news, and WeChat remained.

Annabelle opened the inbox - nothing but correspondence with Andy Taylor. The pinned WeChat contact showed "Mom," with Margaret Hamilton's latest message about her headaches.

[Mom: These headaches won't stop. What medicine should I take?]
[Alexander: Get checked at the hospital.]
[Mom: No need. Painkillers will do.]
[Alexander: Still not sleeping well?]
[Mom: Don't worry about me. Focus on your work.]

Though brief, Annabelle scrutinized the exchange three times.

"Satisfied?" Alexander snatched back his phone. "Move."

"How dare you speak to me like this? I'm pregnant!"

"Honorable Miss Taylor," Alexander sneered. "Kindly remove your noble foot from blocking the doorway."

"Alexander, you—"

Before she could finish, he yanked her aside and slammed the door behind him.

"Wait!" Annabelle chased him to the entrance. "Take out the trash."

Alexander strode toward the balcony without turning.

The cardboard box contained no garbage.

Evelyn's dress reeked of dead fish slime. Plush toys and succulents mingled together, emitting a putrid stench.

"Why are you still here?" Annabelle leaned against the doorframe.

"You call this trash?"

"What else?" She stroked her belly with a smirk. "My territory tolerates no other woman's belongings."

"According to property law—"

"This is my house!" Annabelle's voice sharpened. "I'll discard whatever I please!"

Alexander turned slowly.

"Your house?"

Her smile froze. "What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said."
###Chapter 79: Evelyn's Medical Textbooks Sold as Scrap

Annabelle stood in the center of the room, arms crossed and chin lifted. "I'm in charge of this house now!"

"Legally, Evelyn is still the lady of this house."

Annabelle scoffed. "If she hadn't stubbornly refused to sign the divorce papers, we'd be married by now!"

Alexander's gaze swept over the empty bookshelf. His voice turned icy. "Where are the medical textbooks?"

"Those heavy old books?" She shrugged. "Sold them to the scrap collector."

"...Say that again."

"I wanted to throw them out, but they were too heavy. So I sold them." Annabelle waved a hand dismissively. "They weren't worth much anyway."

A vein pulsed at Alexander's temple. "You didn't even ask me?"

"Ask what?" She let out a mocking laugh. "Since when have I ever needed your permission for anything?"

"Annabelle!"

Ding-dong—

The doorbell cut through the tension.

Alexander yanked the door open, his expression dark.

Vincent stood on the doorstep, grinning as he hefted a massive audio system. "Morning, Alex! Morning, Annabelle!"

"What are you doing here?"

"Delivering Annabelle's new sound system!" He shook the bulky equipment. "Latest model. Killer sound quality!"

Alexander turned to Annabelle. "Sound system?"

"Of course." She stroked her belly. "For the baby's prenatal music."

Vincent burst out laughing. "Rock music for prenatal education? Planning to raise the next rock legend?"

"Enough jokes. Bring it in."

"On it!"

"Wait." Alexander blocked the doorway. "Take it back."

"Why?"

"The walls are thin. It'll disturb the neighbors."

Vincent froze awkwardly.

Annabelle shoved past Alexander. "Since when can't I play music in my own home? If they don't like it, they can move!"

"Be reasonable."

"I am being reasonable!" She tilted her chin up. "Let them call the police if they dare!"

"You—"

Vincent jumped in. "Hey now, no fighting! You two finally got together. Why the drama?"

Annabelle snorted. "Blame his ex-wife."

"She causing trouble? Didn't you offer her enough money?"

"Playing hard to get." She rolled her eyes. "All that fake nobility makes me sick."

Vincent slapped his thigh. "Leave it to me! Alex, stay out of this. I'll handle it."

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "How?"

"Don't worry. I'll make sure she signs those divorce papers."

Annabelle beamed. "Vincent, dinner's on me when it's done."

"Forget dinner." He grinned, patting her belly. "Just make me the godfather."

"Deal."

Vincent addressed her stomach with mock solemnity. "Listen up, little one. I'm your godfather now. Your parents agreed."

"Vincent." Alexander's voice could freeze hell.

"Yeah? What's up, Alex?"
###Chapter 80: Hands Off Her

"Move that box from the balcony to my car."

Vincent Wilson immediately rolled up his sleeves. "Got it! I'm the best at manual labor!"

"And—" Alexander Hamilton's gaze darkened. "Take the rock audio system too. Don't leave it here."

Vincent froze, his eyes darting between Alexander and Annabelle Taylor.

In the end, he sided with Alexander. "Annabelle, Alex is right. We can't disturb the neighbors. How about this? Once he buys you that villa, I'll personally deliver the sound system. You can party as loud as you want then."

Annabelle's face twisted with displeasure.

Alexander was already impatient. "Vincent, hurry up. I'm on a tight schedule."

"Right away!"

Vincent dashed to the balcony, hoisted the cardboard box, and headed for the door. "Alex, I'll head down first."

"Hmm."

Alexander turned to Annabelle, his eyes sharp. "Since you're pregnant, behave yourself. If it weren't for the baby, I wouldn't have lifted a finger to clean up your cousin's mess. Push me further, and I'll send him straight to jail."

At the mention of her cousin, Annabelle's tone softened. "Alex, Andy—"

"He's at work."

Downstairs, Vincent had already placed the box beside the car.

Alexander unlocked the trunk and loaded it in.

Vincent sidled up, curiosity gleaming in his eyes. "Alex, this box is full of women's clothes?"

Alexander shot him a cold look. "Got a problem with that?"

Vincent immediately shrank back. "N-no, not at all."

"From now on, if Annabelle asks you for favors, check with me first."

"Understood!"

Alexander slid into the driver's seat, fingers tapping the steering wheel. "Vincent."

"Yeah, Alex?"

"Stay out of my divorce."

"Why? That woman's just after your money. Dragging it out means she wants a bigger payout. Leave it to me—"

Alexander's glare cut him off. "What exactly are you planning?"

Vincent flinched. "The usual. Threats and incentives."

"Don't you dare!" Alexander's voice turned icy. "The fault lies with me and Annabelle. She did nothing wrong."

Vincent scoffed. "Nathan said the same thing. But Alex, don't be naive. I checked—her family's average. How much can a doctor earn? She's definitely trying to milk you dry."

"I wish she would ask for money..."

"Huh? What did you say?"

"Nothing. Remember my words. Hands off her."

"Fine, fine. Got it."

Alexander slammed the door and drove off.

Vincent stood there, staring at the brand-new rock audio system, when inspiration struck.

So he couldn't touch her, huh?

Then he'd arrange a "chance encounter" to make her file for divorce herself!

The more he thought about it, the more brilliant the idea seemed.

As for the leading man?

He smoothed his hair in the rearview mirror, flashing a confident grin.

Who else but him?

This honey trap was his to execute!
###Chapter 81: Meet Your Future Sister-in-Law in Ten Minutes

Vincent Wilson was having a lucky day.

He'd been aimlessly strolling the streets when a captivating sight caught his eye.

Near the bloodmobile, a woman in a pale blue dress moved with graceful efficiency. Her upright posture and gentle gestures radiated the quiet confidence of a medical professional.

Whipping out his phone, he snapped several photos of the elegant figure and immediately shared them in his group chat.

The chat exploded.

"Damn, that silhouette is killer!"

"Vincent, we need a front view!"

He typed smugly: "Privacy laws, idiots. Annabelle's a law student—you want Alexander coming after you?"

The mention of Alexander Hamilton silenced the group momentarily.

Then the messages came faster.

"Bet she's a back-view beauty!"

Vincent scoffed. "I've seen her face."

"Well?"

"Let's just say," he paused dramatically, "I might've found my soulmate."

"Meet your sister-in-law in ten minutes."

"Ten minutes? Yeah right!"

Tucking away his phone, Vincent adjusted his collar and strode toward the bloodmobile.

The donation station stood nearly deserted.

Evelyn Carter, still nursing her leg injury, had finished organizing supplies and now sat quietly reading.

Suddenly, shadows fell across her book.

"Hello, are you here to donate? Please register first—" She looked up into amused eyes.

Vincent leaned both hands on her table, invading her space. "Tell me, beautiful, are there any perks to donating blood?"

His cologne overwhelmed her senses.

Evelyn subtly leaned back, though her injury limited her movement. "You'll receive a blood donation certificate and small gifts. Priority access if you ever need transfusions."

He raised an eyebrow. "That sounds like a curse."

Straightening, he flipped through her medical textbook.

She swiftly slid it into a drawer. "You misunderstand."

One glance told her this playboy wasn't here to donate.

"Olivia," she called to a nurse, "this gentleman has questions about donation."

A young nurse hurried over eagerly. "Sir, you're donating? Wonderful! We've had so few today—"

"That few?" Vincent's eyes narrowed. "Quotas to meet?"

"No quotas, but the blood bank's critically low!"

His lips curved. "I'll bring a hundred donors. Give me her contact info."
###Chapter 82: Blood Bank Crisis

Vincent Wilson's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk as his intense gaze locked onto Evelyn Carter.

"One hundred people. Four hundred cc each. Enough?" The corner of his mouth curled into a smirk. "In exchange for your contact information."

Olivia's eyes widened in shock. "This is—"

"Too little?" Vincent arched an eyebrow. "Then two hundred. Or three hundred, if you prefer."

Evelyn frowned and turned to Olivia. "Is the blood bank running low?"

"Yes, Dr. Carter," Olivia fretted, wringing her hands. "We've admitted several high-risk maternity cases recently. They might need transfusions at any moment. If we have to request emergency supplies, there may not be enough time..."

Evelyn knew those cases well. One of them was a pregnant woman with placenta previa—a condition that could lead to severe hemorrhage without warning.

Vincent suddenly slammed his palm on the desk. "Five hundred!"

Olivia waved her hands frantically. "No, no, that's against regulations—"

"Deal." Evelyn cut her off, meeting Vincent's gaze head-on. "Can you guarantee all donors will be voluntary?"

Vincent chuckled, his tone teasing. "What, afraid I'll drag people here by force?"

Ignoring his jest, Evelyn swiftly scribbled something on a sheet of paper and placed it facedown on the desk.

"You can read this only after the five hundredth donation."

Vincent pressed a finger against the corner of the paper, intrigued. "How interesting."

Within half an hour, a line of donors stretched all the way to the hospital entrance.

Rows of young office workers filled out forms and underwent check-ups in orderly fashion.

Olivia gaped. "Are these all your employees?"

"Paid leave. Double year-end bonuses." Vincent winked at Evelyn. "What's the count now?"

Evelyn continued writing without pause. "Four hundred ninety-eight."

The nurses' station buzzed with activity. Bags of donated blood quickly piled into a small mountain.

"Five hundred!" Olivia jumped up excitedly. "The blood bank is saved!"

Vincent triumphantly lifted the note. "Time to fulfill your promise, beautiful."

He eagerly flipped over the paper—only for his smile to freeze.

Written clearly on it was the appointment hotline for the downtown blood donation center.
###Chapter 83: The Memory of Her Has Changed

"What the hell is this?"

"My contact information."

Vincent Wilson flipped the note over and laughed in disbelief. "A message in a bottle?!"

Evelyn Carter nodded. "Yes."

"Who even uses this anymore? No phone number? No email?"

Evelyn explained softly, "You didn’t specify what kind of contact information. But I can promise I’ll reply if I receive your message."

......

Vincent stomped his foot in frustration.

Alexander Hamilton had long grown accustomed to this uninvited guest.

Vincent was a few years younger than him. Though he had an older brother, the brother lived abroad most of the time. Since childhood, Vincent had followed Alexander around like a shadow, closer than a real brother.

Alexander shook his head. "Finally, someone who can put you in your place. Good."

"Good? She’s clearly messing with me!"

"She’s not wrong. A message in a bottle can reach someone. The odds are just... low."

"Low? It’s like finding a needle in a haystack! Since when does Vincent Wilson get treated like this? You have to help me, Alex."

Alexander didn’t even look up from the documents he was reviewing. "How? Should I kidnap her and deliver her to your bed?"

"Sounds perfect."

Alexander glared. "Perfectly illegal."

At the mention of breaking the law, Vincent suddenly perked up. "Wow, Alex. You’ve really become Annabelle’s biggest fanboy, huh? Now that she’s a lawyer, you won’t even joke about breaking the rules."

The pen in Alexander’s hand paused mid-stroke.

"...Keeping you in line is my responsibility. It has nothing to do with anyone else."

Vincent scoffed. "Yeah, right. Everyone knows how you feel about Annabelle. Honestly, I envy you."

"Envy what?"

"That you have someone you love. I’ve dated plenty, but none of them ever meant anything."

Alexander suddenly set down his pen.

He leaned back in his chair, his gaze heavy. "Vincent, let me ask you something."

"Go ahead."

"What do you think I like about Annabelle?"

"Her looks, obviously."

"There are plenty more beautiful women out there."

Vincent thought for a moment. "Then it must be her personality? Annabelle’s temper is legendary—she’d climb a tree in three steps just to yell at someone. Scarier than a school principal."

"She is strong-willed."

"Strong-willed? She’s downright domineering." Vincent lowered his voice. "Remember her thing with Richard?"

"Yeah."

"Know why they broke up?"

Alexander said, "Incompatible personalities?"

"Not even close." Vincent smirked. "Richard couldn’t handle her. Too many guys were after her, and he couldn’t take it. He was the one who ended things."

Alexander knew this.

She always had a crowd of "just friends" around her, and he’d felt his share of jealousy.

But Annabelle would just say, "They’re all like brothers."

Men understood men. There was no such thing as pure friendship.

"That’s why you’re impressive. You waited patiently and finally got your happy ending—even divorced for her. Guys like you are rare, Alex."

Alexander shot him a warning look.

Vincent finally caught himself. "Wait, why are you asking this? Don’t you know why you like her?"

Alexander shook his head. "Lately, I’ve realized... she’s not quite the same as I remember."
###Chapter 84: A Fateful Reunion

"You mean how she looked as a teenager?"

"No, earlier." Alexander Hamilton's fingers tapped lightly against his glass. "Around seven or eight, a little girl with pigtails. I got lost in the woods during a family trip to visit our ancestors. She took my hand and led me out."

Gregory Wilson's mouth fell open. "So you and Annabelle were connected that far back?"

"Yes." Alexander's gaze softened. "I told myself then that I'd protect her for the rest of my life."

"You kept that promise."

"But..."

"But what?"

Alexander shook his head. "Nothing."

Only recently had he realized how sharply drawn the line was between friendship and love.

As friends, he could stand quietly by her side, content just to see her happy.

Now, these feelings felt like invisible chains, tightening around him until he could barely breathe.

...It was suffocating.

In the past, picking up Evelyn Carter from the hospital after work had filled him with anticipation.

Though reserved by nature, Evelyn revealed a sharp wit once you got to know her. She could make even mundane topics fascinating, switching effortlessly to her professional demeanor when discussing medical cases. Years of working with expectant mothers had honed her natural empathy.

There had only ever been two women in his life. In terms of integrity and kindness, Evelyn surpassed Annabelle by far.

As for Annabelle...

She was no longer the innocent girl from his memories.

"Alex, are you going to help me or not?" Gregory stamped his foot impatiently. "This girl is different—all the others were too easy. I'm serious about her!"

Alexander shot him a cold look. "Don't play with someone's feelings unless you mean it. Don't make the same mistakes I did."

"I do mean it! You'd understand if you saw her. That angelic face, but with a body that—"

"Is that all you care about?"

"Of course not!" Gregory pulled out his phone. "She actually messaged me through a virtual bottle—that playful attitude is exactly my type. Look at this photo... Hey, what are you—"

Alexander snatched the phone, his expression darkening instantly. "This is the girl you're talking about?"

"Yeah. You know her?"

In silence, Alexander turned his own phone screen toward Gregory.

Gregory leaned in, eyes widening. "Isn't that the girl from Vivian Dempsey's social media? Wait, if she's friends with Vivian, this'll be even easier. I'll just ask Vivian for her contact—"

"Stop." Alexander's voice could have frozen hell over.

"Why?"

Why?

A humorless smile curled Alexander's lips.

"Because she's my wife."

###Chapter 85 Go apologize to Evelyn

The night was deep and still when Alexander Hamilton pushed open the door of the old mansion, his fingertips still chilled from the office air.

"Young master, you're back." Auntie Marry took his coat.

"Where's Mother?"

"Madam is copying scriptures in the study."

Alexander frowned. His mother had never believed in such things.

When he opened the study door, his breath caught.

Margaret Hamilton sat at the desk, her slender frame accentuated by the simple homewear. Silver strands now mingled with her once raven-black hair, veins visible on her hand as she held the brush.

"Mother."

Margaret didn't pause her writing. "What brings you back so suddenly?"

"You said you had a headache."

"I took medicine." She dipped the brush in ink. "Your company keeps you busy. There was no need for this trip."

Alexander moved behind her, reaching to massage her temples.

"Don't." Margaret turned her head away. "We both know who you learned this technique for."

Outside, the osmanthus tree rustled in the wind.

"This will always be your home," he said, voice tight.

Margaret finally set down the brush. When she turned, her eyes were red-rimmed. "Then what was Evelyn to you? What about that unborn child?"

A corner of the rice paper lifted in the breeze.

"That girl Evelyn..." Her throat worked. "Her hands were so steady delivering babies, her gaze so tender holding newborns... How much pain must she have felt to..."

Ink bloomed dark across the paper.

Alexander's knuckles turned white.

"What did I promise Evelyn? That you two were clean!" Margaret suddenly hurled the inkstone to the floor. "Now the whole hospital knows my son forced his wife to abort for his childhood sweetheart!"

Black splatters stained the carpet.

"Please calm down—"

"Get out!" Margaret broke into violent coughs. "Since you chose Annabelle, stop pretending to be a filial son before me!"

Auntie Marry rushed in at the noise, gasping at the mess.

As Alexander bent to pick up the shattered inkstone, his mother's hoarse voice came from behind. "Tomorrow... go apologize to Evelyn."

Moonlight through the window lattice stretched his shadow long across the floor.
###Chapter 86: Are You Having Regrets?

The mention of their unborn child felt like a blade piercing through Alexander Hamilton's chest.

His fingers trembled slightly.

Margaret Hamilton scoffed. "Who are you trying to fool with this pitiful act now?"

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "That was my child too."

"Oh? So you do remember."

"If I had arrived just ten minutes earlier—"

"It wouldn't have mattered," Margaret cut him off. "Evelyn Carter was determined to cut ties with you completely. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have gone this far."

It felt as if a piece of his heart had been carved out.

He pressed a hand hard against his chest, each breath tasting of blood.

That day in the hospital corridor, Evelyn's eyes had said it all.

Even if he had stopped her then, the outcome wouldn’t have changed.

Margaret suddenly stepped closer. "Is the child in Annabelle Taylor’s belly really yours?"

"Of course not!" Alexander snapped his head up. "She was already five months pregnant when she returned. We hadn’t seen each other in years."

A mocking smile twisted Margaret’s lips. "So you sacrificed your own flesh and blood to raise someone else’s child?"

Alexander's knuckles cracked audibly.

"This was your choice. I hope you think it was worth it."

A shrill ringtone shattered the tension.

"Annabelle" flashed on the screen.

"Answer it," Margaret turned away.

Alexander declined the call immediately. "Everything was already arranged this morning."

The phone vibrated furiously again.

When it rang for the third time, Margaret massaged her temples. "Just pick up. She won’t stop until you do."

"I’ll turn it off."

"If you dare shut it off, she’ll storm over here the next second," Margaret sneered. "And I have no desire to see her right now."

Alexander strode into the living room with a darkened expression.

The moment he answered, Annabelle’s shrill voice pierced his eardrums. "Why aren’t you answering? Who are you with? Men or women? How many? Are you doing something shady?"

"......"

"Say something, Alexander! Your silence means guilt!"

"......"

"You’re admitting it, aren’t you? Are you seeing that Dr. Carter again—"

"Yes! I came to see Evelyn!" Alexander exploded suddenly. "Is that what you wanted to hear?"

The sound of shattering glass came through the phone.

"Fine, Alexander! Who was it that chased after me for over twenty years? Who got on his knees begging for another chance?"

"I never begged!" Alexander’s voice was hoarse. "By the time you got married and pregnant, I already had a wife and child!"

"Then why did you still choose me in the end?" Annabelle let out a sharp laugh. "Admit it—you could never forget me!"

Alexander chuckled lowly.

"What’s so funny?" Annabelle’s voice suddenly wavered. "Unless... you’re having regrets?"
###Chapter 87: I'll Ruin Her Reputation!

Alexander Hamilton's fingers traced the phone screen absently. His frown deepened.

"Annabelle, our issues can't be solved by taking a few days apart."

Her light laughter floated through the receiver. "Miss me already?"

"Mother hasn't been well. I want to spend more time with her."

"Oh?" Annabelle's voice turned icy. "Just you?"

"Yes."

"What about Dr. Carter?"

"She has her own life."

The answer seemed to please her. "Good boy. But Alexander, don't let me catch you with another woman."

His laugh was bitter. "I don't even have female assistants at the company anymore. What more do you want?"

"That ex-wife of yours," Annabelle purred, "until those divorce papers are signed, I won't sleep easy. You know how I hate people touching what's mine."

"Don't you dare—"

"Scared?" She chuckled. "Behave, and she stays safe. Otherwise..."

"Annabelle!"

"I'll ruin her reputation!" Her voice spiked suddenly. "Actually, I'll have my driver bring me over now. As your future mother-in-law, I should visit dear Margaret when she's ill."

Alexander shot to his feet. "She needs rest!"

"Don't worry, I'll be quiet." Triumph laced her words. "Seeing her grandchild might improve her condition."

"You—"

The line went dead.

He hurled the phone onto the couch, knuckles whitening.

"She's coming?"

Margaret Hamilton stood at the stairwell, pale-faced.

"Mother..." His voice cracked.

"Auntie Marry!" Margaret called sharply.

"Yes, ma'am?" The housekeeper rushed from the kitchen, flour dusting her hands.

"Pack our bags. We're going to a hotel."

"Now?" Auntie Marry glanced at the clock. "It's nearly nine—"

"Throw out the soup." Margaret's tone turned glacial. "We're making space for our... guest."

Understanding dawned when Alexander muttered "Miss Taylor." Auntie Marry's expression darkened.

"I'll pack immediately!" She fumbled with her apron. "Ten minutes, ma'am!"

"Just bring essentials." Margaret massaged her temples. "The sooner the better."

"Yes, yes!"

Silence swallowed the living room.

Alexander watched his mother's frail frame, throat working. "I'm sorry..."

Margaret didn't turn. Just shook her head slowly.
###Chapter 88: The Unborn Child

Auntie Marry tossed her apron over the back of a chair and hurried toward Margaret Hamilton's bedroom to start packing.

In the living room, Margaret sat on the sofa with her eyes closed. Her fingers moved methodically over the prayer beads in her hand, her lips murmuring silent words.

Alexander Hamilton stood before his mother, hesitating.

Finally, he turned and walked toward the bedroom.

Auntie Marry had already neatly folded several garments and was placing them into a suitcase.

"Alexander."

"Madam."

"Let me help you."

"No need," Auntie Marry waved him off. "I can manage."

His hand hovered midair before slowly withdrawing.

"Auntie Marry... are you afraid of Annabelle?"

Her hands stilled. Her gaze flickered. "N-no, of course not."

"Please, speak freely."

Auntie Marry sighed. "Alexander, I've served the Hamiltons for thirty years. Your mother treats me like family. There are things I must say."

"Go on."

"Miss Annabelle..." She lowered her voice. "She isn't the right match for you."

His brow furrowed. "Why?"

"Marriage isn't like dating. Miss Annabelle has always been... impulsive." She hesitated. "Do you remember that incident with the chicks outside your school?"

"I do."

"I saw it with my own eyes. She got into an argument with the vendor and smashed an entire crate of chicks with a brick." Auntie Marry's hands trembled slightly. "Those poor things were still chirping..."

Alexander's face darkened.

"Her father paid compensation, and that was the end of it. But some things can't be fixed with money." Her eyes reddened. "Ever since your mother learned about Evelyn's miscarriage, she's been devastated."

The word struck him like a knife.

That scene at the hospital flashed before his eyes again—the vivid red staining Evelyn's palms.

"Your mother never cared about marrying into high society. She always thought Evelyn was perfect for you." Auntie Marry wiped her eyes. "Evelyn gave you three years of her life, and this is how it ended... It breaks your mother's heart."

The sound of prayer beads clicking together echoed clearly from the living room.
###Chapter 89: Baby Journal

Auntie Marry finished packing with practiced efficiency.

"Young master, Mrs. Hamilton and I will leave first. The mistress has been emotionally unstable lately. Seeing Miss Annabelle might trigger another sleepless night."

Margaret Hamilton's voice carried from the doorway. "Auntie Marry, don't overpack. We can buy anything we need."

"Understood, ma'am. Almost done."

Leaning closer to Alexander Hamilton, Auntie Marry lowered her voice. "I spoke out of turn today. But... please reconsider."

She hurried toward the exit with the suitcase. "Ma'am, we're ready."

"Good."

Alexander intercepted them, taking the luggage. "Let me drive you."

Margaret shook her head. "No need. Auntie Marry can call a cab."

He was already striding toward the garage, popping the trunk open.

A cardboard box came into view.

Evelyn Carter's clothes.

Margaret followed and recognized them instantly. "Aren't these Evelyn's? Why are they tossed in a box? And this—"

Dark red stains had congealed into crusted patches, reeking of iron, soaking through a pale yellow sweater.

The other garments fared no better—ruined beyond recognition.

Margaret's lips curled in cold understanding.

Alexander's jaw tightened as he moved the box to the passenger seat before loading his mother's luggage.

He opened the rear door. "Mother, Auntie Marry, get in. I'll take you to the mountain resort. The environment there is peaceful."

"..."

"Mother?"

Margaret met her son's gaze. "Alexander, are you truly divorcing Evelyn to be with Annabelle?"

"I..."

"The truth."

"..."

She sighed. "If you choose to spend your life with her, keep her in line. I'm over sixty. I won't be driven from my own home."

Alexander's face burned. "I'll resolve this quickly and bring you back."

The car glided toward Cloud Terrace Resort.

Thirty minutes later, in the lobby.

Alexander checked them in. "Two adjoining suites."

The receptionist bowed. "Mr. Hamilton, only two rooms remain on the eighth floor."

"Fine."

When the room keys were handed over, Alexander frowned at the numbers—the same suites he'd shared with Annabelle last time.

"Is there a problem, sir?"

"Get me a suite on the second floor, near the restaurant."

"Apologies, sir. That one's booked."

"Contact the guest. Say there's a maintenance issue and offer a room change. If they refuse, compensate triple."

"Right away."

With the new key, he rejoined his mother in the lounge.

"Let me escort you up."

Margaret asked, "Where will you stay tonight? The family estate or your penthouse?"

He paused. "I'll remain here."

"Not going back?"

"...I need time to think."

From her bag, Margaret produced a notebook. "I found this in the box. Read it when you can."

"What is it?"

"A baby journal."

Alexander blinked. "Pardon?"

"A pregnancy diary. Evelyn must have bought it. She'd already filled several pages."
###Chapter 90: My Little One

After escorting his mother and Auntie Marry back to their rooms, Alexander Hamilton stood alone in the hallway.

His fingers lingered on the doorknob for several seconds before he finally pushed open his own door.

The faint scent of disinfectant lingered in the air—evidence of the hotel’s recent cleaning. Yet his gaze was drawn irresistibly to the nightstand, where Evelyn Carter’s thermos had once sat.

He loosened his tie and tossed it onto the bed, then pulled a diary from his inner suit pocket.

The leather cover showed signs of wear, clearly having been opened countless times. He never knew Evelyn kept such a diary.

His phone screen glared brightly in the dim room. Annabelle Taylor’s name flashed insistently, like a relentless curse. He silenced it with a swipe and flung it to the foot of the bed.

Two Anns—one gentle as moonlight, the other scorching like the sun.

The irony struck him suddenly.

After twenty years of friendship, he had never truly seen Annabelle for who she was. Or perhaps, he had willfully ignored the signs of her obsession.

When the phone finally died, its screen going dark, he exhaled in relief.

He switched on the bedside lamp, its warm glow falling over the diary. The moment he opened it, Evelyn’s handwriting stole his breath.

"May you find peace and joy in this world.
May starlight always dwell in your eyes.
May someone love you as life itself.
May you never endure the pain your mother has known.
—For my precious one."

Her script mirrored her—delicate yet strong, the final stroke lifting slightly like a smile.

His fingertips brushed the words, the texture of the paper reminding him of the rubber gloves she wore during surgeries.

The first entry was dated three days after their wedding anniversary.

"HCG positive. I stared at the test results for half an hour. As a doctor, I know exactly what this means—but as an expectant mother, I panicked. How do I tell Alexander? He’s been so distracted lately. Maybe I should wait for the right moment."

Further in, her writing grew lighter.

"Delivered twins today. The mother held my hand and cried. It made me imagine myself on that delivery table in a few months—and I felt a flicker of excitement. Little one, I sneaked some ice cream today. Don’t tell Daddy."

"Woke up with heartburn and tiptoed to the bathroom to retch. When I came back, he was sleeping like a child, his lashes casting tiny shadows. Suddenly, I hoped our baby would look just like him."

"Scheduled the NT scan. My colleagues tease me for being overly cautious, but I keep double-checking the equipment settings. Little one, your mom will be the most skilled OB-GYN—and the one who loves you most."

Each word was a dull blade, slowly carving open his chest. The moments he’d missed, the joys she’d experienced alone—all transformed into an ache that spread through him.

His thumb froze over the words "my little one."

His throat tightened, forcing him to pause and take a shaky breath.

The entries grew hesitant.

"Annabelle was hospitalized after a car accident. Alexander stayed at the hospital all night. This morning, when he came home to change, there was lipstick on his collar. Little one, Daddy’s busy right now. Let’s wait a little longer, okay?"

The page blurred. Only then did he realize his tears had fallen onto the diary. He hurriedly wiped them with his sleeve, smudging the ink.
###Chapter 91: Tears-Stained Pages

Alexander Hamilton's fingers trembled slightly.

The latter half of the notebook was empty, save for the jagged edges of torn pages. The uneven gaps resembled silent screams, betraying the emotional turmoil of the person who had ripped them apart.

He obsessively examined each page.

Then, under the dim lamplight, faint indentations caught his attention.

"A pencil!" He snatched up the hotel phone, his voice hoarse and unrecognizable. "Bring me a pencil immediately!"

The front desk delivered one without delay.

Holding his breath, he tilted the pencil and lightly shaded the paper. As the graphite dust spread, lines of text gradually emerged—

Row after row of "I'm sorry."

Each stroke was pressed so deeply into the page that some words had blurred from water stains, leaving wrinkled traces behind.

Alexander's chest tightened as if struck by a hammer.

He could almost see Evelyn curled up on that bed on a rainy night, her tears soaking the pillow. She had painstakingly written those apologies—perhaps begging forgiveness from the unborn child, or perhaps bidding farewell to the version of herself that had once loved him so deeply.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Mr. Hamilton," the front desk clerk's voice trembled, "Miss Carter has been looking for you..."

"Which Miss Carter?" he reflexively asked.

"Your... wife," the clerk corrected timidly. "She said she'd fire me if you didn't take the call..."

A shrill female voice suddenly cut through the line: "Where is he? Are you all deaf?!"

Alexander's gaze turned icy.

He heard Annabelle's hysterical shrieking in the background, mingled with the clerk's stifled sobs. The grating noise overlapped with the tear-stained pages before him, twisting his stomach into knots.

"Give her the phone." Every word dripped with frost.

The pencil slipped from his fingers, rolling across the "I'm sorry" and casting a long, dark shadow.
###Chapter 92: You Still Claim You Weren't Thinking About Her?

The call connected, and Annabelle's shrill voice pierced through the phone. "Alexander Hamilton! How dare you ignore my calls?!"

"Annabelle," Alexander massaged his temples. "Wait in the lobby. We need to talk."

"The lobby? You expect a pregnant woman to wait there? Which room are you in? I'm coming up now!"

"I'll come down to you."

The balcony overlooked the valley where Evelyn had clearly heard their last argument. He couldn't risk Annabelle disturbing his mother upstairs.

"No! I'm going to your room!"

"Then I'll have them prepare another—"

"Alexander!" Her voice turned razor-sharp. "What are you hiding in there? Another woman?!"

"There's nothing."

"Then why won't you let me see?" She suddenly turned to the front desk. "Tell me which room Mr. Hamilton is in!"

"Don't involve them." His tone turned icy.

"Defending her now?" Annabelle sneered. "Just a receptionist—or is there something between you two?"

"Annabelle," Alexander took a deep breath. "Why do you always assume I'm involved with other women? Have I ever given you reason to doubt me?"

"Dignity?" She scoffed. "I'll find out myself!"

Shoving past the receptionist, she typed in Alexander's ID number.

"You're staying in Evelyn's old room!" Her voice turned shrill. "And you claim you weren't thinking about her?!"

Alexander rushed downstairs, intercepting her at the elevator.

"Is Evelyn in your room?" Annabelle raged, trying to push past him. "I'll tear that bitch's face off!"

The elevator doors suddenly opened.

Auntie Marry rushed out in panic. "Young master! Your mother's condition is worsening!"

Alexander's chest tightened. "What happened?"

"Her headache is severe, and the ambulance hasn't arrived—"

"I'll drive her to the hospital." He turned decisively. "Auntie Marry, help her downstairs."

Annabelle yanked his sleeve. "You're not leaving! We settle this now!"

"Let go!" He roared. "This is an emergency!"

"They called an ambulance!" She threw herself on the floor, clinging to his leg. "You're not going anywhere!"

Alexander struggled but hesitated, mindful of her pregnant belly.
###Chapter 93: Confrontation

Alexander Hamilton's temple throbbed with visible veins. "Annabelle, let go!"

"No!"

Annabelle Taylor clung desperately to his leg, her nails digging into his flesh. "You dare ignore my calls now? If I don't teach you a lesson today, what's next?"

Auntie Marry wrung her hands in distress. "Miss Taylor, Mrs. Hamilton is in so much pain she might faint—"

"Shut up!" Annabelle snapped. "Who gave a servant the right to interrupt?"

Auntie Marry's face drained of color.

After twenty years of service to the Hamilton family, even Alexander addressed her respectfully as "Auntie Marry." Never had she endured such humiliation.

The wail of an ambulance grew louder.

The receptionist rushed in. "Mr. Hamilton, the ambulance is here!"

As Alexander moved to leave, Annabelle yanked him off balance.

Seeing this, Auntie Marry turned and ran outside.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Evelyn Carter adjusting her gloves.

"Young Madam?!" Auntie Marry gasped.

Evelyn looked up, her eyes widening above her mask. "Is Mom okay?"

"She had a terrible headache and just collapsed—"

"Which floor?"

"Eighth."

Evelyn signaled to the paramedics. "Bring the stretcher."

She strode toward the elevator, her white coat billowing behind her.

Her steps faltered at the scene before her.

Alexander was struggling to pry Annabelle's hands away. When he spotted Evelyn, his expression froze. "You—"

"Perfect!" Annabelle shrieked, pounding his leg. "So this was planned all along!"

"Stop this madness!" Alexander roared.

Ding—

The elevator doors slid open.

Evelyn walked past them without a glance, but the stretcher team was blocked by the struggling pair.

"Move," she said coldly.

Alexander bent to lift Annabelle, only for her to sink her teeth into his wrist.

"Domestic violence! Help me—" Annabelle wailed hysterically.

The paramedics exchanged uneasy glances. "Dr. Carter..."

Evelyn removed her gloves. "Take the stairs."

The young men hoisted the stretcher without hesitation.

Auntie Marry caught her arm. "Young Madam, your leg injury—"

"It's fine." Evelyn was already heading for the emergency exit.

Alexander's pupils contracted at the glimpse of bandages beneath her skirt. "Your leg—"

"Handle this." Evelyn didn't look back. "The patient can't wait."

Her figure vanished around the stairwell corner, leaving only the echo of hurried footsteps behind.
###Chapter 94: Race Against Death

Margaret Hamilton's face turned as pale as parchment.

"Flashlight," Evelyn Carter extended her hand.

Her assistant swiftly passed her a medical penlight.

She pried open Margaret's eyelids to examine her pupils, her frown deepening. "Blood pressure?"

"Still dropping. Currently 50/90."

"Administer oxygen immediately."

"Understood."

Auntie Marry paced anxiously until Evelyn finished her examination. "Young Madam, what's wrong with Mrs. Hamilton—"

"Prepare for stroke emergency protocols." Evelyn issued rapid orders. "Contact the hospital to clear the VIP lane. Keep her stabilized during transport."

Male orderlies sprang into action, carefully transferring Margaret onto a stretcher bed.

"Preliminary diagnosis: acute cerebral hemorrhage." Evelyn spared a brief explanation.

Auntie Marry's face drained of color. "Is...is it serious?"

"Life-threatening." Evelyn's tone was urgent. "How long has she been like this?"

"Since..." Auntie Marry hesitated. "Since Master Alexander announced his marriage to Miss Annabelle..."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "Why wasn't I told sooner?"

"Mrs. Hamilton said...she couldn't face you."

Evelyn's chest heaved. "Prepare for transport! Auntie Marry, ride with us."

The elevator doors suddenly slid open.

Alexander Hamilton burst out alone, his eyes bloodshot.

Evelyn directed the stretcher into the elevator. The cramped space forced her to press against Alexander.

The man leaned back, creating what little distance he could.

"Thanks." Evelyn's gratitude was clipped.

"My mother—"

"Cerebral hemorrhage. Risk of paralysis or death at any moment." She stared straight ahead. "Every second counts now."

The elevator's arrival chime cut off his next question.

Evelyn charged out first, clearing a path through the hotel lobby. As the stretcher loaded into the ambulance, she moved to board—then searing pain shot through her right leg.

She collapsed hard onto the icy pavement.
###Chapter 95 I'm your wife!

The ambulance screamed into the emergency bay.

Evelyn Carter pressed hard on Margaret Hamilton's bleeding head wound, the gauze already soaked through with blood.

"Blood pressure still dropping!" a nurse shouted urgently.

Before the wheels fully stopped, Evelyn leaped out. "Now! Straight to the OR!"

She staggered, nearly collapsing to her knees.

Alexander Hamilton caught her by the waist. "Careful."

Evelyn shoved him away. "Forget me—get the stretcher!"

The OR doors slammed shut.

Leaning against the wall, Evelyn noticed her lab coat's hem was drenched in blood.

"Young madam..." Auntie Marry offered tissues.

Evelyn took them, mechanically wiping her hands. "She'll be fine."

A commotion erupted down the hallway.

"Alexander, you can't leave!" Annabelle Taylor clung to his sleeve. "My stomach hurts terribly..."

Alexander's face darkened. "Let go."

"Are you going to her again? I'm your wife!"

Evelyn turned away.

A nurse rushed over with a clipboard. "Family member? We need signatures!"

Auntie Marry stamped her foot. "Young master! Your mother's in critical condition!"

Alexander wrenched free from Annabelle's grasp.

Annabelle shrieked as she fell. "My baby!"

Alexander froze mid-step.

"I'll sign." Evelyn snatched the clipboard, scrawling her name.

The nurse hesitated. "But—"

"I'll take responsibility."

The OR doors reopened. A doctor peered out. "Emergency transfusion needed—blood bank's low!"

Evelyn rolled up her sleeve. "Take mine. Same blood type."

As the needle pierced her vein, she saw Alexander carrying Annabelle toward the OB-GYN department.

Blood flowed slowly through the clear tube.

Like the wound in her heart that would never heal, bleeding anew.
###Chapter 96: The Bloodstain

"Dr. Carter?" The nurse looked up in surprise. "Are you the patient's family?"

"Yes. She's my mother-in-law."

Evelyn quickly signed the consent form and handed it back. "The patient has had persistent headaches for about a month. Today, she suffered a sudden stroke. Her blood pressure was 50/90 upon arrival. She received oxygen for 45 minutes during transport. Current readings are 70/110 with oxygen saturation at 86%."

The nurse nodded. "I'll inform Dr. Porter immediately."

"Thank you."

The ER doors closed again, leaving the hallway in silence.

Auntie Marry wrung her hands, her gaze flickering toward Alexander. "Madam, thank goodness you were here today..."

"Auntie Marry, I need to tend to my wound."

"Oh!" The older woman finally noticed the blood-soaked bandage on Evelyn's leg. "How did this happen?"

The white gauze was nearly saturated with crimson.

The injury hadn't fully healed. After today's ordeal—climbing stairs, falling, pushing the gurney—it was no surprise it had reopened.

"It's nothing serious. I'll get it redressed in the surgical ward."

"Let me come with you—"

"Stay here." Evelyn lowered her voice. "In case the ER needs anything."

Auntie Marry hesitated, glancing at Alexander again.

Her young master was completely entangled with Annabelle. Utterly useless.

"Then I'll make this quick."

The surgical ward was on the first floor.

Which meant passing that stairwell.

When the elevator doors opened, chaos assaulted her senses. At the center of the crowd, Alexander's veins bulged as Annabelle wept dramatically.

"Cheater." "Homewrecker." "Disgrace to the medical profession." The whispers swirled like vultures.

"Excuse me."

The spectators parted automatically.

She strode into the elevator and hit the close button.

Thankfully, no one noticed her.

As the elevator descended, Evelyn leaned against the wall and exhaled sharply.

"Dr. Carter?!" Olivia intercepted her in the lobby. "What— Oh God! Your leg!"

"Help me to surgery."

In the treatment room, Dr. Porter sucked in a breath when he peeled back the bandage. "Evelyn, this wound—"

"Unavoidable circumstances."

"This is reckless!" He pressed an alcohol-soaked gauze firmly against the injury. "At this rate, you'll definitely scar!"

Evelyn clenched her teeth as cold sweat trailed down her temple.

In the mirror, she saw her pallid face and the vicious gash on her leg.

Just like her marriage.

It would leave a permanent mark. One that could never be erased.
###Chapter 97: What Are You Doing?!

Olivia's face fell instantly. "A scar? Dr. Porter, you're the best surgeon—can't you do something? Dr. Carter has had enough bad luck lately..."

Dr. Porter scowled. "Now you're worried? A doctor who can't even protect herself has no business saving others. That's the first lesson they teach in medical school!"

Evelyn clenched her jaw, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. "The patient was having a stroke. Between a scar and paralysis, I'd choose the scar."

Dr. Porter's hands stilled momentarily.

No one understood the severity of strokes better than he did—one misstep could mean lifelong disability.

The pressure from the antiseptic cotton finally lightened.

After finishing the bandaging, Dr. Porter adjusted his glasses. "If this wound reopens, not even divine intervention will help."

Evelyn nodded obediently. "Understood, Dr. Porter."

"Ahem..." Dr. Porter suddenly lowered his voice. "Be mindful of... martial relations. Tell your husband to exercise restraint..."

Evelyn's ears burned. "...Yes."

In the hallway, Olivia supported her as they walked slowly. "Dr. Carter, why didn't you tell Dr. Porter you're divorced? The way he was tiptoeing around the subject was hilarious—"

Evelyn shot her a look. "Is divorce some badge of honor? Should I broadcast my ex-husband's infidelity over the PA system?"

Olivia stuck out her tongue. "Fair point... Oh! Dr. Wilson!"

Gregory's white coat flashed at the end of the corridor before he appeared before them.

His gaze landed on Evelyn's bandaged arm. "What happened?"

"Emergency during blood draw," she said lightly.

"Treated?"

"Dr. Porter handled it personally."

Gregory's brow relaxed slightly. "Can you walk?"

"Yes."

"No!" Olivia interjected. "Dr. Porter said minimal movement!"

Without another word, Gregory bent and scooped Evelyn into his arms.

She gasped, instinctively clutching his collar.

"Don't be afraid," he murmured.

"I'm not—"

"Then why the scream?"

Evelyn turned her face away. "Too many eyes in a hospital."

Gregory chuckled. "If rumors spread, I'll explain."

"How?"

"As..." He paused. "Colleagues?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Colleagues don't stand this close."

"Then friends?"

"Dr. Wilson," she met his gaze squarely, "friends don't confess in karaoke bars."

His arms tightened. "So we can't even be friends?"

"I don't do blurred lines." She pushed against his chest. "Put me down."

Instead of releasing her, Gregory adjusted his hold, lifting her higher.

"Then let's not be friends," he said softly. "I never wanted to be—"

"What are you doing?!"
###Chapter 98 Put Her Down
Evelyn heard familiar footsteps behind her. The crisp sound of leather shoes echoed against the marble floor.

She turned to see Alexander Hamilton standing at the corridor's bend. His suit jacket draped casually over his arm, tie loosened around his neck.

He strode forward, reaching out. "Let me take her."

Gregory Wilson sidestepped, keeping Evelyn out of reach. "Mr. Hamilton, mind your manners."

Alexander's gaze turned icy. "Dr. Wilson."

"Surprised you remember me."

"You were at the restaurant that night."

Gregory smirked. "Indeed. Quite the spectacle—you causing a scene with your pregnant companion."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "That's my wife you're holding, Doctor."

"Wife?" Gregory arched an eyebrow. "Then what does the child in her womb call you?"

Alexander's face darkened. "Put. Her. Down."

"Dr. Carter injured her leg."

"I'm her husband. I'll take care of her."

"Does your conscience ever trouble you, Mr. Hamilton?"

The air grew heavy as Alexander clenched his fists.

Evelyn pushed against Gregory's chest. "Let me down."

"Let him try anything."

"Now."

After a tense moment, Gregory carefully lowered her to the floor.

Alexander immediately stepped between them, extending a hand. "Thank you for assisting my wife, Doctor. I'll treat you to tea sometime."

Gregory eyed the offered hand before shaking it. "The pleasure's mine."

Curious nurses peeked from doorways as staff passed through the busy corridor.

Evelyn spoke through gritted teeth. "Follow me."

Alexander gave Gregory one last glare before turning away.

She walked slowly, favoring her injured leg. He caught up easily. "Let me carry you."

"No." She dodged his touch. "Annabelle will throw another tantrum. She vowed to ruin me—I can't risk it."

His eyes dropped. "I'll call a nurse then."

"Unnecessary." She flagged down a passing nurse. "A wheelchair, please."

Within minutes, the nurse returned with one.

As Evelyn settled into the chair, Alexander moved to push it. The nurse blocked him. "I've got it. Back to your office, Dr. Carter?"

"Yes."

The nurse wheeled her forward with Alexander trailing silently behind.

Inside the OB-GYN office, Evelyn waited for the door to close before studying him properly. His hair was disheveled, suit wrinkled, face scratched with fresh marks.

"What happened?"
###Chapter 99: He's Obsessed

Alexander Hamilton's lips twisted into a bitter smile, tugging at the cuts on his face. He winced in pain. "Got caught."

No need to ask who was responsible.

Evelyn Carter scoffed. "Margaret's condition is critical. I'm not a neurosurgeon, but my clinical experience tells me this is an emergency. Consider yourself warned."

Alexander paled instantly. "What's the exact cause?"

"Unclear. Could be a sudden spike in blood pressure from emotional distress, or a ruptured plaque in her arteries. Both are possible."

His voice trembled. "It must be our divorce... and the baby... It devastated her."

Evelyn refused to dwell on the past. "If she pulls through this time, you have to keep her from further stress. Or the consequences will be dire."

He understood her implication. "I'll keep Annabelle away from her."

"See that you do."

A flash of resolve crossed his eyes.

Evelyn had no interest in deciphering it.

"Evelyn." Alexander swallowed hard. "Nothing else to say to me?"

"One thing." She met his gaze directly. "When are we finalizing the divorce?"

He stiffened, brows furrowing. "Because of Dr. Wilson?"

"Because I'm buying a house." Her tone was icy. "I refuse to be thrown out on the street again."

A humorless laugh escaped him. "Worried about the settlement? I'm not that petty."

"Mr. Hamilton, post-divorce property is my business. But purchasing during marriage requires spousal consent. Understood?"

He nodded slowly.

"I'll schedule it and notify you."

"Make it quick. That development sells fast. Good units will be gone."

"Which one? I could—"

"Not necessary."

"..."

"We're done here. You can leave."

When he didn’t move, she prompted, "Don’t let your mistress misunderstand again. I’ll be the one suffering for it."

After a long pause, he murmured, "Right. My apologies."

"And stop acting like my husband outside divorce proceedings. I have some dignity left."

......

Later, Olivia Lightfoot recounted the drama outside the ER with relish.

"Code blue inside, screaming match outside." Crunching on crackers, she shook her head. "You dodged a missile, Dr. Carter. That homewrecker’s a legend now. The whole hospital knows Mr. Hamilton married a she-devil. Serves him right."

Evelyn scrolled through real estate listings. "Let him be. He's obsessed."

She shut her laptop and grabbed her coat.

Olivia blinked. "You’re clocking out early?"

"Took two hours off. Errands."

At the civil affairs bureau, Alexander was already waiting.

She approached with her documents, scanning the area. "No Ms. Taylor?"

He shook his head. "Our divorce doesn’t concern her."

"Thought you’d do a twofer. Divorce here, marry there. Efficient."

His jaw tightened at "marry." "Drop it. Let’s go in."

Near closing time, the office was empty.

Evelyn handed her papers to the clerk. "Divorce filing."

The clerk checked them. "The husband’s documents?"

Silently, Alexander produced his ID.

"Assets settled?"

"The agreement specifies no disputes."

"Properties, stocks count as marital assets. Jewelry, gold bars—"

Evelyn cut in. "I’m leaving with nothing."
###Chapter 100: The Pain of Childlessness

The clerk glanced up at Evelyn Carter, surprised to find her expression calm, even with a faint smile at the corners of her lips.

"Is there an issue with the documents?" Evelyn asked softly.

"Everything seems complete."

"That's good."

The clerk flipped through the papers. "Have you settled the child custody arrangements?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

Alexander Hamilton turned his face away.

"We don't have children," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely audible.

"That simplifies things." The clerk stamped the papers briskly. "Does the husband have any objections?"

Alexander shook his head. "Proceed as she wishes."

The clerk suddenly chuckled. "Faking a divorce to buy property? I've seen it all before."

Evelyn frowned. "You misunderstand."

"Look behind you," the clerk said, nodding toward the queue.

Couples waiting in line were either locked in heated arguments, standing like strangers, or with mistresses openly clinging to their new partners.

"Now that's a real divorce," the clerk remarked confidently. "You two acting all polite—who are you trying to fool?"

Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "There really is no love between us."

"Then why marry in the first place?"

Alexander abruptly stood, pulling Evelyn toward the exit. She winced as her injured leg protested the sudden movement.

He immediately knelt, lifting her skirt to reveal the bandage around her calf. His knuckles whitened. "I'm sorry."

Evelyn tugged her skirt back down. "We can talk calmly."

"Does it still hurt?"

"The painkillers are working."

Without another word, Alexander helped her sit, his warmth seeping through her sleeve. His gaze lingered on her injury, his brow furrowed.

"It's just a minor wound," Evelyn said, trying to lighten the mood.

"Don't say that," Alexander replied tightly. "Did the hospital give you leave?"

"The bloodmobile work is light," she deflected. "About the property..."

"I'll figure it out."

"The law is clear."

A scoff came from near the water cooler. The clerk sipped her tea with a knowing look. "The act crumbling already?"
###Chapter 101: The Price of Indulgence

Evelyn's knuckles turned white as she gripped the water glass. "The house purchase wasn't what you think..."

The clerk interrupted with a smile. "No need to explain. Your husband was so worried about you. His face went pale when you cried out in pain."

Evelyn froze.

Alexander responded calmly, "Mm."

She whipped her head around to stare at him.

Alexander stood and gave the clerk a polite nod. "Thank you for your time today."

"No trouble at all," the clerk beamed. "I see couples arguing every day. It's rare to witness such devotion."

As they left, the clerk patted Alexander's shoulder. "Young man, cherish what you have."

Alexander maintained a courteous smile.

Then he met Evelyn's piercing gaze.

"Why did you change your mind?"

"Change my mind?" His lips twisted bitterly. "I should have done it sooner."

Evelyn clenched her fists. "This divorce will happen eventually."

"No rush."

"Alexander!"

He suddenly reached out and steadied her trembling fingers. "Evelyn, I—"

A shrill ringtone cut through the air.

The name "Annabelle" glared from the screen.

"Should I leave?"

"Unnecessary."

"Then take it outside."

Alexander answered immediately. "What is it?"

His expression darkened instantly. "Uncle Taylor?"

Frantic speech crackled through the receiver.

Alexander's frown deepened until he abruptly stood. "Evelyn, I have to go. I'll arrange a ride for you."

"What about the paperwork?"

"Another day." He was already dialing another number, issuing rapid instructions before turning back. "Don't aggravate your leg injury."

"Who's picking me up? That gambling-addict secretary of yours?"

His eyes darkened. "He was fired months ago. Emily is back."

Evelyn stared in disbelief. "Annabelle allowed that?"

"She has no authority over company matters." A ruthless glint flashed in his eyes. "I indulged her too much before."

"Twenty years of affection, gone just like that?"

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "It's different."

The phone rang again.

His retreating figure carried uncharacteristic haste.

Five minutes later, a familiar face appeared at the civil affairs bureau entrance.

"Hey, beautiful..." Vincent scratched his head with an awkward grin.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Message-in-a-bottle guy?"

"That's me!"

"You and Alexander—"

"Childhood friends!" Vincent hurried to explain. "Asking for your number was entirely my idea—Alex had nothing to do with it!"

Evelyn smirked coldly. "How refreshingly honest."

Vincent chuckled nervously before sobering. "But let's be clear—I'm Team Annabelle."
###Chapter 102: Considering a Second Marriage?

Vincent Wilson suddenly leaned in with a suggestive smirk. "Dr. Carter, you're single now, right?"

Evelyn Carter took a step back. "What do you mean?"

"Relax," he spread his hands. "I'm just saying Alexander was blind to let you go. I may not be as rich as him, but I can give you everything you want."

Evelyn scoffed. "What's this? Some twisted sister-in-law fantasy?"

"Ouch," Vincent dramatically clutched his chest. "You think so little of me. I'm no saint, but I'm not that depraved."

"Really?"

"Absolutely!" He puffed out his chest. "I'm just a slightly mischievous good guy."

Evelyn ignored him.

The failed divorce proceedings sent Vivian Dempsey into a rage. She posted a scathing rant on social media, tearing Alexander apart.

Even worse, she began aggressively setting Evelyn up on dates.

Gregory Wilson became her top candidate.

"Greg's actually great," Vivian said while opening packages. "Why not give him a chance?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Not happening."

"Fine," Vivian shrugged. "At least you were upfront with him. Very classy."

She pointed to a corner. "Your cookies arrived."

Evelyn handed her two boxes. "For your trouble."

"Thanks!" Vivian grinned while munching.

Evelyn carefully wrapped three more boxes. "These are for Dr. Wilson tomorrow."

Between cookie bites, Vivian mumbled, "You don't have to be so formal..."

"Better to keep things clear."

The next morning, Evelyn left the cookies at the nurse's station.

Just as she prepared for blood draws, the hospital director called.

"Evelyn, are you free this weekend?"

Weekends used to be reserved for Alexander. Now they stretched empty before her.

"What do you need?"

"My daughter's getting married," the director sighed wearily. "Could you help out?"

Evelyn had met his daughter once—a beautiful art student.

"What should I do?"

"My wife passed years ago. It's just us two. I don't understand modern wedding customs and need someone reliable to oversee things."

"But I've never planned a wedding..."

"That's alright," he hurried to say. "I just need someone detail-oriented."

Remembering his kindness, Evelyn agreed. "Of course. Send me the address."

"Thank you! Feel free to bring friends—the more the merrier."

That evening, Evelyn mentioned it casually to Vivian.

Vivian's eyes widened. "Where's the venue?"

Evelyn sighed and handed over her phone. "Guess."

Vivian nearly jumped seeing the location. "Alexander's hotel?!"
###Chapter 103: Unexpected News

Evelyn stared at her phone screen, her finger hovering over the reply button.

Another message from the dean popped up: [I've sent you the address. You must come this weekend.]

She took a deep breath and finally typed a single word: "Okay."

That was a place she never wanted to visit again in her life.

But the dean's tone was like that of an overprotective father about to marry off his daughter—nervous yet hopeful. It softened her resolve.

Going alone was out of the question.

For an occasion like this, she needed someone who could command the room. She immediately dialed Vivian Dempsey.

"Miss Dempsey, are you free this weekend?"

A cold snort came through the phone. "Funny you should ask. I was just looking for someone to watch a good show with me."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "What's going on?"

"I got an invitation too—same day, same place." Vivian gritted her teeth. "Guess who sent it?"

Evelyn's heart sank.

"Simon Stapleton."

"Who?!" Evelyn nearly dropped her phone.

"That bastard who ruined our college entrance exams and got himself into Hudson University!" Vivian scoffed. "Surprise, surprise. The dean's daughter is marrying him."

Evelyn's fingers turned cold.

The dean was such a kind man. If his daughter married someone like that...

"I wasn't planning to go," Vivian said, her tone suddenly lighter. "But since you're going, it works out. If he's actually changed, we'll bless the happy couple. If he's still the same scumbag..."

"What are you planning to do?"

"Crash the wedding, of course!"

On the day of the wedding, the two arrived at the hotel before dawn.

Vivian tossed her car keys. "You go find the dean first. I'll park and catch up."

In the bridal suite, the dean rushed over the moment he saw her. "Evelyn! You made it!"

A sweet-faced girl sat at the vanity, smiling at her. "Hi, Evelyn."

"You know me?"

"My dad never stops praising you. Says you're the golden standard at the hospital." The girl blinked. "I might need your help soon."

Evelyn's gaze instinctively dropped to her abdomen.

The dean pulled her aside and lowered his voice. "She's pregnant. They're rushing the wedding before she starts showing. I’m sorry for the last-minute request to be a bridesmaid."

Evelyn's heart tightened. "So sudden..."

The dean sighed. "What's done is done. We can't have her walking down the aisle with a baby bump."

He pressed a thick red envelope into her hand. "I know you're still recovering. This is for your trouble."

The envelope was heavy—easily several thousand dollars.

"Take good care of Natalie when she delivers," the dean said, patting her shoulder.

Evelyn nodded. "Of course. But... do you know much about the groom?"

The dean beamed. "That boy is exceptional—undergrad at Hudson, grad school in the UK. Bound for great things!"
###Chapter 104: Time Never Lies

"The groom's name is Simon Stapleton?"

"Yes, do you know him?"

Evelyn Carter's fingers tightened slightly around her clutch. "...He was my high school classmate."

The dean's smile widened. "That's wonderful! You're already acquainted. He must have been exceptional back then too. I heard the whole school was buzzing when he got into Hudson University on a full scholarship."

The wedding hall was filled with joy, the dean's face radiating contentment. Evelyn pressed her lips together and murmured, "Good grades are one thing, but character matters most in marriage."

"True," the dean sighed. "When Natalie first told me she was pregnant, I was so furious I nearly ended up in the hospital. But after meeting Simon—his manners, his thoughtfulness toward her—I finally felt at ease."

Evelyn hesitated, holding back words.

The ceremony proceeded swiftly, almost rushed. A montage of the couple's memories played on the screen. The officiant recited the vows mechanically. It wasn’t until the ring exchange that Evelyn stepped forward to hand over the velvet box.

As she turned, she locked eyes with someone familiar.

Gregory Wilson stood beside her, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, a red silk boutonniere pinned to his lapel.

"Did the dean ask you to come?" she whispered.

"Yeah. Said the groom just returned from abroad and couldn’t find a groomsman." His gaze shifted to the front row. "The dean’s crying."

Evelyn followed his line of sight. The usually stern man was hunched over, wiping his eyes repeatedly.

"Giving away a daughter is like cutting out a piece of a father’s heart."

Gregory suddenly asked, "Did your father react this way when you married Alexander?"

Her breath hitched.

"Sorry," he backtracked immediately. "Just making conversation. You don’t have to answer."

"We didn’t have a wedding."

"Why not?"

"Too busy."

Gregory chuckled softly. "Time is like water in a sponge. You can always squeeze some out."

The words pricked her like a needle.

There’d been no wedding because Alexander Hamilton hadn’t cared enough. Just like how he’d ultimately chosen Annabelle Taylor—Evelyn had never been his first choice.

"Evelyn..." The bride, Natalie Stapleton, hurried over in a flutter of satin, her face pale. "What do I do about the toast later?"

Evelyn steadied her. "I’ll drink for you."

"But there are so many guests..."

"Just point out which ones are mandatory."

Natalie’s eyes welled up. "Thank God you’re here."

"Come on, let’s get you changed for the reception."

A sharp gasp cut through the air behind them. "Evelyn?!"

The voice was painfully familiar. Evelyn froze, then slowly turned.

Annabelle stood a few feet away, her bouquet slipping from her fingers and hitting the floor with a soft thud.
###Chapter 105: Coincidence or Calculation?

The voice cut through the air like a sharp blade.

She should have seen this coming.

This property belonged to the Hamilton Group. The odds of Alexander Hamilton showing up weren't zero.

But then again—why would a man like Alexander associate with someone like Simon Stapleton? It was just an ordinary wedding. Why would he bother attending?

Especially with Margaret still hospitalized.

His company was in chaos thanks to the Anderson siblings, and his mother was bedridden. He had no business being here.

Yet life loved proving her wrong.

Not only had he come—he'd brought Annabelle with him.

"Evelyn, who's this?" Natalie Stapleton eyed the impeccably dressed Alexander with curiosity.

Before Evelyn could answer, Simon rushed forward, bowing like a shrimp. "Mr. Hamilton! What an honor! This is my wife, Natalie."

Alexander's gaze remained fixed on Evelyn until Simon's introduction forced him to acknowledge Natalie with a stiff nod.

Evelyn looked different tonight.

The emerald satin gown hugged her curves, her collarbones glowing under the lights. Her updo accentuated her slender neck, and subtle makeup highlighted her striking features.

Alexander's throat moved slightly.

"Friend of the bride?" His voice was rough.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You know Simon?"

"No."

"Then why are you here?"

"Simon's my friend," Annabelle interjected, cradling her pregnant belly as she clung to Alexander's arm. "Dr. Carter, what a small world."

Evelyn smirked.

Last time, who swore to cut ties? Yet here they were, inseparable at a wedding.

"Mrs. Hamilton and I were classmates in London," Simon fawned. "Mr. Hamilton accompanied her."

The title "Mrs. Hamilton" made Alexander's jaw tighten.

"Funny coincidence—my high school friend shares her name, just spelled differently..."

The unspoken tension thickened.

Alexander's expression darkened. Evelyn watched coldly. Only Annabelle glared like a territorial animal.

"This bridesmaid is the bride's friend?" Annabelle challenged.

Natalie shook her head. "We just met today—"

"Yet she's your bridesmaid?" Annabelle turned to Alexander, her voice saccharine. "Don't you think it's odd? First that 'chance' meeting at the restaurant, now she's all dressed up at a stranger's wedding..."

Her gaze lingered pointedly on Evelyn's exposed shoulders.

"Coincidence? Or calculated?"
###Chapter 106 Undercurrents

Evelyn Carter's gaze was sharp as a blade.

Natalie Stapleton squirmed under her stare, fingers unconsciously twisting the satin folds of her wedding gown. She looked pleadingly at Evelyn, her voice barely above a whisper. "The bridesmaid was arranged by my father..."

Annabelle Taylor let out a cold laugh, crimson lips parting. "Arranged? Or did she invite herself?"

Natalie's face paled.

Murmurs rippled through the guests below. The dean wrung his hands anxiously, his eyes darting toward the stage.

Evelyn stepped subtly in front of Natalie. "Let's go through the side exit."

"But—"

"Your father is watching," Evelyn murmured. "Don't worry him."

Natalie bit her lip and nodded.

Evelyn bent to adjust the layers of tulle, the fabric swirling like a blooming night-blooming cereus in her hands.

"Stop right there!"

Simon Stapleton stormed over in three strides, grabbing Natalie's wrist. "Mr. Hamilton is waiting. Where do you think you're going?"

Natalie winced. "Simon, you're hurting me—"

"Enough!" Simon hissed through clenched teeth. "Do you have any idea what the Hamilton Group means? If we secure this connection, my position at the institute is set!"

Evelyn watched the man's naked ambition with icy detachment.

Simon suddenly pulled a red envelope from his inner pocket and shoved it into Evelyn's hands. "Take the money and get lost. Stop making trouble!"

The sharp corner of the envelope scraped her knuckles, leaving a red mark.

Natalie gasped as Simon yanked her around violently, sending her crashing onto the stage. Her veil slipped askew, hairpins scattering across the floor.

The crowd erupted in shocked whispers.

"Was that on purpose?" Simon snarled. "Trying to humiliate me in front of Mr. Hamilton?"

Natalie's eyes welled with tears. "The dress was too long—"

"Useless!" He flung her hand away. "I'll go myself!"

Natalie fell again, this time losing her bouquet. A broken crystal heel sliced a thin line of blood across her ankle.

Evelyn lunged forward, only to be shoved back by Simon. "Back off! This is none of your business!"

Alexander Hamilton rose from his seat.

The banquet hall fell silent.
###Chapter 107: It's Not Just a Sprain—She's Carrying Your Child!

Evelyn Carter suppressed her fury. A wedding wasn't the place for outbursts. She knelt to help Natalie Stapleton up.

Natalie's ankle had swollen to the size of a loaf of bread. Tears streamed down her face. "Evelyn, I can't stand..."

"Let me check."

Evelyn lifted the wedding dress hem gently. The ankle was a ghastly shade of purple.

"You need an X-ray. It might be fractured."

The emcee rushed over. "What happened? The toast is about to start."

"She can't walk," Evelyn said coldly. "Tell the groom to explain to the guests."

Natalie covered her face, sobbing. "I'm ruined. Everyone saw me humiliate myself..."

"I'll fetch the groom," the emcee turned to leave.

"No!" Natalie grabbed his sleeve. "He's discussing business. He'll be furious..."

Before Evelyn could respond, a deep voice spoke behind them. "Need help?"

Alexander Hamilton stood there, Annabelle Taylor beside him, her belly round with pregnancy.

Natalie shrank back. "Mr. Hamilton. Mrs. Hamilton."

Simon Stapleton strode over, face dark. "What's this? Get up!"

"Her ankle's sprained. She needs medical attention." Evelyn met his glare. "Carry her back."

Simon scoffed. "Who do you think you are? Take your red envelope and scram."

Evelyn's lips curled. "Your wife's in pain, and you're worried about money?"

"Cut the act. You just want more cash."

"Simon!" Evelyn snapped. "She's pregnant with your child. This could be dangerous!"

Alexander's head jerked up. "She's pregnant?"

He stepped forward. "Could the fall hurt the baby?"

"Unclear." Evelyn frowned. "Early pregnancy is fragile. She needs immediate examination."

Alexander pulled out his phone. "Emily, prepare the car."

Annabelle tugged his sleeve. "Alexander, don't interfere..."
###Chapter 108: The Forbidden Passenger Seat

Alexander's knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel.

"That's a human life!"

His voice was icy, his sharp gaze piercing through Simon. "What are you waiting for? Carry her into the car!"

Simon fidgeted nervously. "Mr. Hamilton, this is—"

"Alexander!" Annabelle rushed over, her pregnant belly prominent as she grabbed his sleeve. "Have you lost your mind? That's another man's wife!"

He shook her off, dark emotions swirling in his eyes. "When I was seven, I watched my sister's blood stain the entire street."

Annabelle's face drained of color.

"Mrs. Hamilton, please don't be upset," Simon said with an awkward smile, trying to mediate. "I'll go get my wife—"

"No need." Alexander had already bent down and lifted Natalie into his arms. The train of her wedding dress left a stark red trail on the ground.

Evelyn hurried after him. "Be careful with her abdomen!"

Outside the hotel's revolving doors, a black Maybach waited silently.

Secretary Emily visibly hesitated when she saw Evelyn but still greeted respectfully, "Madam."

The backseat was already occupied by the bloodstained wedding dress. Alexander pulled open the passenger door. "Get in."

Just as Evelyn's fingers brushed the door handle, she was shoved aside with surprising force.

"Dr. Carter," Annabelle blocked the car, her sweet smile laced with venom. "This seat isn't for just anyone."
###Chapter 109: Race Against Time

"Evelyn..."

Natalie's weak voice came from the backseat.

Evelyn turned to see Natalie's hands covered in blood, her face as pale as paper. "I... think the baby..."

Evelyn's heart plummeted.

The passenger door suddenly swung open, and Annabelle slid in with a smirk. "Alexander, drive the bride to the hospital."

Natalie trembled as she clutched Evelyn's hand. "Evelyn, please... save my baby..."

Evelyn squeezed her icy fingers, dread coiling in her chest.

"Natalie, lie down. I'll take another car and follow."

"Don't go..." Natalie clung to her desperately. "I'm scared..."

Annabelle scoffed from the front. "Stop pretending. Just admit you want to be alone with Alexander."

"Not everyone is as obsessed with romance as you, Annabelle."

"Then let go of her!" Annabelle snapped. "Alexander, drive!"

"Get out."

Annabelle whirled around. "What did you say?"

"I said, get out." Alexander's voice was glacial. "Have you forgotten how you delayed my mother's emergency treatment last time?"

Annabelle gritted her teeth. "That wasn't my fault! If Evelyn hadn't—"

Alexander shoved her door open. "I won't repeat myself."

"Alexander Hamilton!"

"Emily." His tone was steel.

Emily stepped forward immediately. "Miss Taylor, please exit the vehicle."

"No!" Annabelle clawed at the door. "Evelyn, you won't get away with this!"

"Evelyn..." Natalie's moans grew fainter, crimson blooming across her white wedding gown.

Evelyn made a split-second decision and moved to the driver's side. "Alexander, let me drive."

"You know how?"

"Now!"

Alexander swiftly switched seats.

Evelyn buckled in and slammed the accelerator. The car shot forward like an arrow.

Annabelle shrieked from behind, "Evelyn, have you lost your mind? That's my fiancé's car!"

"Say whatever you want." Evelyn kept her eyes on the road. "Go ahead and sue me."

"You—"

"One more word, and I'll call off the divorce." Evelyn smirked. "Let's see who lasts longer."
###Chapter 110: Shut Up or Get Out Now!

Natalie Stapleton curled up in the backseat, her wedding dress soaked with cold sweat. Her lips were ghostly pale, almost translucent.

"E-Evelyn..."

Evelyn Carter glanced in the rearview mirror. A stark crimson stain was spreading across the white fabric.

Natalie trembled as she clutched the seat. "Blood... so much blood..."

"Five more minutes." Evelyn jerked the steering wheel, tires screeching against the asphalt.

"The baby... is it gone?" Natalie's voice shattered like glass.

Evelyn's knuckles whitened around the wheel.

At this stage of pregnancy, she knew better than anyone how dire the bleeding could be.

"The hospital has the best equipment. Trust me."

A phone ringtone blared abruptly.

Annabelle Taylor gripped the seatbelt, shrieking, "Don't answer! You're driving like a maniac!"

Evelyn floored the accelerator. "One more word and you're walking!"

She yanked out her phone with one hand. The hospital director's frantic voice crackled through. "How's Natalie?"

"Likely needs surgery." Evelyn took a sharp turn. "Get the groom here to sign the forms. Now."

At the ER entrance, Olivia Lightfoot stood ready with the trauma team.

"Dr. Carter?!" Olivia's eyes widened at the sight of Evelyn behind the wheel.

"Prep the OR." Evelyn swiftly transferred Natalie onto a stretcher. "Get her to ultrasound first."

Olivia gasped at the bloodstains. "Threatened miscarriage?"

"Tell the blood bank to stand by." Evelyn ripped open the wedding dress to examine her. "Contractions are too frequent."

The stretcher raced toward the emergency corridor.

Evelyn turned to leave when a shrill voice froze her in place.

"What about me?" Annabelle leaned against the car door, gagging. "I'm pregnant too!"

Evelyn tossed the car keys without looking back. "Move the car."

"You expect me to park in this state?" Annabelle screeched. "I'm dizzy and nauseous!"

"Call a driver then." Evelyn's white coat billowed as she walked. "We can't block the ambulance lane."

"Evelyn! You—"

"Either move it," Evelyn spun at the elevator, eyes sharp as blades, "or I'll have security tow it."
###Chapter 111: A Mother's Choice

The operating lights flickered on as Evelyn Carter adjusted her sterile gown.

Olivia Lightfoot's hands trembled slightly as she passed the instruments. "Her blood pressure keeps dropping."

Natalie Stapleton lay pale on the table, her fingers gripping the sheets with white-knuckled intensity.

"Evelyn..."

Evelyn clasped her icy hand.

"The baby..." Natalie's lips were bitten raw. "Save him..."

The clatter of surgical tools pierced the tense silence.

Evelyn leaned closer. "Natalie, there's something you need to know."

"Simon..."

Natalie thrashed violently, setting off shrill alarms from the monitors.

"I want my baby!" she screamed hysterically. "No one touches my child!"

Olivia struggled to restrain her flailing arms.

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "Administer sedation."

When Natalie finally stilled, Evelyn gazed at the swollen abdomen, voice gravelly. "Even if it costs you everything?"

"He is my life." Tears soaked the pillow beneath Natalie's head.

The air in the OR turned leaden.

Olivia's red-rimmed eyes sought Evelyn's.

"Prep for fetal preservation." Evelyn snapped on fresh gloves. "Alert blood bank for transfusion."

......

As the surgical lights dimmed, the hallway erupted in chaos.

The chief surgeon stumbled forward. "Natalie—"

"Stable." Evelyn removed her mask. "The pregnancy is preserved for now."

The older man's face crumpled with relief.

A chair clattered in the corner.

Alexander Hamilton stood shadowed against the wall, his pallor ghastly. "The baby..."

Vivian Dempsey caught Evelyn as she swayed.

"You look terrible." Gregory Wilson offered water.

Evelyn shook her head, scanning the crowd.

Alexander's burning stare locked onto her abdomen, his Adam's apple bobbing violently.

"Dr. Carter, you've done miracles." The chief surgeon wiped his eyes. "But when will you start thinking of your own—"

A glass shattered on the tiles.

Alexander stood amidst the shards, blood dripping from his lacerated palm. His voice was barely human. "What child?"
###Chapter 112: A Leopard Can't Change Its Spots

Alexander Hamilton stood under the fluorescent hospital lights, his expression distant.

"Mr. Hamilton?" The chief physician tapped his shoulder. "Why are you spacing out here?"

He snapped back to reality with a slight bow. "My apologies. I was lost in thought."

The chief physician smiled kindly. "Evelyn's surgery went perfectly. No need to worry. Though you two should've given us a heads-up before coming."

Evelyn Carter stood nearby, forcing a strained smile.

Her gaze drifted to the empty corridor.

"She didn't come," Alexander said abruptly.

Evelyn nodded.

This hospital was her workplace. Her colleagues knew her as the woman with a devoted husband. If Annabelle showed up now, visibly pregnant... She couldn't bear their pitying looks.

"I'll check on Natalie," the chief physician said, leading relatives toward the ward.

The hallway fell silent.

Vivian Dempsey hurried over, whispering sharply, "You actually saved her baby? That's Simon's spawn!"

Evelyn peeled off her gloves, rubbing her temples. "The patient insisted. I had to respect her choice."

"That's the chief's only daughter," Vivian scoffed. "How many years has Simon played this game? Preying on privileged only children."

"Maybe this time's different?"

"Please." Vivian rolled her eyes. "A snake doesn't shed its skin. Just wait—once he finds a better stepping stone, that girl will end up worse than I did."

Evelyn's stomach churned, remembering how Simon had forced Natalie to socialize at their wedding reception.

If this was how he treated her as newlyweds...

"Dr. Carter."

A steaming coffee cup appeared before her. Gregory Wilson stood there, his gaze gentle. "Whole milk, half sugar."

She instinctively stepped back. "No, thank you."

Vivian nudged her. "He kept it warm against his chest the whole time."

"Really, I'm fine." Evelyn forced another smile. "Vivian, come help me grab something from my office."

"Evelyn—"

"Evelyn..."

Two voices overlapped.

Alexander stood three paces away, his dark eyes unreadable.
###Chapter 113: That's Not My Home

Vivian Dempsey doubled over with laughter. "You two have such perfect comedic timing. What a waste not doing stand-up together."

Gregory Wilson and Alexander Hamilton's gazes met briefly before darting away.

Vivian ignored Alexander completely, turning to Gregory. "What's up, Greg?"

"The surgical consent forms," Gregory adjusted his glasses. "We still need to complete the paperwork."

Evelyn Carter nodded. "Understood."

Her eyes swept the empty hallway outside the OR. Simon Stapleton was nowhere to be seen.

"Where's Simon?"

Vivian scoffed. "Too busy wheeling and dealing. Who has time for a wife in labor?"

Evelyn frowned. "What do you mean?"

Vivian jerked her chin toward Alexander. "Ask Mr. Hamilton here. Too busy neglecting his own fiancée to care about another man's wife."

Alexander immediately defended himself. "They're just old acquaintances."

"Old acquaintances?" Vivian sneered. "Then you'd better check whose baby that really is."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Simon's been back in the country for years."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "One guards another man's wife, the other escorts someone else's fiancée. Men are truly fascinating creatures."

Evelyn tugged at Vivian's sleeve. "Let's go."

"Evelyn—"

Alexander caught up, holding out a velvet box.

"Take it back." Evelyn didn't even glance at it.

"Mom asked me to give this to you."

Hesitating, Evelyn accepted the box. Inside lay a delicate silver protection charm.

"She had it blessed at the temple," Alexander said softly. "It's not valuable, just... her thoughts."

Evelyn snapped the box shut. "Thank Mrs. Hamilton for me."

"Mom said..." Alexander hesitated. "She hopes you'll visit more often."

Evelyn turned away. "That stopped being my home long ago."
###Chapter 114: Her? Pfft

Evelyn Carter stood before the supermarket shelf, her fingertips lightly tracing a row of body washes.

The apartment rental was finally settled.

Though Vivian Dempsey had repeatedly urged her to stay, Evelyn knew long-term imposition wasn't the solution. Especially with the hospital potentially calling at any hour—coming and going at midnight would inevitably disturb Vivian's rest.

Her phone screen still glowed, displaying photos of the new studio apartment on the rental app. One bedroom, decent lighting, just a fifteen-minute walk from the hospital.

"This one," she murmured, pressing the confirmation button and paying the deposit.

When Vivian found out, she stomped her foot in frustration. "Don't you consider me a friend? What's wrong with staying here? I sleep like a log!"

Evelyn looked up from folding clothes and smiled. "I know you don't mind. But I do."

"Mind what?"

"Mind always inconveniencing you." She placed the last folded shirt into the suitcase. "Besides, the new place is closer to the hospital. I can get there ten minutes faster when emergency calls come in."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Workaholic!"

"Still short on the down payment for a house," Evelyn said softly. "This job is important to me."

Vivian suddenly leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "After saving Natalie Stapleton this time, the director will definitely reward you. A promotion and raise are just around the corner!"

Evelyn only smiled, offering no reply.

She knew better. Things weren't that simple. The tangled web of Simon Stapleton and Natalie's drama, Vivian's history with Simon, and her own position at the hospital—it was all a messy knot.

On moving day, Vivian arrived in her red sports car, helping transport two cardboard boxes.

"That's all you have?" Vivian gaped. "Where have you been living all these years?"

"Hospital dorm." Evelyn patted the boxes. "Enough is enough."

The new apartment was nicer than expected. The landlady was warm and welcoming, even providing fresh bedding. Evelyn spent the morning settling in before heading to the supermarket that afternoon for daily essentials.

The store was quiet as she compared two shampoo bottles. Then a familiar voice drifted from behind her.

"...Her? Pfft."

The tone was laced with mockery and disdain. Evelyn's fingers froze mid-air.

Simon Stapleton.

"...Judging by your tone, there's a story?" a female voice chimed in, buzzing with gossipy excitement.

"Nothing much. It's just Evelyn Carter..." Simon's voice dropped slightly. "...loves tattling."

Evelyn stood rooted to the spot, her grip tightening around the body wash bottle until the plastic creaked.

"Seriously? Spill the tea!" The woman's voice grew even more eager.

Simon chuckled. "She's..."
###Chapter 115: The One Feeling Choked Is You, Not Me

"Do you remember that guaranteed admission spot to Peking University back in high school?" Simon Stapleton lowered his voice, a hint of smugness in his tone. "Evelyn could never outscore me, so she resorted to dirty tricks."

Annabelle Taylor raised an eyebrow. "What did she do?"

"Spread rumors that I bullied her best friend." Simon scoffed. "I was memorizing vocabulary even in the bathroom back then. When would I have time for that nonsense?"

"So she wanted to..."

"Exactly. Drag me down so she could take my spot." Simon shrugged. "Too bad for her—I still got into Peking University."

Annabelle mused, "I heard she ended up at Hudson Medical School?"

"Yeah. Played a stupid game, won a stupid prize—" Simon froze mid-sentence.

Evelyn Carter stood before them, holding a bottle of shampoo.

"What a coincidence," she said flatly.

Simon paled. "E-Evelyn? Why are you—"

"Not a coincidence." Evelyn placed the shampoo in her cart. "I followed you here."

Simon instinctively stepped away from Annabelle. "Don’t misunderstand. Jane and I are just friends."

Evelyn’s gaze flickered between them before settling on Annabelle’s arm looped through Simon’s.

"Good friends?" She smirked.

Annabelle yanked her arm back, voice sharp. "I’m pregnant. Is it a crime for him to steady me?"

"Sure." Evelyn turned back to the shelves without another word.

"If you dare breathe a word of this to Alexander—" Annabelle hissed.

Evelyn didn’t look back. "Breathe what?"

"About Simon and me—" Annabelle’s eyes narrowed. "Are you recording this?"

"Not interested." Evelyn’s tone was ice.

Annabelle sneered. "Playing the saint? A divorced woman forcing herself into someone else’s wedding as a bridesmaid—who knows what you’re really after?"

Evelyn picked up a bottle of body wash and dropped it into her cart. "Think whatever you want." She met Annabelle’s glare. "Either way, I’m not the one feeling sick about it."

Simon stood awkwardly between them, suddenly irrelevant.

He knew exactly where he stood—one woman was Mrs. Hamilton, the other was his former classmate who knew all his secrets.

"Evelyn," he forced a smile, "I owe you an apology for neglecting you at the banquet. Let me treat you to dinner sometime."

Annabelle’s face darkened instantly. "Weren’t you just complaining about her ruining your reputation? Now you’re playing nice?"
###Chapter 116: Single Woman

Simon Stapleton's smile froze. He scrambled to explain, "Evelyn, you misunderstood—that's not what I meant..."

"Pathetic," Annabelle scoffed, her gaze sweeping over him with disdain. "A grown man cowering before an old classmate. No wonder Alexander thinks so little of you."

Simon immediately switched to an ingratiating grin. "Jane, we've known each other for years. Now that you're Mrs. Hamilton, surely you could put in a good word for this partnership..."

"I can try," Annabelle lifted her chin. "But whether Alexander listens isn't up to me."

"Everyone in H City knows how devoted he is to his wife," Simon fawned.

A smug smile curled Annabelle's lips. "Don't exaggerate. People might think I'm some kind of tyrant."

"It just shows how much he values you—"

Mid-conversation, they suddenly realized Evelyn had vanished.

Simon shifted uneasily. "You don't think she actually went to complain to Alexander, do you?"

"She wouldn't dare," Annabelle sniffed. "Probably couldn't stomach hearing how well Alexander treats me and left in a huff."

Simon rubbed his hands together. "Right, especially since she's the one who got dumped..."

"Still, watch your step with her father," Annabelle narrowed her eyes. "I hear he holds Evelyn in high regard."

Simon suddenly chuckled. "He wouldn't dare either."

"Oh?"

"His daughter and grandson are under my thumb," Simon lowered his voice. "For their sake, the old man has to play nice."

——

Outside the supermarket, Evelyn struggled with two overstuffed shopping bags.

Abandoning the idea of waiting for the bus, she set them down and pulled out her phone to call a cab.

Five minutes later, the taxi stopped in front of her new apartment building.

"Next time, bring your husband along, miss," the driver advised kindly as he helped unload the groceries.

"I'm single," Evelyn replied flatly.

"Then who's that...?"

Following the driver's gaze, she spotted a familiar figure approaching from the building's entrance.
###Chapter 117: Evelyn, I Feel Terrible

Evelyn Carter carried two bags of groceries into the apartment complex when she spotted the familiar figure from afar.

Alexander Hamilton leaned against the stone pillar by the entrance, his tie loose around his neck, suit jacket draped carelessly over his arm.

She instinctively froze.

What was he doing in this old neighborhood?

"Got a lot of shopping done?" Alexander straightened up and walked toward her, his voice slightly hoarse.

Evelyn took half a step back. "Vivian had an emergency."

He reached for her bags, his fingertips an unnatural shade of red.

"No." She sidestepped his gesture. "Why are you here?"

"Old classmate's baby shower." He rubbed his temples. "Drank too much."

She noticed the redness at the corners of his eyes, the scent of alcohol on his breath.

"Does Annabelle know you came to see me?"

Alexander's brows furrowed instantly. "Don't mention her."

Suddenly, he snatched the shopping bags from her hands and turned toward the building.

"Alexander!"

He stopped at the elevator and pressed the button. "I have a headache."

"There's a clinic down the street to the left."

"You're a doctor."

"I'm an OB-GYN."

He chuckled. "Dr. Carter, top of your class in med school, can't even handle a cold?"

The elevator doors opened.

He stepped inside, blocking the door with his body. "I'll double the consultation fee."

Evelyn didn't move.

"Don't want your groceries?" He shook the bags.

Finally, she entered the elevator.

The confined space filled with the strong scent of whiskey.

"How much did you drink?"

"Lost count." He leaned against the wall. "Celebrating."

When the elevator reached the fifteenth floor, Alexander suddenly staggered.

The bags hit the floor with a dull thud.

He pitched forward, and Evelyn instinctively caught him.

His scorching body heat radiated through his shirt.

"Evelyn..." His breath brushed her ear. "I feel terrible."

"You're running a fever."

"Yeah."

"Go to the hospital."

"No." Like a petulant child, he let his full weight press against her. "I'm staying here."

Evelyn stumbled backward under his weight, her back hitting the wall.

"Alexander!" She shoved him hard. "Stop pretending to be drunk."

His lashes fluttered before he suddenly slid down to the floor.

"Keys..." He looked up at her with unfocused eyes. "In my pocket."
###Chapter 118: Don't You Love Her?

Evelyn shoved hard, sending Alexander stumbling backward until his back slammed against the wall.

A muffled groan escaped his lips as his face drained of color.

His tall frame slid slowly down the wall until he crumpled into the corner.

Evelyn froze.

She hadn't expected her casual push to leave Alexander in such disarray.

"Alexander."

He lifted his head, bloodshot eyes meeting hers. "Yeah."

"...Can you stand?"

His knuckles turned white as he braced against the wall. "Yeah."

The movement was painfully slow, as if each inch cost him dearly.

Watching his unsteady form, Evelyn reached for the shopping bags.

"Let me."

"No."

Alexander grabbed them first, his fingers straining against the weight.

"Just open the door."

When he stepped closer, the strong scent of alcohol hit her.

Evelyn frowned and turned to retrieve her keys.

As light flooded the apartment, she saw Alexander hesitating at the threshold.

"Should I... take off my shoes?"

"Don't bother."

He entered cautiously, placing the bags by the wall.

"I'll help you put things away later."

"Worry about yourself first."

A bitter smile twisted his lips. "Must be quite a sight."

The tiny apartment only had one armchair.

It creaked ominously when Alexander sat down.

Evelyn filled the kettle with bottled water.

"Talk."

"About what?"

"How you found this place."

Only Vivian knew about her move.

Alexander pulled out his phone and opened social media.

Vivian's midday post glared back at them - a photo of Evelyn's retreating figure with luggage, captioned "Daughters grow wings" with a crying emoji.

The fatal detail was the location tag.

"A friend saw it and told me."

Evelyn stared at the post, brow furrowed.

Vivian openly supported Gregory. This made no sense.

"How much more do you need for the house?"

"Stop meddling."

"I just want to help."

"You're sabotaging me." Evelyn's laugh was cold. "We both know what Annabelle would do if she found out."

"She won't."

"Don't you love her?"

Alexander's head snapped up, turbulent emotions swirling in his eyes.

The kettle's shrill whistle pierced the air.

Steam rose between them like a curtain.
###Chapter 119: The Pain Belonged to Them Both

Alexander Hamilton leaned back on the sofa, fingers digging deep into his hair.

His eyes were closed, his breathing heavy.

Evelyn Carter stood by the window, gazing at the streetlights in the night.

"You should go," she said softly.

The kettle in the kitchen let out a sharp whistle.

She poured a cup of hot water and placed it on the coffee table.

The glass made a crisp sound as it touched the surface.

Alexander slowly opened his eyes and reached for the cup.

"How is Aunt Margaret doing lately?"

"Auntie Marry says she's stabilized."

"You haven't visited her?"

His fingers tightened around the cup. "I don't dare."

"She's your mother."

"Exactly why I don't dare." He gave a bitter smile. "Every time I go to the hospital, Annabelle follows and causes a scene. The doctors say my mother needs rest more than anything."

Evelyn turned, the moonlight outlining her profile.

"She's afraid of losing you."

"She doesn't understand what trust means," Alexander said hoarsely.

Silence filled the room.

"I went to a baby's full moon celebration today," he said suddenly.

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly.

"It was a beautiful little girl, dressed in a pink dress." Alexander's gaze softened. "She only wanted me to hold her—wouldn't let anyone else near."

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"She was so small in my arms, so light, like a feather."

Evelyn clenched the curtains tightly.

"She smiled at me, grabbing my tie with her tiny hands." His voice began to shake. "If our child had—"

"Stop!" Evelyn cut him off sharply.

Alexander looked up, his eyes bloodshot.

"Where did she—"

"Medical waste disposal," Evelyn said quickly. "Like all other miscarried fetuses."

Alexander's face turned deathly pale.

"You should go." She turned her back to him. "I don't want to move again."

"She won't come back."

Evelyn spun around. "What do you mean?"

"I hit her." His voice was icy. "She nearly killed that baby."

Evelyn stared at him in shock.

"You actually laid hands on her?"

"She deserved it." Alexander stood, his shadow stretching across half the living room. "That child was only a month old."

###Chapter 120 Liar

Evelyn turned and walked into the kitchen. The glass window reflected her pale face.

Alexander followed, stopping three steps behind her.

"I'm sorry," he said hoarsely. "I drank too much."

Evelyn didn't turn around. "Why are you here? Did the full moon celebration end already?"

"Yes."

"Liar."

Alexander stayed silent.

"Get out." Evelyn suddenly spun around, her gaze sharp.

He didn't move.

"I said get out!"

"...Fine."

Alexander turned to leave but hesitated. "That child—"

"Shut up!"

"I just wanted to say—"

"I don't need to hear it!" Evelyn yanked open the fridge door. "Never mention that again."

A gust of cold air rushed out.

Alexander watched her trembling fingers. "Are you cold?"

"None of your business."

"Evelyn—"

"Enough!" She slammed the fridge shut. "Go find your Annabelle. Don't disgust me here."

A phone rang abruptly.

Alexander glanced at the caller ID, his brow furrowing.

"Answer it," Evelyn sneered. "Why hesitate?"

He pressed accept.

"Alexander! Where the hell are you?!" Annabelle's shrill voice pierced through the kitchen.

"What do you want?"

"My stomach hurts! Come take me to the hospital now!"

"Ask Simon to take you."

"What the hell is that supposed to mean?!"

Alexander's voice turned icy. "Exactly what I said."

"Are you with that bitch again?!"

Evelyn's hands clenched.

"Watch your mouth," Alexander warned.

"Ha! So I was right? Alexander, don't forget who caused my premature birth!"

"You brought it on yourself."

"You—"

Alexander hung up.

Silence filled the kitchen.

"She's pregnant?" Evelyn asked suddenly.

"Yes."

"Congratulations."

Alexander stared at her. "Do you really mean that?"

"What else?" Evelyn forced a smile. "May you grow old together and have many children."

"Evelyn—"

"Oh," she cut him off. "I heard Vincent is pursuing you?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "Who told you that?"

"Doesn't matter." She took a step closer. "What do you think of him?"

"What are you implying?"

"A divorced man playing matchmaker for his ex-wife—how original."

Alexander grabbed her wrist. "Over my dead body!"

Evelyn struggled. "Let go!"

"I won't allow it!"

"You have no right!" Evelyn finally exploded. "Alexander, we're divorced!"

The phone rang again.

Alexander turned it off without looking.

"Answer me," he demanded, stepping closer. "Are you really considering Vincent?"

Evelyn lifted her chin. "What if I am?"

"He's not good enough for you."

"And you are?" She scoffed. "A cheating bastard?"

Alexander's pupils contracted.

"I'm tired," Evelyn pushed him away. "Please leave."

"Evelyn—"

"Go!"

A frantic knocking came from the door.

"Alexander! I know you're in there!" Annabelle's voice carried through. "Open up!"

Both froze.

Evelyn smirked. "Your ten minutes are up."

Alexander didn't move.

"Go on," Evelyn pointed at the door. "Don't keep your pregnant woman waiting."

The knocking grew louder.

"Alexander! I'll call the police if you don't open this door!"

Finally, Alexander turned.

As he walked away, Evelyn spoke again. "Alexander."

He stopped.

"From now on, stay out of my life."

He didn't turn back, only gave a slight nod.

"Fine."

The door opened.

Annabelle's shrieks flooded the apartment.

Evelyn leaned against the kitchen wall and slowly slid to the floor.

The hum of the fridge drowned out everything else.
###Chapter 121 Basic Courtesy

Alexander Hamilton's voice was low and hoarse. "If that's what you think, then so be it."

Evelyn Carter's brows instantly furrowed.

She stared coldly at Alexander.

What kind of nonsense was this?

Drunken antics?

Or was he deliberately trying to provoke her?

Her sharp gaze sobered him slightly. His tone softened. "These days, whenever I'm not with you, you assume I'm with her."

Perhaps his self-deprecating attitude was too obvious, because Annabelle Taylor didn't seem suspicious this time.

"Fine. See you in twenty minutes. I'll send you the location."

Alexander ended the call abruptly and turned off his phone.

Silence finally returned.

He leaned back on the sofa and exhaled heavily.

"Aren't you afraid she'll make a scene after you turned off your phone?"

Alexander smirked. "Then I just won't go back."

Evelyn responded immediately. "Need a hotel? I'll have Emily arrange it."

"Evelyn."

"..."

"Don't worry. I won't stay the night."

Caught off guard, Evelyn maintained her composure.

"A man and a woman alone together should avoid impropriety."

Alexander gave a noncommittal hum.

"More water?"

"Yeah."

After a few sips of warm water, his drunkenness gradually faded.

Evelyn found it darkly amusing.

Arguing worked better than sobering medicine.

Maybe she should just pick fights with drunk patients during night shifts from now on.

Alexander pushed himself up from the sofa. "I'm leaving."

"Goodbye."

He scoffed. "So formal?"

"Basic courtesy."

"Basic courtesy..."

Alexander nodded slowly. "Right. I won't disturb you further."

"Don't come back."

He gave her one last lingering look before turning away.

The door slammed shut behind him.

Standing outside, he stared at the closed door, all his unspoken words dissolving into a sigh.

......

The next morning, Evelyn went straight to Natalie Stapleton's hospital room.

As soon as she entered the office, Olivia Lightfoot sidled up to her mysteriously. "Dr. Carter."

Evelyn removed her coat and slipped on her white lab coat.

"Speak."

"The director's daughter has terrible taste in men."

Evelyn paused mid-motion.

Something must have happened yesterday.

She buttoned up and grabbed the medical chart. "Did Natalie hemorrhage again last night?"

Olivia hurried after her. "It was pretty bad. Scared me half to death."

Evelyn flipped through the chart. "Dr. Porter handled it?"

"Thankfully she was here. But..." Olivia lowered her voice. "The surgical consent form still isn't signed."

Evelyn smirked coldly.

Simon Stapleton had been too busy sucking up to Annabelle yesterday to bother coming to the hospital.

"Have the family member sign it immediately when they arrive."

"They're already here."

"Simon?"

"His mother." Olivia rolled her eyes. "She forced Natalie to drink some fertility concoction."

"...People still believe in that nonsense?"

Olivia pursed her lips. "She started hemorrhaging right after drinking it."
###Chapter 122: Red Envelopes and Multiple Choice

Evelyn's brow furrowed involuntarily.

She had expected Simon to lose his composure first, but it turned out his mother was the one who couldn't wait.

Just before pushing open the hospital room door, Evelyn and Olivia paused simultaneously.

"...These days, who will take good care of you without a red envelope? My son is too honest. As his mother, I have to handle these things myself."

Red envelope?

Evelyn and Olivia exchanged glances. The latter shook her head in confusion.

"Ahem." Evelyn cleared her throat deliberately and entered.

Natalie on the hospital bed looked like a lifeless doll—until she saw Evelyn. A glimmer of light finally appeared in her eyes. "Dr. Carter..."

"Feeling better?"

Natalie's lips trembled slightly. "Much better."

"Oh, you must be the attending physician!" A thin middle-aged woman suddenly darted in front of Evelyn and grabbed her wrist.

Her hands were rough like dried branches, with a grip surprisingly strong.

What hurt more was the hard, square object with sharp edges hidden in the woman's palm.

"Doctor, I'd like to ask you something." The woman smiled meaningfully, covering Evelyn's hand with her other palm and patting it twice.

Evelyn immediately understood her intention.

She withdrew her hand calmly. "Feel free to ask. We always provide honest answers to patients and their families."

"Well," the woman's eyes darted around, "I'm preparing the nursery. Should I choose pink or blue for the bedsheets?"

Olivia frantically signaled with her eyes from the side.

Evelyn had seen this trick many times before.

"Color doesn't matter. Material does. Pure cotton is best—breathable and gentle on the skin."

The woman froze momentarily, then flashed a knowing smile. "Doctors at big hospitals are so professional."

With that, she shoved something even thicker into Evelyn's hand.

This time, the sharp corner dug into her flesh, making Evelyn gasp in pain.

"Then let me ask you this," the woman tightened her grip, "should we raise this child to be strong and masculine or gentle and soft?"

"Tailor the approach to the child's nature."

"When I announce the news to relatives, should I say 'a precious son' or 'a beloved daughter'?"

Olivia couldn't hold back any longer. "Just don't say 'surprise fatherhood'!"

Evelyn shot her a warning glare.

But the middle-aged woman suddenly laughed. "Ah, so we should prepare double the gifts?"

"Double what?" Olivia looked utterly bewildered.
###Chapter 123: Radar Tracking

"Young lady, why play dumb at this point?" The middle-aged woman eyed her sideways, growing more impatient. She turned to scold Natalie Stapleton. "Look at her—same age as you, yet so much more cunning. And you? Almost lost your baby from sheer carelessness during the wedding."

Natalie twisted her fingers. "Mom, it really was an accident..."

"An accident? More like sheer stupidity—never mind. Not the time with outsiders present. Just stay put."

Natalie, ever docile, fell silent under her mother-in-law's reprimand, bowing her head lower.

Evelyn Carter frowned and turned to instruct Olivia Lightfoot. "Check Natalie's blood pressure."

"Got it."

Olivia approached the bed with the blood pressure cuff, speaking softly. "Tell me if you feel unwell." She deftly secured the strap.

Natalie bit her lip and nodded.

"140 over 90—slightly elevated. Keep calm." As Olivia finished speaking, the door swung open again.

"Auntie Stapleton~"

The middle-aged woman's face lit up. "Oh, Annabelle! You grow lovelier by the day."

Simon Stapleton trailed in with armfuls of gifts, grinning. "Mom, it's Mrs. Hamilton now."

"Right, right! Mrs. Hamilton! That belly... must be due soon?"

"Not for a while yet."

"That shape means a bouncing baby boy!"

Annabelle covered her mouth with a delicate laugh. "Your blessing means everything."

"In all my years, I've never been wrong! The Hamilton heir will inherit everything!"

A flicker of pride crossed Annabelle's eyes. "He's still young. Who knows if he'll have the talent..."

"With you and Mr. Hamilton as parents? Impossible!"

Olivia suddenly cut in. "Genetics are unpredictable. What if he takes after the wrong side—"

Annabelle's smile froze. Spotting Evelyn, her expression cooled. "Dr. Carter making rounds?"

Evelyn nodded. "Routine check."

"Ran into you at the supermarket yesterday. Quite a coincidence—Dempsey residence isn't nearby, is it?"

"Since when do supermarkets restrict customers by address?"

With the Stapletons present, Annabelle's face darkened. "I meant you always seem to appear near Alexander."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Was Mr. Hamilton grocery shopping too yesterday?"

"He had business nearby."

"Consider installing a radar on him. Set the radius to three miles—alarm triggers if I enter the zone." Evelyn's tone remained even.

Tension crackled in the air. Natalie spoke up timidly. "Mrs. Hamilton, my father invited Evelyn to the wedding. She was supposed to be on duty—"

"Miss Stapleton," Annabelle cut in icily, "don't speak on matters you don't understand."
###Chapter 124: Tit for Tat

Natalie's eyes reddened with urgency. "Evelyn was only trying to help me—"

"Shut up!" Simon snapped. "If Mrs. Hamilton told you to stay quiet, then do as you're told."

"But I can't just watch Evelyn get blamed for—"

At the mention of Evelyn, Simon rubbed his hands nervously. "Your precious Evelyn is more than capable of handling herself. Don't waste your breath."

Evelyn gave Natalie a reassuring smile, though her gaze remained icy. "Simon’s right. I always return what’s given to me."

A bead of sweat formed on Simon’s forehead. "This is all just a misunderstanding—"

"If it’s a misunderstanding," Evelyn shut her medical chart with a sharp snap, "then let’s clear it up right now."

Simon’s face paled. "Clear up what?"

"The lies you’ve been spreading."

Annabelle frowned at Simon. "What’s going on?"

Simon stammered, "It’s just—"

A knock at the door interrupted him.

Natalie assumed it was a nurse. "Come in."

But it was Alexander who stepped inside.

Simon immediately fawned over him. "Mr. Hamilton! What brings you here in person?"

Alexander carried several gift bags of supplements. His eyes swept over the crowded room. "I came to check on Natalie." He set the gifts on the bedside table. "Rest well."

Natalie flustered. "Thank you, Mr. Hamilton..."

Alexander’s gaze lingered on Evelyn. She was focused on writing medical notes, her white coat accentuating her cool detachment.

Annabelle suddenly lashed out. "Why are you here? Trying to make up for last night? Where were you?"

Alexander looked away. "I’m visiting a patient."

"Stop pretending!" Annabelle sneered. "You just wanted to see me—"

"I stated my reason."

Without looking up, Evelyn pointed at the door. "Take your argument outside."

Annabelle clung to Alexander’s arm. "We’re perfectly fine!"

"Then go display your affection elsewhere."

"What’s wrong? Can’t stand seeing us happy?"

"It’s nauseating."

Annabelle pressed closer deliberately. "Oh, I’m so sorry. We’re just too sweet, aren’t we?"

"Noise is prohibited in the hospital."

"Ugh, so many rules." Annabelle tugged at Alexander’s sleeve. "Alexander, why don’t we just buy this hospital?"

He shook her off. "Stand properly."

"I’m tired..."

Alexander pushed her away again. "I have work to attend to." He nodded at Natalie. "Contact my secretary if you need anything."

"Alexander!"

The door clicked shut behind him.
###Chapter 125: Tit for Tat

Alexander Hamilton strode out of the ward without looking back. Annabelle Taylor stumbled from the sudden push, her face flashing with humiliation.

She quickly composed herself and smiled at Simon Stapleton. "Alexander is always like this when he's focused on work."

Simon immediately agreed. "Mr. Hamilton is incredibly driven. No wonder he's achieved so much at such a young age."

"You're not so bad yourself."

"I could never compare to Mr. Hamilton."

Annabelle shot Evelyn Carter a meaningful glance. "At least you were admitted to Peking University on merit, unlike those who had to grind their way into medical school."

Evelyn ignored the barb. She turned to Olivia Lightfoot. "Natalie Stapleton needs continued fetal preservation treatment. Monitor her closely these next few days."

"Understood."

"Let's move to the next ward."

"Wait—" Mrs. Stapleton blocked Evelyn's path. "You still haven't told us the baby's gender."

"Fetal sex identification is prohibited by hospital policy."

"Rules are made to be broken. Can't you make an exception?"

"My apologies. It's the regulation."

Mrs. Stapleton stamped her foot in frustration. "You doctors and your inflexibility! Our Stapleton family needs a male heir!"

Olivia interjected, "A daughter would still carry your family's bloodline."

"What do you know?" Mrs. Stapleton turned to Annabelle. "Mrs. Hamilton, surely you understand?"

Annabelle positioned herself in the doorway, her pregnant belly prominent. "This trivial matter? I'll handle it."

Mrs. Stapleton brightened. "Exactly! Surely the hospital would honor Mrs. Hamilton's request?"

Evelyn smiled coolly. "This hospital answers to public health codes, not the Hamiltons. I follow protocol."

"How dare—"

"Olivia, let's go."

Evelyn headed straight for the lab after leaving the ward.

"Dr. Carter, aren't we continuing rounds?"

"Natalie's urinalysis comes first. Her elevated glucose levels require ruling out gestational diabetes."

At the lab, the results weren't ready yet.

As Evelyn waited by the window, rapid footsteps approached from behind.

Annabelle stormed in, fury radiating from her. "You will tell me that baby's sex today!"

"Not happening."

"I promised Mrs. Stapleton. Don't make me force your hand."

Evelyn met her glare. "Your promises are your problem."

Annabelle leaned in, her whisper venomous. "How long before the entire hospital knows you seduce married men? Let's see how many pregnant women still want your— Ah!"

A splash of liquid hit her face.

"Have you lost your mind?!" Annabelle wiped her cheek, recoiling at the odor. "What is this?"

Evelyn pointed to the lab window's sign: Urine Sample Collection.

"Tit for tat."
###Chapter 126: A Long-Planned Counterattack

"Evelyn! You—"

Evelyn Carter calmly set down the empty cup and picked up another full one, her gaze icy. "Say it again. I dare you."

The doorway of the lab was already crowded with onlookers, their hushed whispers rising and falling like waves.

Annabelle Taylor clutched her soaked blouse as she stumbled back, shrieking, "Simon! Simon Stapleton!"

The hallway remained empty. No response.

"Simon, you spineless coward!" Annabelle trembled with rage. "I stood up for your family, and now you won’t even show your face?!"

Still, silence.

Evelyn gave the urine sample cup a slight shake. Annabelle immediately turned and fled, shouting over her shoulder, "You’ll regret this! Alexander will make you pay!"

Olivia Lightfoot fumed. "Dr. Carter, why didn’t you chase her and throw another cup?"

Evelyn placed the cup back in the testing tray. "Know when to stop. A doctor publicly dousing a patient? How would I keep my reputation if that got out?"

Olivia leaned in to examine the spilled sample. "This one belongs to Wendy West..."

"Already tested." Evelyn pointed to the report on the counter.

Olivia’s eyes lit up. "You prepared this in advance?"

"I couldn’t delay the patient’s results."

"This is so satisfying!" Olivia clapped her hands excitedly. "That Annabelle has been throwing tantrums everywhere just because she’s pregnant. Serves her right! How did you come up with this?"

A faint smirk touched Evelyn’s lips. "I’ve been thinking about it for a while."

"Wait, really?"

"Surprised?"

Olivia shook her head vigorously. "She deserved it! Ruining someone else’s marriage and still acting so entitled..."

"I just couldn’t stand her." Evelyn’s voice was soft.

During lunch break, her phone buzzed.

Alexander Hamilton’s number.

"Calling to blame me?"

A pause on the other end. "Blame you for what?"

"Annabelle didn’t tattle?"

"She went to see you again?"

He didn’t know?

After all her threats, she’d stayed silent?

"Get to the point."

Alexander’s breathing was heavy. "What did she do to you?"

"None of your concern."

"..."

"Keep your people in check."

"Evelyn," Alexander’s voice suddenly turned hoarse, "Grandma is critical. She wants to see you one last time."
###Chapter 127 The Turning Point of Fate

Evelyn Carter's fingers trembled slightly.

Grandma Hamilton.

That name was like a key, instantly unlocking the floodgates of memory.

Three years ago, on that rainy night, the emergency room lights were blindingly harsh.

She had just finished a grueling 24-hour night shift, still in her white coat. The wail of an ambulance pierced the night as an elderly woman was wheeled in, her face ashen, her breathing shallow.

"Acute coronary syndrome! Immediate surgery required!"

There was only one cardiologist on duty.

Evelyn clenched her jaw and pulled on her gloves.

Five hours later, her back was drenched in sweat. As she stepped out of the operating room, her legs gave way, nearly sending her crashing to the floor.

Strong hands caught her just in time.

"Dr. Carter, thank you."

She looked up into a pair of deep, intense eyes.

Alexander Hamilton.

The man she'd met at an awkward blind date three months prior.

That disastrous setup had been arranged by her department head, who'd vaguely described him as "a friend's grandson." Only during the meeting did she realize he was the heir to the Hamilton Group. She'd politely declined—never expecting their paths would cross again like this.

Grandma Hamilton's condition kept the entire family on edge.

The elderly woman had mild Alzheimer's, yet somehow remembered "Dr. Carter" perfectly. She'd throw tantrums during medication changes, insisting only Evelyn could attend to her.

"Dr. Carter, sorry to trouble you again." Alexander stood at the hospital room door, impeccably dressed in a suit, though exhaustion shadowed his eyes.

Evelyn sighed and took the medication tray from his hands.

This scene repeated too many times to count.

Until the day he intercepted her in the parking lot.

Alexander leaned against his black Maybach, the sapphire cufflinks at his wrists glinting in the sunlight.

"Grandmother would like to invite you to dinner."

When the wrought-iron gates of the Hamilton estate swung open, Evelyn realized something was amiss.

The courtyard overflowed with guests. A red carpet of rose petals unfurled before her.

Grandma Hamilton's 80th birthday celebration.

What shocked her more was when Alexander suddenly took her hand and tucked it into the crook of his arm.

Camera flashes erupted around them.

In that moment, she became the center of attention.

"Her greatest wish is to see me married," he murmured, his warm breath brushing her ear.

Looking back now, that birthday banquet marked the beginning of everything.

Evelyn's hand drifted unconsciously to her abdomen.

Where a tiny life had once grown.

On the phone, Alexander's voice was ragged with emotion. "The doctors say...it might be the last time."

Outside, the rain fell harder.

Just like that night three years ago.
###Chapter 128: The Unspoken Truth

Evelyn's knuckles turned white as she gripped her phone.

She knew Grandma Hamilton's condition better than anyone. The elderly woman had survived these three years only thanks to Dr. Porter's masterful stent surgery.

"Does Annabelle know about this?" Evelyn asked softly. "The elderly shouldn't be subjected to stress."

"Grandma never approved of her."

Evelyn paused. "Why?"

A bitter chuckle came through the line. "Childhood incidents. Grandma is devout—she can't stand cruelty to living things."

A memory flashed through Evelyn's mind. Right. Annabelle had once killed a cage of chicks in a fit of anger.

"So you're keeping it from her?"

"Grandma only recognizes you now." Alexander's voice was weary. "She keeps asking to see her granddaughter-in-law."

Evelyn sensed something. "Annabelle hasn't been with you recently?"

"She's been spending time with Simon Stapleton."

A relieved sigh escaped through the phone.

"Military Medical Hospital?" Evelyn frowned. "Why not Central Hospital?"

Silence. That said everything. He was avoiding Annabelle.

"I'll go after work," Evelyn finally relented.

"I'll pick you up."

"No." Her tone was firm. "I'll take a cab."

The line went quiet for a long moment.

"I'm sorry," he rasped.

"Don't be." Evelyn gazed out the window. "Grandma Hamilton treated me like her own. I owe her this."

Before leaving work, Evelyn made a detour to the OB-GYN ward.

Natalie Stapleton curled up alone on the hospital bed while Mrs. Stapleton prattled on. "Hong Kong has better technology. If it's a girl, we should terminate early—"

"Mom!" Natalie clutched her abdomen protectively. "This is my child!"

"What's the point of raising a worthless girl?" Mrs. Stapleton narrowed her eyes. "Do you know something? Did that Dr. Carter tell you the gender?"

Natalie paled, shaking her head frantically.

"I'm going to your father right now!" Mrs. Stapleton stood abruptly. "A hospital director can't control one little doctor?"
###Chapter 129: Need My Help?

Mrs. Stapleton was about to push the door open when she nearly collided with Evelyn Carter.

"Dr. Carter..." Mrs. Stapleton froze for a moment before forcing a smile. "Perfect timing."

Evelyn gave a slight nod and walked straight to the hospital bed.

"Evelyn..." Natalie Stapleton reached out with trembling hands.

Evelyn grasped her icy fingers. "Why are your hands so cold?"

Natalie bit her lip, casting a fearful glance at Mrs. Stapleton. "Help me..."

"Don't be afraid," Evelyn gently patted the back of her hand. "No one can force you to terminate the pregnancy without your consent."

"But what if... the family signs the papers?"

"The law states that termination requires the pregnant woman's own signature."

Natalie's tense shoulders finally relaxed.

Mrs. Stapleton scoffed. "Dr. Carter, why the riddles? If it's a boy, the whole family would be thrilled. Your secrecy only raises suspicions..."

"Auntie," Evelyn interrupted. "Fetal gender testing is illegal. Even if you bring the hospital director here, my answer remains the same."

"Stubborn fool!" Mrs. Stapleton waved her hand impatiently. "Then discharge us. We're transferring hospitals tomorrow."

"Where to?"

"Hong Kong."

"No!" Natalie suddenly shrieked, clutching Evelyn's white coat desperately. "Evelyn, please save me..."

It took Evelyn a long time to calm her down.

Mrs. Stapleton stood to the side, muttering "drama queen" under her breath.

"Where's Simon?" Evelyn asked.

"At work. Should he just sit around all day?"

"Natalie needs her husband's support right now."

"Support what?" Mrs. Stapleton sneered. "In my day, women worked until the day they gave birth. Now she's pampered with good food and still depressed? Who's she trying to fool?"

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Prenatal depression is a real condition—"

"Enough!" Mrs. Stapleton cut her off. "If you won't do the test, stop wasting our time. Just prepare the discharge papers!"

A phone suddenly rang.

It was Alexander Hamilton.

"Off work yet?" he asked.

Evelyn checked the time. "Still handling Natalie's situation."

"Need help? I'm at the hospital entrance."

Evelyn paused, then had a sudden thought. "Don't come in. I'll be right out."
###Chapter 130: The Urine Incident

Alexander Hamilton had chosen a secluded spot. His Cayenne was wedged into a narrow alley, barely leaving five centimeters of clearance on either side.

Evelyn Carter stood at the alley entrance, scanning the area until a short honk caught her attention.

"Your parking skills..." She couldn't help but remark as she approached.

The massive SUV fit perfectly into the cramped space, its sides nearly brushing the walls.

"No surveillance here," Alexander explained.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Does Annabelle check security footage now?"

"Who knows?" He leaned back wearily. "I feel like a fugitive these days."

She chuckled. "Isn't this what you wanted?"

"You think this is ideal?"

"You got exactly what you asked for."

Used to her sarcasm, he cut to the chase. "What do you need from me?"

"It's about Natalie Stapleton."

After hearing Evelyn's account, Alexander frowned. "This is the 21st century. How can people still cling to such archaic beliefs?"

"Natalie's too soft, and Mrs. Stapleton is domineering."

"What's your take?"

Evelyn was blunt. "I advised terminating the pregnancy. Simon's character and his mother's behavior will only make Natalie's life worse—"

"I disagree." Alexander interrupted. "That child has the right to be born."

Silence fell between them.

Evelyn said quietly, "I'm unfit to be a mother."

"That's not what I meant." He rubbed his temples irritably. "Let's change the subject."

"Natalie wants to keep the baby. She's been begging me."

"You agreed?"

"The final decision isn't mine."

Alexander nodded. "Understood. I'll handle this."

Evelyn blinked. "You know what I'm asking?"

"Dealing with Simon, right?" He sounded confident. "If he insists on keeping the baby, his mother can't force Natalie to go to Hong Kong."

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"One more thing." She met his gaze squarely. "Annabelle helped Mrs. Stapleton pressure me into performing a gender test on Natalie today."

Alexander's expression darkened. "You didn't—"

"I threw liquid at her."

He visibly relaxed. "Good. She deserved that."

"It wasn't water... It was urine."

His face froze. Shock, disgust, and confusion flickered across his features.

"Want to avenge her?" Evelyn squared her shoulders. "I'm ready."

Alexander suddenly laughed. "With what ammunition? My bladder's currently empty."

"You're not angry?"

He opened the car door. "No wonder she kept calling this morning..."

"She told you?"

"I was in meetings. Didn't answer."

"Then she must be furious now."

Alexander lowered his lashes, his voice turning icy. "Let her stay furious."
###Chapter 131: A Heart Misplaced

The black Maybach screeched to a halt outside the Military Medical Hospital in the eastern district.

The tires' piercing squeal startled sparrows from the treetops.

Evelyn Carter had just unbuckled her seatbelt when fragmented voices drifted from the hospital room.

"...Mom, it's Margaret. Don't you recognize me?"

"Margaret?"

"Yes, yes! I'm your daughter-in-law Margaret."

"Shouldn't Alexander be home from school by now? I made osmanthus cakes..."

Margaret Hamilton's muffled sobs filtered through the door. "Mom, Alexander is in his thirties..."

Alexander Hamilton shoved the door open violently.

On the bed, Grandma Hamilton wore an oxygen mask, her clouded eyes wandering aimlessly.

"Grandma." Alexander dropped to one knee beside her.

Margaret hastily wiped her tears. "Look, Mom. Alexander's here."

A skeletal hand trembled upward before falling limply. "No...my Alexander is only this tall..."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "Grandma, I've grown up."

"Where's Evelyn?" The old woman suddenly became agitated. "Has Evelyn come?"

Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, her breath catching.

The room reeked of antiseptic and impending death. Heart monitor beeps punctuated the silence as IV fluid dripped methodically.

Margaret approached with red-rimmed eyes. "The doctors say it's multi-organ failure..."

Evelyn counted the needle marks covering the old woman's papery skin.

"Her heart stopped this morning." Margaret's voice shook. "The medications are barely sustaining her now."

A shrill alarm erupted from the monitors.

Nurses rushed in to adjust settings until Grandma Hamilton's breathing stabilized.

"She's been asking for you." Margaret clutched Evelyn's icy fingers. "Kept calling for her granddaughter-in-law..."

The bedridden woman's eyes flew open. "Evelyn!"

Age-spotted hands seized Evelyn's wrist with shocking strength.

"I'm here, Grandma."

"Alexander wronged you..." Tears carved paths through wrinkled skin. "That Annabelle is no good..."

Silence swallowed the room.

Margaret shook her head frantically. "I never mentioned the divorce..."

The heart monitor's line spiked erratically.

"Did the surgery hurt?" Grandma Hamilton's sudden question struck like lightning. "They said you removed my great-grandchild..."

Evelyn whirled toward Alexander. His face had drained of all color.
###Chapter 132: The Final Message

Grandma Hamilton's gaze slowly settled on Evelyn's flat abdomen, a glimmer of understanding flashing in her clouded eyes.

"Grandma, don't overthink it. Alexander and I—"

"Silly child," Grandma Hamilton shook her head gently. "I already know."

Evelyn's heart clenched.

"You all think I'm senile, don't you? That I can't even recognize people anymore?"

"That's not true—"

"This morning, a little girl came to see me," Grandma Hamilton suddenly smiled, the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes smoothing out. "She wore a floral dress and had her hair in braids. So pretty."

Evelyn's fingers unconsciously tightened around the hospital bed railing.

"She called me Great-Grandma and even sang for me." Grandma Hamilton squinted as she recalled. "Her voice was lovely, except... she kept singing 'bird, bird.'"

Alexander frowned. "Bird?"

"Yes," Grandma Hamilton turned to Evelyn. "Do you know what song it was?"

Evelyn's throat tightened.

Not "bird."

It was "hush, little baby."

The lullaby she used to play on repeat for her unborn child.

"Hush, little baby..." she hummed softly, her voice trembling slightly.

Grandma Hamilton's eyes lit up. "That's the one! The child sang it so beautifully."

The air in the room froze.

Margaret bit her lip hard, silent tears rolling down her cheeks. Alexander turned his face away, his Adam's apple bobbing violently.

"Evelyn," Grandma Hamilton grasped her hand weakly. "The child asked me to tell you... she doesn't blame you. She just... misses you terribly."

Evelyn's tears fell onto the white hospital sheets, leaving dark stains.

"I'll be leaving soon too," Grandma Hamilton panted. "I had to deliver this message before I go."

"Please don't say that—"

"Margaret, Alexander, come here."

Margaret hastily wiped her tears and moved to the bedside with Alexander.

Grandma Hamilton's breathing grew labored. The numbers on the monitor steadily declined.

"I'll get the doctor!" Evelyn turned to rush out.

The door burst open.

"Alexander!" Annabelle's shrill voice cut through the air. "I knew you'd be here!"

She stood in the doorway, her pregnant belly prominent, her gaze darting between Evelyn and Alexander. Her face was livid.
###Chapter 133: The Enraged Lion

Annabelle Taylor's hand rose high in the air.

Evelyn Carter instinctively shut her eyes.

Slap!

The sharp sound of the blow echoed through the hospital room.

But the expected pain never came. Evelyn opened her eyes to find Alexander Hamilton shielding her.

His gold-rimmed glasses hung crookedly on his face, a vivid red handprint blooming across his left cheek.

The room fell into a deathly silence.

"Alexander Hamilton, how dare you betray me!" Annabelle shrieked hysterically. "I'll make you regret this for the rest of your life!"

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat.

Alexander remained motionless, his head still tilted from the impact. Behind his lenses, his eyes narrowed dangerously.

She had never seen him like this before.

Like a provoked beast, every muscle in his body tensed, ready to strike.

Evelyn suddenly remembered what Richard Jackson had once said.

The gentle, refined Alexander was merely a facade.

"Are you... okay?" she ventured cautiously.

Alexander slowly lifted his gaze, his eyes sharp as blades. Evelyn immediately fell silent.

"You bitch!" Annabelle turned on Evelyn, venom dripping from her words. "Stop pretending to be innocent! Desperate for a man, aren't you? I'll pay for one to screw you to death—"

"Annabelle!" Margaret Hamilton snapped sharply. "Your grandmother is right here!"

Annabelle ignored her, raising her hand to strike again.

This time, Alexander seized her wrist.

"Enough," he growled, each word gritted through clenched teeth. "Don't force me to act here."

Annabelle writhed and screamed. "You brought her to see Grandma? I'm your girlfriend!"

She lunged toward the hospital bed. "Grandma, look at me! I'm the one who—"

"Stop!" Margaret hastily intercepted her.

Grandma Hamilton's mouth opened in horror, but only strangled gasps escaped.

Annabelle struggled like a madwoman. "Grandma! I'm your granddaughter-in-law! This slut—"

"Shut your mouth!" Alexander roared.

He yanked Annabelle away with such force that she staggered and slammed into the wall.

The entire room seemed to tremble.

Evelyn saw Alexander's hands shaking—not from fear, but from barely restrained fury.

Behind his glasses, his eyes were terrifyingly dark.
###Chapter 134: I Must Have Been Blind to Love You for So Long

Margaret Hamilton trembled as she clutched Grandma Hamilton’s frail hand, leaning closer to the elderly woman’s cracked lips. "Mom, what do you want to say?"

The old woman’s throat emitted a hoarse, rattling breath. Her clouded eyes remained fixed on the ceiling, her wrinkled fingers clawing weakly at the air.

"Annabelle, shut up!" Margaret turned with tear-streaked fury. "These are her last words!"

But Annabelle Taylor was beyond reason. Even as Alexander Hamilton restrained her, she thrashed like a wild thing. "Evelyn Carter, you bitch! So what if the old hag favored you on her deathbed? Alexander loves me! Always has, always will!"

The heart monitor shrieked a single, unbroken tone.

The green line that had pulsed with life moments ago flattened into a cold, unfeeling straight line.

Margaret collapsed onto the hospital bed, her wail of grief tearing through the room. "Mom—!"

Grandma Hamilton’s eyes stayed open, her lips still parted as if mid-sentence—but no sound would ever come again.

Annabelle froze. She stared at the flatlining monitor for a beat before letting out a derisive laugh. "That’s it? She’s dead? How anticlimactic."

Alexander released his grip on her and staggered to his knees beside the bed. His bloodshot eyes locked onto Evelyn’s, his throat working as if swallowing glass.

"I’ll get the doctor." Evelyn turned away, her voice unsteady.

Margaret grabbed her sleeve like a lost child. "Evelyn, she—"

"I know." Evelyn gently squeezed her hand. "But we still need the doctor."

As she moved to leave, Annabelle flung out her arms, blocking the doorway. "Running away?"

Crack!

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

Annabelle stumbled back, clutching her cheek with a shriek. "Alexander! You’re just going to let her hit me?!"

Still kneeling, Alexander pressed his forehead against the edge of the bed. Margaret’s fists rained down on his back as she sobbed, "This is all your fault! You brought this monster into our home!"

"Alexander!" Annabelle screamed, hysterical.

Slowly, he lifted his head. His eyes were blood-red. "I’m not deaf."

"What?"

"I was blind." His voice was raw, barely human. "To have loved you for so many years."

The room plunged into suffocating silence.

Only the heart monitor’s relentless drone remained—a dull blade sawing through every frayed nerve.
###Chapter 135: Who's the Real Homewrecker?

"You're lying, Alexander Hamilton!" Annabelle Taylor shrieked hysterically, her nails digging into her palms. "What does Grandma's death have to do with me? If you hadn't brought this bitch here, none of this would've happened! It's all her fault!"

Alexander's gaze turned razor-sharp, his voice icy. "Shut up. You know exactly who the real homewrecker is. Get out."

Annabelle trembled with rage, her tears smearing her makeup. "Fine, Alexander! How dare you speak to me like this! I'm breaking up with you!"

"Good riddance." He smirked. "The door's right there. Don't let it hit you on the way out."

"You—" Her chest heaved before a vicious smile twisted her lips. "Even if we're over, I won't let this slut have her happy ending!"

The door burst open. Medical staff rushed in, led by Evelyn's senior colleague. The doctor froze at the sight of Annabelle's contorted expression.

"Evelyn, what's going on?"

Evelyn swallowed her grief. "Save the patient first..."

Defibrillator. Pacemaker. Epinephrine. Every life-saving measure was deployed.

The flatline on the monitor delivered its cruel verdict.

Wiping sweat from his brow, the doctor shook his head solemnly. "Time of death... I'm sorry."

"Mom—" Margaret Hamilton's anguished wail broke off as she collapsed.

"Doctor!" Alexander caught his mother.

"Blood pressure's 220! Critical!" The doctor barked orders. "Does anyone know her antihypertensive meds?"

Alexander paled. "I don't remember the names—"

"Rosuvastatin and aspirin," Evelyn answered instantly.

The doctor nodded. "Get them now!"

Annabelle shoved forward. "I'm the daughter-in-law here."

The doctor glanced at Evelyn, who whispered, "What needs to be done?"

"We need to remove her outerwear and loosen undergarments for breathing. As a male physician, I can't—"

"I'll do it." Annabelle stepped forward, her pregnant belly leading.

The doctor eyed her swollen abdomen. "You're in no condition. Dr. Carter should—"

"No!" Annabelle snapped. "That whore has no right touching my mother-in-law!"

The doctor's expression darkened. "Every second counts. Are you willing to risk her life?"

"I—"

Alexander cut in. "Evelyn, please."

Evelyn moved to unbutton Margaret's collar—when a dull thud sounded behind her.

She turned.

And gasped.
###Chapter 136: No Choice

Alexander Hamilton gripped Annabelle Taylor's chin with one hand while lifting her entire body with the other.

Annabelle dangled in the air, struggling like a rabbit caught by its ears.

"Alexander!" Evelyn Carter frowned. "She's pregnant."

"I know my limits."

Annabelle's eyes widened in terror, a whimper escaping her throat.

She finally realized the true danger of the man before her, her struggles gradually weakening.

The resident doctor watched nervously. "Dr. Carter, should we intervene?"

Evelyn continued unbuttoning Margaret Hamilton's blouse with gentle precision.

"That's none of my concern."

The mercury column in the blood pressure monitor rose steadily as Evelyn maintained her calm focus.

Thirty minutes later, Margaret's blood pressure finally stabilized.

Evelyn quietly closed the door behind her, greeted by the sterile chill of the hospital corridor.

Alexander stood with his phone to his ear, immediately ending the call when he saw her.

"How's my mother?"

"Her pressure has lowered, but she needs complete rest."

"I've arranged for hospitalization."

Evelyn instantly understood his reasoning.

The hospital was safer than home, with the VIP ward's security keeping unwanted visitors at bay.

"Your decision."

"Everything's settled." Alexander's voice dropped. "She's been taken away."

"She went willingly?"

Alexander gave a cold laugh before his expression softened. "Did I frighten you earlier?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"I lost control."

"I noticed."

"You mentioned needing help?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Never mind. You have enough to deal with."

She'd considered asking Alexander to warn Simon Stapleton, but realized external intervention wouldn't solve the root problem.

"Are you sure?"

"Yes. I can handle it."

Alexander watched her walk away until her figure disappeared down the corridor.

"Alexander."

Margaret's frail voice called from the hospital room.

He returned swiftly to her bedside, adjusting her blanket.

"Mother, how are you feeling?"

"I'll be fine." Margaret sighed. "I only regret not hearing your grandmother's final words..."

Alexander remained silent.

"We owe Evelyn so much today." Margaret studied him. "This is the second time she's saved me."

"I know."

"What about Annabelle?"

"Sent back to the rehabilitation center."

Margaret nodded. "Some quiet will do her good. But your Aunt Olivia—"

Her words were interrupted by the sudden ringing of a phone.
###Chapter 137: Breaking Up

Emily Zhang's voice came through the phone, laced with awkwardness. "Mr. Hamilton, Andy Taylor is in trouble again."

Alexander Hamilton's fingers tightened around his phone. "Another honey trap?"

"This time it's more complicated..." Emily hesitated. "They're demanding three million in hush money or they'll go public."

"When will he ever learn to control himself?" Alexander's voice was icy.

"It involves two female students..." Emily added with difficulty. "Minors."

Alexander stood abruptly, his chair screeching across the floor. "Was he driving my car?"

"Yes."

"In the car?"

"...Yes."

"Get rid of that vehicle immediately." Alexander's voice simmered with suppressed rage. "Call the police now."

"But Andy—"

"He deserves it." Alexander cut her off. "Handle company matters for now. I need to care for my mother and arrange Grandma's funeral."

After hanging up, Margaret Hamilton looked over with concern. "Company trouble?"

Alexander massaged his temples. "Minor issues."

"Go handle it. Auntie Marry can take care of me."

"It can wait." Alexander pocketed his phone, gazing at the rain outside. "Family comes first right now."

...

Saturday morning found Evelyn Carter organizing groceries in her new kitchen.

The doorbell rang, followed by Vivian Dempsey's energetic voice through the door. "Dr. Carter! Housewarming time!"

Evelyn opened the door to find Vivian laden with shopping bags, Gregory Wilson standing behind her holding flowers.

"Congratulations on your new place." Gregory smiled, offering the bouquet.

Evelyn accepted the flowers, giving Vivian a pointed look. "I thought it was just us two?"

Vivian winked. "Free labor—why not use it?"

As they entered, Vivian surveyed the one-bedroom apartment. "So small?"

"It's enough." Evelyn arranged the flowers in a vase. "I'll upgrade after buying a proper home."

Vivian suddenly leaned in, whispering conspiratorially. "Guess what gossip I heard? Alexander and Annabelle are breaking up!"

Evelyn's hands stilled momentarily. "Not my concern."

"Apparently Annabelle overstepped by meddling in company affairs until Alexander finally had enough." Vivian gestured excitedly. "Karma's a bitch!"

Gregory smoothly changed the subject. "Need help with lunch preparations?"

Vivian immediately pushed him toward the kitchen. "Absolutely! You're head chef today!"

Watching their bustling figures, Evelyn exhaled softly. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting warm patches across her new home's floors.
###Chapter 138: Specifically Requesting You

Evelyn responded softly, "Did you come all this way just to say that?"

"Shouldn't we celebrate?"

"Celebrate what?"

Vivian nudged her with her shoulder. "Doesn't it feel amazing to finally get justice?"

Evelyn fell silent for a moment before shaking her head slowly.

Alexander Hamilton wasn't a scoundrel.

Compared to someone like Simon Stapleton, at least he was honorable.

Ten years of unwavering devotion, yet he never forced anything. When she married, he quietly stepped aside.

During their marriage, he had been dutiful, gentle, and considerate.

Apart from not loving her, he truly had no flaws.

But she hadn't married him for love either.

Their marriage had always been transactional.

Vivian clicked her tongue. "You're really good at making excuses for him. When that mistress walked all over you, he didn't lift a finger to protect you."

"I don't need protection."

"Maybe not," Vivian tilted her chin toward the kitchen. "But someone like Dr. Wilson would be a good choice. Why not reconsider?"

Evelyn countered, "Why did you change your name to Vivian Dempsey?"

"To cut off love and desire."

"Are you happy now?"

"Absolutely. I do whatever I want."

Evelyn smiled. "If you can do it, I want to try too."

Vivian was momentarily speechless. After a long pause, she said, "Not even a sliver of hope?"

"If I'm going to reject someone, I won't leave them with false hope." Evelyn's expression was firm. "Dinner today, gifts tomorrow—it only leads to misunderstandings. I won't become another Annabelle."

Finally, Vivian understood her resolve.

"Fine. I won't play matchmaker anymore."

"We still have to work together at the hospital. Don't make it awkward."

"Got it..."

Suddenly, a phone rang in the living room.

Gregory Wilson answered, his expression growing increasingly grave.

Vivian walked over. "Hospital emergency?"

"I need to go back."

"They're calling you right after your shift? Is Anesthesiology that short-staffed?"

Gregory didn't answer. Instead, his gaze drifted toward the kitchen.

Evelyn was focused on preparing ingredients, deliberately avoiding interaction.

Vivian caught on. "Go ahead. Evelyn's a doctor too—she gets how demanding this job is. Honestly, marrying a fellow doctor is the worst. You could live together and still never see each other..."

Gregory heard the implication but spoke anyway. "Evelyn, the chief wants you to come too."

"Pregnant patient?"

"It's Annabelle." He paused. "She specifically asked for you."

Outside the hospital, Evelyn finally understood the chief's concern.

Annabelle stood by the roadside, her pregnant belly prominent, a syringe pressed against her neck.
###Chapter 139: I Know Her Intentions

The hospital entrance was swarmed with people.

Medical staff, patients' families, and passersby all stopped to watch.

Annabelle Taylor stood at the edge of the road, her toes already crossing the solid line.

A black sedan roared past, nearly grazing her clothes.

"Miss Taylor!" The hospital director wiped sweat from his brow. "Please step back. Let's talk this through—"

Annabelle ignored him, her gaze fixed on the hospital doors. "Where is she?"

"She's on her way. Just wait a little longer—"

The director cautiously took a step forward.

Annabelle immediately retreated. Another car barely avoided her, its screeching brakes piercing the air.

"Get back!" she shrieked hysterically. "Come any closer and I'll jump!"

From the back of the crowd, Evelyn Carter and Gregory Wilson arrived in a hurry.

"How did she become like this?" Evelyn stared in disbelief at the disheveled woman.

Gregory pocketed his phone. "The police are coming. Stay back."

But just then, Annabelle turned and locked eyes with Evelyn.

"You bitch!" she screamed hoarsely. "Hiding like a coward? You had the nerve to seduce someone else's husband but not face me?"

Every head turned toward Evelyn.

She took a deep breath. "I have to go to her."

Gregory grabbed her arm. "It's too dangerous."

Evelyn pointed toward the emergency entrance. "Look—ambulances can't even get through."

Gregory's brow furrowed.

"She's here for me." Evelyn pulled free. "This ends now."

She strode forward, stopping at a safe distance. "I'm here. What do you want?"

Annabelle burst into manic laughter. "Everyone, look! This is Dr. Carter from Central Hospital! A so-called angel in white who steals pregnant women's husbands!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"That's a lie!" The director stomped his foot. "Dr. Carter and Mr. Hamilton are legally married—"

"Legally?" Annabelle cut him off sharply. "Alexander and I shared twenty years! What right does she have?!"

The director glanced at Evelyn, questioning.

Evelyn didn't deny it.

"Evelyn..." The director hesitated.

She gave a slight shake of her head and stepped closer.
###Chapter 140: Burden of Proof

The syringe glinted coldly in the sunlight.

Annabelle Taylor pressed the needle against her carotid artery, her fingers trembling slightly. "Take one more step, and I'll inject myself!"

Evelyn Carter stopped in her tracks.

The corner of her lips curled. "Be my guest."

"If I die here, your hospital's reputation will be ruined!"

"Miss Taylor," Evelyn's voice was eerily calm, "are you sure you want to escalate this?"

"Absolutely! If I'm miserable, you won't get off easy either!"

"Fine."

Annabelle faltered at her composure. "...What are you planning?"

"Olivia."

Olivia Lightfoot, standing nearby, immediately understood. She turned and hurried into the hospital building.

Within three minutes, she returned pushing an office chair, a manila folder in hand.

Evelyn took the folder and flipped through it leisurely. "Go ahead. List my scandals. One by one."

"What is that?" Annabelle eyed the documents warily.

"Medical records." Evelyn looked up. "Care to see?"

Annabelle suddenly burst into loud sobs. "Everyone, look at this! This is the kind of doctor Central Hospital employs! She seduces married men and still acts so brazen! And I'm pregnant..."

The crowd began to murmur.

Whispers rippled through the onlookers.

The elderly dean, supported by several doctors, sat on a flowerbed ledge, stomping his feet in distress. "What do we do... She's pregnant..."

Olivia placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "Don't worry, Dean. Dr. Carter has it under control."

Gregory Wilson moved through the crowd and positioned himself two meters behind Evelyn.

Seeing public opinion sway in her favor, Annabelle's voice grew shriller. "Dr. Carter! As head of OB-GYN, do you even know what shame is?!"

Evelyn continued flipping through the records expressionlessly.

"All you expectant mothers, keep an eye on your husbands! Women like her prey on pregnant women!"

The file reached its last page.

Evelyn snapped it shut with a crisp thwack.

"Finished?"

"You owe me an explanation! Why did you seduce my husband?!"

Sunlight cast a soft halo over Evelyn's white coat.

She let out a light chuckle. "Miss Taylor, you're a lawyer. In court, the burden of proof lies with the accuser—you claim I seduced your husband. Where's your evidence?"

"I saw it with my own eyes!"

"So you have no proof." Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "But that's alright. I do."

She raised the manila folder.

The crowd fell silent.
###Chapter 141: The Truth Revealed

"Proof?" Annabelle Taylor lifted her chin defiantly.

Evelyn Carter calmly unlocked her phone. "Our marriage certificate."

"Hah," Annabelle scoffed. "Carrying it around with you? Must be fake."

Evelyn turned the screen toward her. "Digital certificates are standard now. Marriage and divorce records are all online and verifiable."

Annabelle's smirk froze.

"You can see both the marriage date and the divorce date." Evelyn's voice was soft but crystal clear. "Alexander and I finalized our divorce two months ago. Meanwhile, your baby—"

Her gaze dropped meaningfully to Annabelle's swollen belly.

Gasps erupted from the onlookers.

"That belly looks at least seven months along!"

"Could be twins?"

"Two months in, you'd barely hear a heartbeat. No way it's that big already!"

Whispers swirled like leaves in the wind.

Evelyn pulled a color printout from her folder.

"What's that?" Annabelle demanded, eyes narrowing.

"Your surgical photos from the first car accident." Evelyn covered the top half, revealing only a dark brown mass below. "You were five months pregnant then. Nearly lost the baby."

Annabelle's face drained of color. "My child couldn’t possibly look like that!"

"Because," Evelyn enunciated slowly, "the father was most likely Black."

The room exploded.

"Black?!"

"So her husband’s foreign?"

"Wait, the digital certificate showed a Chinese name!"

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Of course, it could also be Indian, Southeast Asian, or Latino." She paused. "But definitely not Asian."

Annabelle turned paper-white.
###Chapter 142: The Bloodstained Choice

Annabelle Taylor's face drained of all color in an instant.

Evelyn Carter caught the flicker of shock and panic in her eyes.

It seemed even Annabelle herself wasn't certain about the baby's paternity.

"As a doctor, I shouldn't disclose patient confidentiality." Evelyn's voice was measured and clear. "Ms. Taylor has every right to sue me for privacy violation. I accept that. But—"

Her sharp gaze swept over the crowd. "Ms. Taylor has publicly slandered me and damaged this hospital's reputation. I must set the record straight. This isn't just about our credibility—it affects every expectant mother's trust in our care."

Evelyn rose gracefully, her skirt swaying. "I've said my piece. Does Ms. Taylor have anything to add?"

The air turned to ice.

The biracial baby's skin tone was a slap across Annabelle's face.

Evelyn almost laughed.

A darkly humorous thought crossed her mind—what expression would Alexander Hamilton wear when this Black child was born?

Would he still let the baby bear the Hamilton name?

If he could stomach that, she'd truly admire his "magnanimity."

"Nothing else?" Evelyn pressed. When Annabelle remained silent, she addressed the crowd. "Please disperse. This is an emergency access lane—"

"Look out!"

A scream shattered the tension.

Evelyn whirled around to see Annabelle sprinting madly into oncoming traffic.

Screeching brakes tore through the air.

"Car accident!"

"Call an ambulance!"

Chaos erupted. Thankfully, Olivia Lightfoot arrived with security, swiftly restoring order.

ER staff rushed over with a stretcher. Annabelle lay bleeding on the pavement, whisked away to surgery.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

......

Five hours later, the OR lights finally dimmed.

The lead surgeon, Dr. Porter—nearing retirement—was drained. Gregory Wilson supported her as she emerged, her white coat soaked with sweat.

Olivia handed her water.

"We lost the baby," Dr. Porter rasped.

Olivia exhaled in relief. "At least the mother survived. With her cervical cerclage history, I feared—"

Gregory's gaze lingered on Evelyn. "The impact was severe. Her survival is miraculous."

Olivia muttered, "Thank God it wasn't a maternal-fetal death. Otherwise, Dr. Carter would never clear her name..."

Noticing Evelyn's silence, Gregory called softly, "Evelyn?"

No response.

"Evelyn?" His voice trembled slightly this time.
###Chapter 143 The President's Wife
The fluorescent lights in the emergency room stung the eyes.

Evelyn Carter rubbed her temples as Gregory Wilson's deep voice reached her ears. "You look pale. Let me take you home."

She was about to decline when sudden commotion erupted from the elevator bay.

"That bitch Evelyn Carter, come out here!"

A red-haired young man barged into the corridor, the studs on his leather jacket glinting coldly under the lights. His entourage of similarly dressed lackeys trailed behind like a flock of ruffled roosters.

Olivia Lightfoot instinctively stepped in front of Evelyn.

Gregory strode forward, the hem of his white coat slicing through the air. "No disturbances in the hospital."

"None of your damn business!" The redhead shoved him aside. "Where's that OB-GYN bitch? My sister's lying in there!"

The sound of rolling wheels approached from behind.

A woman in a wheelchair extended a trembling hand as her husband pushed her forward. "Andy... stop this..."

"Auntie!" The young man jutted his chin defiantly. "That doctor caused my sister's car accident. I'm getting answers today!"

Evelyn studied the aggressive youth, suddenly recalling Alexander Hamilton's mention of Annabelle Taylor's troublesome cousin—Andy Taylor.

"Who's your sister?" Gregory asked coldly.

Andy puffed out his chest. "The wife of Hamilton Group's CEO! My brother-in-law could have you all fired with one word!"

The corridor fell silent.

Gregory suddenly smiled, his gaze sharp as a scalpel behind his glasses. "Is that so? What a coincidence."

"What's so funny?"

"Your information's outdated." Gregory peeled off his gloves deliberately. "Alexander announced their divorce at this morning's board meeting."

Andy's face froze.

The woman in the wheelchair began coughing violently as her husband patted her back. "Honey, calm down..."

"Impossible!" Andy exploded. "My brother-in-law's been devoted to my sister for over a decade! There's no way they'd divorce!"

Gregory turned to Evelyn, his lips curving meaningfully. "You'll have to ask Dr. Carter about that."
###Chapter 144: More Than Just a Man

"What do you mean by that?"

"Exactly what I said."

"Hah... A mere anesthesiologist dares speak to me like this? Where's your attending physician, that Dr. Carter? Hiding?"

The elderly couple behind him continued pleading: "Andy... Please don't..."

"Uncle, Aunt, you're too soft-hearted! My sister has been wronged like this—I won't let it slide!"

Seeing their efforts futile, the old couple stepped forward themselves.

The middle-aged man settled his wife in the wheelchair and approached calmly. "Doctor, I apologize. Andy is just overly concerned about his sister. How is my daughter Annabelle doing?"

The couple carried themselves with quiet dignity.

Their modest yet refined attire and courteous speech couldn't mask their underlying distress.

Gregory Wilson's tone softened slightly. "Given her advanced pregnancy, the situation was indeed critical. She's stabilized after emergency treatment but requires hospitalization for observation."

The man visibly relaxed. "Thank goodness..."

"The baby... Ask about the baby..." the woman in the wheelchair rasped.

"Doctor, what about the—"

"I'm afraid we couldn't save the fetus."

"How could..." The man's eyes reddened instantly. "Why would she act so recklessly... Alexander will be devastated..."

Andy Taylor exploded again. "The Hamilton heir is gone just like that? This hospital must answer for it!"

Olivia Lightfoot snapped. "Then why don't you call Mr. Hamilton here yourself?"

"You think I won't? When my brother-in-law arrives, none of you will escape consequences!"

"Go ahead! Let him see what his precious 'heir' actually looks like—"

"Olivia." Evelyn Carter cut in sharply.

Olivia protested. "Dr. Carter! He should see—"

"Today is Grandma Hamilton's funeral."

Olivia immediately fell silent.

News of the Hamilton matriarch's passing had spread through the hospital like wildfire.

The Hamilton family's prominence was one reason. The other was the undignified manner of her departure.

Already on her deathbed finalizing arrangements, Annabelle's explosive outburst had left everyone questioning whether the elderly woman died naturally—or from sheer fury.

Especially since Annabelle had previously disrupted Margaret Hamilton's emergency care. This incident only cemented her reputation.

Evelyn had learned of the funeral through Margaret's message the previous night.

The older woman mentioned how fond Grandma Hamilton had been of Evelyn, hoping she'd attend to bid farewell.

With Alexander Hamilton standing alone in that desolate memorial hall, Evelyn ultimately declined.

She was no longer part of the Hamilton family. Her presence would be inappropriate.

But she intended to visit the cemetery privately afterward.

Margaret seemed to have anticipated this, sighing without pressing further. She only added, "This has shaken Alexander deeply. He and Annabelle... may not last."

Evelyn pretended not to catch the implication. "Take care of yourself. Children must find their own paths."

Margaret tactfully changed the subject.

Evelyn had assumed Annabelle would lie low after this incident—at least until delivery. Never expecting she'd storm the hospital instead.

Gregory's brow furrowed. "Is she insane? Risking her life just to tarnish your reputation?"

Evelyn shook her head.

She didn't understand either.

Their interactions had been minimal. The only point of contention was the title of Mrs. Hamilton—which Evelyn had relinquished voluntarily, without demanding compensation. By all logic, it should have ended there.

Yet Annabelle's malice seemed to stem from something... far beyond just a man.

At that moment, a piercing gaze sliced through the crowd, locking onto her.

Andy narrowed his eyes suddenly. "How did you know about the Hamilton funeral today?"
###Chapter 145: That Child Isn't Mine

Olivia Lightfoot stomped her foot anxiously. "Dr. Carter once saved Grandma Hamilton's life. The old lady has always trusted her..."

"I am Dr. Carter."

Olivia shook her head frantically. "Dr. Carter, please don't—"

Evelyn Carter yanked Olivia behind her. Gregory Wilson stepped forward instinctively, shielding Olivia completely.

Andy Taylor exploded with rage. "So it's you! You look decent, but how could you do something so shameless?!"

He swung his fist toward her.

"Andy, stop—"

The middle-aged couple's protests couldn't restrain his fury.

The punch whistled through the air.

"Watch out!"

"Evelyn!"

Everyone held their breath. Gregory tensed, ready to intervene—but the fist froze just an inch from Evelyn's nose.

Andy gaped in shock. "You... you're not scared?"

"Go ahead."

His face flushed crimson. "You think I won't?!"

He swung again, but his arm seemed held back by an invisible force.

Evelyn didn't even blink.

Andy seethed with humiliation. "You must've set a trap! Are you recording this? Or planning to extort me? Oh, I get it—you're a doctor. You could fake a severe injury report and—"

"If I wanted money, wouldn't Alexander Hamilton be an easier target?"

Andy whirled toward the couple. "Aunt, Uncle, you heard that! She's after money!"

"If money was the goal, your sister wouldn't even have gotten past the Hamiltons' doorstep."

Andy jumped in fury. "Mr. Hamilton only saw you as my sister's replacement! Now that she's back, why won't you disappear? You're just jealous she could bear his child!"

Olivia finally snapped. "Please! Whose child it really is—don't you know?"

Andy paled. "How dare you! My aunt has heart problems. If she gets upset—"

"Then who's spreading lies here?"

"Andy..." The middle-aged woman trembled. "Annabelle's baby... isn't Alexander's?"

"Of course it's Mr. Hamilton's—"

The elevator dinged open.

Alexander Hamilton strode forward, his voice icy. "That child has nothing to do with me."
###Chapter 146: Don't Blame Me for Being Ruthless

The black suit accentuated Alexander Hamilton's tall frame. The black boutonniere on his chest silently declared his recent return from a funeral.

Andy Taylor shrank behind Mr. and Mrs. Taylor the moment he spotted Alexander.

"Mr. Hamilton," he stammered.

Alexander ignored him, nodding only to the elder Taylors. "Uncle Taylor. Auntie Taylor."

Mr. Taylor looked ashamed. "Alexander, we're so sorry we couldn't attend Grandma Hamilton's funeral. But Annabelle's situation..."

Mrs. Taylor, seated in her wheelchair, trembled as she clutched Alexander's sleeve. "Alexander..."

His gaze slid past her, landing on Evelyn Carter. Only when his sleeve was tugged did he look back.

"How did you learn about Annabelle's condition?" His voice was low. "Did Andy bring you here?"

His sharp stare pinned Andy like a knife.

Andy turned pale, nearly hiding behind the wheelchair.

"Alexander," Mr. Taylor sighed, "we know you care for Annabelle, but she's our daughter..."

Alexander's brow furrowed—whether from grief or frustration over Annabelle's drama was unclear.

"Alexander," Mr. Taylor suddenly remembered, "you mentioned the baby in Annabelle's womb..."

"It's not mine." The words were final.

Mrs. Taylor gasped. "Impossible! You two were—"

"We broke up long ago." Alexander cut her off.

Olivia Lightfoot couldn't resist interjecting. "Auntie, haven't you seen the full video?"

"What full video?" Mrs. Taylor looked lost.

Andy stayed silent despite her questioning.

"Andy." Alexander's voice was glacial.

Andy trembled. "Mr. Hamilton, my sister asked me to bring them..."

"What else did she say?"

"..."

"Speak!"

"She... she said since Grandma Hamilton passed, you refused to see her. She thought if our elders pressured you..."

Alexander laughed bitterly. "My grandmother was buried today, and she chose today to make a scene? Auntie's health is fragile—does she care? First my grandmother, now her own mother?"

Andy curled into himself.

"Mr. Hamilton," he whispered, "she's just afraid of losing you... It's that female doctor's fault—"

"Enough!"

Alexander's voice cracked like a whip. "Was I supposed to stay celibate while she married abroad? Should I raise another man's child the moment she returned?"

He turned to the Taylors, each word deliberate. "Let me make this clear: Evelyn is my lawful wife. She is not the other woman."

His gaze swept over Andy. "Harass her again, and don't blame me for being ruthless."
###Chapter 147: Young Love Fades to Emptiness

"Brother-in-law!" Andy Taylor jumped in agitation. "Have you lost your mind? Evelyn Carter is just a replacement!"

Alexander Hamilton's gaze turned icy.

"Shut up."

"But—"

"From now on, don't call me brother-in-law."

The words sliced through the air like a blade.

Olivia Lightfoot gasped and instinctively moved closer to me.

Gregory Wilson remained leaning against the wall, a faint smirk playing on his lips. As the Wilson family heir, he knew the secrets of high society better than anyone.

Especially since his younger brother, Vincent Wilson, had already gossiped about Alexander and Annabelle Taylor's past.

Mr. Taylor paled. "Alexander, what do you mean by that?"

"Mr. Taylor," Alexander's voice was low. "People change."

"Is it because of the baby—"

"No."

The hospital corridor fell into an eerie silence.

"Then why?" Mr. Taylor's voice trembled.

Gregory suddenly spoke up. "Because of the old lady's death."

"What?!"

"Before Mrs. Hamilton passed, Miss Taylor caused a scene in her hospital room." Gregory enunciated each word. "The old woman died with regrets."

Mr. Taylor staggered back two steps, staring at Andy in disbelief.

Andy lowered his head, fingers digging into his palms.

Mrs. Taylor covered her mouth as tears spilled over.

"There's more." Olivia couldn't hold back any longer. "That child... is mixed-race."

"What?!"

"A dark-skinned mixed-race child." Olivia sneered. "If you don't believe me, you can go see for yourself right now."

Mr. Taylor shook violently. "Andy! What the hell is going on?!"

Andy dropped to his knees. "Uncle, I really didn't know—"

"Tell the truth!"

"...It's true." Andy's voice was barely audible.

Mrs. Taylor let out a piercing wail before collapsing to the floor.

###Chapter 148 Her problems aren’t mine.

"Auntie! Auntie—"

"Call a doctor, now!"

Mrs. Taylor collapsed, her face deathly pale. Medical staff rushed over with an emergency gurney.

Andy Taylor and Mr. Taylor scrambled after them toward the emergency room, but Alexander Hamilton stayed rooted in place, his dark gaze fixed on me.

"Aren’t you going to help?" I met his eyes. "Andy’s in no state to be useful right now."

His brow furrowed. "Are you okay?"

"Why wouldn’t I be?"

"Did Andy... do anything to you?"

"He tried."

The air around Alexander chilled instantly. "He dared?"

"Empty threats." I adjusted the cuff of my white coat, unfazed. "I’ve dealt with enough hospital troublemakers to know nine out of ten are all bark."

He still looked uneasy. "What if he had actually hit you?"

I pointed to the sleek, metallic machine at the end of the hallway.

Alexander followed my finger, confusion flickering across his face.

"State-of-the-art DNA analyzer. Eight figures." A smirk tugged at my lips. "If he swung, I’d duck behind it. The damages would teach him a lesson he wouldn’t forget."

For a second, Alexander looked like he’d been struck dumb.

"I have my ways with troublemakers."

He exhaled sharply. "Just... glad you’re unharmed."

"We’re not involved anymore. Don’t waste your concern on me." I checked my watch. "Annabelle, though? A miscarriage and today’s drama? You’ll have your hands full comforting her."

"Her problems aren’t mine."

From down the hall, Mr. Taylor’s frantic voice cut in: "Alexander! Hurry!"

I tilted my chin toward the ER. "Andy’s useless. You’d better go."

Alexander studied me intently, his eyes flicking to Gregory Wilson beside me. "Wait for me. We need to talk."

"Alexander!"

"Wait," he insisted.

The moment his back disappeared around the corner, I turned on my heel toward the elevators.

Olivia Lightfoot caught up, practically bouncing. "Dr. Carter! That was so satisfying!"

I flicked her forehead. "Don’t celebrate yet. Pray Mrs. Taylor pulls through."

"Her daughter’s the one who caused this. Why should I care?"

"True," I pressed the elevator button. "But if something does happen to her, could you live with that?"

Olivia pouted, falling silent.

"Think before you act next time."

"...Fine."

I ruffled her hair, smiling. "Still... thank you. For today."

Her grin returned instantly. "That Annabelle’s always rubbed me the wrong way. Her parents seem decent—how’d they raise someone so...?"

"Maybe living abroad made her reckless."

"Reckless doesn’t excuse hurting people."

I nodded. "You’re right."

"Dr. Carter," Olivia dropped her voice, "your ex told you to wait."

The elevator doors slid open. I stepped inside. "Do I seem like the waiting type?"

Today wasn’t even my shift. This circus had already wasted enough of my time.

As for Alexander...

I’d meant it when I said I never wanted to see him again.
###Chapter 149: Evelyn, I Was Wrong

Evelyn Carter packed her belongings on the desk and walked out of the hospital with her bag.

Autumn leaves swirled at her feet as the wind blew. She raised her hand to hail a taxi.

The cemetery was quiet.

Holding the white chrysanthemums she had just bought, she knelt before Grandma Hamilton's gravestone. The elderly woman in the photograph smiled warmly, as if she had returned to the days when Evelyn and Alexander Hamilton were newlyweds—when Grandma had taken her hand and spoken of wanting to hold a great-grandchild.

"Grandma Hamilton, I've come to see you."

She bowed deeply, her eyes growing warm.

"As for the great-grandchild..." She shook her head with a bitter smile. "I'll visit often to talk with you. If you need anything, send me a dream."

Her phone buzzed incessantly as she walked down the hill.

Glancing at the caller ID, she turned it off without hesitation.

At the entrance of her apartment building, Vivian Dempsey paced anxiously.

"Evelyn!" Vivian rushed over and grabbed her arm. "You scared me to death!"

"What's wrong?"

"Alexander has been searching everywhere for you. He couldn’t reach you and thought you—" Vivian abruptly cut herself off. "Never mind. As long as you're safe."

Evelyn took out her keys and unlocked the door.

The kettle in the kitchen let out a sharp whistle.

"Was he here?" Evelyn poured hot water into a cup.

Vivian nodded. "He was frantic. Left just ten minutes ago." She studied Evelyn's expression. "You really don’t know why he was looking for you?"

Evelyn slid a teacup toward her. "Try this. Newly bought Longjing."

"Don’t change the subject!" Vivian stomped her foot, clutching the cup. "The whole city’s talking about that Annabelle situation. That video with the Black child—"

"You saw it?"

"Who hasn’t?" Vivian rolled her eyes. "She’s been flaunting herself with Alexander everywhere, telling people she’s Mrs. Hamilton. Last month at the Full Moon Banquet for the youngest Fu heir, she picked a fight and nearly gave old Mr. Fu a heart attack."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled.

"Full Moon Banquet?"

"Yeah. Rumor has it Alexander got wasted that night." Vivian scoffed. "He went to apologize in person later, but the Fu family already made it clear they’re keeping their distance from the Hamiltons."

The steam from the tea blurred Evelyn’s vision.

Vivian’s phone suddenly rang.

"It’s Alexander," she said, shaking the device. "Should I answer?"

Evelyn set down her cup. "What do you want for dinner? My treat."

Understanding, Vivian pressed accept. "Mr. Hamilton, Evelyn is—"

The howling wind and crashing waves filled the background on the other end.

"Is she with you?" Alexander’s voice was rough with strain.

Vivian turned on speakerphone.

The cry of seagulls carried through the receiver.

"Evelyn," he breathed heavily. "I’m sorry."
###Chapter 150: Belated Regret

Evelyn remained silent.

Alexander said nothing either.

Vivian clutched her phone, barely daring to breathe.

The room was eerily quiet, the only sound being the howling wind from the other end of the call.

After what felt like an eternity, Alexander finally spoke, his voice thick with emotion.

"...I failed Grandma. That time at the resort, when my mother's hypertension nearly delayed her emergency treatment, I should've been more vigilant. But I never imagined she'd dare disturb Grandma... Grandma didn't even get to finish her last words..."

"...And our child..."

"I had everything. A devoted wife, a warm home, a baby on the way. Evelyn, every time I see someone else's child now, it feels like a knife twisting in my heart..."

"How did it come to this? I... I regret it so much..."

"Evelyn," his voice cracked, pleading, "If now—"

"There are no 'ifs.'" Evelyn cut him off coldly.

"..."

"Your regrets are your own. We're divorced. We're strangers now. I let your drunken outburst slide last time. But I owe you nothing. I won't sacrifice my life to atone for your mistakes. Understand?"

"...I do, but—"

"No 'buts.'" Her tone was glacial. "Before the divorce, I gave you countless chances. You chose her. Remember?"

"..."

"Now that you regret it, I'm supposed to gratefully take you back? Alexander, what do you take me for? First, I was Annabelle's stand-in. Now, I'm your backup plan?"

"..."

"We lived together for three years. Before, I didn't know about you and Annabelle. But now that I do, do you really think I'm the kind of woman who can't live without you?!"

The line went silent for a long moment. Alexander seemed to finally grasp his own audacity, exhaling heavily. "Of course not."

"I didn't want to be this harsh. Can't we just part amicably? Alexander, if you'd stayed with Annabelle till the end, I might've respected you more. What's the point of regret now?"

"..."

"I had it all planned out. Your mother is hospitalized at my workplace. She's always been kind to me, so I'd ask my colleagues to look after her. If we crossed paths, we could exchange polite greetings. We didn't have to burn bridges! Why did you have to tear down that last shred of civility? Do you really want us to become sworn enemies?"

"...I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize. I'm sick of hearing it." Her voice was icy. "If it were me, I'd never have made this call, let alone spouted this nonsense about regret! I avoided you. I turned off my phone. Wasn't that clear enough? I didn't want to hear any of this. You made your choice—now live with it. Can't we at least preserve some dignity? Do I have to spell out every cruel word until we can't even face each other again?"
###Chapter 151: Annabelle's Infertility

Vivian Dempsey had never seen Evelyn Carter lose control like this. She stood frozen, barely daring to breathe.

"Alexander Hamilton," Evelyn's voice was glacial. "We're over. Don't contact me again. Whatever happens between you and Annabelle is none of my business."

Silence stretched for several seconds on the line.

"Annabelle..." Alexander's voice cracked with strain. "She can never conceive again."

Vivian gasped. "What?"

"The doctors said the miscarriage damaged her uterus..."

Evelyn's fingers tightened unconsciously around the armrest.

Alexander gave a bitter laugh. "You were right. I brought this on myself. Take care, Evelyn."

The moment the call ended, Evelyn collapsed into the sofa as if all strength had left her.

So Annabelle's condition was this severe.

"My God," Vivian murmured. "The Hamiltons will—"

"Not my concern." Evelyn cut her off with terrifying calm.

The next morning during rounds, Evelyn made a point of visiting Natalie Stapleton.

The girl had wasted away to skin and bones. Her once-round cheeks were sunken, dark circles bruising her eyes.

"Dr. Carter." Natalie forced a weak smile.

Evelyn gently took her skeletal hand. "How are you feeling?"

"Fine." Natalie's fingers drifted to her swollen abdomen. "But my mother-in-law keeps saying—"

"She came again?"

"Went back to her hometown." Natalie's smile turned bitter. "Said my belly looks wrong. Kept insisting on a gender test..."

Evelyn frowned. "Where's Simon?"

"He..." Natalie's gaze darted away. "Said he's busy with work."

Evelyn's lips curled coldly.

She knew Simon Stapleton too well. The moment Annabelle's scandal broke, he'd vanished faster than anyone.

"Natalie." Evelyn met her eyes directly. "Is this really the marriage you want to keep?"

Tears welled suddenly in Natalie's eyes. "But what about the baby..."
###Chapter 152: Life-or-Death Ultimatum

Evelyn's fingers turned white as she clenched the medical chart.

Countless times she wanted to tell Natalie to terminate the pregnancy, end the marriage, and start anew.

But seeing Natalie's tender gaze as she caressed her swollen belly silenced Evelyn's professional advice.

What gave her further pause—

Natalie had gotten pregnant right after college, never experiencing a single day in the workforce.

At least Evelyn had a respectable career to fall back on if her marriage collapsed.

"I envy your decisiveness, Evelyn." Natalie bit her lip. "But with this baby, I can't make clean breaks like you."

Evelyn silently flipped through the test results.

Should she advise?

Could she?

"Focus on your health first," she finally said. "For the baby's sake."

Tears welled in Natalie's eyes. "I will."

Outside the ward, pregnant patients eyed Evelyn with fear.

Olivia whispered, "After yesterday's scene, everyone's terrified of you."

Evelyn smirked. "When someone tries to destroy my career, not fighting back would be strange."

A shrill scream erupted around the corridor corner.

"Let me die! I can't face life anymore!"

Evelyn froze.

Annabelle's voice.

A wheelchair crashed to the floor. Mrs. Taylor's desperate plea followed: "Alexander, I'm begging you... If anything happens to Annabelle, I'll die too!"

Mr. Taylor's hunched figure rasped, "Take everything from our family, just save our daughter—"

Violent thrashing came from the room. Nurses clamored:

"Miss Taylor, don't! Mr. Hamilton is right outside!"

"He'll never want me now!" Annabelle shrieked hysterically. "Let me die!"

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Is this blackmail for Alexander or her parents?"

Evelyn turned on her heel.

"Dr. Carter!" Olivia jogged after her. "Not staying to watch?"

"Not interested."

Behind them, Mrs. Taylor's wail pierced the air: "Alexander, Annabelle is my whole life—"
###Chapter 153: The Journey Home

Vivian Dempsey’s message popped up just as the high-speed train entered a tunnel.

"Do you regret exposing her in public?"

Evelyn Carter watched the flickering scenery outside the window, her fingers hovering over the screen for a moment.

Did she regret it?

The image of Mr. and Mrs. Anderson—bent and pleading before Alexander Hamilton—often surfaced in the quiet of night.

The Andersons were a respectable family. Mr. Anderson had built his fortune from nothing, and Mrs. Anderson was a piano teacher at the conservatory. Yet those dignified people had knelt in the hallway, weeping as they begged for their daughter.

Vivian’s voice message followed swiftly: "She didn’t even care about her parents. Why should you? She faked a suicide attempt just to force them to grovel before Alexander."

Evelyn sighed softly.

"I loved him once."

Vivian scoffed. "People who really want to die do it quietly. Back then, I—"

The message cut off abruptly.

They both remembered what happened senior year.

Back then, Vivian hadn’t been the unshakable woman she was now. Simon Stapleton had stolen her scholarship recommendation, costing Evelyn her chance too. In despair, Vivian had gone to the beach alone.

Evelyn had searched for her all night.

At dawn, she found Vivian on the rocks, writing a suicide note. The sea wind scattered the pages as Vivian sobbed uncontrollably.

"Evelyn," Vivian’s voice softened suddenly, "if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t be here."

Evelyn chuckled. "Someone promised to take care of me for life back then."

"And I am! Isn’t that what I’m doing now?" Vivian’s tone shifted. "Annabelle was just putting on a show, using her parents to manipulate Alexander."

Evelyn watched the fields rushing past the window and didn’t respond.

"How’s your sister, by the way?"

At the mention of Emily Anderson, Evelyn’s brow furrowed.

With only two months left before college entrance exams, Emily’s grades had plummeted. Their parents blamed a teenage romance and begged Evelyn to come home.

Vivian tsked. "Doesn’t this sound familiar?"

It did. History was repeating itself.

"Met the boy yet? Hope he’s not another Simon."

"I’ll see when I get back." Evelyn rubbed her temples.

"Alright, handle your family first. As for Alexander—"

"I don’t need updates." Evelyn cut her off. "It’s time we both moved on."

The train announcement echoed through the cabin, calling out the name of her hometown.
###Chapter 154: A Mismatched Union Doomed to Fail

Evelyn pushed open the front door to find her mother knitting in the living room.

"Divorced?"

Her mother didn't look up, the needles still clicking rhythmically between her fingers.

Evelyn froze mid-step.

Her parents rarely went online, let alone followed high-society gossip. Someone must have tipped them off.

"Where's Emily?" She changed the subject. "I'll check on her studies."

Her father emerged from the kitchen, spatula in hand. "Not so fast. We need to talk."

"Her exams are coming up."

"Your sister's at tutoring," her mother finally set down the needles. "We arranged it specially."

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

This was an ambush.

"Yes. We're divorced."

Her mother frowned. "Why? Was it your demanding schedule? Or—"

"What else could it be?" Her father slammed the spatula on the table. "The Hamiltons are aristocracy. We're ordinary folks. I never approved this marriage. Evelyn, we never wanted you marrying into wealth. These mismatched unions always fail."

Her grip tightened on her bag strap.

Her father was half-right.

The gulf between her and Alexander was vast, but their problem wasn't incompatibility—it was the absence of love from the start.

Seeing her silence, her mother sighed and took her hand. "Maybe it's for the best. I always worried you'd suffer in that household."

"I'm fine."

"How long can you stay?"

"Two weeks." Evelyn forced a smile. "The director approved leave to see Emily through her exams."

Her mother's eyes glistened. "Then rest well."

"Mm."

"I'll make sweet-and-sour ribs tonight." Her mother headed to the kitchen. "Talk with your father."

Alone with her father, the air grew heavy.

He pulled out a cigarette pack, then shoved it back angrily.

"Dad, have you been sleeping enough?"

Andrew studied his daughter. "Neither of my girls gives me peace."

"Divorce isn't catastrophic." Evelyn kept her tone light. "I have stable work and plan to buy an apartment in Hudson. Once Emily starts university, we can reunite often."

"Buying property?" His brow furrowed. "Hudson's prices—"

"I'll manage."

"When exactly did you divorce?"

"...Two or three months ago."

"Where have you been living?"

"First with Vivian, then I rented my own place."

Her father scoffed. "The Hamiltons sure acted fast—kicking you out immediately."

Evelyn busied herself adjusting her bag strap.

"Need money?" he asked abruptly.

"I'm set."

"If you're short—" He produced a bank card. "PIN's your birthday."

Her nose stung as she pushed it back. "Really, I have savings."

"Take it!" He forced it into her palm. "Consider it your dowry."

The word shattered her composure.

What was meant as wedding preparations now became divorce support.

The chopping sounds from the kitchen and the range hood's roar filled the silence.

Her father squeezed her shoulder. "Just come home."
###Chapter 155: Quite the Gossip

Evelyn explained softly, "Dad, the Hamiltons didn't kick me out. I moved out on my own."

"Of course you had to leave! That homewrecker showed up pregnant at your doorstep. Were you supposed to wait on her during her confinement?"

She fell silent.

Her father slammed the table in anger. "You're too soft-hearted! Our family may not be as wealthy as the Hamiltons, but we won't be disrespected!"

"Dad, I fought back."

"That barely counts as fighting back," he scoffed. "The Hamiltons deserve to be the laughingstock of society!"

Evelyn suddenly chuckled.

"You can still laugh at a time like this?"

"I cursed Alexander Hamilton."

"What did you say?"

"I called him blind and stupid. I told him he brought this on himself and deserves to raise another man's child."

Andrew Anderson finally nodded in approval. "Now that's more like it. Don't be afraid, Evelyn. Your father's got your back."

Her eyes welled up as she nodded firmly.

His rough hand patted her head. "Divorce is just divorce. We'll live our own lives. Don't rush into buying a house. Your mother and I will discuss it."

"Discuss what?"

"We're thinking of selling this place and using our savings to help with your down payment—"

"No!" She shot to her feet. "Where will you live if you sell the house?"

He pulled her back down. "The city's too far. We worry about you being alone. Your mother and I plan to find jobs with room and board in H City to be closer to you."

Her nose stung. "Then let's buy a bigger place and live together."

"Silly girl." He shook his head. "This is your pre-marital asset. With property and a career, no one will ever look down on you again."

Evelyn understood.

Her father feared she'd feel inferior because of their modest background.

"What about Emily?"

"We can still work! Your mother heard maternity nurses earn well. I'll deliver food. We'll save enough for Emily too."

Tears spilled over.

"Dad, I've failed you—"

"Nonsense!" He wiped her cheeks with his sleeve. "Everyone in town envies us for having such an accomplished daughter!"

"But making you work so hard at your age—"

"That's what parents do." His smile deepened the wrinkles around his eyes. "Our hardships don't matter as long as our children thrive."

She wiped her tears. "Let's hold off on the house."

"Alright. We'll revisit it after Emily's college entrance exams."

"Okay."

"Feeling better?"

She forced a smile. "Coming home was the right choice."

Her father hesitated. "Does that Alexander Hamilton... know the baby isn't his? What's happening with them now—"

Evelyn burst out laughing. "Dad, I never took you for a gossip."
###Chapter 156 It's her physics tutor!
Andrew Anderson grinned, revealing a row of perfectly aligned teeth.

Evelyn Carter told her father everything she witnessed at the hospital—how Annabelle Taylor's parents had humbly begged Alexander Hamilton not to abandon their daughter.

When her father heard Alexander was cutting ties with Annabelle, a flicker of satisfaction crossed his face. But after learning about the Taylors' situation, he sighed deeply and patted Evelyn's shoulder. "That boy will never be free of that girl," he muttered.

Evelyn had expected as much.

Annabelle could no longer conceive, and her parents were frail and sickly. They wanted to secure their only daughter's future while they still could.

Alexander, whom they'd watched grow up, was dependable. If he agreed, Annabelle would be taken care of for life.

But for him, it would be a lifelong shackle.

Yet for their daughter's sake, the Taylors had no choice but to swallow their pride and use their failing health as leverage, forcing Alexander to accept this bitter fate.

"Is her mother seriously ill?" her father asked.

Evelyn shook her head. "I don't know the details, but she needs a wheelchair. She looks very weak."

Her father stubbed out his cigarette. "Raising a daughter like that... what a burden."

Evelyn changed the subject. "Dad, you mentioned Emily was dating someone on the phone? A classmate?"

"If only it were a classmate," he said through gritted teeth. "It's her physics tutor!"

"What?!"

"The man has a child in elementary school!"

Evelyn frowned. "Does he know about this?"

"Of course he does," her father scoffed. "He even talked to us, saying he'd 'keep Emily stable' until her exams. Smooth talker. Still texts her constantly and gives her private tutoring."

Something felt off. "Has her grades dropped?"

"Exactly. She's obsessed with physics now, neglecting everything else."

Evelyn stood abruptly. "I'm going to that tutoring center."

"Your mother and I were hoping you would. That girl won't listen to anyone but you these days."

After getting the address, Evelyn headed straight there.

The midday sun was harsh. She stood outside the building, watching as Emily emerged alongside a man in a tailored suit.

He looked about thirty, with gentle eyes behind black-framed glasses, carrying a lesson plan and a protractor.

Younger than she'd imagined, with thick hair and a decent face.

But no amount of polish could hide the fact that he was preying on a minor.

"Emily," Evelyn called.

Her sister turned, her ponytail bouncing with delight. "Evelyn! What are you doing here?"

"Could you grab me a bottle of water?"

"Be right back!" Emily skipped off toward the convenience store.

Evelyn turned to the tutor, who was about to leave. "Hello. I'm Emily's sister."

The man paused, offering a polite smile. "Hello."

"Can we talk?"
###Chapter 157: Reunion with an Old Acquaintance

The physics teacher froze momentarily, his eyebrows lifting slightly. "Me?"

"Mhm."

"...Alright. What would you like to talk about?"

Evelyn Carter glanced toward the school store. The bell had just rung, and students were swarming inside. Her sister Emily Anderson was lost in the crowd, unlikely to emerge anytime soon.

"Let’s be direct." Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "A married man should know better than to overstep boundaries with younger girls, especially when it could jeopardize their future. Don’t you agree, teacher?"

The man blinked, then chuckled.

"You’re Emily’s family?"

"Her older sister." She emphasized the word.

He gave a slight nod. "Peter Harrison."

"Nice to meet you, Mr. Harrison."

Amusement flickered in Peter’s eyes. "Call me whatever you like."

Emily came bounding back, waving an ice-cold drink.

"Here, sis!"

Evelyn took it, and Emily immediately held out her palm. "Three bucks. Reimburse me."

"You’re about to take college entrance exams, yet you still act like a kid."

Emily looped an arm around hers, grinning. "I have so many secrets to tell you!"

"Later." Evelyn nudged her. "Say goodbye to your teacher."

Emily’s eyes widened as she looked between them. "Wait… you don’t recognize Peter?"

The casual "Peter" made Evelyn’s temper flare.

"Manners. It’s Mr. Harrison."

"But he’s not my teacher!"

Evelyn stiffened.

Not a tutor?

Peter laughed softly. "Evelyn, you really don’t remember me?"

Memories scattered like dandelion seeds in the wind—just out of reach.

Peter Harrison.

The name was both foreign and familiar.

Seeing her blank expression, Emily stomped her foot. "Auntie Lucy’s son! The one who suggested you apply to med school after your college exams!"

The floodgates burst open.

That summer, cicadas screeched.

Locked in her room, crying over her failed exams, a lanky teenager had pushed open her door and handed her a medical school brochure.

"Full scholarship. Guaranteed job placement after graduation. You could even apply to Harvard Medical later."

Back then, her mind had been consumed by Vivian Dempsey’s crisis. She hadn’t even properly thanked him.

"Auntie Lucy sent Peter to help me with my applications!"

Heat crept up Evelyn’s neck.

She’d made a complete fool of herself.
###Chapter 158: First Love

"I'm really sorry, Peter."

Peter Harrison adjusted his black-framed glasses and smiled gently. "Don't worry about it. It's been years since we last saw each other."

Evelyn Carter twisted her fingers nervously. "Where are you working now?"

"At the Hudson City Architectural Design Institute."

"That's a stable job."

He shook his head with a wry smile. "In construction, it doesn't matter where you work. We still have to run around job sites, rain or shine."

So he was in architecture.

No wonder he was holding a measuring device. Upon closer look, he had a few other professional tools too. Earlier, she'd been too worried about her sister to notice.

As they made small talk, Evelyn's gaze kept drifting into the distance. What was the deal with that so-called physics teacher?

"Want to grab a seat somewhere?" Peter suddenly suggested.

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. Did he know something?

"Sis..."

Her sleeve was tugged lightly.

She turned to see Emily Anderson blushing furiously, her head bowed like a startled rabbit.

"What's wrong?"

"I want to introduce you to someone..."

Emily pointed toward a boy in the same school uniform, his backpack slung over one shoulder. He was pushing a bicycle with one hand while effortlessly spinning a basketball with the other. Laughing with his friends under the sunlight, he radiated youthful energy.

"Sis, what do you think?"

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "He seems lively."

"He's the captain of the school basketball team."

Suddenly understanding, Evelyn crossed her arms and studied her sister. "So, not a physics teacher?"

Emily's face turned even redder. "It's a long story... Sis, I'll be right back. You chat with Peter for a bit!"

Before Evelyn could respond, the girl had already skipped away.

The boy was clearly waiting for her. As Emily approached, he casually handed her a snack bag from his bike handle and slung her backpack over his own shoulder.

"Young love is beautiful, isn't it?"

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts to find Peter watching the young couple too. She smiled. "Yeah."

This was much better than she'd imagined.

At least it wasn't a married physics teacher.

"Let's give them some space. They won't relax with you standing here."

He was right.

Emily was gesturing toward them while speaking to the boy. Suddenly, the boy straightened up—

And bowed deeply in Evelyn's direction.

She nearly laughed out loud.

Emily waved at her. "Sis!"

Evelyn mimed a phone call, and her sister immediately understood.

"Your secret sister code?"

"Yeah," Evelyn explained. "Telling her to call me later."

Peter gestured toward a café on the corner. "Shall we?"

Over coffee, Evelyn finally pieced together the whole story.

Her dear little sister Emily had fallen for an average student.

While Emily wasn't as academically gifted as her sister, she could still get into a top-tier university. The boy, however, would only qualify for a second-tier school.

Their parents wanted their younger daughter to follow in Evelyn's footsteps by studying medicine or engineering at Hudson University. But with no decent second-tier options in Hudson City, the boy's family planned to send him to a school in Beijing—over a thousand miles away.

"Your parents are against her dating," Peter said. "Every time she tries to bring it up, they shut her down with 'Why can't you be more like your sister?' Once, during an argument, she blurted out that she liked her physics teacher just to provoke them."

Evelyn massaged her temples. Now she was getting blamed for her sister's crush?

"Did you come back with your husband this time?"

"I'm alone."

"Then..." Peter suddenly looked out the window.

"What is it?"

"That car... I think it's been following you."
###Chapter 159: Watching Eyes

A white Cayenne stood out conspicuously on the small town's street.

Evelyn Carter glanced at it briefly before looking away.

"Should we call the police?" Peter Harrison whispered.

She shook her head. "They might just be passing by."

Peter exhaled in relief. "I was worried it might be that patient who harassed you last time."

"Unlikely," she said with a light laugh. "I get along well with my patients."

The conversation shifted to Emily Anderson. Peter stirred his coffee. "She wants to go to the capital with her boyfriend for college."

Evelyn considered this for a moment. "I'll talk to her soon."

"The boy seems decent," Peter added. "A sports scholarship student. Could become a teacher later."

"You approve?"

"Not exactly approval," he admitted with a wry smile. "I just admire his courage. If I had been that brave back then..."

His coffee cup was empty, leaving only bitterness on his tongue.

Ding—

The café door chimed.

"Welcome!" the waitress greeted cheerfully.

"One mocha, whole milk, half sugar."

Evelyn stood abruptly. "Time to go."

"Did you get a call?"

"No, but it's dinnertime." She grabbed her purse. "Even romance shouldn't interfere with meals."

She walked past the counter without a second glance.

Peter hurried to open the door for her.

"Thanks." She nodded.

The white Cayenne remained parked by the curb, drawing curious looks from passersby.

No one was inside.

"Taxis are scarce right now," Peter checked his phone. "Let me drive you."

The ride-hailing app showed over thirty people in queue.

A sudden bright smile crossed Evelyn's face. "Then I'll trouble you."

The warmth of her smile left Peter flustered.

"I—I'll get the car!" His ears reddened as he rushed toward the alley.

Her phone buzzed—Emily calling.

"Where are you guys?"

"Your boyfriend left already?"

"...Peter told you?" Emily's voice wavered.

"Bring him to meet me after your exams."

"Evelyn!" Emily nearly sobbed. "Don't be like Mom and Dad—"

"Just a talk," Evelyn cut in. "I need to see if he's reliable."

Instant excitement bubbled through the phone. "He treats me so well! Unlike how Alexander treated you—"

The words cut off abruptly.

Evelyn was about to press when a chill ran down her spine.

Someone was watching her.
###Chapter 160: Alexander, Enough Is Enough

The phone line fell into an eerie silence.

Emily Anderson's voice trembled with tears. "Evelyn, I—"

"Meet me at the café across from your tutoring center," Evelyn Carter cut her off. "Peter is getting the car."

"Okay, I'll be right there."

When Emily arrived, her school uniform collar was still unbuttoned.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on her sister's exposed neck.

"Zip it up."

Emily fumbled with her clothes, her ears turning red. "Evelyn!"

"Minors need to learn self-protection."

Peter Harrison's car pulled up by the curb.

In the rearview mirror, a white Cayenne maintained a steady distance behind them.

"That car behind us..." Peter frowned.

Emily whirled around. "Isn't that Alex—"

"Stay seated." Evelyn fastened her seatbelt. "We'll talk at home."

Footsteps echoed through the stairwell of the old apartment building.

Emily hesitated by the second-floor window, biting her lip.

Evelyn marched upstairs. As her key turned in the lock, their father's furious roar erupted. "You dare come home now?!"

"Fine, I'll leave!" Emily slammed the door behind her.

Their mother wrung her hands. "Andrew, have you lost your mind? She's taking college entrance exams soon!"

"Look at how she behaves!" Their father jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "Why can't she be more like her sister?"

Evelyn stood by the window.

The Cayenne's headlights glowed below.

"I'll find her."

Dead leaves scraped against her ankles in the night wind.

A car door thudded shut behind her.

"Evelyn."

She quickened her pace, but a burning hand closed around her wrist.

"Let go!"

Alexander Hamilton's palm radiated heat. "You're going the wrong way."

"Not your concern."

"Your sister ran east."

Evelyn wrenched free. "Alexander, don't you have anything better to do? Is Hamilton Group collapsing? Doesn't Annabelle need you?"

The streetlamp stretched his shadow long across the pavement.

"I just—"

"Stay away from my family." She turned on her heel.

His voice followed her. "The road ahead is under construction."

Evelyn halted.

Moonlight revealed dark circles beneath Alexander's eyes.

"There's a side gate at the construction site," he said softly. "I'll show you."
###Chapter 161: The Language of Love

Evelyn's gaze lingered on his face for a moment. "Thank you," she murmured softly before turning to hurry after her sister.

Emily hadn't gone far. She sat in the pavilion near the neighborhood entrance, wiping her tears.

When she saw Evelyn approaching, the younger girl's eyes reddened again. "Sis..."

"Do you really love him that much?" Evelyn cut straight to the point.

Emily bit her lip and nodded. "Yes."

"His grades are average, his family background is ordinary, and his future prospects are limited. Your grades have slipped too—Mom and Dad won't approve."

"Sis, does love need to meet so many conditions?" Emily suddenly looked up. "He might not be as wealthy or powerful as Alexander, but he truly loves me! You married the perfect husband, but are you happy?"

The words struck like a needle, stealing Evelyn's breath.

The night breeze carried a slight chill.

Evelyn studied the little sister who had always trailed behind her and realized—Emily had grown up.

People often said the two sisters were nothing alike.

Evelyn was quiet and reserved; Emily was lively and impulsive. Evelyn was exceptionally intelligent; Emily was innocent and carefree.

She had always assumed the role of the wiser older sister. Yet now, she found herself speechless before Emily's question.

Yes, she didn’t understand love.

Marriage could be weighed by pros and cons, but love defied all logic.

Just like Alexander's devotion to Annabelle—fully aware of her spoiled and willful nature, yet cherishing her all the same.

"Sis?"

"Is it really him or no one else?"

"We made a promise," Emily said, her eyes shining. "No matter how hard life gets, we’ll face it together."

Evelyn gave a soft "Mm."

"I’ve made up my mind—it’s him!"

"I support you."

Emily shot to her feet. "Sis?!"

Evelyn stepped onto the pavilion and took her sister’s hand. "Leave Mom and Dad to me. Focus on your exams."

"Sis, I..." Emily’s voice cracked. "I thought you were here to scold me."

"You’re right," Evelyn said, gazing into the distance. "Love doesn’t follow reason."

Emily hesitated. "But what if he really amounts to nothing...?"

"Then make yourself strong enough." Evelyn gave her sister’s palm a reassuring squeeze.

On the way home, Evelyn advised Emily not to confront their parents head-on. Emily nodded obediently, docile as a little rabbit.

As they passed their building, the white Cayenne was no longer there.

"Sis," Emily suddenly tugged her sleeve, "I saw Alexander earlier."

"Did you speak?"

Emily fidgeted. "I was running too fast... I just heard him calling after me."
###Chapter 162: The Obsession of Reunion

Evelyn Carter's footsteps remained unhurried.

Emily Anderson jogged to catch up. "Aren't you curious what Alexander said?"

"Don’t call him that anymore."

"Then what should I call him?"

"Mr. Hamilton."

Emily pouted. "Fine."

Evelyn gazed at the distant trees and added softly, "But we probably won’t see him again. The title doesn’t matter."

Thanks to her mediation, the tension at home gradually eased.

On the day the college entrance exam results were announced, cheers erupted in the Anderson living room.

Andrew Anderson stared at the computer screen, his fingers trembling slightly. "630 points! I always knew our daughters were exceptional!"

Grace Anderson beamed with pride. "That’s my good genes at work!"

"You’re right," Andrew conceded uncharacteristically. "And Peter deserves credit too. He tutored and drove Emily around all semester."

Grace nodded eagerly. "We should thank him properly."

The opportunity came soon enough.

Auntie Lucy’s fiftieth birthday party included an invitation for the entire Anderson family.

Lately, good news had been plentiful. Evelyn watched her sister giggle over her phone, her mother fuss over gifts, and her father proudly boast about his daughters to anyone who would listen. Even her own mood felt lighter.

Vivian Dempsey noticed it over the phone. "You’ve been different since returning home."

"Maybe leaving Hudson City—that place of heartbreak—really helped."

"By the way, the housing development you liked is opening next week. It’s in insanely high demand."

Scholar’s Residence wasn’t downtown, but its location was ideal—close to both Hudson University and Central Hospital, surrounded by top-tier schools. The perfect place for a family.

Most importantly, it stood on the opposite side of the hospital from her former marital home, minimizing any chance of unwanted encounters.

"What are you afraid of?" Vivian scoffed. "You think that homewrecker would dare cause trouble?"

"I just don’t want unnecessary stress."

"It’s not them you’re avoiding, is it?"

Silence stretched over the line.

Vivian sighed in sudden understanding. "If you truly want a child, start fresh."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone.

She’d never been particularly eager for marriage or motherhood.

Yet Grandma Hamilton’s dying words echoed relentlessly: The child said they’d return to the heavens to choose a mother again.

If she never remarried or had children, would that mean she’d never see them?

She wanted to meet them again.

Even if the odds were one in a million.

"Hold on," Vivian said abruptly. "I need to check something."

Ten minutes later, her phone buzzed.

A notification.

Evelyn opened it to find a screenshot.
###Chapter 163: The Practical Man

The phone screen lit up, displaying a Q&A page from "Quora."

The question read: How long after death until reincarnation?

A user named "Master Jinyun" answered: The soul leaves the body and returns to the underworld. Rebirth occurs approximately 700 days later.

Evelyn stared at the screen. "Is this site... reliable?"

Vivian shrugged. "It's a publicly traded company, at least."

"Who is this 'Master Jinyun'?"

"No idea. But at least he gave a specific number. Most people wouldn’t know these things."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. True enough—plenty of people online made up random numbers just for likes.

Vivian cut straight to the point. "So, do you believe it or not?"

As someone raised on materialism and working as an OB-GYN, Evelyn should’ve scoffed.

But right now...

Seeing her silence, Vivian understood immediately. "Evelyn, we need to learn from past mistakes. Handsome, wealthy men aren’t the answer. You need a practical man."

......

Auntie Lucy’s husband—Peter Harrison’s father—had passed away in an accident over a decade ago.

The two families had always been close. When Peter was in high school, Evelyn was just starting ninth grade. Her mother, Grace, often invited him and his mother over for dinner under the guise of tutoring.

Really, it was just so the widowed mother and son wouldn’t feel so alone.

But Evelyn was an excellent student. When Peter came over, he mostly just sat with her while she did homework, occasionally answering a question or two.

This time, for Auntie Lucy’s 50th birthday, the celebration was lavish—held at an upscale Cantonese restaurant downtown.

Early that morning, as the Anderson family stepped out of their building, they spotted Peter’s car parked by the curb.

"Mr. Anderson, Mrs. Anderson, my mother asked me to pick you up."

Grace beamed. "You sweet boy. Shouldn’t you be with your mother today? Why are you playing chauffeur?"

Peter bustled about, carrying gifts and opening car doors, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Suddenly, Emily tugged at Evelyn’s sleeve.

"Sis..." The younger girl blinked up at her.

Evelyn knew exactly what this was about. "Meeting up with that little boyfriend of yours again?"

"His name is Kyle!" Emily pouted. "Sis, with Auntie Lucy’s birthday today, Mom and Dad won’t let me slip away..."

"I can’t help you with that."

"It’s easy! If anyone asks, just say I went to the restroom and change the subject. It’s not like I’m the main attraction today..."

Evelyn sighed at her sister.

No wonder she’d been primping since dawn—all for a date.

"How long will you be gone?"

"He invited me to a movie... so about three hours?"

"Who takes a three-hour bathroom break?"

"Sis~ You’re the smart one. Help me figure something out, please?"
###Chapter 164: The Hint of a Son-in-Law

Evelyn Carter finally gave in to her younger sister's relentless pleading, reluctantly agreeing to "play it by ear."

Emily Anderson's eyes instantly curved into crescents at her sister's concession. She chattered nonstop during the car ride, making their father Andrew Anderson laugh heartily while their mother Grace Anderson playfully tapped her forehead. "You little chatterbox," Grace scolded affectionately.

Evelyn sat quietly in the front passenger seat, her gaze fixed on the scenery rushing past the window as Emily's cheerful laughter filled the car.

"Is the air conditioning temperature alright?" Peter Harrison suddenly asked.

She turned slightly. "Hmm?"

"I can adjust it if you're cold."

"It's fine as is."

"Let me know if you feel uncomfortable."

"Okay."

"This car..." Peter's grip on the steering wheel tightened. "It's just a regular domestic model. Not as comfortable as those imported luxury vehicles."

Understanding his concern, Evelyn offered a small smile. "I don't know much about cars. As long as it has four wheels and runs, it's good enough for me."

Peter's tense shoulders visibly relaxed. "True."

"Besides, domestic cars have improved significantly lately, especially new energy vehicles. I hear they're quite popular overseas."

"Exactly!" Peter's eyes lit up at the mention of his professional expertise, launching into an enthusiastic explanation about technological breakthroughs and market prospects for domestic automobiles.

Though Evelyn knew little about cars, she found his passionate lecture surprisingly interesting.

Midway through his explanation, Peter suddenly remarked, "I've noticed a white Cayenne parked near your building recently. I hope our domestic brands can produce high-end models like that someday."

"They will."

"Have you ever driven a luxury car before?"

Evelyn recalled the time she drove Alexander Hamilton's car to take Natalie Stapleton to the hospital.

"Once."

"Your ex-husband's?"

"Yes."

"What model?"

"...Cayenne."

Peter chuckled. "What a coincidence?"

"Perhaps that model appeals to domestic consumers."

Being technically-minded, Peter took the remark at face value and cheerfully resumed his automotive education.

Though Evelyn's family lived within Hudson City limits, their home was some distance from downtown. Normally, they'd take either a coach or high-speed rail to visit.

After nearly two hours of driving, Peter finally pulled up at the reserved Cantonese restaurant.

Auntie Lucy stood waiting in a deep red cheongsam, her hair immaculately coiffed, beaming as she greeted them. "You're finally here!"

Grace grasped her hands warmly. "We wouldn't have made it so soon without Peter picking us up."

Auntie Lucy waved dismissively. "What are sons for if not to be useful!"

"You're too modest. Having such an accomplished, filial son—I envy you."

"Filial? He's practically ancient and still single. I'm the one envying your two lovely daughters. Shall we trade?"

Grace's eyes crinkled with amusement. "No need for trades. Peter's already like a son to me, and you can consider my girls your daughters."

Auntie Lucy's face brightened. "I'll hold you to that! Take this useless boy as your son already so I can stop worrying about his marital prospects."

The implication was unmistakable.

Emily, engrossed in texting her boyfriend Kyle Carter, remained oblivious to the adults' conversation.

Grace paused, exchanging a meaningful glance with Evelyn.

Only a son-in-law could be called "half a son."

Auntie Lucy was clearly hinting at...
###Chapter 165: Sister-in-law

Grace Anderson froze. "Peter is older than Evelyn. That's nearly a ten-year gap between him and Emily..."

Auntie Lucy gave a knowing smile. "Maybe he's been waiting for Emily to grow up all along. Come in and sit down. Peter, don't just stand there—help Grace and the girls to their seats."

Peter Harrison, who had been walking behind Andrew Anderson, quickly stepped forward and pulled out a chair. "Grace, please sit here."

Grace's expression was complicated. "Ah... alright."

"Evelyn, this seat." Peter gestured to the chair beside her.

The moment Evelyn sat down, she heard her mother whisper, "Sweetheart, what Auntie Lucy just said—"

"It's exactly what you're thinking."

Grace frowned at her younger daughter. Emily was giggling at her phone, oblivious until her name was called three times before she finally shuffled over. "This silly girl is so carefree all the time. How could Peter possibly..."

Out of the corner of her eye, Evelyn noticed Peter glancing their way. The moment their eyes met, he hastily looked down at the menu, though the tips of his ears turned faintly pink.

In that instant, everything clicked for Evelyn.

Peter had grown up eating meals at the Anderson household—he and Emily were practically childhood sweethearts. Emily had kept her first relationship a secret even from her own sister, yet Peter had known every detail...

"Peter is certainly a good catch," Grace murmured under her breath. "A stable job at a state-owned firm, and we've known him since he was a boy. Definitely better than that divorced physics teacher."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "So you approve?"

"Don't get ahead of yourself! I was too quick to agree when you got married, and look how that turned out..." Grace shot a glare at her giggling younger daughter. "I'm keeping a close eye on this one's love life."

Evelyn silently lit a candle for poor Kyle.

Sorry, kid. My failed marriage just dug you a hole. If you don't step up, you might lose to this childhood friend who's been lying in wait.

"—Sister-in-law?"

A hesitant male voice came from behind. Evelyn turned—then immediately spun back around, her face darkening.

Vincent Wilson circled to face her, struggling for words. "Why are you—I didn’t mean it like that..."

"Vincent!"

"Alex!" Vincent called back, giving Evelyn one last conflicted look. "Never mind. Since you're here... But can we talk privately? Today is Alex and Annabelle's..."
###Chapter 166: The Engagement Turmoil

Vincent Wilson's words were abruptly cut short by urgent calls.

He hastily bowed to Evelyn Carter. "Sis, I need a favor."

Before she could respond, he vanished around the corner.

Evelyn followed his path with her gaze.

Annabelle Taylor stood there in simple attire—a white T-shirt, jeans, and a casually tied ponytail, her face bare of makeup.

That outfit...

"Grace, my eyes must be failing me," Auntie Lucy chuckled to Grace Anderson. "I almost mistook that girl for your Evelyn."

Grace squinted. "There is a resemblance."

"Though not as striking as Evelyn."

"Is this how young women dress nowadays? I thought only doctors like Evelyn wore such plain clothes."

Auntie Lucy lowered her voice. "Perhaps wealthy families prefer this understated look? See that man beside her—clearly from money."

She meant Vincent.

Evelyn recalled his unfinished sentence.

What were Alexander Hamilton and Annabelle planning today?

She didn’t care to know.

Whatever it was, being held at a hotel meant it was some kind of ceremony.

Now detached, Evelyn found herself observing them like a disinterested spectator.

Grace, however, noticed the oddity. "He called you 'sister-in-law'? What’s his relation to Alexander?"

"I’m not sure. I don’t involve myself in his business."

Grace squeezed her daughter’s hand. "Now that you’re divorced, don’t dwell on it. We were never meant for that world."

"Mm."

The hotel doors suddenly swung open.

Alexander strode in, his expression thunderous.

"Alexander..."

Annabelle called out timidly.

He didn’t glance back.

She hurried after him. "Alexander—"

He stopped abruptly, his gaze icy. "Don’t follow me."

Annabelle’s eyes reddened, her usual arrogance gone. "But today is our..."

"Annabelle." Margaret Hamilton’s voice cut in from behind.

Annabelle turned. "Mrs. Hamilton..."

Margaret approached, her face unreadable. "You know exactly how this engagement came about. Your mother threatened suicide, and Alexander agreed out of respect for our families’ history."

Annabelle bit her lip hard.

"Because of that child you claimed was his, Alexander became the laughingstock of the city. And now you insist on this farce, trampling the Hamiltons’ dignity?" Margaret’s laugh was cold. "Since your parents demanded it, I’ll represent our family today."

Annabelle paled. "That’s not—"

"Alexander is only here briefly. He’s leaving soon." Margaret turned away. "Let’s begin. No more delays."
###Chapter 167: Taking a Liking to Your Evelyn

Emily suddenly widened her eyes and pointed in the distance. "Sis, isn't that—"

"Emily!" Grace snapped sharply.

Emily shrank back, casting a pitiful glance at Evelyn before biting her lip in silence.

Grace frowned sternly. "You're not a child anymore. Show some manners when elders are speaking."

Emily nodded obediently and stuck her tongue out at Evelyn when Grace wasn't looking.

Evelyn smiled to diffuse the tension. "Mom, it's fine."

Grace squeezed Evelyn's hand anxiously. "Maybe you should head home early?"

Auntie Lucy looked concerned. "Is Evelyn feeling unwell?"

"She's always gotten carsick since she was little," Grace fibbed. "Evelyn, go get some fresh air outside."

Evelyn wanted to say she no longer cared about those two people.

But Peter stood abruptly. "Mom, I'll take Evelyn for a walk."

Auntie Lucy's smile turned knowing. "Go ahead. Young people should spend more time together."

Emily immediately jumped up. "I'm coming too!" She frantically signaled Evelyn with her eyes.

Evelyn caught on. "Peter, it's Auntie Lucy's birthday. You should stay. Emily can keep me company."

Emily nodded eagerly.

Grace agreed. "Emily, take care of your sister."

"Got it!" Emily practically dragged Evelyn outside.

Watching her daughters leave, Grace sighed. "One's too mature, the other too lively."

Auntie Lucy gazed at them wistfully. "They're wonderful. Grace, you know I see them as my own daughters."

The implication was obvious.

Grace smiled politely. "Emily's still young. We want to keep her close for now—"

"Oh please," Auntie Lucy interrupted. "Emily's nowhere near marriageable age. Peter's already thirty—I can't wait forever."

Grace froze. "You mean...?"

Auntie Lucy set down her teacup bluntly. "I've taken a liking to Evelyn."

Andrew and Grace both looked stunned.

"But Evelyn was married before—"

"Divorce is perfectly normal these days," Auntie Lucy waved it off. "I've always admired Evelyn—steady, sensible. I should've brought this up sooner—"

"Mom!" Peter's face burned crimson. "We agreed not to mention this yet!"
###Chapter 168: His Thoughts

"If I don't speak up, how long were you planning to stay silent? Didn't you learn your lesson last time? It's because of your indecisiveness that Evelyn married that wealthy heir—a complete mismatch. Now she's unhappy."

"Mom..."

"Enough. Go explain yourself to Mr. and Mrs. Anderson."

Peter Harrison's ears burned red. He hadn't expected his mother to confront him so abruptly. Thank goodness Evelyn wasn't here—he would've wanted to vanish on the spot.

Grace Anderson noticed his discomfort and intervened. "Peter, could you check on the food in the kitchen? It's taking a while."

Peter seized the opportunity. "I'll go right away."

The private dining room was left with just the three elders.

Auntie Lucy sipped her tea leisurely. "This Lu'an melon-seed tea is quite good."

Andrew and Grace Anderson offered polite nods, though their hearts felt heavy.

Emily Anderson tried to bolt the moment they stepped out of the restaurant.

Evelyn grabbed her arm. "Do you have enough money? Don't always let Kyle pay for everything."

Emily shook her head vigorously. "Sis..."

"I know."

"Thanks, sis!"

Watching her sister's taxi disappear, Evelyn transferred some money with a smile. But as she turned, she nearly collided with a familiar face.

"Peter?"

His smile was strained. "The elders were talking. I thought it'd be better if I stepped out."

"Feeling better now?"

"Yeah."

"Want to take a walk?"

Evelyn understood immediately. "Auntie Lucy brought up marriage again?"

"...Yeah."

"Emily's still too young. I'm afraid Auntie Lucy will be disappointed."

Peter rubbed his hands together. "That boy seems decent. They suit each other."

"But we should consider his family background. I used to think matching social status was outdated, but now I see the wisdom in it."

Peter's eyes brightened. "You think so too?"

"At least their values should align. Unlike me—forcing myself into a different world only made me feel out of place."

Peter scratched his head and chuckled. "You're right."

"Peter."

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for looking after Emily all these years. I won't forget your kindness."

He sighed. "Do you really think I like Emily?"

"...Don't you?"

"She's practically a kid. I'm not that much of a creep."

"But Auntie Lucy—"

Evelyn suddenly froze. Her expression shifted from shock to confusion, then settled into hesitant disbelief.

"Watch out—"

The shattering of glass exploded through the air.
###Chapter 169: Unexpected Encounter

"Are you alright, miss?" The waiter stammered an apology.

Evelyn Carter barely had time to react before Peter Harrison stepped in front of her.

Shards of glass scattered across the floor. Scalding hot soup arced through the air like a dangerous projectile.

His beige polo shirt was splattered with brown stains. The gray sweatpants fared worse—the entire right leg was soaked through, steam rising from the fabric.

"Burns!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn grabbed Peter's arm and pulled him away.

Behind them, the waiter called out, "Do you need a towel—"

"Where's the restroom?"

"Straight ahead, then turn right at the end."

Peter's breathing grew noticeably labored. "Evelyn, slow down..."

She crouched and gently lifted his pant leg.

Even with the lightest touch, she could feel his muscles tense instantly.

"Fabric sticks to burns. We need cold water now."

Beads of sweat formed on Peter's forehead. "I can handle it. A female doctor shouldn't go into the men's room—"

"Stop arguing. Can you walk?"

"Barely."

"Lean on me. Hurry."

At the restroom entrance, Peter hesitated. Evelyn had already rushed to the sink and turned on the faucet.

"Stay still. Let me roll this up."

"I can do it—"

"Don't be stubborn."

The fabric clung to the wound. Every tug made Peter suck in a sharp breath.

"These pants are too tight. We need to tear them."

"Fine."

Without scissors, Evelyn used her teeth to rip an opening, then pulled with both hands.

Rrrrip—

The pant leg split open above the knee.

The burned skin had turned red and blistered. She guided his leg into the sink filled with cold water.

"Hang in there."

Peter clenched his jaw and nodded.

Just then, Vincent Wilson's panicked voice came from outside. "Alex, what are you doing here?"

"Why are you blocking the door?"

"It's—it's under maintenance!"

"Move."

"Seriously, you can't—"

Alexander Hamilton pushed past him and strode inside.
###Chapter 170: Can't You Act Like a Man and Make a Clean Break?

"Alex, don't—" Vincent Wilson's voice cracked.

The air froze the moment the door swung open.

Evelyn Carter knelt on the floor, carefully examining the burn on Peter Harrison's leg.

"Mr. Hamilton?" Peter recognized the intruder.

Alexander Hamilton's gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Peter winced but shifted to shield her. "Sorry, there was an accident. My friend was just helping me."

The protective stance made the scene even more suggestive.

Vincent sucked in a sharp breath and grabbed Alexander's arm. "Let's step outside first—"

"You knew?" Alexander shook him off, his voice a brewing storm.

Vincent paled. "I just got here and heard Evelyn say, 'The pants are too tight—I'll have to tear them,' followed by a man groaning—"

"That's not what happened!" Peter waved his hands frantically.

"Enough." Evelyn turned off the faucet, shaking water from her hair as she stood. "Let's go."

Peter hesitated. "We should explain—"

"Unnecessary." Her tone was calm. "This is a men's restroom. Others need to use it."

Alexander suddenly lunged forward. "Evelyn!"

She paused.

His eyes burned into her damp hair and the lingering moisture on her lips. "You and him... in the men's room?"

Peter blinked. "You two know each other?"

"I treated his grandmother once. We're not close."

Alexander seized her wrist. "How could you—Evelyn, when did you become like this?"

She laughed softly. "Mr. Hamilton, are we that familiar?"

"Are we not?"

"Then tell me—what's my least favorite color? When's my birthday? What's my phone passcode?"

Alexander stiffened.

"Let go." She tried to pull free. "Today's your engagement party. Don't let your fiancée misunderstand."

With a sudden jerk, he dragged her toward the door.

"Evelyn!" Peter moved to follow.

Vincent blocked him. "They need to talk." His gaze dropped meaningfully to Peter's belt. "That was... quick."

Peter flushed crimson. "It wasn't what you think—"

The storage room door slammed shut.

Evelyn rubbed her reddened wrist, only to be shoved against the wall before she could react.

"Have you lost your mind?!" Alexander's eyes were bloodshot. "If you want revenge, take it out on me! Why degrade yourself?!"

The lingering taste of soup made her grimace. She spat to the side.

The action ignited his fury.

"What was that?" His voice turned lethal.

"Dirty water." She met his glare head-on.

"EVELYN!!!"

"What's wrong with you?" She finally snapped. "Abandoning your engagement party to stalk your ex-wife? Alexander, we're divorced. Can't you act like a man and make a clean break?"
###Chapter 171: I Thought You Understood

"I got engaged to Annabelle because—"

"The reason doesn't matter." Evelyn cut him off. "It has nothing to do with me."

Alexander's knuckles turned white as he gripped her shoulders. "You won't even let me explain?"

"You call this talking calmly?"

Evelyn glanced at the crumpled fabric of her blouse.

He released her abruptly, regret flashing in his eyes.

She rubbed her sore shoulders, her voice steady. "I made myself clear on the phone. We were just coexisting. Now that your unattainable love is back, I'm stepping aside."

"That's not how it is—"

"Then what is it?" Evelyn smirked. "Annabelle married someone else, so you settled for me. Now that things fell apart between you, you remember your backup plan?"

Alexander suddenly seized her wrist. "Did these three years mean nothing to you?"

"Let go."

"I'm hurting too!" His voice cracked. "Every night I dream of you covered in blood, accusing me of killing our child—"

Evelyn jerked her face away.

"No one expected things to turn out this way." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Annabelle changed. The baby came at the wrong time... You can hate me, but at least hear me out."

"Finished?" She checked her watch. "I have plans."

"Going to celebrate that man's mother's birthday, right?"

Evelyn's pupils constricted. "What else do you know?"

"You don't love him."

"I don't love anyone." She curved her lips. "Happy now?"

A dark fire ignited in Alexander's eyes. "In three years of marriage, you never... Yet today you knelt before him—"

"What?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Annabelle wouldn't?"

"Stop mentioning her!"

"First," she raised a finger, "if your sex life is lacking, fix it yourself. Second—"

She leaned in suddenly, her red lips brushing his ear. "Those three years weren't anything special either."
###Chapter 172: The Edge of Hatred

Alexander Hamilton's expression darkened instantly.

Evelyn Carter's lips curved slightly. Even the most composed man would lose his temper when his masculinity was questioned.

"Evelyn, you hate me."

"Hate is too strong a word. I'm just tired of this."

"I never intended to disturb you these past months."

"Who wants their ex-husband stalking them after divorce? Your constant presence suffocates me."

Alexander's chest heaved. "I just wanted to make sure you were okay."

"I'm fine. My parents adore me, my sister looks up to me, and my career is thriving. Stop assuming my world ended when I left you. Life goes on—work, routines, everything. I simply returned to the path I was meant to be on. Understand?"

"..."

"Done? Then I'm leaving."

He seized her wrist. "One last question."

Evelyn shook him off. "Ask."

"Why would you do that for him? You don't even love him."

She laughed coldly. "So this is what's been eating at you. Regretting those three years?"

"No! I just don't understand—"

Evelyn gave him a long look before turning to push open the storage room door.

Outside, the noise of the crowded restaurant hit them.

The modest Cantonese eatery was an unlikely choice for any celebration in the upscale city of H. Even ordinary wedding banquets would overlook this place.

The cramped dining area was divided into sections: soldiers reuniting on the left, a graduation banquet on the right, and in the distance, Auntie Lucy's birthday celebration. The space reserved for the Hamilton-Anderson engagement party was nearly swallowed by the chaos.

Through the sea of heads, Evelyn spotted Mrs. Anderson in her wheelchair while Mr. Anderson raised a glass to Margaret Hamilton with an ingratiating smile. His deference was painful to watch.

Margaret barely touched her glass to his. Maintaining basic courtesy was her limit—between mourning Grandma Hamilton, her son's shattered marriage, and the grandchild that never was.

Then she spotted Evelyn and brightened.

Evelyn gestured toward a private room.

Five minutes later, Margaret hurried inside.

"Evelyn!"

Evelyn stood with a polite smile. "Mrs. Hamilton."
###Chapter 173: A Dignified Farewell

Margaret Hamilton hurried forward and gently embraced Evelyn Carter. She stroked Evelyn's back, her voice tender. "You've lost weight again. Is the hospital work too demanding?"

Evelyn offered a faint smile. "It's manageable. I'm used to it."

"Come, sit with me."

Margaret guided her to the plush booth seat. After a moment's hesitation, she broached the subject. "About Grandma—"

"I visited her," Evelyn interjected softly. "I brought her favorite lilies."

Margaret's eyes reddened slightly as she nodded. "She kept looking at the door in her final moments. I knew who she was waiting for."

Evelyn's fingers absently traced the rim of her teacup. "If there's a chance, I'll tell you."

"Alexander and Annabelle—"

"I know." Evelyn lifted her gaze, calm and steady. "I saw the news."

Margaret looked surprised. "Then why did you come here today?"

"I'm accompanying my mother to a friend's birthday dinner." Evelyn checked her watch. "The elders are waiting for me."

The warmth faded from Margaret's expression. "I see."

"Yes."

"Perhaps it's for the best." Margaret exhaled deeply. "Perhaps it is."

Evelyn stood. "Aunt Margaret, I should go now."

Margaret opened her mouth as if to say more, but ultimately just waved her off. "Go ahead. Don't forget to eat on time."

As Evelyn reached the door, a soft call came from behind.

"Evelyn!"

She paused but didn't turn around.

"...Never mind. Be careful on your way."

Evelyn gave a slight nod and stepped out.

The hallway lights were harsh against her eyes. She knew what Margaret had wanted to say—words that would only deepen the awkwardness between them. Better to leave things here, preserving the last shred of dignity for them both.

Back at the banquet table, Grace Anderson was anxiously scanning the room. "Where's Emily? She's been gone so long."

Evelyn took her seat. "She wasn't feeling well."

"That girl was fine this morning." Grace frowned. "All these elders are waiting."

Auntie Lucy smoothed things over with a smile. "No rush. Peter isn't back yet either."

"Oh," Grace turned to Evelyn, "Peter went looking for you two. Did you see him?"

Evelyn froze. The image flashed through her mind—the disheveled figure outside the restroom, Alexander Hamilton pulling her away without explanation.

"I'll go find him."

"Don't bother," Auntie Lucy stopped her. "He's a grown man. Probably called away by work again."

Grace looked puzzled. "State-owned enterprises keep people that busy now?"

Auntie Lucy sighed. "It's hard for those without connections. They get stuck with all the grunt work."
###Chapter 174: Normal Sibling Relationship

Grace Anderson gently patted Auntie Lucy's hand. "Peter has always been outstanding since childhood. It's good that his superiors value him."

Auntie Lucy sighed. "You know how state-owned enterprises are with their seniority system. Glamorous on the surface, but exhausting behind the scenes. If not for the stable salary, he might as well take risks in a private company."

"Today's youth face immense pressure. Having a stable job is already a blessing." Grace spoke soothingly. "Peter is still young. He has time."

Auntie Lucy suddenly grasped Grace's hand. "Isn't a mother's greatest wish for her child's safety and happiness?"

Grace's smile froze for a second. "This matter... ultimately depends on the children themselves."

"Don't worry, I just wanted to give you a heads-up." Auntie Lucy laughed heartily. "If it works out, great. If not, they'll still be good siblings. Our families' bond won't change."

Grace's tense shoulders finally relaxed.

"Was I too abrupt?" Auntie Lucy teased. "Look how I startled you both."

Andrew Anderson cleared his throat. "It is rather unexpected. Peter never mentioned anything before."

"That boy is a closed book!" Auntie Lucy shook her head. "He kept quiet to avoid affecting Evelyn's career. Who knew Evelyn would suddenly..."

Andrew's expression darkened. "That's my fault."

"I heard Evelyn married a corporate CEO?" Auntie Lucy lowered her voice. "When Peter found out, he was completely deflated."

"What's the use of a big company?" Andrew frowned. "Equality in marriage lasts."

"Exactly!" Auntie Lucy slapped the table. "How many of those who marry into wealth actually find happiness? We've known each other for years—I know your priority is the children's well-being."

Andrew hesitated. "But Evelyn is..."

"So what if she's divorced?" Auntie Lucy cut in. "I'm not some old-fashioned stickler. The children's happiness comes first!"

Just then, Peter Harrison walked in.

"Mom, what are you all discussing so animatedly?"

Auntie Lucy glared at him. "I told you to find Evelyn, and you disappeared?"

Peter's gaze lingered on Evelyn briefly before he smiled. "I accidentally bumped into a waiter and spilled soup on my pants. Had to clean up."

"Were you burned?" Auntie Lucy fretted, reaching to check.

"Mom!" Peter dodged. "Mr. Anderson and everyone are here."

Auntie Lucy finally relented, offering an apologetic smile. "Sorry to keep you waiting."

Andrew waved it off. "As long as you're unharmed."

Turning to Evelyn, Auntie Lucy spoke warmly. "Don't mind him, Evelyn. Peter isn't usually this clumsy."
###Chapter 175: Unspoken Understanding

Evelyn Carter gave a slight nod.

Peter Harrison's torn pants clung damply to his legs, the frayed fabric swaying with each step. Staying longer wasn't an option.

The sweet aftertaste of cake lingered on her lips as the simple birthday gathering drew to a close.

Grace Anderson stood by the restaurant entrance, brows furrowed.

Her eldest daughter had just endured her ex-husband's engagement party, and now her youngest had gone missing. The exhaustion weighed heavily on her.

Peter pulled up smoothly in his sedan. "Mr. Anderson, Mrs. Anderson, let me drive you home."

His modest car had ample space for everyone.

But Auntie Lucy was the guest of honor—they couldn't let her leave alone.

Andrew Anderson waved him off. "Emily isn't back yet. We'll wait a bit longer."

Grace anxiously scanned the street corner. "She's not answering her phone. I'm so worried."

Peter's gaze settled on Evelyn, silently seeking her opinion.

She knew her sister was likely lost in the throes of young love and wouldn't return anytime soon.

"Mom, Dad, go ahead. I'll find Emily."

Andrew's temper flared. "Off to see that good-for-nothing boy again!"

Grace hastily tugged his sleeve. "Peter's right here. Mind your words."

"I'm just saying—Peter's ten times better than that teacher! At least we know him!" Andrew grumbled.

Grace clapped a hand over his mouth. "Stop talking nonsense!"

Auntie Lucy smoothly interjected, "How about this? I'll ride the bus with you two, and Peter can take Evelyn to find her sister."

"We couldn't impose..." Grace protested.

Auntie Lucy smiled knowingly. "Who knows? We might all be family soon."

She raised her voice pointedly, "Peter, take good care of both sisters!"

His ears burned as he quickly ushered his parents into a taxi.

Only when the cab disappeared around the corner did he exhale. "Mom's always like this. Don't mind her. Let's just keep things as they were between us."

Evelyn gazed at the distant neon lights and softly murmured, "Mm."

The night breeze brushed through her hair, carrying the first chill of autumn.
###Chapter 176: The Unspoken Meaning of the Front Seat

Evelyn Carter observed his flushed cheeks and fidgeting fingers, responding calmly, "I've seen plenty of this at the hospital. Don't worry about it."

Peter Harrison's tense shoulders relaxed slightly when he saw her composed expression. "Let's get in the car first. We need to find Emily."

Evelyn checked her watch. Emily had been unreachable for over two hours. The three-hour deadline they'd set was approaching, yet her calls still went unanswered.

"Do you know where she is?"

Peter snapped his fingers confidently. "There's one place she's most likely at."

As Evelyn moved toward the back seat, Peter suddenly spoke up. "Sit in the front."

"Why?"

"A sprinkler truck passed by earlier. The rear windows were open." He pointed to the soaked fabric seats. "They're completely drenched."

Through the window, Evelyn saw the back seats were indeed soaked. Just as she hesitated, Peter had already circled the car and opened the passenger door for her.

Evelyn didn't move, her gaze locking onto his eyes.

Peter's Adam's apple bobbed. "What's wrong?"

"Do you know what the front seat signifies?"

He waved his hands hastily. "It really was an accident! Several cars parked along the street got hit..." His voice trailed off. "Just this once doesn't mean anything."

Five years later, this physics competition champion hadn't changed a bit. Auntie Lucy always praised her son for being honest and dependable—now Evelyn saw it was true. Even when lying, his ears turned red as boiled shrimp.

"Evelyn?"

She snapped out of her thoughts and slid into the passenger seat. Peter's movements were noticeably lighter as he closed the door, even humming a tune when he returned to the driver's side.

When the engine started, he was still smiling. "Is it... comfortable?" Realizing the unintended implication, he quickly added, "I meant the seat height!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"You can adjust the backrest!" He gestured frantically. "No need to reset it. It's usually just me in here anyway..." The more he explained, the more flustered he became, his grip leaving sweat marks on the steering wheel.

"Peter."

"Yeah?"

"Watch the road." Evelyn pointed to the flashing red light ahead.
###Chapter 177: Miss Annabelle's "Generosity"

The black sedan disappeared around the corner.

Alexander Hamilton stood motionless, the cigarette between his fingers burned down to the filter.

"Alex..." Annabelle Taylor approached in her white dress, her voice barely audible.

He crushed the cigarette abruptly. The ember flickered briefly in the trash bin before dying.

"Finished with the formalities?"

Annabelle lowered her head. "Aunt Margaret accompanied me through everything."

"Don't call her that." Alexander's tone was icy. "My mother isn't accustomed to it."

"But we're engaged..."

"Engagement isn't marriage."

She reached for his arm, but he sidestepped the gesture.

"Alex..." Tears splashed onto her dress. "I know I was wrong, truly I do..."

Alexander stared at the distant trees. "Can it bring Grandma back?"

"Even if I hadn't gone that day, she would've—"

"Enough!" He whirled around. "Annabelle, what happened to you?"

She lifted tear-filled eyes. "People change..."

"You've become unrecognizable." A bitter laugh escaped him. "Where's the kind girl I remember?"

"I swear!" She suddenly seized his hand. "I never forced her to terminate the pregnancy!"

Alexander shook her off. "Does it matter now?"

"We can have another child!" Her voice turned desperate. "IVF, surrogacy—"

"Surrogacy is illegal!" he snapped.

"Then..." She bit her lip. "You could have one with someone else. I'd raise it as my own—"

Alexander laughed coldly. "How 'magnanimous' of you, Miss Taylor."

"What choice do I have?" she sobbed. "I can't conceive anymore!"

"Then don't!"

"Fine!" Annabelle jerked her head up. "Bring the child's mother back if you want!"

Alexander studied her for several seconds before smiling mirthlessly. "What do you take me for? Some feudal lord with concubines?"

The wind lifted her dress, revealing a scar on her ankle.

A memento from taking a knife meant for him.
###Chapter 178: Old Flames and New Sparks

"What do you want from me?" Annabelle's voice trembled with tears. "I know I've wronged you. These days, I've barely dared to breathe..."

Alexander Hamilton's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Here we go again. The same old act whenever things don't go your way. Last time, you dragged Evelyn toward traffic outside the restaurant. Planning a repeat performance?"

His gaze was sharp as a blade, slicing through her facade.

"Is this what they taught you at law school overseas? Emotional blackmail with suicide threats?"

Tears spilled down Annabelle's cheeks. "You've changed! The Alexander I knew would never treat me like this!"

"Thanks to you." He turned to leave. "The paperwork's done. We're even."

"You're in love with her, aren't you?" Annabelle suddenly shrieked. "She's already riding in someone else's car!"

Alexander's back stiffened.

"What's so great about her? A workaholic, ice-cold, from a dirt-poor family!" Her voice turned hysterical. "She doesn't even lo—"

"Shut up!" Alexander whirled around, eyes blazing with fury.

Annabelle stumbled back but pressed on: "I saw her in the restroom with that man—"

"What else did you see?" He seized her wrist. "If this gets out—"

"Too late!" She wrenched free, tears mixing with vindictive triumph. "She's already moved on while you're still lying to yourself!"

——

By the basketball court, Peter Harrison parked and pointed. "Over there."

Evelyn Carter followed his gaze. Kyle Carter dashed across the court in a red jersey while Emily Anderson clutched a drink, her eyes shining like stars.

"They come often?"

"Yeah." Peter smiled. "That kid's got skills."

Evelyn stood quietly under the trees. She knew nothing about basketball, but even she could see the boy who'd once bowed awkwardly now glowed on the court.

Peter stepped beside her, gaze distant. "Youth is something else."

"Envious?"

"Of course." His voice was barely a whisper. "No mortgages, no car loans. Just pure, unfiltered passion."

Evelyn watched her sister's radiant smile. "But passion fades."

"At least they had it." He turned to her. "What about you? Ever felt that heartbeat racing?"

Her lashes fluttered slightly.

"Don't tell me... it was your ex?" Peter ventured.

The wind rustled through the leaves, filling the silence.
###Chapter 179: Resolving the Heartache

Evelyn turned around, a faint smile playing on her lips. "What do you think?"

Peter Harrison gazed into her eyes and slowly shook his head. "I understand now."

"Understand what?"

His voice softened. "I suddenly feel much better."

Evelyn averted her gaze, silent.

Peter's tone was gentle as water. "You don't like me, but you don't love your ex-husband either. After the divorce, you seemed completely unaffected. If it were Emily... she'd probably cry the sky down."

"What does that have to do with you feeling better?"

Peter chuckled low. "Turns out, I'm not so inferior to those wealthy heirs after all."

"Does your leg still hurt?"

"It's much better. The ice pack helped. You really are a doctor."

When they got out of the car, Evelyn deliberately walked ahead.

There was a suitcase in the trunk—likely Peter's, filled with spare clothes.

She waited, and sure enough, Peter soon appeared wearing loose athletic shorts.

Evelyn knelt to examine his leg. "Still a bit swollen. It'll go down in a few days. Keep it dry to avoid infection."

Peter murmured in agreement. "Getting a free consultation from Dr. Carter. Thanks for going easy on me."

She stood up, smiling faintly. "You wouldn’t even book an appointment with me at the hospital. I’m in OB-GYN."

Perhaps it was their childhood friendship, but after just a few words, the awkwardness between them faded.

"Evelyn."

"Hmm?"

"That video at the hospital entrance... I saw it."

Her lashes flickered, but her expression remained calm. "I heard it went viral."

"Very viral. Though most of the attention was on Mr. Hamilton getting cheated on. People praised you for being quick-witted and brave."

Evelyn gave a quiet "Mm."

"By the way, do you know Mr. Hamilton? Back at the restaurant, the way he looked at you... I was afraid he’d retaliate."

She raised a brow. "Retaliate against me?"

"You exposed his fiancée’s scandal in public and humiliated him. If he wanted revenge, ordinary people like us wouldn’t stand a chance."

Evelyn said softly, "His fiancée was the one in the wrong, not me. If she hadn’t provoked me first, I wouldn’t have exposed her."

"True. The Hamiltons are too powerful for petty grudges. Besides, you’re divorced now. No reason to hunt down an ex-wife."

Just then, Emily came rushing over, clutching a man’s jacket and a half-empty water bottle.

Evelyn sighed. "Do you know how late it is? Mom and Dad are worried sick."

Emily stuck out her tongue. "The basketball game was too exciting. I lost track of time."

"You..."

"Please, sis? Cover for me this once!"

Peter tapped her forehead. "Your sister and I will lie for you this time. But if it happens again, you’re on your own."
###Chapter 180: The Ice Queen

Emily Anderson bounded up to Peter Harrison like an excited bunny, her eyes sparkling. "Peter, you're the best!"

Peter pushed her away with a look of distaste. "Keep your distance. You're too much trouble."

"I am not!" Emily puffed out her cheeks.

"Not bad, just exhausting."

"Hmph!" Emily suddenly remembered something and turned toward the basketball court. "Kyle—"

The young man dribbling the ball glanced over.

Emily playfully crooked her finger at him.

The boys on the court erupted into chatter, teasing and hollering:

"Ooooh, meeting the family?"

"Who's that ice queen?"

Kyle Carter flushed red as he explained, "That's Emily's sister."

"Sister-in-law, huh?" One boy smirked and nudged him. "Is she single?"

Kyle shoved him away. "Shut up. She's married."

"Ha! Look, her husband's right there!"

Kyle was jostled forward by his teammates, who trailed behind him like an entourage of nosy spectators.

His palms were sweating. "Hello..."

Emily eagerly tugged her sister's sleeve. "Evelyn, this is my boyfriend Kyle—captain of the school basketball team!"

Evelyn Carter studied the sunlit young man before her and gave a slight nod. "Not bad."

"Say something!" Emily prodded Kyle.

"H-hi, sis..." he stammered. "Last time, outside the tutoring center..."

"I remember." Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Your bow was very proper."

A burst of laughter erupted behind them.

Kyle's ears turned crimson.

Evelyn's gaze swept over the group of boys, and they immediately fell silent. A few even ducked their heads shyly.

"These your teammates?"

"Yeah. Bunch of lunatics." Kyle scratched his head.

Evelyn gave a small nod. "They seem lively."

She turned back to Kyle. "Got a minute to talk?"
###Chapter 181: The Bloom of Youth

Kyle froze, his fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of his sweatshirt. "I do have time..." He glanced down at his sweat-drenched T-shirt. "Mind if I change first? I reek of sweat."

"Go ahead," Evelyn nodded slightly. "Emily and I will wait here."

Kyle turned to leave with fresh clothes but paused mid-step. He glanced at the man beside Evelyn and gave an awkward half-bow. "You must be her husband? Nice to meet you. I'll be right back."

Emily smacked his back. "Wrong guess! This is Peter Harrison."

"Huh?" Kyle blinked in confusion. "But didn't you say your sister was married?"

"What does that have to do with anything?" Emily's eyes widened. "She's an independent woman now!"

Kyle hurriedly apologized. "Sorry, sis—I mean, ma'am. And... sorry, sir."

Peter offered a gentle smile. "No worries. Go change."

Kyle jogged toward the restroom, trailed by a chorus of teasing from his teammates.

"Yo Kyle, how much older is that sister of hers?"

"Shut up!" Kyle waved them off irritably.

"Don't be shy! We all heard—she's a single career woman~"

Kyle whirled around. "Keep dreaming! Emily told me her ex was some big-shot CEO. If she turned him down, what makes you think she'd look twice at you?"

"Different league," a teammate waggled his eyebrows. "Those old guys can't compete with young studs like us. Check out these abs—"

Kyle kicked him. "Get lost! One more word and I'll shut your mouth for good!"

"Hey, maybe she's into puppy-dog types! We could be brothers-in-law someday..."

This time Kyle didn't hold back, sweeping the guy's legs out from under him. Raucous laughter erupted around them.

Evelyn and Emily had barely waited five minutes when Kyle returned, freshly changed.

"Your friends aren't joining us?" Evelyn asked.

Kyle shook his head vehemently. "They're not coming." The last thing he needed was his idiot friends spouting more nonsense.

Evelyn studied the group behind him but didn't press further.

The four settled into a nearby dessert shop where Emily confidently ordered their signature treats.

Kyle perched awkwardly in the corner. "That's enough—we won't finish all that."

Peter and Evelyn each ordered an Americano.

As they waited, Evelyn cut to the chase. "Kyle, I hear you're applying to universities in the capital?"

He straightened immediately. "Yes. I've researched some second-tier schools there."

"Do your parents know about you and Emily?"

"...Not yet."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened.

Emily kicked him under the table. "He was just about to tell them!"

"Oh?" Evelyn stirred her coffee. "When exactly?"

Beads of sweat formed on Kyle's forehead. "Just... waiting for the right moment..."

"What constitutes the right moment?"

"When my parents are in a good mood..."

"They disapprove of you dating?"
###Chapter 182: Free Choice, I Won't Interfere

Kyle Carter's Adam's apple bobbed. "I'm not opposed, it's just..."

He stole a glance at Evelyn Carter, his voice trailing off. "My dad has an old comrade whose daughter... Our families joked about arranging a marriage when we were kids..."

Emily Anderson cut in immediately. "Childhood betrothal? That's so outdated! We believe in free love now, right sis?"

Evelyn remained silent.

Emily turned to Peter Harrison for support.

But Peter surprised everyone by asking, "Kyle, have you met this girl?"

"Yes."

"Does she know about this arrangement?"

"...She does."

"What's her stance?"

"She... hasn't refused or agreed."

Peter smiled meaningfully. "Oh?"

Kyle paled. "I'll clarify things with my family."

"When did you first learn about this?"

"About... five or six years old?"

"You're eighteen now. So for over a decade, you never clearly objected?"

Kyle's eyes reddened with frustration. "Peter, I was just a kid! How could I know who I'd like in the future? You can't hold me to that standard..."

Peter's expression turned icy. "You've been dating Emily for so long. If you've found someone you love, why haven't you settled this with your family? At the very least, you should've made your position clear."

Kyle bit his lip hard.

"It's over a thousand kilometers from H City to the capital, with completely different climates. You want Emily to give up her spot at a top-tier university here and follow you to an unfamiliar city, while you haven't even resolved your own family situation?"

Emily stomped her foot anxiously. "Peter, why are you suddenly—"

"Quiet." Evelyn's sharp glance silenced her instantly.

Peter continued, "Kyle, truly loving someone means considering their needs. The capital might suit your scores, but what about Emily? She has family, friends, and better options here. What security can you offer her?"

Kyle jutted his chin stubbornly. "This is between Emily and me. If she's willing, no one has the right to interfere. Love is free—whether to go to the capital is her choice, not even her parents can decide for her."

"Fine." Evelyn stood calmly. "Free choice, I won't interfere. Peter, let's go."

Peter frowned. "Evelyn..."

"Now." She took several bills from her purse and placed them on the table. "The coach probably isn't running anymore. Take a cab back. Talk it through. If you still decide on the capital, I'll handle our parents."
###Chapter 183: The Demolition Dispute

Emily Anderson stood frozen in place.

She had expected a scolding from her sister, but Evelyn Carter's reaction took her by surprise.

Even more shocking was Peter Harrison's sudden change in attitude.

Watching her sister walk away with Peter after paying the bill, Emily felt like a heavy stone weighed on her heart.

Kyle Carter's face darkened. "What was that about? Your sister and that guy think I'm dragging you down? They just look down on me!"

"Stop," Emily whispered, her voice trembling.

Inside the car, Peter frowned.

"You're always the rational one. Kyle's family situation is a mess. Are you really going to convince your parents to let Emily go to Beijing with him? Are you willing to gamble with her future? What if he abandons her there, using 'parental orders' as an excuse?"

Evelyn fastened her seatbelt. "So what do you suggest? Forcing them apart?"

"At least make Kyle commit to ending that childhood betrothal."

"If it could be resolved, it would've been done by now. The fact that it's dragged on this long means he's either a mama's boy or keeping his options open."

"And you're just going to watch Emily walk into this disaster?"

"Don't you remember teenage rebellion? The more you oppose them, the more they dig in. They'll turn it into some grand 'love against the world' drama. If I play the villain now, I’ll only push them closer."

Peter raised an eyebrow. "Didn’t realize you were such an expert."

"Remember Vivian and her situation? The harder her family resisted, the more determined she became."

"So what’s your plan?"

Evelyn gazed out the window. "Give her time. She’s not that foolish."

Peter started the car, then suddenly frowned.

"That white Cayenne is following us again."

"Let it." Evelyn closed her eyes.

Peter kept glancing in the rearview mirror, but seeing Evelyn's indifference, he relaxed slightly.

The Cayenne had appeared too often lately.

At first, he suspected Alexander Hamilton. But then he reconsidered—Hamilton Group had been embroiled in scandals for months. The CEO’s hit-and-run arrest, his new fling making headlines, the plummeting stock price. Alexander had enough on his plate without playing stalker.

Besides, today was his engagement party.

Evelyn’s calmness was unsettling.

The atmosphere at home was heavier than expected.

When Evelyn opened the door, her parents sat stiffly in the living room, the air thick with tension.

"Mom, Dad, how was the bus ride?" she asked, forcing lightness into her voice.

Andrew Anderson patted the couch. "Sit down."

"What’s wrong?"

"Evelyn…" Her father hesitated, then sighed. "Let your mother explain."
###Chapter 184: Alexander's Scheme

"What's wrong?"

Grace Anderson's face turned pale. "Your father and I just saw a notice from the neighborhood office downstairs... Our area is being demolished."

Evelyn Carter looked up sharply. "Since when?"

"The notice says we have to move out before National Day."

It was already July—less than three months left.

"So sudden? There was no warning?"

Andrew Anderson sighed. "There were rumors before, but your mother and I didn’t take them seriously. This was a company welfare apartment—small and old. The compensation won’t be much..."

Evelyn immediately understood her parents' worries. She steadied herself. "I still have some vacation days left. I’ll help you find a rental first."

Her mother gave a bitter smile. "Renting isn’t the issue. But what about you and your sister? Your father and I were just ordinary workers. We’d hoped selling this place could give you girls a little extra..."

"Don’t worry. I’ll save up for a few more years. Emily’s still in college—she might buy her own place someday."

Andrew scoffed. "You? Maybe. But Emily? She’s still a child. You tutored right after high school. All she cares about is that physics professor."

"Dad, don’t underestimate her. She’s my sister. She’ll be fine."

"She’s not even—"

"Andrew!" Grace cut in sharply.

He caught himself and muttered, "Even dragons have different offspring. Forget it. Just go back to the hospital after your break. Take too long, and someone might take your spot. That job’s stable and respectable—don’t slack off."

Evelyn nodded. "I know."

"You’ve always been the reliable one. Not like your sister..."

She changed the subject. "By the way, why the sudden demolition? We’re so far from downtown."

Andrew shrugged. "Old Li downstairs said some company wants to build an amusement park here."

Evelyn’s mind raced.

The land was cheap—perfect for low-cost demolition.

"Auntie Lucy mentioned Peter’s design firm is handling the project."

"Really?"

"Yeah, but they only do the planning. They don’t decide demolition."

Evelyn tensed. "What company’s on the notice?"

"Uh... Great Enterprise Construction?"

Her stomach dropped.

Great Enterprise Construction.

She’d never met her ex-father-in-law, but she knew Alexander’s father was named William Hamilton.

Maybe she was overthinking.

The Hamiltons specialized in luxury homes and hotels—nothing to do with amusement parks.

She pulled out her phone and searched.

The screen flashed: Great Enterprise Construction, wholly owned subsidiary of Hamilton Group.

Evelyn let out a cold laugh.

She grabbed her phone and headed for the door.

Grace called after her, "Evelyn! Dinner’s almost ready!"

"Go ahead. I need to make a call."
###Chapter 185: You're the Mother of My Son

Evelyn descended the stairs.

The familiar black Cayenne waited silently outside the apartment building.

She remembered this spot being empty half an hour ago when Peter had dropped her off. The narrow roads of this aging residential area were already cramped—the massive SUV now occupied half the lane.

Fortunately, most residents here were elderly. No one would complain about the parking situation.

Alexander leaned against the car door, a cigarette between his fingers.

Seeing her emerge, he immediately stubbed it out and straightened up.

"Going out?" he asked.

Evelyn remained on the steps. "Why are you here?"

He opened the passenger door. "Get in. We'll talk inside."

"No need. Say it here."

His grip tightened then loosened on the door handle. "Your parents might see."

With a cold laugh, Evelyn strode past him and yanked open the rear door instead.

Alexander hesitated before closing the front door and circling to the driver's side.

The cabin reeked of tobacco.

Evelyn rolled down the window, wrinkling her nose. "Since when do you smoke?"

"Recently." His voice was rough. "Stress."

"The mighty CEO of Hamilton Group, thriving in both career and love—what stress could you possibly have?"

"Evelyn—"

"Or is the amusement park project hitting snags?" Her gaze locked onto his. "Great Enterprise Construction is your subsidiary, isn't it?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Yes."

"Congratulations on expanding your empire."

"Must you always speak like this?" Suddenly he leaned forward, bracing his arms on either side of her seat. "Can we have a real conversation?"

She pressed back against the leather. "About what? Your fiancée?"

"She's irrelevant."

"Then what is relevant?"

His breathing grew heavier. "You are. These past weeks... I've been thinking about us."

"Figured anything out?"

"Yes." His voice dropped, resolute. "I won't deny I once had feelings for Annabelle. But that's history. After she married, I let go completely."

Evelyn turned her face away. "And?"

"Then I met you." His fingertips brushed a stray lock of her hair. "Every day of our marriage mattered to me. Even when Annabelle returned, leaving you never crossed my mind."

"Yet you chose her anyway."

"Because—" Alexander seized her hand and pressed it against his chest. "Evelyn, you're the mother of my son!"

His heartbeat thundered against her palm—wild and insistent.

She jerked her hand back. "So what?"

"It means..." Flames ignited in his eyes. "We can never just be strangers."
###Chapter 186: Can We Talk About Us Now?

Alexander's lashes fluttered slightly as his Adam's apple bobbed. "That's the decision I regret most in my life."

"The choice was yours, and you picked Annabelle." Evelyn's voice was eerily calm. "It's like being at a cliff's edge—if both of us were falling, whose hand would you reach for?"

"That hypothetical means nothing."

"I've been wondering why I ever agreed to marry you." Evelyn gazed out the window. "Grandma Hamilton and Margaret were so kind to me that I mistook it for happiness. I thought quiet companionship was the purest form of love."

"...I understand."

"You don't." Evelyn whirled around abruptly. "I could've bowed out gracefully and let you two have your happy ending. But that phone call? Alexander, couldn't you leave me even a shred of dignity?"

His gaze burned. "Because I regretted it. Because I wanted us to start over. Does that humiliation you?"

"Shouldn't it?" Her laugh was icy. "I'll always be your backup plan. When Annabelle rejected you, you settled for someone with a similar name. Now that you're tired of her, you remember my virtues. Alexander, you can't have it both ways."

"Yes, I can."

Evelyn found this absurd.

"When someone is the answer, you don't need to choose."

"Enough platitudes." She cut him off. "How do you plan to handle the demolition issue?"

"I purchased the vacant lot behind the hospital."

Evelyn's fingers twitched. That was where she'd lost their child.

"Three underground levels for medical cold storage, thirty floors of residential space above." Alexander held her gaze. "Relocation housing for the displaced residents. Your parents could move there—just ten minutes from your workplace."

She bit her lower lip hard.

"I knew you'd refuse if I offered the property directly." His voice lowered. "This solves both the demolition problem and reunites you with your family. The compensation remains unchanged—every penny accounted for."

"..."

"Now," Alexander stepped closer, "can we finally discuss our future?"
###Chapter 187: Her "Dearest Friend"

"What more is there to say between us?"

Alexander Hamilton turned around, his gaze burning into her. "Evelyn Carter, I love you." His voice was low but firm. "I want to be with you again. I know others are pursuing you now, but I won’t give up. At least give me a fair chance to compete."

Evelyn scoffed. "What about your fiancée?"

"You know everything—my grandmother, my mother, the company. Annabelle and I ended long ago." His brows furrowed. "The only reason I agreed to the engagement is because Mrs. Lightfoot threatened to kill herself—"

"Have you considered what she’d do if she found out you’re entangled with your ex-wife?"

"That won’t happen." His voice turned hoarse. "Annabelle can’t have children. They just want me to take care of her for the rest of her life. As for who’s by my side, they’ve already accepted it."

Evelyn jerked her head up. "So what? You want me to be your dirty little secret? Or the homewrecker who ruins someone else’s marriage?"

"It’s not like that!" Alexander gripped her shoulders. "I won’t legally marry Annabelle. It’s just for show—"

"Enough!" Evelyn shoved him away. "Alexander Hamilton, you’re too arrogant! Our marriage was never about love. I never loved you! Why would you think I’d sacrifice my dignity for you?"

His pupils contracted sharply. "You never loved me? Then who? That mediocre childhood friend of yours?"

"To people like you, Peter Harrison might not seem successful. But to my parents, he’s stable, reliable—that’s enough."

"Your parents approved?" Alexander’s voice tightened. "Do you love him?"

"Does love even matter?" Her lips curled mockingly. "I didn’t love you when I married you. Peter and I are equals—similar backgrounds, similar incomes, our families have been close for years. With him, at least I’ll have stability."

Alexander suddenly looked toward the window.

The car window had been left open from his earlier smoking. Peter Harrison had returned unnoticed and stood outside, listening to every word.

His expression was complex as he glanced between Evelyn and Alexander. "Evelyn, you left your wallet in my car."

She pushed the door open. "Thank you."

"Be more careful next time." Peter’s gaze flicked meaningfully to Alexander. "If you drop it in someone else’s car, you might not get it back."

Alexander’s face darkened. He stepped out and confronted Peter. "Mr. Harrison, I presume? I’m Evelyn’s husband, Alexander Hamilton."

"Ex-husband," Evelyn corrected coldly.

Peter smiled pleasantly. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Hamilton. I’m Evelyn’s..." He paused, then added pointedly, "Dearest friend."

"Dearest friend?" Alexander narrowed his eyes.

"Yes. The very closest kind." Peter’s smile was disarmingly innocent.

Alexander’s expression turned stormy.
###Chapter 188: The Boomerang

Evelyn's lips curved slightly.

"Good friend."

Those three words had once been a thorn, deeply embedded in her heart.

Now they had transformed into a sharp boomerang, flying straight toward Alexander Hamilton.

Peter Harrison continued chattering away: "We grew up together—over twenty years of friendship. From elementary school through high school, we attended the same schools. I even helped her choose her medical school application."

Alexander's expression darkened dangerously.

Evelyn seized the moment to intervene: "Mr. Hamilton is here to survey the area. He plans to turn our neighborhood into an amusement park."

Peter's eyes widened in realization. "Ah, I see. I thought—"

"Thought what?" Alexander cut in coldly.

"Nothing. I just heard from my mom that the neighborhood was being demolished. I didn’t expect it to be your project. What a coincidence."

Evelyn added softly, "Mr. Hamilton has promised to provide relocation housing in the city center. The housing issue is already resolved."

Peter brightened. "Really? That’s fantastic! My mom’s been worried about renting. Evelyn, let’s pick the same floor, yeah? Keep our families as neighbors."

"Looking to mooch meals again?" Evelyn chuckled.

"Aunt Grace’s cooking is incredible! I’ll pay for my share—even help out in the kitchen."

"Please. Mom adores it when you praise her cooking. She always packs extras for you. She’d love to have you over every day."

Peter scratched his head. "At least save me some dignity in front of Mr. Hamilton..."

"Come on. Mom’s already cooking."

"Are you sure that’s... appropriate?"

"Stop pretending to be polite. Take some for your mom too—save her the trouble."

Peter’s eyes sparkled. "Perfect! Mom hates cooking. I’m sick of instant noodles."

"Whenever Aunt Lucy doesn’t feel like cooking, just come over. The more, the merrier."

"Then I won’t hold back."

Evelyn turned to Alexander. "Mr. Hamilton, we’ll be going now. I’ll treat you to dinner another time."

She tugged Peter toward the apartment building.

Their conversation drifted back faintly:

"Wasn’t today Mr. Hamilton’s engagement party? How does he have time to survey land?"

"As long as the bride doesn’t mind."

"True. But it’s rare for exes to stay friends after divorce."

"Don’t use the word 'friend.'"

"Why not?"

"It’s misleading."

"What should I say if people ask?"

Evelyn murmured something.

Alexander didn’t catch it.

The apartment door slammed shut, sealing away the final words behind cold steel and concrete.
###Chapter 189: Mourning My Dead Love

Evelyn Carter's life continued its usual routine.

Life always comes with troubles.

Her top priority was finding new housing for her parents.

Then came the second issue—her younger sister Emily Anderson had just gone through a breakup.

Evelyn felt helpless. Comforting others wasn't her forte, especially when it came to heartbreak. Words seemed pointless. But this was her sister—she couldn't just ignore her.

When Emily begged her to go drinking, Evelyn hesitated only briefly before agreeing.

At this age, Emily reminded her so much of Vivian Dempsey back in the day. Vivian had been utterly shattered by love, nearly pushed to the edge. In comparison, Emily just wanted to drown her sorrows—at least there was no life-threatening drama.

Evelyn deliberately chose a reputable bar and picked the most secluded booth. She made Emily sit on the inside while she guarded the outer seat, ensuring no one would take advantage of a drunk young girl.

Emily was already tipsy, tears smearing her face as she slumped over the table with hiccups. "Sis... when you divorced Alexander, did it hurt?"

"Not really," Evelyn replied flatly.

Emily pouted, fresh tears welling up. "Why did I even ask? You're made of stone. You don’t get heartbroken over romance."

"Mm."

"But sis, I'm really hurting." Emily straightened up and took another swig of her beer. "I fought with Mom and Dad for him. I was going to change my college plans just to follow him to the capital. And then he did this to me."

Last night, Emily had called her from the garden, sobbing uncontrollably. Evelyn had rushed downstairs only to be tackled in a tearful embrace.

There hadn’t been time for details then—just damage control.

Thankfully, Emily still had some sense left. By the time they got home, she’d quieted down, tiptoeing to avoid waking their parents.

This morning, she’d pestered Evelyn to take her drinking. She’d held it together the whole way, but after a few drinks, the dam broke.

"What exactly did he say to you yesterday?"

Emily cursed through gritted teeth. "That bastard gave me an ultimatum—choose between my family and him. Pick my family, and we’re done."

Evelyn frowned. "He actually said that?"

"Yeah." Emily nodded drunkenly.

"And if you chose him?"

Emily suddenly let out a bitter laugh. "He said if I picked him, he’d call off his childhood betrothal and elope with me to the capital. As if I’m that stupid. That option costs him nothing—he’d still go to college like planned. Elope? His tuition depends on his parents. What kind of elopement is that?"

Evelyn couldn’t help but chuckle. "You don’t think eloping is romantic?"

Emily stared at her like she’d grown a second head. "Sis, are you possessed?"

"How so?"

Emily shook her head firmly. "My sister is way too smart and practical to ask something that dumb."

"Maybe I was trying to see it from your perspective. I thought you might find it cool."

Emily scoffed. "Sis, do you think I’m an idiot?"

"...Of course not." Evelyn subtly moved the beer bottle farther away. "If you saw through him, why are you still so upset?"

Emily shook her head. "You wouldn’t get it. I’m mourning my dead love."

Evelyn nearly winced at the cheesiness.

"Sis, I kind of understand you now. If you’re tough enough, breakups don’t hurt as much. Like you and Alexander—you acted like it was nothing. I really admire that."

Evelyn didn’t comment. "Lately, I’ve been wondering if youth is supposed to be this painful. Maybe I’ll regret not fully experiencing it by staying so detached."

"Don’t you dare regret it! You’re lucky. You have no idea how much this hurts... Even though I dumped him and saw his true colors, it still hurts so much... Ugh—"
###Chapter 190: A Familiar Face

Evelyn Carter took her first sip of alcohol too quickly. The liquor rushed straight to her head.

Clamping a hand over her mouth, she bolted outside. Annabelle Taylor barely had time to dodge—a few drops splattered onto her sleeve.

"Could you help, please?" Annabelle called a server over. Together, they guided Evelyn to the restroom.

Once Evelyn finished vomiting, Annabelle settled her into a booth.

"A glass of warm water, please."

The server returned swiftly with the water and gestured to Annabelle's stained sleeve. "You should clean that. I'll watch her."

Annabelle hesitated, glancing at her unconscious sister.

"I'll be right back."

In the restroom, she scrubbed her sleeve until the scent of lemon overpowered the alcohol.

When she returned to the booth, it was empty.

"Where's my sister?" She grabbed the server's arm.

The server paled. "She was just here..."

Annabelle immediately dialed Peter Harrison.

"Peter, where are you?"

"I was about to call you," his cheerful voice came through. "Mom's here to discuss the move. Your parents said you two were shopping?"

"Emily's missing." Her voice dropped to a whisper.

A beat of silence.

"Wait for me."

Peter caught on instantly. "Tell them it's a work emergency. I'll be there in ten."

Hanging up, Annabelle's palms grew clammy.

Her sister could barely walk straight. Where could she have gone?

Her gaze swept the room—then froze.

"Never mind."

The server followed her line of sight.

Annabelle was already striding toward the billiards hall.

Through the arched doorway, she spotted a figure leaning against a pool table—

Someone she knew all too well.
###Chapter 191: Chance Encounter at the Bar

The air froze the moment their eyes met.

"Well, if it isn't the famous Dr. Evelyn Carter."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, studying the flamboyant red-haired man before her. His leather jacket clung to his lean frame, and the glaring light reflected off the feminine earring on his left ear. He looked nothing like the polished executive secretary she'd last seen in a tailored suit.

"Andy Taylor."

"You remember me?" Andy planted his pool cue firmly on the ground, tilting his head with a smirk. "Perfect timing. We have unfinished business regarding my sister."

Evelyn's peripheral vision caught sight of Emily swaying unsteadily nearby.

"Emily, come here."

Emily nodded obediently. "Okay."

A pool cue suddenly blocked her path as Andy chuckled. "Dr. Carter, your sister came willingly to play with me."

"What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said." Andy whistled. "Isn't that right, little one?"

Emily's cheeks were flushed, her gaze hazy but still recognizing her sister. "Sis... this brother said he'd teach me... I won't play basketball anymore..."

Evelyn's temples throbbed with anger as she reached out to pull her sister away.

The pool cue cracked against her forearm, leaving an angry red mark.

"Dr. Carter, what's the hurry?" Andy licked his teeth. "Every debt has its debtor. My sister will be here soon."

No sooner had he spoken than the billiards hall door swung open.

"Sis! Brother-in-law! Over here!"

Alexander Hamilton strode in with an oppressive aura, Annabelle Taylor hurrying behind him. He stopped beside Evelyn, his gaze sweeping over Emily before locking onto Andy's face. "I brought her."

Annabelle frantically tugged at his sleeve. "Alexander, I promise I won't—"

He shook her off, his eyes never leaving Evelyn. "What are you doing in a place like this?"

Evelyn clenched her fists. "Looking for my sister."

"Emily, let's go home."

"No!" Emily stumbled back. "Mom and Dad will kill me... Sis, you promised I could have fun today..."

Andy laughed triumphantly. "Hear that, Dr. Carter? It's not me keeping her here."

Alexander suddenly stepped forward, his tall frame shielding Evelyn completely. "Andy, know your limits."

"Brother-in-law, I wouldn't dare!" Andy sneered. "The whole family depends on you now..."

"Let her go."

"I did!" Andy spread his hands. "It's the little sister who—"

His words cut off abruptly. Alexander had twisted his wrist, making Andy yelp in pain. "Ow ow ow! Brother-in-law, let go!"
###Chapter 192: Stay at My Place Tonight

Evelyn's vision darkened as Alexander's towering figure suddenly blocked her view.

A sickening crack echoed from the pool table, followed by Andy's agonized scream.

"Let him go." Alexander's voice was glacial.

Andy gasped in pain. "Bro-in-law...I was wrong..."

"I told you not to call me that."

"Ah—Annabelle! Help me!"

Annabelle stamped her foot anxiously. "Alexander, please release him—"

He turned sharply, his piercing glare silencing her. "One more word, and you're next."

She immediately clammed up, eyes welling with tears.

"Evelyn," Alexander said without looking back, "take your sister and leave."

Evelyn rushed forward and yanked the limp Emily from her chair. "Wake up!"

Emily blinked drowsily, giggling. "Sis...this wine...so good..."

"You idiot!" Evelyn wanted to shake her, but Emily slumped like a ragdoll.

"Evelyn!" Peter's voice came from the doorway.

She exhaled in relief. "Peter!"

He hurried over, frowning at Emily's state. "How did she get this drunk?"

"She overdid it on her first try. Completely out of it."

Without hesitation, Peter shrugged off his suit jacket. "Hold this."

He scooped Emily up bridal-style, nearly straining his back. "Whoa, she's heavier than she looks."

Evelyn draped the jacket over her sister. "Should we get a server to help?"

Peter winked. "Relax, I can handle carrying your sister."

She gave him an exasperated look. "This isn't the time for jokes."

"You're too tense," he murmured. "I've got you. Don't worry."

Evelyn shook her head. "We can't go home. Mom and Dad would kill her if they saw this."

"Then my place," Peter offered. "Company dorm. It's empty."

"But—"

"No arguments. I won't feel safe with you two at a hotel."

As Evelyn hesitated, Alexander's icy voice cut in. "Mr. Harrison."

Peter finally noticed him and nodded apologetically. "Mr. Hamilton. Pardon my haste."

His gaze flickered to Annabelle standing nearby. With deliberate emphasis, he added, "Ah, Mrs. Hamilton. How...devoted you both look."
###Chapter 193: Evelyn's Boyfriend?

Annabelle's hand slid onto Alexander's arm with a coy smile. "And this is... Evelyn's boyfriend?"

Peter froze, his gaze shifting to Evelyn.

Evelyn's expression turned icy. "Enjoy your evening, Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton. We'll be leaving now."

She nudged Peter.

Understanding her cue, Peter gave Alexander a polite nod before scooping up Emily and following Evelyn.

"Evelyn, aren't you and Mr. Hamilton friends? Isn't it rude to just walk away like—"

Evelyn didn't slow down. She yanked open the glass door.

Peter wisely fell silent, carrying Emily outside. Evelyn followed without a backward glance.

Her retreating figure was resolute.

Only when she disappeared around the corner did Alexander finally look away. His voice was cold as he addressed Andy. "Your sister is your responsibility now."

He turned to leave.

"Andy called after him, "When are you coming back, Alex? I need to take her home."

Alexander paused. "Uncertain. Send her back to the Taylor residence."

"Alex!" Annabelle grabbed his sleeve. "Call me when you return, okay? I'll go home myself."

He pulled his arm free. "The business trip duration is undetermined."

Her voice grew urgent. "Then let me stay with your mother. She shouldn't be alone—"

"Auntie Marry is with her."

"But I want to learn to cook your favorite dishes..."

"Annabelle." Alexander's tone turned glacial. "Stay away from my mother."

Her face paled. "I know I was wrong, I just—"

"Don't disturb her." He cut her off. "You know how devastated she was after Grandmother's passing."

At the mention of Grandma Hamilton, Annabelle's defiance crumbled.

Her eyes reddened. "We're engaged. You promised my parents."

Alexander gave her a long, inscrutable look before walking away.

Outside, Evelyn was already gone.

Only a white Cayenne remained parked in the rain.

Inside the car, Peter glanced at the rearview mirror.

Emily slept soundly in her sister's arms, her breathing even.

Evelyn gently wiped sweat from her sister's forehead.

Suddenly, she looked up—meeting Peter's gaze in the mirror.

He quickly averted his eyes and cleared his throat.

"Peter, if it's inconvenient, we can stay at a hotel."

"Almost there," he said. "You and Emily take my place. I'll go home."

"But your apartment is so far from the Design Institute."

"I'll manage." He changed the subject. "What will you tell your parents?"

Evelyn studied her sister's sleeping face with a headache.

This girl had too many secrets. No plausible excuse came to mind.

"Tell them you stayed out shopping too late and crashed at my place? They trust me."

It would have to do.

Peter added, "By the way, I found two adjacent apartments at City Lights. Close to the hospital. Want to check them out?"

Evelyn went still.
###Chapter 194: Do You Need Me to Come Over?

Peter Harrison's voice came through the phone. "What's wrong?"

"I'm currently renting in that neighborhood."

Peter chuckled. "What a coincidence. If Uncle Andrew and Aunt Grace move there too, your whole family could live in the same community."

Evelyn Carter gave a soft hum of agreement.

"I can help you pack these next couple of days. We can move everything over the weekend."

"No need to trouble yourself. We've already hired movers."

"Movers are usually male workers. With just you and Emily there, I don't feel comfortable leaving you alone. It's better to have a man around for situations like this."

Evelyn initially thought Peter was overreacting.

Until moving day arrived.

The moment the movers stepped inside, their demeanor shifted.

Seven or eight burly men crowded into the cramped living room, making the air feel oppressive.

The leader, a cigarette dangling from his lips, quoted an outrageous price. "This is the number. Take it or leave it."

Andrew Anderson slammed his hand on the table. "That's enough to buy a brand-new fridge! We're not moving anymore. Get out."

"Leave?" The man blew out a smoke ring. "After all my boys wasted a trip? At least pay for the gas."

"You didn't move a single thing, and you want money?"

"That's the rule."

Evelyn stood by the window, looking down.

The familiar white Cayenne wasn't parked in its usual spot today.

The irony struck her.

She and Alexander Hamilton were always out of sync.

When she wanted to build a life together, he chose someone else.

When she started anew, he came back to complicate things.

Now, when she needed help, he was nowhere to be found.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Evelyn? Have the movers arrived?"

"Peter."

Andrew and Grace immediately gathered around. "Is that Peter?"

Evelyn put the call on speaker.

Peter's calm voice filled the room. "My mom's place is all settled. Aunt Grace, do you need me to come over?"
###Chapter 195: A Reliable Shoulder to Lean On

Grace Anderson's hand trembled as she clutched her phone, her voice laced with panic. "Peter, please come quickly. The movers are demanding an outrageous fee..."

"Don't worry, Grace. I'm already downstairs."

The moment she hung up, Grace exhaled in relief and squeezed Evelyn's hand. "Thank goodness. Peter's on his way."

Andrew Anderson stood guard at the doorway, eyeing the movers with suspicion.

The elevator dinged. Peter Harrison strode out, his tall frame accentuated by a tailored navy suit.

"Grace, what's going on?"

She rushed to him like a lifeline. "They're demanding an extra thousand for 'inconvenience fees'..."

Peter's gaze turned icy as he scanned the workers. "A thousand?"

The lead mover shrank back. "W-we had to travel far..."

"I know Elephant Moving's standard rates." Peter pulled out his phone. "Shall I call your headquarters to confirm?"

The man paled. "N-no need! Let's talk this out..."

Andrew squared his shoulders. "Not so tough now, huh?"

Evelyn gently tugged her father's sleeve.

Peter's voice was steel. "Leave now, and we'll forget this happened."

The movers exchanged glances before gathering their tools in defeat.

Grace collapsed onto the couch, her face ashen. "That was terrifying..."

Evelyn handed her a glass of water. "Mom, drink this."

Grace clung to her daughter's hand, still shaking. "Evelyn, I know you're capable, but these situations...sometimes you need a man's presence to handle them."

Peter knelt beside her, his tone gentle. "Grace, call me anytime you need help."

Andrew clapped Peter's shoulder. "We owe you one today."

Sunlight streamed through the window, painting warm patches on the floor. As Evelyn studied Peter's profile, she realized—for the first time—how comforting it felt to have someone dependable by her side.
###Chapter 196: Take It Slow

Andrew Anderson's brows furrowed tightly, his voice laced with lingering fear. "I'd already made up my mind earlier—I'd stall them while you took your sister and ran. Your mother and I are older, it doesn’t matter as much for us. But you two girls..." His fists clenched, knuckles turning white. "The way those men were looking at you—I wanted to gouge their eyes out!"

Evelyn Carter pressed her lips together, silent.

The workers hadn’t said a word, but their leering gazes slithered over her like snakes.

Peter Harrison stepped in smoothly. "Uncle Andrew, Aunt Grace, it’s too late to call a moving company now. Pack the essentials first—I’ll drive you over. We can arrange for the rest to be moved tomorrow."

Grace Anderson nodded repeatedly. "Peter, we’re troubling you again. These past few days have been..."

"Don’t mention it," Peter replied with a warm smile. "My mom said to just treat me like an extra son. Though..." He winked. "Maybe you could repay me with a few good meals?"

"Of course! Come over for dinner every day after we move in. Bring your mother too—her cooking hasn’t improved in decades."

Peter chuckled in agreement. "I’ll go get the car then."

Evelyn packed toiletries into boxes, filling three large ones quickly.

The old apartment building had no elevator, and her parents weren’t in the best health.

"Emily," she called to her sister, "help Mom and Dad downstairs."

Ever since her drunken mishap, Emily had been as meek as a quail. She immediately looped her arm through their mother’s.

Just as Evelyn rolled up her sleeves, Peter returned. He effortlessly stacked the boxes. "These are the ones?"

"The hallway light’s out," he said to Emily. "Take your parents down first."

Emily held up her phone for light, whispering to her mother, "Mom, what do you think of Peter?"

Grace watched the tall figure ahead with fondness. "He’s a good young man."

"Compared to my ex-brother-in-law?" Emily teased, wiggling her eyebrows.

Grace sighed. "Someone like Alexander Hamilton would never bother with something as trivial as moving..."

Andrew cleared his throat. "What matters is your sister’s feelings. She just got divorced..."

Emily grinned slyly. "No rush. We’ll take it slow."
###Chapter 197: Brother-in-Law

Emily Anderson claimed they should take their time, yet she practically dragged her parents along at breakneck speed.

In the blink of an eye, the trio vanished around the stairwell corner.

Evelyn Carter held up her phone flashlight, illuminating the steps for Peter Harrison.

Three heavy boxes were stacked precariously in his arms, forcing him to sidestep carefully down each stair.

"Peter, let me take one."

"No need." He dodged her outstretched hand. "You're a doctor. Your hands are important."

He stubbornly refused her help, so she focused on lighting every step, following closely behind him.

By the time they descended six flights, Peter was drenched in sweat. His white T-shirt clung to his back, soaked through.

Guilt gnawed at Evelyn, but his determination left no room for argument. When they finally stepped outside, both exhaled in relief.

"Brother-in-law!"

Emily's sudden shout made Evelyn's heart leap.

She scanned the area—no sign of Alexander Hamilton.

Instead, Emily was grinning mischievously at Peter.

The unexpected title made Peter frown. "Don't call me that."

Emily bounced over, whispering conspiratorially, "Consider this my thanks for saving me multiple times. I'll help you out."

"Don't be ridiculous."

"Mom and Dad aren't objecting." She jerked her chin toward their parents.

Peter flexed his wrists, glancing sidelong at Evelyn. "Kids shouldn't meddle in adult matters."

When Peter drove them to their newly rented apartment, Auntie Lucy was already waiting at the door.

During the ride, Evelyn received a call from the hospital director urging her to return to work.

"Summer peak season. We're critically understaffed."

The OB-GYN department faced two types of summer rushes: planned deliveries and students seeking terminations.

Teenagers caught up in passion rarely considered consequences.

After settling her parents in, Evelyn prepared to leave. "Mom, Dad, I need to get ready for work tomorrow."

Her parents nodded understandingly. "Go ahead. Don't let work suffer."

Emily swiftly shoved Peter out the door too. "Peter can drive you back—"

The door slammed shut behind them.

Peter shook his head at the closed door, amused. "Your sister recovers fast. One hangover and she's back to normal."

As the elevator ascended, Evelyn said, "She keeps saying she owes you."

"Just for picking her up that one time?"

"Not just that. The Kyle Carter situation too. If you hadn't stopped her, she might've chased him to Beijing."

Peter chuckled. "At least here in H City, she has family watching over her. But in the end, I'm just the neighbor."

He pulled something from his pocket. "This is for you."
###Chapter 198: My Choice Would Be Her

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered slightly. "What?"

Peter Harrison opened his palm to reveal a pink band-aid.

"I saw your finger bleeding downstairs."

She instinctively hid her hands behind her back, feeling the faint sting on her fingertips. She had indeed nicked her finger but had hoped no one would notice.

"Thank you."

"Evelyn, you're always so polite."

"Peter."

"Yes?"

"Do you... have feelings for me?"

His ears turned crimson instantly. His fingers tightened unconsciously around the band-aid wrapper. "I—"

"You don't?"

"No!" His voice cracked with urgency. "I do. I've liked you since college..."

The elevator's arrival chime cut him off.

Evelyn stepped in first and glanced back at him. "Aren't you coming?"

Peter snapped out of his daze and followed, moving stiffly to the farthest corner.

"If I hadn't come back, would you have never told me?"

"I..." He took a deep breath. "Your marriage happened so suddenly. I could only wish you happiness."

His voice dropped, his eyes fixed on the floor behind his glasses.

"What if I never got divorced? What would you have done?"

Peter was silent for a moment. "I would have tried to forget you. And then... married someone suitable."

"Would you have treated her well?"

"Yes." He lifted his gaze, resolute. "If I chose to marry, I would have honored that commitment."

Evelyn suddenly asked, "And if, after your marriage, I came back to you?"

Peter froze.

The elevator doors opened and closed again, but neither moved.

"I would choose her." His voice was hoarse when he finally spoke.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Even if I were the better choice?"

"It's not about who's better." His fingers clenched until they turned white. "A promise is a promise."

The early spring wind rustled through the hallway, tousling Evelyn's hair.

She studied the man before her—gentle in appearance but unexpectedly steadfast—and suddenly smiled.

"What if I rejected you?"

Peter's Adam's apple bobbed. "My answer... wouldn't change."

Evelyn turned and pressed the elevator button. As the doors opened, she murmured, "See you tomorrow, Peter."

He stood motionless, watching the doors slide shut. The band-aid in his palm was damp with sweat.
###Chapter 199: Secondhand is Fine, But Not Haunted

Evelyn's lips curved slightly as she continued walking.

Peter Harrison kept pace nervously beside her, his voice trembling. "Evelyn, I truly don't understand your thoughts. Could you give me a straight answer? Even if you're sentencing me to death, let me know why."

Evelyn stopped abruptly and met his gaze. "Peter, there are two things I must tell you first."

"Go ahead."

"First, I currently have no romantic feelings for you. To be honest, I don't even know how to love someone."

The hope in Peter's eyes dimmed visibly.

His shoulders slumped noticeably at the words "no romantic feelings."

"But I'll be honest—my parents, my sister, they all adore you. Auntie Lucy has mentioned this to me too. After much consideration, I think being with you would bring stability to my life."

The light returned to Peter's downcast eyes.

"The second matter is more important." Evelyn took a deep breath. "I've had an abortion."

Peter's eyes widened in shock. "What?"

"Not only am I divorced, but I terminated a pregnancy. Even my parents don't know this. But I felt you deserved to know before making your decision. If you can accept it, we can try dating."

Silence fell between them.

Evelyn had expected this reaction. A well-qualified bachelor like Peter could easily find an unmarried woman.

Wasn't there that saying online? Secondhand is fine, but not haunted.

Her honesty was meant to ensure transparency between them.

"If you can't accept it, that's fine. Like you said, we can remain like siblings. The elders can't force us together forever. Eventually, when one of us finds someone new, they'll let go of this idea."

Peter's Adam's apple bobbed heavily. "Evelyn, I won't lie to you. I was seriously considering marriage and children with you... So, could you give me some time to think?"

Evelyn nodded firmly. "Of course."

In the end, she didn't use the bandage he offered. She went home and used a waterproof one from her own first-aid kit.

There was still a surgery scheduled for tomorrow.

After a week's break, Evelyn returned to work.

Olivia Lightfoot was dozing at her desk when Evelyn tapped the surface lightly. "Time for rounds."

Olivia jolted awake. "Yes!"

A week's absence had brought changes to the ward. One expectant mother had delivered a healthy baby girl, while another—four months pregnant—had to terminate due to a severe medical condition.

When the latter saw Evelyn, her eyes welled up instantly. She clutched Evelyn's hand. "Dr. Carter, my baby is gone."

Evelyn had learned to comfort patients calmly. "I understand your pain. Time will heal this. Once your body recovers, you can try again. If fate allows, that child may choose you as its mother once more."

The woman broke down sobbing in her arms.

Evelyn was grateful for the waterproof bandage—ordinary ones wouldn't have survived the flood of tears.

After consoling the patient, Evelyn flipped through the charts. "How's Natalie Stapleton doing?"

Olivia's expression turned odd.

Evelyn paused. "Out with it. Did her mother-in-law really take her to Hong Kong for a gender test?"

Olivia licked her lips. "Her mother-in-law claimed our hospital wasn't professional enough. She had connections elsewhere and forced Natalie to transfer."

"The director approved this?"

Olivia shrugged helplessly. "What choice did he have? Simon Stapleton sided with his mother. If the director had refused, it would've meant forcing them to divorce."
###Chapter 200: Hello, Boyfriend

"Why stay married? For the New Year's reunion dinner?"

Olivia Lightfoot scoffed. "Dr. Carter, Director Zhao only has one precious daughter. Her dowry was half the hospital. If they divorce now, that scumbag Simon Stapleton would walk away with half their fortune. Natalie probably lost all feelings for him long ago, but she’s too filial to let her father’s life’s work be torn apart."

Evelyn Carter’s chest tightened.

The afternoon brought an emergency C-section.

The baby had its umbilical cord wrapped three times around its neck—a critical situation. The operating room was tense, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. Thankfully, mother and twins made it through safely.

By the time she stepped out, the city lights had long since flickered to life.

Her gaze instinctively drifted toward the parking lot before she caught herself. It had been ages since she last looked for that white Cayenne. The realization gave her pause.

The night breeze carried a chill. She pulled her coat tighter as she headed toward the alley.

Under the streetlamp stood a familiar figure.

Peter Harrison jogged over, unbuttoning his coat to pull out a steaming baked sweet potato from inside.

"From Qingyuan District. Clay-oven roasted." His nose was red from the cold. "I remember you loved these as a kid."

Qingyuan was a forty-minute drive across town.

The sweet potato had been kept warm against his chest the whole way, still hot to the touch.

He fished out a plastic spoon wrapped in cling film from his pocket. "Wanted to make sure it stayed clean."

Evelyn’s eyes burned.

"I thought about it all night," Peter said softly. "Your past doesn’t matter to me. I just want your future. I know you might not feel the same yet, but I can wait."

A memory flashed—that rainy night.

The same parking lot where Alexander Hamilton’s roses had been left forgotten at their doorstep. Those exquisite blooms were never meant for her life.

Now, cradling this sweet potato, its warmth carried the comforting familiarity of ordinary happiness.

"Let’s start over," she murmured.

Peter froze.

"Hello, boyfriend."
###Chapter 201: Secrets in the Evening Breeze

Peter Harrison couldn't suppress the smile tugging at his lips, like a child who'd stolen a spoonful of honey.

Evelyn Carter cradled the warm sweet potato in her hands, its heat seeping into her fingertips. When she turned her head, she caught Peter hastily averting his gaze. The tips of his ears flushed crimson as he fumbled to rub his cheeks.

"Does your face hurt?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"It's the wind," Peter stammered, tracing circles on his cheek with a finger.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, watching his transparent attempt at covering up.

"Really!" Peter insisted, stomping his foot in frustration. "Look how red it's gotten."

"Mm. The wind must be strong tonight." Evelyn nodded, her eyes brimming with amusement.

Peter's ears burned even brighter.

He quickened his pace to match Evelyn's stride.

"I actually drove here," he admitted, scratching his head. "Didn't want you to get tired from walking."

"Don't feel like spending more time with me?" Evelyn glanced sideways at him.

"I do!" Peter's voice shot up before he hastily lowered it. "Just worried you'd be exhausted after work..."

"A walk helps me unwind." Evelyn took a bite of sweet potato, its sweetness blooming on her tongue.

Peter's eyes lit up. "Then I'll pick you up after work every day! We can walk home together?"

"The design institute is quite far from the hospital." Evelyn chuckled.

"I'll park at the hospital, walk you home, then come back for my car." Peter said it as though it were the simplest thing.

Evelyn's heart skipped.

The commute between the design institute and the hospital spanned half the city. He already worked late into the night—now he'd be making this extra trip daily.

"Don't trouble yourself." She shook her head. "I can manage now that I live nearby."

Peter suddenly stopped walking. "Is it because... Alexander used to..."

"Don't mention him." Evelyn cut him off.

Streetlights stretched their shadows long across the pavement.

Soon they reached her apartment building.

"That was too fast..." Peter's voice carried his disappointment.

Evelyn turned to wave. "Get home safe."

"See you tomorrow?" Hope colored his tone.

"Mm."

Only then did Peter smile, his canine teeth peeking out. "Goodnight."

As the elevator doors began closing, Peter suddenly rushed forward to stop them.

"This weekend..." He panted slightly. "My friends invited me to play basketball at Hudson University. Want to come?"

Seeing her hesitation, he hurried to add, "They said to bring a plus one! Or... or we could go somewhere else, just us?"

The elevator emitted a warning beep.

"You just got back from leave—you must be tired..." Peter released the door with visible regret.

"I'm not tired." Evelyn's voice was soft.

Peter's eyes instantly sparkled like starlight. "Then I'll pick you up at noon! Sleep in."

The doors sealed shut.

From her tenth-floor window, Evelyn watched the figure lingering below, unwilling to leave. The night breeze tugged at his clothes like an eager puppy waiting for its owner.
###Chapter 202: The Warmth of Fingertips

Sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Carter awoke.

She reached for her phone out of habit. The screen lit up, revealing a message sent at four in the morning.

["What color are you wearing today?"]

Sender: Peter Harrison.

Evelyn stared at the cryptic text for a long moment before typing a reply: ["White sweater, jeans."]

The moment she sent it, her phone buzzed.

["Got it."]

Just two words, yet they brought back the memory of his flushed ears outside the hospital yesterday.

Evelyn opened her closet. Since leaving the Hamilton estate, her wardrobe had grown sparse. Her fingers hovered over the muted tones before settling on a white turtleneck sweater.

Suddenly, she understood Alexander Hamilton.

That look in his eyes when Annabelle turned back—was it the same dizzying joy of something lost and found?

The doorbell rang at noon.

Peter stood in the hallway, sunlight spilling in behind him. Evelyn's gaze landed on him—white sweater, dark jeans.

An exact match.

"You—" Her fingers curled unconsciously.

Peter's ears reddened again. He hastily pulled out a wax-paper bundle from his coat, the sweet aroma of roasted sweet potatoes filling the air.

"From that shop in Greenfield," he said, voice tight. "I queued since five."

Evelyn accepted it. The plastic spoon wrapped in cling film pressed into her palm, a faint sting.

"Thank you."

Peter's Adam's apple bobbed. He raised a hand as if to rub his neck, then froze mid-motion.

Evelyn smiled. "Relax."

The words turned him to stone.

On their way to deliver hospital documents, they maintained a careful distance. Evelyn cradled the sweet potato, steam fogging her glasses.

Then—the lightest brush against her hand.

Like the flutter of a butterfly's wings.

She glanced down.

Peter's hand hovered, fingertips trembling. He inched closer, only to retreat at the last second.

Evelyn pretended not to notice, though her lips curved.

So this was what falling felt like.

Terrifying.

And utterly inevitable.
###Chapter 203: Tangled Reunion

Evelyn Carter stood at the hospital entrance, her gaze calm as she observed Peter Harrison pacing nearby.

He walked back and forth, occasionally glancing at the hospital doors but never daring to step inside.

"I need to deliver some documents. I'll be right back," Evelyn said softly.

"Alright, I'll wait," Peter replied with a nod.

Olivia Lightfoot accepted the files with gratitude. "Dr. Carter, thank you for coming in on a weekend."

Evelyn flipped through the patient logs, tapping a few highlighted names. "These expectant mothers require special attention."

"Understood. I'll keep an eye on them."

When Evelyn stepped outside again, Peter was still waiting.

Spotting her, he immediately raised his hands and waved enthusiastically.

The corners of Evelyn's lips lifted as she quickened her pace.

"Evelyn!"

A familiar voice made her freeze.

Alexander Hamilton stood a short distance away, his intense gaze fixed on her.

"Mr. Hamilton, long time no see," Evelyn greeted politely.

His breathing was slightly uneven. "You look well."

"Yes, a few days of rest at home did me good." Her eyes flickered past him. "Is Mrs. Hamilton pregnant again? Need help with arrangements?"

Alexander's brows furrowed. "You know how things are between Annabelle and me now. Are you free today? I'd like to talk."

"Sorry, I have plans." She took a step back. "If it's urgent, we can discuss it now."

Suddenly, Alexander moved forward, reaching for her.

Evelyn instantly recoiled. "Please maintain your composure, Mr. Hamilton."

"There's a leaf in your hair." His hand hovered awkwardly midair.

She plucked the dried leaf herself and tossed it into a nearby bin. "Thanks for pointing it out."

"Those books you left at the house—"

"Keep them." She cut him off. "My promotion's been approved."

"Your clothes—"

"Dispose of them." Her tone remained steady. "I was thinking of updating my wardrobe anyway."

Alexander abruptly seized her wrist. "Evelyn, I'm done with games. I regret everything. Let's start over. I'll handle the Taylor family matters properly this time—you won't suffer again—"

"Let go!" She struggled violently.

"I won't!" His voice trembled. "Running into you today is fate. We can try again, have another child—"

"Mr. Hamilton!" Peter rushed between them. "Release her."

Evelyn quickly tugged her sleeve down over her reddened wrist.

Alexander's eyes turned icy. "This is a private matter, Mr. Harrison."

Peter stood firm. "Talk properly. Keep your hands to yourself."

"And what's your role here?" Alexander's entire demeanor turned dangerous. "Stay out of this."
###Chapter 204: Alexander, You're the Outsider Now

Alexander Hamilton reached past Peter Harrison, his hand stretching toward Evelyn Carter. Peter reacted instantly, slapping his wrist away. "Mr. Hamilton, know your boundaries."

"This is between us. Stay out of it."

"Ex-husband and ex-wife—what relationship is left?" Peter scoffed. "I heard you just got engaged. Isn't it inappropriate to harass Evelyn now?"

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "I've looked into you. Your family has been close to the Andersons for generations—you're practically her brother. I might even call you 'Peter' someday. Don’t make this awkward."

Peter raised a brow. "What are you implying? You still think—"

"I want to remarry her."

"Are you insane?" Peter stared in disbelief. "Does your fiancée know?"

Alexander's tone softened slightly. "It's complicated. Mr. Harrison, let me speak to Evelyn alone."

Evelyn stepped behind Peter. "We have nothing to discuss."

"If you're angry, fine. Let’s find somewhere quiet." Alexander reached for her. "The car is parked where it always—"

Evelyn grabbed Peter’s arm. "Let’s go, Peter."

Alexander blocked them abruptly.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn’s hand clutching Peter’s sleeve.

"Let go." His voice turned icy.

Evelyn only tightened her grip, interlacing her fingers with Peter’s.

Alexander’s pupils constricted. "Stop this. If you want revenge, pick another way. Don’t drag an innocent person into it."

"Are you threatening him?"

"A warning." Alexander stared at their joined hands. "Friends should know their limits."

"He’s my boyfriend."

Alexander laughed coldly. "At least pick a convincing lie. Gregory Wilson would’ve been more believable."

"Believe what you want."

Alexander stepped forward again. "Don’t embarrass yourselves in public—"

"Mr. Hamilton," Peter cut in, gesturing to their matching coats. "Convinced now?"

Alexander’s face darkened instantly. "Evelyn!"

She met his glare without flinching. "Alexander, take a good look. You’re the outsider now."
###Chapter 205: Introducing Her to the Boys

Stepping out of the hospital, Evelyn Carter realized she'd acted impulsively.

She could've simply handed the documents to Olivia Lightfoot on Monday. Yet here she was, making an unnecessary trip today.

And of course, she ran into the one person she didn't want to see.

Peter Harrison remained calm. "Fate has a way of bringing people together, whether we like it or not."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "He's been acting strange lately."

"Understandable." Peter chuckled. "That new woman he was with at the mall? She doesn't hold a candle to you. Men only realize what they've lost after it's gone."

"I'm sorry you got dragged into this."

"Actually, I'm glad."

"Oh?"

"If even Alexander Hamilton can't forget you, yet you chose me..." Peter turned the steering wheel. "That means I'm the better man."

Evelyn shook her head. "He just can't accept defeat."

Peter tapped his fingers lightly against the wheel.

The warmth of her small hand still lingered in his palm.

At the Hudson University basketball court, a group of young men craned their necks in anticipation.

"Peter! Over here!"

Peter waved from a distance, then leaned closer to Evelyn. "Can I hold your hand?"

She gave a soft "Mm."

His large hand enveloped hers gently, as if cradling something fragile.

Whistles erupted as they approached.

"Damn, Peter! Nice going!"

Peter's ears turned pink. "Knock it off. Let's play."

"Not so fast! Introductions first!"

Taking a deep breath, Peter announced, "This is Evelyn Carter. My girlfriend."

"Oho! So this is the legendary hair tie girl?"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow in confusion as Peter lunged at the speaker. "Shut your mouth!"

The two tumbled to the ground, laughter echoing across the court.

When Peter returned, his hair was tousled. "Don't mind them. They mean well."

"You're clearly close."

"Known them since childhood." He pointed to each in turn. "That's David, Felix, Terry, and the one eating a banana is Monkey."

Evelyn nodded politely.

It struck her then—Alexander had never introduced her to his friends.

Vincent Wilson had inserted himself into their lives, and she'd only heard of Nathan York in passing.

These boys, however, lived up to their nicknames—David was built like a wall, Felix moved like a cat, Terry spoke in slang, and Monkey was indeed munching on a banana.

Peter handed her a water bottle. "We can leave if you're uncomfortable."

Evelyn twisted the cap open. "No need. This is fun."

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting golden flecks on his eyelashes.
###Chapter 206: Reserved Seating for Loved Ones

Evelyn gave them a slight nod. "Hello."

Old Tie thumped his chest enthusiastically. "Don't be shy, sis. We're all family now. Just say the word if you need anything."

Dayu teased, "Her boyfriend's right here. Who asked you to play the hero?"

Old Tie waved him off. "You'll need someone for wedding prep or home renovations, right? Don't worry, sis. I'll use the best materials for you."

Evelyn understood—Old Tie was in the renovation business.

Peter leaned in and whispered, "He started a renovation company after graduation. Business is booming."

"I see."

"Dayu was a sports scholarship student. Now he's a PE teacher at Hudson University."

That explained why they'd chosen the Hudson U basketball court.

"Xiao Fei works at the same design institute as me. And Monkey here is the real champ—married the department beauty and just had twins last month."

"Impressive."

"Those two little ones are adorable. I'll take you to see them sometime."

"Sure."

Monkey stood up, impatient. "What's the hold-up, Peter? It'll be dark soon."

Peter hesitated, glancing at Evelyn.

She gave him a gentle push. "Go on. I'll wait over there."

The weekend basketball court buzzed with energy. The benches along the sidelines were nearly full, mostly occupied by young women—some cheering for their boyfriends, others quietly watching a particular player.

These seats had unofficially become the "reserved section for loved ones."

Peter's eyes lit up when she volunteered to sit there. "I'll go, then."

"Mm."

"Call if you need anything."

Evelyn chuckled. "What could possibly happen on a college campus? Go."

Peter smirked. "I've always been the one waiting for them. Today, it's their turn to wait for me."

The locker room was nearby, and the guys changed quickly. Soon, Peter emerged in a red jersey, his clothes bundled in his arms.

"Evelyn."

"Give them here."

As she took them, he squeezed her hand discreetly. "Put these on if you get cold."

"Okay."

Old Tie was already hollering impatiently. The guys razzed Peter for a bit before the game finally began.

Evelyn had never experienced anything like this.

Watching the figures darting across the court, she found it oddly refreshing.

Then a ponytailed girl sat beside her. "Here to watch your boyfriend play, senior?"

Evelyn smiled and nodded.

"Here, take this."

The girl thrust a megaphone into her hands without waiting for a response.
###Chapter 207: A Moment Frozen in Time

"Senior Evelyn, hold the megaphone!"

The ponytailed junior shoved the megaphone into Evelyn Carter's hands before nimbly hopping onto a spectator seat.

"Go, Captain Wang! You're the hottest!"

A tall boy on the basketball court turned at the sound, flashing a victory sign. The junior immediately formed a giant heart with her arms, drawing cheers from the crowd.

"Senior, don’t be shy! What’s your boyfriend’s name? I’ll cheer for you!"

Evelyn flustered at the sudden enthusiasm.

"I—"

"Come on, tell me!"

"Peter Harrison."

The junior’s eyes lit up. She took a deep breath and shouted into the megaphone:

"Senior Peter Harrison! Your girlfriend’s too shy to cheer, so I’ll do it for her! Don’t even think about going home without MVP today!"

The entire court erupted in good-natured laughter.

"If you don’t step up your game, I might just steal this gorgeous senior from you!"

Evelyn’s ears burned. She instinctively retreated half a step. On the court, Peter froze mid-action, only snapping out of it when his teammates nudged him.

The stunt made Evelyn the center of attention. Dressed in a beige trench coat with her dark hair cascading over her shoulders, she glowed softly in the sunlight. Passersby paused to ask which department this stunning senior belonged to.

At the halftime whistle, Peter was the first to dash to the sidelines.

Sweat dampened his tousled bangs and soaked half his T-shirt. His chest heaved with exertion.

"We’re winning." His eyes sparkled.

Evelyn pulled a tissue from her bag. "Don’t catch a cold."

"Mm."

"Wipe your sweat."

Instead of taking it, Peter leaned down slightly. "Do it for me?"

......

Outside campus, a black sedan idled silently by the curb.

Alexander Hamilton’s knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

Through the iron fence, the scene unfolded with painful clarity—Peter bending to her height, Evelyn rising on tiptoe to dab his temples with a tissue. Her unbound hair lifted in the breeze, brushing against Peter’s arm.

They’d performed this ritual countless times before.

Only back at the hospital, she’d always worn a white coat with her hair tightly secured. Now, in casual clothes with loose strands swaying, she looked softer than he’d ever seen her.

As Peter sprinted back to the court, Evelyn remained watching. Sunlight filtered through leaves, dappling her figure like a paused oil painting.

The window rolled up, but the image kept replaying behind Alexander’s eyelids. He pressed the accelerator. The rearview mirror shrank the distant figures, yet they remained etched in his memory’s deepest vault.
###Chapter 208: Why Shouldn't She Be Angry?

He never believed in such things.

Alexander knew Evelyn Carter's temperament well—she drew clear boundaries between friends and lovers, never crossing the line.

Yet he still followed her.

Perhaps he just wanted to confirm one thing—she was angry.

Angry at him for ending the pregnancy. Angry at him for betraying her trust. Angry at Annabelle Taylor's constant provocations. Of course she should be angry. Why shouldn't she be?

If she was angry, then let her vent.

Even if she found some random man to pretend to be her boyfriend just to spite him, he'd accept it.

It was just an act. Eventually, the curtain would fall. With Evelyn's personality, she'd cut ties with Peter Harrison the moment she was out of his sight.

But the scene at the hospital entrance made his heart sink.

Peter held the car door open for her, and she calmly took the passenger seat.

Beside the basketball court, the blaring megaphone grated on his nerves, but the sight before him made him clench the cigarette between his teeth.

At least it wasn't Gregory Wilson.

Dealing with the Wilson family would require consideration for old connections. But this Peter Harrison? Just an ordinary designer.

He refused to believe Evelyn's standards could plummet so low after being with him.

His phone rang again.

He glanced at it and hung up immediately.

The ringing persisted, so he silenced it and tossed the phone onto the passenger seat.

That spot used to hold Evelyn's disinfectant wipes.

A doctor's habit, unchanged for three years.

Since Annabelle's return, the wipes had disappeared.

The screen lit up once more.

Frowning, he answered. "Emily."

"Mr. Hamilton, Miss Taylor is here again."

"Same as always. Tell her I'm away on business."

"I did. She doesn't believe it. Says it's urgent."

"Have her removed," he said coldly. "Call security if she refuses to leave."

Emily hesitated. "The fallout from last time hasn't settled. Another scene could make things worse. And... well..."

"She brought someone with her."

"Who?"

"A girl," Emily lowered her voice. "She looks... like Mrs. Hamilton."

Alexander's fingers stilled.

"A medical student, third year. Her mannerisms are about sixty or seventy percent similar."

He laughed abruptly. "What does she think she's doing?"

"Miss Taylor said..." Emily struggled to continue. "She wants to introduce you. Said the girl could... bear your child."

The phone rang again.

He answered.

"Alexander..." Annabelle's voice was tentative. "I found a solution."

"Speak."

"There's a junior at the medical school, mentored by the same professor as Dr. Carter. I brought her here specially—"

"Annabelle." His voice cut like ice. "Are you running a brothel now?"

Silence swallowed the other end of the line.
###Chapter 209 Now She's Your Heart's Desire

"Alexander, your words cut like knives lately." Annabelle's voice trembled with unshed tears.

"Knives?" Alexander Hamilton scoffed. "For over twenty years, your words have been a hundred times sharper."

"I admit... I went too far after we got back together." A choked sob escaped her. "But it's because I saw how much you'd changed. After your marriage, she took up space in your heart. I just wanted to drive her out, to make you mine alone again."

"You got dumped by a foreigner, came back pregnant with a mixed-race child, and still expect me to have room only for you?"

Muffled crying filtered through the phone. "Alexander, tell me how to turn back time. This slow torture is unbearable. I can't sleep at night. Mom's terrified I'll harm myself—she won't even close her eyes. Today, my wheelchair almost tumbled down the stairs..."

"That's your mother. Not mine."

"..."

"If you truly care about Mrs. Lin, behave yourself."

Annabelle's voice shook violently. "Do you... hate me now?"

Alexander rolled down the car window, letting icy wind rush in. "Spelling it out would just send you jumping off buildings again. Some things are better left unsaid."

"After twenty years together, is there really no chance for us?"

"None."

The finality of his answer pierced her. Her tone turned shrill. "It's Dr. Carter, isn't it? You've fallen for her?"

Instantly alert, Alexander demanded, "What are you plotting against her now?"

"What can I do? Lay a finger on her, and you'd kill me."

"Murder's illegal." His voice could freeze hell. "But don't test my limits. This time, I won't spare anyone's feelings."

A chill ran down Annabelle's spine. She finally understood—the suicide card could only be played once.

"I get it. Don't worry, I won't court death again. She's your heart's desire now. You always cradle your loves in your palms. Pity I was too young to cherish it..."

"You still don't understand?" Alexander cut in with biting sarcasm.

Only strained breathing answered him.

"Dredging up the past is pointless." He massaged his temples. "Leave her alone. She's suffered enough."

"True," Annabelle suddenly cooed. "So heaven will compensate her. Vincent says his brother adores Dr. Carter. The Wilsons are well-off, and they're colleagues. Her golden days are ahead."

Exhaustion crashed over Alexander.

Every word from Annabelle was poison sugarcoated in sweetness, relentlessly reminding him: You and Evelyn are impossible.

So damn tired.

"I have things to do. Goodbye."

"Alexander!" she cried desperately. "I had Emily bring that girl to your place. I'm staying with my parents now, so you two can..." Her voice broke. "Once she's pregnant, I'll return to help. When the baby comes, I'll personally tend to her postpartum—"

His frown deepened. He ended the call and immediately dialed Emily.

"Mr. Hamilton?"

"Send her away. Take the girl too."

"Understood."

"Inform security—ban her from the company permanently."

Hanging up, he tossed his phone aside. When he looked up again, the basketball court stood empty.
###Chapter 210: The Gaze Beyond the Lens

The campus of Hudson University felt unfamiliar to Evelyn Carter.

Autumn sunlight filtered through the plane trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Peter Harrison walked beside her, their footsteps crunching softly through the thick carpet of fallen leaves.

"Want to take a photo?" Peter suddenly stopped.

Evelyn instinctively shook her head. "I'm not photogenic."

"Just one." His eyes held a hopeful glint. "We rarely come here."

A girl with a camera was watching them from a short distance away. After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn nodded.

Peter's face brightened as he hurried over to borrow the camera. When he returned, the tips of his ears were faintly pink.

"Stand closer!" the girl called from afar. "Why are you so far apart?"

Peter stiffly moved half a step nearer.

The girl jogged over and unceremoniously placed his hand on Evelyn's shoulder. "That's better!"

The shutter clicked.

In the photo, Evelyn stood bathed in golden leaves, sunlight softening her silhouette. But Peter's gaze wasn't on the camera—it lingered on her profile.

"Not bad," Evelyn remarked.

Peter leaned close, his breath brushing her hair with a hint of mint. "I meant the subject is beautiful."

Only then did Evelyn realize—he hadn't been looking at the lens at all.
###Chapter 211: I Want You to Know My Resolve

Evelyn's face flushed crimson to the tips of her ears.

"Was I too straightforward?"

"No..." She twisted her fingers together, looking down. "It's just... I've never heard words like that before. I don't know how to react."

"Then I'll practice more." Peter Harrison said earnestly. "I'll look up romantic quotes online."

"Don't!" Evelyn waved her hands in panic. "I can't handle anything too cheesy."

They shared a quiet laugh.

The tips of Peter's ears turned pink.

"Evelyn, I'm not good with pretty words." He took a deep breath. "But I've planned our future. My savings these years are enough for a down payment at Scholar's Residence. The housing fund will cover the mortgage, and my year-end bonus is perfect for renovations."

He hesitated. "It's just..."

"What is it?"

"That property sells fast. I've already reserved a unit." His voice grew softer. "The agent keeps asking for documents."

"Are we signing the contract today?"

"I want to add your name to the deed."

Evelyn froze.

"I know it's too soon." Peter's palms grew damp. "But I want you to know I'm serious."

......

Mondays at the OB-GYN department were always packed.

Evelyn worked nonstop, not even pausing to drink water. That afternoon, she took leave and rushed to Scholar's Residence.

Peter waited outside the sales office in his white coat.

"Did you bring all the documents?"

Evelyn nodded.

"Your parents didn't object?"

The mention made her head throb.

She'd intended to take things slow.

But Emily Anderson, that traitor!

During summer break, Emily had been lounging at her place watching TV. While Evelyn showered, Peter texted.

Emily's shriek nearly shattered the windows.

By the time Evelyn rushed out, photos had already been shared in the family group chat.

Her mother's calls bombarded her instantly. Her father chimed in with suggestions, making it feel like an interrogation.

Auntie Lucy was worse.

When calls went unanswered, she phoned Emily instead.

"Evelyn's giving her statement now," Emily put it on speaker. "You can listen in."

The inquisition lasted until midnight.

The next morning, her parents delivered the household register.

She escaped to the hospital for overtime, narrowly avoiding further scrutiny.

According to Emily's reports, their parents and Auntie Lucy had become inseparable lately. Auntie Lucy deliberately lost at mahjong, infuriating her regular players who vowed never to play with her again.

"Evelyn, you're so lucky." Emily sighed. "Peter's willing to add your name before marriage. If it were Kyle, not only would he refuse, he'd make me pay for renovations too."
###Chapter 212: A Calculated Move

Evelyn Carter had long left that naive first love behind.

No matter how beautiful youthful infatuation was, it couldn't withstand life's harsh realities. Mortgages, renovations, daily necessities—these were the truths of adulthood.

In high school, she'd always been drawn to that athletic figure on the basketball court. Her heart would skip a beat whenever the teacher called his name.

But so what?

Almost none of her friends had escaped the fate of first love ending in heartbreak.

Compared to Vivian Dempsey's tragic experience, her own peaceful breakup was fortunate.

And Alexander Hamilton—pining for over twenty years as the backup.

Though now, he'd finally gotten what he wanted, hadn't he?

Evelyn wasn't sure if this counted as her first love.

But she knew with certainty—her marriage to Alexander definitely wasn't.

There'd been no love when they married, and their divorce had been civil. Though briefly painful, she'd moved on quickly.

Except for the child they'd lost...

"Evelyn?" Peter Harrison's voice pulled her back to the present.

She handed him the documents. "Everything's here."

"Let's go in then."

The realtor's words hit them like a bucket of cold water.

"I'm terribly sorry, but the unit you reserved was just purchased by someone else."

Peter frowned. "I already paid the deposit."

"Headquarters has authorized triple refund. I can take you to finance now."

"This isn't about money. Who bought it?"

After hesitation, the agent pointed behind them. "That gentleman there."

Alexander approached leisurely, his tall frame accentuated by the charcoal gray suit. The black armband on his left sleeve stood out starkly.

"Evelyn."

She suppressed her fury. "What exactly are you trying to do?"

"You mentioned liking this development." He glanced around, voice mild. "It is nice—close to the hospital, good school district."

"Alexander."

"Hmm?"

"Did you plan this?"

Adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses, he admitted easily, "Yes."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "You think this is funny?"

Alexander glanced at Peter. "Mr. Harrison must have work. I'll drive Evelyn to the hospital."

"Alexander!" She shoved him hard.

He barely staggered before steadying himself. "I told you—I regret it."

"That's not my problem! We're divorced!"

"Then let's remarry."

"Have you lost your mind?!"
###Chapter 213: I Just Want Him Gone Forever

The sales office was already bustling with activity, and their argument quickly drew more onlookers.

Evelyn felt her blood run cold.

The last time she'd been publicly humiliated like this was when that woman caused a scene outside the hospital. The video had spread throughout the medical community, forcing even the hospital director to give her leave to avoid the fallout.

The medical field was small—every doctor and nurse in H City knew each other. The prying eyes and whispered gossip had felt like needles piercing her skin.

Just when the storm had finally calmed, here he was again?

"Alexander Hamilton, did you two plan this? Take turns making my life hell?"

Alexander's brow furrowed. "It's over between us."

"I made it clear—I have a boyfriend now." Evelyn clenched her fists. "Have some dignity."

"Evelyn," he said quietly, "I know it's too late for apologies. Just tell me what I can do to start over."

"Never."

"I'll wait."

Camera shutters clicked around them.

"Isn't that the doctor from last time?"
"Yeah, that's her!"

Peter Harrison quickly stepped forward, wrapping an arm around Evelyn's shoulders. "We're not buying today. Let's go."

Only when they were in the car did Evelyn slam her fist against the seat. "He's insane!"

Peter kept his hands steady on the wheel. "Don't let him get to you."

"I'm sorry you had to see that."

Peter gave a bitter smile. "Nothing funny about it."

Evelyn leaned back, closing her eyes in exhaustion.

"Honestly, I get it," Peter murmured. "Choosing between you and her? Only an idiot would pick her."

"I just want him gone forever."

Peter's hand suddenly covered hers. "There is a way to make him give up."

Evelyn jerked her hand back, nails digging into her palm.

Peter withdrew, smiling self-deprecatingly. "Too soon."

"I'm just... not ready."

"I understand."

"And about the apartment," Evelyn took a deep breath, "you're covering the down payment and mortgage. It shouldn't just be in my name. Either it's yours, or we split it."

Peter kept his eyes on the road. "Doesn't matter now. The Hamiltons intervened—we're not getting it."

"We'll find another place."

"...Okay."

Her phone buzzed.

A friend request popped up—[Ephemeral Bloom], the profile picture a white night-blooming cereus in full bloom.
###Chapter 214: Not a Pleasant Memory

"Who was that?" Peter Harrison asked, glancing sideways.

Evelyn Carter quickly declined the call. "Telemarketer."

"Real estate agent? Might as well chat. They have good intel."

"No," she tucked her phone into her bag. "Florist."

Just then, Peter's phone lit up.

He put on his Bluetooth earpiece and answered.

He barely spoke during the call, his frown deepening with each passing second.

"Understood," he finally said in a low voice. "I'll head back ASAP."

"Work emergency?" Evelyn asked.

"Yeah," he turned the steering wheel. "Had an interview scheduled this afternoon. Might be late now."

"Job change?" She sounded surprised. "Why the sudden switch?"

Peter chuckled. "Gotta plan for the future. Wedding, kids, school districts—all cost money. State jobs are stable but pay peanuts. Private sector's tougher but doubles the income."

Evelyn's heart skipped.

He'd already mapped out their future so thoroughly.

Yet she...

"Sorry."

"I should be the one apologizing," he kept his eyes on the road. "Jumping straight to marriage talk without even proposing or dating first—it's rushed. Especially after how your last relationship started. Your hesitation makes sense."

Evelyn pointed to an intersection ahead. "Drop me here. Don't miss your interview."

"But you alone—"

"I'll cab back to the hospital."

Peter checked the time and relented. "Text me when you arrive."

"Okay."

The hospital was unusually quiet that afternoon.

Olivia Lightfoot slumped over her desk, glasses askew, a thick medical journal spread before her.

"Dr. Carter!" Olivia groaned, lifting her head. "Save me..."

"Paper rejected again?"

Olivia nodded frantically.

Evelyn skimmed the paper. Their research areas overlapped, so she quickly circled several issues.

"Ugh, kill me now!" Olivia yanked at her hair. "How did you survive this, Dr. Carter? Just the paper alone is torture. Thinking about future promotions makes me wanna jump out the window!"

Evelyn's fingers stilled.

The resort. Alexander Hamilton. Annabelle Taylor.

Memories flooded back.

"Not a pleasant experience."

"Professor Wang needed glasses after writing materials—300 degrees worse!" Olivia whined. "I'm already at 700. By the time I reach your level, I'll be blind!"

"Then take a break."

Olivia suddenly snapped her book shut. "Oh! Dr. Porter's treating everyone tonight. You in?"

"She win the lottery?"

"Getting married! Bachelorette party tonight!"
###Chapter 215: Unexpected Reunion

"What?" Evelyn Carter's hand paused on the medical chart. "Dr. Porter is getting married?"

"Yeah!" Olivia Lightfoot leaned in excitedly. "It's Dr. Zhang from Anesthesiology. They've been together since college."

Evelyn blinked.

She never pried into her colleagues' personal lives. Aside from knowing Olivia was single, she had no clue about anyone else's relationship status.

"Dr. Carter, are you coming tonight?"

Evelyn pulled out her phone and texted Peter Harrison: [How was the interview?]

Peter replied instantly: [Just finished. It went okay. But I might not be able to pick you up tonight. The design institute just assigned an urgent project.]

She typed back: [No problem. Work comes first.]

"Who was that?" Olivia peeked over with playful curiosity.

Evelyn put her phone away. "Olivia, I need to ask you something."

"Shoot."

"How much do people usually give as wedding gifts?"

Olivia smacked her forehead. "Oh no, I totally forgot with all my thesis work! Let me ask around..."

At the end of their shift, Dr. Porter appeared at the office door, beaming.

"Dr. Carter, Olivia, ready to go?"

Olivia jumped up. "All set! Are we leaving now?"

"Yep. My husband booked a place, but we're short on cars. I arranged rides for you."

"No problem."

A hired car was already waiting outside the hospital.

When it pulled up to their destination, Evelyn froze.

"What's wrong, Dr. Carter?" Olivia asked.

Evelyn shook her head and stepped out.

She knew this place too well.

The lounge bar where Alexander Hamilton had held his class reunion.

Six cars arrived in total. The newlyweds drove themselves, four were hired cars, and one black sedan went straight to the parking lot.

The door opened, and Gregory Wilson stepped out.

Their eyes met. He gave a slight nod. "Dr. Carter."

His tone was as neutral as if they were mere colleagues.

It had been a long time since they'd seen each other.

More surprising was the young woman who emerged from the passenger seat, linking her arm with his. "Dr. Wilson, who's this?"

"Dr. Evelyn Carter from OB-GYN," Gregory introduced. "This is my girlfriend, Mia Tan."

Evelyn smiled politely. "Nice to meet you."

Mia beamed. "Hi, Dr. Carter!"

Gregory gave his girlfriend's hand a gentle pat. "Let's head in."

"Okay!"

Watching them walk away, Olivia muttered, "Dr. Wilson is such a catch..."

Evelyn chuckled. "They make a perfect match, don't they?"

"I just think it's a shame for you."

"Don't be silly. Let's go."

The lounge bar was already buzzing with guests.

Aside from hospital staff, there were other friends of the couple.

Only the two of them had come from OB-GYN. Dr. Porter thoughtfully approached. "Dr. Carter, there are games over there if you'd like to play."

Olivia perked up immediately. After handing over the gift envelope, she tugged Evelyn toward the billiards area.
###Chapter 216: Wanting to Know Where He Lost

"You play pool?" Evelyn Carter sounded surprised.

Olivia Lightfoot twirled her cue stick with pride. "I was the pool queen in my department during undergrad. The guys were all scared to play against me. Want to give it a try, Dr. Carter?"

"I don't know the first thing about it."

"Perfect!" Olivia shoved the cue into her hands. "You're always teaching me at the hospital. Now it's my turn to be the teacher."

Evelyn glanced back at the lively bar counter. The guests of honor were surrounded by well-wishers offering toasts. Not wanting to join the crowd, she decided to stay and learn pool from Olivia.

"Watch closely," Olivia demonstrated, positioning herself. "Left hand like this, right hand holding the cue, aim—"

Crack!

The ball dropped neatly into the pocket.

"How's that?" Olivia raised an eyebrow smugly.

"Impressive," Evelyn admitted sincerely. "Teach me, Coach Olivia."

Evelyn mimicked Olivia's stance and attempted a shot.

First try—the ball grazed the edge.

Second try—the cue slipped completely.

"Seems I have no talent for this." Evelyn set down the cue in defeat.

"Just the two of you?" A deep male voice came from behind.

"Dr. Wilson!" Olivia greeted enthusiastically.

Gregory Wilson approached the pool table, his gaze sweeping over the scattered balls. "Dr. Carter doesn't play?"

"No. Where's your girlfriend?"

"She went for drinks with Dr. Porter."

"Aren't you going to join her?"

Gregory didn't answer. He picked up a cue, bent over, and with one smooth stroke, sent a red ball straight into the pocket.

"Wow!" Olivia's eyes lit up. "Dr. Wilson, you've been holding out on us!"

"Not bad," Gregory straightened. "Care for a game?"

"How about two against one?" Olivia suggested eagerly.

Evelyn quickly waved her hands. "I'll just drag you down."

"Then we'll find one more," Gregory proposed. "Two against two."

"Should I go get your girlfriend?"

"Suit yourself."

Olivia set down her cue and went to look for someone. The area around the pool table fell quiet, leaving only the sound of cue strikes.

"Your girlfriend is very pretty," Evelyn broke the silence.

Gregory focused on his shots, sinking one ball after another. "That Peter Harrison—have you made up your mind?"

Evelyn froze. "What?"

He straightened, leisurely wiping the cue tip. "Saw him picking you up last time."

"Yeah," Evelyn replied softly.

Gregory bent over again, clearing the table in one go. "So it's decided? He's the one?"

"Still thinking."

"Which means you're unsure." His eyes met hers directly.

"He's great. It's my own hesitation."

Gregory nodded. "This time, you should be careful."

"I will."

"Can you tell me what's holding you back?"

"What?"

"I want to know where I lost."
###Chapter 218: Play One Game With Me

Evelyn Carter's gaze drifted over the noisy crowd.

Olivia Lightfoot had been gone for a while. Why wasn’t she back yet?

"Don’t wait. She’s not coming back."

Gregory Wilson leisurely took out the billiard balls one by one, arranging them neatly on the table. With practiced ease, he secured them with the triangular rack.

"Is that your girlfriend?"

"Just a minor actress."

Evelyn blinked. "That’s still impressive. Has she been in anything?"

Gregory looked up, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly. "Never mind."

"What exactly do you want to say?" Evelyn grew impatient. "Just say it."

He handed her a cue. "Play one game with me."

"I don’t know how."

"Consider it closure for me."

Suddenly, Evelyn understood.

The cue was pressed into her palm. Gregory’s voice was soft. "In architecture, newcomers struggle to break through. Your boyfriend switching jobs now isn’t the wisest move."

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine.

"Don’t worry," Gregory chuckled. "I just wanted to see who I lost to. I won’t look into him again."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the cue. "I’m sorry."

"The apology should be mine." His smile turned bitter. "You rejected me clearly. I was the one who couldn’t let go. I thought… after your divorce, there might still be a chance."

He sighed. "He had everything—timing, proximity, and your fallout with Alexander Hamilton."

Evelyn stayed silent.

"At least we’ve cleared the air." Gregory’s expression returned to normal. "We’ll still be working together in surgery. I hope we can keep our usual synergy."

"Of course."

"Then let’s play."

"I really don’t know how."

"Didn’t Olivia just teach you?"

"My eyes understand, but my hands don’t."

Gregory laughed lightly. "Then let me demonstrate again."

He leaned down, aiming smoothly. The white ball struck, sending a colored one straight into the pocket.

"Want to try?"

Evelyn was about to mimic his stance when she caught movement at the door.

Two figures stood out—one tall and composed, the other petite and delicate. The girl in a pink dress clung to the man’s arm like a doll.

"What’s wrong?" Gregory followed her gaze and smirked.

The girl glanced around curiously, timid yet clinging tightly to her companion.
###Chapter 219: I Was Never His Wife

Their proximity bordered on intimate.

Evelyn Carter turned slightly. "She must come from a wealthy family?"

Gregory Wilson chuckled. "Great minds think alike."

"Do you know her?"

"I've been abroad too long to recognize the new generation in Hudson. You could text Vincent—he'd definitely know."

"I don't have Vincent Wilson's contact."

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "Didn't you connect through Message in a Bottle?"

Her ears burned. "Your brother told you about that?"

"Too proud to admit it." His tone cooled. "Alexander Hamilton warned me to keep Vincent away from you."

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile.

"Vincent grew up idolizing him. Yet after three years of marriage, my brother still doesn't know who you are." Gregory's gaze sharpened. "The world knows Hamilton Group's CEO is married—but no one's seen his wife. Protection? More like erasure."

Her fists clenched.

"To him, I'm just a decorative title."

"A man who truly values his woman integrates her into his world." Gregory sighed. "At minimum, he'd introduce her to his inner circle."

Memories surfaced—Peter Harrison introducing her to friends weeks into dating.

Crash!

Shattering glass cut through the lounge.

A girl's shriek followed.

Simon Stapleton pulled the trembling figure against him. "I've got you," he murmured.

Gregory frowned. "Another conquest. Should we warn Natalie?"

Evelyn's phone was already snapping photos.

"Evidence first." She saved the shots swiftly. "Hopefully unnecessary—but irrefutable in court."

Gregory shielded her as she captured clearer angles.

She forwarded the sharpest images to Vivian Dempsey.

The callback was instant. "Who's this downgrade? That Sweet Lolita getup belongs in 2005!"

"Recognize her?"

"Not at all. Wait—" Vivian's voice spiked. "Simon's hunting again? Didn't he knock up the dean's daughter?"

"Still married."

"Cheating scum!" Vivian's tone turned predatory. "His targets are always loaded. She's somebody."

Evelyn hummed agreement.

"Too much contour to ID. Let me crowdsource this."
###Chapter 220: So They Knew Each Other

The moment she hung up, Evelyn Carter felt a heaviness in her chest.

Gregory Wilson handed her a glass of lemon water. "Let Vivian handle the inquiries. She has connections."

"Mm."

"How about a game while we wait?"

Her phone buzzed suddenly.

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "Vivian works fast."

"No, it's my boyfriend."

His smile froze for a split second. "Here to pick you up? Go ahead and answer."

Evelyn gave him an apologetic nod before stepping aside to take the call. "Peter?"

"I went to the hospital, but your colleagues said you're at a gathering?"

"Finished with work?"

"Just wrapped up. Thought I'd take you home. Is the party ending soon?"

"Almost."

"Send me your location."

"Okay."

She forwarded the address.

Gregory polished his cue. "Why not invite him to join? The hospital isn't far."

"He spends all day in the lab. Doubt he plays."

"Perfect chance to meet. The whole hospital knows I've been pursuing you. Better he hears it from me than through gossip."

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn agreed.

She texted Peter again, telling him to come straight in.

About ten minutes later, the lounge bar's door swung open.

Peter Harrison scanned the room, his gaze landing first on Simon Stapleton and the girl in pink.

"Simon!" He strode over with a grin.

Simon stood to greet him. "What brings you here?"

They exchanged a familiar handshake, their camaraderie unmistakable.

Gregory shot Evelyn a meaningful look. "Your boyfriend and Simon are close?"

Evelyn was equally stunned.

The four of them had been high school classmates, but Simon's character...

Gregory's expression grew scrutinizing.

Her phone rang again.

"Evelyn, I'm here. Where are you?"

"Look left."

Peter stood and finally spotted her by the pool table, waving. "There you are."

As he approached, he noticed the man beside her. "And this is?"

"Dr. Wilson from our hospital."

Peter extended a hand. "Nice to meet you, Dr. Wilson."

Gregory didn't immediately respond.

The air thickened for several seconds.

Just as Peter began retracting his hand, Gregory suddenly grasped it. "Peter Harrison."

Peter blinked. "How did you— Did Evelyn mention me?"

"In a way."

Peter naturally took Evelyn's hand. "You look familiar, Doctor."

Gregory's gaze lingered on their intertwined fingers. "My photo's on the hospital billboard."

"No wonder. Impressive for someone so young to be the face of the institution."

Gregory smirked. "Play pool?"

"I know the basics. Care for a game?"

Gregory turned to Evelyn, his lips curling in a knowing smile.

His eyes said it all: That's not what you told me earlier.
###Chapter 221: Three Men and a Showdown

The air turned icy.

Evelyn Carter's fingers tightened slightly around her glass. She hadn't seen Peter Harrison in years and had no idea if he even played billiards.

Gregory Wilson picked up a cue, running his fingers along its polished surface. "Eight-ball or snooker?"

"Your choice." Peter smiled mildly.

"So you're an expert?"

"Just a hobbyist."

The sharp crack of colliding balls broke the tension. Evelyn stood aside, her gaze darting between the two men.

This wasn't the strategic snooker she knew. Their shots were aggressive, each strike sending colored balls ricocheting into pockets with brutal precision.

When the eight-ball finally sank, Evelyn's pupils contracted.

Peter had won?

"My luck," Peter said with humble grace.

Gregory's expression hardened. "You're better."

"Another round?"

"By all means."

The rematch began, the atmosphere thickening with unspoken rivalry.

Vivian Dempsey burst in, whispering urgently, "Got the intel! The Hardys' golden girl from the east side—just turned twenty, ABC raised, studying design in New York. Been back less than two weeks."

Evelyn frowned. "Who are the Hardys?"

"Not Hamilton or Wilson tier, but above my paygrade." Vivian rolled her eyes. "Made their fortune in fashion. Rumor says they've got boutiques in Paris."

"Any siblings?"

"Don't ask." Vivian leaned closer. "Old man Hardy had four sons—three died in that plane crash. The last one fathered this princess before his car accident—"

"Fatal?"

"Worse." Vivian made an obscene gesture. "Rumor says he's... non-functional now. So this girl's the sole heir. Raised overseas, spoiled rotten."

Evelyn's lips curled.

Another sheltered heiress. Naive, wealthy—perfect prey.

"One more thing." Vivian's voice dropped. "That idiot Nathan... went to Alexander."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"The watermark—"

The Huawei logo glared incongruously from the iPhone screen. Closing her eyes, Evelyn heard Vivian's trembling whisper:

"Alexander recognized the bar. He's on his way."

The crack of billiard balls ceased abruptly.

Both men turned to stare at her.
###Chapter 222: Do You Really Need to Ask Why She's Avoiding You?

The call ended abruptly. Evelyn Carter shoved her phone into the deepest corner of her bag.

"Dr. Wilson, I need to leave now."

Only a few scattered balls remained on the pool table.

Peter Harrison crouched low, lining up his final shot.

He straightened. "In such a hurry? Wait until we finish this game?"

"My parents will worry."

"It won't take long."

Gregory Wilson intervened smoothly. "Let's continue another day. It is getting late."

Peter reluctantly set down his cue. "Next time, then."

"Sure."

Evelyn hurried toward the exit. Peter grabbed his coat and followed. "Slow down—it's dark and slippery outside..."

When Olivia Lightfoot returned, only Gregory remained.

"Dr. Wilson, where's Dr. Carter?"

"She left."

"So soon?"

"Family curfew."

Olivia forced a laugh. "Right. By the way, your girlfriend disappeared too. I looked everywhere—the bartender said she left ages ago. Why didn't she tell you?"

"Must've been an emergency."

Gregory methodically cleared the table, his cue moving with practiced precision.

Something felt off to Olivia.

"Since everyone's gone, want to play a round?"

"Later."

"Waiting for someone?"

The bar door burst open before she finished speaking.

A cold gust swept in, making Olivia shiver.

"Damn. Why is he here?"

Gregory glanced up. Alexander Hamilton stood in the doorway, his tailored suit immaculate but his tie loosened.

"Where's Evelyn?" His breathing was uneven.

Gregory smirked. "Hiding."

"Why would she hide from me?"

"Do you really need to ask?"

"..."

Alexander fell silent.

The final eight-ball sank into the pocket with a crisp click.

"Care for a game?"

"Do I look like I'm in the mood?"

"Then I'll continue."

Gregory reset the balls, taking his time with the break shot.

The cue ball arced gracefully, leaving a red ball nestled perfectly behind the black.

A flawless snooker.

"Exquisitely hidden," he murmured in admiration.

Alexander turned to Olivia. "Where did Evelyn go?"

She rolled her eyes. "Why should I tell you?"

"What will it take?"

"Nothing. Ever."

A vein pulsed at Alexander's temple, but he restrained himself.

His gaze returned to Gregory. "Where is Evelyn?"
###Chapter 223: If She's Hiding, She Doesn't Want to See You

Gregory Wilson casually polished his pool cue.

"If she's hiding, it means she doesn't want to see you. Why embarrass yourself, Mr. Hamilton?"

"You know where she is?"

"I do now. But I might not later."

He bent over, lining up his shot with precision. The cue slid smoothly through his fingers.

Before the white ball could roll far, Alexander Hamilton snatched it mid-motion.

"I just want to talk to her. To explain."

Gregory smirked. "Some explanations are like stale tea—bitter by morning."

Alexander's gaze turned glacial. "You're really going to stand in my way?"

"Beat me in a game, and I'll tell you."

"You'll keep your word?"

"Win first."

Olivia Lightfoot clenched her fists.

The match was fiercer than expected.

Alexander attacked relentlessly, pocketing balls with ruthless efficiency.

Gregory defended flawlessly, each snooker shot calculated to frustrate.

A crowd gathered.

Hospital staff whispered, eyes darting between the two men.

On the final shot, Gregory slipped.

Alexander seized the opening, clearing the table in one decisive strike.

"Where is she?"

"Gone." Gregory leisurely dismantled his cue.

"When?"

"Right before you arrived."

Alexander's grip tightened on his cue. "You stalled me on purpose."

"Obviously." Gregory's smile was unrepentant.

"You're dead."

"Going to hit me, Mr. Hamilton?" Gregory arched a brow. "With half the hospital watching?"

Alexander gritted his teeth. "She won't choose you."

"At least I don't pretend to be devoted," Gregory countered coldly, "while keeping a backup plan."

Emily Zade rushed in, whispering urgently in Alexander's ear.

His expression darkened.

"Remember this, Gregory Wilson." He turned on his heel and strode out.

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Let me guess—Annabelle Taylor's in trouble again?"
###Chapter 224: Because I Don't Love Him

The headlights of Peter Harrison's car dimmed outside Evelyn Carter's apartment in the night.

Evelyn unbuckled her seatbelt. "I'm here."

"Wait."

She turned to look at him.

Peter reached over to smooth her collar. "Was tonight's bar visit for a work gathering?"

"Yes. A colleague's engagement party."

"That Dr. Wilson..." Peter hesitated. "The way he looks at you is... different."

Evelyn answered bluntly, "He pursued me before."

"And then?"

"There is no 'then.'" Her voice remained calm. "We both know where the boundaries are."

Peter gave a bitter smile. "His qualifications far surpass mine."

"He is exceptional."

"Then why—"

"Because I don't love him."

The car fell into sudden silence.

Peter's voice was barely above a whisper. "You don't love me either."

Evelyn didn't respond.

Streetlight filtered through the window, casting fragmented shadows across his face.

She truly couldn't define her feelings for Peter. He wasn't the most dazzling presence, but he offered her the most stable life. No traces of Alexander Hamilton. No shadows of Annabelle Taylor. Her parents approved. Her younger sister was happy.

A perfect harbor.

"Go on up." Peter broke the silence. "It's late."

Evelyn nodded and stepped out of the car.

Under the streetlamp, she watched his taillights disappear around the corner.

Back home, her phone screen lit up.

That familiar WeChat name again: [Ephemeral Blossom].

12:33 AM.

Evelyn disabled the friend request function entirely.

The newest photos in her album stung her eyes—Simon Stapleton with his arm around Lora Hardy, their smiles blinding.

Suddenly, she recalled Peter's familiarity with Simon.

Did Peter know what Simon had done to Vivian Dempsey?

Why was he friends with someone like that?

Alumni ties? Or something more transactional?

A headache pulsed at her temples.

The sound of running water did nothing to wash away the doubts swirling in her mind.

###Chapter 225 I didn't sleep last night.

The morning sunlight streamed through the hospital windows.

Evelyn Carter had just stepped through the entrance when she spotted Vivian Dempsey waiting on the steps.

"You're here early?"

Dark circles shadowed Vivian's eyes. "I didn't sleep last night."

Evelyn led her into the office and handed her a glass of water.

Vivian's knuckles whitened around the cup. "I've been thinking all night. We need to deal with Simon Stapleton."

Evelyn sat across from her, listening quietly.

"He targets naive girls from wealthy families. First me, now Natalie Stapleton. Even Lora Hardy—that fresh graduate from the Hardy family—isn't safe." Vivian clenched her teeth. "If this continues, more girls will suffer."

Evelyn tapped the desk lightly. "I understand."

"Then why wait?" Vivian shot to her feet. "If we delay, that naive Hardy girl will end up like Natalie!"

"Calm down."

"How can I?" Vivian's eyes reddened. "Natalie's pregnant. If Simon succeeds again, what happens to her? That child will be tied to a monster!"

Evelyn sighed. "I've advised her many times."

"She refused?"

"Yes." Evelyn lowered her gaze. "She loves this baby."

Vivian tugged at her hair in frustration. "It's just an embryo. Is it worth it?"

"You wouldn't understand." Evelyn's voice softened. "What it feels like to be a mother."

Silence filled the office.

Vivian studied Evelyn for a long moment before speaking. "Back then, you—"

"That's in the past." Evelyn cut her off. "Right now, we need to focus on helping Natalie."

Vivian slumped back into the chair. "You're right. But what can just the two of us do?"

Evelyn lifted her head, resolve hardening her gaze. "We need someone's help."

"Who?"

"Alexander Hamilton."

Vivian blinked, then realization dawned. "Of course! Why didn't I think of him?"
###Chapter 226: A Woman's Worst Fear

Evelyn Carter explained her plan in detail to Vivian Dempsey.

Vivian's face immediately twisted in disgust at the mention of Alexander Hamilton's name, her brows furrowing so tightly they could crush a fly.

But as Evelyn laid out the entire scheme, Vivian's expression gradually softened.

"Leave it to me!" Vivian thumped her chest confidently.

"Not so fast. The key is to make Natalie Stapleton completely give up."

After work, Evelyn met Natalie at a café near the hospital.

When Natalie appeared, Evelyn barely recognized her.

Was this gaunt woman really the cherished daughter of the hospital director?

The loose maternity dress hung on Natalie's frame like a sack.

Her alarming thinness made her swollen belly appear grotesquely prominent.

Only four months pregnant, yet her stomach looked unnaturally large.

Natalie twisted her fingers nervously. "Evelyn..."

Her voice was hoarse, as if she'd cried all night.

Evelyn quickly ordered her a hot milk.

"Natalie, what happened to you?"

Natalie's eyes were hollow. "Constant fighting. I'm exhausted."

"With your mother-in-law?"

"And his entire extended family."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "Where are you living now?"

"His hometown."

"Pine Hill?"

"Further." Natalie answered mechanically. "Take an old train, then switch to an unlicensed car for over an hour through mountain roads."

Evelyn felt suffocated. "Does your father know?"

"I can't tell him." Natalie spoke numbly. "Dad's getting old. Seeing me like this would destroy him."

Her terrifying calmness resembled an empty shell devoid of soul.

"Evelyn, please don't tell my father."

"How long can you hide this?"

"As long as possible." Natalie suddenly grabbed Evelyn's hand. "Actually, I came to ask you something."

"Go ahead."

"Can you... let me and the baby go together?"

Evelyn shot up from her seat. "Are you insane?!"

Natalie's tears burst forth like a dam breaking.

In full view of strangers, she collapsed into Evelyn's arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

Evelyn knew this wasn't the place for such talk.

She quickly booked a nearby hotel room and helped Natalie into a taxi.
###Chapter 227: Better Late Than Never

The crystal chandelier in the hotel lobby cast harsh, glittering reflections.

Evelyn Carter swiftly completed the check-in process and ordered room service.

The five-star hotel's food was exorbitantly priced yet disappointingly mediocre.

But when she saw Natalie Stapleton devouring the pasta like a starving animal, her eyes burned with unshed tears.

This was the cherished daughter of Central Hospital's director!

A young woman who should have been counting calories and maintaining a strict diet.

Now reduced to this pitiful state...

After Natalie finished eating, Evelyn handed her a glass of warm water.

Steam curled from the cup as Natalie finally revealed her ordeal.

Behind Simon Stapleton's prestigious Hudson University pedigree hid a filthy truth.

He'd been expelled junior year—his permanent record stamped with the damning word "rape."

"The journalism department's golden girl..." Natalie laughed bitterly. "He didn't want her. He wanted her family's import business and political connections."

At a class reunion, Simon had taken advantage when the girl was drunk.

"He promised responsibility..." Natalie's fingers whitened around the glass. "What he really wanted was a Beijing residency permit!"

Evelyn gently covered her trembling hand.

"She went straight to the police." Natalie suddenly barked a laugh. "Ironclad evidence. Hudson kicked him out within three days."

Without a degree, Simon couldn't survive in the capital. He slunk back to his mother's hometown.

"Then he met me..." Natalie's voice dropped to a whisper.

Evelyn didn't need to hear the rest.

The same playbook. A different victim.

Pregnancy before marriage. A rushed certificate. A hasty wedding...

"Evelyn, I should have listened to you..."

"It's not too late." Evelyn's voice was steel. "The procedure can be done anytime."

Tears finally spilled down Natalie's cheeks. "But the divorce... There's a mandatory cooling-off period..."

"He made demands?"

"Everything in my name..." Natalie choked. "And half of my father's assets."

Evelyn's breath caught.

The director had nearly bankrupted himself for his daughter's dowry.

Now Simon wanted to swallow it all—even the old man's retirement fund!
###Chapter 228: Gathering Clouds

"I can't take it anymore, Evelyn..." Natalie's nails dug into her palms. "Simon threatened me. If I dare to divorce him, he'll force my father to transfer all the company shares to him."

I handed her a glass of water. "Drink this first."

"My father worked his whole life to build this company. I can't let him..." Her trembling hands clutched the cup. "But I'm living like a walking corpse every day..."

"Natalie, your father cares about you more than anything."

"That's exactly why I can't drag him into this!" She suddenly grabbed my hand. "Evelyn, please help me terminate this pregnancy. Then Simon won't have any leverage over me..."

I looked at her swollen abdomen. "Are you sure about this?"

"Those so-called prenatal vitamins were poison all along." She gave a bitter smile. "The baby's already too large for four months. It's already..."

"Alright." I cut her off. "Stay here for now. Don't answer any calls from the Stapletons."

After settling Natalie in, I went out to buy some necessities. Just as I stepped out of the hotel, Peter's call came through.

"Sorry, something came up last minute." His voice carried genuine apology.

"It's fine. I'm out running errands anyway."

"Where are you? I'll pick you up."

I hesitated. "No need. I can get back myself."

"I promised to drive you home every day." He insisted. "Send me your location."

As I hung up, an unwelcome memory surfaced—Peter clinking glasses with Simon that night.

My fingers hovered over the screen before I finally sent a pin from the next block over.

Ten minutes later, his car pulled up beside me.

"Why meet here?" He glanced around. "There's not even a coffee shop nearby."

"A friend works in the area."

"Which friend?" He smiled. "I've introduced you to all my childhood buddies. When do I get to meet your girlfriends?"

My hands paused on the seatbelt. "Vivian Dempsey. You've met her before."

"Vivian Dempsey?" He frowned in thought. "Doesn't ring a bell."

The seatbelt clicked into place. My heart sank with it.
###Chapter 229: Is That Alexander?

Peter Harrison turned to her. "You look pale. Did I say something wrong?"

Evelyn Carter leaned back against the seat and closed her eyes. "No. Just a long day of surgeries. I'm tired."

"Rest for a bit. I'll wake you when we arrive."

"Peter."

"Hmm?"

"Is your company hosting an event soon?"

He chuckled softly. "I was just about to tell you. The project succeeded, so the boss arranged a celebration at Crown KTV. Spouses are invited." He paused. "I'd like you to meet my colleagues."

Her fingers twitched. "Oh."

"You seem off today."

"Will there... be drinking?"

"It's a celebration. Hard to avoid. You don't drink?"

"I can handle a little, but I get drunk easily."

Peter squeezed her hand with a smile. "Don't worry. I'll be there."

Evelyn turned to watch the rain streaking the window. "Okay."

"Should I pick you up on Saturday?"

"I might be on duty. There are a lot of high-risk pregnancies lately."

"Evelyn, you should—"

The car jerked to a stop.

Under the dim glow of the hospital entrance lights, Evelyn lifted her gaze. "What's wrong?"

Peter narrowed his eyes. "Is that... Alexander?"

Through the downpour, a solitary figure stood in the parking lot. Rain dripped from his hair, the cigarette between his fingers long extinguished.

A passing security guard shook his head.
"He comes every day."
"Waits for hours without calling. Pathetic."

Her phone buzzed.

Vivian Dempsey's voice came through clearly. "Evelyn, Alexander agreed. He asked about your schedule—I told him you either leave at dawn or pull all-nighters. Let him guess."

The car fell dead silent.

In her periphery, Peter stared at the figure in the rain, his lips curving into an unfamiliar smile. His fingers tapped lightly against the steering wheel, his eyes glinting with something dark.
###Chapter 230: The Choice in the Storm

Raindrops hammered against the car window in a relentless rhythm.

Peter Harrison's profile flickered under the neon lights, as if split between two worlds.

Evelyn Carter clenched the seatbelt, her knuckles turning white.

A sharp honk shattered the silence.

She looked up abruptly, meeting Peter's apologetic gaze. "Sorry, my hand slipped."

The window shuddered under insistent knocking.

Alexander Hamilton stood drenched in the rain, water dripping from his hair. His voice was hoarse. "Evelyn!"

Rain slid down his chin, indistinguishable from tears.

"Drive," Evelyn said, her voice colder than the downpour.

Peter pressed the accelerator, the car inching forward.

Alexander sprinted after them, dress shoes splashing through puddles. "Just five minutes!"

Evelyn closed her eyes, lashes trembling.

"He's still chasing," Peter murmured.

"Keep going."

The tires cut through the flooded road with unnatural clarity.

In the rearview mirror, his figure shrank until it vanished into the curtain of rain.

Inside the elevator, Evelyn watched the numbers climb.

Her phone buzzed with an unknown message:
["I'll handle everything."]

She deleted it instantly, as if erasing a memory.

The key turned in the lock with crisp finality.

When the door shut, the storm outside ceased to exist.
###Chapter 231: A Lousy Husband But Efficient Doer

At 5 AM, dawn was just breaking.

Evelyn Carter stood at the hotel entrance, the morning breeze cool against her skin.

Natalie Stapleton looked alert but sported dark circles under her eyes. "Evelyn, I was too excited to sleep last night."

"Eat something first." Evelyn pushed a steaming breakfast toward her.

After settling Natalie, she headed straight to the hospital.

Back in her office after rounds, her phone buzzed.

A text from Vivian Dempsey popped up: Alexander works fast.

Below it was a news link: Oceanic Group's Second Daughter Lora Hardy Appointed as Business Division Director.

The call connected as soon as she dialed. Vivian's excited voice blared: "Finally!"

"Just saw the news."

"Pfft—Alexander may suck as a husband, but his execution is flawless."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone. "Will this Lora blow our cover?"

"Relax. Oceanic Group does have a secret love child raised abroad. No one's seen her face—even the name 'Lora' might be fake."

Evelyn fell silent.

"When you asked me to contact Alexander, I was stumped. The elite circle here is tiny—faking an heiress would've been obvious. But he dug up this ready-made identity. Genius!"

"Are there other heirs?"

"An older sister, married with kids—totally uninvolved in business. Rumors say the youngest will inherit." Vivian's tone turned playful. "Coming to tonight's gala? Let's see who he cast for this role."

At dusk, a red sports car stood out conspicuously outside the hospital.

Vivian rolled down the window. "Hop in!"

Evelyn buckled up as the engine roared toward the venue.

"Speaking of which," Vivian suddenly asked, "where's your childhood sweetheart? Didn't he mention buying a marital home?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "I hope he won't disappoint me too much."

"Cheating?"

"No."

"Then why the cold shoulder?" Vivian snapped her fingers. "Wait—I competed with him in a speech contest freshman year."

Evelyn turned. "You know each other?"

"He was a senior when I was a freshman. Never noticed his crush on you though." Vivian smirked. "The guy hid it well."

Evelyn gazed at the blurring scenery. "You remember him?"
###Chapter 232: She Hoped She Was Wrong

"Of course I remember him. That guy definitely remembers me too." Vivian Dempsey smirked slyly. "He won the speech competition two years in a row, and I snatched the title from him in the third year. He was so furious he smashed the trophy on stage. Don't bring it up next time you see him, unless you want to witness his instant mood swing."

Evelyn Carter's temples throbbed.

Back then, Vivian had been so obsessed with romance she barely noticed anything else. Yet even she remembered Peter Harrison—while Peter claimed to have no memory of her?

What was even stranger was how chummy Peter seemed with Simon Stapleton.

And last night's conveniently timed car horn—luring Alexander Hamilton to witness Peter caressing her hand.

Evelyn's fingers turned cold. She desperately hoped she was overthinking things.

......

The cocktail party was held at the Pearl Hotel, owned by Hamilton Group.

Vivian pulled two paper bags from the trunk. "Quick, change into these. I picked out our battle armor."

They hurriedly swapped into their gowns in the car and strode into the venue in their heels.

"Wow," Vivian whistled. "Alexander went all out this time. The place is packed with industry heavyweights."

Evelyn never doubted Alexander's influence. Her only concern was whether Simon would even make the guest list.

Turns out, she needn't have worried.

Near the buffet stood a sharply dressed man sporting trendy comma bangs, champagne in hand as he scanned the room.

Simon Stapleton.

His eyes suddenly lit up, and he rushed toward the entrance. "Mr. Hamilton—"

Alexander looked visibly exhausted.

Bloodshot eyes. Dark circles. Even his tie was slightly askew.

He gave a perfunctory nod, then froze when his gaze landed on Evelyn.

They both stiffened at the same moment.

To make matters worse, Simon was approaching.

Evelyn yanked Vivian's arm. "Turn around!"

"What's wrong?" Vivian had been counting the attending CEOs and nearly stumbled.

"Simon's behind us."

As Vivian started to glance back, Evelyn gripped her neck. "Don't look."

Fragments of conversation drifted over.

"...Annabelle and I just happened to meet abroad. We're not close," Simon simpered.

Alexander's voice was icy. "Who invited you?"

"Opportunities are seized, not given." Simon forced a laugh. "I heard Oceanic Group's newly appointed director Lora Hardy is attending tonight?"

"And?"

"Could you introduce us? I have something that might interest her."
###Chapter 233: The Secrets in His Gaze

"Not interested."

Alexander Hamilton's voice was icy.

Simon Stapleton pressed on, "Mr. Hamilton, don't you want to see what Annabelle's Black boyfriend looks like? This is your chance for payback!"

Alexander smirked. "You just claimed to know very little about her."

"I don’t know much else, but I saw this with my own eyes." Simon lowered his voice. "I have photos. Should I send them to you now?"

Alexander studied him for a long moment. "Lora enjoys symphonies. There’s a performance at the H City Concert Hall this weekend."

Simon’s eyes lit up. "Thank you for the tip, Mr. Hamilton. I’ll send the photos right away."

Vivian Dempsey muttered under her breath, "Alexander’s playing his part well."

Evelyn Carter didn’t respond, quietly pulling Vivian into a shadowed corner.

Once Simon finished on his phone, he immediately grabbed a drink and disappeared into the crowd.

Alexander remained where he was, scanning the room until his gaze locked onto their hiding spot.

Assured Simon wasn’t watching, he gave Evelyn one last lingering look before turning away.

"Is he really giving up this time?" Vivian mused, rubbing her chin.

Evelyn took a sip of wine. "Probably."

"But the way he looked at you—"

"The outcome is the same," Evelyn cut in. "He accepted Annabelle’s marriage and child. What’s one more thing to accept now?"

At exactly nine o’clock, the guest of honor finally appeared.

A wine-red gown hugged her curves, and black stilettos clicked elegantly as she descended the staircase. Lora Hardy had a round face, large eyes, and a sweet smile.

"Know her?" Evelyn asked.

Vivian shook her head. "Never seen her before. Probably one of Alexander’s arrangements."

Evelyn recognized her instantly as Simon’s ideal type—young, naive, and from a wealthy family. Far prettier than that saccharine "Sweet Lolita" princess from the Sun family.

Lora commanded the room’s attention. As the mysterious youngest daughter of Oceanic Group, her debut had everyone buzzing.

Alexander stepped forward to greet her, their familiarity cementing her status. Guests raised their glasses in flattery, and Lora drank freely, soon swaying with intoxication.

"Have the waitresses escort Miss Lora home," Alexander instructed his driver.

Simon seized the opportunity and slipped out after her.

Vivian tensed. "She’s drunk. What if something happens?"

Evelyn’s phone buzzed with an unknown number: [Don’t worry. Bodyguards are following.]

"Alexander?" Vivian peered over.

Evelyn looked up just as his gaze met hers from across the room.

The moment their eyes locked, he quickly turned away and strode off.
###Chapter 234: The Unknown Variable

The phone screen lit up again.

["Don't delete it yet. Once this is over, the number will be deactivated."]

Evelyn locked her phone, her fingers tightening slightly.

The elegant evening gown Vivian had picked for her had no pockets. She could only clutch the device in her palm.

"So now we just wait for Simon to take the bait?" Vivian leaned in and asked.

Evelyn shook her head. "We can't afford to wait. Natalie's pregnancy is progressing every day. The risks of termination will only increase. We need to speed things up and prepare a backup plan."

......

On the weekend morning, Evelyn and Vivian arrived early at the hotel where Natalie was staying.

Away from her toxic mother-in-law and cheating husband these past few days, Natalie's complexion had visibly improved. Though still slender, her cheeks now carried a healthy flush.

"Evelyn, I've been eating and sleeping properly," Natalie said, her eyes brightening at the sight of them.

Evelyn's gaze drifted to her rounded abdomen. "Any discomfort lately?"

"None. Before, my mother-in-law kept forcing me to drink those weird folk remedies—that's when I always felt sick. These past few days have been much better."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Any movement from the Stapletons?"

"My mother-in-law called once. I told her I was visiting my parents. She's on vacation abroad—it's not like she can fly back to drag me home." Natalie smirked. "I pretended the signal was bad and hung up."

Vivian gave a thumbs-up. "Well played!"

When Natalie smiled, her eyes curved into crescents, radiating a youthful innocence.

A girl like her should have been enjoying the best years of her life, falling in sweet love. Instead, Simon had left her broken.

"Evelyn, I saw Lora in the news! Exactly Simon's type—he’ll definitely make a move."

"He hasn’t contacted you these past two days?"

"No. He thinks he has me trapped." Natalie's laugh was bitter. "He believes I won’t dare divorce him because of the baby and my father’s hospital."

"Good."

"Are we sticking to the plan and going shopping today?"

Evelyn nodded. "Everything ready?"

"Don’t worry. My father liquidated the stocks and funds he transferred to me. Everything’s in one account now." Natalie held up a number.

Vivian gasped. "Your dad gave you his life savings."

"He said he didn’t want me to suffer in that marriage." Natalie’s eyes reddened. "Simon has no conscience! He doesn’t even care about his own child!"

Vivian patted her shoulder. "When this is over, find someone ten thousand times better."

"I’m done with men." Natalie wiped her tears. "I’ll be a strong woman like Evelyn."

Vivian burst out laughing. "Your Evelyn is taken now."

Natalie’s eyes widened. "You have a boyfriend, Evelyn?"

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her voice soft. "The future is unpredictable. Let’s go—we’re running late."
###Chapter 235: Spending Like Water

Vivian Dempsey floored the accelerator as the black Mercedes weaved through traffic. Evelyn Carter sat in the backseat, gently holding Natalie Stapleton's icy fingers.

"Natalie bit her lip. "Evelyn, I've been thinking all night... Maybe we should buy gold bars? At least they hold their value."

Evelyn shook her head. "The court would classify precious metals as marital assets."

Natalie twisted her fingers together. "Then... jewelry?"

Vivian glanced at them through the rearview mirror. "Worse idea. Jewelry depreciates fast. That bastard Simon would demand half the original price."

As they passed the luxury mall, Evelyn suddenly tapped the driver's seat. "Pull over."

Vivian slammed the brakes, tires screeching.

"What's wrong?" Natalie asked blankly.

Vivian's eyes lit up. She smacked the steering wheel. "Brilliant!"

Natalie still looked confused. Evelyn explained softly, "Luxury goods. Clothes, bags, shoes—the court can't force division of consumables."

"But..." Natalie hesitated. "Spending all this money on clothes..."

Vivian was already unbuckling her seatbelt. "Silly girl, high-end brands allow returns within seven days. Once the divorce is finalized, we'll return everything."

Understanding dawned in Natalie's eyes.

"Let's go!" Vivian yanked open the car door. "Today, big sister will show you how to spend like royalty!"

The trio took the elevator straight to the top floor. Vivian strode confidently into a luxury boutique and slapped a black card on the counter. "Bring out all your new season pieces!"

Sales associates sprang into action.

Evelyn guided Natalie to the seating area. Noticing her pallor, she gently took her pulse.

"Evelyn," Natalie's voice trembled. "Will the surgery... be very dangerous for the baby?"

Evelyn didn't sugarcoat it. "All surgeries carry risks. But I'll personally oversee your full examination."

Tears splashed onto Natalie's hands. "I'll risk anything to be free of him."

Evelyn squeezed her hand firmly.

"Over here!" Vivian waved a silk scarf nearby. "This limited edition would perfect your dress!"

Natalie wiped her tears and stood with Evelyn's support. As her gaze swept over the dazzling merchandise, she finally smiled genuinely for the first time in days.
###Chapter 236: Move Aside

Evelyn Carter gently held Natalie Stapleton's wrist as they walked side by side toward the checkout counter.

Vivian Dempsey handed Natalie the shopping list. "Twenty-five items—all lingerie and undergarments. We've nearly spent the budget. Take a look."

Natalie pressed her lips together and nodded. "I trust your judgment, Vivian."

"Then let's pay."

Natalie's fingers trembled slightly as she pulled out her credit card.

Evelyn covered her hand. "Take a deep breath."

Natalie inhaled sharply and quickly signed the receipt.

"Here you go." The clerk handed over the elegantly wrapped shopping bags with both hands.

Vivian reached out to take them. "Pregnant women shouldn't carry heavy things. I'll handle it."

"Miss Dempsey, would you like us to deliver these to your car?"

"No need." Vivian suddenly remembered something. "What's the return policy?"

"Fifteen days."

A satisfied smirk curled Vivian's lips. "Good. We'll return anything that doesn't fit."

The clerk maintained a polite smile. "We're always at your service."

Once outside, Natalie hesitated. "Will returning items affect their sales performance?"

Vivian shrugged. "We can always keep one or two pieces. If you feel bad, we can compensate them privately—double their commission."

"Then could you ask for me—"

Ding—

The elevator doors slid open.

Evelyn's pupils constricted. She pulled Natalie aside. "Let's take the other way."

"Dr. Carter!"

Annabelle Taylor hurried after them, blocking their path. Though wearing light makeup, the dark circles under her eyes were unmistakable. "Could I buy you coffee? You never accepted my friend request..."

"Not interested." Vivian stepped between them. "Move."

Annabelle's voice shook. "I know I've done terrible things. I just want to apologize in person—"

"Apologies are worthless." Vivian sneered. "Stop playing the victim. Losing your baby was karma, and Grandma Hamilton haunting you in dreams is poetic justice. Keep harassing us, and I'll call Alexander Hamilton right now!"

Annabelle paled, tears spilling over. "I truly regret everything... The doctor said I can never conceive again. This is my punishment..." She suddenly grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "Dr. Carter, please—just five minutes—"

"Let go!" Vivian slapped her hand away. "Security! This woman is harassing customers!"

Annabelle staggered back, her tear-filled eyes pleading with Evelyn. "Do it... for my unborn child's soul..."

Vivian pulled out her phone. "I'm calling Alexander. Let him see how unhinged his 'Unattainable Love' has become!"
###Chapter 237: She's My Red Line

"Don't—" Annabelle clutched Vivian's sleeve desperately, her fingertips trembling. "About Grandma Hamilton... and that child of Evelyn's... He wants me dead right now. If it weren't for my parents' sake, I would've already— Miss Dempsey, please don't call him!"

Vivian shoved her away in disgust. "Then stay the hell away from Evelyn! You made your bed, now lie in it. Evelyn isn't some saint reincarnated—why should she help you? Get lost! Evelyn, Natalie, let's go—"

Annabelle froze.

"Natalie? Simon Stapleton's wife, Natalie?"

The gaunt woman before her was unrecognizable from the radiant bride at the wedding, her swollen belly the only prominent feature.

Evelyn immediately shielded Natalie. "We have nothing to discuss. Leave."

Annabelle's gaze dropped to the luxury shopping bag in Vivian's hand. "Out shopping? For Natalie?"

Vivian tensed. "None of your business."

"I'm just surprised you three are so close..."

"I buy gifts for whoever I want. Got a problem?"

"No, no," Annabelle backtracked hastily. "I just didn't expect to see Natalie here. Simon said she went back to her hometown for bed rest..."

Vivian's stomach dropped.

If Annabelle knew Simon, any leak could be disastrous—

Evelyn cut in calmly, "Natalie came for a prenatal checkup and to visit her father."

"I see. Though pregnant women should rest more." Annabelle's pointed look at Natalie's belly didn't go unnoticed.

Vivian scoffed. "With Evelyn around, your concern isn't needed. Oh, and congratulations on your engagement to Alexander. Don't invite me to the wedding—bad luck."

Evelyn tugged her arm. "Let's go."

Vivian shot Annabelle a warning glare. "Follow us and see what happens."

But Annabelle persisted. "Dr. Carter, just two minutes... Grandma Hamilton's death is driving me insane—"

Ding—

The elevator doors slid open again.

Alexander stormed out, his face darkening at the sight of Annabelle.

"Alexander..." She shrank back.

He strode past her without a glance. "Go," he told Evelyn.

She ushered Natalie into another elevator without hesitation.

As the doors closed, Alexander's suppressed roar echoed through the lobby: "What the hell are you doing here?!"

"It really was coincidence this time, I swear—"

"Annabelle, my patience has limits. She's my final red line. Touch her again and you'll regret it."

In the car, Vivian side-eyed Evelyn. "...You heard all that?"

Evelyn stared out the window. "Heard what?"

Vivian smirked but didn't press further.

Natalie gently squeezed Evelyn's hand. "You've saved me twice now. If you ever need anything..."

Evelyn returned the squeeze. "Just focus on recovering. The less complications during surgery, the biggest favor you can do me."
###Chapter 238: When Are You Going to Break Up?

After settling the asset division, Evelyn Carter immediately scheduled an abortion procedure for Natalie Stapleton.

But Natalie's physical condition was too fragile. Considering the risks, Evelyn postponed the surgery for a week.

News of Natalie's hospitalization quickly reached the hospital director.

When the elderly director rushed into the ward, he barely recognized the emaciated girl on the bed as his beloved daughter.

"Dad, I was wrong..." Natalie burst into tears before she could finish.

The sixty-year-old man's eyes reddened instantly. He stumbled forward, nearly collapsing.

Gregory Wilson swiftly steadied him.

Father and daughter embraced tightly. Natalie sobbed uncontrollably, while the director held her gently, afraid of hurting her frail body.

Olivia Lightfoot wiped her tears discreetly.

Evelyn patted her shoulder. "Let them have some privacy."

The three returned to the office, and Gregory closed the door behind them.

Olivia sniffled. "Dr. Carter, what happened to Natalie? This isn't just shedding a layer—it's like she's been skinned alive..."

Natalie never spoke of her ordeal in the Stapleton family's hometown.

But that experience must have been unbearable.

A pregnant woman fleeing the countryside alone to return to Hudson City—the hardship was unimaginable.

Even Gregory sighed. "Marrying the wrong person can ruin a lifetime."

Evelyn glanced at him, unsure if there was hidden meaning in his words.

Olivia mused, "Now I understand why people say 'marry your equal.' I used to think it was outdated, but there's wisdom in it."

"It's about the person," Gregory said, his gaze lingering on Evelyn. "Even equals can't save you from a bad match."

Olivia nodded vigorously. "Right, character matters most."

Gregory abruptly changed the subject. "When are you going to break up?"

Evelyn froze. "Our families are close. I'll let it fade naturally."

"If you see a problem, you should act decisively."

She knew he was right.

Perhaps Simon Stapleton's actions had served as a warning. Lately, Peter Harrison's behavior felt calculated and eerily familiar.

"...Maybe I'm overthinking it."

At the end of her shift, Peter was waiting at the hospital entrance.

He eagerly opened the passenger door. "Bad day?"

"Did I seem off?"

"Work stress?"

"Not really."

"In a hurry to get home?"

Evelyn met his eyes. "Did you have plans?"

Peter smiled warmly. "Remember the team-building event I mentioned? It's tonight. My boss insisted on having our VIP guest—you."
###Chapter 239: Dinner for Four

Evelyn Carter frowned slightly. "Your department's team-building event only has four people?"

Peter Harrison rested his hand gently on her shoulder, his touch firm yet unyielding. "Let's talk inside."

The car door shut behind him with a dull thud.

He walked around to the driver's seat and fastened his seatbelt. "Mr. Harrison's wife is an older first-time mother. When he heard you're an OB-GYN specialist, he arranged this dinner."

The car pulled slowly out of the parking lot.

"She could just make an appointment at the hospital," Evelyn said, watching the scenery blur past the window.

"Forty and pregnant for the first time—it's natural to be nervous." Peter adjusted the steering wheel. "Consider it an opportunity to have the boss owe you a favor."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Turning a team event into a private dinner—won't the others complain?"

"Don't worry. Mr. Harrison approved overtime pay for everyone."

The restaurant was tucked deep within a garden on the city outskirts.

Bamboo groves lined the cobblestone path, and distant figures were barely visible in the lakeside pavilion.

At the door of the largest private room, Peter suddenly paused. "Just relax. Treat it like dinner with friends."

When the door opened, Evelyn's gaze locked instantly with Alexander Hamilton's piercing eyes.

She instinctively stepped back, only for Peter to steady her with a hand at her waist.

"Mr. Harrison, Mrs. Harrison," Peter said cheerfully. "This is my fiancée, Evelyn Carter."

The heavyset Mr. Harrison stood immediately. "We've heard so much about Dr. Carter! My wife has been worried sick about irregular fetal movements lately."

Beside him, the pregnant woman struggled to rise from her seat.

Evelyn hurried forward to stop her. "Please, don't get up."

In her peripheral vision, Alexander's long fingers traced the rim of his teacup.

"I thought this was a team-building event?" Evelyn heard the tension in her own voice.

Peter pulled out a chair with a smile. "Mr. Hamilton is an investor in our new project. Since everyone was free tonight, Mr. Harrison arranged this gathering."

Under the crystal chandelier, Alexander's suit gleamed coldly.

He spoke suddenly. "Dr. Carter. It's been a while."

The air turned to ice.

Mr. Harrison looked between them in surprise. "You two know each other?"

"Ex-husband." Evelyn said the words calmly, watching Peter's smile freeze. "Peter didn't mention it?"
###Chapter 240: A Slip of the Hand

The air in the private room turned thick with tension.

Evelyn Carter could feel the scorching gaze from across the table, sharp as a blade, scraping over her skin inch by inch. She shifted slightly, avoiding the discomfort of that stare.

"Dr. Carter, take a seat," Mrs. Harrison urged warmly, her pregnant belly prominent as she pulled Evelyn by the hand. "We've been waiting for you to start."

Evelyn frowned. "But the other colleagues haven't arrived yet—"

"The younger ones don’t care for these gatherings," Mrs. Harrison cut in with a laugh. "Mr. Harrison let them do their own thing." Her grip was firm and unyielding as she guided Evelyn into her seat.

In that moment, Evelyn realized something—a pregnant woman could be both vulnerable and formidable. Just like when Annabelle had dragged her into traffic, and she’d been powerless to break free.

"Mr. Harrison, you sit here," Mrs. Harrison directed. "Let Peter take your spot. The couples should sit together."

Mr. Harrison chuckled in realization. "Right, right! Today’s like a triple date—practically Valentine’s Day!"

Clang!

Alexander Hamilton’s chopsticks slammed onto the table.

The room fell silent.

Peter Harrison, unfazed, smiled as he poured Alexander a drink. "Mr. Hamilton, a toast to you." He downed his glass in one go, turning it upside down. "To a successful partnership."

Alexander didn’t move. His dark eyes bore into Peter.

"Alexander..." Annabelle called timidly.

"What?"

"N-Nothing..."

"Then be quiet."

Mrs. Harrison, ever the peacemaker, laughed nervously. "Mr. Hamilton, be gentle with your wife."

"We’re separated."

Her smile froze. "A fight?"

Annabelle forced a laugh. "He’s just busy with work—" Her voice cracked, eyes already reddening.

"Couples fight all the time," Mr. Harrison said with an awkward chuckle. "What’s a little spat between husband and wife?"

Alexander suddenly raised his glass, but his gaze never left Evelyn. "I’d welcome a fight. At least then I’d get a chance to explain."

Peter refilled his drink and clinked his glass against Alexander’s. "Communication is key."

"Have you and Dr. Carter ever fought?" Mrs. Harrison asked, steering the conversation.

"Never." Peter smiled. "We grew up together. We know each other inside out."

"How lovely," Mrs. Harrison sighed. "Successful in both career and love."

"Evelyn prioritizes her career," Peter said, looking at her fondly. "I follow her lead."

Bang!

A glass slammed onto the table, rattling the dishes.

Alexander’s expression was icy. "My hand slipped."
###Chapter 241: I'll End You

The air in the private room turned glacial.

Alexander Hamilton's expression darkened dangerously. His chopsticks clattered onto the table, making the dishes rattle.

Mr. Harrison wiped sweat from his brow, forcing a smile. "Mr. Hamilton, about the project—"

"The board hasn't approved it yet." Alexander rose abruptly, his tailored sleeve brushing the table edge. "Wait for the notice."

Annabelle Taylor scrambled to her feet. "Alexander, where are you going?"

He strode out without a backward glance.

The door was yanked open.

A drunken man staggered inside, reeking of alcohol.

"Lao Zhang! Keep drinking!" The drunkard waved a bottle and grabbed Alexander's collar. "Stop acting so high and mighty—"

Alexander shoved him away in disgust, his brow furrowed.

Annabelle quickly pulled out a wet wipe. "Alexander, clean your—"

"Call security." His voice was icy.

Annabelle hurried out in her heels.

The drunkard fell backward, cursing as he got up. His bleary eyes locked onto Evelyn Carter.

"Hey, new girl?" He swayed toward her, leering. "Have a drink with me..."

Evelyn backed away, knocking over a chair.

"You've mistaken me for someone else," she said firmly.

Ignoring her, he reached for her face. "Don't play hard to get—"

Peter Harrison stood at the door talking to a waiter, his back turned.

Evelyn's hand groped the table, fingers closing around a cold bottle.

As she raised it—

CRASH!

The sound of shattering glass was deafening.

Blood streamed down the drunkard's head as he collapsed.

Alexander gripped the broken bottle, its jagged edge pressed to the man's throat. Murderous rage burned in his eyes.

"Looking to die?"
###Chapter 242: How Does the Lake Water Taste?

Alexander Hamilton's gaze was icy.

The jagged edge of the broken bottle pressed against the drunkard's throat, drawing a thin line of blood.

Mrs. Harrison trembled in the corner. "This is going to end in murder..."

Annabelle Taylor rushed forward to intervene, but Alexander shoved her aside.

The drunkard sobered instantly.

Terror filled his eyes as he stared at the blood on his neck, his legs shaking uncontrollably. "Please, sir... spare me..."

Alexander smirked coldly, tossed the bottle aside, and dragged the man by his collar toward the window.

"Alexander!" Annabelle collapsed to the floor, her voice trembling.

The window slammed open.

A gust of cold wind rushed in, carrying the metallic scent of the lake.

The drunkard dangled halfway out, his soul nearly leaving his body. "I was wrong! I swear!"

Alexander's grip loosened slightly.

"Ah—!"

The man's hair skimmed the water's surface.

He flailed desperately, grasping at nothing.

"Enjoying the taste?" Alexander's voice was eerily calm.

The drunkard's face was drenched, his teeth chattering. "W-what?"

Alexander let go a little more.

With a splash, the man's head plunged completely underwater.

Bubbles erupted on the surface.

Three seconds later, Alexander yanked him back up.

The drunkard coughed violently, snot and tears streaming down his face.

"I asked—does the lake taste good?"

"No! It's disgusting!" The man wailed. "Please, have mercy!"

Alexander's lips curled.

His fingers opened.

The drunkard submerged again.

This time, longer.

When he was hauled up, his eyes had rolled back.

Annabelle lunged forward, clutching Alexander's arm. "You'll go to prison!"

He shook her off. "Been there before."

"It was all for me—"

"That's why I regret it now." His gaze pinned her. "Take your parents and get out."

The drunkard hung limp as a dead fish over the windowsill.

Alexander leaned close to his ear. "If I ever see you harass anyone again, next time won't be just a drink."

He released his grip.

"SPLASH—"

The lake erupted in a violent spray.
###Chapter 243: Alexander's Outburst

Annabelle's eyes instantly reddened.

Just moments ago, she had been treated as an honored guest by Mr. Harrison and his wife, addressed as "Mrs. Hamilton." Now, Alexander had publicly reprimanded her. Her face burned with shame as she instinctively stepped back, covering her cheeks. Tears seeped between her fingers.

The restaurant manager rushed over.

He hovered at the doorway, too afraid to approach. His voice trembled. "Sir, let's talk this through. I'm the manager—please tell me how we can resolve this."

The only response was another agonized scream from the drunkard, followed by the muffled gurgling of water.

The manager wrung his hands in distress. "Sir, should we call the police? If this continues, someone could die!"

Alexander remained unmoved.

The bubbles on the water's surface gradually diminished, nearly disappearing completely.

Beads of sweat formed on the manager's forehead. "Sir, I beg you—"

"Alexander!"

Evelyn strode forward and delivered a sharp slap across his face.

The crisp sound echoed through the private dining room.

Alexander's gold-rimmed glasses sat crooked on his face, his cheek rapidly reddening.

Mr. and Mrs. Harrison gasped. Even Annabelle froze, her tears momentarily forgotten.

"Have you lost your mind? Trying to kill someone in front of all these people?" Evelyn's palm throbbed, her voice icy. "Pull him out now!"

She turned to the waitstaff. "Get some male servers over here to help!"

The manager seized the lifeline, immediately signaling several burly servers to rush forward. Together, they hauled the unconscious drunkard from the water.

The man was soaked and motionless.

"Is he... dead?"

"Oh my god..."

Annabelle clutched Alexander's sleeve in panic. "Alexander, let's go—"

He gently shook her off. "You go if you want."

"What about you?"

"Don't worry about me."

"But—"

"Enough!" Evelyn snapped.

She knelt beside the drunkard, swiftly checking his pupils before loosening his collar. Placing her hands over his chest, she began compressions.

After several pumps, the man suddenly turned his head and vomited a stream of water, coughing violently.

The tension in the room dissolved.

Mrs. Harrison pressed a hand to her chest, murmuring, "Thank goodness Peter's girlfriend is a doctor. That could've ended terribly."

Mr. Harrison's gaze flickered between the group.

He studied Evelyn performing first aid, then Alexander with his reddened cheek, before finally settling on Peter, who had remained silent throughout.

His expression shifted—first admiration, then confusion, and finally wariness.

The drunkard, now able to speak, wailed between coughs. "Murder! Call the police! Arrest him!"

Evelyn stood, wiping sweat from her brow. "If you can yell that loud, you're fine."
###Chapter 244: Must I Spell It Out for You to Leave?

The manager approached nervously. "Is this gentleman really alright?"

"He'll live," Evelyn Carter replied coldly. "But lake water is full of bacteria. Make sure he takes antibiotics."

The drunkard exploded with rage, struggling to his feet. "I'm calling the police! This is attempted murder!"

Alexander Hamilton's gaze turned glacial.

The drunkard shivered under his stare, his voice dropping to a whimper. "...At least pay for my medical bills."

"Thought you were loaded?" Alexander sneered. "A thousand bucks for the night?"

"Who I spend it on is none of your damn business! It's not like I—"

Alexander seized him by the collar, threatening to toss him out the window again.

"Help! Murder!" The drunkard clung to the window frame, terrified.

"One more word."

"I'm sorry! Please, sir, spare me—"

"Alexander!" Evelyn shoved him hard. "Have you lost your mind?"

A vein throbbed at Alexander's temple. "After what he said to you, you're defending him?"

"If you want to kill someone, do it elsewhere!" Evelyn gritted her teeth. "I refuse to be questioned by the police."

Alexander stared at her for a long moment before finally releasing the drunkard with a disgusted flick.

Removing his glasses, he noticed his hands were smeared with blood.

"Alexander!" Annabelle Taylor rushed forward with a cry. "Your hand—"

"Get out." He didn't even glance at her, grabbing tissues to wipe the blood away.

Annabelle's tears spilled over. "Nothing I do is right anymore, is it?"

Ignoring her, Alexander grabbed Evelyn's wrist and pulled her toward the exit.

Evelyn stumbled, only to be caught firmly against his chest.

"Alexander!" Annabelle's sob echoed behind them.

His grip was unyielding as he marched forward, Evelyn trapped against his side.

"Let go!" She struggled violently.

"Stop." His voice was low. "We're leaving."

Peter Harrison suddenly blocked the doorway. "Mr. Hamilton, Evelyn is my girlfriend."

Alexander's eyes narrowed. "Figured it out now?"

Peter smiled faintly, stepping aside. "Impressive tactics, Mr. Hamilton."

"Come find me when you've thought it through."

Alexander swept past with Evelyn in tow.

The dim hallway lights made it hard to see. Evelyn gasped when her foot struck the railing.

In an instant, she was lifted off her feet.

"Alexander! Put me down!"

He ignored her protests, carrying her swiftly through the corridor before shoving her into the car.

The scent of alcohol enveloped her.

Then he was on her, his kiss brutal and tinged with blood.
###Chapter 245: The Beast Unleashed

Alexander's lips crashed down on Evelyn's, stealing her breath.

His kiss was savage, like an enraged lion mauling its prey. The taut muscles beneath his tailored suit burned through the fabric, branding her skin.

"Alex—"

Her protest died in his mouth. He easily pinned her struggling hands, tearing his collar open in the struggle. The motion unleashed something primal—his dark eyes blazed with unrestrained hunger.

The seat reclined with a soft click. Evelyn sank into buttery leather, trapped beneath his weight. His assault grew more ruthless, teeth scraping her lower lip.

This wasn't the controlled Alexander she knew.

The man who epitomized aristocratic restraint now moved with feral intensity. His lips trailed fire down her throat, biting the hollow of her collarbone.

"Alexander Hamilton!" She gasped when his mouth briefly freed hers. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Lost my mind?" He braced above her, pupils dilated. "Watching you consider marrying that spineless worm—remaining sane would be the real madness!"

"We're over!"

"With him?" A derisive jerk of his chin toward the restaurant. "That coward who wouldn't even defend you?"

Evelyn's chest heaved. Peter's passive betrayal still stung, but the true terror was the unrecognizable man pinning her down.

"Not your concern!"

Alexander didn't budge. His breath scorched her ear. "He's unworthy of you."

"And you are?" Her laugh held Arctic frost. "Getting drunk to assault your ex-wife—how are you better than those barflies?"

The word "assault" struck like a physical blow.

He stilled, taking in her disheveled blouse and swollen lips. The storm in his eyes receded as trembling fingers straightened her collar. When she flinched from his touch, his hand froze midair.

"Forgive me." The apology rasped like gravel.

Evelyn scrambled upright, fumbling with buttons. Only her ragged breathing filled the car.

"Did I frighten you?" His offered help met with recoil.

"Open the door."

"It's below freezing." He scrubbed his face. "I'll go."

Winter air rushed in as he exited. The cherry of his cigarette pulsed in the darkness like a distress beacon.

"Ten minutes." His voice carried crystalline clarity now. "Hear me out, then I'll vanish from your life."

Evelyn clutched her coat collar.

One final drag. "This is goodbye."
###Chapter 246: The Stranger I Once Knew

The car door swung open violently.

Alexander Hamilton stepped out, lighting a cigarette with practiced ease.

The flickering flame cast shadows across his sharp profile in the darkness.

Evelyn Carter had never seen him smoke like this before.

The way he clenched the cigarette between his teeth was unnervingly familiar. His slender fingers held it loosely as he exhaled a plume of smoke.

The sight sent an unfamiliar tremor through her.

Was this still the same gentle Alexander she knew?

He stood with his back to her, his tall frame radiating distance.

Under the streetlight, his silhouette was edged with cold light, impatience etched between his brows.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the seatbelt.

This rough-edged man bore no resemblance to the considerate ex-husband she remembered.

His phone screen lit up.

He made a call, his voice low and clipped.

Five minutes later, he crushed the cigarette underfoot.

Sliding back into the driver’s seat, he brought with him the mingled scents of alcohol and tobacco.

The car’s air freshener was overwhelmed.

Evelyn instinctively covered her nose.

Noticing her reaction, Alexander leaned over and switched on the air circulation.

"Rolling down the window would be faster," she said.

"I don’t want to hear the noise outside." He reclined in his seat. "I just want to be alone with you."

His phone lit up again.

"That favor Vivian asked for—it’s almost done."

He opened WeChat and handed her the phone.

A live chat window displayed new messages:

[Simon Stapleton: Babe, I waited two hours to get those donuts you love.]

[Simon Stapleton: My childhood friends are having a gathering this weekend. Want to come meet them?]

[Simon Stapleton: How’s your dad’s back pain? I found a traditional medicine specialist...]

Evelyn frowned. "Is this Lora’s account?"

"Yeah. Vincent just set it up." He took the phone back. "I have the password. We can check the progress anytime."

"Who’s Lora?"

"His current girlfriend."

"He has a girlfriend?" Evelyn was stunned.

Alexander smirked. "For now."

"You two brothers are really..."

"You think Gregory is better?" he cut in abruptly.

Evelyn glared. "At least he doesn’t play with people’s feelings."

"Not playing doesn’t mean not hurting." His laugh was cold. "How many women cried over his affairs abroad?"

"That’s not the same."

"The result is still heartbreak. What’s the difference?" His gaze sharpened. "He’s just better at pretending."

"You don’t even know him."

"Do you?"

The air turned icy.

Evelyn was taken aback by his aggression.

This change was more drastic than she’d imagined.

"How much did you drink?"

His expression softened slightly. "A few glasses with Mr. Harrison. Hard to refuse those state-owned enterprise veterans at the table."
###Chapter 247: A Joint Scheme

"You begged him?" Evelyn frowned. "Wasn't it their design institute that sought cooperation first?"

Alexander leaned back in his seat, exhaustion lining his brow. "This neighborhood is employee welfare housing—collectively owned. The original company went bankrupt and urgently needs to liquidate assets. If I don't take over, other developers will only give residents three months to relocate."

Evelyn's pupils contracted slightly. "Then Mr. Harrison—"

"State-owned design institutes have faster approval processes." His fingers tapped the steering wheel. "I need speed. He wants the project. Mutual benefit."

"I don't understand much about construction."

"Leave it to me." Alexander turned his head, the warm glow of streetlights reflecting in his eyes. "The amusement park is just a preliminary idea. The priority now is relocation."

Evelyn recalled that rainy night.

The way he'd pounded on her car window.

"That day—" Alexander's lips twisted wryly. "You said you didn't want to see me."

"So you deliberately kept me here tonight to explain all this?"

"And Simon Stapleton." He shifted topics abruptly. "Lora, that film school graduate, is quite the actress."

Evelyn scoffed. "He must be thrilled to have latched onto another wealthy heiress."

"Timed the divorce perfectly?"

"Vivian told you?"

"She just said we needed a richer only daughter than the Stapletons." Alexander smirked. "Where would I find such a heiress in Hudson City?"

"What about Oceanic Group—"

"They've been notified." His gaze steadied. "This conveniently helps dispel their heir rumors too."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "At least no real person was involved."

"I'll handle the cleanup. Don't worry." Alexander suddenly leaned in, his breath brushing her ear. "Next time, come to me directly. No need for Vivian to relay messages."

Her fingers trembled slightly.

"That day at the mall, seeing your luxury shopping bags made everything click." His low chuckle vibrated through the night air. "Miss Dempsey just tossed out a 'figure it out yourself' and left."

Evelyn turned her face away. "I'll tell Natalie the truth."

"We helped her together." Alexander's voice melted into the darkness. "If she wants to thank someone, it should be both of us."
###Chapter 248: A Belated Awakening

Evelyn Carter leaned against the car window, her fingers lightly tapping the leather seat. "The dean mentored me. Helping Natalie Stapleton doesn’t require her gratitude."

Alexander Hamilton tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "I helped you."

"So you want my thanks?"

"No." He turned to look at her, his gaze intense. "I just want you to lower your guard around me."

Evelyn subtly shifted half an inch toward the door.

Alexander chuckled, though his eyes held bitterness. "I overstepped earlier. I apologize."

"Next time you have such impulses, go find Annabelle Taylor." She kept her eyes fixed ahead. "She’d be more than willing to oblige."

His expression darkened. "That’s exactly what I wanted to talk to you about today."

"I’m not interested in your love story."

"You can cover your ears." His voice remained calm. "But I’m going to say it."

Evelyn scoffed.

No matter how spacious the Rolls-Royce was, it was still a confined space. If he insisted on speaking, she’d have to jump out to avoid hearing it.

"Annabelle’s parents were my parents’ closest friends." His voice grew somber. "When my father passed, my mother was eight months pregnant."

Neon lights flickered outside, casting shifting shadows across his profile.

"Mrs. Taylor cooked for my mother every day, making sure she ate. After I was born, Mr. Taylor helped my grandmother stabilize the company."

Evelyn recalled Margaret Hamilton mentioning how Grandma Hamilton adored Alexander—he was her son’s only legacy.

"Your grandmother went through a lot back then."

"Yeah." His Adam’s apple bobbed. "She was so strong, but in the end..."

A brief silence settled in the car.

"You’ve managed Hamilton Group well," Evelyn said softly. "Your grandmother would be proud."

"But I let Annabelle rob her of her last words!" His fist slammed against the steering wheel, the horn piercing the night. "I should’ve realized sooner—back at Cloud Terrace Resort!"

Evelyn turned away. "What’s done is done."

"Which is why I can’t keep making mistakes." He looked at her, his gaze burning. "Evelyn, you might not want to hear this, but I have to say it."

Her grip tightened on her bag strap.

"These past months apart, I’ve tried convincing myself to let you go." His voice was rough. "If you were with someone else, maybe I could. But Peter Harrison..."

His words faded into the night, heavy with reluctance.
###Chapter 249: Thickening Fog

Evelyn's head snapped up, her gaze sharp as a blade. "What else do you know?"

"Don't those messages Simon sent to Lora seem familiar?"

"..."

"Doughnuts turning into baked sweet potatoes, brotherhood gatherings becoming basketball games, acupuncture sessions turning into moving days," Alexander's voice was low. "And those daily, unwavering rides to and from work. Someone as sharp as you doesn't need me to spell it out."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

She had long suspected Peter wasn't as simple as he seemed, but seeing the evidence laid bare still sent a chill down her spine.

"Lora is the heiress of Oceanic Group. I'm just an ordinary doctor. What could he possibly want from me?"

Alexander's eyes turned piercing. "He knew I'd come, yet he insisted on bringing you. Don't you see his game?"

Evelyn frowned.

"That drunk," Alexander said slowly, deliberately, "was his test. He wanted to see how I'd react to you, how far I'd go."

"He hired someone... to harass me? That man was faking it?"

"Not likely. Probably improvised—saw a drunk in the next booth and took advantage." Alexander pulled out his phone. "I already asked Emily to look into it."

So that was what the earlier call had been about.

Evelyn instinctively said, "You hit him hard. With a head wound and dirty water, infection risk is high. He needs treatment immediately."

Alexander suddenly smiled. "Evelyn, you haven't changed."

"What?"

"Always putting patients first."

"Occupational hazard." She turned away.

His voice softened unexpectedly. "I didn't understand you before."

The air in the car grew heavy.

"Are we done?" Evelyn reached for the door. "I'm leaving."

A click—the door unlocked.

She stepped out, but his hand caught her wrist.

"About Peter," Alexander's voice was tight. "Do you need help?"

Evelyn pulled free. "My parents have enough to worry about. I'll handle this my way."

"Be careful."

The wind howled, biting through her coat.

Evelyn tightened her scarf. "Mr. Hamilton, the more you focus on me, the harder he'll cling."

As she turned, she nearly collided with Emily, who hesitated, glancing between Alexander and Evelyn.

"Should I call you a cab?"

"No need."

Emily nodded. "Stay safe."

For a moment, Evelyn pitied the secretary.

Once, she'd been called "Mrs. Hamilton." Now, even titles were awkward.

The taxi pulled away.

Her phone buzzed—Natalie's name flashed on the screen. "Evelyn... I'm bleeding..."
###Chapter 250: A Doctor's Calling

The operating room lights were already on when Evelyn Carter arrived at the hospital.

Olivia Lightfoot hurried toward her, clutching a medical chart. "Natalie Stapleton is showing signs of miscarriage. The fetus has abnormal development. We need to terminate the pregnancy immediately."

This outcome was expected.

The fetus in Natalie's womb had been malformed from the start. Combined with those dubious folk remedies from the Stapleton family, survival was never a possibility.

But no one anticipated it would happen so suddenly.

Vivian Dempsey stood at the end of the hallway, her hands stained with blood, voice trembling. "Evelyn..."

"I know." Evelyn strode toward the operating room. "Go rest."

The usually fearless Vivian was pale, her fingertips still shaking slightly.

Evelyn handed her a pack of wet wipes. "Let a nurse help you clean up."

Olivia had already prepared surgical scrubs. They quickly disinfected and changed.

Inside the OR, Gregory Wilson was adjusting the anesthesia equipment.

"Low blood pressure. Significant blood loss," he said without looking up.

Evelyn checked the monitor. "Did the family sign the consent form?"

"Not yet."

Olivia stamped her foot in frustration. "That bastard Simon isn't answering his phone!"

"Keep trying." Evelyn pulled on her gloves. "We save lives first."

Gregory gripped her wrist. "No family signature means high risk."

"We can't wait."

"Simon Stapleton is the type to cause trouble afterward."

Evelyn smirked. "Let him."

"The hospital director—"

"I'm a doctor," Evelyn cut him off. "Saving lives is my duty."

The monitor emitted a shrill alarm.

Blood pressure continued to drop.

Gregory gave her a long look. "Are you sure?"

"Administer anesthesia."

"Fine."

The anesthetic flowed slowly into the IV.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the scalpel, resolve steady in her gaze.

In this moment, only the Hippocratic Oath remained in her mind.
###Chapter 251: It's All My Fault

The surgical lights flickered to life.

The air was cold, but Evelyn Carter's hands remained steady.

"Olivia, wipe my forehead."

A sterile gauze pressed gently against her temple.

"Thanks. Hemostat."

Metal clinked into her palm.

The weight felt wrong.

She looked up into a pair of strong, capable hands.

"Olivia's making a phone call," came Gregory Wilson's muffled voice behind his mask.

Evelyn suddenly remembered her assistant wasn't present.

"Dr. Carter!" Olivia burst back in, phone clutched tightly. "Mrs. Stapleton just said—"

"What?"

"If it's a girl...just dispose of it."

The scalpel stilled in Evelyn's fingers.

"And if it's a boy?"

"Save the baby..." Olivia's voice cracked. "She said Simon can sign the forms later—"

Gregory's pen scratched violently across the chart.

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Get Simon Stapleton on the phone."

"No answer. His mother says he's in some important meeting—"

Important meeting?

Evelyn's lips curled.

More likely busy entertaining Lora.

"Notify the hospital director," she said with terrifying calm. "This can't be covered up."

Fresh gauze dabbed her forehead.

Gregory murmured, "Finish the surgery first."

Four hours later.

The final suture was tied.

Evelyn's scrubs clung to her drenched back.

"Go rest." Gregory took the chart. "I'll monitor Recovery."

The hallway.

The hospital director slumped against the wall like a broken statue.

"Natalie—"

"Successful procedure." Evelyn steadied his shaking shoulders.

The older man suddenly pounded his chest. "This is all my fault!"

Olivia rushed to restrain him. "Director, please—"

"I need to see Natalie!"

"Not yet." Evelyn held firm. "Wait until she wakes."

The office door flew open.

Vivian Dempsey sprang up. "Well?"

Evelyn collapsed into a chair and shut her burning eyes.
###Chapter 252: Blood-Stained Truth

Evelyn's gaze fell on Vivian's hands. "The blood has dried."

Vivian finally noticed the crimson stains coating her fingers. She gave a bitter laugh and shook her hands. "I didn't even notice. Evelyn, you didn't see Natalie lying there in that pool of blood—unresponsive no matter how much I called her name..."

"The surgery was successful. She's stable now."

Vivian exhaled sharply. "And the baby?"

Evelyn lowered her lashes.

"Gone?"

"Yes."

"Boy or girl?" Vivian's jaw clenched. "I want to see that witch Mrs. Stapleton's face when she finds out her precious grandson is dead."

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly.

Vivian frowned. "Too small to tell?"

"I saw everything clearly."

"Then why—"

Evelyn abruptly stood and locked the office door.

Vivian's expression darkened. "What's wrong?"

"The fetus..." Evelyn forced the words out. "Had ambiguous genitalia."

"What?!"

"Mrs. Stapleton's so-called 'medicine' contained high doses of androgens. It caused abnormal development."

Vivian slammed her fist against the wall. "Monsters! Thank God that child never had to—"

The wall clock ticked past 1 AM.

Sleep wouldn't come tonight.

A sudden knock interrupted them.

Gregory stood outside. "Natalie's awake, but she needs supervision."

"I'll go!" Vivian immediately offered.

"No," Gregory shook his head. "Post-op care requires medical expertise."

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "Call a nurse."

"What about the hospital director?" she asked.

Gregory sighed. "Took one look at Natalie and fainted on the spot."

A phone buzzed sharply.

Alexander Hamilton's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello?"

"Still up?" His voice carried the thickness of alcohol.

"What do you want?"

"Simon drugged Lora tonight."

Evelyn bolted upright. "What?!"

"Relax. My team intercepted them." Alexander chuckled darkly. "Next time I'll lead with that."

"...Thank you."

"Peter Harrison is cut from the same cloth as Simon. Be careful."

"I know."

Silence stretched between them.

"I lost control today." Alexander's voice turned rough. "Seeing you with Peter, I—"

"I understand."

"Evelyn... I'm not the monster you think I am."
###Chapter 253: Redeeming Her Past Self

Evelyn's fingers turned cold as she gripped her phone. "Richard told me everyone called you 'Alex the Boss' in high school."

The line went silent except for heavy breathing.

"That's the real you, isn't it? The kindness, the gentleness—you forced yourself to become that person because Annabelle liked it. After marrying me, you kept playing that role while using me as her substitute..."

"No!" Alexander interrupted urgently. "I—"

"Enough." Evelyn's voice remained steady. "We agreed—keeping contact was only for Simon's matter. Once this ends, we go our separate ways."

Only static filled the silence.

"I'm tired. Goodnight."

Vivian stood nearby, arms crossed. "He dared to contact you? Did his precious Annabelle throw another tantrum?"

Evelyn summarized Alexander's message briefly.

Vivian slammed the table. "That bastard Simon! Trying to trap Lora with a pregnancy? I could hear his scheming from the next city over!"

"At least he only broke your heart, not your body."

"Should I thank him for showing mercy?" Vivian gritted her teeth. "Predators like him target naive girls—cheating them out of love and money! Evelyn, let's report him!"

"With what evidence?" Evelyn shook her head. "Lora's already safe. The police can't touch him."

Vivian's eyes reddened with fury. "So we let him walk free? I want to skin that scum alive!"

"First, help Natalie finalize the divorce." Evelyn grasped her trembling hand. "There'll be other chances."

Gregory interjected calmly, "Evelyn's right. The divorce takes priority now."

"I know!" Vivian scrubbed her face roughly. "I just... can't swallow this injustice."

Gregory turned to Evelyn. "You should rest. I'll stay tonight."

"Thank you."

Vivian suddenly said, "I'm staying too."

Gregory looked puzzled, but Evelyn understood.

Eighteen-year-old Vivian had been shattered by Simon, nearly ending her life. Though she pretended indifference over the years, the scar never faded.

Natalie was a mirror reflecting her most painful memories.

Back then, Evelyn had helped Vivian heal. Now Natalie only had her aging father. Vivian wanted to pull her from the darkness—to redeem the girl she once was.

The night wind bit through Evelyn's coat as she tightened it around herself.

At the curb, a familiar car waited. Peter leaned against it, smiling warmly. "Cold?"

He produced a baked sweet potato from his coat. "Eat it while it's hot." Then offered a spoon. "Brought this just for you."
###Chapter 254: Feeling Unworthy of You

The distance between two people can change irrevocably in a single moment.

Just that evening, she had been on his arm as his date at the Design Institute's year-end party.

But now, Evelyn Carter found the man before her utterly unrecognizable.

Peter Harrison still wore his camel-colored overcoat, the scarf draped casually over his shoulders, every inch the refined gentleman.

Who would have guessed that hours earlier, he had stood by and watched as a drunkard harassed her—his eyes glinting with calculation?

"Peter," she said softly.

"Hmm?" He turned, his gaze tender as he adjusted her collar. "Why aren't you dressed warmer?"

He unwound his gray-checked scarf and wrapped it gently around her neck.

The cashmere felt soft and warm, just like the perfect persona he'd carefully crafted.

"You went out for roasted sweet potatoes this late?"

He smiled. "I remember you love them. Get in the car—it's cold."

Evelyn remained rooted in place, her eyes locking onto his.

"What's wrong?" He touched his face. "Do I have something on me?"

"Nothing."

The car door opened and closed.

Peter started the engine, the wipers sweeping lightly across the windshield. "It's raining. The roads are slippery."

"Drive carefully."

He hummed in agreement, glancing at the paper bag in her hands. "Not hungry?"

"Not really."

A sigh filled the car. "About earlier... I messed up. Are you angry with me?"

Evelyn turned to face him. "Do you think I should be?"

"Mrs. Hamilton's people stopped me..." His voice trailed off. "Never mind. No excuses. I was weak—couldn't even protect my own girlfriend."

Evelyn laughed suddenly.

"What's so funny?" He chuckled along. "Did I say something ridiculous?"

"No." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "You're anything but foolish. Getting into the Design Institute without connections, earning Mr. Harrison's favor—how could you be foolish?"

Peter scratched his head. "My mom always said I only knew how to study. As for Mr. Harrison... maybe he just likes hard workers. You know how complicated things get in state-owned enterprises..."

"Right," Evelyn murmured. "Mr. Harrison has excellent judgment."

"It's all about mutual benefit." He turned the steering wheel. "I'm glad you're not upset. After all... your ex-husband is Alexander Hamilton. I've always felt... unworthy of you."

"Peter," Evelyn cut in abruptly, "can I ask you something?"
###Chapter 255: Teach Me, Evelyn

"Ask me anything. We're going to spend our lives together—I won't hide anything from you."

"What are your plans for the future?"

Peter Harrison's fingers tightened slightly on the steering wheel, his gaze flickering. "What kind of plans? I'm not sure what you mean."

Evelyn Carter chuckled. "Career plans. You can't stay an ordinary employee at the design institute forever, right?"

"Oh, that." Peter's tense shoulders visibly relaxed.

"What else did you think I meant?"

"Nothing." He cleared his throat. "My plan is to focus on the current project first. Mr. Harrison values me—he'll introduce me to bigger clients later. If the opportunity arises, I'd like to move to a more prestigious firm."

"Like Hamilton Group?"

"Of course. It's the industry benchmark—who wouldn’t want to work there?"

"Do you?"

Peter's Adam's apple bobbed. "Evelyn, why are you suddenly asking this?"

"Since the house deal fell through, we need to plan ahead." She looked out the window. "Marriage, buying a home, raising kids—none of that comes cheap."

"You're right." He nodded. "I'll work harder, aim for success sooner."

"I could actually put in a word with Alexander Hamilton—get you into Hamilton Group."

Peter slammed the brakes before quickly easing off. "No! We're divorced now. No need to owe him favors."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "True. It wouldn’t look good for you to rely on your ex-wife’s connections."

"Exactly. You’ve thought this through." He forced a laugh.

"Besides work, any other plans?"

"Not for now."

"Never thought about striking it rich overnight? No more work, straight into high society?"

Peter’s expression shifted. "Don’t joke. Even lottery winnings wouldn’t buy a decent place in H City."

"Right. People like us are destined to grind forever."

"Not necessarily." He gave her a meaningful look. "When you married Alexander, you could’ve been a carefree socialite."

"And you? If you suddenly got rich, would you still work?"

Peter burst into laughter. "Overnight fortune? Evelyn, got any leads? Teach me?"

###Chapter 256  Worried about You

Raindrops drummed against the car window like a frantic percussion beat.

Evelyn stared at the caller ID on her phone, her fingers trembling slightly.

"Grace?" Peter's voice came from the driver's seat.

"Yeah."

"Probably worried about you."

She answered the call, and her mother's voice exploded through the receiver: "Evelyn! Where are you?"

"We?"

"You and Peter! Aunt Lucy told me he took you to his company gathering. I’m not trying to interfere, but the weather forecast said there’d be heavy rain tonight—"

"We’re already on our way."

"Good. By the way, has Peter been drinking?"

Evelyn glanced at the driver's seat. Peter's sharp profile was outlined by the streetlights, his fingers firm around the steering wheel.

"No."

"That boy is always reliable." Her mother’s voice suddenly dropped. "Aunt Lucy came over for dinner today, and she kept hinting about you two..."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palm.

"Mom, I’m driving. We’ll talk later."

The call ended, leaving only the rhythmic swish of windshield wipers in the car.

Peter broke the silence. "Grace pushing for marriage?"

"Yeah."

"Funny. My mom sent me a dozen voice messages today." He gave a wry chuckle. "Said if I don’t get married soon, she’ll set me up on blind dates."

The traffic light turned red, and the car slowed to a stop.

"Actually..." Peter turned to her. "What if we just got the license first?"

Neon lights refracted through the raindrops on his glasses.

Evelyn met his gaze. "Peter, do you really want to marry me?"

Her voice was soft, but the words landed between them like a hammer.
###Chapter 257: Take Your Time, I'll Wait

"Do you really think I'm that kind of man?"

Peter Harrison's fingers tapped lightly on the steering wheel.

Evelyn Carter gazed at the scenery rushing past the window. "Just asking."

"Could it be pre-wedding jitters?" Peter chuckled. "I'm not like Alexander Hamilton. You're the only leading lady in my life."

"I need more time."

"How long?"

Evelyn turned to face him. "Are you in a hurry?"

Peter rubbed the bridge of his nose. "My bad—always too impatient. It's fine. Take all the time you need. I'll wait."

"Drop me here."

"Let me take you to your building."

"No. The surgery was long. I need to walk and clear my head."

The apartment gate stood just ahead.

Peter hit the brakes. Evelyn grabbed her bag and disappeared into the night without looking back.

In the hospital corridor, Vivian Dempsey waved at her with dark circles under her eyes.

"Did we plan this?"

"Hmm?"

"Twin pandas, huh?"

Vivian had stayed up all night with Natalie Stapleton and looked exhausted. Evelyn had tossed and turned until dawn.

Now her whole family sang Peter's praises. If they suddenly broke up...

Just imagining her parents' relentless questioning made her temples throb.

"How's Natalie?"

"Her fever won't break. The on-call doctor's meds barely helped. Still running a low-grade temp."

Evelyn skimmed the chart.

"37.8°C—we'll monitor for now. No repeat antipyretics within 24 hours. If the fever persists tonight, I'll adjust the meds."

"Your call."

A commotion erupted down the hall.

Vivian barely stood when their office door slammed open.

A tattooed bruiser blocked the entrance, flanked by Mrs. Stapleton wailing behind him.

"Curse you! My poor daughter-in-law and grandson! This butcher killed my grandchild!"

Nurses struggled against the brute's bulk.

Vivian smacked the desk. "Back from vacation, I see? Where were you when your daughter-in-law hemorrhaged yesterday?"

"Lies! I was fetching a folk remedy to save the baby!"

Mrs. Stapleton lunged at Evelyn. "One day unsupervised, and you aborted my grandson! Are you even human? Since when do OB-GYNs play God?!"
###Chapter 258: Pity, It Wasn't a Boy

Vivian Dempsey rolled up her sleeves, eyes blazing with fury. "I've had enough of you! Today you're going to get what's coming to you!"

Evelyn Carter quickly stepped between them.

Vivian stomped her foot in frustration. "Why are you stopping me? That old witch deserves it! I promise I won't kill her—just come bail me out from the police station later—"

She wrenched herself free from Evelyn's grip and lunged forward.

Mrs. Stapleton immediately collapsed to the floor, wailing and slapping her thighs. "This is an outrage! First my grandson is gone, now you're bullying me! Is there no justice left in this world?"

Vivian's eyes turned bloodshot. "Evelyn, let me go!"

"Don't be rash," Evelyn whispered urgently, wrapping both arms around her waist. "Remember why we're here."

Vivian glared at Mrs. Stapleton, hissing through clenched teeth. "Stop your pathetic act! If you cared about your daughter-in-law, you'd be at her bedside instead of putting on this show!"

Mrs. Stapleton wailed louder. "I demand to see your hospital director! Your institution is negligent with human lives—I want answers!"

Vivian scoffed. "The director? You think you're worthy? After what you did to your own daughter, you dare make demands?"

"My grandson is dead! This isn't over!"

Vivian grabbed a chair, ready to swing. Evelyn barely managed to restrain her.

"I'll give you your answer."

Everyone turned toward the frail voice. Natalie Stapleton stood in her hospital gown, supported by the director and Olivia Lightfoot.

Her face was ghostly pale, beads of sweat glistening on her forehead. Yet she bit her lip stubbornly, taking one painful step after another toward the commotion.

Evelyn rushed forward. "Natalie, you shouldn't be out of bed—"

Natalie gently squeezed her hand. "Let me handle this myself, Evelyn."

Evelyn's heart ached at her pallor. Having performed the surgery, she knew exactly how much pain Natalie was enduring.

"Olivia! Why didn't you stop her?"

Olivia shrank back, but the director spoke firmly. "I approved it. Natalie told me everything. Let her settle this her way."

As Evelyn hesitated, she felt a warm hand on her shoulder.

Gregory Wilson had appeared behind her. He gave a slight nod. "Let her go."

Natalie stopped before Mrs. Stapleton and smiled coldly. "So you came."

Mrs. Stapleton immediately clutched at her. "Natalie, my poor girl! My heart breaks for—"

Natalie shoved her away violently, sending the older woman stumbling back.

"I chose to terminate the pregnancy. Evelyn had nothing to do with it."

Mrs. Stapleton gaped. "Have you lost your mind? That was your child!"

"Yes," Natalie said, tears welling. "My child. But did you ever care?"

"Of course I cared! That was my grandson!"

Natalie enunciated each word with icy precision.

"Pity. It wasn't a grandson."
###Chapter 259: Ruining His Plans

Mrs. Stapleton's face twisted with uncertainty, her fingers clutching at her sleeves. "Impossible! I consulted so many specialists, made you drink all those gender-altering tonics—how could it be a girl? Someone must be lying to you!"

Natalie let out a bitter laugh, yanking up her hospital gown to reveal her bruised abdomen. "Look what you've done! Those drugs turned my daughter into a monster!"

Mrs. Stapleton staggered back, lips trembling. "This... this..."

"Happy now?" Natalie's eyes brimmed with tears. "Your precious grandson is neither boy nor girl—just a deformed thing! Do you think Simon would hesitate to strangle it if he knew?"

The older woman paled, lowering her voice. "Family scandals shouldn't be aired in public. Let's discuss this in the room—"

"Afraid?" Natalie sneered. "Isn't your son busy chasing the Hardy heiress? What if people found out he already has a... malformed child?"

Mrs. Stapleton's expression contorted, a glint flashing in her eyes. "Simon really...?"

"Stop pretending," Natalie scoffed. "He's been at Hardy Group every day. Didn't he tell his dear mother?"

The older woman's lips twitched upward before she forced them down, her face wrinkling like crumpled paper.

Leaning against the wall, Natalie's voice was weak but firm. "I've signed the divorce papers. Push me, and I'll call Miss Hardy right now about Simon's... unresolved marital status."

"Don't!" Mrs. Stapleton flapped her hands. "Natalie, let's talk this through—"

"Get out." Natalie turned away in disgust.

Mrs. Stapleton scurried off, her retreating figure practically vibrating with poorly concealed excitement.

Gregory wheeled a chair over, and Natalie collapsed into it with a pained laugh. "Worth it."

Evelyn stamped her foot. "Are you trying to kill yourself? What if your stitches tear?"

"Dr. Carter," Natalie blinked up at her. "Prescribe me some painkillers?"

"Dream on," Evelyn snapped.

From the shadows of the hallway, the hospital director sighed heavily. "Evelyn, Gregory—my office. Now."

The two doctors exchanged a glance before following him.

Alone in her room, Natalie stared at the ceiling, silent tears tracing down her temples.
###Chapter 260: The Hardest Debt to Repay

Evelyn sighed softly. "Natalie didn’t want you to see her like this. I promised to keep it from you."

The director's eyes instantly reddened. "Do you think my pain could compare to what my daughter has endured?" Her hands trembled as she covered her face. "I never should have let her marry Simon Stapleton..."

Gregory handed her a tissue. "Right now, Natalie’s health is what matters most. The pregnancy has been terminated. As long as she stays away from the Stapletons, she’ll recover in time."

"Thank you both." The director wiped her tears and pulled a document from her drawer. "Evelyn, I’ve been thinking. With your skills, you’ve reached the ceiling at our hospital. I’ve secured an overseas placement—submit your application before the month ends."

She turned to Gregory. "I know your family situation, but if you want to go abroad with Evelyn, I’ll support you fully."

Gregory’s gaze lingered on Evelyn. "My work is the same everywhere—healing people."

In the hallway, Gregory suddenly spoke. "Have you decided?"

Evelyn paused. "About what?"

"The overseas opportunity."

"I..." She bit her lip. "My parents are getting older, and my sister just started college..."

"I can help arrange care," Gregory said quickly. "A nurse or housekeeper—my family has connections in H City."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Dr. Wilson, favors are the hardest debts to repay."

"That’s not what I meant—"

"I’ll check on Natalie." She hurried toward the ward.

Inside the room, Vivian was handing Natalie a peeled banana. "Evelyn says these help with potassium. Eat up."

"Thanks, Vivian."

Spotting Evelyn, Vivian grinned. "Did the director give you a bonus?"

"Better than that." Evelyn pulled up a chair. "Name your craving—my treat."

"Time to go all out!" Vivian lowered her voice. "Oh, your phone rang a few times earlier."

Evelyn checked her screen. Missed calls from her sister, Emily. Then a text made her breath catch:

[Sis, Auntie Lucy brought over a whole case of cognac and tonics. Mom and Dad accepted everything! Does this mean they’re proposing?]
###Chapter 261: Confrontation Under the Streetlight

Evelyn Carter's fingers froze on her phone screen.

Peter Harrison had acted faster than she anticipated.

She needed to make a decision quickly.

Her phone vibrated again.

A new friend request popped up.

That familiar white cloud avatar was unmistakable.

[Request note: Simon's attitude toward Lora has changed abruptly. We need to talk in person.]

Evelyn tapped "Accept."

Almost instantly, Alexander Hamilton's message appeared: [Has Peter figured it out?]

[What did he say to you?]

[Simon suddenly became cold toward Lora. He met with Peter this morning.]

Evelyn rubbed her temples.

Last night's dinner had left her utterly drained.

Peter's detached demeanor throughout the meal was a stark contrast to his usual gentle attentiveness.

Even she didn't believe that flimsy excuse he gave.

What puzzled her more was that he sent his mother to propose this morning.

What game was this man playing?

[Let’s meet after work.]

Evelyn refused outright: [We can discuss it over text.]

[Some things must be said face-to-face.]

[Then have Emily Zade relay the message.]

The moment she sent it, regret flickered through her.

She still needed Alexander's help with this matter.

Irritated, she added: [Should I try to probe Peter myself?]

[Don’t.]

Another message followed immediately: [He’s more dangerous than you think.]

Evelyn raised an eyebrow: [You seem to know him well?]

Alexander sidestepped the question: [Six o’clock. Meet me at the hospital entrance.]

Just then, another notification appeared.

[Fleeting Blossom: Dr. Carter, would you join my parents and me for dinner tonight?]

Evelyn scoffed and sent a screenshot to Alexander.

[Your ex-wife is inviting me out.]

Her phone rang instantly.

"Come downstairs now."

"I'm at work!"

"Then I’ll come up."

Evelyn shot to her feet: "Where are you?"

"The parking lot. Same spot as always—under the streetlight."
###Chapter 262: Impotence

Evelyn Carter nearly threw her phone when the call ended.

Vivian Dempsey looked baffled. "We won the lawsuit. Why are you still angry?"

"Going to grab food." Evelyn snatched her coat and stormed out.

The elevator doors opened. She froze mid-step.

Alexander Hamilton stood in his usual spot, his black Cayenne gleaming coldly under the sun.

She kept her head down and hurried past.

The car door was already open. Alexander gestured for her to enter.

"Talk here," Evelyn said stiffly.

He chuckled. "Did I really scare you that much last time?"

Her eyes darted around warily.

The entire hospital knew about her history with Alexander—especially after Annabelle Taylor's dramatic scene.

"Spit it out."

"It's complicated."

"Then get to the point."

"I'm not good with words. Can't make it short."

Evelyn glared up at him. "Since when did you become so talkative?"

Where was the composed, reserved Alexander she once knew?

Now every word out of his mouth was infuriating.

"Where's Emily? Let her explain."

"She's busy."

"You're joking."

Leaning against the car, he drawled, "That drunk guy from the other night is causing trouble."

"Just pay him off."

"He claims... there are complications."

"What complications?"

Alexander suddenly leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Impotence."

Evelyn recoiled. "That's ridiculous! How could a bottle hit him there?"

"Strange, isn't it?" He shrugged. "But he won't back down."

"Use the same compensation standard as Andy Taylor's case."

Alexander's gaze sharpened. "You keep bringing her up—"

"I didn't!"

"Really?"

She turned to leave.

His hand closed around her wrist.

"Get in the car," he said, pulling her back gently but firmly.

"No."

"Front seat."

She shook her head.

"If you don't get in now," Alexander murmured, "those two nurses over there will come say hello."

Evelyn glanced sideways. Two young nurses sipping bubble tea were already staring their way.
###Chapter 263: Equivalent Exchange

Evelyn practically leaped into the car.

Alexander's low chuckle followed her, tinged with amusement.

The interior smelled of fresh citrus mingled with leather.

She stared fixedly out the window until the two nurses disappeared around the corner, her tense shoulders finally relaxing slightly.

The culprit slid gracefully into the driver's seat, moving as if filming a commercial.

Evelyn clenched her fists.

He did this on purpose!

Alexander offered her a paper bag. She ignored it.

"What is it?"

"Roasted sweet potato."

"..."

"Peter may lack character, but he has good taste in food."

Evelyn turned away. "Not hungry."

"You enjoyed it last time he gave you some," Alexander mused. "Or does the same food taste different depending on who offers it?"

She drew a sharp breath. "Stop beating around the bush. Even without your reminders, I already noticed Peter's behavior was off."

"If I hadn't been at that dinner—"

"If you hadn't been there, he never would've taken me!" Evelyn cut in. "None of it would've happened."

Alexander narrowed his eyes and nodded slowly. "You're right. He was targeting me all along."

"So could you kindly back off, Mr. Hamilton?"

The engine roared as the car pulled out.

"I let you go once. Regretted it." His gaze remained fixed ahead. "Won't happen again."

Evelyn stiffened. "I have work!"

"Don't want to help Natalie anymore?"

"...I do."

"Aren't you curious why Simon suddenly lost interest in Lora?"

"You can just tell me what you found out."

Alexander glanced at her. "Evelyn, I'll help. But I require payment."

Her spine went rigid, fingers digging into the seat.

"Relax." He chuckled. "I just want more time with you."

After the divorce, Evelyn's strategy was simple—avoidance.

Caring for her sister was the excuse; escaping him was the truth.

Time heals all wounds.

Vivian took ten years to move on, and now she's thriving.

What were her problems compared to that?

Sometimes she wondered—if Peter had been more reliable, maybe she should've married him first.

That legal barrier might've made even Alexander think twice, if only for Hamilton Group's stock price.

Too bad.

Peter was even more deceptive than Simon.

Simon's ambition was obvious, but Peter played the long game—even fooling their parents.

If she'd been any slower to realize, actually married him and bought property together...

"Penny for your thoughts?"

Evelyn snapped back to reality. "Just wondering how the busy CEO of Hamilton Group has time to chauffeur me around."
###Chapter 264: True Colors

"The roasted sweet potato shop is quite far, but if you love it, I could lease a storefront across from the hospital."

"Mr. Hamilton, are you trying to buy me with money?"

"Would money even work on you?"

"No."

Alexander chuckled softly. "I thought so. You're too clear-headed. Money won't sway you—only sincerity can."

He glanced at her. "Peter Harrison's appearance actually helped me see more of the real you."

Evelyn scoffed. "If I were truly clear-headed, I should've demanded a hefty sum during the divorce. Back then, you were in such a hurry to be with Annabelle—you'd have given me anything."

"Bringing her up again? Still claiming you don't care?"

"She nearly ruined my career. Is it wrong for me to despise her?"

Alexander surrendered gracefully. "Not at all."

The scenery outside the window blurred past.

Evelyn knew there was no point asking him to turn back now.

This version of Alexander was nothing like the gentle man he'd once been. He'd fully embraced his darker side.

"Your eloquence has improved," Evelyn remarked dryly.

The corner of his lips lifted. "Likewise."

"Where exactly are we going?"

"You've been exhausted lately. Take a nap—I'll wake you when we arrive."

"Is it far?"

"Fairly."

Evelyn unlocked her phone.

Alexander raised a brow. "Calling in sick?"

"Reporting you to the police."

He burst out laughing. "Evelyn, it suddenly feels like we had a sham marriage."

She couldn't agree more.

During their marriage, he'd been refined and cultured, while she'd played the perfect, dignified wife. Even their divorce had been impeccably civil.

But these past few days, they'd shed every pretense.

His brutality with the wine bottle, her razor-sharp retorts—both had shocked the other.

Turns out, they'd never truly known each other at all.

It had all been Grandma Hamilton's matchmaking, him seeking a substitute, and her bound by tradition.

A farce.

"Shall we consider this a fresh start?" Alexander asked.

Evelyn ignored him, dialing the hospital director instead.

"I've been overworked lately. Need half a day off."

The director agreed immediately. "You've been through so much with Natalie. Dr. Porter will cover for you this afternoon."

"Thank you."

"Don't forget to submit your overseas assignment application soon."

"Understood."

She hung up and closed her eyes.

Alexander had clearly overheard. "Going abroad?"

She didn't open her eyes. "Mhm."

"Where? For how long?"

"Interrogation, Mr. Hamilton?"

Instead of taking offense, he smiled. "Evelyn, I quite like this dynamic."

"Enjoy being insulted?"

"At least we're being authentic now. You voice your grievances directly instead of maintaining that polite distance from before."

Evelyn kept her eyes shut. "...Your idioms are improving."

Alexander chuckled softly. "Passable."
###Chapter 265: A New Bargaining Chip

Alexander Hamilton's car came to a stop in the underground parking lot of a luxury mall.

The engine cut off, plunging the interior into brief silence.

"Will Simon Stapleton show up?"

"Yes." Alexander tapped his fingers against the steering wheel. "Lora Hardy arranged the meeting."

Evelyn Carter frowned. "Wouldn't her initiative seem too obvious?"

Alexander's gaze flicked to the rearview mirror. "Simon is already suspicious. Last time at the hotel, I had someone pose as a waiter to interrupt his little scheme. The timing was too convenient—he'd have to be a fool not to question it."

"So today..."

"A mall is safer than a hotel." Alexander cut her off, his lips curling into a cold smirk.

Evelyn shook her head. "I'll never understand the twisted games you businessmen play."

The car door suddenly opened.

Alexander circled to the passenger side and pulled it open for her.

"What's wrong?"

"Let's talk inside."

The elevator took them straight to the top-floor cinema.

At the ticket counter, Alexander gestured to the digital screen. "Romance or horror?"

Evelyn shot him a frosty look.

He pulled out his wallet without hesitation. "Two for Midnight Terror, back row."

The clerk gave them a knowing glance. "Couple's combo? We have sugar-free popcorn."

"One large bucket, two Cokes."

Evelyn turned to leave.

Alexander's arm snaked around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

"Let go!"

"Don't move." His breath warmed her ear. "Look at two o'clock."

Simon Stapleton sat in the waiting area, his gaze shifting restlessly.

Evelyn stiffened. "How did he—"

"Peter Harrison tipped him off." Alexander tightened his grip. "My men were compromised."

"The plan failed?"

"No. It's an exchange."

Evelyn jerked her head up. "Peter?"

Ice flashed in Alexander's eyes. "He abandoned his pawn to secure a new bargaining chip."

"Simon?"

"Smart girl." Alexander's smile turned razor-sharp. "To save his own skin, he'd sell out his own allies. Evelyn, had your childhood friend been born into aristocracy, he'd have made a formidable warlord."

His whisper sent chills down her spine.
###Chapter 266: What Does He Really Want?

The horror film was titled "Terror," spelled with capital letters for emphasis.

Alexander Hamilton had deliberately chosen the corner seats in the last row, offering an unobstructed view of the entire theater.

But this also meant they were equally visible to the audience in front.

Evelyn Carter found herself trapped between the wall and Alexander, unable to move. On screen, an exploration team ventured deeper into an abandoned hospital, the eerie visuals paired with unsettling sound effects making her skin crawl.

Suddenly, darkness enveloped her vision.

The fresh scent of citrus lingered around her.

"What are you doing?"

Before Alexander could answer, screams erupted from the front rows. A child wailed in terror.

Seconds later, he removed his hand. "That scene was too graphic."

Evelyn glanced sideways to see him lounging casually, legs crossed, munching popcorn with apparent enjoyment.

"Alexander," she hissed, "you dragged me out at noon just to watch a horror movie?"

He offered the popcorn bucket. "Want some?"

"No."

"It won't make you fat."

"..."

Noticing her worsening expression, Alexander chuckled and set the popcorn aside. Leaning closer, he murmured, "You still haven't figured out Peter Harrison's real motive."

Evelyn frowned. "Simon Stapleton was genuinely interested in Lora Hardy until Peter showed up and planted doubts. This is clearly a power move to demonstrate he can sabotage our plans."

"Exactly." Alexander nodded. "And then?"

"Then Natalie Stapleton can only secure her divorce and assets by negotiating with him and meeting his demands."

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted. "But have you considered what someone as calculating as Peter truly wants?"

The question gave Evelyn pause.

Peter had flourished at the design institute, earning Mr. Harrison's favor and even taking charge of Hamilton Group projects.

His career prospects shone bright.

"I asked him about sudden wealth before. He didn't seem interested."

Alexander scoffed. "I've met plenty like him. Money won't sway him—he's after something more lasting."

"Then what does he want?"

"Redemption. To prove he's superior to privileged heirs. To make those who looked down on him grovel."

Evelyn shook her head. "He's always been top of his class with a respectable career. Who would disrespect him?"

"You don't understand state enterprises. Their seniority systems can crush a person's dignity."

"So what's our move? Initiate negotiations?"

"Patience." Alexander's gaze swept the rows ahead. "Whoever acts first loses leverage. Let him come to us."

Evelyn scanned the theater.

Simon was absent.

So was Peter.

"Then what exactly are we waiting for?"
###Chapter 267: Change That Title

"Movie?" Alexander Hamilton waved the tickets in his hand. "We might as well watch something while waiting. Married for over three years, and we've never been to the cinema together."

Evelyn Carter turned her face away, focusing on the screen.

Alexander offered her a soda. "Want some?"

"Just watch the movie."

"It's a horror film. Not scared?"

Evelyn shot him a sidelong glance. "I perform surgeries daily. You think fake blood and props frighten me?"

Alexander nodded thoughtfully. "Point taken."

As the credits rolled, the hallway filled with pale-faced girls and eager boys seizing the chance to comfort them.

Evelyn cradled a nearly full bucket of popcorn. "Emily loves these. No sense wasting them."

She requested a bag from the concession stand and carefully packed the leftovers.

Alexander's gaze darkened with unreadable emotion.

"What?" Evelyn returned with the bag in hand.

"I realize I still don't know enough about you."

Evelyn chuckled dryly. "The feeling's mutual."

Simon Stapleton was nowhere in sight outside the mall.

The moment they got in the car, a shrill ringtone pierced the silence.

The caller ID displayed "Peter Harrison," making Alexander's jaw tighten. "Block him after this is over."

"Our families are close. We have to maintain appearances."

"At least drop the 'brother' title." Alexander paused. "Use his full name."

Peter's warm voice flowed through the speaker. "Enjoy the movie?"

Despite her preparation, the direct probing sent chills down Evelyn's spine.

"It was fine."

Peter laughed softly. "I wanted to take you myself, but you're too sharp—"

The phone was snatched from her hand.

Alexander's voice turned glacial. "Time. Location. Cut the crap."

Amused laughter echoed from the other end.

"Relax, Mr. Hamilton. The most intimate contact Evelyn and I ever had was a pat on the shoulder."

"If you'd done more, this call wouldn't be happening."

Twenty minutes later, they sat across from Peter in a café.

"Iced Americano for the gentleman, hot milk for the lady." Peter smiled at Alexander. "If I recall correctly, you prefer black coffee."

Alexander pulled out Evelyn's chair first. "I prefer tea, actually."

"Oh?" Peter raised an eyebrow. "Then it must be Annabelle who loves coffee, and you adopted her preference."

Alexander's eyes turned arctic. "If you want a good deal, watch your mouth."
###Chapter 268: Hidden Concern

Peter Harrison smirked with hidden meaning. "No need to get angry, Mr. Hamilton. I'm just stating facts. Though Evelyn seems to be your new favorite now, so let's leave the past behind."

Alexander Hamilton's gaze turned sharp. "Why didn't you bring roasted sweet potatoes to win her over today?"

"First, I'd rather not get punched." Peter swirled his coffee cup. "Second, I specifically ordered hot milk for Evelyn. She's not feeling well today—something warm will help."

Alexander's attention snapped to Evelyn.

Her face paled instantly.

It was true—she had her period today.

But how did Peter know?

Alexander mused, "No wonder you've been in such a bad mood."

"Anyone would be cranky after being dragged out to watch a terrible movie for no reason."

"Next time, I'll have Emily screen the films first." His tone was calm. "We'll only go if the ratings are high."

Evelyn pressed her lips together and stayed silent. This was a game between two men—she was merely a spectator.

The server arrived with their drinks.

Evelyn cradled the warm milk, taking small sips. The sweetness spread across her tongue, easing the dull ache in her abdomen.

Suddenly, Alexander snatched the cup from her hands and took a large gulp.

"Too bitter." He frowned, setting down his coffee, then swallowed the milk. "This is just the right sweetness."

Peter cut to the chase. "I want lead control over Hamilton Group's projects for the next three years."

Alexander tapped the table lightly. "Ambitious. Hamilton handles nearly a hundred projects annually with cash flow exceeding a billion. You're asking me to stake my fortune on you."

"Originally, I wanted five years." Peter's gaze slid meaningfully toward Evelyn. "If Evelyn and I got married, bought a house... by then, Mr. Hamilton might need eight or ten years to make us divorce."

Alexander scoffed. "I like her, but that doesn't mean I'll be your cash cow."

"Oh?"

"Rather than giving you a decade of control, it'd be simpler to just eliminate you." Alexander lounged back, crossing his long legs. "If you've done your research, you'd know how easy that is for me."

Peter narrowed his eyes. "True. Evelyn might be the only person in the world who still believes you're a gentleman."

"Name your bottom line."

"Three projects." Peter held up three fingers. "Cloud Terrace Resort Phase Two, the amusement park demolition, and Times Square in S City."

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "You've done your homework."

"My final offer. It won't cripple Hamilton Group, but I won't work for free either." Peter lifted his coffee cup. "Whether Simon and Natalie Stapleton divorce depends on you now."

The air hung heavy for several minutes.

"Deal." Alexander finally uttered the word.

As they left, Peter escorted them to the car with exaggerated courtesy. He looked at Evelyn, sincerity in his voice. "It wasn't all manipulation. I genuinely like you. If I had Alexander's background—"

A car horn blared abruptly.

Evelyn flinched back half a step.

Peter startled as well.

Alexander remained impassive. "Just testing the horn. Needs maintenance."
###Chapter 269: No Turning Back

Peter Harrison's laughter echoed through the empty underground parking lot. He shouted after Evelyn Carter, "Evelyn, wait for me! In ten years, I'll come back in glory to marry you—Hey! I wasn't finished!"

The black sedan sped off like a cheetah.

Alexander Hamilton yanked off his tie and threw it onto the back seat. "Annoying."

The air in the car grew heavy.

Evelyn spoke softly, "Did the deal go through?"

"Those three projects are the lifeline of Hamilton Group for the next five years." Alexander smirked. "With that bargaining chip, he can establish himself anywhere."

Evelyn understood.

Peter had been biding his time for years, waiting for this exact opportunity.

"Thank you," she said after a pause. "I didn't ask for anything in the divorce. Consider this compensation for your losses."

"What if it's not enough?"

"..."

"Just kidding." Alexander tapped his fingers lightly on the steering wheel. "I just wanted to see you smile."

"Alexander."

"Hmm?"

"We won't get back together."

His fingers stilled.

"Once this is over, we go our separate ways. I'm stubborn. I don't understand romance. Don't waste your time."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "Don't be so quick to decide. The future is long."

"There is no future." Evelyn turned to look out the window. "If I turn back now, what does that make the child?"

A phone vibration shattered the silence.

"Check it for me," Alexander said. "I'm driving."

"It's not appropriate."

"It's from Lora. Just read hers."

Evelyn hesitated before picking up the phone.

Her fingers instinctively entered the familiar passcode—Annabelle's birthday.

"Wrong password."

"I changed it."

"What's the new one?"

"...The day the child left."

Evelyn's hand froze midair.

After three attempts, the screen finally lit up.

Lora's screenshot was glaringly visible:

[Simon Stapleton: Baby, I'm sorry. I've been busy with work these past couple days.]
[Simon Stapleton: I booked your favorite restaurant tonight.]
[Simon Stapleton: I shouldn’t have believed those rumors this morning. Let me explain in person.]
[Simon Stapleton: Please talk to me?]

Every "baby" made Evelyn nauseous.

"Simon resurfaced?" Alexander glanced over.

"Yeah. Crawling back with his tail between his legs."

"Peter works fast." Alexander scoffed. "Guess he's really afraid I'll kill him."

Evelyn suddenly turned to him. "Were you really... that reckless before?"

The car slowed to a stop by the roadside.

Alexander removed his glasses, his gaze darkening. "Want to find out?"
###Chapter 270: Do You Like the Nice Guy Type?

Evelyn felt uncomfortable under Alexander's intense gaze.

"You're right."

Alexander leaned slightly closer. "Hmm?"

"During our three-year marriage, we were practically strangers."

Peter Harrison was cunning and calculating. Approaching thirty, he remained stuck at the design institute, toiling away without any notable achievements.

If Alexander hadn't extended an opportunity, who knew how much longer Peter would have had to bide his time before getting what he wanted?

The head of Hamilton Group could never be docile or soft.

"Peter was right—only someone as naive as me would believe you were a good man for three years. If I'd known your true nature, I wouldn't have dared to lose my temper with you."

Alexander chuckled softly and adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses.

He rotated his wrist. "You're not naive."

"You're intelligent enough—you just refuse to play dirty. Unlike Peter and Simon, who climb over others to get ahead." He paused. "Evelyn, there's one thing I never lied about. During those three years, I genuinely wanted to spend my life with you."

"A leopard can't change its spots. Wasn't it exhausting pretending to be a nice guy for three years?"

"Do you like nice guys?"

"..."

"Seems like you don't." Alexander understood. "Lately, I've been wondering what type you actually like. Unfortunately, your past is too clean—no reference points. But it's fine. We have a lifetime ahead. I don’t want to pretend anymore. Honesty is easier."

Evelyn didn’t let Alexander drop her off at the hospital entrance.

She got out at the corner and walked the rest of the way.

When she pushed open her office door, Gregory was sitting at her desk, flipping through a book.

Evelyn checked the time. "Why are you still here after hours?"

Gregory closed the book and stood. "Did you take the afternoon off?"

"Yeah, I went home to rest."

"Why did you come back?"

"I was worried about Natalie."

Gregory nodded. "The nurse Vivian hired is professional. The director is here too—the Stapletons won’t cause trouble."

"Did you... need something from my office?"

"Olivia had questions about her thesis. When she couldn’t find you, she came to me."

Evelyn glanced around. "Where is she?"

"Cafeteria."

Evelyn smiled. "Thanks for helping. Since Natalie’s fine, I’ll head home."

"Evelyn—"

She stopped at the door. "Yes?"

"Are you wearing perfume?"

"No."

Evelyn froze.

She sniffed her sleeve—a faint citrus scent.

Alexander’s cologne.

They’d spent too much time together that afternoon, and the fragrance had lingered.

"Maybe my sister used an air freshener at home."

Gregory’s lips twitched. "Is that so?"

"Yeah. I’ll ask her later. I’m leaving now."

After confronting Peter, she had no choice but to walk home.

Luckily, it wasn’t far—just enough time to air out the scent.

But Emily’s nose was too sharp.

"Sis, does your hospital use orange-scented disinfectant?"
###Chapter 271: Quick to Apologize, But Won't Change

Evelyn had barely stepped through the door when Emily Anderson threw herself into her arms.

"Evelyn, why do you smell like perfume?" Emily sniffed at her neck like a curious puppy.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Is it strong?"

She'd deliberately taken a thirty-minute detour to let the night air erase the traces.

Grace Anderson peeked out from the kitchen. "Stop bothering your sister. Come help with dinner."

Emily stuck out her tongue and dashed barefoot toward the kitchen, only to be scolded by their mother.

That girl had always been this way—first to apologize, but never learning her lesson.

Andrew Anderson emerged from the inner room, reading glasses perched on his nose as he muttered over a ledger.

"Dad, what's that for?" Evelyn asked curiously.

"Auntie Lucy brought over gifts today," Andrew adjusted his glasses. "Premium liquor, cigarettes, bird's nest—all top-shelf. I'm noting them down for future reciprocity."

Grace carried out steaming dishes. "We're old friends. No need for such formality."

"It's not about formality," Andrew said seriously. "Our daughter's marriage mustn't appear unequal. Whatever the Harrisons give, we return in kind. This is about Evelyn's dignity."

Emily rolled her eyes. "You're overthinking it, Dad. Auntie Lucy just adores Evelyn."

"What do you know?" Andrew's expression darkened. "Last time, the mismatch in status hurt Evelyn. This time, we'll uphold appearances properly."

He turned to his younger daughter. "Same goes for your future partner."

Emily mumbled, "What if I also marry someone wealthy?"

Grace rapped her chopsticks against Emily's head. "Don't you dare! Even your brilliant sister stumbled. You'd be led around by the nose!"

"Ow!" Emily clutched her head, jumping back. "Fine, fine! I'll find someone like Peter Harrison, okay?"

"Better." Grace thrust the chopsticks at her. "Go wash these again."

Watching her sister's reluctant retreat, Evelyn's lips curved involuntarily.

The sisters were opposites—Evelyn disciplined to the point of parental concern, Emily raised on constant reprimands. As their father often said, Emily's Ivy League admission resulted solely from "strict parenting producing excellence."

"Evelyn," Grace said while serving rice, "Emily and I discussed her staying in Hudson City. Ask Peter later which university suits her scores best."
###Chapter 272: A Familiar Face

Evelyn set down her chopsticks. "Emily's scores should be enough for Hudson University."

"Hudson University..." Grace mused.

"Mom, what are you thinking?"

Grace's eyes lit up. "Peter works at a state-owned enterprise, right? Since we'll be family soon, I want Emily to study architecture or civil engineering. After graduation, Peter can help arrange a position for her."

Evelyn frowned slightly. "Mom, a state-owned enterprise might not suit Emily."

"Why not? They offer stability and regular paychecks. With Emily's temperament, expecting her to work overtime for promotions is unrealistic."

"But—"

"Why don't you invite Peter over for dinner? We can ask him about the opportunities at his company."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "He's been very busy lately."

"Still busy? What about your wedding plans?" Grace grew anxious. "Your father and I were thinking of an engagement after the New Year and a wedding in May."

Evelyn shook her head. "The timing isn't clear yet. Let's eat first, Mom, Dad."

The doorbell rang suddenly.

Emily jumped up. "It must be Peter! I'll get it."

Grace smiled and stood. "I'll set another place."

Emily's voice carried from the doorway. "Who are you looking for?"

"I'm here to see Dr. Carter... I messaged her this afternoon but didn't get a reply. I’m sorry for interrupting your dinner."

Annabelle stood outside, snowflakes dusting her fur collar, her expression uneasy.

Emily turned and called, "Evelyn, someone's here for you."

Grace came out with an extra set of utensils. "Who is this...?"

"She's a former patient of mine," Evelyn said.

Annabelle bowed politely. "Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson. Dr. Carter performed my surgery."

"You must have urgent business to come so late. Come in and sit down," Grace offered warmly.

Annabelle quickly waved her hands. "No need, Mrs. Anderson. I’ll just say a few words here."

Emily tilted her head, studying her. "You look familiar. Have we met before?"

Evelyn stood immediately. "Let’s talk outside."

Annabelle nodded to the room. "Enjoy your meal. We won’t be long."

Andrew suddenly frowned. "She does look familiar."

Emily agreed. "Right? I knew I’d seen her before."

Grace ladled rice into bowls. "Nonsense. Evelyn’s patients are all from the OB-GYN department. When would either of you have gone there?"

Emily stuck out her tongue. "True, maybe I’m mistaken. Wow, shrimp for dinner!"

"Don’t pick through it—save some for your sister..."

Evelyn slipped on her coat and stepped out.

The door closed, muffling the cheerful chatter inside.

Annabelle gestured toward the street. "My car’s downstairs. Should we talk there?"
###Chapter 273: The Drama Queen

The French plane trees rustled outside the apartment building.

Evelyn Carter crossed her arms, her gaze icy. "Get to the point."

Annabelle Taylor's smile froze. Her fingers twisted the hem of her shirt unconsciously. "I know you hate me..."

"Then stop wasting my time."

"My parents want to invite you to dinner."

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh. "What, a trap?"

"No!" Annabelle's eyes reddened. "They just want to apologize to you in person..."

"Not interested."

The door of a red sedan swung open.

A refined middle-aged man approached quickly. "Annabelle, get in the car first."

Annabelle bit her lip and turned away.

"Dr. Carter, I've heard so much about you." The man handed her a business card. "I'm Andrew Taylor."

Evelyn didn't take it. "Mr. Taylor, speak plainly."

"Our family has wronged you." Andrew sighed. "Annabelle... she won't have it easy from now on."

"With the Hamiltons protecting her, what does she have to worry about?"

"Alexander..." Andrew gave a bitter smile. "That won't last forever."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "So?"

"If in the future—"

"Evelyn!" A clear male voice interrupted.

Peter Harrison strode over with a fruit basket, casually draping an arm around her shoulders. "Your mom invited me for dinner."

Evelyn stiffened.

"And you are?" Andrew looked puzzled.

"Fiancé." Peter flashed an innocent grin. "Wedding's next month. You should come."

Andrew's face paled. "I see... My apologies."

As the car drove away, Evelyn shoved Peter off.

"Enjoying your little act?"

Peter waved his phone. "Mr. Hamilton just transferred the final payment. Gotta provide good after-sales service."
###Chapter 274: Does Your Mother Know What You've Done?

"Does Auntie Lucy know about your shady dealings?"

"She doesn't."

Evelyn Carter exhaled in relief. "Good. My mother is getting older. She can't handle this kind of shock."

Peter Harrison leaned against the wall, a cigarette between his fingers. "My mother never really cared about what I do."

"How did you know about my... cycle?"

"Emily told me."

"She volunteered that information?"

"Your little sister," Peter blew out a smoke ring, "is adorably naive. A few casual questions, and she spilled everything about you."

Evelyn frowned. "Emily genuinely thinks you're a good person."

"So?" Peter scoffed. "Want me to go apologize to her now?"

"At least don't badmouth her in front of me."

"Fine," Peter stubbed out his cigarette. "Then make sure I never see her again."

Evelyn pointed to the elevator. "You can leave right now."

Peter suddenly stepped closer. "Evelyn, I’ll actually miss you."

"Back off."

"What if we make this fake relationship real? I can give you everything Alexander Hamilton does."

Evelyn smirked. "Should I call Alexander right now?"

"Don’t," Peter raised his hands in surrender. "Just joking."

"What about Simon Stapleton—"

"Relax," Peter adjusted his tie. "The terms Mr. Hamilton offered were too good. I’m out."

Evelyn locked eyes with him. "You’d better be."

"I’m leaving for S City at the end of the month," Peter said suddenly, his tone serious. "Let’s just say we weren’t compatible."

"That’s too obvious."

"Then what do you suggest?"

Evelyn thought for a moment. "Say it was due to work relocation. The distance made it hard."

"Whatever." Peter turned and pressed the elevator button. "By the way, I leave at month’s end. Good luck with your overseas assignment."

......

Vivian Dempsey burst into the café like a whirlwind. Evelyn was reviewing relocation documents when her best friend snatched the file from her hands.

"Big news!" Vivian gasped. "Simon Stapleton is getting married!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "That fast?"

"Unbelievable, right?" Vivian gulped down her iced americano. "Dad says Oceanic Group is already planning the wedding."

"Lora agreed?"

"Apparently she’s head over heels," Vivian rolled her eyes. "Dad’s dying to know who this mystery groom is."

Evelyn chuckled. "Mr. Dempsey pushing you to date again?"

"Ugh! I’m escaping abroad with you!" Vivian crunched an ice cube angrily.

"Perfect timing," Evelyn closed the folder. "I leave at month’s end."

A shadow fell across their table.

The sharp click of stilettos approached.

A woman with crimson lips smiled down at them. "Dr. Carter? I’ve heard so much about you."
###Chapter 275: The Uninvited Guest

Evelyn Carter looked up at the unexpected visitor before her.

"Who are you?"

"Yvonne Young, legal department of Hamilton Group." The woman slid a document across the table. "Please sign this."

Vivian Dempsey snatched the papers first. "Did Alexander Hamilton send you?"

Yvonne's lips curved slightly. "Does it matter? Perhaps you should read the contents first."

"Property transfer agreement?" Vivian flipped through the pages, her frown deepening. "A beachfront villa? A downtown school district apartment?"

"Correct." Yvonne tapped the document with slender fingers. "The villa sits on the golden coastline, valued at five million—perfect for retirement. The apartment is right next to Polytechnic University, a two-minute walk. It comes with a maid and chauffeur."

Vivian scoffed. "So Alexander thinks he can buy people off with money?"

"Isn't this exactly what Dr. Carter needs right now?" Yvonne gave Evelyn a meaningful look. "A secure future for her parents, schooling for her sister—all taken care of."

Evelyn's fingers drummed lightly on the table.

Something wasn't right.

Alexander knew she despised this kind of approach.

"Let me ask again," Evelyn met Yvonne's gaze directly. "Did Alexander Hamilton send you?"

Yvonne suddenly smiled. "I work for Hamilton Group, but today I'm here in a personal capacity."

Vivian slammed her hands on the table. "Then who's behind this?"

Yvonne's expression turned icy. "Dr. Carter, surely you understand when to quit while you're ahead?"

"What's the condition?" Evelyn cut straight to the point.

"Smart." Yvonne narrowed her eyes. "Leave Alexander Hamilton. Forever."

Vivian burst into laughter. "As if we needed you to say that? Hand over the pen!"

Yvonne yanked the document back. "It must be signed by Dr. Carter herself."

"What's your game?" Vivian glared.

"Exactly what it says." Yvonne smoothed the papers with deliberate slowness. "If these get damaged, we'll have to reprint them. What a waste of time."

Vivian trembled with rage. "Who put you up to this?"

"No comment."

Evelyn placed a restraining hand on her furious friend, then suddenly chuckled. "Yvonne... Annabelle Taylor's best friend?"

Yvonne's face stiffened.

"What's going on?" Vivian looked confused.

"Middle school classmates. High school desk mates." Evelyn's tone was calm. "Very close."

Vivian's eyes widened in realization. "Another one of Annabelle's people? Hamilton Group might as well be her backyard!"

Yvonne stared hard at Evelyn. "You know me?"

"That reunion at the lounge bar." Evelyn recalled. "You kept shielding Annabelle's stomach. She made sure everyone heard your name."

Yvonne's fingers clenched, crumpling the edge of the document.
###Chapter 276: Alexander, Are You Even Capable?

Yvonne narrowed her eyes, a mocking smile curling her lips. "So you were there that day too?"

"Mm."

"Ha! And yet you pretend to be so magnanimous? Talking about how arranged marriages lack emotional foundations—when you’re clearly eaten up with jealousy. Did you secretly follow Alexander and Annabelle to their reunion?"

"Alexander took me there."

"Then why didn’t he introduce you to everyone? Instead, he stuck to Annabelle like glue. Everyone thought they were the couple." Yvonne suddenly laughed. "How pathetic—your own husband pining after another woman... Tell me, does he ever call you by the wrong name when you’re intimate?"

"You—!" Vivian slammed her hands on the table and shot to her feet.

Yvonne raised a challenging brow. "What, did I say something wrong?"

"Watch your mouth!"

"Oh, this is too much for you? The Qing dynasty fell ages ago! Or are you still stuck in feudal times?" Yvonne crossed her arms, looking down her nose at Vivian. "Want to hit me? Just make sure you’ve got the money for medical bills and emotional damages. Or go ahead and curse at me—I’m clinically depressed. After you’re done, I’ll slit my wrists."

Vivian trembled with rage. "Birds of a feather flock together. No surprise a homewrecker’s friend is just as vile."

Beep.

Yvonne pulled a recorder from her bag and hit save.

"Miss Dempsey, I’ve got all your lovely words on tape. Later, I’ll write a suicide note blaming your verbal abuse for triggering my depression." Her smile turned sinister. "Don’t worry, I won’t cut too deep. Just enough to land me in the ER—maybe even under Dr. Carter’s care."

Vivian’s eyes widened. "You planned this? You baited me on purpose?"

"Occupational habit." Yvonne waved the recorder. "Dr. Taylor’s much smarter—she didn’t say a word. But you? You’re just a pawn, and you don’t even realize it."

"Bullshit! Nothing you say could ever come between Evelyn and me!"

"Then we’ll let the police sort it out."

"Miss Young—" Evelyn spoke up suddenly.

Yvonne turned. "Yes, Dr. Carter?"

"I’ll sign the agreement. I’m leaving the country soon anyway."

Yvonne scoffed. "Spare me the act. You’re just after the money."

Evelyn signed swiftly and slid the document back. "Care to check?"

Yvonne skimmed it before snapping the folder shut. "I’ll hold you to that. And I’ll keep this recording. If I catch you near Alexander again..." She shot a meaningful glance at Vivian.

Vivian ground her teeth. "A lawyer resorting to underhanded tricks. How enlightening."

"Flattered." Yvonne smirked.

"You’re welcome!"

"The deed will be mailed to the hospital. Be sure to sign for it, Dr. Carter." Yvonne twirled the recorder. "Annabelle’s too soft. If it were up to me, you’d suffer what she did... How about I arrange some fun with a few Black guys? Ha!"

Before she finished, Evelyn lifted her phone from beneath the table. "Hear all that?"

Yvonne paled. "Who are you talking to?!"

"Alexander."

Yvonne froze. "You—"

Vivian clapped in delight. "Ohhh, scared now? You get to record, but we can’t make a call? Alexander, your legal counsel just threatened Evelyn. Care to comment?"

Yvonne lunged for the phone.

Vivian blocked her. "What, trying to silence her? Alexander, she’s attacking Evelyn!"

"I wasn’t!" Yvonne shrieked.

"What’s in your hand? A knife?"

"Liar!"

"You said you’d slit your wrists. No knife, no show."

Alexander’s voice cut through the line, icy and lethal. "I’ll handle this."
###Chapter 277: Who Should Be the First Lady?

Evelyn Carter pressed her lips together, her gaze steady as she looked at Alexander Hamilton. "How do you plan to handle this?"

Alexander tapped his fingers lightly on the table. "What would you like me to do?"

"Anything I want?"

"Mhm."

Evelyn lifted her eyes, locking them onto Yvonne Young.

Yvonne's face paled slightly, but she forced a cold smile. "At worst, you'll fire me. My family doesn't need money like some people who rely on men to survive. This job means nothing to me. When Annabelle got me into Hamilton Group, she never expected me to actually work."

Vivian Dempsey scoffed. "Oh, so you're not part of legal—you're Annabelle's spy camera in Hamilton Group? Here to monitor which women Alexander talks to?"

"Alexander would never be interested in the likes of you!" Yvonne lifted her chin. "You outsiders could never understand what Annabelle means to him."

"What meaning?" Vivian rolled her eyes dramatically. "Don't tell me it's some cheesy past-life connection?"

Yvonne smirked and waved her phone. "Think whatever you want. Firing me won't change anything. Alexander will return to Annabelle eventually. Just wait and see."

Vivian made a face at the phone. "Perfect! A scumbag and a schemer—they deserve each other. Stay together and spare the rest of us!" She jabbed the end-call button.

"Yvonne? Vivian? What are you doing here?"

Vincent Wilson strolled over with a curvy beauty on his arm, followed by Gregory Wilson and an unfamiliar man.

Vivian whispered to Evelyn, "That's Nathan York."

Vincent's eyes darted between them, his smile oily. "Even your arguments are a sight to behold. How about I treat everyone to dinner tonight? My treat to smooth things over."

Yvonne pouted. "Stop pretending. Shouldn't you be with your new fling?"

"Old friends matter more than new flames." Vincent oozed charm.

Yvonne giggled. "How many girls have fallen for that silver tongue of yours?"

"I swear, all my exes say I'm a good guy." He feigned innocence.

"Please. It's been ages. Drop the act if you want to stay friends."

"Fine, fine. Whatever you say."

Vivian tugged Evelyn's arm. "Let's go."

Yvonne suddenly blocked their path and turned to Vincent. "Vincent, you need to pick a side today."

Vincent played dumb. "What side?"

"You know Dr. Carter, right?" Yvonne pointed at Evelyn. "She just tattled to Alexander to get me fired. If he does it, will you back me up?"

Vincent chuckled nervously. "I can't interfere with Hamilton Group's affairs."

"Cut the crap!" Yvonne's expression darkened. "I'm asking you—do you want Annabelle as the first lady, or her?"

Vincent wiped his brow. "Shouldn't you ask Alexander that...?"

"His answer is obvious! We've seen how he treats Annabelle since we were kids!"

Vincent kept sweating, still trying to deflect. "Yvonne, let them go. I'll take you for drinks?"

Yvonne slammed the table. "Vincent Wilson! Choose one—Annabelle or Dr. Carter?"

"I..."

"Pick Annabelle, and we're still friends. Pick her, and we're done!"

Vincent wrung his hands. "After all these years of friendship..."

"Choose!" Yvonne snapped.

Vincent shot Nathan a desperate look.

Nathan cleared his throat. "Yvonne—"

Yvonne cut him off. "You too! Who should be the first lady?"
###Chapter 278: Childhood Romance?

Nathan York's forehead glistened with sweat. "This has nothing to do with me..."

"How can you say that? Don't you see how Alexander has been taking care of Annabelle all these years?"

"...I see, but—"

"But what?" Yvonne Young jabbed her finger toward each person in the room before stopping abruptly in front of Gregory Wilson.

Gregory's brows furrowed, his lips pressed into a thin line as he stared down at her.

Yvonne's ears turned pink. She quickly pulled her hand back. "Vincent Wilson!"

"Right here, at your service, my lady."

"Who is this? Aren’t you going to introduce him?"

Vincent exhaled in relief. "How could I forget? This is my older brother, Gregory Wilson. He just returned from abroad."

Yvonne stole a glance at Gregory, her voice softening. "So this is the brother you always talk about."

"Exactly. My brother’s amazing—an internationally renowned anesthesiologist."

"A doctor?" Yvonne twisted the hem of her skirt. "Impressive."

Vincent smirked. "Gregory, this is Miss Yvonne Young."

Gregory frowned slightly. "The Young family?"

"The one from north of the city," Vincent explained. "My brother doesn’t mingle in business circles. He’s not familiar with Hudson."

Yvonne blinked sweetly. "I understand."

Vincent suddenly tensed. "My brother already has someone in his heart."

Yvonne’s smile froze. "Who?"

Vincent shot a quick look at Evelyn Carter. "You wouldn’t know her."

"Is she in Hudson?"

"Well..."

Gregory answered calmly, "Yes."

Yvonne pouted. "Is it trendy for good men to fall in love early these days? Annabelle took Alexander, and now someone else got there first..."

Vincent raised his hand. "I don’t have an unattainable love."

Yvonne scoffed. "You think you compare to them?"

"...Fair point."

Vivian Dempsey had been watching silently until she suddenly kicked her chair back. "Are we playing truth or dare? Stay on topic."

Vincent paled. "Please, let’s not bring that up..."

"Oh, I will." Vivian planted her foot on the chair. "Vincent, Nathan, pick a side today. If you can’t tell right from wrong, don’t bother showing your faces again."

Nathan forced a smile. "Viv, this is Alexander’s personal business..."

"Cut the crap! You’ll have to call someone 'Mrs. Hamilton' eventually. Choose now."

Nathan’s smile stiffened as he elbowed Vincent frantically.

Vincent chuckled awkwardly. "...Does it matter which one we call 'Mrs. Hamilton'?"
###Chapter 279: Taking Sides

Yvonne pouted. "She's divorced and you still call her 'sister-in-law'? Vincent Wilson, you're such a flip-flopper, trying to please both sides?"

"I'm just being cautious," Vincent sneaked a glance at Gregory. "With two older brothers above me, I have to acknowledge both their wives, don't I?"

Yvonne widened her eyes. "Your own brother likes Annabelle too?"

"Huh?"

"Annabelle's so lucky," Yvonne muttered sourly. "She's always had men fawning over her since we were kids. Vincent, your eldest brother has good taste."

Vincent forced a laugh. "Yeah, yeah, much better than me..."

Yvonne bristled instantly. "What's that supposed to mean?!"

Vincent waved his hands frantically. "Not you! I meant the actress I brought today can't hold a candle to Annabelle."

Yvonne scoffed. "Say it to her face and see if she still talks to you."

"She still needs my investment for her new movie."

Yvonne waved him off. "Fine, I get it. You're Team Annabelle. Broken up but still friends. Nathan, your turn."

Nathan tugged at Vincent's sleeve for help, but the latter just shrugged.

"What's the holdup? Spit it out!"

"I..." Nathan's voice grew smaller. "...think Dr. Carter is better."

Yvonne whirled around. "Excuse me?!"

"Annabelle wasn't fair. She knew Alexander's feelings but played dumb, stringing him along for years..."

Yvonne's expression softened slightly. "Doesn't that prove Alexander truly loves Annabelle?"

Nathan hesitated. "But after Grandma Hamilton passed, Alexander seemed to wake up. He had me screenshot Vivian's posts just to check on Dr. Carter's updates... Mmph!"

Vincent clamped a hand over his mouth. "Do you ever think before you speak?"

Nathan glanced at Vivian and Evelyn, instantly regretting his words.

"Viv, I—"

Vivian raised a hand to cut him off. "They already knew."

Nathan froze. "Dr. Carter knew too?"

Vivian glared. "You think you're the only spy here?"

Nathan looked miserable. "Please, ladies, have mercy on me!"

Yvonne waved dismissively. "Consider your vote forfeited."

Nathan sighed in relief.

Yvonne turned to Gregory. "Dr. Wilson, you've got a sharp eye. Who's better—Dr. Carter or my bestie Annabelle? She's so sweet and innocent..."

"I've met her."

"Abroad?"

"Mhm."

Yvonne's eyes lit up. "Oh right, you have an unattainable love too. Don't tell me it's Annabelle? But she was married back then—"

"Miss Young."

"Yeah?"

Gregory's voice was icy. "We're adults. Stop with the childish team-picking games. It's immature."
###Chapter 280: You Don't Understand What Annabelle Means to Alexander

Yvonne froze, her face instantly darkening. "Did you just call me childish?"

Gregory raised one finger deliberately. "First, Vincent made it clear this is Alexander's private matter. Forcing them to take sides is pointless."

He raised a second finger. "Second, no matter who Dr. Carter ultimately chooses, Vincent will have to call her sister-in-law. Do you understand now?"

Yvonne's eyes widened as her voice rose sharply. "You actually like a woman Alexander dumped?!"

"Miss Young," Gregory's gaze turned icy. "Mind your language."

Vivian waved her phone with a bright smile. "Don't stop now, keep going. I'm recording everything for court. Since I've got depression too, we can share a hospital room."

Yvonne's face flushed crimson. "Dr. Wilson, I misjudged you!"

"My vision's perfectly clear," Gregory said coolly. "Annabelle knows exactly what she's done. As for you—" He paused meaningfully. "It's rare to see someone so eager to be someone else's pawn."

"That's a lie!" Yvonne protested heatedly. "Annabelle is my best friend!"

Vivian cut in, "Then why isn't she here fighting her own battles? Why send you as her attack dog?"

Yvonne faltered before finally sputtering, "You have no idea how important Annabelle is to Alexander!"

"Not our problem," Vivian rolled her eyes.

Vincent quickly intervened. "Let's not argue. How about some pool to cool off?"

Yvonne immediately scoffed. "Can she even play? Annabelle was personally taught by Alexander."

"Beginners can learn," Vivian challenged.

"Right now?" Yvonne lifted her chin smugly. "We're all experts here—especially Vincent and Nathan, trained by Alexander himself."

Gregory frowned. "Vivian, don't take the bait."

"Let's go." Evelyn spoke softly but firmly for the first time. "I'd like to try."

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Now that's the spirit! Let's show them what we've got!"
###Chapter 281: Your Taste Is Worse Than Mine

The billiards hall was dimly lit, with Vincent Wilson having booked the entire place.

Nathan York lurked in a corner, fingers flying across his phone screen as he occasionally glanced around.

Gregory Wilson stood by a distant pool table, taking a call while his slender fingers absently tapped the surface. A low chuckle escaped him as he raised a hand to cover his smirk, amusement dancing in his eyes.

"Did Yvonne Young buy her law degree?" Vivian Dempsey linked arms with Evelyn Carter and rolled her eyes openly.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I'm not familiar with law school curricula."

"Don't play dumb," Vivian nudged her with an elbow. "You know exactly what I mean."

They exchanged knowing smiles.

Vivian shook her head. "Birds of a feather. No wonder that homewrecker gets along with Yvonne—both equally brainless."

"Annabelle Taylor is actually decent professionally," Evelyn recalled. "She's explained legal concepts to me before."

Vivian suddenly lowered her voice conspiratorially. "I just squeezed some intel out of Nathan."

"So he was texting you?"

"That guy's a double agent," Vivian scoffed. "He'll probably report everything to Alexander Hamilton later."

At that name, Evelyn's smile faltered momentarily.

Nearby, Yvonne idly poked the floor with her cue while her gaze remained fixed on Gregory.

"Is she genuinely clueless or just pretending?" Vivian jutted her chin toward Yvonne.

From the moment they'd arrived, Yvonne had been "attentive" toward Gregory.

When Gregory casually complimented his brother's new car, Yvonne immediately interjected in a shrill voice: "A Porsche? Only nouveaux riches drive those. Dr. Wilson's taste is questionable."

Vincent awkwardly tried to smooth things over.

Gregory just patted his brother's shoulder. "Your taste is worse than mine."

Vincent flushed crimson.

Everyone knew about his high school fling with Yvonne.

But Yvonne had been too proud—disdaining Vincent's playboy ways while envying her best friend for catching someone like Alexander.

Vincent's preferences were... unique. While other boys chased the girl-next-door types, he had a thing for voluptuous bombshells.

"All his subsequent girlfriends," Vivian whispered, "were at least a D-cup."

Evelyn glanced at Yvonne's flat chest. "Then why did he ever..."

"Curious?" Vivian waggled her eyebrows. "Ask Young Master Wilson yourself."

Evelyn shook her head. "Just making conversation."

Just then, Nathan sidled up to them like a nervous spy. "Vivian... Dr. Carter..."

Vivian drawled sarcastically, "Done filing your report? What did your boss say?"
###Chapter 282: Alexander's Special Request

Nathan York frantically waved his hands. "I didn't report anything, I swear!"

"Then what were you doing on your phone for so long?"

"I was checking directions."

"Oh? What kind of directions take ten minutes to type?"

Nathan's ears turned red as he offered an appeasing smile. "I just wanted to say hi properly. Our meeting earlier was too rushed."

Vivian Dempsey raised an eyebrow. "Sure, nice to meet you too."

Nathan exhaled in relief and turned to Evelyn Carter. "Dr. Carter, do you play pool?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"No worries. If Yvonne keeps acting up later, I'll take you to the other side."

"What's over there?"

"You can order drinks."

Vivian suddenly slapped his shoulder. "Alexander sent you, didn't he?"

Nathan's face fell. "Was it that obvious?"

"You showing up out of nowhere to suck up? Only an idiot wouldn't notice. And I'm not as clueless as Yvonne."

Nathan sighed. "I don't get why she's being so crazy today."

"Don't bother playing knight in shining armor. Evelyn's got me."

"Come on, let me handle this. You go deal with Yvonne. I can't take her constant yapping—she's like a machine gun."

Vivian smirked. "Using company time for personal favors? Should I tell Alexander to dock your pay?"

Vincent Wilson approached with two cases of beer. "What's the hold-up? Let's play."

Nathan shook his head vigorously. "I'm staying with Dr. Carter for drinks."

Vincent caught on and turned to Vivian. "Shall we?"

Vivian glanced at Evelyn, who gave a slight nod.

"Game on!" Vivian rolled up her sleeves. "Time to teach her a lesson."

Vincent groaned. "Please go easy on her..."

"What, still protecting your ex after all these years? Is Yvonne your unattainable love now?"

Vincent covered his ears. "Mercy, master..."

Vivian marched straight to Yvonne. "Care for a match?"

Yvonne's eyes turned icy. "Loser crawls out."

"Too boring. How about on all fours?"

"Fine! Don't cry when you lose."

"Ha! Sweetheart, the one crying will be you..."

The tension between them crackled as Vincent dutifully became the cheerleader, applauding every shot.

"Dr. Carter." Nathan spoke softly.

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts. "Hmm?"

"What would you like to drink? Alexander specifically mentioned you shouldn't have anything cold this week. How about some warm ginger tea?"
###Chapter 283: Billiards Lesson

Evelyn hesitated for a moment before replying softly, "Just hot water, no brown sugar."

"Got it. Give me a sec. These billiards guys usually drink ice water, so I'll need to boil some fresh for you." Nathan York scratched his head and hurried toward the bar.

Evelyn crossed her arms, her gaze drifting to Vivian Dempsey and Yvonne Young locked in an intense game nearby.

Vivian was on a roll, sinking five balls in a row with aggressive precision while Yvonne stomped her feet in frustration.

The corner of Evelyn's lips lifted.

"What's so amusing?"

She blinked, snapping out of her thoughts. "Finished your call?"

Gregory Wilson pocketed his phone. "Olivia said Simon Stapleton and his mother caused another scene at the hospital. But don’t worry—the director had security throw them out immediately."

The tension in Evelyn's shoulders eased slightly. "We should’ve told the director sooner."

"Timing was perfect." Gregory leaned against the wall. "If you hadn’t laid the groundwork, he wouldn’t have acted so decisively."

"At least Natalie will get her assets back."

Gregory chuckled. "When a father sees his daughter in that state, he’d agree to anything just to end the marriage." He paused, then added dryly, "If my future daughter ever dates trash like that, I’ll break her legs."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Thinking far ahead, aren’t you? No girlfriend yet already worrying about a daughter? How’s Ms. Tan these days?"

"Busy." His tone was flat.

"With you two barely seeing each other—"

"Doctors are busy. Neither of us can complain." He cut her off, clearly unwilling to continue the topic.

Evelyn took the hint and fell silent.

"Since we’re just standing around, want a billiards lesson?"

She waved her hands dismissively. "My coordination is nonexistent. I only passed the 800-meter run in college because the teacher took pity on me."

Gregory had already selected two cues and handed her one. "Billiards is about technique."

Reluctantly accepting the cue, she followed him to the table.

Gregory bent over to break, his movements crisp and efficient. The triangular formation scattered instantly.

"Start with basic shots." He positioned the cue ball. "Aim to hit the brown one into the corner pocket."

Evelyn leaned down, fumbling as she tried to steady the cue.

"Your grip’s wrong." Gregory set down his own cue and stepped behind her.

His fingers lightly adjusted hers, his warm breath brushing her ear. "Like this—fingers slightly curved to create a pivot point for the cue."
###Chapter 284: I Said, Come Here

"Like this?"

"Lower."

Evelyn Carter bent down further.

Gregory Wilson stood behind her, frowning slightly. "Keep the cue parallel to the table."

She adjusted her stance, her fingertips trembling.

"Align your sight with the cue ball and the object ball." His voice came from above her, warm breath brushing her skin.

Evelyn held her breath and leaned forward again.

"Still not right."

Gregory suddenly closed the distance, his palm resting lightly on her shoulder. His body heat seeped through the thin fabric, making her spine stiffen.

"Relax."

His other hand guided her wrist, adjusting the angle. "There. That's correct."

The tips of Evelyn's ears burned.

"What are you two—?"

A sharp female voice cut through the air.

Evelyn straightened abruptly, turning to meet Annabelle Taylor's shocked gaze. Beside her, Alexander Hamilton's expression darkened like storm clouds.

Nathan York hurried over with a glass of water, apologetic. "Dr. Carter, here's your water."

Steam rose from the hot liquid.

Gregory took it smoothly. "Too hot. Let it cool first."

Alexander's gaze locked onto Evelyn, intense enough to scorch.

"Mr. Hamilton, what a pleasant surprise," Gregory said with a smile.

Alexander smirked coldly. "Likewise, Dr. Wilson. Where's your girlfriend?"

"She's busy."

Alexander suddenly seized Evelyn's wrist. "Come with me."

"Mr. Hamilton—" Gregory gripped her other hand. "We're in the middle of a game."

"I can't teach her?"

"Your wife is right here." Gregory glanced pointedly at Annabelle.

Alexander's eyes turned glacial. "Gregory Wilson. Don't test me."

"The exit is behind you," Gregory replied evenly.

Tension crackled between them.

Nathan wrung his hands. "Let's all calm down—"

"We are calm," Gregory said, though his smile didn't reach his eyes.

Annabelle tugged Alexander's sleeve. "Alexander..."

"Let go." He shook her off, his gaze razor-sharp.

Both men released Evelyn at once.

A red mark circled her pale wrist.

Gregory's expression darkened. "That was unnecessary, Mr. Hamilton."

"I'll take responsibility." Alexander stared at Evelyn. "Come here."

She rubbed her wrist. "Say what you need to say."

"Not here."

"There's nothing private to discuss."

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "Since when did you grow a backbone?"

Nathan hastily grabbed his arm. "Alexander, think this through—"

"Simon Stapleton went to find Natalie," Alexander said abruptly.

Evelyn paled. "Olivia just told me they were turned away."

"He changed his mind. He's not marrying Lora."

"Why?" Evelyn demanded. "Did Peter Harrison interfere again?"

Alexander crooked a finger, his voice icy.

"I said, come here."
###Chapter 285: Is This All You Have to Say to Me?

Evelyn Carter stood frozen in place.

Alexander Hamilton's gaze pinned her down like a vise.

Nathan York sensed the tension and quickly dragged Vincent Wilson over.

Vincent took one look at the charged atmosphere and felt his head throb.

Caught between two powerful men and two women, he was trapped in an impossible position.

Someone had to break the stalemate.

"Alex," Vincent ventured hesitantly, "should I get you a private room?"

Alexander shot him an icy glare.

Vincent rubbed his hands awkwardly. "Or maybe... the lounge area?"

Gregory Wilson spoke up abruptly. "Vincent, set up a table for me. The farthest one."

"On it!" Vincent seized the escape, pointing to a corner. "Clear that table over there!"

He turned to Evelyn. "Still want to continue your lesson? It's quieter there."

Evelyn nodded. "Alright."

An arm blocked their path.

"Vincent," Alexander's voice was dangerously low, "go play a few rounds with your brother."

Vincent shrank back. "I can't possibly beat him—"

Ignoring the protest, Alexander locked eyes with Evelyn. "You're really walking away from Natalie's situation?"

"The dean will handle it." Evelyn's tone was flat. "Simon backing out changes nothing. We'll take it to court if needed. Right now, Natalie has more pressing concerns than remarrying."

She turned to Gregory. "Let's go."

"Stop." Alexander's laugh was bitter. "Use me and toss me aside? How efficient of you, Evelyn."

"I appreciate Mr. Hamilton's assistance." Her voice remained calm. "The dean will be informed of this favor."

"I did it for you."

"Then thank you, Mr. Hamilton."

"You know exactly why I helped."

"People's motives are hard to guess."

"Evelyn!" Alexander's voice cracked like a whip. "Must you speak to me like this?"

She paused. "Then... congratulations on your happy union?"

Annabelle Taylor went deathly pale. "Dr. Carter, you—"

"My infertility wasn't my fault." Evelyn met her gaze squarely. "Let's drop the pretenses between us. By the way, your friend Yvonne gave me quite the gift today—two properties in exchange for my signature. I've already signed."

Alexander's eyes turned glacial.

Annabelle stammered, "Alex, I had no idea Yvonne would—"
###Chapter 286: Don't Push Your Luck

"Annabelle, why are your eyes red?"

Yvonne rushed over in three quick strides, pulling Annabelle into a tight embrace. "Did Alexander upset you again? You've known each other since childhood—you know exactly how he is. He used to indulge you, but now that you're about to get married, you should rein in that temper of yours..."

Annabelle frantically waved her hands. "No, we didn't fight. Yvonne, why did you come see Dr. Carter?"

Her voice trembled with panic. "I told you not to seek her out. Why would you—"

"I couldn't take it anymore!" Yvonne's expression darkened instantly. "She's divorced yet still clinging to men—asking Alexander for favors while planning a wedding with someone else. That two-faced gold-digger deserves to be called out every time I see her!"

"Hey, hey, hey!" Vivian stepped forward. "Miss Young, how many sugar daddies has your precious Annabelle reeled in over the years? Need me to refresh your memory? Or are you just begging for a reality check?"

Yvonne flushed with rage. "Annabelle isn't like that! She's just outgoing and gets along well with guys."

"Bullshit! Stop playing innocent. Want me to summon witnesses? Fine, just wait—"

Vivian pulled out her phone, ready to dial.

Yvonne snapped, "What are you doing?"

"Calling backup," Vivian sneered. "And maybe a few reporters. Remember when Mrs. Hamilton's mixed-race stillbirth trended? I’ll give the media even juicier campus scandals this time. Guaranteed to crash Hamilton Group's stocks again. Hope Alexander’s prepared for the fallout..."

Seeing Alexander's stormy expression, Annabelle quickly covered Vivian's mouth. "Miss Dempsey, aim your anger at me. Don’t drag Alexander or his company into this."

"Who the hell are you?" Vivian jabbed a finger at Yvonne. "If you want peace, control your little friend. Depression? Since when is that a free pass for bad behavior?"

Yvonne shrieked, "I have depression! The hospital diagnosed me!"

"Look at you today—screaming like a banshee. Where’s the depression now?"

"It’s smiling depression!"

Vivian burst out laughing. "How creative. Maybe I’ll get a psych eval too—see if I can murder you scot-free."

Yvonne stomped her foot. "You—!"

"Enough, Yvonne!" Annabelle yanked her back.

Yvonne struggled. "I’m defending you! They’re slandering you right in front of Alexander—"

"You... Ugh..."

Vivian clapped mockingly. "Keep going! Alexander should hear exactly how pure his fiancée really is..."

"Annabelle is perfect! Why else would Alexander wait twenty years for her? Question me all you want, but never doubt his judgment!"
###Chapter 287: The Unexpected Truth

"Cough! Cough!" Vincent Wilson suddenly cleared his throat and grabbed Yvonne Young's wrist. "Let's go play badminton."

"Let go!" Yvonne yanked her hand away. "Can't you see I'm defending Annabelle? Stop interfering!"

Vincent's eyes widened.

He knew Yvonne was naive, but not this naive.

"Miss Dempsey," Yvonne squared her shoulders. "I've been Annabelle's best friend since childhood. I know everything about her."

"Oh?" Vivian Dempsey arched a brow. "Then who's the father of that biracial baby in her belly?"

"That's a lie!" Yvonne stomped her foot angrily. "It's just hyperpigmentation from pregnancy! Those gossipmongers are spreading rumors—I'll sue them into bankruptcy!"

"Pfft—" Vivian burst out laughing. "So it's hyperpigmentation?"

"Exactly! Annabelle has always loved coffee, so her skin is prone to darkening. She might look fair now, but she was quite dark as a child. She only got lighter after getting whitening injections abroad."

Vivian doubled over with laughter. "Evelyn, did you hear that? What a bombshell!"

"What's so funny?" Yvonne glared. "There's nothing wrong with whitening injections! That 'baby' is just pigmentation. If you keep slandering Annabelle, I won't let you off!"

"Miss Young," Vivian wiped tears of laughter. "How can you be so sure it's pigmentation?"

"Because... Mmmph!"

Annabelle frantically covered Yvonne's mouth, shooting her warning looks.

Yvonne pulled her hand away. "Annabelle, the more you tolerate, the more they'll bully you! Today, I'm setting the record straight!"

"Yvonne! Let's go eat—"

"No!" Yvonne turned to Alexander Hamilton. "Mr. Hamilton, Grandma Hamilton's death was an accident. Annabelle only went to deliver food—who could've predicted this? You can't blame her entirely!"

Vincent and Nathan York exchanged glances—one pulling Yvonne back, the other covering her mouth.

"Please, for heaven's sake, stop talking..."

"Vincent Wilson! How dare you stop me?"

Vincent looked like he wanted to cry. "Hit me somewhere else, okay? I won't fight back..."

"Aww," Vivian teased. "So rough with your ex, Vincent? Let her finish."

"Exactly!" Yvonne kicked Vincent hard and broke free.

Straightening her clothes, she scoffed at Vivian. "Don't think I'll thank you."

Vivian shrugged. "Suit yourself."

Yvonne turned to Alexander, her tone pleading. "Alex, the baby thing is a misunderstanding. Annabelle loves you so much—you can't doubt her just because of skin discoloration."
###Chapter 288: What's Your Game, Alexander?

Vincent Wilson clapped a hand over his eyes, unable to bear the scene.

Nathan York inched backward, ready to bolt at any moment.

Vivian Dempsey suppressed a laugh and deliberately pressed, "Miss Young, you still haven't explained—how did you know the child had melanin deposits? And how were you so sure Annabelle was delivering food to Grandma Hamilton?"

"Annabelle told me herself!" Yvonne Young declared with conviction. "I trust her!"

Crash—

Nathan knocked over a chair in his frantic escape.

"Gotta go, Alex!" He fled the private room without looking back.

Vincent stomped his foot in frustration. "Nathan, you traitor!"

Yvonne looked bewildered. "Why'd he run like that? Did he see a ghost?"

Vivian deadpanned, "The Ghost Festival is coming up. Maybe he really did encounter something... unnatural."

"Are you stupid?" Yvonne scoffed. "That was weeks ago!"

"Oh—" Vivian drew out the word. "Guess I really am that dumb."

"At least you admit it." Yvonne lifted her chin. "Read more books. I graduated from a top university, unlike you third-tier college types."

Vivian's shoulders shook as she ducked into a corner, laughter bubbling out. "Thanks for the advice, Miss Young. I’ll remember this kindness forever!"

Yvonne frowned at Evelyn. "Should your friend see a psychiatrist?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Haha, thanks for your concern."

The room crackled with tension.

Gregory Wilson's lips curled slightly.

Alexander Hamilton's expression darkened.

Annabelle Taylor turned pale.

Vincent crouched in a corner, pretending to be invisible.

"Alex!" Yvonne suddenly raised her voice. "I’ve explained everything. You can’t keep misunderstanding Annabelle! After all these years, you’re finally together—don’t let petty people ruin it!"

Gregory interjected smoothly, "Miss Young is right. You should cherish what you have, Alexander."

Yvonne nodded vigorously. "Dr. Wilson gets it!"

Gregory glanced at her, then turned to Alexander. "Since the misunderstanding’s cleared up, we’ll leave you to it."

"Not so fast." Alexander shrugged off his jacket and hefted a pool cue. "I hear you’re quite the player, Doctor. Care for a game?"

"What’s your game, Alexander?"

"Your call."

"Singles are boring." Gregory looked at Evelyn. "Doubles? You and your wife versus Evelyn and me."

Alexander’s gaze turned icy. "Are you underestimating me, Doctor?"

Gregory smirked. "Who exactly are you doubting—Evelyn or me?"
###Chapter 289: The Silent Rivalry Between Men

Evelyn Carter abruptly looked up at Gregory Wilson.

She truly knew nothing about billiards.

Could he really take on two opponents alone?

Alexander Hamilton's gaze swept over Gregory like a stalking panther assessing its rival.

Gregory met his stare unflinchingly, posture relaxed.

"Annabelle!" Yvonne Young suddenly cried out, catching the swaying Annabelle Taylor.

Annabelle's face had gone deathly pale as she slumped against Yvonne, her voice barely audible. "I'm...fine..."

Gregory glanced at her pallid complexion. "Mr. Hamilton should take his fiancée to the hospital first."

Alexander frowned deeply. "What's really going on?"

Annabelle's lashes fluttered, tears glistening. "It's...nothing...the game...can continue..."

She braced herself against the pool table, forcing herself upright. "Dr. Carter...would you play one round with me?"

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Gregory.

Annabelle's condition didn't seem feigned.

"Another time," Evelyn said. "I have matters to attend to."

"Don't go!" Annabelle suddenly lunged forward, grabbing Evelyn's wrist. "Please...just one game..."

Vivian Dempsey immediately stepped between them. "Let go! If you want to play the victim, go to your fiancé!"

Annabelle gave a bitter smile. "...Fiancé?"

"Annabelle!" Yvonne cut in indignantly. "Alex will marry you eventually!"

She emphasized the last words deliberately, her gaze piercing Evelyn.

Annabelle's face turned even paler. "Yvonne, stop."

"Hmph!" Yvonne stormed off. "Ungrateful!"

The moment Yvonne turned away, both Annabelle and Vincent Wilson exhaled in relief.

"Hey!" Yvonne suddenly spun back. "Some people shouldn't eye others while already taken!"

Vincent frantically waved his hands at her, as if begging on his knees.

Vivian took a deep breath. "The air clears when certain people leave. Vincent, what were you thinking back then?"

Vincent chuckled awkwardly. "Youthful ignorance. Weren't you also—"

"Ahem!" Evelyn coughed pointedly.

Vincent immediately fell silent.

Gregory spoke up smoothly. "Are you sure you don't need medical attention, Miss Taylor?"

Annabelle didn't answer, only fixing Evelyn with pleading eyes. "I want...to play one game with Dr. Carter..."
###Chapter 290: A Familiar Stance

Gregory Wilson handed her the cue. "What do you think, Dr. Carter?"

Evelyn Carter ran her fingers along the smooth surface of the cue. "I'm still a beginner," she said softly. "And Miss Taylor isn't feeling well. This seems fair."

"Want to give it a try?"

She lifted her gaze to meet his. "What about you?"

"I'll play if you do."

Vincent Wilson had already set up the table with quick efficiency. Vivian Dempsey gave Evelyn's shoulder a light pat. "I need to take a call."

"Okay."

As Alexander Hamilton shrugged off his suit jacket, Annabelle Taylor instinctively reached for it. He sidestepped her and called out, "Vincent."

Vincent jogged over to take the jacket, flashing Annabelle an easy smile. "Focus on the game, Annabelle. I'll handle the small stuff."

Her smile tightened. "Alright."

Once the game began, Alexander dominated effortlessly. The cue became an extension of his will, sending one colored ball after another into the pockets.

Only the eight-ball remained.

Straightening up, Alexander smirked. "Leaving Dr. Wilson a chance."

Gregory studied the flawless trajectory and chuckled, shaking his head. "The outcome's already decided."

"How about settling the wager?"

"It's just for fun."

As Gregory bent to take his shot, Annabelle suddenly interrupted. "Wait!"

Alexander's expression darkened. "What now?"

"It's... my turn," she said, her voice trembling slightly.

Gregory arched a brow and offered her the cue. "Be my guest."

The way Annabelle positioned herself made Evelyn freeze. The lowered torso, the steady bridge hand, even the precise angle of her grip—it mirrored Alexander's technique exactly.

Gregory's lips curved knowingly. "Mr. Hamilton taught you well."

Alexander's face turned stormy. "That was a long time ago."

Evelyn kept her eyes downcast.

"Young love is the purest," Gregory mused. "That kind of heart-fluttering feeling... it might only happen once in a lifetime."

Alexander's voice was icy. "Youthful ignorance leads to poor choices."
###Chapter 291: The Most Heartfelt Love of a Lifetime

"Where is the line between right and wrong? Is it achieving success or having a perfect family? No one can judge whether a choice was right or wrong until the very end."

Alexander Hamilton wore a faint smile. "Dr. Wilson, you speak as if you've lived through it yourself. Did you also have someone who made your heart race in your youth?"

"Of course."

A trace of mockery crept into Alexander's smile. "Then doesn't your earlier 'philosophy on youth' contradict itself? At our age, everyone has a past. Since we're all starting from the same place, why play favorites?"

Gregory Wilson crossed his arms, his gaze steady. "I do have a past. But how do you know the person from my past isn't the same as the one in my present?"

Alexander's expression darkened instantly. He turned sharply toward Evelyn. "You knew each other before?!"

"Did you forget we're both doctors?"

"Vincent said you were abroad all this time. And Evelyn—" His voice tightened. "She never studied overseas."

"Education isn't imprisonment. Visiting family during holidays, academic exchanges, occasional trips back—what's so strange about that?"

Alexander's eyes grew colder. "You decided she was the one after just a few meetings? Without even knowing her background? Isn't that reckless?"

"We're different, Alexander. You had a childhood sweetheart. I had to believe in love at first sight."

Alexander scoffed. "That's not a very convincing story, Dr. Wilson. Love at first sight? Such things are rare."

Gregory met his gaze, his voice soft but firm. "Youth knows neither love nor hate—yet it's when the heart beats the hardest."

"Ah—!"

Annabelle's startled cry finally broke the tension between them.

The billiards table had become a battlefield.

What was once a clear path to victory had turned into an expertly crafted snooker. The eight-ball was completely blocked by the colored balls, ruining what should have been an easy win.

Already frustrated, Alexander's anger flared. "Did you do this on purpose?"

Annabelle's eyes reddened. "I—"

"I should've let Yvonne take you with her earlier."

"I just wanted to give you two more time together!" Annabelle cried, her voice trembling. "She won't even talk to you now. I was just... trying to help..."

Alexander froze, his frown deepening. "Annabelle, you destroyed the trust between us yourself. I heard every word Yvonne said earlier."

"That was years ago! I've changed now! My parents talked to me after they came back..." She took a shaky breath. "They went to see Dr. Carter..."

Alexander stiffened. "Why would they go to her?!"

"Don't panic," Annabelle said, her voice unsteady. "What if I told you they went to bring you two back together? Would you believe me?"

Alexander laughed coldly. "Do you think I would?"

"I know you don't. But it's the truth. They discussed it for a long time. I owe you, but you don’t care about my family’s business... They wanted to make it up to you."

Alexander's gaze turned sharp as a blade. "Compensation? Or begging me not to kick you out?"

"...Both."

"So hiring that actress to cause a scene at my company—that was your parents' idea too?"
###Chapter 292: Do You Still Want to Stop Me, Alexander?

Annabelle's head drooped lower.

"It was my own foolishness. My parents already gave me a stern lecture." Her voice was barely audible. "I know your heart belongs to Dr. Carter now. My parents said they've watched you grow up and understand your temperament. After causing you such a huge loss, you'd never swallow this injustice."

She paused, stealing a glance at Alexander Hamilton.

"Perhaps... I should find a way to make you happy."

The private room fell silent.

Gregory Wilson let out a soft chuckle. "That's quite an interesting proposition, Miss Taylor."

Annabelle bit her lip. "I know you all think I'm being hypocritical. But I mean it. If Alexander can reconcile with Dr. Carter, I'll feel at peace."

Her eyes reddened. "My parents are getting older, and I'm their only daughter. Everyone in our circle knows I can't have children..."

Gregory sighed. "Parents' hearts ache for their children."

"I know my sins are grave." Annabelle's nails dug into her palms. "Grandma Hamilton haunts my dreams every night, cursing me for ruining Alexander. All I want now is to atone..."

Evelyn Carter suddenly laughed.

"You don't believe me, Dr. Carter?"

"What do you think?" Evelyn arched a brow.

Annabelle took a deep breath. "I'll prove it to you. From now on, Alexander and I will be strangers. If it displeases you, we won't even need to be friends."

"Unnecessary." Evelyn's tone was flat. "I won't be around to see it."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm going abroad." Evelyn's gaze swept over Alexander's tensed jawline. "At least three years, possibly longer."

Alexander's head snapped up. "Where?"

"Undecided."

"When?"

"Waiting for the hospital's arrangements."

Alexander's knuckles turned white. "Are the formalities completed?"

Evelyn's lips curved. "What's the matter, Alexander? Still trying to stop me?"

The air froze.

Annabelle's eyes widened in shock.

Gregory pensively stroked his teacup.

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed violently, but no words came out.
###Chapter 293: Annabelle's Secret

The sharp crack of colliding billiard balls ceased abruptly.

Gregory Wilson straightened up after his final masterful shot, the colored balls dropping neatly into the pockets. A confident smirk played on his lips. "Good game."

Vivian Dempsey burst in, phone still pressed to her ear. "What? It's over already?"

"If Miss Taylor hadn't gone easy on me," Gregory said, leisurely polishing his cue, "you'd still be waiting in the parking lot."

"Whatever." Vivian hung up, waving her phone excitedly. "Perfect timing! I just got great news. Let's go—my treat to celebrate!"

Annabelle leaned heavily against the pool table, her face deathly pale. "You go ahead... I'm not feeling well..."

Vivian snorted. "Who said I was inviting you? This is for Evelyn and Dr. Wilson."

Annabelle's fingers dug into her palms as she swayed unsteadily. Her lips parted, but no sound emerged.

"Hey," Vivian frowned, eyeing her suspiciously. "You're not about to pull some fake injury stunt, are you? Just so we're clear—I haven't laid a finger on you."

Annabelle's pupils suddenly dilated. Her knees buckled—

Thud.

The sickening impact silenced the room. Annabelle collapsed face-first onto the floor, blood rapidly pooling beneath her.

Alexander Hamilton shot to his feet, his gaze darting between Evelyn and Annabelle's motionless form.

"Let's go!"
Vivian grabbed Evelyn's wrist, practically dragging her toward the exit. As the glass door swung shut, Evelyn caught Alexander's enraged roar and Vincent Wilson's panicked shouts.

The car ride was suffocatingly quiet.

Through the rearview mirror, Gregory watched Vivian nervously twisting her fingers while Evelyn stared blankly out the window, her profile betraying no emotion.

"Worried about her?" Gregory finally broke the silence.

"Who'd worry about that scheming witch?" Vivian bristled like a startled cat. "It's just... the way she fell looked pretty bad..."

At a red light, Gregory turned to face them. "Facial impact likely caused fractures. And judging by her posture during the fall, she was already unconscious."

Vivian peeked at Evelyn's expression and seized her hand. "She deserved it! Remember when you miscarried, Evelyn? The bathroom was covered in blood—I still get chills thinking about it..."

"Vivian." Evelyn's quiet rebuke held steel.

"Well it's true!" Vivian's eyes reddened. "You were skin and bones afterward, and even now your periods leave you sweating in pain..."

Gregory deftly changed the subject. "Miss Taylor's condition seemed abnormal. Her symptoms before collapsing suggest chronic anemia causing sudden syncope."

The car jolted over a speed bump.

As city lights blurred past the window, Evelyn recalled Annabelle's bloodless lips earlier—and the faint needle marks barely concealed beneath her sleeves.
###Chapter 294: Shouldn't Good Looks and Stamina At Least Serve a Purpose?

Vivian Dempsey suddenly slapped her thigh. "Could it be complications from that abortion procedure?"

The traffic light turned green.

Gregory Wilson pressed the accelerator lightly, brows furrowed. "Uncertain."

Evelyn Carter shook her head. "Dr. Porter is highly experienced. The surgery shouldn't be the issue."

"If the surgery wasn't the problem, maybe her recovery was poor?" Vivian leaned closer. "Evelyn, wouldn't a late-term abortion require postpartum care like a mini-confinement? Could she have developed complications?"

Evelyn replied seriously, "So-called 'confinement illnesses' are essentially the irreversible physical toll of childbirth. Ancient societies blamed 'poor postpartum care' to encourage more births."

"No wonder. Annabelle's family is wealthy—her postnatal care should've been impeccable." Vivian propped her chin on her hand. "Then why does she look so sickly?"

Gregory interjected quietly, "Her condition might be unrelated to the surgery."

"Then what's the cause?"

"She was... quite unrestrained abroad."

The implication was clear.

Vivian scoffed. "Alexander Hamilton's love runs deep, huh? How could he not know Annabelle was so wild overseas?"

"Didn't he choose to marry Evelyn and give up on Annabelle?"

Vivian smirked. "And yet he still divorced to go back and clean up her mess."

Gregory sighed. "As Yvonne said, none of us understand what Annabelle means to Alexander."

Vivian shot a glance at Evelyn.

"What is it?" Evelyn asked.

Vivian linked arms with her. "Nothing. Just some good news."

"What good news?"

"Natalie Stapleton just called. Simon refuses to divorce."

Evelyn recalled Alexander's interrupted words earlier. "What exactly happened?"

Vivian animatedly explained, "Simon and his mother had a falling out. He's desperate to divorce and climb the social ladder, but his mother wants to extort more from the Zhao family—thinks her son shouldn't have been a gigolo for nothing."

Evelyn frowned. "A gigolo? If Natalie wanted a gigolo, shouldn't she at least get someone with looks or stamina? What does Simon even have?"

"That mother-son pair operates on a different wavelength. Greedier than the next."

"What happened then?"

Vivian grinned triumphantly. "Your hospital director kicked them out. Natalie said her father's already hired a lawyer to file for divorce. Even if it takes a decade, the Stapletons won't get a single cent!"

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "It won't take that long. Simon's shrewder than his mother—he knows what's at stake."

"Hah! Of course. Alexander did alright this time. That Lora girl looks so... influencer-ish. But men seem to eat that up. Their taste is baffling. Add the 'Oceanic Group heiress' title, and Simon was bound to take the bait."

Gregory remarked dryly, "Most free lunches are poisoned."

"Poisoned or not, a social-climbing leech like Simon would sprint onto any escalator he sees."

"True." Gregory nodded. "Then we'll just wait for his inevitable fall."
###Chapter 295: On the Eve of Departure

Though born with a silver spoon in her mouth, Vivian Dempsey had an insatiable love for street food.

She led the group into a humble little Spicy Hot Pot shop.

"Hiss—" Vivian gasped from the heat but kept shoving meatballs into her mouth. "I've been eating here for three years. Authentic as it gets!"

Evelyn Carter opted for a mild broth, leisurely picking at the vegetables.

Gregory Wilson stared at the greasy tabletop, his frown deep enough to crush flies. "You brought her to a place like this?"

"Why not?" Vivian slapped the table. "Evelyn used to haunt the food stalls behind our campus!"

Evelyn chuckled. "Even the professors frequented the vendors near the med school. Now those classmates are all department heads in major hospitals."

"Exactly!" Vivian stuffed a slice of lotus root into her mouth. "Better than some people putting on airs with their fancy Western meals."

Gregory fell silent for a moment before suddenly waving the owner over. "One mild broth, please."

"Oh? The great Dr. Wilson finally stooping to our level?" Vivian teased with a smirk.

He scoffed. "Only for Evelyn's sake."

At the hospital, the handover proceeded smoothly.

Dr. Porter adjusted her reading glasses as she reviewed the files. "This old bones still have some use. Don’t worry about us."

Olivia Lightfoot clung to Evelyn, crying like a child. "Dr. Carter, don’t forget to send me chocolates!"

Evelyn ruffled her hair, a pang of envy flickering in her chest.

Such simple happiness was beautiful.

Late that night, Emily Anderson called.

"Don’t be sad, sis." Her voice was tender with concern. "I heard about Peter moving to S City."

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened.

"You two were perfect together..." Emily grumbled. "Does his company have no one else? Why tear you apart?"

The cold moonlight spilled through the window. Evelyn studied her reflection in the glass and softly murmured, "Yeah."
###Chapter 296: Ordinary People in the Tide of Fate

"Did Auntie Lucy really hint at that?"

"She didn't say it outright, but she was very apologetic, constantly making amends to Mom and Dad. Don't worry though—they're taking it better than expected. They just said some things aren't meant to be."

Evelyn Carter exhaled in relief. "How are Mom and Dad holding up these days?"

"Mom sighs sometimes, but she understands Peter's choice. Dad hasn't been affected at all—he's been glued to the TV watching the Olympics."

"That's good. Since I'm not home, make sure to help them more."

"Got it, sis." Emily Anderson replied obediently. "Oh, by the way, Peter already helped me finalize my college applications. You don’t need to come home this weekend."

"He went to our house?"

"No, probably too awkward. He had me come over to his place to fill everything out."

"Still going for Hudson Tech? What major?"

"Materials Science. Peter said it has good prospects and is relatively welcoming for women."

"Do you actually like it?"

Emily's voice softened. "Doesn't matter if I like it—as long as it pays well. Sis, in families like ours, who gets to talk about dreams?"

Evelyn's chest tightened. "You're so young. When did you become this pragmatic?"

"That's just reality, sis. Only the privileged get to be picky. Ordinary people like us have to focus on survival first." Emily forced a light laugh. "Anyway, gotta go—my anime just updated!"

After hanging up, Evelyn stared blankly out the window.

Peter had handled things decently—preserving both families' dignity while helping her sister with college plans.

But her sister's change broke her heart.

The girl who once rebelled for love had been worn down by reality in just one summer.

She didn’t know if this was good or bad.

Was it their circumstances forcing Emily to abandon her passions, or just the inevitable pain of growing up? Either way, it was heartbreaking.

Years from now, when Emily worked late in a lab, she might remember that summer spent obsessing over anime.

But this was the fate of ordinary people—in the relentless tide of time, even grief felt like a luxury.

"Dr. Carter! Big news!"

Olivia Lightfoot burst into the office, making Evelyn drop her pen.

"What is it?"

"That homewrecker's been hospitalized! In orthopedics, bandages all over her head. Stranger still—her parents are requesting a psych consult."

"Psychiatry?"

"Yeah! Do you think she..." Olivia made a wild gesture, "...snapped?"
###Chapter 297: The Uninvited Guest in the Parking Lot

Evelyn Carter slammed the medical record shut.

Olivia Lightfoot kept chattering, "...Her mother came in a wheelchair, looking absolutely terrible. And her father—he was so energetic last time, but today in the elevator, he looked completely hunched over..."

"Olivia."

"Huh?"

"Have you finished the post-op observation notes for Patient Three?"

"Oh no!" Olivia jumped up. "I'll go do it right now!"

The office finally fell silent.

Evelyn pulled open the drawer and retrieved the application form she had already filled out. The edges were slightly crumpled from her restless fingers.

The dean's office door was slightly ajar.

When she pushed it open, the dean was rubbing his temples in front of his computer screen. Spotting her, he quickly closed the shopping page for hair dye.

"Dean, I've prepared the materials."

"That fast?" The dean took the form, his eyes brightening behind his glasses. "The lawyer said your asset protection plan is quite innovative."

"I suggest returning the valuables first," Evelyn said calmly. "Repurchase them right before the trial."

"Natalie has everything arranged." The dean sighed in relief. "Your last outpatient shift is next Wednesday. Starting Thursday, you'll be on leave to prepare for your trip abroad."

"Mm."

"I heard your sister applied for Materials Science?" the dean suddenly asked.

Evelyn paused slightly. "Yes."

"Medical materials is a promising field." The dean smiled meaningfully. "Don’t hesitate to ask if you need any help."

As she left the office, nurses in the hallway congratulated her.

"Dr. Carter, I heard you're going to the UK for further studies?"

She nodded politely, her steps never slowing.

Fate was like a mischievous child.

Her carefully planned study abroad program had been shattered by an absurd marriage. Now that everything was finally back on track, she felt lighter, as if she could breathe easier.

Until—

Under the dim parking lot lights, the tall figure made her freeze mid-step.

He leaned against his car, the blue glow of his phone screen casting shadows on his sharp features. A cigarette burned between his fingers, its ember flickering.

Buzz—

Her phone suddenly vibrated in her pocket.
###Chapter 298: The Mask Comes Off

The phone screen lit up.

[Alexander Hamilton: Are you off work yet?]

[Alexander Hamilton: I'm waiting in the hospital parking lot.]

Evelyn Carter flipped her phone face down on the desk.

Three minutes later.

[Alexander Hamilton: If you don't come out soon, I'll come in to find you.]

She let out a cold laugh and quickly left through the hospital's back exit.

The taxi slowly pulled away from the hospital.

Alexander had finally shed his disguise.

That gentle, refined facade had only been crafted to suit Annabelle's preferences. Now the mask had shattered, revealing his ruthless nature beneath.

Evelyn knew him too well.

If he couldn't find her at the hospital, he would undoubtedly stake out her apartment.

"Driver, take me to Cicada Temple."

Cicada Temple was renowned for its spiritual potency, especially in granting health-related prayers.

After years of practicing medicine, she'd heard countless patients mention this place.

The ancient temple stood solemnly among towering pines and cypresses.

A few young monks sweeping fallen leaves clasped their hands in greeting when they saw her.

"Where can I get a protection charm?"

"The main hall."

Evelyn knelt in reverence, then carefully tucked the charm into her palm.

Familiar voices drifted in from outside the hall.

"...Praying for my daughter's well-being."

"Don't cry. We'll do our best to make amends."

"Punish me instead. Don't torment Annabelle anymore..."

"Alexander won't truly harm her, not after you saved his mother."

"I just worry no one will care for her after we're gone..."

"Maybe... we could ask Dr. Carter again?"

"But she had a miscarriage. What if she seeks revenge on Annabelle..."

"That girl has a kind heart. She wouldn't."

"It's that Yvonne we should watch out for..."

Mr. Taylor abruptly stopped speaking.

He had spotted Evelyn standing inside the hall.

"Dr. Carter!" He forced a smile and waved at her.

###Chapter 299 She's Being Haunted.

Behind Cicada Temple, nestled among rustling bamboo groves, stood an ancient pavilion.

Evelyn Carter turned to leave when Mr. Taylor called out to her.

"Dr. Carter, what a coincidence."

She paused and gave a slight nod.

Mrs. Taylor sat in her wheelchair, eyes rimmed red. "Dr. Carter, please help Annabelle..."

"Auntie, I'm an OB-GYN specialist."

"It's not that," Mr. Taylor sighed heavily. "She's being haunted."

"What?"

"Grandma Hamilton," his voice trembled. "She comes every night demanding Annabelle's life."

Evelyn frowned.

She recalled Annabelle's hysterical breakdown at the mall last week.

"There's no such thing as ghosts."

"You don't understand," Mrs. Taylor wiped her tears. "The old lady waited decades for a great-grandson, only to..."

Bamboo leaves whispered in the wind.

Evelyn's fingertips turned cold.

She'd never probed into Alexander Hamilton's past.

During their blind date, he'd been the picture of refinement—nothing like a man averse to marriage.

"She was always kind to me."

"That's because you never saw," Mr. Taylor said bitterly. "How fiercely Alexander fought her over Annabelle."

Dead leaves spiraled across the stone table.

A sudden realization struck Evelyn—she might never have truly understood the Hamiltons throughout this marriage.
###Chapter 300: The Red Thread Bracelet

Now she understood.

Evelyn finally saw the truth.

When news of Annabelle's overseas marriage reached home, Alexander Hamilton had given up all hope. That's when he accepted the arranged marriage proposed by Grandma Hamilton.

Or perhaps... it was simply because of her name.

"Grandma Hamilton never approved of our Annabelle," Mrs. Taylor sighed. "She thought Annabelle was stringing Alexander along—never saying yes, never saying no, keeping him hopeful without commitment."

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

This wasn't mere prejudice.

From Vincent Wilson and Richard Jackson, she'd heard stories about Annabelle's school days.

Not intentionally manipulative, but she'd certainly kept Alexander as a backup option.

Back then, Alexander had been content with that arrangement.

But Grandma Hamilton? A steel-willed matriarch who'd seen it all. Did anyone think she wouldn't see through a young girl's games?

"Later, you married Alexander and had a child," Mrs. Taylor's voice trembled. "When Annabelle returned after her failed marriage and reconnected with him... Dr. Carter, she never meant to break up your family. She only ever saw him as her closest friend—"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Mm."

Mrs. Taylor exhaled in relief. "My husband was right. You're truly kind and generous, Dr. Carter. No wonder Alexander fell for you."

"Alexander and I won't reconcile," Evelyn said calmly. "I'm leaving the country soon. Even without romance, they share a lifelong bond. You needn't worry."

"But this time, Alexander's resolve is unshakable." Tears spilled down Mrs. Taylor's cheeks. "Grandma Hamilton passed without final words because of Annabelle. And that child... Dr. Carter, his feelings for you are real—"

"Auntie." Evelyn cut her off. "I understand parental love. But are other people's daughters less precious? I was also cherished by my parents."

Mrs. Taylor flustered. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean—"

Mr. Taylor suddenly fixed his gaze on Evelyn's wrist. "This... is yours?"

Evelyn glanced at the red thread bracelet.

A childhood talisman from her parents, worn today to reassure them before her departure.

"It's just an ordinary protection charm—"

Before she could finish, Mrs. Taylor seized her wrist.

The red thread dug into flesh. Evelyn gasped at the sharp pain.

"Auntie, you're hurting me—"

"Terry... You're Terry..." Mr. Taylor's voice shook, tears streaming down his weathered face. "It's really you..."
###Chapter 301: The Warmth of Blood Ties

Evelyn Carter stood at the front door, her fingertips trembling slightly.

The sound of the lock turning alerted Grace Anderson inside. She hurried to open the door. "You're back! Come in, I'll heat up dinner for you."

The faint scent of cooking oil drifted from the kitchen.

Six small bowls were neatly lined up by the stove, each dish carefully wrapped in plastic film.

"Mom, so much food..."

Grace deftly removed the plastic. "Your favorite braised ribs, and Emily's sweet and sour fish. The soup was just made this afternoon—best served hot."

The range hood hummed softly.

Her mother's figure flickered in the haze of cooking fumes, the silver strands at her temples stark under the light.

"Mom."

"Hmm?" Grace kept her eyes on the sizzling pan. "Did you wash your hands? Dinner's almost ready."

Evelyn didn't move.

Grace finally noticed something was off and turned to look. "What's wrong? Work too exhausting?"

From the living room, Andrew Anderson called out, "Evelyn's home? Come help me with this."

She stepped into the bedroom.

Her father sat by the desk lamp, flipping through bankbooks with his reading glasses on.

"Dad."

He motioned for her to sit. "Perfect timing. Help me calculate if this is enough."

The edges of the bankbooks were slightly curled.

"This is..."

"You're leaving for England next month," he said in a hushed tone. "I've been saving up secretly. Don't tell your mom."

Her nose stung.

"Everything's expensive there. Heard a bowl of noodles costs dozens of pounds. A young woman shouldn't skimp on necessities."

"Dad, the hospital will cover room and board."

He shook his head stubbornly. "You still need pocket money. New clothes, dinners with colleagues—can't let them think our girls are stingy."

The lamplight cast a warm glow on his hands.

Calloused yet gentle, they smoothed the creased corners of the bankbooks.

"Dad, I might... stay there to work."

He paused briefly, then smiled. "Even better. But if you get homesick, come back anytime. Your room will always be here."

"What about Emily's tuition..."

"Don't worry about that." He patted her hand. "Just spread your wings. Your mom and I have everything handled."

Evelyn suddenly hugged him.

Andrew patted her back gently. "Silly child. A parent's love is instinctive. Have you ever seen a tree that doesn't cherish its fruit?"

The clinking of dishes sounded from the kitchen.

Grace called out, "Evelyn, dinner's ready—"

At that moment, something burned fiercely in Evelyn's chest.
###Chapter 302: The Blood Type Mystery

The red thread bracelet grew warm against her wrist.

Evelyn Carter stared at it for a long moment, her fingertips brushing the faded knot.

"Why are you wearing that again?" Andrew Anderson emerged from the kitchen with a teacup, his gaze dropping to her wrist.

"Mom said it brings good luck."

"Good," Andrew nodded. "You were always sick as a child. This seemed to help."

"Dad, where did you buy this?"

"That was over twenty years ago. Who remembers?" He waved a hand dismissively. "Nobody wears these anymore. Gold and silver are trendy now."

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "Does Emily have one?"

"She wasn't even born then!" Andrew suddenly remembered something. "Oh, check these bankbooks for me."

Four passbooks lay spread on the coffee table.

Evelyn verified each one. "Twenty-eight thousand and six hundred in total."

"See? I knew I remembered right." He pulled out three. "Converted to pounds, this should cover your studies abroad."

"Dad—"

"Don't argue. Consider it an investment." His voice dropped. "Why did you need the household register?"

"Visa application."

His expression relaxed. "I thought..." He trailed off, then retrieved the booklet from the bedroom. "Return it immediately after."

"Understood."

The deep red cover felt cold against her fingertips.

When the bedroom door clicked shut, she drew a deep breath.

The rustle of paper echoed sharply in the silence.

Andrew Anderson: Type O.
Grace Anderson: Type O.
Evelyn Carter: Type O.
Emily Anderson: Type O.

Her eyes lingered on the blood type column.

"Evelyn! Dinner!" Grace's voice pierced through the door.

Evelyn closed the booklet, her palms damp.

At the table, Andrew asked abruptly, "The education section still lists high school. Will that be a problem?"

"No." She picked at her greens. "The visa mainly checks residency details."

Grace handed her a bowl of soup. "You seem distracted."

"Just thinking about the hospital."

Andrew snorted. "Did you run into that Hamilton boy again? I saw him downstairs today and sent him packing."

Her spoon clinked against the bowl.

"What was he doing here?"

"What else?" Andrew slammed his chopsticks down. "I warned him to stay away!"

Evelyn sipped her soup, steam blurring her vision.

Type O was a recessive gene.

The fact circled relentlessly in her mind.

After dinner, she stood on the balcony, letting the night air cool her skin.

The breeze stirred the red thread bracelet—a silent accusation.
###Chapter 303: The Blood Type Mystery

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Carter stood dressed and ready.

She lingered at the hospital lab entrance, fingers absently tracing the blood collection tube in her white coat pocket.

"Dr. Carter, you're early," a yawning colleague greeted while unlocking the door.

"Urgent test."

"That pressing?"

"Yes."

The centrifuge hummed, spinning glass vials of blood in dizzying circles.

When the report printed, her fingertips trembled slightly.

Type A.

Those two letters stabbed into her memory like a blade.

"Dr. Carter?" Dr. Porter's voice snapped her back. "You look pale."

She folded the paper sharply. "Just low blood sugar."

"Bed 53's results aren't ready yet. Maybe rest in the lounge?"

"No need."

Once the hallway emptied, she shredded the report to confetti.

As scraps fluttered into the trash, Anthony Taylor's broken voice echoed in her mind: "We searched for our daughter over twenty years..."

......

The dean's call came unexpectedly.

"Evelyn, Hudson City needs you sooner. Can you relocate early?"

Her desk calendar still showed last week's date.

She turned a page quietly. "Understood."

Natalie Stapleton's hospital room smelled of chicken soup.

"Evelyn!" The girl's rounded cheeks glowed as she gestured to a thermos. "Mom made ginseng broth today."

Evelyn smoothed the sheets. "Your color's better."

"Dad's force-feeding me five meals daily." Natalie whispered, "I've gained five pounds."

"That's progress." She tucked in the blanket corners. "How's recovery?"

"Perfect!" Natalie suddenly gripped her hand. "The court summons arrived. Trial's next month."

The door handle turned mid-sentence.

"Mom, you're early—" Natalie's voice choked.

Simon Stapleton's greasy smile appeared in the doorway.

Evelyn blocked the bed instantly. "Get out!"

"Now, now." He rubbed his hands. "Just checking on my wife—"

"Security!"

"Unnecessary." A baritone voice interrupted. "I brought him."

Alexander Hamilton stepped inside, his tailored suit immaculate.

Simon scrambled aside. "After you, Mr. Hamilton."

Natalie clutched the sheets. "Mr. Hamilton?"

Evelyn felt the girl trembling behind her.

"My apologies." Alexander's gaze swept the room before settling on Evelyn. "May we enter?"
###Chapter 304: You—Come With Me

Natalie's fingers twisted together nervously as her gaze darted between Simon and Alexander.

"Mr. Hamilton, this..."

Alexander stood with one hand in his pocket, completely at ease. "Don't worry, Miss Stapleton. He won’t cause any trouble today."

Evelyn braced herself against the doorframe, her nails digging into the wood. "Explain yourself before you come in."

"You really want me to say it now?" Alexander leaned in slightly, his breath brushing against her ear.

Evelyn jerked back half a step. "Don't you dare—"

"I missed you."

The words hit her like a thunderclap. Her fists clenched, knuckles turning white. "Missed me? So you brought him as an excuse?"

"What else could I do?" Alexander gave a bitter smile. "You’ve been avoiding me like the plague—changing shifts, dodging me at the hospital, even steering clear of your own apartment. If I hadn’t seized this chance, would you have even looked at me?"

Evelyn scoffed. "At least you’re self-aware."

"Which is why I had to corner you here." Alexander turned to Natalie with a slight nod. "Apologies for the intrusion."

Natalie stood awkwardly to the side, her eyes flickering between them.

Simon was already pulling a stack of documents from his briefcase. "Natalie, just sign here. Mr. Hamilton said he’d handle the paperwork—we can get the divorce certificate today!"

"Really?" Natalie’s eyes lit up as she looked at Alexander. "But your mother—"

"Don’t worry," Simon cut in, rubbing his hands together eagerly. "I’ll deal with my mom. Lora can’t wait—her family’s influential, we need to hurry with the wedding—"

"Wait!" Evelyn snatched the papers from him, flipping through the pages. "Forty pages?"

Alexander leaned against the doorframe, his gaze dark. "Not everyone gets a three-minute divorce like we did."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled.

Back then, she’d mailed the signed papers and received the divorce certificate within a week. He and Annabelle had been inseparable—no doubt he’d been desperate to cut ties.

"What about the asset division?"

"Everything goes to Natalie!" Simon blurted. "I’ll walk away with nothing! Lora’s pregnant, and her family—"

"What?!" Evelyn’s head snapped up, her eyes wide as she stared at Alexander. "Lora’s pregnant?"

Alexander adjusted his cufflinks leisurely. "Want to know?"

Suddenly, he grabbed Evelyn’s wrist. The moment Natalie finished signing, he pulled Evelyn into his arms.

"Now," he said, his voice low. "Come with me."
###Chapter 305: I Don't Want What You Give

Natalie's hand trembled slightly as she held the pen, hesitating to sign.

"Evelyn..."

Evelyn met Alexander's gaze directly. "Can you guarantee this contract is foolproof?"

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted. "Don't you trust Hamilton Group's legal team?"

"Wasn't Yvonne Young also part of your legal team?"

His eyes darkened. "She's been dealt with."

"What about the two apartments she promised? Do those still stand?"

Alexander chuckled. "Are you really short on property?"

"Yes." Evelyn nodded seriously. "The locations and layouts are good."

"I thought you didn't want anything from me."

"I don't."

"Do the apartments I give come with man-eating monsters?"

"Maybe not monsters, but definitely unwanted visitors."

Alexander laughed lowly. "I'll take responsibility for the contract. Contact me if there are any issues."

Natalie whispered, "Evelyn, since Mr. Hamilton has assured us..."

Something still felt off to Evelyn.

"Mr. Hamilton, can we rephrase that?"

"Hmm?"

"I don't want to contact you."

Alexander's gaze deepened as he studied her.

Simon rubbed his hands anxiously. "Natalie, hurry up and sign. I have an important appointment this afternoon..."

"What appointment?"

Alexander said coolly, "Mr. Sun invited Simon for tea."

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat.

Lora might be a fake heiress, but Mr. Sun was a titan of the business world. Getting his attention must have cost Alexander dearly.

"Evelyn?" Natalie held out the pen.

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Sign it."

Natalie signed swiftly and pushed the agreement back. "From now on, we go our separate ways."

Simon was already dreaming of his windfall. "Don't worry, I'll pretend I don't know you if we meet. Lora gets jealous—she threw a fit for days when she found out I was married before..."

Natalie smirked. "Then I hope you two stay together forever. Don't inflict yourselves on anyone else."

Simon eagerly handed the papers to Alexander. "Mr. Hamilton, the divorce certificate..."

Alexander dialed his secretary.

After hanging up, he said flatly, "It'll be delivered to you tomorrow."

"Thank you so much!" Simon grabbed Alexander's hand excitedly. "You're the Stapleton family's savior..."

Alexander pulled his hand away in disgust. "Thank yourself. You're the one who charmed Lora into this."
###Chapter 306: Never Try to Guess a Man's Mind

Simon Stapleton rubbed his hands smugly and leaned toward Alexander Hamilton, whispering, "Mr. Hamilton, want me to teach you a few tricks? Guaranteed to win Dr. Carter back."

Alexander tilted his head slightly. "Oh?"

"Dealing with women requires strategy." Simon winked. "I'm an expert in this field."

"Simon Stapleton!" Evelyn Carter slammed the table and stood abruptly. "You're not welcome here!"

Simon flinched before pouting. "Dr. Carter, you should work on that temper. A high-value man like Mr. Hamilton giving you a second chance—you should be thrilled—"

Natalie Stapleton grabbed his collar and dragged him out. "Get lost!"

"Hey—easy there—"

The door slammed shut. Simon's fading curses echoed down the hall.

Natalie squeezed Evelyn's hand. "Evelyn..."

Evelyn forced a smile. "At least we won’t have to go through a lawsuit."

"Yeah." Natalie pulled out her phone. "I'll contact Vivian right away to liquidate those luxury items. Mr. Hamilton's secretary said the divorce certificate will be ready this afternoon."

Evelyn nodded. "Go ahead."

Before leaving, Natalie cast a worried glance at Alexander on the couch.

"Don't worry," Evelyn murmured.

As the door closed again, the air turned suffocating.

Alexander's gaze burned against her profile.

Evelyn stiffly flipped open her medical chart, the pages trembling slightly in her grip.

"Won't even look at me now?"

Her eyes remained fixed on the notes. "You came to me."

His shadow loomed over her, the familiar citrus scent enveloping her.

Only now did she realize how naive she'd been—to ever mistake him for a gentle soul. No man could dominate the business world without a ruthless core.

"Did you arrange Lora's pregnancy?"

Alexander chuckled darkly. "Finally asking?"

"Leave innocent people out of this."

"Fake." His admission was blunt. "The test results were photoshopped."

Evelyn frowned. "Simon would believe that?"

He suddenly leaned in, his breath grazing her ear. "Evelyn, you don't understand men. For some, knocking up a woman on the first try is a badge of honor. He'll be too busy gloating to question it."

His voice dropped to a dangerous murmur. "Just like I once did."
###Chapter 307: Threatening Me Again?

"I truly don't understand."

Alexander Hamilton chuckled softly. "No fault of yours. You lack experience."

"Mhm. This trip abroad will be good practice."

His gaze darkened instantly. "Evelyn, the more you say such things in anger, the more it proves you still care."

"Gold may be precious, but not everyone covets it."

Alexander sighed deeply. "Evelyn, I don't know how to handle you anymore. Kindness doesn't work, and I can't bear to be harsh. Just name your terms. If it's within my power, let's start over."

"No terms. Because it's impossible."

"There must be something." His fingers tapped lightly on the divorce papers. "Whether this document goes to the civil affairs office or the shredder depends entirely on you."

Evelyn's chest heaved violently. "You're pulling this stunt again?"

"I don't want to. But I have no choice. Crude as it is, it works."

"Have you considered that Natalie Stapleton is no relation of mine? I could easily stand aside and wait for the court's verdict."

"Of course you could." His eyes turned icy. "And I could have Lora withdraw her investment immediately."

Evelyn shot to her feet. "You—"

"Don't rush. Sit down first." Alexander took her wrist, his grip gentle but unyielding. "We finally meet. Can't we talk properly?"

She turned her face away.

He toyed with her slender fingers. "You know exactly what I mean. If you want to work abroad, I won't stop you. It's your career. I respect that."

"Then what did you come here to say?"

"Give me a chance. Don't reject me outright."

Evelyn scoffed.

"About Annabelle... I need to explain. We grew up—"

"I know all that. No need to repeat it."

He paused. "Something happened when we were children. Her mother did our family a great kindness. I'll look after her, but I won't let her interfere in my life again."

"What if she tries another approach? Like playing the tragic heroine, weeping and begging for sympathy?"

"Tragic heroines have their own devoted lovers. What's that to me?" His tone was firm. "I only promised Aunt Lin I'd ensure her daughter's wellbeing. Nothing more."

Evelyn frowned slightly. "Aunt Lin?"

"Annabelle's mother's maiden name is Taylor, but I've always called her Aunt Lin. Old habit."

She drew a slow breath. "So you're only taking care of Annabelle out of obligation?"

"Exactly. To me now, she's just Aunt Lin's daughter."

"What if Aunt Lin had other children?"

"Same treatment. Only what's necessary."

"..."

"Evelyn, why ask this?"

"No reason." She changed the subject. "Get Natalie's divorce certificate finalized quickly. Best to end this before Simon realizes he's been tricked."

Alexander nodded. "Done. Then consider my request agreed to."
###Chapter 308: Cool Down with Some Skeletons!

"Let's get the paperwork done first."

He chuckled low. "Fine."

"I'm leaving if there's nothing else."

His strong arm suddenly tightened around her waist, trapping her.

Evelyn struggled, but he only pulled her closer against his chest.

"Alexander Hamilton!" she hissed under her breath. "We're in a hospital!"

"Stop moving."

"Are you insane? Let go!"

"..." His breathing grew noticeably heavier. "Keep squirming, and you'll regret it."

She froze.

She could feel the unmistakable change in his body pressed against her.

"Six months," he rasped, voice rough. "Do you have any idea how hard I've held back?"

"Not my problem!"

"Before, I was afraid of scaring you—always restraining myself..." His lips brushed her earlobe. "Not anymore."

Thinking fast, she blurted, "I’ll take you somewhere."

"Oh?"

"Guaranteed to... cool you down."

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "Trying to run again?"

"Don’t believe me? Fine."

He smirked. "Lead the way."

She guided him down a long corridor.

"Where are we going?"

"You’ll see."

They stopped in front of a white door.

He raised a brow. "Urology?"

"Yes." She forced a neutral tone. "There are... educational tools inside."

His gaze lingered on her before he pushed the door open.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn yanked her wrist free and shoved him inside.

Bang!

The door locked behind him.

"Evelyn!" His fist pounded against the wood.

She exhaled in relief. "It’s the anatomy lab. Enjoy bonding with the skeletons!"

Silence.

Just as she frowned, her phone buzzed.

A photo from Alexander—

Him standing in front of a row of human skeletons, flashing a peace sign.

[Perfectly calm now. Care to join the tour?]

She nearly threw her phone across the hall.

This absolute menace!
###Chapter 309: Thank You, Uncle

The last rays of sunset filtered through the blinds, casting golden stripes across the desk.

Evelyn Carter was intently helping Olivia Lightfoot revise the data analysis section of her thesis.

A loud bang shattered the quiet.

The office door flew open.

Olivia sprang up like a coiled spring. "Emergency? Which bed?"

Evelyn glanced at the visitor and said calmly, "Third floor of the annex. Left at the end. Key's under the flowerpot on the windowsill."

The woman's tense shoulders visibly relaxed. "Thanks."

She turned to leave.

"Wait."

The woman paused mid-step.

"Don't forget the file folder on bedside table 54."

"Got it."

The woman disappeared as abruptly as she'd arrived.

Olivia blinked in confusion. "Dr. Carter, who was that?"

"An acquaintance."

"Family member of a former patient?"

"No."

Olivia's eyes widened. "Wait—isn't the end of the third floor the specimen room?" Then it clicked. "Oh! The new janitor from housekeeping?"

"Your literature review has issues." Evelyn tapped the screen. "Come look."

Olivia hurried over.

Evelyn massaged her temples.

She loved clinical work but loathed paperwork.

Promotion reviews required reports. Research papers demanded write-ups. Even year-end summaries needed documentation.

Just as she'd caught her breath, Olivia's thesis revisions landed on her plate.

Knowing she'd soon be leaving made her want to give this diligent intern a solid foundation.

Few attending physicians took time to mentor juniors in academic writing.

Olivia pouted. "Dr. Carter, what'll I do when you're gone?"

"You'll learn independence."

Olivia puffed her cheeks. "Then I'll apply for the next rotation transfer. Come study under you."

"Sure. I'll be waiting."

Knock-knock.

The door sounded again.

Olivia grinned. "Specimen duty's all yours!"

The woman ignored her, gaze fixed on Evelyn.

Evelyn raised a brow. "Yes?"

"Message from Mr. Hamilton."

"Go on."

"He says if you lose any more weight, you'll qualify as a medical specimen."

"......"

"Natalie Stapleton's divorce papers will be processed tomorrow morning. I'll bring them during lunch."

"Appreciate it."

Only after the woman left did Olivia process this. "Dr. Carter, how'd she know about Natalie's divorce? Is she from admin? But why would admin staff go to the specimen room?"

Evelyn tapped the keyboard. "Do you want this discussion section revised or not?"

"Ugh! I hate theses! Whoever invented them belongs on medicine's darkest page!"

......

At shift's end, Evelyn dialed home. "Mom, don't wait dinner for me."

The taxi carried her once more to Cicada Temple.

The vegetarian restaurant beside the temple exuded antique charm.

A server guided her to a private room.

Anthony Taylor and Teresa Taylor had been waiting.

Teresa's hands trembled with emotion. She tried standing but faltered, eyes glistening as she stared hungrily at Evelyn.

Anthony's eyes also reddened. Seeing his wife stumble, he rushed to steady her.

Teresa waved him off. "I'm fine. Terry's here—sit, sit! Anthony, help our daughter with her..."

Anthony moved to take Evelyn's bag.

Evelyn hung it directly on the coat hook by the door.

"Thank you, Uncle. This is fine."
###Chapter 310: The Bloodline Puzzle

The word "uncle" caught in Anthony Taylor's throat.

He opened his mouth but only managed a soft sigh. "Please, have a seat."

The private dining room felt cavernous with only the ten-seat round table occupying it.

Teresa Taylor's wheelchair stopped beside the table as Anthony pulled out two chairs for her.

Evelyn Carter's gaze lingered on the seats across from them before she walked over without hesitation.

Teresa's eyes instantly welled up.

Anthony gave his wife's shoulder a comforting pat, murmuring something inaudible.

"Have you ordered yet?"

"Not yet," Anthony's voice trembled slightly. "We weren't sure what you'd like. Terry, please order anything you want. Mom and Dad—"

Evelyn flipped open the menu, her fingers tightening imperceptibly.

The vegetarian restaurant offered exquisite dishes at premium prices.

She mechanically checked two items before pressing the service bell.

"You like tofu?" Teresa suddenly asked.

"Just random choices."

"But two of the three dishes you picked are tofu-based..."

Evelyn closed the menu. "I assume today's conversation isn't about food?"

Tears spilled down Teresa's cheeks.

"How can our first meal with our daughter be random? Anthony, go order every tofu dish on the menu!"

Anthony hurried out with red-rimmed eyes.

The delicate aroma of tea rose between them.

Evelyn stood to pour Teresa a cup.

Teresa accepted it with both hands, her fingertips visibly shaking.

"Terry," she sipped tentatively, "do you usually drink tea?"

"Occasionally."

"What do you prefer then? Coffee? Bubble tea? I'll have Anthony fetch—"

"Auntie," Evelyn met her gaze directly, "a red string bracelet proves nothing."

Silence engulfed the room.

Teresa gripped her teacup tightly before blurting out, "There's something... I hope you won't be angry."

"What is it?"

"After losing our daughter for twenty-four years, that night we saw the bracelet..." She hesitated. "We couldn't sleep. To confirm, we... took some of your hair for a DNA test."

Evelyn's fingers stilled.

"Results don't come that fast."

"We pulled strings. The report arrives tomorrow afternoon."

"My hair?" Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. "When?"

Teresa looked stricken.

"During our first meeting in the neighborhood, you hadn't seen the bracelet yet. At Cicada Temple, I don't recall shedding any."

"It was..." Teresa's voice dwindled to a whisper. "We went to your marital home with Alexander."

Evelyn suddenly laughed.

"But Annabelle lived there too. How can you be sure it was mine?"
###Chapter 311: The Secret Kept Close

"We could tell because those strands of hair weren't randomly collected."

Teresa Taylor's voice trembled slightly.

"They were stored in a... special place."

"What kind of place?"

"A ring box."

Evelyn Carter's fingertips tightened imperceptibly.

"Annabelle once mentioned that Alexander always carried a ring box with him, never letting it out of his sight. Once, out of curiosity, she tried to open it, but before she could even touch it, he caught her."

Teresa recalled the scene vividly.

"He'd never been so furious before. He scared Annabelle to tears."

Evelyn lowered her gaze.

"So Emily Zade helped you?"

"Yes, but not in the way you think."

Teresa hurried to explain.

"Emily has been loyal to Alexander all these years. But she had a good impression of you. She only agreed to help after we explained our purpose."

Evelyn frowned slightly.

"How much did you tell her?"

"Just that we wanted to run a test. Nothing else was mentioned."

The air grew heavy with silence.

"Terry, after that day at Cicada Temple, we understood..."

Teresa's voice choked with emotion.

"You didn’t want to acknowledge us. After all these years of failing to find you, it’s only natural you’d resent us..."

"I don’t resent you."

Evelyn met her eyes directly.

"I just don’t remember. In my memory, there are only my adoptive parents. They scrimped and saved to put me through school, poured everything into buying me a home. They are my real parents."

"We understand!"

Teresa nodded eagerly.

"We’ll repay them properly, including all expenses for their daughter—"

"That’s not the point."

Evelyn cut her off.

"...I know."

Teresa bowed her head.

"I have a few more questions."

Evelyn took a deep breath.

"What if the test proves I’m not your daughter?"

"Impossible! That red thread bracelet was woven by my own hands!"

"Just hypothetically."

Teresa suddenly stood up.

"May I see your forehead?"

"Why?"

"There should be a faint scar above your left brow. You got it when you fell at four years old."

Evelyn froze in place.

"It seems you already have your answer."

Teresa smiled bitterly as she sat back down.

"What’s your second question?"

"How old was your daughter when she went missing?"

"Four years and three months."

"At that age, she should have had memories."

Evelyn’s voice was soft.

"But I have no recollection of you at all. Only my adoptive parents."

Tears finally spilled down Teresa’s cheeks.

"That’s what pains me most. Back then, we turned H City upside down, checked every mode of transportation..."

Her voice grew fainter.

"It was as if you’d vanished into thin air."
###Chapter 312: The Only Request

The private investigator's report remains vividly etched in my mind.

"A four-year-old missing for this long was most likely abducted," he told us back then.

But all we received was endless silence.

Three months later, the police gently suggested there was little hope.

Teresa Taylor suddenly broke down, covering her face as tears streamed through her fingers.

Anthony Taylor quickly stepped forward, pulling his wife into his arms. "Don't cry. Our daughter has returned. That's a good thing..."

"It's all my fault," Teresa's voice shattered. "If only I'd watched her more closely that day..."

Anthony patted his wife's back, his own eyes red-rimmed when he turned to me. "She almost... all these years... Thank goodness we adopted Annabelle later..."

The teacup trembled slightly in my hand, spilling droplets onto the table.

I pulled out a tissue and mechanically wiped the surface.

"One last question."

"Go ahead."

"Did Alexander Hamilton and I know each other as children?"

Anthony froze. "We moved next to the Hamiltons a year after adopting Annabelle."

He paused. "Alexander was very excited back then, talking about some promise... Later, he treated Annabelle exceptionally well..."

"He mistook her for me?"

"...Possibly. Annabelle wore all your old clothes..."

I took a deep breath, my chest heavy as if weighed down by a stone.

"What's wrong?" Anthony asked with concern.

"Nothing."

"There are no outsiders here. You can say anything."

"Aside from Emily Zade, who else knows my true identity?"

"Not for now. But once the paternity test results come out, we must—"

"No need." I cut him off. "I have just one request."

"Name it."

"Keep this secret. Forever."
###Chapter 313: The Fork in Fate

Anthony Taylor's hands trembled slightly. "Sweetheart, are you blaming us?"

Teresa Taylor's tears soaked her collar. "I know I was wrong. I've regretted it every single day. You can hate me, but please don't deny us..."

"My current parents have been wonderful to me." I gripped my water glass. "They sacrificed everything to raise me. I won't let them suffer the pain of losing a daughter in their old age."

Teresa clutched my wrist desperately. "But blood ties can't be severed!"

"Blood matters, but the debt of upbringing matters more."

Silence filled the private dining room.

Teresa suddenly remembered something. "What about Alexander? You two were perfect for each other..."

"We're over." I cut her off. "Some fractures can never be mended."

Anthony slammed his teacdown with force. "Fine! We respect your decision."

Teresa stared at her husband in disbelief.

"But one request," Anthony's voice cracked. "Could we...see you sometimes?"

"I'm leaving for further studies in the UK."

Teresa's glass shattered on the floor.

"When?" Anthony's words shook.

"Next month."

Teresa beat her own thighs in anguish. "These useless legs! I can't even visit my own daughter..."

Anthony knelt beside her, clasping her hands. "I'll carry you onto planes. I'll wheel you around the world. Anywhere you want to go."

Watching this couple past their prime, my chest tightened.

"We can video call." The words escaped before I realized.

Teresa jerked her head up, tears still glistening. "Really?"

"Medical work keeps me busy. It won't be frequent."

Tears turned to tremulous smiles. "Yes, yes! You focus on your career. Just seeing your face would be enough..."

Waiters began serving, covering the table with exquisite dishes.

Anthony's unsteady hands placed food on my plate. "Try this. Your father remembers how much you loved fish as a child..."

"Terry," Teresa ventured timidly, "before you leave...could you come home for one meal?"

Surveying the lavish spread, I gave a small nod.
###Chapter 314 The Perfect Distance

Evelyn set down her chopsticks and said softly, "I might not make it in time."

"I see..."

"Yeah."

Teresa smiled gently. "It's alright. We can have it when you return."

"...We'll see."

"Or perhaps your father could cook for you abroad?" Teresa's eyes sparkled with hope. "Foreign food never quite compares to home cooking."

Anthony immediately chimed in, "Yes, your mother and I could come take care of you. Don't worry—we won't disturb your work. Just cooking and tidying up."

The sudden outpouring of familial affection caught Evelyn off guard.

Her silence made Anthony and Teresa tread even more carefully. They hesitated to even pick up food, afraid of displeasing her.

The meal was unusually tense.

As they left, Anthony asked the server to pack the leftovers. "You can reheat these later. Saves you the trouble of cooking."

"My mom prepares dinner every day."

Anthony's hand froze mid-air. He forced an awkward smile. "Right. I forgot you go home for meals."

"Yeah."

"Then... we'll take them." He quickly backtracked, anxious not to upset her. "No pressure at all."

Evelyn asked, "Are you heading back to the hospital?"

"Yes. Annabelle is still recovering—her injuries were quite severe..." Teresa hurried to explain, "Evelyn, please don't misunderstand. You're our biological daughter—that will never change. But we raised Annabelle, and now that Alexander has abandoned her, we can't just turn our backs."

"I don't mind." Evelyn picked up her bag. "Take care of her. I should go."

...

In the following days, Teresa sent daily morning and evening texts.

Simple messages—just asking if work was busy or if she was tired.

During lunch breaks in the cafeteria, Evelyn often spotted Anthony from a distance. If their eyes met, he'd smile and nod.

They maintained the perfect distance.

Evelyn breathed a quiet sigh of relief. It seemed they'd taken her words to heart.

She didn’t want her current life disrupted, and they understood boundaries.

At home, everything remained normal. Grace cooked her favorite dishes with creative flair. Andrew insisted she take extra money. Emily clung to her, crying like a child. "Sis, you and Peter are both leaving. When school starts, I’ll be all alone..."

Grace comforted, "Your dad and I will be with you."

"I know," Emily sniffled. "I just don’t want to say goodbye to my sister."

Andrew chuckled and shook his head. "No backbone! Your sister handled college all on her own."

"How can I compare to her? She’s my one and only sister!"

Evelyn hugged her sister, a sudden ache in her chest. "I’ll visit when I can. You can come see me during summer break."

"Really?" Emily’s eyes lit up. "I’ll definitely go!"

Grace hesitated. "International flights aren’t cheap, and your school expenses..."

Evelyn gently nudged her mother’s arm.

But Andrew said firmly, "Evelyn, your sister’s grown up. She needs to face reality."

Evelyn understood.

Yet she still wanted to shield Emily from life’s storms.

This time, Emily surprised her with maturity. "It’s okay, sis. If I can’t visit, you’ll come back for New Year’s, right? We’ll celebrate as a family."
###Chapter 315: So I Was the Fool All Along

"Evelyn, the overseas assignment pays double! Come visit me this summer—I'll cover all your expenses."

Emily Anderson shook her head like a windmill. "No way! You work so hard for that money. I'll just video call you."

Evelyn Carter ruffled her sister's hair. "My little girl's growing up."

After dinner, Emily insisted on going home with her.

The girl had always been clingy, trailing after her like a shadow since childhood.

Evelyn's heart softened, and she took her sister back to the apartment.

Late at night, Emily curled up against her, voice muffled. "Evelyn... he came to see me today."

"Hmm?"

"My... ex-boyfriend."

It took Evelyn a moment to remember—the boy who'd nearly torn Emily from their family.

Strange how she'd already forgotten his name when it hadn't been that long.

"What did he say?"

Emily scoffed. "Called me a gold-digger for not following him to Beijing. Said I'd regret it when he made it big."

"How do you feel?"

Emily burrowed deeper into her embrace. "At first I was upset—like I'd given up too soon. Then I realized... what's love compared to having you, Mom, Dad, and my best friends? Wouldn't I be an idiot to abandon you all for some guy?"

Evelyn patted her back. "I'm not the best person for relationship advice."

"Are you kidding?" Emily lifted her face. "You married Alexander, then dated Peter! You're practically an expert!"

Evelyn smiled bitterly.

Her marriage to Alexander Hamilton had fast-forwarded straight to polite coexistence—they'd never even properly dated.

As for Peter Harrison...

That was nothing but an elaborate con.

If she hadn't kept her wits about her, she'd be worse off than Natalie Stapleton by now.

"Honestly, I envy you. Getting to experience pure love at your age."

"Regretting not dating in high school?"

"Not regret... just acknowledging life's trade-offs."

"Like what happened to Vivian? Destroying herself for love?"

Evelyn pinched her sister's cheek. "You got lucky—that boy was amateur hour."

Emily blinked smugly. "Or maybe I was just too smart for him?"

"Well..."

"Evelyn! I'm your sister! I might not be as brilliant as you, but I'm not far behind!"

Studying Emily's bright eyes, Evelyn felt a sudden disorientation.

She resembled their mother—gentle and delicate.

Emily took after their father, with round cheeks and an endearing playfulness.

Ding—

A phone notification chimed.

Probably Teresa Taylor's nightly check-in.

Emily grabbed the device lightning-fast. "Who is it?"

Evelyn tensed. "Probably the hospital..."

"Nope." Emily waved the glowing screen. "Someone named Alexander Hamilton."
###Chapter 316: Karma

"It's a message from Vivian."

Emily handed over her phone.

A single line of text glowed on the screen:
[Vivian: Evelyn, call me ASAP.]

Evelyn took the phone and strode toward the balcony. "Rest for now. I need to make a call."

The call connected instantly.

Vivian's voice carried unusual gravity. "Something terrible happened."

"What is it?"

"Simon's mother is dead."

Evelyn's grip tightened around the phone. "When?"

"This afternoon. After Lora disappeared, the people Simon scammed came for him. He'd taken bribes pretending to be Oceanic Group's son-in-law. Now that the engagement's off..."

Evelyn glanced at the inky darkness beyond the window.

Despite the summer heat, a chill ran down her spine.

"Those people..."

"Took his mother hostage. Things went wrong." Vivian paused. "She died on the spot."

Evelyn drew a sharp breath. "Did they call the police?"

"He wouldn't dare. The fraud charges alone would put him away for life."

"How could he be so reckless? Even if he'd married into the Hardy family, old Mr. Hardy would never let him control anything."

Vivian scoffed. "Conning women became second nature to him. Pregnancy, marriage, extortion—his usual playbook. Natalie was too easy. He started thinking all women were that gullible."

"Now that he's desperate, do you think—"

"He'll go after Natalie?" Vivian snorted. "The hospital director's waiting for him. So are his creditors."

Silence stretched between them.

"Are you okay?" Evelyn asked softly.

"Couldn't be better. Justice is served." Yet exhaustion laced Vivian's words.

"But you don't sound happy."

"..." A long sigh. "Ten years ago, I might've set off fireworks to celebrate. But now..."

Her voice faded. "My college entrance exams... my future... none of that can be undone."

"You saved Natalie."

"I saved my younger self." Vivian suddenly laughed. "By the way, Dad's sixtieth birthday is this weekend. You're coming."

"I'll be there."

Hanging up, Evelyn gazed at the distant city lights.

Karma always collects its due.

But the price it exacts sometimes cuts too deep.
###Chapter 317: The Birthday Banquet

The Dempsey villa was adorned with festive decorations on Saturday.

Evelyn Carter arrived half an hour early. The Dempsey servants bustled about, arranging trays as they prepared the venue.

Vivian Dempsey wore a lilac mermaid gown, her curls elegantly pinned up, makeup flawless—yet she looked utterly wilted, like frostbitten foliage.

"Evelyn!" Her eyes brightened at the sight of her friend.

Evelyn handed her a meticulously wrapped gift box.

"Wow, a Tudor watch?" Vivian weighed it in her palm. "This is too extravagant."

"It's only right." Evelyn studied her. "Why so glum?"

Vivian tugged at her skirt. "See this dress?"

"It suits you."

"That's not the point!" Vivian groaned dramatically. "My dad suddenly decided to throw a sixtieth birthday bash. Doesn't that strike you as odd? He's at the gym every day, more energetic than I am."

Evelyn's eyes widened in realization. "A matchmaking event?"

Vivian looked ready to cry. "Bingo."

"Parents will be parents." Evelyn patted her shoulder in consolation.

Vivian suddenly lowered her voice. "By the way, Dad mentioned Alexander Hamilton was injured and couldn't make it. When did that happen?"

Evelyn's smile froze. "I wouldn't know."

"You haven't contacted him?"

"Blocked."

"Strange." Vivian frowned. "That doesn't sound like him."

Guests began arriving in steady streams.

Amid the glittering crowd, Evelyn recognized several business elites.

Mr. Dempsey dragged his daughter around, enthusiastically introducing her to every eligible bachelor. Vivian looked utterly defeated, casting desperate glances toward Evelyn.

Evelyn retreated to a corner with her orange juice, searching for an opportunity to rescue her friend when a familiar grip closed around her wrist.

"Don't move."

The voice sent a jolt through her.

Alexander Hamilton settled beside her, leisurely adjusting his cufflinks. "Surprised?"

"You said you weren't coming."

"Changed my mind."

Just then, Anthony Taylor wheeled Teresa Taylor into the room. The couple, dressed impeccably, lit up at the sight of Evelyn. "Evel— Oh, Alexander's here too."
###Chapter 318: Scars

Alexander Hamilton clearly didn't expect to encounter Anthony and Teresa Taylor here. He gave a slight bow. "Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor."

Teresa's smile was strained, her gaze fixed on Evelyn Carter. She tentatively reached out. "Why are you dressed so lightly? You'll catch a cold."

Without hesitation, Anthony removed his suit jacket. "Here, put this on."

Evelyn stared at the offered garment but didn't take it.

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "You know each other?"

"They came to apologize for Annabelle," Evelyn said flatly.

Anthony rubbed his hands together. "Yes, yes, Annabelle was wrong..."

Alexander suddenly stepped forward, shielding Evelyn. He coldly pushed the jacket away. "I said this matter ends here."

"Alexander, we just wanted—"

"Unnecessary." His voice was icy. "Evelyn has no connection to you."

Teresa's eyes reddened. "We only care about your wellbeing..."

"My affairs are none of your concern."

Anthony suddenly chuckled. "Fine. Young people should resolve their own issues."

The atmosphere grew tense.

Evelyn broke the silence. "How is Annabelle's recovery progressing?"

"Her physical wounds have mostly healed," Anthony sighed. "But mentally..."

Alexander scoffed. "Guilt does that."

"Has she seen a psychiatrist?"

"We consulted specialists. They recommended rest." Anthony glanced uneasily at Alexander.

Evelyn nodded. "The psychiatric department at Central Hospital is excellent."

"Yes, yes."

Teresa suddenly remembered something. "Alexander, we heard you were injured?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Just a scratch."

"Where? Your mother is worried."

"...My leg."

"Can you walk?"

"I can."

Teresa exhaled in relief. "Good. You should keep your elders informed."

Alexander murmured a barely audible "Mm" in response.
###Chapter 319: Undercurrents

Anthony Taylor wore a gentle smile as he patted his wife's hand. "Let the young ones talk. We'd only make them uncomfortable. Uncle Dempsey mentioned wanting to see you earlier. Shall I take you to him?"

Teresa Taylor's gaze lingered on Evelyn Carter for a few seconds, hesitation flickering in her eyes. "Evelyn, we'll be back shortly."

Evelyn noticed the unspoken words trembling on Teresa's lips before they vanished.

"Alright."

As the couple walked away, Alexander Hamilton frowned. "They approached you privately?"

"Yes."

"What did they say?"

Evelyn swirled her orange juice, watching condensation slide down the glass. "Exactly what you'd expect."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Ignore them. Annabelle is their only daughter—spoiled rotten since childhood. If they bother you again, tell me immediately."

"Unnecessary." Evelyn's tone was flat. "I'm leaving the country soon. None of this matters."

Alexander stiffened. "You—"

Evelyn took a deliberate step back, eyes sharp with caution.

He chuckled dryly. "That defensive?"

"Precautionary measures."

"..."

"How was your quality time with the skeletons last time?"

Alexander's knuckles whitened, his voice rough. "What do you think?"

"I heard they remained perfectly still—not even a speck of dust disturbed." Evelyn arched a brow. "How... gentlemanly of you."

His eyes narrowed. "Don't pull that stunt again."

"Why not?"

"Do you want to be a widow?"

"I'll soon be free." A faint smile touched her lips. "They say Western culture is quite... liberal. If I feel inclined—"

"Trying to provoke me?" Alexander cut in.

"You overestimate your importance."

He smirked coldly. "Believe what you want. Just remember to protect yourself."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

"Miss Carter—"

A flustered maid rushed over—the same one who'd earlier helped Vivian Dempsey adjust her gown.

"Here." Evelyn stood.

The maid wrung her hands. "Miss Carter, come quickly! Something's happened to Miss Vivian—"

"Another argument with Uncle Dempsey?"

"Worse!" The maid stamped her foot. "Hurry!"

Evelyn moved instantly.

Alexander stepped forward, but the maid blocked him. "Mr. Hamilton, it's better if you don't."

Evelyn glanced back. "Vivian's furious. Your presence would escalate things."

Understanding dawned. "Call me if needed."

"Mm."

The maid tugged Evelyn's sleeve. "Quickly! There's no time!"
###Chapter 320: Nightmare in the Dark

The bamboo forest rustled with an eerie whisper.

Evelyn Carter was dragged through the corridor by a maid, her high heels clicking frantically against the stone pavement.

"Where are you taking me?"

The maid didn’t answer, only tightening her grip on Evelyn’s wrist.

At the edge of the bamboo grove lay the abandoned old dock of the Dempsey family. The briny sea wind slapped against Evelyn’s face.

She yanked her hand free and turned to run.

"Ah—"

A sharp pain pierced the back of her neck.

Staggering, she collapsed to the ground as her vision blurred.

…

The pungent stench of fish invaded her nostrils.

Evelyn struggled to open her eyes, finding her hands bound behind her back with coarse rope, her delicate wrists already raw and bleeding.

In the dimly lit cabin, two men were murmuring.

"Have you lost your mind? Kidnapping someone from the Hamiltons!"

"Who cares?" Simon Stapleton crushed his cigarette underfoot. "I’ve got nothing left to lose."

The ember traced a crimson arc in the darkness.

Evelyn held her breath, nails digging into her palms.

"Alexander will find us soon," Peter Harrison warned in a hushed voice. "We should—"

"I’m counting on it!" Simon suddenly roared, kicking over a nearby oil drum. "See that? Twenty barrels of gasoline!"

Thick liquid seeped through the cracks in the deck.

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine.

"You—" Peter’s voice trembled. "You’re planning to die together?"

Simon threw his head back with a manic laugh. "I want Alexander to watch his beloved—"

BANG!

The cabin door burst open with a violent crash.

Blinding floodlights flooded the space.

"Police! Freeze!"

Simon’s face twisted. He snatched up a machete and lunged at Evelyn.

"Stay back! Or I’ll—"

BANG!

A gunshot split the night.

Clutching his shoulder, Simon dropped to his knees. The machete clattered at Evelyn’s feet.

"Evelyn!"

The familiar voice made her eyes well up instantly.

Alexander Hamilton charged in, his suit stained with blood. He tore off the ropes and pulled her into a crushing embrace.

"It’s over now. You’re safe..."

Shivering in his arms, Evelyn suddenly caught sight of Simon’s grotesque smile.

"Look out!"

With his last ounce of strength, Simon pressed the detonator.

BOOM—

A towering inferno swallowed the entire dock.
###Chapter 321: You Taught Him?

The cramped cabin reeked of fish.

"Achoo—"

Evelyn sneezed from the overpowering stench.

The sound alerted the two men outside. The glow of a cigarette flickered as footsteps approached.

Blinding white light suddenly flooded in.

Evelyn instinctively squeezed her eyes shut.

"Awake?"

Simon crouched before her, his smile chilling. "Definitely prettier than Annabelle."

Gritting through the discomfort, Evelyn slowly opened her eyes.

The dilapidated cabin was cluttered with fishing gear. The stagnant water beneath her emitted a putrid odor. Her dress clung damply to her legs.

A frigid gust of wind pierced through her.

"Ah!"

A searing cigarette tip pressed into her neck.

Simon withdrew his hand with a vicious grin. "Even the great Dr. Carter feels pain? Always acted so high and mighty in school. Look at you now."

The burn made Evelyn gasp.

Her gaze shifted to Peter Harrison.

The man stood immaculate in his tailored suit, his hair perfectly groomed—utterly out of place in this filthy environment.

While Simon—

Grime-streaked T-shirt, mud-splattered jeans, even the cigarette between his fingers was coated in ash.

"What're you staring at?" Simon suddenly grabbed her chin. "Think I'm disgusting?"

Evelyn smirked. "You're not worth the effort."

"Looking to die?" Simon's face twisted. "I'll toss you to the sharks right now!"

"You think Alexander won't trace it back?" Evelyn turned to Peter. "Is ruining your future for trash like him worth it?"

Peter frowned deeply. "I had no part in this."

"Really?"

"Evelyn, I swear—"

"Peter!" Simon roared. "Who swore we'd be brothers for life? Who taught me to climb using women? Now you're cutting ties?!"

Evelyn's pupils constricted. "You taught him?"

Peter's expression darkened.

"How long have you known each other?" Her voice trembled. "Were you involved in what happened to Vivian too?!"
###Chapter 322: Can't You Use Your Brain?

Simon Stapleton doubled over with laughter, slapping Peter Harrison's shoulder hard. "Evelyn, finally seeing through your dear brother's true colors? If he weren't so plain-looking, he'd have made his move on you himself."

Evelyn Carter felt a tightness in her chest.

Beyond shock, it was a moment of painful clarity.

She'd always sensed something off about Peter.

Memories flashed through her mind like a revolving lantern. She'd assumed he'd merely picked up some dirty tricks from Simon. Never imagined he was the mastermind—even Vivian Dempsey's heartbreak in high school traced back to him.

"Just answer me one thing," Evelyn's voice trembled. "Did you orchestrate what happened to Vivian?"

Peter remained silent.

Simon blew smoke rings, smirking. "Evelyn, you're so dense. Peter showered you with attention in high school, and you ignored him. Yet when I used his methods on Vivian, she fell for it instantly."

Evelyn clenched her fists. "You two were in this together?"

"Not exactly." Simon flicked ash. "But he did inspire me. Helped me secure that recommendation to Hudson University."

Peter's hands subtly tightened into fists.

The slight movement didn't escape Evelyn—it only deepened her disgust.

"You hurt Vivian for a college spot. Then what was Peter's angle with me? He was two grades above us."

Simon scoffed. "The math competition, obviously! His senior year, winning could've gotten him into an elite school. But the faculty chose you—a mere freshman."

The floodgates of memory burst open.

She had represented their school in a math competition freshman year.

So that was it.

Evelyn let out a low, bitter laugh. "My apologies, Peter. Seems I was born without a romantic bone in my body."

Peter's tense posture suddenly relaxed. "No matter. Senior year didn't work out, but there's always now."

"You think that's possible?"

"You're desperate to break free from Alexander Hamilton." Peter met her gaze squarely. "Since you've seen through me, I'll drop the act. Though I must say, Evelyn, you're sharper than I expected."

"Don't flatter me." Her voice was ice. "I know the kidnapping was your solo project, Simon."

Peter's lips curled in approval.

Simon crushed his cigarette violently. "You still trust him? He's a damn fox!"

"Simon," Evelyn sighed. "Use your brain for once. Kidnapping me from the Dempseys—do you really think Alexander would let it slide? That the Dempseys wouldn't come after you? Every security camera along the way, every witness—even that maid you bribed. You think money will keep her silent when the Dempseys can make her talk?"
###Chapter 323 Alexander Obeys Your Every Word

Simon Stapleton abruptly stood up, his chair screeching across the floor.

His face twisted with fury, eyes burning like flames.

"Every piece of evidence is against you—surveillance footage, fingerprints, call logs. If anything happens to me, Alexander Hamilton and the Dempseys will hunt you to the ends of the earth." Evelyn Carter's voice was ice-cold. "Uncle Dempsey despises you. He won't show mercy this time."

Simon let out a chilling laugh. "Then we'll die together! What can the Dempseys do to me?"

"Do you really want to die?"

His smile froze.

"If the loan sharks wanted you dead, they could've done it easily. Why go through the trouble of kidnapping me?" Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "You still want to live, don't you?"

Simon burst into hysterical laughter. "Now I understand why Alexander chose you. That idiot Annabelle could never compare."

"So, what's your choice?" Evelyn raised her bound wrists slightly. "Throw me into the ocean now and face the Dempseys' wrath, or untie me. I might consider helping you."

Peter Harrison had quietly moved closer, reaching for Evelyn's ropes. "The Dempseys have no quarrel with me. As for Alexander, if you testify that I wasn't involved—"

Simon shoved him violently. "You think you can walk away?!"

"I've helped you plenty." Peter calmly adjusted his cuffs. "With Vivian Dempsey, with Natalie Stapleton—haven't you benefited enough?"

A brutal punch landed on Peter's face.

"You bastard!" Simon grabbed his collar. "You think Alexander will spare you? You touched his woman—he'll kill you sooner or later!"

Peter wiped blood from his lip, his eyes darkening. "Maybe before. But now, he won't lay a hand on me in front of Evelyn."

"Ha! You think she still cares about you?"

"Whether she does or not doesn't matter." Peter smirked. "What matters is Alexander doesn't want her to see his violent side. If he hurts me, he'll lose her forever."

Simon's expression grew uglier. "I see... No wonder you dared to mess with Alexander's woman! But what about me? I'm backed into a corner! If I hadn't kidnapped her, those loan sharks would've killed me!"

"I warned you not to borrow from them." Peter flexed his injured jaw.

"Bullshit!" Simon screamed hysterically. "Lora wanted designer bags, fine dining—how else was I supposed to impress her? This was all Alexander's trap! And you—"

He pointed a trembling finger at Evelyn, veins bulging in his eyes. "Alexander obeys your every word! You're the mastermind behind all this!"
###Chapter 324: Mutual Destruction

"It was me." Evelyn Carter met Simon Stapleton's bloodshot eyes without flinching. "You destroyed my best friend. You should've seen this coming."

Simon grabbed her throat. "Vivian deserved it!"

"Deserved what? For loving a monster like you?" Evelyn's laugh was icy. "Now you're trying to ruin Natalie. I won't let that happen."

"Natalie?" Simon released her, bursting into sudden laughter. "That idiot threw herself at me. I was just having some fun."

"She's not an idiot. She truly loved you."

Simon's grin froze.

"She thought she'd found real love, but you only wanted her family's money." Evelyn spoke each word deliberately. "Simon Stapleton, scum like you belongs in hell."

"Shut up!"

Simon yanked her hair, dragging her toward the deck. The fishing boat rocked violently as waves crashed against the hull.

"See this ocean?" He forced her head toward the black water. "If I don't make it, neither will you. When Alexander finds you, all he'll get is fish food!"

Peter Harrison rushed forward. "Calm down! Alexander's almost here—"

"Back off!" Simon shoved him away. "I've got nothing left to lose!"

Peter checked his watch. "Take her as leverage. Demand enough money to start fresh abroad. I can get you out using my assistant's passport."

Simon's eyes flickered. With a twisted smile, he hauled Evelyn back into the cabin.

"What are you—"

The stench of gasoline flooded the space. Evelyn coughed violently as the liquid soaked through her clothes.

Simon strode out. The sound of splashing liquid followed. Then the cabin door slammed shut with a final thud.

"You're insane!" Peter's muffled voice came through the walls.

"This'll make Alexander pay up fast." Simon's tone was unhinged. "With multiple boats burning, he'll never know which one she's on. One delay, and he collects ashes!"

WHOOSH—

Flames engulfed the vessel instantly. Thick smoke billowed as scorching heat rolled through the cabin.

Evelyn curled in a corner, watching fire lick across every surface. Each breath seared her lungs like swallowing molten blades.

Through the inferno, she almost saw Alexander's desperate face.
###Chapter 325: Annabelle's Appearance

Flames licked hungrily at the wooden cabin walls, crackling with violent intensity.

Thick smoke billowed into the confined space, blurring Evelyn Carter's vision. She coughed violently, her throat raw as if scraped by sandpaper.

The ropes binding her wrists dug deeper, breaking skin.

"Evelyn—"

Vivian Dempsey's voice pierced through the suffocating haze.

"Terry! Answer me!"

Anthony Taylor's cry trembled with desperation.

Evelyn dragged herself to the cabin door, slamming her shoulder against it. The entire ship shuddered from the impact.

"How do we search all these boats?" Anthony's voice cracked. "Terry..."

Vivian's tone turned razor-sharp. "Alexander Hamilton, was the wire transfer completed?"

"It was."

Alexander's reply could have frozen hell itself.

"Then why did Simon— damn it! He blocked my number!"

Anthony's sobs came in broken gasps. "Alexander, think of something—"

"Dad, don't panic." A soft female voice suddenly interjected. "The fire department is almost here."

Evelyn froze.

That voice... Annabelle?

Wasn't she supposed to be hospitalized?

"Too slow." Alexander's voice held finality. "I'm going in."

"I'll come with you!"

"Unnecessary."

"I know you hate me." Annabelle's voice quivered. "But extra hands mean better odds. If Dr. Carter is hurt—"

"..."

Vivian cut in sharply. "I'll take the left side, Alexander the right. Miss Taylor, cover the central area."

"Understood." Annabelle responded without hesitation. "I won't hold back."

Anthony's anguished wails echoed in the distance.

Evelyn threw her weight against the door again, her hoarse cries barely audible.

Then—footsteps halted outside.

"Dr. Carter?"

Evelyn mustered a guttural response.

The door creaked open a sliver.

Annabelle's face appeared in the gap. Clad in a dark trench coat, her expression was unreadable.
###Chapter 326 Life Hanging by a Thread

Evelyn's fingers scraped against the deck, leaving streaks of blood.

She opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

Annabelle crouched before her, eyes tracing the ropes binding her wrists and ankles. "So you're tied up."

"Annabelle—"

Alexander's voice grew closer.

Evelyn strained every muscle to inch toward the cabin door.

A hand clamped down on her shoulder.

She looked up into Annabelle's eyes—cold and venomous.

Bang!

The cabin door slammed shut.

The click of the lock echoed sharply.

"Did you find her?"

"Don't open it!" Annabelle's voice trembled with false tears. "It's full of fire inside. Dr. Carter isn't there—"

The deck vibrated.

Alexander had boarded the ship.

"Are you sure?"

"I saw it myself. The cabin's empty." Annabelle spoke rapidly. "The flames are spreading. We need to hurry—"

Vivian's footsteps approached. "Any sign of her?"

"Nothing." Annabelle's tone was final. "Let's check the other side."

A heavy silence followed.

"Alexander?" Annabelle gasped suddenly. "That boat! I heard something!"

Footsteps scattered into the distance.

Evelyn stared at the cabin ceiling.

Flames licked at the beams above.

The realization struck her.

Simon was never the only one behind this kidnapping.

Smoke filled her lungs.

Her consciousness wavered.

A final thought flickered—

Even quails can peck.
###Chapter 327: Between Life and Death

Boom—

A deafening explosion tore through the air.

"Evelyn!!"

Who was calling her?

"Alexander, are you insane?! The fire's too intense—you'll die if you go back in!"

"Get out of my way!"

She felt herself lifted by the thick smoke, light as a feather. Strong arms wrapped around her, the familiar scent of pine mingling with the acrid smell of burning filling her nostrils.

A biting chill jolted her awake.

Her eyes fluttered open to blinding white. The sterile scent of disinfectant told her she was in a hospital.

"Evelyn!"

Vivian Dempsey rushed to the bedside, her eyes swollen like peaches. "You scared me to death! Do you have any idea?!"

She tried to speak, but her throat burned as if sliced by knives.

Vivian immediately pressed her hand down. "Don't talk! The doctor said your airways are severely damaged." She fumbled around frantically. "I brought warm water and glucose for you..."

The sound of hurried footsteps echoed outside.

The room was suddenly packed.

Evelyn's gaze swept over each face.

Anthony Taylor stood there, guilt-ridden. Olivia Lightfoot paced anxiously. Natalie Stapleton sobbed uncontrollably. "Evelyn, it's all my fault..."

She shook her head gently.

Vivian spoke for her. "Simon Stapleton is a madman. Who could've guessed he'd set the fire? My dad's already investigating who lured you to the backyard."

"My father arranged for the best pulmonologist," Natalie choked out. "You have to get better."

Her eyes traveled past the crowd.

Alexander Hamilton stood at the front, his suit charred and tattered. His exposed arms bore gruesome burns, his right cheek blackened.

Annabelle Taylor hid behind him, her clothes merely dusted with ash. "Alexander nearly died saving you."

Evelyn smirked coldly.

"His throat is injured too," Annabelle continued, "but he insisted on staying with you."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed, his voice hoarse. "Does it hurt?"

Vivian cut in. "She can't speak right now. Go treat your wounds first—they're practically cooked."

He didn't move.

His scorching gaze remained locked on her.
###Chapter 328: Questions for Alexander

Evelyn's gaze lingered on Alexander's face before shifting to Annabelle.

Annabelle squirmed under her scrutiny. "I'm glad you're okay, Dr. Carter," she said hastily. "I...I'm not feeling well..."

Anthony Taylor immediately supported her. "I told you not to go, but you wouldn't listen."

"Someone had to represent our family at Uncle Dempsey's birthday banquet," Annabelle murmured. "I should share the responsibilities."

Anthony patted her hand approvingly. "You've matured."

"I was too selfish before. Because of me, Alexander and Dr. Carter divorced, and you had to worry..."

"Let's not dwell on the past. This time Alexander saved Dr. Carter. Maybe there's still hope for them."

Annabelle lowered her lashes. "If they reconcile, Grandma Hamilton can rest in peace."

"Go check on your mother."

"Okay."

Vivian Dempsey leaned close to Evelyn, whispering, "Annabelle was terrified by Grandma Hamilton's ghost. She even helped search for you today."

Evelyn's eyes flickered.

"Really," Vivian insisted earnestly. "Grandma Hamilton's spirit is watching over you."

Evelyn's lashes trembled slightly.

"Alexander nearly got himself killed looking for you," Vivian continued. "The fire was raging, but he searched every boat. His back was burned when he found you."

Evelyn's lips moved with difficulty.

"What?" Vivian asked.

"She wants her phone," Alexander said.

"Yours was destroyed in the fire." Vivian frowned. "Do you need to contact your parents?"

Alexander handed over his own phone. "She needs to type."

With shaking fingers, Evelyn typed:
[Do my parents know?]

"We didn't tell them," Vivian said quickly. "We didn't want them to worry."

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"But your injuries..." Vivian hesitated. "Your plans to go abroad might need to be postponed."

Evelyn closed her eyes briefly in understanding.

[You should all go rest.]

"No way!" Vivian refused flatly. "You're seriously hurt—"

[I need to talk to Alexander.]

Vivian caught on. "Want me to leave?"

At Evelyn's nod, she stood. "I'll be right outside." Turning to Anthony, she added, "Uncle, let me walk you out."

The room finally quieted.

Alexander bent closer. "What do you want to ask?"

Evelyn typed slowly:
[Peter told you?]

Alexander's eyes flickered. "Yes."

A bitter smile touched her lips.

Of course.

[What did he want in return?]

"He wouldn't dare." Alexander's voice turned icy. "He crossed a line this time. All he wants now is to save himself."
###Chapter 329: Kicking Me Out Again?

Evelyn Carter leaned against the hospital bed, her fingers lightly tapping the phone screen.

Peter Harrison had truly outsmarted himself this time. Despite all his scheming, he never expected Simon Stapleton to go this far. Now he'd offended both the Hamiltons and her—he must be wishing the ground would swallow him whole.

"Still feeling unwell?" Alexander Hamilton sat beside the bed, reaching to check her forehead.

Evelyn instinctively flinched away.

"I just washed my hands." He withdrew, his voice hoarse. "They're clean."

She pressed her lips together and typed: [I want to sit up.]

Alexander moved to the foot of the bed and cranked the handle. The bed gradually elevated, adjusting her into a semi-seated position.

"Is this angle okay?"

She nodded.

"Let me know if you need anything."

[Don’t tell my parents.]

"The Dempseys have been informed. This won’t spread further." He paused. "But this time, a simple 'thank you' won’t cut it."

He rolled up his sleeve, revealing the bandaged wound.

[Ask Vivian to stay with me.]

Alexander arched a brow. "Kicking me out again?"

[Your injury needs treatment.]

After a brief silence, he stood. "Fine. I’ll call her."

When Vivian Dempsey burst in, she was still ranting into her phone.

"My dad caught that maid!" She plopped down angrily. "For just five thousand bucks, she helped Simon hurt you!"

Evelyn patted the space beside her.

Vivian shook her head. "I’ll stay here—don’t want to bump your wounds." She leaned closer, lowering her voice. "What were you whispering about with Alexander? Don’t tell me you’re rekindling old flames?"

Evelyn gave a resigned smile.

She decided to keep Peter’s involvement from Vivian for now. Knowing her friend’s temper, she’d sabotage Peter’s project without hesitation if she learned the truth.

[Thank Uncle Dempsey for me.]

"This is all my fault." Vivian tugged at her hair in frustration. "If I hadn’t asked you to come, none of this would’ve—"

Evelyn squeezed her hand and shook her head.

"That bastard Simon!" Vivian seethed. "Too cowardly to confront Alexander, too weak to bully Natalie, so he targets you instead!"

[Don’t act rashly.]

"I know my limits." Vivian’s eyes suddenly lit up. "But every cloud has a silver lining—Dad promised to stop forcing me on blind dates!"

Evelyn smiled and nodded: [Just be yourself.]

"But what about you?" Vivian frowned. "Your plans to study abroad..."

[I’m going.] Evelyn typed firmly.
###Chapter 330: Keep Pretending

"How are you getting to the hospital now?"

[Don’t let my parents know. They’ll worry.]

"Then how do you want to handle this? What can I do to help?"

Evelyn Carter’s fingers hovered over her phone screen. After a moment’s hesitation, she lowered her hand.

She pointed at Vivian Dempsey’s phone.

"Use mine?"

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

Vivian handed it over without hesitation. "Here."

Evelyn quickly typed a line of text and turned the screen toward her.

Vivian studied it for a moment before nodding firmly. "Alright, we’ll do it that way. But it’ll take a few days to prepare."

A knock sounded at the door.

Vivian tensed and turned. "Who is it?"

"Terry, I couldn’t stop worrying. I had to come see you."

It was Teresa Taylor’s voice.

Vivian lowered her voice. "Annabelle’s mom. Do you want to see her?"

Evelyn gave a small nod.

Vivian walked over and opened the door.

Teresa was still in her wheelchair, but this time, Annabelle was the one pushing it.

Teresa’s eyes were red-rimmed, and Annabelle leaned down to dab at her tears with a tissue. "Mom, stop crying. Dr. Carter is awake now."

Teresa clutched her daughter’s hand. "That’s good. That’s so good."

Vivian crossed her arms, her gaze shifting between the two. "What do you want?"

Annabelle offered a placating smile. "My mom has been worried sick about Dr. Carter. She insisted on coming. Miss Dempsey, just let her say a few words. We won’t stay long."

Vivian didn’t budge. She peered into the hallway. "Alexander Hamilton, why are you hiding out there?"

"Hmm?"

Alexander stood.

"Get in here."

He raised an eyebrow. "Since when are you so friendly with me?"

Vivian scoffed. "Consider it a one-hour privilege for saving Evelyn this time. But I’ve learned my lesson. Your wife and mother-in-law are both fragile. If something happens in this room, I won’t take the blame."

Teresa winced. "You’re Dr. Carter’s close friend, aren’t you?"

"That’s right. We grew up together—closer than sisters. Got a problem with that?"

"No, I’m just glad Dr. Carter has someone like you."

Vivian frowned at Alexander. "What’s your mother-in-law trying to say?"

Alexander looked equally confused. "Aunt Teresa, did you know Evelyn before?"

"I..." Teresa’s tears spilled over. She choked back a sob. "No, I just thought it was such a coincidence that Dr. Carter and Annabelle share the same name. Seeing her hurt breaks my heart."

Vivian smirked coldly. "You’re overthinking it, ma’am. Evelyn and your daughter are worlds apart. Don’t even compare them."

Teresa bowed her head. "Annabelle was spoiled rotten. She’s made so many mistakes. I apologize on her behalf."

"Don’t. I don’t deserve it. Besides, she wronged Evelyn, not me."

"You’re right." Teresa’s voice softened. "Lately, Annabelle has been having nightmares. Her mental state fluctuates. It’s karma. She truly regrets everything now. Last night, when she heard Dr. Carter was missing, she insisted on searching—we couldn’t stop her..."

Vivian side-eyed Annabelle.

Her head was bowed, tears welling in her eyes.
###Chapter 331: The Blood-Tied Dilemma

She waved her hand impatiently. "At least she still has some conscience this time."

"Can I speak with Dr. Carter alone?"

Vivian Dempsey crossed her arms. "Make it quick. Don't disturb Evelyn's rest."

"Understood."

Annabelle Taylor wheeled herself to the hospital bed.

Teresa Taylor's eyes welled up the moment she saw Evelyn lying pale and weak. Trembling, she grasped Evelyn's hand. "My child, you've suffered so much."

Evelyn's gaze flickered between Teresa and Annabelle.

Alexander Hamilton stepped closer but maintained a respectful distance.

Evelyn handed his phone back.

He took it. "Done using it?"

She shook Vivian's phone instead.

Alexander was silent for a moment. "I'll have Emily bring you a new one."

Teresa suddenly turned. "Annabelle."

"Yes, Mom?"

"Give me your hand."

She placed Annabelle's hand over Evelyn's, clasping them tightly. "Even your names are so similar—it's fate. From now on, you must treat Dr. Carter as your own sister. Do you understand?"

Annabelle nodded obediently. "I will."

"Dr. Carter," Teresa pleaded, "Annabelle and Alexander's engagement will be called off. They'll just be siblings now. You and Alexander should focus on your marriage. I only want you both to be happy—"

Evelyn yanked her hand away.

Teresa froze. "You still resent us?"

Evelyn locked eyes with Annabelle, her lips curling into a cold smile.

Annabelle's gaze wavered, but she forced a smile. "Mom, Dr. Carter has every right to be angry. I'll prove myself through actions."

"Good girl." Teresa nodded in relief. "My greatest wish in life has come true. But... a mother's love is torn between her children."

"Mom, what do you mean?"

"Remember, Dr. Carter is your sister now. Even if she and Alexander have conflicts, you must stand by her side."

Annabelle nodded solemnly. "I'll remember."

Vivian suddenly let out a derisive laugh. "Spare us the sisterly act. Evelyn already has a real sister—she doesn't need this fake affection. Besides, she's already divorced Alexander. Isn't this arrangement a bit presumptuous?"
###Chapter 332: Simon's Whereabouts

Teresa Taylor forced a smile. "Divorces always have their reasons. Back then it was because of Annabelle... but let's not dwell on painful memories. Now that the misunderstanding is cleared up, reconciliation isn't impossible."

"That's not—"

Annabelle suddenly interrupted. "Miss Dempsey, shouldn't Evelyn and Alexander handle their own affairs? You're her friend, but ultimately not involved. If they truly love each other, your interference will only delay them."

Vivian Dempsey fell silent.

Earlier, Evelyn had deliberately sent her away to speak with Alexander alone.

She had no rebuttal.

Vivian stammered, "But this has nothing to do with you or your mother, does it? Mind your own business."

"Fine," Annabelle nodded meekly. "We'll stay out of it. Let Evelyn and Alexander resolve things themselves."

Vivian scoffed but softened her tone. "That's more like it."

"We've found Simon."

Alexander pocketed his phone, his expression grim. "Evelyn, stay with Vivian. I'll deal with him."

Vivian shot to her feet. "Where?"

Alexander hesitated, glancing at Evelyn. "Hamilton Group's underground garage."

"Ha! Alexander, if you don't roast him alive this time, I'll lose all respect for you!"

Alexander replied with two words: "Just wait."

He approached the bed, gripping Evelyn's hand over the blanket. "I'll be back soon."

To Vivian, he added, "Take care of Evelyn."

"Whether you come back or not doesn't matter—just make sure Simon ends up as barbecue! Extra cumin, please!"

A cold smirk tugged at Alexander's lips. "I'll send photos."

He nodded at Teresa. "Mrs. Taylor, I'll take my leave."

"Alexander, don't act rashly. Leave it to the police."

"I know my limits."

With that, he left.

Vivian snorted, turning to Evelyn. "Focus on recovering. If Simon's in Alexander's hands, he'll wish he were dead."

Evelyn nodded absently.

Her gaze remained fixed on Annabelle.

When Alexander departed, Annabelle's eyes followed him until he disappeared through the door, only then reluctantly looking away.

She turned—and met Evelyn's probing stare.

Annabelle flustered. "Dr. Carter, do you need anything?"

Teresa chimed in, "Yes, let Annabelle help. Miss Dempsey should rest."

Evelyn averted her eyes, typing on her phone.

[Finished? Then leave.]

Teresa's eyes reddened as she turned away.

Annabelle patted her mother's shoulder reassuringly. "Dr. Carter, my mother genuinely cares about you. If we've disturbed you, we apologize."

Evelyn typed a single word: [Go.]

Teresa wiped her eyes. "Alright, we'll go. Rest well."

Annabelle wheeled her chair toward the door. "Dr. Carter, we'll leave now."

Evelyn turned her head away, ignoring them.

Vivian shut the door and returned to the bedside. "That homewrecker's mother seems to genuinely see you as a daughter. Her concern didn't seem fake."

Evelyn typed again.

"And Annabelle... she's like a different person now. She risked everything to save you."

[She found me first.]

Vivian's eyes widened. "What? I thought it was Alexander..."

[Then she pushed me back into hell.]
###Chapter 333: Going Abroad

Sunlight streamed through the hospital window as Vivian Dempsey sat by the bed, peeling an apple.

"Open up." She held out a small piece to Evelyn Carter. "I peeled this myself. You have to eat it all."

Evelyn obediently opened her mouth. The sweetness of the apple spread across her tongue.

The TV played a news segment: Police have identified a suspect in the dockyard arson case. Sources say the individual incurred massive debts from failed investments...

Vivian rolled her eyes. "They're really glossing over the details. Won't even mention a name."

She leaned closer to Evelyn, lowering her voice. "My dad asked around. Simon Stapleton has vanished without a trace."

Evelyn's fingers tapped lightly on her phone: Alexander Hamilton?

"Don't even ask," Vivian scoffed. "Hamilton Group's headquarters is business as usual. Cars come and go from the underground garage every day. But..." Her voice dropped further. "I heard there's security posted at an abandoned freezer warehouse on the outskirts of town."

Evelyn's hand stilled.

"Don't overthink it." Vivian patted her shoulder. "Focus on recovering first. Oh, I already booked our flights."

Evelyn typed quickly: The sooner, the better.

Three days later, Heathrow Airport, London.

"Welcome to England!" A blue-eyed blonde woman greeted them warmly. "I'm Laura, head of the hospital's international exchange program."

Vivian conversed fluently in English, occasionally translating for Evelyn.

During the hospital tour, Laura pointed to a red phone booth outside the window. "That's our landmark. All new doctors take photos there."

Evelyn smiled and nodded.

"Your office is on the fifth floor," Laura gestured. "Great view of the Thames."

As they exited the hospital, Vivian linked arms with Evelyn, excited. "Let's hit Chinatown for a proper meal, then go apartment hunting!"

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the pavement. Evelyn gazed at the foreign sky and exhaled softly.
###Chapter 334: Imaginary Friends?

"Britain is a culinary wasteland. I'm going insane." Vivian Dempsey slumped in the café chair, stirring her milk tea listlessly. "I should've packed all the hotpot spices from home."

Evelyn Carter typed on her phone: [There's a Sichuan restaurant near the hospital.]

"Don't even mention it." Vivian rolled her eyes. "They made mapo tofu sweet. That's an insult to Sichuan cuisine."

[What if we buy ingredients and cook ourselves?]

Vivian sat up abruptly. "Your throat hasn't healed! You can't cook yet."

Evelyn shook her head gently and typed: [The doctor said normal activities are fine. I just can't speak temporarily.]

"Really?" Vivian's eyes lit up before dimming again. "But finding an apartment is such a hassle. Dad already offered his villa—"

Evelyn shook her head firmly.

She wouldn't impose on the Dempseys further. Besides, their villa was an hour's commute from the hospital.

Vivian sighed. "Knew I couldn't change your mind."

A phone rang.

Vivian checked the caller ID and winked. "It's Dr. Wilson."

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

"Hey Greg," Vivian answered. "What? Seriously...?"

She suddenly covered the receiver. "Gregory says his friend has a vacant villa near the hospital. He's offering it to us."

Evelyn's frown deepened.

Friend?

Surely not...

"It's legit," Vivian read her thoughts. "I know the guy—Greg's senior from med school who moved back home last year."

Seeing Evelyn's hesitation, Vivian spoke into the phone. "Send the address. We're coming now!"

Hanging up, she pulled Evelyn up. "Stop overthinking. Let's see it first. He said it's a cottage with a garden!"

Twenty minutes later, they stood before a red-brick house.

The location was perfect—ten minutes from the hospital yet secluded from main roads.

Vivian retrieved a key from the mailbox. The lock clicked open.

No musty smell greeted them.

Instead, lavender wafted through spotless floors—clearly maintained regularly.

"This is amazing!" Vivian twirled like a child. "Look at this sofa! The coffee table! And—"

She froze.

Evelyn followed her gaze.

Centered on the living room wall hung an enormous oil painting.

A girl's back was turned, walking down a path strewn with plane tree leaves. Golden sunlight filtered through branches, dappling her silhouette.
###Chapter 335: The Secret in the Oil Painting

Vivian Dempsey leaned closer to the oil painting, her fingertip lightly brushing the canvas.

"This streetlamp..." She frowned in thought. "Why does it look so much like the one behind the medical school's lab building?"

Evelyn Carter's fingers tightened slightly.

She lowered her lashes, avoiding the smiling gaze of the girl in the painting.

"Am I remembering wrong?" Vivian scratched her head. "The last time I went to the medical school was three years ago."

Evelyn pressed her lips together and shook her head.

"Okay." Vivian shrugged. "Maybe all European-style streetlamps look the same."

Evelyn pointed at her phone.

"Oh, right!" Vivian smacked her forehead. "Your parents must be worried sick."

The moment the video call connected, three anxious faces filled the screen.

"Sis! You scared us to death!" Emily Anderson's eyes were red-rimmed.

Grace Anderson's voice trembled. "Evelyn, why did you suddenly go abroad?"

Evelyn's throat tightened.

"Don't worry, Auntie." Vivian turned the camera toward the window. "There's a critical patient here who insisted Evelyn perform the surgery."

Andrew Anderson studied his daughter's pale face. "Why aren't you speaking?"

"She just finished an eight-hour surgery." Vivian handed her a glass of water. "Her throat's gone hoarse."

Grace wrung her hands anxiously. "What about food? Does the hospital provide meals?"

Evelyn scribbled "dorm" on a notepad.

"The hospital values Evelyn so much!" Vivian gestured dramatically. "They gave us a two-bedroom apartment with a kitchen."

Andrew nudged his wife's shoulder proudly. "See? I told you our daughter would be in demand anywhere!"

"Then why don't you show Vivian your cooking skills?" Grace suddenly laughed. "Remember when she mistook sugar for salt and dumped half a jar in the pan during her first attempt?"

Evelyn's ears burned. She grabbed a pillow and threw it at the screen.

Vivian suddenly gasped. "Wait!"

She zoomed in on the video, pointing at the painting behind Evelyn. "Uncle, Auntie, look at this streetlamp..."
###Chapter 336: Evelyn, It's Me

Emily Anderson covered her mouth, suppressing a giggle. "Mom, Evelyn is trying her best."

Anthony Taylor quickly mediated. "Evelyn never liked cooking as a child. The fact that she's trying now is already progress. Besides, she's so busy with work—when would she have time to practice?"

Listening to her family's comforting words, Evelyn Carter felt the tension in her shoulders ease slightly.

Vivian Dempsey thumped her chest confidently. "Don't worry, Auntie! I have an iron stomach. I could eat three bowls of Evelyn's cooking!"

"Vivian, could you send me Evelyn's new address? I just learned how to use navigation apps and want to see where she's living now."

Vivian glanced at Evelyn for permission before nodding. "Of course, Auntie. I'll send it to you right away."

"Oh, and remember to get a local SIM card soon. You can't keep relying on Vivian to contact Evelyn every time."

"Got it. We'll take care of it when we go out later."

After hanging up, Vivian exhaled in relief. "Feel better now?"

Evelyn gave a small nod.

Suddenly, the phone rang again.

"It's my dad," Vivian said, her expression darkening as she answered. "What?! Okay, I'll book a flight immediately."

Evelyn shot her a questioning look.

Vivian's face paled. "My grandmother fell. She's in the hospital now."

Evelyn immediately pushed her toward the door.

Vivian hesitated. "But you just got here, and you don't even speak the language..."

Evelyn typed rapidly on her phone: [Falls are serious for elderly patients. You need to go.]

"But you'll be alone..."

[I can take care of myself.]

Years of working in the hospital had taught Evelyn how dangerous falls could be for the elderly. If Vivian's father was calling now, the situation must be critical.

Vivian pulled her into a tight hug. "I'll come back as soon as things stabilize."

Evelyn nodded firmly and quickly hailed a taxi for her.

Watching her friend leave, the apartment suddenly felt oppressively quiet.

Evelyn took a deep breath and began organizing her new home. She made two trips to the supermarket, filling the fridge to bursting, then arranged the bedroom into a cozy sanctuary.

At dinner, she sighed at the charred eggs in the pan. Years of relying on hospital cafeterias and others' cooking had left her skills rusty.

Outside, a light rain began to fall.

Just as Evelyn moved to lock the door, the doorbell rang.

Startled, she tapped the door to signal her presence.

Then came that achingly familiar voice from the other side:

"Evelyn, it's me."
###Chapter 337: She Knew What It Meant

The doorbell rang while Evelyn Carter was packing her luggage.

She paused, wondering who could be visiting at this hour.

Peering through the peephole, she saw Gregory Wilson standing outside, drenched from head to toe.

Rainwater dripped steadily from his hair, forming a small puddle at his feet.

Evelyn quickly pulled the door open.

"May I come in?" His voice was hoarse.

She stepped aside, but Gregory didn’t enter immediately. Instead, he shook the water from his hair at the doorstep.

Evelyn hurried to the bathroom and grabbed a fresh towel.

"It’s new," she gestured, worried he might misunderstand.

Gregory shook his head. "No need. Do you have tissues?"

She turned to fetch a box of tissues and pointed to the sofa, inviting him to sit.

"I’m soaked. I’ll stand." He wiped his face carelessly with a tissue. "Your throat still hurts?"

Evelyn nodded.

"Did you take your medicine?"

Another nod.

Gregory glanced at the floor. "Sorry for making a mess again."

Evelyn waved her hand to say it was fine.

"You still haven’t bought a phone?" He suddenly handed her his own. "Use mine to type."

Before she could react, the phone was already in her hands.

"Passcode is 0326."

Her heartbeat quickened inexplicably as she entered the numbers.

When the screen unlocked, she secretly exhaled in relief.

It wasn’t her birthday, nor were there any traces of her in his phone.

The number 0326 held no meaning for her.

The wallpaper was just the default image of a blue sky with white clouds.

A man who had been in the country that morning now stood before her in the middle of the night, drenched from the English rain.

She wasn’t naive about what this meant.

Since her clear rejection last time, Gregory had never brought up the subject again.

But some things couldn’t be ignored just because they went unspoken.

[Why did you suddenly come to England? What about the hospital?]

Gregory leaned closer to read the screen. "I’ve worked in England before. The dean knows about this."

[When are you going back?]

He chuckled. "Am I making you uncomfortable?"

[No, I just don’t want to interfere with your work.]

"I have a place to stay. I was planning to visit properly tomorrow." He paused. "I just remembered this house has old wiring. Power outages happen during storms. I didn’t want you to be alone and scared."

Warmth bloomed in Evelyn’s chest. [Thank you.]

"For coming to see you?"

[For the house.]

When Vivian Dempsey mentioned knowing the landlord, Evelyn had been skeptical.

Especially after seeing the oil painting in the living room—her suspicions had only grown stronger.
###Chapter 338 I Just Don't Want You to Catch Cold

Gregory Wilson's eyes flickered slightly, as if deciphering her unspoken question. "You guessed it?"

She gave a slight nod.

"Technically, this house doesn't belong to me," he tapped the table with his slender fingers. "The original owners were an elderly couple who moved to Australia. I'm just a long-term tenant."

[I can share the rent.]

Gregory pondered for a moment. "Let's wait until your job stabilizes. There's no rush."

She had left in a hurry, and her wallet was indeed light.

At least until next month's payday, she wouldn't have spare funds.

[I'll pay you back later.]

"Alright."

"..."

"It's getting late. You should rest." As he stood, Evelyn Carter noticed the small carry-on suitcase.

It was so tiny it couldn't even fit a thick coat.

The temperature in London was only ten degrees, and his trench coat was already soaked through from the rain, clinging to his body.

[Did you bring a change of clothes?]

Gregory paused mid-step, glancing at the suitcase. "It was a last-minute trip. I only packed essentials."

[Are there any of your clothes here?]

His gaze suddenly grew intense.

Evelyn had always stayed in the guest bedroom, never setting foot in the master suite.

If this was his former residence...

"In the master bedroom closet."

[Have you eaten?]

"Airplane food."

That dry, tasteless excuse for a meal hardly counted.

Evelyn tightened her grip on her phone. [Go take a hot shower and change first.]

Gregory's eyes darkened abruptly.

A mix of surprise and confusion flickered through them.

She quickly added, [I just don't want you to catch cold.]

The corner of his lips quirked up, though the smile didn't reach his eyes. "I understand."

[Your health comes first.]

"Mm," he nodded. "Thank you."

[I'll make dinner. You go get settled.]

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "You can cook?"

[No promises on taste, but it'll fill you up.]

[I feel terrible making you come out in the rain so late. Consider this my thanks.]

He studied her for a long moment before finally nodding. "Alright."

In the open kitchen, Evelyn retrieved eggs and pasta from the fridge.

As the water boiled, the faint sound of running water came from the master bedroom.

So the master suite had its own bathroom.

She breathed a quiet sigh of relief.

At least they wouldn't have any awkward encounters.

When the tangy aroma of tomatoes filled the air, Gregory descended the wooden staircase.

A white turtleneck sweater softened his usual sharp edges, while black sweatpants accentuated his long legs.

"Smells amazing."

Evelyn plated the pasta and carried it to the dining table.
###Chapter 339: Are You Together Now?

Gregory Wilson raised an eyebrow slightly. "Which department in a hospital isn't constantly swamped? I always see you grabbing meals at the hospital cafeteria. Didn’t expect you to be such a good cook."

Evelyn Carter handed him a fork, the corner of her lips lifting.

Gregory stared at the brand-new fork, his brow furrowing almost imperceptibly.

He stood abruptly and walked to the kitchen, pulling open the third drawer to retrieve a pair of chopsticks.

"Still prefer these," he said as he sat back down, scanning the table. "Why only one serving?"

Evelyn’s fingers twisted together unconsciously.

Her surgeries had been back-to-back today, leaving her only enough time to scarf down two slices of bread.

"You skipped dinner?" Gregory’s voice darkened.

With quick movements, he divided the pasta into two portions and pushed one toward her. "Doctors should eat on time."

The fork was pressed back into her hand, its cool metal seeping into her palm.

A sudden ringtone shattered the silence.

"Vincent."

"Bro! Why did you suddenly fly to the UK?!"

Gregory twirled noodles around his chopsticks. "Work."

"What’s so urgent? Unless—" The voice on the other end dropped to a whisper. "Did Evelyn go with you?"

The air froze.

Evelyn’s fork hovered mid-air.

Gregory glanced at her before responding calmly, "Yes."

"Oh no, no, no..." Vincent groaned. "Alexander’s been tearing the city apart looking for her. Vivian isn’t answering her calls either. Mom and Dad said you went back to the UK, so I figured—"

"We didn’t come together."

"But are you two...?" Vincent’s voice trembled. "Are you together right now?"

Gregory picked up a mushroom. "Yes."

"It’s past midnight in London! You two—"

"Don’t overthink it."

Frantic rustling came through the phone. "Greg, please, I’m begging you—don’t let Alexander know I called you!"

Chopsticks tapped lightly against the porcelain plate.

Gregory chuckled. "That scared of him?"

"You’re both my brothers! I’m stuck in the middle here!" Vincent sounded close to tears. "I don’t even know what to call Evelyn anymore..."

"Dr. Carter is fine."

"That’s not the point!" Vincent wailed. "If you two end up fighting over her, I can’t pick sides!"
###Chapter 340: You Can Always Come to Me for Help

"Let's pretend nothing happened."

"I can turn a blind eye, but..." Gregory Wilson suddenly lowered his voice. "Hold on, I'm getting another call."

"Mm."

Alexander Hamilton set down his phone and continued eating his noodles unhurriedly.

Noticing Evelyn Carter hadn't touched her food, he gently reminded her, "Eat while it's hot."

Evelyn shook her head and pointed to her stomach.

"Afraid of gaining weight?"

[It's too late.]

"Rushing your plans to move abroad without even getting a local SIM card," Gregory set down his chopsticks. "Are you trying to avoid Alexander?"

[Yes.]

"With his connections, he'll find you eventually."

[Let him try.]

Evelyn had already braced herself for it.

Alexander had his career, his family, and that persistent shadow—Annabelle Taylor—back home.

The fire incident had finally revealed Annabelle's true nature. All that talk of repentance and change? Just an act to manipulate Alexander's sympathy.

If the flames had spread further that day, if Alexander had arrived a moment later...

Annabelle's desperate gamble had been flawless.

A "martyr" who sacrificed herself for love would forever remain Alexander's deepest regret.

And Evelyn? Just a replacement living in Annabelle's shadow.

"If you need help, I'm here."

"..."

"I've lived in England for years. I have connections." Gregory's gaze was steady. "If you want to disappear completely, I can make it happen."

His phone rang again.

Vincent Wilson's voice cracked with panic. "Greg, Alexander's already on his way to the airport!"

"Who told him?"

"It wasn't me! He went to Evelyn's hometown—"

"Got it."

"Greg, I tried my best..." Vincent sounded frantic. "Just... don't start a fight, okay?"

"Do you think we're animals?"

"Isn't that how males compete for mates?" Vincent groaned. "You're both like brothers to me. I can't pick sides—"

"The choice is Evelyn's." Gregory's tone remained calm. "Alexander can't force her."

Ding—

Another call came through.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

Gregory chuckled. "He's here."
###Chapter 341: I Thought You Had Something to Tell Me

Gregory Wilson's lips curled into an amused smile. "He's quite resourceful. Knowing your phone is broken, he called me directly."

He shook his phone lightly. "Should I answer?"

Evelyn Carter stared at the unfamiliar number flashing on the screen and shook her head.

"Want me to hang up?"

After a brief hesitation, she gestured indifferently.

Gregory chuckled and flipped the phone face-down on the table. "Let's eat first."

The ringing pierced the quiet living room, but he ignored it, leisurely eating his noodles.

Until the sound abruptly stopped.

"Feel better now?" Gregory set down his chopsticks, his gaze intense.

Evelyn looked up, puzzled.

"Seeing Alexander Hamilton so desperate to reach you—even calling his rival—does that ease your mind a little?"

Finally, she understood his meaning.

Evelyn shook her head.

"Still not satisfied?"

Another shake.

Her relationship with Alexander was never just about simple love or hate.

Those three years of marriage were merely two compatible people sharing a life. Annabelle Taylor's appearance only made that truth clearer.

She pointed at the phone.

Gregory handed it to her.

With practiced movements, Evelyn blocked the number and returned the device.

"I thought you had something to tell me," Gregory said, his tone teasing as he took it back.

Evelyn waved her hand dismissively.

Explaining was too exhausting, and she had no desire to bare her wounds.

But as their hands brushed during the exchange, she felt the scorching heat of his fingertips.

In the dim living room light, she finally noticed how unnaturally pale he looked.

Frowning, she reached for his forehead—

Burning hot!

Gregory instinctively caught her wrist in his daze. "What's wrong?"

Realizing it was her, he immediately let go. "Sorry."

Evelyn gestured, but he clearly didn't understand.

She grabbed the phone and typed rapidly: [You have a high fever. It's serious.]

Gregory blinked, then touched his own forehead. "No wonder I feel so dizzy."

He offered a weak smile. "I flew here right after my night shift yesterday. Probably caught a chill in the rain. It's fine—I'll sleep it off."

As he stood, his legs buckled, nearly sending him crashing to the floor.

"Careful!"

Evelyn caught him just in time, but a loud thud followed—

Gregory's arm slammed into a decorative frame on the wall, blood immediately trickling down his forearm.

"Damn it..." He gritted his teeth against the pain. "The floor's too slippery."

Without another word, Evelyn guided him to the sofa.
###Chapter 342 Someone Still Calls Her Mrs. Hamilton

Gregory Wilson's arm was still bleeding. Evelyn Carter firmly pressed him onto the sofa.

[Where's the first aid kit?]

"Had one before. Probably expired now." Gregory gave a bitter smile. "Kept it here when I lived here, but back then I was young and reckless. Never bothered with minor injuries—just went straight to the hospital."

Evelyn glanced at his bloodstained shirt. [I'll get medicine.]

"It's too late. Not safe."

[The frame had rust.]

Gregory's expression darkened.

They were both doctors. They knew what that meant.

No one took tetanus risks lightly.

"I'll go with you."

Evelyn stopped him. [Don't let the wound get wet. The pharmacy's just at the corner.]

Gregory sighed. "Ironically, I came here to take care of you."

He handed her his phone. [Take an umbrella. Call the police if anything happens.]

The rainy night was silent. The streets were empty.

The pharmacy glowed with warm light.

Evelyn typed her list on the phone: antiseptic, cotton swabs, tetanus shot...

"Can't you speak?" the clerk asked softly.

Evelyn pointed to her throat and shook her head with a smile.

The clerk understood and turned to gather the supplies.

The doorbell chimed.

"Burn ointment, please... Mrs. Hamilton?!"

Evelyn looked up into a familiar face—Richard Jackson, the mutual friend of Alexander Hamilton and Annabelle Taylor.

"What happened to your voice?" Richard looked shocked.

The clerk explained, "This lady can't speak right now."

Richard tried to ask more, but Evelyn was already heading to the register.

"That'll be 28 pounds."

Evelyn opened her wallet. Only a single 10-pound note remained.

[Is there an ATM nearby?] She typed on her phone.

Richard leaned in. "Trouble?"
###Chapter 343: Reunion in a Foreign Land

The clerk hesitated. "The nearest ATM is two blocks away. It's a thirty-minute walk. The area isn't very safe at night—lots of homeless people around..."

Richard immediately understood. "I'll cover it."

Evelyn's fingers tightened slightly around her wallet.

Richard chuckled. "Don't worry. Alexander can reimburse me later."

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Alexander had followed her to England?

She glanced out the window and spotted a black sedan parked nearby, the shadowy outline of its driver barely visible.

The clerk announced the total.

After paying, Richard handed her the medicine bag. "Let's go."

Evelyn didn't move.

"Fight with Alexander?" Richard raised an eyebrow. "He flew here in the middle of the night and dragged me straight to the hospital. Turns out he was worried about you."

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

[You've been in England this whole time?]

"Yeah, came right after the reunion," Richard said casually. "Got a project here."

No wonder he didn't know about the divorce.

"Richard, what's taking so long—"

The pharmacy door swung open.

Alexander's voice cut off abruptly.

His gaze burned against Evelyn's skin, forcing her to turn away.

"You two are so in sync," Richard teased. "Even bump into each other at a pharmacy. Alexander, your wife might be hurt—she just bought a tetanus shot."

Evelyn frantically shook her hands.

Alexander was already striding toward her, scanning her body. "Where are you hurt?"

She kept shaking her head.

"Hospital. Now." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn took half a step back, still refusing.

Richard frowned. "Why isn't your wife speaking?"

"Sore throat," Alexander said smoothly.

"That bad?"

"Mhm."

"She should see a doctor. Antibiotics are tightly controlled here—"

"She is a doctor."

Richard blinked. "Right, I forgot. Come on, I'll drive you both to the hospital."

Evelyn remained rooted in place.

Alexander's eyes swept over her exposed skin—no visible wounds, clothes pristine.

"Planning to sleep here?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

"Fine. Keep your address a secret." His voice softened slightly. "But we're going to the hospital first, and then..."

He deliberately paused.

Evelyn's eyes flew up in alarm.

"...to a hotel." A faint smirk flickered in Alexander's eyes. "Two rooms."
###Chapter 344: I Came Here for You

Evelyn's finger hovered over her phone screen, frozen midair.

A flush crept from her ears to her cheeks.

[I'm fine. No need for the hospital.]

"Then who are these medicines for?"

[Just stocking up.]

"Couldn't you buy them during the day? Why venture out in this storm at midnight?"

[Didn't want to forget during work.]

Alexander's gaze swept over her face like a searchlight. "An OB-GYN department would run out of supplies?"

Evelyn turned away.

"Someone's at home."

It wasn't a question.

"Vivian's back in the country. Who else do you know in England? Roommates? Colleagues?"

Richard interjected, "Alex, the rain's torrential. Let's get your wife home first."

Alexander reached for her shopping bag. "Address."

Evelyn retreated half a step.

"Planning to walk?"

[Yes.]

"Do you know what time it is?" Alexander checked his watch. "1:27 AM."

Richard suddenly remembered. "There's an old villa district nearby—"

Alexander arched an eyebrow. "You live there? The Dempsey property?"

Evelyn typed rapidly: [Mind your own business.]

"I came to England specifically to find you."

Rain hammered against the pharmacy windows like drumbeats.

"Disappearing without a word. Changing numbers. Vanishing." Alexander's voice tightened. "So desperate to escape me?"

Evelyn met his gaze and nodded firmly.

Richard whistled. "Never thought I'd see the day Alexander Hamilton got rejected."

Alexander seized her wrist. "Three options—your place, a hotel, or spending the night here."

Evelyn trembled with fury.

Before she could react, strong arms lifted her off the ground. Alexander carried her toward the exit. "Richard, car keys."

"Got it."

The car door slammed shut. Evelyn shrank into the corner.

"Address." Alexander thrust his phone at her. "Or we go straight to a hotel."

Evelyn glared daggers at him.

"Option one it is." Alexander instructed the driver, "Villa district."

Headlights sliced through the downpour. Two minutes later, they halted before a vine-covered mansion.

"This one?"

Evelyn pushed the door open.

Alexander sprinted after her with an umbrella, pinning her against the porch railing. "Passcode?"

Her sigh dissolved into the roaring rain.
###Chapter 345: An Unexpected Cohabitation

Raindrops pattered sharply against the umbrella.

Evelyn walked briskly ahead, her high heels splashing through puddles.

Hurried footsteps approached from behind.

"Let me." Alexander Hamilton took the umbrella handle from her without waiting for permission, his fingers brushing against the back of her hand.

She jerked her hand away, brows furrowed.

"Nice landscaping in this neighborhood," he remarked, scanning the surroundings. "Security seems decent too."

Evelyn quickened her pace, rainwater soaking the hem of her dress.

The umbrella followed, shielding her completely.

She spun around abruptly.

Alexander arched an eyebrow. "What's wrong?"

[What exactly are you trying to do?]

The corner of his mouth lifted. "I thought my intentions were obvious."

[My refusal is equally obvious.]

"Give me a chance," he said, voice low. "No need to decide now, but at least let me make my stance clear."

Evelyn took a deep breath. [Just leave.]

"Leave where?"

[Anywhere.]

Before she could react, a warm hand gripped her waist.

Headlights sliced through the rain.

"Watch out!"

Alexander pulled her into his arms just as muddy water splashed across his back with a dull thud.

He released her with a grimace, tugging at his soaked suit jacket. "Seems the residents here have varying standards."

His drenched shirt clung to his back, outlining his muscular frame.

Evelyn reached for the umbrella.

"Don't touch the water," he sidestepped, keeping it away. "Your wound shouldn't get wet. Let's get you home."

"Evelyn?"

A flashlight beam cut through the darkness.

Gregory Wilson stood a short distance away, his gaze shifting between them. "Mr. Hamilton, you arrived quickly."

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "You live here?"

"Yes."

"What a coincidence."

Gregory chuckled. "Do you own property here, Mr. Hamilton?"

"No."

"Then it's not much of a coincidence."

"Evelyn lives in this neighborhood now," Alexander's tone darkened. "You knew that, didn't you?"

"I did."

"Arranged by Vivian Dempsey?"

"Originally," Gregory replied calmly. "But she's preoccupied with family matters now."

Alexander tightened his grip on Evelyn's shoulder. "We won't keep you, Dr. Wilson."

"No rush," Gregory stepped closer. "Evelyn is currently staying at my place."

The air turned frigid.

Alexander's fingers tensed. "You're living with him?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

The rain drummed louder against the umbrella.

"It's close to the hospital," Gregory said evenly. "The place was empty anyway. She can move out whenever she finds suitable housing."
###Chapter 346: I Don't Believe in Coincidences

"Dr. Wilson is quite thoughtful."

"Just being polite," Gregory Wilson's gaze lingered on Evelyn Carter. "Are you alright?"

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

[Why did you come out?]

"You were gone too long. I got worried." A faint smile touched Gregory's lips. "Turns out you ran into an acquaintance."

Evelyn lifted the medicine bag. [Got everything.]

Gregory hummed in acknowledgment. "Come under my umbrella. It's larger."

He stepped forward, aligning his umbrella with Alexander Hamilton's, creating a sheltered path.

Evelyn moved to step forward.

Alexander abruptly yanked her back. "She's fine where she is."

Gregory glanced at Alexander's drenched shirt. "You're already soaked, Mr. Hamilton."

"Doesn't matter now." Alexander's voice was icy. "Wouldn't want to inconvenience you, Dr. Wilson."

Evelyn shook off Alexander's grip and walked straight under Gregory's umbrella.

Gregory tilted the umbrella toward her as they walked side by side.

"Where did you meet?"

[Pharmacy.]

"Coincidence?"

She nodded.

Gregory scoffed. "The world isn't that serendipitous."

At the villa's entrance, Evelyn hurried inside.

Gregory closed his umbrella. "Following us for a tour, Mr. Hamilton?"

Alexander arched a brow. "Problem?"

"It's late."

"I don't mind."

"But Evelyn needs rest."

Alexander smirked. "She can sleep. I'll just look around."

"Afraid you might see something that'll keep you awake."

"Meaning?"

Gregory's tone turned cryptic. "I have some... private collections."

"Oh? Now I'm even more curious."

Gregory stepped aside. "After you."

In the kitchen, Evelyn boiled water.

At the sound of footsteps, she closed her eyes briefly.

Of course—

"This painting is interesting." Alexander's voice turned frigid.

It was an oil painting.

A girl in a white coat, her slender back turned.

"Painted ten years ago," Gregory said calmly.

Alexander stared at the canvas. "The tree-lined path at Hudson Medical?"

"Sharp eye, Mr. Hamilton."

"It captures her well." Alexander's fingers tightened. "She always walked that path alone back then."
###Chapter 347: My Muse Gave Me Extraordinary Inspiration

Gregory Wilson's lips curved slightly. "Indeed, almost unchanged."

"I never knew Dr. Wilson had such talent for painting."

"Hardly talent," he shook his head gently. "Just occasional doodles without formal training. Perhaps my muse blessed me with extraordinary inspiration today."

Alexander Hamilton's gaze lingered on the artwork. "Which year of college was this?"

"Sophomore year," Gregory recalled. "I returned for an academic exchange and visited Hudson University Medical School."

Alexander studied the painted scene. "Does that tree-lined path at the medical school still exist?"

"You'll have to ask Evelyn."

Alexander turned toward the kitchen where a figure stood motionless by the whistling kettle, trying to remain unnoticed. "Evelyn?"

Evelyn Carter pointed to her throat with a slight shake of her head.

"My apologies. I forgot your voice hasn't recovered."

He approached slowly, resting one hand on the marble countertop. His fingertips brushed her neck accidentally. "Still hurts?"

Evelyn frowned and retreated half a step.

"How will you work without speaking?"

Gregory's voice carried from the living room. "No outpatient duties initially—just orientation. I'll look after her."

Alexander's eyes darkened. "Much obliged, Dr. Wilson."

Gregory didn't respond, settling onto the couch instead. Spotting Evelyn's purchased medications on the coffee table, he retrieved a syringe and tetanus shot. "Evelyn, I need your assistance."

She nodded in acknowledgment.

The kettle chirped its completion.

From the fridge, she took bottled water to temper the heat before carrying the glass to Gregory.

Accepting it, his eyes warmed. "Thank you."

Evelyn pressed a hand to his forehead, then produced fever reducers and anti-inflammatories.

[Take the antipyretics first. Antibiotics in thirty minutes.]

"Understood."

Pills met palm, then disappeared with a water chaser.

Evelyn had already begun prepping the injection with clinical precision. Alcohol swabs dabbed fingertips. Needle packaging tore open crisply. A testing push of the plunger confirmed patency before her confirming nod.

Gregory rolled his left sleeve to the shoulder wordlessly.

Concentric alcohol circles sanitized skin. The needle found muscle unerringly. Evelyn administered the shot smoothly, applying pressure with cotton before sheathing the used needle.

Leaning back, Gregory held the swab in place. "More painful than I remembered."

Evelyn's questioning glance asked:

[Rusty technique? It's been a while since I gave intramuscular injections.]

"Just been too long since my last shot," he chuckled.

Her attention drifted to the wound on his right arm. She'd deliberately chosen his left for the injection—now his right hand held the cotton swab, leaving the injury unattended.

After ensuring no bleeding at the injection site, she knelt before the sofa with fresh alcohol swabs to tend the angry laceration.
###Chapter 348: The Uninvited Guest

Gregory Wilson's knuckles turned white as medical alcohol seeped into his wound.

Evelyn Carter noticed his tension and lightened her touch.

"Continue," he said steadily, his gaze unwavering.

She nodded, focusing on cleaning the injury.

As she wrapped the bandage, Gregory suddenly spoke. "Your technique is very professional."

Evelyn pressed her lips together in a small smile and put away the supplies.

"I'll take the medicine on time," he volunteered.

She gestured toward the guest bedroom.

"Go rest," Gregory said gently. "I've got this."

A sharp gaze came from the kitchen doorway.

Alexander Hamilton leaned against the frame, his eyes dark and unreadable.

"Mr. Hamilton wanted a tour of the house," Gregory remarked calmly. "I assume he'll take you away tomorrow."

Evelyn quickly typed on her phone: I'll move out once my voice recovers.

After reading the message, a flicker of sadness passed through Gregory's eyes. "Let me know if you need anything."

She gave him a grateful smile.

As she passed the kitchen, Alexander spoke abruptly. "Was getting caught in the rain worth it just to buy him medicine?"

Evelyn didn't pause.

The moment the guest room door closed behind her, she exhaled deeply.

Surprisingly, she slept soundly.

When she woke, sunlight streamed across the windowsill.

The aroma of rice porridge drifted from the kitchen.

"Perfect timing for breakfast," Gregory said, turning from the stove with an apron tied around his waist. "He left last night."

The porridge bubbled in the pot, each grain plump and glossy.

"Learned this during my studies abroad," he said with a self-deprecating smile. "It's barely edible."

Evelyn gave him a thumbs-up.

"Vivian called," he mentioned while drying his hands. "She wants you to reply to her message."

Her phone lay untouched on the table.

She hesitated, staring at the login screen.

"Use mine," Gregory offered, sliding his phone toward her. "You can delete the chat afterward."

The tips of Evelyn's ears turned pink.

"Don't keep her waiting," he said, turning back to ladle the porridge, his posture straight and composed.
###Chapter 349: The Vanishing Mystery

Evelyn typed into the chat box: [Vivian]

Vivian Dempsey replied instantly: [Holy shit! Who is this?! Alexander Hamilton, stop messing with me! Use my full name, will you?]

Evelyn chuckled softly: [It's me.]

[Evelyn?! You're using his phone?]

[Yes.]

Vivian sent a string of exclamation marks: [Hold on, I'll get you a new phone ASAP!]

They caught up for a while before the conversation turned to Vivian's grandmother.

Vivian's tone grew somber: [Grandma went into surgery last night. The doctor's prognosis... isn't good.]

Evelyn's fingers paused mid-type: [Wait a moment.]

She carried the phone to the kitchen. Gregory Wilson was slicing fruit and glanced up. "Done chatting?"

[Do you have contact info for Dr. Zhang Chongwen in orthopedics?]

"Zhang Chongwen?" Gregory thought for a moment. "I'm in OB-GYN, so I don't interact much with other departments. Need help?"

Evelyn asked another question: [Can I borrow your WeChat to reach Olivia Lightfoot?]

"No problem."

Through Olivia, Evelyn quickly obtained Dr. Zhang's number and forwarded it to Vivian.

[Dr. Zhang is highly experienced. Have your father contact him.]

Vivian replied immediately: [Got it! By the way, Alexander seems to have gone to the UK. Be careful.]

Evelyn stared at the screen, slowly typing a single word: [Okay.]

[There's something even creepier—Simon Stapleton... has vanished without a trace. The police can't find any leads.]

Evelyn's chest tightened.

Vivian continued: [I asked Vincent Wilson, and even he claims to know nothing. This is beyond strange...]

[He doesn't know either?]

[Exactly! The Hamilton Group is business as usual, but a grown man just disappears? The more you think about it, the scarier it gets...]

Evelyn gripped the phone, her knuckles turning pale.

Suddenly, Vivian sent another message: [My dad wants to video call you. Is now okay?]

Evelyn hesitated: [I can't talk right now. Please thank Uncle Dempsey for me.]

The moment she hit send, a video call request popped up.

Faced with the elder's insistence, Evelyn reluctantly answered.

On screen, Mr. Dempsey looked exhausted, dark circles under his eyes.

"Evelyn, can you speak?" His voice was low.

Just as Evelyn was about to nod, Mr. Dempsey suddenly squinted. "Is someone... behind you?"

Vivian leaned into view. "Dad, that's Gregory Wilson, the eldest son of the Wilson family. He works with Evelyn now."
###Chapter 350: Undercurrents

Uncle Dempsey's forehead creased into deep furrows. "A phone from the Wilson family?"

"Yes. Evelyn's currently using one he gave her."

Mr. Wilson suddenly lowered his voice. "Evelyn, can we speak privately?"

The aroma of congee wafted from the kitchen. Without looking up, Gregory waved a hand. "Go ahead."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone as she entered the guest room.

Uncle Dempsey's gaze followed her. "Is the door locked?"

She flipped the camera to show him the secured latch.

Vivian leaned in. "Dad, what's so secretive? Greg's practically family."

Uncle Dempsey heaved a heavy sigh.

"What's going on?"

"Evelyn," he said, staring directly into the lens, "Alexander Hamilton has gone to England. Can you contact him to ask about Simon Stapleton's whereabouts?"

Vivian interrupted, "Who cares what happens to that scumbag? You think Alexander would let him off easy?"

"That's exactly what worries me!" Uncle Dempsey's voice rose abruptly. "You don't know the real Alexander Hamilton..."

His Adam's apple bobbed as he hesitated.

Vivian frowned. "Dad, what are you really afraid of?"

"During the Hamilton Group's power transition," he whispered, "all those veteran executives stepped down overnight. Does that seem normal to you?"

"It proves Alexander's capable."

"Capable?" Uncle Dempsey gave a cold laugh. "Do you know what happened to Director Zhang, his most vocal opponent?"

The room plunged into silence.

"On their third day of deep-sea fishing, only Alexander returned alive. The news reported a freak tsunami."

Vivian gasped. "That's..."

"Here's the strange part," Uncle Dempsey's voice dropped to a near-inaudible level, "weather records showed calm seas that day. Not a storm in sight."

Evelyn's fingertips turned icy.

"After that, all opposition vanished like it never existed," Uncle Dempsey's eyes flickered with unease. "Poof. Gone without a trace."

Vivian's voice trembled. "Dad, are you saying..."

"I'm not saying anything." His volume spiked suddenly. "But if Simon really fell into Alexander's hands..."

A ceramic object shattered outside the window.

Evelyn whirled around. A slender shadow now stretched beneath the door—one that hadn't been there before.
###Chapter 351: Who Can Guarantee Being His Exception?

"I truly know nothing," Uncle Dempsey's weary voice came through the phone. "Seeing Simon Stapleton vanish suddenly just reminded me of the past. Evelyn, stay away from Alexander Hamilton from now on. That young man is too cunning—even I can't figure him out."

Vivian Dempsey pouted in defiance. "Dad, you make him sound like some villain. You haven't seen how he trails after Evelyn like a lovesick puppy."

"People have many sides," Uncle Dempsey sighed. "Perhaps Evelyn is special to him. But who can guarantee they'll always be the exception?"

The line fell silent.

His tone grew heavier. "Evelyn, Simon took you from the Dempsey residence. Our family bears responsibility for that. I'm genuinely worried—"

"Dad!" Vivian interrupted. "Are you afraid Alexander will blame us? Impossible! I'm Evelyn's best friend. Why would he—"

"That director was Grandma Hamilton's most trusted aide. He watched Alexander grow up. What do you think?"

Vivian went quiet.

"Evelyn, I'm telling you this not to scare you." Uncle Dempsey softened his voice. "Alexander cares deeply for you now. I hope you can advise him. If Simon is still alive, letting the police handle it is safest. The Dempseys will cooperate fully. The maid who tricked you has already turned herself in."

After hanging up, Evelyn sat frozen, phone in hand.

When Gregory Wilson knocked, she hadn't recovered from the shock.

The man Uncle Dempsey described bore no resemblance to the gentle ex-husband she remembered.

Her fingertips felt cold.

"Finished your call?" Gregory asked softly outside the door. "The porridge is ready. Come eat something."

Evelyn opened the door.

Gregory frowned. "You look pale."

She forced a smile and walked straight to the dining table.

Two steaming bowls of rice porridge sat beside a bowl of fresh green salad.

"Only salad dressing in the fridge," Gregory apologized. "I'll get Chinese seasonings from the Asian supermarket today. Your throat isn't healed yet—nothing too strong."

Evelyn nodded in thanks.

The porridge was perfectly soft, its mild aroma comforting.

"I need to go shopping later," Gregory said. "Want to come? Familiarize yourself with the area."

Evelyn pointed to her forehead questioningly.

"Fever's gone," he understood. "Your arm wound was treated too—fresh bandage this morning."

She stirred the porridge mechanically.

"It rains often in England," Gregory continued. "Remember an umbrella next time."

Her spoon clinked against the bowl.

Uncle Dempsey's words lingered in her mind.

"Something wrong at home?" Gregory noticed her unease.
###Chapter 353: Move In With Me

Evelyn snapped back to reality and waved her hands dismissively.

"Then why do you look so pale?"

She rubbed her temples and gestured toward the bedroom, miming sleep.

Gregory understood immediately. "Didn't sleep well last night? Understandable. With two men at each other's throats in the house, anyone would be on edge."

Evelyn nearly choked on her porridge.

"Relax, just joking. Alexander only looked around the apartment last night and left without a word."

She lowered her head and scooped another spoonful of plain porridge.

This was merely the calm before the storm. There was no way he'd let go so easily.

"I'm heading to the Asian supermarket later. Want to come?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"Then get some rest. I'll be back soon."

While clearing the dishes, she noticed his arm was still bandaged and took over washing up.

Before leaving, Gregory tried to leave his phone with her, but she insisted he take it.

As soon as she finished drying her hands after seeing him off, the doorbell rang.

Peering through the peephole at the familiar figure, she took a deep breath and opened the door.

A phone was pressed into her palm.

Alexander strode straight to the dining table and pulled out a chair. "Did you enjoy breakfast?"

She closed the door and followed, quickly typing on her memo app: Where's Simon?

The text was too small. He leaned in to read it, then scoffed and leaned back. "I thought you'd share the breakfast menu with me."

Porridge and salad.

"Full?"

She nodded.

"Pack your things. You're moving in with me."

Evelyn frowned.

"Don't want to pack? Fine. We'll buy whatever you need."

"..."

"Reluctant to leave? Developed feelings for this place after one day?"

We're divorced, Alexander. I came to England to end this completely.

The smile on his lips faded.

Perhaps it had been forced to begin with, now vanishing without resistance.

"I know." His voice was low. "I did consider letting go. I wronged you, and I'll always be here if you need help. But—"

You're forcing me now.

"Because I realized I can't do it." His gaze snapped up. "Evelyn, let's remarry."

She shook her head slowly but firmly.

Alexander wasn't surprised by her reaction, merely quirking his lips slightly. "As for Simon..."
###Chapter 354 Even My Breath Is Wrong

Evelyn stared at her phone screen, fingers hovering above the keyboard.

Alexander leaned back in his chair, watching her trembling fingertips.

"About Simon... You really don't want to know?"

Her fingers struck the screen forcefully: [The police can't find him. You think you can?]

"H City isn't that big."

[So?]

Alexander suddenly leaned forward, his shadow engulfing her. "Are you worried I'll break the law? Or worried about him?"

Evelyn jerked her head up, meeting his fathomless gaze.

She typed rapidly: [Uncle Dempsey contacted me.]

"Heh." Alexander straightened, loosening his tie. "The Dempseys afraid of trouble?"

[Simon took me from their house.]

"So you'd rather let him go?" His voice turned icy. "He nearly destroyed your voice."

Her fingers paused for a second: [The law will punish him.]

"The law?" Alexander sneered. "Where was the law when he committed marriage fraud? When he kidnapped you?"

Evelyn clenched her phone.

Alexander suddenly gripped her chin. "Evelyn, when will you start thinking about yourself?"

She wrenched free. The phone clattered to the floor.

He picked it up. The unsent message glowed on screen: [I'm no saint, but I won't become someone like you.]

His pupils constricted.

"Someone like me?" Each word was a dagger. "Is that how you see me?"

Harsh corridor lights carved shadows across his profile.

Evelyn reached for her phone. He held it just out of reach.

"Loving you is wrong. Caring for you is wrong. Now even my breath is wrong." His voice cracked. "Evelyn, have you ever truly moved on?"

Her hand froze mid-air.

Alexander stepped closer, his breath hot against her ear: "That child—"

Evelyn recoiled, her back hitting the wall.

He shoved the phone into her hand. New text appeared: [If I'd known about the baby, I'd never have chosen Annabelle.]

Her fingers shook as she read it.

[Easy to say now.]

Alexander seized her wrist. "Then tell me—what should I have done?"

She yanked free. The screen vibrated with her furious typing: [STAY AWAY FROM ME!]

His eyes turned glacial.

"Fine. Perfect." He took two steps back, lips twisting into a mirthless smile. "So in your eyes, I'm not even worthy of redemption."

Footsteps echoed down the hall.

Evelyn turned to leave—then glass shattered behind her.

Alexander had punched through the fire alarm casing. Blood dripped between his fingers.
###Chapter 355: There's No Future for Us

"You've already decided the ending from the start." Alexander Hamilton's voice was low and restrained. "You made the choice for me without giving me a say."

Evelyn Carter's fingers hovered over her phone screen, trembling slightly: I made myself clear that day at the hospital entrance.

"Right. You arranged everything perfectly." His bitter laugh was hollow. "The child's future, my career, even your own exit plan. You thought of everything—except whether I wanted any of it."

This conversation is over.

"This thorn has been festering between us for too long." Alexander pressed a hand to his chest. "You keep running, and I can't catch up. The wound is infected. When will we finally face it?"

There is no future for us.

"There will be." His voice hardened with stubborn conviction. "There has to be."

Then we'll talk when that future arrives.

Alexander drew a deep breath. "The fact that we're even having this conversation is progress."

A sudden ringtone shattered the tension.

Evelyn glimpsed "Emily Zade" flashing on the caller ID.

"Speak." Alexander answered without preamble.

"Mr. Hamilton, Polytechnic University is confirming the groundbreaking ceremony date."

"Funding secured?"

"Fully processed. The school hopes you'll attend."

"Decline."

"Understood. I've sent three potential construction start dates—"

"Earliest one."

As the call ended, Evelyn caught the key detail.

Polytechnic University.

Emily Anderson's acceptance letter still lay in her bag.

"The lab building donation is for the Materials Science department." Alexander adjusted his cufflinks, tone indifferent. "Your sister will benefit."

Stop doing these things.

"It's nothing." He shrugged. "Hamilton Group allocates charity funds annually. This year's focus simply shifted."

Evelyn's fingers clenched around her sleeve.

Alexander stood. "The move is your choice. But Evelyn—you know exactly what it means when a woman moves into a man's home."

Three days vanished like smoke.

The hospital corridor reeked of antiseptic at dawn.

Evelyn's voice had regained some strength, though still hoarse.

A British doctor paced anxiously outside her office.

"Why is she refusing the exam?" His thick accent sharpened with frustration as he addressed a nurse. "I'm trying to help her."
###Chapter 356 Unexpected Reunion

The nurse looked troubled. "That gentleman insists on a female doctor. We've explained multiple times already."

The male doctor frowned. "If it comes to it, we'll have to recommend they transfer hospitals."

"But his wife could go into labor any minute. Transferring now would be too risky—"

The nurse suddenly noticed Evelyn Carter standing at the end of the hallway and hurried over. "Excuse me, are you...?"

Evelyn was absorbed in reviewing maternity records when the voice interrupted her. "Can I help you?"

"I heard you're the new OB-GYN doctor starting today?"

"Yes, I'm Dr. Evelyn Carter."

The nurse exhaled in relief. "Perfect! Could you assist us with something?"

Inside the patient room, the nurse explained quietly. "This Chinese couple has a unique situation. The expectant mother strongly resists male doctors."

Evelyn quickly grasped the circumstances. The Chinese couple worked in England, and the wife, now in active labor, had deep psychological barriers against male physicians delivering her baby.

"Honey, the female doctor is here!" The husband called out in Mandarin when he saw Evelyn.

She gave a slight nod. "I'm Dr. Carter."

The husband beamed. "Thank goodness! Dr. Carter, my wife is about to give birth. Can you take over?"

"I'm sorry, but I just started. Hospital policy requires three months before new doctors can handle deliveries independently."

The wife's eyes welled up. "My friend had a terrible experience with a male doctor... I just can't..."

Before she could finish, the door swung open.

"Darling!"

The wife sat up, delighted. "You actually came? Weren't you preparing for your wedding?"

"How could I miss your delivery?" The newcomer laughed. "He insisted on coming too."

The wife pinched her husband's arm enviously. "Look at them!"

Her husband pouted. "I've been by your side this whole time!"

"It's not the same! Her fiancé is so thoughtful!" The wife turned to her friend. "You two are so sweet together. I'm jealous."

Her friend shook her head with a smile. "He just didn't want me traveling abroad alone."

"More like he couldn't bear to be apart!" The wife teased. "Unlike my blockhead husband..."

The husband gave Evelyn an embarrassed glance. "Dr. Carter, please excuse us..."

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the friend, her lips curving slightly.

This chance encounter was proving far more interesting than she'd anticipated.
###Chapter 357: The Confrontation Behind the Masks

"Miss Taylor."

The familiar voice made Annabelle whirl around. Her eyes widened, feigned delight quickly spreading across her face. "Oh my god, Dr. Carter? What are you doing in England?"

Evelyn watched her performance coldly.

Her acting had improved.

Whoever trained this spoiled heiress had done a remarkable job.

"I'm here for work," Evelyn replied flatly.

"That's wonderful! With your skills, you'll surely make a name for yourself here."

"Thanks."

A pregnant woman nearby interjected curiously, "Darling, you know this doctor?"

Annabelle's smile faltered for a split second. "Yes. She treated me after my car accident back home. She's renowned in Hudson City."

The woman immediately brightened. "What a coincidence!" She turned to her husband with a pout. "I want Dr. Carter handling my prenatal care. Go arrange it."

The man sighed and left obediently.

Annabelle eagerly rummaged through a cabinet. "Dr. Carter, try these preserved plums? I brought them from home."

Evelyn didn't take them.

"Maybe doctors don't like cured foods," Annabelle explained awkwardly.

The pregnant woman chimed in, "I'll have my family send something else—"

"Unnecessary." Evelyn turned to leave.

"Dr. Carter—"

Annabelle chased her into the hallway, blocking her path.

"What do you want?"

"Is Alexander in England too?"

"No idea."

"He must be." Annabelle lowered her voice. "He came looking for you, didn't he? Do you know how much work he's neglected because of you? The entire Hamilton Group's projects are delayed..."

"So you're here to blame me?"

"I wouldn't dare."

Evelyn smirked. "No audience now. Drop the act. I remember everything that happened on that cruise."

Annabelle's expression shifted instantly.

Her lips curled. "Then let me be blunt. What spell did you cast on my parents? Why are they suddenly treating you so well?"

"Ask them yourself."

"I did!" Annabelle seethed. "They just said they're atoning for my sins. But I saw them amend their will—they're leaving everything to you! That makes no sense!"

"What do you think the reason is?"

"You threatened them, didn't you?" Her eyes darkened. "Using Alexander as leverage? One word from you, and he'd discard me without hesitation, right?"

"I don't have that kind of influence."

"Stop pretending!" Annabelle's composure cracked. "You hate me! You hate that I almost killed you! Now you're taking revenge—stealing my family's fortune and making Alexander abandon me!"

Evelyn met her gaze icily. "Exactly. I'm taking everything from the Taylors, then having Alexander throw you out. Just wait and see."
###Chapter 358: Stop Calling or You're Blocked

A light drizzle drifted through London's streets.

Evelyn Carter stood by the hospital corridor window, watching raindrops trace winding paths down the glass.

Annabelle Taylor's shrill voice cut through the air behind her: "Don't even think about taking anything from me!"

Evelyn turned calmly, replying in Mandarin: "No one here understands you. Save your breath."

"Alexander will always be mine!" Annabelle's nails dug into her palms. "My parents too!"

A phone buzzed.

Annabelle startled like a frightened rabbit. "You're recording this?!"

Evelyn leisurely pulled out her phone, swiping the screen with one finger. "Oops. Seems I accidentally hit record."

Annabelle's face drained of color.

"Let's make a deal." Evelyn pocketed the device. "Make Alexander disappear from my life completely, and this recording never reaches him."

"You—"

"Including your parents," Evelyn added. "I'll cut all ties myself."

Suspicion flickered in Annabelle's eyes. "You'd really walk away?"

"With pleasure."

......

On her office desk, a phone screen lit up.

[Alexander Hamilton: Why aren't you responding?]

Evelyn smirked.

He'd actually saved her number.

[Busy.]

The instant she sent it, another message arrived: [What time do you finish? I'll pick you up.]

[No.]

The phone rang abruptly.

She declined the call.

[Next time you call, I block you.]

Silence reclaimed the world.

A blonde colleague approached. "Evelyn, that couple insists on transferring hospitals."

"Follow protocol." She didn't look up.

"I thought you'd take the case," the colleague mused. "Since they're your compatriots."

Evelyn closed the medical chart. "I'm still new here. Not experienced enough."

"Fair enough." He shrugged. "I'm Eric, by the way."

"Hello."

Eric lowered his voice. "Gregory says you're his girlfriend?"

"Gregory?"

"Gregory Wilson from Cambridge Med." He winked. "He specifically asked me to look out for you."
###Chapter 359: I Brought Her Here

The elevator doors opened, and Evelyn Carter immediately spotted the familiar figure.

Gregory Wilson was leaning against the wall, waiting for her.

"Not him."

Eric Whitmore dramatically shrugged. "Goodness, poor Greg. Still hasn't won you over."

Evelyn hung up her white coat. "No need for special treatment. Just treat me like any other colleague."

Eric winked. "You're sure you're not his girlfriend?"

"Positive."

The first day at work was uneventful.

As soon as her shift ended, she packed up and prepared to leave. Her phone's notes listed several apartment addresses she'd carefully selected.

The moment she stepped out of the hospital, a sharp honk nearly made her jump out of her skin.

Richard Jackson poked his head out of the car window, looking apologetic. "Sorry, sorry! Just got this car—still getting used to it."

Evelyn pressed a hand to her chest. "Here for a patient?"

"Yeah, visiting someone."

"Go ahead then. I’ll head out."

"Wait—" Richard quickly got out and blocked her path.

She gave him a puzzled look.

"You know your way around the hospital?"

She’d memorized the layout earlier that day.

"Where do you need to go?"

"Burn Department."

"Third floor, turn right. It's next to the nurse's station."

Richard scratched his head. "Mind showing me the way? I always get lost in hospitals."

Evelyn pointed to the information desk. "The nurses there can help."

"But I ran into you! Remember how I helped you at the pharmacy?"

Richard was genuinely kind—soft-spoken and good-natured.

No wonder Annabelle had chosen him back then.

"Come on, Dr. Carter. Do me a favor..."

Before she knew it, she was being ushered into the elevator. Richard swiftly pressed the button for the third floor.

The moment the doors closed, Evelyn realized she’d been tricked.

On the third floor, Richard blocked the doors again. "It’s to the right, right?"

The elevator descended without them.

Evelyn sighed. "All the way down the hall."

"Let’s go. Lead the way..."

When they pushed open the Burn Department doors, Alexander Hamilton was sitting with his back to them.

His entire back and arms were covered in horrific burns.

Hearing the noise, he turned his head.

Richard grinned. "Brought her here. I’ll go handle the paperwork."

Alexander nodded. "Thanks."

Two nurses were gently tending to his wounds.

He didn’t seem to feel any pain—his eyes were fixed on her. "Sit."

"How did you get hurt this badly?"

Alexander’s lips twitched. "You never asked."

"You’re surrounded by people who can take care of you."

"I’m human, not invincible. The wounds reopened in the rain."

Evelyn looked away. "Get proper treatment. I should go."

"Running away again?"
###Chapter 360: You Wanted to Know Simon's Whereabouts? I'll Tell You

"I've seen all I needed to see." Evelyn Carter took a step back. "I'm an OB-GYN. I don't handle trauma cases."

Alexander Hamilton scoffed. "Yet you had no problem treating Gregory Wilson's injuries."

"Think whatever you want." She turned to leave.

"Wait." His fingers closed around her wrist. "Getting an audience with you is harder than meeting the president."

A nearby nurse stifled a giggle. "Sir, is this your girlfriend?"

"Wife." His tone brooked no argument.

"Alexander!" She frowned.

"Fine, I'll drop it." His voice softened. "You wanted to know Simon Stapleton's whereabouts?"

Evelyn froze.

"I genuinely don't know where he is now."

She tried to pull away.

"Patience." His grip tightened, making his wound throb. He hissed in pain.

The nurse gasped. "Sir, don't move!"

Evelyn eyed his unrelenting hold. "Self-harm strategy? Doesn't seem like your style."

"Effective though." His thumb brushed her pulse point. "Sit. Listen."

With a sigh, she complied.

"I did take him to Hamilton Group's garage." His gaze darkened. "After what he did to you, I wanted him dead. But disposing of a full-grown man isn't simple."

"And?"

"Taught him a lesson and let him go."

"What lesson?"

"Since he enjoys climbing the social ladder through women," Alexander smirked, "I arranged two hundred for him."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "...Two hundred?"

"Mhm."

"He...could handle that?"

Alexander burst out laughing. "How would I know? Wasn't about to spectate."

"All of them...?"

"You're blushing."

"Am not!"

"Your ears are scarlet."

"Shut up!"

"Alright, alright." He bit back a chuckle. "Released him afterward. If even the police can't find him, he's either well-hidden or has help—like your dear Peter Harrison."

He watched for her reaction.

She was still processing the number, visibly dazed.

"Evelyn?"

"Hmm?"

"What's on your mind?"

She pressed her lips together. "I was thinking..."

"Ask me anything."

"Not you." She shook her head.

"Then who—"

A shocked voice cut through from the doorway. "Alexander?!"

His expression hardened. "What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 361: Alexander's Ruthless Move

Annabelle cradled a bouquet of pink roses, her smile sweet. "I told you yesterday—Nina's due date is here. I came to support her. I ran into Richard downstairs, and he mentioned you were here for a dressing change."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Your friend is in the UK?"

"Yes, in the OB-GYN ward."

"Then why are you still lingering here?"

"No rush." Her gaze dropped to his bandaged arm, concern flashing in her eyes. "Why did your injury suddenly worsen? It was almost healed back home. Did you get it wet? The doctor said—"

"Enough." His voice was ice. "My affairs are none of your concern."

Annabelle nodded obediently, then turned to Evelyn. "Dr. Carter, you're here too."

Evelyn remained silent.

Unfazed, Annabelle smiled. "I'll leave you two to talk. I should check on Nina."

The moment she was out of earshot, Alexander rushed to explain. "I had no idea she'd come to the UK."

"Hmm."

"Her friend's in OB-GYN. Have you seen them today?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No."

Alexander exhaled in relief, muttering under his breath, "She wouldn't dare cause trouble now."

Evelyn's lips twitched. "True. She's changed."

She stood to leave.

Alexander caught her wrist. "Where are you going?"

"To make a call."

"To whom?"

"None of your business."

"I'm not trying to control you," he said, frustration seeping into his tone. "I just don't want you disappearing again."

"Vivian."

"...Fine. I'll be quick. Wait for me."

Evelyn pushed through the door without looking back.

Outside, Annabelle was pressed against the door, eavesdropping. The sudden movement made her jump, a squeak escaping before she clapped a hand over her mouth.

Their eyes locked.

Evelyn smirked coldly and strode toward the stairwell, dialing.

"Hello?" Vivian's voice came through.

"It's me."

"Evelyn?! Did you get a new number?"

"Temporary." Evelyn cleared her hoarse throat. "Better than before—at least I can speak now."

Vivian's voice softened. "Get some fritillary bulb and pear soup. It'll help your throat."

"Got it." Evelyn cut to the chase. "About Simon Stapleton..."

After hearing the full story, the line went silent for a long moment.

Finally, Vivian managed two words: "Holy hell."

"So Alexander likely didn't touch him. Tell your dad not to worry."

"...Evelyn, do you think Simon's even alive?"

Evelyn paused. "Alexander said he let him go. Unless the Hardy family retaliated?"

"I mean... two hundred women. Could he have... you know... died from exhaustion?"

Evelyn choked on air.

"You're a doctor. Give me a professional opinion."

"I'm an OB-GYN!"

"Take an educated guess."

"How would I—"

Vivian let out an impressed whistle. "Alexander's move was brutal. Destroying a man's pride is worse than killing him."
###Chapter 362 He's Visiting OB-GYN?

"Still talking?"

Alexander's voice suddenly came from behind, startling Evelyn so badly she nearly dropped her phone.

"Something wrong?"

"No." He shoved his hands into his white coat pockets. "You were gone too long. I came to check."

Evelyn tucked her phone closer to her chest. "I'm at my own hospital. It's not like I'll get lost."

His gaze flickered toward her screen. "Vivian?"

"What, you need her? Want to talk to her?"

He shook his head. "No, go ahead."

Vivian's voice suddenly spiked through the speaker. "Alexander's there? You're together now?"

Evelyn cleared her throat. "I'm at work. He's here as a patient."

"He's visiting OB-GYN?" Vivian laughed mischievously. "Since when did he grow a uterus? This is groundbreaking. Report it to the UN—might win a Nobel Prize."

Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle. "Stop it."

"Seriously, I'm flying over next week to see you. Want anything? I'll mail it first."

"Dr. Wilson said there's an Asian supermarket here. Should be fine."

"Need me to send anything back? I'm in the country now—can run errands for you."

Evelyn thought for a moment. "Get some supplements for my parents and Emily. Deliver them directly."

"No problem. Oh, hand the phone to Alexander."

Evelyn frowned. "What do you want with him?"

"Private matter."

Skeptical, she passed the phone over.

Alexander had been staring out the window, lost in thought. The sudden intrusion made him blink. "What?"

"Vivian says she needs to ask you something."

"The Dempsey family?"

"Maybe."

He took the phone with a single "Hello" before falling silent.

Evelyn strained to listen but only caught Vivian's rapid chatter.

Then Alexander's expression shifted strangely. He glanced at Evelyn, rubbed his nose, and quickly stepped around the corner. "Why are you asking this?"

Watching his retreating back, her stomach dropped.

Did Simon's mess involve the Dempseys?

Why couldn't she know?

A terrible thought flashed—could that day in the cabin have...?

Her fingers clenched the hem of her white coat.

But she dismissed it immediately. Though bound, her clothes had been intact, her body undisturbed. As a doctor, she'd know if anything had happened.

Alexander returned swiftly, his ears faintly pink as he handed back the phone.

"The Dempseys are fine?" Evelyn cut straight to it.

"Yeah." He cleared his throat. "Just a bribed maid. She's already detained. As long as you don't press charges, they're clear."

She exhaled in relief. "Good."

"Do you want to press charges?"
###Chapter 363: Stay and Help Me Apply the Medicine

Alexander's gaze darkened. "The Dempseys owe you an explanation."

"Uncle Dempsey treats me like his own daughter. Vivian is my closest friend."

"You're lenient with everyone except me."

"I'm harshest with myself."

Alexander's pupils contracted sharply. The memory of that stormy afternoon flashed through his mind—the bloodied flesh consumed by flames.

"What did Vivian tell you?"

"Nothing."

"About me?"

"No."

"Then why avoid me?"

A suspicious flush crept up Alexander's ears. "...It really has nothing to do with you."

"You're acting strange."

Alexander took a deep breath. "She asked me if a man could... with two hundred women..."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "What?"

"She said she asked you first, but you didn't know. She was curious about male... limitations."

Evelyn massaged her temples. That sounded exactly like Vivian.

"How did you answer?"

Alexander calculated stiffly. "Four days and three nights. 5,040 minutes. Roughly 25 minutes per person."

"25 minutes... seems plausible?"

"That's me." Alexander scoffed. "Other men might not manage."

"How do you know I haven't seen other samples?"

Alexander tensed instantly. "Who?"

"Guess."

"Peter Harrison? Gregory Wilson?"

"Neither."

Alexander gripped her shoulders. "Who, then?!"

Evelyn whispered, "Sola Aoi."

Alexander froze. "When did you meet a Japanese woman?"

Then realization dawned. He laughed angrily. "What nonsense has Vivian been showing you—"

"It popped up from a virus."

"Stop clicking random ads."

"Mm."

"...How much did you watch?"

"Can't remember. But they all... seemed to exceed 25 minutes?"

Alexander gritted his teeth. "Those sites need to be shut down."

"Can you enforce that?"

"No." He glared. "We're buying you a new computer."

"My old one has important files."

"I'll extract the hard drive."

"I don't know how."

"I'll do it!"

Evelyn checked the time. "I need to go."

"So soon?"

"Mm."

"Date?"

"Buying gifts for my parents."

Alexander visibly relaxed. "The supermarket's in the mall's basement."

"I'll check the map."

"No need." He shook the medicine bag in his hand. "Stay and help me apply this first."
###Chapter 364: He Came Looking for You

Evelyn's brows furrowed. "You ran out before finishing your treatment?"

"I was afraid you'd disappear again."

"..."

Without another word, Alexander grabbed her wrist and pulled her back to the Burn Department.

Two nurses exchanged knowing smiles. "Found your wife?" one asked in English.

"Yes. Sorry for the delay."

"No problem. Shall we continue?"

Alexander unbuttoned his suit jacket and shrugged it off. Bloodstains bloomed across the back of his white dress shirt.

"Could you hold this for me?"

Evelyn took the jacket, her fingertips brushing against lingering warmth.

"Thanks." His eyes softened with gratitude.

As the nurses tended to his wounds, Evelyn scrolled through her phone's map. Suddenly, his phone vibrated in the jacket pocket.

"It's your mother."

"You answer it."

"..."

"She rarely calls these days. Must be urgent."

Remembering Margaret's hypertension, Evelyn pressed answer. "Hello?"

"Who...?" The voice hesitated. "Evelyn? Your voice..."

"My throat's healing."

Margaret choked back a sob. "It really is you..."

"Alexander's getting treated. I'll have him call you back."

"No need." Margaret's voice trembled. "I just wanted to confirm he found you."

Evelyn's fingers stiffened.

Teresa's anxious voice came through the line. "Is Terry alright?"

Margaret explained, "Annabelle's parents have been worried sick about you."

"I see."

"They visit the temple daily. Their eyes are swollen from crying."

Evelyn watched plane tree leaves drift past the window. "I'm fine."

"Those wounds on Alexander's back—"

"The nurses are handling it."

Margaret lowered her voice. "He's been searching for you like a madman these past days."

Evelyn saw the nurse plucking bloodied gauze with tweezers.

"Evelyn," Margaret sighed, "give him a chance. That boy... I've never seen him so broken."
###Chapter 365: The Cruise Wedding Invitation

The phone screen dimmed as Evelyn Carter exhaled sharply.

Her knuckles turned white from gripping the device.

"You look pale," Alexander Hamilton's voice came from behind, laced with concern.

She instinctively stepped back. "I'm fine."

"What did my mother say?"

"Nothing important." Avoiding his gaze, she moved toward the door. "Your clothes are here. I have to go."

Alexander reached out. "Evelyn—"

The door slammed shut.

At the hospital entrance, Richard Jackson approached. "Where's Alexander?"

"He's getting his dressing changed on the third floor." She didn't slow her pace.

The setting sun stretched her shadow long across the pavement.

Only when standing before the villa did Evelyn realize her hands were empty. She pulled up her GPS and headed straight for the nearest mall.

Silk scarves, imported wine, snacks—the weight of the shipping receipts pressed into her palm.

Yet nothing for that couple.

"You're late," Gregory Wilson observed from the doorway, brow furrowed.

"I was mailing some things home."

His gaze lingered on her face. "Did Alexander seek you out again?"

"Yes."

"He tracks your every move." Gregory's Adam's apple bobbed. "Free this weekend?"

"No plans yet."

"My friend's hosting a cruise wedding." His lips curved unexpectedly. "Care to catch some wedding bliss?"

"Cruise?"

"Ocean liner." He looked toward the horizon. "When dawn breaks over the water, it's like the whole world ignites."

Salt air seemed to brush her cheeks already.

"Sunlight heals all wounds," he murmured.
###Chapter 366 Avoiding Alexander Hamilton

A cruise wedding was a novel experience for Evelyn Carter.

She stood hesitantly before the closet.

"Do I need formal attire?" she asked Gregory Wilson.

Gregory adjusted his collar. "Treat it like a casual gathering with friends. Wear whatever makes you comfortable."

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Her suitcase contained only everyday clothes. She selected a simple white T-shirt and black maxi skirt—understated yet elegant.

When Gregory arrived to pick her up, he chuckled at her outfit.

"I'm dressed even more casually than you." He tugged at his polo shirt.

Evelyn finally relaxed.

Her phone buzzed in her purse. Vivian Dempsey's name flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn!" Vivian's voice brimmed with energy. "That doctor worked miracles—Grandma's doing much better!"

Evelyn smiled. "That's wonderful."

"I'll fly to England to see you in a few days!"

"No rush. Spend more time with your grandmother."

After hanging up, Alexander Hamilton's missed call notification still blinked. Evelyn decisively turned off the screen.

The dock came into view. Sunlight danced on the azure waves.

Gregory parked and gallantly opened her car door.

Among the boarding crowd, some wore swim trunks while others sported flip-flops. Evelyn's tension melted away completely.

"Do you know the bride and groom?" she inquired.

Gregory's gaze flickered. "The bride is my senior from the anesthesiology department. The groom...we're not well acquainted."

"A businessman?"

"Yes."

Ocean breeze caressed the deck. Evelyn inhaled deeply. "Go mingle. I'd like some time alone."

Gregory hesitated. "Are you sure?"

"Absolutely." A faint smile touched her lips. "After all, my only goal today was avoiding Alexander."

Someone waved at Gregory in the distance.

"Go ahead." Evelyn nudged him gently. "I'll just enjoy the ocean view here."

Before leaving, Gregory reminded her, "The lounge is available if you get tired."

"Got it."

Leaning against the railing, Evelyn watched seagulls skim the water's surface. Golden sunlight warmed her face.

###Chapter 367 Long Time No See

The sea breeze gently brushed against Evelyn Carter's skirt, making it flutter slightly.

Gregory Wilson had only taken a few steps when a bearded man enthusiastically slung an arm over his shoulder. "Hey, long time no see!"

"Just back to handle some business."

"Staying for good this time?"

"Taking a temporary break."

"Good for you. You surgeons work way too hard."

Gregory gave a faint nod.

The bearded man suddenly lowered his voice. "That Oriental beauty in white—your girlfriend?"

Their conversation faded into the distance.

Evelyn only saw Gregory shake his head.

Her phone vibrated.

[Where are you?]

[The house is empty. I'm worried.]

[Reply as soon as you see this.]

Joyful laughter rang out nearby.

Evelyn looked up.

An Asian woman in a white veil was surrounded by a crowd, her face radiant with happiness.

She wore a simple beige gown, every movement exuding grace.

The woman seemed to sense Evelyn's gaze and turned.

Their eyes met, and she froze for a moment.

Evelyn offered a polite smile and nod.

The next second, the bride lifted her skirt and hurried over, eyes sparkling. "Hi, I'm Lily."

"I'm Evelyn, Dr. Wilson's friend."

"I know you," Lily said, taking her hand. "You're the one in Gregory's painting."

Evelyn blinked. "But that was just—"

"A silhouette," Lily said with a playful wink. "But I recognized you instantly."

Before Evelyn could protest, Lily linked arms with her. "Come meet my friends."

Evelyn barely had time to refuse before she was swept into the center of the group.

"Everyone, this is Evelyn," Lily announced, drawing out the words. "Gregory's special friend."

Gasps erupted around them.

"So it's you!"

Evelyn was bewildered. "You all...?"

"We've all seen that painting," Lily explained with a grin. "Gregory hung it in the most prominent spot in his living room."

"Oh my God, he's been hiding you all this time."

"No wonder he never gave Lucy the time of day."

Lily stifled a laugh. "Don't remind me. That confession nearly scared him off for good."
###Chapter 368: Did You Forget Who My Fiancé Is?

The surrounding girls burst into laughter, their gazes flickering suggestively between Evelyn and Gregory.

Evelyn frowned slightly. "Why would they be scared?"

The bride, Linda, leaned in conspiratorially. "Last Christmas party, Lucy wore a sheer camisole dress to take Gregory home. The next day, he moved out without even collecting his security deposit."

Evelyn arched a brow. "That dramatic?"

"Absolutely," Linda whispered. "Later, we made a bet—anyone who could get Gregory to spare a second glance would win a thousand bucks. The prize money’s still with me."

Before she could finish, a saccharine voice called from behind. "Linda, happy wedding!"

Linda spun around, delighted. "Oh my god, Annabelle!"

"A gift for you."

Linda eagerly unwrapped the velvet box and gasped. "This is Tiffany’s limited edition—"

Annabelle gracefully tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Do you like it?"

"It’s too extravagant..."

"Did you forget who my fiancé is?" Annabelle chuckled meaningfully.

Linda immediately caught on. "Alexander bought this? Then I won’t hold back!"

"Him?" Annabelle cooed. "If I asked for the stars, he’d build me a ladder."

Evelyn retreated two steps without a word, melting into the shadows of the crowd.

At the banquet hall entrance, Alexander Hamilton ended a call with a furrowed brow. His silver-gray suit accentuated his tall frame, but couldn’t mask the exhaustion in his eyes.

"Alexander!" Annabelle hurried over, her silver fringe dress clinging to her curves. She looped her arm through his. "You’re late."

He withdrew his hand. "Business."

"Don’t be like that," she murmured. "My parents are watching."

His gaze sharpened, but he didn’t push her away again.

Annabelle triumphantly led him toward the group. "Everyone, this is my fiancé, Alexander Hamilton."

Linda eagerly showed off the necklace. "Mr. Hamilton, you’re too generous."

Alexander glanced at the jewelry, his expression instantly frosty. "You bought this?"

Annabelle’s smile faltered. "The designer insisted you had to—"

"Using my name?" His voice was soft, yet the temperature around them plummeted.

Annabelle rushed to explain. "I thought since Linda’s getting married—"

"Never again." He turned to leave, but Annabelle clung to him desperately.

"Just ten minutes," she pleaded, eyes glistening. "Please."

Alexander’s gaze swept the room—then paused at a corner. Evelyn stood there, sipping champagne, her hair obscuring half her face.

"Five minutes," he said coldly.
###Chapter 369: Cabin Confrontation

Linda's Mandarin carried a thick accent, yet her words were deliberately clear.

She softened her tone, eyes pleading.

Alexander Hamilton idly swirled his glass, ice cubes clinking. "As you wish."

"Thank you!" Linda clapped excitedly. "When you hold your wedding, I must visit China. I hear the feasts last three days and nights?"

Alexander's fingers tightened abruptly. Condensation slid down his knuckles as his gaze sharpened toward Annabelle.

Annabelle quickly changed the subject. "Linda, where's your wedding gown? Why aren't you wearing it?"

"That bulky dress would ruin my dancing." Linda laughed, suddenly grabbing Evelyn Carter's wrist. "Let me introduce our mystery guest—"

Evelyn was yanked into the crowd's center, unprepared for the two piercing stares that locked onto her.

One scorching enough to burn through her. The other frigid as glacial ice.

"This is the Eastern beauty from my favorite oil painting! Her name is Evelyn. Isn't she more stunning than the portrait?"

Evelyn lowered her lashes.

She could feel those twin gazes dissecting her inch by inch.

"Evelyn, meet my dear friends—Jane and her fiancé Alexander." Linda beamed. "Alexander's the devoted type. He pursued Jane for ten whole years!"

Evelyn lifted her eyes, lips curving. "Congratulations."

The air turned to stone.

Annabelle's face drained of color. Alexander let out a cold laugh, switching to Mandarin. "Phone broken?"

"No."

"Then why ignore my calls?"

"I didn't want to answer."

"So you'd rather elope with Gregory Wilson?"

"Yes."

Alexander's knuckles whitened. The glass creaked ominously in his grip. "Running from me? Or running to him?"

"Which answer would you prefer?"

"Where is he?" Alexander scanned the room. "Ditched you here alone while he hides?"

"Why do you need him?"

"What do you think?"

Uncle Dempsey's warning flashed through Evelyn's mind—the maritime disaster where Alexander was the sole survivor.

Her fingers instinctively clenched the railing. "Today's meant for celebration."

Alexander's chest heaved before he finally hissed, "Engine room. Ten minutes."

Linda leaned in curiously. "What were you discussing? You all know Evelyn?"

Annabelle forced a smile. "We're... old friends."

"What a coincidence!"

"Yes..."

Alexander slammed his glass onto a passing tray. "Excuse me."

As he passed Evelyn, he paused just long enough to whisper, "Dare to skip this, and see what happens."

His silhouette vanished into the ship's shadows, leaving only shattered ice in his wake.
###Chapter 370: My Life, My Rules

The sea breeze brushed against her face as Annabelle leaned against the ship's railing, her eyes glinting. "Dr. Carter, aren't you going inside to rest?"

Linda happened to pass by and asked with concern, "Evelyn, should I call Gregory back to keep you company?"

Evelyn shook her head. The last thing she wanted was to run into him right now.

"Then enjoy the ocean view," Linda said with a smile. "There's a buffet in the dining hall, and all six cabins are open for use. I should go prepare now."

Watching Linda walk away surrounded by her bridesmaids, Evelyn turned to Annabelle, who hadn't moved. "Aren't you leaving?"

Annabelle sauntered closer but deliberately maintained distance. "Gregory Wilson brought you to such an intimate private wedding. Your relationship must be special."

Evelyn gazed at the distant horizon and didn't respond.

This wedding was unusual—no bridal gown, no elders, only close friends. She understood Gregory's intentions but chose not to acknowledge them.

"I'm the groom's friend," Annabelle suddenly said. "I handled his divorce case from his last marriage."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "I see."

Annabelle spun around abruptly. "Name your price."

"What?"

"Leave Alexander."

Evelyn scoffed. "I've already fled abroad. Isn't that enough?"

"Your hospital's overseas assignment list reveals your location!" Annabelle snapped. "Can't you disappear somewhere he can't find you?"

"Why should I?" Evelyn's gaze turned sharp. "Why should my life make way for you?"

"You're just stringing him along!"

"If I wanted to string him along, you wouldn't even get close to him." Evelyn turned to leave. "Instead of wasting time here, go find him yourself. There are five cabins—take your pick."

Annabelle froze in place.

Without looking back, Evelyn walked toward the cabins. The six cabins lined both sides of the ship, so quiet the sound of waves was all that remained.
###Chapter 371 Alexander Must Be in There

Laughter and chatter spilled from the dressing room.

As Evelyn passed by, she glimpsed Linda through the half-open door. The bride sat before the vanity in a fiery red dress, applying lipstick while her bridesmaids giggled around her, adjusting the hem of her gown.

Five cabins lined the hallway. Four stood open.

Only the one at the far end remained tightly shut.

Evelyn paused briefly.

She walked straight to the cabin opposite the dressing room and locked the door behind her.

The space was compact but well-appointed.

A mini fridge stocked with assorted drinks sat beside a small sofa. Since she didn’t drink, Evelyn moved to the window seat instead.

Seagulls circled the ship’s wake, their wings skimming the azure waves.

The noise outside grew louder.

"Linda, your necklace is crooked!"

"Oh my god, these heels are impossible to walk in..."

Footsteps faded down the hall.

Her phone vibrated in her palm.

[Gregory: The reception’s starting. Where are you?]

She typed back: [Resting in my cabin. Not going.]

[Not feeling well?]

[Just need quiet.]

[Want me to come over?]

[No.]

The typing indicator appeared.

[I think I just saw Annabelle.]

Evelyn immediately called him.

"She introduced herself as the groom’s lawyer," Evelyn said, watching the horizon. "Does Linda know Paul was divorced?"

A soft chuckle came through the line. "Westerners are more relaxed about marriage. Second or third weddings are common here."

"That’s good."

"You’ve grown wary of men lately."

The corner of Evelyn’s mouth twitched.

Alexander. Peter Harrison. Simon Stapleton.

Even Vincent Wilson was a notorious playboy.

"Older generations had more stable marriages," Gregory said. "My parents never argued in thirty years."

"Different times."

"Some of our peers are reliable."

"Such as?"

"Me."

Silence filled the line.

Gregory cleared his throat. "Don’t be so pessimistic. You’re still young."

Evelyn suddenly remembered something. "Last time you mentioned knowing Annabelle—was it because of this divorce case?"

A pause.

"Yes."

"Can you tell me about it?"

"Paul’s ex-wife cheated. The child wasn’t his. Annabelle won him a favorable settlement with substantial assets."

"And the child—"
###Chapter 372: A Familiar Profile

"The baby didn't make it." Gregory Wilson's voice carried exhaustion through the phone. "As the attending physician, I testified in court. Only the mother survived."

"Was it a miscarriage?"

"No." His tone lowered. "There were clear signs of external trauma."

Evelyn Carter's grip on the phone trembled. "Who did this?"

"My duty was to provide the medical report."

A distant call interrupted them. Gregory spoke hurriedly, "Are you sure you won't come see her?"

An inexplicable tightness gripped Evelyn's chest. "No. That's all for now."

Hanging up, she watched seagulls circle outside her window. Unease coiled in her gut.

Click—

The doorknob turned abruptly.

"Who's there?" she demanded sharply.

"Sorry—wrong room!" A timid female voice stammered before footsteps retreated in haste.

Evelyn yanked the door open, catching only a fleeting glimpse of a retreating figure.

That profile made her freeze.

It was achingly familiar.

The same contours she saw every morning in her mirror.

Perhaps a trick of the dim lighting.

Her gaze flickered toward Alexander Hamilton's cabin—the door slightly ajar.

He should be at the wedding.

As she reentered her room, a thunderous crash shook her door.

Knocking erupted—frantic, relentless.

"Identify yourself!"

Silence.

The pounding intensified, wood groaning under the assault.

Cautiously, she cracked the door open.

A towering figure collapsed inward.

The stench of alcohol flooded her senses.

Before she could react, she was pinned against the wall. Scorching lips crushed hers with bruising force.

"Mmph—"

During the struggle, a familiar voice rasped near her ear: "Quiet... It's me."

"Alexander?!"

"Lock it..." He braced against the wall, veins bulging at his temples.

Her fingers brushed his neck—burning feverishly.

"What's wrong with you?"

"Door. Now." His voice was ragged.

She hesitated.

Whispers slithered from the hallway:

"Checked every cabin. Nothing."
"Impossible! Not on deck or in the lobby—he must be here."

Annabelle Taylor and that girl.

Alexander clamped a hand over her mouth. "Not a sound."
###Chapter 373: You're Never This Gentle

The scent of alcohol lingered in the air.

She frowned slightly.

Had he been drinking?

Alexander Hamilton's full weight pressed against her, his scorching breath grazing her neck.

Something was wrong.

She knew his alcohol tolerance well—he wouldn't be this drunk so easily.

Besides, Annabelle and that unfamiliar girl were still searching for him outside.

"What did you take?" she whispered.

He shook his head, his hair brushing her collarbone.

"Just a little wine..."

His lips nearly touched her skin, burning with unnatural heat.

Evelyn instinctively tried to pull away.

But Alexander tightened his grip on her shoulders. "I've been drugged."

Her chest constricted.

Of course.

"A woman who looked like you approached me," his voice grew hoarser, "I thought it was you."

That girl!

"She knows Annabelle."

Alexander scoffed. "More than just knows."

Footsteps approached outside.

"I heard something..." Annabelle's voice drew nearer.

"Me too."

The doorknob turned.

Alexander kicked the door shut with a sudden force.

BANG!

The violent sound made Evelyn flinch.

He chuckled darkly. "Scared?"

She turned her face away. "Stand properly."

"Can't," his breathing grew ragged, "the drug's too strong..."

"Go lie on the couch."

"Don't move..."

"You—"

"Keep struggling and I'll lose control."

She froze instantly.

Alexander's full weight pinned her, making her legs tremble from the strain.

Knocking resumed.

"Alexander? Are you in there?"

He cursed under his breath.

"What does Annabelle want?" Evelyn whispered.

"Who knows," his words slurred, "she promised to back off... then brought that woman..."

"Who is she?"

"No idea," his consciousness wavered, "Annabelle said... since she can't conceive... found some medical student... looked like you... wanted her to..."

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins.

"She planned to—"

"Yeah," Alexander gave a bitter laugh, "lucky I know your scent... that woman... called me 'Alexander'... but you'd never be this gentle..."

More pounding at the door.

"Anyone there?"

"Annabelle, maybe it's just the wind—"

"Wind doesn't slam doors," Annabelle raised her voice, "must be a burglar! I'll get security!"
###Chapter 374: Leaving an Heir Before Death

Evelyn's nails dug deep into her palms.

She suddenly slammed her hand against the cabin door with enough force to make it shudder. "Dr. Carter! Are you in there?!"

Alexander froze mid-motion.

He pushed himself up, his eyes still dark with desire but now edged with danger. "Looking to die?"

Evelyn tilted her head back, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "What dedication, Mr. Hamilton. The world could be burning outside, and you'd still be busy playing stud."

His expression darkened instantly.

His grip tightened around her waist, threatening to snap her in half. "Say that again."

She gasped at the pain but glared back defiantly. "Am I wrong? Isn't that woman outside just here to breed with you?"

Alexander chuckled, his thumb roughly dragging across her lips. "Jealous?"

"Of what?" She jerked her head away. "I just find it fascinating how low your standards are. Even a knockoff will do."

His eyes flashed, and he abruptly bit down on her earlobe. "A knockoff? Then shouldn't the real thing fulfill her duty?"

Evelyn went rigid.

Just then, the voice outside the door rose sharply. "Dr. Carter! If you don't answer, I'm calling security!"

Alexander stilled.

He slowly straightened, his throat working as the storm in his eyes gradually settled.

"Aren't you going to answer, Mr. Hamilton?" Evelyn seized the chance to shove him away. "Your fiancée is waiting to inspect the goods."

He smirked, leisurely adjusting his cuffs. "Let her wait."

A commotion erupted outside.

"What's going on?" Gregory's voice cut through.

Annabelle immediately switched tones. "Dr. Wilson, Dr. Carter might be in danger inside!"

"What kind of danger?"

"I—I think I saw someone suspicious go in..." Her voice trailed off uncertainly.

Gregory's voice turned icy. "You saw it with your own eyes?"

"I..."

"Jane!" Linda interjected. "First you said you were worried about a thief, now it's a suspicious person?"

Annabelle stammered, lost for words.

Gregory snorted and raised his hand to knock.

"Wait." Alexander's voice, though quiet, carried clearly through the door. "My wife is resting. Is there a problem?"

Silence fell instantly outside.

Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief.

Alexander leaned down, his breath hot against her ear. "You like watching the show? Then let's give them a performance."
###Chapter 375 Hidden Secrets

"No."

"Did you see Evelyn enter this cabin with your own eyes?"

"...No." Annabelle bit her lip. "But I'm sure she came this way. We've searched the lobby, deck, and lounge. This is the only place left."

Paul rolled up his sleeves. "Let's break the door down first. Gregory's friend's safety comes first."

Linda nodded. "Yes, we need to help her."

Gregory raised a hand to stop them. "It's your wedding day. Don't let this delay the ceremony. Leave this to me."

"Evelyn's safety is more important," Linda insisted. "We won't rest until we know she's okay."

Annabelle suddenly interjected, "If we wait any longer, something bad might happen!"

Gregory's gaze sharpened as he noticed a figure hiding behind Annabelle.

"And who is this?"

Annabelle instinctively shifted to block the person. "A friend."

"A friend?" Gregory smirked. "At first glance, I thought it was my wife."

Linda gasped. "She really does look like Evelyn! Jane, why didn't you mention bringing a friend earlier?"

"She... she gets seasick. She was resting."

The girl kept her head down, silent.

Annabelle pressed urgently, "Mr. Wilson, aren't you worried about Evelyn?"

Gregory studied them both, his frown deepening.

Creak—

The cabin door suddenly opened.

Evelyn appeared, rubbing her eyes. "What's going on?"

Linda rushed over. "Evelyn! Are you okay?"

"Was there a thief?" Evelyn glanced at Annabelle. "Everyone on board today was invited."

Linda paused. "That's true..."

Gregory stepped protectively in front of Evelyn. "Do you want to rest a bit longer, or should we go to the lobby?"

"Wait!" Annabelle suddenly barged into the cabin. "There's definitely someone in here!"

Gregory tried to stop her, but it was too late.

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, watching calmly as Annabelle ransacked the cabin.

His racing heart finally settled.
###Chapter 376: His Scent

Linda stepped into the cabin, her high heels clicking against the floor. The hem of her dress brushed the threshold. "Evelyn, are you sure someone's here?"

The cramped space offered no hiding spots.

Annabelle's fingers traced the wrinkles in the bedsheet, her gaze growing more frantic. "He's not here..."

"Who are you looking for?" Linda tilted her head.

"Nothing," Annabelle forced a smile. "I was just worried about Miss Carter's safety."

Linda pressed a hand to her chest. "Oh, Evelyn, you're such a dedicated lawyer."

"You've searched three times," Evelyn leaned against the doorframe. "What exactly are you looking for?"

Annabelle's nails dug into her palm. "Him..."

"Who?"

"A... suspicious person."

Evelyn chuckled. "Do you think I'd harbor a criminal? Or maybe you suspect I stole the yacht's silverware?"

Gregory's expression darkened. "Evelyn, that's enough."

Linda quickly stepped between them. "Gregory, Evelyn was just being professionally cautious—"

"Professionally cautious?" Gregory scoffed. "This cabin couldn't even hide a rat. What is she really after?"

Paul shielded his wife behind him. "Gregory, a lawyer's instincts are often sharp—"

"So you think Evelyn is hiding something too?"

"I'm just saying we should wait—"

"Fine," Evelyn straightened. "Let's see what the great lawyer uncovers."

Everyone held their breath as Annabelle flipped the pillow over.

Seconds ticked by.

A sheen of sweat formed on Annabelle's forehead. She came up empty-handed.

"Satisfied?" Evelyn asked.

Annabelle's lips trembled. "I was only worried about you..."

"Everyone here is a stranger. Who would want to harm me?"

"I—"

Gregory pulled the cabin door open. "Since nothing was found, please return to the banquet hall. Linda, don't let this ruin the wedding."

Linda twisted her fingers guiltily. "Gregory, I'm so sorry."

"You're not the one who should apologize." Gregory glanced at Annabelle. "I'll stay with Evelyn. Does that ease your mind?"

Paul nodded. "We'll feel safer with you here. I'll have champagne sent over later."

As the crowd dispersed, the air grew thick with tension.

Annabelle suddenly grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "Alexander was here, wasn't he?"

"You searched everywhere."

"He had to be!" Annabelle's nails bit into Evelyn's skin. "I can still smell his cologne!"
###Chapter 377 The Truth Emerges

"Fine, if you say he's here, then he's here." Annabelle sneered. "But why gather such a crowd? To witness him in your room? Even if he is here, so what? Who besides us knows about your relationship? To outsiders, it would just look like old friends catching up..."

"Catching up? He clearly drank—"

"Drank what?"

Annabelle bit her lower lip. "How did he leave?"

"He jumped into the sea."

"Jumped?!" Her pupils constricted. "He threw himself into the ocean to protect your reputation?!"

Gregory's expression darkened. "Enough of this."

His sharp gaze shifted to the girl behind Annabelle. "And her—what's your game bringing her aboard?"

Flames of fury ignited in Annabelle's eyes. "Gregory Wilson, do you fancy yourself some white knight? After all these years pining for her, has she ever spared you a glance? She's as cold as stone! She rejected Alexander, she rejects you—she has no heart! Why do you all lose your minds over her—"

"Shut your mouth!" Gregory cut her off sharply. "You don't get to judge her! Take your people and get out of my sight!"

Evelyn had been leaning against the doorway, watching the spectacle with detached amusement, curious about Annabelle's scheme. But Gregory suddenly shoved her inside the cabin and slammed the door shut.

He sank onto the couch, his voice tight with suppressed anger. "Ignore her. Sit."

The couch was cramped, so Evelyn moved to the bed instead.

Gregory's eyes darkened at her deliberate distance. "Did Alexander really jump?"

Evelyn shook her head, pointing to the window. "He climbed out there. Probably on deck now, getting some air."

Gregory grabbed a tissue and handed it to her. "Here."

"Hmm?"

"Your lipstick... it's smudged."

Her ears burned as she took the tissue and wiped her lips.

Gregory inhaled deeply, his fists clenched white. "I thought he cut ties with Annabelle. Why would he come to the wedding with her? Stringing you along while keeping his childhood flame close? Does he think he can have it both ways?"

Evelyn sighed. "I can't figure him out either."

Gregory caught sight of her slightly swollen lips and abruptly turned away. "And you? What do you want?"

"To never see him again."

"Then why did you let him kiss you?!"

"He was drugged." Evelyn frowned. "Annabelle must have done it. Alexander said after she found out she couldn't conceive, she found a girl who looks like me—wanted her to carry his child."

Gregory scoffed. "Surrogacy is illegal. She's a lawyer—how could she not know?"

"Maybe... if it's someone else's egg, it doesn't count?"

Understanding dawned on him. "So she drugged Alexander, brought that girl aboard, hoping he'd mistake her for you?"

"Most likely."

"That way, he'd have no reason to seek you out." Gregory paused. "But if that's the case, why expose you two now?"
###Chapter 378: What You Want, I Can't Give

Evelyn Carter's lips curled into a bitter smile. "She probably wants everyone to see how shamelessly I'm seducing her fiancé."

Disgust flickered in Gregory Wilson's eyes.

"I fled to England, but I still can't escape their harassment." Evelyn's voice was as light as a sigh.

"If you truly want to end this, there's always a way."

"What way?" Evelyn gave a hollow laugh. "I even changed my phone number. What else can I do?"

"Get married."

"..."

"A legally recognized marriage is the best protection. No matter how powerful Alexander Hamilton is, he can't override the law."

Gregory's gaze burned so intensely she had nowhere to hide.

She could only stare at the tips of her shoes, avoiding the heat in his eyes.

"You still can't let go."

"I can!"

"Then why won't you answer? This is the most effective solution."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Marriage isn't a game. I can't use someone like that."

"What if that person is willing to be used?"

"Dr. Wilson..."

In the world of adults, some things didn't need to be said outright.

From the moment he proposed marriage, she'd understood his feelings.

Ever since she saw that oil painting, every encounter with him had left her on edge.

"Evelyn, what's holding you back?"

"It's not about hesitation."

"Then what is it?"

"...What you want, I can't give."

"How do you know you can't?"

Evelyn looked up at him, struck for the first time by how forceful this gentle man could be.

Steeling herself, she said, "I don't love you."

"I know."

"How can a marriage without love last?"

"Who says marriage requires love?" Gregory chuckled. "Your marriage to Alexander had no love either. If Annabelle Taylor hadn't appeared, you'd still be together peacefully. If he could do it, why can't I?"

"It's not fair to you." Evelyn shook her head. "Alexander and I had our own arrangements, but you..."

"I love you."

Those three words hit her like a physical blow.

Neither Alexander's feigned affection nor Peter Harrison's ulterior motives had ever led to such a direct declaration.

This wasn't just a simple confession—it was a weighty, genuine heart laid bare.

The one who speaks first is destined to lose.

She didn't know how other girls would react to these words.

All she felt was her chest tightening, and she could only keep shaking her head. "No... truly, no."
###Chapter 379: Exit Stage Left, Enter Stage Right

Gregory Wilson's gaze was calm as water, resting on her face.

Evelyn Carter took a deep breath. "Let's not see each other anymore. I'll move out as soon as possible. I'll pay you market-rate rent for the remaining lease."

"Unnecessary."

"Since I rejected you, we should settle accounts properly."

"Evelyn."

"Yes?"

"Think again."

"......"

"Alexander Hamilton won't let you go easily. With your current situation, breaking free from him won't be simple."

"......"

"If you truly hit a dead end, come to me. We can try a trial marriage—set a time limit. Or wait until he gives up completely. Divorce me anytime you want. I won't cling."

Evelyn smiled bitterly. "The Evelyn from five years ago is already dead."

"I know."

"Stop holding on. I'm Alexander's ex-wife. Would your family accept that?"

"That's my problem to solve."

Gregory stood. "You could afford to be more selfish."

"......"

"Coming to the front hall?"

She shook her head.

He walked to the window, locked it firmly, and tested the frame with a firm push. "Can't be opened from outside. Remember to lock the door."

"Okay."

Gregory picked up his coat and left.

The moment he opened the door, he collided with Alexander waiting outside.

Gregory smirked. "Mr. Hamilton has taken up eavesdropping now?"

"You're marrying Evelyn?"

"Yes."

"Give up now."

Gregory raised a brow. "She's single. I'll pursue her if I want. Marry her if I want."

Alexander's gaze sharpened. "Out of respect for your brother, I've been civil. But Evelyn is off-limits."

"We'll see."

As they brushed past each other, their shoulders clashed violently—neither yielding an inch.

Only when Gregory was gone did Alexander step into the room.

Evelyn massaged her temples.

Had these two men coordinated to bombard her in shifts?

One exits, the other eagerly enters.

"Evelyn..."

She finally snapped. "Here to interrogate me again?"

###Chapter 380 None of Your Business.
The salty sea breeze swept across the deck.

Evelyn Carter stood at the cabin door, watching the drenched man on the sofa.

Alexander Hamilton's hair dripped water, his shirt clinging to his toned frame.

"Did you actually jump into the sea?" she blurted.

His eyes snapped open, burning into hers. "What, were you hoping I would?"

"I'm just curious how the mighty Mr. Hamilton ended up like this."

He smirked. "The pool on deck is quite refreshing. You should try it."

"In a suit?" She arched a brow. "Only you would do something so ridiculous."

"Better than hiding in a cabin." His gaze flicked to the drawn curtains.

Evelyn strode to the window and yanked them open.

Sunlight flooded the room.

"Hiding? I was enjoying some peace."

Alexander squinted against the sudden brightness. "Peaceful enough to skip the wedding?"

"Other people's happiness doesn't interest me."

"Really?" He sat up slowly. "Then why couldn't you stop staring at the bride?"

Her fingers tightened around the curtain.

"None of your business."

Alexander chuckled. "Dr. Carter, your symptoms are concerning."

"What symptoms?"

"Jealousy." He drawled the word. "Classic envy and resentment."

She scoffed. "Since when did you become a psychiatrist?"

"Don't need to be." He stood, water dripping onto the carpet. "We were close enough for me to read you like a book."

"You're mistaken." She turned away. "I just admired her dress."

He stepped closer. "Want one?"

"What?"

"A wedding gown." His breath brushed her ear. "I could give you something better."

Evelyn spun around, nearly colliding with his chest.

"Alexander, get a grip." She pointed to the door. "Leave."

He didn't budge. "I'm perfectly sane."

"Then you're delusional."

"Maybe." A self-deprecating smile touched his lips. "I haven't been right since I met you."

The wind rushed in, scattering the tension between them.

Evelyn tucked her hair behind her ear. "What do you want?"

His expression turned serious. "Why do you shut everyone out?"

"That's my choice."

"Even Vivian?"

"She's different."

"How?" He stepped closer. "Because she doesn't make your heart race? Doesn't hurt you?"

Her nails dug into her palms. "Why push this?"

"Because I'm tired of watching you lock yourself away."

"Well, too bad." She lifted her chin. "This is who I am."

Footsteps echoed outside.

Alexander's eyes darkened. He pulled her against him.

"What are you—"

"Quiet." His hand covered her mouth. "Someone's coming."

Evelyn froze as voices approached.

"Don't move," he murmured in her ear. "Unless you want an audience."

His soaked shirt pressed against her back, radiating heat.

Her pulse raced wildly.

The footsteps paused, then faded.

Alexander released her but didn't step back.

"Now can we talk?" His voice was rough.

She shoved him away. "There's nothing to discuss."

"Sure?" He gestured to her flushed cheeks. "Your body disagrees."

"That's a normal reaction to proximity."

His lips quirked. "Should we test that theory with someone else?"

"You—"

"Evelyn." His gaze held hers. "Admit it. You still feel something."

Waves lapped against the hull in rhythmic beats.

Meeting his stare, she laughed coldly. "Alexander, in medical terms, we call this—delusions of grandeur."
###Chapter 381: That's His Business, Why Tell Me?

"Perhaps because the right person hasn't come along yet."

"Really? Never?"

Evelyn's fingers curled slightly. "Once."

"Who?"

"I don't remember."

Alexander's gaze darkened. "Fine, keep your secrets."

"Mhm."

Linda's wedding was a grand affair.

Though there were minor hiccups, the party reportedly lasted until dawn.

These details were relayed to Evelyn three days later—by Linda herself, who showed up unannounced.

Evelyn studied the whirlwind bride, baffled by her insistence on delivering a gift in person.

"I'm pregnant," Linda admitted sheepishly, resting a hand on her belly. "The doctor says the first trimester is critical, and I just... can't handle the responsibility right now."

Evelyn eyed the fluffy white ball of fur in the carrier. "With proper checkups—"

"It's not about my family," Linda cut in. "I can barely get out of bed. How am I supposed to care for a living creature?"

"Why me?"

"Gregory said you'd be a good owner." Linda winked. "And that you could use the company."

Evelyn frowned.

"Paul's waiting," Linda said, already heading for the door. "She's fully vaccinated and housebroken."

Before Evelyn could respond, Linda vanished.

Silence settled over the apartment—save for the tiny dog blinking up at her.

Gregory had become a ghost since their late-night conversation.

Between her grueling schedule at the new hospital and the postponed apartment hunt, the puppy became her sole reason to hurry home each day.

The moment the carrier opened, the little thing bolted across the room, then flopped onto its back at Evelyn's feet, belly exposed.

She crouched to poke it. "Little simp."

"Talking about me?"

Gregory stood in the doorway, arms laden with pet supplies.

Evelyn scooped up the dog. "Her."

He crossed over to scratch behind its ears with practiced ease, as if he'd done this countless times before.

"Linda's doing?"

"Mm. Pregnancy complications."

He set the bags on the coffee table. "Brought food and toys."

Evelyn surveyed the haul, realization dawning. "You knew?"

"Educated guess." His eyes avoided hers. "A pet helps with loneliness."

The unspoken topic—her move—hung thick between them.

The puppy wriggled in her arms, its tail brushing her wrist.

"Alexander returned to the country," Gregory said abruptly. "With Annabelle."

Evelyn turned toward the balcony, settling the dog on a cushion. "That's his business. Why tell me?"
###Chapter 382: That's Her Mother, Not Yours

Gregory Wilson's fingers tapped lightly on the armrest. "He never contacted you?"

Evelyn Carter cradled the white puppy in her lap, fingers sinking into its fluffy fur. "It's been over between us for a long time."

"I thought he'd at least give you closure."

A sliver of sunlight slipped through the curtains, painting a thin golden line on the floor. Evelyn stared at it absently.

"Forget it." Gregory stood, his white coat swaying slightly. "I shouldn't have meddled."

"Dr. Wilson." Evelyn looked up. "Every time you confess your feelings, I distance myself from you."

His lips twisted into a bitter smile. "I know."

"Because I don't know how to respond. Not giving false hope might be the kindest thing."

"I understand." He walked toward the door, his posture rigid. "We'll discuss your weekend move later."

She didn't realize those words held another meaning.

The call came unexpectedly during lunch break.

"Evelyn!" Vivian Dempsey's voice crackled with excitement. "I just saw Alexander Hamilton! Right outside your parents' place!"

Evelyn's fingers dug into her palm. "What was he doing there?"

"He carried bags upstairs and stayed over an hour before leaving—with everything still packed!" Vivian gloated. "Your parents totally shut him down!"

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed slightly. "Are Mom and Dad okay?"

"Perfectly fine! Your sister even served me fruit." Vivian dropped her voice. "Oh, and guess what? That homewrecker Annabelle's mom is dying!"

Evelyn shot up, knocking over her water glass.

"What did you say?"

"That sickly woman—doctors say she won't last this time." Vivian sneered. "Like mother, like daughter. Serves them right!"

Evelyn's hands trembled. "Vivian, I have to go."

"Wait, why the—"

She hung up and immediately dialed Alexander.

After endless rings, his weary voice answered. "Evelyn?"

"What happened to Mrs. Lightfoot?" Her voice strained.

His surprise was palpable. "How did you—"

"Answer me!"

"Sudden deterioration. She's in ICU now." His tone turned grave. "They issued a critical condition notice. I'm at the hospital."

Her breathing quickened. "But she only had leg paralysis before."

"It's neurogenic paralysis. This time, her brain suffered secondary trauma." He paused. "Evelyn... why do you care so much about Mrs. Lightfoot?"

The steady beep of medical monitors filled the silence as Evelyn's nails bit into her flesh.

"Because..." Her whisper barely carried through. "She might be my mother."
###Chapter 383 Take Me to See Her

"Evelyn?"

Alexander Hamilton's deep voice came through the phone.

"......"

"Evelyn? Are you there?"

"Mhm."

"Why aren't you saying anything?"

"It's nothing."

"Mrs. Taylor's condition has worsened. The doctors say it might only be a matter of days. I'll come back to be with you once I've handled things here."

"Don't."

After hanging up, Evelyn immediately submitted a leave request to the hospital. The evening flight was fully booked, so she bought the earliest available ticket to Hudson City.

It was already late at night when she landed.

The taxi stopped in front of the hospital. Evelyn hurried into the lobby. The nurse at the reception desk widened her eyes in surprise. "Dr. Carter? You're back?"

"Please check Teresa Taylor's room number for me."

"Bed 63 on the 13th floor..."

The elevator doors opened on the 13th floor. The hallway was empty. Bed 63 was just an unoccupied hospital bed.

"Evelyn?"

Alexander appeared from around the corner, his brows furrowed. "What are you doing here?"

"Where is she?"

"Who?"

"Teresa Taylor."

"In the ICU."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the strap of her bag.

Alexander took off his suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "You look pale."

She didn’t respond.

He gently pulled her into his arms. "Let’s get you home to rest first. I’ll have the driver take you."

As soon as he reached for his phone, Evelyn stopped him.

"Take me to see her."

"Mrs. Taylor?"

"Now."

Alexander studied her red-rimmed eyes and finally nodded. "Alright."

His jacket carried a faint sandalwood scent, warm and enveloping. With one arm around her shoulders and the other protectively at her back, they walked toward the ICU.

"The medical records are here—" Margaret Hamilton turned and gasped. "Evelyn?!"

"Aunt Margaret."

"You've lost so much weight!" Margaret cupped Evelyn’s face worriedly before turning to scold Alexander. "Why did you call Evelyn back? She’s so busy with work..."

Alexander silently endured his mother’s reprimand, only adjusting the jacket more securely around Evelyn.

The commotion caught the attention of Anthony Taylor, who had been keeping vigil outside the ICU. He staggered forward, tears streaming down his face. "Terry..."

Annabelle rushed to steady her swaying father. "Dad!"

Margaret also stepped in to help. "Anthony, be careful."

But Anthony seemed not to hear. His trembling hand reached for Evelyn. "Terry... she’s been asking for you..."

Alexander immediately shielded Evelyn. "Uncle Anthony, you’ve mistaken her for someone else."

"No mistake..." Anthony collapsed to his knees, sobbing uncontrollably. "Please... just go see her..."

Annabelle trembled with fury. "Dad! I’m your daughter!"
###Chapter 384 I Won't Let You Be Anyone's Substitute Again

"Mr. Taylor, you must be exhausted. Annabelle has been right here all along."

Margaret Hamilton discreetly tugged at Alexander Hamilton's sleeve. "Take Evelyn away first. Your uncle isn't himself today."

Alexander understood, wrapping an arm around Evelyn Carter's shoulders.

"I'll go with you," Evelyn suddenly spoke up.

Anthony Taylor's eyes were bloodshot, his voice choked with emotion. "Good girl...thank you..."

Evelyn gently shrugged off Alexander's hand.

"Uncle Taylor has mistaken you for someone else," Alexander frowned. "Please calm down first."

"I'm more clear-headed than ever!" Anthony pointed at Evelyn excitedly. "She's Terry!"

Annabelle Taylor lunged forward to grab her father's arm. "Dad! Look carefully—I'm your daughter!"

"Get away!" Anthony shoved her aside and seized Evelyn's wrist. "Come with me, child."

Alexander immediately clamped down on Anthony's hand. "Uncle Taylor!"

"Let him take me," Evelyn said.

Pain flashed in Alexander's eyes. "Evelyn, I can't let you endure this humiliation again."

Tears streamed down Annabelle's face. "Why would a living person need a substitute?"

"Alexander," Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "Let me go."

Alexander's hand trembled slightly.

Seizing the opportunity, Anthony pulled Evelyn toward the ICU.

"Dad!"

"Mr. Taylor!"

Anthony ignored them, dragging Evelyn down the corridor at a near-run.

At the ICU doors, Evelyn suddenly stopped.

"What's wrong?" Anthony was frantic with impatience.

"Protective gear," Evelyn said calmly. "We need sterile suits to enter the ICU."

A nurse emerged just then. "Dr. Carter?"

"Please prepare two sets of isolation gowns."

The nurse hesitated. "Regulations state only immediate family—"

"She's my mother," Evelyn said softly.

The nurse's eyes widened in shock.

Tears streamed down Anthony's weathered face. "Please hurry...my wife can't wait much longer..."

Seeing the resolve in Evelyn's eyes, the nurse finally nodded.

After sterilization, they entered the ICU.

Teresa Taylor on the hospital bed was skeletal, only the steady beeping of monitors proving she still lived.

Anthony collapsed at her bedside, clutching his wife's frail hand. "Darling...our daughter has come to see you..."

The room was silent except for the hum of machines.
###Chapter 385 I Won't Leave

Teresa Taylor lay motionless on the hospital bed, her face as pale as parchment.

Anthony Taylor trembled as he placed Evelyn Carter's hand over Teresa's. "Terry, your mother can feel you. She definitely can—"

Before he could finish, the frail fingers twitched slightly.

"She moved!" Anthony's voice shook with excitement. "Terry, your mother really sensed your presence!"

Evelyn gazed at the woman on the bed, her emotions in turmoil.

She had never imagined having another mother.

Grace Anderson and Andrew Anderson had given her unconditional love, never making her feel different. During her divorce, her father emptied his savings, and her mother sold their house to support her—a debt she could never repay.

What would acknowledging her biological parents do to the couple who raised her?

And more importantly...

Anthony and Teresa had already poured all their love into Annabelle Taylor. That woman who threatened Alexander Hamilton with her life. That "sister" she could never accept.

"Terry! Your mother's waking up!"

Evelyn snapped back to reality.

Teresa was gripping her hand with surprising strength. Her clouded eyes brimmed with terror, as though Evelyn would vanish if she let go.

"I'll get the doctor!" Anthony stumbled toward the door.

Medical staff arrived quickly.

"Dr. Carter, we need to examine the patient," a nurse gently reminded her.

Evelyn nodded and tried to withdraw her hand, but Teresa tightened her grasp, emitting a hoarse whimper.

She leaned down and embraced this unfamiliar mother. "I won't leave. I'll wait right outside."

Teresa still refused to release her.

"Really, I'm not going anywhere," Evelyn repeated softly but firmly.

The skeletal fingers finally loosened their grip.

Outside the ICU, Anthony paced anxiously. "What did the doctors say? Is your mother improving?"

"Let's wait for the test results." Evelyn steadied his trembling arm. "Sit down and rest first."

As she turned, she froze.

Alexander stood at the far end of the corridor, Margaret Hamilton beside him with a complicated expression. Annabelle was charging toward them, shoving Evelyn's hand away from Anthony's arm.

"Dad! I'm your daughter!" Annabelle's voice was shrill.

Anthony closed his eyes wearily. "Annabelle, I told you, your mother and I once—"

"No!" Annabelle's face drained of color as she staggered back.

Alexander's pupils constricted sharply. "Uncle Anthony, don't tell me..."
###Chapter 386: Lies Will Eventually Shatter

Alexander Hamilton's gaze pierced Evelyn Carter like a blade.

His pupils first contracted violently, then clouded with deep confusion, before finally hardening into something bordering on obsession.

"Annabelle was adopted? Since when?!"

Anthony Taylor sighed heavily. "Little Terry was only four when she went missing. Your Aunt Olivia was consumed by guilt, crying herself sick every day. After reporting it to the police, she camped by the phone for six months..."

His eyes drifted to Evelyn.

She stood motionless, lips pressed tight, fingertips trembling slightly.

"The police finally said... a child that young, alone for so long... the chances were slim." Anthony's voice cracked. "The way you look right now—it's exactly how your mother was back then. She'd sit like a statue, lunging for the phone at every ring..."

Alexander's knuckles turned white. "You never mentioned losing a daughter."

"Your mother knew." Anthony smiled bitterly. "After adopting Annabelle, we asked everyone to treat her as our own. We wanted... to make up for what we'd lost."

Alexander whirled toward Margaret Hamilton. "Mom, you knew all along?"

Margaret nodded faintly.

"Why didn't you tell me?!"

"You were just a child. And children talk—what if Annabelle had overheard—"

"If I'd known she wasn't—" Alexander's voice rose sharply.

"Alexander!" Annabelle clutched his sleeve, eyes brimming with tears.

He shook her off violently. "How old were you when they adopted you?"

"I..."

"Answer me!"

Anthony intervened. "We wanted a child Terry's age, but after searching every orphanage in Hudson... only Annabelle was available. She was seven when she came to us."

Seven.

Old enough to remember everything.

Annabelle's face drained of color.

Alexander's expression morphed from shock to fury.

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"Alexander, I just..."

"When I talked about us meeting as kids, why didn't you correct me?!"

Tears spilled down Annabelle's cheeks.

"Annabelle." Alexander spoke with lethal precision. "I despise liars above all else."
###Chapter 387: Laughing at Myself

Margaret Hamilton sensed the tension in the air.

"Alexander, what's going on?"

Alexander Hamilton let out a bitter laugh.

"I asked you a question. What's so funny?"

He averted his gaze, closing his eyes in pain. "I'm laughing at myself."

Anthony Taylor looked bewildered. "Alexander, why are you reacting like this?"

Alexander remained silent, his brow furrowed.

Margaret spoke softly, "Anthony, let the young people handle their own affairs. Let's go check on Teresa."

Just then, the ICU doors opened.

"Dr. Carter—"

The hallway outside the ward was thick with unspoken emotions.

But Evelyn Carter remained eerily composed.

"How is the patient?"

"Her vitals have improved, but she's still too weak. She needs continued observation in the ICU. The patient is emotionally unstable—it would help if a family member could stay by the window to comfort her."

Anthony immediately volunteered, "I'll stay the night!"

"I'll do it," Evelyn cut in. "You need rest."

Anthony hesitated. "Evelyn..."

"Alexander."

"I'm here."

"Please take my father home."

Alexander's gaze softened. "I'll have Emily take him. I'll stay with you."

"That won't be necessary. Just see him home."

"Understood. I'll handle it."

"Margaret, thank you for visiting my mother. You should rest too."

Margaret looked at her with concern. "You can't do this alone. Someone should relieve you."

Evelyn shook her head. "I can't leave."

Everyone understood.

Teresa Taylor's heartache was Evelyn.

She was terrified of losing her daughter again.

Margaret suggested, "Let Alexander stay and help."

Evelyn knew what she was implying.

Her instinct was to refuse—to call Vivian instead.

But remembering Vivian's grandmother was also hospitalized, she let it go.

"What about me?" Annabelle Taylor suddenly spoke up. "I want to take care of Mom too."

Evelyn shot her a cold glance. "I don't want to see you."

Annabelle paled. "I'm their daughter too!"

"Take care of her?" Evelyn scoffed. "When you threatened suicide to force Mom to manipulate Alexander, where was your filial piety then?"

"I never forced her!"

"You knew she couldn't bear losing another daughter, yet you kept trying to kill yourself. What else would you call that?"
###Chapter 388: The Self-inflicted Wound

Anthony Taylor watched his two daughters locked in bitter confrontation, his heart wrenching with pain.

"Evelyn, what's done is done. Annabelle has truly repented these past days. Can't you give her a chance to make amends?"

Evelyn Carter turned her face away coldly. "I wasn't pursuing this. She's the one who insisted on provoking me."

"This child... It's our fault for spoiling her too much."

"If you recognize it as spoiling, then let her face the consequences. Don't expect anyone else to clean up her mess—not you, and certainly not Alexander."

Anthony sighed and nodded. "You're right."

"This is the ICU. It requires silence. You should leave now and not disrupt the medical staff."

As Anthony hesitated, Alexander Hamilton gently took his arm. "Uncle Anthony, let me escort you and my mother home."

Anthony's worried gaze lingered on Evelyn's slender frame by the glass window. "But she's alone..."

"Emily will arrive shortly to take you and Mother home. I'll stay with Evelyn."

Margaret Hamilton added softly, "Anthony, you must take care of yourself. When Mrs. Lin wakes up, your family will need you."

Anthony's eyes reddened. "I failed to protect my daughter... and to care for my wife..."

"Let's go," Alexander said, supporting him as they walked out.

Margaret followed closely behind.

Annabelle Taylor stood abandoned, then hurried after them. "Aunt Margaret, let me help you."

Margaret avoided her touch. "That won't be necessary."

"But it's dark and slippery—"

"My vision is just fine," Margaret replied without looking back.

Annabelle's voice trembled. "Aunt Margaret..."

"Yes?" Margaret continued walking.

"Do you... hate me now?"

Margaret's lips curved slightly. "Why would I? Alexander—"

She quickened her pace to support Anthony's other arm.

"Slow down. I can't keep up."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Understood."

"I know you're worried about Evelyn and want to return quickly. But your uncle just injured his knee. Be mindful of him."

Alexander adjusted his pace. "Of course."

At the hospital entrance, Emily Zade arrived promptly.

"Mr. Hamilton."

"Please see the elders home safely. Thank you."

"Should I take Mr. Taylor back to the rehabilitation center?"

"The family estate for now. The center is too far."

"Understood. And Miss Taylor...?"

Alexander remained silent.

Annabelle interjected urgently, "I want to stay at Alexander's apartment! The one we were supposed to live in after the wedding!"

Alexander's gaze turned icy.

Margaret settled the matter decisively. "Everyone is returning to the estate."
###Chapter 389: The Stand-in Enigma

The hospital corridor stood empty and silent in the dead of night.

Evelyn Carter walked steadily toward the OB-GYN Department under the stark fluorescent lights. The click of her heels echoed through the hallway.

"Ma'am, there are no doctors on duty right now," a resident said, adjusting his glasses as he eyed her warily.

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "I'm just here to pick something up."

"You'll need to register—"

"Dr. Carter!" A familiar head nurse hurried over. "What brings you back?"

"Last-minute business." Evelyn's gaze swept over the nursing station. "Is Olivia's folding bed still here?"

"It's in storage. Let me get it for you."

The metal frame clinked softly as Evelyn took the folded bed. She turned toward the elevators without noticing the nurse's hesitant expression.

The ICU hallway was even quieter than OB-GYN.

Alexander Hamilton stood rigid by the glass window. At the sound of footsteps, he whirled around and strode over to take the bed from her hands.

"Are you staying overnight?"

"Yes." She pointed to the window. "Put it there."

Alexander unfolded the bed with practiced efficiency, testing it first himself. The metal groaned under his weight.

"I'll get a blanket from the nurses."

"Don't bother." Evelyn was already sitting, her eyes fixed on the pale woman in the hospital bed beyond the glass.

Alexander stood beside her, his throat working silently.

"The specialists arrive tomorrow."

Evelyn chuckled dryly. "Since when did you become a doctor?"

"I just... don't want to see you hurting."

"I'm fine." Her voice was terrifyingly calm. "Maybe I'm just cold-blooded by nature."

"You're not." Suddenly, he crouched to meet her gaze. "If it were your adoptive mother in there, you wouldn't be like this."

Her lashes fluttered.

"I remember nothing before age four," she said abruptly. "Mom said I nearly drowned. When I woke up, all my memories were gone."

Alexander's fingers absently traced the edge of the folding bed.

"Sit." Evelyn shifted aside.

The bed creaked ominously as Alexander sat. The surface sagged, sending them both sliding toward the center.

"Sorry." He started to rise.

"Stay." Her hand pressed his arm. "It's going to be a long night."

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn laughed suddenly. "How ironic. Annabelle and I—we were each other's stand-ins."

"That's not true!" Alexander turned sharply. "I never knew about your disappearance!"

His voice rang too loud in the empty corridor.

Evelyn studied their reflections in the glass. "Then what did you know?"

Alexander's breathing grew labored. His lips parted, but no sound came out.

From inside the room, the steady beep of monitors marked time like a countdown.
###Chapter 390: I Understand You Enough

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly before smoothing out again.

"Whether you know or not doesn't matter anymore. You loved Annabelle for so many years—it couldn't have been just because of some childhood betrothal arranged by your parents, right?"

Alexander countered, "Do you think I'm that kind of person?"

"Can I ask you something first?"

"Go ahead."

"Annabelle and I are complete opposites in both looks and personality. You loved her for decades—how did that suddenly change?"

The corner of Alexander's lips lifted. "Feelings don't follow logic."

"Was it because you couldn't accept losing, or because of the baby?"

"Neither." Alexander asked again, "You really can't remember anything before you went missing?"

"Occasional fragments, but even those have become rare these past few years."

Alexander nodded. "Then don't force it. Living in the present is more important."

"Don't be so gentle with me. I wasn't close to my birth mother. I may worry, but I don't need comforting."

Alexander hummed in acknowledgment. "You rushed back overnight without resting. Get some sleep. I'll wake you when Aunt Lin comes to."

"What time is it?"

He raised his wrist to show her his watch.

"So late already."

"Sleep."

"What about you? Planning to keep vigil all night?"

"Mhm."

"Don't. I don't want to owe you favors. You should leave."

Her phone suddenly rang—Vivian calling.

"Viv?"

"It's me! Am I interrupting work?"

"...No, go ahead."

"My grandma's out of danger! I'm flying to England right now to be with you—heading to the airport now—"

"Don't come."

"Why? That bastard Alexander isn't even there! I need to protect you!"

"I'm back in the country too."

"Since when? I'm already at—"

The phone was plucked from her hand. Alexander spoke calmly, "She's safe with me. Focus on your grandmother."

A torrent of curses immediately erupted from the other end.

Alexander, prepared, held the phone away and waited patiently for five minutes.

"Done? Evelyn needs rest. Call tomorrow."

He decisively ended the call.

Evelyn reached for the phone. "Give it back!"

"That phone was a gift from me."

"I'll transfer the money."

He evaded her grasp. "You can have it back after you get proper sleep."

She stared at him intently. "Alexander."

"Yes?"

"I understand you less and less these days."

He chuckled softly. "No rush. Take your time. Even if you never understand—"

"It's enough that I do."
###Chapter 391: The Twins

Alexander Hamilton tucked his phone into his inner suit pocket.

Evelyn Carter wanted to take it back, but she couldn’t exactly strip his clothes off in public. Besides, with his reflexes, she stood no chance against him.

The sterile scent of disinfectant mingled with a hint of citrus, lulling her into a deep sleep.

In her drowsy haze, she thought she heard him murmuring something.

She strained to listen, but exhaustion pulled her under before she could make out the words.

"Dr. Carter?"

She opened her eyes to find several faces hovering over her.

Olivia Lightfoot blinked her round eyes excitedly. "You're really back!"

Two unfamiliar children peeked out shyly from behind Olivia.

"Who are...?"

"You forgot?" Olivia grinned, her eyes crinkling into crescents. "These are the twins you delivered!"

Clang—

Alexander's thermos hit the floor.

Olivia frowned. "What are you doing here?"

His face went pale as he scrambled to pick it up. "I'll... get a cleaner."

As he turned, he bumped into a passing visitor and stammered apologies.

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Wasn't he supposed to be all cool and composed? Why's he acting like an idiot now?"

Natalie Stapleton mused, "He probably... misunderstood."

"Misunderstood what?" Olivia's eyes widened. "Don't tell me he thought you and Dr. Carter—"

"Weren't you taking the kids to pediatrics?" Natalie smoothly interrupted.

"Oh! Right!" Olivia grabbed the children's hands. "Dr. Carter, I'll be right back!"

The room fell quiet.

"Evelyn," Natalie asked softly, "who was that man earlier?"

"Distant relative." Evelyn changed the subject. "How did you find me here?"

"Mr. Hamilton contacted me this morning and asked me to bring breakfast."

Evelyn froze.

"You were still asleep when I arrived," Natalie continued. "His whole side had gone numb, but he refused to move until I got here. Only then did he carefully lay you down and say he was going for hot water."

It was a habit Evelyn had maintained for years.

"About what Olivia said earlier..." Natalie hesitated.

Evelyn finally understood.

The phrase "the twins you delivered" could easily be misconstrued.

"Let him think what he wants." Evelyn lowered her lashes. "Four years ago, I'd just started my residency. There was no time for pregnancy or childbirth."

"The fact that he reacted like that means children matter to him," Natalie said meaningfully.

A sharp pang pierced Evelyn's chest.

She forced composure. "Why are you defending him so much today?"
###Chapter 392: You're Her Miracle Cure

Natalie Stapleton looked unusually vibrant today.

The checkered cotton dress complemented her rosy complexion. Her hair cascaded softly over her shoulders, radiating vitality.

Evelyn Carter observed her with quiet satisfaction.

"Mr. Hamilton truly cares for you," Natalie suddenly murmured, her voice feather-light. "His eyes follow only you whenever you're together."

Evelyn's fingers tightened imperceptibly.

"I know I shouldn't say this, but I can't help feeling envious." Natalie gave a bitter smile. "No one has ever cherished me like that."

"You just haven't met the right person yet."

"Perhaps." Natalie shrugged. "Right now, I just want to focus on being with Dad. Romance can wait."

A faint tapping sound came from the window.

Both women turned to see Teresa Taylor smiling weakly at them, color finally returning to her pale face.

"Aunt Teresa's awake!" Natalie gasped in delight.

Alexander Hamilton appeared silently behind them, holding a glass of warm water. "Drink this."

Evelyn accepted the cup, the soothing liquid easing her parched throat.

As she moved to discard the paper cup, her numb legs betrayed her. Alexander steadied her instantly. "Don't move."

Natalie rushed to assist. "You're exhausted, Evelyn."

"I'm fine," Evelyn said, flustered.

Alexander plucked the empty cup from her hands. "I'll dispose of it."

Natalie checked her watch. "I need to bring Dad his breakfast." She nodded at Alexander. "About the industrial park—"

"I remember," he interrupted. "I'll visit Mr. Stapleton personally soon."

A monitor's alarm suddenly blared in the room.

Doctors and nurses streamed in, efficiently checking the readings.

"Vitals are stabilizing," Evelyn observed, her tense shoulders finally relaxing as she watched the screen.

Alexander exhaled deeply. "Only you can make her recover like this."

"It's temporary."

"Are you still leaving?" he asked abruptly. "You only left to avoid me before, but now—"

His words trailed off as his gaze caught Evelyn's trembling fingertips.

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting long shadows across the three figures.
###Chapter 393: I'm the Lucky One

Evelyn couldn't help but roll her eyes.

This man was like a persistent ghost.

She had barely arrived in England when she "coincidentally" ran into him again.

"That day at the pharmacy," she narrowed her eyes, "was it really a coincidence?"

Alexander spread his hands. "I'm not psychic."

Fair enough.

"Maybe this is..." He paused. "Fate?"

"England is the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution. They believe in science."

"But they also believe in God."

"Does the Chinese matchmaker have jurisdiction overseas?"

Alexander chuckled. "Perhaps even matchmakers keep up with the times. Globalization and all."

Just then, the ICU door opened.

"Dr. Carter."

Evelyn hurried forward. "Dr. Zhang, how's my mother?"

Dr. Zhang removed his mask with a relaxed smile. "All her vitals are stable. She can be transferred to a regular room this afternoon."

"Thank goodness. Thank you."

"Don't mention it." Dr. Zhang glanced at Alexander and teased, "Though your husband here deserves some credit. He was your human pillow all night. My back ached just watching."

Evelyn's smile froze.

Alexander smoothly interjected, "Spouses should support each other. When my grandmother was hospitalized, Evelyn took excellent care of her too."

Dr. Zhang sighed. "Dr. Carter, you're truly blessed."

"No," Alexander's gaze softened, "I'm the lucky one to have married her."

"Goodness, how sweet." Dr. Zhang waved a hand, laughing. "I'll get back to work."

Once the doctor was out of earshot, Alexander mused, "Why does it seem like everyone here knows me?"

Evelyn shot him a glare. This man used to park his luxury SUV outside the hospital daily to pick her up. Of course he stood out.

That reminded her of something.

"With your credentials, how did Annabelle ever overlook you?"

Alexander raised a brow. "Remember Paul?"

"Linda's new husband?"

"He was also Annabelle's 'close friend.'"

Evelyn let out a knowing "Ah."

"Whatever their relationship was," Alexander shrugged, "she never admitted to anything."

"Did Paul's divorce involve her?"

"Not sure."

Evelyn scoffed. "Weren't you supposedly in love with her? Couldn't even handle the men around her?"

Alexander sighed. "You think I didn't try?"

"Failed?"

"Like a math problem where the tank never fills," he rubbed his temples, "because someone keeps draining it."

Evelyn's eyes widened in realization. "She added new 'friends' faster than you could remove the old ones?"

"She thrived on being the center of attention."

"So you just accepted it? Became a backup option?"

"Back then, I was just another 'close friend,'" Alexander said bitterly. "What right did I have to interfere?"

Evelyn nodded. "Got it. You never even made it to the shortlist."

Suddenly, Alexander pulled her phone from his inner pocket. "Gregory called you multiple times."

"Give it here. I'll call him back."

"No need." He slipped the phone back into his jacket. "I already answered."
###Chapter 394: Not Even Ordinary Friends

Evelyn Carter gazed silently at Alexander Hamilton, waiting for him to continue.

He deliberately avoided the subject. "Let's visit Aunt Teresa first. What paperwork is needed for the room transfer? I'll handle it."

She took a deep breath, her eyes still fixed on him.

"What's wrong?" He tilted his head slightly.

Evelyn finally gave up pressing him. "The nurses will handle the paperwork."

"Alright." He bent to fold the cot. "Does this need returning to the OB-GYN Department?"

"Yes."

Carrying the folded cot effortlessly with one hand, he strode toward the elevator. His ease contrasted sharply with how she'd struggled to drag it earlier.

The ICU buzzed with activity.

Nurses were removing monitoring equipment from Teresa Taylor. As they wheeled her out, Teresa suddenly grabbed Evelyn's hand, lips trembling but unable to speak, tears streaming down her face.

"Aunt Teresa, let go. We're moving to your room now," Evelyn said gently.

Teresa only tightened her grip, eyes pleading.

"I'll go with you," Evelyn relented.

The VIP Ward was spacious and bright—clearly Alexander's doing. Evelyn tried to withdraw her hand. "Let me get a chair."

Teresa immediately clutched her again, panic flashing across her face.

"Dr. Carter, the handover is complete," a nurse informed her. "Xiao Wang will handle her care from now on."

"Thank you."

Once alone, silence settled over the room.

Evelyn looked at the woman in the bed. "I've been the Andersons' daughter for over twenty years. I can't change how I address you overnight."

Teresa shook her head desperately, tears falling faster.

"I know what happened back then wasn't your fault. I've had a good life." Evelyn kept her tone even. "But you raised Annabelle for nearly thirty years. That bond runs deep. To her, we can never be sisters."

She paused.

"We can't even be ordinary friends."
###Chapter 395: What Would I Do With Your Life?

Teresa's eyes dimmed momentarily before lighting up with understanding. She gave a gentle nod.

"Focus on recovering first. We can discuss other matters later."

She opened her mouth, but only a hoarse whisper escaped.

"I know what you want to ask." Evelyn clasped her hand tightly. "The job opportunity in England is rare, but I need time to consider."

A soft knock sounded at the door.

Alexander stood outside, his gaze meeting Evelyn's through the glass window.

"Come in."

He pushed the door open, holding a folded receipt for the cot. "The bed's been returned."

"Mm."

"Why aren't you sitting?" His eyes dropped to Teresa's hand holding Evelyn's, and he immediately understood. He pulled up a visitor's chair beside Evelyn.

After she sat, Evelyn gestured toward the hallway. "Go get another chair."

"No need."

"You didn't rest well last night either."

The corner of Alexander's lips quirked up. "Who'd dare make you take responsibility?"

Evelyn nearly blurted out Annabelle's name.

But the Annabelle of today was no longer the same person.

"Margaret would be heartbroken."

"She'd rejoice at me working hard for you." Alexander leaned against the wall. "As long as you're not asking for my life."

"What would I do with your life?"

"Then let me keep it." He shrugged. "At least I can still run errands for Aunt Teresa."

Evelyn turned her face away without responding.

"Is Aunt Teresa feeling better?"

"She still can't speak."

Alexander nodded. "This entire ward floor has been cleared. No disturbances."

Teresa reached out gratefully.

Alexander immediately took her hand.

In the next moment, Teresa placed his hand over Evelyn's.

Reacting swiftly, Alexander interlaced his fingers with Evelyn's. "I understand."

Evelyn yanked her hand back and stood abruptly. "I need to call her husband."

That term still stuck in her throat.

"No need." Alexander stopped her. "I've already notified him."
###Chapter 396: Revisiting the Past

"When will he arrive?"

"He's already on his way. Knowing you pulled an all-nighter, he insisted on relieving you."

Evelyn gave a slight nod, her fingers absently tracing the railing of the hospital bed.

Alexander checked his watch. "Mr. Taylor should be here soon."

As if on cue, Anthony Taylor pushed the door open.

Morning dew still clung to his suit jacket, evidence of his haste. Seeing his wife awake, his eyes instantly welled up. "You—how could you take such a risk? The child needs time to process everything. You nearly scared me to death..."

Teresa's freshly dried eyes grew moist again, though a relieved smile touched her lips.

Anthony set two thermal containers on the bedside table, retrieving one and handing it to Evelyn. "Last time we ate together, I noticed you liked tofu. So I made mapo tofu, crab roe tofu, and some stir-fried seasonal greens..."

Teresa's gaze remained fixed on her daughter.

"Let me." Alexander took the container. "I'll hold it for her."

When Evelyn stayed silent, Anthony could only offer Alexander a strained smile. "There's enough for both of you."

"Thank you, Mr. Taylor."

"Alexander, you two should go rest. And let your mother know not to worry."

Alexander nodded, gently grasping Evelyn's wrist. "We'll head out now."

Their footsteps echoed down the hallway.

Only after settling into the car did Evelyn speak. "Where to?"

"Home."

"Which home?"

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly. "Where do you want to go?"

"...I don't know."

"If you're worried about your adoptive parents, we can wait." He started the engine. "Face them when you're ready."

Evelyn leaned back against the seat, her lashes fluttering. "But where else is there for me in Hudson City?"

"What about the old house? My mother would be thrilled to see you."

"Annabelle might disagree."

Alexander abruptly turned the wheel.

The car arced sharply, speeding north.

"Where are we going?" Evelyn opened her eyes.

"Cloud Terrace Resort."

Evelyn let out a cold laugh. "What, planning to relive old memories?"
###Chapter 397: Clear Stances

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed as he spoke in a low voice, "Not the same room as last time."

"..."

"The mountain air is fresh. Evelyn, you need rest now."

Evelyn silently turned her gaze to the window.

Thirty minutes later, the black sedan pulled up in front of the resort hotel halfway up the mountain.

Unlike six months ago, several construction sites now dotted the surroundings.

Alexander stepped out with a thermal container, following her line of sight. "We're expanding the resort. That area will be a children's playground, and over there is planned as a wellness center."

Evelyn withdrew her gaze and walked straight into the lobby.

The Hamiltons' business plans had nothing to do with her.

Yet the word "children" pricked her heart like a needle.

The crisp-uniformed receptionist brightened at the sight of her. "You're—"

Alexander strode over. "Two servings of century egg and pork congee. Quickly."

"Yes, Mr. Hamilton!" The girl immediately dialed the internal line.

As the elevator doors closed, Evelyn noticed her name tag. "Her uniform..."

"Promoted her to manager."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

The very employee Annabelle had wanted fired was now promoted.

"Deliberately opposing Annabelle?"

"Just showing you where I stand."

"Since when does the Hamilton Group practice nepotism? Is she qualified to manage an entire hotel?"

"Unhappy?" Alexander pressed the penthouse button. "I can replace her right now."

"That's not what I meant." Evelyn frowned. "You're becoming too emotional."

Alexander gave a bitter smile. "When logic fails, might as well follow your heart."

Ding—

The elevator reached the top floor.

Alexander stepped out briskly. Evelyn reminded him, "The key card."

"The penthouse is now a private residence." He stopped at the end hallway, unlocking it with his fingerprint. "Come see."

Pushing the door open, Evelyn froze.

This was unmistakably...

A perfect replica of their newlywed apartment.

"Everything you left behind that could be salvaged is here." Alexander gestured to the wardrobe. "The clothes were repurchased in the same styles. Only that 'Clinical Medicine Atlas' is out of print."

Evelyn's fingertips traced the bookshelf.

The secondhand shelf she'd bought for ten dollars during grad school still bore the dings from their move.

Now every grain of wood gleamed from meticulous polishing.
###Chapter 398: You Might as Well Slap Me

"This suite is occasionally used by me, but it's professionally cleaned daily." Alexander Hamilton pushed open the door and gestured for her to enter first. "The bedding will be replaced shortly. You can stay here without worry."

Evelyn Carter remained at the threshold. "And you?"

"Next door." He pointed to the door at the end of the hallway.

She gave a slight nod.

"There are only these two suites on the top floor. The soundproofing is excellent." His voice softened. "You won’t be disturbed, no matter what you do."

"The cost—"

"Evelyn," he interrupted, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Mentioning money feels like a slap to my face."

The air froze for several seconds.

"If you need anything, call the front desk—or me directly." He turned to leave. "I won’t intrude."

The moment the door closed, Evelyn finally exhaled in relief.

The penthouse suite was so quiet she could hear her own heartbeat.

As she plugged in her phone charger, the screen lit up repeatedly.

Dozens of missed calls.

All from the UK.

Her message inbox was flooded by one person.

[Gregory Wilson: I heard you suddenly returned to the country. Is everything alright?]

[Gregory Wilson: Have you landed? Call me when you see this.]

[Gregory Wilson: The little one refuses to eat. He’s been waiting by the door for you.]

Attached was a photo of a small white dog curled up on the doormat, its dark eyes staring into the camera.

[Gregory Wilson: If my confession made you uncomfortable, I apologize. We can go back to how things were.]

[Gregory Wilson: It’s the weekend. You mentioned wanting to move out. I’ve looked at a few apartments—all in good locations.]

[Gregory Wilson: Am I bothering you?]

[Gregory Wilson: Reach out when you’re ready.]

[Gregory Wilson: Don’t forget, someone here is waiting for you.]

Her phone slipped from her hand.

Evelyn collapsed onto the bed, pressing an arm over her burning eyes.

The doorbell suddenly rang.

"Madam, your porridge." A staff member wheeled in a cart. "Mr. Hamilton specifically requested extra ginger."

She mechanically stepped aside.

"Fresh bedding will be brought shortly." The attendant efficiently arranged the tableware. "Please enjoy your meal."

By the time the door closed again, the steam over the porridge had already dissipated.

"May I come in?" Alexander’s voice came from the doorway.

Evelyn looked up to see him standing at the half-open door.

"What is it?"

"You left the door unlocked." His gaze swept over the meal cart before landing on her phone beside the bed.

The screen was still lit.

Gregory’s messages were clearly visible.
###Chapter 399: With or Without You

Alexander Hamilton's gaze lingered briefly on Evelyn Carter's phone screen before he casually looked away.

He walked to the window and pulled the glass pane shut.

"The mountain breeze is chilly at night."

Evelyn's phone rang abruptly.

Alexander turned to her, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly. "Should I step out?"

Evelyn glanced at the caller ID and shook her head. "No need."

She answered the call and put it on speaker.

"Dr. Carter..."

Annabelle Taylor's voice came through the line, and Alexander's brow immediately furrowed.

"What do you want?" Evelyn's tone was icy.

Annabelle hesitated. "I heard you took care of Mom all night... You must be exhausted."

"..."

"Dr. Carter?"

"Get to the point."

Annabelle choked back a nervous laugh. "Fine, I'll be direct."

"Speak."

"Now that Mom and Dad have acknowledged you, are you planning to move back into the Taylor family home?"

Evelyn scoffed. "What are you really trying to say?"

"The Taylor family can be yours. Alexander can be mine. We both get what we want. How about it?"

"Not interested."

Annabelle's voice sharpened. "You want to have your cake and eat it too?"

"The Taylor family's assets were always rightfully mine. What gives you the right to bargain with me?"

"Mom and Dad loved me for over twenty years! They won't leave me with nothing!"

Evelyn laughed derisively. "You think I'm the one competing with you?"

Annabelle took a deep breath. "You're just a doctor. What do you know about running a company? Their life's work would crumble in your hands."

"And you, a law graduate, are suddenly an expert?"

"...Alexander has been managing the company all these years. And I'm his fiancée now."

"If he can help you, why can't he help me?"

Annabelle snapped, "Didn't you swear to cut ties with him?"

Evelyn fell silent for a beat.

"True."

Annabelle pressed her advantage. "Let Alexander handle the company. You keep all the profits. You can still pursue your medical dreams in England. Everyone wins."

"I'll take care of the Taylor family's company."

Alexander's cold voice cut in. He had moved behind Evelyn without either woman noticing.

"Alexander?!" Annabelle gasped.

He took the phone from Evelyn. "Stop harassing Evelyn. I only promised your parents I wouldn't let you kill yourself. As for the rest..."

He left the threat hanging in the air.

The line went quiet for a long moment.

"After twenty years of friendship, this is how you treat me?"

"Friendship?" Alexander's laugh was bitter. "The friendship where you pretended to be Evelyn from childhood and strung me along as your backup plan for decades?"
###Chapter 400: Someone Irrelevant

The air in the room seemed to freeze.

Alexander Hamilton's slender fingers swiped across the screen, decisively ending the call before dragging the number into his blacklist.

"Someone irrelevant." His voice was feather-light as he handed the phone back to her. "Don't bother with them in the future."

Evelyn Carter studied his cold profile. "You're ruthless."

"I despise deceit the most." A shadow flickered in his eyes.

...

Alexander left soon after.

Evelyn mechanically swallowed a few bites of food before sinking into dreamless darkness.

When she opened her eyes again, the heavy night outside the window disoriented her. Her phone screen showed 3:17 AM.

The mountain night was nothing like the city.

No neon intrusion, no roar of traffic—just pure darkness and silence. She pushed open the floor-to-ceiling window, and the damp night wind carried a fine mist of rain against her face.

Amid the earthy scent of soil and greenery lingered a faint trace of tobacco.

"...I've revised the proposal. Send it to all departments by nine tomorrow."

"...Postpone the meeting to one in the morning."

"...Oh, and pick out a laptop suitable for a college girl. Get everything Emily needs for school. Don't mention it was my idea."

The low voice came from the adjacent balcony, accompanied by the rustling of papers.

The call lasted nearly forty minutes.

Occasionally, there were stifled coughs. Whether from the mountain chill or the cigarette glowing between his fingers, she couldn't tell.

Evelyn hugged her arms and sneezed.

"Evelyn?" His voice tensed abruptly.

"Yeah."

"Why are you awake?"

"Had enough sleep." She turned toward the sound. "You haven't slept at all?"

Alexander quickly stubbed out his cigarette and turned away from the wind, taking a deep breath.

"It's cold out here." His voice carried a hint of apology. "Did I wake you?"

"The soundproofing is good." Evelyn gazed at the distant mountain silhouettes. "Maybe it's the aftereffects of night shifts. Back when I had early rounds after overnight duty, I had to get up by five to prep for ward checks."

The watch face glowed faintly in the dark. "You can still sleep for two more hours."

"What about you?" she suddenly asked.

"What?"

"Shuttling between the UK and here, handling hospital matters... Do you leave company business for the middle of the night?" Her tone was calm.

Alexander's breath hitched.

He couldn't tell if this was concern or if he was reading too much into it.

"Emily Zade is quite capable." He changed the subject. "I'm promoting her to VP next month."

Evelyn gave a soft "Mm."

Just then, the landline in his room rang sharply.

"Room service." Before she could speak, Alexander explained. "I just ordered it."
###Chapter 401: I'll Watch Over Your Home

"Room service? At this hour?"

Alexander Hamilton strode toward the door. "I ordered something. It must have arrived."

The doorbell kept ringing insistently.

Evelyn Carter rubbed her temples. "Go answer it before it disturbs other guests."

He nodded and swiftly opened the door.

Two minutes later, he returned carrying a brown paper bag, waving it before her. "Just a delivery."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. The flat bag didn't seem to contain food.

"I'm going to bed."

"Goodnight."

That night, she tossed and turned restlessly.

Her phone screen lit up with a message from Gregory Wilson: [Heard you postponed your return to the UK?]

She replied: [A family member is hospitalized. I need to stay and care for them.]

Gregory responded quickly: [Let me know if you need medical resources.]

Evelyn declined politely: [No need to trouble yourself.]

[I renewed the lease on your apartment. It's a prime location—would be a shame to lose it.]

Her fingers trembled slightly as she typed: [Cancel it.]

The chat showed "typing..." but no new message appeared for a long while.

Finally, her phone vibrated: [Can we talk?]

[Sure.]

The call connected almost instantly.

"Evelyn?"

"Dr. Wilson." Her voice sounded hoarse. "I might not return to the UK for a long time."

A brief silence followed. "Because of Alexander?"

"No."

Her answer seemed to relieve him. "Good. Are your parents ill? I can have Vincent arrange caregivers."

"Not immediate family, but... I have to stay."

"I respect your decision." He paused. "I'll cancel the lease. When you return, you can stay at my place while house-hunting."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone. "We'll see."

"Alright. What about the puppy..."

"You keep it."

"Let's name it? Can't just call it 'puppy' forever."

"You decide."

"It's your dog."

Evelyn gazed out the window. "I'm really not good at this."

Gregory pondered. "How about 'Stethoscope'? You're a doctor, and it's always perking its ears up."

She chuckled softly. "Whatever you like."

"So it's settled?"

"Mhm."

Footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Evelyn lowered her voice. "I should go."

"Wait." Gregory stopped her. "Take care of yourself."

By the floor-to-ceiling window, Alexander's silhouette stretched long in the moonlight.
###Chapter 402: Leaving Already?

"...Alright, I understand."

"White Coat and I will wait for you."

She hung up to find someone already standing before her.

Emily Zade remained impeccably groomed in her professional attire, though the mountain morning mist had left delicate droplets clinging to her hair.

"Mrs. Hamilton."

Evelyn corrected her: "Not anymore."

"My apologies," Emily gave a slight bow. "Dr. Carter."

Evelyn's gaze shifted to the young man in gold-rimmed glasses behind her. "Looking for Alexander?"

"Yes."

Noticing her attention, Emily explained: "This is Dr. Chen, here to treat Mr. Hamilton's injuries."

"What happened to him?"

Emily looked surprised. "You... didn't know?"

"Know what?"

"His back burns never fully healed. The rain caused severe infection. He was already feverish and unconscious on the flight back from England. After waking, he rushed to the hospital with only basic treatment. Last night I wanted to bring the doctor, but Mr. Hamilton said you were resting—"

"Emily—"

The elevator doors opened as Alexander strode out.

Clad in a hotel robe with damp hair, his brow furrowed upon seeing her. "You're leaving?"

"Going to check on the hospital."

"Wait while I change. I'll drive you."

He turned back toward the elevator.

"Alexander."

He paused. "Taxis are scarce here. Just three minutes—"

"Are your clothes even wearable?"

His frame stiffened.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Let's go upstairs."

To Emily, she said: "Come with us."

Inside the suite, Emily tactfully ushered Dr. Chen into the adjoining room.

Evelyn's eyes immediately landed on the white dress shirt draped over the sofa—

Its back bore large rust-colored stains mingled with medicinal brown.

No wonder he'd kept his suit jacket on all night.

The ashtray overflowed with cigarette butts.

"...Been busy lately," Alexander said from the shadows.

Evelyn ignored the remark. "Here or the bedroom?"

Emily interjected smoothly: "I'll take Dr. Chen for breakfast."

She exited swiftly with the physician, leaving the medical kit conspicuously placed.

Now alone.

"Take it off," Evelyn ordered.

Alexander held her gaze before slowly untying the robe.

Despite preparation, the sight stole her breath—

Angry, crisscrossed burns oozed through ravaged flesh, a grotesque tapestry against pale skin.
###Chapter 403: Does It Hurt?

The burn wounds were a horrifying sight.

Unlike clean knife cuts, these large patches of festering flesh looked like they'd been mauled by wild beasts, grotesquely covering Alexander Hamilton's entire back and creeping onto his shoulders, neck, and arms.

Evelyn Carter's gaze lingered on the injuries before she pointed to the sofa. "Sit."

"Hmm?"

She'd already opened the first aid kit with practiced efficiency, rummaging for disinfectants. "You're too tall. I can't reach."

Alexander obeyed, turning his back to her. "Are you sure you want to do this yourself?"

"What?" Evelyn didn't look up. "Don't trust my expertise?"

"No." His voice was low. "The wounds are ugly. I don't want to make you uncomfortable."

"I've seen worse in OB-GYN." She cut him off. "Where are the meds from last night?"

"I'll get them—"

Her hand pressed down on his shoulder. "Stay put. Just tell me where they are."

"Nightstand in the master bedroom."

Evelyn strode into the bedroom and returned moments later with several boxes. She scanned the labels and gave a slight nod. "These should work."

"The doctor prescribed them."

"How were you applying them?"

"..." Alexander hesitated. "I waited for Emily to bring the doctor."

Evelyn leaned closer to examine the damage, her fingers hovering just above the inflamed tissue. "The infection's spread too far. Oral meds won't cut it—you need IV antibiotics."

"I'll go tonight." His tone was calm. "After I drop you at the hospital. There's a meeting first."

She twisted open a bottle of antiseptic, soaking a cotton swab. "Not worried about scarring?"

"Doesn't matter."

"It'll look terrible."

"Can't see my own back anyway." A faint chuckle. "Think of it as a patterned shirt."

Evelyn's hand stilled briefly. "This disinfectant stings. Brace yourself."

The moment the swab made contact, Alexander's back muscles tensed violently. His jaw clenched, beads of sweat forming at his temples.

Evelyn worked with clinical precision, thoroughly cleansing every lesion. Three bottles later, his entire back was treated.

"Just a temporary dressing." She secured the gauze. "Have the burn unit redo it at the hospital. No water—at all."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "...Understood."

A germaphobe's nightmare.

Evelyn could practically feel his agony over the coming days. She eyed the wounds suspiciously—had he secretly showered?

"Wear loose clothing. Keep it ventilated."

"Mm."

Suddenly she asked, "Does it hurt?"

A pause. Then, quietly: "Yes."

"At least you're honest." A soft laugh. "Expected you to tough it out."

"Pain reminds me I'm alive." His voice was barely audible. "These past weeks... I've been a walking corpse. Only this ache... proves I can still feel."
###Chapter 404: Clear Boundaries

Evelyn Carter remained silent.

Alexander Hamilton studied her indifferent profile and wisely chose not to speak further.

"The medical fee is 150."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "That cheap?"

"Hospital pricing is transparent."

"I thought a chief physician would charge more."

Evelyn looked up. "First, debridement is charged per session. Second, I'm an OB-GYN specialist."

Alexander pulled out his phone. "Bank transfer?"

"Fine."

A notification chimed.

After confirming the payment, Evelyn sent another transfer.

"Eight thousand. For the hotel."

Alexander's smile froze.

He should've seen this coming.

Evelyn always drew clear lines.

His phone vibrated again.

"Five hundred. For dinner."

Alexander gave a bitter laugh. "Just one meal."

"I can add more if it's insufficient."

"Do we really need to calculate everything?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes."

"Why?" Alexander's voice rose abruptly. "You're kind to everyone except me! Vivian, Natalie, even that liar Peter—they all receive your warmth!"

"You're wrong."

"How?"

Evelyn met his gaze calmly. "This is how I treat people I want no connection with."

Alexander shot to his feet. "Evelyn!"

"I mean it." Her tone remained even. "If you marry Annabelle, I'll genuinely wish you happiness."

"Stop!"

"You've known each other for over twenty years—"

"That's in the past!" Alexander cut her off. "All I want now is a fresh start with you."

Evelyn shook her head. "Unnecessary."

A sudden ringtone interrupted them.

Evelyn checked the caller ID and walked to the balcony. "Dad?"

"Terry, where are you staying now?"

She frowned. "A hotel."

"It's not safe alone. Maybe—"

"No need." Evelyn refused outright. "See you tomorrow."

Hanging up, she turned to find Alexander still standing there, gaze burning.

"Anthony Taylor?"

Evelyn didn't answer.

"They want to reclaim you?"

"None of your concern."

Alexander stepped forward. "Let me help."

"Don't."

"Evelyn—"

"You've apologized countless times." She interrupted. "I've forgiven you. Now, please keep your distance."

Alexander clenched his fists. "So that's your final answer?"

"Yes."

Outside, the setting sun stretched their shadows long across the floor—parallel lines that never intersected.
###Chapter 405: Thank Goodness Alexander Arrived in Time

After hanging up the phone, Evelyn returned to the hospital room to find Alexander had already left.

The medical waste from the dressing change had been neatly disposed of by him.

The solitude brought her relief. She lay back on the bed and soon fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, a familiar figure appeared in the hospital room.

Natalie was carefully feeding Teresa spoonfuls of porridge.

"Evelyn." Natalie brightened when she saw her enter.

Evelyn nodded. "You're here early."

"My dad says we should repay kindness. I don’t have much going on anyway." Natalie handed her the bowl. "You take over."

Evelyn accepted the bowl and continued feeding Teresa with gentle movements.

"Natalie."

"Yes?"

"Were you alone when you arrived?"

Natalie shook her head. "Uncle Anthony was here. He just went to the cafeteria for breakfast, so I stepped in to help."

"This porridge..."

"I made it special—added red dates and goji berries. Great for recovery."

Before she could finish, Anthony rushed in, empty-handed and pale.

"Oh, you're here, Evelyn..."

Evelyn looked up. "What’s wrong?"

Anthony sighed. "Annabelle—older than you but still so careless. We spoiled her too much."

"Did she cause trouble again?"

"She forgot to turn off the stove last night. The old house caught fire." Anthony wrung his hands. "All that wood—it spread so fast."

Evelyn didn’t pause in feeding Teresa. "Is everyone alright?"

"Thank goodness Alexander got there in time..." Anthony suddenly clamped his mouth shut, then hurried to explain, "He was worried the fire might spread to the Hamilton estate. Definitely not for Annabelle’s sake. Don’t overthink it."

So that was why he’d left in such a hurry last night.

Evelyn said flatly, "As long as no one was hurt."

Natalie muttered under her breath, "A grown woman setting a house on fire. Impressive."

Anthony flushed. "She never stepped foot in a kitchen growing up..."

"Well, now that the old house is gone, I don’t have to move in." Evelyn set down the empty bowl.

"I’ll buy you a new place!" Anthony said eagerly. "Any neighborhood you like."

"We’ll see."

Teresa, exhausted from the meal, began to drift off.

Evelyn helped her lie down and tucked her in. "Go check on Annabelle. I’ve got things here."

"No, no, I’ll stay."

"Aren’t you worried about her?"

"..."

"Twenty years of raising someone—of course you’re attached." Evelyn’s tone was calm. "Don’t let her think I’m keeping you away."

Anthony sighed heavily and patted her shoulder. "I’ll be back soon."

"Natalie, could you see him out?"

Natalie understood. "Uncle Anthony, let’s take the back exit. The front’s too crowded."

Once they left, Teresa fell asleep quickly.

The door hadn’t closed all the way. Out of the corner of her eye, Evelyn spotted someone waving animatedly in the hallway.

She chuckled and called a nurse to keep watch before stepping out.

"Evelyn!" Vivian launched into a bear hug. "I’m so sorry—I couldn’t get away with my grandma hospitalized."

Evelyn peeled her off. "Family comes first."

"You’re practically aristocracy now!" Vivian gestured dramatically. "The Taylors’ empire dwarfs my dad’s company. You’ve got to look out for me."

Evelyn poked her forehead. "Cut it out. I’m just a regular doctor."

They settled onto a bench in the hallway.

"You’re really not claiming the family business?" Vivian’s eyes widened. "You’d let that adopted sister take it? Evelyn, fight for what’s yours!"

"I know nothing about business."

"And she does? Alexander can bail her out now, but forever?"

Evelyn gazed out the window. "We’ll cross that bridge when we get there."

"Still going to the UK?"

"Not for now." Evelyn shook her head. "Too much to sort out here."

Vivian sighed. "Such a wasted opportunity."

"Healing people is healing people, wherever I am."

"You’re just accepting this?"

Evelyn smiled bitterly. "Isn’t life just one compromise after another?"

"What about your adoptive parents—"

"Later." Evelyn changed the subject. "How’s Emily doing at school?"

Vivian immediately perked up. "Your sister’s a social butterfly! Joined half a dozen clubs, on the student council—swamped but thriving."

Evelyn laughed. "She adapted fast."

"Best part? The basketball team captain asked her out. Guess what she said?" Vivian mimicked Emily’s deadpan expression. "One word: No. And this guy’s gorgeous—tall, built..."

Evelyn’s smile faltered.

The ex-boyfriend’s damage ran deep.

Looks like Emily would be steering clear of basketball players for life.
###Chapter 406 Time for a Dressing Change

Vivian Dempsey shot to her feet, her expression darkening. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn Carter looked up to see a familiar figure.

Annabelle Taylor, usually so haughty, stood drenched and shivering, a white towel wrapped around her trembling body, her wet hair clinging to her face.

"I came to see my mother."

Vivian scoffed. "Now you show up? While Mrs. Taylor was hospitalized, it was Evelyn and Mr. Taylor taking care of her. And you? Hiding at home like a coward?"

"I wasn't—"

"Weren't what? No one chained you down. You could've come anytime."

"I—"

"Annabelle—"

Alexander Hamilton arrived in haste, visibly startled to see Vivian and Evelyn. "Vivian, you're visiting Evelyn?"

Vivian's gaze flickered between them before she let out a derisive laugh. "Mr. Hamilton, you'd better call me Miss Dempsey. I wouldn't dare presume familiarity."

Alexander carried a medicine bag. Vivian reached for it. "Mrs. Taylor's medication? Give it to me."

Evelyn stopped her. "Teresa's meds are delivered by a dedicated staff."

Understanding dawned on Vivian. She gave Annabelle a pointed look. "Ah, so you were picking up Miss Taylor's medicine."

Alexander handed the bag to Annabelle. "Go back to your room first."

"Alexander, I want to see Mom—"

"Mrs. Lightfoot is resting," Alexander turned to Evelyn. "Last night, there was an emergency. We went to your office—"

Vivian stepped between them. "Say whatever you need to say right here."

Alexander took a deep breath. "The Hamilton family estate caught fire last night. The wooden structure made it spread quickly. My mother had a hypertensive crisis—I had to go back. By the time the fire was put out, it was past midnight. The police needed statements—"

Evelyn asked, "Is Margaret alright?"

"Just shaken, nothing serious."

Evelyn glanced at Annabelle. "Were you injured?"

Annabelle murmured, "Minor burns on my arm and chest."

Vivian sneered. "How thoughtful of Mr. Hamilton to personally fetch your medicine."

Annabelle hurried to explain, "I insisted on coming to see Mom. I delayed Alexander. Dr. Carter, please don't misunderstand—"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "No misunderstanding. If not for this 'detour,' I wouldn't have gotten to see Mr. Hamilton at all."

"Mom just fell asleep," Evelyn said. "If you want to see her, keep quiet."

Annabelle shook her head. "Then I won't go in." She turned to Alexander. "You should talk properly with Dr. Carter." Then she signaled Vivian. "Miss Dempsey, shall we go?"

Vivian crossed her arms. "Stop pretending to be considerate. I haven't forgotten how you nearly burned Evelyn to death!"

"I wasn't in my right mind—"

"Attempted murder is attempted murder!" Vivian's voice rose. "Enjoy prison food!"

Suddenly, Alexander grabbed Evelyn's wrist and pulled her into the stairwell.

"Everything I said was true." He shut the door behind them. "There's nothing between Annabelle and me."

Evelyn nodded. "I know."

"Mr. Taylor and Mrs. Lightfoot asked me to look after Annabelle. She really was hurt in the fire. I was just helping with her medication." He paused. "Is Vivian pressing charges against Annabelle on your behalf?"

"Does it matter?"

"If it is, I'll find you a lawyer." Alexander frowned. "I'll make sure she's comfortable in prison."

Evelyn gave a small laugh. "Let's discuss it after Teresa wakes up."

"You look exhausted." Alexander's gaze softened. "I'll watch over Mrs. Lightfoot this afternoon."

"You've been up all night. Get some rest."

Alexander suddenly said, "I need a dressing change too."

"Then go to the Burn Department." Evelyn turned to leave.

Her wrist was caught again.
###Chapter 407: Evelyn, Change My Dressing

Alexander Hamilton wrapped his arms around Evelyn Carter's waist from behind, his voice low. "Evelyn, help me change the dressing."

Evelyn froze.

"I'll transfer you another 150?" He pulled out his phone. "I know you don't want to owe me."

She pried his hands away forcefully. "The hospital has professional nurses."

"I only want you."

Evelyn's hand gripped the door handle.

She took a deep breath. "Alexander, let's end this here."

"You're tired? Then I'll go to the Burn Department—"

"I mean between us. It's over."

Alexander's breathing grew ragged. "What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said." Her voice was calm. "After the divorce, we're strangers. No explanations needed. No meetings necessary."

Silence filled the hospital room.

His chest heaved violently. "What do I need to do for you to forgive me?"

"Nothing." Evelyn turned away. "Give my regards to Margaret."

When she returned to her room, only Vivian Dempsey remained, lounging with her legs crossed while scrolling through her phone.

"The white lotus slipped away," Vivian said with a whistle.

"You chased her off?"

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Do you really think all I do is pick fights?"

"Sorry."

"She wasn't here to visit a patient," Vivian scoffed. "She brought Alexander just to spite you."

Evelyn smiled bitterly. "I figured."

"Too bad for her," Vivian said, swinging her foot. "Alexander only has eyes for you now. Any more schemes will just humiliate her."

"Vivian."

"Yeah?"

"It's been over between us for a long time."

——

The news of her return couldn't stay hidden forever.

Once Teresa Taylor's condition stabilized, Evelyn went home.

"Evelyn?!" Grace Anderson circled her in delight. "You're staying?"

The kitchen soon filled with the aroma of home-cooked food, accompanied by the soft strains of Teresa Teng's "Sweet as Honey."

Andrew Anderson rubbed his teacup. "Just come back safe. All I want is to see you and Emily happy."

"I'll visit more often." Evelyn refilled his cup.

"Did those foreigners give you trouble?" Andrew suddenly asked.

"No."

"Those bastards bully you?"

"My colleagues were all kind," she said lightly. "I just missed home."

Andrew laughed heartily. "Mid-Autumn Festival is for family reunions! What about work?"

"I want to take a break for a while." She paused. "I heard about the demolition?"

The next morning, the demolition team arrived.

Leading them was Fiona Longwell, her nameplate glinting coldly: Longwell Construction.

Not Hamilton Group anymore?

"30 square meters free. Anything beyond that at market price." Fiona's red nails tapped the calculator.

Andrew slammed the table. "We were promised a square-meter exchange!"

"That was Hamilton Group's policy." The woman smiled insincerely. "Small companies like ours can't afford losses."

Evelyn held her father back. "How much for a three-bedroom?"

The calculator clicked. "Five million."

Andrew gasped. "Let's get a smaller one—"

"The smallest is 60 square meters," Fiona said, brushing off her suit. "A one-bedroom. Your daughter would have to sleep on the floor when she visits."

She handed over a business card. "Decide quickly. The offer won't last."
###Chapter 408: The Visit

After Fiona Longwell left, the house fell into complete silence.

Grace Anderson gazed at the table full of cold dishes and sighed softly. "I'll reheat the food."

Andrew Anderson instinctively reached for his cigarette pack, but Evelyn Carter stopped him. "Dad, don't."

"The Hamiltons?" Andrew scoffed.

Evelyn's heart tightened.

"I always wondered why anyone would bother demolishing this dump. So it's Alexander Hamilton's doing?"

"..."

"Evelyn, that apartment near the hospital—was it arranged for you?"

Evelyn lowered her eyes. "In a way, yes."

"Is he still bothering you?"

"...Not anymore."

"Now they send someone else to negotiate the demolition. Has he given up?"

Evelyn recalled their conversation in the hospital stairwell and nodded slowly.

The lighter flicked open with a sharp click.

Andrew lit his cigarette. "Last one."

Grace returned with the reheated dishes, but the family ate without appetite.

"Here's an idea," Grace said, taking Evelyn's hand. "We don't have to take the apartment. We can keep renting here. The compensation isn't much, but you can save it for your future."

Andrew exhaled smoke in silence.

"Andrew, say something."

"Your mother's right. Renting is fine."

That night, Evelyn lay in her sister's old bed.

Her phone screen lit up with a message from Anthony Taylor: Terry, did you and Alexander have a fight?

Evelyn replied: No.

He’s not answering my calls.

He might be busy. Do you need something?

I wanted to check on Margaret.

With Alexander taking care of her, Mrs. Hamilton should be fine.

Given our families' history, I should visit. Could you go in my place tomorrow?

It would be awkward to show up right after their confrontation.

Evelyn dialed Auntie Marry instead.

Auntie Marry sounded delighted. "Madam will be so happy to see you!"

"Tomorrow... Alexander won't be there, will he?"

"You're not coming with the young master?"

"No."

"Did you two... argue? Did that Annabelle Taylor cause trouble again? The young master already—"

"We'll talk tomorrow." Evelyn cut her off.

Hanging up, she confirmed two things: Alexander wasn't home, and he wouldn't be back tomorrow.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the Hamilton estate with a fruit basket and supplements.

Margaret Hamilton looked well. "The fire looked worse than it was. It never reached us."

Evelyn peeled an orange. "As long as you're unharmed. Next time, just call the police."

"My blood pressure has been high lately. I meant to consult a doctor."

"Give me your records. I'll ask for you."

Margaret beamed. "Having a daughter is such a blessing. That son of mine is nowhere to be found."

Auntie Marry handed over the log. "The young master is at the hospital with Mrs. Anderson. He’s trying to spare the young madam the trouble."

Noticing Evelyn's expression, Margaret changed the subject. "How is your mother recovering?"

"She needs rest."

"About what happened back then..." Margaret hesitated. "Your mother has suffered all these years too."

"I understand."

"Let's eat." Margaret gestured toward the dining room.

Just as Auntie Marry was about to notify the kitchen, the doorbell rang.

Margaret frowned. "Who could that be at this hour?"
###Chapter 409: Strangers from Now On

Auntie Marry hurried forward, her voice brimming with joy. "Master Alexander is back! Just in time for dinner. I'll set another place."

The sound of Alexander Hamilton's footsteps grew closer. Evelyn Carter kept her head down but could feel his gaze lingering on her.

It lasted only a moment.

"Mom, are you feeling better?"

Margaret Hamilton patted the empty seat beside her. "Much better. Have you eaten?"

"No."

"Perfect. Join us."

Alexander pulled out a chair and sat across from Evelyn, on the other side of his mother.

Both maintained a deliberate silence.

Margaret explained softly, "Evelyn came to visit me today. I insisted she stay for dinner."

Alexander didn't look up. "Mm. Mom, after dinner, have Auntie Marry pack your things. I've arranged new accommodations for you."

"Why the sudden move?"

"The old house has wooden beams—a fire hazard in winter. And the Andersons next door are renovating. The noise would disturb your rest."

Margaret nodded thoughtfully. "Where are we moving?"

"I bought the unit next to my apartment."

"Your two-bedroom?"

"It's enough for you and Auntie Marry. I'll arrange for a chef."

Margaret glanced at Evelyn, her smile deepening. "Good. You can come home for meals after work."

"Mm."

Evelyn set down her chopsticks. "Aunt Margaret, I'm finished. I need to relieve the night shift at the hospital. Thank you for dinner. I'll send Auntie Marry the adjusted medication plan later."

Margaret stood quickly. "Have some more—"

"I'm really full." Evelyn picked up her bag. "I should go."

"Let Alexander drive you. Taxis are hard to find here—"

"Ride-hailing apps work fine."

Margaret nudged her son. "Alexander!"

He wiped his mouth and stood. "I'll take you."

"No need."

Evelyn strode out of the Hamilton estate.

Taxis were scarce in the suburbs. She added a $20 tip before a driver accepted. The app estimated a 15-minute wait, so she started walking down the tree-lined road.

Emily Anderson called, excited about their family dinner tonight. After hanging up, Evelyn refreshed the app—her ride had been canceled.

The driver apologized profusely. "So sorry, but your location is too remote..."

"I can increase the tip."

"I've already accepted another fare..."

Evelyn hung up. Even raising the tip to $50 yielded no takers.

A horn sounded behind her.

The familiar gold Porsche rolled up, its window lowering to reveal Alexander's sharp profile. "No ride?"

"...It's coming."

His gaze was calm. "Then I'll go ahead."

"Fine."

The window rose, and the sports car roared away.

Evelyn finally hailed a cab on the main road.

At the hospital's cardiology department, she reviewed the adjusted medications and sent the plan to Auntie Marry.

Auntie Marry replied quickly: "Master Alexander left soon after you. Did you meet?"

"No."

"Madam kept urging him to drive you."

"Please thank Aunt Margaret for me."

In the ward, Vivian Dempsey was chatting with Anthony Taylor while Natalie Stapleton fed Teresa Taylor.

Anthony beamed when Evelyn entered. "You're here."

"I visited Aunt Margaret this morning. She's recovering well."

"Good." Anthony gestured to the girls. "Thanks to your friends—Natalie brings soup daily, and Vivian visits often."

Vivian waved it off. "I'm nowhere as thoughtful as Natalie."

Evelyn smiled. "I appreciate you both coming. Dinner on me sometime?"

"Don't. I'm dieting."

Anthony tactfully stood. "I'll take a walk in the garden."

Once Teresa was asleep, the three women settled on a hallway bench.

Vivian couldn't hold back. "What's Alexander playing at? Chasing you while still hung up on his ex!"

Natalie whispered, "Vivian said Alexander took Miss Annabelle to a gathering last night..."

"That bastard Vincent kept it from me!" Vivian stamped her foot. "If Nathan hadn't sent photos, I'd still be in the dark!"

Evelyn frowned. "Wasn't she hospitalized?"

"Who knows..."

Natalie nudged her. "Evelyn, look..."

At the hallway's end, a tall, broad-shouldered man supported a petite woman as they walked slowly, a medicine bag in hand. They disappeared into the elevator.

Vivian rolled up her sleeves. "I'm getting answers!"

Natalie grabbed her. "Don't—"

"Let go!"

"Wait—what does Evelyn think?"

Vivian turned. Evelyn was gazing calmly at the elevator. "No need to ask."

"What do you mean?"

"Between him and me..." Evelyn looked away, her voice barely audible. "We're strangers from now on."
###Chapter 410: A Favor

Vivian Dempsey took a deep breath, her initial agitation gradually subsiding. Two decades of friendship helped her regain composure quickly.

Natalie Stapleton blinked and murmured, "Actually, this might be for the best."

Evelyn Carter turned to her with a faint smile. Natalie immediately flushed and stuck out her tongue. "Evelyn, I was just thinking out loud."

"No, you're right."

Vivian propped her chin on her hand, thoughtful. "Alexander Hamilton has been chasing you for so long. Did he really give up this time?"

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the man and woman standing side by side in the distance. She nodded slightly. "Seems like it."

"You've rejected him plenty before. Why did it suddenly work this time?"

Even Evelyn wasn't entirely sure.

But it didn't matter anymore. Men and women thought differently, and she had no interest in deciphering his motives.

Natalie's words had struck a chord.

Perhaps this was the best possible outcome.

The moment she decided to terminate the pregnancy, her story with Alexander had already ended.

Who he chose to be with now was none of her concern.

From his perspective, with the past irreparable and his childhood sweetheart returning, choosing Annabelle Taylor made perfect sense.

Vivian patted her shoulder. "Come over for dinner tonight? My dad heard you're back and wants to see you."

"See me?"

"Yeah."

"Because of Simon Stapleton?"

Vivian pouted. "Probably. Dad still feels guilty about what happened."

Evelyn shook her head. "It's not that I don't want to. My sister Emily is coming home tonight, and I already promised her."

"Bring her along! Your parents know me anyway. Consider it a welcome-back dinner."

After a moment's thought, Evelyn called home.

That afternoon, when Anthony Taylor came to relieve her, she mentioned the plan.

A flicker of envy crossed his eyes, but his tone remained cautious. "Of course. You just got back from the UK—spend time with them. Once your mother's better, we'll throw you a proper welcome dinner too. Vivian, make sure your father comes."

Vivian glanced at Evelyn's expression and laughed awkwardly. "Sure, we'll see."

Vivian drove Evelyn home to pick up Andrew and Grace Anderson, along with Emily, who had just finished school.

Emily had tanned noticeably and lost weight, but her eyes sparkled with energy.

Evelyn watched her sister in the rearview mirror and smiled. "How's college life?"

Emily rolled her eyes. "Meh. Peter Harrison said university would be easier. Lies! It's more exhausting than high school."

"Has Peter reached out lately?"

"A few times, but he seems busy."

"I see."

"Oh, he asked about you."

"What did he say?"

"The usual—how you're doing, if work's keeping you busy. When I mentioned you were in the UK, he seemed surprised."

"Anything else?"

"Nope."

Evelyn nodded. "Peter's swamped with work. Don't bother him too much."

"Got it. I never message him first—he's the one who occasionally texts me."

Evelyn relaxed slightly.

Emily was naive, but Peter was calculating. His chats with her were likely just to gauge her relationship with Alexander. After all, he still worked within the Hamilton Group's sphere—information was power.

Vivian answered a call and covered the receiver. "Dad wants to know if we prefer Chinese or Western food."

"Either is fine."

"There's a Western place up ahead. For Chinese, we'd need to turn around."

Evelyn frowned. "I thought we were eating at your place?"

Vivian sighed. "Dad says Grandma needs quiet, so he changed it to a restaurant to avoid disturbing her."

Evelyn understood.

She turned to her parents. "Chinese or Western?"

Andrew checked the GPS. "Don't turn around. The overpass will be jammed this time of day."

Emily raised her hand excitedly. "Western! I've never tried it!"

Vivian relayed their choice and continued driving, soon parking outside an upscale Western restaurant.

Mr. Dempsey stood at the entrance in an elegant traditional suit, looking sprightly.

"Uncle Dempsey," Evelyn greeted politely.

He welcomed them warmly. "Come in! Your table's ready."

The restaurant's opulent decor screamed luxury.

Evelyn tugged Vivian's sleeve discreetly. "This is too much."

Vivian shrugged. "Dad loves making a show. Tell Emily to order whatever she wants—no holding back."

The long table seated three on each side.

Evelyn helped her parents, unfamiliar with Western cuisine, order truffle fried rice. Emily eagerly picked several exotic dishes.

She chose a steak for herself, cutting it with practiced ease.

Mr. Dempsey smiled. "Evelyn, your knife skills are as precise as a surgeon's."

"You flatter me, Uncle. How's Grandma Dempsey? Let me know if she needs anything."

"Much better. The doctor said rest is all she needs." He paused, expression turning serious. "Evelyn, I actually invited you today to ask a favor."

She set down her fork. "Go ahead."
###Chapter 411 Private Jet

"Evelyn, could you do Uncle Dempsey a favor?"

Uncle Dempsey rubbed his hands together, hesitating as he looked at me.

I set down my napkin. "What is it, Uncle?"

"The Banyan Group project..." He sighed. "The Hamiltons suddenly interfered. Now the entire project is at a standstill."

Vivian's head snapped up. "Dad!"

"I know, I know." Uncle Dempsey waved his hands. "But this really concerns the survival of our family."

I frowned slightly. "Uncle, Alexander and I are already divorced."

"I know this puts you in a difficult position." Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. "But Banyan is our lifeline. The Hamiltons just acquired their raw material factory. Our processing plant will soon run out of supplies."

Vivian stomped her foot in frustration. "Dad! You can't ask Evelyn to do this!"

"I don't want to either." His voice trembled. "The bank loan is due soon. The factory is mortgaged. If this project fails—"

Ring!

The shrill phone call cut him off.

He answered, his face instantly turning pale. "What?! I'll be right there!"

Vivian grabbed his arm. "What happened?"

"Your grandmother..." His voice shook. "She suddenly collapsed!"

I stood immediately. "I'm coming with you."

The wail of an ambulance siren pierced the night.

I jumped into the vehicle and was surprised to see a familiar face.

"Dr. Yang?"

"Dr. Carter?" He was checking Grandma Dempsey's pupils. "It doesn't look good."

Tears welled up in Vivian's eyes. "Last week's checkup said she was stable!"

Dr. Yang shook his head. "Elderly brain hemorrhages can recur anytime. You know this, Dr. Carter."

My heart sank.

The CT room's fluorescent lights stung my eyes.

The head of neurosurgery, Dr. Wang, studied the scans with a grim expression. "The bleeding is extensive. We need to perform a craniotomy immediately."

Crash!

Uncle Dempsey knocked over a nearby instrument tray.

"How... risky is the surgery?" His voice was hoarse.

Dr. Wang sighed. "Given her age, it's dangerous. But it's the only option."

"Do it!" Vivian said firmly.

Dr. Wang glanced at me uneasily. "The problem is... Dr. Jiang, the only one who can perform this surgery, is at an academic conference in the capital."

I pulled out my phone. "I'll arrange a transfer to Provincial Hospital."

"It won't work." He shook his head. "This conference has gathered nearly all the top neurosurgeons in the province."

Vivian's phone clattered to the floor. "Then... what do we do?"

"There's only one way." Dr. Wang took a deep breath. "Transport the patient to the capital via private jet. All the specialists are there, and they have the best surgical facilities."

"I'll book a flight now!"

"No." Dr. Wang was firm. "The patient requires continuous medical monitoring. Commercial flights can't provide that."

I met his gaze. "Tell me what you need."

"A private jet equipped with medical facilities." He checked his watch. "And we need to move fast. The golden window for treating brain hemorrhages is only six hours."

The room fell silent.

Vivian's tears fell soundlessly.

I clenched my fists. "I'll figure something out."
###Chapter 412: Don't Beg Him

"Private jet..." Vivian Dempsey's fingers scrolled frantically through her contacts before stopping at a name. "The Wilsons! Vincent Wilson!"

The call connected to a cacophony of background noise.

"Vivian?" Vincent's voice slurred with intoxication.

She gripped her phone. "Do you have access to a private jet?"

"What?"

"A private jet!" she nearly shouted.

"Oh, no. Planning a trip?" His voice faded in and out as he addressed someone else. "Be right there—"

"Is Alexander Hamilton with you?"

"Yeah," Vincent lowered his voice. "You'd better stay away. He's been snapping at everyone lately..."

The line went dead.

Vivian trembled with fury.

Through the ICU glass, Evelyn Carter watched the monitor's erratic numbers. Mr. Dempsey argued with a nurse, who shook her head helplessly.

Evelyn pulled out her phone.

"Don't!" Vivian grabbed her wrist. "Don't humiliate yourself by begging Alexander."

"I'm calling my parents."

Vivian blinked. "Your biological parents?"

"Yes."

The call connected instantly. Anthony Taylor listened, then asked simply, "Immediately?"

"Yes."

Ten minutes later, he called back. "It's arranged. A car's waiting at the hospital entrance."

Tears spilled down Vivian's cheeks as Mr. Dempsey choked out grateful thanks.

"Prioritize the patient," Anthony said.

The ambulance screamed toward the airport. Evelyn stayed behind to handle paperwork, forwarding medical records to Vivian.

An hour later, Anthony called again. "The plane's airborne. The receiving hospital is prepped."

"Thank you." Evelyn hesitated. "Since when does the Taylor family own a private jet?"

"It belongs to an old friend." Anthony chuckled. "Not Alexander."

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

"I'll introduce you someday." His tone softened. "Whatever you decide, we support you."

That afternoon, Evelyn brought toiletries to Teresa Taylor's hospital room.

"You didn't need to come," Anthony said, peeling an apple.

"The wipes were running low." She arranged the supplies—items Alexander used to replenish.

"I'll stay tonight."

"No need." Anthony shook his head. "Your mother can say a few words now... She feels terrible about..."

On the bed, Teresa managed a fragile smile.

Evelyn gave a quiet nod.
###Chapter 413: The Wild Couple

Night had fallen when Evelyn Carter pushed open her front door to find her parents waiting in the living room.

"Mom, Dad, Grandma Duan was suddenly hospitalized, so today—"

Grace Anderson set down the remote. "We understand. The elderly's health comes first."

Andrew Anderson sighed. "At our age, nothing terrifies us more than midnight calls from the hospital."

Evelyn glanced at the wall clock. "It's so late. Have you eaten?"

"Too angry to eat," Andrew grumbled, slamming the coffee table.

Grace shook her head helplessly. "Your sister said she was attending a high school reunion and still isn't back. Her phone's unreachable."

"Where was the reunion?"

"She rushed off before I could finish asking, like a gust of wind." Grace wrung her hands. "It's past eleven now..."

Evelyn immediately pulled out her phone. "I'll call her classmates."

After several calls, her frown deepened.

"They said... there was no reunion."

Grace paled. "Then where could she be?"

"One classmate mentioned 'Celestial Club'..." Evelyn grabbed her coat. "I'll check."

The taxi stopped before a gilded building.

Roman columns glowed decadently under neon lights as uniformed security scrutinized every guest.

"Alone?" A guard blocked her path.

Evelyn nodded. "I'm looking for someone."

Through the revolving doors, crystal chandeliers forced her to squint.

"Sister-in-law?"

Vincent Wilson swayed drunkenly toward her. "Looking for Alex? Let me—"

He reached for her arm.

Evelyn stepped back. "You've mistaken me for someone else."

"How could I—" Vincent suddenly shoved her hard.

She stumbled backward into a solid chest.

The acrid mix of tobacco and cologne assaulted her senses.

"Alex! Look who I found!" Vincent crowed.

Evelyn looked up into fathomless dark eyes.

Alexander Hamilton's wrinkled shirt bore smudges of lipstick in varying shades. A woman in red clung to him, her crimson lips grazing his ear. "Who's this?"

"My sister-in-law!" Vincent announced.

The woman tittered. "Since when did Mr. Hamilton change wives?"

"Fake marriage last time—"

Nathan York materialized, yanking Vincent away. "You're wasted."

He gave Evelyn an apologetic nod before dragging off the younger man.

The lobby fell silent.

"Where's my gift?" Alexander murmured to the red-clad woman.

She giggled, pulling him toward the garden. "Outside..."

The click of stilettos faded.

"Ms. Carter." Nathan returned.

Evelyn regarded him calmly.

Nathan rubbed his neck. "So it's really... over this time."

"Yes."

"No wonder Alex has been..." He hesitated. "He never explains, but I knew it was you."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone. "I have matters to attend to."

As she turned, Nathan's sigh followed her: "Your photo's still his lockscreen."
###Chapter 414: Who's Prettier - Me or Your Wife?

Evelyn Carter stood at the corner of the hallway, her fingernails digging into her palms without realizing it.

Nathan York rubbed his hands together, hesitating. "Ms. Carter, Alexander—"

"I know," she interrupted, her voice eerily calm.

Nathan scratched his head awkwardly. "He's in a bad mood today..."

"No need to explain." Evelyn lifted her gaze past him, focusing down the dimly lit corridor. "My sister might be here."

Nathan's eyes brightened. "I'll help you find her!"

He pulled out his phone and made a quick call, getting the information in seconds.

"Room 1036," he whispered. "But right now, it's..."

Evelyn was already walking in that direction.

The hallway lights were dim, the air thick with the mingling scents of alcohol and perfume. She moved close to the wall when suddenly, a familiar voice drifted from the lounge.

"Do you like the gift I gave you?"

Evelyn froze.

Moonlight spilled through the atrium, stretching Alexander Hamilton's shadow long across the floor. A woman stood on tiptoe beside him, whispering into his ear.

"Who's prettier—me or your wife?"

Evelyn held her breath.

Nearby, a couple stumbled into a private room, their movements intimate and careless. Trapped between them and the scene before her, a chill ran down her spine.

When she turned, Alexander's gaze met hers through his glasses.

Recognition flashed in his eyes, his pupils contracting sharply.

"You," he said suddenly, his voice icy.

The woman smirked triumphantly, but Evelyn was already striding away.

Outside Room 1036, Emily Anderson nearly dropped her tray when she saw her sister.

"Evelyn?!"

Evelyn grabbed her wrist. "We're leaving."

Emily struggled. "I'm still working—"

"You don't belong in a place like this!"

As they wrestled, Emily's uniform collar slipped, revealing a dark bruise on her collarbone.

Evelyn gasped. "Who did this?"

Emily hastily adjusted her collar. "I just bumped into something—"

"Tell me the truth!"

Emily's eyes welled up. "A drunk customer... But the manager handled it, I swear!"

Evelyn trembled with anger, dragging her sister toward the exit. As they turned the corner, they nearly collided with a tall figure.

Alexander stood there, the lipstick stain on his collar wiped away, but the lingering perfume still clung to him.

His eyes flicked to Emily, then back to Evelyn. "Need help?"

Evelyn shielded her sister. "No."

"This isn't a safe place."

"Thanks to you, I've seen exactly how unsafe it is." She scoffed. "Move."

Alexander didn't budge. The woman from earlier reappeared, looping her arm through his. "Alexander, who's this...?"

Evelyn sidestepped them, pulling Emily away.

Outside, the night air hit them as Emily finally broke into sobs. "I just wanted to earn some money..."

"Since when is that your responsibility?"

"But the house—"

"That's for adults to handle!" Evelyn stopped abruptly. "Do you have any idea how dangerous that was? If I hadn't come—"

Emily hiccuped, unable to respond.

Footsteps approached. Alexander had followed them alone, holding Emily's forgotten employee badge.

"How will you get home?" he asked.

Evelyn ignored him, flagging down a taxi.

Before the door closed, she heard him say, "Evelyn, we need to talk."

The window rolled up, cutting off his words.

In the rearview mirror, his figure grew smaller until it vanished into the night.

Emily whispered, "Was that... your husband?"

"Ex-husband," Evelyn corrected, her voice hoarse.

As the taxi sped through neon-lit streets, Evelyn watched the city blur past. The woman's question echoed in her mind.

"Who's prettier—me or your wife?"

Her lips twisted in self-mockery.

Moonlight glinted off the rearview mirror, illuminating her pale reflection.
###Chapter 415: The Sister Duo's Peril

The night breeze carried a slight chill as neon lights flickered in the distance.

Emily Anderson clung to her sister's arm, bouncing excitedly toward the KTV entrance. "Evelyn, my classmate said the pay here is great—two hundred an hour!"

Before she could finish, a drunken man staggered into their path.

"New girls?" The man reeked of alcohol, his greasy hand landing heavily on Emily's shoulder.

She flinched and shoved him away. "What do you think you're doing?"

Evelyn Carter immediately stepped between them, her voice sharp. "Keep your hands to yourself."

The man squinted at the sisters, then grinned. "A sister duo? Interesting..."

"Let's go!" Emily tugged Evelyn's sleeve.

He blocked their escape. "Don't rush off. Name your price."

Emily's face burned with anger. "You're disgusting! We're here to meet someone!"

"Meet someone?" He scoffed. "Who comes to a place like this to meet someone?"

Another man emerged from the KTV. "Lao He, drunk again?"

"Perfect timing," Lao He jabbed a finger at the sisters. "Look—a genuine sister duo."

Evelyn tightened her grip on Emily's hand, discreetly reaching for her phone.

"Calling the cops?" Lao He snatched it away. "Stop playing hard to get!"

Emily's eyes suddenly lit up. "Alexander!" she shouted toward the entrance. "Help us!"

Alexander Hamilton paused mid-step, a red-lipped woman draped over his arm. His gaze lifted at the commotion.

"Oh, now you know Mr. Hamilton?" Lao He sneered. "You think someone like him would claim trash like you?"

Emily stomped her foot. "He really is my brother-in-law!"

"Enough," the other man cut in coldly. "Since when does Mr. Hamilton's wife frequent places like this?"

Nathan York approached. "Problem?"

Evelyn kept her voice steady. "Just a misunderstanding. We were leaving."

Recognition flashed across Lao He's face, sobering him instantly. "M-Mr. York..."

Nathan's glare was icy. "Get lost."

The sisters hurried away, Lao He's lewd chuckle trailing after them. "A sister duo...what man wouldn't be tempted..."

Inside the taxi, Emily trembled.

"Scared now?" Evelyn's tone was stern. "Still want to come to places like this?"

Emily shook her head violently. "Never again..."

After a pause, she whispered, "Evelyn...can I still call Alexander 'brother-in-law' when we see him?"

Evelyn watched the city lights blur past the window. "Call him Mr. Hamilton."

The night deepened as their taxi merged into the river of taillights.
###Chapter 416: I've Been Waiting for Your Call

Emily Anderson hunched her shoulders and nodded timidly.

"Sis, am I being stupid?"

Evelyn Carter realized her tone had been too harsh. Her little sister just wanted to help ease the family's burdens—that intention deserved recognition.

"Not stupid. Just naive. You're still young and don't know how complicated the world can be. Money can be earned slowly, but your safety comes first. If anything happened to you, Mom, Dad, and I would be devastated."

Emily twisted her fingers. "I was scared too... I've never been to a place like that. But Peter said—"

Evelyn stiffened. "Who?"

Emily backtracked quickly. "N-never mind."

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Peter Harrison sent you there? What exactly did he tell you?"

"I wanted a part-time job, and Peter said his friend worked there as a supervisor... He's always been reliable. Why would he trick me?"

Evelyn suppressed her fury.

After settling Emily at home and waiting for the family to sleep, she went downstairs alone and dialed Peter's number.

He answered instantly.

"Evelyn?"

"Peter Harrison, what the hell are you playing at?"

A soft chuckle came through the line. "I've been waiting for your call."

"You got everything you wanted. Why drag Emily into this?!"

Peter sounded unsurprised. "Let's talk in person?"

"Name the place."

"My place."

"......"

"Relax, my mom's home. I'm perfectly safe."

"Peter, I don't trust you."

He laughed. "Learned your lesson, huh?"

"Can you blame me for being cautious with someone like you?"

"Fine. You pick."

"The late-night food stall by our neighborhood."

Ten minutes later, Peter arrived impeccably dressed in a suit.

He pulled out a plastic chair and ordered a bowl of congee.

"Talk." Evelyn glared at him. "What's your game this time?"

Peter raised an eyebrow. "So you and Alexander really broke up?"

"None of your business."

"Lately, he's been surrounded by women like he's holding auditions. After everything he did for you, I'm curious—what turned him into such a playboy?"

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "What he does post-divorce doesn't concern me. But Emily is only eighteen. How could you send her to Celestial Club? You know how dangerous that place is."

"She wanted to earn money. I had connections. Besides, I warned her about potential risks."

"Did you make it clear enough?"

Peter scoffed. "She's an adult, not a child."

"If someone there decided to hurt her, could she have fought back?"

"Who would dare touch Alexander Hamilton's sister-in-law?"

Evelyn slammed the table. "Stop bringing up Alexander! If you love him so much, why don't you get a sex change and marry him?!"

Peter's face twitched. "You've never worked in business. You don't understand the weight his name carries."

"I'm a doctor. I don't need him."

"That's because you don't know." Peter stirred his congee. "When Vivian Dempsey's grandmother needed emergency treatment abroad, who in H City could arrange a private jet instantly?"

Evelyn frowned. "It wasn't him. An elder family friend helped."

Peter froze. "You're sure?"

"Why would I lie?"

He set down his spoon. "So it really wasn't him..."

Evelyn rapped the table. "Back to the point. Why send Emily to Celestial Club?"

"I wanted to see you and Alexander meet."

"Why?"

"To confirm if your split was real or just a lovers' quarrel."

Peter wiped his mouth. "Vincent Wilson frequents Celestial Club. With Alexander's recent partying, he was bound to show up. If he still saw Emily as family, he'd contact you. But I never expected..."

He paused.

"Seeing you two harassed, he walked away arm-in-arm with a socialite without a backward glance."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "You were at Celestial Club?"

"At the entrance. Saw everything clearly."

"Convinced now? It's over between us. Stop scheming."

Peter suddenly slammed his spoon down.

"I got laid off."

"...Alexander's doing?"
###Chapter 417: Only You Know I'm a Scumbag

"I'm certain now." Peter Harrison's voice was icy. "I was nearly done with that project. The team was working perfectly, about to deliver results. And then—I got axed. The whole team stayed intact. Only I was kicked out."

"So?" Evelyn Carter scoffed. "You want me to beg Alexander Hamilton again?"

"I'm going back." Peter enunciated each word. "I don't care how—threats, bribes, whatever. Just get it done."

Evelyn clenched her fists. "You're threatening me with Emily?"

"Exactly." A cold smirk twisted his lips. "After all, everyone thinks I'm a saint. Only you know how rotten I really am."

"At least you're self-aware."

"That idiot Simon Stapleton thought marrying into the Hardy family would skyrocket him?" Peter sneered. "Touching you when Alexander cared the most? Suicide."

"Where is he now?"

"Who knows?" Peter shrugged indifferently. "Probably lost his mind, hiding in some gutter."

Evelyn stared at him, disgusted. "You're utterly heartless."

"Not everyone's born with a silver spoon like Alexander." Peter tapped the table. "Three days. I want that project back. Or else—"

"Three days isn't enough!"

"The project won't wait." He stood, looking down at her. "Evelyn, your sister's still young. The world has more pits than just Celestial Club."

She shut her eyes, chest heaving.

Peter was pure evil, not even bothering to pretend anymore.

But Emily...

——

Exhausted, Evelyn collapsed onto her bed, thoughts tangled.

After pushing Alexander away so many times, now she had to crawl back to him?

Beep—

Her phone lit up.

[Gregory Wilson: Busy?]

Scrolling up, she saw unread messages and photos—a fluffy puppy nuzzling Gregory's hand.

[White Coat's starting to recognize me. If you don't come back soon, he might forget you.]

Evelyn hesitated before replying: [Sorry, just saw this. Been swamped. Thanks for taking care of him.]

[Gregory Wilson: Mrs. Duan's surgery went well. The surgeon was a world-class expert.]

[That's good.]

[Gregory Wilson: Feeling better?]

[Thanks for asking.]

[Gregory Wilson: Free for a video call? Let White Coat see you.]

A follow-up: [Before he really forgets.]

Her finger hovered over the screen.

[Not tonight. Too tired. If he likes you, that's fine.]

[Gregory Wilson: Do I even deserve his affection?]

[You've cared for him so well. Of course he'd rely on you.]

[Gregory Wilson: So if I keep treating her right, she'll trust me?]

The typo—"her"—pricked like a thorn.

Evelyn didn't know how to respond.

[Gregory Wilson: Coming back to the UK?]

[Not sure yet.]

[The apartment's still yours. If you don't return, I'll bring White Coat to you.]

Her mind churned.

[I need rest. Goodnight.]

——

Morning light filtered through the curtains. Evelyn checked her phone.

A message from 3:40 AM: [Sweet dreams.]

——

At the hospital, Teresa Taylor looked healthier.

"The doctor says she's recovering well." Andrew Anderson held his wife's hand, beaming. "Your mom won't admit it, but she's thrilled to see you."

Evelyn handed her a slice of orange. "That's good."

"You seem preoccupied. Mrs. Duan's condition worsening?"

"The surgery succeeded, but she hasn't woken." Evelyn hesitated. "Dad, that friend who lent the plane... Can I have their contact? I want to thank them in person."

Andrew stiffened. "Old friends don't need formalities."

"Was it the Hamiltons?" Evelyn met his gaze. "Or... Alexander?"

The room froze.
###Chapter 418: He Avoids Seeing Her

Andrew Anderson's Adam's apple bobbed as he struggled to speak.

Evelyn Carter took one look at her father's expression and understood. "You said before this had nothing to do with Alexander Hamilton."

"Well..."

She shook her head slightly.

Never mind. Grandma Dempsey's life was what mattered.

Her father was keeping things from her to spare her feelings.

After all, she'd just had that ugly confrontation with Alexander.

Evelyn wasn't ungrateful. She had no right to blame anyone for this.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

Emily Anderson's name flashed on the screen.

Stepping out of the hospital room, she answered. "What is it?"

"Are you free to talk?" Emily's voice was hushed.

"Go ahead."

"That woman from the demolition company is back, pressuring us to sign. Mom and Dad didn't want me to tell you—I'm calling behind their backs."

"What are their plans?"

"Mom wants to borrow money from relatives back home. Dad's texting friends..."

Evelyn inhaled deeply. "I'll handle it. Stop taking those part-time jobs."

"Okay, I won't do it again."

"Has Peter Harrison contacted you?"

"No, but I called to apologize—"

"Don't bother him anymore."

"...Okay."

"When is Mom leaving?"

"In a few days. That woman is really pushing..."

Evelyn considered. "How's your class schedule this week?"

"Not bad. That's why I thought I could work—"

"Stay home with them. I'll figure out the money."

After hanging up, she returned to bid her father goodbye.

Outside the hospital, she dialed Alexander's number.

The call rang endlessly. No answer.

A second attempt—straight to voicemail.

She tried Vivian Dempsey instead.

"Grandma's surgery went well. Now we wait for recovery." Vivian sounded exhausted.

"Your father's factory—"

"With Hamilton Group making moves, who'd dare work with us?" Vivian gave a bitter laugh. "I told Dad he might as well retire."

"Vivian, give me Nathan York's contact."

"You're reaching out to him?"

"Yes."

"...This isn't just about my family, is it?"

"More than that." Evelyn cut her off. "Just send it."

It took thirty minutes for Nathan to accept her friend request.

"You wanted me?" His tone was wary.

"Where's Alexander?"

"He didn't take your call?"

"Phone's off."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Hold on." Nathan abruptly disconnected.

Five minutes later, her phone rang again.

"Alex is swamped today." Nathan chose his words carefully. "Let me be blunt—he's determined to end things. You saw how it was last night..."

"He won't see me?"

"...It wasn't him who answered earlier."

"Who then?"

"Some woman." Nathan sighed. "Picked up from his bed at nine this morning."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone.

"I see."

"You can tell me what you need."

"Do me a favor." Her voice remained steady. "Tell me where he'll be tonight."
###Chapter 419: A New Woman by His Side

"Sure, you can come," Nathan York's voice came through the phone. "But I should warn you—it might not go the way you hope."

Evelyn Carter tightened her grip on the phone. "Thank you."

A soft sigh answered her before the line went silent.

After hanging up, Evelyn sat at a corner café. She opened a real estate app on her phone, scrolling through the latest property listings in H City.

Numbers flickered across the screen before settling on a familiar development—the relocation housing complex. Prime location, excellent amenities, yet priced nearly 30% lower than neighboring properties.

Now she understood what Peter Harrison had meant. In H City, the name Alexander Hamilton could open doors effortlessly.

Her phone buzzed. Nathan had sent a location pin.

Evelyn stared at the address for three seconds, frowning. It was the same lounge bar Gregory Wilson had taken her to before.

By 4 PM, the lounge was already bustling. The moment she pushed open the door, the mingled scents of alcohol and perfume hit her.

Nathan stood by the bar, giving her a meaningful look.

Following his gaze, Evelyn spotted the familiar figure in the billiards area.

Alexander wore a dark gray shirt today, sleeves casually rolled to his elbows. A young woman in a hoodie stood beside him, listening intently as he explained billiard techniques.

"Come on, Alex," a blond man teased around a cigarette. "First-timers need hands-on guidance, don’t they?"

Laughter rippled through the group.

The girl flushed, fingers twisting nervously around her cue.

Alexander didn’t look up, merely tapping the table. "Focus."

"Am I… doing it wrong?" she whispered.

"Everyone struggles at first." He leaned in, his long fingers covering hers. "Relax your wrist. Eyes on the three-point line."

The girl was practically caged in his arms, her ears burning red.

The cue ball veered off course with a dull thud.

"Seems like the teacher’s not doing his job," Vincent Wilson drawled, swirling his drink with drunken amusement. "Need a better instructor, sweetheart?"

Alexander shot him a cool glance. "Feel free to step in."

Vincent raised his hands in mock surrender. "Wouldn’t dream of stealing your student."

Someone whistled. "Wasn’t Sophia Winston the one leaving with Alex last night? Who’s this—"

"Since when do you police his life?" Vincent scoffed. "He can do whatever he wants now. Who are you to judge?"

Evelyn lingered in the shadows, watching Alexander reset the balls. His expression remained detached, as if the noise around him meant nothing.

"Checking up on him?" Vincent’s voice suddenly rose. "She lost that privilege a long time ago."

The words sliced through Evelyn like a blade. She turned toward the restroom but collided with a stumbling figure in the hallway.

"Well, well," the man slurred, squinting at her before grinning. "Dr. Carter?"
###Chapter 420: What Gives You the Right to Say These Words to Me?

"Are they fighting again?"

Vincent Wilson shot him a sidelong glance. "Have you been living under a rock?"

"No."

"You didn't see the trending topic?"

"What trending topic?"

Vincent ran a frustrated hand through his hair. "Forget it. If you don't know, don't ask. It's bad luck."

The man's curiosity was piqued. He turned to ask the others.

But everyone avoided his gaze, their expressions guarded.

Only one guy leaned in and whispered a few words.

The man's eyes widened. "A mixed-race kid?! Then Alex—holy sh—"

"Shut your mouth!" Vincent snapped. "Everyone keep it zipped, got it?"

"Got it, got it... No wonder Alex has been going out so much lately—"

"You don't know shit!" Vincent suddenly fell silent, his gaze catching Evelyn Carter standing behind them. His face paled. "You... When did you get here?"

The room went dead silent, including Alexander Hamilton, who had been teaching a girl how to play pool.

Alex's eyes flicked over Evelyn for less than a second before he looked away as if she were a stranger. "Aim a little lower. Like this—"

The cue ball struck the eight-ball with precision, sinking it.

The girl beamed. "You're amazing!"

Alex handed her the cue. "Try again."

On her second attempt, she missed the cue ball entirely.

Vincent's drunken haze vanished. He cleared his throat. "Are you here to play or...?"

"To see Alexander," Evelyn said calmly. "We need to talk."

"Uh..." Vincent stole a glance at Alex, sweat beading on his forehead.

Alex acted as if he hadn't heard, speaking to the girl instead. "Focus." He pointed at the cue ball. "Hit here."

The pool hall was eerily quiet, the only sound the clack of balls.

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Alexander, we need to talk."

"Alex..." the girl murmured.

"Don't get distracted."

Nathan York stepped in awkwardly. "Alex is busy. Maybe you could wait? Get the lady some juice."

"No need." Evelyn's gaze was steady. "It'll only take a minute."

Nathan moved closer to Alex. "Alex, Evelyn must have something urgent—"

Alex smirked coldly. "Do you not have anything better to do?"

Nathan backed off, giving Evelyn an apologetic shrug.

"It's fine." Evelyn walked to the lounge area. "I'll wait."

And wait she did—for five hours.

Nathan crept over. "Still waiting?"

Evelyn nodded.

"Alright." He sighed.

From sunset to midnight, the club cycled through waves of patrons. Alex never stopped teaching.

At 2 AM, Evelyn stood again.

Alex's white shirt was soaked with sweat, the outline of bandages visible through the fabric.

"Your wound will reopen," she said softly.

Finally, Alex turned. His eyes were ice.

"What gives you the right to say these words to me?"
###Chapter 421: Evelyn, Do You Know What I Want?

"Doctor?"

Alexander Hamilton scoffed, his eyes filled with mockery. "First time I've seen a doctor making house calls at a billiards hall."

Evelyn Carter ignored his tone and cut straight to the point. "I'm not here for a medical consultation. There's something I need to discuss with you privately. It's past midnight—are you done here?"

"Privately?"

"Yes."

The others present weren't fools. They quickly made excuses to leave.

"Alex, I just remembered I have a meeting."

"My wife's been texting me to come home..."

Nathan York stepped in to smooth things over. "Let's go, everyone! My treat for late-night snacks!"

In moments, the billiards hall emptied, leaving only Evelyn, Alexander, and the girl who'd been learning to play.

The girl, clearly uncomfortable with the sudden tension, bit her lip but showed no intention of leaving.

Evelyn ignored the girl—who looked even younger than Emily Anderson—and asked Alexander directly, "Shall we move? That booth over there?"

Alexander didn't respond, his fingers absently tracing the pool cue.

Evelyn waited patiently.

After a long silence, Alexander finally spoke. "Vincent, come get her."

The girl's eyes welled up. "Will you still play with me next time?"

"Maybe."

She pointed timidly at Evelyn. "Is she... your girlfriend?"

Alexander glanced at Evelyn. "No."

"Then who is she?"

His patience clearly fraying, Alexander dialed a number. "Vincent, get back here now."

Hanging up, he signaled a server. "Escort this young lady to the parking lot."

"Alex!" Tears spilled down her cheeks. "I hate you!"

She turned and ran, the server hurrying after her.

Evelyn watched them go before following Alexander to the booth.

"Speak," he said, leaning back with closed eyes.

"Thank you for helping Grandma Duan."

Alexander frowned. "Vivian's grandmother?"

"Yes. You... didn't know?"

"The Hamiltons have no ties to the Dempseys. Why would I?"

"But the private jet—"

"What private jet?"

Evelyn studied his expression and realized he genuinely had no idea.

It must have been Anthony Taylor's doing.

"Never mind. My mistake." She shifted topics. "I came to talk about Peter Harrison."

Alexander's gaze turned icy. "He approached you?"

"Yes." She was direct. "He got laid off. I know it wasn't your direct order. But he wants back on that project."

"So you're here to plead for your childhood sweetheart?"

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "You know exactly what our relationship is."

"Precisely why I don't understand why you'd beg for him." Alexander suddenly leaned in. "Or is Peter just an excuse?"

"It's for my sister."

His expression darkened. "Who?"

"Peter lured her into working at Celestial Club. Last night, she almost got hurt. He threatened to keep harassing her if I didn't help him."

Alexander's face went cold. "That's it?"

"Yes."

"No."

He stood to leave.

Evelyn caught his arm. "Please—"

Alexander whirled around. "What are you offering?"

Her jaw tightened.

"What do you have to trade?"

"..."

"Evelyn." He stepped closer. "You came alone tonight. Cleared everyone out. What were you expecting?"

Her fists clenched.

She'd anticipated this. Either he'd help out of lingering affection, or... she'd have to pay a price.

But what did she have left?

"Was I wrong?" Alexander's laugh was bitter. "The virtuous Dr. Carter?"

Evelyn lowered her head. "I don't know what you want."

"Then figure it out before coming back."

"Wait—" She grabbed his sleeve. "...Fine."

Alexander's eyes frosted over. "Evelyn, do you know what I want?"

"I do," she forced out. "I accept."

He enunciated each word. "You don't."

"..."

"In your eyes, I'm just some animal ruled by base instincts?"

"..."

"You've rejected me at every turn. No matter how I apologize or make amends, it's never enough. Evelyn, do I lack for women? Why would I force someone who doesn't love me?"
###Chapter 422: If You Don't Love Me, Then Stop Toying With Me

"That's not what I meant."

Alexander Hamilton let out a cold laugh, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Then who were you performing for just now with that self-sacrificing act?"

"I'm sorry."

"Evelyn," he said through gritted teeth, his voice low and strained, "if you don't love me, then stop toying with me. As you wish, we'll be strangers. I won't disturb you again. Let's each live our own lives."

The conversation ended bitterly.

Inside the taxi, Evelyn leaned back against the seat, exhaustion washing over her like a tide.

Alexander had thrown her own words back at her. Though spoken in anger, they left her speechless.

She had been the one to suggest they become strangers. And now, she was the one reaching out.

The ringing of her phone interrupted her thoughts.

"Sis!" Emily Anderson's voice was frantic. "Mom took the long-distance bus back to our hometown this morning!"

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "Didn't I ask you to talk her out of it?"

"I tried! But Mom and Dad don’t want to burden you. They said they’d figure out a way to raise the money first..."

"...I see." Evelyn paused. "Has Peter contacted you?"

"How did you know? He just called to invite me to the new ski resort."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "What did you say?"

"I refused," Emily said firmly. "With everything going on at home, how could I even think about fun? But Peter is so kind—he invited Dad and me to dinner at his place tonight. Since Mom’s not home, we thought..."

"Emily," Evelyn cut in abruptly, "didn’t you say you wanted to try Western food?"

"Huh? When?"

"That time when Vivian’s dad treated us."

"Oh..." Emily's voice softened. "I just wanted to try something new. Mom and Dad have never had Western food before."

"Give me twenty minutes. I’ll take you all out."

"But we need to save money..."

"One meal won’t break us."

By the time the taxi pulled up to the neighborhood gate, Andrew Anderson and Emily were already waiting by the curb.

"Evelyn," Andrew said as he got into the car, frowning slightly, "Western food is so expensive. Aunt Lucy just invited us over..."

"Let Peter spend more time with Aunt Lucy," Evelyn said gently. "He’s been busy with work lately and rarely gets to see her."

The excuse seemed to satisfy her father.

Emily sat quietly in the back seat. Ever since that night at Celestial Club, she had become unusually obedient.

"Sis, where are we going?"

Evelyn hesitated, flipping through her phone. She wasn’t very familiar with Western restaurants.

Vivian Dempsey’s call came unexpectedly.

"Evelyn, I'm back."

The exhaustion in her voice made Evelyn’s heart clench. "Grandma Dempsey—"

"Grandma’s condition is stable. It’s my own problem." Vivian gave a bitter laugh. "I might need your help from now on."

"What happened?"

"The factory... the bank is foreclosing on it."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

That unfinished dinner—this must have been what it was about.

"Is there no way to stop it?"

"There is," Vivian said hoarsely. "If Alexander withdraws and Banyan Group continues the partnership, we can save the factory."

Silence stretched between them.

"I just found out," Vivian whispered, her voice breaking, "that for the past five years, it was only because of you that Alexander let my family barely scrape by..."

Evelyn tightened her grip on her phone. "Let me think about this."

"I'm sorry..."

"It’s not your fault."

After hanging up, Evelyn chose the highest-rated Western restaurant she could find.

Andrew showed little interest in steak and ended up ordering fried rice. Emily, however, eagerly sampled every new dish.

On the way home, Evelyn repeatedly warned her father and sister to stay away from Peter Harrison.

Though puzzled, Andrew was too preoccupied with their financial troubles to press further.

The next morning, Evelyn stood face-to-face with Vivian.
###Chapter 423: The Familiar "Benefactor"

Vivian Dempsey slammed her coffee cup onto the table, her eyes bloodshot. "The bank only gave us one week."

Evelyn Carter studied her friend's exhausted face before glancing at the red sports car parked outside. "You're really selling it?"

"Desperate times," Vivian said with a bitter smile. "A car worth over a million, sold for three hundred thousand."

"Can't you wait a little longer?"

"No." Vivian shook her head. "Other buyers need loan approvals—that takes at least two weeks."

Evelyn frowned. "Have you been drinking?"

Vivian tugged at her lips. "Just a little. Thinking about becoming a corporate slave to pay off debts keeps me up at night." She let out a self-deprecating laugh. "I should've learned from Natalie—at least luxury goods can be returned."

"You're selling your bags too?"

"Posted them online." Vivian sighed. "The factory loan is over ten million. This is just a drop in the bucket." She suddenly leaned in. "Maybe I should seduce Alexander Hamilton?"

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Don't be ridiculous."

"Just kidding." Vivian waved her off. "Worst case, I start over. Who knows? Maybe I'll become the female version of Jack Ma."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. Vivian had stood by her without hesitation before, yet now she could do nothing to help.

"Stop looking like that." Vivian pinched her cheek. "My dad said we should thank whoever lent us that private jet."

"It wasn't Alexander."

Vivian froze. "Then who?"

Evelyn dialed Anthony Taylor's number. After hanging up, she said, "We're having dinner at his friend's place tonight."

That afternoon, while helping Vivian transfer the car title, the buyer paid in cash and sped away as if afraid she'd change her mind.

Watching the car disappear, Vivian murmured, "Now I understand why men treat their cars like wives."

They took a taxi to the hospital to meet Anthony. On the way, Evelyn asked, "What about Mom?"

"Natalie and four nurses are with her." Anthony gave her a gentle look. "I'm on duty tonight."

"I'll take the night shift."

Anthony smiled without responding.

The taxi stopped at the entrance of a familiar neighborhood. Vivian gasped. "Isn't this your marital home with Alexander?"

Anthony explained, "My friend just moved here. Said it's livelier."

Evelyn's heartbeat quickened. With each step, memories grew sharper.

When the elevator stopped on the familiar floor, realization struck.

The door opened to Auntie Marry's cheerful voice: "Madam, you're here!"

Margaret Hamilton rushed forward. "Come in! I made all your favorite dishes."

Vivian's eyes widened. "Mrs. Hamilton, it was you who lent us the jet?"

Anthony chuckled. "We've been neighbors for decades."

Margaret guided Evelyn to the table. "How is your grandmother, Miss Dempsey?"

"The surgery went well. Thank you." Vivian handed over supplements. "These are good for hypertension."

"How thoughtful." Margaret suddenly raised her voice. "Auntie Marry, when is Alexander getting back?"

Auntie Marry checked the clock. "He should—"

The sound of a turning key cut her off.
###Chapter 424: The New Flame Arrives

Evelyn Carter's fingertips turned icy cold.

She understood Margaret Hamilton's intentions perfectly. Last time at the family dinner, Margaret had deliberately summoned Alexander Hamilton home and insisted he drive her back.

Vivian Dempsey gave her hand a reassuring squeeze under the table.

"Don't engage," Vivian whispered.

Evelyn nodded slightly.

"Young master is back!" Auntie Marry's voice rang out suddenly. "And this is..."

Alexander strode in wearing a crisp suit, a strange woman clinging to his arm.

Not some nightclub floozy or college coed.

This time, it was a sophisticated urban professional. The four-leaf clover earrings at her lobes glinted with understated luxury.

"Van Cleef & Arpels," Vivian murmured.

Evelyn shot her a questioning look.

"That jewelry set costs as much as a compact car."

Margaret seemed prepared, offering a gracious smile. "Lydia, you've grown even more beautiful."

"Auntie!" The girl beamed, presenting a gift box. "Alexander and I picked this out together."

Margaret unwrapped the silk scarf and gave her son a meaningful glance. "Excellent taste."

"We took inspiration from that shawl Dr. Carter gave you," Alexander said flatly.

Anthony Taylor turned to his daughter. "You bought it?"

"Last year's birthday gift."

"Uncle Anthony!" The girl suddenly addressed him. "How is Auntie feeling?"

Anthony's smile stiffened. "The same. Annabelle—"

"Will be here shortly," Alexander interjected.

The girl's smile dimmed slightly.

The dining room suddenly felt cramped.

At the six-seater table, Margaret presided at the head with Anthony opposite. Vivian pulled Evelyn to the left side while Alexander naturally took the right, the girl clinging to his side.

"Try this," Alexander served the girl a portion.

"I'm watching my figure."

A phone vibrated silently beneath the table.

Vivian's message flashed: [Another new one? Does he have a wholesale supplier?]

Evelyn replied with a question mark.

[Wait—she called your dad "uncle"?]

Margaret smoothly intervened. "Lydia is the daughter of Banyan Group's Chairman Laurent. She just returned from abroad."

Vivian's eyes widened. "The one collaborating with Hamilton Group—"

Lydia Laurent suddenly stood. "Hello, Dr. Carter! Female med students are so cool!"

Evelyn barely had time to respond when the doorbell chimed.

Auntie Marry hurried to answer.

"Sorry I'm late." Annabelle Taylor's voice carried from the foyer.

The air in the dining room instantly froze.
###Chapter 425: Alexander's New Chapter

Banyan Group.

Evelyn Carter frowned slightly.

The name did sound familiar.

Uncle Dempsey had mentioned that Banyan was once a long-term partner of the Dempsey family. Now Alexander had bypassed them to strike a deal directly with Banyan, causing the Dempsey's financial chain to collapse overnight.

So this Miss Lydia was the treasured daughter of Banyan Group.

No wonder she carried herself with such aristocratic grace—a stark contrast to those social butterflies and college girls who were merely playthings for wealthy men. Lydia's status was clearly in a league of its own.

Margaret Hamilton spoke gently to Anthony Taylor, "Once Annabelle arrives, we'll have a proper discussion."

Anthony nodded. "It's time to settle this."

Vivian Dempsey couldn't resist interjecting, "Uncle Anthony, what exactly are you discussing?"

Margaret explained, "The engagement between Alexander and Annabelle should be dissolved today. We invited Anthony as a witness."

Anthony sighed. "It's the right thing to do."

"Will Annabelle agree?"

"She told me she's willing." Anthony glanced around before adding candidly, "Annabelle can no longer conceive. Alexander adores children, so they'll maintain a sibling relationship moving forward."

Vivian's eyes widened. "So Mr. Hamilton is marrying someone else?"

Margaret's gaze flickered subtly toward Evelyn. "People must move forward. When one party has let go, the other should too—so both can start anew."

Her words deftly explained the situation while preserving Evelyn's dignity.

Everyone present understood the subtext—except Lydia, the outsider. Margaret clearly wanted to keep past complexities from her.

Yet Alexander had specifically brought Lydia to this family gathering.

What did that signify?

Margaret suddenly chuckled. "Lydia is considerably younger than Alexander."

Alexander responded flatly, "Eight years."

Lydia tilted her head playfully. "When Alexander was in college, I was just a third grader. He seemed like a giant back then!"

"Not much taller now," Alexander quipped, placing a rib on her plate. "Eat more. You might still grow."

"I'm twenty-five!" Lydia pouted. "But no matter—I have heels! They'll bring me up to your ears."

Margaret said affectionately, "Heels hurt your feet. Just make him bend down when needed."

A phone vibrated.

Vivian texted: 【Is she marrying Alexander?】

Evelyn replied: 【Not sure.】

【His recent deal with Banyan—was this the reason? But he was flirting with others just days ago!】

Evelyn sent a confused cat emoji.

The doorbell rang.

Auntie Marry answered: "Miss Annabelle."

"Is Alexander here?"

"The young master has arrived."

Annabelle entered slowly, her gaze freezing when it landed on Evelyn.

Vivian rolled her eyes. Evelyn sipped her water.

"Aunt Margaret. Dad." Annabelle's voice was strained.

Margaret said evenly, "Have you eaten?"

"Yes."

"Then join us in the living room. We have guests today."

Annabelle wore a high-necked, long-sleeved outfit that covered every inch of skin.

Passing the dining area, she shot Evelyn another complicated look.

Lydia suddenly stood. "Annabelle."

Her posture was uncharacteristically stiff, fingers twisting together.

Annabelle forced a smile. "Lydia."

"I..."

Alexander pulled her back down. "You've done nothing wrong."

Lydia stared at her plate, absently poking the food with her chopsticks.

"Now that everyone's here," Margaret cleared her throat, "Annabelle, you understand why we asked you to come today?"

Annabelle paled but nodded slowly.

"With your father present, let's speak plainly." Margaret's tone remained calm. "How your engagement with Alexander began is no secret. But he has new plans now. It's time to close this Chapter."

Annabelle locked eyes with Lydia. "Lydia, have you truly decided to marry Alexander?"

Lydia stood again, eyes reddening. "Annabelle, I'm sorry. I know Alexander has always loved you—"

Alexander's brow furrowed, clearly unwilling to revisit the past.

Annabelle smiled bitterly. "Just answer me this—do you genuinely love him?"
###Chapter 426: Perhaps She Never Loved Me

Lydia Laurent's face flushed crimson instantly. "I... I didn't mean..."

Alexander Hamilton slammed his chopsticks onto the table with a sharp crack. "That's not your place to ask."

His tone was calm, but his eyes were icy.

Anthony Taylor's chopsticks faltered, dropping the greens back onto his plate. Margaret Hamilton looked up in surprise.

Alexander methodically peeled a shrimp, his slender fingers deftly removing the shell before placing the meat in Lydia's bowl.

"Eat."

Lydia bit her lip, not daring to speak.

He peeled another shrimp and handed it to Margaret. "Mother, try this."

"...Alright."

"Uncle Taylor, since you're allergic to seafood, I won't serve you any."

Anthony forced a smile. "No need for formalities."

Alexander's voice was detached. "We were family once. Not anymore."

All eyes turned to Evelyn Carter.

No one noticed the solitary figure on the living room sofa.

Anthony patted Evelyn's hand gently, attempting to ease the tension. "Alexander, even if you're no longer our son-in-law, we've watched you grow up..."

Alexander raised his wine glass. "Uncle Taylor, a toast to you."

Their glasses met, rims perfectly aligned.

Alexander withdrew his immediately after the clink.

Anthony took a sip. "Your mother mentioned you're planning for children now?"

"Yes." Alexander nodded. "We delayed before. Now we want to proceed quickly."

"When's the wedding? Lydia's father and I go way back."

Alexander smiled at Lydia. "That's your call. When should it be?"

Lydia's cheeks pinkened. "I haven't decided yet!"

"Don't discuss this in front of Evelyn..."

Alexander addressed Anthony directly. "The date needs discussion. It's my first time, after all—no experience."

"First time?" Lydia blinked. "Vincent said you were married before."

"Mm. No wedding ceremony."

"Didn't she mind?"

"Probably not."

"Every girl dreams of a romantic wedding!" Lydia turned to Evelyn. "Right, Dr. Carter?"

Vivian Dempsey interjected dryly, "Count me out. I'm anti-marriage."

Evelyn was focused on her meal when addressed, her chopsticks pausing mid-air. "Perhaps... most girls do think that way."

Lydia seized the validation. "See, Alexander?"

Alexander smirked coldly. "Is that the wedding you want?"

"I'm talking about you!"

"I don't care."

"Who wouldn't want blessings when marrying their love?"

Alexander's gaze darkened. "Perhaps she never loved me."

Lydia panicked. "Did I say something wrong?"

"Eat your shrimp. It gets fishy when cold."

"Alexander..."

"Be good."

Watching this, Evelyn suddenly understood.

Marriage was like mortise and tenon—one convex, one concave, fitting seamlessly together.

In their marriage, she had been the convex one, consumed by her career. Alexander had suppressed his true nature, playing the role of the doting husband.

Perhaps he'd merely sought a stand-in to perform the charade of a "happy couple."

How laughable.

"Evelyn, why the smile?" Margaret asked kindly. "Thanks to your herbal adjustments, my blood pressure has improved."

"Maintain stability. Contact me if anything changes."

"Visit often. Don't become strangers."

"My schedule is hectic. I may not come frequently."

"That's alright. We can meet elsewhere."

Anthony suddenly asked, "Alexander, will you live next door after marrying?"
###Chapter 427: A Belated Epiphany

Margaret Hamilton gently traced the rim of her teacup. "At my age, my blood pressure hasn't been stable since the fire. Alexander insisted on moving next door to keep an eye on me."

"That's thoughtful of him."

"I just don't want to intrude on the newlyweds."

Alexander Hamilton methodically peeled shrimp, arranging the meat neatly on Lydia Laurent's plate. "We can stay elsewhere."

Clatter.

A fruit knife hit the floor.

Annabelle Taylor scrambled to pick it up. "Sorry—ah!"

Blood dripped from her slender fingers, blooming like crimson petals on the hardwood.

Anthony Taylor rushed over. "How bad is it?"

"It's nothing..." Annabelle's voice trembled.

Margaret stood. "Auntie Marry, fetch the first aid kit!"

"Right away!"

Annabelle forced a smile. "Don't trouble yourselves. I'll go to the hospital. Dad, Aunt Margaret, I should leave."

Anthony blocked her path. "That cut needs immediate attention."

Auntie Marry arrived breathless with the medical supplies. "Good heavens! This might need stitches!"

Anthony turned to Evelyn Carter. "Evelyn—"

Vivian Dempsey clamped a protective hand over her friend's wrist. "Uncle Anthony, Evelyn's an OB-GYN. This isn't her specialty."

Alexander spoke without looking up. "Physicians swear to preserve life. Would she refuse aid?"

"Would you ask a cardiologist to perform brain surgery?"

"She treated my injuries competently."

Vivian scoffed. "You expect Evelyn to bandage your ex-girlfriend?"

"Ms. Dempsey should focus on her family affairs."

Vivian's face darkened. "Is this corporate retaliation?"

"Pure business calculus." Alexander wiped his hands. "Profit dictates my decisions."

"Because I challenged you?"

"Sentiment has no place in commerce."

Evelyn squeezed her friend's arm in warning.

She examined Annabelle's hand. Four fingers bore deep lacerations, flesh gaping.

"No tendon damage." Evelyn addressed Auntie Marry. "Do you have coagulants?"

"Will Yunnan Baiyao work?"

"Anything else—"

Auntie Marry upended the kit. "Here, madam—"

The room froze.

Margaret frowned. "Auntie Marry!"

The flustered maid glanced at Alexander.

He rose. "I'll take Lydia home."

"You've been drinking—"

"She can drive."

As the door shut, a tear splashed onto Annabelle's wound.

Anthony sighed. "Regrets come too late."

Annabelle finally broke. "If only I'd known..."

"Known what?"

She met Evelyn's gaze with red-rimmed eyes. "I should've let you two be together from the start."

Vivian snorted. "Now the mistress plays martyr?"

"If I hadn't gone abroad—"

"Spare us the act. You enjoyed stringing men along."

Annabelle choked back a sob. "You don't understand until you've lost—"

Vivian rolled her eyes. "More like closing the barn door after the horse bolted."

Margaret cleared her throat.

Vivian backtracked. "Poor analogy."

"Let bygones be bygones." Margaret softened her tone. "Annabelle, have you considered relocating overseas?"

"I want to stay with my parents."

"Evelyn cares for them now. You've never lifted a finger your whole life."
###Chapter 428: About Us

After the engagement turmoil, Margaret Hamilton's attitude toward Annabelle Taylor had noticeably cooled. These past few days, with Anthony Taylor present, she had been relatively restrained in her words, careful not to be too harsh.

Annabelle clutched her father's sleeve, her voice trembling. "Dad, I don’t want to go abroad..."

This time, Anthony was unusually firm. "You've lived overseas for years. Your friends and connections are all there. Right now, I need to focus on taking care of your mother. I can’t spare the energy to look after you."

"You’re just afraid of upsetting her!" Annabelle suddenly pointed at Evelyn Carter, her voice rising hysterically. "You’re scared she won’t acknowledge you, so you’re shipping me off to get me out of the way! Ah—"

The antiseptic splashed onto her wound without warning, and Annabelle shrieked in pain.

Evelyn continued calmly, her hands steady. "Disinfecting."

"You did that on purpose!"

"I’ll stop when you stop making noise."

Annabelle bit her lip, then sneered. "At least Alexander didn’t choose you in the end. We’re even."

Vivian Dempsey scoffed. "You got dumped. Evelyn walked away. There’s a difference."

"Then can she give up the Taylor family fortune too?" Annabelle challenged, glaring at Evelyn.

"Annabelle!" Anthony snapped.

"Dad, if she’s so noble, she shouldn’t play both sides! Refusing to acknowledge you but still wanting the money, saying she won’t reconcile but keeping ties." Annabelle lifted her chin. "I’ll go abroad, but half the Taylor assets are mine!"

Anthony’s face darkened. "Are you really so eager for us to die?"

"Just draft the will now. After you’re gone, she and I can fight for our shares."

"Fine. Very well." Anthony was shaking with anger. "Margaret, may I borrow pen and paper?"

Margaret quickly intervened. "Don’t act rashly. Drafting a will is bad luck. Auntie Marry, is Teresa’s meal ready?"

"Yes, yes. I’ll pack it right away."

Margaret turned to Evelyn. "How’s the wound?"

"It needs further examination at the hospital." Evelyn finished bandaging it neatly.

Margaret immediately called the driver. "The car’s waiting downstairs. Annabelle, go straight home after your wound is treated."

Annabelle looked at her father. "Dad, aren’t you coming back to the hospital with me?"

"Where were you when your mother was in surgery? Where were you when she needed someone by her side?" Anthony said coldly. "From now on, go wherever you want. We can’t control you anymore."

Margaret sighed. "Let us know when you get to the hospital."

Vivian said gratefully, "Aunt Margaret, thank you so much for today."

"You’re Evelyn’s closest friend. It’s the least I could do."

As they left the Hamilton residence, Anthony remained silent the entire way.

Vivian couldn’t hold back. "Uncle Anthony, some people aren’t worth torturing yourself over."

Anthony glanced guiltily at Evelyn. "Our indecisiveness has wronged you."

"Just make it up to Evelyn properly from now on," Vivian reassured.

Anthony suddenly stopped. "Evelyn, about the assets..."

"Do whatever you think is best."

"I want to give her a sum of money to buy your peace. The company and properties will be transferred to your name."

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered slightly. "We’ll talk about it later."

A gold Panamera pulled up slowly at the gate.

Alexander Hamilton stepped out and nodded to Anthony. "Uncle Anthony, heading back to the hospital?"

"Yes. I’ve been away too long."

"I’ll have a driver take you."

"Alexander." Evelyn spoke up suddenly.

He looked up. "Yes?"

"Not about last time."

"Then what?"

"About us."

Alexander narrowed his eyes slightly. "Us?"
###Chapter 429: I Don't Like Women in High Heels

Alexander's gaze lingered on her face for a few seconds before he suddenly chuckled lowly. Flexing his wrist, he said coolly, "What's left to discuss between us?"

"Did you hurt your wrist?"

"An OB-GYN shouldn't worry about orthopedic matters."

A phone ringtone cut through the tension.

The name "Lydia" flashed prominently on the screen.

He answered without hesitation.

"Alex, are you home yet?"

"Just entered the neighborhood."

"I bought you some bruise oil. Remember to have Auntie Marry massage your wrist."

"Mhm."

"Thank you for today. I would've embarrassed myself without you."

"If you can't walk in them, don't force yourself to wear high heels."

"But you're so tall. I look tiny without heels." Lydia's voice turned sugary. "Besides, Annabelle looks stunning in heels. I just thought—"

"Don't imitate her."

"But I want you to like me..."

Alexander rubbed his temples. "I don't like women in high heels."

"Really?"

"Yes."

"Do you prefer straight hair or curls?"

"Straight."

"No wonder you kept looking at Evelyn earlier..."

His brow furrowed. "Don't speak nonsense. Mind your manners."

"Okay."

"Get some rest."

"Then hurry home."

"Mhm."

"You're not downstairs yet?"

"Ran into someone."

"An acquaintance?"

He lit a cigarette, tone distant. "Hardly."

"As long as it's not Annabelle." Lydia ventured timidly, "Alex...who do you think is prettier? Me or Annabelle?"

"That Chapter is closed."

"Alright. Goodnight."

Hanging up, Alexander glanced at Anthony. "My girlfriend's waiting. Excuse me."

Without waiting for a response, he turned and disappeared into the night.

Anthony called softly, "Terry?"

"Let's take a cab back to the hospital."

In the taxi, Anthony seemed to wrestle with unspoken words.

On his third hesitation, Evelyn spoke first. "What is it?"

"If you've moved on, look forward."

"I know." She stared out the window. "I didn't stop him to reconcile."

"Then why?"

"It doesn't matter now. I just don't want him taking it out on Vivian and the Dempseys."

......

Teresa's recovery progressed well—she could now change TV channels herself.

Though Evelyn suggested Anthony rest at home, both ended up staying overnight.

At dawn, she approached the hospital room with breakfast, hearing laughter inside.

The moment she pushed the door open, her expression darkened. "What are you doing here?"

Peter stood impeccably suited. "Visiting Aunt Teresa."

"Terry, your friend has been waiting awhile."

Evelyn thrust the food at her father. "Come with me."

In the stairwell, she whirled around. "What's your game?"

"Just paying respects."

"Drop the act!"

Peter shed his pretense. "Heard you went to Alexander. When's he reinstating me on the project?"

"He refused."

"Funny. I thought you had him wrapped around your finger."

"You overestimate me."

Peter narrowed his eyes. "Did he say no, or did you not even try?"

She met his gaze squarely. "I have zero intention of helping you. Threatening my family? We'll sink together—let everyone see who you really are!"

"Fine by me." His smile turned icy. "Forgot to mention—your dad borrowed money from my mom yesterday."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "Did she lend it?"

"Not only that, she asked me to pick up Grace from the coach station. Crowded places can be so...accident-prone. Oh, and your sister insisted on tagging along—"

"Peter!"

"Beg him or sleep with him—I don't care. This project is mine. Otherwise..." He leaned closer. "Think Alexander can protect your family forever?"

"You're despicable!"

"Morality doesn't pay the bills."

A phone shrilled between them.

"Eve! Mom's coming home tonight!"

Evelyn shot Peter a wary look. "I'll get her."

"No need! Peter volunteered!"
###Chapter 430: Is She Also Your Woman?

"Stop bothering Alexander."

"But he said he's free today and has business in that area anyway."

Evelyn tightened her grip on her phone. "Emily, listen to your sister."

"Did things end badly between you two? Why are you so against him?"

"Drop it. I'll pick Mom up this afternoon. Stay home."

As she hung up, Peter leaned against the wall with a smirk. "So defensive?"

"Leave after you've said your piece."

"Going." He adjusted his cuffs leisurely. "But a word of advice—Alexander still has feelings for you. Men are simple creatures. Satisfy them in bed, and they'll give you anything..."

Evelyn scoffed. "You should get a sex change in Thailand. Climbing the ladder on your back suits you better."

"Pity Alexander isn't into that." Peter licked his lips. "Otherwise, I'd be more than willing."

"May your rise to power be swift."

She turned to leave when his voice trailed after her. "Waiting for your good news!"

The coach station swarmed with people.

Grace emerged with luggage in tow, eyes swollen from crying.

"Uncle needs money for renovations, Aunt's saving for her daughter's dowry, and Auntie can barely make ends meet herself..." Her mother's voice trembled.

Evelyn pulled her into a hug. "We still have time. I'll figure something out."

"Maybe ask Vivian—"

The Dempseys were drowning in their own troubles. Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Let's get you home first."

Sunlight glared off the glass facade of Hamilton Group's headquarters.

The receptionist smiled politely. "Mr. Hamilton isn't in today."

Nathan's voice crackled through the phone, punctuated by the clack of pool balls.

"Alex has been obsessed with billiards lately," he whispered. "You should come. The situation is... complicated."

The pool hall was dim, hazy with cigarette smoke.

Evelyn spotted her immediately—the woman from Celestial Club with crimson lips and cascading curls, the one who'd shared a moonlit moment with Alexander.

She leaned against him now, a cigarette between her fingers, his suit jacket draped over her arm.

Alexander's right wrist was visibly swollen, yet his focus never wavered from the table. The cue ball arced gracefully, nestling behind the brown for a perfect snooker.

Lydia and Annabelle sat nearby, flanked by five other unfamiliar women.

"Sis!" Nathan materialized from nowhere. "Alex has been like this lately—"

The red-lipped woman whispered something in Alexander's ear. He frowned and pushed her away. "Your perfume is overwhelming."

"Afternoon Delight~" She pouted. "Don't you think it's sexy?"

Alexander stubbed out his cigarette. "Lydia's young. Mind your boundaries."

"Protective?" Her gaze slid toward Evelyn. "But she doesn't seem to be your beloved."

"Don't talk nonsense."

"Rumor says you loved your ex for over twenty years..." Her finger traced his chest. "Yet the way you look at her? Pure disgust."

Alexander smirked. "Hate is accurate."

Following his gaze, the woman's lips curled. "Is she also your woman?"
###Chapter 431: What Alexander Can Do, I Can Do Too

Alexander Hamilton's slender fingers tapped the rim of his glass, a glint of amusement in his eyes. "What do you think?"

The woman with crimson lips and cascading curls leaned closer, her breath warm against his ear. "I'll bet a million dollars—she's exactly your type."

"We've known each other for less than seventy-two hours." Alexander's lips curled into a cold smirk. "You're quite the mind reader."

"A woman's intuition is never wrong." She swirled her wineglass, her gaze fixed on Evelyn Carter across the room. "The way you look at her... like a panther eyeing its prey."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Nonsense."

"Beneath the resentment lies frustration, and beneath that—desire." She chuckled. "Mr. Hamilton, you can fool others, but not your own heart."

He downed his drink in one gulp. "Shut up."

"Fine, fine." She raised her hands in mock surrender. "But since you're such a generous client, I'll give you some free advice—women hate lukewarm men. The more dominant you are, the harder they fall."

Alexander frowned.

She suddenly lowered her voice. "She's coming over. Need me to play along?"

"Get lost." He tossed a black card onto the counter. "Accounting will settle your fee."

"Perfect!" She pocketed the card with a grin. "Call me anytime you need an extra, Mr. Hamilton~"

The click of her heels faded away.

"Alexander."

Evelyn stood before him, brows slightly furrowed. She waved a hand in front of her nose. "This perfume—"

"Don't like it?" His smile was icy. "Is this about Peter Harrison or Vivian Dempsey? Or did you come just to reminisce with me?"

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Peter."

Alexander suddenly leaned in, trapping her between the bar and his body. "If you're asking for a favor, you should at least show some sincerity."

Evelyn slid a keycard across the counter. "Three days. More if needed."

He scoffed, pinching the card between two fingers before tossing it back. "Dr. Carter, I have a fiancée now."

Her ears flushed red. "And all those other women—"

"Jealous?" His fingers gripped her chin. "Or have you finally come to your senses?"

"Let her go."

A cool voice cut through the tension. Gregory Wilson stood nearby, suitcase in hand, his gaze sharp behind his glasses.

Alexander slowly released Evelyn. "Dr. Wilson... chasing your runaway bride across the country?"

Gregory ignored the jab, stepping closer to Evelyn. "Trouble?"

She shook her head. "It's nothing. You should rest."

"What Mr. Hamilton can do," Gregory said, locking eyes with Alexander, "I can do too."

The air turned frigid.

Alexander polished his gold-rimmed glasses with deliberate slowness. "Planning to steal her away, Doctor?"

"Hardly." Gregory shielded Evelyn with his body. "I just don't like seeing her uncomfortable."

"How ironic." Alexander's smile turned dangerous. "Her discomfort is my favorite sight."

Evelyn grabbed Gregory's arm. "Let's go."

"Not so fast." Alexander blocked their path. "Since Dr. Wilson is so confident, why don't we make it interesting?"

Gregory's glasses gleamed. "What did you have in mind?"

"Let's see..." Alexander's gaze lingered on Evelyn's pale face before he smirked. "Who can uncover Peter Harrison's criminal evidence first."

Evelyn gasped. "Alexander!"

"What's wrong?" He leaned down, whispering in her ear. "Afraid your new lover will humiliate himself?"

Gregory pulled Evelyn behind him. "What are the stakes?"

"Simple." Alexander straightened his cufflinks. "The loser disappears from Evelyn's life—permanently."

"You're insane!" Evelyn's voice shook.

Gregory extended his hand. "Deal."

Their handshake crackled with tension.

Alexander suddenly moved closer, his words for Gregory alone: "Don't forget—she was mine first."

Gregory didn't flinch. "And yet the divorce papers are in my desk."

Alexander's pupils constricted.

Evelyn's phone buzzed. The screen read "Vivian Dempsey." Her fingers trembled.

The storm was coming.
###Chapter 432: Spilled Milk

Evelyn Carter met Alexander Hamilton's gaze directly. "Dr. Wilson's affairs are none of your concern. Right now, you're the only one who can help me."

Gregory Wilson stood nearby, a gentle smile playing on his lips. "Mr. Hamilton has misunderstood. I am indeed pursuing Dr. Carter, but she hasn't agreed yet."

Alexander's expression darkened instantly. His pool cue slammed onto the table with a sharp crack. Without another word, he turned and strode away, his black trench coat slicing through the air like a blade.

"My personal life is none of your business."

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palms. She had prepared for the worst, but she hadn't expected Gregory to appear so abruptly.

Gregory frowned in frustration. "Did I mess things up? I should go explain—"

"Don't." Evelyn shook her head. "He's too angry right now."

"You came to see him..." Gregory's Adam's apple bobbed. "Are you trying to reconcile?"

"I never regret my decisions." Her voice was soft, but the words cut into her own heart like a knife.

Gregory's tense shoulders relaxed slightly. "Good. It's late—let me drive you home?"

The clock neared midnight as the billiards hall's lights flickered off one by one.

As Evelyn gathered her coat, a fluffy white Samoyed puppy wriggled excitedly into her arms. The little furball had grown chubbier, its cloud-like fur even more voluminous.

"He's quite the eater," Gregory chuckled, holding the car door open for her. "We'll figure things out tomorrow, alright?"

Their taxi merged into the night. Suddenly, the driver grinned. "Miss, your boyfriend's been following us the whole time."

In the rearview mirror, a black Audi maintained a careful distance. Evelyn clutched her phone but ultimately didn't dial that familiar number.

When her apartment door clicked shut, she glimpsed through the glass as the distant headlights slowly faded to black.

White Coat scampered in circles around the living room. Just as Evelyn retrieved the dog food, a thunderous crash erupted from the long-vacant apartment next door.

At 3 AM, lights flickered on in the deserted neighboring unit.
###Chapter 433: The New Neighbor

At three in the morning, loud footsteps and the clatter of moving furniture echoed through the hallway.

Evelyn Carter jolted awake. Peering through the peephole, she spotted movers in uniform hauling furniture into the neighboring apartment. She frowned, confirmed they weren’t intruders, then turned back to bed.

The next morning, the doorbell rang abruptly.

Rubbing sleep from her eyes, Evelyn opened the door to find Gregory Wilson standing there, sunlight spilling in behind him, casting a warm glow over his frame. Shopping bags dangled from his hands.

"Dr. Wilson?" Surprise flickered in her voice.

He lifted the bags slightly. "Thought your fridge might be empty since you just moved back."

White Coat, hearing his familiar voice, immediately leapt off the couch and circled Gregory excitedly.

Watching the man and dog’s easy rapport, Evelyn swallowed the refusal on her tongue.

Soon, the clatter of pots and pans came from the kitchen. By the time Evelyn finished freshening up, the dining table was laden with an elaborate breakfast spread.

"Just whipped up something simple," Gregory said, untying his apron. "Wasn’t sure what you’d prefer."

Evelyn eyed the meticulously arranged dishes and sighed. "Dr. Wilson, you really didn’t have to—"

The doorbell interrupted her.

A kindly middle-aged woman stood outside. "Hello! I’m your new neighbor. Could I borrow some ketchup?"

Gregory retrieved a brand-new bottle from the kitchen and handed it over. White Coat trotted over curiously, lost his footing, and slid straight into Evelyn’s legs.

She stumbled backward, her feet slipping—

Strong arms caught her before she fell.

"Careful," Gregory murmured near her ear.

Just then, a familiar deep voice carried down the hallway:

"Alex, breakfast is almost ready."

That voice froze Evelyn where she stood.
###Chapter 434: Undercurrents of Tension

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Carter pressed a hand to her throbbing temple, the aftermath of last night's drinking weighing heavily on her.

The doorbell rang abruptly.

She shuffled to the door in slippers and was met by a kindly middle-aged woman. "Good morning, Miss Carter. I'm Auntie Wu, the housekeeper for your new neighbors."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

Hadn't the unit next door been empty?

"Alexander, do you have any hangover medicine?" A familiar male voice, laced with exhaustion, carried over from the adjacent apartment.

Her fingers tightened around the doorframe.

Vincent Wilson's voice followed immediately. "We just moved in—how would we have that? I'll order some."

"Hurry. My head's killing me."

Footsteps approached, and Vincent emerged from next door. "Auntie Wu, why are you—"

His words died in his throat.

Vincent's eyes widened comically, as if he'd seen a ghost. "Greg?! What are you doing here? Did you... stay over with Evelyn last night?"

Auntie Wu chuckled. "Isn't that normal for a married couple?"

Vincent nearly stomped his foot in agitation. "Auntie Wu, go make breakfast!"

Evelyn paled, her grip on the doorframe turning white-knuckled.

Gregory Wilson steadied her with a hand. "Go inside."

Once the door closed behind her, Gregory turned to his brother. "Why are you living here?"

"I rented it for Alex..." Vincent's voice trailed off as his gaze darted toward Evelyn's door. "When did you get back?"

"Last night."

Vincent sucked in a sharp breath.

This was bad.

"Vincent." Alexander Hamilton's voice came from behind.

Dressed in dark loungewear, his face was alarmingly pale. His gaze frosted over the moment it landed on Gregory.

Gregory nodded calmly. "Mr. Hamilton. What a coincidence."

The air turned glacial.

Evelyn pushed the door open again, holding out a bottle of hangover pills. "Here."

Alexander ignored the offering, his eyes locked on her.

Vincent hastily took the bottle instead. "Thanks, Evelyn."

"Too soon for that," Alexander said coldly. "Your brother hasn't been promoted to husband yet."

The sharp scent of alcohol clung to him. Evelyn frowned. "You were drinking again last night?"

"Since when do I report my schedule to you?" His stare was icy. "Company secrets. Can't disclose."

Gregory stepped slightly in front of Evelyn. "Since we're all here, would you care to join us for breakfast, Mr. Hamilton? I made enough for two."

The tension spiked instantly.

Vincent broke out in a cold sweat. "No, no, we should go—"

"Sure." Alexander's lips curved into a humorless smile as he strode past them into Evelyn's apartment.

Vincent gaped.

"Coming?" Gregory asked.

"I just remembered an emergency!" Vincent bolted.

In the dining room, Alexander sat in Evelyn's usual chair, leisurely eating a sandwich.

He'd forced her into the seat across from him.

Gregory remained standing beside her. "For the record, I didn't stay over last night. I came this morning to make dog food for White Coat and decided to cook breakfast."

The small dog nuzzled affectionately against his leg.

Alexander glanced at the pet and smirked. "How domestic of you, Dr. Wilson."
###Chapter 435: Nice Dog

Gregory Wilson's lips curved slightly. "I wasn't good at housework before, but change is worth it for the woman I love."

Alexander Hamilton sliced his sandwich methodically. "Sounds like Dr. Wilson is getting serious?"

"It's a long road." Gregory's gaze flickered toward Evelyn Carter. "But I'm patient."

Evelyn's fingers twitched. He understood everything—her rejections suddenly felt unnecessary.

Gregory deftly pulled out a leash. White Coat wagged his tail excitedly and trotted over. He bent to fasten the collar, winking at Evelyn before leaving. "You two talk."

Alexander suddenly scoffed. "No need to worry, Doctor. I have a girlfriend."

The air turned icy the moment the door closed.

Alexander used Evelyn's tableware without hesitation, ignoring her hesitant expression.

"This set is—"

"Disposable." He scooped up a spoonful of congee. "Someone enjoys shopping anyway."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. For someone so fastidious, he was suddenly careless.

"I heard you have a project here?"

"Mm."

The curt reply killed the conversation. Evelyn thought of Margaret Hamilton alone at home. "How long are you staying?"

"None of your business." Alexander looked up sharply. "Did you think I came for you?"

"I didn’t."

"You've met Lydia." He set down his chopsticks. "Vincent rented the place."

Evelyn fell silent, sipping her congee. The corner piled with shopping bags caught her eye, Alexander's mocking words echoing: How thoughtful.

Breakfast ended in silence.

Alexander stood, swaying slightly, the alcohol mostly faded. "Thanks for the meal."

As Evelyn cleared the table, the neighbor's door slammed. Through the peephole, she saw Alexander waiting by the elevator.

When the doors opened, Gregory stood in the hallway with White Coat.

The two men locked eyes, neither yielding. White Coat pawed excitedly, the leash taut.

After a tense pause, Gregory stepped back. "After you, Mr. Hamilton."

As Alexander passed, his gaze landed on the happily wagging corgi:

"Nice dog."
###Chapter 436: No Way Out

Gregory Wilson's brow furrowed briefly before smoothing again. He knocked gently on Evelyn Carter's door, his voice warm. "We're back."

White Coat wagged its tail and barked happily.

"Yeah." Evelyn's response was absentminded. She sat curled in the armchair by the window, her gaze unfocused as she stared outside.

Gregory didn't press her. He silently cleared the dining table before retreating to the kitchen. The sound of running water and clinking dishes filled the space.

The living room was so quiet the ticking of the clock echoed.

"Did the talk not go well?" Gregory emerged drying his hands, crouching before her.

Evelyn forced a bitter smile. Not well? It had been a disaster. She steadied her voice. "He's in no state to communicate right now. Thank you, Dr. Wilson, but I need to be alone."

"Alright." He rose, hesitating slightly before moving to the doorway. He crouched again to ruffle White Coat's head. "Stay with her." The dog nuzzled his palm before obediently settling by the entryway.

The clock struck three in the afternoon. Her phone screen remained stubbornly dark. Evelyn finally couldn't sit still any longer. She dialed Vivian Dempsey's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

The automated voice repeated five times. Evelyn grabbed her coat and bolted out the door, heading straight for Dempsey Tower.

The once-grand office building now stood eerily empty. The reception desk was unmanned. A handful of employees packed their belongings. Seeing her enter, they shook their heads. "Miss Dempsey's phone is off. The bank representatives were just here—they're seizing company assets."

Before they finished speaking, several uniformed figures exited the conference room. The lead lawyer flipped through documents. Evelyn approached quickly. "Are you with the bank?"

The lawyer eyed her. "Are you Vivian Dempsey?"

"I'm her friend. How bad is it?"

He adjusted his glasses. "It's beyond bankruptcy liquidation. These assets won't cover a fraction."

Evelyn's fingers turned icy. "Are you pressing charges?"

"The legal representative must be held accountable." He closed the folder. "Sorry, we're on a tight schedule."

"Wait!" She blocked his path. "Just thirty minutes. I promise it's not a delay tactic."

The lawyer frowned. "What could change in thirty minutes?"

"Pushing someone into jail helps no one." Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "If nothing changes by then, I won't stop you."

He checked his watch. "Thirty minutes."

Evelyn ducked into the fire escape, hands trembling as she dialed a long-saved number.

"Evelyn?" Anthony Taylor's voice held surprise. "Are you okay?"

"Dad..." The word caught in her throat. "I need to borrow money."

"How much?"

"Fifteen million."

Silence stretched for several seconds. Anthony sighed. "I have three million in personal funds. The rest..." He paused. "Company funds require Alexander's authorization to move."
###Chapter 437 The Crux Returns to Alexander

After all the twists and turns, everything circled back to Alexander Hamilton.

"I'll go to him." Evelyn Carter glanced at her watch. Time was too tight for explanations.

Anthony Taylor immediately began transferring funds: "Three million is on its way. Alexander just needs to sign. He won't make this difficult for you."

"Understood."

With the money secured, only Alexander's signature remained.

Evelyn dialed his number, but Emily Zade answered instead: "Miss Carter, Mr. Hamilton is in a meeting."

"This is urgent," Evelyn spoke rapidly. "Just a signature. Can you interrupt him?"

Every second counted. The bank would close soon.

Emily hesitated briefly: "I'll try."

The callback came quickly.

"Did he agree?" Evelyn gripped her phone.

"Mr. Hamilton said the company was always the Taylor family's asset. Since Mr. Taylor consents, he has no objections." Emily paused. "However, he wishes to formally return operational control to you. Permanently."

A clean break.

Evelyn bit her lip: "Agreed."

"Please come to headquarters immediately to finalize."

She moved fast. Anthony's transfer had cleared. Evelyn forwarded the sum to Vivian Dempsey, then rushed back to the law firm: "Funds are secured. I'll retrieve the remainder now."

The lawyer checked the clock: "Everything must clear before closing."

Evelyn nearly collided with the glass door exiting the office.

At Hamilton Group's executive suite, Emily and legal staff stood waiting.

"Where's Alexander?" Evelyn scanned the empty room.

"En route to the airport," Emily extended the documents. "Pre-signed."

Evelyn flipped to the final page and scrawled her name.

"Don't you want to review terms?"

"Unnecessary." She shut the folder. "He wouldn't manipulate this."

Dusk painted the skyline as she exited.

At the bank counter, her fingers flew across the keypad. When the last transfer processed, she finally exhaled.

Her phone vibrated—Vivian's caller ID flashed.

"Evelyn!" Sobs choked the connection. "The money's here. My father... he's safe..."

"It's over." Evelyn leaned against a marble column outside.

Vivian sniffled: "Was this... Did Alexander...?"
###Chapter 438 Why Are They Together Again?

"The money came from Anthony Taylor."

Vivian Dempsey let out a long sigh of relief. "Thank goodness. I thought you'd sacrificed your dignity for me. That would've been unforgivable."

"Don't be ridiculous. You've helped me so much—it's my turn now."

Vivian quickly bounced back, grinning. "Evelyn, I can't repay you right away, but at least let me treat you to dinner as thanks."

"Sure. Send me the address." Evelyn wanted to see how she was holding up.

Vivian chose an upscale private dining establishment.

The moment Evelyn stepped inside, the place felt eerily familiar.

Wasn’t this where Alexander Hamilton nearly drowned that lecherous old man in the koi pond last time?

"Evelyn! Over here!" Vivian peeked out from behind a decorative screen, waving enthusiastically.

Evelyn took her seat. "Why pick somewhere so far?"

Vivian's eyes were still red, her cheeks thinner than before, but her smile remained bright. "Only the best for you. Too bad I couldn’t get a private room."

The restaurant had limited seating daily, so securing a window table was already lucky.

"The main hall is fine. We can watch the fish," Evelyn said.

Vivian’s eyes suddenly welled up. "You’re too good to me... By the way, I missed your call earlier because I was visiting Dad’s old friends. All those so-called brothers are avoiding me now."

Evelyn handed her a tissue. "People show their true colors in tough times. Don’t take it to heart."

"I don’t care." Vivian wiped her tears, then remembered something. "Oh, I saw the transfer records—the second payment came from the Anderson family company. Did Alexander give you any trouble?"

"I didn’t see him. But he’s no longer managing the Anderson company. He returned control."

Vivian’s eyes widened. "He just walked away?"

"It makes sense." Evelyn flipped through the menu. "The Andersons have nothing to do with him now."

Vivian frowned. "But it’s so sudden. With Mrs. Anderson hospitalized and Mr. Anderson caring for her, who’s running the company?"

"I’m considering hiring a professional manager, but finding someone reliable isn’t easy." Evelyn sighed.

Vivian forgot her own troubles in concern. "What about you? Are you taking over?"

"I’ll have to try." Evelyn gave a wry smile. "I can’t just take the money and walk away."

"But you’re a doctor! You don’t know the first thing about running a company!"

"Which means I’ll have to learn from scratch." Evelyn rubbed her temples. "Hopefully, I’ll find some competent executives. Want to help?"

"No way!" Vivian waved her hands frantically. "I’d just make things worse. You know me."

Evelyn looked at her. "The Dempsey family depends on you now."

Vivian nodded seriously. "I know. I’m already learning. If I actually become some business whiz, I’ll help you. If not..."

"Do your best." Evelyn didn’t want to pressure her.

Vivian suddenly laughed. "If we both run our companies into the ground, you can go back to being a doctor, and I’ll be your chauffeur for free meals."

"Deal."

Evelyn had just smiled when her gaze caught a figure beyond the screen. Her expression froze.

Vivian followed her line of sight. "What’s wrong? Oh my god—is that Alexander and that scheming Annabelle?! Why are they together again?!"
###Chapter 439: Alexander's Private Life Is None of Her Business

Evelyn Carter was flipping through the menu when Alexander Hamilton walked into the private dining room with Annabelle Taylor by his side.

Vivian Dempsey grabbed her wrist. "Look!"

Evelyn glanced up just as Alexander and Annabelle crossed the courtyard. The man in his tailored suit and the woman in a flowing white dress paused by the lotus pond, their reflection forming a picturesque scene.

"How are they together again?" Vivian hissed through gritted teeth. "Didn't Alexander have a new fling?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze and tapped the menu twice. "Let's add the sweet and sour mandarin fish."

"You can still think about food at a time like this?"

"Why not?" Evelyn lifted her teacup. "His private life has nothing to do with me."

Emily Zade had claimed he was abroad—clearly just an excuse. But Evelyn didn’t care. As long as the Dempsey family crisis was resolved, it made no difference whether Alexander was overseas or in another woman’s bed.

Vivian leaned closer. "You’re really not upset?"

"Anger is bad for my health." Evelyn smiled. "Right now, I just want to enjoy my meal."

Vivian skeptically added a dessert to their order. The moment the server left, another graceful figure appeared in the courtyard.

"Lydia Laurent?!" Vivian’s eyes widened. "Is Alexander setting up a battlefield?"

Evelyn picked up a piece of steamed sea bass. The tender white flesh melted on her tongue.

"A current girlfriend and an unattainable love—he sure knows how to indulge." Vivian clicked her tongue. "Think they’ll start a catfight?"

"Everyone lives their own way." Evelyn served her another bite. "Try this. Perfectly cooked."

Vivian’s attention stayed glued to the window. Across the courtyard, the private room door opened, and Annabelle and Lydia stepped out arm in arm, acting like sisters.

"Unbelievable!" Vivian slammed the table. "Such wasted acting talent!"

Evelyn followed her gaze and unexpectedly locked eyes with Alexander. His brows furrowed, his pupils contracting the moment he saw her.

"Alexander!" Lydia’s saccharine voice rang out. "Come take our picture!"

Alexander tore his gaze away and strode toward the moon gate by the pond.

"I’ll be right back." Evelyn stood.

She lingered in the restroom for ten minutes. As water rushed over her fingers, a figure appeared in the mirror behind her.

Annabelle leaned against the wall, her red lips curling. "What a coincidence, Dr. Carter."

Evelyn pulled a tissue from the dispenser. "Excuse me."

"In such a hurry?" Annabelle blocked her path. "I came here specifically for you."

"Something to say?"

Annabelle’s eyes darkened. "Those shares from Anderson Group—they don’t sit right with you, do they? An adopted daughter has inheritance rights too. What Father did was illegal!"

So that’s what this was about.

Evelyn chuckled. "Take it up with Alexander. He handled the transfer. Make a scene with him—maybe you’ll get a bigger cut."

She pushed past Annabelle without looking back. At the end of the hallway, moonlight spilled over the lotus pond, illuminating three entangled figures.
###Chapter 440: The Enemy of My Enemy

Annabelle took a step forward in her stilettos, crimson lips curling with disdain. "Just because Alexander stays silent doesn't mean you belong in that seat. As long as I object, you won't have a moment's peace!"

Evelyn lifted her gaze, eyes glacial. "Oh?"

"I'm not greedy." Annabelle admired her freshly manicured nails. "We split the family assets. Half the company shares go to me. And that 12 million you embezzled—I'll overlook the 3 million Father gave you, but at least return 6 million from the company funds."

Evelyn suddenly laughed. "Is this your idea, or Alexander's?"

Annabelle arched a perfectly shaped brow, smugness oozing. "It was mine initially. But Alexander didn't object, so consider it our joint proposal. Six million is nothing to you."

Evelyn recalled Emily's words—Mr. Hamilton is away on business—her gaze turning arctic. "Dream on. If you're unhappy, take me to court."

That money had already been returned to the bank through Vivian. She couldn't produce it now.

"The money can wait." Annabelle shifted tactics. "But the shares—I want half immediately. It's my rightful due."

Bamboo leaves rustled, casting shadows that sharpened Evelyn's icy expression. "I'll say it again. Sue me. I'll pay whatever the court orders."

Annabelle's face darkened. "You think I won't?"

"Of course you will." Evelyn met her gaze calmly. "I respect the law's judgment."

The law wouldn't entertain such absurdity.

As Evelyn turned to leave, stilettos clattered urgently behind her. Annabelle grabbed her arm. "Stop!"

Evelyn shook her off without looking back.

"You think this is just about money?" Annabelle shouted after her. "I'm saving our parents' legacy! What do you, a doctor, know about running a business? The company will collapse under you!"

Her righteous tone made Evelyn nauseous.

She halted abruptly.

Annabelle rushed to block her path. Corridor lights laid bare both their expressions.

"Even if you're distant from our parents, you can't watch their life's work crumble, can you?" Annabelle softened her voice. "Father already gave you 3 million in private funds..."

Evelyn smirked. "Oh? So you can manage the company?"

"Don't worry about that." Confidence dripped from Annabelle's words. "Alexander ran it perfectly before. If you transfer control to me, I'll ensure he continues advising."

"And then?"

"We'll expand, of course! Far better than leaving it in your hands."

Evelyn had no patience for this drivel. "Want shares? File a lawsuit. Until the verdict, this conversation is over."

Annabelle's expression flickered before she lowered her voice. "There's another way..."

"Not intereste—"

"Return to Alexander," Annabelle cut in. "He'll still support the family business. You lose nothing."

Evelyn stared at her, incredulous. "Have you lost your mind?"

Night wind stirred the bamboo grove.

Annabelle forced a smile. "This option beats the last one, doesn't it?"

"I'm curious," Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "The person who once wished I'd vanish—why the sudden change?"

Annabelle mistook her tone for hesitation. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend. We're not opponents anymore."

"Your list of 'enemies' must be endless." Evelyn's voice dripped sarcasm.

Annabelle plowed on, oblivious. "You've seen Lydia. She's Alexander's official girlfriend now. I need her gone."

That same delusional arrogance. Evelyn felt equal parts disgust and pity.

"I can't do it, but you can." Annabelle leaned closer. "You still matter to him. If you humble yourself, he might not marry Lydia."

Evelyn nearly laughed. "Your imagination belongs in fiction. Keep me out of it."

Those scars still ached. She'd never walk that path again.

Annabelle fake-warmly linked arms with her. "You misunderstand. We're both Taylor daughters—that beats some outsider."

Evelyn pulled free. "By the pond earlier, you and Lydia looked cozy enough, arms entwined for photos."
###Chapter 441 The Wedding Approaches

Annabelle Taylor curled her lips disdainfully. "She's just a spoiled little girl. Lydia's eight years younger than Alexander. Without the Laurent family backing her, do you really think they'd have anything in common?"

"Do whatever you want." Evelyn Carter cut her off coldly. "I'm too busy to play these palace intrigue games with you. File your lawsuit or pull whatever stunt you're planning—bring it on."

She knew Annabelle too well. Today she'd cozy up to take down Lydia. Tomorrow she'd stab Evelyn in the back without hesitation if it served her interests.

Seeing her tactics weren't working, Annabelle suddenly softened her tone. "Relax, my situation's different now. If I can just get Lydia away from Alexander, I won't compete with you for the Hamilton title."

The absurdity made Evelyn laugh outright. "Been binge-watching too many period dramas? Get your head checked. For old times' sake, I can refer you to a good neurologist."

She turned and walked away without looking back, leaving Annabelle seething in the corridor.

The lotus pond shimmered under moonlight as Evelyn crossed the quiet walkway. Lydia should've finished taking photos and returned to the private dining room by now.

Alexander was probably having dinner with her.

The thought had barely formed when familiar voices carried from around the corner. Evelyn froze mid-step, instinctively wanting to retreat—but it was too late.

Alexander stood bathed in golden light, his tall frame unmistakable. His gaze locked onto Evelyn trying to melt into the shadows, eyes turning icy.

"Alexander," Lydia chirped obliviously, swinging her chain-strap purse. "Hold this for me? I'll just touch up my makeup."

He took the pink bag adorned with a plush charm—as天真as its owner. "I'll wait here."

"You're the best!" Lydia spun around and gasped upon spotting Evelyn. "Evelyn! You're dining here too?"

Evelyn gave a curt nod.

"Join us!" Lydia beamed with an innocence that was hard to refuse.

"I'm with a friend."

Undeterred, Lydia gushed about a boutique. "Their hair accessories photograph amazingly!"

"Another time." Evelyn brushed her off.

Watching Lydia skip away, Evelyn took a steadying breath and approached Alexander. "Are you serious about her?"

The plush toy on the pink bag swayed—a perfect match for Lydia's childlike charm.

"None of your concern." His voice was glacial.

Evelyn rarely showed patience. "The Laurents sheltered her too well. She doesn't understand how cruel people can be."

Silence.

"If you truly plan to be with her," Evelyn met his gaze squarely, "stay away from Annabelle."

Alexander laughed coldly. "What gives you the right? Neither party objects. Who are you to interfere?"

He was waiting for an answer.

But Evelyn only sighed. "I don't want to see innocents hurt. If you don't care, consider me meddling."

As she turned to leave, he spoke abruptly. "If I marry Lydia, will you attend?"

She paused. "Date's set?"

"Soon." His voice roughened.

A phone ring shattered the moment. Gregory Wilson's warm voice came through. "Had dinner?"

"Eating with Vivian now."

Alexander stood close enough to hear every word, his mouth twisting into a sneer.

Gregory continued, "Everything resolved?"

"Taken care of."

"Good." His tone brightened. "Need anything from the store? I can drop it off."

Evelyn started to decline when he added, "I miss White Coat. If you're busy, I can walk him."

Alexander finally scoffed aloud.

Gregory persisted, "Your broken light—I borrowed tools to fix—"

"Doctor Wilson checking in?" Alexander interrupted sarcastically. "Planning your own wedding soon?"
###Chapter 442: The Silent Understanding Between Intelligent Minds

Alexander Hamilton's voice dropped to a whisper, deliberately inaudible to Gregory Wilson on the other end of the call.

Evelyn Carter stood between them, her temples throbbing. The recent string of troubles had already drained her, leaving no energy for pointless entanglements.

"You went to see Alexander again?" Gregory's sharp intuition caught her hesitation.

"...Just ran into him."

"He clearly dislikes me."

Evelyn swiftly changed the subject. "Dr. Wilson, do you plan to stay here or return to the UK?"

"Why ask now?"

"Anesthesiologists are in demand everywhere. Wherever you choose, you'll help countless patients." Her tone was calm but distant.

A bitter chuckle traveled through the line. "I see. I'll... keep my distance from now on."

She pressed her lips together but didn't deny it.

"I'll consider your suggestion carefully." His voice tightened.

"Good."

Hanging up, Evelyn strode toward the restaurant without looking back, leaving Alexander's probing gaze behind.

Vivian Dempsey poked listlessly at her plate. "They moved to another spot for photos. Alexander treats Lydia Laurent far better than he ever did Annabelle."

"New love, new priorities." Evelyn replied absently.

"You look pale."

"The corridors were confusing—almost got lost." She deflected, scooping a spoonful of milk custard.

After dinner, Vivian insisted on driving her home.

"No need." Evelyn declined gently. "Dempsey Group must be swarming with work."

Mentioning the company made Vivian's face cloud over, successfully diverting her.

When the taxi stopped at her apartment, the motion-activated hallway light flickered on. Gregory stood by her door, grocery bags and toolbox in hand, squinting against the sudden brightness.

"So late?"

"Your bedroom light's out. Not safe." His smile was warm.

Evelyn checked her watch. "The maintenance crew can handle it tomorrow."

"Safety first for women living alone." His tone brooked no argument.

White Coat bounded over, nuzzling Evelyn before pawing Gregory's pants excitedly.

"Good boy. Walk later." Gregory tied on an apron with practiced ease. "Bought fresh brisket for stew."

The refrigerator door clicked open in the kitchen.

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Dr. Wilson, really—it's unnecessary."

"Not a fan of beef? There's fish—"

"I ate out." She met his gaze squarely. "And please don't come to cook anymore. I can manage."

The air froze.

Gregory's smile stiffened, then smoothed over. "Consider it a gift for White Coat. If it bothers you, I won't bring food again."

"Good." She nodded.

Between intelligent people, some things needn't be spelled out.

"Understood." He untied the apron slowly. "But the light still needs fixing."

Tools clinked softly. Evelyn sat on the sofa, staring into the inky night outside. Gregory walked toward the bedroom, his tall frame casting a lonely shadow.
###Chapter 443 Midnight Terror

Gregory Wilson pulled a brand-new desk lamp from his toolbox and swiftly dismantled it.

The lamp base felt heavy in his grip. He stood there holding the shopping bag and lamp frame for so long his knuckles turned white.

Evelyn Carter lingered at the bedroom doorway, fingertips pressed against the doorframe, refusing to budge.

"I'll have it fixed soon," Gregory said gently, his gaze dropping to her pale fingers.

She shook her head. "You're a surgeon. Your hands matter more than a lamp."

He paused. "Then this lamp—"

"Out with the old, in with the new," she replied flatly, her tone leaving no room for argument.

The toolbox clicked shut. Gregory's throat tightened as the lamp suddenly felt unbearably heavy.

He should've known Evelyn would see through his flimsy excuse. He just hadn't expected to be exposed in less than two days.

"Sorry," he rasped. "Disturbing you again."

"Drive safe," Evelyn said from the entryway, offering no polite invitation to stay.

White Coat suddenly lunged forward, clamping onto Gregory's pant leg with desperate whimpers. The puppy couldn't understand why the man who'd just returned was leaving again.

"White Coat!" Evelyn snapped.

Gregory bent down to cage the little dog, his fingers trembling slightly. This crate was meant for vaccination visits—not farewells.

The lock clicked just as thunder rumbled outside.

By the time Evelyn curled under the blankets, rain was hammering against the windows like insistent knocking.

Half-asleep, she heard strange noises in the living room.

At first she thought it was the dog—until a heavy thud echoed, like someone had overturned the coffee table.

Her eyes flew open.

The bedroom was pitch black. She realized her phone was still in the living room, and the bedside lamp had been broken for days.

White Coat let out a piercing yelp.

Bare feet hit icy floorboards, the chill shooting up her spine. Lightning flashed through the door crack, illuminating a hulking shadow rifling through drawers.

The lamp base felt cold and solid in her grip. As she crept closer, an unfamiliar scent of cigarettes hit her nostrils.

Crash!

The intruder howled as he crashed into the shoe cabinet. Blood oozed between his fingers, appearing almost purple in the lightning's glare.

"Bitch!" He staggered toward her.

Evelyn hurled a vase. Porcelain shards exploded between them. Before she could strike again, an iron grip clamped around her wrist.

The storm swallowed her screams.
###Chapter 444: Alexander! Stop!

The dull pain at the back of his head sent the intruder into a frenzy.

He had only intended to steal valuables and flee when discovered. But the blood on his fingertips ignited his primal instincts.

Evelyn's scream pierced the darkness.

The man's eyes gleamed with malice as he lunged forward, clamping a calloused hand over her mouth and pinning her against the wall.

The cold surface pressed into her back as she trembled uncontrollably.

A flash of lightning illuminated the room.

In that split second, she saw his twisted face—narrow eyes burning with violence, greasy hair obscuring half his snarling features.

Worse still, she recognized the predatory hunger in his gaze.

Her nightgown had slipped during the struggle, the left strap dangling off her shoulder to reveal pale skin.

His eyes slithered down her body like venomous snakes.

"Listen," Evelyn forced out through chattering teeth, "you can still walk away. I'll pretend this never happened—even pay you. But if you touch me, rape carries a minimum three-year sentence!"

He hesitated briefly.

"The building has surveillance. Police will track you down," she pressed on. "Is one reckless moment worth ruining your life?"

Just as she thought she'd gotten through, his lips curled into a grotesque smile.

The world spun as he hurled her onto the couch.

The sound of tearing fabric echoed in the darkness.

Evelyn drove her knee upward with all her strength, breaking free when he recoiled in pain. But before she could take two steps, a vise-like grip yanked her ankle backward.

"Help—!"

Her cry dissolved into the roaring storm.

The attacker smothered her mouth and nose, cutting off her air supply. His clammy fingers crawled along her neck, making her stomach churn.

Suddenly, the crushing weight vanished.

Thudding punches followed, punctuated by the sickening crack of breaking bones.

Through blurred vision, she saw a towering figure silhouetted against the shattered window. Rainwater glistened on his form under the moonlight.

Alexander moved like an enraged lion, each strike delivering lethal force. The burglar crumpled, blood gushing from his nose and mouth.

"Mer—" The plea died mid-word.

Another devastating punch rendered the man unconscious.

"Alexander!" Evelyn scrambled to grab his arm. "Stop! You'll kill him!"

He seemed deaf to her pleas, fists continuing their brutal descent.

A dark crimson pool spread across the floor.

"ALEXANDER!" Her raw scream finally pierced his fury.

The raised fist froze mid-air.

When Alexander turned slowly, the murderous rage in his eyes made Evelyn's blood run cold. Even having witnessed his ruthlessness before, this level of savagery terrified her.

"I'm okay," she soothed softly. "Calm down first."

His gaze swept over her, verifying no injuries before shoving the barely-breathing intruder aside. He shrugged off his rain-soaked coat and wrapped it tightly around her trembling form.
###Chapter 445: Gentleness Won't Keep a Woman

Rainwater trickled down her collar, yet the inside of her coat remained dry and warm.

Evelyn clutched the fabric tighter, covering every exposed inch of skin.

The living room was in shambles.

The window lay shattered, its wooden frame splintered down the middle. The curtains whipped violently in the storm.

Rain mixed with shards of glass coated the floor, streaks of blood snaking between them. The scene resembled a crime scene.

"Alexander, are you okay?"

He scoffed. "If I had killed him, would you call the police?"

"..."

"Answer me."

"Yes."

"Hah. Dr. Carter, ever the law-abiding citizen."

"But I'd explain to them you were saving me—"

Alexander slid down the wall with a bitter laugh. "My ex-wife testifying for me? You think they'd believe that?"

"At least we know each other."

"Because of our failed marriage?" He kicked the motionless figure on the floor with his shoe.

Silence stretched between them.

"How did you hear me screaming so late?"

"I didn't." His tone was sharp. "You think I spend my days watching you?"

"..."

"Or that I bugged your apartment?"

"The storm was loud. I thought—"

"Coincidence. Couldn't sleep tonight." He cut her off.

Evelyn softened her voice. "Work stress?"

Alexander exploded. "Can't you just ask why I couldn't sleep?!"

"I'm not your therapist."

"Fine. Perfect." He stood, jaw clenched.

Evelyn rose too. "Alexander—"

"Go to your room." His voice brooked no argument. "Change out of those clothes and give them to me. Then sleep."

She glanced at the intruder. "Is he alive?"

"None of your concern."

"What are you going to do?"

"When the police come tomorrow, tell them you locked yourself in your room and saw nothing."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "What are you planning?"

"Just do as I say." He frowned.

Lightning illuminated the burglar's pallid face.

She crouched. "Let me check his—"

Alexander yanked her up. "I said leave it!"

"Are you insane?" Her voice shook. "What about Simon—"

"You know where he is?" His eyes glinted dangerously. "Even the police don't."

A chill ran down her spine. "Don't do this..."

Suddenly, the world tilted.

He hauled her over his shoulder and dumped her onto the bed.

"Remember what I said." He loomed over her. "Stay out of the rest."

In the shadows, his gaze darkened at the bruises on her arm.

Evelyn stared up at him, stunned.

Alexander smirked. "Scared? You should've known my true colors last time."

"You're laughing now?"

"You're pale as a ghost." He brushed his fingers against her icy cheek. "Is it him you fear... or me?"

"What would've happened if I hadn't stopped you?"

He flexed his wrist. "Made him disappear."

"Like Simon?"

"Before we married..." Her voice trembled.

Alexander's lips curled. "Take a guess?"

Rain hammered against the broken window.

"Those three years," he murmured, "I thought gentleness was enough."

"A harmonious home. A devoted wife. A life bathed in sunlight."

"Until someone told me—" He leaned closer. "Gentleness won't keep a woman."

Evelyn pulled the blanket around herself. "This isn't the time."

Her fingers trembled in the dark.
###Chapter 446: Where Did He Touch You?

Alexander's gaze was locked onto her like a vice.

"He doesn't deserve death." Evelyn tightened her robe, her voice eerily calm. "Breaking and entering plus attempted rape will put him behind bars for years."

She walked barefoot toward the living room.

His hand clamped around her wrist.

"What are you doing?" Alexander's voice was hoarse.

"Calling the police." She tried to pull free. "My phone's in the living room."

His grip tightened. "You think I care about that?"

"I know you don't." Evelyn met his eyes. "But I do. You acted in self-defense to protect me. That's justifiable under the law."

A cold laugh escaped him.

"Alexander," she inhaled sharply, "rape is a felony. The police will investigate thoroughly."

"Must you always oppose me?" Bloodshot veins appeared in his eyes.

Silence.

"Three years of marriage," Alexander suddenly chuckled, "and you've never truly trusted me."

"This isn't the time! That man might still be alive—"

"You're always so rational." He cut her off. "Building walls no one can breach. Not me. Not Gregory."

Her fists clenched.

"You're right—you don't need love." He stepped closer. "Not even when it comes to your own—"

"Enough!" Evelyn jerked her head up. "I'll handle this myself. The police aren't fools—they'll notice the commotion. I won't drag anyone into this."

His expression darkened. "Burglary leaves fingerprints. But attempted rape is harder to prove unless..."

She let her robe fall open.

The torn nightgown revealed suspicious red marks along her collarbone.

Alexander's pupils contracted violently.

"His DNA is on me." Her voice trembled. "Forensics can match it..."

The air turned glacial.

Alexander seized her shoulders. "Where did he touch you?"

Evelyn averted her gaze. "Just...my neck."

"Just touched?" His voice could freeze hell.

"During the struggle..."

Alexander whirled around.

"Where are you going?"

"To get pliers." He didn't look back.

Evelyn sprinted to block him. "Have you lost your mind?!"

Moonlight illuminated his crimson eyes. "He deserves to die."

She wrapped her arms around his waist. "Don't..."

"The first time you've hugged me," he mocked, "and it's for that scum."

Evelyn recoiled as if burned.

Silence stretched.

"Calmer now?" she whispered.

Alexander said nothing.

She knelt to examine the burglar's injuries. "He's alive."

"Pity." A humorless smirk.

Evelyn performed a professional assessment. "Multiple fractures, severe facial trauma, missing teeth..."

She retrieved her phone and dialed 911.

Alexander stood in shadows, his knuckles bleeding.

"You broke the glass with your bare hands?" she asked after hanging up.

"Got a better idea?" He flexed his fingers. "Should I have used my teeth?"
###Chapter 447: Reaping What You Sow

The locked French windows meant nothing to him.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to his hands. "Are you badly hurt?"

"Just scratches."

His palms were broad and strong, with well-defined knuckles. Even injured, he carried himself with unshaken composure.

"Thank you for today."

The suffocating terror still clung to her.

If he'd arrived a moment later...

Alexander didn't offer excuses. He sank onto the sofa. "Didn't you notice the markings by your door these past days?"

"What markings?"

"A circle with a checkmark inside."

Evelyn shook her head blankly.

"Burglars' reconnaissance symbols."

"There's nothing valuable here."

"A woman living alone is target enough." His voice darkened. "When I spotted it yesterday, I had Vincent investigate. That symbol means they'll strike within three days. So I kept watch tonight."

"..."

"Most single women pretend to sleep during break-ins. Burglars consider that the safest scenario."

Evelyn bit her lip in frustration. She'd been too busy to notice such obvious warnings.

"Though this thief was clearly amateur. Professionals leave doors ajar for escape. This idiot deadbolted everything. I had to break the window."

"Get checked at the hospital when the ambulance comes. He's badly hurt—you must have injuries too."

"Unnecessary."

The ambulance's sirens remained absent.

Tension thickened the air again.

Evelyn recalled their last encounter at the bistro. "Lydia must have moved in nearby too?"

Alexander's head snapped toward her. "What are you implying?"

"Lydia grew up sheltered. She'd be terrified. With all that commotion, she must be worried sick about you."

His laugh was icy. "Trying to shoo me away again?"

"How considerate of you." His molars ground audibly, nearly reopening his wounds. "Never mind what I might feel."

"Who'd dare cross CEO Hamilton?" Evelyn's tone stayed calm, but her resolute eyes delivered the dismissal clearly. "I'll wait for the ambulance alone. The thief's ribs are broken—he's no threat now."

Alexander's blood turned to ice. "You're that eager to send me back to her?"

"Didn't you say Lydia was serious? Even set a wedding date?"

"When did I—" He choked back the rest.

He hadn't denied it. Had even mentioned wedding plans himself. This torment was self-inflicted.

"I owe you for today. Save me an invitation—though my red envelope won't match your elite friends'."

A vein throbbed at his temple. He surged to his feet. "Fine. Perfect!"

He stormed out, stepping over the unconscious thief without hesitation. The door slammed with enough force to rattle the building.

......

Alone, Evelyn kept a white-knuckled grip on the lamp stand, ready to strike if needed.

The thief stayed unconscious.

Near dawn, ambulance sirens finally pierced the night.

Evelyn let the paramedics in. "Multiple rib fractures, possible concussion. Needs a CT scan."

Noticing her injuries, the doctor insisted, "You require hospital examination too. Crucial for police reports."

Wrapped in Alexander's abandoned jacket, she boarded the ambulance.

The ER overflowed with patients. After the thief was wheeled away for scans, Evelyn told a nurse, "I'm a physician. I can handle my own treatment."

Recognizing her competence, the nurse left.

Seated in the corridor while calling the police, Evelyn suddenly heard a gasp. "Dr. Carter?!"

Olivia rushed over, horrified by her battered state. "What happened? Who did this?"

"It's a long story..."

Officers arrived promptly. "Ms. Carter, please accompany us for statements after your examination."

Olivia Lightfoot grabbed Evelyn Carter's wrist, her voice trembling. "Dr. Carter, are you okay?"

Evelyn shook her head, her face pale as paper. "I'm fine."

"Miss, we need to take Dr. Carter back to the station for questioning," the officer said, showing his badge.

Olivia stepped in front of Evelyn. "She's the victim!"

"It's just standard procedure," the officer explained. "She can return after giving her statement."

Evelyn gently patted Olivia's hand. "Don't worry."

Olivia eyed Evelyn's thin nightgown and stomped her foot in frustration. "Wait here—I'll get you a coat!"

In the duty room, Olivia rummaged through drawers and pulled out her own down jacket. She lowered her voice. "Should I exaggerate your injuries in the report? I know someone in forensics."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Go back to your shift."

......

The interrogation room was harshly lit.

Evelyn sat on the stiff chair, recounting the events in detail. When she described being pinned to the couch by the intruder, her voice began to shake.

"I fought back—grabbed whatever I could and hit him over the head..."

A female officer handed her a cup of water. "Take a sip. Go slow."

Evelyn clutched the paper cup, her knuckles white.

The recording officer set down his pen. "The suspect has a record, but only petty theft. This time, breaking and entering with intent to assault—much more serious."

"How... how long will he get?" Evelyn asked softly.

"At least three years," the female officer reassured her. "Make sure you change your locks."

Suddenly, the officer shifted gears. "But the hospital report shows the suspect sustained severe injuries. Skull fracture, three broken ribs..."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered.

"Are you sure you did this alone?" The officer's gaze sharpened.

The air in the room grew heavy.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I was terrified..."

"Miss Carter," the officer tapped the table, "we checked the building's security footage."

Evelyn's head snapped up.

"It shows a man climbing out from your balcony," the officer said, watching her closely. "Who was he?"

Evelyn twisted the hem of her shirt. "He's... a friend."

"We need him to come in for questioning."

"No!" The word burst out before she could stop it. "His identity is... complicated."

The officer frowned. "No one is above the law."

Just then, the door swung open.

"Evelyn!"

Gregory Wilson stood in the doorway, breathless, his suit jacket missing. The moment his eyes landed on her, raw concern flashed across his face.

"Dr. Wilson?" Evelyn stared. "How did you—"

"Vivian called me," Gregory strode to her side, scanning her for injuries. "Where are you hurt?"

The officers exchanged glances. "And you are?"

Before Evelyn could speak, Gregory turned to them. "I'm Dr. Gregory Wilson, Chief of Surgery at Central Hospital. If you have questions, ask me directly."

One officer eyed him. "Dr. Wilson, what's your relationship with Miss Carter?"

Gregory didn't blink. "I'm her—"

"Friend!" Evelyn cut in urgently. "We're just colleagues."

Gregory's throat worked, but he stayed silent.

The officer flipped open his notepad. "Dr. Wilson, where were you between 9 and 11 PM last night?"

Tension crackled in the air.

Evelyn intended to decline Gregory's offer, but standing at the police station entrance, she sighed softly. "I'm really fine. Tell Vivian not to come."

Gregory immediately pulled out his phone. "Alright, I'll let her know."

The female officer gave them a knowing look. After Gregory hung up, she smiled. "Miss Carter, is this the friend you mentioned earlier?"

Evelyn hesitated, her brow furrowing slightly.

Gregory stepped forward smoothly. "I'm her friend. What paperwork needs to be done? I'll handle it."

The officer chuckled. "Miss Carter, your friend seems very protective of you."

Evelyn's lips twitched, but she remained silent.

The officer, now convinced he was the one who'd sent the assailant to the hospital, eyed his refined appearance and warned sternly, "Sir, I understand your emotions, but self-defense has limits. The hospital just reported four broken ribs and nearly all his teeth knocked out."

A flicker of understanding passed through Gregory's eyes.

Alexander was in the next room.

Who had delivered such brutal punishment was obvious.

"Is the man in critical condition?"

"Don't worry, he'll live." The officer mistook his question for feigned ignorance and added, "Next time, control your temper. Excessive force can lead to criminal charges. If someone dies, no amount of money will fix it."

Gregory nodded. "Understood."

Evelyn sighed inwardly, deciding to explain later.

Seeing the matter settled, the officer said, "Sign here, and you're free to go. We'll contact you if there are updates."

As they left the station, Gregory stayed close to Evelyn's side.

"Vivian said if she doesn't see you home safely, she'll release ten thousand cockroaches in my apartment."

The threat was pure Vivian.

The morning wind bit sharply. Evelyn, wrapped only in Alexander's jacket, looked disheveled and reluctantly agreed.

Gregory exhaled in relief, not only opening the car door for her but waiting until she was settled before starting the engine.

Just as they drove off, a gold Panamera glided to a stop near the station.

Lydia rolled down the window. "Alexander, Evelyn left with her boyfriend."

The car fell deathly silent.

"Should we—" Lydia turned and froze at Alexander's chilling glare.

His knuckles whitened, but his voice remained eerily calm. "It's fine."

He jerked the steering wheel and sped away.

Back at the apartment, the forensic team had already left, leaving only the property manager apologizing. "Miss Carter, we're so sorry. Please contact us if you need anything."

Exhausted, Evelyn shook her head. "Thank you. I'll reach out if necessary."

Gregory interjected smoothly. "She needs rest."

The staff took the hint, leaving a card before departing.

"Careful."

Gregory guided Evelyn inside, spotting the shattered glass. He moved ahead to clear it. "Go rest. I'll take care of this."

"Leave it. I'll clean up later."

His gaze lingered on the jacket she wore. "This coat... does it need to be returned?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

It was Alexander's jacket. Given his fastidiousness, he'd likely discard it even if washed.

When she didn't answer, Gregory changed the subject. "The glass is dangerous. It won't take long."

As he turned to fetch the broom, Evelyn entered the bedroom, her back to the door as she removed the jacket.

Gregory glanced up and caught sight of the bruises peeking through her torn nightgown. He quickly averted his eyes.

Only then did Evelyn notice the dark purple marks across her chest. She shut the door to change.

When she reappeared, she wore a high-neck sweater and long pants, concealing every injury.

Gregory finally met her gaze. "The glass is all wrapped up. You can toss it directly."

Evelyn surveyed the tidy living room. "Thank you. I'll handle the rest."

Gregory smiled faintly and set the broom down.

White Coat cowered in the far corner of its crate, trembling violently.

Evelyn's heart ached as she lifted the shivering dog.

Gregory approached. "What's wrong with White Coat?"

"Last night, it tried to protect me and got thrown by the intruder." She stroked the patch of missing fur, then paled. "His leg—"
###Chapter 448: Dress Properly Before Coming Out

White Coat trembled in Evelyn's arms, letting out faint whimpers. His hind legs hung limp, the patchwork of wounds on his fur a horrifying sight.

Gregory knelt down, brows furrowed. "These injuries don't look accidental. Someone deliberately hurt him."

Evelyn's fingers gently stroked the shivering dog, her voice tight with suppressed rage. "The police said that thief had a record... If not for Alex—" She cut herself off abruptly.

Gregory tactfully didn't press, speaking softly instead. "Don't worry. He's safe now."

"Yeah." Evelyn forced a smile. "Thanks for bringing me home. Drive safely."

His gaze lingered on the shattered balcony before he stood. "I should report back to Miss Dempsey."

Evelyn nodded. "I won't see you out."

At the door, Gregory turned suddenly. "The police suggested single women keep men's items by the entrance. I have some old dress shoes—"

"No need," Evelyn interrupted. "My father's clothes and shoes will do."

Understanding, he changed the subject. "What's your plan now?"

"Taking White Coat to the vet first." She looked down at the injured dog with heartache. "I've been too busy to care for him properly."

"Let me take him," Gregory offered. "My place is quiet, good for recovery. And he knows me well."

As if understanding, White Coat tentatively licked Gregory's fingers.

After a pause, Evelyn relented. "Then I'll trouble you. I'll mail his food over."

Exhausted, Evelyn collapsed onto her bed after Gregory left and slept until dusk.

Hunger eventually roused her. Wrapping her nightgown tighter against the chilly draft, she opened the fridge.

Loud footsteps and dragging noises suddenly sounded outside her door.

When the knocking came, Evelyn peered through the peephole—

Alexander Hamilton?

And several unfamiliar men.

"Evelyn, open up." His voice carried through the wood.

She hesitated before pulling the door ajar. Alexander stood at the front, workers hauling large items behind him.

Before she could react, he slipped inside and shut the door on the others.

"Go put on proper clothes." He frowned.

Evelyn glanced down at her turtleneck. "This isn't enough?"

Alexander's gaze swept over her. "...Gained weight?"

"Nonsense."

"Your figure has improved." His eyes lingered pointedly.

Following his stare, Evelyn realized the fitted sweater accentuated her curves too obviously. Flushing with anger, she snapped, "What are those people here for?"

"To fix your window." His tone was casual. "But first, change into something looser."

"The police—"

"I know everything already." Alexander cut her off. "Now go change."

His commanding tone brooked no argument. Evelyn turned toward the bedroom, only to freeze at his meaningful parting words:

"Hurry up. We have important matters to discuss."
###Chapter 449: Do I Look Like I Need Clothes?

Evelyn studied Alexander's expression. He didn't seem like he'd actually break the law.

She'd glimpsed uniformed workers outside earlier—more like renovation crews than anything else.

"Hurry up," Alexander urged impatiently.

Evelyn retreated to the bedroom and pulled on a loose sports jacket.

Only then did Alexander give a satisfied nod.

His gaze drifted to the suit jacket draped over the chair.

"Your clothes are too expensive for me to risk washing," Evelyn explained. "I'll take it to the dry cleaner this afternoon and return it."

"Leave it here." His tone was icy.

"You're not taking it?"

"Do I look like I need clothes?"

Evelyn stiffened. "It's taking up space in my apartment."

"Hang it on the balcony."

"The balcony's for drying laundry—"

Then it hit her. The police had suggested keeping men's clothing visible outside.

Was he hinting at that?

Alexander didn't elaborate. "Where's that nightgown of yours?"

"About to toss it. Why?"

"Nothing. Just didn't expect you to wear that style."

"It's a normal nightgown. What's wrong with it?"

"You used to wear full pajamas." His expression darkened. "Bought it for Gregory, didn't you?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "It was the only cotton option at the supermarket. Besides, didn't you say he couldn't get in?"

"Hmph." Alexander's eyes dropped to the bruises on her wrist. "That bastard did this? Where else are you hurt? It looks bad."

"Minor injuries. They'll fade."

His stare lingered on her neck.

Evelyn tugged her collar higher.

He tossed her a small bottle from his pocket. "Use this."

She caught it. "Liniment?"

"Mhm." The tension in his brow eased slightly. "Worked well when I sprained my wrist."

"...Thanks."

Alexander turned toward the door. "Wait in the bedroom. The crew's all men. They're replacing your windows and locks."

So those large items outside were window frames.

"How did you know my window measurements?"

"Same floor plan as mine. Had them custom-made."

When Evelyn hesitated, he added, "I broke them last night. My responsibility. The workers are waiting, and I have meetings."

She withdrew to the bedroom as demolition sounds filled the living room.

Checking her phone, she saw messages from Vivian.

By the time she replied, the noise outside had stopped.

Alexander knocked. "Done. Come see."

The transformed balcony left Evelyn speechless.

Thickened glass panels now framed the space, reinforced with retractable alloy security bars.

"This is overkill."

"Standard for high-rises now." Alexander handed her a remote. "Retractable. Won't block sunlight."

She tested the sturdy material. "How much? I'll transfer the cost."

Alexander's eyes turned glacial. "What?"

"You were helping me last night. The expense is mine." She glanced at the workers. "Including labor."

"If Gregory had installed these, would you be paying him too?"

Evelyn fell silent.

With Gregory, she'd have refused outright.

"Hmph." Misreading her quiet, Alexander laughed bitterly.

"What's funny?"

"Your best friend's drowning in debt. You're saving for a down payment." His voice dripped sarcasm. "Premium materials. Top-tier labor."

"I can use credit."

Alexander stepped closer, eyes locking onto hers. "If you're that desperate for money, why not ask Gregory? The Wilsons could spare a few million."

"Why would I borrow from him?"

"Because—" His smile turned cruel. "Men will do anything for women they want."
###Chapter 450: Moonlit Confrontation

Alexander Hamilton's gaze was as sharp as a hawk's, locked onto Evelyn Carter's eyes.

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably under his scrutiny. "What's wrong with you today? Did Gregory Wilson provoke you again?"

The faint curve of his lips vanished instantly as he took a step back, putting distance between them.

"Vincent Wilson has been spending too much time with Gregory lately."

"That's it?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Are you seriously jealous of another man now?"

She suddenly recalled Vivian Dempsey's recent obsession with BL dramas and frowned.

Not that she judged—but those plots made her skin crawl.

"Don't overthink it," Alexander said darkly. "Stop picking up nonsense from Vivian."

"I don’t watch them, but I respect her preferences."

"Let her watch whatever she wants. Just don’t join her."

Evelyn sighed and changed the subject. "Last time at the private dining club, I saw you with Annabelle Taylor and Lydia Laurent."

"And?"

"If you've made your choice, treat her right. Don’t leave the other one with false hope."

A flicker passed through Alexander's eyes. "Who do you want me to choose?"

"That’s your decision."

"Tell me anyway. The final say is still mine."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "I don’t want to interfere in your personal life. But seeing Lydia... it’s like looking at my past self."

Alexander’s expression hardened.

"Are you speaking up for Lydia?"

"We’ve barely met," Evelyn said, turning toward the moonlight outside the window. "But I know that feeling too well. Hearing you say 'just friends' while sitting through awkward dinners—no one deserves that."

"Evelyn, I explained. I didn’t know Annabelle would—"

"Let me finish," she interrupted.

Alexander pressed his lips together and nodded.

Moonlight filtered through the security bars, casting fractured shadows on the floor. Evelyn watched their overlapping silhouettes before subtly stepping aside.

"You were good to me when we were married. I thought I was lucky." Her voice was eerily calm, as if recounting someone else’s story. "When the truth came out, that feeling..."

Alexander’s throat moved. "I handled it poorly."

"It’s over." She waved a hand. "But I don’t want Lydia to repeat my mistakes. If this is just a business arrangement, think carefully. I could walk away calmly, but she’s so naive—"

"How do you know she’ll get hurt?" Alexander suddenly sneered.

Evelyn met his gaze. "So you do have real feelings for her?"

The question struck like a slap, silencing him.

"I can tell Lydia likes you," Evelyn continued. "If you can’t give her sincerity, don’t lead her on. Of course, if you can keep up the act forever, ignore my meddling."

Alexander stepped closer abruptly. "You don’t want me to marry Lydia?"

"No."

"Tell me the truth."

He backed her against the wardrobe, his breath warm against her skin.

"Was it... painful back then?" His voice trembled faintly.

"A little," she admitted frankly. "But I also did some meaningful things."

Alexander retreated half a step, stubbornly pressing, "So now, there’s no lingering attachment at all?"

"Pretty much." Evelyn’s voice softened. "Just... be careful with Lydia."

Moonlight bathed Alexander’s profile as he asked hoarsely, "You admit it hurt—does that mean... you loved me once?"
###Chapter 451 Has Anyone Ever Told You You're Heartless?

Evelyn Carter lowered her lashes, veiling the turmoil in her eyes. "I thought this was simple logic."

Alexander Hamilton's breathing visibly quickened. "What exactly are you trying to say?"

"I'm merely stating facts." She met his gaze calmly. "Just as you'd be furious if Emily Zade betrayed Hamilton Group."

"That's completely different!" His fists clenched violently.

"The feeling is the same." Her voice was feather-light.

Alexander's eyes reddened instantly. "Evelyn, let me ask you one more time—if you'd married someone else back then, would you have also—"

"Marital duty. Nothing more." She cut him off.

"Duty?" He let out a bitter laugh. "So everything between us was just obligation to you?"

Moonlight cast a frost-like pallor over her profile.

Alexander's chest heaved before he finally ground out through gritted teeth, "Evelyn Carter, you're utterly heartless."

"You're the first to say that."

He stared at her, throat working, then stormed out, slamming the door with a force that rattled the window frames.

...

In the days that followed, Evelyn remained secluded at home.

Vivian Dempsey's video calls came like clockwork. "Are you really okay alone?"

"I'm not a child." Evelyn sighed.

"But look at those bruises!" Vivian stomped in frustration onscreen. "That bastard went too far!"

Evelyn glanced at the purpling marks on her wrist. "He didn't walk away unscathed either."

The police said the burglar would need three months to recover.

"Serves him right!" Vivian hissed. "Hey, should you get a full checkup at the hospital?"

"Unnecessary. I'm a doctor myself." Evelyn shook her head. "Besides... Anthony Taylor's still hospitalized. I'd rather avoid running into him."

Vivian exhaled heavily. "Has Dr. Wilson visited you?"

"Vivian." Evelyn shot her a warning look.

"Fine, fine, no matchmaking." Vivian raised her hands in surrender. "Good news though—I found an investor!"

Evelyn's eyes brightened. "Really?"

"But I need a tiny favor." Vivian dropped her voice conspiratorially. "The investment bank manager has been struggling with infertility..."

"There are numerous potential causes." Evelyn frowned. "It could be her partner's issue."

"That's why I need your expertise!" Vivian clasped her hands pleadingly. "She'll be at Lydia Laurent's birthday gala this weekend."

Evelyn's fingers curled involuntarily.

Lydia Laurent's birthday party... Alexander would undoubtedly attend.
###Chapter 452: The Privilege of Being Doted On

The line went suddenly silent.

Vivian Dempsey immediately sensed something amiss. "If it's inconvenient for you to go, I can figure out another way—"

"No inconvenience." Evelyn Carter's voice regained its composure, smooth as undisturbed water. "I was just thinking."

"Really?" Vivian sounded skeptical.

"Yes." Evelyn exhaled silently but kept her tone gentle. "Do you have an invitation, though? Can you get me in?"

Vivian relaxed. "Leave it to me! Just rest at home—I'll pick you up when everything's ready!"

——

4:30 PM, Sunday.

Vivian's car pulled up precisely on time. She brought not only two gilded invitations but also two meticulously prepared evening gowns with matching jewelry.

Evelyn frowned slightly at the opulent dresses. "A birthday party requires this much formality?"

Vivian winked mysteriously. "You'll understand when we get there. Lydia Laurent's birthday hasn't been just a celebration for years. I bet nine out of ten attendees tonight have ulterior motives."

She'd chosen a high-necked gown for Evelyn, perfectly concealing the marks on her neck. Delicate bracelets masked the bruises on her wrists.

Evelyn studied her reflection, uneasy. "I prefer my white coat."

"Nonsense!" Vivian's eyes sparkled. "You look like an elite doctor straight off a fashion magazine. This’ll give you an edge when meeting that investment bank manager later."

——

The car soon arrived at the Hamilton Group's most luxurious business hotel.

Vivian lowered her voice. "Rumor has it Alexander Hamilton booked the entire hotel just for Lydia's birthday. Now that’s extravagance."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "That’s typical of him."

Vivian whistled. "How quickly the new love overshadows the old."

"I’m also 'the old,'" Evelyn reminded softly.

Vivian grinned. "You’re the one who got away."

——

The car stopped before a red carpet flanked by imported flowers. Every rose and lily in Hudson seemed to have been purchased for this event.

Black-suited security meticulously checked their invitations before granting entry.

Inside, the hotel was divided into multiple zones, with impeccably trained staff at every turn. A graceful hostess approached. "This way, please. You may wait in the lounge area."

"The event hasn’t started?"

"Not yet. Final preparations are underway."

The grand hall featured lavish buffet tables, a dessert section adorned with balloons and flowers, and—most strikingly—ubiquitous Pokémon motifs. Pikachu prints graced everything from wall decals to napkins.

Vivian murmured as they walked, "Seems Miss Lydia is a die-hard Pokémon fan. Being spoiled shows—even these tiny details are accounted for. Her eighteenth birthday was nothing compared to this."

Evelyn tugged her sleeve. "We’re here on business, remember?"

Vivian reluctantly stopped admiring the decor and began scanning the crowd.

"There she is." Vivian pointed discreetly.

A woman in a crisp white blazer sat focused on her laptop, her sleek updo accentuating her sharp professionalism.

"Sophia Winston from Wild Goose Capital—everyone calls her 'Sophia.'" Vivian whispered. "Address her as 'Ms. Winston' until we’re familiar."

As they approached, Sophia looked up.

"Ms. Dempsey. What a coincidence." Her tone was polite but distant.

Vivian beamed. "Ms. Winston, this is my friend Evelyn Carter—former attending physician at Central Hospital's OB-GYN Department."

Evelyn nodded. "Ms. Winston."

Sophia’s gaze lingered on Evelyn’s face before curving into a knowing smile. "Your name... rings a bell."

"Evelyn. Like the wood," she replied evenly.

Sophia’s lips quirked. "Interesting."
###Chapter 453: Wedding Bells Approaching, But Something's Off

Vivian Dempsey leaned in with a playful grin. "Our Dr. Carter is quite the celebrity in maternity circles. She recently graced the cover of a medical journal."

Sophia Winston's lips curved slightly, a glimmer of understanding flashing in her eyes.

She responded smoothly, "Such remarkable achievements at such a young age. Truly impressive."

Evelyn Carter had never been comfortable with professional flattery.

Fortunately, Vivian was quick on her feet, showering Sophia with equally lavish praise.

Sophia seemed distracted, sipping her champagne absently, not even bothering with a polite smile.

Then Vivian shifted gears. "Dr. Carter has treated numerous infertility cases, with several successful pregnancies."

Sophia's fingers tightened around her glass.

Vivian pressed her advantage. "Ms. Winston, since you're here, why not give it a try? It couldn't hurt."

Sophia's gaze sharpened. "Have you been investigating me?"

"Heavens, no!" Vivian waved her hands dismissively. "Perhaps we should find a quieter spot to talk?"

The three women moved wordlessly to a secluded corner of the ballroom.

Sophia studied Evelyn with a mix of scrutiny and hesitation.

Evelyn met her gaze steadily, waiting.

"Dr. Carter, have we met before?"

"I worked in the OB-GYN department at Central Hospital."

Sophia frowned thoughtfully. "Not at the hospital. You and Alexander Hamilton from Hamilton Group..."

The air turned icy.

"My apologies, that was presumptuous." Sophia gave a light laugh. "Last year at the Cloud Terrace Resort, I saw Mr. Hamilton personally open a car door for you."

Evelyn's fingertips went cold.

That had been her third visit to that hotel.

Sophia's tone turned meaningful. "At the time, I thought we'd soon be celebrating their wedding. Who would've guessed..."

"Alexander Hamilton and I are no longer involved."

"If that's truly the case," Sophia turned to leave, "then Dempsey Group's investment proposal hardly warrants consideration."

Vivian blocked her path in a panic. "Ms. Winston, Dr. Carter's medical skills are exceptional!"

"I've been to every major hospital," Sophia said bitterly. "Even tried folk remedies. Nothing worked."

"But what if there's still hope?"

Sophia's eyes darted between them.

Vivian rushed to assure her, "Regardless of the outcome, we'd never leverage this for investment."

After two agonizing minutes of silence,

Sophia finally spoke. "All my tests show normal results."

"Your husband?"

"He's had full examinations too. All indicators are optimal."

Evelyn frowned. "May I review your test reports?"

"I didn't bring them today. But you should be able to access my medical records at Central Hospital."
###Chapter 454: Alexander Couldn't Possibly Have Such Poor Taste

Sophia Winston's gaze swept over Evelyn Carter with lingering scrutiny. Even after confirming her physician credentials, the wariness in her eyes remained.

Evelyn remained composed. "Please wait a moment."

Professionalism kept Sophia's smile polished. "Of course."

Evelyn dialed Olivia Lightfoot's number openly.

"Dr. Carter!" Olivia's voice bubbled with delight. "How's your injury? The department's been swamped—I haven't had time to check on you."

"Almost healed." Evelyn cut to the chase. "Olivia, do you recall a patient named Sophia Winston from OB-GYN?"

Paper rustled through the receiver. "Yes. Hers was a special case."

After summarizing the situation, Evelyn asked, "Could you send her records? I need the test results for diagnosis."

"Well..." Olivia hesitated. "Hospital policy—"

"I understand." Evelyn handed the phone to Sophia. "Ms. Winston, please verify your identity."

Sophia confirmed her details with Olivia. Moments later, the medical files arrived.

Scanning her own reports, Sophia finally relaxed.

"I knew Alexander couldn't possibly have such poor taste."

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. "Meaning?"

Sophia smirked. "Two Evelyns—same pronunciation, different characters. I met the other one. Truly baffling how Alexander could fancy her. Now I see I mistook you for Annabelle Taylor."

"Perhaps you weren't mistaken originally."

Sophia arched an eyebrow. "They actually—"

Vivian Dempsey interjected smoothly. "Ancient history. He's moved on—no point dredging it up."

Sophia took the cue. "Quite right, Ms. Dempsey. Who can predict how things end?"

The subtext hummed between these sharp minds.

Evelyn understood—Sophia's cooperation stemmed from Alexander Hamilton's influence. More intriguingly, she seemed unimpressed with Lydia Laurent while subtly favoring Evelyn.

Evelyn let it pass, focusing on the reports.

"Ms. Winston, your vitals are normal aside from mild anemia."

Sophia leaned forward. "Will that affect conception?"

"Medically insignificant." Evelyn chose her words carefully. "I suspect immune infertility."

"Explain."

"Simplified? Biological rejection between sperm and egg. Perfect health otherwise, but natural conception becomes difficult."

Sophia paled. "Is this definitive? Any alternatives?"

"Merely a hypothesis." Evelyn softened her tone. "Reproductive immunology tests would confirm. You haven't done those?"

Sophia gave a brittle laugh. "Our schedules rarely align for hospital visits."

"If it is immune infertility..." Evelyn paused. "To conceive, you might need to consider..."

"A different partner?" Sophia finished bluntly. "Ours was an arranged marriage. No deep bonds."

Vivian nudged Evelyn's arm discreetly.

The parallel to Evelyn's own past with Alexander struck her.

"If confirmed..." Evelyn measured each word. "The most straightforward solution would indeed be new partners."

Silence stretched before Sophia spoke. "Last resort. Any other options?"

"IVF is possible, but domestic procedures are grueling—physically and emotionally."

"Low success rates, I hear?"

Evelyn didn't sugarcoat it. "Multiple attempts are typical. The time and energy investment often exceeds expectations."

The banquet's clamor faded around their quiet corner.

Sophia massaged her temples. "I'm at a career crossroads. Can't afford that timeline."

"I understand." Evelyn nodded. "Many professional women face this dilemma. IVF remains a personal choice."

As Sophia sank into thought, two piercing stares found them from across the room.
###Chapter 455: Don't Fall for the Older Man's Tricks

Annabelle Taylor subtly guided Lydia Laurent toward Evelyn Carter while linking arms with her.

"Annabelle, I think Evelyn is busy with something..." Lydia hesitated, slowing her steps.

Annabelle maintained a perfectly poised smile. "Tonight is your special night. Everyone should be coming to greet you."

Lydia nodded blankly.

Evelyn noticed the movement and looked up to see Annabelle leading Lydia over. Her eyes instinctively scanned the room, but Alexander Hamilton was nowhere in sight.

"Manager Winston, it's been a while." Annabelle extended her hand to Sophia Winston.

Sophia frowned slightly before resuming her professional smile. "And you are?"

"Annabelle Taylor, former legal director of Hamilton Group."

Sophia's expression cleared. "Ah, Miss Taylor."

Satisfied, Annabelle nudged Lydia forward half a step. "This is Miss Lydia Laurent. I'm sure you've heard of her."

Lydia gave a timid nod. "Hello, Manager Winston."

"Happy birthday, Miss Laurent." Sophia raised her glass politely but looked apologetic. "Forgive me, I'm trying to conceive and can't drink alcohol."

Vivian Dempsey swiftly handed Lydia a glass of juice.

Lydia's cheeks were already flushed. She pressed a hand to her forehead. "I'm feeling a bit unwell. I should rest for a moment."

Annabelle immediately took her place, engaging Sophia in conversation with the ease of a hostess.

Vivian leaned close to Evelyn's ear. "Since when did this white lotus become a matchmaker?"

"Who knows," Evelyn replied flatly.

Nearby, Lydia steadied herself against the staircase railing. Spotting Evelyn, her eyes brightened. "Evelyn!"

"Happy birthday," Evelyn and Vivian said simultaneously.

Lydia beamed. "Thank you for coming. Annabelle says I need to meet more people so I can help Alexander in the future."

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. "You should discuss that with Alexander first."

"But..." Lydia blinked in confusion. "Annabelle said what happened is in the past, and I should be magnanimous."

Vivian couldn't resist interjecting. "Sweetheart, a man should handle his baggage before marriage. You're young—don't let some older man take advantage of you."

"Alexander is only eight years older!" Lydia protested earnestly. "And he's always been wonderful to me."

"If Alexander Hamilton were reliable, pigs could fly," Vivian scoffed. "His ex-wife thought the same thing."

"Ex-wife?" Lydia's eyes widened. "He was married to Annabelle?"

Vivian realized her slip and opened her mouth to backtrack when a deep male voice cut in:

"Manager Winston, our last collaboration succeeded thanks to your company."

Alexander had appeared behind Lydia without notice, though his gaze remained fixed on Sophia.
###Chapter 456: Stubborn as a Mule

"Mr. Hamilton, you're too kind." Sophia Winston immediately shifted her attention from Annabelle, her face lighting up with a practiced smile as she engaged Alexander in conversation.

Vivian Dempsey inhaled sharply, discreetly stepping half a pace behind Evelyn. Her fingers trembled with unease—she wasn't sure if Alexander had overheard her earlier remarks.

Alexander stood tall in a custom-tailored smoke-gray suit, the impeccable cut accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist. Under the lights, his commanding presence was unmistakable.

"Alexander!" Lydia Laurent tilted her head up, calling his name with sugary sweetness.

He gave a slight nod, his gaze sweeping past Vivian and Evelyn before settling on Sophia. "Ms. Winston, you're acquainted with Ms. Dempsey?"

Sophia reacted swiftly. "We only met recently. I heard the Dempsey Group needed funding, so we chatted briefly. But Dr. Carter here has been most helpful—she answered several professional questions for me."

"Oh?" Alexander arched a brow.

"Dr. Carter is refreshingly direct. Communication with her is remarkably efficient," Sophia added meaningfully.

Alexander swirled his wineglass and clinked it lightly against hers. "She speaks her mind and doesn't bother with pleasantries. If she's offended you, I'll apologize on her behalf." He drained his glass in one go.

Sophia caught the implication immediately. "A professional like Dr. Carter lets her expertise speak for itself. We had a perfectly pleasant discussion."

"Good."

"Though..." Sophia ventured cautiously, "Dr. Carter and Ms. Dempsey seem quite close. She was specifically invited here today by Ms. Dempsey."

A flicker passed through Alexander's eyes. "For funding?"

"Indeed." Sophia chuckled. "Given the Dempsey Group's current situation... I'm curious—why did you choose Banyan Group over them?"

"Business considerations."

"I see."

Alexander continued casually, "Mr. Dempsey is abroad tending to his gravely ill mother and can't manage company affairs. Ms. Dempsey lacks experience and was recently pursued by debt collectors. I don't foresee a promising future for the Dempsey Group."

"Debt collectors?" Sophia's expression shifted abruptly.

"Without a miracle, any investment would be throwing money into a bottomless pit."

Vivian clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. The lifeline she'd painstakingly secured was being severed by Alexander's calculated words.

"Alexander Hamilton!" she hissed through gritted teeth. "Are you doing this out of spite?"

Evelyn gripped her arm. "Don't act rashly."

Vivian's chest heaved, her eyes red-rimmed but powerless to retaliate. Alexander ignored her entirely, handing his empty glass to a passing waiter. "If you can't hold your liquor, don't force it."

Lydia murmured timidly, "I'll learn..."

"Have some backbone," Alexander frowned. "Don't sway with every breeze."

Nearby, Annabelle had gone deathly pale, her fingers twisting violently in her skirt.

Sophia observed the scene with amusement. "You've grown so considerate, Mr. Hamilton. Quite different from your decisive reputation."

"Kindness is wasted," Alexander sneered. "Some people only learn through hardship—stubborn as a mule."

Sophia barely suppressed a laugh. "Sounds like you speak from experience."

"It cost me dearly." Alexander turned to Lydia. "Go keep your friend company."

Annabelle forced a smile. "Alexander, I was just helping Lydia—"

"Meddling."

"My parents don't want to see me right now..."

"Then stop embarrassing yourself."

The air froze. No one dared breathe a word.

Alexander's gaze finally landed on Evelyn. "Excuse me."

As he brushed past her, his cufflink grazed her wrist, leaving behind the faintest trace of icy fragrance.
###Chapter 457: Alexander's Revenge

Lydia Laurent awkwardly rubbed her hands together. "I should go greet my international friends."

She lifted her gown and hurried away.

Only Evelyn Carter, Vivian Dempsey, and the abandoned Annabelle Taylor remained.

Annabelle's face flushed red, then paled, finally turning livid. Her carefully maintained elegant facade shattered completely. She glared at Evelyn with venom. "How dare you show your face here? Lydia didn't invite you! It's too late for regrets now—I'm about to become the next Miss Laurent!"

Evelyn didn't even bother to look up.

"Stop pretending to be noble!" Annabelle trembled with rage. "You—"

"Shut up!" Vivian stormed forward in her ten-centimeter heels. "I've been itching to vent my anger. Say one more word, and I'll rearrange that plastic face of yours."

Annabelle stumbled back two steps but kept glaring at Evelyn.

Vivian stepped between them. "What are you staring at? Alexander Hamilton humiliated you—go take it up with him if you've got the guts!"

"Psycho!" Annabelle spat before fleeing in disgrace.

Vivian rolled her eyes at her retreating figure. "Disgusting!"

The ballroom lights suddenly shifted, bathing everything in dreamy purple hues. The gala was about to begin officially.

Evelyn linked arms with Vivian. "If Manager Sophia's path is blocked, do we have other options? There are more investment banks in Hudson City."

Vivian's shoulders slumped. "We've tried everything. Sophia was our last hope..." Her voice turned furious. "That bastard Alexander! He deliberately sabotaged me in front of everyone!"

"He holds grudges," Evelyn murmured.

"Just because I advised you to divorce him?" Vivian stamped her foot. "That petty man! Acting all composed before—he was just biding his time to retaliate!"

Evelyn patted her hand. "Let's leave first."

They slipped out through a side door into the rear garden.

Vivian kicked off her heels and plopped onto a stone bench. "Evelyn, I'm so sorry for dragging you into this."

"Don't be ridiculous." Evelyn sat beside her.

Vivian gazed up at the stars, her voice suddenly thick. "Why is everything so hard for us..."

Evelyn's heart ached. "How much funding does Dempsey Group need?"

"No!" Vivian straightened abruptly. "We still owe you 1.3 million!"

"I'm just asking."

"Don't even ask!" Vivian grabbed her heels and stood. "I have an idea. Let me try it first."

Evelyn eyed her suspiciously. "What idea?"

"Wait for my update." Vivian had already called a car. "I'll take you home first."

Late at night, the lights were still on in the Anderson residence.

"Dad, Mom, I'm back."

Grace Anderson rushed over in delight, then hurried to fetch a coat. "You're barely dressed—what if you catch a cold?"

"It's a gala." Evelyn smiled, accepting the warm water her father handed her.

On the living room sofa, a calculator weighed down several sheets of paper covered in numbers. Andrew Anderson's handwritten signature and red company seal were faintly visible beneath.
###Chapter 458: Alexander's Lavish Offer

"What's this?"

"Nothing..."

Evelyn snatched the paper before her parents could stop her.

Andrew grabbed it back. "I said it's nothing."

He hastily folded the document twice before shoving it deep into his pants pocket.

But Evelyn had already glimpsed the staggering figure.

"Where did you borrow this from?"

"...An old friend." Andrew waved dismissively. "Stay out of it."

Her voice turned icy. "Which friend casually lends two million? What did you promise in return?"

"I said it's a friend!" Andrew suddenly raised his voice. "This isn't your decision to make!"

He stormed into the bedroom, slamming the door.

Grace patted her daughter's hand. "You know how your father gets..."

"Mom, two million isn't pocket change."

Grace hesitated before leading her into the kitchen.

Behind closed doors, she whispered, "Peter introduced us to someone from the bank's credit department. They offered a low-interest loan..."

Evelyn's alarm bells rang. "Peter Harrison?"

"He seemed reliable—wore a nice suit. Said he was helping a friend meet quotas..."

"Interest rate?"

"0.8‰." Grace gestured. "Much lower than banks."

Evelyn frowned. "Show me the contract."

The bedroom door remained shut.

"Dad!"

Silence.

Grace suddenly remembered. "The digital copy was emailed to Emily."

Evelyn pushed open her sister's door.

Emily jerked away from her computer, hastily closing a document.

"Sis? What—"

Grace looked puzzled. "I thought you were asleep?"

"I was translating academic papers for my advisor..."

Evelyn glanced at the screen—legitimate research.

"Pull up Dad's loan agreement."

Emily obediently opened the email.

Eighty pages of dense legal text filled the screen.

Grace sighed. "Take your time. I'll make noodles."

Evelyn motioned to close the door.

"Sis, is there a problem?"

"Has Peter visited recently?"

"Last week with Mid-Autumn gifts..." Emily froze.

Evelyn smirked.

Since when did unemployed men have corporate benefits?

She knew Hamilton Group's policies—Alexander never bothered with hollow gestures.

Once she'd asked, "Why no mooncakes?"

The man had adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "A thousand in cash versus pastry. Your pick."

The company-wide vote was unanimous—even the janitors chose money.

Alexander had said simply, "Why complicate what money solves."

Emily mumbled, "Peter's been kind..."

"To what end?" Evelyn countered. "Why would he help our family?"

"Maybe—"

"There are no maybes." Evelyn cut her off. "Get me water."

As her sister left, she flipped to the interest clause.

Her pupils contracted at a single line of fine print.
###Chapter 459: You Should've Known My Methods

Not 0.8%, but 8%.

An extra zero after the decimal point—almost imperceptible in the contract. Andrew Anderson's aging eyes couldn't detect such a subtle difference.

Evelyn's fingers trembled.

Peter Harrison had planned this trap all along.

He meticulously designed it, waiting for the Anderson family to fall in.

Sixteen thousand in monthly interest loomed like a mountain.

The Andersons could never shoulder this burden.

With compound interest, the debt would soon become astronomical.

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine.

Thankfully, she'd discovered the contract today.

Any later, and her parents might have been pushed to the brink.

"Sis?" Emily Anderson grasped her hand worriedly.

Evelyn took a deep breath. "I need to make a call."

"It's so late—"

"He owes me an explanation!"

On the balcony, Evelyn dialed Peter's number.

His mocking voice greeted her instantly. "What's wrong? Alexander ignoring you?"

"Are you trying to ruin my family?" she hissed.

"I gave you a chance," Peter chuckled. "You wasted it."

"Come at me directly! Leave my family out of this!"

"I'm helping you," he drawled. "Didn't you want to see Alexander? Now you have a reason. Beg him—maybe rekindle that old flame."

"...You're despicable."

"Just realizing that now?" He laughed. "Don't forget my matchmaker's fee!"

"You think he's my only option?"

"Suit yourself. But remember—five thousand daily interest. Can your father's pension cover that?"

The call ended abruptly.

Evelyn stared at her screen, finger hovering over "Alexander Hamilton."

Finally, she tapped it.

Endless ringing.

No answer.

She tried again. Same result.

Her messages vanished into the void.

It was Lydia Laurent's birthday. Of course he wouldn't spare her a thought.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

Her pulse jumped—until she saw Gregory Wilson's name.

"Evelyn?" Concern laced his voice. "Are you okay?"

"I..." Her throat tightened.

"What happened?"

After a pause, she whispered, "Can you lend me some money?"

"How much?"

"Two million."

Not a second's hesitation. "Send me your account details."

She forwarded an electronic IOU. "I'll repay you as soon as I can."

"The money doesn't matter," Gregory said quietly. "Have you really decided to abandon medicine?"

"Just temporarily." She forced a smile. "Once Anderson Construction stabilizes..."

"Call me anytime you need help."

One minute later, a notification chimed.

Two million deposited.

Clutching her phone, Evelyn gazed at the starless sky.

This battle had only just begun.
###Chapter 460: Empty Promises

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains into the dining room. Evelyn Carter gently slid a bank card across the table to her parents.

"What's this?" Grace Anderson picked up the card with a puzzled expression.

Evelyn took a sip of soy milk. "A loan from Vivian. Two million."

Andrew Anderson immediately set down his chopsticks. "I thought the Dempseys were having financial troubles too?"

"She said it's her personal savings." Evelyn unlocked her phone. "You can call and ask her yourself if you'd like."

Grace quickly intervened. "Vivian is such a good friend. Evelyn, we should invite her over for dinner soon. We need to properly thank her for such generosity."

"She's busy these days." Evelyn picked up a piece of fried egg. "We'll arrange it when things settle down."

Andrew frowned. "This money isn't from Alexander, is it?"

"No." Evelyn's reply was firm.

Seeing her daughter's calm expression, Andrew finally relaxed. "We should still pay interest—standard bank rates."

"Agreed." Evelyn nodded. "Though she might refuse it."

"Whether she accepts is her choice. Offering is our responsibility!"

After breakfast, father and daughter headed straight to the bank. Evelyn watched closely as the teller processed the transaction, only breathing easy when the loan clearance certificate printed out.

By the time they returned home, Grace and Emily Anderson had prepared a full spread of dishes.

"I want to enroll Emily in a summer program," Evelyn suddenly announced. "One of those international university exchange programs."

Grace hesitated. "Shouldn't we focus on repaying the debt first...?"

"It's a rare opportunity." Evelyn placed a spare rib on her sister's plate. "Good for building independence and improving her English."

Emily nibbled her chopsticks. "Sis, isn't it expensive?"

"Just focus on doing well." Evelyn paused. "And remember—don't answer any calls from Peter."

As long as Emily left Hudson City, Peter Harrison could never threaten her again.

When leaving that afternoon, Grace pressed a bundle of homemade pickles into Evelyn's hands. "Come home when you're tired. And eat on time."

Evelyn lowered her head as she accepted it, afraid her parents might see her reddening eyes.

Just as she reached the neighborhood gates, her phone buzzed. A text from Gregory Wilson: 【All settled?】

Evelyn replied: 【Yes. I'll repay you as soon as possible.】

An instant response: 【How about dinner then?】

Evelyn stared at the screen for several seconds before typing: 【You pick the place.】

Her phone rang immediately. Gregory's voice brimmed with excitement. "You're really treating me to dinner?"

"It's the least I can do."

"How about cashing in on that promise you made—homecooked meal by you?"

Evelyn froze. That had been an offhand remark ages ago. She hadn't expected him to remember.

"Alright." She checked the time. "I'll go grocery shopping now."

After hanging up, Evelyn detoured to the supermarket for a live fish. When she returned arms full of groceries, Gregory was already waiting at her doorstep with White Coat in his arms.

"The vet says he's recovering well." Gregory set the puppy down. "Though his fur might take a while to grow back."

White Coat circled Evelyn excitedly, his hind legs showing no signs of injury.

"He needs fish oil supplements." Evelyn scratched behind the dog's ears.

Gregory produced a bottle like magic. "Just happened to buy some."

Evelyn could only offer a quiet thank you.

In the kitchen, Gregory deftly tied on an apron. By the time Evelyn had finished rinsing vegetables, he'd already chopped all the ingredients.

"I was supposed to cook," Evelyn protested.

Gregory waved the knife playfully. "Two cooks work faster. I'm starving."
###Chapter 461: The Unexpected Candlelight Dinner

"Let me handle this."

Evelyn Carter decisively took the spatula, determined not to let Gregory Wilson take over what was supposed to be her dinner party.

The apartment was already small, and the kitchen even more cramped. While one person could move around easily, two made it feel crowded. A slight misstep would lead to an accidental brush against each other.

But Gregory maintained just the right distance, not even letting his sleeve graze her.

Whenever Evelyn finished prepping ingredients, Gregory would promptly hand her the trash bin. Their seamless coordination made cooking together more efficient than working alone.

Just as Evelyn was about to braise the ribs, she realized the cooking wine bottle was empty.

"What's wrong?" Gregory immediately noticed her pause.

Before she could answer, he remembered, "We ran out last time. I'll go buy some!"

He was out the door before the words fully left his mouth.

The convenience store at the entrance of the complex, though small, carried all the daily essentials.

Evelyn continued preparing the sweet and sour fish, only to find the vinegar bottle empty too.

"Dr. Wilson!" She hurried after him, stopping the elevator just before the doors closed. "Bring back some vinegar too."

Gregory smiled and nodded. "Anything else?"

"That's it."

As the elevator doors slid shut, his voice drifted through the gap. "Be right back."

Turning around, Evelyn nearly collided with Alexander Hamilton, who had appeared silently in the hallway.

The man moved like a ghost.

She was about to pretend she hadn't seen him when Lydia Laurent's voice chirped, "Evelyn, you two are so sweet together. That was such a cozy moment."

"You two aren't bad either," Evelyn replied flatly, turning to head back inside.

Alexander suddenly spoke. "What was last night's call about?"

"It's already resolved."

"If something's wrong, say it." His voice darkened.

"Really, it's nothing." Evelyn glanced at the elevator. "Aren't you two heading out?"

Alexander pressed his lips together and fell silent.

Lydia giggled. "We're waiting for takeout. I can't cook, you know."

"Enjoy your wait, then." Evelyn quickly shut the door.

Before long, Gregory returned with a bulging shopping bag.

"The line held me up a bit." A faint sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead. "Did I delay dinner?"

Evelyn watched him unpack. "Why so much stuff?"

Red wine, scented candles, fresh flowers... Gregory grinned. "First time trying your cooking—had to make it special."

"Red wine with Chinese food?"

"Call it innovation." He glanced around. "Got a candle holder?"

"Nope."

He improvised with a coaster instead. By the time Evelyn brought out the sweet and sour fish and braised ribs, the dining table had been transformed.

Roses glistened with dewdrops, candlelight flickered—it was unexpectedly romantic.

"This is too much," Evelyn laughed.

"Only the best for your skills." Gregory picked up a piece of fish. "It's really good."

"Don't force the praise." She took a bite. "Between exams and overtime shifts all these years, edible is already an achievement."

White Coat pawed impatiently at the table leg until Evelyn relented and opened a can for him.

"Thanks for looking after him." She gently stroked the dog's head. "I've been too busy lately."

"Consider this dinner my thank-you." Gregory swirled his wine. "This tastes like juice. Try it."

The doorbell rang abruptly.

"Probably White Coat's toy." Gregory stood to answer it.

But it was Lydia, her face pale, standing outside. "Evelyn! Alexander just collapsed!"
###Chapter 462 Have You Decided to Abandon Me?

Evelyn had just set down her chopsticks when urgent knocking erupted from next door.

"Evelyn! Are you there?" Lydia's voice trembled with panic.

Gregory rose first to answer.

Lydia stood pale-faced, eyes red-rimmed. "Dr. Wilson, Alexander collapsed suddenly!"

Evelyn hurried over. "What happened?"

"I don't know!" Lydia wrung her hands. "One moment he was fine, then he just—"

Evelyn frowned. Alexander had always been robust.

"Where is he now?"

"Next door!" Lydia seized Evelyn's wrist. "Come quickly!"

Gregory's voice turned grave. "I'll go with you."

Lydia pulled Evelyn toward the neighboring apartment.

Alexander's spacious living room flooded with sunlight.

He lay sprawled on the sofa, one arm draped over his eyes, his suit jacket crumpled. Exhaustion radiated from his still form.

"Alexander?"

No response.

Lydia rushed to his side, voice breaking. "I brought Evelyn..."

Finally, he stirred.

Slowly lowering his arm, he revealed a face drained of color.

"Who asked you to call her?" His voice scraped raw. "Leave."

Tears spilled down Lydia's cheeks. "But you're ill—"

"I said no." He pushed upright, jaw clenched. "Make them go."

Gregory stepped forward. "Mr. Hamilton, your health—"

Alexander's gaze flicked between them. A bitter laugh escaped. "Apologies for interrupting your date."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "How do you feel?"

"Not your concern."

"Alexander!" Her composure cracked. "What do you want?"

He leaned back, eyes shut. "For you to leave."

Gregory frowned. "Sudden syncope requires medical—"

"Medical what?" Alexander's eyes flew open. "Advice to step aside?"

Evelyn turned sharply. "Let's go, Dr. Wilson."

A thunderous crash echoed behind them.

Alexander's fist slammed the coffee table. "Evelyn! Are you truly this heartless?!"

She whirled back.

His knuckles blazed red, chest heaving. "Would my death please you?"

Lydia gasped. "Alexander!"

Gregory shielded Evelyn. "Compose yourself."

"Get out!" Alexander swayed to his feet. "This is between us!"

Evelyn shoved past Gregory. "When will this end?"

"Me?" Alexander's stare burned. "You're leaving me to die."

She pointed at liquor bottles. "Hangover and sleep deprivation? Are you five?"

A hollow laugh. "Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?"

Lydia interjected, "He worked all night after—"

"Stop making excuses." Evelyn's voice iced over. "He clearly doesn't care."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Exactly. One less burden."

"Alexander!"

"Weren't you leaving?" He collapsed back onto the sofa. "Door's that way."

Gregory grasped Evelyn's wrist. "We should—"

She shook free. "Last chance. Do you need a doctor?"

Alexander turned away. "Spare me Dr. Wilson's charity."

Gregory smirked. "Anesthesiologists do emergency rotations too."

"How noble." Alexander's tone dripped venom. "Abandoning candlelit dinners for me."

Evelyn snapped. "Fine. Lydia, call if needed."

A heavy thud interrupted her exit.

Lydia screamed.

Alexander had crumpled to the floor, his face ghostly white.
###Chapter 463: Mr. Hamilton, Should I Book You a Gynecology Appointment?

Alexander Hamilton's glare was sharp enough to cut through steel as it landed on Gregory Wilson.

Gregory met his gaze with a faint, knowing smirk.

The air between them turned glacial.

Evelyn Carter felt a cold sweat prickle down her spine.

"Dr. Wilson," Lydia Laurent tilted her head, "isn't anesthesia only for surgeries?"

"It's just a metaphor."

"Oh, I see."

Gregory adjusted his glasses. "Mr. Hamilton, shall we begin the examination?"

Alexander scoffed and slumped onto the couch, his long legs dangling awkwardly over the edge.

"Go ahead, Doctor. Call me when you need the anesthesia."

"Very well."

Gregory took a seat opposite him with practiced ease.

"Evelyn..." Lydia tugged lightly at Evelyn's sleeve.

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn knelt beside the couch. "Where exactly does it hurt?"

"My stomach," Alexander replied without opening his eyes.

"Can you pinpoint the location? Left or right side?"

His eyes snapped open, burning with intensity. "The entire thing hurts."

Evelyn rolled up her sleeves. "Loosen your tie and take off your jacket."

Lydia twisted her fingers anxiously. "Is Alexander seriously ill?"

"I need to perform a physical exam to diagnose the issue."

With one hand, Alexander undid his vest buttons, revealing a crisp white shirt beneath.

"Should I unbutton the shirt too?"

"No. Just lie flat."

"I can't."

"...Fine. Stay like this, then."

Her fingertips pressed lightly against his abdomen. "Does this hurt?"

"Yes."

She moved to another spot. "Here?"

"Painful."

The heat of his skin seeped through the fabric, scorching her fingertips.

Gregory spoke up suddenly. "Any findings?"

"Elevated body temperature, but the cause is unclear." Evelyn withdrew her hand. "The pain is too widespread to localize."

Alexander sneered. "And this is expert-level diagnosis?"

"You claim every spot hurts—how am I supposed to determine anything?"

"It all hurts!"

Evelyn grabbed a tissue to wipe her hands. "If your liver and stomach are both in agony, I suggest calling an ambulance."

"Are you sure it's not your skills that are rusty? Too much time in OB-GYN, forgotten how to do a basic exam?"

Evelyn yanked her sleeves higher. "Fine. Let's try again."

Alexander closed his eyes, the picture of resignation.

"Here?"

"Pain."

"Here?"

"Easy! That hurts!"

Evelyn nodded. "Fallopian tube and uterine region. Possible ovarian cyst rupture or uterine prolapse."

"..."

"Should I book you a gynecology consult?"

Alexander's face darkened. "Is this how you treat patients?"

"Uncooperative patients make diagnosis difficult."

He gritted his teeth. "Fine. I'll cooperate."

"Lie flat. Legs up."

With visible reluctance, he adjusted his position.

"Focus this time. Tell me where it hurts most."

"...Hurry up."

Gregory stood. "Need assistance?"

"Not necessary," Alexander bit out.

Evelyn shook her head. "He’s got enough energy to argue. He’ll live."

Gregory sat back down.

Evelyn resumed the exam. "Here?"

Alexander sucked in a sharp breath. "Very painful."

"Certain?"

"Press elsewhere for comparison."

"..."

"How else will I know which spot hurts more?"

"Fine."

She increased the pressure.

Alexander paled. "Trying to kill me?"

"So it’s excruciating?"

"Yes."

Evelyn stood. "Gastritis flare-up. Lydia, what did he eat today?"

Lydia shook her head. "He only drank at the business dinner. Didn’t touch his food."

Alexander massaged his temples. "There was an emergency in Europe. I handled it and came straight back."

Evelyn frowned. "So you’ve gone two days and a night without eating—just alcohol?"
###Chapter 464: I Want Your Sincerity

Alexander Hamilton's face was as pale as paper.

He slowly straightened up using the armrest for support, his slender fingers methodically fastening each button on his vest.

"Mhm."

His response was barely audible.

Evelyn Carter frowned. "Alcohol irritates the stomach lining more than cold food does."

Lydia Laurent wrung her hands anxiously. "Evelyn, can you help him?"

"I'm an OB-GYN specialist." Evelyn shook her head. "I recommend getting a gastroscopy as soon as possible."

Lydia's eyes lit up. "How did you know Alexander has stomach problems? Did you diagnose it just by checking his pulse?"

The admiration in her gaze made Evelyn's fingers twitch slightly.

"Margaret mentioned it." She brushed it off casually before turning back to Alexander. "Mr. Hamilton, you should go to the hospital for a thorough examination."

Alexander tugged at his tie. "I have an appointment this afternoon."

"Suit yourself." Evelyn turned away. "It's your life."

Lydia grabbed Alexander's sleeve in panic. "Alexander!"

"I have medication at home." He pushed her hand away.

The girl's eyes instantly reddened.

Evelyn paused at the doorway and glanced back. "If the pain becomes unbearable, call an ambulance immediately."

Gregory Wilson had already opened the front door.

"Wait."

Alexander suddenly pushed himself up from the coffee table, sending crystal glasses clinking.

"Didn't Dr. Carter say you and Dr. Wilson are just colleagues?" His gaze pinned Evelyn's retreating figure. "Is a candlelit dinner also within the bounds of professional courtesy?"

Lydia blinked in confusion. "Isn't Dr. Wilson Evelyn's boyfriend?"

"Who told you that?"

"But they—"

Evelyn whirled around. "Since when did Mr. Hamilton switch careers to become a detective?"

Gregory mused, "Mr. Hamilton seems quite interested in my dinner plans with Evelyn."

"Pure coincidence." Evelyn's laugh was icy. "Mr. Hamilton happened to see Gregory setting the table while accompanying Lydia out earlier."

Gregory nodded in realization. "It seems Mr. Hamilton and Miss Laurent are quite close."

"I was speaking to Dr. Carter." Alexander's eyes darkened.

The air froze instantly.

Lydia shrank into the sofa, not daring to breathe.

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed, but in the end, he just stared at Evelyn with burning intensity.

"About Peter Harrison," he said abruptly, "you're just giving up?"

Evelyn's spine stiffened.

"I've begged you many times already."

"So Dr. Wilson is the backup plan?" Alexander's tone dripped with sarcasm. "Did you give him your hotel keycard too?"

"You—"

"This isn't the kind of sincerity I want." Alexander's meaningful glance at Lydia shifted the conversation. "Isn't today the deadline for your housing payment?"

Gregory suddenly chuckled. "No need for your concern, Mr. Hamilton."

"What do you mean?"

"I transferred the money to Evelyn last night."

Alexander's pupils constricted sharply. "You borrowed from him?"

"I'll repay it soon." Evelyn's grip tightened on her bag strap. "I called you last night."

"Because I didn't answer?" Alexander's voice trembled. "You'd rather owe him a favor?"

The crystal chandelier reflected in his eyes like shattered ice.

Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "It was an emergency."

"Hah." Alexander suddenly laughed. "No wonder you cooked for him personally—a thank-you gift."

He yanked off his tie, the expensive silk fluttering to the ground.
###Chapter 465: The Powder Keg Explodes

"Something like that."

Alexander Hamilton clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white, barely containing his fury. "The payment's already settled?"

Evelyn Carter met his gaze steadily. "The paperwork was finalized this morning."

"How much did he borrow from you?"

"Two million."

"Two million..." Alexander's jaw tightened, dark currents swirling in his eyes. "Two million was enough to make you cook for him?"

"Is that a problem?"

"Of course not." His lips curled into a cold smile. "But shouldn't you thank me too, Dr. Carter? For your sake, I handed over our most profitable project to Peter Harrison."

"There's extra food. I can pack some for you."

"My stomach hurts."

Evelyn frowned. "Anger aggravates gastric conditions. You should calm down, Mr. Hamilton."

"My lungs hurt more right now." Alexander didn't back down an inch. "I'm having this meal whether you like it or not."

"What do you want to eat?"

"Seafood."

Gregory Wilson interjected, "Seafood isn't suitable for someone with stomach issues."

Alexander shot him a sidelong glance. "Got an objection, Dr. Wilson?"

"...No."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "We'll discuss it when your stomach's better."

"I want it now."

"Alexander, how old are you?"

"He gets special treatment, but I don't?" Ice formed in Alexander's eyes. "Playing favorites, Dr. Carter?"

"I didn't prepare any seafood today."

"What's in the fridge?"

"Carp."

"Carp counts as seafood?" He emphasized the word with biting sarcasm.

Evelyn nearly laughed at his stubbornness. "Not worried about a perforated ulcer, Mr. Hamilton?"

"Are you cursing me?"

"Medical advice."

The tension between them detonated like gunpowder.

Alexander sneered. "Even if my stomach perforates today, I'm eating seafood."

Gregory's voice turned grave. "There's no need to harm yourself, Mr. Hamilton."

"None of your business."

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Fine. I'll go buy some now."

"Don't bother." Alexander pulled out his phone. "I already ordered. Care to join us, Dr. Wilson?"

Gregory remained expressionless. "Evelyn's cooking is more than enough."

This dinner was doomed from the start.

Evelyn turned to Gregory. "Tonight might not be—"

"I understand." Gregory softened his tone. "You handle this. I'll clean up before I leave."

Alexander's expression darkened further. "How considerate of you, Dr. Wilson."

"You could use some pu-erh tea." Gregory stood abruptly, glancing at Lydia Laurent. "Would you like to join us for dinner, Miss Laurent?"

Lydia hesitated, looking to Alexander for guidance.

"Go ahead." His tone was flat. "With Dr. Carter here, I won't die."

Lydia wavered. "Maybe we could all—"

"We have matters to discuss." Alexander cut her off, his gaze locking onto Evelyn like a predator's.
###Chapter 466: My Efforts Mean Nothing to You

A flicker of disappointment crossed Lydia Laurent's eyes, but she quickly forced a smile. She had always been obedient to Alexander Hamilton. If he said so, there must be a reason.

"Alexander, I'll go with Dr. Wilson first. You and Evelyn can talk."

Alexander gave a faint nod.

Gregory Wilson considerately led Lydia away, offering her a few comforting words before they left.

Once the door closed, only Evelyn Carter and Alexander remained in the room.

The seafood takeout had been ordered, but delivery would take time.

Evelyn knew Gregory had intentionally taken Lydia away to give her and Alexander privacy. But right now, she had no desire to face this explosive man.

Alexander suddenly stood and silently returned to the sofa. A sharp pain pulsed in his stomach—he hadn't noticed it during their argument, but now, in the quiet, it grew more pronounced.

Evelyn pulled a chair from the dining table, deliberately keeping her distance.

Silence stretched between them.

"Why didn't you come to me?" Alexander finally spoke, his voice hoarse. "About your family needing money for the house."

Evelyn scoffed. "You deliberately withdrew from the demolition project and handed it to another company just to cut ties with me. Besides, you're engaged now. What would it look like if I borrowed money from my ex-husband? If my father hadn't been tricked by Peter Harrison into taking out a loan, I wouldn’t have even called you last night."

"I wanted to make things difficult for you," Alexander admitted. "But Evelyn, I don’t understand. I’ve tried so hard to make amends. Why does none of it matter to you?"

"Just consider me heartless." Evelyn turned her face away. "What you want—I can’t give it."

Alexander let out a bitter laugh. "Someone who risked her life to save a pregnant woman during a typhoon, someone who sacrificed everything for her family—how could she be heartless? Or is it just me you’re cold toward?"

"Maybe."

"Last night..." Alexander suddenly asked, "When you couldn’t reach me, you called Gregory instead?"

"Dr. Wilson called to ask for White Coat’s vaccination records and mentioned it in passing."

"White Coat?"

"The little white dog I adopted in the UK."

"You named it?"

"...Dr. Wilson helped."

Alexander snorted.

"After returning, I’ve been too busy, so Dr. Wilson has been taking care of White Coat. When my house was broken into, it injured its right leg, and he took it to the vet." Evelyn’s voice softened. "Honestly, he’s more like its owner now."

Noticing her expression, Alexander’s tone gentled. "Do you like dogs?"

"I didn’t used to. But after... losing the baby, I’ve grown fond of animals."

"If this one has already bonded with him, then it wasn’t meant to be." Alexander suggested, "I’ll take you to pick out a new one someday."

"No need. After taking over Anderson Group, I’ll be even busier. No time to care for one."

"I could keep it for you."

"Hamilton Group is busier than Anderson."

"We could hire someone."

Evelyn shook her head. "Then what’s the point? Pets need companionship."

After a pause, Alexander sighed. "We’ll talk when you have time."

"There are plenty of pet shops. I can get one whenever I want."

Alexander hunched slightly, elbows resting on his knees. "Last night, I was in a video conference and missed your call. It ended at six in the morning. I didn’t want to wake you, so I decided to ask in person."

"No wonder your stomach’s acting up—your schedule’s packed."

Since Lydia’s birthday party, everyone in their circle assumed Banyan Group and Hamilton Group would deepen their collaboration.

"Alexander, I have a question."

"Go ahead."

"Is working with Banyan because of Lydia, or is it purely business? Your partnership with the Dempseys was solid before..."

Alexander’s expression turned serious. "Mrs. Dempsey’s health is failing, and Mr. Dempsey is stretched thin. Dempsey Industries’ product quality has declined these past two years, with defect rates over 15%. No amount of investment can save that."

Evelyn fell into thought.

"You don’t understand," Alexander continued. "Vivian is their only child, spoiled rotten. When her father retires, she’ll either run the company into the ground or hand it to some man to manage. Who’s to say he won’t be another Simon Stapleton or Peter Harrison?"

"......"

"She helped you a lot." Alexander’s voice lowered. "Especially... right after your miscarriage. I haven’t forgotten. Vivian needs to grow up fast, or she’ll have no choices left."

"So cutting off Dempsey’s funding is to force her to mature?"

"Not exactly." Alexander shook his head. "Sophia Winston’s investment bank is about to bring in a new CEO. The entire structure will be overhauled. Promises made now might not hold later. Better to find alternatives early."

Evelyn frowned. "Vivian might not know yet."

Alexander smirked. "Of course she doesn’t. The news is still under wraps. I only found out a few days ago."

"Thank you. I’ll tell her."

"Doesn’t matter." Alexander laughed at himself. "Her hatred for me is already set in stone."

"Vivian is very... decisive in her feelings."

Alexander didn’t respond.

His phone buzzed. Glancing at it, his lips curved slightly.

"Good news?"

"Tell Vivian to head to the airport first thing tomorrow."

"Why?"

"My private jet is coming back. The one I lent out."
###Chapter 467: You're Getting Married Soon - Show Some Restraint

The sofa and chair created a subtle height difference.

Alexander Hamilton stretched his long legs casually, sinking into the plush couch. Evelyn Carter sat on the side chair, which was technically higher, yet their eyes met at the same level due to their height disparity.

"Could you pour me some hot water, Dr. Carter?" Alexander's lips curved slightly.

Evelyn stood and scanned the room. Both the coffee table and dining table were bare.

"Where's your cup?"

"There are disposable paper cups in the cabinet."

She frowned. "You don't even have a proper mug?"

He chuckled. "No magical housekeeper here to stock my kitchen."

Another dig at Gregory Wilson.

"Consider this a gift for Grandma Hamilton's sake." Her voice was flat.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "You don't seem surprised."

"Margaret hasn't managed Hamilton affairs for years. Arranging a private jet last-minute would be impossible." She paused. "I figured it out during dinner at your place."

"When?"

"That evening at Margaret's."

His gaze dropped. "I'm thirsty."

Evelyn stood. "I have hot water next door. Wait here."

The turning lock echoed sharply in the empty hallway.

Her phone screen lit up with a message from Gregory: Emergency came up. Giving Lydia a ride home.

The sight of cold dishes on the dining table drew a quiet sigh from her.

She rummaged through storage and produced a pristine ceramic mug, sterilizing it three times with boiling water.

When she returned, Alexander was curled on the sofa, right hand pressed to his abdomen.

"What took so long?" His voice was strained.

"Sterilization requires time." She handed him the mug. "Still hurting?"

"Better now."

"Where are your meds?"

"..."

"Alexander. Your medication."

"At the office."

Her brow furrowed.

He gave a pained smile. "Rushed back this morning. Forgot them."

"So you've been in pain since yesterday?"

"Too many business dinners lately." His voice was rough. "Drank more than I should."

"Trouble at Hamilton Group?"

"Just didn't feel like coming home." His eyes lifted. "Easier to stay occupied outside."

"I'll get your pills."

His fingers closed around her wrist, cool to the touch.

"Stay." The words were quiet. "We rarely talk anymore."

She pulled free. "You're engaged. Show some restraint."

Alexander laughed humorlessly, draping an arm along the sofa back. "You never minded other women before."

"When I was Mrs. Hamilton, I minded." Her gaze held his. "Very much."

That stormy night, she'd fought desperately to save their marriage.

Something flickered in his eyes. "When I saw you at Celestial Club that night, Vincent said you'd come to catch me cheating... I was almost happy."

"I was looking for Emily."

"I know that now." His mouth twisted. "Even had Sophia play along. You just walked away without looking back."

Evelyn's lashes trembled slightly as she thrust the hot water at him. "Drink it while it's warm."

He drained the cup in one go, studying the puppy design. "Matching set?"

"..."

"This is the men's version."

Only then did she notice the subtle "Gregory" etched on the base.

With sudden childishness, Alexander raised the mug high. "Let's display this prominently. Annoy the hell out of Gregory."

"Grow up." She snatched it back. "This isn't yours."

The mug landed heavily on the coffee table.

"Where's that seafood delivery?"

"Patience." He closed his eyes. "Fresh kills take time."

"We're just waiting?"

"Is the chair uncomfortable?" His eyes flew open. "Join me on the sofa."

Her laugh was cold. "No thanks."

Unfazed, he shut his eyes again.

Evelyn eyed the pristine kitchen. "Do you even have seasonings?"

"Auntie Wu probably stocked basics."

A vibrating phone interrupted.

Alexander glanced at the screen and tossed it aside.

"Lydia?"

"Sophia."

"You two..."

"Friends." He leaned in suddenly. "Jealous?"

She turned away. "Didn't picture you befriending that type."

The heavily made-up Sophia Winston seemed utterly mismatched with Alexander's world.

"People change." His voice held layers. "Like you not caring that I'm getting married."
###Chapter 468: The Fainting Act

"So... you were faking that fainting spell earlier?"

Alexander Hamilton leaned against the sofa, his face still slightly pale. "In the business world, some social obligations are unavoidable. But I've always maintained my integrity—no one dares pressure me into anything."

Evelyn Carter gave a slight nod, uninterested in probing further.

She hadn't pried into his private affairs during their marriage, let alone now.

"Sophia Winston has had it rough," Alexander suddenly remarked. "At least your adoptive parents gave you an education and a chance to change your fate. Many girls aren't even afforded that opportunity."

Evelyn arched a brow. "You two seem close."

"When Annabelle got married abroad, I often talked with Sophia." His gaze held hers steadily. "But we're just friends. Nothing inappropriate."

"You should be telling that to Lydia Laurent."

A flicker of hope crossed his eyes. "That day when you saw Sophia with me, did you—"

"I don’t care." Evelyn cut him off cleanly. "A single man like you having women around is normal. As long as Lydia doesn’t mind."

She deliberately twisted the knife. "When’s the wedding?"

Alexander’s expression darkened instantly.

Ding-dong—

The deliveryman’s voice shattered the tension.

Evelyn accepted the seafood order, surprised to find it fully cooked. "Did the restaurant mess up?"

Alexander evaded. "Maybe."

"Then I don’t need to cook." She turned to leave.

"Wait!" He grabbed the takeout bag. "You promised to make seafood for me."

"Reheating will ruin it."

"Then just plate it."

He dumped the containers onto the dining table. "We’ll eat it like this."

Evelyn sighed. "I don’t eat seafood."

"Keep me company." His eyes narrowed. "You might still need my help with Grandma Duan’s matter."

Reluctantly, she sat down.

The corner of his mouth lifted. "Next time, I’ll let you showcase your skills."

"Auntie Marry cooks better."

"But you promised me."

Evelyn didn’t bother arguing. "Vivian still hasn’t replied."

Alexander stood to fetch disinfectant spray, expertly sanitizing their hands with practiced ease.

"You used to force me to do this. Now it’s a habit." He laughed at himself.

Evelyn stayed silent.

"After the Hamilton Group transition, what’s your plan?" He changed the subject.

"Considering auditing some management courses."

"Textbooks and real-world experience are different." His tone turned serious. "I can help."

She shook her head. "I need time to think."

"Switching from medicine to business does take courage."

As he mentally strategized how to block Gregory Wilson’s interference, Evelyn abruptly derailed his thoughts:

"You sound perfectly healthy now. Stomachache gone?"

Alexander stiffened. "Much better."

Evelyn smirked. "So the fainting was an act?"

"I was genuinely lightheaded earlier." He defended. "I’ve recovered now."

"Ah." Her nod was loaded with meaning. "Then I went easy on you during the exam."

Alexander grimaced. "Thank you for your mercy, Dr. Carter."
###Chapter 469: Turning Hostile Without Warning

"You should get that endoscopy done soon."

Alexander Hamilton tapped his fingers lightly on the desk. "The stomach reacts to emotions. Pain doesn't always mean illness."

"You seemed quite cheerful lately, juggling multiple women."

"Dr. Carter, your words sting."

"They'll sting even more later. Stop coming to see me."

Alexander arched an eyebrow. "Using me and then tossing me aside?"

"When did I ever use you?"

"Grandma Dempsey's matter doesn't count?"

Evelyn Carter fell silent.

He smirked knowingly. "What kind of 'use' did you think I meant?"

This man held grudges like no other.

"Follow the doctor's orders when you go to the hospital."

Alexander nodded.

Evelyn stood up. "I have an online lecture to attend."

"The Architecture Summit is happening in the capital next week," he suddenly said.

Evelyn turned back. "Vivian mentioned it."

"It's top-tier in the industry. Even newcomers can learn a lot."

"I might not understand anything there."

Alexander stirred his coffee leisurely. "The association is hosting it. There's a dedicated networking zone for newcomers."

"You want me to go?"

"Broadening your horizons never hurts."

"I'll check out past summit videos first."

Alexander remained unhurried. "It's invitation-only. No letter, no entry."

"That strict?"

"My seat is in the front row." He lifted his gaze. "Companions get even better seating."

Evelyn grew wary. "I'll decide after watching the videos."

"Something still holding you back?" he countered. "The Dempseys' debts are cleared. The old lady is back."

"Aunt Teresa needs someone to look after her."

Alexander nodded. "I'll visit once things settle down."

......

The next morning, Evalyn pushed open the hospital room door with a bouquet of lilies in hand.

"Evelyn!" Anthony Taylor greeted her with delight.

"How is she...?"

Teresa Taylor lay quietly, her complexion rosier than last time.

"She was so happy when she heard you needed money that she ate a whole apple."

"Apples should be eaten in moderation."

Evelyn arranged the flowers, their fragrance filling the room.

The corners of Teresa's lips lifted slightly.

"The company handover is almost done." Evalyn sat down. "Any advice?"

Anthony beamed. "No one is born knowing everything. Ask anytime you hit a snag. Alexander will help too."

"Do you know about the summit?"

Anthony's eyes lit up. "You're thinking of going?"

"I'm not sure if it's useful. Feels like Alexander's..."

"Like his what?"

"Never mind." Evalyn shook her head. "Is it suitable for newcomers?"

"Absolutely!" Anthony grew animated. "The organizers prioritize nurturing new talent. Alexander has thought this through thoroughly."

He launched into a detailed explanation of the building materials industry.

Evelyn took notes diligently when her phone buzzed.

"Miss Carter, your package will arrive within the hour," came Emily Zade's voice.
###Chapter 470: An Unexpected Flight Companion

Evelyn Carter had just set down her phone when the office door knocked.

"Dr. Carter, there's a package for you."

She accepted the envelope and opened it to find an embossed invitation.

"The medical summit next week?"

Emily Zade's call came right on cue: "Dr. Carter, did you receive the invitation? In previous years, it was always sent directly to Mr. Hamilton. This time I took the liberty of forwarding it to you."

"Thank you, but I'm not at home right now."

"Where are you? I'll arrange for redelivery immediately."

"Central Hospital."

Thirty minutes later, a courier placed the invitation in her hands.

Anthony Taylor smiled knowingly. "Go ahead. I'll take care of your mother here."

Evelyn traced the gilded edges of the invitation, watching the embossed letters glitter in sunlight.

She dialed home.

"Mom, is the house matter settled?"

Grace Anderson's voice was light. "All taken care of. Your father went drinking with his old friends. I'm at Auntie Lucy's place."

Hearing her mother resuming social activities, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

After hanging up, she began packing.

Vivian Dempsey's call interrupted her preparations.

"Grandma's here! Thanks to Aunt Margaret's help—"

"How's Grandma Dempsey's health?"

"Full of energy—already nagging me about marriage again." Vivian groaned before lowering her voice. "But you're right. Hearing her scold me is a blessing."

Evelyn suddenly coughed.

"Are you sick?" Vivian instantly detected the abnormality.

"Just a slight chill. Nothing serious."

Yet that very night, she developed a high fever.

On the flight day, Evelyn wore a mask, her forehead burning.

The check-in attendant handed her a boarding pass. "Have a pleasant journey."

Dizzy, she accepted it—only to spot two familiar figures in the VIP Access lane.

Alexander Hamilton and Lydia Laurent.

Last night's phone call flashed through her mind—

"Should we book tickets together?"

"No need."

She'd deliberately chosen the earliest flight. Yet fate intervened.

The cabin felt stifling and cramped.

Evelyn located her window seat beside a middle-aged businessman.

After takeoff, she requested hot water from a flight attendant to take medicine.

As drowsiness set in, she vaguely heard her neighbor speak.

"Could I get a blanket, please?"

That voice—

Evelyn forced her heavy eyelids open.

Alexander Hamilton, who should've been in First Class, now occupied the seat beside her.
###Chapter 471: Sudden Illness

The flight attendant had long disappeared down the aisle.

When Evelyn Carter opened her eyes, she found herself staring into Alexander Hamilton's deep gaze.

"Had enough?" The corner of his lips curved slightly.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the armrest. "Was that you speaking just now?"

No wonder the voice had sounded so familiar.

"Who else?" Alexander raised an eyebrow. "You still haven't answered me. Do you want a blanket?"

His long legs were cramped in the narrow space, knees bent uncomfortably, like a caged beast forced into confinement.

Evelyn adjusted her mask higher. "I'll wait for the flight attendant."

The attendant soon arrived with a blanket.

Alexander took it and draped it over her without hesitation.

"I don't want yours." She tried to push it away.

"It was always meant for you." His eyes lingered on her flushed nose. "How did you get this sick in just a few days?"

"...An accident."

The warmth of the blanket slowly chased away the chill.

Evelyn studied him. "What brings the esteemed first-class passenger slumming it in economy?"

Alexander chuckled. "What do you think?"

"..."

"What really happened?"

The dark circles under her eyes were impossible to hide, her voice hoarse. "Just a common cold."

His sharp gaze bore into her. "Stayed up preparing summit materials?"

"...Yeah."

A cold laugh escaped him, disbelief evident.

Evelyn pulled the blanket tighter. "Colds follow a cycle. Today's the worst. Tomorrow will be better."

"Risking your life for a summit?" His tone darkened.

"You said it was a rare opportunity."

"I could've waited until you recovered." He frowned. "Why push yourself?"

Her throat burned, making speech painful.

But Alexander wasn't letting her off. "A powerhouse at work, yet can't even take care of yourself."

"Even the strongest get sick."

She closed her eyes, her voice fading. "Go back."

"Back where? Jump out of the plane?"

"First class." She forced her heavy eyelids open. "Lydia's alone there."

Alexander's expression shifted. Seeing her swaying with exhaustion, his voice softened. "She's not a child. Sleep. We land in an hour."

Evelyn was already slipping into unconsciousness.

Alexander quietly lowered the window shade and tucked the blanket around her.

Even in sleep, her brows remained furrowed, like a restless child.

He watched her sleeping face, his gaze gradually softening.

Much more likable asleep.

Awake, she could drive a man to madness.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we will soon begin our descent..."

The announcement jolted Evelyn awake.

She sat up abruptly, instinctively turning to the seat beside her. "You and Lydia go ahead first, I—"

The seat was empty.

A middle-aged man with headphones occupied the neighboring spot, oblivious to her muttering.

Evelyn clutched the blanket.

Not a dream.

He had really been there.

"Here for business too?" The neighbor suddenly removed his headphones. "These days, it's all meetings. I'm practically a permanent flyer."

Evelyn rubbed her aching back. "Yeah."

"Got lucky this time though," the man grinned. "Some young guy from first class insisted on swapping seats. First class is something else."
###Chapter 472: The Obvious Scheme

"Did that passenger mention why he wanted to switch seats?" Evelyn Carter asked softly.

The middle-aged passenger chuckled. "The young man just asked straight out if we could swap. I saw his boarding pass was for first class—if he didn't mind, why should I question it?"

Alexander Hamilton certainly knew how to pick his targets.

Evelyn remained silent until the plane landed. When the cabin doors opened, she deliberately lingered until the end, desperate to avoid any chance encounter.

"Have all the first-class passengers left?" She stopped a flight attendant.

"They've already taken the shuttle bus."

Evelyn exhaled in relief, grateful for once for the inferior treatment of economy class—at least it helped her avoid unwanted company.

She stalled another twenty minutes at baggage claim.

Yet when she finally wheeled her suitcase out of the terminal, that tall, familiar figure still crashed into her vision without warning.

Alexander leaned against a luxury sedan, brow slightly furrowed. Lydia Laurent spotted her first. "Evelyn! What a coincidence!"

"I was in economy," Evelyn forced out as she approached.

Lydia's eyes widened. "Why didn't you say so earlier? Alexander, you didn't even ask if Evelyn wanted to book tickets together!"

Alexander gave her a cool glance. "I'll remember next time."

"But this is perfect timing!" Lydia linked arms with Evelyn excitedly. "My father insisted I attend this summit, but I can't understand any of the finance jargon. Now that you're here, you can keep me company!"

Evelyn managed a strained smile.

"Your voice sounds hoarse," Lydia suddenly observed, leaning closer. "And you're wearing a mask..."

"Flu," Evelyn took half a step back. "Contagious."

Alexander's mouth twitched almost imperceptibly.

Lydia only tightened her grip. "Then you should definitely rest at our hotel! The summit schedule is packed, and the organizer's hotel is so far away..."

"I already called a car." Evelyn waved her phone.

Without warning, Alexander grabbed her luggage and shoved it into the trunk. "Get in," he ordered coldly.

Car horns blared behind them.

Lydia tugged Evelyn toward the vehicle. "Come on, let's go!"

As the sedan merged into the city's glittering skyline, Lydia chattered like a songbird while Alexander sat silent as stone.

The hotel lobby glittered under crystal chandeliers.

"Mr. Hamilton, we're terribly sorry," the receptionist said apologetically, handing over two keycards. "Aside from the two rooms you reserved, we're completely booked."

Evelyn immediately pulled out her phone to search for nearby hotels.

"I can share with Alexander," Lydia suddenly suggested, cheeks pinkening. "Evelyn needs her own room to recover."

Alexander's gaze lingered on Evelyn's face.

"I can find another—"

"This is fine." He cut her off, taking the keycards and striding toward the elevators.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes at his retreating back.

The scheme might as well have been written across his forehead.
###Chapter 473: An Unexplainable Misunderstanding

Evelyn hung her clothes in the wardrobe one by one and adjusted the air conditioner to a warmer setting. Hot water poured from the showerhead, steam quickly fogging up the bathroom glass. She tilted her face up, letting the water wash over her exhausted body.

The doorbell rang abruptly as she was drying her hair.

She tightened the belt of her robe and peered through the peephole to see Alexander Hamilton's tall figure.

"Talk tomorrow," she said, opening the door just a crack.

Alexander's tie hung loosely around his neck. "I need to borrow something."

"You packed three times more luggage than I did."

"Sanitary pads," he muttered, voice barely audible. "For Lydia."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "The front desk offers 24-hour service."

"She doesn’t want outsiders to know." His Adam's apple bobbed. "She’s embarrassed."

"So you want me to go?" She scoffed. "Mr. Hamilton, I still have a fever."

"I’m not asking you to go yourself." He braced a hand against the doorframe. "Just call the front desk in your name."

Evelyn yanked the door open. The damp scent of shampoo filled the air. Alexander’s gaze lingered on her dripping hair for a moment before he deliberately looked away.

When the front desk answered, Evelyn glanced at him for the brand.

"Whatever," he said, unbuttoning his suit jacket as he sat on the sofa.

Ten minutes passed with no doorbell. As Evelyn reached for the phone a third time, she heard steady breathing behind her. Alexander had slumped against the back of the couch, his tie askew over the armrest, still wearing his dress shoes.

On impulse, she leaned closer, catching the faint scent of cedar on him. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, his brow furrowed deeply.

Gathering the outfit she planned to wear tomorrow, Evelyn quietly shut the door behind her.

Lydia answered with red-rimmed eyes.

"Alexander, he—"

"Asleep." Evelyn handed her the sanitary pads. "We’re switching rooms."

Lydia clutched the keycard and scurried away like a startled rabbit.

Evelyn sank into the plush mattress and quickly fell asleep.

Meanwhile, Alexander grasped a hand that reached for his forehead in his sleep. The fingers smelled sickly sweet of hand cream. He frowned instinctively but still pressed the soft skin to his lips.

"Worried about me?"

The palm trembled violently. Alexander’s eyes flew open to meet Lydia’s tear-filled gaze.

"Sorry." He released her hand, his fingertips sticky with residue.

Lydia hid her hands behind her back. "Evelyn said… you were exhausted…"

Alexander loosened his tie with a cold laugh. "How considerate of her."

Moonlight filtered through the sheer curtains, illuminating Lydia’s lower lip, bitten until it bled.

"You… called Evelyn’s name in your sleep…"

Alexander’s hands stilled on his buttons.

The air froze solid.

This misunderstanding—he had no way to explain it.
###Chapter 474: Who Will Yield First

Lydia Laurent propped her chin in her hands, staring unblinkingly at Alexander Hamilton. "Alexander, after all these years, your heart still belongs to her."

Alexander rubbed his temples. "It ended long ago. There's no future between us. I've told you this many times."

"But you call her name in your sleep." Lydia tilted her head. "Though Annabelle is truly remarkable—it's understandable you can't forget her. Maybe... you should stop forcing yourself?"

"What?"

Lydia spoke earnestly. "If you really can't let go of Annabelle, why not reconcile with her? As long as it doesn't affect your partnership with my father."

Alexander's frown deepened.

"Lydia, didn't we agree on this?"

"We did—pretending to be engaged to make Annabelle give up. But now..." She pouted. "I can't tell if you're trying to push her away or get her attention."

"You're mistaken."

"Alexander, when you two were dating, I was still watching cartoons." Lydia counted on her fingers. "At the birthday banquet, Annabelle was clearly furious but still forced herself to smile while introducing me to everyone. The more she did that, the more I felt..."

The eight-year age gap between them felt like an insurmountable chasm.

Lydia had been sheltered her whole life. Attending an all-girls school abroad, she'd rarely interacted with boys. Naive as a blank sheet of paper, her mental age was even younger than her years.

Alexander took a deep breath. "Let's end our agreement here. After returning home, I'll explain everything to your father myself. You won't need to pretend to be my fiancée anymore."

"Alexander..." Lydia bit her lip. "I understand you less and less."

"Just treat this as a vacation." His tone softened. "There are many historical sites in the capital. I'll arrange for someone to show you around."

"Alexander."

"Yes?"

"You're in love with someone." Lydia suddenly leaned closer. "But it's not Annabelle, is it?"

Alexander paused, then smiled. "Correct."

"I knew it!" Her eyes lit up. "You had me pretend to be your fiancée—partly to make Annabelle back off, but also..." She winked mischievously. "To make someone jealous?"

"The first part is right." Alexander shook his head. "The second... she wouldn't care enough to be jealous."

"Have I met her?" Lydia pressed eagerly. "Was she at the birthday banquet? With so many people there..."

Alexander chuckled. "So curious?"

"Of course! Anyone who could make you give up Annabelle—I'd love to meet her!"

"I'll introduce you someday."

"When? I'm returning to England next month."

He ruffled her hair. "Don't ask so many questions, kid."

Lydia huffed, protecting her hairstyle. "I'm an adult!"

"To your father, you'll always be his little princess." Alexander smiled. "He's debating whether to assign you bodyguards—worried it might interfere with your dating life."

"Alexander!" She stomped her foot. "You still haven't answered me!"

Playfully, she poked his chest. "When do I get to meet the woman who stole your heart?"

Alexander caught her mischievous finger. "After I win her over."

"Wow—you haven't even succeeded yet?" Lydia drawled. "Alexander, you're slacking..."

He feigned sternness. "Watch your words."

"What did I say?" She blinked innocently.

Alexander was speechless.

This girl had no idea how provocative her words sounded.

"Get some rest. I'm leaving."

"Where are you going? Didn't you give your room to Annabelle?"

"Never mind."

———

Evelyn Carter had never been particular about beds.

She could sleep in her office during night shifts.

But tonight, she tossed and turned, unable to drift off.

Half-asleep, her phone suddenly vibrated.

Who would call at this hour?

Evelyn grabbed her phone—and her temper flared.

She declined the call immediately.

The caller persisted.

She powered off the phone and tossed it aside.

Finally, silence.

But sleep had fled entirely.

Frustrated, she punched her pillow.

Ring—

The bedside phone jolted her.

Eyes closed, she answered. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, it's me."

Him again?

When the phone failed, he switched to the landline?

Evelyn seethed. "I already gave your girlfriend the sanitary pads!"

"Feeling better?"

"It's 2 AM!"

"Open the door. Let me check on you."

"Not necessary."

"Your voice is still hoarse. Did you take medicine?"

"Yes. Goodbye."

"I'm almost there."

Evelyn hung up.

After a pause, she lifted the receiver and left it off the hook.

That should stop him.

Pulling the covers over her head, she willed herself to sleep.

Five minutes later, the doorbell rang.

Evelyn didn't move.

Let's see who caves first.
###Chapter 475: Relentless Pursuit

The doorbell finally stopped ringing.

Evelyn Carter pricked up her ears, listening intently for movement outside.

"...This is the room. I've been ringing for ages with no answer. Could you open it for me?"

The electronic beep of a keycard sounded abruptly.

Evelyn bolted upright in bed.

"Who's there?!"

"Good evening, madam. I'm the hotel manager. Your boyfriend said you were ill and worried you might have fainted."

A vein throbbed at Evelyn's temple. "I'm fine! I just want to sleep!"

The manager apologized profusely. "Our deepest apologies—"

"Make him leave too."

"Of course."

As the manager turned, Alexander Hamilton's low voice cut through the air. "She's running a high fever. If anything happens to her in your hotel—"

"But we can't force entry, sir."

Alexander knocked directly on the door. "Evelyn, open up. There's been a change in the summit schedule."

"..."

"Evelyn?"

She squeezed her eyes shut.

This man was determined not to let her sleep tonight.

"Wait."

She threw on a robe and shuffled to the door in slippers. "What on earth—"

Before she could finish, Alexander tossed his phone onto the carpet and pushed her back inside.

The door slammed shut.

The world spun as Evelyn's back hit the wall.

Thud—

Her already foggy head swam with dizziness.

"Answering the door dressed like that?" Alexander frowned.

She massaged her temples.

His hand immediately covered hers. "Gently."

"I feel awful." Her voice was hoarse. "Alexander, this is the second time tonight!"

Outside, the manager asked timidly, "Mr. Hamilton, do you need assistance?"

Alexander studied her. "Hospital?"

"No."

He brushed stray hairs from her forehead. "No fever now. What else hurts?"

"My head."

"Sure you don't need a doctor?"

Evelyn knew.

These sudden symptoms pointed squarely to influenza.

That joke at the airport had become prophecy.

"Just need fluids. Hospitals are full of vulnerable people."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "The flu?"

"Yes." She pushed at his chest. "Get out. This room is crawling with virus."

"If I was going to catch it, I already would have."

He called to the hallway, "Manager Wright, we're fine now."

"Very well. Contact reception if you require anything."

Once footsteps faded, Evelyn glared. "Dragging the manager here at this hour. Quite the power move, CEO Hamilton."

Ignoring her, he asked, "Sore throat?"

"...A little."

"Body aches?"

"Mhm."

"Wait here."

He guided her to bed, then turned for the minibar.

At the doorway, hushed whispers reached him.

"...Twice in one night!"

"So she wouldn't answer because she knew he'd come back?"

"That wild?"

"...All the way down her—"

"Shh—"

Alexander yanked the door open.

Two robed young men scrambled into the neighboring room and slammed their door.

Expression icy, he returned to plug in the electric kettle.

Evelyn had cocooned herself in blankets, only her flushed face visible.

Alexander tugged at the covers. "Trying to get heatstroke?"

She clung to the fabric. "When are you leaving?"

"When the water boils."

Relaxing slightly, she slumped against the headboard. "Who was out there?"

"Nobody." He wiped sweat from her brow. "Stop smothering yourself."

"Sweating out a chill helps recovery."

"Whatever Doctor Carter says."

The kettle began bubbling.

Silence stretched between them.

Suddenly Evelyn said, "Lydia Laurent must be waiting."
###Chapter 476: Ninety Pounds of Pure Defiance

"She's asleep." Alexander Hamilton's voice was soft, but his gaze never left Evelyn Carter's face. "Focus on yourself first."

Evelyn truly had no energy to care about anyone else.

"The endoscopy results came back. Two ulcer sites." Alexander suddenly spoke. "The doctor said it's not serious. They've been treated."

Evelyn gave a faint hum and burrowed deeper under the covers.

Alexander noticed immediately. "Cold?"

"I was hot just a moment ago, but now I'm freezing."

He stood and meticulously tucked the edges of the blanket around her. Leaning over her with both hands planted on either side, his entire frame loomed above her. "Better?"

"It's fine." Evelyn pushed at him. "Get up."

Before she could finish, he pinned her down.

Alexander trapped her arms beneath the blanket. "Stop squirming. You'll let the cold air in."

Evelyn felt like a tightly wrapped cocoon, completely immobilized.

"Let go."

"Stop moving."

"...Fine."

Alexander studied her eyes for several seconds, ensuring her compliance before releasing his grip.

The next instant, Evelyn tried to roll away with the blanket.

But Alexander was faster. He hauled her back, half his weight pressing down on her. "Running again?"

"You're crushing me!"

"If I don't hold you down, you'll keep causing trouble." Alexander gritted his teeth. "Are you an eel? Twisting like this—stop it!"

"Alexander, let go!"

His response was to increase the pressure.

"Alex—"

Evelyn suddenly fell silent.

His face was inches away. One more move and they'd touch.

Their breaths mingled. Alexander's shirt had come undone during the struggle, revealing his toned chest. He exhaled heavily. "Still trying to run?"

His warm breath against her ear made Evelyn jerk away.

Mistaking it for defiance, his voice darkened. "Move again. I dare you."

"Why are you so angry?"

"You won't listen." He muttered the complaint but didn't ease his grip. "Behave."

"Alexander!" Evelyn trembled with rage. "Isn't your fiancée feeling unwell too? Go to her!"

"She's much more obedient than you. Eats when told, sleeps when told." Alexander chuckled. "Not like you—ninety pounds of pure defiance."

"Then why are you still here?!"

"I don't want to leave."

Evelyn froze. "What?"

"I said, I don't want to go back."

Perhaps it was the warmth, but Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink, her eyes unusually bright. Alexander found himself momentarily captivated.

"I never should've come to this hotel—"

Her words were cut off as his lips sealed hers.

Evelyn struggled desperately, like a kitten pinned in place.

"Alex—mmph!"

When she finally broke free, she was shaking with anger. "Have you lost your mind?!"

Alexander's eyes darkened. "Not yet." His tone carried implication. "We'll see about tomorrow."

"Alex—"

Another deep kiss.

Evelyn twisted her face away, but Alexander only laughed. "Your neck's quite flexible."

"My nose is stuffed!" She gasped for air. "Are you trying to suffocate me?"

He lifted slightly but didn't retreat.

As Evelyn caught her breath, she hissed, "Your fiancée is right next door!"

"I remember." He kissed her again. "She's on her period. Not convenient."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "You're still continuing?!"

Alexander's smile deepened as he took in her swollen lips.

"Alexander! You said you'd leave when the water boiled!"

"Oh right." He yanked out the plug one-handed and tossed the kettle aside. "Safety first."

"You—bastard!"

"Hmm, tired of that one. Got anything new?"

"Beast!"

"Now that's creative." Alexander trapped her in the confined space, his breathing growing heavier.

"Sophia was right." Flames burned in his eyes. "Reasoning with you is useless. Only force gets a reaction."

"You enjoy being insulted?"

Alexander suddenly frowned. "What's this?"

His hand slipped beneath the blanket.
###Chapter 477 All I Want Is You

Evelyn jerked backward. "What are you doing?"

Alexander pulled a small red card from the bedsheets, no larger than a matchbox.

"What's this?" His brow furrowed.

She shook her head. "I don't know."

"It was in your bed."

"Maybe housekeeping missed it. Left by the last guest."

He held it up to the light. On crimson paper, four lines of calligraphy stood bold and elegant:

May heaven guide you to smooth paths
May fate bring you kind souls
May distant sunshine and glittering lights
Illuminate every tomorrow that awaits you

Evelyn frowned. "What is this?"

"Turn it over." He flipped the card.

She averted her eyes after one glance.

"Gregory's handwriting?"

"I have no idea how it got here."

Alexander rubbed the card between his fingers. "Could've slipped it into your clothes."

"Even if he did, it's just a blessing."

"A blessing?" He snorted, pulling out his phone.

Soon, the room filled with a rock ballad: "Even if you change... You'll always be the girl I adore."

Evelyn: "......"

"Knew it wasn't that simple."

She reached out. "Let me see."

Alexander raised the card high, flicking open his lighter.

"You—"

Flames consumed the red paper.

"Don't toss it. Too many flammable things here."

Suddenly, he clenched his fist, trapping the burning card inside.

Evelyn gasped.

When he reopened his palm, only black ash remained.

"Didn't that burn?" Her voice trembled.

"Used to it." He wiped his hand with a tissue.

"The scars on your back—"

"Want to see?" His fingers moved to unbutton his shirt.

"No!" She grabbed his wrist.

Alexander chuckled, caging her between his arms. "Evelyn, let's start over."

She shook her head. "No."

"I mean it."

"I don't believe you."

His smile turned bitter. "Then use me. Need funds? I'm your ATM. Contacts? Your headhunter. Advice? On call 24/7. Vent at me. Order me around. Even your dog."

"Really? What about breeding him?"

"I can arrange a veterinary—" He froze, pinching her nose. "Getting bold?"

"My nose is stuffy!" She swatted his hand away.

He switched to gently squeezing her cheek. "You've changed so much since we were kids."

"Stop touching me." She twisted away.

Under the dim light, her lashes cast delicate shadows. Without warning, he captured her lips.

"You—"

When he leaned in again, she slapped a hand over her mouth.

His kiss landed on her knuckles instead, beginning a slow exploration. From her hand to each fingertip, his mouth claimed every inch with devastating patience.

"Let go." He sucked her ring finger into his mouth.

"No."

"Then we continue." His lips traveled up her arm, past the elbow, stopping at her shoulder.

Her back grew damp with sweat.

When his mouth found the hollow of her throat, she shuddered violently.

"Keep resisting," he murmured against her ear, "and I won't stop here."

"Alexander..." Her breath hitched. "Your fiancée is waiting."

"She's just a sister."

"First your 'best friend,' then 'sister,' now 'confidante.' You have so many options."

"But none of them are you." His teeth grazed her earlobe. "I only want you."
###Chapter 478: You're Not Entirely Indifferent to Me, Are You?

Alexander's lips crashed against Evelyn's neck with scorching intensity.

She flinched violently, attempting to kick him, but he effortlessly pinned her down. The blanket was tossed aside as his body enveloped hers like an inescapable net.

"Hamilton Group just recovered a final payment—fifty to sixty million," his breath burned against her ear. "No new projects for now."

Evelyn frowned. "What are you implying?"

"Investment banks in H City won't inject funds into the Dempsey family anytime soon." He loomed above her, eyes dark. "Pressing banks for debt repayment is a fatal mistake."

The dim bedside lamp cast their tangled shadows onto the wall.

Suddenly, understanding dawned. "This was your bargaining chip?"

Alexander chuckled low. "Consider it... sincerity."

"Half the amount, then," she countered sharply. "I'll take the money. Not the man."

He arched a brow. "Sincerity isn't negotiable. The money—and me. Or the money—and your heart. Choose."

"...Transfer the funds to Vivian." She gritted her teeth. "Forget my heart. I'll have Olivia bring a scalpel if you insist."

"Evelyn." His fingers gripped her chin. "Stop pretending."

She turned away, lashes trembling. "I don't love you. Truly."

"Mm." Without warning, he closed the distance. "But I love you."

The words struck like thunder, leaving her mind blank.

The sound of his robe hitting the floor echoed in the silence. As the light vanished, the world spun violently.

In the darkness, every sensation amplified.

His skin burned like branding iron against hers. When their lips met, her resisting hands were pressed against his chest—where his heart pounded wildly beneath her palm.

"Alexander!" She gasped. "Are you forcing me?"

He paused fractionally. "You claim not to love me."

"Exactly, I don't—"

"Don't be hasty." His teeth grazed her earlobe, voice rough.

The night became exquisite torment.

With unbearable patience, he unraveled her until she shattered. Only when tears spilled did he finally claim her.

"See?" His whisper ghosted over her damp skin. "You're not unaffected."

"Lies!" She twisted away, only to be dragged back into a searing kiss.

"No love?" His breath hitched as sweat dripped from his jaw. "Then I'll keep going until you do."

Long-denied intimacy made him reckless—yet he remembered every detail that made her tremble.

......

The alarm blared, pulling Evelyn from hazy disbelief.

"What time is it?" Alexander's sleep-roughened voice came from above.

Reality crashed in—the pillow beneath her hips, his body still—

"Lost your mind?" She winced at the soreness.

He laughed darkly. "Just antacids."

"You—!" Her fist struck his shoulder, but he caught her wrist, wrapping it around his neck.

"They say passing a cold to someone else cures it." His lips brushed her inner elbow. "Let me take your fever."

"Superstitious fool." She scoffed.

His palm touched her forehead. "Temperature's down. Can you breathe now?"

Evelyn blinked. Strangely, her nose was clear.

"I need water."

He stilled. "Now?"
###Chapter 479: Are You Hurt?

"It hurts so much!"

His movements abruptly stopped.

Evelyn bit her lip. "I need water. Now."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed as his gaze darkened.

He finally straightened up. "I'll boil some."

Evelyn pulled the blanket tighter around herself, cheeks burning.

She thought she'd have to endure until this round was over.

She didn't expect him to let her off so easily.

Alexander casually picked up the robe from the floor and slipped it on, flicking on the bedside lamp.

The kettle had been filled the night before. He just needed to plug it in.

He walked to the window and yanked open the curtains.

Blinding sunlight flooded in.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut and turned away.

Alexander squinted as he returned, reaching for her blanket.

"What are you doing?!" Evelyn clutched the covers tightly.

"You said it hurts. Let me check if you're injured."

"No need!"

"I've seen everything already. Why be shy?"

"If you're tired of looking, go find someone else!"

Alexander chuckled. "Others don't hurt. And if they do, it's not because of me. Why would I look?"

Evelyn sneered. "I don't believe you never slept with Annabelle."

"She was pregnant then. You think I'm that much of a beast?"

"And I have a fever!"

"Which I just cured." He raised an eyebrow. "Feel your forehead. The fever's gone, isn't it?"

"...Sophistry."

"Call it effective treatment."

Evelyn turned her face away. "So if Annabelle hadn't been pregnant, you would've slept with her?"

Alexander clicked his tongue. "I'm not that desperate."

"The woman you loved for twenty years was right in front of you. You could resist?"

"We were into platonic love back then." He checked his phone. "6:20. The summit starts at 8. If we shower, eat, and head over... Maybe skip the shower?"

Evelyn knew he was changing the subject.

But skipping a shower was out of the question.

Her body was covered in his marks.

He'd taken the robe. The new one was in the closet.

She wrapped herself in the blanket and got out of bed, only for her legs to buckle.

She barely caught herself on the bed frame.

Alexander strolled over. "Need help?"

"Get me a new robe."

"Too far." He picked up his shirt and handed it to her. "Wear this."

Evelyn didn't take it.

"Or don't. I don't mind."

She snatched the shirt and pulled it on, then dashed to the bathroom.

Filling the tub with hot water, she decided to skip breakfast.

A soak would ease the soreness.

Knock knock.

His silhouette appeared against the frosted glass.

"What now?" Her voice was still hoarse.

"Making sure you don't fall asleep." Amusement laced his words. "And don't forget—we leave in an hour."

Evelyn wanted to splash him.

But she could barely lift her arms.

"Got it."

Footsteps retreated, followed by the door closing.

Finally alone.

Evelyn sank into the hot water.

When she emerged, her phone rang again.

Lydia.

"Evelyn, are you coming for breakfast? The century egg and pork congee is almost gone."

"Thanks, but I'll pass."

"Alexander said he was showering in his room after working out last night."

Evelyn gripped her phone. "Is that so?"

Suddenly, noise erupted on the other end.

"Alexander!" Lydia's voice brightened.

His voice came through faintly. "Who are you calling?"

"Evelyn! I asked if she's coming for breakfast."

"She's not."

"Huh? How do you know?"

"She's sick. Needs rest."

Furious, Evelyn hung up and immediately called Alexander.

"Yes?" His voice held laughter.

"Explain things to Lydia properly!"

Alexander suddenly raised his voice. "Lydia—"

"What is it, Alexander?" Her voice grew closer.

"Evelyn asked me to tell you—"

"ALEXANDER!!!" Evelyn roared into the phone.
###Chapter 480: This Man Is a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing!

Lydia Laurent bounced over excitedly. "What did Evelyn say to you?"

Evelyn Carter nearly threw her phone in frustration. "Alexander Hamilton, watch your behavior!"

A low chuckle came through the phone. "Weren't you the one who told me to hurry up?"

"..."

"Don't overthink it. Lydia and I aren't involved like that. I'll explain later."

Evelyn ended the call abruptly.

She never should have made that call in the first place!

Lydia tilted her head. "Alexander, why did Evelyn hang up so suddenly? Is she upset? It's all my fault for making you go find her last night..."

"It's fine," Alexander said, pocketing his phone. "She's not the petty type."

"Then why is she angry?"

He cleared his throat. "Probably had a fight with her husband."

Lydia's eyes widened. "Evelyn is married?!"

"Mm. Was."

"Wow, Evelyn is so mysterious."

Alexander suppressed a smirk. "Let's go eat."

After two steps, he suddenly sneezed.

Though he turned his head and covered his mouth quickly, it still drew attention.

Lydia looked concerned. "Alexander, did you catch a chill at the gym last night?"

"Maybe a slight cold," he said, a faint smile touching his eyes as he recalled last night's intimacy. "Flu season's been bad lately."

The excuse worked on the guileless Lydia.

After lunch, as they waited in the lobby, Evelyn rushed out of the elevator.

Her hair was hastily tied back, and she carried only her purse.

Lydia beamed. "Evelyn, you're feeling better?"

The hot bath had indeed helped.

"Yes, much better. Didn't you say we're short on time? Let's go."

Lydia clapped her hands. "Rest is the best cure for a cold. You must have slept well last night."

"...Well enough."

Evelyn pointedly ignored Alexander standing nearby.

Lydia linked arms with her as they headed out. "The driver isn't here yet."

Alexander strode forward. "No need to wait. I'll drive."

When they got in the car, Lydia pulled Evelyn into the backseat.

The front passenger seat remained conspicuously empty.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Alexander glanced at her through the rearview mirror, lips quirking. "How was your rest, Ms. Carter? Sorry for the room change last night."

Evelyn suspected the "delayed driver" was his doing.

"Thanks to you, Mr. Hamilton, it was adequate."

"Glad to hear it." He continued smoothly, "Any plans for the summit?"

His overly polite "Ms. Carter" act was grating.

Evelyn gritted her teeth.

This man was a complete wolf in sheep's clothing!

"Just observing and learning. It's my first time."

Alexander nodded. "Feel free to ask if you have questions."

"Best to keep a low profile. Wouldn't want to embarrass you."

"You can ask me privately too."

"...We'll see."

Lydia suddenly leaned toward Alexander and sniffed.

Evelyn's pulse spiked. "Looking for something, Lydia?"

"Oh no," Lydia said sheepishly. "I just caught a familiar scent."

"A scent?"

"Not quite perfume—kind of musky and sweet..." Lydia frowned. "Alexander, are you wearing cologne?"

Evelyn's heart raced.

They'd both showered. How was Lydia's nose this sharp?

Alexander remained unruffled. "No. Might be leftover from my clothes."

Lydia shook her head. "This definitely isn't store-bought perfume. I know my scents."

Evelyn turned to stare out the window.

He'd dug this hole himself.

Alexander adjusted his grip on the wheel. "A perfumer friend enjoys making custom blends as gifts."

"Oh!"

Lydia's face lit up with understanding. "Was it Sophia? She loves that kind of thing."

"No," he said, meeting Evelyn's eyes meaningfully in the mirror. "A male friend."
###Chapter 481: Afternoon Delight

"Alexander, you actually know a perfumer?"

"...Yes."

"Can you introduce me? I'm really interested in perfumes!"

Alexander Hamilton's lips curved slightly. "Curious again?"

"Mhm!"

"Alright, I'll ask when there's a chance."

"Is he very introverted?"

"...Yes."

"That's okay! Didn't you say you'd introduce me to the person you love? Bring him along too—the more, the merrier."

Evelyn Carter's heart skipped a beat.

"The person you love?"

Lydia Laurent blinked her large eyes. "Yeah, there's someone really special in Alexander's heart. And no, it's not Annabelle."

Evelyn froze. "But I thought you two were..."

"Just acting," Lydia waved her hand dismissively. "Alexander didn't even fall for someone as perfect as Annabelle. How could he like me? We're just playing along for our families."

A strange feeling stirred in Evelyn's chest.

"You're amazing," she said earnestly. "You're no less than anyone."

Lydia's eyes reddened slightly. "You're so kind, Evelyn. But Annabelle was truly flawless. Back then, the line of guys chasing her stretched from the lecture hall all the way to the school gates!"

Ahem. Alexander cut in, "No need to bring up the past."

Evelyn glanced up and met his gaze in the rearview mirror.

Last night's intimacy had emboldened her. She glared back without hesitation.

Alexander only smiled.

Lydia stuck out her tongue. "Sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned it."

Evelyn softened her voice. "Every girl is unique. What others see as perfection might just be..."

She paused.

"...an ordinary person."

Lydia looked at her, confused.

"You're kind, thoughtful, nurturing, and talented at art—those are your strengths." Evelyn adjusted Lydia's bow. "Believe you deserve the best."

Tears welled in Lydia's eyes. "Evelyn..."

"So stop comparing yourself to others, okay?"

"But my grades are terrible..."

"You have a gift for painting."

"You've never even seen my work..."

"Intuition." Evelyn smiled. "Artists have pure hearts. Like yours."

Lydia threw herself into Evelyn's arms. "You're the best!"

Evelyn patted her back gently, catching Alexander's amused gaze in the mirror.

"You remind me of a mom," Lydia murmured.

"...What?"

"Just so warm. Makes me want to cling to you."

Evelyn chuckled. "Must be professional instinct."

"Evelyn."

"Yes?"

"Your kids must be really happy."

The air turned brittle.

Evelyn slowly released her. "I... wasn't a good mother."

"Why?"

"I was selfish." Her voice tightened. "I gave her up for my own sake."

Lydia looked bewildered. "You have a child?"

"No."

"Then..."

"It's over." Evelyn took a deep breath.

A sudden, sharp honk shattered the moment.

Alexander apologized, "Accidental."

Lydia sat up properly. After a pause, she whispered, "Alexander, this perfume smells unique. I'll tell Sophia about it next time."

"Sophia?" Evelyn frowned.

"Sophia Winston from Celestial Club," Lydia gushed. "She's incredible!"

Alexander explained, "The one from last time who—"

"—wanted to stargaze with you?" Evelyn's tone turned icy.

Alexander fell silent.

"I'm nothing like her," Evelyn said coolly.

At least she was a legitimate doctor.

Lydia continued praising, "Sophia's gorgeous, brilliant, and sings like an angel!"

Evelyn responded flatly, "Oh."

"Alexander, does this perfume have a name?"

"It does."

"What is it?"

Alexander hesitated. "Afternoon Delight."

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Was he insane?

She shot him a warning look. "Don't be ridiculous!"

Lydia gasped. "But that's already a perfume's name!"

Evelyn blinked. "That's a real thing?"

"Yep! There are versions for men and women—mixing them creates a new scent." Lydia tilted her head. "Though I still prefer Super Cedar."

Evelyn was speechless.

Turns out, she was the prude here.
###Chapter 482: Tactical Mind Games

The conference center buzzed with activity outside.

Alexander Hamilton's black Maybach glided into the VIP parking zone, where an attendant hurried forward to greet him.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Hamilton." The attendant's eyes lit up as he accepted the gilded invitation. "Your seat is in the front row of the Platinum Section. Let me escort you."

Alexander raised a hand to pause him.

He circled to the rear door and opened it with practiced grace, shielding the frame with his palm. "We're here."

Lydia Laurent hopped out like an excited sparrow, turning back to call, "Come on, Evelyn! Hurry up!"

Evelyn Carter shifted toward the exit, carefully angling her body to avoid contact with Alexander.

The moment her heels touched pavement, a sharp ache shot through her calves.

Alexander steadied her wobbling frame instantly. "Careful."

Lydia was too busy scanning their surroundings to notice.

But the attendant observed everything, his smile turning knowing.

Evelyn withdrew her arm swiftly. "Thank you, Mr. Hamilton."

She clenched her teeth through the pain, putting deliberate distance between them. "My apologies for the inconvenience."

Alexander glanced at the attendant, his tone neutral. "No trouble at all. Lydia—"

"Coming!"

The attendant lifted his walkie-talkie. "Mr. Hamilton has two guests. Please arrange seating accordingly."

Evelyn used the moment to survey the scene.

The main entrance swarmed with attendees as security directed foot traffic. Yet their guide led the opposite way.

"This way, please."

Alexander noticed her hesitation. "Something wrong?"

Evelyn pointed toward the crowd. "Isn't the entrance over there?"

"That's for the General Section," the attendant explained. "Mr. Hamilton's seats are in the Platinum Section. This is the exclusive access route."

Evelyn retrieved her invitation from her purse.

The silver-embossed "General Section" gleamed under the sunlight.

Alexander subtly positioned himself between her and the attendant, his voice dropping. "Problem?"

"...Stay away from me."

"Discarding me after use?" His brow arched.

Evelyn glared. "Can't you think about anything besides that?"

"The halftime break was too long. I'm strategizing for the second half." His lips curved suggestively.

"There won't be a second half."

Alexander crossed his arms, looking down at her. "So I'm just a tool to you now?"

"Your words, not mine."

"Tch..." He chuckled unexpectedly. "Fine."

"You should go in."

"Not joining me?"

"I'm in the General Section."

Evelyn showed her invitation to the attendant. "I'm not with Mr. Hamilton. The General Section is that way, correct?"

She turned back to Alexander. "Thanks for the ride. Excuse me."

Her skirt flared sharply as she pivoted.

Alexander's half-extended hand stilled midair before retreating.

"Alex, why isn't Evelyn coming with us?"

"She has other plans." His gaze followed her retreating figure as he murmured, "Rabbits bolt if you chase too hard."

The General Section security line snaked across the plaza.

After check-in, Evelyn was guided to a center seat in the second row—clearly upgraded due to Hamilton Group influence.

The front row brimmed with young elites radiating ambition.

Once the summit began, Evelyn recorded key segments. Vivian Dempsey responded immediately: [Holy shit! These material specs are insane!]

When the engineer Liam Macmillan took the stage, his stand-up comedy delivery on drainage systems had the audience roaring.

"That's the genius Hamilton Group poached at a seven-figure salary," whispered her seatmate, flashing a hand signal.

Evelyn's gaze drifted toward the Platinum Section.

Under cascading chandeliers, Alexander's profile stood in sharp relief. As if sensing her, he turned and locked eyes across the crowd.

He raised his champagne flute in a silent toast.
###Chapter 483 His Personal Matters

Evelyn froze momentarily.

The female journalist beside her leaned in and whispered, "I heard Mr. Hamilton offered Dr. Macmillan an annual salary of this much!" She made an exaggerated gesture. "For someone fresh out of school, that's almost on par with a department head."

"The Hamilton Group has always valued talent," Evelyn replied calmly.

"But isn't that too risky? What if his research fails? A ten-year contract—over fifty million down the drain."

The corner of Evelyn's lips lifted slightly. "If he delivers results after the three-year trial period, the remaining seven years will be pure profit. Even if he fails, it's a drop in the bucket for the Hamiltons. But if a competitor snatches him away..."

"Oh my god!" the journalist gasped. "You sound exactly like Mr. Hamilton in that financial interview!"

Evelyn's fingers stilled.

Pure coincidence.

"Which media outlet are you with?"

"Anderson Environmental."

"No wonder. You're practically part of the Hamilton Group."

"Anderson operates independently now."

"Really? I haven't seen any reports—"

Thunderous applause erupted.

The young scholar on stage concluded his speech to enthusiastic acclaim. The host took the microphone. "Dr. Macmillan's insights have clearly resonated. Next, we welcome Mr. Alexander Hamilton of the Hamilton Group for his address."

The applause swelled.

Evelyn frowned.

He was scheduled to speak today?

Then last night...

"Mr. Hamilton?"

The host called several times, the spotlight hovering over the empty seat in the front row of the Platinum Section. Lydia Laurent was speaking urgently with a staff member, her expression tense.

"Mr. Hamilton is dealing with an urgent matter. He'll arrive shortly," the staff member whispered to the host.

The host checked his watch with a frown. "It's already an hour past—"

"Mr. Hamilton is here!"

A stir rippled through the General Section entrance.

Alexander Hamilton strode in briskly, his suit jacket draped over his arm, a faint sheen of sweat at his temples. His gaze locked onto Evelyn instantly.

Every eye in the room followed his line of sight. Evelyn lowered her head to avoid it.

"My apologies, everyone." Alexander took the microphone but first approached the audience. He handed a brown paper bag to a guest at the edge. "Please pass this to the lady in the white coat."

The bag traveled through a dozen hands before landing on Evelyn's lap.

The warmth against her fingertips made her flinch.

Alexander had already turned and mounted the stage, the spotlight gilding his profile. "Personal matters delayed me. My sincerest apologies."

The host chuckled diplomatically. "Mr. Hamilton is a busy man."

"With so many industry leaders here, I'll keep this brief." Alexander loosened his tie. "The Hamilton Group's talent strategy in recent years..."

Whispers spread like waves.

"Mr. Hamilton hasn't attended this summit in five years. Is he here just to endorse Dr. Macmillan?"

"What's in that paper bag? Important enough for him to deliver it personally?"

"Who's the woman in white?"

The journalist beside Evelyn came to her rescue. "From Anderson Environmental—technically a Hamilton affiliate."

The crowd nodded in understanding.

"Then why isn't she in the Platinum Section?" The journalist shot her a curious look.

"My assigned seat was here," Evelyn said, clutching the bag.

"Did Mr. Hamilton give you confidential documents?" someone asked, peering over. "Sorry, I shouldn't pry—"

Evelyn shook her head.

A faint aroma wafted from the bag.

She gave it a discreet squeeze.

Steamed buns. Still warm.
###Chapter 484: Need Me to Fetch You Personally?

The summit buzzed with activity. Evelyn Carter clutched the brown paper bag in her hands.

She pressed the opening tightly, afraid the aroma would escape.

Alexander Hamilton's speech barely registered in her mind.

Only when thunderous applause erupted did she snap back to reality.

The host took the microphone. "Thank you for that brilliant presentation, Mr. Hamilton. Next—"

"Thirty-minute break," Alexander interrupted abruptly.

The host blinked, then caught on. "Everyone may take a short recess. We'll resume in half an hour."

The venue immediately came alive with chatter.

Attendees rose to mingle.

The girl beside her leaned over. "I'm heading to the restroom. Coming?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No, thanks."

"Know any quiet spots around here?"

The girl pouted. "With this crowd? Everywhere's noisy. The restroom line's probably insane."

Her phone vibrated.

[Alexander: Third door on the right after B Section exit]

She sent a question mark in reply.

[Alexander: Bring the package]

Evelyn locked her screen without responding.

Another vibration.

[Alexander: Should I come get you myself?]

She inhaled deeply and grabbed the bag.

As she reached the door, a hand tapped her shoulder.

"Oh, it's you!"

The same seatmate.

"What are you doing here?"

The door swung open.

Alexander frowned. "What took so long?"

The girl immediately straightened. "Mr. Hamilton."

He nodded, then turned to Evelyn. "Inside."

Evelyn lifted the bag. "Delivering something for Mr. Hamilton."

The lock clicked behind them.

The lounge featured a spacious sofa and wall-mounted display screens.

"Eat," he urged, guiding her onto the couch. "I ran quite a distance for these."

"Where's Lydia?"

"She found the summit dull. Went exploring."

When she hesitated, Alexander unwrapped the bag himself.

"Few breakfast places nearby. This bun shop had the longest queue—must be decent."

The steamed buns had thin wrappers bursting with piping hot filling.

"Got soybean milk too."

He unscrewed the lid and set it before her.

"Plenty of time. Thirty minutes."

Small bites gradually warmed her stomach.

"How far did you go?"

"Morning gridlock. Had to run."

Now she understood why he'd been panting earlier.

The round trip must've taken over half an hour.

"...Thanks."

"How will you thank me?" His brow arched.

Seeing her wariness, he chuckled. "Relax. No afterparty plans."

Fifteen minutes remained after the meal.

"Take off your shoes. Rest a bit," he suggested.

"No need. I'll send Vivian my notes."

He knelt suddenly, one hand encircling her ankle while the other removed her heels.

"What are you—"

"What could happen in fifteen minutes?"

His thumb pressed into her calf with precise pressure.

Tears welled as pain shot through her. "Too much! Stop!"

"Bear with it. Needs kneading out."

"Really unnecessary—"

His hands continued their work as she blinked back tears.

With people passing outside, she bit back any sounds.

"Enough?"

Seeing her genuine distress, he finally relented.

"Can you walk?"

"Yes," she said, slipping her shoes back on. "I stand for hours during surgeries."

Rising, she found the ache had lessened.

Apparently he'd actually studied massage techniques.

For Annabelle's sake.

"I'll leave first. Wait before exiting."

She slipped out and hurried back to her seat.

The Platinum Section seats remained empty.

"Your eyes are red," her seatmate noted. "Did Mr. Hamilton scold you?"
###Chapter 485: Bosses Are All the Same

A girl leaned in and whispered, "I heard Mr. Hamilton is extremely strict. But let's be honest, all bosses are cut from the same cloth. Don't take it to heart. Here's a stress-relief trick—draw a little stick figure and poke it with a pin! Works like a charm."

Evelyn felt a flicker of warmth. "Thanks."

"No need! We're all in the same boat. By the way, which room are you in? I'll drop by tonight, and we can vent about those heartless bosses together!"

Evelyn shook her head slightly. "I might have work tonight."

"Seriously? Even on a business trip? Hamilton Group really is brutal."

Evelyn smiled without responding.

The venue suddenly fell silent.

Alexander Hamilton entered alone, striding straight to the Platinum Section. The moment he took his seat, the atmosphere in the room shifted.

Evelyn straightened up, diligently jotting down key points from the industry leaders' speeches.

The summit lasted until dusk.

As Evelyn stepped out, she spotted Lydia Laurent chattering animatedly around Alexander.

"Evelyn!"

Alexander pulled open the car door. "Get in."

Lydia blinked. "Are we staying at the same hotel as last night?"

"Yes."

"Please tell me you're not spending another night at the gym. Should we switch hotels?"

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted. "We'll see."

Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that his smile held hidden meaning.

She stayed silent, closing her eyes the moment she got in the car.

Lydia bubbled with excitement. "The Summer Palace was packed, but the scenery was breathtaking—"

"Lydia." Alexander cut her off. "Lower your voice."

Lydia immediately clapped a hand over her mouth, glancing at Evelyn. "Is Evelyn asleep?"

"Let her rest."

The car fell quiet.

Evelyn wasn't actually asleep. She'd barely gotten any rest the night before. Exhaustion weighed on her, but sleep remained elusive.

Lydia gently tugged her sleeve. "Evelyn, are you awake?"

"Yes."

"Last night was so rushed—I never got to thank you." Lydia's cheeks pinked. "If you hadn't called for... supplies, I'd still be trapped in that bathroom."

Evelyn opened her eyes. "It's a natural bodily function. Nothing to be embarrassed about."

Lydia twisted her fingers. "But... back in school, boys would make a scene whenever girls carried those."

"Even abroad?"

"Yeah."

Evelyn met her gaze firmly. "Ignore them. Next time, ask the hotel front desk or any female staff for help."

Lydia mumbled, "Having a boyfriend would make things easier... Evelyn, has yours ever bought them for you?"

"I don't have a boyfriend."

"Then... your husband?"

Evelyn's head snapped toward Alexander.

Through the rearview mirror, he cleared his throat. "Lydia asked before. I gave her the basics."

"What exactly did you say?"

"Just that you'd been married. Nothing else."

Lydia chirped, "Someone as wonderful as you will find an even better match!"

Evelyn had no response.

"Oh! That handsome guy I met at your place—he's pursuing you, right? He seemed so thoughtful, bringing all those gifts..."

A memory surfaced. Evelyn's voice softened. "...He did buy them for me once."
###Chapter 486: You Seem So Disappointed in Men

A glint of cold light flashed in the rearview mirror.

The car jolted violently, tires screeching against the pavement. Evelyn Carter and Lydia Laurent were thrown forward abruptly.

Evelyn's elbow slammed into the front seat with a sharp pain that made her gasp.

Lydia gripped the armrest so tightly her knuckles turned white.

Alexander Hamilton's veins bulged on the back of his hand, his voice icy. "Dogs."

Outside the window, the road was empty—not even a fallen leaf in sight.

Evelyn rubbed her reddened elbow. "How compassionate of you, Mr. Hamilton."

Lydia chimed in innocently, "Alexander has always been kind."

"Kind?" Evelyn chuckled softly. "That depends on who you ask."

Lydia tilted her head. "Evelyn, did your ex-husband break your heart?"

The temperature in the car plummeted.

Alexander's fingers whitened around the steering wheel.

"Something like that," Evelyn murmured, gazing at the passing scenery.

Lydia leaned closer. "They say the best way to get over someone is to find someone new. That doctor—Gregory—seemed really sweet on you."

"Love isn't a replacement."

Alexander's breathing grew noticeably heavier.

Lydia prattled on, "If only all love stories could be like fairy tales—"

"Fairy tales are lies," Evelyn cut her off. "And marriage is no fairy tale."

"But when you two first got married—"

"We met through an arranged introduction." Evelyn's tone was flat, as if discussing the weather.

Silence swallowed the car.

Even their breaths sounded too loud.

"But... surely feelings developed later?" Lydia ventured cautiously.

Evelyn paused. "There are many kinds of feelings."

"But how can a marriage last without love?"

"Last?" Evelyn laughed suddenly. "A lifetime of self-deception isn't worth it. Better to end it cleanly."

Alexander slammed on the brakes.

Tires screamed.

"I'm getting cigarettes." He threw the door open and stalked off.

When he returned, the scent of tobacco and the chill of late autumn clung to him.

The hotel lobby blazed with light.

"You two go ahead," Alexander said without turning, striding toward the front desk.

Evelyn dragged her exhausted body into the elevator. By the time the ninth-floor light blinked on, her legs nearly gave out.

The room was warm, yet she shivered uncontrollably.

The moment her knees touched the bed, dizziness overwhelmed her.

The lock beeped.

Alexander stood in the doorway, cold air swirling around him.

"Get out." Her voice was hoarse, unfamiliar.

He crossed the room in three strides, pressing a hand to her forehead.

"Don't touch me!" She struggled weakly.

His grip was iron. "You're burning up."

"Not your concern—"

Before she could finish, he scooped her into his arms.

"Put me down!"

"Hospital." His voice brooked no argument.

Her vision darkened. All she smelled was that familiar blend of tobacco and winter.

Somewhere in the haze, she remembered another time she'd been carried like this.

Back then, he'd smelled like warm sunlight.
###Chapter 487: Must I Explain My Relationship Status?

Evelyn Carter felt the world spinning around her.

She forced her eyes open, Alexander Hamilton's face swimming in her blurred vision.

"Can you stand?"

She shook her head, pressing her burning forehead into his palm. His brows furrowed at the feverish heat.

In the next moment, she was wrapped in his warm coat and lifted off the ground.

The night wind slapped her face. Instinctively, she burrowed deeper into his chest.

"Mr. Hamilton."

Leonard Laurent stood at the hotel entrance, his gaze darting between them.

"Is Lydia feeling unwell?"

Alexander angled his body away from the outstretched hand. "Not Lydia."

Only then did Leonard recognize the woman in his arms—her hair loosely tied, cheeks flushed with fever, body limp against Alexander's shoulder.

"Who is—"

"Excuse me."

Alexander strode past him. Leonard hurried after them. "Do you need help? My driver's nearby."

"No."

Leonard persisted. "This lady is—"

"Mine."

The single word froze Leonard in place.

Alexander reached the car. "Open the passenger side."

Fumbling, Leonard pulled the door open, watching as Alexander settled her inside with the care reserved for fragile porcelain.

Evelyn weakly clutched his collar. "Where—"

"Hospital." He pried her fingers loose. "Stay still."

Spotting Leonard nearby, she jolted slightly awake. "Mr. Hamilton... my apologies for troubling you."

Her voice was raw and broken.

Alexander scoffed. "Now you play the stranger?"

Her eyes flashed a warning.

"Mr. Laurent," Alexander shut the car door, "we'll reschedule our meeting."

Leonard hesitated. "This lady seems familiar—"

"Light's green."

The black sedan sped away.

Silence filled the car, broken only by labored breathing.

Curled in the seat, Evelyn suddenly spoke. "You should've put me in the back."

"Why?"

"The front seat..." She paused. "Lydia might mind."

Alexander slammed the brakes.

"Evelyn," he ground out, "has the fever fried your brain?"

She turned to the window. "Just reminding you of boundaries."

"There's nothing between Lydia and me!"

"But others think otherwise." Her voice grew faint. "That was Lydia's father, wasn't it?"

Alexander restarted the car. "So you'd rather suffer than drop the act?"

"It's basic courtesy—"

A coughing fit cut her off.

Alexander's face darkened. He floored the accelerator.

"Hold on. The hospital's close."

Evelyn shook her head weakly. "Not emergency... pulmonary department..."

"You're choosing specialties now?"

"I'm a doctor... I know..."

Her words dissolved into whimpers.

Alexander grasped her icy hand. "Stop talking."

In the rearview mirror, Leonard had long disappeared.

Yet Evelyn knew—some doors, once opened, could never be closed again.
###Chapter 488: Soft Where Needed, Firm Where Required

Evelyn didn't respond.

Her breathing grew steady as her eyelids fluttered shut. She leaned back unconsciously, sinking into the plush chair.

The movement brought her closer to Alexander Hamilton.

His familiar scent enveloped her. Alexander's furrowed brow relaxed slightly, though his tone remained stern. "Running such a high fever, yet still worrying about others?"

Through the haze, Evelyn heard his words and instinctively wanted to argue. But overwhelming exhaustion pulled her under.

She fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.

When she awoke, blinding white light assaulted her vision.

Blinking, Evelyn saw a nurse swabbing her pale hand with alcohol.

"The patient's awake," the nurse murmured.

Alexander appeared instantly at her bedside. His dark eyes bore into her, swirling with unreadable emotions.

Evelyn tried to speak, but a sharp sting interrupted her. She winced.

"Don't move." Alexander's voice came from above her.

Realizing she was receiving IV fluids, Evelyn stilled.

"What's happening?" Alexander's voice turned icy. "This is the second attempt."

The nurse dabbed her forehead nervously. "Her veins are quite narrow—"

"What medication?" Evelyn rasped.

"Clindamycin. For inflammation—"

"Pneumonia?"

The nurse brightened. "Mild pneumonia. The main issue is severe upper respiratory and bronchial inflammation."

Evelyn understood now. The daytime improvement had been deceptive—the infection had spread downward.

"How serious?" Alexander pressed.

"Standard treatment." Evelyn kept her voice even. "IV fluids with nebulizer therapy. Recovery will be quick."

The nurse exhaled in relief. "You're in the medical field?"

"OB-GYN."

"That explains it." The nurse wiped her brow. "We considered cephalosporins, but couldn't confirm your allergy history while you slept. Your husband refused a skin test, so we started with clindamycin."

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm not allergic to cephalosporins."

"Should we switch medications?"

"No need." Evelyn paused. "And he's not my husband."

The nurse looked baffled. "But he carried you into the ER—"

"Just being a Good Samaritan."

Alexander snorted. "Is the needle in or not?"

The nurse turned to Evelyn helplessly. "Perhaps we should try the other hand? The veins here aren't visible anymore."

Evelyn withdrew her left hand decisively.

She clenched and unclenched her fist, then slapped the back of her hand firmly. After palpating the skin, she pointed. "Here."

This time, the needle found its mark effortlessly.

"Thank you," Evelyn said softly.

Alexander stared at her reddened hand, his expression stormy. "You're ruthless with yourself."

"Effective methods matter most."

The nurse hurried out after giving instructions, pausing when Alexander unexpectedly apologized.

Silence settled over the hospital room.

Evelyn touched her burning forehead—the fever hadn't abated.

"Drink." Alexander placed water on her bedside table. "No need for formalities when we're alone."

"It's called basic courtesy."

He sat on the edge of her bed. "If I hadn't come, how high would you have let your fever climb?"

"I didn't expect it to get this bad." Even Evelyn was surprised.

She'd genuinely felt better that morning.

"Some viruses prey on easy targets." Alexander's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Waits until I leave to attack."

Evelyn arched a brow. "So I'm soft, and you're hard?"

"Exactly."

Evelyn: "..."

Alexander suddenly leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "You're soft where you should be... and firm where it counts."

"Alexander!"

"I meant your stubbornness. Problem?"

Evelyn turned her face away.

He shoved the water cup into her hands. "The doctor says you've overworked yourself these years—your immune system's shot. I've hired a nutritionist. You're following their meal plan."

"No time." Evelyn watched the water ripple. "Too many responsibilities."

"I'll handle Hamilton Group affairs until you recover."

"What about the summit? I only attended one day."

Alexander laughed darkly. "That tedious conference? Nothing worth hearing."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "That's not what you said before we came."
###Chapter 489: Atonement Requires the Right Attitude

Alexander Hamilton wasn't annoyed at being called out. Instead, he chuckled softly. "This conference has been more tedious than expected. The previous years were interesting, but now it's all empty formalities. If you're curious about the next two days, I can have the organizers send you the slides. Though I warn you, those documents are even more sleep-inducing."

"More boring than medical textbooks?" Evelyn Carter had spent years as a med student, grinding through research papers as routine. A few slides were nothing.

But what frustrated her more was—

"You really have no symptoms at all?"

Alexander shook his head. "None."

They took the same flight. Shared the same room. How was he completely unaffected?

Was the virus playing favorites?

He raised a brow. "Maybe it's because you're a doctor. You've offended the virus family, and they're here for revenge."

Evelyn scoffed. "How chivalrous of them."

He leaned in, pressing a hand to her forehead. "Why are you still burning up?"

She turned her face away. "Stay back."

"What now?"

"Tired."

He tucked the blanket around her. "Sleep."

"What about you?"

"I'll stay."

She rolled onto her side, turning her back to him. "Go do your work. I'll be fine after some rest."

"I can't see you like this. Turn around." He reached over and gently shifted her onto her back. "Your IV is in your left arm. Lying on your side will put pressure on it."

She glared. "Now you're dictating how I sleep?"

He patted the blanket. "Sleep."

The fever dragged her under quickly.

In the haze between wakefulness and dreams, she caught fragments of his hushed phone call.

"Email me the Hamilton Group documents..."

"Find someone who can make soup..."

"Visit the Taylors this weekend..."

"About Peter Harrison..."

The words blurred as darkness swallowed her whole.

When she opened her eyes again, sunlight filled the room.

Alexander stood by the IV drip, speaking quietly with a nurse.

She coughed, her throat parched.

He turned. "Awake?"

Her gaze dropped to his fingers. "Why are you holding the IV tube?"

The nurse suppressed a smile. "Your husband was worried the fluid was too cold. He slowed the drip and warmed it with his hands."

Alexander huffed. "No need to explain. Everything I do is wrong anyway."

The nurse excused herself with a quiet laugh.

Evelyn touched the tube near the needle. It wasn't icy anymore.

"My mistake."

"If you're atoning, you should expect to be misunderstood a few times." He picked an apple from the fruit basket. "Eat this first. Breakfast will be here soon."

She blinked. "You can peel an apple?"

His long fingers moved deftly, the peel falling in one unbroken spiral. Soon, a perfectly peeled apple was in her hand.

"Did you learn that for Annabelle?"

His hands stilled briefly before he continued in silence.

She took a bite. "Guess so."

"Evelyn, I can't change the past. But you can't keep holding it against me."

"Who's holding anything?" She chewed. "Skills you learned for her now benefit me. In a way, I should thank her."

"You're clearly upset."

"I'm not."

"You are."

She licked juice from her lips. "Fine. I am. How would you feel if I said I married you because I was in love with a man named Alexander Hamilton Sr., and that becoming a doctor and buying a home were all for him?"

"..."

"There are too many knots between us. A few massages and peeled apples won't untangle them."

He nodded slowly. "I'm not forcing you."

"You couldn't if you tried."

"I know. Push you too hard, and you'd probably drag us both down together."

The crisp snap of the apple echoed sharply in the quiet room.

Silence stretched.

When she finished, he took the core and tossed it. Pulling out a tissue, he wiped her fingers. "Don't move. You'll dislodge the needle."
###Chapter 490: A Growing Sense of Dread

"Why didn't you tell me you were sick before boarding the plane?"

Evelyn Carter's lashes fluttered as she met his gaze directly. "Why were you in economy class?"

"I went straight there. No one would refuse to switch seats with me."

"Didn't Lydia ask where you were going?"

"I said I had business. She wouldn't pry."

Evelyn frowned.

A twenty-three-year-old girl, no matter how sheltered, should have some sense of caution.

If there were more men like Simon Stapleton and Peter Harrison in this world, Lydia would be easy prey.

The sudden ring of her phone shattered the silence.

Evelyn reached for it, but her left hand was uncooperative.

Alexander Hamilton picked it up first.

"Who is it?"

Her heart skipped a beat, fearing it might be Gregory Wilson.

"Uncle Anthony," Alexander answered calmly.

It was Anthony Taylor.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Alexander listened quietly, occasionally murmuring an acknowledgment, giving no hint of the conversation's content.

The call ended quickly.

"Don't worry. I'm here," he said, setting the phone down without explanation.

"Did you tell him I'm sick?"

"He called last night while you were asleep. Not answering would've worried him more."

"Does he know you came to the summit with me?"

Alexander's expression shifted subtly. "It was the other Uncle Anthony."

Evelyn's breath caught.

Andrew Anderson.

Her father, who erupted in fury at the mere mention of Alexander's name.

"Did he yell at you?"

Alexander showed her the call log.

One hour and forty-two minutes.

"He was remarkably restrained," he said evenly. "With his daughter sick and only me by her side, he had no choice but to hold back."

"That's just how my dad is."

"I know." Alexander studied her. "Want to get up?"

Evelyn shook her head and lay back. "He wouldn't call in the middle of the night without reason. Is it about the house? Or Peter?"

"Neither." Alexander pressed a firm hand on her shoulder as she tried to sit up. "Emily was in a car accident after returning from summer camp. Your father wants you to pull some strings at the hospital."

"An accident?!" Evelyn struggled violently. "How bad is it? Where is she—"

"Listen first." Alexander held her steady.

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Her voice cracked, her head throbbing. "And you were feeding me apples..."

She shoved at him, yanking the IV line until it swayed.

"Let go!"

Alexander clenched his jaw, suppressing his irritation. "Calm down. Emily's fine."

"A hit-and-run with an electric scooter. A bystander took her to the hospital."

"An electric scooter?" Evelyn's body relaxed momentarily before tensing again. "If it's minor, why call in the middle of the night?"

"She has bruises that need time to heal. They want a good doctor to minimize scarring."

"I'll contact the plastic surgery department—"

"It's already handled."

Evelyn felt a sliver of relief.

But the unease in her chest only grew stronger.

"Did they catch the driver?"

"Not yet. But there's surveillance footage at the intersection."

"What did the police say?"

"Preliminary assessment says it was an accident."

Evelyn scoffed. "Do you believe that?"

Alexander took her icy hand. "No."

"Neither do I."
###Chapter 491: Better an Open Enemy Than a False Friend

Emily Anderson's accident right after returning home was too coincidental.

Evelyn Carter clenched the bedsheet, a nauseating figure flashing through her mind. "It's Peter Harrison."

Alexander Hamilton smirked coldly. "Last time you came to me, wasn't it because he threatened your sister?"

"He has no moral boundaries." Evelyn's fingers trembled. "She's my only sister..."

"Give me your phone."

Alexander gripped her wrist. "And then what? Confront Peter or call the police? If he dared do this, he's already planned his exit. Even if we catch the perpetrator, it won't lead back to him."

Evelyn punched the bedside. "So he just gets away with it?"

"Better an open enemy than a false friend."

Suddenly, Evelyn recalled last night's muffled phone call. "You reinstated him?"

"Yes."

"..."

"Peter is clever—he skirts the edge of the law every time. Even if we trace this to him, he'll just pay some medical compensation." Alexander's eyes darkened. "Unless he's dead or rotting in prison, your family will never have peace."

Evelyn's eyes reddened. "Why do the wicked always win?"

"Remember what happened to Simon Stapleton?" Alexander's lips curved. "Peter's time is coming."

"...Thank you."

Recalling her previous rejections, an odd feeling stirred in Evelyn's chest. He'd been setting this up all along.

Alexander raised a brow. "Should I say 'you're welcome'?"

"Whatever."

"Don't forget about the seafood." He leaned in abruptly, his breath brushing her ear. "I have an excellent memory."

Evelyn's ears burned. "...I know."

A sudden knock interrupted them.

Alexander's expression turned icy. "Stay put. I'll handle it."

"What if it's a doctor?"

He glanced at the mountain of fruit baskets on the table. "These people have noses sharper than bloodhounds."

Evelyn understood. The rare appearance of Hamilton Group's CEO at the summit had vultures circling. Tracking him to the hospital took skill.

"Come in."

The door opened to reveal Lydia Laurent holding a thermal container, hesitating at the threshold. "Alexander... Evelyn."

Seeing her, Alexander's demeanor softened slightly.

"Evelyn, are you feeling better?" Lydia hurried to the bedside. "I had the chef make congee specially for you."

The aroma of plain congee wafted from the container. Evelyn accepted a small bowl. "Perfect timing. I'm starving."

"Dad says girls should eat warm congee when they're sick." Lydia blinked. "Alexander's friends are my friends too."

Evelyn's hand paused mid-scoop. That phrasing... didn't sound like Lydia.

Alexander's eyes flickered. Leonard Laurent, that old fox, must've heard about him carrying Evelyn out of the hotel and couldn't sit still.

"Oh," Lydia added suddenly, "Dad said it's inappropriate for him to visit as a man, but he hopes you don't mind, Alexander."
###Chapter 492: The Bite Mark on Alexander's Neck

Lydia blinked, nodding with partial understanding. "I see, Evelyn."

She turned to Alexander, her voice sweet and soft. "Alexander, you can go ahead. I'll take care of things here."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "You know how to care for a patient?"

"Of course!" Lydia counted on her fingers. "Fetching meals, pouring water, keeping company..."

She paused mid-count, glancing at Evelyn for help.

Alexander added leisurely, "And checking temperatures, monitoring IV drips, observing the patient's condition. Can you handle all that?"

Lydia deflated. "That... sounds complicated."

"Which is why I should stay," Alexander said flatly.

Lydia suddenly brightened. "But Alexander, you're a man. Isn't it... inappropriate for you to care for Evelyn?"

Alexander stiffened.

Evelyn quickly interjected, "Lydia's right. You must be swamped with work, Mr. Hamilton. Don't let us keep you."

Their gazes clashed in the air.

Oblivious to the tension, Lydia chimed in, "Alexander is always so kind. He'd help anyone, even strangers."

Alexander's expression darkened. "I'm not that idle."

Lydia backtracked hastily. "I meant—Evelyn is with us, so of course you'd care for her."

A phone buzzed.

Alexander glanced at the caller ID and declined the call.

He checked the IV bag. "This one's almost done. There's another glucose bag after—about an hour left."

The phone buzzed again.

Evelyn sighed. "You should take that."

Alexander frowned at the screen, his expression tense. "I'll be right back."

He turned to Lydia. "Please look after Dr. Carter."

Lydia nodded obediently. "Don't worry, Alexander!"

Before leaving, Alexander asked Evelyn, "Need anything?"

"No, thank you."

Once alone, Lydia fluttered around like a sparrow. "Evelyn, some water? Fruit? Want me to tell you a joke?"

Evelyn stifled a laugh. "Just sit still, please."

A doctor entered for rounds.

"Temperature last night?" He flipped through the chart. "Good, the fever's down, but the infection persists. Continue the IV."

Glancing at the drip, he asked casually, "Your sister? Where's your husband?"

Before Evelyn could explain, Lydia blurted, "Not her husband! They barely know each other!"

The doctor looked startled. "Barely know each other? Then why was he giving you a sponge bath last night?"

Evelyn froze.

Lydia's eyes widened. "A... sponge bath?"

"Just wiping my hands with alcohol," Evelyn clarified quickly.

The doctor shook his head. "I saw him carrying multiple basins of hot water. That's excessive for just hands."

Silence fell.

Realizing his blunder, the doctor stammered, "Maybe for the humidifier... I'll check other rooms!"

The door shut. Lydia's face burned crimson.

"Evelyn..." She hesitated. "There's something... please don't be upset."

"What is it?"

"Alexander might not have... brought you here just for you." Lydia lowered her voice. "I saw a woman in the next room—the one who spoke at the summit!"

Evelyn's pulse jumped.

Lydia grew more animated. "It must be her! Alexander suddenly came to the summit for her! She's gorgeous and capable—just like Annabelle!"

"How do you know?"

"Because..." Lydia leaned in, whispering conspiratorially, "I saw a bite mark... on Alexander's neck!"
###Chapter 493: The Blood-Scented Beast

Evelyn's pupils constricted sharply.

Fragments of last night's memories scattered through her mind. She only remembered Alexander pushing her to the brink, her desperate sobs and struggles, and finally sinking her teeth into him.

Where had she bitten him? The sensation in the darkness remained indistinct.

That bite filled her with instant regret.

She'd thought pain would stop him. Instead, it had turned him into a beast scenting blood—more frenzied than ever.

Lydia's words made Evelyn's fingertips tremble.

When Alexander returned laden with bags, the IV drip was nearly empty.

"Alexander!" Lydia's cheeks flushed pink.

He frowned. "Why so red? Running a fever?"

"Oh no, just... the heat..."

Setting down the items, his gaze suddenly froze.

A winding trail of blood in the IV tube was horrifying to behold.

Lydia turned pale. "Oh god! So much blood—"

"Just backflow. Don't panic," Evelyn said calmly.

Alexander slammed the call button, his voice icy. "'Just' backflow?"

The nurse swiftly handled the issue, chiding, "Why didn't you call us when the IV finished?"

Lydia twisted her fingers. "It's my fault. I was so engrossed talking with Evelyn..."

"Go home," Alexander said tersely.

Evelyn patted his arm. "Don't frighten Ms. Laurent."

He turned to her, eyes burning. "What could you possibly discuss that made you miss this?"

"...You."

"Me?"

Lydia scrambled up. "Rest well, Evelyn. I'll take my leave."

"Thanks for the porridge." Evelyn watched her flee.

Alexander didn't move.

"Not seeing her out?"

"I'm not her bodyguard."

He caught his harsh tone and softened his voice. "Does it hurt?"

"It's fine."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "...I overreacted."

Dark circles shadowed his eyes. After keeping her up till dawn the previous night and monitoring her fever all evening, even iron would wear thin.

Evelyn stayed silent. Alexander carefully adjusted her position, tucking a heating pad beneath her IV hand.

"That night..." His voice turned rough. "Gregory's note set me off."

Evelyn's temple throbbed. How would she face Gregory after this?

"Coming all the way to the capital just to tour hospitals," she deflected.

Alexander played along. "How does it compare to yours?"

"Older equipment, but any hospital that heals is good enough."

"The air's too dry here."

Her heart skipped.

"Should get a humidifier," he mused.

She turned away, catching the bite mark on his neck in her periphery.

"Sleepy." She rolled onto her side, back to him.

Alexander tucked the blankets around her. "Rest. I'll watch the IV."

Soon, even breaths filled the room.

After a moment, Alexander lifted her IV-pierced hand. The vein stood visible from continuous fluids. Cradling it gently, he checked emails with his free hand.

His brief appearance at the summit's opening had spawned a flood of get-well fruit baskets. Hamilton Group transition documents clogged his inbox, alongside Emily's endless task list.

By the time he finished, midnight had passed.

His phone lit up beside the pillow. The name "Peter Harrison" flashed. Alexander carried it to the stairwell.

He answered in frozen silence.

A light chuckle came through. "Mr. Hamilton?"

Alexander's voice dripped frost. "What do you want?"
###Chapter 494: One-on-One Tutoring from the Master

"Mr. Hamilton, it's actually you I wanted to reach." Peter Harrison's voice dripped with smug confidence through the receiver. "I just didn't have your direct number, so I had to call Evelyn instead."

He paused, his tone turning teasing. "Seems I guessed right—Evelyn would be asleep at this hour, leaving you to answer. Congratulations, Mr. Hamilton. Finally won the fair lady's heart?"

A cold glint flashed in Alexander Hamilton's eyes. "Got what you wanted and still bothering us?"

"Don't be so cold," Peter chuckled shamelessly. "Just a minor funding hiccup with the project. Thought I'd ask for your generous approval."

"You think you deserve it?"

Peter remained unfazed. "Mutual benefit, that's all. Since Evelyn means so much to you, isn't it fair for the matchmaker to claim his reward?"

Alexander let out a humorless laugh. "Fine. You'll have it tomorrow."

"Now that's what I call decisiveness!"

"Assuming you live to see tomorrow."

Dead silence filled the line. Peter shot up from his chair, frantically checking locks as cold sweat drenched his back. "W-what do you mean?"

Alexander's voice was eerily calm, as if discussing the weather. "Permanent solutions save trouble. Should I reunite you with Simon Stapleton?"

The realization hit Peter like a sledgehammer. He'd thought Evelyn was his golden ticket, but Alexander wasn't playing by his rules.

"Mr. Hamilton, we live in a society of laws," he stammered, clinging to false bravado. "If anything happens to me, Evelyn will suspect you first."

"You overestimate your importance." Alexander's tone remained flat. "You'll disappear just like Simon did."

The call ended with a decisive click. Alexander deleted the record and slipped back into the hospital room.

Evelyn slept soundly, though her brows were knitted. He reached to smooth them but withdrew at the last second.

Outside, he crossed paths with a night-shift nurse.

"Another vigil?" she asked kindly.

Alexander nodded. "Repaying old debts."

As she recorded vitals, the nurse lowered her voice. "Dr. Carter's body is severely depleted. This cold was just the tipping point. She needs long-term recovery—no more overworking."

His gaze darkened. "Will it affect her future workload?"

"Absolutely not!" The nurse was firm. "Health comes first."

The day of their return dawned clear over the capital.

Color had returned to Evelyn's cheeks. Alexander had somehow arranged daily gourmet soups—each more nourishing than the last—turning even this soup-averse woman into an enthusiast.

"ID, please." At the airport, Alexander held out his hand. "Go sit."

Evelyn scanned the crowded terminal. "No seats left."

"The first-class lounge has plenty." He plucked the documents from her grip. "Another economy flight, and my knees will retire before I do."

Soon he returned with upgraded boarding passes.

Evelyn studied the crisp tickets. "Thank you."

The lounge's leather couches were indeed luxurious. When Alexander handed her water, he noticed her phone switching from messages to financial news.

"Emily's doing alright?"

"Yes, Olivia checked on her." Evelyn pocketed her phone. "That drama queen overreacted to some minor pain."

Alexander leaned closer. "Stop scrolling. You just left the hospital."

"I'll rust if I rest any longer." She sighed. "Came all this way for the summit and only attended one day."

His eyes dropped to her screen. "Theories won't help."

"Then how do I improve quickly?"

"Learn from me."

Evelyn snorted and kept scrolling.

"Don't believe me?"

"I do." She didn't look up. "This summit thoroughly demonstrated Mr. Hamilton's industry clout."

The corner of his mouth lifted. "Personalized tutoring. Point out what you don't know—I'm available 24/7. Free of charge."

Suddenly, Evelyn turned her screen toward him. Displayed prominently: the National Anti-Fraud Center app icon.
###Chapter 495: No Disturbance

The afternoon sun slanted through the airport terminal in H City.

Evelyn Carter dragged her weary steps behind Alexander Hamilton, watching as he effortlessly retrieved their luggage and pushed the cart forward with practiced ease.

"I can manage," she said, reaching for her suitcase.

Alexander sidestepped her, moving the cart ahead. "Public resources shouldn’t be wasted."

His tall figure stood out in the crowd, forcing Evelyn to quicken her pace to keep up.

Suddenly, he stopped.

Following his gaze, Evelyn saw a little girl with braids sitting atop a suitcase, giggling as her pink princess dress fluttered in the breeze.

"Does she remind you of anyone?" he asked softly.

Evelyn turned her face away. "All children are equally adorable."

Alexander’s Adam’s apple bobbed, his knuckles whitening around the cart handle. "Let’s go."

In the parking lot, Emily Zade had been waiting. Her eyes flickered with understanding as she watched them approach separately.

"Mr. Hamilton, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn nodded politely. "Thank you for your hard work, Emily. The Anderson Group matters have been handled well because of you."

"It’s my job," Emily replied, opening the car door with a smile. "I heard you’ll be taking over the Anderson Group?"

Alexander cut in abruptly. "We’ll talk in the car."

He slid into the backseat, leaving ample space between them—enough for another person.

As the car started, Emily glanced at the awkward pair through the rearview mirror and broke the silence. "If you need an assistant, Ms. Carter, I can recommend some reliable candidates."

"That would be perfect. I’ve been worried about that."

"But for business matters..." Emily’s eyes flicked meaningfully to the mirror. "Mr. Hamilton is the most knowledgeable."

Evelyn’s fingers twisted unconsciously. "Mr. Hamilton is extremely busy—"

"Not at all." Alexander spoke suddenly, still staring out the window, his jaw tight. "Emily, inform the front desk that Ms. Carter is welcome to visit my office anytime."

Evelyn froze.

The air in the car grew thin. She inched closer to her door, only to realize Alexander had already pressed himself against the opposite window.

The invisible chasm between them seemed impossible to bridge.
###Chapter 496: No Free Favors

Evelyn Carter lowered her head to organize the documents. "Hamilton Group's office is across town from Anderson Construction. We won't run into each other often."

"What if we do?" Alexander Hamilton turned to Emily Zade. "Screen the assistants yourself. Send me the list first."

"I can handle it myself," Evelyn frowned.

"Do you know any of Anderson's employees?" Alexander countered. "Do you trust their backgrounds?"

Evelyn fell silent.

"Skills can be trained. Integrity is non-negotiable." His tone left no room for argument.

Emily interjected smoothly, "Ms. Carter, Mr. Hamilton is being thorough. The business world is a battlefield. Newcomers are easy targets for schemers."

A phone buzzed.

[Gregory Wilson: Landed yet?]

At dawn, Gregory had insisted on picking her up. Evelyn had argued relentlessly to convince him she was visiting her sister at the hospital.

She angled away to reply: [Yes. On my way back.]

The moment she hit send, Alexander leaned in casually. "Emily Anderson?"

Evelyn locked her screen.

"Not replying?"

She turned to type, but his shadow fell over her phone again.

"Meeting someone this late?"

"Since when do you violate basic privacy?" Evelyn's voice turned icy.

"Get a privacy screen." He shrugged.

Outside, the scenery shifted abruptly. Evelyn tensed. "This isn't the way home."

Emily explained gently, "You just recovered. Going home means pulling all-nighters to study. Rest first."

Alexander cut in, "Is dinner ready at the hotel?"

"Everything's arranged."

"I'm going home." Evelyn's voice was steel. "White Coat is waiting."

"Is it the dog waiting—or Dr. Wilson?" Alexander's gaze frosted over. "If you won't give him hope, stop seeing him."

"At least let me get my dog."

"Tell him not to wait."

Evelyn addressed the driver, "Pull over at the next intersection."

"No stopping zones." Alexander tapped the window. "Speed up."

Thirty minutes later, the resort hotel glittered against the night.

Emily hurried to the front desk and returned with a keycard. "Ms. Carter, please rest well."

"Two rooms," Alexander added. "Relax."

Evelyn scoffed. The entire hotel was his. What difference did separate rooms make?

The penthouse suite offered sweeping views—the same one she'd stayed in after returning from England.

"Name your terms." Evelyn went straight to the point.

Alexander stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his silhouette sharp. "I'll fast-track your onboarding at Anderson. From corporate structure to key clients—I'll teach you myself."

That surprised her. Her expression softened slightly. "Thank you."

"We start tomorrow." He turned, dark currents swirling in his eyes. "But I have conditions."

Evelyn held her breath.

"I want a child." Each word landed like a hammer. "I don't do free favors."
###Chapter 497: The Price She Couldn't Pay

The air grew thick enough to drown in.

Evelyn's pupils trembled slightly as she stared at Alexander's chiseled profile, forcing down the storm inside her.

The image of that little girl sheltered in her father's arms at the airport resurfaced.

"You..." Her throat tightened. "With your status, Mr. Hamilton, having a child should be effortless. Women would line up for the privilege."

Alexander's gaze burned like hot iron. "I only want yours."

He watched Evelyn's knuckles whiten at her sides, feeling his heart split open with a dull blade.

That night at Capital Hospital, she'd said too many knots bound them.

Every moment with Annabelle—he'd spend a lifetime making amends.

But this...

When he'd opened that baby journal, each "I'm sorry" had stabbed deeper than the last.

Beneath Evelyn's gentle exterior lay unyielding stone.

Their lost child remained a wound that never healed—scabbed over yet bleeding at the slightest touch.

"I want a child." Alexander's voice roughened. "Desperately."

Evelyn gripped the table edge. "What's that to me?"

"I want her back."

That single word—her—struck them both like gunfire.

"Are you worthy?" Evelyn's laugh was ice.

This was their deepest taboo. Each mention cut both ways.

"Neither am I." Her voice shook.

Alexander stepped closer. "It wasn't your fault. Back then—"

"Enough!" She shoved to her feet. "You lured me here at midnight for this? To be your broodmare? Snap your fingers, and women will come running!"

Her entire body trembled like autumn leaves.

Alexander's throat worked, pain churning in his eyes.

He'd frightened her.

"I'm sorry."

Her shove sent him stumbling back.

"We have to move past this," he said hoarsely.

"I can't." Evelyn turned away. "Not in this lifetime."

Only the rustle of leaves outside filled the silence.

"Don't trouble yourself with Anderson Group." Her tone frosted over. "I'll manage—or hand it to Anthony Taylor."

"..."

"Leave."

Alexander studied her fragile silhouette before yielding. "I'm next door if you need me."

"Don't bother."

At the doorway, he paused. "The doctor said you need rest. I'll handle Anderson Group."

"No." Her smile was razor-thin. "Mr. Hamilton never works pro bono. The price is too steep."

A phone buzzed abruptly.

Alexander checked the screen. "I overstepped today. Get some rest."

The soft click of the door left Evelyn alone.

She collapsed beside the tea table.

Vivian's call came right on cue.

"Evelyn, Gregory said you're not home? Did you visit Emily at the hospital?"

"Not yet." Rubbing her temples, Evelyn recounted everything.

Instead of the expected outburst, silence stretched.

"Vivian?"

"Listening." Her friend's voice thickened. "Dad told me some things."

"What?"

"Grandma's neurosurgery abroad... Alexander arranged the specialists. And—" A pause. "Five days ago, five million appeared in our company account. From Hamilton Group."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the phone.

"Grandma's life. The company..." Vivian's laugh was bitter. "He only intervened for you. I should be cursing him to hell, but now..."

"I froze the funds." Sudden steel entered her tone. "If you're done with him, I'll return every cent."
###Chapter 498: No One Could Stop Him

Evelyn took a deep breath, her fingertips lightly tracing the phone screen. "Use the money for now."

"You're really going to have his baby?" Vivian's voice suddenly rose.

"He's insane, but I'm perfectly lucid." Evelyn chuckled softly. "So Vivian, you need to step up. Make big money, and we'll pay him back with interest."

A sigh came through the phone. "Forget it. I tried. I'm just not cut out for business. My dad looks at me like I'm a lost cause now."

"What about the company—"

"We'll keep it running, of course." Vivian's tone turned resolute. "I've figured it out—if I can't do it, I'll find someone who can."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "You're hiring a professional manager?"

"No. I'm getting married."

"A business marriage?" Evelyn nearly bit her tongue. "You're going the heiress route now?"

"Please. The so-called elite in our circle are either playboys like Vincent Wilson or mediocre talents." Vivian scoffed. "The only decent one is Gregory. But we both know who he really wants."

The mention of Gregory Wilson made Evelyn's chest tighten.

If she had met him first...

"So what's your plan?"

"I'll marry a self-made man." Vivian said it casually. "Doesn't matter if his background is humble, as long as he's capable."

Evelyn immediately thought of Simon Stapleton's deceitful face. "Have you forgotten what happened last time?"

"This time is different." Vivian's laugh was cold. "I won't be naive again. My dad holds all the company shares. I can offer a high salary, bonuses—but not a single share."

"This kind of marriage—"

"It's mutually beneficial." Vivian cut her off. "He wants social mobility. I need someone to run the company. He can keep ten mistresses for all I care, as long as the business thrives."

Evelyn's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

She recalled the rumors about that financial firm in Harbor City—the wife who allowed her husband to keep his first love as his secretary, the three of them happily having afternoon tea together.

"That's absurd—"

"I think it's perfect." Vivian laughed lightly. "If his women know their place, I wouldn't mind taking them shopping or to the spa."

Evelyn wanted to argue, but Vivian abruptly changed the subject. "More importantly, Alexander is dead set on having a child this time. If he's truly determined—"

"He can't exactly chain me to a bed." Evelyn gazed out at the dark valley beyond the window.

After hanging up, she noticed several elegant paper bags by the bed. Inside were neatly folded outfits—from lingerie to outerwear, all in her exact size.

This wasn't Emily Zade's style.

Evelyn changed into a pale yellow dress set, loosely pinning up her hair. She needed air before these troubles suffocated her.

The hotel garden was serene under the night sky. Just as Evelyn read the signpost, she collided with a scorching gaze.

A woman in a fiery red dress leaned against a pillar, her cascading curls spilling over bare shoulders. Evelyn recognized her—Sophia Winston from the karaoke bar.

The heavy perfume hit Evelyn first.

"Excuse me." She walked past without a glance.

Sophia stepped aside but her eyes followed. When Evelyn reached the heart of the garden, the woman suddenly quickened her pace.

Evelyn deliberately turned into a secluded greenhouse, then spun around to block the entrance the moment Sophia stepped inside.

"What's this about, Ms. Carter?" Sophia touched her collarbone, red lips curving.

"That's my question." Evelyn's stare was icy. "Following me from the lobby to the garden—what do you want, Ms. Winston?"
###Chapter 499 I Don't Want Him.
The night was deep and silent in the garden, save for the faint chirping of insects.

Sophia Winston approached in her stilettos, crimson lips curling. "So you're Evelyn Carter? Don't worry—I'm not talking about that clingy Annabelle Taylor."

Evelyn looked up, moonlight casting a frosty glint in her eyes. "What do you want?"

"Just a coincidence." Sophia twirled a lock of her curled hair. "I was curious about the woman who still haunts Alexander Hamilton's thoughts."

Evelyn turned to leave.

"Wait." Sophia suddenly grabbed her wrist. "That outfit looks stunning on you."

"Bought it at the mall."

"Liar." Sophia smirked. "This has Alexander's taste written all over it. His eye for fashion is ruthless."

Their reflections shimmered in the greenhouse glass—one cold as winter, the other blazing like fire.

Evelyn settled into a wicker chair. "Cut to the chase. How long have you been following me?"

"Since you stepped off the elevator." Sophia sat across from her without hesitation. "Don't misunderstand—I have no interest in Alexander."

"Then what does interest you?"

"You." Sophia lit a cigarette. "Word is you dumped him? Brilliant move."

Through the smoke, Evelyn noticed the scars lining Sophia's inner wrist.

"Celestial Club's top hostess reduced to being a messenger?" Evelyn scoffed.

Sophia abruptly stubbed out her cigarette. "Three years ago, my gambler ex-husband nearly beat me to death. Alexander sent people to save me." She yanked her collar aside, revealing a burn scar on her collarbone. "That bastard did this with a cigarette."

Moonlight exposed the grotesque, centipede-like mark.

"So this is your gratitude?" Evelyn's tone dripped with sarcasm.

"No, this is my thanks." Sophia leaned in suddenly. "Thank you for making that arrogant man taste the bitterness of unrequited love."

A night breeze carried the scent of roses.

Evelyn stood. "Finished?"

"Do you know why he chose me?" Sophia chuckled behind her. "Because my eyes resemble yours."

Evelyn's steps faltered.

"How pathetic." Sophia's voice floated after her. "He didn't even dare find a lookalike."

Footsteps approached from the distance—Alexander's silhouette appeared at the garden's edge.

"Miss Carter, send me the link to that dress!" Sophia called out loudly.

As she turned, she whispered: "See? He can't even stand me talking to you."

Evelyn walked away without looking back.

Moonlight stretched her shadow long across the path.

Sophia remained, watching Alexander chase after Evelyn's retreating figure. She exhaled a slow smoke ring.

"Fool," she murmured to the empty air. "You don't even know who truly loves you."

The cigarette ember glowed briefly before she crushed it into the soil.
###Chapter 500: Did He Send You to Persuade Me?

The night breeze brushed past as Evelyn Carter tilted her head to gaze at the starry sky.

The mountain view made the constellations appear especially brilliant, like crushed diamonds scattered across black velvet.

"I'm still married," Sophia Winston suddenly said.

Evelyn withdrew her gaze. "That scumbag won't sign the papers?"

Sophia let out a light laugh, a trace of mockery flashing in her eyes. "He vanished long ago. After trafficking me to Southeast Asia, he never showed his face again. Probably got himself killed by loan sharks. Either way, I can't find him—so the divorce can't be finalized."

"Southeast Asia..." Evelyn hesitated.

"The red-light district," Sophia finished flatly, as if recounting someone else's story. "At first, I tried to escape. After a few failed attempts and nearly being beaten to death, I learned to behave."

Evelyn noticed the faint tremor in her fingertips and understood how painful those memories were.

"But you still got out."

"I had to." Sophia plucked a leaf and crushed it in her palm. "Stay there too long, and you either catch a disease or get resold. I got lucky—jumped off a boat during an offshore client visit and swam back."

Her tone was casual, but Evelyn could imagine the harrowing ordeal.

"After returning, they still hunted me," Sophia's voice dropped. "I'd already decided—if they caught me again, I'd jump off the nearest bridge."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "So it was Alexander Hamilton who..."

"Yes." Sophia's eyes brightened. "If not for Mr. Hamilton stepping in, I might've..."

She didn't finish, but Evelyn understood. The ruthless businessman occasionally extended a helping hand.

"He has helped quite a few people," Evelyn remarked neutrally.

Sophia turned to face her abruptly. "Ms. Carter, I'm not like those hypocrites. Mr. Hamilton saved my life. All I want is for him to get what he truly desires."

Under the moonlight, the sincerity in her eyes was unmistakable.

Evelyn arched a brow. "He sent you?"

"No!" Sophia waved her hands hastily. "I came here for personal reasons. Running into you was pure coincidence."

Evelyn nodded, then asked, "Staying at Celestial Club for good?"

Sophia smiled wryly. "I dropped out in middle school. What else can I do? Mr. Hamilton offered startup funds, but..."

She rubbed her freshly manicured nails. "At least Celestial is safe. The clients are high-profile—they won't cross certain lines. Once I save enough, I'll open a small shop in some quiet town."

Evelyn studied the exhaustion beneath her heavy makeup. "If it works for you, that's what matters."

"I know you look down on me." Sophia suddenly leaned closer. "But this is my fate. You, Ms. Carter, still have choices."

The night breeze carried the faint scent of her perfume.

"Thank you," Evelyn said softly.

"I'm the one who should be thanking you." Sophia blinked. "By the way, I heard you were a doctor? Impressive."

"Used to be." Evelyn gazed into the distance. "Not going back."

Sophia tilted her head. "Regrets?"

"What about you?"

They shared a knowing smile.

"You're far more interesting than your namesake," Sophia suddenly whispered. "Watch out for Little Cabbage."

She stepped back, pressing a finger to her lips. "The purer the flower appears, the deadlier its poison."

###Chapter 501: I Want You to Care About Me

Evelyn frowned slightly.

Was she referring to Lydia?

"Dr. Carter, what do you think of my perfume?"

Evelyn was caught off guard by the sudden question. "I don’t know much about perfumes."

"This one’s called Afternoon Delight. Mr. Hamilton thinks it’s too sweet, but I love it. What about you?"

So this was the infamous Afternoon Delight.

Evelyn replied flatly, "It’s alright."

"Seems you share his taste—neither of you likes this scent."

"Occupational habit. I’m sensitive to perfumes."

"What a shame." Sophia Winston studied her with a knowing look. "But Dr. Carter, you didn’t even flinch at such a suggestive name?"

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Alexander mentioned it."

Sophia’s eyes lit up. "I see."

What exactly did she see?

Leaning in, Sophia whispered, "I was talking about the perfume. He meant the real morning after, didn’t he?"

Evelyn: "..."

"Hahaha, Mr. Hamilton moves fast, doesn’t he?"

Evelyn started to explain, "That day—"

Sophia suddenly pressed a finger to her lips and nodded toward the path behind her. "Someone’s looking for you."

Evelyn turned and saw Alexander striding toward them.

Their eyes met on the cobblestone path.

With his jacket draped over his arm, Alexander took quick steps forward when he noticed her standing in the chilly night breeze. Without a word, he wrapped the jacket around her shoulders. "Why are you out here?"

"Taking a walk."

He moved closer. "If you don’t want to see me, I can switch to a room farther away. Just don’t wander off at night."

Evelyn chuckled. "Where could I possibly go in such a small place?"

"I brought dinner to your room earlier, but you weren’t there. I thought—"

"Thought what?"

Alexander sighed. "Have you forgotten what happened with the Dempseys? It was because I let my guard down, assuming their place was safe, that you got kidnapped."

"This is your territory. Who would dare make a move under Mr. Hamilton’s watch?" She changed the subject. "Though the people here are quite interesting."

Alexander tensed immediately. "Who did you meet?"

His mind raced through countless possibilities, but Evelyn simply said, "I ran into Miss Winston."

"Sophia’s here?" He clearly hadn’t known.

Evelyn walked back calmly. "We had quite a chat."

Alexander couldn’t hold back. "What did she say to you?"

He stopped mid-sentence, as if afraid of being misunderstood. Amused, Evelyn smiled. "Mr. Hamilton, are you afraid of me meeting Sophia? Or... are you feeling guilty?"

Alexander exhaled. "Why would I feel guilty? I just don’t want you to misunderstand. My past mistakes haven’t been cleared up yet. One more misunderstanding, and I’d never be able to prove my innocence."

His tone softened. "Whatever she said, I’m not worried because there’s nothing between us. That day at Celestial Club, I just wanted you to see me with her—"

"To make me care about you?" Evelyn finished his sentence. "She said the same thing."

Alexander relaxed slightly. "What else did you talk about?"

"How you saved her like a knight in shining armor, giving her a new lease on life."

He raised an eyebrow. "That’s it?"

"What else? Should we have discussed your moon-watching escapades?"

Evelyn tightened the jacket around her and started walking back. The mountain breeze was indeed chilly.

Alexander followed leisurely. "I just helped her out once. Didn’t expect her to remember it all this time."

Evelyn didn’t respond, instead asking, "Do you go to Celestial Club often?"

He stiffened. "Business gatherings. I won’t go anymore."

"Don’t misunderstand. I’m not trying to interfere with your personal life."

Alexander wasn’t surprised by her deflection. He leaned in suddenly and sniffed. "What’s that smell?"

Evelyn checked her sleeve. "Probably Sophia’s perfume."

She added, "Afternoon Delight."

Alexander immediately frowned.

"I don’t like that scent."

"Neither do I."

They walked silently along the corridor.

The night stretched quietly between them.

As they neared the lobby, Alexander finally spoke. "I was impulsive today. Forget what I said. Let’s stick to the original plan—sorting out the Anderson Group’s situation first, alright?"

Evelyn stopped. "And the condition?"

"...Watch the moon with me."

Before she could answer, Evelyn caught sight of a figure in the lobby and instinctively stepped away from Alexander.

Lydia was checking in at the front desk. When she noticed them entering from the garden, her eyes flickered with something unreadable.

But in an instant, she was all smiles again. "Alexander! Dr. Carter!"

In the dim light, Evelyn almost thought she’d imagined it.

This time, Alexander didn’t ignore her. "Why are you here? Where’s your father?"

Lydia held a delicate clutch, a bellboy pushing her luggage behind her—she must have come straight from the airport.

"Dad said he had business to attend to back in the city. I didn’t want to stay in the capital alone."

Alexander said, "There are plenty of places to visit there."

"Oh!" Lydia suddenly pulled something from her suitcase and handed it to him. "I almost forgot. Annabelle asked me to give this to you when I had the chance."
###Chapter 502: The True Schemer Revealed

The night deepened, bringing a chill to the mountain air.

Lydia Laurent approached with light footsteps, cradling an exquisite velvet box.

"Alexander, this is for you."

Alexander Hamilton frowned and stepped back. "No need."

"But Annabelle insisted..." Lydia bit her lip, her gaze flickering timidly toward Evelyn Carter. "If I don't deliver it, she'll be upset."

Alexander instinctively looked at Evelyn.

His physician wife remained as composed as ever, not even a flutter of her lashes betraying emotion. Only when their child was mentioned did those cool eyes ever ripple with feeling.

"Throw it away," Alexander said coldly.

Lydia grew frantic. "Alexander, please just take it! Annabelle said the capital's climate is dry, and she specially—"

"How generous of her to interfere," Alexander sneered.

Lydia twisted her fingers. "Annabelle only wants what's best for me. She says I'm too young and naive, that you might grow tired of me..."

"Her concern is unnecessary."

"But Annabelle doesn't know about your plans!" Lydia suddenly raised her voice. "She truly believes we're getting married. She's even introducing me to her connections..."

The box was shoved into Alexander's hands.

He lifted it, ready to discard it.

"Aren't you going to look?" Evelyn spoke abruptly.

Alexander paused. "It'll dirty my eyes."

"What if it's something important?" Evelyn's lips curved slightly.

Alexander sighed. "Evelyn, you know what I despise most."

As he spoke, he unwrapped the package.

A glass jar gleamed coldly under the moonlight, the label bearing the words "Pear Syrup" glaringly conspicuous.

"Oh, it's for lung health!" Lydia clapped her hands. "How thoughtful of Annabelle."

The jar arced through the air and landed precisely in the trash bin.

"Satisfied?" Alexander's icy gaze pinned Lydia.

She shrank back. "I-I'll take my leave then."

"Wait." Evelyn stopped her. "Was this all you came for?"

Lydia tilted her head. "Annabelle said..."

"What else did she say?" Alexander's voice was laced with frost.

"She said..." Lydia's voice dwindled to a whisper. "She'd help me become Mrs. Hamilton."

A sudden mountain gust swept through.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Stay away from her."

As Lydia's car disappeared around the bend, a cold glint surfaced in Evelyn's eyes.

Sophia Winston's words echoed in her mind: The most venomous ones often wear the most innocent masks.

What a masterful play—using others to do her dirty work.

Not only had she cemented Alexander's loathing for Annabelle, but she'd also planted seeds of doubt in Evelyn's heart. And the puppeteer? Still hiding behind that guileless face.

"Let's visit your adoptive parents," Alexander said, adjusting her coat.

Evelyn chuckled. "What can we do? It's not like we can kill her."

"Send her abroad." Alexander's eyes darkened. "Permanently."

"You—"

"The wind's picking up." He cut her off. "Let's talk inside."

Moonlight stretched their shadows long. Evelyn glanced back at the trash bin, where the glass jar glinted eerily in the pale light.
###Chapter 503: Separate Views

Back in the hotel room, Alexander Hamilton made no mention of what had just happened.

The front desk clerk hurried over with a file folder. "Mr. Hamilton, this was delivered by Emily Zade."

He took it casually.

Evelyn Carter glanced at it. "Anderson Group documents?"

"Personnel files."

"I thought we were starting with business operations and major clients first?"

Alexander chuckled. "Operations are the market department's job. Clients belong to customer service. What you need to manage now are the people who manage those things."

"...Got it."

"The Hamilton Group has over a hundred subsidiaries across dozens of industries. You think I’m supposed to be an expert in every single one?" He pressed the elevator button. "I’m not a god."

The doors opened, and Evelyn stepped in first.

"We’ll start tomorrow. Rest tonight."

She nodded. "Still watching the moon?"

Surprise flickered in Alexander’s eyes.

He’d thought Annabelle Taylor’s appearance would make Evelyn distance herself again.

Yet here she was, bringing it up first.

His Adam’s apple bobbed. "You’re okay with that?"

The elevator arrived. Evelyn strode out briskly. A faint smile touched Alexander’s lips as he followed close behind. "The rooftop? Let me grab you a jacket."

He swiped the keycard, but Evelyn blocked the doorway with her arm.

"What’s wrong?"

"Separate rooms."

Alexander frowned. "I thought we were watching the moon?"

"We are." Evelyn’s tone was flat. "You’re showing me the ropes. I agreed to that condition, and I won’t go back on it."

"Then what now?"

"Virtual moon viewing." She pointed at the ceiling. "Back to our own rooms. Separate views."

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "I said together."

"You never specified face-to-face." She arched a brow. "Don’t worry, I’ll definitely look."

Suddenly, he remembered the message in a bottle she’d left for Vincent Wilson.

This woman always found loopholes.

Crossing his arms, Alexander leaned against the doorframe. "The moon can wait. Vincent just called. Said Vivian Dempsey asked him to look into someone..."

"Who?" Evelyn instantly tensed.

"A materials science PhD. One of the summit’s speakers." He spoke deliberately. "Good-looking, but comes from a poor family."

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened.

Alexander tilted his chin toward the room. "Want the details? Inside?"

After a brief hesitation, she finally lowered her arm.

Victorious, Alexander stepped in with his long legs.

His eyes swept over the shopping bags on the floor, pausing on an opened dress box.

It had looked stunning on her.

But...

He noticed no shoes in the bag. She was still wearing those blistering heels.

Evelyn sat on the couch, rubbing her reddened ankle.

"What’s that guy’s deal?"

Alexander knelt before her, gently cradling her ankle as he slid off the shoe.

"Vincent dug up everything. Top student, thirty years old, never dated—completely dedicated to research."

Evelyn frowned. "Personality?"

"Can’t tell from records." Alexander looked up. "Worried he’s another Peter Harrison?"

"Vivian’s too naive."

"Not every poor kid is like Peter." He uncapped the ointment. "That guy’s ambition was in his nature. Had nothing to do with background."

Evelyn tried to pull her foot back, but he held firm.

"Why didn’t you say it hurt?"

"It’s fine." She pressed her lips together. "What’s his name?"

"Victor Laurent." Alexander dabbed on the cool gel. "Vincent said he’s applying for patents. Desperate for funding."

Evelyn instinctively flinched at the ointment’s chill.

Alexander shifted to one knee, letting her rest her foot on his thigh.

"Not worth torturing yourself for others’ opinions."

"Corporate rules."

"You’re the future head of Anderson Group. Rules don’t apply to you." His touch was featherlight. "If anyone complains, tell me."

Evelyn suddenly asked, "Alexander."

"Hmm?"

"You still want to get back together?"

His fingers stilled. When he looked up, his eyes were dark. "Yes. But I know you won’t agree."

"..."

"You’ve rejected every hint and outright offer." He resumed applying the ointment. "Pushing further will only drive you away."
###Chapter 504: The Unexpected Child

"Good that you understand."

Alexander Hamilton closed the first aid kit slowly after applying ointment to her wound. His movements were deliberate, as if deep in thought.

"I've figured it out," he stood up, looking down at her. "If reconciliation isn't possible, then so be it. This arrangement works fine too."

Evelyn Carter lifted her gaze. "If you want children, don't waste your time with me."

"Of course I want them."

The first aid kit clicked shut with a crisp sound.

"But you're right—children should grow up in a loving family." He paused. "I won't love anyone else, nor will I find someone just to have children."

Evelyn chuckled. "Then you might end up alone for life."

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted slightly. "Then alone I'll be."

The moment the door closed, Vivian Dempsey's message popped up: "Who'd believe that nonsense! Men are all obsessed with procreation—even trash like Simon Stapleton demanded a son. With the Hamilton empire at stake, you think he'd go without an heir?"

Evelyn had no rebuttal.

Years in the OB-GYN department had shown her too many absurdities.

DINK couples in their forties where the husband suddenly fathered triplets with a woman in her twenties. Husbands who once pledged eternal love, bringing their new pregnant mistresses for checkups within months of discovering their wives' infertility.

If ordinary men were like this, what more Alexander Hamilton?

"By the way, did you see the class group chat?"

Evelyn finally remembered the muted notifications. "Been too busy lately. What's up?"

"The centennial alumni reunion! Rumor has it many successful graduates are returning. The class president wants us there for show." Vivian added a mischievous emoji. "Perfect chance for you to vet my plus-one."

Evelyn frowned. "Even a lavender marriage requires careful selection."

"Relax, if you say no, I'll swap him out immediately." A string of laughing emojis followed. "Gotta cast a wide net to catch the right fish!"

Seeing her friend's nonchalance, Evelyn felt reassured.

"Alright, see you then."

Alexander had chosen a room at the end of the hallway, so quiet the mountain rain was audible. That night, Evelyn slept unusually well.

At breakfast, a waiter respectfully presented the menu. "Miss Carter, breakfast is buffet-style, but do let us know if you have special requests."

Clearly, someone had given instructions.

"Thank you, this is fine."

She carried her plate to the window seat overlooking the garden. The post-rain greenery was vibrant, birdsong crisp and pleasant.

Just as she sat down, the sound of stroller wheels approached.

"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"

Looking up, she saw an impeccably dressed young mother. The baby in the stroller grinned at her, babbling incoherently.

"Please." Evelyn shifted aside.

The woman cheerfully sat down. "Wonderful! This is the best spot for rainbow-watching!" She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Took me days to figure that out."

Evelyn studied her briefly. Staying at a resort this long suggested wealth. Her sunny demeanor reminded Evelyn of Vivian.

"Thanks for the tip." She smiled.

The woman expertly adjusted the stroller angle so her baby could see the garden. The little one giggled, the tiny flowers on her hat trembling with each head shake.

"Your daughter's adorable." Evelyn couldn't resist gently touching the baby's hand. "Six months old?"

Suddenly, the woman leaned in, blinking. "What's your relationship with Alexander Hamilton?"

Evelyn froze.

Another woman who knew Alexander?

This time—with a child?
###Chapter 505: His Baby-Holding Skills Were Remarkable

"Thank you." The young mother beamed at the compliment about her baby, her eyes crinkling into crescents. "She's seven months old now. Every time we go out, she gets showered with praise."

Evelyn Carter's gaze lingered on the baby's plump cheeks. "It's not just cuteness. Look at how her eyes curve when she smiles—she has such a blessed little face."

The mother laughed even brighter. As she adjusted items in the stroller, she suddenly lowered her voice. "Could you do me a favor?"

"Hmm?"

"I need to grab breakfast." She gestured toward the distant buffet counter. "I was so busy finding a seat earlier that I forgot to get food. Could you watch her for just a minute?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. "We've only known each other for ten minutes."

"I trust my instincts." The mother deftly lifted the baby from the stroller. "She's very well-behaved. As long as someone holds her to watch the birds outside, she won't cry."

The warm little bundle suddenly settled into Evelyn's arms, making her hold her breath instinctively.

The baby showed no shyness, squirming in the crook of Evelyn's arm before grinning up at her with a toothless smile.

Professional instincts immediately took over. Evelyn adjusted her hold with practiced ease.

"Oh my!" The mother gasped. "You hold her like a pro! Are you—"

"An OB-GYN." Evelyn brushed it off lightly. "I've handled plenty of newborns before."

"No wonder!" Relief washed over the mother. "I'll be right back!"

Before Evelyn could respond, the woman was already jogging toward the buffet.

Evelyn looked down at the baby in her arms. The little one's skin was as smooth as a freshly peeled egg, her dark, grape-like eyes staring up unblinkingly.

"Hello there, sweetheart."

Suddenly, chubby fingers reached out and grabbed the tassels of Evelyn's silk scarf.

"Ooh!" The baby kicked her stubby legs excitedly, babbling incoherent sounds.

Evelyn's heart melted instantly. She discreetly shifted her chair back to give the baby a more comfortable perch.

Fascinated by this gentle stranger, the baby began exploring every detail of Evelyn's clothes with pudgy fingers.

"Do you like Auntie that much?" Evelyn tapped the tiny nose playfully.

Giggles erupted, revealing faint dimples on those round cheeks.

Then, a pair of lean, masculine hands reached in from the side and smoothly took the baby.

Evelyn's heart lurched. She looked up into Alexander Hamilton's deep-set eyes.

"You startled me," she exhaled.

Alexander cradled the baby expertly, one hand supporting her bottom, the other protectively against her back. "Where did this child come from?"

"Another guest at our table." Evelyn reached to take her back. "Give her to me."

Instead of releasing the baby, Alexander sat beside her. "Yesterday we talked about children, and today you manifested one?"

"Don't be ridiculous." Evelyn glared. "Her mother will be back any second."

Alexander arched a brow. "Leaving an infant with strangers?"

"I thought the same." She reached again. "Hand her over."

To her surprise, the baby didn't cry. Instead, she became engrossed with the crystal cufflinks on Alexander's shirt sleeve, tiny fingers batting at them persistently.

What shocked Evelyn more was how naturally Alexander held the child—his technique flawless.

"When did you learn this?" she couldn't help asking.

Alexander's gaze darkened as he pulled the baby closer. "After we separated. Auntie Marry taught me."

The air between them froze instantly.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, masking the ripple of emotion in her eyes.

"Your milk is getting cold." Alexander's quiet reminder drew her attention to the cup before her.
###Chapter 506: Avoiding Misunderstandings

Evelyn's gaze remained fixed on the small figure in Alexander's arms.

The baby squirmed playfully, tiny fingers curiously fiddling with the metal buttons on his cuff. She took a sip of milk, the faint sweetness lingering on her tongue.

"She's friendly, but be careful," she murmured.

Alexander's lips curved slightly, warmth softening his eyes. "I know."

His long fingers brushed gently over the baby's soft hair, his movements practiced—unnaturally so for someone who'd never held a child before.

"Did you sleep well last night?"

"Mhm." Evelyn set down her cup. "Where should we start today?"

Alexander plucked a lisianthus from the vase, carefully drying the stem before offering it to the baby. The little one immediately reached for the bright flower, babbling excitedly.

"We're meeting someone first," he said.

Evelyn watched the child's delight, her expression softening. "Babies are so easy to please."

"That's a good thing," Alexander replied, his voice feather-light.

Her tone turned serious. "It's fine to play with someone else's child for a while. Raising your own isn't so simple."

"I don't mind the challenge."

Her grip on the milk glass tightened imperceptibly.

She pulled out a rose next, and the baby instantly fixated on the new toy. As Alexander took the flower, his fingertips grazed the back of Evelyn's hand.

She withdrew instantly.

The baby giggled, waving tiny fists as Alexander playfully held the rose just out of reach. His teasing was measured—enough to amuse, never enough to risk harm.

"The stem still has thorns," Evelyn reminded him.

"I know." Then he glanced up. "She's here."

A woman in a beige suit approached, balancing a tray with fruit salad and several egg tarts. Her steps were graceful, but her eyes brightened when she spotted Alexander.

"Alexander, what a coincidence," she said with a radiant smile. "I was just about to look for you."

Her gaze lingered briefly on Evelyn before she chuckled knowingly. "Seems my guess was right."

Alexander gave a slight nod. "Miss Langley, this is Evelyn Carter." He deliberately added, "Bianca Langley is married."

Bianca burst into laughter. "In such a hurry to clarify?"

"I don't want her to misunderstand," Alexander said frankly.

Evelyn's ears warmed slightly as she nodded politely. Bianca cheerfully pulled out a chair. "Relax, Evelyn. Alexander and I are just business partners."

The baby chose that moment to let out an enthusiastic "Ah!" drawing laughter from everyone.

Bianca studied Alexander's hold on the child, arching a brow. "When did you take parenting classes?"

"Observation suffices," he said dismissively.

"Alright," Bianca cut into an egg tart. "Why the sudden invitation to this resort? What's the real reason?"

Alexander adjusted his grip on the baby. "Eat first."

"You've learned consideration now." Bianca's meaningful glance at Evelyn held amusement. "Last time I saw your daughter was at her full moon celebration. She's grown so much."

"Six months is enough time for a kitten to become a little tiger," Bianca said proudly.

Evelyn quietly noted the detail. A family important enough for Alexander to attend a full moon celebration was no ordinary one.

"Not focusing on investments lately?" Alexander asked casually.

"Spending time with my child takes priority," Bianca replied, spearing a piece of fruit. "You're not about to pitch me a project, are you?"

Alexander smiled without answering.

Bianca saw right through him. "This is for Evelyn, isn't it?" She shook her head, grinning. "Alexander Hamilton, you're done for."

"Let's discuss business," Alexander said with a light cough.

Bianca set down her fork. "Fine. What is it?"

Alexander looked at Evelyn. "Her friend's company is facing cash flow issues."

Evelyn's head snapped up, startled by his directness. Bianca's eyes darted between them before she laughed. "You should've said so earlier! I love playing matchmaker."
###Chapter 507: Marriage is Worthless

Bianca Langley's gaze flickered between Alexander Hamilton and Evelyn Carter. "A friend of Dr. Carter's?"

"Mm."

"How interesting." Bianca chuckled, her fingers tapping lightly on the table. "For Mr. Hamilton to personally play mediator, this friend must be quite important."

The baby in his arms cooed and waved tiny fists. Alexander adjusted his hold, carefully smoothing her dress.

"Not my concern." He met Evelyn's eyes. "But she helped Evelyn."

Bianca arched a brow. "Repaying a debt?"

"You could say that."

The amusement faded from Bianca's face. "How much?"

Alexander concisely outlined the Dempsey family's situation. "The bank loan is settled, but restarting requires capital."

Bianca studied him skeptically. "With your resources, why bother coming to me? There's more to this, isn't there?"

Alexander gently patted the baby's back. "I transferred funds. She refused them."

Bianca fell into thoughtful silence.

Evelyn spoke up. "My friend's business was stable until this emergency. While I can't guarantee returns, I know she'll give everything."

"Fascinating." A spark of interest lit Bianca's eyes. "First time I've heard such blunt investment terms."

Alexander shook his head ruefully. "She's a doctor. Doesn't understand corporate games."

"I prefer straightforward people." Bianca tilted her head. "But Dr. Carter, business is war. Principles can be costly."

Alexander frowned. "Don't scare her."

"Oh?" Bianca teased. "So protective, Mr. Hamilton?"

Seizing the lighter mood, Evelyn said earnestly, "I'm new to this world. My ignorance must amuse you."

"Not at all." Bianca waved a hand. "With your husband's guarantee, I've no concerns. Just curious—why not use his money?"

Alexander gave a wry smile. "Long story."

"She hates you?" Bianca perked up.

Remembering Vivian Dempsey's attitude, Alexander admitted, "If she knew the source, she might deliberately lose it all."

Bianca burst out laughing. "You really screwed up!"

"Past mistakes." He sighed. "Trying to make amends."

When her laughter subsided, Bianca sobered. "Normally I'd help, but the Langley funds..." She trailed off, shadows crossing her face.

Alexander nodded. "Understood. Whatever you can manage."

"Money isn't the issue." Bianca waved impatiently. "It's dealing with him that irritates me."

Alexander ventured carefully, "You and Vincent Croix..."

"Mutual benefit." Her laugh was icy. "Marriage teaches you its true worthlessness."

Alexander's brow creased slightly. "Depends on the people."

"Think I chose poorly?"

"Vincent's capable. The Langleys prosper under him."

"True." Bianca's smile turned sardonic. "Pity good husbands and good businessmen rarely overlap."

Alexander glanced at Evelyn. "Miss Langley agrees."

Evelyn lifted her milk glass. "We're deeply grateful."

"Not so fast." Bianca's eyes gleamed mischievously. "One condition."

Taking her daughter back, she asked abruptly, "Is babysitting exhausting?"

Alexander answered honestly. "No experience."

Evelyn added, "I'm an OB-GYN. Mainly treat mothers."

"Perfect!" Bianca brightened. "Take her for a few days."
###Chapter 508: Uncle and Sister

Bianca Langley leaned against the floor-to-ceiling window, sunlight casting dappled patterns across her face through the glass. She gently stroked her daughter's soft hair before turning to Alexander Hamilton with a smile. "Such perfect weather would be wasted if we didn't go out. There's an excellent hiking trail nearby—I'd love to try it."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Taking a baby mountain climbing?"

"That's why I'm asking for help." Bianca promptly deposited her daughter into Alexander's arms. "Consider this practice for fatherhood?"

Evelyn Carter frowned. "Miss Langley, neither of us has experience caring for children."

"Don't worry," Bianca winked. "You're a professional doctor—far more reliable than this half-baked mother."

Alexander suddenly asked, "How many days will you be gone?"

"Two or three." Bianca tilted her head. "What's this? Eager to play daddy already?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest, but Alexander had already taken the child. "We'll handle it."

Bianca clapped her hands. "Perfect! I'll go pack my gear right away." She bent down to kiss her daughter's cheek. "Mommy will be away for a few days. Uncle and Sister will take good care of you."

Alexander stiffened. "Uncle?"

"What else?" Bianca grinned mischievously. "You're thirty years older than my daughter. Did you expect to be called 'big brother'?"

Evelyn couldn't suppress a quiet laugh.

Alexander shook his head in resignation. "Fine, whatever you say."

Before leaving, Bianca suddenly leaned close to Alexander's ear. "Calling her 'Sister' is temporary. Who knows—maybe she'll be 'Auntie' soon."

The tips of Alexander's ears turned pink. "Just go already."

After Bianca's whirlwind departure, Evelyn carefully inspected the baby bag. Formula, diapers, spare clothes—everything was accounted for.

"Don't stress too much." Alexander gently rocked the baby. "If we're missing anything, I'll have it delivered."

Evelyn shook her head. "Miss Langley helped Vivian so much. I owe it to her to care for this child properly."

Just as Alexander was about to respond, the baby in his arms scrunched up her face, on the verge of tears. Flustered, he grabbed a napkin from the table and folded it into a paper boat. "Look—a little boat—"

Evelyn bit back a smile. "Let me handle this." She expertly prepared a bottle of formula, tested the temperature, and handed it over.

The baby quieted down as she clutched the bottle. Alexander exhaled in relief. "Seems I'm not quite qualified as an uncle yet."

"You'll learn." Evelyn's tone softened unconsciously as she watched his clumsy yet earnest efforts.

At that moment, Vincent Wilson burst into the restaurant. "Alex, those documents you wanted—" His gaze darted between the couple and the baby, mouth gaping wide enough to catch flies. "Is... is this...?"
###Chapter 509: Whose Baby Is This?

Vincent Wilson stood frozen at the doorway, as if struck by lightning.

He blinked hard and pinched himself. The sharp pain confirmed he wasn’t dreaming—Alexander Hamilton was cradling a cherubic infant, expertly feeding her a bottle.

Evelyn Carter sat nearby, calmly reviewing documents.

"Al—Alexander..." Vincent’s voice trembled. "This..."

"Close the door," Alexander said without looking up. "You’re letting in a draft."

Vincent mechanically shut the door and stumbled toward the table. His gaze darted between the baby and Evelyn before settling on Alexander. "This child..."

"Hmm?" Alexander gently patted the baby’s back. "What about her?"

Vincent swallowed hard. "When did you—"

"Did you bring the documents?" Alexander cut him off.

"Y-yes." Vincent fumbled through his briefcase and produced a manila envelope. "Emily compiled everything as requested."

Evelyn finally glanced up and took the file. "Thank you."

Vincent stared at her flat stomach, his questions lodged in his throat.

Alexander shot him a look. "Spit it out."

"This baby..." Vincent pointed. "Is she...?"

"Not mine," Alexander stated flatly.

Vincent exhaled—then tensed again. "Then...?"

"Not Evelyn’s either," Alexander added.

Vincent’s mind short-circuited. "Then whose—?"

The baby suddenly giggled, tiny fingers clutching Alexander’s tie. He gazed down at her with uncharacteristic tenderness. "A friend’s."

"Oh." Vincent eyed them skeptically. "She’s...adorable."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Want to hold her?"

"No!" Vincent recoiled. "I’d drop her."

Silence settled over the room, broken only by the baby’s coos and the rustle of Evelyn’s papers.

Shifting uncomfortably, Vincent finally whispered, "Alexander...isn’t this moving a bit fast?"

Alexander smirked. "Fast?"

"It’s barely been days, and now there’s a baby..." Vincent peeked at Evelyn. "Does Dr. Carter know?"

Evelyn didn’t look up. "I do."

Vincent inhaled sharply.

Alexander cleared his throat. "Is the documentation complete?"

"Yes! Emily said the rest will arrive tomorrow."

Evelyn closed the file. "This is already very helpful."

Alexander turned to her. "Need anything else?"

"This should suffice." She paused. "Thank Emily for me."

Vincent glanced between them, sensing the odd tension. He coughed. "Well...if that’s all, I should—"

"Mm." Alexander nodded. "Drive safely."

Vincent edged toward the exit, stealing backward glances. At the door, he whirled around. "Alexander!"

"Yes?"

"This baby..." He pointed. "Really isn’t yours?"

Alexander deadpanned. "Who exactly would I have had her with?"

Vincent’s eyes flicked to Evelyn.

She took a sip of water, unperturbed.

"Get out," Alexander ordered.

Vincent fled. As the door clicked shut, he heard the baby’s delighted laughter and Alexander’s soft murmur: "Good girl."

The world had gone mad.
###Chapter 510: Sparks and Lightning

"Alexander, you've got a sharp eye as always." Vincent Wilson flattered before scratching his head. "Whose little princess is this?"

"Bianca Langley's daughter." Alexander Hamilton replied leisurely. "She's going mountain climbing and asked us to babysit for a couple days."

Vincent's tense shoulders instantly relaxed as he chuckled. "No wonder she looks familiar! Those eyes are identical to Bianca's."

He made an exaggerated funny face at the baby. "I heard Bianca's been hands-off with her company lately. Business meeting?"

"Mhm."

A phone ringtone abruptly cut through the air.

Vincent flashed an apologetic smile. "Excuse me, Alexander."

He answered casually, but his expression darkened the moment he heard the voice on the other end.

Alexander's gaze sharpened.

Vincent's knuckles whitened around his phone as if straining to catch every syllable. After a heavy pause, he barely managed: "Understood."

The rest of the conversation consisted solely of nasal hums.

Even Evelyn Carter looked up from her documents. The baby stopped babbling, staring curiously at this strange uncle.

"I'm at the resort." Vincent finally muttered before hanging up hastily, his eyes darting everywhere except at Alexander.

Nothing trivial could make the second son of the Wilson family this nervous.

Amused, Alexander asked with rare concern: "Debt collectors?"

"Worse." Vincent wiped sweat from his temple. "My brother. He's coming."

Alexander kept playing with the baby, unfazed. "So?"

The domestic scene sent chills down Vincent's spine. Everyone knew Alexander and Gregory Wilson were romantic rivals. Their meeting would be like lightning striking dynamite.

Stealing glances at Alexander's calm profile and Evelyn's indifferent demeanor, he forced out: "Should I... greet him at the entrance?"

"Sit." Alexander didn't even look up. "We don't turn away paying guests."

The unnatural tranquility made Vincent fidget. He shot Evelyn a pleading look, only to find her already reabsorbed in her documents, utterly detached.

Breakfast ended as the baby squirmed for a change of scenery.

"The kids' zone is just ahead," Alexander suggested. "Shall we?"

Evelyn closed her folder. "Alright."

Vincent trailed behind, watching their seamless coordination with growing dread. This sight would shatter Gregory's heart.

Laughter filled the colorful play area. The baby waved excitedly at the bright equipment.

"Not yet, sweetheart." Evelyn cradled her gently, placing protective hands around the tiny body.

The baby quieted obediently, though not fully understanding.

"Clap! Clap!" Evelyn demonstrated.

Giggles erupted until suddenly—a newly learned word bubbled forth: "Ma...ma..."

Evelyn froze.
###Chapter 511: So Close to Motherhood

Alexander's arm stiffened abruptly, his voice tight. "What did she just call me?"

The baby sensed the shift in atmosphere, thinking she'd done something wrong. She babbled at Evelyn again, "Ma...ma..."

This time, the word was unmistakably clear.

Evelyn's eyes instantly welled up, but a gentle smile curved her lips. "I'm not your mama, sweetheart."

The little one persisted, tiny hands patting Evelyn's shoulders. "Mama! Mama!"

Evelyn turned away abruptly, her lashes trembling violently.

She had once been so close to motherhood—close enough to feel that tiny heartbeat beneath her fingertips.

Alexander lowered his gaze to the ground, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Frustrated by Evelyn's lack of response, the baby stretched her chubby arms toward Evelyn's face, her whole body leaning forward.

"She wants you to hold her," Alexander murmured softly.

Evelyn took a deep breath and gathered the soft bundle into her arms. The child immediately snuggled into her embrace, the warmth and milky scent seeping through fabric, yet tightening the ache in Evelyn's chest.

The sycamore leaves rustled. The playground was silent except for the faint creak of a swaying swing.

"Evelyn—!"

Vivian's voice sliced through the quiet like lightning.

As Evelyn turned with the baby in her arms, Vivian was already rushing over, her eyes darting between the infant and Alexander. "What on earth...?!"

"Shh." Evelyn raised a finger to her lips.

The baby in her arms blinked her grape-like eyes, curiously studying the new auntie.

Vivian melted instantly, poking the baby's cheek. "Oh my god, whose little angel is this?"

"Be gentle," Evelyn sighed. "I'm not exactly skilled at handling babies."

Vivian had already whipped out her phone, snapping a dozen photos. "I leave for a few days, and you're suddenly holding a baby?"

"This is Mr. Hamilton's friend's—"

"Wait!" Vivian suddenly turned and waved. "Look who I brought!"

Vincent ducked his head and called out, "Bro."

"Hmm."

Gregory's gaze lingered on the baby and Alexander for a moment.

"Dr. Wilson." Alexander smiled smoothly.

"I came to see Evelyn."

"So did I."

Alexander turned naturally to Evelyn. "Let me take the baby. You two talk."

Gregory's expression frosted over instantly.

Evelyn settled the baby and walked over. "Dr. Wilson."

"I heard you fell ill in the capital?" Gregory's gaze softened. "Are you feeling better now?"

"I'm fine."

"Between us..." Gregory gave a bitter smile. "It feels like we've suddenly become strangers."

"Maybe it's just been too busy lately."

"White Coat's started shedding," Gregory said quietly. "He misses you."

"Ma...mama!" The baby squirmed like a pretzel in Alexander's arms, tiny hands desperately reaching for Evelyn.

Each "mama" was a knife to Evelyn's heart.

"She's asking for you." Alexander carried the child over steadily.

Evelyn took the baby. "She must think I'm her mother."

"Kids this age do that." Alexander's lips curved faintly.

Gregory's expression eased slightly. "Where's the baby's mother?"

"Busy, I suppose." Evelyn nuzzled the baby's forehead. "Oh, Dr. Wilson, the handover for Anderson Group will take time. White Coat might need you to—"

"He'll always be your dog," Gregory interrupted. "I'll take care of him until you return."

In the corner, Vincent was doing his best to become invisible.

"I was just giving Miss Dempsey a ride," Gregory explained gently.

Vivian nodded vigorously. "Dr. Wilson is an absolute angel! Unlike certain people who only know how to cause trouble..."
###Chapter 512: Us

Vivian Dempsey had been fuming lately, her glare at Alexander Hamilton sharp enough to burn holes through him.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Alexander heard every word but didn’t even flinch. His gaze slid past Vivian, settling on Evelyn Carter with the calm of deep, still waters.

Evelyn tugged discreetly at Vivian’s sleeve. "It’s not what you think. I’ll explain later."

"There’s more to it?"

"Yes. It’s complicated."

"I haven’t touched a single cent of his five million. I can return it anytime—no way I’d let him use it against you."

"It’s not about the money," Evelyn said, her voice softening as she glanced at Alexander. "Vivian doesn’t know about Miss Langley. I’ll fill her in."

Alexander gave a slight nod. "She’s standing up for you. I understand."

Evelyn offered an awkward smile.

Vivian pulled her aside, whispering fiercely, "What’s going on with you and Alexander? Did he do anything to you in the capital?"

Evelyn’s lashes trembled. "...No."

"Right. I heard his fiancée went with him. He wouldn’t dare try anything."

"Yeah." Evelyn frowned. "Things are messy enough. Why did you bring Dr. Wilson?"

Vivian sighed. "I know how you feel, but Gregory and I go way back. You rejecting him is one thing—I can’t just cut ties because of that."

Evelyn had no rebuttal.

Gregory Wilson had come to help Vivian today. She had no right to interfere.

Vivian patted her shoulder. "Relax. Gregory isn’t the type to cling. Once you move on, he’ll let go."

Evelyn forced a nod.

Vivian changed the subject, cooing at the baby in Evelyn’s arms. "Whose little one is this? Where are her parents?"

No one in the room looked like they had kids.

Evelyn adjusted her hold gently. "She’s the daughter of a friend of Mr. Hamilton’s. Her mother went hiking and left her in our care for a couple of days."

Our care.

The indifference in Alexander’s expression flickered, warmth glinting in his eyes.

Vivian gasped. "Her mother must be out of her mind! Trusting you is one thing, but Alexander? Does he even know how to handle a baby?"

Evelyn chuckled. "Let’s not get into that. Any progress on that trump card you mentioned?"

"That’s actually why I’m here." Vivian lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Besides checking on you, I was hoping to run into someone."

"Who? At the hotel?"

"Ever heard of the Langleys from Oceancrest?" Vivian’s eyes lit up. "They’re big in venture capital. The eldest daughter, Bianca, is vacationing here. My grandmother had some ties to their family—might be worth a shot."

"Oceancrest Langleys?" Evelyn’s eyes widened. The coincidence was unreal.

"Yeah." Vivian sighed. "But it’s a long shot. The connection’s too old. She might not even know."

Evelyn winced. "You’re an hour too late."

"You met her?"

"The Bianca Langley you’re looking for is the baby’s mother." Evelyn suggested, "Hiking trips don’t last more than a few days. The Dempsey Group is stable for now—you could wait."

Vivian stomped her foot. "I can’t wait! This is a golden opportunity!"

She froze, suspicion narrowing her eyes at Alexander. "This hotel is his. Bianca suddenly comes to Hudson City, stays here, leaves her kid with you two... Did you arrange this?"

Alexander didn’t deny it. "Miss Langley is indeed my guest."

"Then why did she go hiking now?" Vivian exploded. "Did you send her away? What’s your game, Alexander?"

Alexander sighed. "I didn’t know you were coming. How could I predict your actions?"

Vivian faltered.

"If I really wanted to stop you, wouldn’t it be easier to just not invite her?"

Vivian flushed. "...You’d actually help me?"

Alexander didn’t answer, looking away.

Evelyn jumped in. "Bianca left on her own. The scenery here is perfect for clearing her head. Calm down."

Vivian took a deep breath. "Fine. For your sake."

Evelyn murmured, "Keep it down. The baby’s right here."
###Chapter 513: This Is Between Men

Baby Chloe blinked her big round eyes, curiously looking back and forth between the adults. The cheerful sounds of the playground couldn’t distract her. Her tiny hand clutched Evelyn’s sleeve, and she babbled softly.

Vivian turned away from Alexander, her tone losing some of its edge. "She’s such a well-behaved baby. Not shy at all."

"Miss Langley has a bright personality. The child takes after her." Evelyn gently squeezed the baby’s chubby hand.

Vivian leaned down closer to the baby. "Did I scare you earlier, sweetheart? I didn’t mean to raise my voice."

Baby Chloe giggled and reached for Vivian’s hair.

Seizing the moment, Vivian scooped the baby up and turned to thrust her into Alexander’s arms. "Miss Langley entrusted you with her. You should be the one taking care of her."

Alexander took the baby smoothly, his movements practiced as if he’d done it a thousand times. The little girl squirmed in his arms before settling comfortably against his chest.

"You two talk." He patted the baby’s back, his gaze calm.

Evelyn tugged at Vivian’s sleeve. "Should we go grab breakfast first?"

"I’m too angry to eat!" Vivian shook her off, then suddenly turned back. "Gregory, thanks for driving me here. If you’ve got other plans, don’t let me keep you. I’ll treat you to dinner another time."

Gregory’s eyes remained fixed on Alexander. "There’s still something I need to handle."

The two men’s gazes locked, the air between them turning icy.

Vincent fidgeted nervously. "Bro, maybe we should—"

"Vincent," Alexander cut him off, "go home first."

"But—" Vincent looked helplessly at his older brother.

Gregory’s voice was cool. "Don’t wait for me."

Vincent, desperate, grabbed Evelyn’s bag strap. "Why doesn’t everyone stay? The more, the merrier!"

Vivian rolled her eyes. "An ex-husband and a colleague? They’re already out of the running."

An awkward silence fell over the group.

Vincent whispered into Gregory’s ear, "Bro, this is Alexander’s turf..."

"It’s a public place. Just a few words." Gregory didn’t budge.

Alexander gently bounced the baby in his arms. "Perfect timing. I have something to say to Dr. Wilson too."

Evelyn stepped forward anxiously. "Can’t you talk things over properly?"

"Men’s business." Alexander waved the baby’s tiny hand at her. "Don’t worry. I’m still holding her."

Baby Chloe yawned on cue, resting her head against his shoulder.

Vivian dragged Evelyn away. "Leave them to it!"

Amid the laughter and shouts from the playground, the three men stood like statues.

Alexander carefully adjusted the baby’s sun hat before placing her in the stroller, his touch as gentle as if handling fragile treasure.

"How would you like to proceed, Dr. Wilson?"

"The guest defers to the host."

Alexander gave a slight nod. "Follow me."

Vincent trailed behind, wishing he could vanish into thin air.

The restaurant was nearly empty. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, glinting off the polished marble floors.

With a gesture from Alexander, waiters swiftly set up a privacy screen around their table.

"Do you need me to—" Vincent started.

"Sit." Alexander’s tone brooked no argument.

The purple clay teapot steamed, filling the air with its fragrance. Alexander poured the tea with practiced ease, sliding a cup toward Gregory.

"Thanks." Gregory took a sip. "Go ahead, Mr. Hamilton."

Alexander leaned back in his chair, his gaze sharp. "I’m getting back together with Evelyn."

The teacup clinked against its saucer.

"This isn’t a discussion. It’s a notice." Alexander tapped the table lightly with his fingers. "Thank you for looking after her before. If you ever need anything, I’ll do my best to help."

Gregory set his cup down slowly, his eyes narrowing behind his glasses. "Is this you marking your territory?"

"No." A faint smile curved Alexander’s lips. "This is me removing an obstacle."
###Chapter 514: Rivals Lock Horns

Gregory Wilson had just lifted his teacup when he nearly choked on his drink. "Ahem!"

Alexander Hamilton set his cup down deliberately. "Does Evelyn know you want to reconcile?"

Alexander's fingers tapped lightly against the table. "She's aware of my stance."

"So she refused."

"For now."

Gregory scoffed. "You know Evelyn better than anyone. Once she makes a decision, no one can change her mind."

"That's none of your concern, Dr. Wilson."

"As long as she remains single, I still have a chance. We're friends—more than that, we're the perfect professional partners—"

"We had a child together."

The air turned glacial.

Alexander traced the rim of his teacup. "That child... is a wound we both carry."

"It only made her despise you more."

"Hate is still an emotion." A smirk played on Alexander's lips. "Tell me, Doctor, do you even have the right to earn her hatred?"

Vincent Wilson shrank into his seat, sipping his tea as if wishing he could vanish.

Alexander leaned back, utterly composed.

"She bears me no resentment. Our interactions are effortless. If she ever wants companionship for the rest of her life, I'm the obvious choice. Her first marriage wasn't built on love anyway. We'd both be starting fresh—"

"You won't get the chance." Alexander cut him off. "Because I'm here."

Gregory's pupils contracted. "Mr. Hamilton, what you call 'reconciliation' isn't the real thing. Reconciliation means two people in love finding their way back. But you two—"

"You don't get to define our relationship."

"Were you ever truly in love?" Gregory struck mercilessly. "This is nothing but your one-sided delusion."

Alexander's gaze turned arctic.

Vincent felt a chill crawl down his spine. Desperate, he blurted, "The baby's awake!"

Little Chloe giggled, clutching Alexander's finger.

"Want a toy?" Vincent hastily offered a rattle.

"No need." Alexander let the baby tug at his hand. "She likes playing like this."

Gregory stared at the stroller. "That child will always be her greatest pain. She'll never forgive you."

"I don't seek forgiveness." Alexander's voice dropped low. "As long as things stay as they are, she hasn't rejected me."

Vincent stole a glance at his brother's whitened knuckles.

"If by 'things as they are,' you mean you helping her manage the company," Gregory sneered, "then I understand why she hasn't refused."

"Glad we agree." Alexander shifted tactics. "I heard you wanted to help too? Pity..."

Each word struck like a blade.

Gregory gripped his cup. "Because I still have my medical practice."

It was Evelyn's dream—one they'd shared as the most seamless surgical team. Something Alexander could never replace.

"It's tragic that Evelyn can never practice medicine again." Gregory met Alexander's gaze head-on. "Do you even know what her dreams were?"

Of course Alexander knew.

She'd told him countless times.

She wanted to be an OB-GYN. To help mothers in remote areas. To reduce suffering in this world.

"She never wanted wealth or status." Gregory's voice tightened. "Just a simple, warm life. The path she's on now—it's not what she chose."

Alexander's jaw tensed. "I know."

"When she lays down her burdens, I'll be the one to help her reclaim that dream."

The tea had gone cold.

Gregory stood. "The tea's cold. We've said all there is to say."

Alexander didn't budge. "Don't bother seeing him out."

Outside, birds chirped in the golden sunlight.

Vincent clutched the teapot like it might become a weapon.

"What?" Alexander arched a brow.

"The—the tea's cold..."

Alexander chuckled darkly. "Afraid we'll come to blows?"

He adjusted his cufflinks with elegant precision.

Gregory buttoned his suit jacket. "Mr. Hamilton, if Evelyn chooses you, you have my blessing. If she doesn't... I'll wait. However long it takes for her to find herself again."
###Chapter 515: I'll Repay Evelyn's Debt to You

The air turned icy.

Vincent Wilson's eyes darted to his brother. "Gregory, didn't you say you have a consultation this afternoon?"

"No need to rush," Alexander Hamilton interrupted smoothly. "Since you're here, leaving so soon would make me a poor host."

Trapped between them, Vincent frantically signaled Gregory with his eyes.

Alexander sipped his tea. "Dr. Wilson seems troubled. Perhaps a few days in the mountains would help clear your mind. The fresh air is excellent for recuperation."

Gregory's gaze flickered. "Then I'll impose on your hospitality."

Beads of sweat formed on Vincent's forehead as he tugged his brother's sleeve.

"What's wrong?" Gregory asked impassively.

"I... I feel dizzy."

Gregory frowned. "Should I call a doctor?"

"No, no! Probably altitude sickness..."

As Vincent scrambled for excuses, his phone buzzed. Relief flooded his face as he checked the notification—then his eyes widened.

"Alex, why did you transfer me this much money? Let me count... Wait, there are even decimals?"

Alexander remained unperturbed. "Please forward it to Dr. Wilson. Interest calculated at the central bank's benchmark rate."

"Bro, you lent Alex money?"

"This concerns only Evelyn and me."

Alexander gently bounced the babbling toddler in his arms. "I'm repaying Evelyn's debt to you."

"Unnecessary." Gregory's expression darkened. "This is private between Evelyn and me."

"Then ask her yourself," Alexander murmured without looking up, tickling the giggling child. "See whose debt she'd rather owe."

......

Vivian Dempsey led Evelyn Carter along winding mountain paths until they found a secluded bench.

Sunlight dappled through the leaves as a breeze rustled the treetops.

"Evelyn," Vivian suddenly turned, "that Miss Liang... Did Alex really arrange her to help me?"

Evelyn explained everything.

"So... I misjudged him?" Vivian looked stunned. "He showed zero mercy before!"

"Manager Winston's proposal was objectively high-risk," Evelyn said carefully. "Alexander genuinely wanted to assist this time."

Vivian sat bolt upright. "He didn't demand anything, did he? Evelyn, don't sacrifice—"

"Relax," Evelyn gazed at the distant peaks. "I took nothing in the divorce. Certainly nothing now."

"Good." Vivian exhaled, then brightened. "How was the summit?"

Evelyn's eyes dimmed. "I fell ill upon arrival."

"There's always next year!" Vivian squeezed her shoulder. "Once Anderson Group stabilizes, you can return to the OB-GYN department."

Evelyn nodded faintly.

"One more thing..." Vivian hesitated. "When will you tell your adoptive parents about finding your birth parents?"

A mountain gust scattered fallen leaves. Evelyn watched one drift away, leaving the question unanswered.
###Chapter 516: The Fox's Tail

Evelyn's fingers twisted together unconsciously.

"My parents are getting older, and with everything that's happened recently..." Her voice was soft. "The house purchase has been one problem after another, and Emily's injuries haven't fully healed. Let's wait a while longer—until they've had time to recover—before I tell them."

Vivian nodded. "Your parents have loved you all these years. Finding out you're not biologically theirs will be hard for them. But if they see how well your birth parents treat you, they'll feel reassured."

Just then, a bright voice called out, "Evelyn!"

Lydia bounded over in light-colored casual wear. Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Isn't that Alexander's little fiancée? Wait—why is she here too?!"

Following her gaze, Evelyn saw Annabelle trailing behind Lydia, whispering something to her.

"Lydia, your status is different now. You need to mind your image," Annabelle's voice carried over.

Lydia immediately slowed her steps, walking properly up to them. "Hello, Evelyn. Hello, Vivian."

Vivian smirked coldly. "Miss Laurent, you should be careful who you befriend. Some people smile to your face while stabbing you in the back."

"Annabelle is really nice," Lydia blinked innocently. "Evelyn, is Alexander still at the hotel?"

Evelyn countered, "You haven't contacted him?"

"I didn’t want to come at first," Lydia stuck out her tongue playfully. "But Annabelle said Alexander was here alone with no one to take care of him. She said if I didn’t come, it might affect the relationship between Hamilton Group and Banyan Group."

Vivian scoffed. "Then why is she tagging along?"

Annabelle's expression flickered but quickly smoothed over. "Lydia is young. As her elder sister, of course I need to look after her."

"Are you looking after her—or using her?"

"Miss Dempsey, what an interesting way to phrase things."

"Dogs wouldn’t understand human speech anyway," Vivian jerked her chin toward the restaurant. "Alexander is inside discussing business. If you want him, go in yourself."

Lydia hesitated. "Wouldn’t that disturb his meeting? Annabelle, why don’t you go check? You’re so capable—you could definitely help."

Annabelle paused thoughtfully. "Fine. You wait here."

Once Annabelle was out of earshot, Vivian stomped her foot in frustration. "Does that woman really think everyone else is blind?"

Evelyn gestured subtly to remind her Lydia was still present.

Grudgingly, Vivian moved aside. "Have a seat, Miss Laurent."

Lydia sat down obediently. "Is there some misunderstanding between you and Annabelle?"

"What misunderstanding could I possibly have with her?" Vivian rolled her eyes. "You, on the other hand—watch out or you’ll end up being someone else’s pawn."

Lydia pointed cheerfully at her head. "I’m very smart, you know."

Evelyn observed Lydia quietly.

Ever since Sophia’s warning, she’d been paying close attention to the girl’s every move.

That day, Alexander had clearly shown disgust toward Annabelle and specifically told Lydia to stay away from her. If Lydia hadn’t told her, how would Annabelle have known Alexander was here?

On the surface, it seemed like Annabelle was using the opportunity to get close to Alexander, but in reality...

Evelyn’s gaze lingered on Lydia’s guileless smile.

Sure enough, it wasn’t long before Alexander stormed out with a dark expression, the baby in his arms. Annabelle followed behind him, her eyes red.

"What are you doing here?" Alexander quickly moved to Evelyn’s side.

Evelyn glanced past him. "Did Dr. Wilson and the others leave?"

"Yeah," Alexander’s tone was grim. "Are you done here? The baby needs to be fed."

Lydia called out timidly, "Alexander..."

Alexander nodded curtly. "I’ll have your father send someone to pick you up later. In the future, consult him before acting. Don’t listen to outsiders giving you orders."

Lydia looked at Annabelle. "Annabelle, why are you crying? Alexander, how could you—"

Annabelle’s gaze locked onto Evelyn, burning with hatred.

Alexander stepped protectively in front of Evelyn. "Mr. Anderson chose to hand An Group over to Evelyn. She never tried to take anything from you."

"Now that she’s the one you cherish most, of course you’d defend her!"

"Exactly," Alexander’s voice was icy. "So don’t provoke her."

Annabelle’s voice trembled. "Are you really going to destroy me completely? I have no job, no income—what about over twenty years of friendship—"

"That friendship was built on lies," Alexander’s eyes were sharp. "If not for Mr. Anderson’s sake, do you think someone who deceived me would still be standing here unharmed?"

Annabelle’s face went deathly pale. "Would you kill me for her?"

Lydia hurriedly grabbed Alexander’s arm. "Alexander, don’t be like this..."

Then she reached for Evelyn’s hand. "Evelyn, please talk to him—"

Annabelle’s expression twisted viciously.

A sudden realization struck Evelyn.

If both she and Annabelle were gone...

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Lydia gazing up at Alexander, an odd light glinting in her eyes.
###Chapter 517: Must You Draw Such Clear Boundaries?

Her arm was suddenly nudged.

Evelyn turned to meet Vivian's astonished gaze.

She gave a slight nod to indicate understanding.

After Annabelle's "socialist brotherhood" rhetoric, Lydia's petty schemes were transparent as glass.

"Vixen," Vivian muttered through clenched teeth.

"Why is Sister Evelyn so quiet?" Lydia blinked her innocent doe eyes.

Alexander frowned and interrupted: "This has nothing to do with Evelyn."

"True, it's between Brother Alexander and Sister Annabelle." Lydia nodded obediently, then shot Evelyn a meaningful look. "Sister Evelyn wouldn't interfere, right?"

Evelyn chuckled softly and walked deliberately toward Annabelle. "Miss Taylor, are you here today to have Mr. Hamilton arbitrate the division of the Taylor family assets?"

Hatred churned in Annabelle's eyes. "Our parents are both ill. Alexander has been managing the company."

"Acting as caretaker only." Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "Taylor Group ultimately belongs to Anthony and Teresa Taylor. Mr. Hamilton has no authority to dispose of it."

"Stop pretending to be noble!" Annabelle sneered. "Calling him 'Mr. Hamilton' now clearly shows you're guarding against him. You use his connections but refuse to open your heart. Wake up, Alexander!"

Alexander approached with the child and took Evelyn's hand. "Let's go."

"Wait." Evelyn shook off his grip, staring directly at Annabelle. "If it were me, I'd take the money and leave. The Taylors raised you all these years, and Mr. Hamilton honors past affections—that's already the best outcome. If you keep pushing..."

Her peripheral glance at Lydia turned icy. "Be careful playing with fire."

"You stole everything from me and expect me to accept it?" Annabelle became hysterical. "I'll go to Mom and Dad! They love me most—"

"Evelyn!" Vivian rushed over in alarm. "You're so pale!"

Alexander immediately set down the child to examine her. "Where does it hurt?"

The world spun before Evelyn's eyes, darkness flickering at the edges of her vision.

"Faking illness?" Annabelle mocked. "Even Dr. Carter resorts to such cheap tricks?"

Lydia leaned in for closer inspection. "Is Sister Evelyn truly unwell?"

Evelyn weakly curved her lips. "Disappointed, Miss Laurent?"

Lydia's expression stiffened before quickly reverting to innocence. "Your health comes first, sister."

Alexander studied Lydia thoughtfully.

"Mr. Hamilton." Evelyn's breath was faint. "Please ask a waitress to assist me."

"Still drawing lines at a time like this?" Alexander simply swept her up into his arms.

"Don't—" Evelyn's stomach churned violently. "Put me down—"

Her feet barely touched the ground before she vomited.

Alexander gently patted her back. "You were fine this morning. What happened?"

Vivian held the child nervously. "Should we go to the hospital?"

"Can't Dr. Carter diagnose herself?" Lydia asked with feigned concern.

Annabelle sneered. "Hard to diagnose a fake illness."

"Enough!" Alexander snapped.

Evelyn retched up bile, then weakly met Lydia's gaze. "Apologies for ruining your plans, Miss Laurent."

Lydia's smile froze. "You jest, sister."

Suddenly Alexander lifted Evelyn facing him, letting her rest against his shoulder.

The scent of citrus enveloped her.

"Better?" he murmured.

"...Yes."

Alexander instructed Vivian: "Please watch the child. Ask the front desk if you need anything."

Before leaving, he gave Lydia a cold look. "Tell your father it's time to announce the canceled engagement."
###Chapter 518: This Time, I Won't Go Back on My Word

Lydia Laurent's face drained of color.

Alexander Hamilton carried Evelyn Carter away without a backward glance, his silhouette resolute.

Back in their room, Evelyn's dizziness intensified.

She staggered into the bathroom, another wave of nausea wracking her body.

Alexander's brow furrowed as he pulled out his phone.

"Who are you calling?" Evelyn asked weakly.

"An ambulance."

"Overreacting." She splashed cold water on her face. "I'm fine."

His knuckles whitened around the phone.

Finally, he set it down and handed her tissues.

Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa, a sheen of sweat glistening on her forehead.

Alexander leaned over, dabbing her skin with the gentleness reserved for fragile porcelain.

"Overworked lately?"

"Mmm."

She reached for the tissue, but he moved it away.

"Stay still."

Evelyn closed her eyes, surrendering to his care.

"Not like hypoglycemia." His voice tightened. "Food poisoning?"

"Hotel dinner last night." Her lips curled bitterly. "Mr. Hamilton should inspect his kitchens."

"I'll—"

"Forget it." She waved him off. "Probably not that."

Alexander's fingers trembled slightly. "After the last miscarriage—"

"Vivian took good care of me." She cut him off.

He carefully brushed damp strands from her forehead.

"Better now?"

"Mmm."

"You can self-diagnose, can't you?"

Evelyn's eyes flew open.

"Where's the baby?"

"With Vivian." Understanding flashed across his face. "I'll get her. Can you manage alone?"

"Yes."

He set a glass of water on the coffee table and hurried out.

Ten minutes later, he returned with a babbling toddler and a bag of candy.

The little one squealed with delight at the sight of Evelyn.

"Have some sugar first." He offered a lollipop.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Five-star hotels sell these now?"

"...Yes."

She selected a plain flavor.

"Where's Vivian?"

"She'll come after Bianca Langley leaves the mountain."

"And Lydia?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "The engagement termination announcement goes out soon."

"No more deception this time?"

"Never." His gaze burned into hers. "Never again."

"What about later?" she asked suddenly. "If I return to the hospital?"

"I'll drive you, same as before."

"Two years of rural medical missions?"

"I'm coming."

A soft laugh escaped her.

Could this pampered heir truly endure such hardship?

......

The night brought relentless nightmares.

Gunfire. Deserts. Endless fleeing.

Each time she jolted awake, her pajamas clung to her skin, drenched in sweat.

At dawn, the doorbell chimed.

"Room service."

The cart overflowed with an extravagant breakfast spread.

"I didn't order this."

"Mr. Hamilton arranged it." The server smiled. "He said he'll finish whatever you don't eat."

"Where is he?"

"Next door, in a meeting." The server produced an elegant box. "And this."
###Chapter 519: The Panic of a Missed Period

The waitress retrieved several packages from the bottom shelf of the service cart and placed them gently on the nightstand.

It was Evelyn Carter's usual brand of sanitary pads.

Both day and night versions were provided.

"Mr. Hamilton specifically requested these, saying you might need them soon."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

She recalled that conversation about sanitary pads with Lydia Laurent in the car.

He remembered such a small detail.

"Miss Carter, is there anything else you need?"

"No, thank you."

"I'll take my leave then. I'll return later to clear the dishes."

Evelyn suddenly called out, "Does the hotel sell lollipops?"

The waitress hesitated. "Would you like me to purchase some for you?"

"No, I was just curious."

Then where had Alexander gotten those lollipops last night...

"Miss Carter, would you like some brown sugar tea? Though Mr. Hamilton didn't mention it—"

"What's today's date?"

"The 18th."

The 18th.

Her cycle had always been regular.

She usually experienced backaches and bloating beforehand.

But this time, three days late with no symptoms.

A terrifying thought flashed through her mind.

Evelyn's face drained of color.

"Miss Carter! I'll fetch Mr. Hamilton immediately—"

"No!" Evelyn grabbed her wrist. "Call me a car. I need to go to the hospital."

"But Mr. Hamilton instructed—"

"Tell him I'm visiting my sister."

The waitress nodded hesitantly and left.

With shaking hands, Evelyn tore open a lollipop and shoved it into her mouth.

The sweetness spread across her tongue.

Her hands trembled so violently that the sweater she'd picked up slipped to the floor.

......

Alexander Hamilton's office.

Mr. Laurent wiped sweat from his temple. "Mr. Hamilton, regarding the engagement..."

"The business partnership continues." Alexander focused on feeding water to the child in his arms. "Only the engagement is canceled."

"But Lydia—"

"Mr. Laurent," Alexander met his gaze, "your daughter is no longer a child."

Mr. Laurent wrung his hands. "I just worry she might fall for the wrong—"

"So you want me to take responsibility?"

"No! It's just that Lydia's so naive—"

"Naive?" Alexander chuckled. "Do you truly know your daughter, Mr. Laurent?"

Mr. Laurent fell silent.

Alexander checked his watch. "The press release goes out simultaneously. Legal is finalizing the partnership details."

"Mr. Hamilton!" Mr. Laurent blurted. "Is there really no chance for Lydia?"

"My heart belongs to someone else."

"Who?"

"Ask your daughter." Alexander stood, cradling the child. "She knows very well."
###Chapter 520: Sudden Discomfort

Evelyn Carter's internal clock never missed a beat.

She should have been awake by now.

Alexander Hamilton carried the baby to Evelyn's hotel room, only to find the door wide open. The housekeeper was making the bed, but the room was empty—even the luggage had vanished.

"Where's the guest staying here?" His voice turned icy.

The housekeeper flinched at his expression. "M-Miss Carter checked out early this morning..."

"Where did she go?"

"She said she was visiting her sister at the hospital..."

The tension in Alexander's shoulders eased slightly. Evelyn had been worried about Emily Anderson ever since returning from the capital. Visiting her made sense.

"What time did she leave?"

"About... half an hour ago."

Thirty minutes. Enough time for Evelyn to leave the mountains and reach the city. Alexander immediately pulled out his phone and dialed her number.

Beep—

The mechanical tone rang in his ear.

No answer.

His grip tightened unconsciously. He knew Evelyn—either she wasn't checking her phone, or she was deliberately ignoring him. Either way, calling again was pointless.

Yet the inexplicable unease in his chest only grew stronger.

Standing in the barren room, flashes of Evelyn's pale face filled his mind. Then, a terrifying realization struck him—

The last time she'd disappeared without a word, she'd gone to the hospital for an abortion.

And yesterday's sudden nausea...

Alexander's blood ran cold.

He swiftly handed the baby to the hotel manager, gave brief instructions, and rushed to the parking lot. His hands trembled slightly as he started the car.

The entire drive, he kept dialing—first Evelyn, then Olivia Lightfoot when Evelyn didn't answer, then Vivian Dempsey when Olivia didn't pick up. Over and over, the calls went unanswered.

Only when he reached the city did Vivian finally call back.

"Miss Langley is back?" Her voice dripped with impatience.

"...No."

"Then why are you calling me?"

Alexander ignored her tone. "Is Evelyn with you?"

"No." Vivian's voice sharpened with alarm. "What's wrong with Evelyn? Did something happen?"

He hung up without answering.

At the OB-GYN Department of Central Hospital, a nurse blocked his path. "Sir, this is the maternity ward. Men aren't allowed—"

"I'm looking for Evelyn Carter." His voice was hoarse. "She used to work here."

The nurse recoiled at his bloodshot eyes. "D-Dr. Carter is in Dr. Lightfoot's office..."

The door burst open just as Olivia was whispering something to Evelyn.

"Holy—!" Olivia jumped. "What the hell is your toxic ex doing here?"

Alexander's gaze locked onto Evelyn. Only when he confirmed she was unharmed did the tension in his shoulders ease slightly.

"This is a hospital!" Olivia stepped protectively in front of Evelyn. "You break it, you pay for it!"

"Fine." His voice was rough. "Any amount."

He strode to Evelyn, his eyes dropping to her flat stomach. His Adam's apple bobbed violently.

Evelyn looked up at his red-rimmed eyes and frowned. "Didn't reception tell you? I came to see Emily."

His breathing remained ragged. When he spoke, the words were barely audible. "Is it...?"

"It's not what you think." She turned away. "Just stress delaying my cycle."

Alexander seized her wrist. "Don't lie to me."

Evelyn pointed to the test results on the desk. "See for yourself."

His stare remained fixed on her abdomen, as if trying to see through fabric to the truth.
###Chapter 521: I've Imagined This Scene Before

Olivia Lightfoot slammed the test report onto the desk. "HCG levels below 5. Zero chance of pregnancy. Don't believe me? That's your problem."

Alexander Hamilton picked up the report, his brow furrowing.

"Can eight days be detected now?"

"Seven is enough." Olivia glared. "Are you accusing me of falsifying reports?"

"You helped with the last abortion. No hospital records exist."

Olivia slammed her palm on the desk. "How dare you bring that up?! Fabricating records would cost me my medical license!"

Alexander took a deep breath. "My apologies. I didn't mean to question your integrity—"

Evelyn Carter stood abruptly. "Olivia has work to do. Let's talk outside."

Alexander suddenly gripped her wrist.

"What are you doing?"

"Knowing you, you'd placate me first, then find a way to terminate later." His voice tightened. "I won't make that mistake again."

Evelyn met his gaze. "There's no pregnancy this time."

"I can't trust that."

Olivia interjected, "Want another test now? I'll write the order."

"A different hospital." Alexander's tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn yanked her hand free. "Do I look clairvoyant? Could I have faked results in advance?"

Alexander lowered his lashes. "That kind of pain... once was enough."

The words stabbed Evelyn's heart. Memories flooded back—the frigid bathroom, burning pills stuck in her throat.

Olivia stamped her foot. "This is OB-GYN! There are expectant mothers next door!"

Without warning, Alexander scooped Evelyn into his arms and strode out.

Instinctively, she looped her arms around his neck.

"Put me down!"

Ignoring her, he carried her to the parking lot and gently deposited her in the passenger seat. He removed his jacket, folded it into a square, and carefully tucked it beneath her abdomen.

"Really necessary?" Evelyn scoffed.

"Multiple tests." He fastened her seatbelt. "Too tight?"

Eastside Hospital's results came in thirty minutes. Evelyn leaned against the wall, watching Alexander's knuckles whiten around the lab sheet.

"Accurate?" His voice rasped.

The doctor frowned. "Basic bloodwork."

"Let's go." Evelyn turned.

"One more hospital."

After five hospitals, the final physician tactfully suggested, "Sir, perhaps you should visit urology?"

In the car, Evelyn folded the stack of reports into paper airplanes.

"These blood draws were easier than those pills that day."

Alexander slammed the brakes.

"I sat on the toilet that night," Evelyn gazed out the window, "pills clutched in my hand, waiting for the door to crash open."

The paper airplane trembled in her fingers.

"I imagined you bursting in, flushing the pills, taking my hand saying 'Let's go home.'"

Alexander's knuckles turned bone-white.

"The pills stuck in my throat. So bitter I cried." She released the airplane, watching it nosedive onto the floor mat. "I wondered if it was our baby saying 'Don't leave me, Mommy.'"

In the rearview mirror, Alexander's tears splashed onto the steering wheel.
###Chapter 522: I Want to Walk Beside You

Evelyn's words were like poisoned daggers.

Each sentence pierced Alexander's deepest wounds with precision.

He couldn't bear to remember that day.

Her frail figure stood at the hospital entrance in the bitter wind, clutching a blood-soaked tissue.

That wound would never heal.

Every midnight, her resolute eyes haunted his dreams as she handed him that gruesome "gift."

But now another image consumed him—

Her swallowing pills in that cramped bathroom, still staring at the door.

Waiting.

For a miracle that might never come.

Evelyn suddenly laughed. "Seeing you suffer actually comforts me."

Alexander's throat worked. "I...don't know what to say to..."

"Make amends?" she cut in. "Pain is pain. No amount of compensation erases it."

Her fingers brushed her abdomen. "I acted unprofessionally today. As a doctor, I shouldn't have made that mistake."

"Because that child is our shared scar."

"That's why I couldn't hold Miss Langley's baby..." Her voice feathered away. "I feared losing again."

Alexander tore off his glasses, scrubbing his face roughly.

"I wasn't thinking clearly."

Evelyn gazed out the window. "Life is endless farewells. People come and go."

"Let me walk this path with you."

She scoffed. "What if I marry someone else?"

"You won't."

"How can you be so sure?"

"You're too proud." His eyes locked onto hers. "You don't love me, and you won't love anyone else. You tried settling—that's how Peter happened. As for Gregory—"

"Enough."

Alexander smiled bitterly. "If you say it's over, then it's over. I won't ask for more."

Outside the window, the hospital's eternal drama played on—

An elderly mother pushing her paralyzed son.

A daughter begging doctors to save her father.

Everyone must learn to make peace with suffering.

"Next month, come with me to Rooster Temple."

"Okay."

"Just light incense for her."

"...Okay."

Silence engulfed the car.

The engine suddenly roared to life.

"Back to the hospital." Alexander's voice still shook. "We're finding out why you're vomiting."

At registration, the mighty Hamilton Group CEO fumbled like a schoolboy.

He got lost between floors, redirected by exasperated nurses.

Finally he returned sweating. "Evelyn, I need your ID."

She studied his damp shirt.

"What department are you registering for?"

"Internal medicine...Wrong? I'll ask again—"

"Alexander."

He froze.

Evelyn rose slowly. "I'm an OB-GYN."
###Chapter 523: He Knew Her Weakness Too Well

Evelyn studied him for a few seconds before silently pulling out her phone to book an appointment with a specialist.

Inside the examination room sat a familiar face.

"Dr. Wilson?" She forced a smile.

Dr. Wilson adjusted his glasses. "Dr. Carter? I thought it might be someone else with the same name when I saw the appointment."

"Not that many coincidences in the world." Evelyn pulled out a chair and sat down.

Alexander, standing nearby, tensed slightly.

Having heard hospital gossip, Dr. Wilson hesitated. "And this is...?"

"A friend." Her tone was flat.

Alexander didn’t correct her, cutting straight to the point. "She’s been unwell since yesterday. Vomited multiple times this morning."

Understanding, Dr. Wilson quickly wrote up lab orders.

Results came back swiftly.

"All indicators are normal," he chose his words carefully. "Likely psychogenic vomiting."

Alexander frowned. "Psychological?"

"Not that severe," Dr. Wilson clarified. "Just stress-related. Rest should help."

Evelyn nodded. "It’s been a busy time."

"I’ll prescribe some calming herbal medicine, along with dietary adjustments." He handed her the prescription. "You’re the expert—no need for me to elaborate."

"Thank you."

Alexander remained silent throughout. After paying and collecting the medication, he guided her out of the hospital.

By evening, they returned to the resort.

Alexander retrieved Baby Chloe from the childcare center, where the little one slept soundly.

Evelyn checked her, relieved to see the baby’s rosy cheeks and tiny lips smacking contentedly before retreating to her room.

Files sent by Vincent Wilson cluttered the desk.

Delayed by recent events, she was behind schedule.

She’d just picked up a document when the door was blocked.

"You need rest." Alexander stood in the doorway.

"I’ll sleep after reviewing these."

"Dr. Wilson said you must eat on time."

"..."

"I can’t handle her when she wakes." He added quietly.

Evelyn didn’t move.

Alexander strode in, gathered the files, and reached for her hand—then stopped. Instead, he murmured, "Come on."

Back in his suite, Baby Chloe had woken, kicking off her blanket.

"Hungry?" Alexander lifted her with practiced ease.

The baby blinked her big eyes at Evelyn, babbling in baby talk.

Evelyn stroked her cheek. "She just napped briefly."

Alexander prepared warm water, but the baby squirmed toward the door.

"She wants to go out?"

As they puzzled, the daytime caregiver smiled. "She finds the room stuffy."

Dusk settled outside.

"I’ll take her to the garden," Alexander said.

The caregiver beamed. "Madam should join. Fathers aren’t as attentive as mothers."

"She’s not my wife."

"But everyone says—"

"We were." Evelyn cut in.

The caregiver nodded knowingly. "Little ones sense things best."

After she left, Alexander asked, "Coming?"

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "Let’s eat first."

She dug a tiny jacket from her luggage. As she slid one sleeve on, Alexander wordlessly supported the baby’s other arm.

The baby giggled delightedly.

Once dressed, Chloe clung to Alexander, refusing to be put down.

"Let’s go." He opened the door.

Evelyn knew his game.

Using the child as leverage so she couldn’t refuse.

And it worked—she could never harden her heart around their baby.
###Chapter 524: A Man's Pride

Evelyn set down her fork after barely touching her dinner.

The crisp early autumn air in the garden filled her lungs, washing away the heaviness in her chest.

"Oxygen levels peak at dusk," Alexander murmured, cradling the baby with one arm while naturally reaching for her hand. "Walking helps clear the mind."

She glanced at their intertwined fingers. "Basic middle school geography."

"Which makes it even more essential for a doctor to remember." His thumb traced slow circles on her knuckles.

Evelyn tried pulling away. "I should get back to my study. You stay with the baby."

The slight tug disturbed little Chloe. The infant squirmed, stretching chubby arms toward Evelyn.

"...Mama."

The tiny voice sent a tremor through Evelyn's heart.

Alexander tightened his hold, but Chloe's lips quivered, tears pooling in her wide eyes.

"Shh, don't cry." Evelyn immediately took the child.

Instantly, the baby giggled, distracted by twinkling garden lights.

Alexander followed closely behind them on the cobblestone path. "Mind the steps," he cautioned softly.

A night breeze carried floral fragrances.

"She adores you," Alexander observed, watching Chloe's rapt expression.

Evelyn squeezed the tiny hand. "She's confused. Bianca and I both have long hair—infant vision isn't fully developed yet."

At the mention of children, shadows crossed both their faces.

"Bianca's remarkably brave," Evelyn said quietly. "Choosing to raise a child alone despite her marriage... I couldn't have done it."

Old wounds throbbed beneath her ribs.

"Different circumstances." Alexander's gaze turned distant. "The Langley family provides her safety net. And her relationship with Vincent... isn't like ours."

"Because we're divorced?"

"Their divorce won't happen anytime soon." His voice lowered. "Too many financial entanglements. They'll keep playing the perfect couple in public, no matter how much they despise each other."

Evelyn's chest constricted. "Bianca deserves better."

Alexander changed the subject. "The crucial difference is intent. I want to rebuild with you. But Vincent... he'd rather never see Bianca or Chloe again."

"His own flesh and blood?"

"Perhaps the child represents his shame."

Evelyn froze.

"Vincent shares Peter's ambition and capability," Alexander chose his words carefully. "But he's more transparent. He married Bianca openly for the Langley resources."

"And she... agreed?"

"A transactional arrangement." Alexander sighed. "Now that he's successful, those early compromises haunt him."

Understanding dawned.

Poverty had made marital opportunism acceptable. Now, those memories festered like splinters—with Bianca and Chloe as living reminders.

Chloe suddenly grasped Evelyn's finger, beaming with innocent joy.

"Adult conflicts punishing an innocent child..." Evelyn's voice cracked.

The words pierced them both.

At least they'd stopped before reaching that point.

"She's too young to remember," Alexander soothed. "Vincent barely appeared at the christening."

A fountain burst to life, water droplets refracting rainbow hues under the lights. Chloe clapped excitedly, momentarily lightening the mood.

Evelyn stepped back with the baby, suddenly smiling. "Bianca Langley and Vincent Croix. Ice and fire. Perhaps their fate was written from the start."

"You believe in that?" Alexander arched a brow.

"Grandma Hamilton said she saw our child before passing." Evelyn gazed at the stars. "Since then, I've felt certain threads are preordained."

Moonlight glinted off Alexander's bobbing Adam's apple.
###Chapter 525: When Ice Meets Fire

The setting sun cast long shadows of three figures along the garden path.

Evelyn Carter cradled the baby, softly humming a lullaby. The infant giggled in her arms, tiny hands reaching for the strands of hair that had slipped loose.

A sudden cold gust swept through.

Evelyn instinctively looked up to see a tall figure approaching. The man wore a tailored dark gray suit, his polished shoes clicking sharply against the cobblestones.

His presence seemed to drop the temperature around them.

The baby's laughter ceased abruptly. Her face scrunched up before she burst into loud wails. Evelyn tightened her hold protectively, eyes wary as they locked onto the newcomer.

Alexander Hamilton stepped forward, shielding them both.

"Mr. Croix."

The man halted. His gaze lingered on the child in Evelyn's arms for a brief second before flickering away.

"Mr. Hamilton. What a coincidence."

His voice carried the bite of winter, even this simple greeting laced with frost.

The baby cried harder, her face flushing crimson. Evelyn gently patted her back, turning slightly to block the man's piercing stare.

"You're frightening her," Alexander said, his tone darkening.

Vincent Croix's lips twitched. "Apologies. It's simply my nature."

His features were undeniably striking, but the shadows between his brows made direct eye contact unbearable. His pallid skin looked almost translucent in the twilight, giving him the appearance of a statue carved from ice.

It struck Evelyn then—this was Bianca Langley's so-called "ex-husband."

"Where is Bianca?" Vincent cut straight to the point.

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "Mountain climbing."

"And she left the child with you?"

"Yes."

Vincent gave a curt nod and turned to leave, as though staying another moment would be an intolerable waste.

"Wait." Alexander's voice stopped him. "This is your daughter."

Vincent's back stiffened for a fraction of a second before he regained composure. He didn't turn around. Just a detached "Hmm" escaped him.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure dissolve into the gathering dusk, an inexplicable tightness gripping her chest.

The baby's cries gradually subsided, her tiny fists still clutching Evelyn's collar, tear droplets clinging to her lashes.

"It's alright, sweetheart," Evelyn murmured, though her heart ached for Bianca's misfortune.

Alexander reached over, his touch impossibly tender as he wiped the child's tears away.

"How could they ever have been together?" Evelyn couldn't help asking.

Alexander stared at where Vincent had disappeared, expression unreadable. "Some people only realize what they've lost when it's gone."

A night breeze stirred, carrying the first chill of evening.

Evelyn bundled the baby closer in her coat, lips curling bitterly. "When he's old and sick, he'll regret abandoning his daughter."

"No." Alexander shook his head. "That's not what he'll regret losing."

"Then what?"

"Bianca."

Evelyn froze.

Alexander's quiet words carried unmistakable clarity: "The deeper his hatred burns now, the more it will destroy him later."

Street lamps flickered on suddenly, illuminating his profound gaze.

"How do you know?"

A wry smile touched his lips. "Because I was once that blind."
###Chapter 526: I'm Coming With You

The crystal chandelier in the hotel corridor cast shimmering reflections across the marble floor.

Evelyn Carter cradled the baby as she hurried past the restaurant entrance without a single glance inside.

Alexander Hamilton caught up in three quick strides. "At least have some soup before you go."

He reached for the child. The baby immediately stretched out tiny arms and nestled into his embrace.

Watching their affectionate interaction, the phrase "father-daughter bond" flashed through Evelyn's mind. She quickly dismissed the absurd thought. "I'm tired."

"What did the doctor say?" Alexander balanced the baby with one arm while grasping her wrist with the other.

"The medical advice didn't include having dinner with you." Evelyn tried pulling free.

Alexander didn't budge. "What if she wakes up hungry at midnight? You'll order formula from room service?"

At the far end of the restaurant, waitstaff were setting a table before floor-to-ceiling windows.

Alexander settled into a seat with the baby, but Evelyn deliberately chose the farthest diagonal chair.

"Miss Carter," a server approached with a cart, "Mr. Hamilton specially arranged this nutritional menu."

Twelve delicate dishes fanned out across the table, centered around six steaming soup terrines.

Evelyn frowned at the feast. "Feeding a pig?"

"I skipped lunch too." Alexander calmly tied a bib around the baby's neck. "Try the mushroom soup. The chef was brought in from Yunnan."

When the aroma of black chicken soup wafted over, Evelyn's stomach finally surrendered.

As she sipped the broth, she suddenly asked, "What's this chef's salary?"

"Impressed?" Alexander placed steamed fish on her plate. "I'll give him a raise tomorrow."

The baby suddenly babbled and slapped the table.

Evelyn set down her spoon. "Feeding time."

Alexander had already prepared the bottle with practiced efficiency, as if he'd done it countless times.

Just as the nipple touched the baby's lips, exaggerated laughter erupted from the entrance.

"Mr. Hamilton! What a coincidence!" Leonard Laurent dragged his daughter forward. "Lydia wanted to try the chef's specialties—we never expected to see you here!"

Lydia Laurent peeked timidly from behind her father. "Alexander... Evelyn..."

Alexander didn't look up. "Something urgent?"

"We came to thank Miss Carter for last time—"

"Unnecessary." Alexander cut him off. "She's helped too many people to remember."

Evelyn stood with the baby. "Enjoy your conversation."

Alexander grabbed the diaper bag. "I'm coming with you."

Lydia suddenly darted in front of Evelyn. "Your baby is adorable!" Her hand shot out toward the infant's face.

Evelyn pivoted away as the startled baby flinched at the shrill voice.

"Miss Laurent," Evelyn shielded the child, "if you need something, speak to Mr. Hamilton. Don't frighten the baby."
###Chapter 527: A Timely Offer

Lydia Laurent took a half-step back, startled by Evelyn Carter's sudden coldness. Her fingers twisted nervously at her skirt hem as her eyes reddened slightly. "Evelyn, did I say something wrong?"

Evelyn adjusted Baby Chloe in her arms. "No."

Alexander Hamilton intervened smoothly. "Mr. Laurent, the restaurant will be closing soon."

Leonard Laurent's gaze lingered on Evelyn before he smiled abruptly. "Miss Carter, I heard you're quite close with Vivian Dempsey from Dempsey Group?"

Evelyn lifted her eyes. "You're well-informed."

"Here's the thing," Leonard rubbed his hands together, "one of our production lines malfunctioned. We'd like to borrow Dempsey's backup equipment. If Miss Dempsey agrees, we're willing to split profits 60-40."

Evelyn gently patted the baby's back. "Their official website lists contact information."

"It's just..." Leonard gave an awkward chuckle, "our companies have some...history. A direct approach might lead to rejection. If you could facilitate an introduction..."

Alexander cut in sharply. "Mr. Laurent, is Dempsey Group experiencing cash flow issues?"

Leonard's expression froze. "I...only just heard about it."

Evelyn slipped the bottle into the baby's mouth without looking up. "I'll relay your request to Vivian, but she doesn't have decision-making authority."

"That would be greatly appreciated!" Leonard beamed. "If we get the equipment, we can adjust to 70-30!"

Lydia inched forward timidly. "Evelyn, your baby is adorable. May I—"

"No." Evelyn shut her down immediately.

Tears welled in Lydia's eyes as she glanced pleadingly at Alexander. He merely signaled a waiter. "Escort Mr. Laurent to the VIP lounge."

Once the Laurents were gone, Evelyn immediately stood with the baby. "I'm returning to our room."

Alexander caught her wrist. "They're suspicious?"

"That production line excuse was laughably transparent." Evelyn's lips curled coldly. "Dempsey Group does need capital, but not enough to collaborate with competitors."

Baby Chloe suddenly reached for Alexander with a gurgle. As he took her, his fingers brushed Evelyn's hand. "Miss Langley's investment arrives next week."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "They don't know?"

"Clearly not." Alexander bounced the baby lightly. "Leonard moved too hastily."

Evelyn grabbed the diaper bag. "I'll call Vivian."

Back in the suite, Evelyn had just laid the baby down when she began whimpering. Quickly retrieving a fresh diaper, Evelyn performed the change with practiced ease.

The doorbell rang as Evelyn studied the baby's face—her sharp brows mirroring Vincent Croix's, but those dimples when she smiled were all Evelyn.

Alexander stood at the doorway when she answered. "That was fast."

"Mm." He handed her a bag of baby supplies. "Leonard plans to visit Elder Dempsey personally."

Evelyn accepted the bag with a scoff. "The equipment was never the real objective."

Alexander suddenly reached to tuck a stray lock behind her ear. "You've got powdered milk in your hair."

The intimate gesture froze them both. The baby's delighted giggles broke the tension. Evelyn stepped back hastily. "I...need to prepare her bottle."

Alexander remained in the entryway. "Need help?"

"No." She turned toward the kitchenette. "Unless...you want to see her?"

He approached the crib, gently stroking the baby's cheek. She immediately grabbed his finger to chew.

"She's teething." His voice softened.

Evelyn paused while mixing formula. "Started last week."

Silence settled over the room, punctuated only by the baby's coos. Milky lamplight enveloped the trio, casting interlaced shadows across the floor.
###Chapter 528: First Signs of Doubt

Alexander Hamilton stood by the crib, gazing tenderly at the little one. Baby Chloe wore a pink onesie, fluffy as a bunny, babbling while waving her tiny hands.

He picked up a rattle and gently shook it.

The clear chime immediately caught her attention. Her chubby fingers reached out, nearly bringing it to her mouth before Alexander swiftly intercepted, replacing it with a plush toy.

The room filled with her delighted giggles.

Only when she grew tired did Alexander hang a rotating musical mobile above the crib. Sitting beside her, he kept a hand ready to prevent her from rolling over. "You acted differently toward Lydia today," he mused.

Evelyn Carter paused while organizing baby supplies. "That obvious?"

"No." He shook his head. "But I remember you used to say she was as innocent as a greenhouse flower. Today, though..."

"People change." Her tone was even.

Alexander studied her eyes. "Did you discover something?"

Evelyn set down the clothes and faced him. "Alexander, answer me first."

"Go ahead."

"If I told you Lydia isn’t as innocent as she seems, would you believe me?"

The question unlocked a flood of memories.

A similar conversation had once been the spark that destroyed their marriage.

Regret flashed across Evelyn’s face. She laughed bitterly. "Never mind. Forget I asked."

She had long learned not to expect anything.

But this time, Alexander was firm. "I believe you."

Evelyn’s head snapped up.

His gaze was steady and warm. "Evelyn, I trust you."

Her lips trembled. "...Who knows if it’s true," she whispered.

The mobile’s lullaby drowned out her words.

Alexander only saw her lips move. "What did you say?"

"Nothing." She tucked a loose strand behind her ear. "Thank you for trusting me. But I have no proof—just a feeling."

"No proof needed." His response was immediate. "If you say it, I believe you."

Evelyn froze.

This unconditional trust had come far too late.

"What are your plans regarding Dempsey Group?" Alexander shifted the topic.

Evelyn thought for a moment. "I don’t understand business enough to judge. But now that their funding issues are resolved, securing orders is the priority. I’ll share my thoughts with Vivian and let her decide."

"She should learn to make executive decisions," Alexander agreed.

Evelyn fell silent, resolving to look deeper into the Laurent family’s records.

"Waah—!" Baby Chloe suddenly cooed, as if trying to sing along.

Both adults turned.

The little one flailed her arms, mumbling: "Buh... Bah-buh!"

Alexander went rigid, as if struck by lightning.

"Bah-buh!" She grew more excited.

His eyes reddened instantly. "What... is she saying?"

"Uncle," Evelyn said calmly.

"Oh. Uncle." His voice shook.

"Mm."

She rarely saw him so undone.

"Alexander?"

No response.

He seemed frozen, his gaze impossibly tender.

After several calls, he finally blinked, his lashes casting shadows across his face.

Baby Chloe waved happily.

Evelyn waved back, cherishing these moments—knowing Bianca Langley would return tomorrow.

Alexander found his voice again. "I... misheard. Thought she said 'Daddy.'"

"Her pronunciation isn’t clear, but she got the title right. You’re her uncle."

"No one taught her. She just knew." His smile was distant.

"Mm."

"Evelyn," he asked suddenly, "when do babies usually start saying 'Daddy'?"

"Between seven months to over a year."

He fell silent, as if calculating.

"If..." His throat worked. "She’d be one year and two months now. Should’ve called me 'Daddy' long ago."

He should have heard it much sooner.

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "No."

"I know." His smile was pained. "I know."

"I mean," she took a breath, "you forgot the pregnancy timeline. She was conceived four weeks in, born eight months later. She’s only six months old—too young to speak."

"...Right." He pressed urgently, "Does she have teeth yet?"

"Should by now."

"Still only on milk? No solids?"

"No."

"Even with teeth?"

Evelyn turned away, her voice low. "A six-month-old’s digestive system isn’t ready for solids."

Alexander nodded.

"Why ask?"

"No reason." Softly, he added, "Next month at Rooster Temple, I’ll bring formula."

"Mm." She paused. "And some toys."

"Okay."

Suddenly, Vincent Croix came to mind. A pang of bitterness followed.

At least Vincent’s daughter was real.

His... wasn’t.
###Chapter 529 The Sandwich Generation

"Evelyn." Alexander's voice was low when he suddenly spoke. "Do you think... if I ask Bianca to be Baby Chloe's godfather, she'd agree?"

"..." Evelyn kept folding the baby clothes without looking up. "That depends on your relationship."

"We've known each other since childhood. Don't meet often, but we're on good terms."

"Then ask her yourself." Evelyn placed the neatly folded clothes into a storage box. "But remember, blood ties matter. No matter how terrible the biological father is, he's still her dad."

Alexander's eyes darkened. "I know."

"Or..." Evelyn finally looked up. "Are you aiming to be her stepfather?"

He frowned. "Don't be ridiculous."

A cheerful children's melody drifted from the musical mobile.

Evelyn listened carefully and finally understood why the baby had suddenly learned to say "Daddy."

The mobile kept repeating: "Daddy's daddy is Grandpa..."

Alexander heard it too.

His expression shifted.

"Daddy..." The baby cooed again, this time with startling clarity.

Alexander crouched down and gently pinched her chubby cheek. "Learn to say 'Mommy' first."

He added silently: Your real father wouldn't be happy hearing that.

Evelyn sighed.

Where would Bianca and Vincent's marriage lead? A facade of stability, or complete separation?

Either way, this child's childhood would lack paternal love.

"Your concerns back then were justified," Alexander murmured.

Evelyn remained silent.

They understood each other without words.

How would such an adorable child face a cold, indifferent father when she grew up?

Vincent was successful now. Other women and children might enter the picture.

Where would that leave her?

Just imagining it made Alexander's chest tighten.

He glanced at Evelyn.

She was meticulously organizing the baby's clothes, movements gentle.

The tiny garments still carried traces of milky fragrance.

...She was the one who truly ached for this child.

Losing interest in the mobile, the baby stretched out her arms for a hug.

Alexander produced a wind-up plush bird from a bag and twisted the key.

"Chirp chirp!"

Instantly captivated, the baby reached for it.

"Did Miss Langley prepare this?" Evelyn asked.

"I bought it." He dangled the toy before the baby, then extended a hand. "Let me take care of her. You go handle your work—but don't overdo it."

Evelyn hesitated. "...When did you get this?"

"Last night."

"You went down the mountain?"

"No." Alexander shook his head. "With you and the baby here, I'm not going anywhere."

"Then where's the toy from?"

"The Kids' Wonderland area." He licked his lips, looking slightly abashed. "Bought it from a child."

Evelyn froze.

"The lollipop I gave you too."

"...How much did you pay?"

"Had no cash." Alexander admitted. "Kids don't understand money. I gave him my cufflink."

That cufflink was worth a small fortune.

"Though today at the restaurant, I saw him drop it down a drain."

Evelyn: "..."

"I've asked the front desk to compensate his mother when they see her."

"How much?"

"Ten thousand, plus waived accommodation fees for their stay."

"..."

When Evelyn stayed silent, Alexander grew anxious. "Not enough? Should I add more?"

"This is fine."

"Okay."

"I haven't reviewed the documents Vincent Wilson sent. I should get to that."

A flicker of disappointment crossed Alexander's eyes, but he nodded. "Alright."

Evelyn squeezed the baby's tiny hand. "Auntie will play with you later."

The baby's lips suddenly trembled, on the verge of tears.

Seizing the opportunity, Alexander caught Evelyn's wrist. "She needs you."

She pulled free. "I have work. Haven't touched those files since returning from the capital."

"Bring them here?"

"..."

"Or I could bring the baby to your room?" he proposed. "I'll keep her quiet."

Evelyn glanced between him and the teary-eyed baby, biting her lip.

"Better stay here." Alexander stood. "All her things are in this room—more convenient."

Before she could respond, he was already striding out. "I'll get your documents."

Moments later, Alexander returned with her files and favorite water cup.

After pouring warm water, he guided her to the study. "Work here. We'll stay outside."

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn finally sat down.

The rest had cleared her mind. She quickly sorted through the personnel files of Anderson Construction.

True to his word, Alexander kept disturbances minimal—just occasional laughter while playing with the baby.

At 9:30 PM, a knock interrupted. "Bedtime for the baby."

Evelyn paused the summit recording she'd just opened.

This child had a peculiar sleeping habit—needing to be the "filling" in a human sandwich.

Without someone lying on either side, she'd fuss endlessly.

When Alexander mentioned bedtime, his subtext was clear: Time to become sandwich bread.
###Chapter 530: Maximum Anti-Wolf Alert

Evelyn Carter looked down at the baby in her arms.

The little one clenched tiny fists, yawned, then puckered her lips as if about to cry.

With a sigh, Evelyn turned off the video on her phone and retrieved the baby's special blanket and pillow from the cabinet. She carefully arranged them in the center of the large bed.

Alexander Hamilton gently placed the baby down and settled on her left side, his intense gaze locking onto Evelyn. Aren’t you coming up?

The baby suddenly rolled over, raising both fists above her head. Though her eyes were heavy with sleep, she whimpered stubbornly.

Resigned, Evelyn slipped off her shoes and lay down on the baby’s right side.

Alexander’s large hand patted the little blanket rhythmically.

"You know how to soothe a baby?" Evelyn whispered.

"Auntie Marry taught me. Never had the chance to practice."

Turns out, Auntie Marry—the professional who raised Alexander—had passed down her expertise flawlessly.

The baby’s fussing gradually quieted, her eyelids drooping.

Evelyn hummed a lullaby she’d learned at the hospital until the baby was sound asleep. "She’s out. I’m heading back," she murmured.

Alexander remained frozen in position, half his body numb from staying still too long. He barely processed her words.

"I’ll come by tomorrow morning," Evelyn added.

"Keycard’s on the shoe cabinet by the door," he muttered, afraid to lift his arm and risk waking the baby.

Evelyn had to exit from the opposite side of the bed, tiptoeing toward the door.

Just as she slipped on her slippers, the baby let out a sudden wail.

Alexander immediately resumed patting the blanket. "Shh, it’s okay. Auntie’s here!"

Evelyn hurried back to the bed, holding her breath as she resumed the lullaby.

Their seamless teamwork eventually lulled the baby back to sleep.

Evelyn’s eyes met Alexander’s.

Even the most angelic baby could be a tyrant at bedtime.

"Wait a little longer," Alexander whispered. "Till she’s deep asleep."

Evelyn had no choice. She grabbed a pillow and lay down fully dressed.

Only when both mother and child were breathing evenly did Alexander dare to move his stiff arm. He carefully unfolded a blanket and draped it over them.

Seeing the baby peaceful, Evelyn mouthed, I’ll stay tonight. You go.

Alexander arched a brow. Kicking me out now?

Evelyn ignored him, simply gesturing toward the door.

A man, a woman, and a baby alone at night.

The scenario was awakening memories she’d rather forget.

Her defenses were at an all-time high, her anti-wolf radar on full alert.

Alexander relented. Arguing would risk waking the baby. He rose reluctantly.

But the moment he reached the coffee table, an ear-splitting wail erupted behind him.

The baby’s face flushed crimson as she sobbed uncontrollably.

Evelyn scooped her up, soothing her until the cries faded into hiccups.

Alexander had no choice but to return to his spot.

Only with both of them present did the baby finally settle back to sleep.

"Try standing up again," Evelyn challenged.

He did.

The baby’s scream this time was even louder.

"What’s wrong with her?" Evelyn massaged her temples. "How did Miss Langley manage alone?"

"Maybe she had a nanny."

"Didn’t see one this time."

"...Maybe she feels insecure without her mom?"

Evelyn surrendered.

Alexander chuckled. "With the baby here, what could I possibly do? Sleep."

Exhaustion crept in. Evelyn conceded—a baby between them was safeguard enough.

Lulled by the infant’s milky scent, she drifted off quickly.

Listening to their synchronized breathing, Alexander gazed at the sleeping child in his arms, his heart overflowing with sweetness.

He pulled the blanket over his two girls and closed his eyes, content.

——

BANG BANG BANG!

The violent pounding on the door jolted all three awake.

Alexander instinctively shielded the baby’s ears.

Evelyn sat up groggily. "Did you order breakfast?"

"Room service isn’t this aggressive," Alexander said, instantly alert.

A roar came from outside: "Evelyn! Are you in there?!"

Her face paled. "Dad!"

"Alexander Hamilton! Give me back my daughter!" Andrew Anderson’s voice shook the door.

Evelyn frantically scanned the bathroom, closet, even the window.

"Jumping from the penthouse isn’t an option," Alexander said calmly. "Hiding now would just look guilty."

"Then what?"

The real problem was the baby. With Andrew’s temper, seeing this scene would be a death sentence for Alexander.

Hotel staff gathered outside, voices overlapping in attempts to mediate.

"Sir, please calm down—"

"Back off!" Andrew bellowed. "Fetch your boss, Alexander Hamilton! He’s got explaining to do, or this isn’t over!"
###Chapter 531: Alexander in Peril

Curious guests peered from their doorways at the commotion in the hallway.

Evelyn bit her lip. "I'll take him next door to explain."

Alexander stepped in front of her. "Let me handle this. Stay with the baby."

Little Chloe remained blissfully unaware, babbling and waving tiny fists. Spotting Alexander, she suddenly exclaimed, "Daddy!"

Evelyn froze.

If her father heard that...

Alexander was in serious trouble.

Yet the man merely chuckled, gently tapping the baby's rosy cheek.

Evelyn instinctively tightened her hold on Chloe, retreating toward the window.

Alexander straightened his collar and opened the door to face Andrew Anderson's furious glare. "Mr. Anderson—"

"Where's my daughter?!" Andrew shoved past him.

The scene that greeted him: Evelyn clutching a baby amidst rumpled bedsheets and scattered infant supplies.

Andrew's raised fist halted midair. His pupils contracted violently.

Hotel staff held their breaths in the hallway.

"Return to your duties," Alexander commanded quietly.

The crowd dispersed instantly.

Tension thickened the air like syrup.

"Dad, please come inside—" Evelyn began.

Andrew's fist connected with Alexander's jaw before she could finish.

Alexander staggered against the entryway console, blood trickling from his lip.

"I warned you to stay away from my girl!" Andrew roared, snatching up a shoe bench.

Evelyn screamed, "Dad!"

Alexander stood motionless.

The wooden stool shattered against his shoulder with a sickening crack.

Chloe wailed in terror.

Crimson streaked down Alexander's temple.

As Andrew raised his arm again, Evelyn shielded the baby. "This is Bianca Langley's daughter! We're just babysitting!"

"Bianca Langley?" Andrew panted. "Since when do you know any Langleys?"

"Do you think a ten-day-old baby looks like this?" Evelyn thrust the sobbing infant toward him.

Andrew studied the red-faced child and finally lowered the stool.

Alexander moved to assist, but Andrew blocked him. "Stay put!"

"I only need to get the bottle—"

"I'll do it!" Andrew grabbed the bottle himself.

Chloe's cries subsided as she drank.

Only then did Evelyn notice Alexander's injuries—his face half-covered in blood, shirt speckled with wood splinters.

"Dad, how's Emily?" She grasped for a distraction.

"She's fine." Andrew shot Alexander a venomous look. "So this child belongs to his friend?"

Evelyn nodded.

"Then let him take responsibility!" Andrew seized his daughter's arm. "Pack your things. We're leaving now."

"But my luggage—"

"Every last item!" Andrew ground out. "This time, you're cutting ties with him for good!"
###Chapter 532: She Doesn't Care About You At All

The baby in the stroller suddenly started crying, forcing Evelyn to stop in her tracks.

Alexander's temple wound was still bleeding. He wiped it hastily with his hand. "Mr. Anderson, this isn't what you think—"

"Shut up!" Andrew Anderson yanked Evelyn behind him. "Who said you could call me uncle?"

Alexander staggered back from the shove, his back slamming hard against the wall.

Evelyn bent down to gently stroke the baby's cheek. "Hush now, Mommy will be back soon." The little one blinked tear-filled eyes and suddenly grasped her finger tightly.

"Let's go!" Andrew dragged Evelyn toward the elevator.

Alexander ignored his injury and sprinted after them. The elevator doors closed mercilessly in his face. He whirled around and bolted for the emergency stairs—

"Alex!" Lydia Laurent gasped, blocking his path.

Leonard Laurent looked stunned. "Mr. Hamilton, what's—"

"Get out of my way!" Alexander shook off Lydia's reaching hand.

She stubbornly pursued him. "You're bleeding! Let me see—"

Outside the hotel's revolving doors, Andrew turned back with a cold laugh. "Already found a replacement, huh?"

Alexander's eyes reddened with desperation. "Mr. Anderson, you've got it all wrong!"

Lydia flared up like a mother hen protecting her chicks. "How dare you hit someone? I'm calling the police!"

"Go ahead!" Andrew shoved Evelyn into a taxi. "Let this bastard bring the cops to find me!"

The car door slammed shut just as Lydia kept chattering: "Evelyn didn't even care about your injury...she clearly doesn't love you—"

"SHUT UP!" Alexander's roar made Lydia flinch violently.

......

In the taxi's backseat, Evelyn studied her father's stormy profile.

"Dad...how did you find me here?"

Andrew's knuckles cracked from how tightly he clenched his fists. "That Annabelle barged into Emily's hospital room yesterday. Said you abandoned your adoptive parents after climbing the social ladder. And that you—" His voice suddenly choked.

"What else did she say?"

"That you rekindled things with Alexander!" Andrew slammed his fist against the seat. "Your sister's surgical wounds tore open from rage! Your mother fainted from crying!"

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

"About the baby—"

"What baby? All lies!" Andrew suddenly lowered his voice. "Evelyn...tell me the truth. Did you already know about your real parents?"

In the rearview mirror, the hotel entrance grew increasingly distant. Alexander's figure shrank to a tiny black dot before vanishing around the corner.
###Chapter 533: Evelyn Is My Red Line

"Dad, I actually found out months ago." Evelyn clenched the hem of her shirt, her voice trembling. "I didn't mean to hide it from you and Mom. I just didn't want you to worry."

"How did they find you?"

"It was because of this red thread bracelet."

Andrew Anderson let out a heavy sigh. "Your mother and I never told you all these years because we didn't want you to feel unsettled. To us, you'll always be our real daughter."

"I know, Dad."

"We thought... after all these years with no word from your birth parents, perhaps they were already..." His voice cracked. "Who knew it would turn out like this?"

The world spun around Evelyn.

The secret she'd guarded so carefully had been brutally ripped open.

Her stomach churned violently. She bit down hard on her lower lip to keep from vomiting on the spot.

"Sweetheart!" Andrew caught her swaying figure. "Did that bastard hurt you again?"

"I'm fine," she forced out, shaking her head. "Just too many surgeries lately... And what Annabelle said..."

"Don't mention that lunatic!" Andrew's face darkened with rage. "Hospital security already threw her out. Come on, let's go home."

Evelyn's eyes burned.

At least she still had a home to return to.

Meanwhile, Alexander Hamilton was in chaos.

After Andrew stormed off with Evelyn, he'd wanted to chase after them but was stopped by the baby's wails.

The little one cried so desperately she even pushed away her bottle, only calming slightly when Alexander paced around the room holding her.

Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. When his phone vibrated, he nearly dropped the bottle.

The baby suckled tearfully, her big eyes fixed on the doorway, waiting for that familiar figure to return.

To make matters worse, the Laurent father-daughter duo had slithered in like ghosts.

"Alexander," Lydia cooed, stepping closer, "the poor thing is crying so hard. Let me hold her?"

"No." He turned away.

"I can learn!" She reached for the child. "Look here, baby—"

"Waaah—" The cries intensified.

Alexander's gaze turned glacial.

All that soothing effort—wasted.

Lydia withdrew her hand, pouting. "Does the baby hate me?"

"Don't be angry, Alexander," she suddenly pulled out her phone. "I'll call Evelyn right now! How heartless of her to ignore the baby crying like this..."

Leonard Laurent chimed in: "Exactly, Mr. Hamilton. I also wanted to consult Ms. Carter about the Dempsey Group collaboration."

Alexander suddenly smiled.

Cradling the baby with one arm, his eyes turned razor-sharp. "Lydia, Evelyn has always treated you well."

Her face paled.

"I don't care who taught you these tricks," he enunciated each word, "but lay one finger on Evelyn, and I'll bury Banyan Group with you."

Leonard broke out in a cold sweat. "Mr. Hamilton, that's too extreme—"

"Get out." Alexander pressed the call button. "I need to change the baby."

Five minutes later, a nanny hurried in.

"She misses her mother." Expertly taking the child, she patted her back.

Alexander loosened his tie. "From now on, you're assigned exclusively to her. Triple the standard rate."

"Thank you, Mr. Hamilton!" The nanny beamed.

Lydia tried again: "Alexander, I can help—"

"No need!" The nanny quickly stepped back, shielding the baby. "I've raised three children—I'm very experienced!"

By the window, Alexander stared at the direction Evelyn had left, his knuckles whitening.
###Chapter 534: Reaping What You Sow

Lydia Laurent opened her mouth to speak, but Alexander Hamilton had already efficiently packed up the baby supplies.

The stroller rolled smoothly with just one hand guiding it.

"Alexander..."

His cold gaze cut her off. "Is the hotel really that appealing?"

Leonard Laurent quickly shielded his daughter. "Mr. Hamilton, we're paying guests here."

Ignoring him, Alexander turned to the attendant. "Hold the baby. Follow me."

Leonard stiffened. "Where are you going?"

"Stay as long as you like." Alexander didn't look back. "Just stay out of my way."

He strode out of the hotel, the attendant carrying the infant close behind.

In the hospital's surgical ward, antiseptic fumes hung thick in the air as a doctor treated the gash on Alexander's forehead.

He didn't flinch.

Down the hall, Anthony Taylor was slicing an apple in Teresa Taylor's room.

The fruit knife clattered onto the tray when Alexander entered. "Alexander?"

Teresa turned from the bed, her complexion markedly improved.

Alexander surveyed the room. "You're recovering well, Mrs. Taylor."

She smiled, though her eyes kept darting behind him.

"A friend's child." His explanation was clipped. "I'm watching them briefly."

Anthony exhaled. "You gave me a scare."

"Can Mrs. Taylor tolerate apples now?"

"The doctor approved small portions." Anthony cubed the fruit. "Terry's return sped up her recovery tremendously."

Teresa's voice was featherlight. "I've been here too long... I want to go home."

The couple shared a tender look that twisted something in Alexander's chest.

He thought of Evelyn Carter. Of the marriage he'd destroyed.

Anthony offered him an apple slice. "What happened?"

The wound at Alexander's temple was impossible to miss.

"I deserved it." The words scraped his throat raw.

Anthony's brow furrowed.

Alexander summarized the hotel confrontation.

"It was inevitable." Anthony sighed. "Whatever Terry chooses, we'll respect it."

Teresa clutched the bedsheet, worry lining her face.

"The Andersons..." Alexander hesitated. "They're likely in this hospital too."

"What?"

"Evelyn's sister was in a car accident."

Understanding dawned. "You want me to mediate?"

"Evelyn's devoted to her family." Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "She must be devastated."

"I'll go." Anthony adjusted his collar, glancing at the stroller. "Leave the baby with us."

Teresa added softly, "We owe them for raising Terry so well."

The corridor to the orthopedic ward was tomb-silent.

Emily Anderson's door was shut tight, the observation window curtained.

"Discharged?" Alexander asked a nurse.

She shook her head and pushed the door open.

The Andersons filled the room.

Emily lay motionless on the bed. Evelyn sat beside her.

Her adoptive parents faced them from chairs.

The air was thick enough to choke on.
###Chapter 535: Don't Be Afraid, I'm Here

The nurse pushed the door open, frowned at the crowded room, and retreated without a word.

Alexander Hamilton supported Anthony Taylor as they entered slowly. His voice was low and respectful. "Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor."

Evelyn Carter looked up sharply. Her breath caught when she saw Anthony behind Alexander.

This was even more chaotic than she'd imagined.

"Get out!" Andrew Anderson slammed his hand on the table, pointing at Alexander with fury. He turned to Anthony, his tone slightly softer but still guarded. "Sir, if you're with him, you should leave too."

Since Annabelle Taylor's disruptive visit, he'd been wary of all strangers.

Emily Anderson, lying in the hospital bed, blinked in confusion.

Evelyn gently squeezed her sister's hand and stepped forward to intercept her father. "Dad, this is a hospital. We need to keep quiet."

Andrew snorted and shoved Alexander hard.

Alexander didn't budge, silently absorbing the anger directed at him.

"I'm Anthony Taylor." Anthony stepped forward, his voice gentle but laced with unmistakable guilt. "Evelyn's biological father."

Andrew's pupils constricted. "You're that mistress's father?"

"...Yes." Anthony smiled bitterly. "But the one we've wronged most is Evelyn. Thank you for raising her so well all these years."

"Hah! Your family certainly knows how to raise daughters!" Andrew sneered. "We may not be rich, but at least we taught our children to be decent human beings!"

Anthony had no rebuttal. He could only bow deeply. "I failed as a father."

"The one you wronged is Evelyn!" Andrew's voice trembled. "You nearly killed her as a child, and now you want to waltz in and play daddy?"

Anthony paled but couldn't argue.

"We're not here to take Evelyn away." Anthony spoke with difficulty. "If possible, I'd like our families to become one. Emily will be our daughter too."

Emily clutched her sister's hand in panic. "Evelyn, what are they talking about?"

"Don't be afraid." Evelyn soothed, patting her sister's back. "Just focus on recovering."

Grace Anderson silently wiped her tears in the corner. The air in the room felt frozen.

Alexander's gaze remained fixed on Evelyn, his eyes filled with concern.

"Let's take this outside!" Andrew suddenly stood. "This is a hospital, not a place for arguments."

Grace grabbed her husband's arm worriedly. "Calm down..."

"I know what I'm doing." Andrew strode toward the door, shooting Alexander a glare over his shoulder. "Stay away from my daughter!"

In the hallway, cold wind seeped through the window cracks.

Alexander suggested, "There's a teahouse nearby—"

"No need!" Andrew cut him off, but seeing Evelyn shiver, he immediately removed his coat. "Wear Dad's jacket."

Evelyn shook her head. "You'll catch a cold."

"I'd rather freeze than let you wear his clothes!" Andrew glared at Alexander. "Mr. Hamilton here already has a fiancée!"

Alexander's expression hardened. He pulled out his phone. "Emily Zade, issue the statement canceling the engagement immediately."
###Chapter 536: Settling Old Scores

Emily Zade's voice wavered with hesitation. "Mr. Hamilton, isn't it too abrupt to release the statement now? Banyan Group hasn't been notified—"

"Release it immediately."

"Understood."

The call ended. Andrew Anderson narrowed his eyes at Alexander Hamilton. "What scheme are you plotting now, boy?"

"Just settling what needs to be settled."

Andrew scoffed. He turned and saw Evelyn still standing motionless. His voice sharpened with urgency. "Why aren't you dressed? Put on your coat!"

Evelyn obediently wrapped herself in her father's jacket.

"Still cold?"

"Not anymore." Her whisper betrayed her as pale lips trembled.

Andrew studied his daughter's face before finally relenting. "...Hamilton. Where's this teahouse you mentioned?"

Alexander gestured smoothly. "Right across the street."

Upstairs in the private tea room, sandalwood incense curled through the air.

Andrew positioned Evelyn against the wall, placing himself squarely between her and Alexander like a protective beast guarding its cub.

A server brought Junshan Silver Needle tea. As Alexander moved to pour, Andrew shoved the cup away.

"Mr. Anderson—"

"Don't bother!"

Anthony Taylor hastily intercepted the teapot. "Allow me."

Alexander sat back awkwardly, his gaze drifting toward Evelyn. She kept her eyes downcast, slender fingers absently tracing the rim of her untouched cup.

"Mr. Anderson, please." Anthony offered tea with both hands.

Andrew's laugh was icy. "We simple folk aren't accustomed to such finery. Plain water will do."

Alexander pressed the service bell. "Bring jasmine tea."

Andrew slammed the table. "Enough theatrics! You investigated thoroughly—my girl grew up drinking jasmine blossoms!"

The room froze.

A trembling server delivered fresh tea. Anthony poured a steaming cup. "Andrew, about the past—"

Crack. Andrew seized the scalding cup. Blisters rose instantly on his reddened palm.

"Dad!" Evelyn gasped, grabbing his wrist.

He seemed not to feel the burn, staring fixedly at Anthony. "When my daughter fell through the ice at three years old—where were you?"

Anthony's face drained of color.

"If Old Li hadn't been fishing that day, she would've—" Andrew's voice broke. "Twenty years too late for reunions now!"

Evelyn clung to her father's arm, tears splashing his burned hand. "I'll always be your daughter..."

Anthony staggered to his feet, bowing deeply. "We failed her..."

"Spare me!" Andrew shook Evelyn off violently. "People like you—can't even protect a child! You deserve to be parents?!"

The teacup shattered against the floor. Shards flew like accusations.
###Chapter 537: Daddy’s Got Your Back

Andrew Anderson and Teresa Taylor exchanged a pained glance.

"You're right," Andrew admitted, his silver hair stark under the light. "That day at the train station, my wife was holding little Terry when the crowd swallowed them. One moment she was there, the next—gone." His voice cracked. "My wife collapsed when we got home. She barely survived."

Andrew, now a father of two daughters himself, softened slightly but kept his brow furrowed. "Yet you turned around and adopted another girl—even gave her a similar name!"

The mention of Annabelle Taylor was a thorn lodged deep in everyone’s heart.

"It was thoughtless of me," Andrew rasped. "After three years with no leads, the police said hope was slim. My wife... she tried to end it all. I was desperate." His gaze shifted to Evelyn. "Never imagined fate would twist things this way."

Evelyn’s fingers clenched around her sleeve.

A stand-in for a stand-in. How cruel.

Alexander Hamilton’s knuckles whitened, his expression stormy.

"Evelyn is your flesh and blood!" Andrew slammed the table. "And what did you do? Let someone steal her place, watched her suffer, and now that your company’s crumbling, you remember her?!"

Evelyn reached for her father. "Dad, please—"

"Stay out of this!" He shook her off, eyes blazing. "Today, I’m getting justice for you. Twenty-plus years of silence, and now you think a few pretty words will make up for it?"

Andrew bowed his head in shame. "You’re right, Mr. Anderson. We’ve failed Evelyn terribly. We don’t ask for forgiveness—just a chance to make amends."

"Amends?" Andrew scoffed. "Your ‘amends’ cost my daughter her dreams!"

Evelyn’s nose stung. "Dad..."

"You’ve always been so strong," Andrew murmured, voice thick. "The day you got into med school, I bragged to the whole factory for a month. When you became a doctor, I walked taller than ever..."

His calloused hand rested on her head. "But now you’d give up your scalpel for them? That breaks my heart."

Tears spilled as Evelyn buried herself in his arms. "I’m not giving up! Once Hamilton Group stabilizes, I’ll return—"

"Easy for you to say!" Andrew shot Alexander a glare. "Was this your idea?"

Alexander straightened. "Uncle, I’ve already spoken to the dean—"

"Enough!" Andrew cut him off. "My daughter’s life isn’t yours to meddle in!" He turned to Andrew, iron in his tone. "If you want her back, keep that bastard away from her."

Andrew nodded hastily. "Whatever Evelyn wants."

"Dad~" Evelyn tugged his arm playfully. "Don’t you trust me?"

Andrew’s sternness eased. He drained his teacup in one go. "My girl’s never failed at anything she set her mind to!"

Evelyn laughed through her tears, refilling his cup. "Slow down. It’s hot."
###Chapter 538: Going Our Separate Ways

Andrew Anderson exhaled deeply, the creases between his brows finally smoothing out.

"Don't pressure yourself too much. I'm not forcing you to make any decisions." His voice lightened. "As long as you're happy, you can do whatever you want."

He wiped his eyes quickly, careful not to break down in front of his daughter.

Evelyn Carter threw herself into her father's arms. "Thank you, Dad."

Andrew stiffened for a moment before his rough hands gently patted her back.

The rift between father and daughter had finally mended.

"Mr. Anderson, don't worry," Anthony Taylor said earnestly. "Terry can return to the hospital anytime. I'll handle the company matters separately."

Alexander Hamilton chimed in immediately, "That's right. I can take over—"

"Who asked for your input?" Andrew shot him a glare. "Even if help is needed, it'll be for Mr. Taylor. Don't think you can make my daughter owe you favors."

"It's me who owes her," Alexander admitted with a bitter smile.

Anthony patted Alexander's shoulder, sighing helplessly.

"One more thing," Andrew turned to Anthony. "We must respect Terry's wishes regarding how she's addressed."

Anthony's expression dimmed. "Of course. We'll follow her lead."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Thank you."

"Silly child, no need for thanks." Anthony's eyes reddened. "If you want to go back to the hospital—"

"I'll help the company through this difficult period first," Evelyn said gently. "We can discuss it after Auntie's condition stabilizes."

Anthony nodded repeatedly. "Let me know if you face any challenges."

Andrew suddenly grew serious. "I need to confirm one last time—Terry is truly your biological daughter?"

"Absolutely. We've done the paternity test."

Only then did Andrew relax, though his tone remained stern. "Acknowledging the relationship is fine, but Terry must be your only daughter. If she has to share that title with that homewrecker, forget about recognition!"

"Annabelle, she..." Anthony sighed. "We failed in raising her properly."

"Three non-negotiable terms." Andrew raised a finger. "First, Terry returns as your sole heir. She gets everything she's entitled to."

Anthony assured him instantly, "Naturally."

"If you dare favor your adopted daughter over her, I won't let it slide!"

"The inheritance division has already been notarized. If you don't believe—"

"Unnecessary!" Andrew waved him off. "Second, I still get to see my daughter after recognition."

"Of course! We'll be family—"

"We live separately." Andrew cut him off. "Different lifestyles. No need to force closeness."

Anthony glanced at Evelyn. "You can live wherever you prefer. We can buy another property if needed."

"I want to spend more time with my parents," Evelyn said softly. "Emily still needs care."

Anthony's heart ached, but he could only nod. "Very well. The hospital makes visits convenient."

Andrew suddenly pointed at Alexander. "Third, he stays away from Terry!"

Alexander straightened his posture. "Uncle Anderson, I know I was wrong."

"Then keep your distance!" Andrew snapped. "If not for you, would she have suffered so much?"

He turned back to Anthony. "This is the most crucial term. No agreement, no deal!"
###Chapter 539: A Parent's Love

Evelyn sat quietly, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt.

Andrew Anderson's temples throbbed with visible veins, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white. If not for his daughter's presence, he would have flipped the table by now.

"That bastard," he ground out through clenched teeth, his voice barely above a whisper. "He forced Evelyn into divorce for another woman, and now he has the audacity to come crawling back? And you—her biological father—just stand by and watch?"

Alexander Hamilton kept his head bowed, his Adam's apple bobbing. He knew any words now would only pour fuel on the fire.

Anthony Taylor sat between them, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Andrew, please calm down. I know Alexander—he's not a bad person at heart, it's just..."

"At heart?" Andrew let out a cold laugh. "What heart? The heart that falls for every woman he sees?"

The teacup rattled loudly against the table.

Anthony wiped his brow. "Everyone deserves a second chance..."

"A second chance?" Andrew shot to his feet. "Did he ever give Evelyn a second chance?!"

Evelyn instinctively reached for her father's sleeve.

Anthony's expression shifted. "Andrew, listen to me—"

"There's nothing to say!" Andrew slapped away Anthony's outstretched hand. "Three conditions—take them or leave them."

"The first two are fine, but the third..." Anthony glanced helplessly at Alexander. "Hamilton Group genuinely needs Alexander's help right now..."

"Bullshit!" Andrew trembled with rage. "He's just using business as an excuse to get close to Evelyn!"

Alexander finally looked up. "Uncle Andrew, I—"

"Shut up!" Andrew jabbed a finger at him. "At the mall today, you were all over that Laurent girl—did you think I wouldn't see?"

Anthony turned to Alexander in shock.

"It was a misunderstanding," Alexander said with a bitter smile. "I've already had PR release a statement."

Andrew sneered. "Fine. Take your time discussing. Evelyn, we're leaving."

He pulled Evelyn up and stormed out, slamming a bill onto the front counter as they passed.

In the hospital corridor, Evelyn studied her father's rigid profile, her heart twisting into knots.

"Dad..."

Andrew's steps faltered, his posture suddenly seeming more stooped.

"Evelyn," he said hoarsely, "it's not that I'm against you reconnecting with your birth parents. It's just..." He rubbed his face roughly. "I'm afraid you'll get hurt."

Tears welled up in Evelyn's eyes instantly.

She threw her arms around him, breathing in the familiar scent of tobacco mixed with medicinal herbs.

"Dad, I remember when I had a fever as a child—you carried me two blocks to the hospital..."

Andrew's body trembled slightly.

"And how you always gave the meat to Emily and me while you ate plain buns..."

Something warm dripped onto the top of her head.

"Without you and Mom, I would have died in that orphanage." She looked up through her tears. "You'll always be my father."

Andrew's rough hand settled on her head, just like when she was little.

"Silly girl..." His voice cracked. "I just... can't bear to let you go."

Father and daughter stood under the plane tree outside the inpatient ward, neither in a hurry to return.

Andrew suddenly said, "The Taylors... they could give you a better life."

"I don't want a better life." Evelyn shook her head. "I just want you and Mom to be okay."

In the distance, a nurse's cart rattled by.

Andrew took a deep breath and straightened his back. "Come on, let's go see your mother. If that bastard dares to show his face again—"

His fists clenched with an audible crack of knuckles.

Evelyn laughed through her tears, linking her arm through his.

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground, intertwined as one.
###Chapter 540: On High Alert

Evelyn Carter never expected her father's attitude to shift so dramatically.

The furious man from the teahouse was now urging her to accept her biological parents.

"Dad..."

"You'll always be my daughter." Andrew Anderson's rough palm gently patted her shoulder. "But I want what's best for you. You've suffered enough these years."

His voice trembled slightly. "I set those three conditions to protect you. That adopted daughter is trouble, but they raised her for over two decades..."

This man who couldn't be bothered with buying their own house had now considered every detail for his child.

Evelyn's throat tightened. Tears welled in her eyes.

"I promise."

——

In the hospital room, Grace Anderson anxiously peered out the window.

"Mom!" Emily Anderson suddenly shouted. "Dad and Evelyn are back!"

She nearly jumped off the bed in excitement.

Evelyn rushed over to restrain her. "Don't move!"

Emily finally noticed their red-rimmed eyes. "What happened? Did that family—"

"Just dust in our eyes." Evelyn quickly wiped her face.

Andrew puffed out his chest. "Nothing's wrong. If that bastard shows up, I'll beat him senseless!"

Grace understood perfectly but played along. "How did it go?"

"Fine." Andrew evaded. "They seemed sincere. Truly care about Evelyn."

Evelyn sat by her sister's bed and explained everything.

Emily's jaw dropped before she pulled Evelyn into a fierce hug. "You'll always be my sister!"

"Obviously." Evelyn pinched her cheek. "Fail any classes and you'll answer to me."

"Evelyn!" Emily ducked her head. "I was worried about missing too much school..."

"Get notes from classmates."

The sisters dissolved into laughter.

Grace dabbed at her eyes. "You two..."

"Mom, we'll always be family." Evelyn said softly.

Andrew could no longer hold back. He gathered his wife and daughters into a tight embrace.

——

A sharp knock interrupted them.

Assuming it was Alexander Hamilton, Andrew turned with a scowl—then froze. "Auntie Lucy?"

He completely ignored Peter Harrison standing beside her.

Peter forced himself to speak. "Uncle Andrew, Aunt Grace. My mother heard about Emily's hospitalization—"

"Hmph." Andrew snorted dismissively.

Auntie Lucy entered with a fruit basket and flowers. "Meant to visit sooner. Just found time today."

Grace offered a strained smile. "Have a seat."

"Why is the whole family here?" Auntie Lucy asked concernedly. "Is Emily alright?"

"Discharging soon."

Andrew's glare remained fixed on Peter like he was examining something filthy.

Peter, however, stared unblinkingly at Evelyn.

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. She shifted closer to her sister.

"Emily recovering well?" Peter suddenly stepped forward.

"Very." Emily answered.

Evelyn immediately cut in. "Director Harrison, with your busy schedule, you still have time to visit?"

"My duty." Peter smiled thinly. "Picked the fruits myself. All fresh."

Auntie Lucy nodded. "Peter said these are popular gifts for patients now."

Evelyn exchanged a look with her father.

"Room's too small." Andrew grabbed the basket. "I'll take this out."

Auntie Lucy glanced around in confusion. "What's going on? You're acting like we're thieves."
###Chapter 541: Your Life Is at Stake

"No need," Grace Anderson replied coldly. "The hospital has everything."

Auntie Lucy remained enthusiastic. "It's just a small gesture from Peter and me. We can't visit empty-handed."

Evelyn Carter accepted politely. "Thank you, Auntie Lucy and Peter."

Peter Harrison smirked meaningfully. "I should be the one thanking you. You've been a great help."

"If you're so busy, don't waste time here." Evelyn made the dismissal clear.

Peter's eyes turned venomous, locking onto her like a snake.

Auntie Lucy, chatting with Grace about Emily Anderson's condition, sensed the tension and quickly intervened. "Evelyn, your mother mentioned you've been swamped with work?"

"It's manageable. I still make time for family." Evelyn maintained surface-level courtesy.

Auntie Lucy rambled on. "Young people shouldn't overwork themselves. Peter’s been pulling all-nighters too."

"Dedication is commendable."

"Exactly!" Auntie Lucy beamed with pride. "He just landed a new project. If all goes well, he’ll be running his own firm soon."

Andrew Anderson and Grace stayed silent.

Emily glanced curiously at Peter, but Evelyn stood to adjust the curtains, blocking her view. "The draft is strong. Don’t catch a chill," she murmured.

"Okay." Emily obediently tightened her coat.

Peter gritted his teeth, his voice dripping with malice. "Don’t celebrate too soon, Mom. The project might still fall through."

The barb was clearly aimed at Evelyn.

Auntie Lucy looked baffled before suggesting, "Why don’t you young folks take a walk? I’d like to catch up with Grace."

A vicious glint flashed in Peter’s eyes. "Perfect. Evelyn, shall we talk outside?"

He stepped closer, but she sidestepped him.

"I have questions for you too." She strode ahead toward the door.

Auntie Lucy urged, "You grew up together. Don’t be strangers. Even if romance didn’t work out, you can still be friends."

Andrew blocked Peter’s path. "It’s freezing. Talk inside."

Peter feigned innocence. "Uncle Andrew, the hospital is full of Evelyn’s colleagues. What could I possibly do to her?"

"You—" Andrew’s temper flared.

"Dad, it’s warm enough now," Evelyn cut in.

Andrew softened. "Don’t go far. Stay where people can see you."

"Understood."

Auntie Lucy chuckled to Grace. "Andrew’s so overprotective. She’s a grown woman—"

The door shut, cutting her off.

Around the corridor’s bend, their façades crumbled instantly.

The garden was deserted during lunch hour, save for a few patrolling guards in the distance.

"Explain Emily’s accident," Evelyn demanded in a hushed tone.

Peter sneered. "Alexander Hamilton didn’t tell you?"

"What do you mean?"

"How touching. The great Mr. Hamilton kept it from you to spare your feelings."

"Stop playing games." Evelyn turned to leave.

Peter’s voice turned icy. "I want you to convince Alexander to invest in my project."

"Business is business. Pitch it yourself."

"He’ll agree if you ask." Peter licked his lips. "After all, that night—"

Evelyn scoffed. "You think he’d bend to my whims?"

"Try me." Peter narrowed his eyes. "Last time you promised me something, I was very... satisfied."

"Know your limits," Evelyn’s gaze sharpened like blades. "Push further, and what I ask Alexander for won’t be money."

"Oh? Then what?"

"Your. Life."

Peter burst into manic laughter. "No wonder he’s obsessed with you! You understand him so well! But—" His laughter died abruptly. "If he wants me dead, why should he have peace?"

"Let’s see how long Auntie Lucy’s goodwill can protect you."

"I won’t accept this!" Peter’s face twisted. "I was inches from success!"

"Choose: your career or your life."

Peter trembled with rage. As Evelyn moved to leave, he yanked her back. "Stay put!"

Dense shrubs shielded them from view.

Evelyn recoiled. "What are you doing?"

Madness gleamed in Peter’s eyes. "Alexander wants me dead? Fine. Then his most precious person can join me in hell!"
###Chapter 542: Power Couple

Peter Harrison's voice dripped with madness, his eyes gleaming dangerously.

Evelyn Carter stood motionless.

"Scared?" Peter whistled mockingly.

"Of what?" She scanned their surroundings. "This place is under surveillance. What can you possibly do?"

"What if I brought a knife?" He narrowed his eyes. "I could stab you right now."

"You won't." Her tone was absolute. "Only fools like Simon Stapleton would resort to mutual destruction. Even if you killed someone, you'd find a scapegoat. Like... Annabelle Taylor?"

Peter suddenly laughed. "You know me so well. Pity..."

"Pity what?"

"Pity Alexander Hamilton was born with a silver spoon." He licked his lips. "With his resources and my brains, we could conquer the world."

Evelyn scoffed. "First, you overestimate yourself. Second, even with his wealth, I'd never ally with a demon."

"And Alexander's a saint?" Peter sneered. "He just puts on a good act for you."

She refused to engage. "Did you send Annabelle to harass my sister?"

"Don't pin every crime on me." He spread his hands. "What do I gain from your feud? It'd only make Alexander eliminate me faster."

Evelyn frowned. Logically, Peter had no motive.

Was it Annabelle's own doing?

A wave of nausea hit her. She pressed her temples.

"I'm leaving." She turned. "No money, and you won't dare kill me."

"Wait." Peter pointed into the distance. "See that car?"

A black sedan idled behind shrubs, two men in black standing guard.

"Alexander's bodyguards." Peter gritted his teeth. "They watch me 24/7—even at my mother's place! This is prison!"

Evelyn smirked. "If you hadn't targeted Emily Anderson, would you be in this mess?"

"My fault?" His voice rose hysterically. "You're the problem! Without you, would Alexander be hunting me? He could vanish me anytime!"

"Afraid of getting caught for your crimes?"

"Afraid of losing everything!" He advanced. "Today, you'll help me—"

Evelyn stepped back, hand reaching for her phone. "Not afraid to die?"

"Terrified! But more afraid of mediocrity!" Madness burned in his gaze. "Give me one chance from Alexander, and I'll prove my worth! If he wastes millions on incompetents, he owes me billions!"

She yanked out her phone—only for Peter to snatch it away.

"Ah!" He dragged her toward the roadside, her nails scraping deep grooves into tree bark.

"Let go!" She struggled. "Keep this up, and you'll rot in jail!"

"What's the difference now?" His face contorted. "Better to gamble than wait for death! Get Alexander to invest, and I'll rise again!"

Evelyn swung her purse at him. "Psycho!"

Peter took the blows, clamping onto her wrist. "Scream! Scream loud enough for the bodyguards!"

Her breath came in gasps. Black spots danced in her vision.

"Now!" His fingers tightened around her throat. "Or this time... you really will die."
###Chapter 543: You're My Greatest Weakness

Sunlight slanted across the cobblestone path in the hospital garden. Evelyn's peripheral vision caught two men in black suits watching from a distance. One quickly pulled out his phone, fingers flying across the screen.

"Hahaha, they saw us!" Peter's laughter grated like nails on chalkboard. "Alexander will come running now, won't he? Why must you suffer like this..."

Thud.

A dull impact.

Evelyn gasped as the vise-like grip around her throat suddenly vanished. Her assailant went flying.

Doubling over, she coughed violently. Her stomach churned. Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

A warm hand patted her back. "You okay?" The voice sounded hoarse.

"...Yeah."

Peter hadn't gone for the kill, but oxygen deprivation and nausea left her drenched in cold sweat. She crouched, dry heaving with nothing coming up.

Alexander hovered nearby, torn between touching her and giving space. "I'll call a doctor."

"No need." Evelyn waved him off. "My parents have enough to worry about."

"Can you stand?"

"Give me a minute."

The cool breeze helped. She straightened up and saw Peter struggling to rise.

Alexander's punch had landed with brutal force. Peter sprawled on the ground, blood and teeth scattered near his mouth.

The two bodyguards sprinted over, pinning him down.

"Mr. Hamilton, our apologies!" The guard's voice shook.

Alexander said nothing, his gaze fixed on Evelyn's pallid face.

"They've been guarding the whole time," she murmured.

"I know." Rage simmered in Alexander's eyes as he stared at Peter like a corpse.

The guard checked Peter's pulse. "Knocked out but alive. Your orders?"

"Take care of him." Ice laced Alexander's tone.

The men hauled Peter up immediately.

"Wait!" Evelyn blocked them. "This is a hospital."

Alexander frowned. "You're pleading for him now?"

"I mean there are security cameras." She shot a disgusted glance at the unconscious man. "Call hospital security or the police."

"Unnecessary." Alexander jerked his chin at the guards. "Move him."

Peter suddenly coughed awake, thrashing wildly. "Mr. Hamilton! One more chance! I can still bring value to Hamilton Group—"

Alexander waved impatiently. "Hurry up."

A guard clamped a hand over Peter's mouth, dragging him toward a black van. A crimson streak marked their path.

The van door slammed shut. The engine roared to life and sped away.

The remaining guard murmured, "I'll clean up the traces."

Alexander ignored him, focusing on Evelyn. "Still feeling sick?"

Her voice came out weak. "What will you do with him?"

"Worry about yourself first."

"He's unhinged. I'm afraid he might—"

"There won't be a next time." Alexander cut her off. "I promise."

She searched his face. "At least tell me your plan. Aunt Lucy's still in the ward. I need to explain."

"You just followed him out here?" Alexander suddenly demanded. "Do you realize how dangerous that was?"

"He wouldn't dare cause trouble inside the hospital." She pressed her lips together. "He just wanted to see you."

"But he came for you." Alexander's voice dropped. "Because he knows threatening you works best on me."

Evelyn turned away. "...I should go back."

Whispers floated past from passing visitors:

"Domestic violence? Look at the blood..."
"None of our business..."

She quickened her pace.

Alexander matched her stride. "Slow down."

"Stop following me."

"I won't touch you. But I'm seeing you back safely."

At the inpatient entrance, she halted. "Go home. My father will get angry seeing you again."

More importantly, Aunt Lucy still waited for her son in the ward. The thought of fabricating an excuse for Peter's absence made her dizzy.

Alexander pressed the elevator button first. "I'll handle your father's temper. I'm not leaving you like this." He paused. "And someone needs to explain Peter's situation."

The elevator doors slid open. He stepped inside decisively.
###Chapter 544: Killing with a Borrowed Knife

The hospital door creaked open softly.

Evelyn Carter stood at the threshold, Alexander Hamilton following closely behind.

"Dad, Mom, I'm back."

Grace Anderson and Auntie Lucy's conversation cut off abruptly. Andrew Anderson's gaze shot toward Alexander like a sharpened arrow, his fury practically scorching through him.

Alexander remained composed, as if this were his first visit. "Good evening, Uncle and Aunt. I ran into Evelyn downstairs and came up with her."

Andrew snorted loudly and turned his face away.

Auntie Lucy recognized Alexander's identity, her eyes darting behind them—only to find the door shut tight.

"Evelyn, wasn't Peter supposed to be with you? Why hasn't he come back? It's already dark..."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "He—"

"Mr. Harrison had an urgent business trip," Alexander interjected, his tone brooking no argument.

Auntie Lucy wrung her hands nervously. "Mr. Hamilton, this... this is so sudden. He didn't even say goodbye."

"Company emergency." Alexander kept it brief.

Grace quickly smoothed things over. "It's good for young people to be ambitious. Peter is so driven—he'll go far."

Andrew poured water with a stony expression, pointedly ignoring Alexander.

Auntie Lucy cradled her cup, anxiety written across her face. "How long will he be gone? He didn't even say where..."

"Fiji."

"By plane?"

"An island nation in the South Pacific."

Auntie Lucy paled. "That far? He didn't even pack a change of clothes—"

"It's summer year-round there," Alexander said flatly.

Evelyn's fingers twitched. She recalled the rumor—four people went out to sea, but only Alexander returned.

She stole a glance at his profile but found no trace of anything amiss.

The door opened again.

"Andrew, I brought Emily some milk tea," Anthony Taylor said cheerfully as he entered.

Emily Anderson peeked timidly at her father.

Andrew frowned. "What auspicious day is it today? Everyone's crowding in here."

Auntie Lucy took the hint and stood. "With Peter away, I should go tidy up. Grace, I'll visit Emily another time."

Grace saw her to the door.

Andrew glared at Anthony and Alexander. "The ones who should leave aren't leaving."

Alexander stayed silent.

Anthony sighed. "All the fault is mine. Don't take it out on the children."

"A crooked stick will have a crooked shadow!" Andrew slammed his hand on the table. "If that woman hadn't caused a scene at the hospital, we'd still be in the dark!"

Emily puffed up indignantly. "Yeah! Bad woman!"

Anthony's face turned ashen. "A disgrace to the family..."

"Mr. Taylor!" Teresa's caregiver rushed in. "Madam has been looking everywhere for you."

Anthony excused himself apologetically. Alexander escorted him out but turned back.

Andrew's eyes blazed. "Why are you still here?"

"Uncle Anderson," Alexander said gravely, "are you certain only one person came to make trouble yesterday?"

"You think I'm lying?" Andrew's anger flared.

Alexander shook his head. "I'm concerned someone is using a pawn to do their dirty work."

Annabelle's recent actions had been so foolish—it was as if she were being manipulated.
###Chapter 545: Birds of a Feather

Evelyn's fingers tightened slightly as she gently pulled back her furious father. "Dad, there might be more to this story."

Andrew Anderson paused mid-outburst. "What do you mean?"

"I went to the resort for work," Evelyn said softly but firmly. "But looking back now, there were many things that didn't add up."

Grace Anderson sighed in frustration. "I told you to get the facts first before storming over there."

"Mom, I understand how you feel." Evelyn reached for her mother's hand reassuringly.

Alexander Hamilton spoke up at the right moment. "Uncle, Auntie, I'll investigate this thoroughly. Whoever's behind this won't get away with it."

His eyes darkened.

Andrew snorted. "Finally something decent coming out of your mouth!"

"Dad," Evelyn continued, "other than Annabelle, did you notice anyone else suspicious? Even someone just loitering in the hallway counts."

The hospital room fell silent.

Emily suddenly gasped. "That horrible woman kept insulting my sister! When Dad was arguing with her, I think I saw someone in the corridor..."

Andrew slapped his thigh. "Now I remember! After security escorted Annabelle out, I saw her talking to a young girl."

"What did she look like?" Evelyn's heartbeat quickened.

"Seemed quiet and well-behaved. Petite, about your sister's age." Andrew frowned. "The girl was crying too, acting very concerned about Annabelle."

Evelyn and Alexander locked eyes across the room.

"Lydia," Alexander said grimly.

Andrew immediately stepped between them. "You know that girl?"

Alexander nodded. "Yes."

"Wait!" Emily blurted. "Isn't she the one from the hotel today—"

"Enough!" Andrew roared. "What brother-in-law nonsense!"

Emily shrank back. "Ex... ex-brother-in-law..."

Andrew jabbed a finger at Alexander's face. "Wasn't Annabelle enough trouble? Now you've got a fiancée too? Won't rest until you've destroyed my daughter?"

"The engagement is off," Alexander said quietly.

"Hah!" Andrew sneered. "Birds of a feather! That fiancée of yours hanging around with Annabelle—what does that say about her?"

Alexander absorbed the verbal blows in silence.

Evelyn analyzed calmly. "Annabelle coming to the hospital makes sense. But why would Lydia be here?"

"She came with Annabelle." Alexander's gaze turned icy.

Andrew suddenly remembered something. "That's right! That Lydia kept bringing up how you two were sharing a room!"

"What exactly did she say?" Evelyn pressed.

"Pretended to praise your kindness, but really just pouring oil on the fire!" Andrew grew angrier the more he thought about it. "That girl looks innocent, but she's cunning as a fox!"

Evelyn gave Alexander a thoughtful look.

Andrew glared. "Why are you still here?"

Alexander took a deep breath. "I'll handle this now."

As he turned to leave, something dangerous flashed in his eyes.
###Chapter 546: She Cried Hard After You Left

"Uncle, Auntie, I should get going."

Alexander Hamilton's gaze lingered on Evelyn Carter for a moment. Seeing her engaged in conversation with Andrew Anderson, he had no choice but to leave the hospital room alone.

Andrew exhaled in relief once the unwelcome visitor was gone and settled back onto the bed. "Your sister can be discharged in a couple of days. Will you stay at home during that time?"

"I'm afraid not," Evelyn rubbed her temples. "I have a pile of documents to review. Promises made must be kept."

Grace Anderson frowned with concern. "You're that busy? Don't overwork yourself."

"Don't worry, Mom. I know my limits," Evelyn reassured her. "I'll come home once work stabilizes."

Emily Anderson's eyes brightened. "Sis, I can help!"

"Focus on recovering first," Evelyn chuckled, pinching her sister's cheek. Turning to her parents, she added, "I need to go now. Call me immediately if anything comes up."

Andrew walked her to the door, scanning the hallway warily. "Is that kid really gone? He’s not lurking somewhere, is he?"

Evelyn stepped aside to give him a clear view. "See for yourself?"

Only after confirming the hallway was empty did Andrew relax. "There are plenty of good men out there. If he bothers you again, don’t give him the time of day."

The elevator descended directly to the 16th floor.

The doors opened, revealing Alexander’s figure.

"Has Uncle Andrew calmed down?" he asked softly.

Evelyn shook her head. "Between the news about his biological parents and you, he’s hardly in a good mood." She changed the subject abruptly. "Where’s the baby? Still at the hotel?"

"I didn’t trust anyone else with her," Alexander replied. "I asked the attendant who previously cared for her. She’s in Aunt Teresa’s room now."

Evelyn checked her watch. "We should head back soon. Miss Langley will probably arrive shortly."

Alexander nodded in understanding. "Leaving now?"

"Go tend to your wound first," Evelyn frowned at the gash on his temple. "You’ll scare the baby looking like that."

The blood had been wiped away, but the injury remained gruesome.

"Let me take you to the surgical department," she instinctively offered to guide him.

A flicker of warmth passed through Alexander’s eyes. "I can manage on my own. If Uncle Andrew sees us together..."

"...Fine. Go by yourself," Evelyn conceded.

"Go see the baby," Alexander murmured. "She cried terribly after you left."

Evelyn’s heart clenched.

A soft knock sounded on Teresa Taylor’s hospital room door.

Anthony Taylor assumed it was a nurse and was overjoyed upon seeing Evelyn. "It’s Terry!"

The room echoed with the baby’s bell-like laughter.

Teresa struggled to prop herself up, her gaze hungrily following her daughter.

"I came to check on the baby," Evelyn explained.

Anthony quickly stepped aside. "Come in."

In the crib, Baby Chloe was happily playing with the attendant. Upon spotting Evelyn, she immediately reached out her tiny arms to be held.

"Since when did you become such a crybaby?" Evelyn cradled her gently, noting the baby’s freshly changed clothes.

"Thank you for looking after her. What should I call you?"

"Just call me Auntie Huang," the attendant smiled. "She’s been very well-behaved—just extremely attached to you, Miss Carter."

Evelyn nuzzled the baby’s cheek. "Has she been fed?"

"Mr. Hamilton fed her himself," Auntie Huang said. "Miss Laurent offered to help, but he insisted on doing it."

Teresa watched the scene with glistening eyes. "Anthony, doesn’t this remind you of..."

Anthony’s voice trembled. "Exactly like back then."

Evelyn looked up, puzzled.

"You weighed only four pounds at birth," Teresa gestured with her hands. "Like a tiny kitten. The umbilical cord was wrapped around your neck—it terrified us. Your father cried like a child."

Her gaze tenderly traced Evelyn’s features. "Just like this baby, you rarely cried as an infant. You smiled at everyone."
###Chapter 547: I Won't Let You Face These Things Alone

Memories surged unexpectedly, moistening Evelyn Carter's eyes.

She recalled the newborns she'd delivered, murmuring, "Holding a newborn feels truly special."

Anthony Taylor said to his wife, "Terry always dreamed of becoming an OB-GYN. Now it seems fate guided her—born under such perilous circumstances, yet now she safeguards countless mothers and infants."

Baby Chloe immediately clung to Evelyn's sleeve, refusing to let Auntie Huang hold her.

The impending separation after returning to the hotel weighed heavily on Evelyn's heart.

The infant giggled innocently, oblivious to the coming farewell.

Evelyn gently booped the baby's nose, suddenly imagining becoming her godmother.

Chloe reached up with tiny hands to touch Evelyn's face.

Watching this scene, Anthony and Teresa Taylor felt warmth they hadn't experienced in years.

Alexander Hamilton returned from surgery with gauze covering his brow and bruises on his face.

Evelyn frowned at his injuries. "Why no stitches?"

"The doctor said this would suffice." Alexander addressed the elders, "Uncle, Auntie, I'm here to take them back."

Anthony asked concernedly, "Was the wound properly treated?"

"It's fine. Just needs time to heal." Alexander turned to Evelyn. "Let's go."

In the hallway, Evelyn finally insisted, "You need stitches."

His voice softened. "Really unnecessary."

"Do I look like a layperson? That wound requires at least three stitches."

"Then stitch it yourself?"

"I'm an OB-GYN."

"Don't you suture during C-sections?" Alexander raised an eyebrow.

Evelyn turned to leave. "Find your own ride back then."

He quickly caught her arm. "The surgeon said it'll heal like this."

"I don't believe that."

"Trust our surgical colleagues' expertise."

Evelyn stared him down. "Is this about vanity?"

Alexander rubbed his nose, deflecting. "Auntie Huang, how's the baby?"

Auntie Huang blinked. "She's perfectly fine."

"Denying treatment due to vanity!" Evelyn snapped.

Alexander sighed. "Haven't won you back yet. Scars aren't attractive."

"No one judges by appearance alone."

"True," he chuckled darkly. "You even considered someone like Peter Harrison."

At Peter's name, Evelyn tensed. "His mother will alert the police once she realizes he's missing. The surveillance footage—"

At the hospital entrance, Alexander helped Auntie Huang secure the stroller.

Noticing Evelyn lingering, he patted the passenger seat. "Get in."

"You haven't answered me."

"Used cosmetic sutures already." Alexander leaned back. "As for Peter—I told you, he's in Fiji."

Evelyn leaned closer, confirming the stitches.

"Why lie?"

"What do you think?" Alexander glanced at Auntie Huang in the backseat, lowering his voice. "Bianca Langley's waiting."

Once inside the car, Evelyn pressed, "Does Hamilton Group operate in Fiji?"

"That tiny country?" Alexander laughed dryly.

"Then Peter—"

"Ambitious men find opportunities anywhere." His gaze remained fixed ahead. "His fate's in his hands now."

Evelyn studied his expression for deception.

"Still worried I'm a killer?"

"Are you?"

Alexander inhaled sharply. "Not directly."

"Business related?"

"Initially."

Evelyn studied her hands. "Taking lives for profit? As a doctor, I can't comprehend that."

"That's how power operates." His voice turned gravelly. "Often it's self-preservation, not malice."

"I understand, but—"

"You shouldn't have to." Alexander cut in firmly. "With me here, you'll never face such choices."

"Alexander."

"Hmm?"

"Simon Stapleton... did he also go to Fiji?"

"He's definitely deceased."

Evelyn whipped her head around.

Auntie Huang gasped audibly from the backseat.
###Chapter 548: Don't Want to Distract You

Alexander's gaze lingered briefly on the back seat before he looked away.

"He was drunk and fell. It had nothing to do with me."

"When did it happen?"

"Before we left for the capital."

Evelyn looked up sharply. "You sent me to that summit to keep me away?"

"Not entirely." Alexander tapped his fingers lightly on the steering wheel. "The summit was beneficial for you. As for Simon...his body was found late. It was already badly decomposed. I know how much you respect life. I didn’t want to upset you."

Silence filled the car.

Alexander covered her hand with his. "His ashes were sent back to his hometown for burial. The arrangements were simple."

"You handled it?"

"I hired a local funeral service." He paused. "Consider it...a blessing for our child."

——

In the hotel restaurant, Bianca sipped her coffee leisurely.

Auntie Huang returned the stroller to Alexander and hurried off.

"Well, well," Bianca raised an eyebrow. "This little one seems quite attached to you. Anyone would think she’s yours."

Alexander pulled out a chair, glancing at Evelyn’s slightly flushed cheeks. "Don’t say things like that. I’ll end up in trouble."

Bianca burst out laughing, slapping the table. "Alexander Hamilton in trouble? Now that’s a sight I’d pay to see!"

"I’ve been your free babysitter, and this is the thanks I get?"

"Blame Dr. Carter," Bianca winked at Evelyn. "He wouldn’t dare lose his temper now."

Alexander shook his head in resignation. "Fine. This one’s on me."

Bianca suddenly turned serious. "Honestly, the three of you walking over just now looked like a perfect little family."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Just strangers making assumptions."

"Maybe not." Bianca smirked coldly. "If it were me and Vincent, people would’ve called the police."

Evelyn didn’t respond, gently handing the baby over. "She missed you."

"Thank you both for looking after her." Bianca took her daughter, who immediately snuggled into her arms.

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "She was very well-behaved."

Her chest felt hollow, as if a piece had been carved out.

Bianca kissed her daughter’s cheek. "Mommy missed you too."

Noticing Evelyn’s subdued expression, Alexander asked, "Are you staying here for a while longer?"

"Yes," Bianca smiled. "Feel free to come by and help with babysitting."

"Of course," Evelyn agreed immediately. "Thank you again for everything."

"Don’t thank me yet," Bianca teased. "I’ll be bothering you both plenty more."

Though she joked, her arms tightened around her daughter.

Evelyn watched them, a pang of sorrow tightening her chest.

"Oh," Bianca suddenly remembered, "I invited someone else you know."

Just then, Vivian arrived in a flurry.

Dressed more formally than usual, even her greeting was stiff—except for the pointed way she ignored Alexander.

"Miss Langley, here’s the proposal."

Alexander skimmed it and gave an almost imperceptible nod.

Evelyn exhaled in relief—it seemed well-prepared.

"Miss Langley," Vivian’s voice was tense, "I promise I won’t let you down."

Bianca cheerfully produced a contract. "Sign here."

Vivian’s hand trembled slightly. Even after signing, she seemed dazed.

Evelyn nudged her, snapping her out of it.

"Miss Langley!" Vivian clasped Bianca’s hands excitedly. "I’ll remember this kindness for the rest of my life!"

Bianca glanced at Alexander and Evelyn. "Thank them. I promised I’d invest if they took good care of my baby."

The baby giggled in her arms, and Vivian decided the little one was practically a lucky charm.

"By the way," Bianca asked curiously, "what did Alexander do to offend you?"

Vivian snorted. "Best friends and exes are natural enemies."
###Chapter 549: A Familiar Storyline

Alexander Hamilton had endured enough scolding from Andrew Anderson lately to become immune to Vivian Dempsey's sarcastic remarks.

"Got it," Bianca Langley raised an eyebrow with interest. "So does him securing my investment earn him any brownie points?"

Vivian pursed her lips. "Business is business. I still don't approve of him pestering Evelyn."

"Mr. Hamilton, take note. The revolution isn't over yet!"

Alexander rubbed his temples. "I'll take it slow. I'm correcting my mistakes—people need to see real change."

Evelyn ignored him, instead noticing the strain behind Bianca's smile.

Despite just returning from a relaxing hike, Bianca seemed more troubled than before.

"Miss Langley, I saw someone at the hotel last night," Evelyn began carefully.

"Who?"

"Vincent Croix," Alexander answered for her.

Bianca's smile froze. She took a sip of coffee, her voice tight. "What did he say?"

Evelyn frowned. "He said it was urgent but left when you weren't there. Has he been bothering you again?"

"Of course." Bianca covered Baby Chloe's ears and scoffed. "He won't stop until he gets what he wants. He didn't come all this way to leave empty-handed."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "What exactly is he after?"

Vivian clenched the contract nervously, fearing the deal might be jeopardized.

"Good news." Bianca forced a smile as she took a bite of cake. "I'll finally be able to divorce him. No more pretending."

The group collectively gasped.

Evelyn watched Bianca's forced cheerfulness and saw her own past reflection.

Bianca even managed a joke. "Don't look so shocked. It'll take a while before it's official."

Evelyn's heart ached as she glanced at the oblivious baby. "Did he initiate it? Why so suddenly?"

Bianca shrugged. "His mistress is pregnant. Probably wants legitimacy."

The storyline felt painfully familiar.

No wonder Vincent couldn't even recognize his own daughter. To him, she was just a byproduct of social climbing.

His real heir was growing in another woman's womb.

Alexander's expression darkened. Though he despised Vincent's infidelity, he was the last person qualified to judge.

Evelyn focused on practical concerns. "What will you do? Raising a child alone is tough."

"One step at a time." Bianca exhaled, smiling faintly. "I'm tired. It's time to free myself. As long as I have Chloe, I'll give her the world."

Her tone was light, but her hand never left the baby's ears.

Vivian seethed. "I hate cheaters! May his new woman betray him, and may that child not even be his!"

She shot Alexander a pointed glare.

He remained silent.

Bianca waved it off. "It doesn't matter. Just keep him away from me."

She called for a car.

"Since he's tracked me here, I shouldn't stay. I'll bring Chloe to visit another time."

Struggling to gather the baby's things, Bianca fumbled.

Evelyn stood immediately. "Let me help."

She and Vivian swiftly packed Chloe's belongings, even refilling the thermal bottle with hot water.

Alexander handed over newly purchased toys. "Take these. They'll come in handy."

"Thanks." Bianca adjusted Chloe in her arms and smiled. "Mr. Hamilton, Dr. Carter, if I ever end up homeless, I'll crash at your place."

Alexander agreed readily. "Anytime."

He deliberately said "we."

Vivian immediately pulled Evelyn aside. "Mr. Hamilton's mansion has staff for everything. Miss Langley, come to my place—Evelyn and I will cook for you!"

Bianca chuckled at Vivian's antics before leaving without another word.

Evelyn watched the car disappear, her chest tight.

Every fear about the baby had materialized.

Vivian fumed. "How could Vincent abandon someone like Bianca? Are all rich men blind?"

"Every family has its struggles," Evelyn murmured, seeing her past self again.

A call from Vivian's company forced her to leave.

Evelyn urged, "Go ahead. Don't delay your work."

Vivian tucked away the contract. "Evelyn, wait for my good news!"

"Let's both do our best."

As Vivian passed Alexander, she muttered something under her breath before walking off.

Alexander, focused on Evelyn, only caught fragments.

Evelyn translated, "She said thank you."

It was what she wanted to say too. Without Alexander's connections, Bianca's network wouldn't have been secured so smoothly.

Alexander replied simply, "It was nothing."
###Chapter 550: He Was Teaching Her

The room fell into heavy silence with just the two of them left.

Evelyn turned away first, striding back to the bedroom.

Alexander followed quietly, his footsteps barely audible.

The housekeeper had already cleared the room, leaving no trace of wood shavings. The chair shattered by Andrew Anderson might as well have never existed.

Evelyn stood by the bed, fingertips grazing the smooth sheets.

Even the lingering scent of Baby Chloe was gone.

Everything felt like a fleeting dream.

"I should've gotten her contact information," she murmured.

Alexander remained behind her. "I have Bianca's number."

"No need." Evelyn shook her head. "The baby needs her mother more. Miss Langley must be overwhelmed right now."

Alexander contemplated. "Vincent crossed the line this time. But the Langleys have deep roots—he won't take them down easily."

He was referring to the asset division.

Evelyn thought of emotions instead. "Men only grow crueler to their past loves after changing hearts. His mind's consumed by the new woman now."

Alexander's gaze darkened as he shifted topics. "Need my help?"

"You and Vincent have connections."

"The business world is a battlefield. No permanent allies."

Silence stretched between them.

"Should I assist Bianca?" he pressed.

"What could you possibly do? Vincent isn't an easy opponent."

"He's already struggling against the Langleys. Add me to the equation..."

Evelyn looked up. "Mutual destruction?"

"What outcome do you want?"

"I get to decide?"

"We can try."

His tone carried certainty despite the tentative words.

Evelyn shook her head again. "Let's wait. They loved each other once—Bianca might not have the heart..."

Alexander suddenly chuckled. "Not every woman cuts ties as cleanly as you, without hesitation or lingering attachments."

"You're blaming me?"

"Admiring you." His gaze deepened. "With your temperament, you'd have excelled even more in business."

Evelyn surveyed the empty room, chest tightening. "I need to work."

Alexander said no more, retrieving his laptop to settle on the sofa.

Keyboard taps soon filled the space as they worked separately.

Evelyn lost track of time when focused. From dawn till afternoon, she barely lifted her head. Alexander ordered room service for lunch.

The dishes matched the restaurant's offerings—nutritious meals paired with soup. Surprisingly suited to her taste, she ate slightly more than usual.

Alexander mentally noted her disliked dishes for future exclusion.

The Anderson Corporation files proved more complicated than expected. Dizziness creeping in, Evelyn froze upon lifting her water glass.

The liquid remained warm, carrying a faint sweetness.

"Added honey blossom tea in passing," Alexander said without looking up.

"Thanks." Her reply was polite.

Long accustomed to her distance, he continued, "You were reviewing Walter Fischer's records earlier."

Evelyn waited. His business insights held weight.

"That man has issues."

"The marketing director?" She frowned. "His performance metrics are suspiciously outstanding—like the entire department serves him alone. Overdependence on one person is dangerous."

Her sharpness surprised Alexander.

"Marketing should expand business, but concentrating all orders through one person is high-risk." He handed over new reports. "Post-resignation data."

Evelyn scrutinized the numbers, eyes burning but finding no discrepancies.

Watching her rub her temples, Alexander finally pointed out the crux: "The marketing department's finances don't add up."
###Chapter 551: Someone to Spend the Rest of My Life With

Evelyn Carter stared at the financial report on her computer screen, her fingers tapping the keyboard. Both medicine and finance required rigorous logical thinking. She tried using her doctor's analytical eye to spot anomalies.

But the numbers might as well have been hieroglyphics.

"Something's off," she murmured, frowning.

Alexander Hamilton stood behind her, scanning the screen. "The marketing department's travel expenses are ten times over budget."

"You remember details like that?"

"You think I was born a CEO?" He chuckled.

Evelyn suddenly understood. He'd climbed the corporate ladder step by step too.

"So the problem might be more obvious than I thought?"

Alexander nodded. "Smart people often outsmart themselves. Trying to cover his tracks left even more evidence."

Evelyn pulled up the product pricing list, cross-referencing rapidly. Her pen scratched across paper as she circled numbers.

"That's it." She handed him the report. "Hope we're not wrong about him."

Alexander took it, admiration flashing in his eyes. "Slow but thorough. You got everything right."

He pointed to one line. "Order volume doesn't match revenue."

"Why?"

"Two possibilities." He held up two fingers. "Bad debt, or he's taking kickbacks. At this volume, at least two million ended up in his pocket."

Evelyn's lips curled coldly. "Doctors excel at removing tumors."

She reached for the employee roster, but Alexander stopped her.

"Move against him now, and operations collapse. He's been entrenched at Anderson Corp for twenty years. Holds all the core resources."

Evelyn clenched her fists. "So I just tolerate it?"

"Train new talent as counterbalance first." Alexander advised. "Strike when the time is right."

"Where would I find new talent?" Evelyn gave a bitter laugh. "I don't know a soul at Anderson Corp."

Alexander extended his hand. "Let me see the personnel files."

He skimmed through, suddenly pausing at one name. "This one could work."

"Too young, no?" Evelyn questioned.

A phone rang. Alexander glanced at the screen. "I need to take this."

He strode out, gently closing the door behind him.

Emily Zade's voice came through. "It's done, Mr. Hamilton."

"Good."

"Peter Harrison agreed to go to Fiji."

Alexander's gaze turned icy. "Keep eyes on him. He doesn't get near Evelyn again."

"Already handled."

Emily hesitated. "You've changed. The old you wouldn't have let Peter off so easily."

Alexander looked at the closed door, his voice softening. "Yes. I've found someone to spend the rest of my life with."
###Chapter 552: The Final Gamble

Emily Zade sighed softly. "You've known the answer all along."

Alexander Hamilton lowered his gaze, his fingers absently tracing the edge of his phone. "I was too stubborn. I noticed Annabelle had changed completely from the girl I knew, yet I refused to face the truth."

"Mr. Hamilton," Emily hesitated before continuing, "though I'm your subordinate, as a woman, my heart aches more for Mrs. Hamilton."

"...I understand."

Years of默契 rendered further words unnecessary.

Alexander suddenly asked, "If you were in her place, would you forgive me?"

Emily looked uncomfortable. "Mr. Hamilton, I'm not Mrs. Hamilton. My choice doesn't reflect hers."

Silence stretched across the line.

Just as Emily considered changing the subject, Alexander spoke again. "Any updates from the hospital?"

"The Taylors are stable, but..." She paused. "Miss Taylor went to Mr. and Mrs. Taylor's room again."

Alexander's voice turned glacial. "What does she want now?"

Emily glanced toward the病房. "The same old tactics. When she couldn't manipulate you, she turned to Mr. and Mrs. Taylor."

A glass slammed down audibly through the phone.

"The situation escalated," Emily whispered. "Miss Taylor caused a scene, and Mrs. Taylor's condition worsened—"

Before she could finish, Anthony Taylor's enraged shout erupted from the room. "Stop! Don't touch her!"

"Let me ask Mom if she really wants to abandon me!" Annabelle's hysterical shriek pierced the hallway.

Emily rushed forward. "Mr. Hamilton, should I have security remove her?"

"Now." Alexander's tone could have frozen hell.

Chaos reigned inside the病房.

Annabelle leaned halfway out the window, screaming through tears. "Watch me die then! Watch my blood stain the pavement!"

Teresa Taylor's face drained of color, her breathing labored beneath the oxygen mask.

Anthony's hands trembled. "After raising you for twenty years, this is how you repay us?"

"Raised me?" Annabelle sneered. "I was just a replacement! Even my name belonged to your real daughter!"

Whispers spread through the gathered crowd.

"What's wrong with this family?"
"That woman threatening to jump is their adopted daughter..."
"How tragic..."

A glint of triumph flashed in Annabelle's eyes as she raised her voice. "Dad, give me half the family assets, and I'll disappear. Otherwise—"

"Otherwise what?" A cool female voice cut through the tension.

The crowd stilled.

Annabelle whirled around, her face paling instantly.

Evelyn Carter stood at the forefront, her gaze steady. "If you're going to jump, do it quickly. Don't waste everyone's time."
###Chapter 553 Annabelle's End

Annabelle stood on the windowsill, her legs trembling violently.

Her fingers clung to the window frame like a lifeline. She didn't even dare to glance down.

"Jump! Why hesitate now?"

Emily Zade strode forward in sharp heels, flanked by black-suited bodyguards. The crisp click of her stilettos echoed through the hallway.

Annabelle's face drained of color.

"You..." Her lips quivered. "How dare you say that? This is incitement to suicide!"

Emily's lips curled into a frosty smile.

"Miss Taylor, the Taylors raised you for twenty years. They funded your overseas education, clothed you in luxury. And how did you repay them? By nearly burning their biological daughter alive. Now you're causing a scene at the hospital?"

Whispers rippled through the gathered crowd.

Annabelle's cheeks burned crimson.

"That was all Evelyn's—"

"Her what?" Emily cut in sharply. "She almost died because of you! The Taylers showed mercy by not sending you to prison. And now you're harassing your adoptive mother on her deathbed?"

Inside the hospital room, Anthony Taylor supported his swaying wife Teresa, his expression stormy.

"Emily," he said wearily, "did Alexander authorize this?"

"Yes, Mr. Taylor."

"Then proceed as he instructed." Anthony closed his eyes briefly. "We... sever all ties with her."

Panic flashed across Annabelle's face.

"Dad! Mom! You'd really watch me die?"

Teresa suddenly hurled a glass of water at her.

"Did you think about Evelyn dying when you pushed her into that fire?"

Shards of glass exploded at Annabelle's feet. She shrieked and stumbled backward.

Emily gave a subtle nod.

Two bodyguards immediately seized Annabelle's arms.

"Let me go!" She thrashed wildly. "Alexander loves me! If you dare touch me—"

A sharp chop to her neck.

Annabelle went limp in the bodyguard's arms.

On the phone, Alexander's voice was glacial. "Handled?"

"Knocked out." Emily glanced at the unconscious figure being loaded into a car. "She was pulling Mrs. Taylor's hair. We had no choice."

Alexander's eyes darkened.

"Proceed as planned."

The black sedan pulled away from the hospital, heading for the outskirts.

Annabelle woke to the jolting motion.

"Where is this?" She clawed at the window in terror. "Where are you taking me?"

Emily didn't look up from her phone. "To your final destination."

Annabelle's entire body shook. Suddenly she gasped. "Lydia knows I came to the hospital! She'll call the police when I disappear!"

Silence filled the car.

Finally, Emily lifted her head and gestured to a bodyguard.

"Too noisy."

A chloroform-soaked cloth clamped over Annabelle's mouth and nose.

She fought desperately, her nails leaving white scratches on the leather seats.

"Lyd...ia..."

As consciousness faded, she heard Emily tell the driver:

"Step on it. We're behind schedule."
###Chapter 554: Annabelle's Downfall

Darkness swallowed Annabelle's consciousness. When she opened her eyes again, the pungent smell of mold assaulted her senses.

The rough wooden bed beneath her dug into her skin. The coarse sheets chafed against her body. She bolted upright, nails digging into her palms. "Where is this? Did you kidnap me?"

A dim yellow bulb flickered to life with a click.

Only then did Annabelle see the cramped room—its single window barred with iron rods. Beyond it stretched an endless void of darkness.

Emily Zade entered, her heels clicking coldly against the floorboards.

"Awake?" She stood by the door, eyeing Annabelle like inventory awaiting disposal.

Annabelle lunged forward. "Let me out! My parents will call the police when they realize I'm missing!"

Her frantic gaze swept the room—peeling walls, mold-speckled ceiling, even the door lock was an antiquated bolt.

Emily chuckled. "The police? Do you know where you are?"

Annabelle froze. Outside the window, unfamiliar languages mingled with children's cries.

"An overseas orphanage funded annually by Mr. Hamilton." Emily adjusted her cuffs with deliberate calm. "Quite fitting for you."

Annabelle's nails screeched against the wooden door. "You're insane! I'm a Taylor heiress!"

"Were." Emily turned away. "Now you're just another caretaker here."

The door gaped open, mocking her helplessness.

Annabelle sprinted out. At the corridor's end, dark-skinned children stared at her with vacant curiosity. Their stained clothes clung to malnourished frames.

This bore no resemblance to any orphanage she'd known.

"Take me home!" She grabbed a passing nun. "I'll pay any price for a plane ticket!"

The nun regarded her with pity. "Child, this is your home now."

Night fell. Annabelle finally spotted an escape route—only to collapse in terror at the sight beyond the gates. Primeval forests loomed like monstrous jaws around the decaying compound. Distant animal howls pierced the air.

She staggered back inside, where the matron intercepted her outside an office.

"Starting tomorrow, you'll tend to disabled children on the third floor." The matron extended a set of burlap work clothes.

Annabelle hurled them to the ground. "Do you have any idea who I am?"

The matron retrieved the garments calmly. "A soul in need of redemption."

Moonlight through the barred window painted Annabelle's ashen face. At last, she understood—no one was coming to save her.
###Chapter 555: Thirty Years of Atonement – Not a Day Less

"Thirty years?" Annabelle's voice rose sharply, her nails digging into her palms. "Have you lost your minds?"

The matron adjusted her cuffs with deliberate calm. "You stole thirty years of someone else's life. Consider this restitution."

Annabelle trembled, her flawless makeup cracking under the dim light. "I demand to see my parents! They won't abandon me!"

"Miss Taylor," the matron chuckled, "who do you think delivered you here?"

The words struck like a hammer, rooting Annabelle to the spot.

Scuffling noises came from the corridor. A cluster of preteens peered out, their eyes glinting like wolf cubs.

"Stop staring!" Annabelle shrieked.

A brick fragment whizzed past her ear, leaving a white scar on the wall.

"You little beasts!" She lunged forward, only to retreat under a hail of pebbles. Mud smeared her cashmere coat, reeking of decay.

The children erupted in laughter. One mimicked her in a singsong voice: "I demand to see my parents—"

Tears streaked through Annabelle's foundation. Suddenly she remembered the temperature-controlled pool at the Taylor mansion, the cookies Teresa used to bake.

"Dinner." A nun materialized at the corridor's end.

The cafeteria stank of mildew. Annabelle gagged at the sight of the grayish-green sludge in the pot.

"Where's my portion?" She blocked the departing nun.

The woman gave her an indifferent glance. "You earn your meals here. That's the rule."

In the kitchen, rats gnawed at potatoes piled in a corner. Annabelle's hands shook as she lit the stove. Steam scalded her fingers crimson.

"Smells delicious." Small faces emerged from the shadows.

Before she could react, the potato pot vanished. She tripped over an outstretched foot while chasing them, her forehead smacking the doorframe.

Blood dripped into the floorboard cracks. Distant chewing sounds echoed merrily.

The matron stood at the stairwell, cradling a tattered Bible.

"They'll kill me..." Annabelle crawled to clutch her trousers.

The matron bent down, skeletal fingers brushing blood-matted hair. "Then consider it penance, darling."

Moonlight striped the floor through iron bars like prison shadows. Curled on a reeking cot, Annabelle heard nails scratching wood outside her door.

"New girl," a child's voice whispered, "see you tomorrow."

In the darkness, Annabelle finally broke into sobs. This time, no one would murmur "Don't cry, Belle" with tender hands.
###Chapter 556: The Biter Bit

Annabelle Taylor huddled in the corner, her throat parched like scorched earth.

Her trembling fingers groped in the dark until they found the kitchen water jug. Ignoring the floating dust particles, she tilted her head back and gulped down the icy liquid.

Cold droplets traced paths down her chin, staining her grimy collar.

The wild children had stolen the dinner she'd painstakingly prepared. Now they slept soundly in warm beds while she shivered.

Moonlight filtered through the broken window, casting fractured shadows across the floor.

Annabelle bit her lip until she tasted copper, nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

A memory surfaced—the antique telephone in the headmaster's office.

The wooden stairs creaked under her tiptoed steps.

The office door swung open with a whisper.

Her shaking hands lifted the receiver, but froze mid-dial.

Who could she call?

Her fair-weather friends had vanished like morning mist when misfortune struck.

Her father's face flashed before her eyes.

"Dad!" she sobbed the moment the line connected. "I'm at the orphanage—these brats are tormenting me—"

Silence. Then the decisive click of disconnection.

She redialed with frantic fingers. This time, not even a ringtone answered.

The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth as she gnawed her lip raw.

Lydia Laurent's number remained—her final gambit.

"Annabelle?" Lydia's saccharine voice chirped through the receiver.

Annabelle clutched the phone like a lifeline. "Lydia, please help me!"

Her words tumbled out in a hysterical jumble, punctuated by hiccuping sobs.

"But..." Lydia's voice dripped with faux innocence. "Wouldn't Alexander be furious?"

Annabelle stamped her foot. "He won't blame you! Just contact Emily Zade—I'll pay any—"

A giggle.

Sharp as broken glass.

Annabelle's spine turned to ice. "What's so funny?"

"You are." Lydia's tone shifted, honey laced with venom. "Discarded pawns belong in the trash."

The blood drained from Annabelle's face. "You—"

"Playing dumb was exhausting." Lydia's laughter tinkled like wind chimes in a graveyard. "Game over."

The dial tone echoed through the empty office.

Footsteps approached down the hall.

Annabelle fled blindly, collapsing onto her mildew-scented cot.

Something skittered across her hand.

She flung the blanket aside—

A palm-sized spider crouched inches from her fingers in the moonlight.

Her scream shattered the night.

Children's mocking laughter floated through the window.

"Serves her right!"

"Look at her now!"

Annabelle slumped to the floor, watching the arachnid amble away.

Moonbeams illuminated her ghostly pallor.

At last, she understood the meaning of karma.
###Chapter 557: The Ragdoll's Unexpected Surprise

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow on Evelyn Carter's face.

She slowly opened her eyes, finding herself nestled in a plush bed.

Hadn't she fallen asleep reviewing documents in the study last night?

Rubbing her temples, Evelyn tried to recall the previous evening.

Suddenly, a warm, damp sensation brushed against her palm.

She bolted upright and spotted a ball of snowy fur curled beside her pillow.

A palm-sized Ragdoll kitten was licking her fingers with its tiny pink tongue.

"Meow~"

The kitten's baby-blue eyes sparkled like sapphires as it let out a milky cry.

Instinctively, Evelyn cupped the wobbly creature in her hands.

How did such a tiny kitten end up in her bed?

The sound of a turning lock interrupted her thoughts.

Only one person would enter her suite unannounced.

Alexander Hamilton had become her shadow since she'd checked into this hotel.

"Leave breakfast here," his baritone voice mingled with the clink of porcelain.

The bedroom door creaked open as he entered with a breakfast tray.

His lips curved when he spotted the kitten in Evelyn's arms.

The kitten immediately perked its tail and gave him a soft mewl.

"Care to explain?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Found it on the street," Alexander set the tray on the nightstand.

"Do I look three to you?"

"Fine," he shrugged. "Bought it from a breeder."

Evelyn studied the tiny creature. "Do you even know how to care for something this small?"

"Not for me," Alexander's gaze turned meaningful. "For you."

"I never said I wanted a cat."

"But you've raised dogs before." He produced a receipt from his pocket. "Purebred Ragdoll with full pedigree papers."

The kitten rolled onto its back, exposing its downy belly.

Evelyn couldn't resist giving it a gentle scratch.

"Did you scam another child at Kids' Wonderland?" A realization struck her.

Alexander stiffened. "Not this time."

"Forgotten the lollipop incident already?"

"That was fair trade," he said solemnly. "My cufflinks could buy a truckload of Alpenliebes."

Evelyn checked the kitten's paws. "This little one needs specialized care. Do you have time for that?"

"Precisely why," Alexander leaned closer, "it's your gift."

His cologne blended with the aroma of breakfast filled the space between them.

Evelyn leaned back. "I don't need gifts."

"But it needs you." He nodded at the bundle in her arms. "The breeder said it's particular about owners."

As if on cue, the kitten nuzzled Evelyn's chin.

"See?" Alexander's smirk widened. "It's chosen you."

Evelyn sighed. "Pets aren't toys."

"Got everything covered." Like a magician, he produced a pet carrier. "Litter box, bowls, toys—all here."

The array of supplies left Evelyn speechless.

"Want to freshen up first?" Alexander reached for the kitten. "I'll watch it."

After a hesitation, she relinquished the tiny creature.

It settled contentedly in Alexander's arms, reminding Evelyn oddly of how he cradled infants.

"Ten minutes for breakfast." She headed to the bathroom, missing the triumphant quirk of his lips.
###Chapter 558: You Carried Me to Bed?

Alexander Hamilton tiptoed out of the bedroom with the Ragdoll cat in his arms, quietly closing the door behind him. The soft click of the lock left Evelyn Carter alone in the space.

Rubbing her temples, Evelyn still felt the lingering effects of last night's research marathon. After a quick wash, she tied up her long hair, her bare face still showing traces of exhaustion.

The aroma of century egg and pork congee drifted from the dining area. Alexander sat at the table, one hand stroking the cat in his lap while lifting the insulated lid with the other.

"Eat something first." He pushed a perfectly warmed bowl toward her.

Evelyn took a spoonful. The congee had been simmered to perfection—soft yet retaining just enough texture. Several refreshing side dishes were arranged beside it, their colors coordinated like an art piece.

Midway through her meal, she suddenly noticed a gaze upon her. Looking up, she met Alexander's focused eyes.

"Aren't you eating?"

"Already did." His fingers lightly scratched under the cat's chin. "You were sleeping so soundly, I didn't want to wake you."

Evelyn paused, instinctively glancing at the wall clock—10:15 AM. Rarely one to oversleep, the tips of her ears grew warm.

The Ragdoll rolled onto its back on Alexander's lap, exposing its soft belly. His slender fingers expertly massaged behind the cat's ears, eliciting contented purrs.

"The doctor said you need rest." Alexander checked his watch. "How was your sleep quality?"

Evelyn set down her spoon. "Did you carry me to bed?"

"No." Alexander maintained a straight face. "That was Alexander East."

"..."

"Don't believe me?"

"I do." Evelyn deadpanned. "Please thank Mr. Alexander East for me."

Amusement flickered in Alexander's eyes. "He said not to mention it. We seven brothers—East, West, North, South, Center, Fortune, and White—are always happy to help."

Evelyn nearly choked on her congee. Wiping her mouth, she put down the bowl. "Keep going with your tall tales."

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting scattered light between them. Alexander suddenly said softly, "Bickering with you like this feels... nice."

"Life is made of these little moments, isn't it?" Evelyn stirred her congee absently. "We can't be performing in a drama every day."

Alexander nodded. "So, did you sleep well last night? I noticed you were frowning in your sleep."

"It was fine." She pressed her lips together. "Just overslept and delayed my work."

At this hour, her entire morning schedule had been disrupted. Sighing, she added, "Can skip lunch."

Alexander fed the cat a treat. "You've already mastered the theoretical knowledge. Proper relaxation actually aids digestion."

"Time waits for no one." Evelyn frowned. "The Anderson Group—"

"I promised to help you." Alexander interrupted. "My word stands."

Her fingers unconsciously traced the cat's soft fur. "Thank you, but I can handle it myself."

Rising toward the study, her retreating figure carried an air of detachment. Alexander watched her go, his fingers tightening slightly.

The Ragdoll suddenly leapt from his lap, darting after Evelyn. She quickly bent to catch the furry bundle, her fingertips accidentally brushing against Alexander's outstretched hand.

Both withdrew simultaneously. Alexander's expression remained neutral. "I've already spoken with your father. He'll fully cooperate with you."

"Unnecessary." Evelyn set the cat on the sofa. "Hamilton Group must be busy too."

She opened last night's notebook, the pages rustling faintly. Alexander stood his ground. "This assistance truly requires no repayment."

Without looking up, Evelyn tapped the documents. "You said the same thing last time in the capital." Her finger paused on a page. "And how did that turn out?"

Only the sound of turning pages filled the study. Watching her focused profile bathed in sunlight, Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed before he quietly closed the door behind him.
###Chapter 559: Technology Transforms Lives

Alexander Hamilton knew he was at fault—this was entirely his responsibility.

He rubbed the bridge of his nose, softening his tone. "Compensation..."

His slender fingers gently scratched the kitten under its chin. "At least let me clean the litter box?"

Evelyn Carter didn’t look up. "No."

"Why not?"

"You just taught me that work and personal life should remain separate." Her fingers tapped the keyboard. "Helping me with company matters is work. Home is private."

The image of Gregory Wilson walking his dog flashed through Alexander’s mind, making his lips twitch.

That avenue was already closed.

It wasn’t that pets weren’t adorable—it was that her defenses were too high.

Seeing his silence, Evelyn delivered the final blow: "Cleaning the litter box is quick. I can handle it myself. And—"

She turned her phone screen toward him.

Displayed prominently was an advertisement for a "Smart Self-Cleaning Litter Box."

"Technology transforms lives."

Alexander: "..."

The Ragdoll kitten, tired from playing, leaped gracefully onto Evelyn’s lap. Its soft fur brushed against her wrist as it let out a tiny, mewling "meow."

With one hand stroking the cat and the other editing reports, Evelyn multitasked effortlessly.

Behind her, Alexander could only open his laptop to sort through emails.

He skimmed the overseas project report from Emily Zade before closing it immediately.

This matter was finally, completely over.

Just as Evelyn was about to resume her calculations, her phone rang.

Olivia Lightfoot.

"You have time to call? Isn’t the OB-GYN department busy?"

A wail came through the phone. "Swamped! Dr. Carter, I snuck out to beg for help!"

"What’s so urgent?"

Hearing it was Olivia, Alexander’s tense shoulders relaxed. Watching the slight upward curve of Evelyn’s lips, his gaze softened.

It had been a long time since she’d looked this at ease.

Loving the right person made even being an observer a joy.

As for that mistake...

Alexander lowered his eyes. Everything was finally back on track.

Two "Evelyns," each in their rightful place.

Olivia’s voice trembled. "I had a patient today who came specifically to see you. When the test results came in, I nearly fainted!"

Evelyn frowned. "What’s the situation?"

"A bride-to-be, here for a premarital checkup. But she kept dodging questions about why her fiancé didn’t come." Olivia dropped her voice. "The report shows..."

"Send it to me."

The ultrasound and hormone reports arrived instantly.

Evelyn stared at the screen, her frown deepening.

"Congenital uterine hypoplasia." She sighed. "You saw it too, didn’t you?"

Olivia’s voice shook. "She’s barely twenty. Her eyes lit up when she talked about her fiancé. I just... couldn’t..."

"I understand." Evelyn gently stroked the kitten. "But medicine has its limits."

"Her fiancé is much older. He’s desperate for a child..."

Silence hung heavy on both ends of the line.

The kitten suddenly nuzzled Evelyn’s hand, its round eyes gazing up as if asking: Why so sad?
###Chapter 560 Lydia's Secret

"Dr. Carter, this patient's condition..." Olivia's voice wavered over the phone.

Evelyn paused while reviewing medical records. "What's wrong?"

"Her uterine hypoplasia is severe. Natural conception is nearly impossible." Olivia sighed. "How should I break the news?"

Evelyn tapped her desk. "Be honest but gentle. We're doctors, not miracle workers."

"But she's barely twenty. Just got engaged..." Olivia's voice trailed off.

The Ragdoll cat stretched on Evelyn's lap, exposing its fluffy belly. She absently stroked its fur while staring at her computer screen.

"Olivia, our job is medical counsel, not life decisions."

Silence filled the line for several seconds.

"I know, but..." Olivia choked up. "She seemed so excited about married life."

Alexander entered with coffee, noticing Evelyn's tension. He moved quietly.

Sensing his approach, Evelyn angled away from the screen. "Email me the test results first."

After hanging up, Evelyn stared at the opened file. Alexander sat beside her, and the cat immediately jumped onto his lap.

"Hospital emergency?" he asked.

Evelyn didn't answer, her gaze locked on the name—Lydia Laurent.

Age 22. Prenuptial exam. Uterine hypoplasia.

The combination made her heart skip.

"Something wrong?" Alexander noticed her stiffness.

Evelyn snapped the laptop shut. "Patient confidentiality."

Her reaction was too sharp. Alexander frowned but didn't press further.

The cat suddenly pounced on the keyboard, accidentally clicking the mouse. The report flashed back onscreen.

"Is that—" Alexander's eyes landed on the document.

Evelyn slammed the laptop. "I said it's private!"

Her raised voice startled the cat under the sofa.

Alexander blinked, then raised his hands. "Alright. I won't look."

Olivia called again, frantic. "Dr. Carter! The fiancé's here. They're arguing in the exam room."

Evelyn gripped her phone. "On my way."

She grabbed her coat. Alexander blocked the door. "I'll drive."

"No!" The refusal came too fast. She forced calm. "I mean... I can handle hospital matters alone."

Alexander studied her face. "You know that patient."

A statement, not a question.

Evelyn exhaled. "Yes."

"Who?"

"Lydia Laurent."

The air turned to ice. Alexander's expression shifted from confusion to shock, then blankness.

"Certain?"

"Name, age, premarital exam—all match." Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "Guess her innocent act had a reason."

The silence stretched until the cat emerged, rubbing against Alexander's ankle.

"I'm driving you." His voice was low.

En route, Evelyn's phone kept buzzing. Olivia updated: Fiancé called off the engagement. Lydia collapsed in tears.

Watching blurring scenery, Evelyn suddenly asked, "What would you do?"

Alexander tightened his grip on the wheel. "I'm not that man."

"But you're both men."

At a red light, he turned. "Her health would come first. Not fertility."

Evelyn scoffed. "Textbook answer."

"You doubt me?"

"My opinion doesn't matter." Evelyn stared ahead. "Lydia needs a doctor now, not moral judgments."

The car accelerated toward the hospital. The Ragdoll's soft purring filled the backseat, a quiet comfort for two troubled souls.
###Chapter 561: Alexander's Protective Escort

Evelyn stared at the documents in her hands, her thoughts drifting far away. The name on the ultrasound report was like a thorn, pricking her heart with a dull ache.

Alexander approached with a cup of floral tea, placing it gently beside her. The fragrant steam curled upward, but failed to dispel the shadow over her brow.

"What's on your mind?" he asked.

She shook her head, pulling the Ragdoll cat closer against her chest. The soft fur against her fingers brought her back slightly, and she resumed flipping through the files.

Alexander didn't press further, retreating to his own workspace. The office was silent except for the rustling of paper.

At three in the afternoon, he abruptly closed his laptop. "Time to go."

Evelyn didn't look up. "Where?"

"Meeting some key members of Anderson Group." He walked over and tapped the personnel file she was reviewing. "Face-to-face talks are better than just reading reports."

She closed the folder, her gaze lingering on the names circled in red.

"Give me five minutes."

As she stood, the cat nuzzled against her with a pleading whimper. Alexander seized the opportunity to scoop it up, expertly tucking it into a pet carrier.

"You're bringing it along?" Evelyn frowned.

He lifted the carrier and gave it a slight shake. "Can't just leave her here alone."

Seeing the cat's pitiful eyes, she didn't object further.

The restaurant was the most exclusive private dining spot in the city. The moment they entered, the manager personally escorted them to the innermost private room.

Four people stood in unison when the door opened.

"Mr. Hamilton."

Evelyn noted that three of them were the individuals she had highlighted in the files.

Alexander smoothly pulled out a chair for her. "This is Evelyn Carter, the new CEO of Anderson Group."

The four exchanged knowing glances.

"An honor to meet you, Ms. Carter," the bespectacled man spoke first. "I'm Zhou Ming from Finance."

The others introduced themselves in turn. Evelyn memorized each—they headed Finance, HR, Marketing, and R&D, the core departments.

Only after the pleasantries did Alexander speak again, his tone measured. "Evelyn is new here. She'll be relying on your support."

The words were polite, but everyone caught the underlying message.

Zhou Ming immediately responded, "Don't worry, Mr. Hamilton. We'll give Ms. Carter our full cooperation."

"Absolutely," the Marketing Director chimed in. "Just let us know what you need, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn lifted her teacup, studying their expressions through the steam. Their deference was surface-level; their eyes held scrutiny.

"As the new head of Anderson Group, I do need your support," she set the cup down, her voice steady. "But what I truly hope for is the same level of dedication you've shown Mr. Hamilton."

The room fell silent.

Alexander's lips curved slightly as he tapped the table twice. "Evelyn's words are mine."

The statement struck like thunder, leaving the four visibly unsettled.

Zhou Ming recovered first. "Naturally! Ms. Carter is young and capable. We're honored to work with her."

The others echoed enthusiastically, their attitudes noticeably warmer.

From the corner of her eye, Evelyn caught Alexander's satisfied look. She understood—he was paving her way. But his method was undeniably bold.

Midway through dinner, conversation turned to company affairs. Zhou Ming lowered his voice during a toast. "Ms. Carter, there's something you should know."

She set down her chopsticks. "Go ahead."

"The board of directors recently..." He hesitated, glancing at Alexander.

Alexander, focused on feeding the cat, didn't look up. "Anderson Group's matters are entirely Evelyn's decisions now."

Zhou Ming took the hint. "A few senior board members have voiced discontent about the leadership change, especially Director Wang..."

Evelyn listened impassively before nodding. "Thank you for the heads-up, Director Zhou."

When they left, the night was deep. Alexander carried the pet carrier and suddenly asked, "How do you feel?"

Evelyn gazed at the distant neon lights. "Smoother than expected."

"Those four have worked under me for five years. Their competence isn't in question." He paused. "Their loyalty is for you to verify."

She turned to him. "Why go this far to help me?"

The night breeze lifted her hair. Alexander reached out as if to tuck it behind her ear but stopped mid-motion. "Consider it... atonement."

The Ragdoll mewed softly in the carrier, breaking the delicate tension between them.

Evelyn looked away. "Let's go back. Tomorrow's another battle."

She didn't see the restrained tenderness in Alexander's gaze as he watched her leave.
###Chapter 562 Schrödinger's Hearing

Alexander's gaze involuntarily drifted toward Evelyn.

She was engrossed in the menu, her slender fingers gliding across the pages, seemingly oblivious to the earlier "Mrs. Hamilton" remark.

"At the office, she's to be addressed as Director Carter," Alexander corrected firmly.

Evelyn finally looked up, her lips curving into a perfectly measured smile. "Since you're all senior colleagues, just call me by my name in private."

The atmosphere in the private dining room froze momentarily.

The four guests exchanged glances—so she had pretended not to hear earlier, but now responded swiftly?

"Director Carter, you're too modest," one quickly smoothed over, "Protocol must be observed."

Evelyn's fingertip paused lightly on the menu. "I mean it."

The air turned abruptly silent.

All four pairs of eyes darted toward Alexander, beads of sweat forming on their foreheads. How had their flattery somehow ignited tension?

Alexander massaged his temples. "Do as Director Carter says."

"Yes, of course!" They sighed in relief. "Director Carter is young and capable, surely destined to succeed Chairman Anderson. We're just getting accustomed in advance..."

Evelyn suddenly chuckled softly. "The future can wait until it arrives."

Her lashes lowered, casting delicate shadows under the lighting. Their surface-level respect couldn't mask the curiosity in their eyes—what they truly cared about was Alexander's stance.

"Let's order," Alexander deftly shifted the topic, sliding the menu toward Evelyn.

She didn't take it. "Our senior colleagues should go first."

"Director Carter, please choose!"

Watching their nervous deference, Evelyn found it almost laughable. Just how intimidating had Alexander been to make these seasoned professionals tremble like this?

"I'll do it." Alexander retrieved the menu, giving brief instructions to the server with emphasis: "Light on oil and salt."

The server hesitated. "Four dishes might not be enough for four guests..."

"Evelyn's currently recuperating," Alexander explained. "Order whatever else you like."

The eldest guest's hands shook as he accepted the menu. Selecting dishes felt like defusing a bomb, terrified of triggering Director Carter's displeasure.

The food arrived swiftly.

Evelyn quietly ate her bland dishes while listening to the executives' cautious reports. These substantive discussions were far more interesting than empty pleasantries, and her appetite improved as she focused.

Alexander occasionally used serving chopsticks to add food to her plate, the motion so practiced it seemed habitual.

As dusk deepened, the dinner finally concluded.

The four guests practically fled after their farewells, leaving only the two of them—and an impatient Ragdoll in its carrier.

"Meow~"

Evelyn's heart melted instantly as she carefully cradled the fluffy ball. "Be good, no running around."

The kitten nuzzled against her, purring contentedly.

Watching this, warmth flickered in Alexander's eyes. "Does it understand?"

"Understanding isn't necessary," Evelyn stroked the soft fur. "We'll teach it gradually."

Alexander gazed out the window. "Shall we walk by the lily ponds? You've never properly seen the night view here."

Evelyn's hand stilled slightly.

She remembered—their first visit, when he'd nearly drowned someone by those ponds; their second, when Lydia and Annabelle had taken photos there.

Some scenery, once tainted, could never be cleansed.
###Chapter 563: Borrowing Power

Evelyn Carter frowned slightly as her gaze swept across the lotus pond. "The scenery here doesn't compare to the mountains at all."

Alexander Hamilton lifted the cat carrier, his eyes never leaving her retreating figure. "Should we head back now?"

He maintained a respectful distance, following her like a shadow. The Ragdoll cat in her arms yawned, revealing a tiny pink tongue.

As they passed through the covered walkway, Alexander deliberately slowed his pace. "If you have any questions about the Anderson project they mentioned earlier, feel free to ask me anytime."

"Thank you." Evelyn stroked the cat's soft fur. "But next time, just make the introduction. I don't want to be the fox borrowing the tiger's might anymore."

The way those four executives had obeyed Alexander's every word had left a bitter taste in her mouth.

Alexander's expression darkened as he stared at their overlapping shadows on the ground. "Understood."

Neon lights stretched their silhouettes long and thin as they exited the private dining club.

"I'll get the car." Alexander pointed toward the nearby shopping district. "Wait here."

Evelyn nodded. The Ragdoll suddenly nuzzled her wrist, its round blue eyes reminding her of Bianca Langley's youngest daughter—those same chubby cheeks and innocent gaze.

After babysitting for a few days, she'd caught herself unconsciously glancing at maternity stores. This sudden maternal instinct made her think of Teresa Taylor's doting love for Annabelle.

Had Annabelle grown up in an orphanage, perhaps she would've turned out kinder.

"Lydia?" A girl's surprised voice rang out.

Evelyn looked up to see Lydia Laurent linking arms with a friend, smiling as sweetly as a porcelain doll in a display window.

"Evelyn!" Lydia skipped over, her skirt fluttering. "What a coincidence!"

The Ragdoll's fur suddenly bristled. It swatted at Lydia's outstretched hand.

"Ow!" Lydia recoiled, a flash of venom in her eyes before she quickly replaced it with a wounded pout. "It doesn't like me."

Evelyn shielded the cat protectively. "She's shy around strangers."

Lydia tilted her head, undeterred. "Let's be friends, okay?" She reached for the cat's ears.

Evelyn sidestepped the gesture. "Your friends are waiting, Miss Laurent."

"They don't mind." Lydia batted her innocent doe eyes. "Are you alone? Want to join us shopping?"

"No."

Lydia suddenly leaned in, overwhelming perfume preceding her. "Do you hate me, Evelyn?"

Evelyn took a step back just as Alexander's car pulled up.

"I'm waiting for someone." She walked toward the parking area, the cat cradled against her chest, her posture radiating aloofness.

Lydia remained rooted in place, her saccharine smile slowly freezing. She pulled out her phone and typed a rapid message.

"Did you find out?" she whispered into the receiver, her eyes turning as cold as poisoned ice.
###Chapter 564: Words That Cut Deep

Evelyn Carter studied Lydia Laurent's face for several seconds.

"No," she replied calmly.

Lydia blinked her large, innocent eyes. "Evelyn, I don't understand what you're saying. But if you don't want to go shopping, that's fine." She abruptly changed the subject. "By the way, have you seen Alexander recently? He's not answering my calls."

Evelyn recalled Olivia mentioning that patients would collect their reports this afternoon.

"You came to this party right after your appointment?" she asked pointedly.

"Of course," Lydia smiled sweetly. "A male classmate is having a birthday, and I wanted Alexander's help picking a gift." Her tone turned sly. "Evelyn, why did you leave the resort so suddenly that day?"

"Business." Evelyn kept her answer short.

Regarding Alexander, she added, "We're not close. Contact him yourself."

Just as Lydia opened her mouth to respond, a familiar car pulled up.

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

Perfect timing.

Alexander Hamilton parked and walked straight to Evelyn. "Let me hold the cat. Get in the car."

The Ragdoll obediently curled into his arms. He guided Evelyn to the passenger seat with a hand hovering near her shoulder—close enough to steady her if needed, but never actually touching.

Evelyn slid into the car without a word.

Alexander carefully returned the cat to her lap before shutting the door. His movements were practiced, as if he'd done this a thousand times.

Lydia finally rushed forward. "Alexander! I was just asking Evelyn if she'd seen you." Her lower lip trembled. "She lied and said she hadn't. Does she not want you talking to me?"

As Evelyn fastened her seatbelt, an overwhelming scent of artificial sweetness filled the air.

"What do you want?" Alexander didn't turn around.

"I need help choosing a birthday gift for—"

"Not interested." He opened the driver's door. "Our engagement is over."

Lydia's smile froze. "Do you think I'm childish?"

"Do you?"

"..."

"Truly childish people don't announce it," Alexander said coldly. "That's just an excuse."

Tears welled in Lydia's eyes. "But we agreed to be like siblings! Did Evelyn say something to—"

"This has nothing to do with her." Alexander took his seat. "She wasn't even aware when I discussed business with your father."

Lydia twisted her fingers together. "Maybe I misunderstood. When we spoke on the phone..."

Her voice trailed off, waiting for Alexander to take the bait.

But he'd already started the engine.

The Ragdoll suddenly arched its back. "Meow!"

The shrill cry echoed through the car. Evelyn followed the cat's gaze out the window—

Lydia still stood there.

When their eyes met, the venom in Lydia's stare could no longer be hidden. Her sweet features contorted into something straight out of a horror movie.

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine.

She turned away, gently stroking the trembling cat.

"Meow..." The Ragdoll shivered against her chest.

"What's wrong with it?" Alexander asked.

"Your driving scared it," Evelyn said flatly.

Without proof, she wouldn't jump to conclusions. As for Alexander's promise to "trust her"...

Evelyn rubbed the cat's tiny head.

Pretty words were worthless.

Only fools took them to heart.
###Chapter 565: Taking You Home

Alexander pressed the accelerator hard, making the car lurch forward.

"Slow down," Evelyn frowned.

He eased off the gas, realizing his lapse. In the rearview mirror, Lydia's figure grew smaller.

"What did you see earlier?" Alexander asked abruptly.

Evelyn's fingers stilled for a second.

"Lydia hasn't left yet," she said flatly. "Why?"

His gaze remained fixed ahead. "There's nothing between us. I only used her to make Annabelle back off. She wouldn't dare cross the Banyan Group's heiress."

"Your personal affairs don't concern me."

Silence filled the car.

Alexander changed the subject. "When are you officially taking over Anderson Group?"

"Sooner the better." She stroked the Ragdoll cat in her lap. "The news won't stay hidden long."

He nodded, then suddenly pulled over.

"Problem?" Evelyn eyed him warily.

He dialed Emily. "Release the announcement. Set it for next Monday."

Hanging up, dappled shadows from the trees played across his profile.

"Monday's the management meeting. All board members will be there," he explained. "Best time for your debut."

Evelyn gave a soft hum.

The cat stretched in her arms, emitting a delicate mewl.

"Nervous?" Alexander asked.

"More so when lecturing interns." She scratched under the cat's chin. "At least I don't need lesson plans this time."

A chuckle escaped him. "Always so composed."

The quiet between them grew palpable, their breaths audible.

Evelyn checked the time. "Drop me at the next intersection. I'll walk home."

"I'll take you," Alexander stated firmly.

In the elevator, she reached out. "Give me the bags."

"I've got them," he insisted.

Standing at their respective doors, he suggested, "Rest at my place first? Auntie Wu keeps it spotless."

"No need." She retrieved her keys. "My apartment's fine as is."

He sighed. "Your aunt's still there. I just want you to rest properly."

"I didn't rest well when I had that fever either," she said pointedly.

The click of the turning key echoed sharply down the hallway.
###Chapter 566: Opposites Attract

Evelyn's fingertips had just touched the doorknob when she heard rustling sounds behind her.

The Ragdoll cat was pawing at Alexander's pant leg, its fluffy tail arched high like a blooming dandelion.

"It seems to prefer you." Evelyn set the shopping bags down by the entryway and bent to untie her shoelaces.

Alexander crouched, his slender fingers gently scratching under the kitten's chin. "Perhaps opposites attract."

"It's not even three months old." Evelyn countered without looking up. The keys turned twice in the lock with a crisp click.

Pushing the door open, a musty scent of long-stagnant air greeted them. The furniture shapes beneath dust covers blurred like ghosts veiled in white. The Ragdoll leaped from her arms and began curiously exploring its new territory.

Evelyn drew back the curtains as the last rays of sunset slanted inside. The kitten had already found its favorite toy—a plush ball—and was rolling around with it in the dog bed.

The shower had barely stopped running when the doorbell chimed.

Evelyn answered while drying her hair, water droplets from the ends splattering dark circles on the floor.

"Iodine." Alexander stood at the threshold, his damp hair tousled across his forehead, the edges of his bandage suspiciously damp.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Shower spray?"

"Mhm." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Might've... turned the water on too."

The motion-sensor hallway light abruptly shut off, plunging his sharply defined profile into darkness. With a sigh, Evelyn stepped aside to let him pass.

The Ragdoll immediately darted over, affectionately rubbing against Alexander's calf. He bent to scoop it up, fingertips brushing its snow-white belly.

"The first-aid kit's under the coffee table." Evelyn shook her half-dried hair, droplets landing on Alexander's knuckles, making his fingers twitch from the chill.

When the tweezers pressed the cotton swab against his wound, Alexander hissed through his teeth.

"Now it hurts?" Evelyn maintained firm pressure. "If this gets infected, we'll have to reopen and debride—"

"Dr. Carter." Alexander interrupted suddenly. "Are you always this harsh with patients?"

The cotton swab dug into the wound's edge, making his jawline tense with pain. Evelyn kept her lashes lowered, the light casting delicate shadows beneath her eyes. "The OB-GYN ward only has pregnant women."

The implication was clear—he wasn't part of any special demographic requiring gentleness.

The fresh bandage carried the sterile scent of antiseptic. Alexander suddenly reached out, his fingertips grazing a damp strand of hair by her ear. "You're still dripping."

Evelyn jerked back, only for her ankle to catch on something. She stumbled forward, and Alexander's arms opened to catch her against his chest.

A tangle of yarn was wrapped around the coffee table leg—the culprit perched on the cat tree, tilting its head at the entangled pair.

"Meow~"

Alexander's palm remained at the small of her back, his body heat seeping through the thin pajama fabric. Flustered, Evelyn braced herself up but accidentally pressed against his chest.

"Cough..." Alexander grunted.

She recoiled as if electrocuted. "Did I hurt you?"

"It's fine." He slowly sat upright, his knuckles unconsciously rubbing where she'd pressed. "Better than iodine on an open wound."

The Ragdoll leaped down gracefully, its tail brushing Alexander's knee. He gazed at the little creature, the barest hint of a smile touching his lips.

Evelyn bent to gather the scattered medical supplies, her falling hair veiling the faint flush at the tips of her ears.
###Chapter 567 Pun Play Penalty

Alexander's gaze drifted momentarily as his voice softened. "I'm fine. What about you? Didn't get hurt, did you?"

Evelyn had already scooped the kitten into her arms, casually tossing the tangled yarn ball into the trash.

"...Don't buy pets these dangerous toys in the future."

Alexander immediately agreed. "He wasn't thinking clearly."

Evelyn shot him a glance.

The identity of this "he" needed no explanation.

But Alexander suddenly frowned, deep in thought. "Though it might've been intentional. Most dog toys are rubber balls—who buys yarn?"

Evelyn remained silent.

"Really okay?" he probed.

That sudden fall had sent her face crashing into his chest. Even now, a dull ache lingered—she must be hurting more.

In two strides, he was before her, grasping her wrist. "Let me see."

Evelyn turned her face away. "I'm fine."

Alexander gently cupped her chin, turning her back toward him. After careful inspection, his brow smoothed. "No swelling."

"..."

"I'm not swollen either."

Evelyn lifted her eyes. "I'm a woman—of course there's no swelling."

At first, Alexander didn't catch on, still examining her cheek as he absently replied, "What does gender have to do with..."

No swelling.

No balls.

The pun struck him. Suppressing a chuckle, his tone warmed. "Pun play penalty."

Evelyn pushed his hand away, meeting his gaze directly. "How did you really get hurt?"

Knowing evasion was futile, Alexander sighed. "...Forgot about the wound while showering. Let water hit it directly."

Evelyn eyed his freshly bandaged injury. "Water makes you bleed?"

"I worried the injury was too minor for you to open the door."

"..."

"I didn't plan anything. Just...got used to having you around." His voice dropped. "From the capital to the resort, we were inseparable—more than during our marriage. Returning to an empty house feels...wrong."

Silence.

"My deception was wrong," he added.

Evelyn exhaled in resignation.

He'd helped her too much—lashing out now would seem ungrateful.

"Alexander."

"Hmm?"

"You've done so much since I took over Anderson Group. I remember."

He nodded. "I'm not holding favors over you. Like I said, I won't force you. Keep treating me as a tool if you want—just...don't push me away."

Exhausted, Evelyn subtly adjusted her nightgown's neckline, though his grip on her wrist remained.

"Let go. I need to grab something."

Alexander tensed. "What? I'll get it."

She glanced toward the coffee table. "My phone."

One arm encircled her waist as the other stretched out, effortlessly retrieving the device. "Here."

Accepting it, Evelyn sighed. "I have documents to review. You—"

"I won't disturb you. Pretend I'm not here."

"Sitting idle isn't boring?"

A faint smile touched his lips. "Fair point. Can I watch TV? Muted."

Flipping through files, she replied absently, "Whatever."

The remote lay by the sofa.

Alexander powered on the television with practiced ease, switching to sports before reducing the volume to near-silence.

Considerate to a fault.

Evelyn opened a spreadsheet, the sea of numbers temporarily eclipsing his presence.

When she next looked up, commercials played.

"When are you leaving? I need rest."

Even the Ragdoll had woken from its nap.

Alexander pondered. "The game's not over. Hard to walk away mid-match."

"...No TV at your place?"

"Hasn't been set up yet."

"What time does it end?"

"Ten." A glance at his watch. "It's 9:30 now. I'll leave after."

With a clear deadline, further insistence would seem callous.

Evelyn stood. "I'm using the restroom."

Her absence fractured the fragile peace.

Only after hearing the door click shut did Alexander lift his eyes to the wall clock.
###Chapter 568: Alexander's Little Scheme

Cold water droplets slid down Evelyn's cheeks. She dried her face with a towel and stepped out of the bathroom. Alexander remained in the same position, eyes glued to the television screen.

She deliberately chose the farthest single sofa.

The Ragdoll cat immediately leaped down from the couch and padded gracefully to her feet.

Alexander reached out to stop it but only caught a tuft of floating fur. "Two days of treats and not even a glance?"

The cat flicked its tail, meowed at him twice, then curled into a comfortable ball in Evelyn's lap.

"I thought independence was a virtue in cats?" she remarked, stroking the soft fur without looking up.

Alexander was left speechless. He changed the subject. "How's the report coming?"

"Adjusted to market value as you suggested," she tapped lightly on the keyboard. "Should be done by ten."

He glanced meaningfully at the wall clock. "Might not take that long."

The second hand swayed oddly, as if time had slowed.

Evelyn focused intently on verifying the data. Only after confirming the last digit was correct did she exhale in relief. "Done."

"Congratulations," he said flatly.

"It should be—" She looked up at the clock and froze.

Only fifteen minutes had passed?

She blinked in disbelief.

"Problem with the time?" Alexander feigned ignorance, following her gaze.

"None." She turned her attention to the TV, devising a new excuse to make him leave.

The game was still on, far from over.

Sports held no interest for her. After enduring a few minutes, she grew restless.

"Didn't know you liked watching games," Alexander suddenly said.

"Just passing time," she replied dismissively, checking the clock for the third time.

The hour hand remained stubbornly still.

Evelyn stood abruptly and walked to the window. Outside was pitch black, not a soul in sight.

She hurried back to grab her phone. The screen lit up—her expression darkened instantly.

"Alexander," she thrust the phone at him. "Care to explain?"

He rubbed his nose. "Must be a delay in the game..."

"You tampered with the clock." She pressed the power button, plunging the screen into darkness.

The glaring numbers read 12:30 AM.

"No work tomorrow—"

"So you think it's fine to waste my time?" Her voice trembled. "Mr. Hamilton, leave. Now."

He rose slowly, a flicker of hope in his eyes.

Her resolute back was his only answer.

"Where are you going this late?" He blocked her path in alarm.

"If you won't leave, I will." She shook off his hand, her fingers icy.

The Ragdoll cat circled their feet anxiously, mewing in distress.

"Fine, I'll go." Alexander relented. "But can we—"

"No." Her tone was final.

The next second, an unstoppable force shoved him out the door.

Just as it was about to shut, a hand wedged into the gap.

"You!" Evelyn loosened her grip in panic.

"I have a problem," he admitted wryly.

"Another trick?"

"This time it's real." Alexander sighed. "I can't leave."

She stared at his fingers braced against the doorframe. "Last warning."

"My keys and phone are still inside." He tugged at his loungewear. "No pockets."

Evelyn froze.

"What now?" he asked sincerely.

The night wind slipped through the doorway, scattering the warmth within.
###Chapter 569: At Least Let Me Stay for One Night

The hallway lights cast a sterile glow, making the walls appear even colder.

Alexander Hamilton stood before his own door, fingertips brushing the icy lock before withdrawing. He glanced toward Evelyn Carter’s slightly ajar door, a flicker of hope in his eyes.

Evelyn stood inside with her arms crossed, all traces of sleepiness gone. Her tone was clinical. "Call the property manager or a locksmith. Someone should still be on duty at this hour."

She wouldn’t give him another opening.

Alexander lowered the hand braced against the doorframe. Noting she hadn’t immediately shut him out, he ventured carefully, "My phone’s locked inside."

"Use mine." She thrust her phone toward him without hesitation.

"I don’t know the locksmith’s number." His laugh was humorless. "And at this time—"

"Spare key?" she cut in.

"Don’t have one."

"Someone like you wouldn’t keep a spare?"

"Really don’t."

A gust of wind swept through the hallway, plastering his loungewear to his frame. His complexion was turning pale.

Evelyn’s lips curled. "Last time in the capital, I softened and let you in. How did that end?"

Alexander rubbed his temples. "I’m injured, freezing, and my head’s pounding. At least let me talk inside?"

Her gaze swept over his thin clothing before she turned and disappeared into the apartment.

Alexander remained rooted in place.

Moments later, Evelyn returned with her wallet and a fleece blanket.

"Choose. Hotel or hallway bench."

"No ID."

"Then bench plus blanket." She moved to shut the door.

Alexander shuddered violently. "You’d really make me sleep out here?"

"Absolutely."

His damp hair trembled in the cold draft. "Just...one night?"

Evelyn studied him. "How do I know this isn’t another act?"

"I swear." His voice shook. "One night. I’ll take the couch."

A Ragdoll cat peeked around Evelyn’s ankles, observing them with feline curiosity.

Finally, she stepped aside. "In. Cross the line and you’re out."

Alexander hurried inside, exhaling in relief.

The cat’s tail brushed his ankle.

Evelyn pointed to the sofa. "Your territory. Fix your lock tomorrow."

She turned on her heel. The bedroom door slammed shut behind her.

Alexander arranged the throw pillows. As he opened his mouth to ask for a blanket, the deadbolt clicked audibly.

He lay down with a wry smile. The couch was too short, the blanket too thin, and cold air seeped through the balcony cracks.

In her cat bed, the Ragdoll stretched and purred contentedly.

At 3 AM, Alexander finally sat up, defeated. Dragging stiff legs to the bedroom door, he knocked gently. "Evelyn...a blanket?"

The knob didn’t budge.
###Chapter 570: Good Morning, Big Bro and Sis

Evelyn Carter had just burrowed under the covers, drowsiness pulling at her eyelids, when Alexander Hamilton's voice yanked her back to consciousness.

She yanked the quilt over her head with a frustrated groan.

"Dr. Carter, it's minus five degrees tonight," Alexander's muffled voice carried through the door, tinged with pitiful exaggeration. "I'm freezing to death."

Evelyn kept her eyes shut, playing dead.

"I caught a cold," he added.

She threw off the blankets and stormed barefoot to the door. "Alexander Hamilton, do you think I'm some pushover?"

Silence.

Then, rapid-fire contrition: "My bad. But seriously, it's freezing."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, turned to yank a spare blanket from the closet, and flung it through a barely cracked door.

Slam.

Back in bed, sleep had fled.

Dawn arrived with insistent pounding.

From next door.

Evelyn buried her face in the pillow.

The knocking escalated, now accompanied by shouting.

She threw on a robe and marched out.

In the living room, Alexander sat up from the couch, hair disheveled.

Their eyes locked.

"Comfy?" Evelyn's gaze flicked to the blanket draped over him.

He rubbed his temples. "Your couch is a torture device."

The banging continued.

"Auntie Wu?"

"Gave her the weekend off."

Alexander was already moving. "I'll handle it."

The door swung open to reveal Vincent Wilson mid-knock, eyes bulging at Alexander's disheveled state. Beside him, Nathan York's jaw dropped.

"You two—" Alexander's expression darkened.

Vincent's gaze darted between them before lighting up with realization. "Ohhh, so you and—"

Nathan clapped a hand over his mouth. "Morning, Alex! Morning, Mrs. Hamilton!"

A vein throbbed at Alexander's temple. "Why the hell are you here at dawn?"

Vincent wriggled free. "Left my phone here!"

"That's it?" Alexander's voice dropped dangerously.

"It's got all my contacts—"

Nathan snorted. "Translation: his little black book of 'sisters.'"

"You wouldn't understand!" Vincent bristled. "The Wilson bloodline rests on my shoulders!"

Alexander's smile was glacial. "Get your damn phone. Then vanish."

Evelyn watched the circus unfold, her headache intensifying by the second.
###Chapter 571: Prior Engagement

Vincent Wilson stood in the hallway, studying Alexander Hamilton for a long moment.

"Alex," he pointed at the locked door, "don't tell me you..." His voice trailed off meaningfully.

Alexander remained unruffled. "I was in a hurry last night. Left my keys inside."

He offered no explanation for his late-night departure, but his loungewear and the direction he'd come from spoke volumes.

Evelyn Carter's figure flashed past them in the corridor.

Vincent exchanged a knowing glance with Nathan York before deliberately drawing out his words: "We get it! Happens to the best of us!"

Alexander's gaze followed Evelyn's retreating form, clearly uninterested in further conversation. "You two go ahead. I'll be staying at Evelyn's place for now."

"The couch?" Vincent raised an eyebrow.

Nathan wisely kept silent.

Suddenly, Vincent had an epiphany. "Alex, why not just call a locksmith?"

Alexander's eyes turned icy. "What did you just say?"

Nathan swiftly clamped a hand over Vincent's mouth. "He's been acting strange lately. I'll take him to get checked out."

Once the elevator doors closed, Vincent broke free. "What was that for?"

"Are you stupid?" Nathan hissed. "The door wasn't even locked when Alex left!"

Vincent's eyes widened in belated realization. "You mean..."

"I saw," Nathan made a throat-slitting gesture, "Mrs. Hamilton in her pajamas. If Alex finds out we noticed..."

Both men shuddered simultaneously.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had changed into outdoor attire and was refilling the Ragdoll cat's water bowl.

"I cleaned the litter box," she said without looking up. "She's smart—figured it out immediately."

Alexander crouched down to pour kibble into the food dish. "When White Coat comes back, we'll need double the supplies."

He casually remarked, "When is Dr. Wilson returning the dog?"

Evelyn adjusted her crossbody bag. "We'll see. I'll take responsibility since I agreed to keep him."

"Like raising a child," Alexander chuckled.

Both froze at the unintended parallel.

Evelyn quickly changed the subject. "What did Vincent want?"

"Forgot his phone at my place," Alexander replied smoothly. "Actually, could you do me a favor? I need some clean clothes—"

"Don't bother," Evelyn cut him off. "I've already asked Emily to arrange for a locksmith."

Alexander's expression darkened.

"I have plans today." Evelyn grabbed her bag and headed for the door.

"With whom?" Alexander demanded.

The only response was the decisive click of the door closing behind her.
###Chapter 572: Addicted to the Couch?

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains. Evelyn Carter rubbed her temples and quietly got up to wash.

She chose a crisp professional suit and adjusted the collar in the mirror.

Her phone lit up with a message from Alexander Hamilton: Breakfast is in the warmer. Don’t forget to eat.

Evelyn didn’t reply. She grabbed her briefcase and left.

A line had already formed outside the city library. She swiped her card and headed straight for the business section.

Just as she opened Corporate Strategy Management, her phone buzzed.

"Hello?"

"Where are you?" Alexander’s voice carried urgency.

"Library," she whispered.

"Why aren’t you answering my calls?"

"Silent mode."

A pause. "Lunch together?"

"No need. I brought a sandwich."

"Evelyn—"

"Anything else? I’m studying."

She hung up and took a deep breath, forcing herself to focus.

At noon, the café smelled richly of coffee.

Evelyn had just taken a bite when the glass door swung open.

Alexander strode in with a thermal bag, beads of sweat on his forehead.

"Aunt Wu made soup. Drink it while it’s hot."

He unpacked the dishes one by one. The aroma filled the air instantly.

"You’re sick?" She noticed his reddened nose.

He coughed lightly. "Aircon was too low last night."

She didn’t press further, sipping the soup in silence.

"I’m going furniture shopping this afternoon," he said abruptly.

"Oh?"

"Mom’s moving back to the old house. Need new furnishings."

Her chopsticks stilled. "Margaret’s returning?"

"Mm. The renovations are done." He placed fish on her plate. "Also, don’t answer unknown calls."

"Why?"

"Overseas scams are rampant." His tone was casual. "Especially from Southeast Asia."

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully.

Monday morning. Cars crowded the entrance of Carter Group’s headquarters.

Evelyn stepped into the elevator, her sharp jawline reflected in the mirrored walls.

Conversations ceased when she pushed open the conference room door.

Two dozen pairs of eyes locked onto her.

She walked straight to the head of the table, her black blazer radiating authority.

"Director Carter." A middle-aged man on her right spoke first. "Gregory Macmillan, Business Division."

She inclined her head slightly. "Manager Macmillan."

"Heard you studied medicine?" He adjusted his glasses. "Should we brief you on our projects first?"

Light chuckles rippled through the room.

Evelyn calmly opened a file. "The South District project under Manager Macmillan’s leadership saw a 15% profit drop last quarter."

Macmillan paled.

"Care to explain?" She lifted her gaze, eyes piercing.
###Chapter 573: First Signs of Brilliance

Gregory Macmillan had been with Anderson Environmental for years, commanding enough respect that even Anthony Taylor had treated him with deference.

Now Evelyn Carter had parachuted in as his direct superior, and his displeasure was written all over his face.

In the conference room, Evelyn listened quietly to the heated arguments, her right hand jotting down key points in her notebook with a fountain pen.

Gregory made no attempt to hide his frustration, rapping his knuckles sharply against the table. "Last month's financial report is a disaster! Unpaid invoices, plummeting sales—what has the sales department been doing? And legal is utterly useless!"

The marketing director slammed his hands on the table. "How is this our fault? These policies were set by Mr. Taylor and left unchanged when Mr. Hamilton took over!"

The tension in the room thickened.

Evelyn quickly organized her thoughts and spoke at the right moment. "We can't change the past. Let's focus on damage control this month."

"Easier said than done," Gregory sneered. "Those overdue payments are tough nuts to crack."

"I'll review the contract details first, then discuss strategies with legal."

Gregory stood abruptly. "Wait? Does our cash flow have that luxury? Or are you planning to cover the shortfall out of your own pocket?"

Evelyn's gaze remained steady. "This client is important. We need to recover the debt without burning bridges."

Nathan Stapleton adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Nice words, Ms. Carter. But do you have an actual plan?"

Evelyn recognized the finance director and replied calmly, "I'm still getting familiar with operations. What do you suggest, Mr. Stapleton?"

Nathan smirked meaningfully. "You've done your homework—you even know who I am."

"I've reviewed everyone's profiles but am still matching names to faces." Evelyn turned to the other end of the room. "Is Henry Croix from legal here?"

A middle-aged man in the corner raised his hand. "That's me."

"You're the legal expert. I'd like your input."

Henry slowly twisted his wristwatch. "Frankly, we should just consult Mr. Hamilton."

The suggestion opened the floodgates. The room erupted.

"Exactly, Mr. Hamilton knows best!"
"Was Mr. Taylor joking, handing the company to his daughter like a toy?"
"Rumor has it Mr. Hamilton's already partnered with Leonard Laurent—he's abandoned us..."

Evelyn noted Henry's luxury watch. "That's an exquisite timepiece."

Henry preened. "Last year's seven-figure bonus bought me this little reward."

"So you admire Mr. Hamilton's leadership?"

"A man like him doesn't need admiration from the likes of me." Henry didn't bother hiding his intentions. "I'm considering moving to Hamilton Group."

Murmurs of agreement came from the corner. "Same here."

Evelyn smiled inwardly. Alexander Hamilton was indeed formidable—letting Andy Taylor wreak havoc while still commanding such loyalty.

Gregory seized the moment to attack. "Orders are drying up, Ms. Carter. We're surviving on old clients. Any brilliant ideas?"

The marketing manager chimed in, "We understand newcomers need time, but you can't rush things either."

The challenges kept coming.

"You're not from the construction industry, are you? No wonder you're unfamiliar. Our current policies were all drafted by Mr. Hamilton himself."

Evelyn remained unruffled. "Mr. Hamilton's contributions are undeniable, but we must learn to solve problems independently now."

Gregory abruptly changed tack. "There's a major project up for bid. Winning it would secure our workload for the year. Any thoughts?"

"I'll need details first." Though uncertain, Evelyn betrayed nothing. "Please send all relevant materials to my office. I'll review them promptly."
###Chapter 574: Name Your Terms

The air in the conference room froze for several seconds.

The previously aggressive executives finally fell silent.

"Ms. Carter is right. Securing the project is our top priority now," a middle-aged man broke the silence first.

Evelyn recognized him as one of the four trusted aides Alexander had personally introduced to her before.

Another immediately chimed in, "I'll compile the bidding documents and send them to you for review right away."

"Good." Evelyn gave a slight nod. "That concludes today's meeting. I've noted all your suggestions and will adjust the work pace promptly."

"Wait." Gregory Macmillan suddenly spoke up. "Ms. Carter, vague promises like 'promptly' won't cut it. We need a concrete deadline."

Evelyn pondered briefly. "The day after tomorrow."

"The day after tomorrow?" Gregory scoffed. "Do you know how many competitors are eyeing this? If the plan remains theoretical by then, we won't even have time for damage control."

"What deadline would you suggest, Mr. Macmillan?"

"Tomorrow morning." Gregory scanned the room. "Same conference room. If Ms. Carter fails to deliver a satisfactory response, not just Mr. Chen, but everyone here may need to consider alternative employment."

......

The study was still lit late at night.

Evelyn rubbed her tired eyes as the financial reports before her blurred into indistinct figures.

The doorbell suddenly rang.

She opened the door to find Alexander standing outside, holding a thermal container.

"Something urgent?" Her voice was hoarse.

His gaze traveled past her, landing on the mountain of documents piled on the desk. "Still working this late?"

Only then did Evelyn realize it was already 11 PM.

"The proposal is due tomorrow." She massaged her temples wearily. "Get to the point."

"Brought you some late-night snacks." He lifted the thermal container slightly.

"Thanks, but no." She moved to close the door.

Alexander blocked it with one hand. "Trouble?"

"Work matters." Her reply was curt. "I'm pressed for time."

He asked abruptly, "How was your day at Hamilton Group? Heard the meeting didn't go well."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Your intelligence network is impressively efficient."

Without invitation, he strode past her toward the desk, his eyes scanning the financial reports on the computer screen.

Evelyn followed and noticed his frown deepening.

"Who prepared these reports?" His voice turned grim.

"The digital version from Marketing." She sighed. "Couldn't get the hard copies."

Alexander smirked coldly. "Because they never prepared them."

He pointed at the screen. "All qualification certificates are missing. Submit this bid and we'll be eliminated in the first round."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "I only verified the data..."

"Not your fault." He tapped the desk. "What's Auditing even doing?"

"The whole company is waiting to see me fail." A bitter smile touched her lips. "I have to handle everything personally."

Alexander suddenly turned and met her gaze directly. "You have a better option."

"What option?"

He pointed at himself. "Me."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "You're not even with the company anymore. How do you know so much?"

"Someone had to keep watch." His tone was casual. "That dinner wasn't for nothing."

"You knew what happened in the conference room?" She laughed mirthlessly. "Seems you planted quite the surveillance system during your tenure."

"Right now, you don't need to question me," Alexander stepped closer, "but to build your own intelligence network."

"How?"

The corner of his mouth lifted. "Want to learn?"

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Name your terms. Even the sofa is negotiable."
###Chapter 575 He Drank Her Leftover Soup

"Eat something first." Alexander Hamilton slid a thermal container toward her.

Evelyn Carter lifted the lid. The aroma of chicken soup filled the air. Shredded chicken noodles glistened under the light, garnished with finely chopped scallions.

"Get to the point first." She closed the lid.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "You can eat while listening."

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn took out the bowl and chopsticks. The first sip of warm broth instantly eased her tense nerves.

The desk was cluttered with documents. Alexander casually organized them. "The bidding is our top priority."

"Hamilton Group is barely surviving on old clients." Evelyn stirred the noodles. "Though Manager Macmillan deliberately made things difficult today, he wasn't wrong. Our chances are slim."

"I faced the same situation when I first took over."

Evelyn paused her chopsticks. "You did it on purpose?"

"The management team had their own agendas. Keeping them in check was the best strategy." His tone remained calm.

Evelyn looked up sharply. "Those power struggles in the boardroom—"

"I orchestrated them." He admitted frankly. "Maintaining the status quo is easy. Let them compete. You just need to pick the best and consolidate."

"I don't want to maintain." Her gaze was resolute.

A flicker of approval crossed Alexander's eyes as he analyzed the company's complex interpersonal dynamics, eventually circling back to the proposal.

"Senior employees enjoy generous benefits but slack off. The real work comes from newly promoted talents."

"No wonder they dared to target me." Understanding dawned on Evelyn.

"Seems my research wasn't wasted." Alexander nodded approvingly.

Evelyn set down her bowl and grabbed the mouse again.

"Got an idea?"

"First verify the data, then adjust the project teams." Her eyes burned into the screen. "We can refine details later."

The sound of keyboard clicks filled the study, occasionally punctuated by rustling papers.

Fully focused, Evelyn quickly revised the flawed proposal and even organized the bidding materials.

"Have two teams prepare separate bids. We'll choose the better one." Her eyes never left the monitor.

Alexander watched her concentrated profile. "You learn fast."

"A leader doesn't need to excel at everything, but must know how to delegate." A faint smile touched her lips. "Today I learned another trick—using competition to drive efficiency."

Warmth shimmered in Alexander's eyes. "Exactly."

Evelyn turned to ask for bidding advice but froze—

Alexander was holding her bowl, leisurely drinking her leftover soup.

"You..." Her eyes widened.

"Hmm?" He set the bowl down calmly.

"Why didn't you bring two portions?"

"Watching you enjoy it made me want a taste." He scooped the last spoonful. "Want more?"

Evelyn shook her head.

Alexander tilted his head back, finishing the broth, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Alexander."

"Yes?"

"...Never mind."

He ruffled her hair. "I don't mind sharing my woman's soup."

"That's unhygienic." Evelyn frowned. "What if you get H. pylori—"

"Three years of marriage. If I was going to catch it, I would have by now." His low chuckle held amusement. "That time in the capital—"

"Shut up!" Her ears burned crimson as she shoved him away.
###Chapter 576: Someone's Got Your Back

Alexander Hamilton noticed Evelyn Carter's exhaustion and smoothly changed the subject. "Construction projects always prioritize companies they've worked with before. Anderson Group still has a chance."

Evelyn gave a slight nod, her gaze returning to the laptop screen.

He stood quietly behind her, only speaking up when he spotted flaws in the proposal. Time slipped by unnoticed until stars dotted the night sky outside.

"I'm heading next door," Alexander said before leaving. "Get some rest."

Evelyn responded without looking up. "Mhm."

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains. After a quick wash, Evelyn arrived at the conference room thirty minutes early.

Today's meeting had fewer attendees than Monday's. The shareholder who'd defended her was absent. Evelyn used the remaining time to double-check every detail of her proposal.

People trickled in. Most ignored her completely as they took their seats.

Evelyn kept typing, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

"Director Carter's quite the early bird," Manager Macmillan remarked as he sauntered in right on time, his tone dripping with sarcasm.

Evelyn didn't glance up. "You're not late either, Manager Macmillan."

As the meeting was about to start, the planning director hesitantly offered, "Director Carter, we've prepared a backup plan—"

"Unnecessary." Evelyn handed over a flash drive. "Use mine."

Macmillan scoffed. "Little girls shouldn't overreach. Managing a household suits you better."

"With your expertise, Manager Macmillan, I assume you're quite experienced with childcare?" Evelyn rose gracefully. "Let's begin."

She stood before the projector, presenting her proposal with razor-sharp logic. When she pointed out missing certifications, the room tensed instantly.

"That's standard procedure!" A veteran employee slammed the table. "We'd have included them in the bidding documents!"

Evelyn's calm gaze swept across them. "If you can't even prepare basic materials, how can I trust you with major projects?"

Whispers erupted through the room.

"This style feels like Hamilton's work."
"Did he send her as his proxy?"

Evelyn ignored them, announcing personnel changes. The head of marketing immediately protested. "Why transfer staff from other regions?"

"The local market is stable. Reallocating resources makes sense." Evelyn's tone carried hidden meaning. "Unless someone fears being outperformed by newcomers?"

Macmillan cut in darkly, "And if this fails—"

"Company interests come first." Evelyn scanned the room. "Unless anyone here has... alternative priorities?"

"What are you implying?" The veteran employee erupted. "A greenhorn like you dares give orders? This plan is obviously—"

The conference door swung open.

Alexander Hamilton strolled in as casually as entering a garden, taking a seat under everyone's stunned gazes.

"Continue." He looked up at Evelyn, a faint smile in his eyes.

The room fell dead silent.
###Chapter 577: From Spouses to Siblings

Evelyn's fingertips tightened slightly, her knuckles turning white.

A dozen pairs of eyes in the conference room were fixed on her, forcing her to maintain a composed facade.

"Mr. Hamilton, are you here to supervise the meeting because you don't trust me?" Her voice was cool, almost rigid.

Manager Gregory rushed forward as if seeing a savior. "Mr. Hamilton, you're finally here! The company has been leaderless, waiting for you to take charge!"

Henry immediately straightened his slouched posture, his face plastered with flattery. "Yes, Mr. Hamilton. Without you these past few days, we've been completely rudderless."

Alexander's gaze never left Evelyn.

Today, she was entirely different from usual. The sharply tailored blazer accentuated her slender waist, her knee-length skirt revealing a glimpse of pale calves. The black stilettos added an edge to her presence. Her hair, pinned up in a neat bun, made her look both efficient and striking.

Only the slightly open collar of her blouse, exposing a sliver of fair skin, darkened Alexander's eyes.

Evelyn noticed his stare and instinctively touched her neck.

Nothing was out of place.

She raised a brow, silently questioning: What are you looking at?

Alexander averted his gaze, his tone indifferent. "Anderson Group now has a new leader. It's not my place to interfere. I'm here purely for personal reasons."

Manager Gregory quickly interjected, "Did Mr. Anderson Sr. send you? Ah, after all, it's the company he built from the ground up..."

"Uncle Anderson has complete faith in Evelyn."

Manager Gregory faltered, forcing an awkward smile. "It's only natural for a father to dote on his daughter. But women are better suited for domestic roles. The business world is a battlefield—how could they possibly handle it?"

Evelyn's expression instantly turned icy.

Alexander's eyes darkened. "Manager Gregory, that’s an extremely unprofessional remark."

"I'm just stating facts! Look at any industry—how many top professionals are women? Women are emotional, obsessed with celebrities and dramas. What great things can they achieve?"

Alexander's jaw tensed, the air around him turning frigid.

Henry hurriedly tried to mediate. "Manager Gregory, Miss Anderson is still Mr. Anderson Sr.'s daughter..."

"I never said I don’t respect her!" Manager Gregory retorted stubbornly. "As long as she stays out of company affairs, I’ll treat her like my own niece!"

Henry nodded repeatedly. "Exactly, Miss Anderson is new here. We should be understanding..."

Manager Gregory scoffed. "Now that Mr. Hamilton is here, this matter can be settled properly. The Hamiltons and Andersons are close. Miss Anderson is practically like Mr. Hamilton's sister..."

"Who said she’s my sister?" Alexander's voice suddenly sharpened.

Manager Gregory froze, thinking he’d misunderstood. "Right, right! What nonsense about siblings—there’s no relation at all!"

Evelyn said coolly, "Manager Gregory is correct. Mr. Hamilton and I have no connection."

Alexander’s face darkened further.

Encouraged, Manager Gregory grew bolder. "Mr. Hamilton, I just can’t accept this! Some little girl—"

Thud!

A thermal lunchbox landed heavily on the conference table.

Manager Gregory jumped. "What’s this...?"

"Her lunch." Alexander looked at Evelyn. "Pause the meeting. Eat first."

Evelyn frowned. "We haven’t finished discussing."

"The meeting can wait. Lunch can’t." Without waiting for a response, he took her hand. "Everyone, we’ll resume in half an hour."

Evelyn tried to pull away. "Alexander!"

He stepped closer, abruptly closing the distance between them. When she raised a hand to push him away, he caught it, interlacing their fingers.

"Are you insane?" Evelyn hissed under her breath.

Alexander leaned in, his lips brushing her ear. "See? These old fossils will never respect you. Instead of wasting time, show your hand directly."

"Anthony Anderson should be the one to—"

"Who do you think they’ll listen to more?"

Evelyn fell silent.

Anthony had been absent from company affairs for years. The real authority had long been Alexander’s.

"...I know you don’t want to rely on my influence," his breath warmed her ear, "but this is the fastest way."
###Chapter 578: Siblings My Foot

Evelyn turned her face away. "Exactly. It makes me feel like a decoration."

"Evelyn, this world only cares about results. As long as the outcome is good, even the most difficult process will be hailed as a brilliant decision. If you believe in your choice, time will prove you right. Once the quarterly report comes out, these doubts will vanish."

She bit her lower lip and stayed silent.

Alexander's heart softened at the sight of her stubborn profile. "Let's eat first."

Evelyn seized the chance to create distance. "...We're at the office. Behave."

"So I don't have to behave at home?"

"..."

Their whispered exchange didn't escape the notice of everyone in the conference room.

Front-row attendees Gregory Macmillan and Henry Croix saw it all.

Gregory looked baffled. "Mr. Croix, didn't Mr. Hamilton just say they weren't siblings? What's going on here?"

Henry adjusted his glasses with a knowing smile. "Who knows."

Gregory's temper flared again. "Ms. Carter, dozens of us have been waiting for you—that's hundreds of man-hours wasted! Our time isn't valuable? Everyone's starving through this meeting!"

Evelyn agreed it was inappropriate. "Let's resume the meeting."

"Eat while we work." Alexander's tone brooked no argument. "Since I'm here, I'll observe."

He unpacked the meal containers one by one.

Handing her chopsticks, he said, "Eat. You can still listen."

Evelyn was trapped.

Eating in the conference room?

Company policy strictly forbade it!

"Why aren't you eating?" Noticing her hesitation, Alexander picked up some water spinach with his chopsticks and held it to her lips. "Need me to feed you?"

Evelyn glared.

"Open up."

"..."

"Now."

When the vegetable touched her lips, she had no choice but to quickly take it and chew with her head down.

Before she could swallow, a shrimp appeared at her mouth. "The nutritionist said you need more protein."

She gulped hastily. "Enough. The meeting."

"That little bit isn't enough."

Her hand shot under the table and pinched him hard.

"Ow—" Alexander exaggeratedly sucked in a breath. "You pinched me?"

Evelyn fumed. She hadn't even used much force.

"Really full?"

"Yes." She straightened. "Continue the meeting."

Alexander finally relented. "Fine. Proceed."

Evelyn exhaled in relief and focused on presenting the proposal's core points.

"I've marked the issues with the pricing sheet. Review them carefully."

She signaled her assistant to distribute the materials.

The assistant, intimidated by Alexander, obeyed immediately.

The room's atmosphere shifted as people scanned the documents.

Evelyn had been diplomatic—she could've exposed the flaws publicly.

"Besides a market assistant, this project requires professionals. Before final selection, I'll conduct evaluations."

"Additionally, Hamilton Group is in a transitional phase. The deputy position has been vacant since Mr. Hamilton stepped down, with Mr. Macmillan temporarily overseeing operations."

Gregory went on high alert.

Evelyn said calmly, "You've worked hard during this period."

Gregory forced a smile. "Just doing my job."

"Our priority is securing this contract. The marketing head will share your workload temporarily. We'll finalize the deputy appointment after everything's settled."

With three sentences, she dismantled their alliance.

Others, seeing Gregory's defeat, didn't dare misbehave.

Alexander led the applause. "Well considered, Ms. Carter. Mr. Macmillan does need a break."

Gregory looked like a ghost.

The rest had no choice but to join the clapping.

Only Henry applauded while studying the pair, his smile deepening.

So that's how it was.

The way Mr. Hamilton looked at Ms. Carter could melt steel. Siblings? Yeah, right.

The reporting session began.

Though distracted, nobody dared slack off with Alexander present.

Evelyn took diligent notes, asking questions when unclear.

When Henry's turn came, Gregory secretly tugged his sleeve. "Make me proud!"

Henry smirked.

With Alexander's laser gaze on them? He'd need ten extra lives to try anything.
###Chapter 579: Isn't This Brother Spoiling Her Too Much?

"I fully support President Carter's decision."

Manager Gregory's face darkened instantly. "Henry, what kind of attitude is this? Changing sides so quickly?"

"Manager Gregory." Alexander Hamilton's calm voice cut through the tension.

Gregory immediately turned, his face breaking into an obsequious smile. "Mr. Hamilton, do you have any instructions?"

"Nothing major. Just reminding you it's your turn to speak."

"Of course, of course."

"Mind if I eat something?"

"...Pardon?"

"I'll finish Evelyn's leftovers. You may proceed—I won't interrupt."

Gregory: ???

Alexander picked up Evelyn's used chopsticks and elegantly devoured every morsel in the takeout box.

"Why hasn't Manager Gregory started?" Alexander glanced up. "Dozens of people are waiting. Wasted time means lost profits."

Gregory gaped as Alexander unflinchingly ate Evelyn's half-finished meal.

"Mr. Hamilton is... remarkably devoted," Gregory forced a laugh. "But sharing utensils with the opposite sex isn't very hygienic, is it?"

"Say that again?"

"I meant using serving chopsticks would be more sanitary—"

"Whose utensils?"

"Miss Carter's!"

"Who?"

"Miss Carter!!!"

"Who?"

Gregory finally caught on, his face cycling through shades of pale and purple.

Henry smoothly intervened. "Mr. Hamilton, Manager Gregory misspoke. He meant President Carter."

Alexander nodded approvingly. "Ah, President Carter."

Gregory looked baffled. "What's the difference?"

Henry whispered sharply, "Manager Gregory, President Carter now holds ultimate authority here. Address her properly."

Alexander gave Henry an appreciative glance. "Manager Croix truly is the backbone of Anderson Group."

The meeting resumed. Gregory continued his tirade against Evelyn's competence, only faltering when Alexander冷笑ed at his "women have long hair and short insight" remark.

The icy chuckle silenced the entire room.

After adjournment, Gregory cornered Alexander.

"Mr. Hamilton, we can't take it anymore! That little girl knows nothing about business—she'll ruin Anderson Group!"

Alexander remained impassive. "Twenty minutes. Talk."

Gregory launched into complaints. "She targets veteran employees like us from day one, disregarding decades of contributions!"

"Mr. Hamilton, please reason with old Mr. Anderson!" other senior staff echoed.

Alexander's response was curt. "With me here, Anderson Group won't fall."

The group exchanged stunned looks.

Just then, Evelyn exited the conference room, walking past them without a glance.

Alexander swiftly followed, reaching for her laptop bag.

"Unnecessary," she murmured.

"Too heavy. Let me." He took everything without hesitation, trailing behind her like a dutiful assistant.

Gregory's jaw nearly hit the floor.

"This is outright spoiling her!" He fumed to other veterans. "Old Mr. Anderson let her run wild, and now even Mr. Hamilton takes orders from her!"

The seasoned employees shared knowing glances.

—Guess why she dares to order Mr. Hamilton around.
###Chapter 580: Evelyn, I Never Understood You Before

The office curtains were half-drawn, allowing slanted sunlight to spill across the floor. Evelyn Carter surveyed the space—this was Anthony Taylor's former office, preserved exactly as he'd left it, down to the pen holder on the desk.

Alexander Hamilton stood at the threshold, his gaze cataloging every detail. He gave a slight nod, apparently approving of the arrangements.

"Thanks." Evelyn accepted the files he'd carried for her, her tone as neutral as if addressing a colleague.

Alexander released the documents, watching her stride to the desk. Her movements were efficient, the keyboard taps crisp—as though the earlier confrontation in the boardroom had never happened. He settled into the armchair opposite, his eyes never leaving her.

Proposals and tenders littered the desk. Evelyn's fingers danced across the keyboard before she suddenly looked up. "Hamilton Group must be swamped lately."

"No rush." Alexander leaned back, posture relaxed.

"Today made things abundantly clear." Her focus returned to the screen. "They won't give me trouble anymore."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "You resent me for this?"

"No." She shook her head. "Quite the opposite. Without your intervention, they wouldn't have conceded so easily."

Alexander exhaled. "This isn't your style."

"Mm."

"You've always relied on merit." His voice softened. "Having connections pave the way now—it's natural to feel unsettled."

Her typing hesitated.

"Remember what Peter Harrison said about me?" Alexander asked abruptly.

"Which part?"

"That I merely won the birth lottery." A humorless twist of his lips. "In some ways, he wasn't wrong."

Evelyn closed a folder. "Your point?"

"Your goals have always been pure." His gaze held hers. "Healing people, protecting family. Those don't require privilege."

Her lashes lowered. "I lack Peter's ambition."

"More desires mean less joy." Alexander's smile turned wry. "I used to force things, only to lose everything. Evelyn... I never understood you before."

Silence pooled between them. The rustle of papers grew pronounced.

"Since when did you study philosophy?" she deflected.

"'Also'?" He pounced on the word.

"Vivian." A faint curve touched Evelyn's lips. "She bombarded me with motivational quotes for weeks. I nearly expected her to join a monastery."

Shadow crossed his eyes. "Pain makes one reflect."

Evelyn pivoted sharply. "Let's discuss the restructuring. Your thoughts on the personnel changes?"

"Vice president is tempting bait." Alexander followed her lead. "But watch for sabotage during bidding."

"I need trustworthy allies."

"I can recommend several." He leaned forward. "Outside the old guard's faction."

She shook her head. "Management transitions require care. I want gradual shifts—dignified exits for longtime employees."

"Wise." Approval warmed his voice. "Whatever you decide, I'll support it."

Sunlight fractured between them in scattered patterns. Evelyn kept her eyes averted.

Alexander stood. "Dinner preferences?"

"Whatever."

"I'll have Auntie Wu follow the nutritionist's menu." A pause. "Free this weekend?"

She finally met his gaze.

"Mother's returning to the estate." He clarified, "She'd like to host you. Bring Vivian and the others if you prefer."

"Prior engagement." Her reply was clipped.

"With?" Tension wire-tightened his voice.

"Several people."

"Men?"

"Yes."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Vivian's gathering?"

"Not her." Evelyn arched a brow. "What, you're policing me now?"

"Wouldn't dare." He backtracked instantly, then ventured cautiously, "Celestial Club again?"

Her eyebrow climbed higher. "What if it is?"

His throat worked. "Women should... prioritize safety."

"It's perfectly safe there." She looked down. "Safer than some people's intentions."
###Chapter 581: She's Single Now

The plane trees of Hudson High School No.5 stood tall as ever, their dappled shadows dancing across the red brick walls like imprints of time. This century-old institution, founded during the early 20th century, had witnessed generations of students passing through its gates.

Evelyn Carter paused at the school entrance, gazing at the gilded nameplate with quiet reverence. One hundred and thirty years of history lent an air of gravitas to these hallowed grounds.

"Evelyn!"

Vivian Dempsey came bounding over, throwing an arm around her shoulders. "Finally! I've been waiting half an hour. That damn bus kept stopping and starting—I nearly got carsick."

"Why didn't you drive?"

"Gotta save on gas," Vivian winked. "Miss Liang's funding doesn't grow on trees. Oh, Principal Evans specifically requested you give the alumni speech as our star graduate."

Evelyn pressed her lips together in amusement. "He sent me a sixty-second voice memo last night, terrified I'd back out."

Vivian's expression suddenly dimmed. "If only I hadn't—"

"Stop." Evelyn pinched her lightly. "I'm perfectly happy now. Saving lives as a doctor beats fiddling with test tubes in some lab."

"But you were—"

"Viv," Evelyn turned toward the academic building, "look—the old locust tree is still there. Remember when you buried that time capsule beneath it during senior year?"

The diversion worked instantly. "Oh my god, yes! I wrote a letter to my future self about becoming this badass career woman..."

"Evelyn! Vivian!"

A robust male voice called from behind. They turned to see a sprightly middle-aged man approaching, his hairline slightly more receded than in their memories.

"Good afternoon, Principal Evans," Evelyn greeted politely.

The principal feigned offense. "Since when am I 'Principal'? 'Mr. Evans' still suits me fine."

Vivian grinned. "That hair dye looks natural, sir. Mrs. Evans has excellent taste."

"Cheeky as ever!" He raised a mock-threatening hand before addressing Evelyn. "Speech ready? These kids need proper role models—they've been getting restless lately."

Evelyn nodded. "Don't worry."

The centennial ceremony unfolded on the synthetic track field. A spring breeze carried the scent of fresh grass across the stands. When Evelyn stepped onto the podium, an immediate buzz rippled through the student section.

"Damn, this alum is smoking hot!"
"OB-GYN at Central Hospital—total brainiac!"
"Anyone know if she's taken?"

From the front row, Vivian spun around. "Single and available!"

Amid the laughter, Evelyn calmly accepted the microphone. Her crisp white blouse, jeans, and simple ponytail stood out refreshingly among the sea of suited alumni.

"Hello everyone. I'm Evelyn Carter, an OB-GYN at Central Hospital." She paused. "I won't feed you the usual 'study hard' platitudes today. Just one thought—life isn't a one-way street."

The crowd stilled.

"College entrance exams matter, but they're not the finish line. I've seen too many people stake everything on one test—acting like their lives are set after acing it, or shattered from failing." Her gaze swept across youthful faces. "Truth is, life's a marathon. What truly matters is finding your passion."

A lanky boy suddenly stood. "Dr. Carter! I wanna go pro in eSports!"

The audience erupted.

Evelyn nodded seriously. "Great ambition. But ask yourself—do you love the industry itself, or just playing games? If it's the former, start studying tournament rules and training regimens now. Not skipping class for internet cafes."

Thunderous applause followed.

Vivian recorded the moment, captioning her social media post:
[My girl Dr. Carter OWNING that stage!]

Nathan York instantly commented:
[Alex wants to know if he can apply as +1]

Vivian typed a frosty reply:
[Tell him to post his divorce papers first]
###Chapter 582: I Was Married

Principal Samuel Evans nodded approvingly at the enthusiastic response from the audience. After Evelyn Carter's speech concluded, he spontaneously decided to add an interactive Q&A session.

The students erupted in excitement.

Evelyn scanned the crowd and selected a girl wearing round-framed glasses.

"Senior Evelyn..." The girl nervously adjusted her glasses. "How did you overcome your fear of public speaking?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Truthfully, my palms are still sweating right now."

"What?" Murmurs of surprise rippled through the crowd.

The girl pressed further: "Could you share some advice about studying medicine?"

"You'll hear all about it after your college entrance exams."

The atmosphere gradually warmed.

A different girl suddenly raised her hand. "Your blazer is gorgeous!"

Evelyn gracefully removed the jacket to showcase it. "Pro tip—buy off-season for major discounts."

Girls immediately noted the style number, chattering animatedly.

Then commotion erupted from the back rows.

"Senior Evelyn!" A tall male student stood with flushed cheeks. "Do you have a boyfriend?"

The entire assembly exploded with noise.

A teacher stomped in frustration. "Outrageous!"

"Don't be mad, teach..."

"Maybe she'll like me!"

The teacher mockingly raised a hand, and the boy playfully dodged, drawing laughter.

Evelyn observed the scene, her lips curling slightly.

"I was married."

Gasps filled the auditorium.

"Of course someone that stunning is taken..."

"Too late for us..."

After the murmurs subsided, Evelyn added: "Though we're divorced now."

The uproar intensified. Teachers exchanged glances before giving up on crowd control.

"Any other questions?" Evelyn smoothly redirected.

Another hand shot up. "Did you date in high school?"

"No."

"Was it lack of interest or strict teachers?"

"Both."

"Was your ex-husband your first love?"

Across the field, Alexander Hamilton paused mid-conversation with school administrators.

His gaze cut through the crowd, landing on Evelyn at the podium.

The dean followed his sightline and eagerly explained: "That's Evelyn Carter, our pride and joy—"

"I see." Alexander responded neutrally.

"She received the city's highest scholarship—"

"Exceptional students deserve exceptional opportunities."

Noticing his interest, officials ushered him toward the stage.

Alexander was seated in the front row—directly behind Vivian Dempsey.

Vivian snorted. "Why are you here?"

"Miss Dempsey?" The dean blinked. "You know Mr. Hamilton?"

"We've never met." Vivian turned away.

Alexander clarified: "I'm evaluating scholarship funding."

"Charity work?" She arched an eyebrow. "Donate more."

He chuckled, refocusing on the stage.

Sunlight illuminated Evelyn's upright posture as she spoke with liquid gentleness.

"First love is...complicated." She hesitated. "Our story would take too long to tell."

"You married him but weren't mutually in love?"

"Time's up." Evelyn deftly pivoted. "Wishing you all brilliant futures."

As she handed the microphone back, a basketball-jersey-clad boy burst from the back.

"Wait, Senior Evelyn!"
###Chapter 583: Serendipity, I'm Single Too

Evelyn's grip on the microphone tightened slightly.

The host smiled diplomatically. "Does this student have any other questions?"

The sun-kissed basketball player from the court remained unfazed. "Senior Evelyn, what's your ideal type?"

"Wow—"

"Ethan's got guts!"

"Varsity team captains are different..."

Evelyn pressed her lips together and adjusted the microphone. "I haven't really thought about it."

Ethan braced one hand on the front-row seat and vaulted effortlessly into the aisle. "Then how about considering me?"

Principal Evans wiped his temple and whispered to the man beside him. "Mr. Hamilton, our school maintains strict discipline normally. Today is exceptional—"

Alexander Hamilton's gaze remained fixed on the stage, his voice low. "That boy's profile."

"Ethan Valentine. High school senior, sports scholarship, provincial basketball team recruit." The principal mopped his brow. "Bright personality—quite complementary to Evelyn's temperament. Though the age gap is... noticeable."

Before he finished, Ethan shouted toward the stage: "Senior, I may be younger but I'm great at taking care of people—"

The auditorium erupted.

The host hurriedly signaled. "Thank you for sharing, Senior Evelyn. Please proceed to the guest seating."

Evelyn descended the steps with quiet relief.

Students these days were far more direct than in her time.

"Over here!" Vivian waved vigorously.

Evelyn paused mid-step, her gaze lingering for half a second on a particular figure before calmly taking her seat.

Directly behind Alexander.

Vivian waggled her eyebrows. "Impressive. Even underclassmen are smitten."

"Stop it."

"Seriously, you should date after the divorce. That puppy-dog look he gave you—"

"He's underage. I'm nearly thirty."

"Age is just a number. Cougar relationships are trending—"

Principal Evans interrupted. "Evelyn."

She turned. "Principal."

"Allow me to introduce Mr. Hamilton of Hamilton Group. He's establishing a scholarship fund."

The air seemed to crystallize when their eyes met.

"Mr. Hamilton."

"Ms. Carter."

Evelyn asked softly, "Principal, was this fund arranged recently?"

"Six months in planning, thanks to Mr. Hamilton's support." The principal beamed. "Mr. Hamilton, Evelyn is our most accomplished alumna. Though her romantic life has been... challenging."

Alexander spoke abruptly. "Not anymore."

Department Head Wang chimed in. "Such an exceptional woman—my nephew happens to be single too. Perhaps—"

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Patrick? That chubby kid from before?"

"Quite handsome now. Teaches physics here." Wang smiled. "I'll introduce you later."

Alexander tapped the armrest. "Limited career growth for teachers, no?"

Wang faltered. "Tenured positions offer stability—"

"Annual salary?" Alexander lifted his gaze. "She deserves better."

The atmosphere turned glacial.

Wang looked awkwardly at Evelyn. "You two... know each other?"

The principal glanced between them, then brightened with realization. "Mr. Hamilton wouldn't happen to be—"

Alexander gave a slight nod. "The ex-husband."

Wang inhaled sharply. "What a coincidence. My nephew divorced last year too—"

"Indeed serendipitous." Alexander methodically undid his cufflink. "I'm currently single as well."
###Chapter 584 I Don't Date Minors - It's Illegal

Principal Evans rubbed his hands awkwardly, his smile frozen on his face.

A ponytailed girl slipped up to Evelyn and shyly handed her a note. "Senior Carter, Ethan Valentine asked me to give this to you..."

Evelyn unfolded the paper to find the words "Go out with me" scrawled in bold handwriting.

"Tell him I don't date minors." She refolded the note and handed it back. "It's illegal."

Alexander Hamilton stood nearby, his knuckles turning white.

Principal Evans and Dean Lorenz exchanged uneasy glances, beads of sweat forming on their foreheads.

"What about next year when he turns eighteen?" The girl pressed hopefully.

"Nonsense!" Principal Evans slapped his thigh in frustration. "You're in your final year - focus on your studies!" He glanced at Alexander's stormy expression and lowered his voice. "Tell Ethan to concentrate on his college entrance exams!"

The girl shrank back, then suddenly turned to Alexander. "Sir, are you single?"

"Taken." Alexander's voice was icy.

Principal Evans exploded. "Outrageous! Everyone write self-criticisms immediately!"

As the girl scurried away, Alexander arched an eyebrow at Evelyn. "Dr. Carter, quite the charmer."

"Likewise."

"I refuse outright." His tone carried hidden meaning. "No room for misunderstanding."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Mr. Hamilton thinks I wasn't clear enough?"

"Your choice." Alexander narrowed his eyes. "Just some brat."

......

After the anniversary events, Evelyn was leaving when a figure blocked her path.

Ethan Valentine stood in his basketball jersey, sweat-dampened bangs framing his sun-bright smile. "Senior Carter, I've got a game this afternoon. Will you come?"

"I—"

Vivian Dempsey grabbed her arm. "Yes! Absolutely!"

Ethan's eyes lit up. "East campus in thirty minutes!" He dashed off like the wind.

Evelyn sighed. "You're encouraging his misunderstanding."

"Young muscles are delicious!" Vivian's eyes sparkled. "I've upgraded my dating criteria to version 3.0 - tanned athletes are top tier!"

"When did this upgrade happen?"

"Just now!" Vivian dragged her toward the gym. "Life's short - seize the joy!"

They didn't notice Alexander rising slowly from the podium, his gaze darkening.

"That Ethan...popular?" Alexander asked abruptly.

Principal Evans mopped his brow. "Basketball team captain, flooded with love letters. His mock exam scores dropped significantly..."

Alexander adjusted his cuffs. "I'll take a look."

The east campus gymnasium buzzed with excitement.

Evelyn had barely taken her seat when girls nearby whispered excitedly: "Captain Valentine looks so hot today!"

On court, Ethan moved with panther-like agility, sinking three consecutive three-pointers that sent the crowd wild. He winked at the stands. "Senior Carter, if I win, movie date?"

The crowd chanted: "Say yes! Say yes!"

Vivian whistled. "Depends on your performance~"

Ethan gave a dashing salute, eliciting another wave of screams.

"Youth is wasted on the young." Vivian sighed dreamily. "No thirty-year-old has that energy."

Evelyn glanced toward the entrance where Alexander leaned against the doorway, his gaze sharp as a blade.
###Chapter 585: The Rivalry

"You'd check out underage boys?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

Vivian shrugged. "Just looking won't hurt. I'm not touching."

The referee's whistle pierced the air, signaling halftime. Ethan's team held a commanding lead.

The second half was delayed.

"What's going on?" Vivian craned her neck.

A girl nearby explained, "Their number five had an emergency. They're short a player."

"Ethan's team?"

"No, the opposing side."

Vivian stomped her foot. "Will they even continue?"

"They need a substitute, but all the seniors got called back by teachers—"

Before she finished, a tall figure appeared at the court entrance.

The stands erupted in squeals.

Vivian scoffed. "Doesn't he have anything better to do? First the anniversary, now a basketball game?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

Alexander methodically unbuttoned his suit jacket, loosened his tie, and tossed it onto a chair. He locked eyes with Ethan. "Provincial team?"

Ethan straightened. "Yes."

"Your opponents are short. Mind if I join?"

Ethan sized up the stranger, competitive fire igniting. "Sure. But you're playing in dress shoes?"

Alexander smirked. "Worry about that after I win."

Whispers spread through the crowd. Some guessed he was an alumnus; others thought he might be a school partner.

Vivian tugged Evelyn's sleeve. "Since when does Alexander play basketball?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"You don't even know that?"

"Never seen him play."

Vivian clicked her tongue. "Some marriage you have..."

Alexander suddenly looked up, scanning the stands. Evelyn avoided his gaze, focusing on Ethan instead.

The whistle blew.

Alexander's eyes turned icy as they locked onto Ethan.

For ten minutes, the court was dead silent.

What began as a friendly match became a duel between two men. Alexander attacked relentlessly, sinking a three-pointer immediately. Defense crumbled before him.

Ethan gritted his teeth, movements growing aggressive. After a clean steal, he scored with a layup.

Vivian jumped up. "Holy shit! Alexander's got skills!"

The girls finally snapped out of their daze, cheers rising in waves.

Ethan lifted his jersey to wipe sweat, revealing toned abs. Vivian nudged Evelyn again. "Still team Ethan though. Youth wins in the long run—he'll outlast Alexander."

Evelyn frowned. "Like taming a hawk?"

She was more concerned about safety. Ethan charged recklessly, sending opponents flying. Alexander remained composed, deftly neutralizing each attack.

The clash intensified. On Ethan's third failed block, he lost balance and crashed onto his knees with a pained grimace.

Evelyn tensed. "This is dangerous."

Vivian waved it off. "Boys will be boys. Scrapes are normal."

The game reached its peak. Ethan tried replicating his first-half dominance, but Alexander shut him down completely. Rolled-up sleeves revealed defined forearms, exuding restrained masculine allure.

Girls holding "Go Ethan" signs pivoted their cameras toward Alexander.

Another three-pointer swished through the net. The crowd roared.

Evelyn didn't smile, eyes glued to the court.

Ethan snapped. As Alexander jumped for another shot, he barreled into him.

"Thud—"

A body hit hardwood.

The whistle shrieked.

Evelyn's face paled as she rushed down the bleachers.

Teammates crowded around the fallen Ethan. Alexander stood alone, expressionless.

Blood seeped from Ethan's knees and elbows, pooling on the floor.

"Get him to the nurse!"

"He can't move—"

"Call the medic!"

Evelyn knelt to examine the injuries, relieved to find no fractures. "Can you move?"

Ethan sucked in a breath. "Evelyn... my leg hurts so bad."
###Chapter 586: Nothing Is Mandatory

Evelyn Carter's heart clenched as she watched beads of sweat roll down Ethan Valentine's forehead.

She rushed forward and knelt to examine his injury.

Alexander Hamilton strode over, his gaze cold as it swept over the scrapes on Ethan's knees. "This is nothing. Get up."

The basketball thudded against the pavement.

Evelyn looked up sharply. "He's about to take his college entrance exams. What if this affects his performance?"

"An athlete afraid of a few scratches?" Alexander scoffed.

The surrounding students exchanged uneasy glances, unsure whose side to take.

"Senior," Ethan said weakly, "I'm fine. Just lost my balance during defense."

Alexander's chest heaved, his voice tight with suppressed anger. "Then stand up."

Evelyn frowned. "A hospital checkup would be safer."

She signaled a teammate to help Ethan up. "Let's get him to rest first."

Turning to Alexander, she kept her voice steady. "It's just a friendly match. Was this necessary?"

"A game is a game," Alexander said darkly.

"You're years older than him. You should know better." Evelyn met his gaze. "A leg injury could ruin his exams. An injury could disrupt your work. What's the point?"

A vein throbbed at Alexander's temple. "You barely know him, yet you're this concerned?"

Evelyn sighed. "I don't understand basketball, but I can see you were both pushing too hard."

She turned back to Ethan. "Can you walk?"

Leaning on his teammate, Ethan paled. "It hurts when I move."

He tried to take a step and nearly collapsed.

Evelyn carefully inspected his knee. "I'm not an orthopedist, but a patellar injury can be serious. You need an X-ray."

Ethan panicked. "What about my sports scholarship—"

"It might be affected," Evelyn said gravely.

"Senior!" Ethan grabbed her wrist desperately. "My parents aren't in town. Can you take me to the hospital?"

As Evelyn reached for her phone to call a cab, Alexander snatched it away.

"Doesn't the school have a clinic?" His tone was icy.

"The clinic can't do CT scans." She tried to reclaim her phone.

"Let his homeroom teacher handle it."

"The teacher has class." Evelyn held firm. "I'll book an appointment first—"

"Ah!" Ethan suddenly cried out. "Did I break my leg?"

Vivian Dempsey stamped her foot in frustration. "I sold my car. There are no taxis around here."

Evelyn retrieved her phone, only to see the ride-hailing app displaying a 35-person queue.

She looked at Alexander.

His face darkened. "You can't possibly expect me to drive him."

"The patient comes first," Evelyn said calmly.

Alexander clenched his jaw and turned toward the parking lot.

Throughout the ride, Ethan kept complaining to Evelyn, while Alexander's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel.

At the hospital, Alexander hauled Ethan into the emergency room before Evelyn could intervene.

The results came quickly.

"No bone damage. Just soft tissue bruising," the doctor said, examining the scans.

Alexander snorted and walked out.

Evelyn stayed to help dress Ethan's wounds.

The nurse gave brief instructions before hurrying off.

"Senior," Ethan said pleadingly, "can you disinfect it for me? I'm scared it'll hurt."

Evelyn picked up a cotton swab. "I'm an OB-GYN. I usually perform surgeries."

Ethan stared at her intently. "I want to study medicine too."

She focused on applying the ointment.

"Senior," Ethan suddenly asked, "what kind of guys do you like?"

Her hand stilled.

"I've told you before—I don't know."

"Will you remarry?"

Evelyn countered, "Why must anyone marry?"

Ethan blinked. "That's just... what people do."

She shook her head gently. "I used to think that way too. Then I realized—nothing in life is mandatory."

Ethan looked puzzled. "Then... since our game was interrupted, and we weren't losing... can I take you to a movie?"

"No." Her reply was firm. "Right now, your only priorities are recovering and preparing for your exams."
###Chapter 587: I Was Targeting Him

Evelyn Carter stood up and straightened her white coat. "I'll go handle the admission paperwork. Your homeroom teacher has already notified your parents. They'll be here soon."

Ethan Valentine abruptly sat up, his feet hitting the floor. "Will you come visit me, Dr. Carter?"

"No."

She turned and left the ward. After completing the procedures at the registration desk, she walked out of the hospital entrance.

Alexander Hamilton was leaning against his car, his expression stormy.

Evelyn ignored him and kept walking.

"How is he?" Alexander straightened up.

"Just got bandaged." She didn't slow her pace.

Alexander quickly caught up. "I really didn't mean to—"

"Collisions happen on the court." Evelyn finally stopped. "But I don't understand why you'd pick a fight with a high schooler."

His eyes turned icy. "Are you calling me old?"

"I'm saying you're usually so composed. Why suddenly play basketball today—" She cut herself off.

A realization struck her.

Her head snapped up to look at him.

The man's eyes flickered with guilt.

"You did it on purpose?" Her voice was frigid.

Alexander pressed his lips together. "Yes."

"You're in your thirties. How immature can you be?"

"You have no idea what goes through these teenagers' heads." His jaw clenched. "At their age, all they think about is—"

"Is what?"

Alexander pulled out his phone and rapidly sent a message.

A photo appeared moments later.

"See for yourself."

Evelyn took the phone. The screen displayed a Japanese manga-style image—a female teacher in stockings pinned against a desk by a male student, her blouse missing two buttons.

"......"

"Now look at what you're wearing today." Alexander smirked.

Evelyn glanced down at her white blouse and tailored pants.

The phone vibrated.

A video began autoplaying.

"Ah!" She nearly dropped the device in shock.

On screen, the teacher and student were...

"This is what they fantasize about." Alexander retrieved his phone. "That kid was looking at you the exact same way."

Her ears burned as she spun on her heel to leave.

"I'll drive you." He grabbed her arm.

"No!"

As they struggled, Vivian Dempsey came rushing over. "Finally found you! Is Ethan okay?"

Alexander's expression darkened further. "He'll live."

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Someone's jealousy is strong enough to smell three blocks away."

Evelyn cut in. "Just minor injuries. He'll be observed for a few days."

"Good. Would be a shame if such a handsome junior got scarred." Vivian grinned.

"Going to see him?"

"Nah, company business." She waved a hand, then glanced at Alexander. "Mr. Hamilton, mind giving me a ride?"

He snorted and yanked the car door open.

Evelyn remained rooted in place.

"Get in." His tone brooked no argument. "Unless you'd prefer to continue our discussion about that video?"

Flushing crimson, she slid into the backseat.
###Chapter 588: The Enchanting Dream

Night deepened.

Evelyn Carter stood by the roadside, staring at her phone screen displaying "No available rides." She sighed softly.

Alexander Hamilton leaned against his car door, fingers tapping the steering wheel as he waited patiently.

"Get in," Evelyn finally relented.

Vivian Dempsey pulled her into the backseat. Alexander glanced at them through the rearview mirror before silently starting the engine.

After dropping Vivian off, only the two of them remained in the car.

Silence stretched between them in the confined space.

In the dead of night, Evelyn dreamed.

She stood at a lectern, her face clearly visible behind black-framed glasses. The audience wasn’t her usual students—just one man in a tailored suit.

Silver-gray suit, gold-rimmed glasses, sleeve garters glinting coldly.

The scene abruptly shifted to a suite at the Capital Hotel.

The lectern became a coffee table, where a familiar electric kettle sat.

"Ah!"

Evelyn jolted awake, her forehead damp with sweat.

She gulped down an entire glass of ice water, trying to quell the inexplicable heat inside her.

Her phone screen lit up suddenly.

[What would you like for breakfast tomorrow? Auntie Wu is on leave.]

Evelyn stared at the message, her fingers hovering over the screen, unable to reply.

A second message followed.

[I remember you liked steamed buns in the Capital. With soy milk or milk?]

[Goodnight.]

......

At seven in the morning, Evelyn was already at the hospital entrance.

She finally replied: [No need. Thank you.]

Olivia Lightfoot approached, and after exchanging pleasantries, Evelyn headed to the flower shop nearby.

"Visiting on an empty stomach?"

A familiar voice spoke behind her. Alexander handed her a brown paper bag, the aroma of steamed buns wafting out.

Today, he wore a silver-gray suit and adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Take it."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Dream and reality overlapped.

"Why are you here?"

"You’re avoiding me again." His gaze burned. "Avoid me if you must, but skipping breakfast isn’t an option."

She took the bag, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Alexander’s lips curved. "Buying flowers?"

"Yes. I can’t go empty-handed."

"True." His tone carried meaning. "When the relationship isn’t close, etiquette matters even more."

Evelyn caught the subtext.

When she was hospitalized in the Capital, Alexander had never brought flowers.

She turned to select a bouquet, but he bought a bunch of lilies first. "I’m the one who injured her. I should go with you."

"To apologize?"

"It was a fair sports injury. Why apologize?"

Evelyn picked a bunch of baby’s breath. "Then there’s no need."

"But I’ve already bought the flowers." Alexander stood his ground.

As they deadlocked, a familiar figure emerged from the outpatient department.

Lydia Laurent clutched her purse, her right hand hidden behind her back.

"Alexander, Evelyn, what a coincidence." Her smile was sweet, as if nothing had ever happened.

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. "Indeed, it is."

Lydia’s smile didn’t waver. "Are you both here because you’re unwell?"

"Visiting a patient," Evelyn said tersely.

Alexander frowned. "Is Mr. Laurent sick?"

"Dad’s fine." Lydia shook her head. "I’m here to see a classmate."

Her right hand remained hidden, but the corner of a medical form peeked through her fingers.

Evelyn recognized the familiar fold at once.

It was the mark of an OB-GYN doctor.

A sign of a complicated case.
###Chapter 589: The Eager Puppy

Alexander Hamilton gave a slight nod, indifferent to Lydia Laurent's purpose for visiting.

Lydia's eyes lit up as she seized the opportunity to step closer. "Alexander, my father would like to meet with you."

Her large, dewy eyes blinked innocently, her voice soft and sweet.

Evelyn Carter turned away with the baby's breath flowers in her arms. "I'll leave you two to talk. I have patients to see."

"Wait." Alexander immediately followed, completely ignoring Lydia's outstretched hand.

Lydia stood frozen, her smile slowly hardening.

Her grip tightened around the medical report hidden behind her back, crumpling the paper in her palm.

Inside the hospital room, Ethan Valentine was engrossed in his phone screen.

"Come in," he said without looking up.

"So this is your new room." Evelyn's voice made his head snap up.

Ethan bolted upright like a spring. "Evelyn!"

His face broke into a radiant grin—until he spotted the figure behind her.

Alexander stepped between them, coldly thrusting a massive bouquet of lilies into Ethan's arms. "Get well soon."

The flowers landed heavily against Ethan's chest.

Suddenly, Ethan clutched his nose. "I'm allergic to pollen."

Evelyn quickly moved the lilies to the windowsill.

"Don't touch the baby's breath!" Ethan blurted out. "That's my favorite."

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "How convenient. Selective allergies?"

"Allergens vary from person to person," Ethan said with an innocent blink. "Did your high school biology teacher skip that chapter, old man?"

Evelyn frowned. "Do they cover that in middle school now?"

"Self-taught." Ethan puffed out his chest proudly. "I'm going to medical school, Evelyn!"

Alexander scoffed. "A jock switching to academics?"

"I'll forfeit my athletic scholarship," Ethan shot back without hesitation.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "You have six months until college entrance exams. Think you can catch up?"

Evelyn frowned. "You're already on the provincial team. Don't make rash decisions."

Ethan's expression dimmed. "You don't believe in me either?"

"It's not that..." Evelyn sighed. "You should discuss this with your parents first."

"They'll support me!" Ethan's eyes suddenly sparkled again. "Will you tutor me, Evelyn?"

Alexander's face darkened instantly.
###Chapter 590: Green Tea Showdown

"Hmm?"

Alexander Hamilton's expression darkened as he immediately refused on her behalf: "She's extremely busy with work lately and doesn't have time to tutor high school students."

"I can wait until Dr. Carter has free time to ask for guidance."

"She won't have time."

"She must rest on weekends, right?"

"Year-round overtime."

Ethan Valentine widened his eyes dramatically. "Dr. Carter, does your company exploit employees like this? Should I help you file a labor dispute?"

Evelyn Carter smiled faintly. "I volunteer for overtime."

"That's not healthy, Dr. Carter. Principal Evans always says we should balance work and rest—"

"I know."

"Then..." Ethan's eyes lit up. "You must have weekends off! I can be your masseur—my technique is professional, guaranteed to relax your entire body—"

Massage?

Alexander instantly went on high alert, cutting him off coldly. "Which subject do you need help with? I'll tutor you."

Ethan ignored him, gazing at Evelyn like a scolded puppy.

Evelyn felt Alexander was being too harsh and gently explained, "I genuinely don't have spare time right now. Even if I agreed, I might not be able to tutor you promptly. Plus, my expertise doesn't align with your subjects—a professional tutor would be more suitable."

"No problem!" Ethan's eyes sparkled. "Just occasional pointers from you would be enough! I promise not to disrupt your work!"

An invisible tail seemed to wag furiously behind him.

Alexander's temples throbbed in irritation as he aimed for the jugular: "I heard you're quite popular at school. Suddenly quitting basketball must disappoint all those girls."

Evelyn recalled the basketball court that day and teased lightly, "Youth is so vibrant—the cheers nearly deafened me. Seems you're quite the heartthrob at school?"

The nearly eight-year age gap between them meant their school memories were worlds apart. During her student days, there were no such pristine tracks or multimedia classrooms.

Alexander added leisurely, "Young people today are far more open-minded than our generation."

He and Evelyn were peers.

Ethan suddenly dropped a bombshell: "Sir, are you really Dr. Carter's contemporary? You sound exactly like our dean of discipline."

Alexander: "..."

"Dr. Carter, this gentleman is older than you, right?"

"...Yes."

Ethan nodded sagely. "No wonder he talks like my dad..."

Innocently blinking, he turned to Evelyn. "Dr. Carter, is the Dean Wang you mentioned our current dean of discipline?"

"Yes." Evelyn reminisced. "He'd just become dean during my time. I never expected him to stay in the role this long. Back then, he always wore black and specialized in catching students late for evening study hall."

Ethan gasped theatrically. "Dean Wang is so trendy now! Pink shirts, red tees—we secretly call him the 'Raging Husky'!"

He gestured animatedly. "He doesn't care about tardiness anymore—now he ambushes couples on the sports field! Jumps out of flower beds with a flashlight bright enough to blind you!"

Evelyn stifled a laugh but chided gently, "Dean Wang is a dedicated educator. Don't address teachers like that."

Ethan nodded obediently. "Understood, Dr. Carter."

Alexander interjected icily, "Sounds like you have quite the eventful campus life? Plenty of experience?"

If Ethan could play mind games, so could he.

Ethan waved his hands frantically. "I've never dated anyone!"

Evelyn looked surprised. "A campus celebrity like you? Girls were very proactive in my time."

Ethan's ears turned pink. "Nobody writes love letters anymore—it's all about adding WeChat now."

Alexander seized the opening. "And you claim no experience?"

"I only received confessions! Never accepted any!" Ethan jumped in frustration. "Dr. Carter, you have to believe me!"

Evelyn thought of her uneventful high school years and murmured, "Campus romance can be beautiful... as long as it doesn't affect academics..."

Remembering Vivian Dempsey's painful lesson, she added, "But you must choose wisely."

Ethan's eyes shone brilliantly as he stared at Evelyn. "I have excellent judgment! Dr. Carter, you're the best person in the world!"
###Chapter 591: What Goes Around

Evelyn Carter remained silent.

Alexander Hamilton said coolly, "Judging people as simply good or bad is childish. The adult world isn't that black and white."

"Big bro, are you saying even my senior has a dark side?"

"Don't twist my words." Alexander's brow furrowed.

He merely thought this high schooler was too naive.

Ethan Valentine shrugged. "But you're right—people are complicated. Like you, all polished on the surface yet so passive-aggressive."

"..."

"And you're making veiled digs at her right in front of her," Ethan declared righteously. "Even if you're here to visit me, Senior Evelyn is Hudson High No.5's pride. I won't tolerate anyone badmouthing our alumni."

Alexander massaged his temples. "Are you an athlete or a debate champion?"

That sharp tongue.

Ethan turned to Evelyn with an innocent look. "Senior, did I say something wrong? I'm terrible with words—please don't take it to heart."

Alexander snorted. "Hah!"

Watching their verbal sparring, Evelyn was inexplicably reminded of the past.

Annabelle Taylor had been just as quick-witted back then.

But now that she and Alexander were divorced, the context was entirely different.

"You're quite eloquent," Evelyn remarked. "Consider law school."

"Doesn't law require strong language skills? Senior, I flunked Chinese—could you teach me essay writing tricks?"

Evelyn pondered. "Reading more helps."

"Like what? I've read the Four Great Classics—useless. Give me recommendations."

"I'll ask Director Lorenz to send you a reading list."

"Thanks, Senior!"

Alexander's expression darkened, his gaze sharp as a blade fixed on Ethan.

Unfazed, Ethan stared back defiantly.

Tension thickened in the hospital room.

Playing the injured card, Ethan sighed dramatically. "My classmates are waiting for me. So many exams to tackle. This time, I'm really buckling down."

This struck a chord with Evelyn.

She always admired driven individuals. Glancing at the bedside tray table, she said, "I should've asked your teammates to bring your backpack. This is a perfect study spot."

Alexander seized the opening. "Can't delay academics. I'll have someone fetch your bag from school. Evelyn, we shouldn't disturb his studies."

Evelyn nodded. "Alright."

Ethan panicked, waving his hands. "No need! My Chinese teacher's visiting after evening study hall—she'll bring my bag. I can ask her questions too."

Evelyn smiled approvingly. "Whether you pursue sports or academics, high scores never hurt. Teachers will support that initiative."

Ethan nodded eagerly.

"Do you know Mr. Macmillian? His Chinese classes are exceptional."

"Of course! He teaches my class now—he's visiting tonight!"

The coincidence made Evelyn's smile widen.

"He helped me tremendously back then. Who's your homeroom teacher?"

"Mr. Deross."

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Mr. Deross? He was my homeroom teacher too!"

"Seriously? Senior, we're practically fate-linked!"

"Is he married? I remember he had a crush on the music teacher but was too insecure about his receding hairline to confess."

Ethan grinned. "Married! To the music teacher! She just had twins—he's been grinning through every class lately."

Evelyn listened attentively, her smile unwavering as she shared more school memories.

"Senior, is it true someone died in that locked classroom in the lab building?"

Evelyn shook her head. "That's just the broken furniture storage. Only Old Zhao has the key. Don't believe rumors."

"Oh..."

Alexander listened to their lively exchange, a sour taste in his mouth. Evelyn had never shared these stories with him.

Ethan beamed. "Senior, you missed the library during the centennial celebration, right? I'll take photos for you after I recover."

"Sure, but that implies you don't frequent the library?"

Ethan scratched his head. "Only once—to help the math teacher move books."

Alexander finally interjected, "That's passing through, not visiting."

Ethan shot back, "Don't interrupt, bro. Hudson High's library is terrifying—Book Airing Day is the worst!"

Alexander frowned.

Evelyn quickly explained, "They spray insecticide year-round. The smell is overpowering—no one stays long."

"...That sounds familiar."

Suddenly, Evelyn pitched her voice higher, mimicking Annabelle: "...You don't understand Alexander. He hates century eggs and ginger."

Alexander: "......"
###Chapter 592: Going Home to Feed the Cat

Ethan Valentine looked puzzled. "Senior, maybe you should stay a bit longer? The principal and the others will be here soon—"

"No need." Alexander Hamilton cut him off abruptly, turning to Evelyn Carter. "Time to go home."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Mm."

Ethan wasn't ready to give up. "I thought cats weren’t afraid of the dark."

"Mine is."

Alexander grabbed Evelyn’s wrist and strode out without looking back.

In the hallway, his expression darkened. "He put on quite the act."

Evelyn quickened her pace. "This is a hospital."

The elevator doors slid shut.

Alexander stared at the floor numbers. "He didn’t even have a scratch."

"Now you know how I felt back then?" Evelyn said coolly.

His Adam’s apple bobbed. "...I was blind."

The elevator dinged as it reached the first floor.

Alexander caught up quickly. "Let me drive you home."

"No need. It’s just two stops by subway."

"It’s on my way."

In the end, Evelyn still got into his car.

"I want to hire a driver," she said suddenly.

His fingers tightened around the steering wheel. "I can drive you."

"That’s inappropriate."

"I don’t mind."

As she stepped out of the car, Evelyn glanced back at him. "I do. Personal time is important."

Alexander’s gaze dimmed. "Fine. I’ll have Emily Zade arrange it. It has to be a female driver."

"Just make sure she’s skilled."

Inside the elevator, Alexander spoke up again. "The cat shelter asked for some photos."

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

The moment the door opened, the Ragdoll cat pounced, rubbing its soft fur against her ankles.

Evelyn bent down to pick it up, her expression instantly softening.

Alexander quietly changed the litter and refilled the food bowl.

"It probably thought you abandoned it," he murmured, stroking the cat.

Evelyn shoved the cat into his arms. "Play with it."

"I could help you—"

"I’m going to shower."

Alexander stood in the living room, holding the cat, listening to the sound of running water. He sighed softly.

By the time Evelyn emerged, drying her hair, the aroma of food filled the air.

In the kitchen, Alexander was ladling soup.
###Chapter 593: I'm Afraid I'll Run Out of Excuses to See You

The aroma of cooking wafted from the kitchen.

Evelyn stood at the doorway, watching Auntie Wu bustling by the counter in her apron. Alexander Hamilton stood nearby in his crisp dress shirt and slacks, intently observing her movements with a slight frown—as if studying some crucial business project.

She cleared her throat.

Alexander immediately turned and strode to the foyer to grab his coat. "It's chilly outside."

"I just showered." Evelyn didn't take it, merely draping it over her arm. Her gaze swept over the shopping bags piled on the kitchen floor. "What's all this...?"

"The fridge contents spoiled." He gestured to the fresh ingredients on the counter. "The Ragdoll shouldn't eat only kibble. I had someone get proper groceries. That self-cleaning litter box is the model you mentioned last time."

She knelt to inspect the purchases—imported cat food, artisan toys, a premium cat bed. Each item carried a hefty price tag.

"How much? I'll transfer the cost."

"Unnecessary." His expression darkened.

"Gregory and I split expenses."

"I'm not him." Alexander's voice rose abruptly. "We adopted this cat together."

Evelyn fell silent.

He'd already turned back to the counter. "Go play with the cat. It's been eyeing that feather teaser for ages."

The Ragdoll circled the bags, tiny paws batting at them. Evelyn quickly scooped it up and began organizing the pet supplies—clearly curated, not haphazardly bought.

A nutritious meal waited on the dining table.

"Auntie Wu prepared it." Alexander rolled up his sleeves, droplets still glistening on his hands.

"I thought you were making cat food?"

He smiled without answering and retreated into the kitchen.

Night deepened.

Evelyn emerged from the study rubbing her stiff neck, drawn by the dining room light. The sight froze her in place—

The table bore an array of "dishes," if the charred lumps could even qualify.

Alexander appeared with a final plate of unidentifiable matter, his expression nearly as grim as the food's.

"Is this... fossilized charcoal?" She frowned.

"Sweet and sour fish." His voice cracked.

Her temple throbbed. "At this hour, you—"

"I'm learning to cook." He set down the plate, surveying his "masterpieces" with defeat. "Auntie Wu said practice makes perfect."

Evelyn studied the fish's glassy-eyed stare and carbonized meat chunks. No false praise came. "Some skills aren't worth forcing."

"I can learn."

"Resource allocation requires optimization." She quoted his own business wisdom. "Specialists handle specialized tasks."

"Gregory balances surgery and cooking?"

"...He does both."

"Why can't I?"

Understanding dawned. "You're competing with him over this?"

"I just want to contribute." His voice softened. "You refuse my rides. Your work independence grows. Today at the hospital... I realized how little I truly know about your life. Evelyn, I'm terrified I'll exhaust every excuse to see you."

Silence engulfed the dining room.

"Go rest." He began clearing the wreckage. "I'll handle this."

Evelyn's heart ached at the wasted ingredients.

Auntie Wu intervened tactfully. "Don't be cross, Miss Carter. Mr. Hamilton's first attempt shows promise! My former employer's daughter nearly burned the house down learning—fire trucks and all!"
###Chapter 594: I Just Want to Start Over with You

Evelyn Carter tensed at the noise from the kitchen and hurried over to check. Seeing the pots and pans unharmed, she exhaled in relief.

Alexander Hamilton found some comfort in Auntie Wu's words and set down the spatula. "Let's stop here for today. I'll clean up the rest."

"Alright." Auntie Wu untied her apron and hung it up. "Mr. Hamilton, cooking takes patience."

"Thank you." Alexander personally walked her to the door.

Evelyn frowned as she watched him return to clear the table. "It's so late. How could you let Auntie Wu walk alone? I'll call a cab."

Alexander dumped the failed dish into the trash. "No need. She's been staying in my guest room lately. I gave her a key."

"Your place?" Evelyn raised an eyebrow.

"Yes." He looked up. "Is that a problem?"

"...Why would it be?"

"She is a woman."

Evelyn scoffed. "A menopausal one at that."

The teasing in her voice eased the tension in his expression. "Leave this to me. I may not cook well, but I can clean."

"Alexander."

He stood there in an apron, holding a plate, his hair disheveled and smudges—whether from grease or sauce—on his face.

"Yes?"

"All this..." She hesitated. "Didn't we agree to keep things as they are?"

"I want to start over."

He efficiently soaked the dishes in the sink, then wiped down the table. The routine was practiced, as if he'd done it countless times.

Seeing his sincerity, Evelyn couldn't argue further. Eager to rest, she sighed. "You take the kitchen. I'll handle the living room."

"No." He tightened his grip on the rag.

"I learned many useless things for the wrong person. Now that I've found the right one, I should learn what truly matters." His voice was low. "At least to make your life easier."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. "There's no need to bring up the past."

"Fine." He kept working, changing the subject. "The early stages of your startup are tough. I know how things are at Anderson Group. I wanted to help but worried you'd resent it. So I settled for what I could do."

He pulled on rubber gloves and tackled the mountain of dishes. His employees would be stunned to see their CEO like this.

Evelyn watched his competent movements. "So your idea of helping is playing housekeeper?"

"I wanted you to come home to a hot meal." He was candid. "But practice makes perfect. That goal will take more time."

Evelyn glanced at the "results" in the trash and suggested tactfully, "Leave professional tasks to professionals. I can split the grocery bill."

She still wanted boundaries.

But Alexander was stubborn. "Didn't you say today that it's never too late to learn? If Gregory Wilson can do it, so can I."

He remembered even that incident with the fridge repair.

"Why so quiet?" he pressed.

Evelyn sighed. "Should I warn you not to emulate Gregory? He takes advice. You? Not so much."

He stacked the dried dishes neatly and turned. "I can do everything he can—and more."

"It's late. You should sleep." He checked the time. "This will take a while."

Exhausted, Evelyn nodded. "Lock up when you leave." She headed to her room, locking the door as usual.

Perhaps work stress kept her from resting well. She woke in the middle of the night to pitch darkness outside.

Thirsty, she tiptoed out—only to find the living room lamp on.

Then Alexander's low voice speaking English reached her.

"It's 3 a.m., you—" She froze mid-sentence.

In the dim light, he sat upright on the couch, laptop open, briefcase beside him—as if this were a makeshift office.

Evelyn lingered in the shadows until his call ended. When she approached, her eyes caught the screen—and she stiffened.
###Chapter 595: Midnight Meeting and an Unexpected Intrusion

The living room was bathed in the eerie blue glow of a laptop screen at three in the morning.

Evelyn Carter rubbed her eyes as she stepped out of the bedroom, her sleepiness evaporating at the sight before her.

Alexander Hamilton sat upright on the sofa, his laptop screen divided into four video feeds. Three blond, blue-eyed foreigners were engaged in a serious discussion, while an older woman occasionally jotted down notes.

His slender fingers tapped the keyboard intermittently, and he interjected with flawless English. Hearing movement, he snapped his head up, his gaze locking onto Evelyn in her nightgown.

"Sorry," Alexander swiftly closed the laptop and tossed his Bluetooth earpiece onto the coffee table. "Did I wake you?"

Evelyn noticed the dark circles under his eyes. This man, who always prided himself on his impeccable appearance, now had his tie loosely hanging around his neck.

"No, I was thirsty," she instinctively pulled her nightgown collar tighter. "You're in a meeting?"

Alexander was already heading to the kitchen. "Let me get you some water."

The hum of the electric kettle filled the kitchen. Evelyn followed and watched as he expertly adjusted the water temperature, his movements so fluid it was as if he’d used this kitchen countless times before.

"Lukewarm. Safe to drink," he handed her a glass, his fingertips brushing against the back of her hand.

Both recoiled as if shocked.

Cradling the glass, Evelyn saw the exhaustion—and something softer—in his eyes through the rising steam. She suddenly remembered how he’d stood his ground in the boardroom earlier that day.

"Trouble with the overseas branch?"

"Time zones," he massaged his temples. "Go back to bed. I’ll move to the balcony."

Evelyn shook her head. "Don’t let me interrupt."

As she turned to leave, his hand settled gently on her shoulder—warm, firm, and impossible to refuse.

"Goodnight," he murmured, closing the door behind her with the care one would use handling fragile porcelain.

The moment the bedroom door clicked shut, Alexander exhaled deeply and reopened his laptop.

Three grinning faces immediately filled the screen.

"Alex, was that your girlfriend?" The older woman winked.

The two male colleagues whistled. "An Eastern beauty!"

A faint smile tugged at Alexander’s lips. He didn’t deny it.

"So, serious relationship or just for fun?" The youngest executive teased.

Playful jeers erupted through the Bluetooth headset. Alexander’s gaze drifted to the closed bedroom door, his expression softening impossibly further.

"She’s my ex-wife."

The virtual meeting room plunged into stunned silence.
###Chapter 596: Working Off a Debt

Western culture has always been more open-minded. A man and woman sharing a room doesn't necessarily mean anything—they might not even know each other's names.

But Alexander Hamilton has always been meticulous about his reputation. The fact that he kept a girl at his place late into the night naturally piqued his friends' curiosity.

"She's not my girlfriend," Alexander said, unable to hide the sweetness in his voice. "She's my wife."

He deliberately omitted the word "ex."

The group call erupted into chaos.

For someone like him, having a girlfriend was already surprising enough. No one expected him to be married.

Amidst the congratulations, his friends eagerly pressed for details about their love story.

Alexander only smiled without answering.

"Alex, next time we're in China for business, you have to introduce us to your wife!"

"Yeah, we didn’t even get to say hello earlier. How rude of us."

"Just video call her now and introduce us!"

Their enthusiasm was overwhelming.

Thinking of Evelyn Carter’s likely reaction, Alexander sighed helplessly. "That’s not up to me. She’s very independent—it depends on whether she wants to meet you."

The faces on the screen all froze in shock.

Before they could bombard him with more questions, Alexander straightened up. "Alright, back to work. It’s already 3:30 AM here. If we don’t hurry, we’ll be pulling an all-nighter."

Only then did they reluctantly set aside their gossip and refocus on the task at hand.

Evelyn slept unusually deeply that night.

When her alarm went off, she drowsily reached out to turn it off and slowly opened her eyes.

Alexander should have gone back next door by now. Or was he still asleep on the couch?

Remembering that he had been working until 3 AM, she tiptoed out of the bedroom—only to nearly collide with Alexander, who was carrying breakfast in the living room.

The wall clock read 7:40.

"Did you mess with my clock again?"

"No."

"So you didn’t sleep at all?"

Alexander, wearing an apron, answered calmly, "I slept for three hours."

"Sleep deprivation can lead to sudden death."

"Dr. Carter, cursing me first thing in the morning?"

"I’m saying you should go back to sleep. I can grab breakfast on the way."

"Breakfast is important," Alexander said seriously.

When she remained frozen in the doorway, he set the toast down on the table and turned back. "Aren’t you going to freshen up?"

"Right. I’ll go now." Evelyn snapped out of her daze.

This scene was beyond anything she could have imagined.

Alexander making breakfast in her apartment? It felt like a dream.

Still in disbelief, she walked into the bathroom—and was stunned once more.

The bathtub was filled with warm water. Toothpaste was neatly squeezed onto her toothbrush.

"What on earth—" She peeked out to ask, only to meet Alexander’s expectant gaze as he returned.

"I drew the bath. I squeezed the toothpaste." His eyes sparkled with anticipation. "You’ve been busy with work lately. Saving you some time is the least I can do. Consider it repayment for letting me stay the night."

He had answered every question before she could even ask.

"I already showered last night. I just need a quick rinse in the morning—no time for a bath."

Alexander nodded obediently. "Noted."

"You letting me stay last night was more than enough to repay the favor." Evelyn eyed the prepped toothpaste, feeling oddly unsettled. "I can take care of myself."

"Understood. I’ll be more mindful in the future." Alexander smoothly conceded. "Go ahead and freshen up. Breakfast will be ready soon."

Without giving her a chance to refuse, he gently ushered her into the bathroom and closed the door behind her.

The word "future" set off alarm bells in Evelyn’s mind. But faced with a tub of warm water, she couldn’t bring herself to waste it.

In the end, she indulged in a short soak, emerging refreshed.

The dining table was laden with an elaborate breakfast—every dish prepared for two.

"We don’t need to be this fancy for breakfast at home." Evelyn frowned at the seven or eight plates.

Alexander, still in his apron, looked every bit the domestic ideal. "I’m thinking of installing a dishwasher to lighten Auntie Wu’s load."

"...Whatever."

Bringing up Auntie Wu made it hard for Evelyn to object.

"These dishes are from my place." Alexander handed her a pair of chopsticks.

Only then did Evelyn notice the mismatched tableware.

"Vincent bought them based on my preferences." Alexander said leisurely. "Seems we have similar taste."

"I just bought whatever was convenient."

"Then it must be fate."
###Chapter 597 Learning Skills for Her

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the dining room.

Evelyn stood before the table, her gaze shifting between two identical plates of ham and eggs. She casually picked up a slice of toast, layered it with ham and eggs, then added a few lettuce leaves.

The breakfast spread was excessively lavish. The fusion of Eastern and Western dishes was so nutritionally balanced it could have been crafted by a professional dietitian.

Alexander's eyes followed her chopsticks intently. Only when she took the first bite did the tension in his shoulders ease slightly.

"Auntie Wu prepared breakfast?" Evelyn swallowed her food. "You didn't have to wait for me."

"Auntie Wu went home." His voice carried a subtle hint of anticipation. "I made this."

Evelyn froze mid-motion. She stared at the half-eaten sandwich in her hand, her throat tightening involuntarily.

Memories from last night flooded back—the charred eggs, the lumpy bacon, and that ill-fated sweet-and-sour fish lying in the kitchen trash.

The only safe thing in her mouth right now seemed to be the lettuce.

"Is it terrible?" Alexander frowned slightly, picking up a slice of bacon to taste. "A bit overcooked, but the flavor's decent."

Evelyn eyed the nearly identical plates skeptically. "Are you sure you didn't mix these up with Auntie Wu's?"

She forced herself to take another bite—already doing him a favor.

Alexander sighed helplessly. "I specifically asked Auntie Wu to leave her versions too, in case you didn't like my cooking."

"So..." Evelyn glanced at the side dishes and porridge. "These are also duplicates?"

"Yes." He nodded. "From rinsing the rice to washing the vegetables—all learned on the spot. After last night's lesson, today went much smoother."

He said it casually, as if discussing the weather.

Evelyn sampled each side dish. Alexander's fingers clenched subtly under the table, more nervous than when awaiting tender results.

"I can't tell the difference." She set down her chopsticks. "The presentation on the right is worse. The left has too much sesame."

The corners of Alexander's lips lifted uncontrollably, his eyes glinting with quiet delight.

"Worth being this happy?" Evelyn found it amusing. "The man who couldn't even boil noodles has improved overnight."

Suddenly, she remembered the past. Back then, she'd been too busy to cook, and he'd never set foot in the kitchen. Turns out he wasn't incapable—just hadn't considered her worth the effort.

This realization cooled the warmth that had just begun blooming in her chest.

"If you like noodles, I can learn to make them tonight." Alexander looked at her earnestly. "Dough might be trickier, but I should master a couple of varieties by next week..."

"That's not what I meant." Evelyn quickly interrupted.

His gaze remained tender and focused. "I just want you to know—I'm willing to learn anything that's good for you. Starting now isn't too late."

Evelyn lowered her lashes, avoiding the intensity in his eyes. They knew each other too well—a single glance could reveal sincerity. But this sincerity had come too late.

She finished breakfast quickly and stood to clear the dishes.

"I'll do it." Alexander naturally took over. "Go get dressed. Don't be late."

The familiarity in his tone resembled that of long-married couples. For a fleeting moment, Evelyn pictured Alexander—apron-clad and bustling in the kitchen.

"What's wrong?" He studied her puzzledly.

Evelyn shook her head sharply, dispelling the absurd image. "Just thinking about work."

"Still wearing suits today?" He asked casually.

"Professional attire makes a stronger impression." She explained. "At my age, I need the wardrobe to command respect."

Alexander's gaze drifted toward the closet. "You could try the clothes I previously picked for you."

Those outfits had moved with them from the resort hotel but remained deliberately ignored by Evelyn. She refused to admit how Alexander had quietly infiltrated every corner of her life.
###Chapter 598: His Presence Lingers Everywhere

Evelyn's fingers paused on the wardrobe handle. She frowned slightly. "Professional attire better represents the company image. Wouldn't a skirt suit and trench coat be too casual for work?"

She stopped abruptly.

What did those whispers matter anyway?

During her hospital days, she'd learned one truth—gossip couldn't touch her.

Alexander finished clearing the dining table and leaned against the doorframe. "I often wear casual clothes to the office. No one dares comment. Not because my taste is impeccable—"

His gaze landed on the high heels by the entrance. "Competence matters more than heel height. Besides, watching you walk in those looks painful."

Evelyn instinctively rubbed her ankle.

Those shoes had indeed caused her misery.

"Easy for you to say," she scoffed. "No one would dare object if Chairman Hamilton showed up to meetings in slippers."

"Why not see the outfit I prepared first?" Alexander raised an eyebrow. "I bet you haven't even unwrapped it."

Evelyn turned back to her room, hurriedly organizing her briefcase.

USB drive, documents, notebook... She double-checked each item. As a newly appointed executive, she couldn't afford any missteps.

Her fingers brushed against an exquisite paper bag tucked deep in the wardrobe. She froze.

Alexander had personally selected this professional ensemble for her.

The sound of running water came from the kitchen.

Alexander efficiently washed the dishes. As he dried his hands, Evelyn emerged.

He stood by the entrance, studying her for a moment. "It suits you."

The tailored blazer paired with a turtleneck balanced professionalism with effortless poise.

Evelyn bent to tie her shoelaces. "I didn't realize Chairman Hamilton had such expertise in women's fashion."

"Observation isn't difficult," he took her briefcase, "when one pays attention."

"I should go." Evelyn checked her watch.

Alexander was prepared. "Emily is vetting drivers. Until then, I'll handle transportation." Seeing her frown, he added, "And check on Anderson Group's operations for your father."

An irrefutable excuse.

Evelyn sighed and moved toward the back seat.

Alexander's eyes darkened slightly, but he remained silent.

The car glided smoothly.

He occasionally mentioned financial news. Evelyn responded absently, her gaze fixed outside.

"Pull over at the next intersection," she suddenly said.

Alexander signaled the turn. "Worried about gossip?"

"It's hard enough being a professional woman," Evelyn adjusted her collar, "especially a young female executive. I won't fuel office chatter."

She exited quickly.

Alexander watched her retreating figure, fingers tapping the steering wheel.

No rush.

Patience was his forte.

Walking down the sidewalk, Evelyn silently thanked herself for switching to flats.

Alexander's suggestion had proven unexpectedly practical.

Three people stood as she opened her office door.

"Ms. Carter." Emily smiled and introduced the others. "This is driver Daisy Lee and assistant Ms. Liu. Both personally selected by Chairman Hamilton."

Daisy was youthful and energetic. Ms. Liu exuded steady competence.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on Ms. Liu for an extra beat.

"Call me Lucy," the woman offered warmly. "I didn't expect to be on par with Emily."

"You know each other?" Evelyn gestured for her to sit.

Lucy remained composed. "I worked at Hamilton Group's overseas branch. Officially Alexander's assistant, though we rarely met. Emily handles domestic affairs."

Evelyn pondered this.

Anyone Alexander personally assigned would undoubtedly excel.

More importantly—this "Lucy" seemed intimately familiar with Anderson Group's inner workings.
###Chapter 599: The Murky Waters of High Society

Evelyn Carter finally relaxed after hearing Mrs. Liu's words. "To be honest, I knew nothing about corporate management before taking over Anderson Group. I'll need your guidance."

Mrs. Liu smiled warmly. "Everyone starts from scratch. Mr. Hamilton specifically instructed me to assist you fully."

With both Alexander Hamilton and Emily Zade vouching for her, Evelyn trusted this new assistant completely.

She bit her lip, hesitation flickering in her eyes. "There's another thing... My management skills are nowhere near Mr. Hamilton's level. You might be disappointed."

No matter how infuriating Alexander was, his professional competence was impeccable.

Mrs. Liu understood immediately. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Hamilton doubled my salary precisely to solve problems for you. If you already knew everything, what would I be paid for? Starting today, I report to you alone."

Evelyn did a quick mental calculation—the salary was nearly executive-level.

She suppressed her surprise, but Mrs. Liu's assurance eased her mind. After all, no one would sabotage their own paycheck.

With a capable assistant, Evelyn finished a half-day's workload by mid-morning.

During her pre-lunch break, she headed to the restroom.

Just as she was about to exit, she overheard female employees chatting outside.

"I'm exhausted. The supervisor's been hovering nonstop—no chance to slack off."

"Same in logistics. People keep coming for supplies unexpectedly."

Evelyn paused, deciding to wait until they left.

Then the conversation took an unexpected turn.

"It's all because of the new Ms. Carter. Even Manager Macmillan has to tread carefully around her."

"Rumor has it she's Chairman Anderson's daughter? But doesn't he only have one daughter?"

"Shh, keep your voice down..."

"Why? We're not the ones with secrets."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow, listening intently.

"At yesterday's executive meeting, Mr. Hamilton personally backed her up. Manager Macmillan was speechless."

"Didn't Mr. Hamilton have a fiancée?"

"Long broken up! Heard someone interfered."

"So Ms. Carter climbed the ladder through Mr. Hamilton?"

"How else would she parachute into the CEO position?"

"Maybe even the 'Anderson' surname was arranged by him?"

"The old chairman's barely involved anymore. Mr. Hamilton's been running things for years."

"Rich people's drama..."

"Guess what I noticed? Mr. Hamilton has a fresh scar on his arm!"

"Oh god, you don't think..."

"Who knew Ms. Carter had such... wild tastes privately..."

The door slammed open as Evelyn stepped out.

The women paled. "M-Ms. Carter!"

Evelyn washed her hands deliberately. "I am indeed Chairman Anderson's biological daughter. And Mr. Hamilton has indeed helped me significantly."

"Ms. Carter, we were just chatting casually—"

"Office gossip is harmless," Evelyn dried her hands, "but keep it internal. Anderson Group can't afford scandals right now."

"Yes, of course—"

They fled like startled rabbits.
###Chapter 600: Merit Speaks Louder

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she pushed open the office door.

The mountain of files on her desk blurred before her eyes. All she could see was Alexander's commanding presence during the executive meeting. Those loaded stares had prickled her back like needles, forcing her to consider the PR crisis Hamilton Group might face.

"Ms. Carter?" Assistant Liu placed a neatly organized folder before her, instantly noticing her distress. "You look pale."

Evelyn realized she'd been sitting frozen for too long. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and forced a smile. "Just lost in thought."

Office gossip had wings no one could clip.

Assistant Liu handed her a steaming cup of tea, choosing her words carefully. "The break room chatter isn't worth your attention. I've heard far worse during my time at Hamilton's overseas branches."

"I'm fine." Evelyn's smile turned wry. "Just surprised how fast rumors spread."

She opened the file, willing herself to focus. The black text danced on white paper, refusing to imprint on her mind.

Assistant Liu spoke suddenly. "Mr. Hamilton once taught me something."

"Oh?"

"Rather than worrying about wagging tongues, let your competence silence them." She nudged the teacup closer. "I've never forgotten that."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "You admire him?"

"I respect merit." The reply came crisp and clear.

Evelyn's fingers stilled.

Was the ruthless Alexander in the boardroom the same man who'd gotten up at midnight to brew her ginger tea?

Her phone screen lit up.

[Alexander: Everything alright?]

She typed a single "Yes."

[Alexander: Breakfast tomorrow?]

[Evelyn: Whatever.]

[Alexander: How about soup dumplings? I'll make them.]

[Evelyn: The café downstairs has them.]

[Alexander: Their meat filling isn't fresh.]

She stared at the screen until another message popped up:

[Alexander: Don't overwork. Stay hydrated.]

Locking her phone, she took a sip. The delicate jasmine flavor unfurled on her tongue—the same blend from their resort getaway.

"This tea..."

"From Ms. Zade." Assistant Liu understood immediately. "Mr. Hamilton's instructions."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. The amber liquid reflected her faintly flushed ears.

At 3 PM, Anthony Taylor's call came through.

"Chairman." Her tone turned professional.

A pause on the line. "Any issues with the veteran shareholders? Alexander mentioned—"

"Handled." She cut in. "Mr. Hamilton made an appearance. Assistant Liu was exemplary."

The internal chat blinked incessantly on her screen.

Anthony's voice brightened abruptly. "The doctors discharged your mother today."

"That's good."

"I was thinking..." He hesitated. "Perhaps your adoptive parents could join us for dinner? Your sister's being discharged too..."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her pen.

"Emily needs rest." She kept her voice even. "Another time."

"Evelyn..." His voice quivered. "For your mother's sake. She checks her phone constantly, terrified of missing your messages..."

Outside the window, a plane tree leaf drifted downward.

"I'll stop by after work." She finally relented. "But my parents—I'll need to ask them first."
###Chapter 601: Whispered Rumors

Anthony Taylor detected the hesitation in her voice, his eyes flashing with hope while maintaining a gentle tone. "Work comes first. Leave this matter to me. Your adoptive father is straightforward but reasonable. I'll talk to him properly."

"Thank you." Evelyn Carter's fingers tightened slightly around her phone.

"Family doesn't stand on ceremony." Anthony hurriedly ended the call, afraid she might change her mind. "Focus on your work."

As the screen darkened, Evelyn exhaled deeply.

A mountain of files awaited her on the desk.

With her assistant Olivia's help, efficiency improved significantly. By the end of the workday, she finally closed the last document.

"That's all for today." Evelyn tidied her desk and said to Olivia, "I'll handle the rest at home."

Olivia smiled knowingly. "Director Carter, proper rest ensures peak performance."

The phrase sounded familiar.

Evelyn didn't dwell on it, grabbing her bag to leave. Colleagues in the hallway cast sideways glances, their hushed conversations cutting off abruptly as she passed.

Office gossip spread like wildfire.

In the elevator, two female employees whispered: "Director Carter leaving early again... must be nice having connections..."

Evelyn pressed the button impassively.

At the reception desk, she found it empty. Peering around the partition, she spotted several receptionists clustered by the floor-to-ceiling windows, pointing excitedly at the street.

Following their gaze, Evelyn's breath hitched.

The white Cayenne was unmistakable.

She instinctively reached for her phone, but the receptionists' chatter reached her ears:

"Mr. Hamilton's here again!"
"Heard he defended Director Carter at the board meeting this morning..."
"Could the rumors be true?"
"Which one? The fiancée or..."

Evelyn's finger hovered over the screen.

If even receptionists recognized Alexander Hamilton's car, any warning now would be pointless.

She debated calling her driver when the Cayenne's door suddenly opened.

Alexander strode forward briskly, breaking into a jog as he neared the automatic doors.

Every eye in the lobby turned toward him.

Stopping before Evelyn, his gaze softened with unmistakable tenderness. "Finished work?"

Evelyn stiffened under the weight of countless stares. "Is there something you need, Mr. Hamilton?"

"Just giving you a ride." Reading her discomfort, he took a deliberate step back. "Emails are so impersonal."

Nearby employees deliberately slowed their steps.

Evelyn kept her voice formal. "Company matters should follow proper procedures."

Once they were out of earshot, Alexander chuckled. "It's normal for us to know each other. Overly avoiding contact looks more suspicious."

"You're right." Her shoulders relaxed slightly.

"Heard some gossip today?"

"Yes."

"Bad?"

"About me, tolerable. About you..." She trailed off.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "What are they saying?"

"You sure you want to hear this?"

"All ears."

Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "They say you have masochistic tendencies."

Alexander's expression froze. "Excuse me?"
###Chapter 602: Rumors About Alexander's Special Treatment of Evelyn

"Perhaps they noticed the scar on your arm from the fire."

Alexander Hamilton nodded. "Let them talk. Let's get in the car."

Evelyn Carter politely declined. "I'm heading to the Anderson family estate today. It's not on your way."

His expression remained unreadable. "What a coincidence. I was planning to visit my mother. Still on route."

"The company driver starts today."

"New hires need time to adjust," Alexander countered smoothly. "Besides, energy conservation is a national priority. We should set an example."

He reached for her bag. Evelyn sidestepped effortlessly.

Retracting his hand, Alexander showed no reaction.

Eager to escape prying eyes, Evelyn strode toward the parking lot. Alexander kept pace, then overtook her to open the passenger door.

The lobby staff froze in shock.

"Even more intense than the rumors..." someone muttered.

"They say he left Miss Laurent for her..."

Inside the car, Evelyn massaged her temples. "Once Daisy gets familiar with the route, these 'coincidental' rides can stop."

"Rough day?"

"Assistant Porter helped a lot."

She avoided mentioning the office gossip. Alexander's gaze darkened as he pieced it together from her expression.

Andrew Anderson's call came at the perfect moment.

"Dad."

"Off work yet?"

"Just left."

Her father's voice sounded normal. "Your mother and I dropped our things at home first. We'll pick up Emily before heading to the Andersons. Have you left?"

"Already on the road." She hesitated. "How did you manage all those packages?"

"Well... Mr. Hamilton's secretary drove us."

Evelyn shot Alexander a look. He raised an inquiring brow. She shook her head slightly.

"...The senior Andersons were quite hospitable. They even visited Emily specially."

"I see."

"Don't wait for me. I'll—"

Alexander interjected, "We can pick up your parents."

Evelyn hastily covered the receiver.

"No use hiding it," Alexander said, eyes on the road. "The moment Uncle Anderson mentions the secretary, you're exposed."

Only then did she realize her father hadn't objected to the chauffeur service.

"What is it?"

"Dad," she took a steadying breath, "don't take a cab. I'll... give you a ride."

"You got a taxi?"

"No..."

"Then whose car?"

Alexander leaned toward the phone. "Uncle Anderson, it's me."

Dead silence.

"Evelyn, you two...?" Andrew's voice tightened.

"There's been some work collaboration recently," she measured each word. "Today he happened to be returning to the Hamilton residence... purely coincidental."
###Chapter 603: Sudden Change of Heart

Alexander Hamilton stood quietly, listening to their conversation.

Evelyn Carter rubbed her temples, her left hand still clutching her phone. She could almost predict her father's disapproval of her continued association with Alexander.

Yet Andrew Anderson's reaction was unexpected.

"Alright," his voice softened suddenly over the phone. "Your mother and I will wait with Emily at the hospital entrance. Are you almost here?"

Evelyn froze.

She instinctively glanced at the congested traffic outside. "It'll be a while. It's cold—don't come out yet."

"Got it. Drive safely." Andrew hung up before she could respond.

Evelyn stared at the darkened screen, her lashes fluttering slightly.

"What did you do?" She turned abruptly to Alexander.

"Hmm?"

"My father's attitude." She pointed to the scar on his forehead. "Last time, he looked ready to hit you again. Why the sudden..."

Alexander spread his hands. "I genuinely don't know."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her heart pounding.

This was too strange. Her father was notoriously stubborn. How could he change his mind overnight?

Unless...

Her gaze lingered on Alexander's healing wound. The bandage had been removed, but the scab hadn't fully fallen off.

"I swear," Alexander said, noticing her suspicion. "I didn't do anything."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "My father doesn't change his mind easily."

"Maybe he had a change of heart?" Alexander offered weakly.

Evelyn shot him a glare, her nerves frayed the entire ride.

Only when the car pulled up to the hospital entrance did she relax slightly, spotting her parents and sister waiting by the curb.

Alexander parked and immediately stepped out to assist. "Uncle, Auntie, please get in first. I'll handle the luggage."

The trunk was packed with carefully selected gifts.

Andrew remained silent but didn't reject Alexander's attentiveness, accepting the help without protest.

Evelyn helped Emily into the backseat, discreetly studying her father's expression. Seeing he merely ignored Alexander without any signs of anger, she finally exhaled in relief.

"Dad, Mom and I will take care of Emily. Why don't you sit in front?" she ventured.

Andrew grunted in acknowledgment.

Alexander swiftly circled to the passenger side and opened the door. "After you, Uncle."

Another noncommittal grunt as Andrew slid into the seat.

Evelyn's eyes widened.

The shift was too abrupt.

Her gaze darted between her father and Alexander until Emily subtly tugged her sleeve.

The sisters exchanged a knowing look.

Emily leaned in, whispering, "Dad's been different toward Mr. Hamilton these past few days."

Evelyn frowned, mouthing a correction: "Don't call him that."

Emily stuck out her tongue and lowered her voice further. "Uncle Taylor visited me often recently. At first, Dad ignored him, but then suddenly..."

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

Had Anthony Taylor convinced her father?

But that didn't sound like her father at all.

"Anything else?" she murmured.

Emily shook her head. "I was going to ask you."

Through the rearview mirror, Alexander watched their silent exchange.

Their eyes met briefly in the reflection—both equally perplexed.

An uneasy silence settled over the car until they reached the Anderson family home.

Evelyn gazed at the familiar street, her attention instinctively drifting toward the Hamilton estate before shifting next door.

The irony of fate.

The Anderson family staff recognized Alexander's car and opened the gates for direct entry.

The moment the car stopped, Andrew jumped out to assist Emily.

Evelyn handed over the crutches. "Be careful."

"I'm fine, sis." Emily winked, gesturing behind her.

Evelyn turned and locked eyes with Alexander.

He stood by the car, empty-handed—the family's seamless coordination had left no room for his assistance.
###Chapter 604: Two Families Become One

Evelyn Carter's gaze traveled across the garden, landing on Anthony Taylor emerging from the villa. He pushed Teresa Taylor's wheelchair with unconcealed joy.

Teresa looked much healthier than the last time they'd met, though her doctor had advised against excessive movement during recovery. Spotting her daughter, she nearly stood up in excitement before Anthony gently restrained her.

Evelyn offered a polite smile, though discomfort flickered in her eyes. No mansion, however luxurious, could compare to the warmth of her childhood home.

"You came at the perfect time," Anthony greeted warmly. "Margaret is here too—she prepared your favorite soup when she heard you were visiting."

Grace Anderson stiffened, discreetly tugging her husband's sleeve. "Did we come at a bad time?"

Andrew Anderson frowned, scanning their surroundings warily.

"Don't misunderstand," Anthony clarified quickly. "Alexander's mother came to visit Teresa today."

Andrew's tense shoulders visibly relaxed. "Margaret's always been kind. She treated Evelyn well before."

Hearing Margaret's presence, Evelyn felt some tension ease. She hadn't seen the older woman since the private jet incident. With Margaret here, the evening might be bearable.

In the living room, Anthony carefully arranged seating for Emily Anderson, who leaned on crutches. The younger girl glanced nervously at her sister, only sitting after receiving an encouraging nod.

"Make yourselves at home," Teresa said gently.

Evelyn naturally settled beside her adoptive parents, a coffee table separating her from her biological ones. The silence grew so thick the ticking clock became audible.

Margaret emerged from the kitchen carrying soup, instantly grasping the atmosphere. She deliberately seated herself between the two families, ignoring even her own son.

"Evelyn, you've lost weight again," Margaret fretted, clasping Evelyn's hands. "I made yam and pork rib soup—you must have two bowls."

"Thank you, Auntie. I'm fine," Evelyn replied, touched by the concern.

"Has Alexander been causing trouble at the company?" Margaret shot her son a glare. "If he slacks off, you tell me immediately."

Evelyn chuckled. "Mr. Hamilton has been very helpful."

Andrew and Grace warmed to their former in-law, their lively conversation leaving Alexander sidelined. Seizing the moment, Anthony ventured, "Alexander, why not stay for dinner? You always loved Auntie Marry's braised pork."

All eyes turned to Andrew.

Alexander remained still, awaiting the family patriarch's verdict.

Just as he prepared to decline, Andrew suddenly spoke. "The trunk's still full." He jerked his chin at Alexander. "Come help unload."

Evelyn's eyes widened. Last time at the hospital, her father had outright refused Alexander's assistance.

"No need for formalities," Anthony protested.

Andrew snorted. "Guests shouldn't arrive empty-handed." He directed Alexander like a foreman. "The tea set goes to Mr. Taylor. The herbs are for Mrs. Taylor—don't mix them up."

Alexander immediately rolled up his sleeves, trailing behind like an obedient porter. When they returned, Andrew strode ahead empty-handed while Alexander struggled with packages like an errand boy.

Evelyn whispered to her mother, "What's gotten into Dad today?"

Grace seemed equally baffled. "Maybe... he's moved on?"

Neither found the explanation convincing.

As kitchen aromas wafted through the house, Evelyn helped her sister toward the dining room. Alexander followed silently, maintaining just the right distance.
###Chapter 605: The Warmth of Fingertips

The dining room of the Anderson villa hadn't been this lively in years. The crystal chandelier cast a soft glow over the meticulously set table. Anthony Taylor had brought out his treasured blue-and-white porcelain dinnerware, each piece gleaming with a gentle luster.

The elders gathered around the main table while Evelyn Carter sat with her younger sister. Alexander Hamilton quietly took his seat beside his mother, Margaret Hamilton, who sighed softly at her son's unspoken tension.

The table was laden with nourishing medicinal dishes, each carefully prepared by a nutritionist. Anthony uncorked a vintage Bordeaux and personally filled Andrew Anderson's glass.

"Andrew, this toast is for you." Anthony drained his glass in one gulp, his Adam's apple bobbing as his eyes reddened slightly. "Thank you for raising Evelyn so well."

Teresa Taylor raised her glass, her voice soft but firm. "We owe Evelyn so much. Please review these documents—everything from the Taylor family will be hers."

Andrew stared at the thick stack of notarized papers, his calloused fingers tracing the rim of his glass. Suddenly, he threw back his drink and slammed the glass down. "Just promise me one thing—you won't let Evelyn suffer again."

"Absolutely!" Anthony's voice trembled with emotion.

Evelyn, who had been serving her sister, looked up at her adoptive father's red-rimmed eyes. Her chest tightened as she stood to replace both men's wine with grape juice. "The doctors said you should drink less."

As she turned, her fingertips accidentally brushed Alexander's hand. The fleeting contact sent an electric jolt through her, and she jerked back, sending a porcelain spoon clattering onto her plate.

The dining room fell silent.

Alexander's ears turned visibly red. He froze until Margaret broke the tension with a smile. "Evelyn, try this soup. I learned the recipe from Auntie Marry."

"It's delicious." Evelyn took a small sip, her expression hidden behind the rising steam.

Seizing the moment, Teresa placed a peeled tomato on her daughter's plate. "I remember how much you hated tomato skins as a child..."

"Thank you." Evelyn's polite reply came without lifting her gaze.

Andrew studied his daughter for a long moment before saying abruptly, "Evelyn, come home for a few days if work is too much. Your mother's been practicing new recipes..."

"Dad, I've hired an assistant and driver." Evelyn's voice was gentle. "Mr. Hamilton helped vet them."

All eyes turned to Alexander, who sat ramrod straight. "Emily Zade is a longtime Hamilton Group employee, and Daisy Lee is an excellent driver—"

Evelyn suddenly grasped her father's hand. "Dad, are you feeling unwell?"

Andrew's fingers trembled slightly. He avoided her concerned gaze. "It's nothing. Just... happiness."

Silence reclaimed the dining room. Outside, twilight enveloped the garden as the last rays of sunset filtered through the sheer curtains, casting dappled light across the floor.
###Chapter 606: Alexander's Antithesis

Normally by now, he would have shot Alexander a warning glare to stay silent.

"I'm fine," Andrew Anderson waved absently. "Just worried you're working too hard and running yourself ragged."

Evelyn Carter's brow furrowed slightly.

Emily Anderson jumped in to mediate: "Sis, I'll join the company and help after graduation!"

"Focus on healing that leg first," Evelyn chuckled, ruffling her sister's hair.

Anthony Taylor seized the lull in tension: "Health is the foundation of everything. You young people always think you're invincible until you reach our age—"

He exchanged a knowing smile with Teresa Taylor, their crow's feet etching lifetimes of shared history.

Teresa gently squeezed her husband's hand. "Facing mortality teaches you nothing matters more than family being safe together."

"Exactly," Anthony's eyes grew misty. "After all it took for our families to reunite, we should visit more often."

Evelyn discreetly studied her adoptive parents' expressions. Seeing no resistance, the weight lifted from her chest.

Andrew remained quiet a beat before nodding. "We should."

The two fathers unexpectedly bonded over retirement plans.

Grace Anderson sighed. "We couldn't wait for the kids to grow up, but now the empty house just feels... hollow."

Aunt Margaret immediately empathized. "Just an old woman rattling around my empty nest. If Alexander didn't visit occasionally, I'd talk to the walls."

"Grandchildren would be lovely," Teresa murmured wistfully.

Evelyn's fingers curled involuntarily.

Alexander feigned composure, but his gaze kept drifting toward her.

"Don't tell me you're starting the marriage pressure!" Emily grabbed her crutches dramatically. "I'm outta here!"

Grace stifled a laugh. "Your sister's the priority. You're safe for now."

Evelyn grasped for diversion. "How about a pet? I have a Ragdoll cat—"

"Me! I want it!" Emily's eyes sparkled like constellations.

Alexander interjected smoothly: "Dogs are good too. They can accompany Uncle and Aunt on walks." His tone carried subtext. "Like the one you're fostering at your colleague's place."

Emily shrugged. "Puppy works too!"

Evelyn arched a brow at him before asking her parents: "Cat or dog preference?"

Grace hesitated. "Let's settle the move first. Too chaotic now."

Andrew suddenly turned solemn. "Evelyn, I won't push you. But marriage is serious—find someone who truly knows and cherishes you."

The dining room plunged into silence.

Alexander rubbed his nose, shifting uncomfortably.

Those criteria might as well have been drafted specifically as his youthful antithesis.
###Chapter 607: The Heart's Bias

Andrew Anderson opened his mouth to defend Alexander Hamilton but swallowed his words when he remembered Evelyn Carter's suffering.

The heart always favors its own.

No matter how outstanding Alexander was, he could never compare to their biological daughter.

Teresa Taylor nodded in agreement. "Andrew's right. Terry has no experience with relationships. She could easily be deceived."

Margaret Hamilton forced an awkward smile. "Well, not entirely inexperienced..."

Emily Anderson suddenly interjected, "Auntie, do you know Peter Harrison?"

Margaret blinked. "Who?"

Grace Anderson explained, "He's the son of my best friend. Our families are very close. That boy is truly wonderful—we know his background—"

She was cut off by Andrew. "Let's not bring up the past."

Grace sighed. "Now that Terry's status has changed, the gap between her and Peter is too wide."

Teresa, however, grew intrigued. "As long as he's a good man, family background doesn't matter. Don't you agree, Grace?"

Andrew immediately frowned. "It's not about background. They're impossible."

Teresa turned to Evelyn. "Terry, what do you think?"

Evelyn thought of that small island in the Pacific and chuckled lightly. "I really don't like him."

It wasn't just romantic disinterest—she despised Peter's character.

Teresa looked disappointed. "Next time, keep your eyes open. Don't rush into marriage blindly again."

"Mm."

Margaret caught the subtext. Teresa clearly didn't approve of Alexander.

Of course—what parent would accept their daughter marrying someone who'd hurt her before?

Margaret's heart ached as she sighed silently.

"Mom, would you like grape juice?" Alexander asked.

"No, water is fine."

He turned to Emily. "Em, should I pour you some juice?"

Emily shrank back. "I—I'll have water too."

Her sister had just scolded her. Best to behave.

Alexander's smile froze. "Alright."

Andrew glared at his younger daughter. "Weren't you begging for juice every day? Pass your cup."

Emily cautiously extended her glass. "Thank you... brother."

Teresa suddenly remembered something. "Has the youngest son of the York family left the military? Did he transfer?"

Anthony Taylor nodded. "Over a year ago. We even received an invitation to his birthday banquet."

"I recall he's three months older than Terry?"

"Yes, exactly three months. We attended his hundred-day celebration when you were pregnant with her."

Teresa brightened. "Should we ask the Yorks if he's married? At least we know his background."

Anthony glanced surreptitiously at Alexander. "Let's respect the children's wishes. Terry doesn't even know him."

Teresa sighed. "It's our fault for being absent so long—we don't even know what men are in her life. Andrew, we'll need your help with this..."

Margaret suddenly spoke up. "Sometimes the old is better than the new. Those with existing bonds might be more suitable."

Everyone understood her implication.

Teresa smiled without responding.

Grace, fiercely protective, countered, "Once was enough. We can't repeat past mistakes."

Alexander sat stiffly, finally forcing out the words: "Auntie, I've truly changed. If you're introducing potential partners to Evelyn... please consider me."

Dead silence fell over the table.

Andrew's expression darkened as if weighing a crucial decision.

Emily whispered to her sister, "Does Dad have someone in mind? Who? Do I know them?"

"You do."

Margaret panicked and quickly urged, "The children are still young. Let's eat first."

Anthony also smoothed things over. "Right, the food's getting cold."

But Andrew locked eyes with Alexander. "Tell me—are your feelings for Terry genuine now?"

"Absolutely." Alexander's throat moved. "The truth is... they've always been genuine. I just realized too late."

Evelyn's chopsticks trembled, dropping a bamboo shoot onto the table.

Slowly, she pulled out a tissue and began meticulously wiping the oil stain.
###Chapter 608: My Word Is My Bond

The dining room was filled with the subtle aroma of home-cooked food.

Margaret Hamilton and Anthony Taylor exchanged glances, both holding their breaths unconsciously.

Andrew Anderson's question caught everyone off guard.

"How can you guarantee your words are sincere now? What if you change your mind later?"

His gaze was piercing, his voice low but firm.

Alexander Hamilton straightened his posture, meeting Andrew's eyes directly.

"Uncle Andrew, you've witnessed everything I've done these past days."

The scar above his brow was particularly visible under the light.

Andrew studied that scar for a long moment, his expression softening slightly.

"Even if you're sincere now, who can predict the future?"

Alexander clenched his fists.

"I swear on my life. I'll only love Evelyn Carter forever, without wavering."

His voice carried the unwavering certainty of words carved in stone.

Margaret interjected gently, "He's even considered adoption arrangements."

Andrew's gaze shifted to Evelyn.

She kept her head down, her lashes casting delicate shadows across her face.

"Pretty words mean nothing unless Evelyn agrees."

Alexander responded without hesitation, "My love for her requires no reciprocation."

The dining room fell so silent the ticking of the clock became audible.

Andrew nodded slowly. "I'll judge by actions."

"My word is my bond."

Alexander's declaration resonated with absolute conviction.

Andrew's expression finally relaxed. "Now that's more like it."

Evelyn's soup spoon froze mid-air.

"Dad?"

She forced a faint smile. "Didn't you say you wanted me home for a few more years?"

Andrew sighed. "Silly child, we can't be with you forever."

Evelyn avoided Alexander's intense gaze.

"My focus is on managing the company now."

"If you won't consider your future, we must." Andrew looked pointedly at Alexander. "After observing him these days... he's not entirely unsuitable."

A subtle smile touched Alexander's lips.

Margaret watched this exchange with mixed relief and concern.

Anthony remarked wistfully, "A parent's greatest wish is seeing their child find steadfast support."

Teresa Taylor squeezed her husband's hand. "Having someone by your side during illness matters more than anything."

Evelyn stirred her soup absently, offering no reply.

After dinner, Margaret prepared to leave.

Alexander cast one lingering glance at Evelyn, who remained distant.

Anthony insisted warmly, "It's late—why not stay the night?"

Andrew hesitated. "We wouldn't want to impose."

Noticing Emily Anderson's injured leg, Evelyn said softly, "Dad, Emily shouldn't climb stairs alone."

Anthony immediately added, "The guest rooms are ready."

Andrew finally acquiesced. "Then we'll trouble you this once."

Evelyn volunteered, "I'll help Emily upstairs."

Watching her father ascend the staircase, she suddenly noticed how his shoulders seemed less broad than she remembered.
###Chapter 609 Midnight Thoughts

Evelyn stared at Grace's face, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt. "Mom, has Dad been dealing with something difficult lately?"

Grace was organizing Emily's medicine box when she paused at the question. "No, why do you ask?"

"Don't you think he's been acting strange?" Evelyn's voice was feather-light.

Grace set the medicine box aside, brows furrowing. "Now that you mention it... I told him not to overreact when I heard Alexander was coming this afternoon, but he actually..."

"That's not all!" Emily sprang up from the couch. "Dad used to scowl whenever he saw Alexander, but today he asked him to help carry luggage!"

Evelyn's heart sank.

Grace took her hand. "Maybe your father has noticed Alexander's recent efforts. Ultimately, it's your feelings that matter most."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Mm."

Night deepened. The Anderson family was settled in second-floor guest rooms. Anthony and his wife had prepared everything thoughtfully—each room warm and inviting.

Evelyn paused outside her parents' door, hearing Andrew's thunderous snores. She closed it softly and retreated to her own room.

The bed was cloud-soft, but sleep wouldn't come.

At 2 a.m., she threw on a robe and stepped onto the balcony through the French windows.

The suburban sky was unusually clear, stars scattered like diamonds. The night breeze carried earthy scents but bit with icy teeth.

"Can't sleep?"

A deep voice came from the left. Evelyn turned to meet Alexander's penetrating gaze.

Their balconies were separated only by ornate railings.

She instinctively tightened her robe. "No."

"I noticed at dinner." His words blended with the wind. "You kept watching your father."

Caught, Evelyn hesitated. "Dad's behavior lately... it's not like him."

"Should I look into it?"

She shook her head. "If he doesn't want to talk about it, I shouldn't pry. But..." Her voice dropped. "I'm afraid he's in trouble."

Alexander's eyes darkened. "Lydia?"

"Unlikely." Evelyn frowned. "She's far cleverer than Annabelle."

The words slipped out before she realized. Alexander was already pulling out his phone. "I'll have hospital surveillance checked."

Evelyn suddenly gripped the railing. "Wait!"

A terrible thought struck. If the problem originated at the hospital...

Hands trembling, she dialed Olivia. "Pull up my father's medical records. Now."

Keyboard clicks echoed through the line. Each second stretched endlessly.

"Dr. Carter..." Olivia's voice turned hesitant. "Your father did visit last week, but... not as a patient."
###Chapter 610: She Just Needed Someone to Listen

Olivia Lightfoot's call hadn't ended yet when Evelyn Carter pulled up her father's medical records on her computer.

The line went dead silent.

Her fingers turned white around the phone. "Olivia?"

"Dr. Carter..." Olivia's voice sounded raw. "I..."

"Did you find my father's records?" Evelyn's voice was unrecognizable.

A single syllable. "Yes."

She drew a sharp breath. "Tell me everything."

Olivia knew her too well—that's why she hesitated. "Your father...has late-stage lung cancer. Diagnosed days ago. They're giving him medication, but it's just..."

A high-pitched ringing drowned out the rest. Evelyn mechanically said, "I see," before her fingers slackened. The phone clattered to the floor.

As she bent to retrieve it, darkness swallowed her vision. She pitched forward.

"Evelyn!"

Alexander Hamilton's voice cut through the night. He vaulted over the balcony railing, landing beside her in one fluid motion.

"What happened?" He crouched, pressing the phone back into her hand. "What did Olivia say?"

Evelyn stared blankly. "...Lung cancer."

The night air stilled.

Alexander's throat worked. No words came.

"Is there any—" He bit back the question. She was a doctor. This was cruel.

Evelyn's lips trembled. "If there were targeted drugs..."

"What do the records say?"

"...None." Her voice grated like sandpaper. "Those medications Olivia mentioned? Standard chemotherapy."

His heart plummeted.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. "I knew something was wrong...but how..."

"Come inside." His voice softened. "It's too cold out here."

"I can't sit still—" Her nails dug into her palms. The shawl slipped from her shoulders. Alexander snatched it up, wrapping it tightly around her.

His arms encircled her carefully. "Your father hid this because he didn't want you worrying. Tomorrow we'll visit the hospital. Maybe—"

He tried to help her up, handling her like glass.

Evelyn swayed as if walking on clouds, that relentless buzzing in her ears.

True agony, she realized, came without tears.

She let Alexander guide her, her gaze unfocused.

"I'll contact the top specialists." His voice strained. "If not here, then abroad."

At the word "treatment," her eyes finally sharpened. "It's pointless... I'm a doctor. I know what late-stage means."

Her voice dwindled to a whisper—a death sentence.

"I'm out of options." The tears fell at last.

Alexander exhaled in relief. "Good. Cry. You don't have to be strong with me. Your mother and Emily still need you."

Her legs buckled. He caught her effortlessly.

The night dew had soaked through her clothes, leaving her cold as a corpse. Only his warmth felt real.

Right now, she didn't care who he was. She just needed to speak.

"What did I do wrong?" Her voice shattered. "I've saved so many lives, yet everyone I love leaves me... First our baby, then you, now..."

The words died.

Alexander offered silent support.

Evelyn didn't sob. She simply buried her face in shadow. "It feels like I'm always losing something. When we lost the baby, I thought that was rock bottom. Now I see...it was only the beginning."

Memories sliced like shards—the sterile exam room, her father's evasive glances.

Alexander waited until she finished before gently stroking her back. "I'll stay. Even if you push me away."

No response.

"Just tell me..." His breath ghosted against her hair. "Do I still count as someone you care about?"
###Chapter 611 Hot Spring Getaway

The night breeze on the terrace was cool. Evelyn's fingers gripped the railing tightly.

Alexander's voice came from behind her. "Don't catch a cold."

He draped his jacket over her shoulders, enveloping her in warmth. Evelyn didn't refuse, murmuring a quiet "Thank you."

"I promise you," Alexander said suddenly. "No one else will know about tonight."

Evelyn's shoulders trembled slightly. She tilted her head back, letting the wind dry the moisture at the corners of her eyes. "Dad doesn't have much time left. I want him to be happy."

"I understand."

Under the moonlight, their shadows stretched long across the ground.

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn finished freshening up. She practiced smiling in the mirror several times, ensuring no trace of distress remained.

The doorbell rang. Margaret and Alexander stood outside.

"You're here!" Grace greeted them warmly. "Why did you bring so much?"

Margaret lifted a food container with a smile. "I made some breakfast. Thought it'd be nice to eat together."

Alexander stood behind his mother, his gaze instinctively searching for Evelyn. When she descended the stairs, he immediately noticed the redness around her eyes.

"Alexander, what are you spacing out for?" Margaret nudged him gently.

He snapped back to attention, arranging the dishes on the table. Crystal shrimp dumplings, crab roe buns, century egg and pork congee... The spread of breakfast foods emitted an enticing aroma.

"Mr. Anderson, try this." Alexander deliberately pushed a steamer of vegetarian buns toward Andrew.

Andrew paused, then chuckled. "You remembered I don't like meat."

The atmosphere at the table gradually warmed. Emily chattered about school antics while the adults laughed intermittently. Only Evelyn remained quiet, sipping her congee and occasionally offering a response.

"Actually," she suddenly set down her chopsticks, "the company is organizing a hot spring retreat next week. I was thinking... maybe the whole family could go?"

Grace's eyes lit up. "Hot springs are wonderful. I hear they're excellent for joints."

"I want to go too!" Emily raised her hand excitedly. "My classmates say that resort is amazing!"

Anthony and Margaret exchanged glances.

"That's a great idea," Anthony said with a smile. "It'll be good for Andrew to relax."

Alexander chimed in smoothly. "I checked—they have specialized therapy pools perfect for middle-aged and elderly guests with back or leg problems."

As he spoke, his gaze flickered toward Andrew. The older man was quietly eating his congee and merely smiled. "Let's go then. Wouldn't want to spoil the fun."

Margaret clapped her hands. "It's settled! Alexander, you handle the transportation and accommodations."

"No problem." He nodded, catching Evelyn's subtle sigh of relief from the corner of his eye.

On the day of the retreat, the sun shone brightly.

Alexander arrived in a seven-seater business van, the trunk packed with luggage. Evelyn emerged last, carrying a medical kit.

"Got everything?" Alexander asked quietly.

Evelyn nodded. "Just in case."

Andrew seemed in good spirits, even offering to carry Grace's bag. Only Evelyn knew he'd taken two extra painkillers that morning.

"Let's go!" Emily cheered, bouncing into the vehicle.

As the car pulled out of the neighborhood, Evelyn watched through the rearview mirror as her father leaned back in his seat, wearing a smile she hadn't seen in ages. Her nails dug into her palms, yet she maintained her perfect smile.

Alexander's hand suddenly covered hers, giving it a gentle squeeze.

"I'm here," he murmured, his voice barely audible.

Evelyn didn't pull away, simply gazing at the scenery rushing past the window. Sunlight bathed her face but couldn't dispel the shadows in her eyes.

She knew—this might be their last family trip together.
###Chapter 612: Unspoken Understanding

"Dad, you don't look well. Are you feeling okay?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as her gaze locked onto Andrew's unusually pale face. She avoided direct questioning, afraid to brush against that suffocating truth.

Andrew waved it off with a forced smile. "It's nothing. Your mother kept me up half the night insisting on picking out my outfit."

Grace shot him a glare. "Those old clothes of yours have seen better days. We're going out as a family—you should look presentable."

"What's wrong with this jacket?" Andrew tugged at the collar defensively. "It's comfortable and durable."

Anthony chuckled, playing peacemaker. "Andrew's right. My tracksuit is years old too. Comfort matters most for outings."

The atmosphere between both families was unexpectedly harmonious.

Margaret stood aside, eyes glistening with quiet joy.

Alexander loaded the luggage alone. When the driver Daisy moved to assist, he declined gently. "Check if Mr. Anderson needs anything."

Daisy hesitated, glancing at Evelyn for guidance.

Evelyn gave a subtle shake of her head.

Andrew's gaze kept drifting to Alexander. Though silent, approval shone unmistakably in his eyes.

"Mom, Dad, you and Emily should ride with me." Evelyn calculated the seating. "Alexander can take Margaret, Anthony, and Teresa."

The arrangement drew clear lines between intimacy and courtesy.

Anthony and Teresa, though yearning to be closer to their daughter, respected boundaries and ushered Margaret into Alexander's SUV.

Daisy promptly returned to the Anderson family's standby vehicle.

Soon, only Evelyn's immediate family and Alexander remained.

Alexander tactfully prepared to leave when Andrew suddenly spoke. "Your car has an extra seat, doesn't it?"

Everyone froze.

"It does," Alexander responded fastest.

Andrew turned to Evelyn. "You should ride with him. Three people in the backseat would be too cramped."

The excuse was flimsy at best.

Evelyn's nose stung. Her father had never cared about such trivialities—this was undeniably a nudge toward reconciliation.

"Dad, I finally have time to spend with you—"

"Sis!" Emily clutched her ankle dramatically. "My foot hurts from standing too long."

Evelyn sighed at her sister's betrayal.

Andrew immediately supported his younger daughter. "Grace, help me with her." The trio quickly piled into the car, leaving Evelyn no room to protest.

Grace whispered sharply, "Yesterday you said you'd just let bygones be bygones. Now you're matchmaking?"

"People must move forward," Andrew evaded. "Besides, can you name anyone who treats Evelyn better than him?"

Emily interjected slyly, "Mom, I want the front seat!"

"Fine, you win." Grace's attention was successfully diverted.

Outside, Evelyn watched her father's retreating figure, eyes burning. She turned abruptly before her tears could surface.

Alexander waited silently beside her until she steadied herself. "Let's go."

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn followed him to the SUV. With the backseat occupied, she had no choice but the passenger side.

Their synchronized seatbelt clicks echoed oddly in the quiet cabin.

Through the rearview mirror, Margaret observed the pair, her smile deepening. "Drive carefully, Alexander. We've got elders aboard."

"Understood, Mom." Alexander started the engine with practiced ease.
###Chapter 613: A Heavy Heart

Alexander Hamilton turned the steering wheel with practiced ease as the car glided smoothly out of the city. In the rearview mirror, Daisy Lee maintained a safe distance in the other vehicle.

Evelyn Carter leaned against the window, her fingers absently tracing patterns on the glass. The scenery outside blurred past, unnoticed.

"I remember the resort's hot springs are natural sulfur springs—great for joints," Margaret Hamilton broke the silence with a smile. "Andrew, you two should try them."

Anthony Taylor quickly chimed in, "Yes, Teresa's been complaining about her knees lately."

Teresa Taylor patted her husband's hand gently, though her gaze lingered on Evelyn's silhouette in the front seat.

Alexander glanced up from the navigation screen. "They've added a medicinal bath area. I booked us an afternoon slot."

As he adjusted the AC, his fingers brushed lightly against Evelyn's elbow.

She startled. "What?"

"Asked if you'd like to join me for the medicinal bath later," he murmured, low enough for only her to hear.

"Maybe." She turned back to the window, gripping the seatbelt tighter.

The car fell quiet again. Margaret studied the pair thoughtfully before suddenly brightening. "Alexander, what were those specialty dishes you mentioned last time?"

"Pine mushroom chicken and wild mountain greens," he replied smoothly. "Already reserved."

"Always so considerate," Anthony praised.

Evelyn closed her eyes, feigning sleep. She could feel Teresa's worried gaze but didn't know how to respond.

Two hours later, the convoy pulled into the resort parking lot. Evelyn was the first out, inhaling deeply the crisp mountain air.

"Sis!" Emily Anderson bounded over. "Which room is ours?"

Alexander looked up from unloading luggage. "East end of the second floor—best view."

Margaret suddenly took Evelyn's hand. "Walk with me?"

Evelyn's stomach tightened as she followed Margaret into the garden. Pale winter sunlight filtered through bare branches, casting dappled shadows.

"Child," Margaret stopped abruptly, "did Alexander upset you again?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"Then...is it the Taylors?" Margaret's gaze sharpened. "Be honest with me."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. How could she explain? That she was terrified of the impending farewell? That Teresa's forced smiles cut like knives?

"Just work stress," she finally whispered. "Year-end deadlines."

Margaret sighed, reaching to smooth the furrow between Evelyn's brows. "Silly girl, why won't you talk to me?"

The words shattered Evelyn's composure. She bit her lip, eyes burning.

"Mom! Evelyn!" Alexander's voice carried across the garden. "Rooms are ready!"

Margaret patted Evelyn's hand. "After the hot springs tonight, we'll talk properly."

Back in the lobby, Alexander distributed key cards—placing the Taylors near the elevator, Margaret in a quiet corner.

"Yours and Emily's room has a private balcony." He handed two cards to Evelyn, his fingertips grazing her palm.

"Thank you," she murmured, turning away just as Margaret scolded, "Did you make Evelyn work overtime again?"

Alexander sounded genuinely confused. "I didn't—"

Evelyn quickened her pace toward the elevator, leaving their voices behind. The key card burned in her hand, heavy with unspoken emotions.
###Chapter 614: I Can't Lose Him

Alexander Hamilton's gaze followed Evelyn Carter, hoping she'd glance his way. But her attention remained fixed on Andrew Anderson. A flicker of disappointment crossed his eyes before he schooled his expression.

Andrew suddenly spoke, "Can we change rooms?"

"Of course." Alexander immediately reached for the keycard.

Andrew waved him off. "Grace and I are fine. I'm worried Emily might disturb Evelyn's rest."

Emily Anderson jumped up in protest. "Dad! I came here to study!"

Evelyn smiled, ruffling her sister's hair. "It's fine. We can catch up."

Andrew gave Emily a pointed look. "Your sister needs proper rest after her shifts. That's final."

Seeing her father's stubbornness, Evelyn relented with a soft sigh.

Emily's eyes sparkled with mischief as she snatched the keycard. "Then I'll room with Mrs. Harrison! We bonded during the trip!"

She moved too fast for anyone to stop her.

Alexander discreetly memorized Evelyn's room number before heading to reception.

After settling her parents, Evelyn returned to find her luggage missing. As she turned to inquire at the front desk, she nearly collided with Alexander pushing a luggage cart.

"You?" She blinked in surprise.

He arched an eyebrow. "The bellhops were busy. Can't I deliver it myself?"

Noticing the sweat on his brow, Evelyn felt something stir in her chest. She stepped aside, her gaze catching the tip in his hand.

"Expecting payment?" she teased.

Alexander chuckled. "How generous."

With practiced ease, he unzipped her suitcase and produced crisp new bedding. "I know hotel sheets bother you."

Evelyn froze. She'd forgotten this detail, yet he remembered.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Seeing her reddening eyes, Alexander spoke gently, "I've arranged everything for your father. Medical staff are on standby 24/7."

Her fingers clenched the sheets. "He never acts like this...unless..."

"Unless his condition is worsening." His steady gaze met hers. "You're a doctor, Evelyn. You know better than I do."

Tears finally spilled over. "I can't lose him..."

Alexander gently enveloped her trembling hand. "We'll find a way. Together."
###Chapter 615: I Don't Want Her to Hurt

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly.

She understood better than anyone that this desperate hope was nothing but self-deception. Yet humans are like this—even knowing it's futile, we still grasp at the last straw.

Alexander stood quietly beside her, not disturbing her silence.

Some obstacles must be overcome alone.

Until the phone rang abruptly. Alexander glanced at the caller ID and answered immediately: "Mr. Anderson."

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Alexander's frown deepened with each passing second before he finally said, "I'll be right there."

That tone could never belong to Anthony Taylor.

"Was that my father?" Evelyn's voice tightened.

"Yes." Alexander gently squeezed her hand. "He wants to talk privately. Don't worry, I'll tell you everything."

Remembering her father's concealed medical records, Evelyn suppressed the urge to press further: "Alright."

The door closed softly, barely making a sound.

Alexander strode toward the emergency stairwell, where he found Andrew sitting on the steps. Seven or eight cigarette butts littered the ground, the acrid smoke stinging his throat.

He wordlessly sat beside Andrew: "You should smoke less."

Andrew stubbed out his cigarette with a bitter smile: "What does it matter for an old man like me?"

The words struck Alexander like a blunt knife. He suddenly realized Andrew might have seen through everything long ago.

Silence stretched between them.

Andrew's back seemed more hunched than the last time they met. Rubbing his face, he rasped: "You're smart enough to have guessed, right?"

Alexander didn't deny it.

"Evelyn...she doesn't know?" Andrew's fingers trembled unconsciously.

"She only noticed you've been treating me differently lately. She hasn't connected the dots."

Andrew exhaled shakily: "Don't ever tell her. If she wants to check hospital records, stop her."

"I promise."

The cramped space reeked of tobacco's bitterness. Andrew suddenly coughed violently, his face flushing crimson.

As Alexander moved to stand, a bony hand gripped his arm.

"Don't call the doctors." Andrew wheezed, "I've worked so hard to keep this hidden..."

Alexander clenched his fists: "Understood."

When the coughing subsided, tears glistened in Andrew's clouded eyes: "That child has always bottled things up. Even when wronged, she stays silent—afraid of burdening others."

His voice cracked mid-sentence.

"I've contacted specialists abroad—"

"Enough." Andrew waved weakly. "Just answer me this—do you truly care for her?"

Alexander met his gaze squarely: "I don't want to see her in pain."

"Remember those words." Andrew's hand landed heavily on his shoulder.

Amid the swirling smoke, Andrew's whisper was barely audible: "Grace is too naive, Emily too flighty. In the future...everything will fall on Evelyn."

Tears rolled down his weathered cheeks.

Alexander's throat constricted.

In that moment, the two men reached a silent understanding—some burdens are meant to be carried to the grave.
###Chapter 616: A Man's Responsibility

Alexander Hamilton bowed slightly, his tone sincere. "Uncle Andrew, I've never forgotten what you said at the Anderson family gathering. No matter what Evelyn chooses, I'll spend my life cherishing her. Her family is my family."

Andrew Anderson lifted his head slowly, illness etching exhaustion across his once-stern features. He sighed deeply, locking eyes with Alexander. "To be honest, I never approved of you as a son-in-law. Especially after learning what you did to Evelyn—I wanted to beat you senseless. If I hadn't feared dragging her and the others into it, I would have."

This stubborn old man had spent his life protecting his family with his fists. Even now, with death looming, he refused to waver.

Alexander remained composed. "A father protecting his daughter is only natural. I understand."

"You truly hold no grudge?" Andrew pointed to the scar on Alexander's face. "I ruined your handsome features."

Alexander smiled faintly. "A man's worth isn't in his face, but in his shoulders."

A flicker of approval crossed Andrew's eyes. He recognized the deeper meaning—shoulders meant responsibility.

"Fine. I'll trust you this once." Andrew pushed himself up from his knees. "The doctors say my time is short. I need to find someone reliable for Evelyn..."

Alexander immediately rose to assist, but Andrew waved him off. Still, Alexander waited until the older man steadied himself before letting go.

Andrew gasped for breath, chuckling bitterly. "Just sitting makes me dizzy. This body is truly failing."

His lungs could no longer sustain normal activity. If this continued, Evelyn would notice soon.

Turning to Alexander, Andrew's expression grew solemn. "You weren't my ideal choice, but right now, you're the only one I can rely on. Anthony says you've truly changed... Mr. Hamilton, I'm begging you—take care of my girls."

The proud old man bent at the waist, bowing deeply.

Horrified, Alexander rushed to stop him. "Uncle Andrew, you mustn't!"

Andrew completed the bow despite the sweat beading on his forehead. "You've accepted my bow—now remember your promise! Or I'll kneel!"

Alexander immediately returned the gesture.

Andrew's face darkened. "What's this?"

Meeting the old man's gaze, Alexander said, "I want you to know—even without your request, I would protect Evelyn and her family. You're a good father. I am not."

Andrew snorted, shaking his head. "That child..."

The words pierced Alexander's heart.

Andrew brushed imaginary ash from his sleeve, voice low. "I ask only that you keep your word. Even if... even if you falter again, for my sake and Anthony's, don't let Evelyn suffer."

This man who never bowed his head had set aside all pride for his daughter's future.

Alexander vowed, "I swear there will never be another mistake."

Andrew nodded and began detailing final arrangements. The usually taciturn father now poured out every instruction.

"Evelyn is stubborn—she understands but won't speak... Don't let her cry too long. It harms her health."

"Grace and Emily too... I leave them in your hands..."

Alexander committed each word to memory. "You have my word. I'll never forget."

Andrew only stopped when his throat grew dry. Before leaving, he gripped Alexander's arm fiercely. "Not a word of this to Evelyn."

Alexander remained silent.

"I have two, maybe three months left." Andrew's voice trembled. "I just want to spend these last days happily with my family... Alexander, help me."
###Chapter 617: Evelyn Is My Only Priority

Andrew Anderson bent forward deeply, his forehead nearly touching his knees.

"Please."

Alexander Hamilton's throat tightened as he watched the older man's hunched silhouette.

This once-proud man now bowed his head repeatedly for his wife and daughters.

And the person he was pleading with was the last man he'd ever respected—Alexander himself.

"I promise," Alexander's voice was rough. "But Evelyn is far stronger than you think."

"I know." A hint of pride flickered across Andrew's face. "She's always been the most sensible one. With you by her side, I can rest easier. But Emily—"

His voice cracked.

The older man wiped his face roughly with calloused hands before gripping Alexander's wrist with startling force.

"I know it's too much to ask, but...if Emily ever suffers in her marriage, will you—"

His trembling voice trailed off.

"I understand." Alexander clasped his hand gently. "Anyone who hurts Emily will answer to me."

Andrew gave a hoarse chuckle. "You punk."

"Feel better now?"

"You..." Andrew shook his head. "When you care for someone, you give your whole heart."

Alexander knew exactly what he meant.

"From now on, Evelyn is my only priority."

After a pause, he added, "And Grace and Emily too."

At the mention of his daughters, Andrew's expression softened instantly.

"What are your plans for Evelyn and the company?"

"First, I'll help stabilize the business. After that, whether she wants to keep running it or return to medicine is her choice."

Andrew clapped him heavily on the shoulder. "Remember your words today. If you ever betray Evelyn, I'll haunt you from the grave."

The older man exhaled as if a weight had lifted.

Alexander vowed solemnly, "If I break my promise, you have every right to take my life."

Andrew pressed a hand to his chest, his face pale.

"Are you alright? Let me take you to the hospital."

"No need." He waved weakly. "I want to spend my final days at home."

Turning, he pushed open the fire exit—his posture bent but resolute.

Alexander remained rooted until the figure disappeared down the hallway.

When he turned, his breath caught.

Evelyn stood at the stairwell landing, her eyes red-rimmed.

"How long—"

"I heard everything." Her voice was feather-light. "Thank you for respecting Dad's wishes."

Alexander moved quickly, wanting to wipe her tears but hesitating.

"Don't grieve. You're the one he worries about least."

Evelyn gripped the railing, gaze fixed where her father had sat.

"Dad never knew how to sweet-talk." A sudden smile touched her lips. "When we ate out as kids, he'd always say he wasn't hungry. I'd leave half my rice for him, and he'd immediately give it to Emily."

The memory made her eyes shine.

Alexander listened silently, unwilling to interrupt this rare moment of warmth.

"Enough." Evelyn drew a deep breath. "Let's go back."

She turned toward the stairs—her frame slender but spine straight.

Watching her, Alexander's chest ached.

He knew this stubborn woman was using every ounce of strength not to collapse before her father.
###Chapter 618: Compensation of Fate

Alexander Hamilton sighed. "It's okay to be vulnerable sometimes."

Evelyn Carter was already climbing the stairs, her slender back radiating quiet defiance. "If I weren't strong enough, I would've broken down when I lost my baby last time. Emily is still young, and Mom is too soft-hearted—this family needs me to hold it together."

"Actually..."

Alexander wanted to say she could lean on him, but the words died in his throat. Andrew Anderson had just entrusted him with his daughter's care—it felt opportunistic to voice such thoughts now.

He followed Evelyn in silence, escorting her back to her room.

Evelyn stepped into the bathroom, splashing cold water on her face. The mirror reflected her slightly reddened eyes, though no tear tracks were visible.

"Is the resort's medical team still available?" she asked abruptly.

Alexander nodded. "Places like this always have medical staff on standby. Given your father's condition, I made special arrangements."

Her fingers tightened around the towel. "Could you get some painkillers for me? Just say it was your idea."

She couldn't expose her father's secret, so this was her only way to ease his suffering.

"Of course." He agreed without hesitation. "What medications do you need? I'll prepare everything."

He assumed this was routine treatment, until he noticed the bitter twist of Evelyn's lips.

"I'll make a list." Her voice trembled. "If prescriptions are required, I'll have Olivia issue them."

Those potent painkillers were meant for terminal cancer patients.

"I've seen too many patients like this at the hospital..." Evelyn's voice grew faint. "Dad's so proud—he must be enduring it silently. I can't save him, but at least I can lessen his pain."

Suddenly, she grabbed Alexander's sleeve. "Could it be a misdiagnosis?"

The thought was a lifeline, but her father's reaction told the truth.

"About this..." Her voice cracked. "Can I rely on you?"

Only then did Alexander understand the real meaning behind Andrew's earlier words. The illness had already taken hold.

"Leave it to me." Seeing the tear streaks on Evelyn's face, his heart ached. "Cry if you need to—the soundproofing here is excellent."

Evelyn lifted a bewildered hand, touching her ice-cold cheeks.

Turns out, in moments of overwhelming grief, people really do forget they're crying.

Alexander wordlessly handed her tissues before stepping onto the balcony to make calls. When he returned, Evelyn had dried her tears, though her face remained frighteningly pale.

"The medications are arranged." He sat beside her. "The doctor will keep it confidential. This afternoon, I reserved two hot spring pools—shall we relax there?"

When she didn't respond, he added, "What your father wants most is to see you happy."

The words were like medicine.

Evelyn drew a deep breath. "Alright, I'll change. At least for today, I want them to enjoy themselves."

Relief finally washed over Alexander. "I'll inform your parents and come get you for lunch."

......

The resort dining room buzzed with familial warmth.

Daisy Lee excused herself to the staff area. Evelyn understood the discomfort and didn't stop her.

Emily Anderson leaned closer. "Sis, I forgot my body wash—can I borrow yours?"

"Sure." Evelyn turned to their parents. "Do you need anything? I'll bring it all."

Andrew waved dismissively. "What fuss does a grown man need for a simple soak?"

Anthony Taylor watched them enviously but could only say, "We brought plenty—use ours if you're missing anything."

Grace Anderson quickly declined. "We couldn't possibly impose!"

Teresa Taylor explained gently, "The doctor advised against hot springs for me. These items would go unused anyway. Just being able to stroll outside makes me happy."

Anthony nodded. "Yes, we'll rest first and join activities once we're feeling better."

Evelyn's heart clenched. They'd known all along they couldn't use the springs but kept quiet to avoid dampening the mood.

They'd rather bear the disappointment themselves than compromise her happiness.

Though fate had taken from her before, it had now given her twice the love in return. Wasn't that its own form of compensation?
###Chapter 619: His Thoughtfulness

Evelyn gently set down her chopsticks, her gaze soft as she looked at Teresa. "You've just recovered, so proper rest is essential. I have a colleague in the rehabilitation department at Central Hospital who specializes in wellness. When we return, I'll ask him to give you some advice."

Tears welled in Teresa's eyes, her hand trembling slightly as she clutched her chopsticks. "With your care, I'm sure I'll recover quickly."

Her movements became noticeably lighter as she served herself, even adding an extra half-bowl of rice.

Anthony watched the interaction between his wife and daughter, his lips curving into an unconscious smile. Even Andrew, who had been suppressing his discomfort, couldn’t help but look relieved.

Evelyn caught a glimpse of her adoptive father’s expression, and her nose tingled with emotion.

Alexander sat between Emily and Margaret, but his eyes never left Evelyn. Sensing her emotional shift, he immediately stood and picked up the teapot. "This resort’s tea is specially sourced. Everyone should try it."

He poured tea for each person with natural ease, lingering a few extra seconds in front of Andrew.

Anthony and Margaret exchanged a surprised glance but quickly understood and lowered their heads.

Margaret watched her son’s considerate actions, a flicker of warmth in her eyes.

Only Evelyn knew Alexander was covering for her. As he poured, he deliberately slowed his movements, letting the warm stream fill her cup gently.

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured.

The gratitude in those words held a meaning only they understood.

After lunch, Anthony and Teresa returned to their room to rest. The others took a short break before heading to the resort’s famed natural hot springs.

The hot spring area was divided into separate sections for men and women, each further partitioned by bamboo fences into private courtyards. Before leaving, Alexander gave Evelyn a meaningful glance, silently assuring her he’d keep an eye on Andrew as they headed to the men’s area.

Watching her adoptive father’s retreating figure, Evelyn felt a slight easing of her worries. With Alexander nearby, at least he could step in if needed.

Emily buzzed around the changing room excitedly. "Sis, why are you just standing there spacing out?"

"Huh?" Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts. "Go ahead and shower first. I’ll join you soon."

"But you’ve already changed into your robe," Emily said, eyeing her suspiciously.

Evelyn rubbed her temples, realizing her distraction. "I was just thinking. Where’s Mom? It’s her first time here—"

Before she could finish, Grace and Margaret walked in, chatting and laughing. Their hair was neatly pinned up, and they carried matching towels.

"Mom, you—" Evelyn stared at her mother in surprise.

Grace linked arms with Margaret. "Thanks to Margaret’s guidance, I’ve learned so much about hot spring etiquette."

Emily leaned in and whispered, "Sis, Margaret and Mom have really hit it off. They were just discussing which hairstyle works best for soaking."

Evelyn finally relaxed. She looked at Margaret gratefully. "Margaret, thank you so much."

Margaret waved a hand, her tone gentle. "Your mother and I get along well. It’s only natural to help each other. But you—you’ve been pushing yourself too hard lately. Today, just unwind."

Emily suddenly lowered her voice. "Sis, are you overthinking things because of your ex?"

Evelyn’s fingers twitched. She pinched her sister’s cheek playfully. "Don’t be ridiculous."

"I think your ex has changed a lot," Emily said, blinking. "If he keeps treating you well, Dad would be happy too."

"Yeah…" Evelyn echoed softly. "There’s still time."

The words cut like a knife.

She still had time.

But her father’s time was running out.

Grace called out, "Come on, I heard these hot springs are great for the skin."

Margaret reminded Emily thoughtfully, "Tie your hair up tightly. The steam can make you catch a chill."

Evelyn watched as her mother and sister carefully adjusted their hair under Margaret’s guidance, her eyes stinging again. These small acts of kindness moved her more than any words ever could.
###Chapter 620: A Brush of Shoes

Grace Anderson was the last to get ready before the four women stepped into the misty private hot spring.

Wrapped in a towel, Grace tentatively dipped her toes into the water, only to be pulled in by Aunt Margaret. The warmth enveloped her instantly, drawing a contented sigh. "This beats our bathtub at home by miles."

Emily Anderson splashed into the water like an excited fish, immediately dousing Evelyn Carter with droplets that shimmered like rainbows in the sunlight. The sisters' laughter echoed through the space.

"Look how happy they are," Grace murmured, leaning against the stone edge beside Margaret, both wearing maternal smiles.

A wistful gleam flickered in Margaret's eyes. "Youth is such a gift. Twenty years ago, I'd have joined their antics without hesitation."

The two mothers soon fell into easy conversation, reminiscing about their younger days.

"I might have stayed single forever if I hadn't met Andrew," Grace mused, watching flower petals drift across the water's surface.

Margaret perked up. "Engineer Anderson seemed so serious—I'd never have guessed he was the romantic type."

A blush tinted Grace's cheeks. "Back then, we didn't overthink things. After one movie date, he pointed at the sky and said city stars were dull compared to the Milky Way in the mountains."

Both sisters immediately pricked up their ears.

"Did Dad take you?" Emily asked eagerly.

Grace shook her head with a soft smile. "You two came along after we married. Stargazing got lost in diapers and night feeds."

Evelyn's chest tightened. Calculating the timeline of her parents' marriage, she felt sudden heat behind her eyes.

"Mom," she said quietly but firmly, "I'll take you to see the real Milky Way."

Grace waved her off. "Oh, I was just rambling. You're so busy with work—"

"It's no trouble," Margaret interjected, already reaching for her phone. "I'll have Alexander arrange it."

The call connected faster than Grace's protests. Within minutes, camping plans were set.

At dusk, the group assembled by the resort entrance.

Alexander Hamilton explained, "The resort provides professional camping services. Equipment's already been taken up the mountain."

Andrew Anderson looked revitalized. "Never thought I'd go camping at my age." He turned to his wife. "Finally keeping my promise to show you the galaxy."

Grace playfully swatted his arm. "Must you say such things in front of the children?"

"Was I lying?" Andrew boomed with laughter.

Evelyn smiled at her parents' banter—until she felt a gentle nudge against her foot beneath the table. Alexander's shoe had brushed hers.

She looked up to meet his smiling eyes.
###Chapter 621: The Depth of Love, the Weight of Pain

Alexander Hamilton leaned close to Evelyn Carter's ear, his warm breath brushing against her skin. "The temperature drops sharply in the mountains. Everyone brought thick coats—you should go change into one too."

Evelyn clenched the hem of her shirt, her voice barely audible. "I... forgot to pack one."

The corner of Alexander's lips lifted. "I figured. There are two in the black organizer pouch on the outer layer of my suitcase. I packed them for you."

Evelyn turned her face away, her lashes fluttering faintly. She had said "thank you" too many times these past days—so often it now felt awkward between them.

Night fell swiftly. By the time the convoy reached the campsite, stars already dotted the sky.

Alexander assembled the tent frame with efficient but slightly unpracticed movements. Andrew Anderson rolled up his sleeves and approached. "You need to secure the diagonal supports first for stability."

"Mr. Anderson, please, just rest." Alexander quickly stopped him.

Andrew glanced toward his wife and daughters, busy elsewhere, then lowered his voice. "Alexander... those medications... you arranged for them to be delivered, didn’t you?"

Alexander paused mid-motion, then nodded quietly.

"I knew it." Andrew smiled. "They work wonders. The pain’s completely gone now."

Alexander’s throat tightened. He didn’t dare respond, remembering all too clearly the way Evelyn had looked at him with red-rimmed eyes when she’d begged for his help.

As the aroma of barbecue filled the air, the Milky Way stretched across the night sky. Emily Anderson squealed in delight. "Oh my god! This is breathtaking!"

Evelyn grabbed her sister’s arm before she could rush forward, directing her gaze ahead—where Andrew had his arm around Grace Anderson’s shoulders, the two of them leaning close as they admired the stars.

"Since when is Dad this romantic...?" Emily muttered under her breath.

Evelyn abruptly turned away. "I’ve got something in my eye. I need tissues."

She strode toward the tent, her nails digging into her palms. Alexander followed silently, offering her a packet. "Here. Tears will give you away."

Evelyn tilted her head up, the starlight fracturing in her eyes.

"I’ve witnessed so much life and death..." Her voice trembled. "But when it’s my own family, all rationality becomes a cruel joke."

Alexander watched her shaking shoulders. "Your father is happy. He thinks those medications were just something I happened to bring."

"That’s for the best." Evelyn crushed the tissues in her grip. "At least he doesn’t have to endure the pain anymore..."

The night wind carried memories with it.

"In medical school, I thought I was prepared to face mortality." Her laugh was bitter. "But when the moment arrives, you realize no amount of mental preparation is enough."

Alexander gently took her icy hand. "Being with them now is the greatest comfort you can give."

Evelyn stared at her parents’ silhouettes under the stars, her tears finally breaking free. "I promised them a better life... and now..."

"Leave it to me." Alexander’s voice was firm. "I’ll handle the company. You focus on your family."

Evelyn drew a deep breath, wiping her cheeks. "I have to stay strong... Mom and Emily still need me."

"You’re stronger than you think."

Evelyn gazed at the endless sky, whispering, "The deeper the love, the heavier the grief. But the pain... is proof that love was real."
###Chapter 622: A Scientist's Romance

The night deepened as Evelyn Carter sat alone on the stone steps outside the tent.

Her fingers absently traced the phone screen, still displaying the last message from her father. She looked up at the starry sky, where the Milky Way stretched like a shattered ribbon across the inky expanse.

"What are you thinking about?"

Alexander Hamilton's voice carried on the cool night breeze as he approached. He held two cans of beer and settled beside her.

Evelyn took the offered drink, the icy metal making her fingertips tremble. "The edge of the universe."

"Are all scientists this poetic?" Alexander chuckled, the crisp sound of his can opening piercing the quiet night.

"It's not poetry. It's fact." She took a sip. "According to Hubble's Law, the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. One day, all galaxies will drift beyond our reach—even light won't catch up."

Moonlight outlined Evelyn's sharp profile as Alexander studied her. "And humanity?"

"Extinct." Her answer was clinical. "Like the dinosaurs."

The wind rustled through the trees.

Alexander suddenly reached out, brushing a fingertip near her eye. "Then why are you crying?"

Evelyn froze. She thought she'd hidden it well.

"Afraid of loneliness?" His voice softened. "Or goodbyes?"

She didn't answer. The beer can dented slightly in her grip.

"I'll stay with you," Alexander said. "Until the end of the universe."

Evelyn finally turned to him. "Do you know how long the universe will last?"

"No. But I know my lifespan." His gaze held hers. "I'll outlive you by five years and three months."

"That specific?"

"I researched it." His tone was earnest. "Men have shorter average lifespans than women, so I exercise daily, quit smoking and drinking, get regular checkups. Five years and three months—enough time to arrange everything so you won't worry."

Her nails dug into her palms.

"Of course, if you marry someone younger," he continued, "I'll adjust to outlive him by one day."

"Alexander." Evelyn cut him off. "Do you know what male animals do to ensure reproduction?"

"Yes. But I'm human." He smiled. "Humans sacrifice reproduction for love."

Andrew Anderson's laughter echoed in the distance. The bonfire had died, but its warmth lingered in the air.

Evelyn stood abruptly. "I'll go prepare the sleeping bags."

Alexander watched her retreating figure but didn't follow.

Later, Emily Anderson came running in a panic.

"Alex!" She gasped for breath. "Evelyn's crying!"

He sprang up but paused at the tent entrance. Gently pulling the zipper aside, he heard muffled sobs inside.

"Should we go in?" Emily fretted.

Alexander shook his head, sealing the tent again. "Let her cry."

"But—"

"Some emotions," he said, gazing at the stars, "need to be felt alone."

The Milky Way still glittered, eternal and unchanging. Yet Alexander knew those starlight beams had traveled billions of years—their source stars likely long dead by now.

Just as the tears in that tent would eventually stop.
###Chapter 623: May I Come In?

Alexander Hamilton treated Evelyn Carter as if she were fragile glass these days, even moderating his breathing to avoid disturbing her.

Emily Anderson eyed him suspiciously. "You swear you didn't upset my sister?"

"Wouldn't dare," Alexander replied with a wry smile.

Emily gave a hesitant nod. "Fine. I'll check on her."

"Let me," Alexander intercepted her. "Your sister will worry if she sees you up this late."

After a brief pause, Emily turned away—though she glanced back every few steps.

Alexander moved soundlessly toward Evelyn's tent. The night breeze carried faint sobs to his ears, tightening his chest. He tapped lightly on the canvas.

The crying ceased abruptly.

"Who is it?" Evelyn's voice was thick.

"Me."

"What do you want?"

"Emily heard you crying. She's concerned."

Fabric rustled as Evelyn cracked the tent flap open. "She heard me?"

"Yeah."

"She—"

"Let me come in," Alexander murmured. "It's not safe to talk out here."

After a long hesitation, Evelyn unzipped the entrance. Moonlight revealed her swollen eyes.

Alexander's gaze flickered to the plastic bag overflowing with tissues before he averted it. "You sure you're okay?"

"I'm fine," Evelyn rasped. "Go rest."

He noted the glow from Emily's nearby tent. "Your sister's still awake. Can we talk inside?"

The cramped space forced them to sit shoulder-to-shoulder. Alexander's tall frame nearly filled the tent as he carefully resealed the zipper.

"It's too small," Evelyn whispered.

"Doesn't matter." His eyes lingered on her damp lashes. "You seemed fine earlier when we watched the Milky Way. What happened?"

Evelyn crushed a tissue in her fist. "I went to check on Dad... He said he was getting Mom's jacket, but I followed him—" Her voice fractured. "He collapsed in pain..."

Alexander's chest constricted, recalling Andrew Anderson's strained composure on the staircase earlier.

"I gave your father painkillers this afternoon," he said tightly. "They must've worn off."

Fresh tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks. "I can't even bring him more medication—"

"I have them here. But with Grace present, how do we—"

Evelyn suddenly gripped his arm. "What if we get Mom to sleep in my tent?"

Alexander considered this. "There might be another way..."
###Chapter 624: Perhaps the Last Time

The mountain night sky was exceptionally clear, scattered with stars like diamonds strewn across the heavens. The bright moonlight cast a silvery glow over the tents.

Grace Anderson had already fallen into a deep slumber, her breathing steady and even. But Andrew Anderson lay curled in his sleeping bag, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. His right hand pressed firmly against his abdomen, knuckles white with tension. He clenched his teeth, careful not to make a sound that might disturb his wife.

Suddenly, his phone screen lit up, piercing the darkness.

Gritting through the pain, Andrew reached for it. The light roused Grace, who mumbled sleepily, "Who's calling so late?"

"It's Evelyn," Andrew answered with a frown. "What's wrong?"

Evelyn Carter's excited voice came through the phone. "Dad! Come out and see the shooting stars! A really bright one just streaked across the sky!"

Grace turned over drowsily. "You two go ahead... I'm too tired..."

Andrew pulled on his jacket, pausing to reassure her. "Rest well. If I see another, I'll take a picture for you."

As he stepped out of the tent, he nearly bumped into Emily Anderson rubbing her eyes.

"Dad, Evelyn said there's a meteor shower, but I can't stay awake," Emily yawned. "I'm going back to sleep with Mom."

Andrew looked up at the starry expanse—no trace of any meteors. In that instant, he understood his daughter's true intention.

Emily started to leave but suddenly froze. The mountain breeze brushed past, jolting her awake as realization dawned belatedly.

Andrew forced himself to the edge of the campsite, where two figures emerged from behind the trees.

Alexander Hamilton handed him medication, murmuring an apology. "Uncle Andrew, I'm sorry..."

Accepting the pills, Andrew's gaze fell on Evelyn's swollen, red-rimmed eyes. He sighed softly. "Silly girl, why cry like this?"

"Dad..." Evelyn's voice trembled. "Just take the medicine first."

The three walked deeper into the woods without another word. Moonlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground.

Beneath an old locust tree, Andrew stopped.

"This was your idea, wasn't it?" He looked at Alexander.

Alexander nodded. "Evelyn was worried about you."

Evelyn's hands shook slightly as she held out a thermos. "Dad, please take your medicine now."

"Alright, alright." Andrew swallowed the pills with warm water, forcing lightness into his tone. "Just a stomachache. Nothing serious."

As the medication took effect, the tension in his spine eased slightly.

Alexander suggested, "Tomorrow, I'll take you back to the hospital."

"No need." Andrew waved him off. "It's rare for the family to have this time together. Don't ruin it."

Evelyn could no longer hold back—tears spilled over. "This isn't just a stomachache! You know it's—"

"Evelyn." Andrew gently wiped her cheeks. "At my age, I've made peace with things. Better to leave the money for the family than waste it at the hospital."

The night wind rustled through the treetops.

"Just listen to me this once..." Evelyn gripped her father's hand. "Just this once..."

Andrew gazed at his daughter's tear-streaked face, his throat working. "My dear child, you've been my greatest pride in this life. This time... let me have my way, alright?"

His voice grew softer. "Perhaps... it's the last time."
###Chapter 625: Just Worried About You

Evelyn's tears burst forth like a dam breaking.

She clutched her father's rough hands, her voice shattered beyond recognition. "Dad, let's get treatment abroad. I have money now—real money..."

Andrew Anderson shook his head gently, his gaze shifting past her to Alexander. "Alex, this old man has no regrets...except worrying about my Evelyn."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed as he spoke in a low voice. "Mr. Anderson, I've contacted specialists at MD Anderson Cancer Center."

"No need." Andrew waved a frail hand. "These old bones can't take the journey."

The forest breeze stilled abruptly.

Evelyn's quiet sobs cut through the unnatural silence.

"Dad..." She bit her lower lip until copper bloomed on her tongue. "You haven't seen me in a wedding dress yet."

Andrew's laugh crinkled the corners of his eyes. "Silly girl, I'll watch from heaven."

Alexander turned away, knuckles whitening around clenched fists.

"Mr. Anderson, the private jet stands ready." His voice roughened. "Just say the word."

Andrew patted his daughter's trembling shoulder. "Evelyn, I've lived fully. Marrying your mother, having you and Emily—that's enough."

Evelyn jerked upright, vision blurred. "So you'd just leave us?"

"Not by choice." Andrew sighed. "Fate's decree."

A brittle snap echoed from the trees.

Emily stood frozen behind an oak, face bloodless. "Dad...Evelyn...what are you talking about?"

The air crystallized.

Evelyn scrubbed at her cheeks, only for more tears to fall.

"Emily..." Andrew's voice trembled. "You heard?"

Emily stumbled forward, seizing Evelyn's arm. "Evelyn, Dad's joking, right?"

Alexander retreated silently, granting the family space.

"Emily." Evelyn drew a shuddering breath. "Dad has..."

"Stage four lung cancer." Andrew finished bluntly. "Doctors say it's metastasized."

Emily's tears fell like rain. "Impossible! You made me chicken soup last week—"

"That's why I want more time with you both." Andrew wiped his youngest's cheeks. "No crying. Breaks this old man's heart."

Evelyn surged to her feet. "I'll take leave. Stay with you every second."

"Nonsense!" Andrew frowned. "The company just stabilized—what kind of example is that?"

"I can work remotely—"

"Evelyn." Andrew cut her off. "My greatest pride is having a daughter like you. Don't let me go with regrets."

Emily collapsed against her father, wailing.

In the shadows, Alexander watched Evelyn's ramrod-straight back. An invisible fist squeezed his heart.

"Mr. Anderson." He stepped forward. "I'll protect them."

Andrew looked up, rheumy eyes glistening. "Alex, I trust you."

A falling leaf spiraled onto Evelyn's shoulder.

She caught it in her palm—icy against her skin.
###Chapter 626: You Don't Love Me, But You Need Me

Emily's pupils constricted sharply.

She stared at her father's face, searching for any trace of a joke. But the heaviness in Andrew's eyes pressed down on her like a boulder, stealing her breath.

"Dad..." Her voice trembled. "You're lying, aren't you?"

Andrew's eyes reddened. He reached out to touch her head but stopped midair, settling for a gentle hand on her shoulder instead.

"Emily, when have I ever lied to you?"

Tears burst forth like a dam breaking. She threw herself into her father's arms, sobbing like a child robbed of candy.

Andrew's hands shook. He remembered his youngest daughter crying just like this when she was born. Back then, he could pat her swaddled form and say, "Daddy's here." Now, even that simple promise was beyond him.

"Stop crying." Evelyn's voice was soft but firm. She reached for her sister with ice-cold fingertips.

Emily jerked away, her cries growing louder.

Andrew took a deep breath. "Listen to me, Emily." His tone turned stern. "Your mother doesn't know yet. You must help me keep this from her."

The words doused Emily like cold water. She looked up through her tears, seeing the moonlight glint silver off her father's graying temples.

"Dad..." She hiccuped. "I'm scared..."

Tears finally spilled down Andrew's cheeks. His rough hands wiped her face. "Silly girl, don't I look perfectly fine now?"

Evelyn turned away. The night wind lifted her hair, hiding her red-rimmed eyes.

"It's getting late." Andrew released his daughter. "I'll walk Emily back. You two..." He glanced at Alexander, hesitating.

Alexander gave a slight nod.

Emily clung to her father's sleeve like a lifeline. Their figures gradually disappeared into the night as Evelyn stood frozen in place.

"Cry if you need to." Alexander's voice came from behind her.

Evelyn shook her head. Her nails dug into her palms, but she felt no pain.

"He hasn't..." Her voice was barely audible. "...held Emily's hand like that in years."

Silently, Alexander draped his jacket over her shoulders. The night dew was heavy, and her body trembled.

"You were right." Evelyn suddenly laughed, the sound uglier than tears. "I do need you now."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "I know."

"This isn't fair."

"Feelings never are." His gaze drifted into the distance. "Just like the debt I owe you—one I can never repay."

Evelyn looked up. The stars burned bright tonight, yet her world was crumbling.

"Alexander," she whispered. "If this is a transaction, you're getting the short end."

He smiled. "I don't mind."

Light from the distant campsite cast tangled shadows at their feet.

The next morning, Evelyn examined her reflection in the tent mirror. The woman staring back was pale, with only faint redness lingering at the corners of her eyes.

She took a deep breath and unzipped the tent.

Emily stood nearby, holding toiletries. The sisters locked eyes without speaking. But Evelyn understood the resolve in her sister's gaze—they would protect this secret together.

At breakfast, Grace chattered excitedly about last night's meteor shower.

"Missed it." Evelyn stirred her porridge. "Some things vanish too quickly to catch."

Margaret looked at her son in confusion. "Why didn't anyone wake me?"

Alexander remained impassive. "You were sleeping too soundly."

Andrew suddenly spoke up. "Grace, let's go hiking today." His gaze softened impossibly. "Consider it... making up for our honeymoon."

Grace blushed instantly. "You old fool, the children are right here."

Evelyn's chopsticks creaked in her grip. Watching her parents exchange smiles, her throat tightened as if stuffed with cotton.

Sunlight bathed the breakfast table, illuminating everyone's flawless smiles. Only Evelyn knew—this was the calm before the storm.
###Chapter 627 Family Portrait

Andrew Anderson rubbed his nose, his ears turning slightly pink. "Just wanted to see you happy."

The usually reserved man rarely spoke such tender words.

Grace Anderson's cheeks flushed as she fiddled with her sleeve. "At our age, hiking seems too much. I saw kites and fishing rods at the campsite. Let's try something new like the youngsters."

"I'll borrow them." Andrew stood abruptly.

They exchanged awkward glances.

Alexander Hamilton smoothly intervened. "Uncle, Auntie, please rest. I'll handle the arrangements."

Evelyn Carter frowned. "Fishing gear from the hotel is easy, but kites might be hard to find."

"I'll check the children's area," Alexander mused. "If necessary, we'll buy one."

"At this hour, there may not be kids playing. Even if there are, parents might not sell." Evelyn bit her lip. "I'll get the fishing gear. You arrange for a kite from the city."

"Agreed."

Margaret Hamilton watched their seamless coordination, laugh lines crinkling at her eyes. "No rush. Take your time."

Evelyn clenched her fists. With her father's limited time, how could she not hurry?

Emily Anderson poked listlessly at her breakfast. As she rose to help, Andrew discreetly pressed her wrist down.

Grace gazed at her daughter and Alexander walking away together, her expression softening. Emily quickly gathered dishes, avoiding her mother's perceptive gaze.

"The children have grown more thoughtful lately," Grace murmured.

Andrew swallowed painkillers, his gaze distant. "Our girls have always been good."

Evelyn soon returned with fishing gear. Alexander arrived breathless, holding a kite aloft.

Grace fumbled with the kite string while Margaret fluttered around trying to assist. The kite wobbled drunkenly in the air.

"Let me." Andrew took over, jogging alongside his wife. Within steps, sweat beaded on his forehead, yet he refused to stop.

Evelyn watched her father's unsteady figure, nails digging into her palms.

"I brought a camera," Alexander said quietly. "Let's take photos for Uncle and Auntie. And a family portrait with Emily."

He always knew the perfect thing to say.

Mountain winds rustled the trees as the kite soared steadily against the blue sky. Andrew and Grace sat side by side on the grass, their silhouettes leaning together like young lovers.

"Let's fish by the stream," Andrew said, brushing off his pants. "We can picnic there."

Margaret eagerly prepared lunch while Alexander made multiple trips carrying picnic supplies.

Emily accepted the camera with red-rimmed eyes. Evelyn squeezed her sister's hand. "Take more photos of Mom and Dad."

The babbling stream reflected sunlight, illuminating every smiling face. Grace and Margaret posed on rocks with silk scarves. Andrew, who usually avoided cameras, now stood willingly before the lens.

"Is this spot okay?" he asked his wife with a smile.

Before Grace could answer, she gasped. Andrew slipped, swaying unsteadily.

"What's wrong?" Grace rushed to steady him. "You've been distracted these past days."

Evelyn watched from afar, her throat tight. Alexander silently draped a cardigan over her shoulders, its comforting weight grounding her.

"Dad used to hate photos," she whispered. "Now he poses however Mom wants."

The stream mirrored the sky's radiance, making every smile glow. Evelyn wished time could freeze this moment forever.
###Chapter 628 The Last Family Portrait

Andrew Anderson pressed a trembling hand to his chest, suppressing the dull ache radiating through his ribs. "I'm fine," he managed a smile. "Just happy to see everyone together."

Grace Anderson looped her arm through his, crow's feet crinkling at her eyes. "Once Emily graduates, we'll have all the time in the world for family trips."

There would be no "after" for him.

Andrew's throat tightened as he noticed the silver strands threading through his wife's hair. He averted his gaze casually. "Yes, you should travel more after this."

Evelyn Carter caught the odd inflection in her father's voice. She quickly raised the camera. "Closer, Mom and Dad. The lighting's perfect here."

Grace immediately adjusted their pose. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling their faces with golden patterns. Andrew's smile glowed with unusual tenderness in the speckled light.

"Evelyn," he suddenly beckoned, "let's take a proper family portrait."

Alexander Hamilton wordlessly took the camera. Through the lens, Andrew stood ramrod straight, as if committing every detail to memory through sheer willpower.

"When will these be developed?" Grace asked excitedly, scrolling through the previews.

Alexander glanced at Andrew's ashen complexion. "I'll have the resort expedite them. We'll get the prints tonight."

"Let's take one more." Andrew's voice was firm. "Alexander, invite your mother to join us."

In his limited time, he needed to see his daughter embraced by a complete family.

Evelyn bit her lip hard to stop the tears. Alexander set the timer and swiftly moved beside her. When the shutter clicked, she felt her father's hand settle gently on her shoulder.

Back at the resort, Anthony and Teresa Taylor were already waiting in the private dining room. The space smelled of medicinal herbs, and Teresa's complexion had noticeably improved.

"The mountain air does wonders," she said, serving Grace a portion of braised lamb. "You should extend your stay."

Andrew barely touched his food, his hidden hand trembling violently beneath the table. The painkillers were wearing off, and cold sweat soaked through his shirt.

"Some warm soup," Grace suggested worriedly, watching her husband's pallor. "It'll help with the chill."

As the server presented the clay pot, Evelyn noticed her father's fingers had turned bluish. Before she could speak, a dull thud silenced the room.

Andrew collapsed beside the table, sending the soup bowl shattering across the floor.

"Andrew!" Grace's scream pierced the air.

Alexander was already dialing as he sprinted forward. "Prep the emergency route—patient en route now!"

Evelyn dropped to her knees, checking for a pulse. The faint flutter beneath her fingertips nearly stopped her own heart. She looked up to see her mother clutching her mouth, fat tears rolling down her cheeks.

The SUV tore through the night. In the backseat, Andrew's breathing grew shallower with each passing mile. Evelyn clutched his icy hand, chanting like a prayer: "Hold on, we're almost at the hospital..."

The ER doors reflected her ghostly face. When the resuscitation lights flickered on, Evelyn finally crumpled onto the waiting bench. The antiseptic sting in her nostrils triggered a sudden memory—her father kneeling to tie her sneaker laces that very morning.

"Dad..."

Scalding tears splashed onto her bloodstained hands. Down the corridor, Grace's staggering figure appeared, half-supported by Emily as they rushed toward the ICU.
###Chapter 629: I'm the Patient's Son-in-Law

Evelyn's legs suddenly gave out beneath her.

Alexander caught her before she could collapse, his arms tightening around her trembling form.

"Evelyn..." His voice was low and controlled, yet his grip spoke volumes. "I'm here."

Her lashes fluttered violently as her fingers dug into the sleeves of his suit. She tried to stand, but even lifting her head seemed impossible.

Alexander pulled her closer. "Don't force yourself."

The waiting room bench was just steps away, but Evelyn remained rooted in place. She pressed her forehead against his chest, shoulders shaking uncontrollably.

When the first tear soaked through his shirt, Alexander felt her fists clench tighter in the fabric.

The dam broke. Sobs she'd held back for days tore from her throat as she clung to him like a lost child.

Medical staff passing through the corridor cast sympathetic glances, but Alexander turned, shielding her completely from view.

Her cries grew hoarse. He remained silent, one hand cradling the back of her head as if soothing a frightened animal.

The ICU doors swung open abruptly.

A doctor emerged—Evelyn's former classmate—his white coat stained with blood. "Evelyn, you need to prepare yourself."

Her entire body went rigid.

"Mr. Anderson requires further observation in the ICU." The doctor chose his words carefully. "We'll determine treatment after additional tests."

She recognized this clinical phrasing too well. These were the same hollow reassurances she'd given countless families. Now, standing in their shoes, she understood the crushing despair behind those words.

Her fingers were ice-cold as she accepted the critical condition notice, the paper trembling in her grasp.

"I'll sign." Alexander took the pen from her hand. Under "Relationship to Patient," he wrote two decisive words: Son-in-Law.

The doctor glanced uncertainly at Evelyn.

She stared blankly toward the ICU, her eyes empty.

When Andrew was wheeled out, tubes snaking across his body, Evelyn followed like a shadow until the glass doors separated them.

Alexander returned from completing paperwork to find her pressing her forehead against the glass, a discarded doll.

"Go rest," he murmured. "I'll stay."

She shook her head, strands of hair whispering against the glass. "I'm not leaving."

He didn't argue, simply positioned himself beside her, becoming her steady support.

Frantic footsteps echoed down the corridor.

Grace Anderson stumbled forward, supported by Emily. She swayed at the sight of her husband through the glass. "Andrew...?"

"Mom—" Evelyn's voice caught.

Grace's eyes rolled back as she crumpled.

"Mom!"

Alexander sprinted for help while Emily bit her lip hard, tears falling like rain. "Sis, I'll take care of her."

Evelyn tried to follow but her legs refused to move. Watching her sister's retreating figure, she suddenly covered her face and sank to the floor.

"I promised Dad..." Her voice shattered. "I promised to protect them..."

Alexander knelt, gently prying her fingers from their death grip on her palms. "You've done everything right."

A shrill alarm pierced the air.

Evelyn's head snapped up as a nurse rushed out. "He's awake, but..." The nurse hesitated. "You should come now."

Her pupils contracted violently.

"I'll get them." Alexander took off running, his white shirt billowing behind him.

Evelyn pushed through the ICU doors to find Andrew smiling at her—that same warm smile from childhood when he'd pick her up after school.

"Dad..." She threw herself at the bedside, clutching his needle-marked hand.

His grip was warm and dry, squeezing back gently. "My Evelyn..."

The monitor's steady line began to flatten. Pressing his hand to her cheek, she remembered childhood fevers when these same fingers had soothed her forehead.
###Chapter 630 The Final Farewell

Andrew Anderson's gentle gaze rested on Evelyn's face, his wrinkled eyes brimming with pride. "Evelyn, my greatest joy in life was having a daughter like you. Whenever I told my old friends about you getting into medical school, their envy was palpable..."

His voice cracked, yet he managed a smile. "Am I being vain? But I just couldn't help it—my girl is extraordinary."

Evelyn tried to smile back, but tears blurred her vision the moment her lips trembled upward.

"Silly child..." Andrew sighed softly. "I have no regrets. Seeing all of you by my side in these final days is more than enough. It's just you I worry about..."

With effort, he raised his hand, brushing her hair as he had when she was little. "You're always taking care of others. Don't forget you deserve care too."

"Dad—" Evelyn collapsed against him, sobbing uncontrollably.

"Don't cry," Andrew whispered, his voice fading. "You're a doctor. You understand... this comes for everyone. I'm at peace. Only you... don't overwork yourself..."

His words halted abruptly, a choked sound escaping his throat.

The hospital door creaked open.

Alexander Hamilton stood silently in the doorway, anguish burning in his eyes. He stepped aside as Emily pushed Grace Anderson's wheelchair into the room.

Grace's face was ashen, her lips trembling. "Andrew! You liar! Why didn't you tell me sooner—"

Andrew looked at his wife's gaunt face, guilt flooding his expression. "Grace, forgive me... I just... couldn't bear to see you suffer..."

"You fool!" Grace seized his hand, tears splashing onto the sheets. "All these years with you—never once did I regret it! This is my fault... I should've noticed—"

Andrew stroked her hand gently, then turned to his younger daughter.

Emily fought back tears, her voice shaking. "Dad, I remember everything... I'll study hard, take care of Mom and Evelyn..."

"My good girl..." Andrew placed his daughters' hands together. "Support each other... Emily, be wise. Evelyn... don't always shoulder everything alone..."

The room echoed with muffled weeping.

Alexander stood motionless nearby, his gaze resolute.

"Alexander..." Andrew suddenly called.

Alexander stepped forward immediately. "Mr. Anderson."

"This family... I leave to you."

"You have my word."

Andrew seemed to relax at the promise, his focus drifting. "Time to go... someone's come for me..."

Evelyn's heart clenched. "Dad?"

"Why is it a little girl...?" Andrew murmured toward the empty corner, his tone softening. "Such a pretty dress... where are your parents?"

His expression brightened suddenly. "Ah... you're here for Grandpa... alright, Grandpa will go with you..."

Evelyn and Alexander instinctively looked where Andrew gazed—there was nothing.

Yet they knew.

A child... Grandpa...

Alexander's fingers clenched into fists.

Evelyn's breath caught.

If only... another world truly existed.

Andrew reached toward the void, a tender smile gracing his face. "Come, let Grandpa hold you—"

His hand fell abruptly. His eyes closed slowly, the smile lingering.

"Dad!" Evelyn grabbed his lifeless hand—the strong, warm hand that would never comfort her again.

No longer would anyone rush to her defense when she was wronged.

No longer would anyone press a lifetime's savings into her palm, urging, "Use this for school."

No longer would anyone kneel at the kindergarten gates, arms open wide, waiting for her to run into them.

"Evelyn!"

Alexander caught her swaying body. "Evelyn, look at me!"

She stared blankly, her mother and sister's wails ringing in her ears.

But her tears had dried. Instead, a memory surfaced—twenty years past—

A tiny Evelyn clutching her father's sleeve, whispering fearfully about not wanting to go to school.

Instead of scolding, he'd bought her a colorful balloon and bent to tell the teacher, "Our girl... she's shy. Please be patient with her..."

When the teacher reached to pat her head, she'd flinched away.

Her father crouched down, straightening her collar gently. "Be brave, Evelyn. I'll be the first to pick you up after school."

Finally, she'd released his hand and followed the teacher inside. Glancing back, she'd watched his tall figure retreat...

Had it really been twenty years?
###Chapter 631: I'm Here, I'm With You

The hospital room echoed with heart-wrenching sobs.

Evelyn jolted awake to find her father's body already covered with a white sheet, being wheeled out by nurses.

In her dazed state, she saw flashes of her childhood self chasing after her father—running through the years until she became the woman she was today.

"Dad! Wait for me..."

But this time, her father didn't turn back.

"Evelyn! Wake up!"

Alexander's voice pulled her from the nightmare.

She opened her eyes to his exhausted face. His chapped lips betrayed how long he'd been keeping vigil.

"Where's my dad?" Her fingers dug into his arm.

Alexander spoke softly, "Mr. Anderson passed peacefully. He was smiling."

Evelyn's hands clenched the sheets as silent tears fell.

When her breathing steadied, he continued, "Grace fainted from crying. Emily's taking care of her. The funeral home... I told them to wait."

He hesitated, unsure whether to ask if she wanted to see him one last time.

Evelyn nodded blankly, unresponsive to anything.

Alexander watched her, remembering how shattered she'd been after losing their child. His heart ached.

"You barely touched dinner. I had someone bring congee—"

"Did Mom and Emily eat?"

"It's been taken care of."

He lifted a spoonful to her lips. "Just a little."

Evelyn opened her mouth mechanically but gagged after the first swallow.

"Alexander..." Her face was streaked with tears.

"I'm here."

"I can't eat."

He set aside the bowl and offered water instead. "Some water, then?"

She managed two sips before bolting to the bathroom to vomit.

Alexander followed, rubbing her back gently.

Back at the bedside, he knelt to adjust her slippers. Evelyn remained limp, letting him move her like a marionette.

"Evelyn," he murmured, "let it out."

She turned her head slowly.

"I'm right here with you."

"Alexander..."

"Yes?"

"I don't have a father anymore..."

She collapsed against him, wailing.

His shoulder grew damp with her tears. When exhaustion finally claimed her, he carefully shifted to cradle her more comfortably.

That night, Evelyn drifted between sleep and weeping until dawn.

Days later, the funeral home called.
###Chapter 632 The Final Farewell

Alexander Hamilton answered the call with Evelyn Carter standing beside him.

He kept his voice low, responding only with brief "mm-hmms."

Though Evelyn had cried herself dry these past few days, she could still sense the gravity from that call.

Her heart felt like it was being sawed apart by a blunt knife, yet her eyes remained painfully dry.

After hanging up, Alexander slowly knelt before her, taking her icy hands. "About your father... With the warmer weather, we can't delay any longer. If you need time, I can arrange for the morgue—"

The word "morgue" stabbed Evelyn like a needle.

Her father had hated loneliness in life—how could she leave him in such a cold, desolate place?

"Today," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Alexander swallowed hard. "...This afternoon."

"Okay." Evelyn turned toward the hospital room. "Wait outside. I need to change."

She couldn't let her father see her like this—haggard and broken.

Their assistant Daisy had already brought fresh clothes. Evelyn chose the simplest black dress, washed her face, and opened the door.

Alexander immediately steadied her swaying figure.

"I'm fine," she murmured faintly. "Just... my legs won't cooperate."

Suddenly, she was lifted into his arms.

His embrace was warm and secure. Pressed against his chest, she listened to his steady heartbeat.

The car moved smoothly, the scenery drifting past the windows.

"Margaret and my mother are already there," Alexander said softly. "Daisy picked up Grace and Emily too."

Evelyn gazed at the distant rolling hills. "How's Mom holding up?"

"Grace is... struggling. Emily's being strong for everyone."

At the funeral home entrance, Margaret Hamilton stood waiting in solemn black.

Seeing Evelyn's pallid face, she pulled her into a tearful hug. "My dear child..."

Evelyn trembled in her arms.

The midday sun glared harshly, yet couldn't penetrate the cold lodged deep in her bones.

The memorial hall was arranged simply yet warmly.

The scent of jasmine tea lingered in the air. Potted osmanthus bloomed vibrantly—as if her father had merely stepped out for a stroll and would return any moment.

Her fingers shook as she reached for the portrait.

The cold glass made her flinch back.

"This photo..." She stared at her father's kind smile.

"Cropped from your hot springs trip," Alexander explained quietly. "I thought he'd prefer to be remembered like this."

In the picture, her father's eyes crinkled with laughter—captured in his most relaxed, joyful moment.

Margaret gently squeezed her shoulder. "Light some incense for your dad."

Blue smoke curled from the burner.

Kneeling on the cushion, Evelyn finally broke—tears falling as she faced that beloved smile.

"Dad..."
###Chapter 633 The Final Farewell

Evelyn Carter accepted the incense stick from Alexander Hamilton, her fingertips trembling slightly. She lit the incense and bowed deeply three times before her father's portrait.

Thin wisps of smoke curled upward from the burner, lingering before the black-and-white photograph.

The funeral hall was so silent you could hear breathing. The staff had tactfully retreated to give the grieving family space.

The sound of wheelchair wheels approached. Anthony Taylor pushed Teresa Taylor forward, their faces etched with unconcealed concern.

"Thank you," Evelyn's voice was feather-light. "These are things I should be doing myself."

Her nails dug into her palms through the fabric of her clothes. The thought of others handling her father's final arrangements was excruciating.

Teresa clasped Evelyn's icy hand. "If your father could see you now, it would break his heart. We can never repay what we owe him."

Anthony's eyes reddened. "I thought we'd be friends for life. Who knew..." His voice cracked.

The staff member knocked gently. "It's time. A family member needs to come with me."

All eyes turned to Evelyn.

She stared at the door leading to the crematorium, her legs leaden. If she didn't go through, could she pretend her father was still here?

Alexander's hand covered hers. That always-warm hand now matched her chill.

"Should I go?" he murmured, careful not to disturb her grief.

Evelyn shook her head. Drawing a shaky breath, she rasped, "I'll see him off."

"Your mother and sister—"

"I'll inform them," Anthony interjected. "They're in the lounge. Grace Anderson hasn't woken yet."

Evelyn nodded mechanically, hollowed out.

Alexander supported her as if she were fragile porcelain. These past days had whittled her down to nearly nothing.

"They..." Evelyn spoke suddenly, "might not be able to bear seeing Dad..."

Her gaze drifted to the small viewing room. Andrew Anderson lay peacefully in his casket wearing his favorite jacket, looking as if he might wake any moment.

The man who could never sit still now lay motionless.

"Should I step out?" Alexander asked softly.

"No." Evelyn shook her head. "I've said everything I needed to."

Silence stretched. The staff member reminded gently, "My condolences, but we must proceed."

Alexander opened his mouth to request more time, but Evelyn stopped him.

"Dad hated inconveniencing people," she said quietly but firmly. "We can't let him leave uneasy."

"But Aunt Grace and—"

"Mom would collapse." Evelyn stared at her father through the glass. "Emily's too young..."

As the staff prepared to close the casket, Evelyn rushed forward. Pressing her forehead to the cold glass, she whispered:

"Be careful on your journey, Dad."
###Chapter 634: Unburdened

She stared at the door, a silent scream echoing in her heart. The words "safe travels" lingered on her lips but never escaped.

The metallic clang of the closing door cut through the silence like a knife. A red light flickered on the electronic screen beside it as the countdown began.

Evelyn's grip on the glass window faltered. The world before her twisted, colors bleeding away until only suffocating darkness remained.

"Evelyn!"

Alexander's desperate cry was the last sound she heard before plunging into the abyss.

......

Consciousness returned slowly. The soft mattress beneath her and the sharp scent of disinfectant confirmed she was in a hospital bed.

Her eyelids felt leaden. Fragmented conversations drifted to her ears.

Alexander's deep voice stood out: "...39-degree fever, low blood sugar. Dr. Lightfoot has already examined her."

Though he spoke in hushed tones, the underlying anxiety was unmistakable.

Through the fog in her mind, Evelyn pieced together scattered thoughts. How were her mother and sister now?

Voices carried from the hallway—Alexander, along with Anthony and Teresa Taylor, and Margaret Hamilton.

"My greatest regret is not finding her sooner," Anthony's voice was hoarse. "What does the company matter? I just want my daughter to be happy."

A wheelchair creaked softly. Teresa murmured, "We owe her, but this isn't the way to make amends."

"But she'll feel indebted," Alexander sighed. "That's just how she is."

"Then tell her we're getting old," Anthony said firmly. "We only want to live quietly with our daughter."

Margaret's voice suddenly interjected: "Grace insists on returning to their hometown today."

"So soon?" Teresa gasped. "Is she well enough?"

"Emily has grown up overnight," Margaret said, her voice thick. "She says she wants to put her father's mind at ease."

Anthony immediately responded, "I'll arrange for someone to accompany them."

The fractured conversation drifted into the room. Through the haze, Evelyn grasped the crucial detail—her mother and sister had already taken her father home.

The tension in her nerves dissolved all at once.

Her eyelids no longer felt so heavy, yet she kept them closed. Perhaps because, for this fleeting moment, she could finally lay down all her burdens.
###Chapter 635: She's Gone

The sharp scent of antiseptic stung Evelyn's nostrils.

She slowly opened her eyes to the sterile white ceiling and the familiar IV stand. Two large bags of medication dripped steadily through transparent tubes into her veins.

A faint prickling sensation tingled at her fingertips.

Evelyn frowned slightly, trying to read the labels on the IV bags when the door creaked open. Instinctively, she shut her eyes and steadied her breathing.

Footsteps paused beside her bed.

A calloused hand brushed against her forehead, warm and comforting, carrying a hint of cedarwood.

"The fever's gone," Alexander murmured, his voice hoarse.

Whispers rustled at the doorway. Evelyn heard Teresa's tearful plea: "Let me see Terry one more time—"

"Mom." Alexander cut her off gently. "You're still on IV fluids yourself."

The wheels of a wheelchair rolled across the floor. Anthony spoke softly, "Alexander's right. We should go. Terry will worry if she sees you like this."

Their footsteps faded.

Someone tucked the blanket around her shoulders. The mattress dipped slightly as Alexander sat down. He cradled her cold fingers, his thumb tracing circles over her knuckles.

When only a third of the IV bag remained, the door opened again.

"Mr. Hamilton?" A nurse whispered. "Dr. Lightfoot sent a foldable bed for you."

The bed frame unfolded with barely a sound. As Alexander thanked her, Evelyn caught the nurse's hushed remark: "I thought he was supposed to be a jerk..."

Night deepened.

Evelyn could feel Alexander's presence beside her. His breathing was labored, occasionally broken by suppressed coughs. Several times he rose to pour water, the glass clinking against the table.

At 3 AM, a heart-wrenching scream pierced the night.

Evelyn peeked through her lashes.

Alexander jolted awake, his first instinct to check her temperature. His shirt was crumpled, dark stubble shadowing his jaw.

The cries faded into the distance.

He exhaled in relief and turned toward the bed—

Only to find neatly folded sheets.

A note lay on the pillow.

His hands trembled as he unfolded it.

[Don't look for me.]

The fish congee in the thermal container had gone cold, a film of oil congealing on its surface. Dawn light crept through the window, bleaching the empty bed stark white.
###Chapter 636: She Wanted to See No One

"Evelyn!"

Alexander Hamilton shot up from his chair, his voice laced with panic. His eyes darted around the empty hospital room. The bathroom door stood wide open, revealing no one inside.

He raked a hand through his disheveled hair, his eyes red-rimmed as he bolted into the hallway. Visitors carrying breakfast trays glanced curiously at the well-dressed man who looked utterly distraught.

"Have you seen a young female doctor?" Alexander rasped, stopping a nurse.

When she shook her head, he spun toward the elevators. Impatient with the wait, he shoved open the emergency stairwell door and took the steps two at a time. His dress shoes echoed sharply against the concrete as he nearly tripped on a landing, ignoring the scraped palm he got from breaking his fall.

The morning mist still clung to the hospital garden where a few elderly patients practiced tai chi. Alexander gasped for air, the metallic tang of blood rising in his throat. "Excuse me," he stopped a morning walker, "have you seen a young woman in a white coat?"

The negative answer made him remember something. He turned on his heel and sprinted toward the outpatient building.

The door to Olivia Lightfoot's office crashed open with a bang. The young doctor dropped her patient files in shock as Alexander appeared, sweat-drenched and wild-eyed.

"Has Evelyn been here?" His voice sounded like gravel.

Olivia set down her clipboard with a sigh. "She's gone."

Alexander swayed, bracing himself against the doorframe—the same one he'd damaged not long ago.

"She asked me to tell you," Olivia handed him a water glass, "she needs time alone."

His knuckles turned white around the cup. "Where did she go?"

"She didn't say." Olivia shook her head. "But she was very clear—don't look for her."

The office clock's ticking filled the silence. Alexander suddenly realized Evelyn might never have slept last night. She'd simply waited with closed eyes until he drifted off before slipping away.

He pulled out his phone and dialed Grace Anderson. After endless rings, Emily Anderson's tearful voice answered.

"Alex?"

"How's your mother?" His voice trembled.

"Just fell asleep." Emily sniffled. "Evelyn called this morning... said she's going away..."

Alexander's stomach dropped. He tightened his grip on the phone. "Did she say where?"

"No." Another sniff. "Just told us not to worry."

Back in the empty hospital room, sunlight streamed through the curtains but couldn't dispel the chill.

After instructing his assistant about hospital matters, Alexander drove straight to Hamilton Group. His secretary Emily Zade took one look at his ashen face. "Should we send someone to—"

"No." He cut her off. "Let her have her space."

He opened a file, forcing himself to work. But his pen hovered over the paper, unable to form a single word. Finally, he set it down and walked to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The city pulsed below, traffic flowing like blood through veins.

Yet somewhere out there, his Evelyn was gone.
###Chapter 637: A Story That Feels Familiar

Time seemed to stand still in the rolling hills of the Midwest.

The weathered clinic building stood at the village entrance, its military-green wooden door creaking in the wind. Sunlight filtered through the peeling walls, casting dappled shadows on the concrete floor.

In the outpatient hall, a few feverish villagers were hooked up to IV drips. The nurses, enjoying a rare moment of leisure, gathered in small groups to bask in the sun.

"Last time we said it was quiet, and that very night we got five food poisoning cases," the older nurse muttered, rubbing her hands nervously.

"Don't jinx it!" a younger nurse quickly interrupted.

The elderly doctor squinted at the distant mountains. "Days like these are good. It means our people are healthy."

In the corner, a faded lounge chair held a figure in a white coat, a slender wrist peeking out from the sleeve. A novel covered her face, its gilded title—The Priceless Bride—glinting in the sunlight.

"Dr. Carter?" A young nurse tiptoed closer.

The figure stirred, the book sliding off to reveal delicate features. Evelyn Carter rubbed her eyes as sunlight danced on her lashes.

"That book..." The nurse's eyes lit up at the cover. "You like romance novels too?"

Evelyn glanced down at the book in her hands. On the cover, a sharply suited CEO gazed lovingly at his bride. Her fingers paused for a fraction of a second.

"Just using it to block the sun," she said lightly, closing the book. "What's it about?"

"It's amazing!" The nurse leaned in eagerly. "The leads marry first, then fall in love—but then his unattainable love comes back from abroad..."

Evelyn's smile froze. The plot felt unnervingly familiar.

A sudden roar of a motorized rickshaw cut through the air. A sun-darkened man jumped out, cradling a pale, trembling pregnant woman.

"Doctor! My wife's in labor!"

Evelyn sprang into action. The woman's pants were soaked, amniotic fluid dripping down her legs onto the ground.

"Wheelchair! Now!" Her voice was sharp with command.

The sunlight still shone brightly, but the novel now lay forgotten on the bench. The CEO on the cover smiled gently, as if watching over something unseen.
###Chapter 638: Her New Life

The young nurse was engrossed in a romance novel when the commotion in the hallway startled her. She sprang up and quickly wheeled over a chair.

The burly man wiped his sweaty brow as his wife finally sat down. His voice trembled as he asked the elderly doctor, "Last month at the city hospital, they said she had over forty days left. How did this happen so suddenly? Is this considered premature?"

The old doctor examined the laboring woman, his brow furrowed. "She's already four centimeters dilated. Transferring her now is out of the question. Our facilities are limited, but we'll do our best to deliver the baby here."

Panic flashed across the man's face, his rough hands shaking. "The city's three hours away! My wife can't wait that long!"

The elderly doctor glanced at the woman, who was drenched in sweat from the pain, and made a quick decision. "Dr. Carter, your records indicate you're an OB-GYN?"

Evelyn Carter had already slipped on gloves. "Let me assess her first. Her contractions are irregular, and the baby's position seems off. Immediate intervention is necessary."

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. The rural clinic lacked proper delivery equipment, and the operating room's sparse supplies were unsettling.

"We can't perform a C-section here," the old doctor murmured. "If this turns into a complicated birth..."

Evelyn adjusted the fetal monitor. "I'll attempt manual repositioning."

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled the air. The woman dug her nails into the sheets but managed to ask weakly, "Doctor... will my baby be okay?"

Evelyn leaned down and grasped her trembling hand. "Your husband is right outside. Your whole family is waiting for you both to come through this safely."

At 3:17 AM, a loud cry pierced the night.

"Eight pounds, two ounces—a healthy boy." Evelyn placed the wrinkled newborn in his mother's arms. "He couldn't wait to meet you."

The woman smiled weakly, tears slipping into her hairline.

Cheers erupted outside. The grandmother barged in, eager. "Let me see my grandson!" Her calloused fingers reached for the baby's face.

Evelyn shifted to block her. "Newborns have weak immune systems. Please wash and sanitize first."

The father shuffled closer, his dark face flushed. "Doctor... can I hold him?"

Evelyn demonstrated how to support the infant's head and neck. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the mother turning her face away silently.

"Sir, there are some things we need to discuss privately." She guided him into the hallway and lowered her voice. "Your wife's emotional state isn't stable. She needs your support."

He blinked. "But she seems fine. My mother says all women go through this after childbirth..."

"Postpartum depression isn't a trivial matter," Evelyn cut in firmly. "Right now, she needs her husband's care more than anything."

From inside the room, the grandmother's loud voice carried: "Look at that forehead—destined for greatness! When will your mother arrive? She must see her grandson!"

Through the glass, Evelyn saw the new mother biting the corner of the blanket, tears streaming silently down her cheeks.
###Chapter 639: A Long-Overdue Gesture

The burly farmer now regarded Dr. Evelyn Carter with immense respect. He quickly handed the newborn to a relative and followed her into the hallway.

Evelyn stood by the window, sunlight filtering through the glass to cast dappled patterns across her white coat.

"I heard your wife's family won't arrive until tomorrow," she said gently. "The delivery took a heavy toll on her body. She'll need extra care during postpartum recovery."

The farmer nodded vigorously, rough fingers unconsciously twisting his shirt hem. "Don't worry, Doctor. My wife's our family's hero. I'll make sure she gets everything she needs."

His tone was sincere, though the day's chaos and his simple nature had kept him from immediately checking on his wife.

Evelyn gave a slight nod, glancing toward the ward. "A new life is cause for celebration. It's natural for everyone to focus on the baby. But your wife just went through a life-threatening ordeal. Right now, she needs her husband's attention most."

The man froze, dark complexion flushing with shame. Memories surfaced of his pregnant wife toiling in the fields despite her swollen belly. His eyes reddened instantly.

"You're right, Doctor." His voice cracked. "My wife's suffered too much for this family. I'll go to her right now."

Evelyn watched him hurry back to the ward.

The farmer went straight to the hospital bed and seized his wife's pale hand.

"Sweetheart, I was wrong." His hands trembled. "You've endured so much. From now on, I'll handle all the chores and night feedings. You just focus on recovering."

The exhausted mother's dull eyes gradually moistened.

"You'll name the baby." Awkwardly wiping her tears, he added, "You're the boss of this family now."

Those words shattered her composure. She clung to her husband and sobbed uncontrollably.

The grandmother rushed over with the swaddled infant. "What's wrong? Is it the incision pain? Oh heavens, I nearly forgot the chicken soup!"

Relatives rummaged through cloth bags, producing thermal containers. When opened, the rich aroma of broth filled the ward.

As the farmer blew on a spoonful to cool it, his wife shook her head. "Did you thank the doctor? If not for Dr. Carter, our baby and I would've—"

Evelyn quickly intervened. "Please, it was the entire medical team's effort."

"I heard everything in the delivery room," the new mother insisted. "You risked using a special technique to save us."

Only then understanding the danger they'd faced, the farmer turned to kneel before Evelyn. "Doctor, you're our family's savior—"

Evelyn recoiled in alarm. "No! Please get up!"

Seeing this, the grandmother pulled a crumpled red envelope from her pocket, trying to stuff it into Evelyn's coat.

"I can't accept this!" Evelyn firmly pushed it away. "You've already paid the medical fees."

An older doctor appeared just then, rescuing her. "Dr. Carter's been working all night. Let her rest."

The simple country family finally made way, watching as Evelyn left.

Her dormitory was a modest single-story house with peeling plaster walls. Too exhausted to even wash up, Evelyn collapsed onto her bed in the dark.

When morning light filtered through the curtains, three young nurses were tidying their quarters nearby.

"How's the patient?" Evelyn asked, rubbing her temples as she sat up.

"Recovering well," answered a ponytailed nurse. "But she needs a few more days of observation."

"Her family?"

"The grandmother took relatives home to prepare the house. Only the husband stayed."

Just as Evelyn sighed in relief, a knock sounded at the door.
###Chapter 640: An Offer Too Sincere to Refuse

The village clinic's dormitory was surrounded by locals.

The nurse froze when she opened the door. "What's all this...?"

The new mother's mother-in-law stood at the front, clutching old-fashioned aluminum lunchboxes. She immediately recognized Evelyn and the night shift nurses, rushing forward.

"Dr. Carter, I cooked some dishes for you. You've been working nonstop since yesterday—you must be starving."

She stepped aside, revealing the village chief and party secretary behind her.

Both elderly men had silver hair but treated the young medical staff with deep respect.

"We'd heard city doctors were coming to help, but never expected such skill."

"Our village has lovely scenery. You should visit when you're free..."

The chief extended a slab of cured meat. "From our own pigs. A small taste of home."

The nurse waved her hands. "We can't accept this. Hospital regulations—"

Evelyn observed the earnest villagers from the back. Most were elderly, their eyes filled with gratitude.

Seeing the refusal, the chief insisted, "Just some homegrown things. Nothing valuable."

"Only a few eggs..."
"Fresh-picked greens..."

The murmurs rose like a tide.

The nurses glanced helplessly at Evelyn.

Someone whispered, "I told you city doctors wouldn't want our simple food..."

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "We'll accept this once. But it can't happen again."

Relief washed over the crowd as they pressed gifts into the nurses' hands. Soon, the young women stood arms full.

Evelyn carefully took the fragile eggs and cured meat. Only then did the villagers disperse contentedly.

The mother-in-law lingered, offering a final container. "Special chicken soup for you. Drink it hot."

The nurses surveyed the rustic bounty covering their table. "How will we ever finish all this?"

Evelyn suggested, "Take it to the clinic. Let the senior staff share it."

Outside, she found the chief waiting in the hallway.

"Dr. Carter..." The old man hesitated.

"Is something else troubling you?"

He rubbed his weathered hands. "How long...will you stay? Will more doctors come after?"

Evelyn's throat tightened. "There'll be replacements."

The elder sighed. "Last team left within days. Villagers needing care..."

His clouded eyes brimmed with worry. "Especially the pregnant women..."

Memories of her father constricted Evelyn's voice. "Early treatment is crucial."

"But the trip to town's impossible for women and children..." The chief's voice shook. "Dr. Carter, could you...stay one more month? Just until those mothers deliver safely..."

His gnarled fingers twisted his shirt hem like clutching a lifeline.
###Chapter 641: Evelyn, I've Come for You

Elder Thompson's wrinkled hand clutched Evelyn Carter's sleeve tightly. His clouded eyes brimmed with pleading. "Dr. Carter, can you really stay until year's end? Previous doctors never lasted more than a month..."

Evelyn studied the old man's hunched posture. Her heart softened. "I promise to stay at least through December."

"Wonderful!" The village elder rubbed his hands excitedly. "I'll announce the good news immediately!"

"Wait." Evelyn stopped him. "The gifts from the villagers are too generous. We can't possibly consume everything."

Elder Thompson slapped his thigh. "Then we'll present you with an honorary banner!"

"Absolutely not." Evelyn suppressed a laugh. "Everyone's good health is the greatest gift."

A pigtailed girl came sprinting toward them, breathless. "Grandpa Elder! There's a huge shiny car at the village entrance!"

The elder frowned. "Who would visit this remote place?"

"The man's so handsome!" The child gestured wildly. "Even prettier than TV stars!"

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

"Dr. Carter, you've seen the world." Elder Thompson entreated. "Would you accompany me? Perhaps it's an investor..."

Evelyn nodded faintly.

As they walked, she casually asked the girl, "What color was the car?"

"White!" The child skipped ahead. "With a jumping horse emblem!"

Evelyn's steps faltered.

Of course.

The village entrance swarmed with spectators. At the center, Alexander Hamilton stood besieged by children. Muddy handprints smeared his tailored suit.

"Mister, your watch glows!"
"Brother, why's your tie so tight?"
"Uncle, your shoes shine like mirrors!"

Alexander floundered under the onslaught. Then he looked up—and locked eyes with Evelyn's amused gaze.

She stood at the crowd's edge in a dirt-streaked white coat, hands in pockets. Sunlight gilded her silhouette.

"Alexander." She tilted her head slightly. "Looking for me?"
###Chapter 642: Reunion

Evelyn Carter stood at the entrance of the rural clinic, watching from a distance as a familiar figure was surrounded by a group of children. His expensive suit was covered in tiny handprints, and his usually immaculate hair was slightly disheveled.

Alexander Hamilton seemed to sense something and suddenly turned around.

Their eyes met. A flicker of panic flashed in his gaze before it melted into a relieved smile.

"Mm."

Elder Thompson hurried forward, eyeing the distinguished young man. "Shoo, shoo, don't block the way."

The children scattered like startled birds.

"I'm the village elder. May I ask who you are—"

"Hello." Alexander was impeccably polite. "I'm here on behalf of Hudson Central Hospital to deliver medical supplies to the clinic."

His gaze drifted past the crowd, landing squarely on Evelyn. The emotions in his eyes were too complex to name. Only when he confirmed she was unharmed did the tension in his shoulders ease slightly.

Evelyn had tanned a little, but her spirit was bright.

Following his line of sight, Elder Thompson suddenly understood. "Ah, you're here for Dr. Carter."

The villagers exchanged knowing, warm smiles.

Alexander didn't deny it. Instead, he explained gently, "I've brought some common medications. Feel free to contact us if you need more."

Elder Thompson rubbed his hands together excitedly. "Thank you so much! Did Dr. Carter arrange this?"

The trunk opened, revealing crates upon crates of medical supplies. The villagers gasped.

"The car can't go any further. Do you have a cart?"

"Yes, yes!" Elder Thompson immediately called for someone to fetch one.

Alexander removed his suit jacket and rolled up his sleeves, ready to help.

"Oh no, no!" The elder stopped him. "May I ask your surname?"

"Hamilton."

"Mr. Hamilton, people like you are rare!" Elder Thompson's eyes grew misty. "The last bunch just came for photos and never showed their faces again..."

Alexander looked slightly uncomfortable with the praise, his eyes unconsciously searching for Evelyn.

She was busy organizing the supplies, pretending not to notice his silent plea for rescue.

The children swarmed back.

Alexander returned to the car and retrieved an elegantly wrapped box of chocolates.

"A small gift." He crouched down, handing a piece to each child.

"Thank you, uncle!"

"Call him big brother!" Elder Thompson corrected.

Alexander watched with a smile as the children ran off gleefully, slipping the last piece of chocolate into his pocket.

Evelyn had just finished sorting the supplies when she looked up to see him approaching.

"Thank you for the donation," she said professionally.

Instead of responding, Alexander pulled out the chocolate. "Saved this for you."

The wrapper bore unfamiliar Italian script.

Evelyn was genuinely hungry and unwrapped it without hesitation.

"Seems like you're doing well," he murmured.

"Yes. Very fulfilling."

"I know you wanted space," Alexander said quietly, studying her. "But I couldn't stop worrying. Neither could the elders at home."

Evelyn nibbled the chocolate and gave a small nod.

Elder Thompson enthusiastically invited, "Mr. Hamilton, why not rest at my place?"

"No need." Alexander's gaze returned to Evelyn. "I'll go with Dr. Carter. We have... things to discuss."
###Chapter 643: Alexander's Discomfort

Elder Thompson hesitated. "Dr. Carter stays at the clinic dormitory with the other nurses."

The implication was clear—a grown man visiting the women's living quarters was inappropriate.

Alexander remained composed. "I just need a word with Dr. Carter."

The village elder glanced between them, torn between offending the rare philanthropist and respecting the female medical staff's privacy.

Evelyn finished her chocolate square. Knowing Alexander's persistence, she intervened. "Elder, I'll show him around."

They walked back along the dirt road.

The modest clinic building already seemed crude, but the dormitory made Alexander's brow furrow involuntarily.

Evelyn paused at the door. "Wait here."

After checking inside, she motioned him in.

As Alexander ducked through the low doorway, his temple collided with a bunk bed railing. A dull thud echoed.

"You okay?" Evelyn turned.

"Fine." He stepped forward—only to kick over a thermos. Cold water soaked his trouser cuff.

Evelyn sighed. "That's yesterday's water. It's room temperature now."

Alexander righted the thermos clumsily. "Do you have a mop?"

"Don't bother." She pointed to the exposed brick floor. "It'll dry."

His chest tightened as he surveyed the peeling walls and sparse furniture—her living conditions.

"Sit." She indicated her narrow bed.

He hesitated. He remembered her germaphobia—no outside clothes on her bedding.

"This isn't home." She read his hesitation. "No need for formalities."

Perching gingerly on the edge, he watched her grab the empty thermos. Outside at the concrete sink, she filled it and plugged in the instant water heater.

The outdated appliance made his jaw tense.

"It boils water." Her tone was flat.

When steam rose, she handed him a mug. "No tea leaves."

"Water's perfect." He blew across the surface. "This tastes..."

"Well water. Mineral aftertaste." She cut him off. "Leave if it's unpalatable."

He drained the cup in one go. "If you drink it, so can I." Though his lips twitched, his expression stayed neutral.

Evelyn changed subjects. "How'd you find this place?"

"Asked your hospital director." He set down the mug. "He only said this region."

"So you checked every village?"

Alexander nodded. "Seven of them."

Her pulse hitched. These mountain hamlets were scattered and remote.

Outside, nurses' laughter approached.

Alexander stood. "I should go."

At the threshold, he turned. "I'll return tomorrow."

Not a request—a statement.

Evelyn watched his broad-shouldered silhouette disappear down the dirt path, exhaling softly.
###Chapter 644: I Want to Experience Your Life

His gaze remained fixed on Evelyn's face, his eyes holding a tenderness he hadn't even noticed.

Evelyn frowned slightly, recalling the rugged mountain roads and exhausting transfers. "This is a remote area. You have to cross several mountains to get here, and there are so many villages..."

Alexander's lips curved upward.

"I have a mouth. I can ask for directions." His tone was light. "The director mentioned the poor medical conditions in these support areas. At every village, I asked if they had a hospital. They said only this place had a clinic, so I knew I'd find you."

He had driven his SUV over mountains and through valleys, stopping at each village to ask for the clinic's location—until he finally found her.

Evelyn was taken aback. "How long did you search?"

"I left work three days ago."

No wonder there were provisions in the car. He'd been living in it for three days.

Afraid she'd find it unappealing, Alexander quickly explained, "I brought a change of clothes. I even showered at a guesthouse yesterday."

"That's not what I meant." Evelyn sighed. "Medical aid assignments have deadlines. I'll go back eventually."

Alexander nodded. "I know. But you always said you wanted to support remote areas. When I heard they were short on medicine, I asked Olivia for a list of common prescriptions and bought them to bring." He paused. "Consider it my contribution to healthcare?"

"You call that 'some' medicine?" Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "You nearly filled the entire clinic. But getting prescriptions from Olivia was thoughtful."

The rare praise brought a faint smile to his eyes.

"I went to several pharmacies to gather everything. I hope it helps the locals."

Evelyn's voice was calm. "Thank you, on behalf of those who need it."

"We're all doing our part. No need for thanks."

"...You've changed a lot."

The old Alexander would never have been this considerate, let alone endure three days in a car just to see her.

He studied her intently. "So have you."

He sensed a newfound serenity in her. Before, she had ignored him. Now, at least, she treated him as a friend.

"Have I?"

Alexander suspected it had to do with Andrew's passing, but he didn't voice it, only nodding.

Evelyn, however, saw through him and looked toward the courtyard. "Life here brings peace. I'll be staying a long time. You have work at the company—say what you need to say, then go back."

"It took me three days to find this place. At least let me rest." Alexander insisted. "Driving while exhausted is more dangerous."

Evelyn switched tactics. "You're used to luxury. You've never even seen an instant water heater. Bathing here is a hassle, and the toilets are outhouses."

She laid out every inconvenience, hoping to discourage him.

Instead, Alexander laughed. "Can't be worse than curling up in a car for three days. I couldn't even stretch my legs."

"Daily hardships are different."

"Perfect chance to experience your life." His gaze burned. "We skipped the dating phase and went straight to marriage. Maybe that's why we ended up where we did—we never understood each other's lives. This time, I want to change that."

Evelyn stopped arguing and held up three fingers. "I bet you'll last three days, tops."

"If I do, you won't send me away?"

"We'll see."

She had almost said one day.

A knock interrupted them. Assuming it was the nurse returning, Evelyn turned to explain—only to find Elder Thompson at the door.

"You're here for him?" She pointed at Alexander.

Seeing how eager she was to dismiss him, Alexander followed resignedly.

The elder chuckled. "No guesthouses in the village, and the clinic's full. I prepared the room the kids use during New Year's—clean, with a double bed. You two can stay together."

He clearly mistook them for a real couple.

Evelyn politely declined. "Thank you, but I need to stay in the dorm for night calls."

The reasonable excuse made the elder nod. "Dr. Carter is very considerate." To Alexander, he added, "Mr. Hamilton, you can stay there. The clinic dorms don’t accommodate men. My house is close—you can visit Dr. Carter anytime."
###Chapter 645: The Hen's Reprieve

"Alright, I'll head over once I'm done here." Alexander Hamilton gave a slight nod, his gaze sweeping across the clinic's modest hallway. The director's enthusiasm was hard to decline, but his attention was drawn to the faint crease between Evelyn Carter's brows.

Elder Thompson rubbed his calloused hands together as he approached. "Mr. Hamilton, is there anything else you need?"

Alexander glanced at Evelyn, who was inventorying medical supplies, and lowered his voice. "These medications need to be sorted and stored. Dr. Carter and I were just about to organize them."

He knew her too well. Those cardboard boxes piled in the hallway were like thorns—she wouldn't even eat lunch until they were dealt with.

"Leave it to me!" The elder slapped his thigh and turned to call outside, "Zach! Round up the boys who delivered the supplies earlier!"

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest, but the elder had already dashed out with surprising agility for a man his age.

Alexander watched his retreating figure disappear around the corner and chuckled. "The people here are more welcoming than I expected."

"Did you see the cured meats in the dormitory?" Evelyn asked without looking up.

"I did." He nodded. "I thought it might be some local custom."

She paused her notetaking. "They arrived this morning. All because we delivered a difficult birth last night." Her eyes drifted toward the rolling green hills outside the window. "People here don't know empty pleasantries. They just give you the best they have."

Sunlight filtered through the window lattice, casting golden flecks on her lashes. Alexander found himself holding his breath.

"No wonder some choose to live secluded in the mountains," he murmured, inhaling the crisp scent of grass and trees. "This kind of simple life truly—"

"It's only the first day." Evelyn cut him off. "Don't jump to conclusions."

He smiled faintly but didn't argue. "Aside from medical supplies, what else is lacking here?"

"Doctors." The word slipped out before she could stop herself, her ears turning pink. "I mean—"

"I understand." His eyes settled on the humming, antiquated refrigerator in the corner. "Insufficient refrigeration?"

Her face lit up. "How did you know? Many vaccines and specialized medications require temperature control. Right now, we can only prioritize the most urgent—"

Alexander was already pulling out his phone. "Order a commercial freezer—the largest available—expedited shipping."

When Elder Thompson returned with the young men, he overheard the conversation. The old man's eyes instantly welled up, his rough fingers wiping at the corners.

"Are you alright?" Evelyn startled.

"It's nothing, nothing..." His voice trembled. "Just...thank you..."

Flustered, she looked to Alexander, who smoothly interjected, "It's the least we can do. By the way, Elder, about lunch—"

"Right, right!" The elder suddenly remembered. "I'll go slaughter a hen!"

Evelyn darted forward to stop him. "No! Those hens are still laying eggs!"

"How can we neglect our honored guests?" The elder insisted.

Alexander stepped in. "Wouldn't preparing the chicken now delay lunch?"

Evelyn caught on immediately. "Exactly. With all the fresh ingredients everyone brought this morning, they'll spoil if we don't use them soon."

The elder hesitated, rubbing his hands. "But those were gifts for you two..."

"We'd like to share the meal with everyone," Evelyn said brightly. "Consider it...a welcome for Mr. Hamilton?"

He played along with a nod. "I'd love to meet everyone properly."

Finally relenting, the elder agreed. Evelyn exhaled quietly—the hens had been granted a temporary reprieve.

Soon, savory aromas wafted from the kitchen. Two wooden tables pushed together were laden with cured meats, bamboo shoots, and seasonal vegetables brought by the villagers. The nurses clustered around Evelyn, chattering excitedly:

"Dr. Carter, your husband arrived just in time. All this food won't go to waste now."

"He's even more handsome than those CEOs in dramas!"

"But can a big-shot executive really adjust to a place like this?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain when she noticed Alexander standing beneath the pear tree in the courtyard. Sunlight dappled his shoulders through the leaves. He raised a rough ceramic bowl toward her, a ghost of a smile on his lips.

In that moment, she forgot what she meant to say.
###Chapter 646: I Do, Very Much

Evelyn Carter suddenly understood Alexander Hamilton's embarrassment when he was surrounded by children that morning. She pressed her lips together, fingers unconsciously tracing the stethoscope in her white coat pocket. "Let's eat first. It's a long story."

The nurses exchanged knowing glances before letting her off with amused smiles.

After lunch, Elder Thompson surveyed the messy courtyard and sighed, rubbing his hands. "Had we known Mr. Hamilton was coming, we'd have prepared proper dishes..."

Seeing the old man's guilt, Evelyn reassured gently, "City folks actually prefer rustic flavors. Wild herbs and berries are rare delicacies for him."

"Exactly!" The village elder's eyes lit up as he slapped his thigh and stood. "Little Bean and the kids are experts at foraging!"

Alexander sat nearby, his gaze never leaving Evelyn. Sunlight filtered through the old locust tree, casting dappled shadows on her white coat.

"So the village chickens are safe now?" He leaned close, amusement lacing his whisper.

Evelyn glanced at the excited children running off. "The chickens are spared, but the mountain greens won't be so lucky."

The clinic was unusually quiet that afternoon. During her rounds, every patient's family asked the same question.

"Dr. Carter, your husband is so handsome!" An elderly woman grasped Evelyn's hand. "How long have you been married?"

Her stethoscope nearly slipped.

"Almost four years," Alexander answered from the doorway, sleeves rolled to his elbows, revealing toned forearms.

"And how old are your children?"

His smile faltered briefly. "...Not yet."

The ward erupted in chatter.

"Dr. Carter works so hard—when would she have time for babies?"
"Young couples these days prioritize quality of life over children."
"Doctor, are you two DINKs?"

Evelyn tightened her grip on the medical chart. "I love children."

All eyes turned to Alexander.

"I do," he met Evelyn's gaze steadily, voice firm. "Very much."

The villagers nodded sagely. "Ah, just too busy with work!"
"But Dr. Carter's an OB-GYN—she knows more than us."
"Right, of course..."

Alexander smoothly changed the subject, turning to reorganize the medicine cabinet. When Evelyn returned from rounds, the entire clinic sparkled—medicines neatly categorized, even the small fridge she'd mentioned polished to a shine.

"I thought you were tired?" She arched an eyebrow.

He remained straight-faced. "With everyone being so welcoming, I had to contribute." Pointing to the broken rocking chair in the corner, "Need that fixed?"

At dusk, a young nurse came skipping in. "Elder Thompson invited you both for dinner!"

The sunset painted half the sky crimson, stretching their shadows long across the ground.
###Chapter 647: A Village Night Feast

Evelyn Carter had just placed her stethoscope back into the medical kit when Alexander Hamilton appeared at the clinic door, waiting for her.

"Someone from Elder Thompson's family came by," he said, leaning against the doorframe. His white shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, revealing toned forearms. "Dinner is ready."

A nurse peeked out from the pharmacy. "Go ahead, Dr. Carter. We’ve got things covered here. If there’s an emergency, I’ll run to get you."

Evelyn glanced at the wall clock—the hour hand had already reached seven. Outside, the sky was completely dark, with only a few dim streetlights casting faint glows.

"Let’s go." She took off her white coat and draped it over the back of a chair.

The village path, soaked by the day’s rain, made sticky, squelching sounds underfoot. Alexander’s leather shoes sank into the mud with a wet squelch.

"Careful—"

Before Evelyn could finish, his foot plunged into a puddle. Mud splashed up, staining his crisp dress pants in dark splotches.

"Are you okay?" Instinctively, she reached out to steady him.

Alexander shook his head, though his brow furrowed slightly. The cold mud seeped into his pant leg, and the grit beneath his feet made every step feel like walking on broken glass.

"Your shoes—"

"It’s fine." He cut her off, pulling out his phone and switching on the flashlight. The beam sliced through the darkness, illuminating the uneven path ahead.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. She knew Alexander had a thing about cleanliness—this was practically torture for him.

The entrance to Elder Thompson’s house was crowded with villagers. At their arrival, the crowd parted to let them through. A few children hid behind the adults, peering curiously at the visitors from the city.

"Dr. Carter, Mr. Hamilton, please come in!" Elder Thompson greeted them, rubbing his hands together. His gaze lingered briefly on Alexander’s mud-splattered pants before he offered an apologetic smile.

In the courtyard, several square tables had been pushed together. The mismatched bowls and chopsticks were worn but polished to a shine. At the center, a large pot of brown sugar egg soup steamed, its sweet, rich scent filling the air.

"Let’s eat out here," Evelyn said with a smile. "You can’t see stars this bright in the city."

Alexander nodded in agreement, though his eyes flicked toward a smaller table in the corner. The dishes there were noticeably simpler. A few children stared longingly at the egg soup on the main table before their mothers gently tugged them back.

Elder Thompson personally ladled two bowls of the soup. The melted brown sugar swirled with golden egg ribbons, glistening under the light.

"Drink it while it’s hot—it’ll warm you up."

When Alexander took the bowl, his fingertips brushed the scalding rim. Without flinching, he took a large sip. The cloying sweetness flooded his mouth.

Evelyn watched his Adam’s apple bob once.

"How is it?" Elder Thompson asked eagerly.

"Unique," Alexander replied with a faint smile before taking another sip.

Suddenly, Evelyn reached out. "Let’s switch."

Alexander pressed down on her wrist. "No need."

He tipped his head back and drained the bowl in one go, his throat working rapidly. When he set it down, a trace of sugar clung to the corner of his lips.

Evelyn picked up a bite of greens with her chopsticks and held it out. Alexander leaned in, eating directly from her utensil. His warm breath brushed her fingertips.

"Delicious," he murmured, though his gaze remained fixed on her face.
###Chapter 648: His Resolve

The bitter saltiness of wild greens spread across Alexander's tongue.

His brow furrowed slightly as he forced himself to swallow.

"Are you okay?" Evelyn handed him a glass of warm water.

He took it, his Adam's apple bobbing. "I'm fine."

"Don't push yourself. It's normal if the local food doesn't suit your palate."

"I can adapt."

Evelyn looked up at him. "You're really staying?"

"You managed two weeks here. Why can't I?"

"I grew up with hardships. This is nothing to me. But you—"

"I told you," Alexander interrupted, "I want to understand your world."

Evelyn sighed softly.

He picked up a portion of wild greens and placed them in her bowl. "Try this."

Steam rose from the rustic pot, surrounded by an array of foraged dishes—cold bitter greens, boiled dandelions, fried broomweed... A humble yet heartfelt welcome feast prepared by Elder Thompson.

"These are shepherd's purse dumplings," the elder said, pointing to the freshly steamed basket. "Fried in lard. I hope they're to your liking."

The villagers watched their reactions nervously.

Alexander lifted the coarse ceramic bowl, sipping the slightly astringent hot water. "These wild greens are rare in the city. Natural ingredients are the healthiest."

Only then did the villagers relax and take their seats.

Mrs. Thompson enthusiastically served them, piling their bowls high. Without serving chopsticks, she used her own.

Evelyn ate without hesitation. Alexander stared at the dandelion greens in his bowl, his brow twitching almost imperceptibly.

"How many times must I tell you?" Elder Thompson suddenly scolded his wife. "City folks have standards—you can't use your own chopsticks!"

The old woman froze, flustered.

Noticing the dandelions in Alexander's bowl, Evelyn took it and dumped them into her own. "I love wild greens. If he won't eat them, I will."

She swallowed the bitter leaves without flinching.

"I'll fetch clean chopsticks—" the old woman stammered, rising.

"No need," Alexander stopped her. "I was just curious what this herb was. The flavor is... unique."

"It's dandelion," the woman said, relieved. "Dr. Carter knows—it's medicinal."

Evelyn nodded. "Clears heat and toxins. I like it."

As soon as she spoke, Alexander poured all the dandelion back into his bowl and ate it in large bites.

Evelyn's chest tightened.

"Perfect. I've been feeling feverish lately," he said, suppressing the bitterness.

Seeing his genuine acceptance, Elder Thompson relaxed and recommended another dish. "This is pickled toona. Harvested in spring. Give it a try."

This time the flavor was milder. Alexander ate with noticeably more ease.

Evelyn watched discreetly. To her surprise, he continued serving himself bite after bite, showing no sign of reluctance.

When the moon reached its zenith, Evelyn stood to leave. "There's a delivery case at the clinic. I need to take the night shift."

The elder tried to persuade her to stay but finally walked them to the gate. "Mr. Hamilton, your room is ready. Come back after seeing Dr. Carter off."

Alexander's stomach churned, but his expression remained neutral. "I—"

"We have matters to discuss," Evelyn interjected smoothly.
###Chapter 649: I Don't Mind the Trouble

The village elder's laughter rang out clearly in the night. "Young couples reunited after so long apart should have time to talk. We won't disturb you."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed as she quickly pulled Alexander away. Under the moonlight, she noticed his complexion growing paler.

"There's a drainage ditch over—" Before she could finish, Alexander was already rushing toward it.

He doubled over, unable to suppress the nausea any longer. Evelyn stood behind him, gently patting his back. "I could tell you weren't feeling well earlier. Why force yourself to eat so much?"

Beads of sweat dotted Alexander's forehead. He was too weak from vomiting to respond.

When he finally straightened up, Evelyn saw his ashen face in the moonlight. "This place really doesn't suit you."

"Wherever you are is where I belong." His voice was hoarse but resolute.

On their way back to the clinic, Evelyn made a detour to the village store. She emerged holding two packets of instant beef noodles.

The dim light of her dorm room revealed Alexander sitting weakly on her bed. Evelyn efficiently boiled water and prepared the noodles, the aroma soon filling the small space.

"Eat something," she said, handing him the steaming cup. "Better than an empty stomach."

Alexander managed a few bites, his color gradually improving. As Evelyn cleaned up, she added, "Tell me if you feel worse."

"I don't want to be a burden."

"That's not what I meant." Her hands stilled.

A comfortable silence settled between them. Alexander nodded slightly, reluctant to disrupt this rare moment of peace.

Giggles suddenly erupted outside. A group of young nurses clustered at the doorway, eyes sparkling with curiosity.

"Mr. Hamilton visiting Dr. Carter?" the lead nurse teased.

Before Evelyn could explain, the girl waved her off. "We understand!" She brandished a deck of cards. "We're pulling an all-nighter in the duty room. You two enjoy your reunion!"

The nurses scampered away before Evelyn could respond.

Alexander turned to her. "Now what?"

Evelyn sighed. "You take my bed. I'll stay with a colleague." She hesitated. "In case your stomach acts up again..."

The night grew quiet. Evelyn soon fell asleep, but Alexander tossed and turned—the bed too short, the blanket too small, the wooden frame too hard.

Finally, he turned on his side, watching Evelyn's sleeping face in the moonlight. As the breeze fluttered the curtains, his gaze softened even more than the silvery light.
###Chapter 650: Sharing a Bed

Moonlight seeped through the gap in the curtains, casting a silver streak across the concrete floor.

Evelyn Carter's breathing was even and steady, her lashes casting faint shadows beneath her eyes. She always fell asleep quickly, no matter how exhausted she was.

Alexander Hamilton lay on the opposite bed, watching her in silence.

He remembered the step count he'd accidentally seen on her phone—over thirty thousand steps a day. That didn’t even account for the hours she spent standing motionless in the operating room.

Being a doctor drained not just the body, but the mind.

No wonder she slept so deeply.

"...Can't sleep?"

Evelyn suddenly opened her eyes, meeting his gaze.

Alexander immediately shut his. "I can."

"Then sleep."

"Mhm."

She turned over and was soon lost in dreams again.

...

3:17 AM.

Evelyn woke inexplicably. Instinctively, she glanced toward the other bed.

The night breeze lifted a corner of the curtain, flooding the room with moonlight. Alexander was curled up, hands pressed to his abdomen, brows furrowed in pain.

She threw on her coat and approached.

"Alexander?"

No response. She touched his forehead—burning.

A fever.

Evelyn quickly retrieved the first-aid kit, grabbing fever reducers and stomach medicine. She nudged him gently. "Wake up."

Alexander blinked groggily. "Hm?"

"You have a fever."

He touched his own forehead, voice hoarse. "Do I?"

His throat ached, and his stomach churned.

"Take these."

She helped him sit up, handing him the pills and water. He swallowed them obediently before collapsing back onto the bed.

"Aren’t you going to ask what I just gave you?"

"Trust you," he mumbled, pulling the blanket tighter.

Evelyn draped her coat over him. The blanket was too short, leaving gaps.

"Cold..." He suddenly grabbed her hand.

"I'll get another blanket."

Alexander let go.

She brought her own blanket, tucking it carefully around him.

"Sleep."

She knew illness made people fragile, so she was extra patient.

"You gave me your blanket. What will you use?"

"I'll borrow one."

"That’s not proper."

"We don’t stand on ceremony here."

"Evelyn."

"Yes?"

"Still cold."

"Fevers make you feel cold, but more layers won’t help." She softened her tone. "Overheating is worse."

"...Mhm." His eyes stayed closed, voice weak. "Come up here... I’ll hold you... Won’t be cold then..."

Evelyn froze.

Alexander fell silent again, forehead still blazing. It sounded like feverish delirium, not a calculated request.

After a long hesitation, she lay down beside him, still clothed.

Half-asleep, warmth enveloped her.

His chest pressed against her back, his arm circling her waist, drawing her closer. Hot breath brushed her hair. "Sleep..."

Morning.

Evelyn woke on schedule, still caged in his arms. She tried to rise but jostled him awake.

"How did I—"

"You had a fever." She slid out of bed, smoothing her hair. "I need to get to the clinic. Pills are on the table."

She left in a hurry, as if fleeing something.

Alexander stared at the two blankets and coat covering him. Memories surfaced—he’d asked her to share the bed.

He’d thought it was a dream.

...

When Evelyn returned for her white coat, Alexander was sitting up.

"Feeling better?" She pointed to instant noodles by the bed. "Eat if you’re hungry. Can you manage?"

He nodded weakly.

Unconvinced, she took his temperature.

"Fever’s gone. Probably gastritis plus a chill." She exhaled in relief. "Rest."

This time, she left decisively, shutting the door behind her.

Alexander gazed at the closed door, fingers brushing the coat she’d draped over him.

A knock interrupted.
###Chapter 651: Her Radiance

"The door's unlocked." His voice was muffled, having assumed Evelyn wouldn't return so soon.

The wooden door creaked softly.

Alexander Hamilton looked up, surprised to see a bespectacled young man standing at the threshold. The stranger, barely in his twenties with a bookish demeanor, clearly wasn't a local villager.

His brow furrowed slightly as his sharp gaze assessed the newcomer, the air around him turning noticeably colder.

"Is Dr. Carter not here?" The young man adjusted his glasses nervously.

"She's at the clinic." Alexander's tone was clipped. "And you are?"

"I'm here for the teaching volunteer program." The visitor flushed. "There's a physics problem I can't solve, and I was hoping to ask Dr. Carter..."

Several timid children peeked out from behind him, textbooks clutched in their hands.

Alexander pushed himself up from the table. "She's busy. Show me."

The young man hesitated before handing over the worksheet. "You... understand physics?"

"Hmm."

Soon, the courtyard transformed into an impromptu classroom. Alexander sat on a low stool, sketching force diagrams in the dirt with a twig.

"This problem's beyond your syllabus, but there's another approach..."

His explanations were concise yet crystal clear. The children listened raptly, and even the volunteer teacher began jotting notes.

"Any questions?" Alexander scanned the group.

A small girl tentatively raised her hand.

"No problem. Let's go through it again."

As the sun dipped westward, the sandy ground became a canvas of equations. When the children prepared to leave, a bold boy asked, "Mister, can we come to you next time?"

The volunteer teacher quickly interjected, "Mr. Hamilton is very busy—"

"It's fine." Alexander cut him off. "Like Dr. Carter, I'm here to help."

Watching their jubilant retreat, he pulled out his phone and dialed Emily Zade.

"Contact several universities. Recruit volunteer teachers for the holiday program. I'll cover all expenses."

After hanging up, he freshened up briefly before heading to the clinic.

The two-story building buzzed with activity. Inside, Evelyn was intently examining a patient, strands of hair escaping her loose bun as she absentmindedly tucked them behind her ear.

Alexander stood in the courtyard, his gaze softening.

This was her true essence.

Shining brilliantly in her mission to heal.
###Chapter 652: The Stubborn Fool

The moment the last patient left the examination room, Evelyn Carter's real work had just begun.

Alexander Hamilton stood at the corner of the hallway, watching her hurried figure disappear into the ward. He silently withdrew the foot he'd been about to step forward with. Approaching her now would only make him an unwelcome distraction.

As a patient himself, his treatment couldn't be more different.

"Dr. Carter!" A nurse's anxious voice carried from the ward. "This child absolutely refuses the injection. He started crying the moment I touched his hand."

The little boy on the bed was wailing hysterically, his face flushed red. His grandmother hovered helplessly beside him, her rough hands continuously wiping his tear-streaked cheeks.

"Doctor, I'm so sorry..." The old woman twisted her hands nervously. "He misses his mother terribly. I just can't calm him down..."

Evelyn's gaze fell on the child's white-knuckled grip. Her heart softened. She knelt down and gently gathered him into her arms.

"Sweetheart, let Auntie take a look, okay?" Her voice was tender as her fingertips brushed his damp eyelashes. "Auntie knows the shot hurts, but this will help you see Mommy sooner."

The boy hiccuped through his tears, his blurry vision momentarily superimposing Evelyn's gentle face over his hazy memory of his mother. Timidly, he clutched at her white coat. "Mommy..."

"Good boy. This weekend, Auntie will help you call Mommy." Seizing the opportunity, Evelyn took his small hand and signaled to the nurse with her eyes.

When the needle pierced his skin, the child trembled violently. Evelyn immediately held him tighter, humming a soft lullaby. By the time the IV was secured, he'd quieted in her embrace.

"Doctor, thank you so much..." The grandmother bowed repeatedly.

"It's my duty." Evelyn checked her watch. "Don't delay when he has a fever next time."

From the neighboring ward came waves of coughing. Three elderly patients were receiving IV drips, with Old Mr. Thompson at the end squinting laboriously at the tiny print on his medicine box.

"Sir, this medication can only be taken once daily." Evelyn strode over and pulled out a marker, drawing a large "1" on the box.

The elderly patients bombarded her with questions until a nurse came to remind her of her schedule, forcing her to rush back to the examination room.

"Dr. Carter," a young nurse whispered conspiratorially, poking her arm, "Mr. Hamilton has been waiting for you all morning."

Sunlight filtered through the leaves of an old locust tree, casting dappled shadows across the courtyard. Alexander stood amidst those shifting patterns, his tailored suit starkly out of place in the modest clinic.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn remembered their days at Central Hospital. Back then, he'd always parked his car in the spot closest to the outpatient building, the window rolled halfway down to reveal his sharply defined profile.

If Annabelle Taylor hadn't returned, would this illusion of a marriage have lasted longer?

She'd asked herself countless times in the dead of night: Should she choose false perfection or the bloody truth?

The answer had long been etched into her bones—she'd rather feel the pain with clarity than live in delusion.

"Finished?" Alexander approached, the breeze carrying the scent of disinfectant from his sleeves.

Evelyn wiped the sweat from her temple. "That's how clinics are. Everything falls on you."

"You love it here." It wasn't a question. He studied the light in her eyes—a vitality he hadn't seen in ages.

A nurse passing by with medical records giggled. "Mr. Hamilton, why just stand there? Dr. Carter's hands don't bite."

The tree shadows swayed, time seeming to overlap in that instant. Watching his hesitant, aborted gesture, Evelyn suddenly smiled faintly.

"Yes," she said, gazing at the distant rolling mountains. "This place reminds me of when I first graduated from medical school."

Back then, they'd both still believed love could conquer everything.
###Chapter 653: The Healer's Heart

Alexander Hamilton's gaze had been fixed on Evelyn Carter since he stepped through the door.

The nurses at the station exchanged knowing glances, their lips curling into discreet smiles.

"Dr. Carter," his long fingers tapped lightly on the counter, "my cold has gotten worse."

The most vivacious nurse immediately chimed in, "Oh dear, only Dr. Carter can treat someone as important as Mr. Hamilton! We lowly nurses wouldn't dare."

Giggling, the girls playfully nudged Evelyn forward.

She stumbled slightly, the hem of her white coat brushing against the sleeve of Alexander's tailored suit.

"Enough," she chided softly. The nurses scattered like startled birds.

Alexander had already settled into the examination chair with the effortless grace of someone presiding over a board meeting.

"Did you take your medicine?" Evelyn flipped open the medical chart.

"Exactly as prescribed." His Adam's apple bobbed. "But my throat feels like I swallowed razor blades."

She picked up a tongue depressor. "Open wide—"

Under the clinical lights, his tonsils glared an angry red.

"Severe inflammation." Her brow furrowed. "More fluids. Less talking."

"An IV would be faster." He loosened his tie.

Her pen hovered over the prescription pad. "Overusing antibiotics isn't advisable."

"I can't afford delays." His gaze burned. "The medical relief team arrives next week."

The pen scratched across paper.

When Evelyn looked up, the nurses' station stood deserted.

"Those girls..." She had no choice but to prepare the IV herself.

As the antiseptic swab grazed his hand, Alexander's muscles tensed slightly.

"It's been a while since I've done this," she warned, adjusting the needle.

His lips quirked. "Consider it practice."

The needle found its mark on the first try.

After securing the tape, Evelyn turned to leave.

The tail of her coat caught in his grip.

"Something else?" She didn't turn around.

"Your mother..." His voice was rough. "She's at your uncle's place."

Her shoulders stiffened.

"Emily's back at school preparing for exams." He continued quietly, "Mrs. Anderson started the new treatment."

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting dappled patterns across the examination bed.

Evelyn finally faced him. "Thank you."

"Don't." Alexander studied the IV bag. "National initiative and all that."

The noon light seemed warmer suddenly.

"Actually..." She gazed at the swaying plane trees outside. "I can think about Dad now without crying."

The IV tube glinted faintly.

"He always said..." Her voice was barely audible. "Evelyn should be like a cedar."

"You are." The words came unexpectedly.

She arched a brow. "Stubborn?"

"Resilient." His eyes held hers. "My entire life was mapped out before I could walk. I never imagined..."

The IV dripped steadily.

Sunlight crept across her stethoscope, turning the metal to liquid silver.
###Chapter 654: A Costly Misstep

Evelyn Carter lowered her head, fingers unconsciously tracing the hem of her white coat.

"The path to becoming a doctor is far harder than I imagined," she murmured. "Five years of undergrad, four for my master's, three in residency... While others were settling into careers and families, I was still rotating through hospital wards."

Alexander Hamilton watched the faint tremor in her lashes, his chest tightening.

"My mother always wanted me to be a teacher. Said stability matters most for women." Evelyn's smile was bitter. "Only my father supported me. He told me to chase my dreams—that he'd cover the tuition."

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting dappled shadows across her face.

Alexander's throat worked, but no words came.

In the face of death, all comfort rang hollow.

"The attending physician said..." Evelyn drew a shaky breath. "Dad went peacefully. Didn't suffer much."

She lifted her gaze, tears glimmering. "After years in oncology, you learn this is the best possible ending."

Alexander's fingertips trembled slightly.

"Better than watching someone you love waste away to disease." Her voice caught. "At least he kept his dignity."

A tear splashed onto the desk, vanishing almost instantly.

Alexander reached for her hand—then froze mid-motion.

"Evelyn." His voice roughened. "You consider everyone's needs but your own."

She turned away. "I'm fine."

"Really?"

"Here, I can actually help people." She stared out the window. "Seeing patients walk out healthy—that's worth more than anything."

Alexander studied her profile. "I'll stay with you."

"Don't." She gestured to the IV in his hand. "This isn't your world, Mr. Hamilton. Go back to your corporate empire."

He chuckled. "A costly misstep?"

"Glad you recognize it."

"Didn't lose the lady, but got myself trapped instead." His gaze burned.

Evelyn sighed. "You can't adapt to this life."

"I'll learn."

"Says the man who fell ill in one day." She eyed his IV bag. "Altitude sickness isn't a joke."

Before Alexander could reply, Elder Thompson barged in.

"Mr. Hamilton!" The village chief carried a wool blanket. "This wretched weather—mustn't catch a chill!"

Alexander thanked him politely.

The elder produced a thermos with theatrical secrecy. "Family recipe for stomach ailments."

The dark liquid inside emitted a peculiar odor.

Alexander's expression froze.

"Drink it hot," Elder Thompson urged. "Got rock sugar if it's too bitter—"

Evelyn stifled a laugh. "He's not a child, Elder."

Alexander shot her a pleading look.

"Bottoms up." Her lips twitched. "Won't kill you."

He downed it in one gulp, eyes squeezed shut.

As the concoction hit his throat, Alexander's entire face contorted.

Evelyn finally laughed aloud. "How's it taste?"

"Better... than expected." He swallowed hard. "Still preferable to losing you."

Sunlight spilled between them, dust motes dancing in the golden beams.
###Chapter 655: Hidden Past

"Come on, drink this medicine and you'll feel better soon! Rest for now. I'll go home to get lunch and be right back."

The village elder's house was just a short walk from the clinic. In less than ten minutes, he returned with steaming bowls of noodles, each topped with two golden fried eggs that filled the air with their rich aroma.

Alexander Hamilton immediately recognized this as the best food the elder's household could offer. After the elder left, he pondered how to express his gratitude.

His cash had run out during the journey, and this remote village didn’t even have QR codes for digital payments.

By afternoon, after finishing his IV drip, Alexander lingered in the clinic. He turned to Evelyn Carter. "Is there a bank nearby?"

Evelyn didn’t look up. "The nearest ATM is in town. Need to withdraw money?"

"Forget it," Alexander dismissed the idea.

With nothing else to do, he decided to help around the clinic. While he couldn’t handle medical tasks, assisting elderly patients to the restroom was effortless for him. His height made him perfect for holding up IV bags.

As evening approached, a young nurse came with another message: the village elder had invited them for dinner. Evelyn was on duty that night, so Alexander went alone.

At the elder's doorstep, Mrs. Thompson was teetering on a stool, straining to reach a cured ham hanging from the rafters. The stool wobbled dangerously.

Alexander rushed forward to steady her. "Let me help, ma'am."

He effortlessly retrieved the ham. As he handed it over, he noticed her rough hands and deep wrinkles. Though the same age as Margaret Hamilton, she looked decades older.

"Mr. Hamilton, you and Dr. Carter are good people," Mrs. Thompson said suddenly as she sliced the ham. "Not like those wealthy folks who just pass through and leave."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"

"Our village is known for being poor. People often come to take photos or 'survey' the area, only to flee back to town by nightfall, complaining about the conditions." She sighed. "You're the first outsiders who’ve actually stayed."

Alexander mused, "Every place has its own beauty. If the countryside were just like the city, what would be the point?"

"You’re absolutely right." Her eyes brightened. "Those people were obsessed with the pond at the edge of our village. Wanted to turn it into a tourist spot."

The pond? Alexander pictured endless lotus leaves stretching across the water.

"My husband was so hopeful back then. He took them all over the hills, even gave them fish and lotus roots as gifts." Mrs. Thompson shook her head. "Nothing ever came of it."

Alexander instantly understood the issue. "The roads are too rough. Tourists wouldn’t bother coming."

"Building roads costs money!" The elder interjected, puffing on his pipe. "Worse yet, they all wanted us to relocate but refused to arrange proper housing. Our families have lived off that pond for generations. Where would we go? Starve?"

Alexander silently calculated. Road construction, relocation, development—massive investments with high risks. No wonder no one took the bait.

After dinner, Alexander headed back to the clinic with a takeaway box of fried rice with cured ham for Evelyn. As he reached the entrance, chaos erupted inside.

Five unruly children were darting around the courtyard, with Evelyn and three nurses chasing after them, breathless. One boy suddenly bolted for the gate—straight into Alexander’s arms.
###Chapter 656 Together

"Waaah—I don't want a shot!"

"The doctor lady lied last time! It hurt so much!"

"Grandma, save me!"

The pediatric clinic was in chaos. Several children wailed with flushed faces, squirming desperately in their parents' arms.

Young mothers shot apologetic glances at Evelyn while soothing their little ones. "Dr. Carter, please excuse them. They don't understand."

"Everyone in our village trusts your skills, Dr. Carter."

Evelyn was accustomed to such scenes. She crouched to eye level with the most distressed boy. "I promise this won't hurt at all. If you're brave, I'll give you candy. Deal?"

The boy sniffled. "Really no pain?"

"Really." Her gentle nod held conviction. "I never lie."

By the time the last vaccination was done, the nurses could barely straighten their backs.

"Dr. Carter, your better half's here again," a nurse teased, nudging toward the doorway with a wink. "More punctual than an alarm clock."

Evelyn looked up to see Alexander Hamilton at the corridor's end, sunlight framing his tall silhouette as he cradled a thermal lunchbox.

"Eat while it's warm." He set the container on her desk. "Chicken soup today."

Her stomach growled in response. The rich aroma filled the clinic when she lifted the lid.

Alexander watched her eat with quiet contentment. These ordinary moments brought him profound joy.

"I spoke with Elder Thompson today," he murmured. "He mentioned a natural pond behind the village. Said the scenery's remarkable."

Evelyn picked at a tender piece of chicken. "I walk there often. The summer lotuses are breathtaking."

"I'd like to see it." His eyes sparkled. "If suitable, Hamilton Group could develop it into a scenic spot. Boost the local economy."

She set down her chopsticks, studying him seriously. "The remote location means high development costs. Even if built, tourists might not come this far."

"Worth trying." Resolve steeled his voice. "We'll invite partners to experience it first. Word of mouth spreads. Besides..."

He hesitated, tone softening. "I want to contribute something meaningful. These people need better medical care. Their children deserve proper schools."

Her heart fluttered. No further objections came, just a quiet murmur. "Don't overextend yourself."

At dusk, Alexander insisted on walking her home.

"It's just a few steps—" Evelyn protested.

"I heard you enjoy strolling by the pond?" His eyes brightened. "Show me?"

Darkness deepened across the unpaved village paths, illuminated only by scattered household lights. Crickets chirped in the grass as the evening breeze carried lotus fragrance.

"So peaceful." Alexander inhaled deeply. "More soothing than any urban tranquility."

Evelyn gazed at the distant shimmering water. "Nature's voice heals hearts."

Their elongated shadows merged on the moonlit ridge as they walked.

"Here we are." She pointed ahead. "The pond. The path gets rough at night—best admire from here."

Silver moonlight danced on the water's surface where lotus leaves swayed like ink-wash paintings.

"Big brother! Big sister!" A piping voice interrupted.

A pigtailed girl bounded over with a bamboo basket. "Buy a grasshopper weaving! Just one dollar!"

Alexander crouched, examining the intricate craft. "Exquisite. Did you make this?"

"My daddy did!" She puffed with pride. "He can weave anything!"

Turning to Evelyn, Alexander flushed. "I... didn't bring cash."

Evelyn checked her pockets, producing a hundred-dollar bill. "This is all I have."

The girl's eyes darted shrewdly. "Then stay at our house! We're right by the pond! Mama cooks delicious food, and my little brother catches fish!"

She ticked off her home's merits on tiny fingers, determined to secure this "big deal."

Alexander chuckled. "Too late tonight. Tomorrow?"

"Promise!" The child thrust out her pinky. "Pinky swear! I'll come fetch you at the clinic at dawn! Dr. Carter keeps her word!"

Their laughter rippled across the moonlit water, startling fireflies into a swirling dance.
###Chapter 657: He Can't Bear to See Children Suffer

"Pinky promise, no take-backs for a hundred years!" The little girl extended her tiny finger, her bright eyes fixed on Evelyn.

Evelyn chuckled at her earnest expression and gently hooked their fingers together. "Deal. I'll be there."

Satisfied, the girl released her grip and skipped home, her twin braids bouncing merrily in the sunlight.

Alexander watched her retreating figure pensively. "Old Dr. Thompson is on duty tomorrow. You were planning to assist him, weren't you?"

"Yes." Evelyn nodded. "But now there's something more important."

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted almost imperceptibly.

Night fell, bringing a sharp chill to the mountain village. Insisting on walking Evelyn back to her dorm, they strolled side by side along the cobbled path.

"That child is clever," Alexander remarked suddenly. "Bargaining and reading people at such a young age. If she'd been born in the city, she might've become a business prodigy."

Evelyn glanced sideways. "You've only been here two days. How do you know so much about the village's education situation?"

"A volunteer teacher came to ask you about a physics problem this morning," Alexander explained. "With time to spare, I taught their class. That's when I learned three grades are crammed into one adobe classroom."

His brow furrowed, recalling the children's eager eyes.

"This place lacks both medical care and education," Evelyn sighed. "The teacher you met is the third batch of volunteers. The first two left—he's the only one holding things together now."

After a thoughtful pause, Alexander said, "I'll have Emily establish an education fund specifically for supporting volunteer teachers here."

"Rare to see you so invested in education." Evelyn sounded surprised.

"Must be getting old." His smile was wry. "Seeing children suffer twists my heart now."

The night breeze carried the crisp fragrance of mountain herbs.

Evelyn paused mid-step. "Because of that little girl selling woven grass toys?"

"Yes." Alexander's voice lowered. "I kept thinking—if our child had lived, they'd be running around by now."

"It was only two months along. We couldn't even tell the gender." Evelyn's tone was even.

"It was a girl." His certainty was absolute. "I could feel it."

Evelyn didn't press further, remembering Grandma Hamilton's dying words about the little girl coming to greet her.

At the dorm entrance, light spilled through the door crack. Alexander stopped. "Get some rest."

"Staying at Elder Thompson's tonight?" Evelyn asked.

"Need to make a trip to town first." He gestured to his empty wallet. "Should probably have cash for grass toys tomorrow."

Understanding, she nodded. "Be careful."

"You told me to return early—wouldn't dare delay." Turning toward the village entrance, his silhouette soon dissolved into the darkness.

Dawn had barely broken when soft knocking roused Evelyn.

Wrapping herself in a robe, she opened the door to find yesterday's little girl waiting outside.

"Good morning, Dr. Carter!" The girl peeked behind her at a smaller boy. "This is my brother. We came to get you."

Timidly, the boy peeked out. "Morning, Dr. Carter."

"Give me just a moment." Moving quietly, Evelyn washed up and deliberately packed extra cash.

When she emerged, both children stood ramrod straight by the door like miniature adults.

"I'm Lily, and this is Lotus," the girl announced proudly. "Mom says when we were born, the pond's lilies and roots grew extra strong."

In the morning light, a tall figure approached.

Lily's eyes sparkled. "Big brother! Why are you coming from outside? I thought you lived with Dr. Carter!"

Alexander arched an eyebrow. "Why would we live together?"

"My parents do!" Lily declared matter-of-factly. "They're never apart!"
###Chapter 658: Breakfast for Her

Lotus's small hand suddenly clutched her sister's sleeve, his eyes fixed on the bulging paper bag in Alexander Hamilton's grasp.

"Big brother bought buns for Dr. Carter!" Lily Waters' eyes lit up, her smile blooming like a tiny flower.

Only then did Evelyn Carter notice what Alexander was holding.

When had he picked those up?

Alexander extended the bag toward her. "Eat them while they're warm."

"Have you eaten?"

"No." He paused. "Didn't want to waste time."

Lily giggled behind her hand. "I'm not in a hurry. As long as you don't change your mind."

Lotus's gaze remained glued to the steamed buns.

Evelyn counted them. "Six?"

"Mm. Stood in line forever."

She pulled out two and offered them to the siblings.

"No, no!" Lily waved her hands frantically. "We already had rice porridge."

Lotus swallowed hard and mumbled, "Rice porridge doesn't have meat..."

"Lotus!" Lily scowled. "We're here to do business!"

Alexander suddenly spoke up. "Lily, how much for your woven grass figures?"

"One dollar each!" Her eyes sparkled. "But for you, I'll give three for two dollars!"

"I'll take a cricket, rabbit, and dog."

"Coming right up!" Lily bounced excitedly. "I'll run home and get them!"

Alexander patted his pockets. "No change. Will you trade for buns instead?"

Lotus tugged urgently at his sister's sleeve.

Lily's cheeks pinkened. "You...you're good people."

Understanding, Evelyn pressed the buns into Lotus's hands. "Deal. Don't forget our grass figures later."

Lotus devoured his portion while Lily nibbled delicately, like a little squirrel.

"You don't often go to town?" Alexander asked.

"Too much work at home," Lily explained. "We raise fish and lotus roots."

Lotus suddenly blurted, "Someone poisoned our pond!"

Lily's face paled. "Stop talking nonsense!"

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged glances.

This village had secrets.

On the path to the pond, Lily skipped ahead, pointing. "The shortcut through the village outskirts is fastest."

"Can we drive there?"

"Sure!" Lily thumped her chest. "I could find my way blindfolded!"

When they reached the black Cayenne SUV, Lotus's jaw dropped.

Alexander opened the passenger door. "Hop in."

But both children froze, too intimidated to move.
###Chapter 659: Tougher Than You Think

"Thank you, brother." Lily Waters murmured her gratitude first, small fingers twisting the hem of her oversized shirt. "But we can run ahead to show you the way."

Lotus Waters peeked from behind his sister, nodding timidly.

Both siblings wore clothes several sizes too large, sleeves and pant legs rolled up multiple times. Their shoes were caked with dried mud from running along the field paths.

Evelyn Carter crouched to gently straighten Lily's rolled sleeves. "Hop in. We'd feel terrible arriving at your home without you."

Lily bit her lip. "Dr. Carter, what if we dirty your car..."

"Won't happen." Alexander Hamilton turned from the driver's seat. "This vehicle isn't that delicate."

Lotus tentatively touched the leather upholstery, only to have his hand swatted away by his sister. "Don't touch!"

The boy withdrew his grubby fingers, staring at them guiltily.

Alexander watched through the rearview mirror. "Go ahead. These things are sturdier than they look."

Lily shook her head, sitting primly with only her curious eyes exploring the car's interior.

The mountain road jostled them violently. Suddenly Lily offered, "Brother, Dr. Carter, should I sing for you?"

Her clear child's voice filled the cabin: "Winding paths through hills so steep, Mama waits where two roads meet..."

Lotus clapped along, their duet transforming the stuffy car into something alive.

Evelyn found herself humming along. Alexander's grip on the wheel loosened as his gaze kept drifting to Evelyn's smiling reflection.

Rounding a bend, the landscape opened dramatically.

"We're here!" Lily pointed excitedly at a distant blue dot. "That's our boat!"

Before them stretched an endless lotus pond, emerald leaves trembling on jade waves. A few wooden skiffs floated peacefully against a backdrop of misty mountains.

Alexander parked, inhaling the fragrant air. "This should be a tourist destination."

"No!" Lily turned grave. "Mama says the pond is our lifeblood. Can't let strangers ruin it."

Evelyn ruffled her hair. "Don't worry. He's not that kind of person."

Lotus was already at water's edge, beckoning them toward his discovered lotus pod.

The setting sun gilded the pond's surface. Watching Evelyn's silhouette outlined in gold, Alexander suddenly knew—this detour was worth every mile.
###Chapter 660: A Married Couple All Along

Lily Waters and Lotus Waters blinked their innocent eyes. Though they didn't understand the adults' conversation, they stood obediently nearby, tiny hands clutching the hems of their clothes.

Alexander Hamilton suddenly asked, "Is this the only road for driving here?"

Lily answered brightly, "This is the safest one. Last time a city car tried taking shortcuts and got stuck in the mud. The whole village came to push it out."

Alexander's brow furrowed as he imagined his luxury SUV trapped in quagmire.

"Is this road easy to find?" He swiped at the navigation screen.

Lily tilted her head. "Our villagers could walk it blindfolded, but outsiders..." She pointed at the tangled routes on the GPS, "Without a guide, they can't even find the pond."

Evelyn Carter smiled at the clever girl and opened the car door. "Take us to your home."

Lily grabbed her brother's hand and hopped out. "Follow me! There's a bridge ahead!"

The adults followed the children, leaving the car parked casually by the roadside. Time itself seemed to move slower in this secluded village.

The so-called bridge was just a few precarious wooden planks barely secured to stone piers with hemp ropes. The children skipped across effortlessly, then turned to see the adults frozen in place.

Evelyn took a deep breath and stepped cautiously onto the planks. Alexander followed closely, his arm hovering protectively near her side.

"Don't be scared, Dr. Carter!" Lily's eyes sparkled. "I'll have Dad bring the boat!"

"No need!" Evelyn gritted her teeth and quickened her pace, practically running the last few steps.

Alexander's heart pounded until his feet finally met solid stone. The village was even more primitive than he'd imagined. His gaze swept the surroundings with complex emotions while Evelyn smiled and nodded at curious villagers.

"That must be Dr. Carter and Mr. Hamilton!"
"What a perfect match!"
"Perfect? They're already married..."

Alexander cleared his throat. "Just call me Alexander."

Lily urgently tugged Evelyn's sleeve. "Today they're our guests!" She then dragged her brother toward home, determined not to let another family intercept them.

Their house faced the pond, with dried chili peppers hanging in the fenced yard. Lily called toward the water, "Mom! Our guests are here!"

A weary-faced woman hurriedly dried her hands. "Dr. Carter, Mr. Hamilton, Lily talks about you every day..." She fumbled with boiling cups. "We don't have tea, just dried lotus seeds."

Evelyn cradled the rough ceramic cup, the lotus fragrance soothing. The woman brought a basket of fresh lotus pods. "Just picked, very sweet."

Alexander peeled one with interest. The woman pointed to straw weavings by the window. "My husband's handy with crafts." Her voice softened. "But nowadays...few buyers come."

Lily pouted. "The market hardly has any outsiders anymore."
###Chapter 661: The Generous Benefactor

Lily Waters priced each straw weaving at just one dollar, not because she undervalued her father's craftsmanship. No one understood better than her how many sleepless nights these intricate creations had cost him. Rather than letting them gather dust at home, selling them at a low price could at least ease the worry lines on her parents' foreheads.

Seeing Lily mention the straw weavings, the woman quickly explained, "The price is set at one dollar each. Feel free to pick any you like. Buy more, and I'll give you a discount."

Alexander Hamilton had already decided to purchase them at market price but nodded without revealing his thoughts.

Relieved, the woman enthusiastically added, "There are more straw weavings hanging in the backyard. If you want to see fireflies, you can spot them right in the yard. Lily wasn’t exaggerating."

The house was indeed cramped. The living room had a room on either side, barely enough for a family of four. Staying overnight would make it hard to even turn around.

The two exchanged a glance, silently agreeing on the same concern.

Lily, perceptive as ever, chimed in sweetly, "Don’t worry, Dr. Carter. There’s a small cottage behind our house. Once it’s tidied up, it’ll be perfect for staying. The stars are especially clear from there."

Before leaving, she tugged at Lotus Waters and instructed, "Go tell Dad we have guests. Ask Mom to cook fish for lunch. If Dad’s busy, you can catch one from the pond."

Lotus nodded and dashed off barefoot, his small feet kicking up dust.

Lily carried firewood into the kitchen. To save money, the family only ate two meals a day, with lunch being the only proper one.

Now alone in the living room, Evelyn Carter and Alexander sat in silence.

Alexander meticulously peeled a lotus pod, tasted a seed, and handed it to Evelyn. "It’s refreshingly sweet."

Evelyn accepted it. "Fresh lotus seeds are the best."

His fingers grew more adept, selecting the plumpest pods. One by one, glistening white seeds emerged, neatly arranged on a small plate.

"Are we really staying to see the fireflies?" Evelyn kept her voice low.

"Of course," Alexander answered without hesitation. "An opportunity like this is rare."

Evelyn’s voice dropped further. "I took a look at that cottage. It’s even more rudimentary than this place—earthen walls, a thatched roof. It might leak when it rains or lets in drafts."

Villagers held onto old structures, keeping them even after building new homes. The "cottage" Lily mentioned was likely an old temporary shed for watching the fish pond.

Alexander, who couldn’t even stand the firm dormitory beds, would struggle here. Thinking of his lingering cold, Evelyn couldn’t help but press further.

"I’m not doubting your sincerity. But that place is worse than the rural clinic. It’s practically wilderness survival..."

Alexander paused his peeling. "It shouldn’t rain tonight. If there’s a draft, we can set up a tent."

"Where would we get a tent?"

"In the trunk," he said casually. "I bought it in town last night."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "I thought you went to withdraw cash?"

"I browsed around while I was there," he replied offhandedly. "Since we’re here, might as well contribute to the local economy."

Evelyn smirked. "What else did you buy?"

Alexander listed them effortlessly. "Everything for camping. Two sets of tents, sleeping bags, new bedding, and mosquito nets."

He had nearly emptied the outdoor supplies store. The owner had been so thrilled he’d opened the warehouse for him.

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "You turned the Cayenne into a cargo truck?"

"Making the most of it," Alexander said, glancing at the straw weavings filling the room. "I want to buy them all. What do you think?"

With his wealth, purchasing the entire village wouldn’t be an issue. Evelyn knew his real purpose for this trip was likely to play the role of a generous benefactor.

Lily was bright and endearing, and the affection in Alexander’s eyes was unmistakable.

"Any favorites?" His gaze was intense.

Evelyn looked at the swaying straw weavings by the window, sunlight filtering through in dappled patterns. "They’re all lovely."

"No rush. Take your time," Alexander said softly. "We have the whole day."

The sweetness of lotus seeds lingered on their tongues. They savored the rare tranquility until the sound of Lotus’s bare feet running back shattered the peace.

"Mom! Sis! I caught a fish!"

The boy’s face was flushed with excitement, water droplets clinging to his cheeks. He held up a small fish strung on a straw rope, ready to bolt into the kitchen.

Seeing him drenched, Evelyn quickly stopped him. "Change into dry clothes first. The fish isn’t going anywhere."

Alexander stood and took the rope. "I’ll take it. You go change."
###Chapter 662: Of Course I Can

Lotus Waters was drenched from head to toe, his pants dripping water, yet his little face glowed with excitement. He held up a fish triumphantly, his voice ringing clear. "Big brother, look! I caught it myself! I'm going to tell Mom!"

Evelyn Carter couldn't help but laugh. "Go change before you catch a cold."

The boy bounded toward the kitchen like a joyful fawn. Soon, the rich aroma of fish stew wafted through the courtyard.

Evelyn and Alexander Hamilton were heading for a stroll by the pond when they overheard a woman's gentle voice from the kitchen. "...Last time all the fish died. These few were so hard to raise... Let the guests have them first. I'll make you eggs tonight."

The children swallowed hard but nodded obediently.

The couple exchanged a glance and quietly changed their path, avoiding the pond.

At lunch, three dishes and a soup adorned the table. The woman wrung her hands nervously. "I hope it's to your liking..."

Evelyn picked up some greens. "Delicious. Though I've had my fill of lotus seeds."

Alexander chimed in instantly. "Same here."

Lily Waters kept stealing glances at Alexander while nibbling her chopsticks. Evelyn asked softly, "What is it?"

"Big brother..." The girl hesitated. "You won't leave without paying, will you?"

Alexander's heart clenched. "Don't worry. We keep our promises."

Only then did the children happily dig into the fish soup.

Afternoon sunlight danced on the water's surface. Suddenly, Lily tugged Lotus away, returning moments later with a small boat.

"Dr. Carter, want to go boating?" The girl's eyes sparkled.

Alexander puffed out his chest. "I'll row."

Villagers gathered along the shore to watch. Gripping the oars, Alexander gave a mighty pull—

The boat spun in a perfect circle.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Can you even do this?"

Alexander's ears turned pink. "Of course I can. Very much so."
###Chapter 663: Natural Harmony

"This boat..."

"Let me get familiar with it first."

Alexander Hamilton recalled his sailing lessons, leaning forward with taut arms as he dipped the wooden paddle into the water again.

The boat finally stopped spinning in circles—only to lurch straight toward the shore. Had it not been for the stone steps blocking its path, it would have run aground.

Lily Waters stifled a giggle. "Take your time, brother."

Villagers gathering lotus seeds in the distance called out advice:

"The pond water's still—not like the river."

"Use finesse, not brute force."

"Gentler strokes, or you'll tire too soon..."

Their simple words carried generations of wisdom.

Alexander remained unruffled. "Thank you for the guidance."

He lightened his touch, and the boat finally moved straight—until it veered off course again after just a few meters.

Evelyn Carter sat at the bow, her lips curving. "Should I take over? Maybe someone who's never sailed will have better luck."

The rare brightness in her smile warmed his chest. "No need. I'm getting the hang of it." He pointed ahead. "Let's head there. The lotuses have mostly faded—perfect for picking seed pods."

The wooden boat gradually turned under his control.

Seeing them improve, the villagers dispersed to their tasks.

They drifted into dense clusters of lotus plants.

Evelyn sat among emerald leaves, fingertips skimming the water. Sunlight filtered through the foliage, casting golden flecks in her hair.

By the time Alexander found a suitable pod, her hands were already caked with pond mud.

"Let me steady you." He reached out.

She shook her head, bracing against the boat's edge to stand. "Only pick the ripe ones. We can't waste the villagers' hard work."

Their careful selection soon left them both streaked with mud.

Evelyn cradled an armful of pods, absently tucking back a strand of hair. Alexander hesitated, then pointed to his own cheek.

Her reflection in the water revealed muddy streaks crisscrossing her face.

Flustered, she scrubbed at them, her ears turning pink.

The villagers tactfully changed the subject:

"Dr. Carter picked so many!"

"Mr. Hamilton's rowing has really improved."

"Look at that pod—the biggest this year!"

Evelyn glanced down at the plumpest one in her arms, its fresh fragrance enveloping her.

On the return trip, Alexander rowed steadily. "Nothing compares to lotus pods this fresh."

Lily waited on the shore with a clay jar. "They'll last much longer arranged like this." She'd added a few lotus blossoms, creating a striking display.

After dinner, Lily's parents left as usual to tend the fish ponds.

The siblings, flashlights in hand, led them to a small hut with practiced ease.

The creaking wooden door revealed peeling walls under dim light. Faded newspaper patches curled at the edges, the window frame gaped with cracks, and wild grasses sprouted from the mortar.

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, Alexander turned. "I'll fetch something."

Lily briskly prepared bedding, but Alexander returned with Lotus Waters, carrying a tent. "We're sleeping in this tonight."

Evelyn blinked, swallowing her words.
###Chapter 664: Fluttering Hearts

The night deepened, with only a few dim bulbs illuminating the pond.

Alexander Hamilton followed closely behind Lotus Waters, carrying numerous bags as he steadily crossed the narrow bridge. With practiced ease, he set up the tent, laid out the moisture-proof mat, and expertly hung the mosquito net.

Lily and Lotus, sensing the moment, tactfully excused themselves.

The spacious two-person tent was comfortable, with sleeping bags placed at just the right distance apart. Alexander no longer had to worry about an aching back.

Evelyn Carter arched a brow at the increasingly luxurious campsite. "Did you raid an entire outdoor store? It's a miracle the bridge didn't collapse under all that."

Alexander replied earnestly, "Lotus kept glancing back at me while crossing. Probably worried I'd fall in."

As they spoke, the small shelter transformed.

The mosquito net hung at the entrance, its rolled-up curtain allowing Evelyn to leisurely admire the night. Fireflies danced among the grass like scattered stars against the dark expanse of water and sky.

Evelyn, seeing fireflies for the first time, was mesmerized.

"Want to catch a few for the net?" Alexander rolled up his sleeves. "We could watch them while lying down."

"No." Evelyn stopped him immediately. "Fireflies have their own paths. Trapping them only shortens their lives."

Alexander withdrew his hand and sat beside her. "Sorry, I didn't know."

"It's fine. You just—"

Evelyn's words cut off as a dark shadow smacked against the net.

Alexander instantly shielded her.

A green-eyed bat clung upside down to the top of the net, its fangs glinting coldly in the light.

Evelyn gripped Alexander's sleeve. As a doctor, she was no stranger to blood, but rodent-like creatures were her one weakness.

Instead of shooing it away, Alexander gently shook the net. Startled, the bat flew off into the night.

"It mistook the open door for a cave," he explained, feeling the grip on his sleeve loosen—and inexplicably, a pang of disappointment. "It won't come back."

Evelyn straightened her spine. "I wasn't scared. Just startled. I've seen worse in anatomy labs."

She feigned composure as she moved to the other side of the tent, surrendering the best viewing spot.

Alexander's lips quirked. "Of course. Dr. Carter is the bravest."

Evelyn suspected mockery but had no proof. She focused on the fireflies, only to get bitten by mosquitoes several times.

"Did you bring menthol oil?" she finally asked. "Didn't expect this many mosquitoes at night."

After checking the tightly sealed net, Alexander produced insect repellent. "The pharmacy was closed. This is all I have."

Evelyn took it and saw it was a rollerball design. The bites on her neck were out of reach.

Alexander noticed too. "Let me help." He took back the bottle. "I swear I didn’t know it was like this when I bought it."

Too tired to argue, Evelyn swept her hair aside. "Just dab it lightly."

The cool scent of mint filled the air. When Alexander's fingers brushed the delicate skin of her neck, his pulse quickened.

Evelyn waited. "Stuck?"

"No." He drew a slow breath. "You’ve got bites on your ankles too. I’ll get those."

Kneeling, he lightly covered her foot with his palm. Her cool skin made his fingertips burn.

Evelyn jerked her foot back. "I’ll handle those myself."
###Chapter 665: Swept Off Her Feet

Evelyn reached for the mosquito repellent.

Seeing her determination to apply it herself, Alexander reluctantly released her wrist.

Her fingertips had just brushed the bottle when rapid footsteps echoed outside.

Lotus Waters appeared in the doorway, his small frame nearly swallowed by the thick quilt in his arms. "Mom said it gets cold at night. She sent me with extra blankets."

The bedding Lily had brought earlier still sat neatly folded in the corner. This family's thoughtfulness knew no bounds.

Alexander quickly lifted the mosquito netting to accept the offering.

"Thank you," Evelyn said warmly.

Before Lotus could respond, his pupils suddenly constricted. "Freeze!"

Both adults went rigid.

Lotus whispered urgently, "Dr. Carter, there's a centipede by your foot."

Evelyn's face drained of color.

"Is it venomous?"

"Can't tell from here."

Without antivenom at the rural clinic, a bite could be catastrophic.

Evelyn remained perfectly still. From her angle, the creature's position was impossible to see. Sudden movement might provoke an attack.

As Alexander moved to set down the quilt, Lotus sprang forward. The nine-year-old slid his arms beneath Evelyn's knees and back, lifting her clear off the ground with astonishing strength.

A child hoisting a grown woman—Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

"Mr. Hamilton."

Understanding instantly, Alexander transferred Evelyn into his own arms, cradling her securely against his chest.

Lotus squinted at the intruder and gasped. "Poisonous variety!"

The arms around Evelyn's waist tightened reflexively.

She forced calm into her voice. "Try the repellent, Lotus—"

"Shh!"

The boy pressed a finger to his lips before bending with precision to pinch the centipede's second head segment. The glossy black creature writhed violently between his fingers, its countless legs twitching in grotesque waves.

"Drop it!" Evelyn's voice trembled.

Lotus remained unperturbed. "Uncle taught me—gripped here, it can't bite."

The centipede's struggles proved futile against his hold.

Alexander nodded approvingly. "Professional technique."

"You know this method?"

"Standard for arthropods. Never handled centipedes, but mantis shrimp? Plenty."

Evelyn wrinkled her nose and instinctively burrowed closer against him.

Alexander shifted to shield her more completely.

"Lotus!" Lily Waters burst in clutching an earthenware jar. "Get that thing out of here!"

Only then did the boy realize his impropriety. He dashed outside, still holding the captive creature at arm's length.

Evelyn exhaled shakily, loosening her death grip on Alexander's sleeve.

"You two look just like my dad carrying mom away from rats," Lily giggled, swinging the jar playfully.

Evelyn's ears burned as she squirmed to be set down.

Her toes had barely touched the sleeping mat when distant engine roars shattered the night.

Blinding headlights speared through the darkness, flooding the small house with harsh illumination.
###Chapter 666: The Plot Thickens

Alexander's eyes narrowed as he instinctively shielded Evelyn behind him. The blinding headlights formed a menacing circle around the pond like predatory eyes gleaming in the dark.

"Something's wrong," he muttered, his voice low. "At least seven vehicles have surrounded the pond."

Lily's face paled. "It's those thugs!" She clenched her fists. "Lotus, take Dr. Carter and the others back to the clinic through the shortcut!"

Evelyn's heart raced. "What thugs?"

"Developers from the city," Lily explained hurriedly. "They came last month, demanding to fill the pond for a villa project. They even pushed down Elder Thompson..."

Without hesitation, Alexander scooped Evelyn into his arms despite her just having put on her shoes. "Lily, come with us."

"No!" The stubborn girl shook her head. "I need to warn my parents and neighbors." Like a swift deer, she vanished into the night.

Lotus bit his lip nervously, his small hands trembling.

Grabbing only two phones, Alexander followed the boy with Evelyn in his arms. His dress shoes sank into the muddy path with each step, the squelching sound echoing in the quiet night.

Cradled securely against his chest, Evelyn could feel the steady warmth of his body. The night breeze carried the faint scent of reeds as it brushed her cheeks.

"Put me down," she whispered, her ears burning.

"Don't move." His arms tightened. "The path's too slippery."

Under the moonlight, Lotus navigated the rugged trail with goat-like agility. That boy could've been an athlete if he ever left these mountains.

As they rounded a reed thicket, the distant headlights faded into pinpricks of light. Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Lotus, who exactly are these developers?"

The boy didn't slow his pace. "Dad said they're from... the Liang Corporation."

Alexander froze.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn felt his muscles tense instantly.

"The Liangs..." His voice turned icy. "That's my uncle's company."

Evelyn gasped. The conspiracy had hit shockingly close to home.

Lotus glanced back in confusion. "You know them, Mr. Hamilton?"

"More than know them." Alexander's laugh held no warmth. "We're family."

His sharp gaze glittered like honed steel in the darkness. Suddenly Evelyn understood why Alexander had been exiled to this remote village—it was all part of the game.

"Back to the clinic first," she said decisively. "We need to strategize."

Alexander shook his head. "No time." His eyes tracked the distant headlights. "They didn't come all this way to leave empty-handed."

A deafening explosion shattered the night. Flames erupted in the distance, painting half the sky crimson.

The direction of Lily's home.

Lotus's bloodcurdling scream pierced the air. "Sister—!"
###Chapter 667: The Father-in-Law of Hamilton Group's CEO

Evelyn reached into Alexander's coat pocket, her fingertips brushing against the cold metal casing of his phone.

"Dead battery," she sighed.

Alexander gave a wry smile. "All the chargers are in the car."

Lotus nervously twisted the hem of his shirt. "Dr. Carter, those men were really scary. They said they worked for Hamilton Group and had powerful connections in the city."

"Hamilton Group?" Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly.

Lotus nodded vigorously. "I found one of their business cards—it said Hamilton Group, Hudson City. My sister said they just want to drive us out and take our land."

Alexander's expression darkened instantly.

"Impossible," he stated firmly. "Hamilton Group has no projects in this area."

Evelyn looked thoughtful. "Could someone be impersonating your company?"

"We'll have to investigate," Alexander lowered his voice. "But Hamilton Group would never do something like this."

Lotus suddenly stopped walking. "How can you be so sure, mister?"

Alexander cleared his throat. "I have friends who work there."

The boy's face fell.

"Those men said..." He bit his lip. "Their boss is the father-in-law of Hamilton's big boss—even more powerful than Mr. Hamilton himself."

The air turned icy.

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged a glance, both seeing the answer in each other's eyes.

Leonard Laurent.

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "Their boss's last name is Laurent?"

"Yes!" Lotus exclaimed. "They always called him Mr. Laurent on the phone."

Alexander crouched down. "What exactly have they done?"

The boy's gaze dimmed. "It's no use... They've destroyed so many homes in our village. Big Brother said he'd sue them, but then..."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "What happened?"

"Big Brother disappeared." Lotus's voice trembled. "When the police found him... he couldn't speak anymore. His legs were broken too."

The night wind rustled through fallen leaves.

Alexander's knuckles turned white.

"Animals," he spat through clenched teeth.

Evelyn gently touched his arm. "Let's get to the village first."

Suddenly, Lotus grabbed Alexander's sleeve. "Mister... do you know Mr. Hamilton?"

A brief silence.

"I do," Alexander said softly. "I'm Alexander Hamilton."

The boy's eyes widened as he took two steps back.

"Don't be afraid," Evelyn quickly knelt beside him. "Alexander is here to help you."

Tears welled up in Lotus's eyes. "Really?"

Alexander nodded solemnly.

"I swear on my name as CEO of Hamilton Group—those people will pay for what they've done."

Distant barking echoed through the night.

Lotus wiped his eyes. "We should hurry. It's getting dark."

The three quickened their pace.

Evelyn kept her voice low. "Leonard is trying to drag you into this mess."

Alexander's laugh was cold. "He's digging his own grave."

"That missing college student—"

"I'll investigate thoroughly." Alexander's gaze turned stormy. "No one gets away with this."

The village lights grew closer.

Lotus stopped abruptly. "Dr. Carter... Mr. Hamilton... you'll really help us?"

Alexander ruffled the boy's hair.

"Not just help." His voice was steel. "I'll make them crawl here to apologize."

In the darkness, his eyes gleamed like honed blades.
###Chapter 668: I'm Alexander Hamilton. Who Dares Touch Me?

Evelyn Carter sensed something amiss. "Did the police say how that brother got injured?"

"They said it was a car accident." Lotus Waters kicked a pebble with his small foot. "Elder Thompson thinks bad people did it, but the hospital report says it was just an accident. His whole family moved away to a big city for treatment."

Alexander Hamilton's expression darkened. "Evil always meets its reckoning."

Lotus scoffed. "They've done terrible things for years with no consequences."

As they rounded the mountain pass, the village came into view. Lotus was about to point the way when seven or eight rough-looking young men appeared.

The boy froze, tiny hands clutching his shirt hem.

Alexander subtly positioned himself between the child and the threat. Evelyn quickly put on her shoes, only to be pulled behind Alexander's broad back.

"Can I help you gentlemen?" His voice could have frozen hell.

The leader spat. "Think you're hot shit with your fancy car? Get lost!" He jabbed a finger at Alexander. "We're gonna teach you a lesson today!"

Before he finished speaking, the thug flew backward, landing hard in the mud.

"Lotus, take Dr. Carter and run!" Alexander barked.

"What about you?" Both Evelyn and Lotus cried out simultaneously.

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "They've been shouting my name loud enough."

Evelyn grabbed his wrist. "These people don't even know who you are!"

The gang leader scrambled up, face twisted with rage. "Kill them all!"

Lotus yanked Evelyn away like a young panther. Alexander felt the fading warmth in his palm, momentarily dazed.

"Stop!" Evelyn realized Alexander had slowed his pace.

He turned, eyes glinting dangerously. "Didn't you want to see the real Alexander?"

Her heart clenched. "Don't be reckless!"

"Lotus." Alexander pushed Evelyn forward. "Protect the doctor."

The boy nodded fiercely, his gaze far older than his years.

As Alexander turned, Evelyn's choked cry followed him. He charged toward the pursuers without looking back, his white shirt snapping in the wind.

Lotus practically dragged Evelyn along. Her socks were soaked through with mud, but she ran silently beside the determined child.

"We'll find help for brother!" Lotus panted, his small hand gripping hers painfully.

The sounds of fighting and screams echoed behind them. Evelyn didn't dare look back, tears blurring her vision. She finally understood - the formidable Alexander Hamilton of legend had never truly disappeared.
###Chapter 669: Alexander in Peril

The night was ink-black. The path through the reed marshes grew narrower.

Sharp grass blades left fine scratches on Evelyn's cheeks, but she couldn't help looking back.

Alexander's figure had vanished into the darkness. Only distant, chaotic footsteps echoed through the night.

The local thugs clearly didn't know the village well. After losing their trail, they'd immediately turned to corner Alexander.

"Dr. Carter, hurry!" Lotus tugged her wrist, urgency lacing his voice.

The dim bulb of the rural clinic flickered in the distance.

Evelyn's legs felt leaden. Each step was an effort. She bit her lip hard, refusing to make a sound.

Lotus suddenly stopped. "There's a ditch ahead."

A two-meter-wide trench stretched before them, glinting faintly in the moonlight.

"Let me help." Without hesitation, Lotus crouched and formed a step with his interlaced hands.

As Evelyn stepped up, the boy pushed with surprising strength. She vaulted across, barely landing on the opposite side.

Lotus leaped over effortlessly and pulled her into another sprint.

The clinic finally came into view.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she plugged in her phone. The moment the screen lit up, she dialed emergency services.

"Hello, I need to report—"

After hanging up, she called Emily Zade.

"Mrs. Hamilton?" Emily's voice held surprise.

"Alexander's in danger." Evelyn kept her explanation brief, voice taut.

A beat of silence. Then: "I'm on my way."

Lotus stood nearby, eyes bright. "Dr. Carter, how can I help?"

"Meet Emily at the village entrance." Evelyn touched his head. "She'll be in a beige suit with several men in work uniforms."

The boy shot off like an arrow.

Evelyn looked down at her battered hands, suddenly remembering Alexander's final glance.

He could have escaped with them.

The clinic clock ticked loudly, each second torturing her nerves.

Villagers still gossiped about that college student's fate.

"Heard they broke his leg..."

"Serves him right for meddling..."

Evelyn stood abruptly, then collapsed back into her chair.

She couldn't take risks. Alexander had given her this chance. She had to wait for backup.

Moonlight streamed through the window, painting the floor ghostly pale.

Evelyn clutched her phone until her knuckles whitened.

Alexander's words surfaced in her mind: "No one dares touch a Hamilton in Hudson City."

But this wasn't Hudson City.
###Chapter 670: Do As I Say

Even Alexander Hamilton, the legendary figure of Hudson High School No.5, couldn't hold his ground against overwhelming numbers.

Backed by Leonard Laurent's influence, the thugs had no qualms about assaulting even college students. This time, they vowed to make an example out of him...

Evelyn Carter's grip on her phone tightened, her palm slick with cold sweat.

Despite their past conflicts, Alexander had saved them by the pond. She couldn't just stand by and watch him get hurt.

That long-forgotten number in her contacts was now her only hope.

The call connected almost instantly.

"Evelyn~" Lydia Laurent's saccharine voice dripped through the receiver. "What brings you to call so late?"

Evelyn tore through the facade. "You know about your father using the Hamilton Group's name to get away with murder, don't you?"

"Oh, Evelyn, how could you accuse my father like—"

"Enough." Evelyn's laugh was icy. "That look you gave me on the street last time showed your true colors. Who are you pretending for now?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

Lydia's voice dropped, venom seeping through. "Why were you there? Did you bring the police? Or was Alexander with you?"

Evelyn gave her no time to think. "Your father's men are surrounding Alexander right now. I've already called the police. If you don't want him behind bars, call them off. Now."

She hung up without waiting for a response.

Less than a minute later, Lydia called back.

"Evelyn!" The mask was gone, her voice laced with malice. "You think the police can stop this?"

"We'll see." Evelyn's tone was glacial. "Remember—if anything happens to Alexander, your father will be the first one in handcuffs."

She disconnected again.

At dawn, Lotus Waters came sprinting into the clinic, breathless.

"Dr. Carter!" His face was flushed. "The police and backup are here!"

Evelyn shot to her feet. "Where's Alexander?"

The boy avoided her gaze. "H-he hasn't been found yet..."

"Tell me the truth!" She seized his shoulders.

"The lilies by the pond..." His voice trembled. "They're all flattened. The police are... dredging the water."

Dredging?

The world spun. Evelyn staggered toward the door.

"No!" Lotus threw himself in her path. "Big Brother made me promise to protect you! It's too dangerous!"

"Move!" Her voice was raw.

She had to see for herself.

Even if... it was the worst possible outcome.
###Chapter 671: He's Someone Very Important

"I'm an adult now, just like your parents. I have the right to go in." Evelyn's voice trembled slightly but remained resolute.

Lotus stood like an immovable wall, his small frame barricading the clinic door. Evelyn's fingertips turned cold with frustration, yet she couldn't budge the determined child.

Hurried footsteps echoed in the distance.

Evelyn looked up to see Elder Thompson rushing toward them, his silver hair glaring under the morning sun. Deep worry lines etched his weathered face.

"Alexander?" Her voice nearly cracked. "How is he?"

The elder avoided her gaze and sighed heavily. "Lotus and Lily came to me in the middle of the night, saying something terrible happened..."

Evelyn dug her nails into her palms, numb to the pain. "Did you come from the Lotus Pond?"

Silently, Lotus stepped aside.

"The police are here," Elder Thompson wiped his brow. "The commotion last night woke the whole village. We barely hid when their cars rolled in..."

Her heart stuttered.

"The pond's edge... it's covered in blood." The elder's voice shook. "They've cordoned it off as a crime scene..."

Lotus paled. He understood better than anyone what those bloodstains meant.

Evelyn's throat tightened. "Did they catch anyone?"

"Those monsters vanished like smoke." The elder clenched his teeth. "An ambulance came, along with someone in a white coat..."

"A medical examiner?" Her whisper barely carried.

The elder nodded uncertainly. "That's what they called him."

Darkness edged Evelyn's vision as she swayed.

Lotus and the elder steadied her. The old man's eyes reddened. "Dr. Carter, Mr. Hamilton..."

"He'll be fine." Her grip on the table turned her knuckles white. "He promised me."

Lotus clutched her sleeve. "Dr. Carter..."

She forced a smile. "I'm alright. Elder, could you gather more information?"

"Of course." He nodded vigorously. "Mr. Hamilton's a good man. Heaven will protect him."

Only after he left did Evelyn collapse into a chair. The clinic's silence pressed in, broken only by her ragged breathing.

"Lotus," she murmured, "go stay with Lily."

The boy shook his head stubbornly. "I told big brother I'd protect you."

Evelyn stared at the dried blood on her hands—remnants of last night's escape. Without Lotus, she might have...

"You've done wonderfully." She ruffled his hair.

The door burst open as three nurses rushed in, gasping at her injuries.

"Dr. Carter! What happened—"

"Why isn't Mr. Hamilton with—"

Their flurry of questions stabbed like knives until Elder Thompson's wife arrived with steaming corn and sweet potatoes.

"Doctor, you should eat something."

Evelyn declined, handing the food to Lotus. The boy devoured it, then choked when he saw her standing.

"Dr. Carter?"

She passed him water, her gaze steady. "Come with me to the pond."

"You're worried about big brother?"

"Yes." Her whisper barely carried. "He's someone very important to me."
###Chapter 672: I Refuse to Believe It's Him

Lotus Waters clutched the water glass, her fingers trembling slightly. She bit her lip before finally relenting. "Alright, I'll go with you."

They hurried along the same path from last night. Daylight made it easier to take shortcuts, and soon they reached the edge of Lotus Pond.

Police tape cordoned off the entire area. An officer blocked Evelyn Carter's path. "Crime scene. No civilians allowed."

Evelyn tightened her grip on her clothes. "I'm here to find someone."

Secretary Emily Zade turned at the sound of her voice and quickly approached. "This is Mrs. Hamilton, our CEO's wife."

The title sounded vaguely familiar to Lotus, but her mind was too consumed with Alexander Hamilton's safety to dwell on it.

The officer motioned for Evelyn to follow. "Mrs. Hamilton, we need your help with identification."

Evelyn's fingers turned icy. Emily's face drained of color.

There was no body bag on a stretcher. Instead, the officer handed her an evidence bag. "Is this your husband's ring?"

Sunlight glared harshly as the wedding band glinted coldly inside the plastic.

She had discarded hers long ago. Yet he had kept his all this time, carrying it with him.

"It's... our old wedding ring," Evelyn managed, her throat tight.

The officer noted this before walking away. Emily whispered, "Mr. Hamilton always kept it in his suit's inner pocket, inside a velvet pouch."

Evelyn stared at the still water. So this was how deeply he had hidden it.

"Still no leads?" Her voice came out hoarse.

Emily shook her head. "They've even brought in search dogs. The underwater terrain is complicated..."

"Let me go." Lotus suddenly spoke up. "I'm a strong swimmer, and I know these waters."

The police initially refused but reluctantly agreed after consulting villagers.

Half an hour later, Lotus emerged dripping wet, her lips blue. "There's... someone down there. Tangled in the lotus roots."

The scene erupted into chaos. Officers mobilized toward the area she indicated.

Evelyn's vision darkened. Emily caught her just as her knees buckled.

"It might not be him..." Emily's voice shook.

Evelyn dug her nails into her palms. "Impossible."

Across the pond, officers lifted a black body bag onto the shore.

A strange calm settled over Evelyn. The officer approached. "Mrs. Hamilton, we need you to confirm."

Only when she took a step did she realize her legs had gone numb.
###Chapter 673 I Don't Want to Burden You

Emily Zade stepped forward to block Evelyn's path when she noticed her pale complexion. "Mrs. Hamilton, please stay back. Let me handle this."

Evelyn shook her head, her eyes hollow. "I need to see for myself."

"But—" Emily's forehead glistened with sweat. "You're in no condition—"

"Emily." Evelyn's voice was feather-light as she interrupted. "I've already lost too many people."

Memories flashed through her mind—her father's hand clutching hers in his final moments, the child she'd never held, every word Alexander had spoken to her in the mountains.

If even he was...

The medical examiner pushed through the crowd and removed his mask. "No identification needed. This body's been submerged for over a month."

Evelyn's knees buckled.

Emily caught her, trembling. "It's not Mr. Hamilton! Do you hear me? It's not him!"

Evelyn gasped for air like a drowning woman breaking the surface.

But where was Alexander?

Emily's suit jacket was caked with mud. She wiped her face. "I'll question more villagers."

"Okay." Evelyn nodded weakly.

Emily suddenly grinned. "When Mr. Hamilton returns, he'd better reimburse me for this suit."

Seeing her disheveled state, Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "If he refuses, I'll fight him for you."

"Deal!" Emily's eyes brightened.

"Dr. Carter!" Lily's voice carried from a distance. "Big brother is back!"

Evelyn whirled around.

Alexander limped toward them, his shirt unrecognizable beneath layers of grime. His gaze locked onto Evelyn through the crowd.

"Mr. Hamilton!" Emily sprinted to him.

Medical staff swarmed forward, but Alexander raised a hand to stop them, his eyes never leaving Evelyn.

Evelyn took step after measured step toward him.

"Evelyn." His voice was rough.

"Hmm."

"I'm okay." He hesitated, suddenly flustered. "Not that you should care... I mean—"

Watching his awkwardness, Evelyn nodded gently. "I understand."

Alexander exhaled in relief. "I don't want to burden you."

Evelyn studied his mud-streaked face. This man raised in luxury had slept on hard planks, used primitive latrines, endured insect bites without complaint.

"Evelyn?" He frowned at the cuts on her face. "You're hurt?"

"Minor scratches." Her voice softened. "Your leg—"

"It's fine—" Alexander cut off with a sharp inhale.

Emily called out, "The ambulance is right there. Both of you should get checked."

The doctor examined him and frowned. "Mr. Hamilton, your ankle needs realignment, but we have no anesthesia here."

"Do it." Alexander remained expressionless.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Let's go to the town hospital."

"No." He shook his head. "They might come back for revenge."

Emily turned to Evelyn. "Mrs. Hamilton, what do you think?"
###Chapter 674: Bloodstained Truth

Evelyn crouched down, her fingertips lightly touching Alexander's right leg.

"Bone's intact. Just a sprain." She withdrew her hand. "But orthopedics isn't my specialty."

Emily hesitated. "Madam, should we handle it here?"

Alexander rolled up his pant leg without hesitation, revealing a swollen, bruised ankle. "This is nothing."

Evelyn frowned. "It'll hurt."

"I've endured worse." A faint smile tugged at his lips.

Emily signaled the accompanying physician to step forward.

The middle-aged doctor glanced at Evelyn in surprise. "Madam Hamilton is a doctor too?"

"OB-GYN." Her reply was clipped.

"With clinical experience, you should be able to treat a sprain, right?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

She could. But years in obstetrics had weakened her strength. And Alexander's legs were so long...

Alexander smoothly intervened. "We appreciate your expertise, Doctor."

Emily quickly handed over the medical kit. "Thank you for your help."

The doctor skillfully realigned the bone, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "No wonder Madam Hamilton declined. This work is physically demanding for female physicians."

Emily promptly led the doctor away.

Alexander sat on a rock, his pant leg rolled to the knee, exposing scar-riddled calves and forearms.

"I can go to the town hospital—"

"These wounds need immediate attention." Evelyn had already opened the medical kit, retrieving disinfectants.

Her movements were gentle as she cleared debris from the injuries, irrigating them with saline.

"Does it hurt?"

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "Tolerable."

"I need to apply more pressure for thorough disinfection."

"Understood."

After treating his legs, Evelyn's gaze lingered on the old scars along his forearm—remnants of a fire.

Now fresh wounds marred the same skin.

All because of her.

"Rest if you're tired," Alexander murmured.

"Stay still."

She continued working.

A police officer approached to inquire about the previous night's events.

Alexander summarized succinctly: "They mistook me for a lawyer hired by the villagers. Wanted to make an example of me. I escaped by jumping into the pond."

"Did you collapse the lotus plants?"

"We did."

Once the officer left, Evelyn and Emily exchanged glances.

"What else happened?" Alexander instantly sensed the tension.

Emily took a deep breath. "While searching for you...the police found a body in the pond."

Alexander's pupils constricted. "The Laurents dared to kill?"

"Estimated time of death was two to three months ago," Evelyn added. "The critical point is—they operated under Hamilton Group's name."

Alexander's expression darkened.

"The entire village believes Hamilton Group committed murder," Emily said tightly.

"Identify the deceased first." Alexander's voice was grave. "A life is at stake."

Emily nodded. "The freezer's been delivered to the clinic. The支教teacher matter requires more time. As for the company—"

"Keep close watch on Laurent Enterprises." Alexander's instruction was brief.

After seeing Emily's team off, Elder Thompson arrived with Lily and Lotus Waters in tow.

"Mr. Hamilton!" The village elder wiped his tears. "You've no idea how frantic Dr. Carter was—didn't sleep a wink all night..."
###Chapter 675: May I Make a Request?

Alexander Hamilton studied Evelyn Carter's face for a moment, as if verifying the village elder's words.

Lotus Waters pressed his lips together, small hands nervously twisting the hem of his shirt. "I'm sorry, brother. I didn't take good care of Dr. Carter."

"Silly boy." Evelyn ruffled his hair. "Without you leading the way, we might still be lost in the mountains. These minor scratches are nothing—you saved our lives."

The boy's eyes brightened.

Alexander crouched to meet Lotus at eye level. "We wouldn't have found the village without you. You're more reliable than GPS."

A sudden thought struck him, and he reached for his pocket.

Evelyn swiftly pressed his wallet into his palm. "Stop fidgeting. Does your foot not hurt anymore?"

"Don't worry, Dr. Carter," Lily Waters chimed in. "My father knows bone-setting. Last time, he fixed Uncle Wang's cow's leg with just one snap."

Elder Thompson nodded vigorously. "Our village remedies work wonders."

Alexander waved his hands. "No need, I'm perfectly fine." He turned to the children. "Where are your parents? Was everyone in the village alright last night?"

"The adults are all repairing the boats," Lily said, her small face falling. "Those bad people drilled holes in the bottoms."

Alexander's expression darkened.

He pulled out a thick stack of cash and handed it to Lily. "Payment for the grass weavings, plus lodging fees."

Both children's eyes widened. They'd only seen that much money on television.

"This is too much!" Lily extracted two bills and pushed the rest back. "The weavings aren't worth this."

Alexander pressed the money into her hands. "Consider the rest a deposit. When we return to see the fireflies, we'll stay at your place again. And get a new boat."

Lily bit her lip, looking to Evelyn for guidance.

"Keep it," Evelyn said softly. "A new boat will be safer."

Lily bowed deeply, pulling her brother down with her. The adults smiled.

"Would you like to attend school in the city?" Alexander asked abruptly.

Lotus blinked in confusion. Lily's eyes lit up before dimming again. "But what about Mom and Dad?"

"The whole family," Alexander stated plainly.

Elder Thompson slapped his thigh excitedly. "Quick, say yes! This is an incredible opportunity!"

"Thank you, brother," Lily said solemnly. "But we need to ask our parents first."

"Come find me anytime." Alexander tousled her hair.

When the others had left, the clinic grew quiet.

Evelyn handed him a cup of medicinal brew. "Thank you."

Alexander downed it in one gulp. "For what?"

"For looking after my family." Evelyn met his gaze directly. "And for coming here with me. I know you were worried I'd—"

Alexander interrupted suddenly. "May I make a request?"

Evelyn took half a step back, wary. "State your terms first."

"I need a bath." Alexander plucked at his sweat-dampened shirt. "At this rate, I'll start fermenting."

Evelyn glanced at her own mud-splattered trousers. "Let's go to town. There's a budget hotel."

"Right now, I'd be grateful for a bucket of water," Alexander said wryly.

As Evelyn helped him outside, Alexander bore most of his own weight, careful not to lean on her.

Elder Thompson hurried after them. "Tomorrow's the annual temple fair in town—it's quite lively!"

"Temple fair?" Alexander arched an eyebrow.

"Yes! Stalls stretch all the way down the street..."

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged a glance.
###Chapter 676: Every Road Leads to a Dead End

"Tomorrow's the big market day." Evelyn steadied Alexander as they walked toward the village entrance, smoothing his crumpled shirt collar. "People from nearby villages will come. The town will be packed."

She had come to the mountains to escape her heartbreak, keeping local customs at arm's length. But last night's harrowing experience sparked her first real interest in such folk traditions.

Alexander mused, "Why don't we stay in town a couple days?" He glanced at his mud-splattered trousers. "Might as well experience the market firsthand."

Evelyn gave a soft "Mm-hmm."

Before leaving, Emily had the driver park their SUV at the village entrance. Evelyn took the keys, testing the unfamiliar vehicle's handling on the dirt road with quick adaptability.

The mountain path to town twisted unevenly. With his swollen ankle, Alexander could only lean in the passenger seat, watching Evelyn's steady hands on the wheel.

"Didn't know you drove this well," he remarked, surprise coloring his tone.

Evelyn kept her eyes on the thickening traffic. "An OB-GYN's hands must be steady." She swerved around a darting motorcycle. "Compared to surgical scalpels, a steering wheel's child's play."

Market stalls were already being set up. Watching the bustling crowds through the window, Alexander suddenly said, "I think I'm starting to understand what you meant about simple living."

Evelyn shot him a glance.

"No scheming. No watching your back." He nodded toward street vendors hawking wares. "Crude conditions, but at least it's real."

"Which is why we don't fit." Evelyn braked at a red light. "You have your world. I have mine."

Alexander chuckled. "Funny—I'm finding your world has its charms."

"Could the young master Hamilton tolerate weekly showers?"

"If it's for you," he turned to meet her gaze, "I'd try."

Evelyn nearly hit the gas instead of the brake. "Is your wound infected? Running a fever?"

Alexander grimaced. "Maybe. But I'd never have believed Leonard dared exploit my name for his power plays." His engagement to Lydia had ended long ago.

"Emily will handle it." Evelyn's voice softened. "The villagers just want to keep their homes."

The budget hotel's sign gleamed a faded yellow in sunlight. Alexander frowned upon exiting but held his tongue.

"There's a clothing market across the street." Evelyn pointed to the crowded mall. "Given the circumstances, can you make do?"

Alexander nodded eagerly. His soiled, wrinkled outfit had become unbearable.

At the mall entrance, he froze. "My wallet's still at the clinic."

Evelyn exhaled. "I thought something was wrong."

"This isn't wrong?" Alexander paled. The Hamilton Group CEO, penniless.

Her lips twitched. "I brought cash." She produced folded bills from her pocket. "Consider it repaying you for those clothes."

His eyes darkened. "It's a loan." Stubbornly, he added, "I'll repay you immediately when we return."

Inside the packed mall, Alexander grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "Stay close." He shielded her through the crowd until spotting the merchandise—then abruptly released her.

Rows of men's underwear dangled overhead. Evelyn turned away, ears pinkening.
###Chapter 677: Dressed for Your Eyes Only

Evelyn Carter calmly organized the shopping bags. "Since we're here, let's get what we need. We'll need all new undergarments anyway. We can pick separately."

She efficiently selected a set of lingerie without glancing around.

Alexander Hamilton stood in the men's section, brows slightly furrowed. Accustomed to private tailoring, he was unfamiliar with self-service shopping. His long fingers hovered over the shelves before finally picking up black briefs. "Will... these work?"

Evelyn gave them a fleeting look, the tips of her ears turning pink. "How should I know? That's your decision."

A sales associate approached with a knowing smile. "With your physique, sir, anything would look good. But..." She glanced meaningfully at Evelyn. "What matters most is your wife's preference."

"We're not—" Evelyn began, then decided against explaining further.

Amusement flickered in Alexander's eyes as he casually added two more pairs. "These will do."

At checkout, the cashier's smile faltered when Evelyn pulled out her wallet. "How modern—the wife handling finances. Such a loving couple."

Evelyn swiped her card expressionlessly and hurried Alexander out.

"She's right," Alexander said suddenly.

Evelyn paused. "About what?"

"The household finances should be managed by the lady of the house." His gaze burned into her.

She turned away. "Don't joke. I can't even keep track of my own paycheck."

"I believe in you," he said earnestly. "You excel at everything you set your mind to."

The motel receptionist beamed. "Only one king suite left! Lucky you!"

Evelyn frowned. "No twin beds available?"

"With the festival crowd, you're lucky to get this." The woman eyed them. "Newlyweds still shy?"

During check-in, the clerk scrutinized Evelyn's ID. "You're paying, miss?"

Evelyn snatched the keycard and practically fled upstairs.

As they rounded the stairwell, the receptionist's voice carried: "Kids these days—that man dressed like a CEO but made his girlfriend pay..."

A housekeeper chimed in: "Did you see her car? Probably some sugar momma with her boy toy..."

Alexander arched a brow. "Shall I clarify?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "It'll only make it worse."

"At least I still pass for young," he said wryly.

The room door revealed their next obstacle—a fully transparent glass shower stall.

Evelyn turned on her heel. "I'll take a walk."

"Wait." Alexander grabbed their new bedsheet. "We'll use this as a curtain."

He deftly draped the fabric over the glass and turned to Evelyn. "You first."

She shook her head. "You're injured. Go ahead."

Steam fogged the glass, blurring the silhouette within. Evelyn sat rigidly on the bed's edge, back turned, fingers twisting her hem.

The water stopped. Alexander emerged in a towel, droplets trailing from his hair. "All yours."

Evelyn grabbed her clothes but froze at the sight of him—
###Chapter 678: Alone Together

The hotel towel was ridiculously short. The one around Alexander's waist barely covered his essentials, leaving his toned abdomen completely exposed.

Even though they'd once been intimate, Evelyn felt unbearably awkward now.

The romantic hotel setting made it worse.

Memories of that night in the capital flooded her mind uncontrollably.

"You..." She turned her face away. "Aren't you cold?"

"Just took a hot shower." His Adam's apple bobbed. "I'm burning up."

Evelyn brushed past him quickly, leaving a trail of floral perfume. "I'm going to shower. Put some clothes on."

The bathroom was steamy.

As Evelyn undressed, she noticed how slippery the floor was. Barefoot on the tiles, she'd just applied shampoo when—

"Ah!"

Her feet slid out from under her. She fell backward.

The expected pain never came.

A strong arm caught her waist firmly.

The shower still poured down, drenching them both instantly. Water droplets rolled off Alexander's collarbone onto her bare shoulder.

"You okay?" His voice was rough.

Only then did Evelyn realize how dangerous their position was.

"Let go!" She shoved him away. In the chaos, someone's fingers grazed skin, sending shivers down spines.

Alexander fled like his life depended on it.

When the door closed, their panicked eyes met again.

This time, Evelyn reacted faster—slamming the door with a bang.

The running water drowned out her pounding heart.

She lingered in the bathroom for nearly an hour.

"Evelyn." A light knock.

"Hmm?"

"The floor's slippery." His voice was muffled through the door. "Use my clothes to step on."

His tall silhouette showed through the frosted glass.

Evelyn bit her lip, staring at the pile of clothes on the floor.

Reason eventually overcame shame.

"...Toss them in."

When the door cracked open, she caught a glimpse of his reddened ears.

By the time Evelyn emerged, Alexander was standing by the window, letting cold air blow on him.

Her sneeze made him shut it immediately.

Then the world spun—

He scooped her up bridal-style and gently placed her on the bed.

"The clothes fit well." An awkward subject change.

Evelyn finally noticed how good that cheap sweatshirt looked on him. With his broad shoulders and narrow waist, even bargain-bin clothing seemed tailor-made.

"Yeah." She studied her toes.

Suddenly, Alexander knelt on one knee and grasped her ankle.

"Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?"

Evelyn tried to pull away. "Just a minor sprain."

His fingertips were scalding.

"It's swollen." His brow furrowed. "From yesterday?"

"When I was playing with Lotus..."

"Wait here."

He grabbed his jacket and bolted out. When he returned half an hour later with ointment, sweat still gleamed at his temples.
###Chapter 679: I'll Stay With You

"Thank God mobile payments work here." Alexander Hamilton unwrapped the medicine box, extracting a cotton swab. "Otherwise I'd have to swallow my pride and ask someone for cash."

He knelt down with the gentleness of handling fragile porcelain.

Evelyn Carter reached out. "I can do it myself."

"My hands are steadier." He dodged her fingers, dabbing the antiseptic lightly on her wound. "Tell me if it hurts."

Evelyn studied his downcast face.

His lashes cast delicate shadows under the lamplight, the sharp bridge of his nose perfectly defined.

The familiarity of this scene made her chest constrict.

"What's wrong?" Alexander looked up, noticing her reddened eyes. "Did I hurt you?"

"No." She turned away. "Your leg injury..."

"It's fine. I was careful during the shower." Suddenly he chuckled. "Want to know what the front desk ladies called me?"

Evelyn raised a brow. "They still think you're..."

"A gigolo." Alexander nodded shamelessly. "When I asked for the pharmacy location, I mentioned buying medicine for my girlfriend. On my return, I overheard them praising how good service standards have become for male escorts these days."

Amusement danced in his eyes.

Evelyn's lips twitched. "Should we clarify?"

"Clarify what?" Alexander countered. "Let them keep believing I'm a gigolo, or tell them we're actually..."

He deliberately trailed off.

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

"So," he spread his hands cheerfully, "being a conscientious gigolo isn't so bad."

That night after washing up, Alexander suddenly leaned in. "Dr. Carter, need any nighttime services?"

Evelyn choked on air.

He patted her back, laughing. "So easy to tease?"

"You rich people..." She gasped between coughs. "Really know how to play."

"Currently I'm a gigolo." He handed her tissues. "Professional service."

As Evelyn wiped her eyes, she noticed he'd used clothing to demarcate a boundary across the bed.

"I promise not to cross the line." He gestured. "Wounded privilege, okay?"

The sofa was too small. The floor too hard.

Studying his profile outlined by bedside light, Evelyn gave a soft "Mm."

"Can't sleep?" She caught him staring.

"No." Alexander's gaze burned. "Feels like we're back to..."

"It's not the same." She cut him off. "That was obligation. This is..."

"Is what?"

"An accident." She turned away. "How long are you staying?"

"Through year-end."

Evelyn whipped back around. "What about the company?"

"Remote work." His expression turned serious. "Leonard Laurent won't let this go. In my absence, he might tamper with medical supplies."

Her pupils contracted.

"Medical malpractice, blame shifted to the clinic." His voice lowered. "You can't guard against this."

Only the hum of AC filled the room.

"I can commute daily." Alexander said quietly. "Consider it...life experience."

Moonlight sliced through curtain gaps, painting a silver line across the floor.
###Chapter 680: A Fleeting Touch

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Carter remained deep in sleep.

The sound of running water from the bathroom gradually roused her. She realized she'd overslept. A dull ache spread through her body as if she'd been run over by a truck.

Alexander Hamilton emerged with damp hair just as she sat up, rubbing her lower back.

"Did I wake you?" He shook droplets from his bangs. "I wanted to let you sleep longer."

Before Evelyn could respond, firecrackers exploded outside with deafening cracks.

The sudden noise jolted them both awake. Alexander instinctively covered his ears.

"The temple fair has started." Evelyn parted the curtains slightly. "Those are ceremonial firecrackers to welcome the deities."

They hurriedly got ready and bought freshly fried pastries from a street vendor. The golden crust cracked open to reveal sweet red bean paste that stretched into silken threads with each bite.

The main thoroughfare was already packed with crowds.

Alexander shielded Evelyn from the jostling masses, his arm a protective barrier around her waist. Through the fabric, she could feel the heat radiating from his skin.

"I'll get soy milk." Evelyn seized the chance to step sideways.

But as she turned, two playing children came barreling toward her.

"Watch out!"

Alexander grabbed her wrist. In that split second, the second child collided with them.

Evelyn tumbled straight into his chest.

Her lips brushed against the prominent curve of his Adam's apple.

Both froze.

Alexander's throat moved with a swallow. Flustered, Evelyn reached for a tissue but found her pockets empty.

"Use this." Suddenly he lifted her hand and, under her stunned gaze, gently wiped her fingers across his throat.

"Since...you already got pastry sugar on me anyway."

Her ears burned. Just as she tried to pull away, twin voices piped up behind them.

"Sorry, miss!" The identical boys chorused.

Their mother offered profuse apologies before enthusiastically explaining the fair's traditions: "The fortune sticks are especially accurate today, though the lines are terribly long..."

Evelyn's gaze drifted toward the distant temple veiled in incense smoke, her expression softening.

"Want to go?" Alexander asked.

She gave a small nod. "I never believed in these things before...but now I'd like to try."

The deity procession advanced in a vibrant parade. Bare-chested men carried the sacred palanquin, their bronzed skin gleaming under the sun. Elderly participants matched the younger carriers' steady pace without faltering.

"Village life builds endurance," Evelyn observed. "Farmers have far more strength than office workers."

Alexander studied her profile thoughtfully. "You seem...familiar with this?"

Her eyes focused beyond the bustling crowd into the distance. "I visited my father's hometown a few times as a child."

The quiet words made Alexander's chest tighten.

This time, when his fingers interlaced with hers, Evelyn didn't pull away.
###Chapter 681: The Goddess of Fertility

Alexander's gaze followed the little boy who effortlessly lifted Evelyn. His doubts instantly vanished. The children in this place must all possess extraordinary skills.

The procession suddenly paused its performance. Several children dressed as the Monkey King took the stage first, performing a series of backflips that drew cheers from the crowd. Next came an elderly man on stilts—each over a meter tall—yet he moved with surprising agility.

Alexander's pupils contracted slightly. This wasn’t just a folk parade; it was practically a professional acrobatic troupe.

Evelyn chuckled at his expression. "You've never been to a place like this before, have you?"

"Never," he admitted frankly. "When I did charity work before, it was mostly signing documents and taking photos. Field inspections were always delegated to subordinates."

It had never occurred to him that those simple lines on paper carried the hopes of so many lives.

Evelyn mused, "When we were married, we knew so little about each other's work. Now, at least, we can have a conversation about it."

Today, she wore simple dark blue jeans and a solid-colored hoodie, paired with canvas shoes similar to the ones she'd lost in the village. At a glance, their outfits almost looked like matching couple's wear.

Alexander secretly delighted in this and subtly moved closer, shielding her like any ordinary couple would.

The main attraction of the procession finally arrived—statues of various deities carried by the crowd.

Unfamiliar with local customs, Evelyn leaned toward an elderly man explaining the traditions to younger onlookers. Alexander immediately followed.

"This temple fair isn’t just for people to enjoy," the old man explained warmly. "It’s for the gods too. We invite them out to celebrate with us, offer prayers, and then send them back. In the old days, when we depended on the weather, these rituals were how we prayed for good harvests."

In the past, Alexander would have dismissed this as superstition. But after witnessing life here firsthand, his perspective had shifted.

People need something to believe in.

Evelyn studied the statues closely. "The craftsmanship is exquisite—so lifelike. Especially that one earlier. The painting made him look quite handsome."

Alexander immediately craned his neck to look, relaxing only after confirming the deity’s stern, majestic features. Good. No resemblance to Gregory whatsoever.

Hearing Evelyn’s comment, the old man turned with a chuckle. "Times change, and even the gods must keep up. If it weren’t for that tourist video last year, we wouldn’t have so many visitors now."

"Grandpa, what do these gods protect?" Evelyn asked humbly.

"That one? She’s the Goddess of Fertility. If you’re hoping for a child, praying to her is sure to bring blessings!"

The old man listed each deity with pride, encouraged by Evelyn’s attentiveness. Only after finishing did he notice Alexander standing beside her.

"Young man, you’re quite dashing. Any child of yours would surely be beautiful," the old man praised sincerely.

Alexander accepted the blessing without hesitation. Evelyn quickly changed the subject. "What about that one in the back?"

"That’s our local River God."

"A water deity?"

"In a way," the old man laughed. "In ancient times, young couples would scoop a bowl of water before marriage to seek his blessing."

Alexander grew intrigued. "How would they know if the River God approved?"

"By the water’s clarity. Clear water meant a happy marriage, while murky water foretold strife." The old man studied their closeness. "With a bond like yours, you’re sure to grow old together."

Evelyn thought of their failed first marriage and smiled without comment. But Alexander seemed contemplative. He asked about the river’s location, only to be disappointed upon learning it had long since dried up.

The temple fair lasted three days, with the first being the liveliest. The two followed the crowd to the temple—a modest two-courtyard compound bustling with worshippers.

Evelyn inhaled the scent of incense in the air. "With so many people competing to offer the first incense, how do the gods tell who’s who?"

Alexander murmured, "It’s less about competing and more about giving themselves reassurance. I used to think it was superstition, but now I see the value in it."

He would have liked to seek blessings too, but they’d come unprepared.

The courtyard was home to many stray cats, accustomed to visitors and utterly unafraid of people. A long-haired lion cat brushed against Evelyn’s leg, its fluffy tail winding around her ankle.
###Chapter 682: Seeking Love's Fortune

The lion cat rubbed against Evelyn's ankle, emitting soft mews. She crouched down, fingertips gently stroking its snow-white fur.

"They say pet owners attract animals easily. Seems true."

A sudden memory of her Ragdoll at home brought a pang of sorrow. When she'd adopted it, she never imagined so much would change.

"White Coat must be doing well with Dr. Wilson taking care of it." She paused. "That little kitten..."

Alexander immediately responded, "I brought it back from the pet shop. Mom's keeping it now. Aunt Margaret adores it—says it's like having a child around."

Evelyn exhaled in relief, fingers absently twirling the lion cat's tail.

"You never named it?" She arched a brow at Alexander.

He shrugged. "Waited for you. You have a talent for creative names."

The memory of "White Coat" made her chuckle. "Sure about that? What if I pick something like 'Rover'?"

"Your call." His gaze softened. "Not my name anyway."

The lion cat circled their feet before darting toward the fortune-telling area. They followed to the temple hall where an elderly man arranged bamboo sticks.

"Sincerity brings divine response." The elder offered the cylinder. "Focus on your wish, shake it, then match the stick to the verses on the wall."

Kneeling on the cushion, Evelyn closed her eyes. She prayed for her parents, for the child she'd never held. A soft clatter—the 87th stick fell.

"Supreme luck!" The elder unrolled the parchment. "A dragon gains water, blessings everlasting."

Alexander's lips curved as he watched her carefully fold the prophecy into her pocket. When his turn came, Evelyn filled his thoughts. The cylinder rattled—the 22nd stick dropped.

"Moderate fortune." The elder stroked his beard. "Rain after drought—success lies in effort."

"I sought love's fortune," Alexander stated plainly.

The elder's knowing glance flicked to Evelyn. "Modern times—men pursuing women is normal. This verse means seizing opportunities."

Evelyn pretended not to hear, petting the returned lion cat. Only outside did she speak: "You asked about love?"

"Yes." Alexander produced their wedding ring. "Though you've refused me countless times, I wanted the gods' opinion."

Sunset stretched their shadows long. The lion cat perched on stone steps, tilting its head at them.
###Chapter 683: Grace in Defeat

Evelyn Carter hesitated, words caught in her throat.

In the end, she remained silent.

They stepped over the temple threshold together, returning to the bustling streets.

The festival procession had dispersed, but crowds still thronged the lanes. Vendors occupied every inch of space, their cries weaving through the air. This year's tourist surge had overflowed even the designated market area.

Amidst this vibrant chaos, Evelyn's tension finally eased.

Alexander Hamilton had explored night markets in Hudson City, but never one so rustic. His gaze darted between stalls overflowing with wares. "If Lily's father set up shop here, his woven grass crafts would sell like hotcakes. Pity I bought his entire stock."

"That's not the real issue." Evelyn's voice darkened, recalling the village's plight. "Until Leonard Laurent faces justice, no one dares celebrate. Setting up stalls is the least of their worries."

Alexander stiffened.

The gulf between his world and theirs yawned wide before him.

Evelyn studied his profile.

The carefree lightness had vanished from his features, replaced by solemn contemplation.

A strange sense of déjà vu washed over her.

Once, she'd been the outsider navigating his gilded world. Now their roles reversed, and Alexander was tasting that same alienation.

"I didn't think you'd last three days," she murmured. "I concede."

"Then stop trying to banish me." His demand came with distracted charm as a candied hawthorn stall caught his eye. "Are these... sanitary?"

Her fastidiousness still occupied his thoughts.

Evelyn laughed. "Vivian and I lived on street food in college. Never had issues."

Those were simpler days.

Alexander's eyes shadowed briefly before he embarked on a buying spree. Candied fruits, lotus seed sweets, dried persimmons—each treat found its way into Evelyn's hands.

"Planning to feed an army?" She held up a sticky lotus sweet helplessly.

"Just one of each." His tone brooked no argument.

As Evelyn prepared to protest, movement at the periphery silenced her.

A hunched elderly woman crouched in the shadows. Before her sat a battered bamboo basket, its contents ignored. Clouded eyes held only bewilderment.

"Grandmother, how much for the duck eggs?" Evelyn knelt.

The woman responded slowly. "Home-pickled... one yuan each."

The price was shockingly low.

Understanding flashed between them. Alexander produced a hundred-yuan note. "We'll take everything—basket included."

"This is too much—" The old woman fumbled for change she clearly didn't possess.

Evelyn's gaze landed on wildflowers woven through the basket's rim. "These blossoms are lovely."

"Just mountain weeds. Worthless." Trembling fingers offered the stems. "Take them."

"Then we insist on paying properly." Her gentleness held steel.

Alexander's attention sharpened. "You came from the mountains?"

Three hours by car—an impossible journey on foot.

A sigh weighted with decades. "Waiting for my son to finish business before heading back."

Grief lived in the creases of her face.

"Does your son... treat you well?"

"Good sons, both." She shook her head. "But peasant lives are cheap... Fish stocks died. Debts remain. These old bones can only sell a few eggs..."

Their eyes met across the basket.

The unspoken name hung between them.
###Chapter 684: Ominous Premonition

"Why did the fish fry suddenly die?" Alexander Hamilton frowned deeply.

The elderly woman rubbed the edge of her basket with rough fingers. "The fry were healthy. It's our pond that's the problem. Most likely the water..."

Her clouded eyes held resignation. "This village is dying anyway. What does it matter?"

Evelyn Carter's chest tightened. These kind villagers had done nothing wrong, yet they bore the consequences. Meanwhile, those responsible were probably counting their bloodstained profits.

"You must take this." Alexander insisted, purchasing even the coarse cloth lining the basket.

The old woman trembled as she accepted the money, wrinkles creasing into a rare expression. "Thank you... bless you both..."

Evelyn discreetly pressed bus fare into her palm. "Take the coach home. Things will get better."

The woman nodded uncertainly before her hunched figure disappeared into the crowd.

"Trust me." Alexander clasped Evelyn's chilled hand. "We'll fix this."

A soft "Mm" was her reply.

"You actually believe me?" He seemed surprised.

"Our issues don't involve your character." Evelyn said calmly. "You're not a bad person at heart."

Alexander froze, then laughed bitterly. "Still so analytical."

Commotion erupted ahead. He glanced at her. "Shall we continue?"

"Let's see." Evelyn adjusted her coat. "Rare opportunity."

Alexander followed with their basket of trinkets. At the fair's center, a white goose strutted proudly amid scattered bamboo rings from failed toss games.

"Want to try?" He reached for his wallet.

Evelyn stopped him. "And if we win? Hotels don't allow geese."

Just then, a bizarrely dressed middle-aged man blocked their path. After staring intently at Evelyn, he suddenly performed finger calculations. "This lady bears virtuous features. Our fates intertwine."

"No fortunes." She turned to leave.

"Wait!" The man raised his voice. "Miss Carter faces mortal peril this year!"

Alexander's face darkened.

Evelyn smirked. "Then predict what I'll do next."

"Heaven's mysteries cannot—"

"Then don't waste our time." She tugged Alexander away.

"Hold on." He stood firm. "What do you mean by 'mortal peril'?"

The man's eyes gleamed. "Ah... this requires character analysis. But divine secrets demand..."

"Name your price." Alexander cut him off, pulling out his billfold.

Evelyn massaged her temples. Was his usual shrewdness just an act?

"Alexander." She hissed. "Police patrol ahead."

The fortune-teller paled but, seeing Alexander's determination, braved on. "Divinations shorten one's lifespan..."

"Your rate." Alexander flipped open his wallet.

Evelyn contemplated knocking sense into him. As she moved to intervene, Alexander stubbornly added, "Consider it local economic stimulus."

Turning to the charlatan, he demanded, "Explain this 'mortal peril' in detail."
###Chapter 685: Her World

The middle-aged man squinted with a smile and pulled out a ballpoint pen from his pocket. "Miss, just write any character that comes to mind. One stroke, no pauses."

Evelyn took the pen and swiftly wrote the character for "medicine" before handing it back. "Done."

"What would you like to ask about?"

"Career."

She didn’t believe a word of those ominous warnings about impending doom. Even if such disasters could be predicted, were they truly disasters if avoidable? Better to ask about something practical—career—where even a charlatan wouldn’t dare spin wild tales.

"‘Medicine’ is an excellent choice—a noble profession, saving lives, boundless virtue." The man studied the character with exaggerated seriousness. "But if we dissect it, the components hint at hidden weapons. Your strokes are particularly precise, suggesting you might be a target. And judging by your complexion, it seems you’ve already been affected."

This fraud was surprisingly eloquent, twisting everything back to his doom-and-gloom narrative.

Alexander’s frown deepened as he gripped Evelyn’s wrist. "Are you saying her misfortune is work-related?"

"Most likely."

"Is there a way to avert it?"

"Simple!" The man rummaged through his backpack and produced a string of red-corded pendants, each adorned with crude jade Buddhas and Guanyin figures. "These are blessed talismans, the most potent for safeguarding peace—"

The pendants looked blatantly plastic, lacking even the faintest luster of real jade.

Alexander stared at the shoddy trinkets, his lip twitching. As the heir to the Hamilton Group, he’d grown up surrounded by the finest jade—this was his first encounter with such blatant market-stall junk.

"Since fate brought us together, just a hundred each—"

"I’ll take them all."

Alexander cut him off mid-pitch, already reaching for his wallet.

"Wh—all of them?"

"How many do you have?"

"About twenty or so..."

"Every last one."

The man’s eyes lit up as he hastily shoved a Guanyin pendant into Alexander’s hand, snatched the cash, and bolted before the offer could be rescinded.

Watching the scammer flee, Alexander handed the pendant to Evelyn. "Wear it for fun."

She held it up to the sunlight—the plastic didn’t even let light through. "Realizing you’ve been scammed now?"

"I knew the moment he pulled those out." Alexander gave a wry smile. "A true fortune-teller wouldn’t peddle such things. But better safe than sorry. Consider it my peace of mind."

"I thought you’d have caught on when he asked for money." Evelyn massaged her temples. "If High Manager Dempsey knew you were this gullible, she’d regret not stocking up at the wholesale market and hiring a handwriting analyst as her shill."

Who’d have thought the CEO of Hamilton Group could be duped twice by the same street hustler?

Alexander’s gaze lingered on the pendant in her hand. "If you don’t want to wear it, hang it on your bag. Treat it as decoration."

She tucked the Guanyin pendant away with her wildflower bracelet, avoiding his intense stare. "We should grab lunch. We’ve got supplies to buy before heading back to the clinic tomorrow morning."

The old doctor had been holding the fort alone for two days—she couldn’t delay any longer.

"I heard there’s a decent lamb offal noodle place here." Alexander’s voice softened unexpectedly. "Want to try it?"

"Sure."

Remembering the last time he’d eaten at the village chief’s house, Evelyn warned, "Lamb offal has a strong flavor—nothing like the French cuisine you’re used to. Don’t force yourself if you can’t handle it."

That time, he’d vomited violently and spiked a fever.

"It’s fine," he said with misplaced confidence. "If the offal’s too much, I’ll just get the clear broth."

As it turned out, the young master’s imagination of street food was woefully inadequate.

The so-called noodle shop was a cramped storefront by the market, next to a butcher’s stall where freshly slaughtered lamb carcasses hung from bloody hooks. Diners sat on low plastic stools at the roadside, using taller stools as makeshift tables.

Alexander froze at the sight of the grimy seating.

"Offal or clear broth?" Evelyn asked smoothly.

The humble setup couldn’t mask the rich aroma of lamb broth simmering in a large pot.

Glancing at the crimson offal in nearby bowls, Alexander clenched his jaw. "Offal noodles."

If he’d survived the wild herb banquet, a bowl of noodles was nothing.

At such stalls, customers fetched their own orders. Alexander set down their bags and hurried to retrieve two bowls before Evelyn could. But when he tried to sit, a new problem arose—the stool was so low his long legs had nowhere to go.
###Chapter 686: Becoming Visible Again

The lunch was excruciatingly awkward.

Evelyn deftly placed a napkin under her bowl. "This way it won't burn your hands."

Alexander mimicked her gesture, finally sitting upright, though the flimsy plastic stool made him visibly uncomfortable. Thank heavens he'd worn casual clothes today—his tailored suits would've been ruined.

Noticing their struggle, the shop owner tossed another portion of rice noodles into the boiling pot and hauled over a folding table. "Tourists, huh? Could've asked for a proper table earlier."

They sighed in relief, replying in unison, "Thank you."

"Don't mention it." The man returned to his stove, stirring the noodles while making conversation. "Lots of visitors lately, but rarely see anyone as tall as you. Here to check out properties?"

Alexander seized the opening. "Heard about the villa development. Thought we'd take a look."

"Take my advice," the owner lowered his voice conspiratorially. "This place has bad energy. If you're buying a home for newlyweds, pick somewhere luckier."

Alexander shot a glance at Evelyn, relieved to find her expression unchanged. "We're not house-hunting for marriage."

"Honeymooning then?" The man eyed their matching sweatshirts. "Scenery here's perfect for couples."

"Not that either," Alexander cleared his throat. "We're not... together."

The owner chuckled. "Dressed like twins but not a couple?"

Only then did Evelyn notice their nearly identical outfits. Yesterday at the wholesale market, they'd only cared about comfort—never anticipating accidental coordination.

Yet Alexander kept chatting amiably. "You and your wife seem happy."

"Making do," the man said modestly, though crow's feet appeared at his eyes. "Plenty of prettier, gentler women out there, but she's the one for me."

"Is your wife not here today?"

"She woke at 2 AM to simmer lamb offal soup. Went home to nap at noon." His tone dripped with tenderness.

"Two o'clock?!" Alexander gaped.

"That's nothing," the owner shrugged. "The bun shop next door kneads dough at that hour daily. We've got it easy—usually start at four."

Alexander's worldview shattered again.

Dusk approached as they walked back to the hotel. Evelyn quickened her pace while Alexander followed silently, bags in hand.

After a long silence, he murmured, "How ordinary people suffer."

Remembering his former privileged life, he scoffed self-deprecatingly. "No wonder you despised who I was. Even I can't stand that version now."

Evelyn replied evenly, "Understanding common struggles already makes you superior to Leonard Laurent's ilk."

"Did you think of people as statistics?" She arched a brow. "That poverty stems from laziness?"

"Not exactly." He met her gaze frankly. "But I credited all success to myself. Only now do I see the truth—my greatest advantage was being born a Hamilton."

"How does it feel?" Evelyn asked suddenly. "Falling from the clouds. Do you miss it?"

Alexander tensed. "You promised not to send me away."

"Just curious." Her tone remained neutral.

That simple response warmed his chest. Once, he'd been invisible to her—like air.

Now, at last, she was seeing him again.
###Chapter 687 Undercurrents

Alexander's fingers tapped lightly on the steering wheel.

"I researched extensively before coming here, but the reality feels different," he said, watching the scenery flash by. "This place seems forgotten by time, yet stubbornly alive."

Evelyn glanced at him. "I didn't expect such reflections from the Hamilton Group CEO."

"People change." Alexander chuckled. "Just as I never imagined sitting with you on a rural backroad like this."

Dark clouds loomed in the distance, threatening rain.

Vendors at the temple fair scrambled to erect rain covers while visitors remained undeterred. A little girl dashed past their car clutching candied hawthorns, her laughter ringing clear.

"The people here have remarkable resilience," Evelyn observed. "Despite hardships, they always find joy."

Alexander studied her profile. "Is that why you chose to return to such a place?"

"Perhaps." She evaded the question. "It feels real here."

Lightning split the sky, followed by fat raindrops pelting the windshield.

"Should we find shelter?" Alexander slowed the car.

Evelyn pointed to a roadside teahouse. "Let's go there."

The proprietress welcomed them warmly with hot towels. Several rain-dodging patrons already occupied tables, the air fragrant with tea.

Alexander ordered Longjing tea, pouring Evelyn a steaming cup.

"Careful, it's hot." His fingers lingered on the rim.

Outside, a young couple shared an umbrella. The girl's laughter carried through the rain as her partner shielded her from the storm.

Alexander tracked their retreating figures. "Youth is wasted on the young."

"The mighty CEO envies that?" Evelyn sipped her tea.

"I was that age once." He rotated his cup. "Just didn't know its value then."

Evelyn remained silent as rain drummed the eaves rhythmically.

A delivery scooter sped past, splashing a pedestrian's trousers before vanishing into the downpour.

"My father was like that," Evelyn said suddenly. "Rain or shine, he'd go out to work."

Alexander listened quietly.

"One winter was particularly harsh. He came home covered in ice crystals." Her voice softened. "Mother and I spent hours thawing him with hot towels."

The rain eased, revealing a sliver of light on the horizon.

"Let's head back," Alexander said abruptly.

Evelyn looked up. "Your ankle—"

"Much better." He stood. "The village needs you more."

They took turns driving home. Alexander insisted Evelyn rest, covering most of the distance himself.

When they reached the village entrance, night had fallen completely.

"Strange." Evelyn rolled down her window. "Why so quiet?"

The usually bustling lanes stood empty, only faint yellow light seeping through windows. Even the dogs were silent.

Alexander killed the engine, scanning their surroundings warily. "We're expected."

Shadows shifted between swaying trees, dark figures flickering at the periphery.

Evelyn's grip tightened on the door handle. "Are they here for us?"

"No." Alexander's voice turned glacial. "They're here for me."

From the darkness came the metallic clink of steel meeting steel.
###Chapter 688: Targeting Me

Alexander Hamilton's gaze locked onto the haphazardly parked vehicles blocking the village road.

The only flat main thoroughfare was completely obstructed. Last time he visited, he'd deliberately parked at the village entrance to avoid inconvenience. But these drivers clearly lacked basic courtesy.

Evelyn Carter surveyed the chaotic parking and pulled over further. "This is the best we can do. Otherwise, the villagers won't be able to pass."

"Move closer to the edge." Alexander narrowed his eyes, his voice dropping low. "One of these cars belongs to someone who's here for me."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Leonard Laurent? He got here this fast?"

The police hadn't provided updates yet, but the body in the pond was undoubtedly connected to the Laurent family. Leonard's sudden appearance meant he'd learned about his men's encounter with Alexander.

A realization struck Evelyn. "That night—"

She confessed everything about calling Lydia Laurent.

"You did that... to save me?" Alexander stared at her intensely, his scorching gaze nearly burning through her.

"What else?" Evelyn turned away. "It was an emergency. Lydia was the only connection I could think of. Was I supposed to watch you die?"

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted almost imperceptibly, an indescribable emotion swelling in his chest. "I see."

He'd never imagined Evelyn would panic for his sake.

"But the call didn't seem to work." Evelyn frowned. "They still tried to kill you."

"Oh, it worked perfectly." Alexander glanced at the vehicles, lowering his voice. "Since they came to us... I have a plan..."

At the rural clinic, Alexander leaned "weakly" against Evelyn's shoulder, each step appearing agonizing.

Nurses immediately surrounded them. "Mr. Hamilton, has your leg injury worsened?"

Evelyn accepted the offered chair while noting the ignored Laurent father-daughter pair. Leonard's face darkened with rage while Lydia blinked her innocent doe eyes.

"Is the village elder alright?" Evelyn whispered.

A young nurse leaned in. "Furious. The senior doctor calmed him down. These people barged in demanding to see you—"

"You should all return to the dormitory." Evelyn patted her shoulder. "We'll handle this."

"But there are so many of them..."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Don't worry. They wouldn't dare harm medical volunteers."

Once the nurses left, Alexander's gaze turned razor-sharp, piercing Leonard.

Lydia maintained her guileless facade, but Evelyn wasn't fooled again.

Beads of sweat formed on Leonard's forehead as he berated his subordinates. "Useless idiots! Can't even handle simple tasks!"
###Chapter 689: Calculated Move

His words ostensibly berated his subordinates, but every syllable was aimed at Alexander Hamilton.

The attendants stood frozen in fear, heads bowed in silence. Not one dared approach Alexander. Leonard Laurent's face darkened with rage as he spat, "Useless fools."

Seeing his men fail him, he stepped forward himself. "Mr. Hamilton, what a coincidence running into you here."

Alexander didn’t so much as blink. "Mr. Laurent, you know perfectly well whether this was coincidence or design."

It wasn’t a question—it was a statement.

The air turned to ice.

Leonard knew the truth but would never admit it. Clenching his fists, he forced an obsequious smile. "Mr. Hamilton, this is all a terrible misunderstanding."

Alexander finally lifted his gaze, eyes sharp as blades. "Misunderstanding? Then enlighten me—what kind of misunderstanding leads to attempted murder in a village? If I couldn’t swim, that pond would’ve claimed another body."

Beneath the water, tangled lotus roots and thick mud made perfect hiding places for the dead. The last corpse wasn’t discovered until only bones remained.

Leonard rubbed his hands together, playing dumb. "Murder? I’d never dare! I’m just an honest businessman. Illegal activities are beneath me."

Lydia Laurent peeked out from behind her father, her voice trembling. "Alexander, Evelyn, Dad truly didn’t know. He only came after the police notified him and even gave a statement."

Evelyn Carter met her gaze. "Miss Laurent, remember our phone call that night? We talked quite a bit."

"Phone call?" Lydia feigned thought before suddenly "remembering." "Oh, it was so late. I was half-asleep and only recall you mentioning Alexander. I drifted off after that. When I woke up, I tried calling back, but you didn’t answer."

Confident Evelyn hadn’t recorded the call, she spun her lies effortlessly, innocence plastered across her face.

Evelyn smiled.

Lydia was far cleverer than Annabelle.

"Why are you smiling, Evelyn?" Lydia’s eyes narrowed, her mind already racing to counter any move.

Evelyn’s lips curved, but her eyes remained glacial. "Nothing. Just thinking you’re wasted as a socialite. You’d excel in more... consequential pursuits. Might even make something of yourself."

The words were casual, almost conversational, yet Lydia paled. If not for Alexander’s presence, her carefully crafted mask would’ve shattered.

"I really didn’t hear clearly that night..." Lydia twisted her fingers, voice barely audible. "But now that I think about it, I think you said Alexander was in danger. Yet you didn’t tell me where. How could I have helped...?"

Every word was a meticulously crafted distortion of the truth.

Alexander suddenly chuckled. "That’s good to know."

Evelyn’s understated retelling had left him struggling to picture her worried for him. Now Lydia had unwittingly painted the scene for him.

Leonard was baffled but seized the slight softening in Alexander’s expression. "Exactly, Mr. Hamilton! Lydia has always cared deeply for you. Why would we ever harm you?"

He smiled ingratiatingly while mentally cursing his incompetent men.

Lydia had alerted him immediately that night. Those worthless fools couldn’t even handle a simple silencing!

When he learned they’d encountered Alexander, Leonard panicked, ready to call it off—until Lydia stopped him.

"Dad, it’s too late. If Evelyn called me, they’re already exposed."

"Then what? The engagement’s off—my pride means nothing now. Should we... beg the Hamiltons for mercy?" Leonard grasped at straws.

"No." Lydia’s voice was steel. "This is our chance. Who’s left at Hamilton Group without Alexander? If he were gone, you wouldn’t need to borrow their name for your projects..."

The realization struck Leonard like lightning. He set down his phone and let events unfold—only to learn at dawn that Alexander had merely disappeared.

A golden opportunity, slipped away.

Seething internally, Leonard maintained his facade, desperate to distance himself. "Since the broken engagement, I’ve had no idea of your whereabouts. How would I know you’d be in this backwater? Those men acted alone—Laurent Group had nothing to do with them! I don’t even know them!"

He wasn’t afraid of Alexander investigating. The thugs were in police custody, and breaking them would take time. Besides, he’d always used intermediaries to handle payments.

Evelyn thought of the murdered college student Lotus Waters had mentioned, the body rotting in the pond for months, and fury ignited. "Of course you don’t know them. Money moves mountains—no need to dirty your hands. These two days’ absence? You were busy covering tracks."

Leonard cried injustice. "Evelyn, you make it sound simple. I came as soon as I heard, but this place is unfamiliar. And Lydia insisted on tagging along—dragging a young girl slows everything down. If you think we were too slow, well, I can’t help that."
###Chapter 690: A Hundred Days to Heal

Alexander Hamilton immediately shifted the blame onto Evelyn Carter, making her seem like the unreasonable one.

His brows furrowed, his gaze turning icy in an instant.

Lydia Laurent softened her voice. "Alexander, Dad and I really didn’t mean to be late. I’m just not used to the countryside, so Dad brought extra help to take care of me. That’s why we got delayed."

Their entourage quickly caught on, chiming in with agreement.

"Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Laurent and Miss Lydia had quite the journey."

"This place was so hard to find..."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "You actually asked for directions the whole way?"

The corner of Alexander’s lips curled slightly, a hint of mockery flashing in his eyes.

Lydia was about to play dumb and brush it off, but Leonard Laurent was eager to prove his loyalty. "Of course! If we knew the way, why would we go through all this trouble?"

He was certain no one would dare contradict him. As for their departure time, he had indeed left Hudson City immediately—just with a small detour to handle some "minor issues."

That college student who’d been scared out of his mind was probably counting his compensation in a psychiatric facility right now.

"Do you know how long it takes for one person to find this place?" Alexander sneered. "I drove for three days and nights."

Leonard froze.

He hadn’t expected Alexander to go to such lengths for a woman. He’d never been this devoted to Annabelle Taylor back then.

"Would you like to try it yourself, Mr. Laurent?" Alexander’s gaze sharpened. "No need to go back to Hudson City—just to the nearest town."

Leonard immediately shut his mouth.

The others fell silent too. Who would’ve thought the CEO would personally drive for three days straight?

The atmosphere in the courtyard turned frigid.

Seeing the situation deteriorate, Lydia quickly tried to smooth things over. "Alexander, we were definitely in the wrong this time. Dad didn’t manage his people well, so I’ll apologize on his behalf."

She bowed deeply, attempting to claim the moral high ground.

But the expected polite response never came.

Both Evelyn and Alexander watched coldly. Childhood friendship? That had evaporated the moment the truth came to light.

Lydia dug her nails into her palms.

If it weren’t for Evelyn meddling, everything in the Hamilton family should’ve been hers after that idiot Annabelle was out of the picture!

When she looked up again, her eyes were brimming with tears. "I really don’t know how to explain this..."

Alexander remained unmoved. "Let him speak for himself. I trust evidence more than excuses."

Lydia was instantly at a loss for words.

Evelyn listened quietly, her heart a whirlwind of emotions.

He’d finally learned to trust her.

Too bad it was too late.

"Don’t let the door hit you on the way out," Alexander said flatly, issuing the dismissal outright.

Lydia panicked. They’d only come to clear their names, never expecting to be humiliated on the spot.

"Alexander, come with us," she urged, glancing around the shabby clinic. "There’s a hotel in the next town..."

If she could just separate them, things would be much easier.

"No need," Alexander refused bluntly. "I’m injured and need rest."

Leonard immediately tried to ingratiate himself. "Mr. Hamilton, the conditions here are terrible. You should go to a hospital—"

Evelyn watched the father-daughter act with cold amusement.

Lydia covered her nose in disgust, as if the air smelled foul.

Alexander’s gaze turned even colder. "If you can’t stand it, then leave. I think this place is just fine."

Everyone was stunned.
###Chapter 691: No Favors Owed

Lydia Laurent's smile faltered as Alexander Hamilton repeatedly ignored her. She forced a weak grin. "Alexander, we'll take our leave now. We'll visit again tomorrow."

A flicker of irritation crossed Alexander's eyes. He'd prefer never seeing these people again, but remembering tomorrow's plans, he gave a curt nod. "Hmm."

The crowd finally dispersed, restoring peace to the rural clinic.

The post-rain night sky sparkled with clarity, moonlight painting silver patterns across the ground. Evelyn Carter gazed at the waxing moon. "A month already," she murmured.

The moon had looked identical when she first arrived—alone. Now Alexander stood beside her, an unexpected companion.

He read her thoughts. "If I'm bothering you, I can move to the examination room. But Dr. Carter, at least assign me a proper bed?" He emphasized "Dr. Carter" deliberately.

Evelyn averted her eyes. "Only one bed's available—the postpartum patient just discharged. If you don't mind—"

"I mind." Alexander cut in sharply. "Save it for someone who needs it more."

She sighed. "Just teasing. There's a foldable cot in the on-call room. It'll do for a few days."

Relieved, Alexander stood. "I'll fetch my things from the car."

"I'm coming too." Evelyn followed. "Some are mine." Her pointed tone declared she wanted no favors.

Alexander paused mid-step. "That determined to draw lines between us?"

"Not lines—boundaries." Her voice remained steady. "Habits are dangerous things."

She knew their power too well. Had she not grown accustomed to her marriage, the divorce wouldn't have shattered her so completely.

Alexander's gaze darkened. "I promised your father I'd look after you both. This is a vow, not charity."

His eyes held cautious hope as they searched hers.

Evelyn looked away. "After how you treated the Laurents today... What about Margaret—"

"Mother never approved of that match." His tone lightened. "Her instincts are impeccable."

"She noticed Lydia's flaws?"

"No." His intense stare burned through her. "She prefers you."

Moonlight amplified the heat in his eyes until it became unbearable.

Evelyn turned toward the door. "I'm checking on Elder Thompson."

"Together." Alexander matched her stride. "We can deliver some duck eggs."

At the Thompson residence, the courtyard gate was shut. Alexander peered over. "Lights are on."

His knock elicited a wary "Who's there?"

"Alexander Hamilton. With Dr. Carter."

The door creaked open, revealing Mrs. Thompson's delighted face. "Dr. Carter! Weren't you in town today?"
###Chapter 692: Insatiable Greed

"I was concerned about the villagers." Evelyn Carter noticed the lingering worry in Elder Thompson's wife's expression as she stepped inside, her voice gentle.

"How is Elder Thompson feeling? We heard what happened this afternoon. Those people have left and won't bother you tonight. As for the pond and land issues, there will be a resolution soon. No one needs to live in fear anymore."

Before she could finish, Elder Thompson emerged from the inner room, coughing as he draped a coat over his shoulders. "Thank goodness it's you. When I heard the commotion, I thought those heartless bastards had returned."

The elder sighed when speaking of the businessmen who looked down on the village. But when it came to Leonard Laurent and his men, his voice dripped with venom.

Alexander Hamilton's expression darkened. "I'd like to understand what's been happening here recently. Would you mind sharing?"

Elder Thompson only knew Alexander as a generous city businessman, unaware of his true identity. Grateful yet hesitant, he replied, "Mr. Hamilton, I know you mean well. But these men have powerful connections. It's better if you stay out of this. An old man like me has nothing to lose, but you—"

Evelyn felt warmth in her chest. "Don't worry, Elder. He—"

Exchanging a glance with Alexander, she continued seamlessly, "—isn't someone to be trifled with either. We can't explain everything now, but once this is resolved, we'll give you a full account."

The elderly couple exchanged looks and sighed deeply.

"Sit down. This is a long story."

They settled at the square table as steaming tea was placed before them.

"...I didn't mean to hide things from you. Those men had been quiet for a while—I thought they'd given up. But they came back worse than ever, nearly harming you all. Thank heavens you were alert and brought help."

Elder Thompson bowed his head in shame. "I was selfish, afraid you'd leave if you knew the truth. Fewer people are willing to help our village these days. If you'd gone too..."

The man who'd served as village elder for decades suddenly looked ancient under the dim lamplight.

Evelyn reassured him softly, "We understand your predicament. We're not here tonight to assign blame—just to learn the full situation."

In the flickering light, Elder Thompson began his account. The story of the college student and Leonard Laurent's identity matched what Lotus Waters had shared. But there were details the child couldn't have known.

"...Our village survives because of that pond. But since last month, all the fish have died. It's not just us—every fish farmer nearby has suffered."

Alexander and Evelyn immediately recalled the old woman selling duck eggs in town. To Leonard Laurent, these innocent villagers were mere obstacles.

The old Alexander might have remained indifferent. But now, he felt genuine disgust for such arrogance.

"Elder, when did you realize the water was contaminated?"

"At first, we didn't suspect the water. The lotus roots and flowers seemed fine. But fish fry kept dying after we restocked. That's when people knew something was wrong. Our college student took water samples to a lawyer, and then..."

The elder's voice broke as he wiped his face roughly.

"I watched that boy grow up—bright and kind-hearted. If I weren't so useless, I should've gone with him. When his family moved away after what happened to him, I couldn't even face them to say goodbye..."

Alexander waited for him to compose himself before asking, "Do you know where they relocated? We might need his testimony in court."

The elder's head snapped up. "Court? Suing those people? Won't they retaliate again...?"

Fear filled the eyes of a man accustomed to swallowing his grievances.

Alexander didn't make the decision for him, simply stating calmly, "Without legal action, you'll keep compromising. You might even lose land your ancestors lived on for generations. And those men—their greed will only grow."

The room fell into prolonged silence. Only when Evelyn's tea turned cold did Elder Thompson finally grit his teeth.

"Fine! To court it is! This old man will risk everything to secure a future for our children!"

His wife slammed the table excitedly. "About time! Our families have lived here for generations—why should we hand it over? They keep babbling about building hotels. They'll probably fill in the pond!"

Evelyn's heart clenched. "They'd fill the pond? This area already struggles with water scarcity. Without it, how would nearby villages survive?"

Alexander's face darkened instantly. "Fill the pond?!"
###Chapter 693: Silent Achiever

The village situation proved more challenging than anticipated.

Alexander Hamilton emerged from the elder's house with a furrowed brow, his gaze heavy as it lingered on the distant horizon. Evelyn Carter recognized the weight on his mind and respected his silence, walking quietly beside him.

Her phone buzzed abruptly.

The name "Bianca Langley" on the screen made her fingers hesitate.

"Who is it?" Alexander's sharp intuition caught her pause.

"Miss Langley." Evelyn exhaled softly. "We haven't spoken in a while."

A call at this moment rarely brought good news.

The connection clicked, and Bianca's exhausted voice filtered through. "Dr. Carter, could you look after my child for a while?"

Evelyn instinctively glanced at Alexander. "I'm not in Hudson City right now—"

"Is Mr. Hamilton also away?" Bianca seized the implication. "You're together?"

"Yes."

"Vacation?"

"Medical aid mission." Evelyn paused. "Miss Langley, are you in trouble?"

Silence stretched for seconds.

"I need to handle something." Bianca's tone turned resolute. "My child means everything. I can't let her get involved."

Evelyn heard the finality in her words. "Alright, I'll help."

Hanging up, Evelyn's frown deepened unconsciously.

Alexander had already pieced it together. "The Langley family matter?"

"She didn't specify." Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone. "But it sounds serious."

After a contemplative beat, Alexander stated, "We should return immediately."

"But the village—"

"Emily Zade arrives tomorrow." His gaze was unwavering. "Medical teams, volunteer teachers, and supplies will all be here. As for the villagers' requests, resolving them requires corporate resources."

Evelyn stared at the dilapidated clinic in the distance, torn.

At dawn the next day, commotion outside startled her awake.

Pushing open the window, she froze.

A fleet of trucks lined the village entrance, medical equipment, medicines, and textbooks stacked into small mountains. Emily directed workers unloading the cargo.

"Madam." Emily approached briskly. "The construction crew arrives this afternoon. Anything else to add?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It's thoroughly arranged. Where's Alexander?"

"Finalizing paperwork." Emily smiled. "You can bid farewell to the villagers first."

The clinic nurses, eyes glistening, packed Evelyn's toiletries into her bag.

"Dr. Carter, take these."

"You can't find herbs this good in the city."

Evelyn hugged them, turning to see Alexander standing in sunlight, flanked by Lily and Lotus Waters.

The children carried bulging bundles, eyes sparkling.

"Dr. Carter!" Lily bounded over. "Mom and Dad said we can go to the city!"

Lotus lifted a woven grass rabbit. "Dad made this last night. For you."

Elder Thompson stood nearby, eyes moist. "We entrust them to you."

Evelyn looked at Alexander in surprise.

"Education can't wait." He took the children's luggage. "Their talents deserve proper nurturing."

Warmth bloomed in Evelyn's chest as she promised the elder solemnly, "I'll update you regularly on their progress."

Elder Thompson waved dismissively. "After all you've done for us, gratitude is the least we owe."

During farewells, Lily suddenly threw herself into Evelyn's arms.

"Dr. Carter, I'll become a doctor like you someday!"

Evelyn stroked her back. "I'll be waiting."

Noticing someone missing while boarding, Evelyn asked, "Isn't Emily coming?"

"She's overseeing construction and water testing." Alexander started the engine. "She'll return to headquarters after completion."

In the rearview mirror, the village silhouette gradually blurred.

Watching the excited children beside her, Evelyn murmured, "When did you arrange all this?"

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "While you were asleep."
###Chapter 694: Love, Pain, Regret, and Hatred

Lily and Lotus sat in the car, no longer as timid as when they first met. The siblings watched Alexander maneuver the steering wheel with admiration shining in their eyes.

"Brother," Lily chirped, "the villagers say you're a big boss in the city, but you're different from those other bosses."

She recalled Leonard's menacing subordinates and instinctively scooted closer to her brother.

Alexander glanced at them through the rearview mirror. "Actually, I'm the CEO of Hamilton Group."

The air in the car froze instantly.

Evelyn anxiously observed the children's reactions. Lily blinked her large eyes, then suddenly beamed. "I believe you! You and Dr. Carter are good people!"

Lotus nodded vigorously, his small hand clutching his sister's sleeve.

Only then did Evelyn's tension ease. Throughout the drive, she patiently described their future school life until the car stopped in front of Hamilton Tower.

"Miss Langley is already waiting," Evelyn said. "What about Lily and Lotus?"

Alexander pondered briefly. "Let them come up with us."

Lily pressed her face against the window, staring at the towering glass skyscraper. "Brother... can we really go in?"

Alexander ruffled Lotus's hair. "Of course."

Bianca stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, cradling her baby. When she saw them enter with two children, she nearly dropped her coffee cup. "What's this...?"

"My children," Alexander stated without batting an eye.

"What?!" Bianca's face paled. "You have illegitimate children? And they're this old?"

Alexander chuckled. "Just kidding."

Bianca exhaled sharply. "You scared me. But men are unpredictable—who knows when a secret child might pop up."

"Did that woman Vincent was seeing get pregnant?"

Bianca's fingers tightened until her knuckles turned white. "...She's dead."

The air grew heavy.

"Suicide," Bianca whispered, her voice feather-light.

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged glances.

"The police suspected me first." Bianca gave a bitter smile. "But if I wanted to act, I would've done it long ago. Why wait till now?"

"What really happened?"

"I don't know." Bianca hugged her child tighter. "But Vincent has gone mad—he even dares to defy my parents now. Leaving the baby with you is safest."

Evelyn sensed danger. "What is he planning to do to you?"

"Don't worry." Bianca smirked coldly. "He's not insane enough to kill me. I just want to take my parents abroad for safety. They've always treated Vincent like their own son..."

Evelyn understood. As children, their greatest fear was burdening their parents.

Alexander looked at Evelyn and said firmly, "Leave the baby with me. Vincent will come to his senses when he calms down."

"Right, he's always been so clever." Bianca's eyes were hollow. "Married me for his career back then, and now that he's successful, he wants to make it up to her. Truly... brilliant."

Evelyn gently grasped her hand. "When this storm passes, focus on raising your child well."

At the mention of her daughter, a flicker of warmth returned to Bianca's gaze. "I don't want anything else. He can have the company, the reputation... I offered divorce long ago, but that foolish girl..."

"What did the police say?"

"Pesticide poisoning. Confirmed suicide." Bianca laughed bitterly. "She left a note. Said divorce would ruin Vincent's standing at the company and cost him his daughter..."

Alexander sighed. "She loved him deeply."

"I met her," Bianca murmured. "A sweet, kind-hearted girl. Now she'll live forever in Vincent's heart."

Yes.

A pure, untainted Unattainable Love who willingly died for love.

Vincent's heart was filled with love, pain, guilt—and above all, hatred.

Hatred for himself. And even greater hatred for Bianca and their daughter.
###Chapter 695 The Final Straw

"The children are here, let's not discuss this now." Bianca Langley forced a smile, her gaze resting on the two little ones. "Such adorable kids. You didn't... kidnap them, did you?"

Alexander Hamilton explained, "We've already spoken with their parents. This is Lily and Lotus, siblings."

Evelyn Carter introduced softly, "This is Auntie Bianca and her baby."

"Hello, Auntie Bianca," the children chorused.

Bianca looked at the well-behaved siblings and couldn't resist ruffling Lily's hair. She smiled at Lotus. "So young, yet already helping carry your sister's bag. What a thoughtful boy."

Lotus shyly lowered his head.

Lily noticed the sleeping infant in the stroller and pulled a woven grass butterfly from her pocket. "Auntie Bianca, this is for the baby."

"Thank you." Bianca accepted the gift, a shadow flickering in her eyes.

Evelyn immediately sensed her distress. Her eyes swept over the mountain of luggage by the stroller. "With this much packed... are you planning for the baby to stay with us long?"

Alexander also realized something was wrong. He signaled a staff member. "Why don't you two play here for now? Ask this nice lady if you need anything."

Once the children were led away, the three adults entered the adjacent lounge.

The moment the door closed, Bianca's fragile composure shattered. She collapsed onto the sofa, her disheveled hair failing to conceal the dark circles beneath her eyes.

Evelyn's heart clenched at the sight, remembering the radiant woman she'd first met.

"Your parents are really going abroad?" Alexander cut straight to the point.

Bianca gave a bitter laugh. "I should've known I couldn't fool you."

"What happened?"

"Vincent..." Her voice trembled. "His first love died. Now he's blaming me and the baby."

Evelyn gasped. "But he's the one who broke his promise! How is this your fault?"

"Because he regretted it." Bianca's nails dug into her palms. "He was ready to abandon everything to return to her... then I discovered I was pregnant..."

Evelyn inhaled sharply.

"The baby changed everything." Bianca's voice cracked. "That girl was traditional—she believed in not breaking up families..."

"So he resents the child?"

Bianca closed her eyes. "Her death was the final straw. Now he's... completely unhinged."

Evelyn's pulse raced. "What will you—"

"I must protect my parents and my child." Bianca lifted her head, determination flashing in her eyes. "As for Vincent... his rage needs an outlet."

Alexander's voice turned grave. "Divorce then. Give him the company. Sever all ties."

"Useless." Bianca shook her head. "He doesn't want money now. He wants vengeance."

Silence filled the room.

Bianca stood and bowed deeply. "I'm entrusting my baby to you. I can't manage alone..."

Evelyn and Alexander nodded simultaneously.

"Thank you." Bianca exhaled in relief and turned to the stroller. She leaned over her sleeping daughter, fingers hovering—but didn't dare touch.

Evelyn stood by the stroller, her heart breaking for the infant about to lose her family.

As Bianca's car pulled away, the baby stirred awake. Finding her mother gone, her lips parted in a wail.

Alexander swiftly scooped her up. "Remember Uncle and Auntie?"

Miraculously, the crying stopped. The baby blinked up at him with teary eyes.

"Don't be afraid." Alexander gently patted her back. "We're here."
###Chapter 696: The Anonymous Letter

Colorful snack wrappers littered the desk.

Lily and Lotus stood stiffly nearby, nervously twisting the hems of their shirts.

"Mr. Hamilton, Dr. Carter... is this your baby?" Lily asked timidly.

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "Yes."

"You already have a child?" Lotus's eyes widened. "Dr. Carter never mentioned it."

Lily leaned over the stroller, her eyes sparkling. "She's so beautiful. Much fairer than my brother was as a baby."

"Hey, was I really that dark?" Lotus scratched his head.

"Idiot, you wouldn't remember nursing," Lily retorted, making everyone chuckle.

Evelyn returned with a warmed bottle, joining Alexander in soothing the fussy infant.

The moment the baby caught their familiar scent, her cries ceased. Tiny lips began eagerly suckling.

Alexander attempted to sit, but the baby's face scrunched up the second his weight touched the couch.

He sprang back up instantly, expertly cradling the bottle while pacing the lounge.

"Let me take over." Evelyn noticed the dark circles under his eyes. "You haven't slept properly in days."

"No need." His voice softened. "You'll face greater challenges soon. Rest while you can."

Just then, Emily's video call came through.

"Mr. Hamilton, the water samples were split for dual testing. I kept backups."

"Excellent work." Alexander stepped away to avoid disturbing the baby.

Evelyn intuitively activated the stroller's musical mobile.

Emily lowered her voice. "There's something else. Someone left an item in the car."

Lily immediately tugged her brother up. "We'll wait outside—"

"Stay." Alexander stopped them. "This concerns your village."

Evelyn drew both children close as the four focused on the screen.

"It's an envelope." Emily held up a kraft paper packet. "I didn't open it."

Alexander narrowed his eyes.

"That's exam paper from the village school," Evelyn recognized. "I've seen it at the clinic."

"Open it," Alexander commanded.

Emily unsealed the envelope, extracting two handwritten pages in neat, anonymous script.

Evelyn scanned them rapidly. "It's about the pond case."

"The writer was cautious," Emily analyzed. "The details align with the elder's account but include new specifics."

Alexander pondered. "Leonard never acts directly. He pays others to take the fall."

"Should we identify the sender?"

"Don't alert them." Alexander shook his head. "I suspect it's that volunteer teacher."

Evelyn reread the letter as the pages rustled in the breeze.

"Is this about the disabled college student?" Lily suddenly asked.

Lotus looked bewildered at his sister.

"The adults said he went mad after a car accident..." Lily's voice trailed off.

"That was no accident," Alexander stated grimly. "The letter says he'd hired a lawyer to return when he rescued a harassed girl."

"She begged him to escort her home, but thugs ambushed them on the road."

"They beat him half-dead and shoved him under a truck. Before losing consciousness, he heard someone call her—Miss Laurent."

The air turned leaden.

That so-called "Miss Laurent" could only be Lydia.
###Chapter 697: Just Keep Me Company

Evelyn's fingertips turned ice-cold as a chill shot up her spine. She suddenly remembered the meaningful look Lydia had given her before leaving.

The letter's account abruptly ended at the university student's assault. The messenger claimed it was the victim's final cry for help before losing consciousness, with the phone destroyed in the car accident. Though lacking physical evidence, he staked his life on its authenticity.

Emily had already launched an investigation per Alexander's orders. "Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton," she reported, "the victim was found in time, and the attackers confessed. They claimed it was retaliation for interfering with their harassment of a girl. The police protected her identity."

"The case will proceed normally, but those thugs are penniless—prison is their only punishment. As for that student..." Emily's voice darkened. "His entire life, his family... ruined."

Dead silence filled the room.

Alexander broke it first. "Contact the best hospital. All treatment costs come from my personal account." He always kept business and personal expenses separate, funding pre-project expenditures privately.

The old Alexander treated all lives with equal indifference. But after weeks in the village, he'd finally understood the struggles of ordinary people.

Wind chimes tinkled as Baby Chloe played happily in her stroller. Suddenly, chaotic footsteps sent her wailing in fright.

Alexander scooped up his daughter one-handed while still reviewing documents. A knock interrupted him.

"Enter."

His secretary sounded uneasy. "Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Laurent and Ms. Lydia barged in. Reception couldn't stop them..."

As Alexander's former fiancée and daughter of Banyan Group's CEO, no employee would dare physically restrain Lydia.

"Prepare the conference room." Alexander didn't blame the staff. Once the door closed, his eyes turned glacial. "They're faster than I expected. I underestimated Leonard."

Evelyn's pulse jumped. She'd thought Lydia was merely obsessed with Alexander—not involved in Leonard's schemes. Just how deep did her complicity run?

Alexander stood with the baby. "Time to face them. Coming?"

Lily clenched her brother's hand, jaw set. "I'm going! If they lie, I'll expose them!"

"Remember—no direct confrontations." Alexander ruffled her hair before turning to Evelyn. "You?"

She pressed her lips. "In what capacity?"

This was Hamilton Group versus Banyan Group—Alexander versus Lydia. As his ex-wife, her presence was awkward.

"Just keep me company." He jiggled the baby. "You stayed with me last night. Today we've got two... no, three kids. More fun."

Emily discreetly excused herself. In the conference room, Leonard criticized the tea-serving secretary: "This is how Hamilton Group receives us now?"

The secretary smiled wordlessly and left.

"Father!" Lydia hissed. "Don't you see? Before, you'd be in the VIP lounge. Now they've dumped us in this generic room. Alexander suspects something. Your arrogance only makes it worse."

Leonard paled. "Then what?"

"Play pitiful." Lydia's eyes gleamed. "Without evidence..."

The door swung open before she finished. Alexander entered carrying an infant, trailed by two preteens like a kindergarten field trip. Evelyn followed last, seeming like a misplaced spectator.

Lily and her brother commandeered armchairs, glaring at their enemies. Before Leonard could adjust his expression, Alexander's icy voice cut through:

"Have you investigated, Mr. Laurent?"

Leonard forced a smile. "My oversight in discipline—I was too focused on advancing the project..."
###Chapter 698: Unraveling the Truth

He deliberately avoided the crucial issues, refusing to acknowledge the poisoning crime. The unidentified corpse was dismissed with a casual remark.

Lydia Laurent's tears welled up instantly, her eyes reddening. She stood on trembling legs, her frail frame looking as if it might dissolve in the wind. "Alexander, my father made a terrible mistake this time..."

Alexander Hamilton didn’t even glance up, focused entirely on the baby in his arms. The little one giggled, playing with his shirt buttons.

"So your idea of a prime location is someone else’s home?" His voice was eerily calm. "The water test results will be out soon. Mr. Laurent knows the consequences of poisoning."

Leonard Laurent’s forehead glistened with sweat. Lydia subtly tugged at his sleeve.

This seemingly fragile daughter was the true mastermind behind the Laurent family.

"Mr. Hamilton, I accept the penalty." Leonard suddenly pulled out his phone and dialed a number in front of everyone. After a brief conversation, he uttered a familiar name.

Alexander watched the performance coldly.

"I’ve reported the project manager to the police," Leonard declared righteously. "Such endangerment of public safety must be punished severely."

The scapegoat he offered was a loyal subordinate who had served him for over a decade.

Alexander finally looked at him. "Mr. Laurent, sacrificing pawns to save the king—you’re quite skilled at that."

Lydia quickly interjected, "Alexander, Father had no choice. If that uncle really allowed the poisoning, he deserves legal consequences."

With a few words, the mastermind became an accomplice, and the true criminal was painted as the righteous one.

Evelyn Carter had intended to stay out of it, but now she spoke up. "Miss Laurent seems very informed about the case?"

Lydia blinked her innocent eyes. "Evelyn, I know nothing about managing a company. I heard you once took over the Anderson Group. Could you teach me?"

"You could ask Mr. Laurent directly."

That was exactly what Lydia wanted. She feigned naivety. "Father tried to teach me, but I’m too slow. Not like you, with Alexander guiding you every step. By the way, did your father return to the company because you went to the countryside?"

The abrupt shift was clumsy but effective.

Evelyn cut straight to the point. "What are you implying?"

"I’m just worried about you," Lydia said timidly. "Everyone in our circle is saying the Anderson heiress lacks manners, doesn’t even know basic social etiquette..."

Alexander’s head snapped up. "Who said that?"

"Just... things I overheard at parties..."

"Specific dates. Locations." His gaze was piercing. "List every name."

Lydia paled. She hadn’t expected Alexander to press the issue.

Evelyn suddenly laughed. "They’re saying I’m inferior to Annabelle, right? I’ll admit to that."

The temperature in the room plummeted.

Alexander enunciated each word. "Give me every single name of those spreading rumors. Not one left out."
###Chapter 699: Turn Yourself In

Lydia Laurent's fingers clenched the fabric of her sleeve, her nails digging into her palms without her noticing. She blinked her large, watery eyes, her voice barely above a whisper. "Can I... not say it?"

Lily Waters tilted her head, studying her. The child's clear voice rang out sharply in the conference room. "But you were the one who brought it up first, weren't you?"

A flicker of disgust flashed in Lydia's eyes as her gaze swept over Lily's faded cloth shoes. She quickly replaced it with a sweet smile. "What's your name, sweetheart? You're adorable."

She reached out to touch Lily's face, but the girl dodged with surprising agility.

Lily immediately ducked behind Evelyn Carter. "Don't touch me."

Leonard Laurent frowned and snapped, "Where did this wild child come from? No manners at all. Did you pick her up from some backwater village?"

Evelyn instantly shielded both children behind her, her gaze sharp. "Mr. Laurent, watch your words. These children are under my care now."

Leonard's face darkened instantly. He had always prided himself on being part of the Hamilton family's inner circle—this kind of disrespect was unheard of for him.

Alexander Hamilton spoke coldly. "Mr. Laurent, you really don’t recognize them?"

Leonard immediately plastered on an ingratiating smile. "Mr. Hamilton, you must be joking. Why would I know some country kids?"

He was certain these children had been brought here by Evelyn. Alexander, ever the pragmatist, would never involve himself in something so trivial.

But Alexander's next words sent a chill down his spine.

"They're from Lotus Pond Village. Born and raised there. You didn’t even know that? Your project research is clearly lacking. Perhaps we should terminate it now to cut our losses."

His tone was calm, but brooked no argument.

Cold sweat broke out on Leonard's back. Alexander had brought these village children here—this was clearly a reckoning.

Remembering the fates of those who had crossed Alexander before, Leonard's legs nearly gave out. "Mr. Hamilton, I must have lost my mind this time. For the sake of our families' relationship, please show mercy..."

Alexander arched a brow but remained silent.

"My wife passed early, leaving me only Lydia. She’s been spoiled since childhood. If something happens to me, what will become of her?" Leonard pretended to wipe away nonexistent tears.

Lydia immediately burst into dramatic sobs. "Alexander, please... My father had no idea... We’ll compensate the villagers, I promise..."

She turned to Lily and her brother, tears welling in her eyes. "Sweetheart, I swear—"

Evelyn pulled the children and Bianca Langley’s baby closer. The baby stared curiously at the crying Lydia, confusion written across her tiny face.

Alexander suddenly pressed the intercom. "Emily, come in."

The Laurents held their breath.

"Bring a cushion."

The secretary quickly returned with a soft cushion. Alexander gestured for it to be given to Evelyn.

Evelyn looked at him, puzzled.

Emily placed the cushion respectfully behind Evelyn’s back. "Mrs. Hamilton, is this comfortable?"

The title "Mrs. Hamilton" made everyone freeze.

Alexander said mildly, "The mahogany sofa is too hard. This will help."

Evelyn’s ears turned pink. "That’s not necessary—"

"Use it." His tone left no room for refusal.

Emily retreated to stand outside the door.

Lydia’s sobs cut off abruptly.

Leonard’s forehead glistened with sweat. "Mr. Hamilton—"

"Mr. Laurent." Alexander cut him off. "Out of respect for our elders, I’ll give you this courtesy—turn yourself in."

Leonard’s face twisted. "You’re sentencing me without trial?"

"You know exactly what you’ve done." Alexander’s gaze was ice. "If you don’t go willingly, I’ll have no choice but to fulfill my civic duty."
###Chapter 700: The Honey Trap

Leonard Laurent's knuckles turned white, veins bulging on the back of his hand.

"Dad!" Lydia Laurent steadied her swaying father before turning to Alexander Hamilton with practiced doe-eyed vulnerability. "Alexander, Father isn't feeling well. We should take our leave."

Alexander's gaze sharpened like a blade. "As you wish."

Lydia guided her father out, her nails digging into his arm. "Not here, Father..."

A flicker of clarity passed through Leonard's clouded eyes as he stumbled after his daughter.

The office door had barely closed when Daisy Lee hurried in. "Mr. Hamilton, surveillance shows they went straight to the underground garage."

Alexander drummed his fingers against the desk in a measured rhythm.

"Lydia's more dangerous than we thought." Evelyn Carter spoke suddenly, then gave a self-deprecating smile. "Though it's just my intuition."

She didn't expect Alexander's response—this very distance made his eyes darken.

"Why assume I wouldn't believe you?" Alexander closed the distance abruptly, his breath grazing her ear.

Evelyn retreated half a step. "Her innocent act is masterful, but controlling the entire Laurent Group..."

A cooing sound interrupted from the stroller. Alexander lifted his daughter with practiced ease. The infant nuzzled against his arm before drifting back to sleep.

"I should've realized sooner." Alexander settled the child back, voice gravelly. "When Leonard suddenly proposed our marriage alliance, something felt off."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "So the CEO was playing along?"

"I wanted to see you jealous." He tugged at his tie with a bitter smirk. "Turns out I was the pawn. From the fake engagement to those business trips—all Lydia's designs."

Daisy interjected, "Sir, I have an idea."

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "A honey trap?"

Alexander's expression darkened instantly.

"After all Lydia's scheming for you..." Daisy adjusted her glasses. "Just dangle some bait—"

"Out of the question!" Alexander yanked his tie loose. "She wants Hamilton Group's resources, not this—"

"Living billboard." Evelyn gestured to the towering ad outside featuring Alexander's profile. "Your market value is... quite irresistible."

Lily Waters suddenly clung to Alexander's leg. "Please save our village!"

Her brother Lotus Waters pressed a faded photograph into his hands—a panoramic view of their soon-to-be-flooded hometown.

Alexander's throat worked before he exhaled heavily. "I'll go. On one condition."

He seized Evelyn's wrist, enunciating each word as she stared wide-eyed: "You'll be my personal 'technical advisor.'"
###Chapter 701: A Fresh Start

Evelyn Carter gave a slight nod. "You first."

She remained guarded, ready to refuse if his request was unreasonable.

Alexander Hamilton's gaze softened. "Move back to the Hamilton estate with the children. It's the only way I can rest easy."

He meant the ancestral Hamilton residence—a place Evelyn knew well.

Returning there with Lily Waters, her younger brother Lotus, and Bianca Langley's child would indeed be safer.

Even Leonard Laurent wouldn't dare cause trouble at the Hamilton estate.

Seeing her hesitation, Alexander added, "I'll stay in the guest room. The master suite is yours and the children's. And... Mr. and Mrs. Taylor miss you terribly."

His consideration was thorough.

Evelyn nodded gently. "Alright."

Daisy Lee immediately understood, turning to arrange for the chauffeur to deliver their belongings to the Taylor residence first.

A pang of disappointment struck Alexander, but he consoled himself with the progress made.

The phone rang abruptly.

This time, it was Lydia Laurent herself.

Alexander frowned but answered.

Silence lingered for seconds before Lydia's timid voice came through. "Alexander... are you still angry?"

His tone remained neutral. "How's your father?"

Feigning concern wasn't his strength, so he kept it brief.

Having witnessed her father's cowardly tactics of hiring thugs as scapegoats, Lydia decided to take matters into her own hands.

"Much better. Alexander, I want to apologize on his behalf... Could we meet tonight? At that private dining club—"

One of their few shared memories.

Disgusted by her faux innocence, Alexander cut in, "We can discuss this over the phone."

Evelyn suddenly brushed his arm lightly.

He caught her meaning instantly.

Lydia pressed on, "Some things are too sensitive for a call... Whatever you want to know, I'll make sure Father tells you..."

Alexander glanced at Evelyn, seeing the resolve in her eyes, and reluctantly agreed through gritted teeth. "Fine. Tonight."

Better to end this quickly.

Besides, Lydia's implication suggested Leonard would be present—a small relief.

The day passed swiftly.

Alexander divided his time between caring for the baby and handling work, while Evelyn took Lily and Lotus shopping.

As the appointed hour arrived, Evelyn couldn't help but laugh at Alexander's grim expression. "You're being too obvious."

Playing the charming seducer clearly didn't come naturally to him.

Suddenly, Alexander proposed, "Come with me?"

"No," Evelyn refused firmly. "My presence would make them clam up."

"What if I wear a hidden camera?"

He might as well have "Paragon of Male Virtue" tattooed on his forehead.

Lily suddenly raised her hand. "Let me go with you, brother! I'll help keep an eye on you for Evelyn!"

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Perfect."

Though reluctant, Alexander was grateful for the small ally—at least he wouldn't be facing them alone.

Lily behaved impeccably, only showing nerves when they arrived at the opulent private club.

Alexander gently patted her head. "Just stay close to me."

Looking at Lily, he found himself imagining what his and Evelyn's daughter might look like.

"Thank you, brother." Lily suddenly asked, "You and Evelyn aren't married, are you?"

Alexander smiled bitterly. "You noticed... We're divorced. But I'm trying to win her back."

Lily nodded, only half understanding.

The Laurents had prepared meticulously—even reserving the same private room.

Outside the window, artificial lotus ponds glittered with colored lights.

Alexander recalled the endless natural lotus ponds from the village, finding this manufactured scenery utterly bland.

Lily didn't even glance at it, sitting quietly by his side.
###Chapter 702: She Means the World to Me

Leonard Laurent and Lydia Laurent froze momentarily when they spotted the little girl beside Alexander Hamilton. But needing his favor, they quickly composed themselves.

Lydia's gaze swept over Lily Waters, inwardly scoffing at the country bumpkin while forcing a saccharine smile. "Alexander, who's this adorable little one?"

She reached to pat Lily's head, but the girl nimbly dodged.

Big eyes blinking, Lily declared, "I don't like strangers touching my hair, miss."

Lydia's smile stiffened.

Alexander smoothly intervened, "Let's eat. The child's hungry."

Leonard passed over the menu, probing, "Mr. Hamilton, I heard you enjoyed these dishes last time. I had them specially prepared."

"Whatever." Alexander's disinterested reply shifted when his eyes landed on Lily. "Add dessert. Children love sweets."

Misinterpreting this as softening toward Lydia, Leonard launched into emotional appeals. "At my age, everything I earn is for Lydia's future. If I can't secure her inheritance—"

Alexander's gaze turned icy. Once, such words might have moved him. Now they only tasted bitter.

When Alexander remained silent, Leonard excused himself. "I'll visit the restroom."

Alexander noted Lydia's subtle signal to her father with a slight nod.

Lydia had dressed meticulously—dewy makeup and a frothy dress transforming her into a porcelain doll. Biting her lip, she leaned closer. "Alexander, let's wait outside for Father—"

Crash.

Lily "accidentally" overturned an entire blueberry cake onto Lydia's dress.

"Sorry, miss!" Lily blinked innocently.

Lydia's face darkened as she suppressed fury. "It's...fine."

Alexander stood. "Since your father avoids business discussions, we're done."

"Alexander!" Lydia blurted. "Did you...really reconcile with Evelyn?"

His eyes sharpened. "Her choices are hers alone. But remember this—harm her, and you harm me."

He took Lily's hand and strode out.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter pushed a stroller near the Hamilton estate.

The affluent neighborhood boasted tree-lined streets dotted with pocket parks. Well-lit paths and 24/7 security ensured safety.

Margaret Hamilton had been overjoyed by Evelyn's visit with Lotus Waters and Baby Chloe, even forgetting her own son. Only midway through dinner did she ask, "Where's Alexander?"

Evelyn answered calmly, "He took Lily to meet a client. Said he's cultivating her business acumen."

Lotus ate quietly, offering nothing.

Margaret sighed. "That boy—too busy even for children."

Evelyn changed subjects. "Aunt Margaret, Miss Langley has matters to handle. The baby may stay awhile."

"Wonderful!" Margaret beamed. "I've been so lonely."

But when she reached for the baby, Chloe burst into tears.

Margaret fretted, "Too eager—I startled her."

Evelyn frowned. The baby usually welcomed strangers. Thinking of Bianca Langley's absence, her heart ached.

After dinner, Evelyn strolled with the stroller. Chloe giggled at the night sky, dark eyes crinkling like crescent moons.

As they turned homeward, Evelyn glimpsed a figure darting into shadows.
###Chapter 703 Someone's Watching You

The black baseball cap stood out conspicuously in the crowd.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the stroller handle, her palms damp with sweat. She subtly altered her course, steering toward the security booth.

Could it be one of Vincent's men?

The shadowy figure maintained a steady distance behind them, an inescapable presence.

"Dr. Carter!"

Lotus came running from the street corner, waving a baby bottle. "You forgot this!"

As he drew near, he lowered his voice. "Someone's following you."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Pretending to adjust the baby's blanket, she glimpsed the man in the baseball cap pretending to check his phone.

"Let's walk back slowly," she murmured. "Don't look back."

Lotus nodded, his hand gripping the stroller so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Streetlights stretched their three shadows long across the pavement. The pursuer hesitated, then continued trailing them.

Rounding the final corner, the Hamilton mansion came into view.

Evelyn whirled around—

A black sedan screeched to a halt, tires squealing against asphalt before vanishing into the night.

"I memorized the license plate," Lotus said, eyes gleaming.

Alexander returned with the chill of night air still clinging to him.

Only a nightlight illuminated the bedroom where Evelyn gently patted their sleeping baby. Seeing him enter, she pressed a finger to her lips.

The soft glow cast delicate shadows beneath her lashes.

Alexander lingered in the doorway, watching until the tightness in his chest eased. He retreated silently, changing in the adjacent room before returning.

"It's the Laurents," he whispered.

Evelyn exhaled in relief, then frowned. "They're making moves already?"

"I'll handle it tomorrow." His gaze drifted to the crib. "Sleep. I'll keep watch."

He settled into the armchair beside the bed, observing Evelyn's breathing gradually deepen. When Margaret entered, she found her son gazing at his wife and daughter.

"If only back then..." Margaret sighed.

Alexander shook his head gently. "We'll have our time."

Dawn had barely broken when lights flickered on in Hamilton Group's penthouse.

Emily Zade found three截然不同的 proposals spread across her boss's conference table.

"Notify all department heads," Alexander signed the final document without looking up. "Emergency meeting at nine."

The conference room air turned to ice.

When the projector displayed "Termination of Laurent Partnership," a director stood abruptly. "Mr. Hamilton, isn't this too sudden?"

Alexander spun his pen, the metal cap tapping rhythmically against the table.

"Three reasons." A new slide appeared. "First, Laurent fabricated last quarter's financials. Second, they stole our trade secrets. Third—"

A deliberate pause. His gaze sharpened to a blade's edge.

"Personal grounds."
###Chapter 704: Insistent on Seeing You

This move was even more ruthless than I had imagined—it aimed to uproot the Laurent family completely.

The conference room fell deathly silent. No one dared question his decision now.

News spread faster than wildfire. By dusk, word of Leonard Laurent being taken away by the police had exploded through the business circles.

The executives who had been uneasy earlier now secretly breathed sighs of relief.

"Mr. Hamilton truly has foresight. If he hadn't acted decisively, we'd all be implicated when Leonard's poisoning scheme came to light."

"The way Mr. Hamilton handled the Laurents with dignity during the meeting... such magnanimity..."

Xiao Zhao weaved through the buzzing office area and gently knocked on Alexander Hamilton's door.

"Mr. Hamilton, Miss Lydia is here at reception. She refuses to leave, insisting on seeing you."

Leonard had been escorted away in full view of everyone. The Laurent ship was clearly sinking.

Yet Lydia remained composed, maintaining her delicate, pitiable demeanor as she stood in the most conspicuous spot of Hamilton Group's lobby.

Alexander listened to the report and let out a cold laugh. "I underestimated her. Even dignity is just a bargaining chip to her. If she truly decides to fight me, it'll take real effort."

Xiao Zhao ventured cautiously, "Will you see her? She says she's at her wits' end about how to save Leonard."

A glint flashed in Alexander's eyes as he caught the crucial detail.

After a thoughtful pause, he said, "I need to call Evelyn first."

Xiao Zhao couldn't help a small smile. "Mr. Hamilton, you're really embracing married life now."

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted slightly. "This is how I should be."

The call connected quickly.

"...That's the situation. I might be home late," he said, his voice uncharacteristically gentle. "Let Mom know for me."

Evelyn's voice came through the receiver. "Actually, I'm taking the baby to see my mom and Emily today. I'll probably be back even later than you."

"Taking the baby with you?" Alexander instinctively softened his tone.

"Yes. She only wants me now—Auntie Wu and Auntie Bai can't even hold her." Evelyn sighed. "Consider it a little outing for them."

The image formed vividly in Alexander's mind, making his voice even tenderer. "I'll pick you up when I'm done here. It's time I visited Auntie Grace too."

After hanging up, Alexander adjusted his tie and strode toward the elevator.

The moment Lydia spotted him, she lunged forward, clutching desperately at his sleeve.

"Alexander..." Tears streamed down her face like pear blossoms in the rain. "Dad was taken away... What should I do..."

Alexander stepped back half a pace without expression. "Didn't you want to see your father? Let's go."

Lydia seized his sleeve again, wailing loudly for all to hear. "The police said they're taking Dad back to the town—"

Alexander glanced at the gathering employees and lowered his voice. "We'll talk in the car."

Having just severed ties with the Laurents that morning, being seen leaving with Lydia now would inevitably raise eyebrows.

A cold glint flickered in Lydia's eyes before she resumed her fragile act. "Alexander... You're all I have now..."

Stone-faced, Alexander led her out.

The moment they left, the reception area erupted.

"Wasn't that Miss Laurent? Didn't Mr. Hamilton just—"

"Could they still be involved privately?"

Xiao Zhao materialized behind them. "Is the reception team's material prepared?"

The gossiping receptionists instantly fell silent.

Watching Alexander's departing figure, Xiao Zhao frowned deeply. Emily had repeatedly warned her to be wary of the Laurent father-daughter pair before leaving. This storm was likely just beginning.

Alexander had traveled this road to the town before. He started the car smoothly and headed straight for the highway entrance.

Noticing he didn't even turn on the GPS, Lydia's eyes flashed with something strange, but she still took the passenger seat with red-rimmed eyes.

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly, his gaze suddenly sharpening.
###Chapter 705: This Seat Isn't for You

Lydia Laurent buckled her seatbelt absentmindedly, her voice trembling. "Alexander, I'm so cold. Could you roll up the window?"

She hugged herself, her slender frame shivering in the evening chill.

Alexander Hamilton impassively raised the window. "Move to the back."

"Huh?"

"This seat isn't for you." His tone was icy, leaving no room for argument.

Lydia bit her lip and silently unbuckled, sliding into the rear seat.

As the engine started, the doors automatically locked, sealing them in the quiet space with only the sound of their breathing.

Lydia pulled a scented tissue from her bag, its cloying fragrance overpowering in the confined space. Alexander subtly cracked the window open.

"Alexander," she whispered between sniffles, "will my father... ever get out?"

"Wait for the police investigation."

The hum of the air conditioning filled the heavy silence. An inexplicable exhaustion washed over Alexander—more intense than during his days searching for Evelyn Carter.

Lydia stole a glance at his profile. "You look tired."

"I'm not."

Her gaze landed on the water bottle in the console. "I... I'm thirsty."

"Take it yourself."

By the time they entered the highway ramp, darkness had fully descended. Under the cover of night, Lydia discreetly emptied a hidden powder into the water and gave it a gentle shake.

"Alexander," she cooed, "your eyes are bloodshot. Let me drive?"

He arched a brow. "You know the way?"

"We can use GPS..."

His fingers tapped the steering wheel twice. "Fine."

The mountain road was riddled with forks where navigation often failed. If Lydia could actually find the village...

"I'll rest in the back." Alexander pulled over to switch seats, casually taking the opened water bottle with him.

Lydia turned down the GPS volume, flashing a strange smile in the rearview mirror. "Don't worry. I'll drive carefully."

The drug took effect swiftly. Just before slipping into unconsciousness, Alexander jolted awake.

"Where are we?" His voice was hoarse, his limbs leaden.

Lydia slammed the brakes, nearly sending them off the road. In the jolt, Alexander glimpsed unfamiliar wilderness outside.

"Where are you taking me?" His gaze turned razor-sharp.

Lydia's shoulders stiffened visibly. "To see Father. He's waiting."

"This isn't the way to town." Alexander's voice dropped dangerously. "You detoured on purpose."

She met his eyes in the mirror and suddenly laughed. "Alexander, don't you trust me? I'm practically your little sister."

"Not anymore." His laugh was cold.

Lydia's mirth died instantly. Her reflection showed dead, hollow eyes. "Just a joke. I took a wrong turn. We'll turn back now."
###Chapter 706 I've Been With You All Along

Alexander Hamilton fought against his fading consciousness, trembling fingers fumbling inside his suit jacket. His phone was still there. Without hesitation, he pressed the emergency contact.

It was Evelyn Carter's number.

Beep—beep—

The endless ringing pierced the silent car interior.

"The number you dialed is currently unavailable..."

The robotic female voice repeated coldly. Alexander clenched the phone until his knuckles turned white. Finally, he understood how Evelyn must have felt all those times she'd called him.

Lydia Laurent watched him through the rearview mirror, her lips curving into a saccharine smile. "Alexander, don't waste your energy."

His bloodshot eyes snapped up. "What did you do to her?"

"How would I know?" Lydia tilted her head with an innocent giggle. "I've been with you the whole time."

Gritting his teeth, Alexander dialed Grace Anderson instead.

"Mr. Hamilton?" Grace's voice trembled with concern. "Is Evelyn alright?"

"She... isn't with you?" His voice strained.

"No, I thought she was with you!" Grace's tone turned frantic. "What's going on?"

Alexander suppressed the turmoil inside. "It's nothing. She must be running late."

After hanging up, he glared at the back of Lydia's head. "Did Leonard send you?"

Lydia's laughter tinkled like wind chimes. "Alexander, remember when we were children? You promised to protect me forever."

The car turned onto a pitch-black forest path.

"Now it's my turn to protect you," she whispered. "We're going somewhere no one will ever find us. Together forever—"

Alexander wrenched the door open and leaped out.

——

Evelyn stood at the old house's gate with Baby Chloe in her arms as Grace rushed out to meet her.

"Mom, did Alexander call?" she asked urgently.

Grace nodded. "He said you were coming to visit and asked if you'd arrived."

Evelyn's heart lurched. She pulled out her phone—three missed calls glared back at her.

The return call only met with an automated shutdown message.

"Something's wrong." Her voice shook.

Grace paled. "How could—"

"Mom, watch the children." Evelyn handed the baby over and turned to run.

The gate suddenly rattled with knocking.

Two police officers stood outside. "Are you Evelyn Carter?"
###Chapter 707: Undercurrents of Danger

Two unfamiliar officers stood at the door, their crisp uniforms failing to conceal the unease in their eyes. Evelyn frowned slightly—she didn’t recall seeing these men by the village pond.

"Miss Carter?"

"That’s me."

"We have new leads in the pond corpse case. Your cooperation is required." The lead officer flashed his badge briefly. "We went to the Hamilton residence first. They said you’d be here."

Evelyn’s gaze flickered over the badge. The embossed seal gleamed coldly under the light. She stole a glance at the patrol car parked outside, its rooftop lights pulsing silently.

"Right now?"

"It’s urgent."

Lily suddenly grabbed Evelyn’s sleeve. "Dr. Carter, my brother and I want to come too! We were both there that day!"

The older officer’s face darkened. "Absolutely not!" His voice spiked before dropping to a harsh whisper. "Minors aren’t permitted in criminal interrogations."

Evelyn’s fingers twitched. She remembered clearly—Lotus had been the first to discover the bones. The police had taken his statement specifically.

"One moment." She turned back inside, whispering urgently into Lily’s ear: "Contact the Hamilton driver. Have Grandma Grace and the children leave immediately." She pressed a slip of paper with a phone number into Lily’s pocket.

Grace approached, cradling the baby. "What’s happening?"

"Mom, do exactly as Lily says." Evelyn squeezed her mother’s hand tightly. "Trust me."

Returning to the patrol car, Evelyn opened the rear door herself. The officer in the passenger seat was texting, the screen’s blue glow highlighting his tense jawline.

As they merged onto the main road, Evelyn spoke suddenly: "The victim was the missing accountant from the neighboring village, wasn’t he? The one who embezzled the levee funds."

The driver slammed the brakes.

"Ridiculous!" The passenger snapped before adding hastily, "Case details aren’t for discussion."

Evelyn lowered her lashes. She’d invented the accountant’s name on the spot.

When they passed a 24-hour pharmacy, Evelyn clutched her ankle. "Could we stop? My old sprain from escaping last time is acting up."

The officers exchanged glances before reluctantly pulling over.

Evelyn walked straight through the store aisles and pushed open the back door. Icy wind greeted her as furious curses erupted behind her.

A security booth glowed at the corner. Stumbling inside, Evelyn thrust her phone at the officer on duty, displaying the patrol car photo: "Those men are impersonating police!"

Beyond the glass, blinding high beams flared to life. The fake patrol car was accelerating toward them like a maddened beast.
###Chapter 708: Inside Job

"Police uniforms? Forging law enforcement attire is a felony!"

"Criminals posing as officers pose an even greater threat."

"Take me to the scene immediately!"

The real officers followed Evelyn Carter toward the pharmacy.

The two imposters panicked when they lost their target. By the time they tried to flee, it was too late.

After briefing the police, Evelyn hailed a cab back to the Hamilton estate. En route, she dialed Margaret Hamilton.

Alexander Hamilton's disappearance coinciding with the fake cops' appearance was too suspicious to ignore.

The call connected on the first ring.

"Evelyn! Are you alright? Lily and Lotus told me your mother and the baby arrived safely. We've been frantic—neither you nor Alexander would answer..."

Margaret's voice trembled with urgency.

"My apologies, Margaret. I had to silence my phone during the emergency." Evelyn kept her tone steady. "The imposters have been apprehended."

A sharp inhale came through the line.

"They were really fake? Evelyn, come home at once. It's too dangerous out there. Where could that boy have gone..."

Margaret's words shook with distress.

After confirming her family's safety, Evelyn soothed, "Alexander is handling critical business. He'll contact you when finished."

She couldn't reveal he'd vanished with Lydia Laurent.

"Impersonating officers is a serious crime. I'll return after wrapping things up." Evelyn deflected.

"You young people shouldn't keep such late hours..." Margaret fretted, glancing at the clock.

Evelyn maintained composure, betraying no alarm. Hanging up, she told the driver, "Change of destination—Hamilton Tower."

The cabbie chuckled. "Working this late?"

"...Yes." The response was absentminded.

Her mind raced through Alexander's possible locations. The corporate headquarters was the most promising lead.

Hamilton Tower blazed with light.

Natalie Stapleton was managing sudden chaos. Employees from Operations, the Board, and Finance—all with Laurent Group ties—were causing disruptions.

The seasoned executive immediately had the secretarial team secure the CEO's office, herding protesters into a conference room.

Evelyn spotted the anomaly instantly. Calmly informing reception, "I'm retrieving a forgotten item. Is Natalie available?"

The front desk understood, notifying Natalie immediately.

In the elevator, they exchanged rapid updates.

"If something happened, Alexander would've reached out. But both he and Lydia are offline." Natalie sounded exhausted. "Banyan Group is in complete disarray."

"Emily Zade won't return until tomorrow. With no leadership..."

Evelyn cut to the chase. "Give it to me straight."

Natalie delivered the report: "Tonight was the scheduled payment to the Laurents. Despite Alexander terminating the deal, the project lead insists on processing it."

"Alexander gave direct orders. How can he defy them?"

"Personal interests in the venture." Natalie lowered her voice. "Stranger still, other departments suddenly claim the agreement remains valid."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "They're exploiting loopholes. Why would Hamilton employees advocate for the Laurents? Unless..."

Their eyes met, both arriving at the same conclusion: Someone inside was collaborating, knowing Alexander couldn't intervene.
###Chapter 709: Marital Assets

Evelyn's fingers tapped lightly on the conference table.

The management knowledge she'd crammed to take over Anderson Group now raced through her mind. Alexander's business case studies surfaced with perfect clarity.

A flicker of admiration crossed Natalie's eyes.

"Madam, the whole company knows Mr. Hamilton was taken away by Lydia. All I can do is guard his office door."

Evelyn's gaze darkened. "Moving such a large sum requires Alexander's signature or seal. They wouldn't dare force it."

The elevator doors opened on the ground floor.

Heated arguments echoed clearly from the hallway outside the conference room. Natalie lowered her voice. "There's a senior board member inside who worked with Mr. Hamilton's father—"

"I understand." Evelyn massaged her temples. The commotion alone revealed what verbal battle Natalie had endured.

Natalie gave a wry smile. "Emily briefed me thoroughly, but given this situation, only Mr. Hamilton's presence could calm them."

Evelyn redialed Alexander's number. Still no answer.

"Madam," Natalie inhaled sharply, "you're the only one who can represent Mr. Hamilton now."

Evelyn nodded faintly. "I'll try."

The conference room door burst open.

Executives mid-table-pounding froze mid-gesture as the clamor died instantly.

The project lead frowned at Evelyn. "Who's this?"

Natalie straightened. "This is Mrs. Hamilton."

The room erupted.

The elderly board member narrowed his eyes. "You're... the Anderson daughter they just recognized?"

"Correct." Evelyn met his gaze squarely.

A snide voice cut in. "No wonder Mr. Hamilton favors Anderson Group—old flames die hard—"

Evelyn's icy stare silenced the speaker. "I'm here to protect my legal rights, not listen to gossip."

The project lead raised his hands. "I said nothing, Mrs. Hamilton."

The talkative employee mumbled, "I heard you and Mr. Hamilton divorced..."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

These people were far more cunning than Anderson Group's old foxes.

She calmly lifted her teacup. "Alexander and I were married three years without a prenup. By law, half of Hamilton Group's profits during that period belong to me."

The room went deathly silent.

The project lead suddenly laughed. "With Mr. Hamilton absent, who can verify your identity?" His eyes widened in mock realization. "You're here to cash in during the chaos?"

Evelyn's lips curved slightly.

"The funds can remain untouched. But until Alexander returns to authorize it, that money stays frozen in Hamilton Group's accounts."

Executives exchanged uneasy glances.

Someone jumped up. "Mrs. Hamilton, you're jeopardizing critical company business!"

Evelyn checked the wall clock. "Negotiating at 1 AM? Did Banyan Group relocate to the moon?"

Natalie delivered the final blow. "Guilty consciences prefer conducting shady deals at midnight."
###Chapter 710 What Have You Done to Her?

The senior board member narrowed his eyes, already calculating his next move.

"Mrs. Hamilton, your points are valid. But you and Mr. Hamilton are divorced now. With him absent, these are just your claims. If the payment is delayed and the company's reputation suffers, who will take responsibility?"

The project manager's forehead glistened with sweat. He desperately needed that kickback to cover his losses. With the Laurent family unreachable, the cash flow was on the verge of collapse. If the deal fell through, his shady dealings would be exposed.

Evelyn gave him a cool glance, her gaze as calm as still water.

"I heard you've been overseeing this project. Now that the Laurents are clearly in trouble, why the rush for payment? Aren't you worried about the company's funds going down the drain?" She paused. "I have a stake in this too."

She knew full well that Hamilton Group's funds had nothing to do with her—even Alexander couldn't access them freely. But to thwart their scheme, she had to play along.

The manager's face turned ashen. Humiliated, he slammed the table and stood. "Are you questioning my professionalism?"

Evelyn calmly lifted her teacup. "I'm merely raising reasonable concerns."

The tension in the boardroom thickened. Finally, the old fox softened his tone. "Mrs. Hamilton, how about we wait for Mr. Hamilton's return before making a decision?"

He was banking on a delay tactic. No one knew when Alexander would be back, and Evelyn couldn't camp out at the company indefinitely. Once she left, they could push things through.

The senior board member shot the manager a meaningful look.

Just as the manager was about to speak, Evelyn abruptly stood.

"Fine. We'll wait for Mr. Hamilton." She turned to her assistant. "Call for backup."

"Yes, ma'am!"

Before anyone could react, Evelyn strode straight to Alexander's office with her assistant in tow. When they emerged, they'd taken not just his laptop but also his seal and critical documents.

The office was nearly stripped bare, leaving only the furniture behind.

Several staff members wanted to stop her but had no grounds. They could only watch helplessly as the company seal was carried away.

The finance team scattered like startled birds. A subordinate whispered nervously, "Should we... still transfer the funds?"

"Without the seal? Impossible!" The manager glared at the senior board member, teeth clenched. "Should we—"

The older man cut him off with a dark look. "This has nothing to do with us. I need to make a call."

Meanwhile, Alexander finally stirred from unconsciousness.

His last memory was blinding headlights and the world spinning violently. The drugs and impact had knocked him out cold.

An unfamiliar ceiling greeted him when he opened his eyes.

The spacious room was sparsely furnished, like a suburban villa. Though the windows were wide, they were barred with steel.

"Alex, you're awake." Lydia's saccharine voice floated from beside the bed.

Alexander tried to move his arms but found them barely responsive. His gaze turned icy. "What did you drug me with?"

Lydia, dressed in a frilly doll-like dress, propped her chin on her hands. "I had no choice. You don't see how good I am for you yet, so I brought you here. Once we spend more time together, you'll understand my feelings."

His eyes darkened like ink. "Where is this?"

He needed to buy time. His greatest worry was Evelyn's safety in his absence.

"This place?" Lydia fiddled with the lace on her skirt. "It's somewhere nice and private."

Suppressing his rage, Alexander changed tactics. "Keeping me locked up means abandoning your father?"

Lydia tilted her head thoughtfully. "Of course I want to save Daddy. But Alex, you were lying, weren't you? You never planned to help him."

This house was her carefully chosen fortress—utterly secure. For once, she spoke honestly.

"Just relax and stay here. I'll take good care of you." She beamed sweetly. "As for Daddy... once things are settled outside, he'll join us. Then we'll be one happy family."

Alexander's voice dropped to a dangerous chill. "How exactly do you plan to 'settle' things? That village has hundreds of people. You can't silence them all."

"Of course not." Lydia blinked innocently. "But everyone has weaknesses. Either pay them off or... make an example. There are always ways."

"An example?" Alexander sat bolt upright. "What else are you planning? To turn people into vegetables like that college student?!"

"Don't be mad, Alex~" She pouted. "Those ingrates had their chance when I developed the mountain village, but they got greedy. People like that need... persuasion."

His pupils constricted. "So this was all your idea."

"I'd make a better CEO than Evelyn, don't you think?" Lydia preened. "Once I inherit Banyan Group, you can teach me everything. I'll learn faster than her. That rigid mind of hers only belongs in an operating room."

Alexander's fists clenched the sheets, his voice trembling with suppressed fury. "Where's Evelyn? What have you done to her?"
###Chapter 711: Car Crash

Lydia Laurent's fingers twisted together until her knuckles turned white. Her lips curved into a sweet smile, but her eyes were terrifyingly hollow. "Alexander, we finally have time alone. Let's not talk about others, okay?"

Her voice was feather-light, laced with bone-chilling obsession.

"You promised it would be just the two of us in the capital last time..." Her nails dug deep into her palms. "I know you went to see her that night. I stayed awake all night thinking... One day, we'll be like that too..."

Dawn had barely broken when Evelyn Carter jolted awake from a nightmare.

She sat up abruptly, her forehead damp with cold sweat. The empty living room of the old house held only her.

When she'd returned Alexander's belongings in the early hours, Aunt Margaret was still awake. If they couldn't find him today...

"Dr. Carter, are you worried about my brother?" Lily Waters rubbed her sleepy eyes and tugged gently at Evelyn's sleeve.

Evelyn opened her mouth but only managed to massage her temples wearily. "Why are you up so early? Go back to sleep."

"I'm worried about you." Lily leaned closer, whispering, "Lotus says that fake cop last night looked like the man who was following you before."

Evelyn's chest tightened. She'd suspected the same, but what unsettled her more were the strange behaviors of those people in the conference room.

At the breakfast table, only Baby Chloe ate happily. Evelyn mechanically chewed her food, tasting nothing.

"Waaah—" The baby suddenly let out a heart-wrenching scream.

Grace Anderson and Auntie Wu fumbled to soothe her, but the little one's face turned red as she stretched her tiny hands desperately toward Evelyn.

"This child only recognizes you and Alexander." Margaret Hamilton wrung her hands anxiously. "Evelyn, maybe you could go to the office later?"

As soon as Evelyn took the baby, the crying stopped instantly. Small fingers clutched tightly at her hair.

Her heart melted completely, but with Alexander missing, she had to go to the company. With all drivers dispatched to search for him, she had no choice but to drive herself.

"Dr. Carter, let me hold her." Lily pulled Lotus over. "I took care of Lotus when he was little."

Margaret and Grace exchanged a glance before quickly preparing the baby supplies.

During the ride, Lily and Lotus guarded the baby like two little sentinels on either side.

At the office, the project manager repeatedly came to pick fights. Evelyn remained composed, subtly planting seeds of doubt in return.

"Ms. Carter, you look unwell." Young Zhao said with concern.

Evelyn shook her head. "Notify me immediately if there's any news."

After work, she declined the company driver. Zhao had taken people to investigate Lydia's whereabouts—she only trusted herself now.

As the car merged onto the main road, Evelyn's tense nerves relaxed slightly.

"Baby was so good today." She glanced in the rearview mirror. "Usually even my mother can't..."

BANG!

The deafening crash cut her off.

Evelyn slammed the brakes, narrowly avoiding a pileup. Two cars had collided ahead, their drivers now shouting furiously.

"Everyone okay?" She turned to check on the children.

Before the words fully left her mouth, a tremendous impact struck from the side.

The world spun violently.

The seatbelt choked her, but she still threw herself backward, shielding the children with her body.

"Hold on!" Lotus roared, gripping his sister and the baby carrier with all his strength.

The screech of twisting metal pierced their ears.

When the rolling car finally stopped, Evelyn's head slammed hard against the seat. Fighting dizziness, she struggled to unbuckle herself.

"Baby! Lily! Lotus!" Her voice came out hoarse, unrecognizable.

"We're okay!" Lotus called from the back. "But the baby's terrified."

The infant's wails tore through the air.

Evelyn fumbled for her phone, only to find the screen shattered. Blood dripped from her glass-cut fingers onto the broken device.
###Chapter 712: Lethal Trap

The screech of tires against asphalt shattered the night.

Evelyn Carter felt the world spin violently as inertia slammed her against the car door. When the airbag deployed, she instinctively shielded the baby in her arms.

"Dr. Carter!" Lily Waters' terrified scream was drowned by the deafening crunch of twisting metal.

The roof smashed into the ground as glass rained down like hail. Blinking through the pain, Evelyn saw their vehicle overturned in a grassy median.

"Help! There are injured people here!"

Voices of bystanders grew closer. Shadowy figures swarmed around the wreck, fists pounding against the shattered windows.

"Are they alive in there?"

Fighting dizziness, Evelyn realized her arm was pinned by the mangled door. Gritting her teeth, she handed the wailing baby to Lily in the backseat. "Get the child out first!"

The door was jammed beyond recognition. A man in a baseball cap wrenched it open with brute force, allowing Lily to scramble out with the infant.

"Lotus, go!" Evelyn pushed the teenage boy toward the exit.

The moment Lotus Waters cleared the wreckage, the situation turned.

The helpful strangers' faces darkened. Two men seized Lily and Lotus with practiced efficiency, clamping hands over their mouths.

"What are you doing?!" Evelyn's pupils contracted violently.

The baseball cap man smirked, producing a stun gun from his waistband. Lotus thrashed but collapsed when electricity coursed through him.

"Let them go!" Evelyn strained against the wreckage trapping her.

A van's engine roared closer. Lily and the baby were shoved inside like cargo, Lotus tossed in after them.

"Dr. Carter, help—" Lily's scream was cut short.

The van doors slammed shut, tires squealing as it vanished into the night.

Only Evelyn and the baseball cap man remained in the grassy ditch. Streetlights stretched his shadow into a drawn blade.

"You're Lydia Laurent's people." Evelyn's voice trembled with certainty.

The man crouched, tilting her chin up with a wrench. "Mrs. Hamilton's as sharp as they say. But you're coming with us now."

As he yanked her arm, Evelyn wedged her wristwatch into the door seam. The band snapped clean off.

"No tricks!" He raised the wrench threateningly.

Evelyn suddenly smiled. "You grabbed the wrong hostage."

The man froze.

"Didn't Lydia tell you?" Her gaze locked onto his. "Alexander Hamilton and I divorced months ago. Using me as leverage? How naïve."

Two more thugs emerged from the shadows. One held up a phone displaying Lily, Lotus, and the baby bound to chairs.

"What about these brats then?" He tapped play, releasing the children's screams into the night. "Think the great Mr. Hamilton will ignore them?"

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms.

Sirens wailed in the distance. The baseball cap man snarled, grabbing her collar—"Move!"

Pain exploded at the base of her skull. Before darkness swallowed her, Evelyn caught a familiar scent on his cuff—the iris perfume Lydia always wore.

Drip. Drip.

Consciousness returned to the rhythm of water droplets.

Evelyn found herself bound to a metal chair under blinding fluorescent lights. Mold streaked the concrete walls, the air thick with damp decay.

"Awake?"

High heels clicked from the shadows. The woman wore a mask, but those upturned phoenix eyes were unmistakable.

"Lydia." Evelyn's voice scraped raw. "Finally dropped the innocent act."

A gloved hand removed the mask.

"Don't be like that, Evelyn." Lydia Laurent tilted her head, twirling a scalpel. "Alexander always loved me best when I played sweet."

The blade traced Evelyn's cheek, drawing a crimson line.

"Where is he?" Evelyn held her gaze.

Lydia backhanded her hard enough to draw blood. "You don't get to ask!"

Evelyn licked her split lip and smiled. "You're scared."

"Shut up!" The scalpel trembled near Evelyn's eye. "I'll carve up that pretty face!"

"You won't." Evelyn remained calm. "Kill me, and Alexander will tear you apart limb by limb."

The scalpel clattered to the floor.

Lydia's face twisted. She snatched a walkie-talkie. "Bring them in!"

Rusted hinges groaned. Three bound children were shoved forward—Lily tear-streaked, Lotus bleeding from his forehead, the baby screaming itself hoarse.

"Choose." Lydia accepted a pistol from a guard. "You die, or they do."

Evelyn's breath stopped.

The gun muzzle touched each child's forehead. Lydia's finger curled around the trigger, her smile poison-sweet. "Counting down—"

"One."

The baby's cries echoed through the warehouse.

"Two."

Lotus lunged—only to be kicked aside.

"Three."

Bang!

The gunshot shattered the silence.
###Chapter 713: The Price Game

Blinding light suddenly tore through the darkness.

Evelyn instinctively turned her head away, her lashes fluttering against the harsh glare. When her vision finally cleared, several rough-looking men stood in a circle around her.

The children were nowhere in sight.

"Where are they?" Her voice was hoarse, as if scraped by sandpaper.

The leader smirked, his greasy gaze raking over her. "The brats are fine, locked up somewhere else. We're here just for you."

He whistled, leaning in to examine Evelyn's delicate features. "Alexander has good taste. This face, this figure—" He suddenly made a crude gesture. "Did you pop out all three of his kids?"

Laughter exploded through the warehouse.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. She knew exactly what they were waiting for—a crack in her defenses.

"How much did the Laurents pay you?" she asked abruptly.

The laughter died instantly.

The leader narrowed his eyes. "What, Mrs. Hamilton looking to outbid them?" He rubbed his fingers together. "Name your price. Everything's negotiable."

Her back pressed against the cold wall, Evelyn kept working her broken nails against the ropes. "Leonard Laurent is already behind bars. Didn't you know?"

Murmurs rippled through the group.

"The Hamilton Group cut off funding to Banyan Group." She locked eyes with the leader. "Billions in projects frozen overnight. You really think Lydia can pay you now?"

A blond thug blurted, "Boss, I heard criminals' assets get frozen—"

"Shut it!" The leader smacked the back of his head, then sneered at Evelyn. "Nice try. Miss Laurent said we dump your body in the ocean when we're done. Alexander won't even find your corpse!"

His hand shot toward her collar.

"One million," Evelyn said calmly.

The hand froze midair.

"That's what the Laurents promised, right?" A faint smile touched her lips. "With a 500K deposit already paid?"

The leader's face darkened. "How'd you know?"

"Lucky guess." She flexed her numb wrists. "A million sounds good, but split eight ways—" Her gaze swept over the men. "Plus whoever's guarding the kids? What's left?"

"Bullshit!" The leader exploded. "Those suit-wearing leeches keep all the clean money! We do the dirty work and get scraps!"

Someone muttered, "Jail time costs extra."

Evelyn knew her gamble had paid off.

"Anderson Pharmaceuticals has far more liquidity than the Laurents right now." She spoke slowly, each word a hook. "You've kidnapped the future Mrs. Hamilton."

The warehouse fell so quiet she could hear breathing.

The leader's Adam's apple bobbed.
###Chapter 714: I'll Wait for You to Beg Me

So there were divisions within their ranks.

Evelyn lowered her gaze, a plan forming in her mind. "Write a ransom note and send it to Anderson Construction. Tell them I've been kidnapped. As the only daughter of the Anderson family, they'll pay."

The gang leader's eyes lit up. "Can the Andersons produce three million right away?"

"Of course," Evelyn stated firmly.

The surrounding thugs began breathing heavily. The leader rubbed his hands together but suddenly hesitated. "What if they call the police?"

"You can collect the money first, then release me. My parents wouldn't risk my life."

A lackey suddenly piped up, "Boss, she's not just an Anderson heiress—she's Alexander Hamilton's woman!"

The leader slapped his thigh. "Then we'll demand another payment from the Hamiltons! Three million from the Andersons, and at least ten million from Hamilton Group!"

"But Alexander is currently under Lydia Laurent's control..." another thug hesitated.

The leader spat. "These rich bastards are all the same! Living in luxury while we risk our necks!"

Evelyn exhaled silently in relief. At least she'd confirmed Alexander was with Lydia and temporarily safe.

"The Andersons can add another two million," she suggested calmly.

The leader eyed her greedily. "We'll need proof of life."

"Cut off a finger?" someone proposed.

"Idiot!" the leader roared. "Alexander lived in the slums for her. Harm one finger, and how many lives do you think you have to spare?"

Evelyn remained composed. "Take the button from my sleeve. My family will recognize it."

The leader changed tactics. "Make it six million!" He ripped off the button and handed it to a lackey. "Then demand ten million from Hamilton Group—five million minimum. Tell that secretary if they don't pay, they can collect the boss's wife in a body bag!"

As the thugs left, Evelyn finally relaxed.

The Andersons could scrape together the money, but Hamilton Group... Emily Zade had limited authority. Would she be able to reach Alexander?

A full day and night had passed. Had he found a way to escape?

Meanwhile, Alexander's water glass slipped from his grasp and shattered.

"Third one today," Lydia sang, pouring a fourth glass. "If you keep misbehaving, Evelyn might—"

"I'll drink it." He drained the glass in one go.

Lydia's smile turned icy. "How predictable. Only her name gets through to you."

"Don't drag innocents into this."

"How touching." She tilted her head. "Why can't it be me?"

"Another glass," Alexander suddenly said.

Lydia raised an eyebrow. "Suddenly obedient?"

As she turned, he swiftly pocketed a shard of broken glass.

"Drink up." She handed him the fifth glass.

He took a sip. "Get out."

"Fine." Lydia reached the doorway, then glanced back with a dazzling smile. "But soon, you'll be begging me to return."
###Chapter 715: Alexander, Do You Love Me?

She gently closed the door, shutting out the last sliver of light.

Darkness swallowed the room once more.

Alexander felt his consciousness slipping.

This wasn't ordinary sedatives—it was a drug designed to unleash primal desires. Evelyn's face kept flashing before his eyes—not the icy woman she'd become, but the warm, smiling wife he once knew.

Heat surged through his veins. He bit his lower lip until it bled.

Lydia actually drugged his water!

With a sharp movement, he dragged a hidden shard of glass across his palm. The searing pain brought momentary clarity. Blood dripped between his fingers, blooming crimson on the floor.

The door creaked open again.

Lydia reappeared in a white sundress, the hem swaying with each step. She leaned close, her breath warm against his ear. "Does it hurt, Alexander?"

"Genes like yours shouldn't go to waste." Her finger traced his Adam's apple. "Our child would be perfect."

He turned away, voice ragged. "You're insane! Children aren't possessions!"

"Possessions?" Lydia laughed lightly. "They're living masterpieces. Look—I even wore Evelyn's favorite style..."

She mimicked Evelyn's posture. In the dim light, the resemblance was uncanny.

"Evelyn..." Alexander's gaze grew unfocused.

Lydia seized the moment to loosen his tie. "Yes, I'm Evelyn. Say you love me—"

Her fingers barely grazed his chest when his eyes snapped open. The glass shard dug deeper into his palm, staining his cuff scarlet.

"You're not her." His voice cut like ice. "Evelyn would never do this."

Lydia's face twisted. Before she could react, Alexander lunged. The bloodied glass pressed against her throat, drawing a thin red line.

"Call my car." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Or I'll slit your throat here."

"You wouldn't dare!" she shrieked.

The glass bit deeper. A trickle of blood ran down her neck.

"Try me."

Finding the guards absent, Alexander didn't hesitate to knock Lydia unconscious. Staggering out, every step was a battle against the drugs coursing through him.

When Alexander crashed into Hamilton Group's lobby, bloodied and disheveled, Natalie was clutching a ransom note.

"Mr. Hamilton!" she gasped.

He gripped her shoulders. "Where's Evelyn?"

Natalie handed him an envelope with trembling hands. "She and the children vanished last night. This was in their car..."

Alexander froze at the sight of the button. Bringing it to his nose, his pupils constricted.

"Test this immediately!" His voice cracked. "Evelyn left us a clue!"

Meanwhile, in an abandoned warehouse outside town...

The gang leader grinned at his banking app notification. "Five million! Easy money!"

Evelyn sat bound to a chair, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"I told you Alexander would pay." Her voice remained calm. "But are you sure five million is enough?"

The leader's eyes narrowed. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"How much is the Laurent family offering?" Evelyn met his gaze. "Let's make a deal."

The thugs exchanged glances. The leader grabbed her chin. "No tricks!"

"Ten million for my freedom. Otherwise..." She smiled coolly. "Do you really think Alexander will let his wife's kidnappers walk away?"

Silence fell over the warehouse.

After a long pause, the leader released her with a crooked grin. "Fine. Ten million. But this time, we write the note my way."

Evelyn lowered her lashes, masking her calculations.

By now, they must have found the message on that button.
###Chapter 716: Evelyn's Secret Signal

The gang leader rubbed the freshly acquired five-million-dollar check between his fingers, his wariness toward Evelyn completely dissipating. When she offered to write the ransom note, he grinned widely. "Smart move. But don't try anything funny. If you pull any tricks, we’ll follow Miss Lightfoot’s orders without hesitation."

Evelyn suppressed her pounding heart, keeping her voice steady. "With all of you watching me, what could I possibly do?"

"That’s more like it." The leader grabbed a pen but suddenly set it down again.

"What’s wrong?" Evelyn asked.

He scratched his head. "Can’t the cops analyze handwriting? What if they trace it back to me?"

Evelyn seized the opportunity. "Then let me write it. The Hamiltons recognize my handwriting."

The leader’s eyes lit up—this would save them the trouble of proving the hostage’s identity. He shoved the paper and pen at her roughly, his gaze locked onto her hand as she gripped the pen.

Her fingers trembled slightly. She glanced around, seeing nothing but peeling paint on the walls. This ransom note was her only hope.

The pen moved swiftly across the paper, filling the page in no time. After inspecting it, the leader handed it to a subordinate for delivery.

Two hours later.

Natalie rushed in with a lab report. "Mr. Hamilton, we’ve identified the substance on the button—industrial machine oil mixed with metal shavings."

Alexander Hamilton stared at the report. "Any leads on the source?"

"Preliminary analysis suggests a metalworking factory or scrap yard." Natalie wiped her brow. "The scope is too broad. We need more time to narrow it down."

"Keep digging. The faster, the better." His voice was hoarse.

The family doctor handed him a glass of water. "Mr. Hamilton, the sedative has taken effect, but the wound on your hand needs stitches."

Alexander rolled up his bloodstained sleeve. "Do it now."

"Without anesthesia—"

"Stitch it."

The doctor’s hands shook as he threaded the needle. With each stitch, Alexander’s muscles tensed, his shirt soaked with sweat.

Natalie burst in again. "Mr. Hamilton! A new ransom note arrived—it’s Mrs. Hamilton’s handwriting!"

Alexander snatched the letter, scanning every word like a hawk. Suddenly, his pupils constricted.

"Alert everyone. Focus the search on the abandoned industrial park in the East District."

Natalie froze. "The East District? But we’ve flagged dozens of suspicious locations—"

"No time to explain." Alexander carefully folded the letter. "The children’s safety comes first. I’ll head to the East District myself."

He knew Evelyn’s writing habits too well. Trained in medical academia, she was meticulous with punctuation—yet this note’s punctuation was erratic. Especially the odd ink blot after the word "East," unmistakably deliberate.

Inside the industrial park, Alexander and his team split up to search. Machine oil, metal shavings, the East District—all clues pointed to the warehouse storing old equipment.

"Mr. Hamilton, you don’t look well," a bodyguard said worriedly.

Alexander ignored him, wrenching open another warehouse door with a crowbar. The screech of metal echoed through the empty complex.

At the same time, frantic footsteps sounded from the warehouse’s second floor.

"Boss! Someone’s breaking in!" A lookout stumbled into the room in panic.
###Chapter 717: I'm Here to Take You Home

Evelyn's fingers dug into the armrests of the chair, her knuckles turning white from the force. It was the only thing she could hold onto.

Footsteps grew louder.

She held her breath, ready to make noise to call for help.

The gang leader's expression darkened as he grabbed his underling by the collar. "Take her! Move!"

Evelyn suddenly stood and swung the chair with all her strength, smashing it into the leader's back.

Bang!

Caught off guard, the leader crashed to the ground.

Evelyn turned and bolted for the stairs.

The second floor had an emergency exit.

The thugs scrambled—some helping their leader up, others chasing after Evelyn.

Crash!

The warehouse doors were kicked open.

Sunlight pierced the darkness like a blade.

Alexander stood in the doorway, his shirt stained with blood, the bandages on his right hand soaked crimson.

Evelyn froze on the stairs, locking eyes with him.

"It's Alexander Hamilton!" the leader snarled in recognition. "Don't let him leave alive!"

The gangsters grabbed their weapons and closed in.

Alexander looked up at Evelyn, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly. "I'm here to take you home."

His voice was soft, but it made her eyes burn.

"Are you insane?" Her voice trembled. "You came here alone to die?"

Alexander didn't answer, only swept a cold gaze over the thugs. "Leave now, and you might live."

Evelyn understood his silent message.

She quietly stepped back, then seized the chaos to dash upstairs.

The sunlight outside was blinding.

Evelyn stumbled as she ran, her throat raw with pain.

"Help! Alexander is inside—"

Footsteps echoed from around the corner.

Evelyn looked up, her pupils shrinking.

Lydia stood there in a black dress, lips blood-red, flanked by four hulking bodyguards.

"Evelyn," she cooed sweetly, "where are you rushing off to?"

Evelyn took half a step back. "Lydia, what do you want?"

"I want to play a game." Lydia tilted her head. "Who do you think Alexander will choose?"

She clapped her hands, and the bodyguards immediately seized Evelyn.

"Let me go!" Evelyn struggled. "You don’t understand love at all!"

Lydia's smile vanished. "Shut up!" She gripped Evelyn's chin. "If it weren’t for you, I would’ve married Alexander by now!"

Evelyn met her gaze. "You could never have his child."

The words stabbed Lydia like a knife.

She raised her hand to strike but stopped midair.

"Trying to provoke me?" Lydia sneered. "You think I'm as stupid as Annabelle?"

Leaning in, she whispered in Evelyn's ear, "Today, I’ll make Alexander watch you die."

Police sirens wailed in the distance.

Lydia's face twisted. "Take her away!"
###Chapter 718: Evelyn Carter Is the One I Love

News of Annabelle Taylor's disappearance had spread throughout the entire social circle.

Evelyn Carter forced herself to remain composed, but when Lydia Laurent didn't take the bait, she felt a cold sweat trickle down her spine. The plan had failed.

The bodyguards roughly shoved her toward the warehouse.

"What about the children?" Evelyn suddenly raised her voice. "That youngest girl is the Langley family's treasured jewel. If anything happens to her, the Langleys will tear the city apart to find you!"

She knew the odds were against her, but at the very least, she needed to confirm the children's safety.

At the mention of "the Langley family," a flicker of regret flashed in Lydia's eyes. She had indeed underestimated the little girl's value.

Evelyn read the answer in her expression. "They're already safe, aren't they?"

Lydia didn't respond, simply turning toward the warehouse with a chilling aura.

Evelyn tried to warn Alexander Hamilton, but her mouth was gagged. She noticed Lydia seemed to have changed her mind—she no longer intended to follow through with the original plan of drowning her at sea.

Inside the warehouse, Alexander was locked in combat with a group of thugs. After confirming Evelyn's escape, his strikes grew even more ruthless, quickly taking down two of them.

Seeing the tide turn against him, the leader abandoned his comrades and fled in panic. The others scattered like frightened birds.

Just as Alexander moved to find Evelyn, Lydia blocked his path at the entrance. Beneath her sweet smile lay twisted hatred.

"Alexander, that hit you gave me really hurt," she complained in a childish whine.

Alexander smirked coldly. "If I'd known you'd be this troublesome, I would've hit you harder."

Lydia tilted her head like an innocent doll. "I brought the person you most wanted to see."

The bodyguard shoved Evelyn forward. The rough handling of her injured right arm sent waves of pain through her, beads of cold sweat forming on her forehead.

"What do you want?" Alexander's voice was tight.

Evelyn tried to shake her head to signal she was fine, but her pale face betrayed her.

The last glimmer of light vanished from Lydia's eyes. "Do you love her that much?" Her voice turned shrill. "Have you forgotten how you abandoned her for Annabelle?"

Evelyn let out a pained whimper.

Alexander's voice was resolute. "Everything in the past was against my will. But now, Evelyn Carter is the one I love. Stop this, Lydia."

The word "love" sent a shock through Evelyn's heart.

"You're lying!" Lydia screamed hysterically. "I'm cuter than her, I understand you better, I know how to make you happier!"

Alexander scoffed. "Even my pet dog is cuter than you."

Suddenly, Lydia smiled eerily. The shadows in the warehouse seemed to come alive.

Evelyn felt a chill—the same premonition she'd had before the car accident.

Alexander gave her a deep look, his gaze tender yet resolute, before turning back to Lydia with icy detachment. "Don't make this worse."

"Are you going to call the police on me, Alexander?" Lydia tilted her head. "That's fine. Daddy will be home soon."

Evelyn's pupils constricted. Leonard Laurent had been taken away by the police—where was Lydia getting this confidence?

Alexander studied her. "I underestimated you."

Lydia's voice dripped with saccharine sweetness. "I'll give you one last chance. You say you love Evelyn. If she were in danger, would you save her?"

"Of course."

"What if only one of you could live?"

Evelyn shuddered. "Lydia!"

"Scared, Evelyn?" Lydia giggled. "Don't you want to know the answer too?"

Without hesitation, Alexander replied, "I choose her."
###Chapter 719: One of Us Must Live

Evelyn's pupils constricted violently.

She stared at Lydia's innocent smiling face, a chill creeping up her spine.

"Touched?" Lydia tilted her head, tapping her chin with a finger. "But words are cheap. I need proof."

Bodyguards dragged Evelyn deeper into the warehouse, chains clanking.

Alexander lunged forward. "Stop!"

"Alex," Lydia sang, blocking his path. "One more step, and I can't guarantee Evelyn's neck won't snap."

She mimed a twisting motion, madness glinting in her eyes.

Alexander froze mid-step, his knuckles white, blood dripping from his clenched fists.

"Does it hurt?" Lydia leaned in curiously.

He recoiled from her outstretched hand.

Silence stretched.

The chains bit into Evelyn's skin, her breathing growing labored. When the gag was finally ripped away, she coughed violently.

Alexander's glare could have flayed Lydia alive.

"How cruel," Lydia pouted. "You never looked at Annabelle like that. Speaking of, how's she doing at the orphanage?"

She turned abruptly to Evelyn. "I heard you lost your memory after nearly drowning as a child?"

Alexander's voice was raw. "What do you want?"

"Simple." Lydia clapped her hands. "Evelyn fears water, so I'll give her fire instead."

She stepped back gracefully, flicking a lighter in an arc.

WHOOSH.

Flames engulfed the stacked oil barrels.

Alexander stood three paces from the exit.

He turned and ran into the inferno.

"Go!" Evelyn screamed. "One of us must live!"

Lydia watched the blaze from the doorway. "Human nature is selfish. No one defies instinct..."

Black smoke billowed out.

Bodyguards covered their mouths, exchanging glances.

The warehouse doorframe collapsed.

"Alex," Lydia murmured. "No regrets?"

His retreating back was her only answer.

"Boring." She shrugged. "Let's go."

Amid the flames, Alexander finally broke the last chain.

They staggered toward the stairs.

Evelyn coughed, eyes streaming. "Never thought I'd die with you."

Alexander gave a bitter smile. "Regrets?"

"The children are safe." She watched the approaching fire. "But Mom and Emily..."

"Listen." He gripped her hand urgently. "If we make it, take Grace to the estate. Mom misses you all."

"How?"

Instead of answering, he spoke rapidly. "You have the seal, right? There's a document in the bank vault—"

His gaze locked onto a ventilation shaft above, resolve hardening.
###Chapter 720: I'll Never Forgive You

His voice grew softer, almost whispering to himself: "Attorney Han from Legal Affairs will handle everything..."

Evelyn abruptly cut him off. "Stop! I don't know any Attorney Han, nor your safe combination. The fire trucks are coming—you deal with it yourself..."

Her gaze drifted into the distance as her heart sank.

A blaze this intense should've alarmed the neighborhood by now. Yet Alexander's security team was nowhere to be seen—likely overpowered.

Though Lydia only brought a few bodyguards, each was elite. Picking them off one by one would've been effortless.

Alexander suddenly grasped her hand. "The fire's rising from below. We need the roof."

He looked up at the overhanging eaves.

Evelyn followed his gaze. The emergency exit remained frustratingly distant.

"I'll boost you up first." Alexander crouched, offering his shoulders as a stepping stool.

She knew this wasn't the time for hesitation. Once atop the ledge, she immediately reached down. "Hurry! Grab my hand!"

Alexander didn't move.

"Evelyn." He spoke her full name softly, voice ragged. "Keep climbing. Higher means safer."

Her outstretched hand froze midair.

The realization struck—he never intended to follow.

"I can reach you!" Her voice trembled. "Try again—"

He shook his head, arms limp at his sides. Only when her tears fell did he murmur, "My hands are injured. The flames...if we don't separate, we both die."

Even now, he prioritized her survival.

"You promised never to leave me!" Evelyn glared, voice raw. "If you die here, I'll never forgive you! Not in this lifetime!"

Fire licked at the exterior walls.

Wooden stairs groaned under the assault. Yet Alexander remained eerily calm, as if resigned to fate.

"My will divides assets between you and Mother. If possible...please look after her."

"Evelyn, I'm sorry..."

She strained to grasp him, but her vision blurred. Inhaled smoke took its toll.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

......

Evelyn's eyes flew open.

The acrid sting of disinfectant. Harsh white lights made her squint.

"Where's Alexander?" Her voice scraped like sandpaper.

Grace and Margaret snapped to attention beside the hospital bed. Grace wept with relief. "Sweetheart!"

Margaret's lips parted, but tears spoke first.

Evelyn's heart plummeted.

"Is he...?" The words lodged in her throat.

That dream felt too real. Like a final goodbye.

She yanked out her IV, staggering upright. Both mothers rushed to restrain her, their tearful eyes confirming the worst.

"I need to see him." Her voice shook.

Deeper than the despair she'd felt waiting by the pond for divers—this time, he'd sacrificed himself for her...

Margaret forced steadiness. "Search and rescue is ongoing...they brought you here first after you lost consciousness."

Evelyn's grip turned the sheets bone-white.

That dream—was it a hallucination...or had he truly come to say farewell?
###Chapter 721: He Truly Came to Say Goodbye

Evelyn Carter lay on the hospital bed, her face as pale as parchment.

She struggled to prop herself up, her fingers clutching the sheets so tightly her knuckles turned white.

"Alexander—" Margaret Hamilton began, but Evelyn's vision suddenly darkened. She pitched forward.

"Careful!" Grace Anderson and Margaret both lunged to catch her.

Margaret's hands trembled. "The firefighters said the entire industrial park was destroyed. They searched for hours before—"

Her voice broke. She couldn't continue.

Grace wiped her tears and rushed out of the room.

The attending physician arrived shortly. Seeing Evelyn awake, he exhaled in relief. "Dr. Carter, you've been unconscious for nearly 24 hours. There's still inflammation in your lungs. You need further observation."

"I'm discharging myself." Her voice was hoarse.

The doctor frowned. "That's against protocol—"

"There's something I must do. Immediately." Her gaze was terrifyingly resolute.

The doctor finally relented, prescribing a stack of medications.

In the car ride back, Margaret held Evelyn's icy hand. "Natalie brought the children home safely. But the baby wouldn't stop crying—"

"The others?" Evelyn stared at the blurring scenery outside.

"The bodyguards are hospitalized. Emily is handling the aftermath." Margaret hesitated. "The police said...they found nothing at the scene—"

Evelyn's fists clenched.

Her nails dug into her palms, yet she felt no pain.

At the police station, the lead detective offered her a cup of warm water.

"The warehouse was stocked with chemicals. The fire spread too quickly..." The officer flipped through his notes. "We've issued warrants for those thugs."

"Was there..." Evelyn's throat tightened. "Any sign of him?"

"Don't worry. The industrial park had been abandoned for years. No casualties."

This should have been good news.

Yet Evelyn's heart sank like a stone.

No casualties meant Alexander Hamilton had vanished into thin air.

"What about Lydia?" She suddenly grabbed the officer's sleeve. "She must have taken Alexander!"

The officer shook his head helplessly. "The Laurent case isn't under our jurisdiction. Currently...there's no trace of her."

As Evelyn stepped out of the station, the setting sun stretched her shadow long across the ground.

She looked up at the sky, abruptly remembering that dream.

In it, Alexander had gazed at her with heartbreaking tenderness when he said "goodbye."

For seven days since, he hadn't appeared in her dreams again.

As if...that truly was their final farewell.
###Chapter 722: Wanting to Do Something for You

Evelyn Carter jolted awake from a nightmare.

The night outside the window was pitch black. She gasped for air, her pajamas soaked with cold sweat.

Her phone screen lit up, the harsh light making her squint. No missed calls. The police still had no leads.

Only a work reminder from Emily Zade about needing Alexander Hamilton's personal seal.

Her fingers tightened around the phone, knuckles turning white.

This night would be endless.

At dawn, Anthony Taylor and Teresa Taylor arrived in a hurry.

"Terry..." Anthony hesitated, his eyes filled with heartache.

Evelyn was crouched by the baby crib, gently shaking a rattle. At the sound of his voice, her fingers trembled slightly before she forced a smile. "Dad. Mom."

Teresa grasped her icy hand. "Don't worry too much. Alexander will—"

"I know." Evelyn cut her off softly but firmly. "He'll come back."

She could feel Alexander was out there somewhere, just temporarily lost on his way home.

"Maybe..." Anthony chose his words carefully, "you should return to the OB-GYN Department? It might help distract you."

Evelyn shook her head. "Hamilton Group needs someone to hold the fort."

"But you alone—"

"He taught me." A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips, her eyes glistening. "Never thought I'd end up using those lessons for his own company."

A soft cough came from upstairs.

Margaret Hamilton had been struggling with insomnia lately. Evelyn knew. Auntie Wu mentioned she needed medication to sleep every night.

"Aunt Margaret isn't well. I need to take care of her for Alexander." Evelyn's voice was quiet.

Anthony and Teresa exchanged a glance and didn't press further.

Before leaving, Teresa suddenly held her back. "Is there anything we can do to help?"

Evelyn paused in thought, then called Lily and Lotus Waters over.

"Help them find a school." Her voice was hoarse. "Alexander promised them that."

Teresa's eyes reddened as she looked at Lily's young face. This child was the same age Evelyn had been when she left home.

"Don't worry. We'll handle it."

After seeing her parents off, Emily Zade called.

"Mrs. Hamilton, the project team is causing trouble!"

Shouting and chaos came through the phone.

Evelyn gripped her phone. "The seal and laptop are with me. They can't do anything."

"But this time they brought people—"

"I'm on my way." Evelyn grabbed her coat, her gaze landing on the desk drawer.

Locked inside were Alexander's personal belongings.

Including the seal he never went anywhere without.
###Chapter 723: The Three-Year-Old Suicide Note

Flames devoured everything around them. Alexander Hamilton gripped Evelyn Carter's hand in the inferno, his voice hoarse but firm. "The bank safe deposit box code is 1128. Attorney Grant from Legal holds the important documents..."

Evelyn stood in the bank's VIP room, her fingertips trembling slightly.

The manager respectfully slid a stack of documents toward her. "Ms. Carter, these are the equity transfer agreements personally signed by Mr. Hamilton. Once you sign, 50% of Hamilton Group shares will be yours."

She stared at the familiar signature on the papers, her chest tightening.

1128—their wedding date.

"I need time to consider." Evelyn pushed the documents back. "Please continue safeguarding them."

Sunlight stung her eyes as she exited the bank. Alexander had just handed her half his empire.

The Hamilton Group headquarters buzzed with activity, but tension hung thick in the air. Employees scurried with heads down, glued to their phones.

"Mrs. Hamilton." The receptionist hurried over. "Emily Zade is waiting for you."

The private elevator ascended directly to the top floor. Instead of heading to the office, Evelyn detoured to Legal.

Attorney Grant was organizing files when he spotted her, visibly startled. "You've come."

This unremarkable middle-aged man was Alexander's most trusted legal advisor.

"Mr. Hamilton instructed," Grant said, retrieving a kraft envelope from the safe, "that if you ever came looking for me, I should give you this."

The words "Suicide Note" glared from the envelope.

"When?" Evelyn's voice strained.

"Three years ago." Grant adjusted his glasses. "He said if he remained safe, this document would stay sealed forever."

Three years—shortly after their wedding.

Emily Zade rushed in. "I knew you'd be here, Mrs. Hamilton. The board demands—"

"Not yet." Evelyn cut her off, tearing open the envelope.

The will's thoroughness chilled her—real estate, stocks, funds, even charity projects established in her name. Alexander had planned out her entire future.

"How thoughtful of him." Evelyn gave a bitter smile, tracing his signature at the document's end.

Two more letters lay inside. One bore a wax seal marked "For Evelyn's Eyes Only." The other appointed her interim CEO.

Bang!

The office door shuddered under violent knocking.

"Mrs. Hamilton!" A project director shouted outside. "The board insists on an emergency meeting immediately!"

Emily paled. "They're making their move."

Evelyn stuffed the suicide note into her bag and drew a deep breath. "Let's go greet them."

The wax-sealed letter burned in her palm. What had Alexander been thinking that rainy night three years ago?
###Chapter 724: Making an Example

The office door rattled under heavy blows, accompanied by the metallic clang of something striking its surface.

Evelyn set down her fountain pen, fingertips brushing over Alexander's handwritten authorization letter. The paper still carried his signature ink scent, each stroke pressed deep into the fibers.

"Dr. Carter, don't go out there!" Emily Zade's forehead gleamed with sweat. "They're here to make trouble."

Evelyn folded the document neatly and tucked it inside her blazer. She'd deliberately worn the charcoal gray suit Alexander gifted her, even pinning her hair into a flawless chignon.

As the lock gave way, the man brandishing a fire axe froze mid-swing under her arctic glare.

"Mr. Feng." Her voice could frost glass. "Hamilton Group's emergency equipment is for saving lives, not circus performances."

The project manager paled, shrinking behind his entourage of burly security guards now holding their breath.

"Mrs. Hamilton, we're just concerned about Mr. Hamilton's safety—"

"Concerned enough to break down doors?" Her heels clicked like ice cubes on marble. "Or perhaps more concerned about those untraceable kickbacks?"

Emily gasped. Attorney Grant immediately began recording.

Feng's Adam's apple bobbed violently. "That's slander! I'll file a complaint with the board!"

"Unnecessary." Evelyn extracted a file from her briefcase. "These are your financial transactions with Laurent Group. Three days after Alexander disappeared, you wired eight million offshore—need I remind you this constitutes embezzlement?"

The hallway plunged into tomb silence.

Feng's face turned ashen. He lunged for the documents, but Evelyn sidestepped smoothly. A private seal clattered to the floor.

The Hamilton crest gleamed coldly under fluorescent lights.

"Two choices." She retrieved the seal. "Take your severance and vanish, or I invite the Economic Crime Division for tea."

Muffled gasps erupted. Several board-appointed observers retreated toward the elevators.

By afternoon, Hamilton's intranet exploded.

[SHOCKER! CEO's wife wields authority, Feng escorted out immediately]
[Finance Dept purge: 3 accounts frozen]
[Insider: Mr. Hamilton left contingency—seal & authorization with Dr. Carter]

Evelyn stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching sunset bleed across the skyline. Baby Chloe babbled in the nursery where Lily Waters sang newly learned lullabies.

"Dr. Carter, Directors Wang and Zhao demand an emergency board meeting." Emily entered with a tablet. "The group chat says—"

"That this outsider isn't fit as interim CEO?" Evelyn's fingertip traced the scrolling messages. "Tell them I expect every director in the conference room by 10 AM tomorrow."

Midnight found Evelyn pacing the bedroom with a wailing infant. The tiny fists clutched her collar between hiccuping sobs.

"If Alexander were here..." Her gaze drifted sideways to the empty bed where only an unfinished financial report lay.

In the bedside frame, Alexander cradled their daughter with heartbreaking tenderness—their last photo after returning from the island retreat.

Dusting the frame, she discovered a note tucked behind. Familiar handwriting pressed deep into the paper:

"If I'm ever gone, remember our promise."

A teardrop smudged the ink. The baby suddenly quieted, pressing a soft palm to her damp cheek.
###Chapter 725: Tides of Longing

The boardroom was filled with old foxes—every single one of them troublemakers Alexander Hamilton had personally dealt with during his tenure. Now that he was absent, they couldn’t resist crawling out of the woodwork.

Evelyn Carter stepped into the meeting room in her stilettos, her fingertips slightly chilled. She’d arrived half an hour early, yet the weight of their scrutinizing gazes pressed down on her like a suffocating fog.

"Mrs. Hamilton, are you certain about terminating the partnership with the Laurent Group?" someone asked with thinly veiled sarcasm.

She ran her fingers over the fountain pen, mimicking Alexander’s signature tone. "Do you have an objection?"

The room fell dead silent.

Emily Zade, ever the perfect assistant, slid the documents forward. The resolution to sever ties barely passed. But then, unable to contain themselves, someone blurted out, "Where exactly is Mr. Hamilton? The rumors are—"

"Business trip," Evelyn cut in coldly. "Spread another word, and you’ll deal with the consequences."

She narrowed her eyes just as Alexander would—a move that instantly silenced the old vultures.

Back in the CEO’s office, Evelyn collapsed into the leather chair. Emily hovered anxiously. "They won’t let this go, Mrs. Hamilton."

"I know." Rubbing her temples, she forced herself to focus on the files.

By the time the city lights flickered to life outside, she realized she’d missed dinner. The words slipped out before she could stop them: "Alexander, what about this—"

The empty office gave no reply.

She stared at the vacant chair across from her. A month ago, she’d complained about his constant presence. Now she was talking to thin air.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Ms. Carter, the search is over." The detective’s voice was heavy. "No trace of Mr. Hamilton was found."

Her grip tightened on the phone. "Chances of survival?"

A pause. "Theoretically—"

"I understand." She cut him off. "Keep this confidential."

Hanging up, Evelyn fixated on the framed photo on the desk—Alexander’s arm around her waist, grinning like a child who’d stolen candy.

Now the jar had shattered.

At the Hamilton estate, Baby Chloe babbled over her blocks. Margaret Hamilton asked gently, "How was today?"

"Fine." Evelyn smiled as she took the child, but her eyes reddened the moment she looked down.

Lily Waters tiptoed closer. "Dr. Carter, you miss Alexander, don’t you?"

The block slipped from Evelyn’s fingers. She scrambled to pick it up, but tears hit the floor first.

"I—" Her voice cracked. Pressing her palms to her face, she whispered, "Yes. I miss him."

This was what longing felt like—an overwhelming tide with no shore in sight.
###Chapter 726: Days Without Him

Evelyn Carter's premonition had finally come true.

On the fifteenth day of Alexander Hamilton's disappearance, the quarterly shareholders' meeting of Hamilton Group commenced. The conference room was packed, more crowded than any previous gathering.

With Alexander still absent, the shareholders' ambitions began to stir once more.

Evelyn had been on edge all this time, but now, she felt an odd sense of relief.

What was meant to happen would happen. Once she weathered this storm, the hardest part would be over.

The meeting began with department heads delivering their reports one by one. The last to stand was Manager Xiao from the business division.

"Mrs. Hamilton, now that the Banyan Group project has been terminated, how should we allocate the funds? Do you have the authority to decide?"

He deliberately emphasized "Mrs. Hamilton" instead of her current title, making his condescension unmistakable.

Emily Zade, standing at the conference table, shot her a worried glance. As the moderator, she couldn't appear too biased.

Evelyn gave a slight nod to reassure her, long accustomed to such provocations. "Do you have a suggestion, Manager Xiao?"

"Leaving funds idle is never wise," he said pointedly. "I heard you were once an executive at Anderson Environmental and the only daughter of the Anderson family. Surely you wouldn’t—"

"Are you implying I'd embezzle company funds?" Evelyn chuckled. "My background is in medicine. I know nothing about financial operations."

"Just because you wouldn’t doesn’t mean others wouldn’t." He shifted tactics. "Hamilton Group isn’t your personal property. Even when Mr. Hamilton was here, major decisions required board approval."

He conveniently ignored Alexander’s decisive leadership style.

Though unfamiliar with Hamilton Group’s internal workings, Evelyn understood how Alexander operated.

"Since you brought up Mr. Hamilton, perhaps we should review the meeting minutes to ensure no one misrepresents his intentions."

Manager Xiao paled and quickly backtracked. "We’re discussing the project now. Digging up the past is pointless."

His gaze flickered toward a certain director, who immediately looked away.

Evelyn silently thanked her stars that this particular troublemaker wasn’t very bright.

"I know exactly what you’re all thinking," she said, scanning the room. "Everyone here holds shares. If the company suffers, I won’t be the one losing the most."

Hamilton Group operated on a partnership model—executives’ wealth was tied to stock performance.

Emily discreetly signaled Alexander’s allies.

Tension thickened in the conference room.

An elderly director slammed the table. "Mrs. Hamilton, you unilaterally halted payments, and now we’re facing massive penalties!"

The CFO chimed in, "We understand your issues with Ms. Lightfoot, but personal grudges shouldn’t interfere with business."

They carefully avoided the topic of Alexander’s whereabouts.

"So you’re saying I cut ties with Lightfoot Holdings out of jealousy?" Evelyn cut straight to the point.

The director remained unflinching. "Your words, not mine. Mr. Hamilton only entrusted you with temporary management, not to replace him."

"My decision stands," Evelyn said firmly. "Leonard Laurent is still in custody, and Lightfoot Holdings remains under investigation."

Seeing this approach fail, the directors switched tactics.

"Mrs. Hamilton, business involves gains and losses. Shouldn’t the board vote on where these funds are allocated?"

The director plastered on a smile, attempting to coax her.

Evelyn smirked. "I said no one touches it. That’s final."
###Chapter 727 Could It Really Be Him...

The air in the boardroom seemed to freeze for an instant.

A director slammed the table and stood abruptly. "Even Alexander Hamilton never dared speak to me like this! Who do you think you are? Don't forget you're already divorced!"

Evelyn Carter's fingers tapped lightly on the conference table, her voice measured. "The divorce doesn't invalidate this document."

She slid the file bearing Alexander's seal across the table, the paper whispering against the polished surface.

The director's face darkened as he turned to rally other shareholders. "Everyone here is a company veteran. We won't tolerate interference from an outsider!"

Evelyn's gaze swept the room. She remembered Alexander's words clearly—one-third loyalists, one-third fence-sitters, and one-third with hidden agendas.

Now she needed to win over those wavering votes.

"If we're voting," she suddenly raised her voice, "why not do it right now with a show of hands?"

The room erupted.

"This is too rash!"
"Open voting is inappropriate..."
"We need advance notice at least..."

Watching their panicked expressions, Evelyn suddenly understood why Alexander always kept people at arm's length. Dealing with these old foxes daily would make anyone paranoid.

If only he were here...

Just then, the boardroom door creaked open.

The heated discussions ceased instantly.

Evelyn, facing away from the entrance, only turned when she sensed the abrupt silence—

Alexander stood there.

She blinked, wondering if it was another hallucination. Lately, she kept seeing glimpses of him everywhere.

Until the chair beside her scraped back, and that familiar cologne enveloped her.

"Mr. Hamilton!" Emily Zade's voice trembled with emotion.

Alexander gave a slight nod. "Continue the meeting."

Three simple words that transformed the room's atmosphere. The previously hesitant shareholders immediately straightened their postures.

"Business trips do take time," Alexander adjusted his cufflinks leisurely. "I hadn't realized the company would be so... lively in my absence."

His gaze traveled across each face before settling on the instigating director. "Director Zheng, I heard you wanted a vote? On what matter?"

Beads of sweat formed on Zheng's forehead. "N-nothing important..."

Alexander chuckled softly, then turned to Evelyn. "You explain."

Evelyn froze.

She could feel his hand trembling slightly where it held hers. Though impeccably dressed in his suit, closer inspection revealed the dark circles under his eyes and unnaturally pale lips.

"I..."
"Hmm?" Alexander's eyes encouraged her.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn outlined her proposal with perfect clarity. This time, no one dared interrupt.

When the meeting adjourned, shareholders practically fled the room.

Emily discreetly closed the door behind them.

Evelyn mechanically gathered documents, flinching when her fingers accidentally brushed Alexander's hand.

"You..."

Alexander suddenly grasped her wrist. "I'm sorry for worrying you."

Evelyn's tears finally overflowed. "Just how..."

Her voice broke, the words dissolving into silent sobs.
###Chapter 728: Were You Worried About Me?

Alexander Hamilton braced against the desk, but his legs remained rooted like ancient oaks.

He forced a smile. "Let's talk in my office. This isn't the place."

Evelyn Carter swallowed her turbulent emotions, silently supporting him to his office.

The moment the door clicked shut, her restraint shattered. "Where have you been these days? Not a single message! Margaret was frantic with worry!"

His gaze burned into her. "And you?"

"What about me?"

"Were you worried?"

She turned her face away. "How bad are your injuries?"

A low chuckle escaped him. "So you were worried."

His fingers twitched toward her, then recoiled before touching her sleeve. Those once-elegant hands now bore a tapestry of scars, his palms rough with fresh calluses.

"You've lost weight." His voice tightened.

Evelyn's already slender frame had become almost translucent, her delicate face dominated by luminous eyes.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I tried to shield you that day, but the staircase collapsed—"

At the moment Evelyn lost consciousness, he'd reached his limit. As flames licked toward them, he'd spotted Lydia Laurent's bodyguards.

They weren't there to rescue anyone.

Alexander had leapt at the critical moment. Despite perfect timing, his old ankle injury exploded with white-hot agony.

He'd deliberately drawn the pursuers away, tossing his coat into the inferno as a decoy. Only after confirming Evelyn's safe ambulance departure did he vanish into the shadows, dragging his wounded leg.

"So you hid while injured?" Her voice trembled. "Do you realize how reckless that was?"

A bitter smile twisted his lips. "First time in thirty years someone forced me underground. Easier to dodge bullets when you become the ghost."

He staggered suddenly.

Evelyn caught him. "Sit down!"

Beads of sweat traced his jawline. Days of endurance had worsened his condition.

"Hospital. Now." Her tone brooked no argument. "Is your business finished?"

He exhaled raggedly. "All evidence against the Laurents is with the police. Cross-jurisdictional cases take time, but they won't escape."

She knelt to examine his leg.

Alexander yanked his pant leg down. "I'll call the family physician."

"I am a doctor."

"...You're OB-GYN."

"Alexander." She met his gaze squarely. "What are you afraid of?"

His breath hitched.

"Nothing."

"Then stop being difficult." She reached again.

His hand clamped around her wrist. "Don't look."

"Why?"

"...It's ugly."

Her fingertips brushed a concave scar.

Her heart clenched.

"I'm a physician." Her voice softened. "No wound is uglier than a stubborn patient's pride."
###Chapter 729: Things Will Get Better

Evelyn withdrew her hand, no longer insisting on examining his injuries.

Alexander turned his head away, his Adam's apple bobbing. "I suppose I've long lost any dignity in your eyes."

He touched the bruise on his chin, his lips curling into a self-deprecating smile.

This was perhaps the most disheveled he'd been in his thirty years.

"Your leg is badly injured," Evelyn said softly. "It might be a bone issue."

Alexander stiffened.

Not just fractured—misaligned. No wonder every step felt like walking on knives.

"You need to go to the hospital," Evelyn stood. "I'm not an orthopedic specialist, and a family doctor can't handle this. Plus, you're still running a fever. You need IV antibiotics."

"Give me a moment," he rasped. "I haven't slept since yesterday."

Evelyn took in the dark circles under his eyes and turned to pour him a glass of water.

Alexander drained it in one go.

She refilled it. "Where have you been all this time? We searched all of Hudson City. We even thought—" She paused. "Margaret and Andrew were frantic."

"I went somewhere," Alexander's voice was hoarse. "Somewhere Lydia might circle back to."

Evelyn's pupils constricted. "The mountains?"

No wonder the police found no leads. Everyone assumed he'd perished in the fire. Who would've guessed he'd trekked to that remote village?

"It was urgent. I couldn't notify anyone," Alexander massaged his temples. "Once I reached the village, I couldn't risk leaks. Lydia is more dangerous than her father. She has mercenaries on her payroll."

"The villagers—are they alright?"

"All safe." A faint smile touched his lips. "Elder Thompson and the nurses sent their regards. If not for the construction crew and medical team covering for me, I'd have been exposed. And that volunteer teacher—"

His words trailed off as his eyelids grew too heavy to lift.

Evelyn didn't press further, gently steadying his swaying frame.

There would be time for answers later.

Alexander leaned into her embrace, his breathing gradually evening out. It was the first proper sleep he'd had in half a month.

Evelyn studied his gaunt profile, feeling as though lifetimes had passed.

"Mr. Hamilton—" Emily pushed the door open and immediately fell silent at the sight.

Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips, gesturing to the sleeping Alexander.

Emily nodded, silently mouthing her report before tiptoeing in with a blanket. Watching Alexander's peaceful expression, she mouthed to Evelyn: "The last time he looked this relaxed was when he stayed with you at the hospital."

Now the roles were reversed.

Evelyn lightly touched his feverish forehead. As she moved to fetch medicine, his fingers weakly clutched her sleeve.

"Don't go..."

She sat back down, signaling to Emily: "Tell Margaret we'll go to the hospital when he wakes."

By dusk, Alexander finally stirred.

Evelyn was bent over, examining his leg.

"Awake?"

"Mmm." His voice was still thick with sleep. "My leg..."

"The fracture wasn't treated in time. The bones are misaligned." She rolled down his pant leg. "You'll need surgery to reset the pins."

"Wheelchair?"

"Your left leg has a stress fracture too," Evelyn said firmly. "Unless you want a permanent limp."

"..."

In the hospital corridor, the orthopedic chief shook his head at the scans.

"The burns were treated promptly, but the fracture is severely displaced. Absolute bed rest—no weight-bearing at all..."

Evelyn took careful notes while Alexander kept his gaze fixed on her profile.

An ancient saying claimed that a day apart felt like three years. These past weeks had stretched longer than a lifetime.

As for the injuries...they would heal.

As long as she was here.
###Chapter 730 Homecoming Warmth

Evelyn pushed the brand-new wheelchair into the hospital room, finding Alexander staring blankly out the window.

"The doctor said you need at least another week of hospitalization." She parked the wheelchair beside the bed, her tone calm.

Alexander withdrew his gaze, fingertips lightly tapping the edge of the mattress. "I want to go home."

Evelyn frowned. "You require daily IV drips and wound dressings."

"You'll help me." His voice held unwavering certainty.

She sighed. "Baby Chloe has been extra clingy lately, and work at the company is piling up. I've been running nonstop for three days—my hands shake so badly I can't even hold a coffee cup steady."

Amusement flickered in Alexander's eyes. "It's fine."

"I might miss the vein."

"I trust you."

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before turning to fetch the attending physician. Half an hour later, she returned with discharge papers. "The doctor agreed, but you must adhere to daily wound care."

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted. "Understood."

When Margaret Hamilton saw her son, her prayer beads clattered to the floor. Trembling, she rushed forward and crushed him in a tearful embrace, dampening his collar.

"Mom, I'm alright." Alexander gently patted her back.

Grace Anderson wiped her eyes while Lily and Lotus peeked from behind the door. The long-silent living room of the ancestral home buzzed with life again, the very air turning warmer.

After dinner, Evelyn administered Alexander's IV in the makeshift hospital room. Her movements were practiced—the needle found its mark effortlessly, the medical tape applied with precision.

"Skills haven't rusted." Alexander watched her focused profile.

Evelyn disposed of the medical waste. "You've had a fever for days. Didn't you notice? A hospital stay would've meant one IV catheter. Now you'll need a fresh needle daily."

Alexander held her gaze. "Will you visit me at the hospital?"

"I will." She answered honestly.

The baby in the crib suddenly cooed and reached out. Alexander brushed her cheek with his free hand, eliciting giggles.

"She'll be crawling soon." Evelyn pulled up a phone video. "I recorded this to send to Miss Langley, but all her social media accounts went dark."

Alexander studied the wobbly toddler on screen. "They'll see it in person when they return."

Late that night, Alexander stared at the bathroom door in silent dilemma. Evelyn passed by with the sleeping baby, noticing his hesitation. "Need help?"

"I..." His ears flushed pink.

Understanding dawned. "The wounds can't get wet. Sponge bath only."

She efficiently arranged a chair and adjusted the water temperature. As she turned to leave, Alexander had already removed his shirt. The angry burn scars stood stark under the lights, making Evelyn inhale sharply.

"Ugly?" His voice tightened.

Evelyn shook her head, fingers hovering midair. "Does it hurt?"

The washcloth slipped into the water with a splash.
###Chapter 731 The Hardest Chase

"You're still pushing through with injuries like these?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled when she first saw the burns on Alexander's waist. Angry blisters spread across his skin, some already turning white—clear signs of repeated irritation making them worse.

And this was after using folk remedies in the village.

"From the industrial park to the village..." Her voice tightened. "Don't tell me you walked the whole way?"

"Took a cab." Alexander leaned against the bathtub's edge, offering a wry smile through the steam. "Got turned down once. Ended up catching a ride with the construction crew."

He said it casually, but Evelyn's stomach twisted.

"If something had happened halfway..." She gripped the towel. "What would Margaret do?"

The words died in her throat. She'd almost asked, What would Baby Chloe and I do?

"Everything's arranged." Alexander suddenly rubbed his nose, avoiding her gaze. "That stuff I said in the fire... Do you remember?"

In that life-or-death moment, he hadn't filtered his words.

Now, recalling them made his ears burn.

Evelyn wrung out a warm towel and handed it over. "I remember. The stock contracts are still in the bank vault. If I actually used them, you'd have nowhere to return to."

The heater hummed, filling the bathroom with stifling heat.

"I know you don't care about those things." Water droplets slid down Alexander's collarbone as he took the towel. "Building more hospitals would be more useful."

"After the new hospital opens, I'll keep funding remote areas." His tone turned serious. "Any thoughts on the foundation's plan?"

Evelyn rolled up her sleeves, her forearms glowing under the light.

"Leave professional matters to professionals." She lowered her eyes. "Right now, your injuries are the priority."

The warm light softened her profile. Alexander's throat moved. "With you here, the wounds don't hurt as much."

"..." Evelyn frowned. "Who taught you that cheesy line?"

"Lily's dad." Alexander sighed. "Said it works every time for winning his wife over."

Evelyn scoffed. "I thought Vincent Wilson gave you lessons."

"Haven't even seen that playboy lately." He suddenly leaned closer. "Too cheesy?"

"...A little."

"Tch." He chuckled. "You're the hardest chase."

Evelyn arched a brow. "You think I'm one of those girls who chase after you?"

"What girls?"

"Lydia Laurent isn't?"

Alexander laughed. "She wants the Hamilton Group, not me."

Evelyn counted on her fingers. "Young, follows you around—sounds like a fangirl to me."

"You..." His eyes lit up. "Jealous?"

"Correcting your word choice." Her ears pinkened. "Vivian changed her name because the surname fit. What could I even change to?"

"'Safe and Sound'?" Alexander blurted.

"..."

Seeing he still had energy to joke, Evelyn finally relaxed. She adjusted the water temperature and placed fresh clothes within reach.

"Don't soak too long."

As the door closed, she heard soft laughter from inside.
###Chapter 732: The Gears of Fate Turn Again

Alexander Hamilton had just finished cleaning himself when Evelyn Carter leaned over to examine his wounds.

"Didn't get wet," she sighed in relief.

Alexander chuckled lightly. "I have no intention of becoming a cripple."

Evelyn pushed the electric wheelchair forward, her voice gentle. "You need proper rest during this recovery period."

"Mm."

In the living room, Margaret Hamilton and Grace Anderson were playing with the baby. Seeing Evelyn wheel Alexander out, they exchanged knowing smiles.

The gears of fate had finally begun turning again.

Alexander had refused hospitalization, but his injuries required absolute stillness. Every night after spending time with the baby and Evelyn, he returned to the temporary sickroom to rest.

The burn ointment would stain the sheets, compromising treatment. He could only sleep on his stomach, even signing documents bedside.

Once home, his tightly wound nerves relaxed, allowing pain to crash over him like tidal waves. The infected areas would inevitably scar.

"Keep your right leg still," Evelyn handed him a pen, her tone professional.

Alexander accepted it without moving a muscle. "As you command, Doctor."

These days, he followed medical orders to the letter.

Emily Zade smiled. "With Mrs. Hamilton supervising, we're at ease. These are the newly drafted documents."

Evelyn tactfully exited. She had no interest in Alexander's asset distribution, nor would she covet any of it.

"Not having your wife stay to review?" Emily glanced at Evelyn's retreating figure.

Alexander shook his head. "The will only takes effect after I'm gone. Though I may not weigh heavily in her heart, I'd rather not have her grieve prematurely."

He pointed at the document. "Add another clause here for legal to revise..."

In the study, Evelyn pored over nursing materials. Years after graduation, she found herself reliving the tension of final exams.

"Meow—"

A ball of fur leaped onto her lap. The once palm-sized Ragdoll kitten had grown into a plump, round mass.

The cat nestled comfortably against her, kneading rhythmically through the fabric of her clothes.

This was the scene Alexander encountered when he entered.

"Why are you up?" Evelyn instantly shifted into doctor mode.

Alexander regretted his earlier refusal of hospitalization. Medical ethics forbade doctor-patient relationships—he'd cut off his own escape route.

"Didn't touch the wounds," he leaned slightly forward, keeping the injured areas suspended.

Evelyn's expression softened. "Emily left?"

"Yes." Alexander gestured to the cat.

The Ragdoll nimbly jumped onto his lap.

"Far more agile than White Coat," Evelyn suddenly sighed. "After so long apart, I wonder if he'd even remember me."

Alexander fell silent. He didn't want Evelyn retrieving White Coat, nor any renewed contact with that man.

"Cats are more independent," he said tactfully. "An automatic feeder suffices."

Evelyn seemed thoughtful. "He truly doesn't need me."

She stroked the cat gently. "He's thriving here with you all. I won't have to worry about him during work anymore."
###Chapter 733: Half My Credit

Alexander regretted his words the moment they left his lips.

The Ragdoll cat nestled lazily in Evelyn's arms, its sapphire-blue eyes half-lidded, tail flicking idly.

"That's not what I meant," he cleared his throat. "Cats don't need constant companionship, but they do need affection."

He reached out to scratch under the cat's chin.

The feline rolled over blissfully before burrowing back into Evelyn's embrace. Alexander made a mental note to give it extra treats tonight.

"Remember our promise at the temple?" he asked casually. "You agreed to name it."

A name meant connection.

Alexander studied Evelyn's profile, his Adam's apple bobbing. Even co-parenting this cat gave him reason to remain in her life.

Evelyn frowned. "I assumed Aunt Margaret already named it."

"Mimi?" she ventured.

Alexander arched an eyebrow. "That's it?"

"Your turn then."

"You named White Coat so creatively, but for this—"

"Stethoscope?" Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Sphygmomanometer? Scalpel?"

His mouth twitched. "...Mimi it is."

He called softly. The Ragdoll flicked its tail and turned away with regal disdain.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh. "Seems it disagrees."

Alexander's gaze softened. "Since I survived against the odds, how about 'Phoenix'? Symbolizing rebirth—fitting for your profession."

Her fingers stroked the silken fur, suddenly recalling the keychain on Emily's keys.

"Let's call it Peanut," she murmured. "See how its tail tip resembles a peanut shell? And 'good fortune' makes a nice meaning."

Alexander whispered, "Peanut."

"Meow~" The cat nuzzled Evelyn's palm.

Joy rippled through his eyes. "I'll claim half credit for this name."

Aunt Margaret and Grace praised the choice enthusiastically. Lily and Lotus circled the cat, their laughter tinkling like wind chimes.

Grace's eyes suddenly reddened. "Back home, we'd scatter peanuts on newlyweds' beds..."

Her voice trailed off.

The living room air thickened. Margaret shot her son a reproachful look.

Alexander's throat tightened as he immediately looked to Evelyn.

"Mom," Evelyn grasped Grace's hand, "I've been craving your peanut paste dessert."

Grace dabbed her eyes. "I'll make it tonight."

Margaret leaned in. "I've heard that dessert requires real skill?"

"Practice makes perfect." Grace's voice caught, remembering how her late husband had loved her version. Fresh tears welled.

Evelyn squeezed her mother's hand.

Alexander spoke suddenly, "Why not invite Uncle Andrew's family and Vivian for dinner? I've been cooped up too long—need some activity."

Rising with his cane, his gaze brushed Evelyn.

The suggestion was met with immediate enthusiasm. After so much gloom, they needed this gathering like sunlight through storm clouds.

By evening, aromatic steam filled the kitchen. Grace's peanut paste had just finished when Lily and her brother clustered eagerly nearby.

More surprising was Alexander. Leaning on his cane, he'd prepared a perfect sweet-and-sour fish.

Margaret gasped. "When did you learn this?"

"From Auntie Wu." He set the dish before Evelyn, voice tender. "I remembered it's your favorite."
###Chapter 734: Belated Affection Is Worthless

Margaret Hamilton's eyes crinkled with amusement as she gazed at Alexander Hamilton.

Alexander had been eager to showcase his culinary skills in the kitchen, but Evelyn Carter had firmly stopped him with her professional medical knowledge. Allowing him to handle the spatula for this sweet and sour fish was already a concession, considering how long he'd been cooped up.

"Patients need moderate activity," Evelyn said seriously. "But strenuous exercise is strictly prohibited."

Her lips pressed together as she surveyed the perfectly glazed fish on the dining table. Margaret's knowing look left no room for denial. Evelyn had originally planned to make this signature dish herself for safety, never expecting Alexander would have the same idea.

Now she had to quickly switch to stir-fried seasonal vegetables instead.

Just as she rolled up her sleeves, Vivian Dempsey's lively voice exploded behind her. The girl barged in carrying bags upon bags, looking every bit like a relative paying a visit.

"Perfect timing—right at dinner!" Vivian greeted the elders first, then magically produced plush toys from her bags, even remembering Bianca Langley's baby.

Only Alexander was conspicuously left out. He was used to it by now.

Evelyn chuckled. "You arrived just as I was about to cook. What a coincidence."

Vivian wedged herself between them. "Of course! I followed the delicious aroma here."

Grace Anderson and Margaret exchanged smiles before excusing themselves to check on the soup, ushering the children to the living room.

"Why aren't the Andersons here yet..." The elders' chatter faded into the distance.

The Hamilton family kitchen, renovated with modern touches, was spacious and bright. The three of them stood inside without feeling cramped.

Vivian leaned in and sniffed dramatically. "Smells amazing! I forgot how skilled you were."

Evelyn hesitated. "I didn't make this."

She still held the apron Alexander had just taken off.

"Did Auntie...?"

"I made it," Alexander said calmly.

Only the bubbling of the soup pot remained in the sudden silence.

Vivian's expression froze for three full seconds before she abruptly covered her face. "My skin's been allergic lately—can't eat anything too flavorful."

She'd rather faint from hunger than touch a single bite made by that scumbag!

Evelyn pointed at the ingredients, suppressing a laugh. "It's just a simple home-cooked meal tonight. Tell me what you'd like, and I'll make it for you."

Vivian glanced around, suddenly feeling dazed. In the past, Evelyn had seemed like a guest in this house. Now she moved with more ease than the actual host.

"I'll eat anything you make." She linked arms with Evelyn, lowering her voice. "But that guy..."

After confirming Alexander had truly left, Vivian rolled her eyes. "Belated affection is worthless. What's with the sudden act of devotion now?"

Evelyn shook her head gently. "The Andersons are coming tonight, and he really did get hurt because of me. Do me this favor?"

"Fine." Vivian pouted. "Only because he's still somewhat useful. But are you really going back to the mountains? The conditions there are terrible..."

"Baby Chloe needs care." Evelyn's gaze softened. "We'll discuss it after things stabilize."

Mentioning Bianca instantly ignited Vivian's anger, and she launched into a tirade about Vincent Croix. "That bastard is even worse than Alexander!"

Evelyn frowned slightly before changing the subject. "How's the loan situation going?"

"The first few were fine, but later..." Vivian's expression darkened. "Vincent has taken control of the Langley financial operations. Recently he's been biting at everyone like a rabid dog—I almost got dragged into it."
###Chapter 735: Reciprocity

Evelyn Carter knew about Bianca Langley's situation, but it remained a secret between her and Alexander Hamilton—something even Vivian Dempsey couldn't be told. She gripped Vivian's hand anxiously. "Did Vincent Croix cause trouble for you?"

"Not exactly." A faint smile touched Vivian's lips. "The loan was smaller than expected, but it's enough to revive Dempsey Group. With that big order from Laurent Corporation, the company is finally back on its feet. At least I can give my father a proper report when he returns."

For her first time managing a company, Vivian had done remarkably well.

Evelyn had no interest in business. Her previous emergency takeovers had been reluctant obligations. Seeing her best friend find her calling filled her with genuine relief.

Still, an order of this magnitude could have gone to any number of firms under Hamilton Group. That it landed in Vivian's hands was likely due to personal connections.

"Now you can finally breathe easy," Evelyn said softly. "Uncle Dempsey will be at peace too."

She recalled how Leonard Laurent had once used collaboration as a pretext to lure her into contacting Vivian during their resort stay. Back then, she'd feared Vivian might be scammed or that Dempsey Group would collapse—so she'd left the decision entirely to her friend.

Now it was clear those maneuvers had been orchestrated by Lydia Laurent.

Just remembering Lydia's final glare sent a chill down Evelyn's spine. She explained everything to Vivian. "In short, those so-called clients from the Laurents were probably all part of the scheme. Stay vigilant."

Vivian shuddered at the mention of Lydia. "The payment's already settled, but I dealt directly with the end client. Thank goodness you warned me, or I'd have walked right into their trap."

"That's what friends do. They went through such elaborate lengths to make me the middleman—there was never any good intention."

The memory still unsettled Evelyn.

Vivian frowned. "Middleman? But you just emailed me directly. That message you sent from Anderson Corporation."

"Email?"

"Yeah."

Both women froze.

They had phones and messaging apps—why resort to email?

Vivian glanced subtly at Alexander across the room. "Was it him...?"

"Must have been."

Evelyn hadn't realized Alexander had not only managed Anderson Corporation in her absence but also looked out for Vivian.

Vivian was speechless.

Evelyn gave a wry smile. "Back then, I was shattered after losing my father. I couldn't think straight."

Those days felt like being torn apart and clumsily stitched back together.

Before Vivian could press further, voices echoed from the living room. Anthony and Teresa Taylor had arrived—with Emily Anderson in tow.

Emily had returned to school after their father's funeral to prepare for exams. Evelyn had kept her in the dark about recent dangers, not wanting to worry her.

Yet the Taylors had treated Emily as their own, even detouring to her campus to bring her here.

"Sis!" Emily rushed into Evelyn's arms, eyes red.

Evelyn held her close. "Why the tears? I'm fine, see?"

Emily had heard the full story on the way and only cried harder.

Evelyn floundered. The sisters had grown up together, but Emily rarely broke down like this.

Vivian had enough. "You hid everything from her—of course she's terrified now! You're so busy protecting others, have you ever considered how they feel? When you're in danger, we suffer more than you do!"

The words struck Evelyn. She gently patted her sister's back. "I'm sorry. I'll take better care of myself from now on."

Only then did Emily's tears subside into a shaky smile.

That evening, the Hamilton dining room buzzed with rare warmth. The Taylors chatted amiably with Margaret Hamilton, Grace Anderson, and Auntie Marry, while Emily took an instant liking to Lily and Lotus Waters. Conversation flowed late into the night.

The Taylors noticed Evelyn's improved spirits since Alexander's return but tactfully avoided mentioning it.

"We're neighbors now," Anthony said hopefully. "Once you've recovered, bring Alexander over. I owe him a debt I'll never repay."

Compared to the Taylor residence next door, the Hamilton home felt more familiar to Evelyn.

Still conflicted, she steered the talk toward recovery tips—neither accepting nor refusing the invitation.

Alexander waited until everyone had retired before joining Evelyn on the couch. "I may have overstepped tonight."

"Don't apologize." Evelyn gazed at the sleeping baby in her arms. "It's not that I don't want to see them. They've helped me so much."

Alexander sighed. "Family doesn't 'help'—they support each other. That's what family does."

Lost time couldn't be reclaimed. Emotions tangled in Evelyn's chest, finally escaping as a quiet sigh.

Alexander had hoped this convalescence would mend bonds but feared he'd made things worse. At least Evelyn wasn't angry—instead, she brought up something else.

"You were the one who warned Vivian to contact the end client directly, weren't you? I never expected you'd use my name for the email. I should thank you on her behalf. Without that timely connection, she'd have suffered major losses."

She met his eyes. "And Emily—you arranged for her care at school, didn't you?"

With Alexander's evidence, Leonard Laurent would spend his life behind bars, while fugitive Lydia faced arrest upon capture. Laurent Corporation faced imminent seizure, leaving affiliated businesses to count their losses.

Alexander rubbed his nose awkwardly. "Reciprocity. You warned me about the Laurents—I couldn't let your friend walk into fire."

Evelyn's gaze softened. "Why keep all this from me? If I hadn't asked, I might never have known."

"Because I didn't want your gratitude." His deep stare seemed to will time to stand still.

"I just want you to live happily—to stop sacrificing yourself for others."
###Chapter 736: The Old Married Couple

Night deepened as the clamor of the day faded away.

Evelyn lay alone on the plush bed, gazing at the peacefully sleeping baby in the crib. A hollow ache settled in her chest.

Alexander's words before bed lingered in her mind.

"Waaah..."

The baby suddenly whimpered in her sleep, restless.

Evelyn expertly patted her back to soothe her, but tonight, the little one was unusually fussy. Her tiny pink nose scrunched up, and her small hands flailed in the air before dissolving into loud, piercing cries.

"WAAAAH—"

The quiet bedroom was instantly filled with wails.

Evelyn hastily threw on her robe and scooped the baby into her arms, rocking her gently. The diaper was already heavy, and she swiftly changed it, but the tears continued to fall like unstrung pearls.

"Are you hungry?"

She tried to prepare a bottle, but the baby clung tightly to her sleeve. Attempting to handle boiling water one-handed was too dangerous. Just as she debated waking her mother for help, a soft knock sounded at the door.

"Come in."

Alexander appeared silently on crutches, his gaze landing on the flustered Evelyn. "Auntie Wu mentioned babies at this age are teething. They tend to be restless at night."

"I've only handled newborns. I don’t have much experience with this age," Evelyn admitted, her bangs disheveled. "Here, hold her while I make the bottle."

Without waiting for a response, she deposited the baby into Alexander’s arms. The man stiffened on the edge of the bed, careful not to let the medicinal scent on him bother the child.

Evelyn dashed out like a whirlwind and returned moments later with a bottle and a toy. The baby latched onto the nipple immediately, tears still clinging to her lashes as she sucked eagerly.

"So she was hungry," Evelyn sighed in relief. "Last time I took care of her, she slept through the night without waking."

"Ooh!" The baby suddenly let out a delighted squeal, her big eyes sparkling—any trace of sleepiness gone.

The two adults exchanged glances. Alexander opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by a massive yawn. Evelyn, as if infected, yawned right after.

"Ooh-ah!" The baby giggled even harder.

"I thought yawning was contagious," Evelyn rubbed her tired eyes. "Why are we exhausted, but she’s wide awake?"

Alexander fought to keep his eyelids open. "Probably slept too much during the day."

For the next two hours, they took turns entertaining her. Alexander propped himself against the headboard as a human guardrail while Evelyn waved a dancing bunny plush. Only when the first light of dawn crept across the sky did the baby finally let out a tiny yawn.

They seized the opportunity like a lifeline, placing her in the center of the bed and flanking her, gently patting her to sleep. It was a trick they’d discovered at the resort—double the security, double the speed to dreamland.

Sure enough, tiny fists clenched, and she drifted off quickly.

Evelyn carefully tucked in the blanket while Alexander wordlessly rolled down his sleeves to prevent teething bites. The motions flowed seamlessly, as if rehearsed a thousand times.

Exhausted, they collapsed into sleep—only to be awakened by a chubby little hand slapping their faces.

In the morning light of the dining room, the two dark-eyed zombies mechanically sipped from the same glass of milk. Margaret watched them take turns lifting the cup, her expression unreadable—until Evelyn suddenly realized...

There was another full glass sitting right beside her.
###Chapter 737: An Awkward Coincidence

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the dining room.

Aunt Wu had prepared an elaborate breakfast, with utensils and cups arranged separately. Due to Alexander's right hand burns, his cutlery was placed on the left while his cup remained on the right.

Still half-asleep, Evelyn instinctively reached for the milk glass on her right and took a sip.

A second later, realization struck like lightning.

She'd just used Alexander's cup!

Her fingers crept toward the glass to swap it back, only to brush against the bandaged back of Alexander's hand. Both recoiled as if electrocuted.

Alexander had clearly noticed the blunder too. He moved to discreetly exchange the cups before she noticed.

Their movements synchronized perfectly.

"Oh, what's the big deal about using the wrong glass?" Margaret Hamilton and Grace Anderson chuckled from across the table. "With so many cups here, just switch them."

Evelyn awkwardly rubbed her nose.

She did have germaphobic tendencies, but openly rejecting her ex-husband's used glass in front of her former mother-in-law seemed inappropriate.

"Right, we'll just switch."

Alexander pushed his fresh glass toward her and kept using the one she'd sipped from.

Evelyn decided to pretend nothing happened and focused on her breakfast.

Today was Alexander's follow-up appointment. Dressed casually and leaning on a cane, he prepared to leave.

"Take the wheelchair instead," Evelyn intercepted him. "You'll be standing for hours at the hospital."

Alexander smirked. "Doctor Carter enforcing protocol?"

Her gaze dropped to his legs. Beyond the leg injury, his body bore multiple burns and abrasions.

All injuries sustained for her sake.

"Are you rushing back to the office?" she hesitated. "If you need to—"

"No hurry." He cut her off. "I want to experience what ordinary couples do when visiting doctors together."

Central Hospital held profound significance for Evelyn. Pushing Alexander through familiar corridors, she even forgot to look for Olivia.

"Bone healing looks excellent," the doctor said after reviewing the scans. "Just avoid strenuous activity."

The real concern was the burns. The wounds looked gruesome during dressing changes, but Evelyn, accustomed to all manner of injuries, remained unfazed.

Alexander shifted uncomfortably.

"Did we pay the bill?" he suddenly asked.

"During the scan," Evelyn replied, puzzled.

"My throat feels sore," he amended.

"Any other symptoms?"

"Just thirsty, probably."

Evelyn stood. "I'll get water."

"Hot water," Alexander added. "In a paper cup."

She studied him suspiciously. "Are you sure it's just your throat?"

"Positive." He nudged her along. "Say hello to Olivia for me. Her medication list last time was incredibly helpful."

Baffled, Evelyn left. The moment she disappeared, Alexander pivoted his wheelchair toward the administrative elevators.

In the OB-GYN office, Olivia had just finished rounds.

"Doctor Carter!" She brightened upon seeing Evelyn. "You're back!"

Evelyn smiled. "Do you have paper cups? I need hot water."

Olivia handed her a cup, eyes sparkling. "Are you staying this time?"

"Not leaving for now," Evelyn said softly. "Even if I do... it won't be until next year."
###Chapter 738: Silent Guardian

Olivia Lightfoot blinked at me mischievously and leaned in. "Dr. Carter, stop playing coy. With your credentials, any top hospital overseas would fight to have you. Everyone's thrilled you're coming back."

I was completely baffled.

"I did want to return to OB-GYN, but the hiring process isn't finalized yet. Did the timeline move up this year?" I frowned in confusion.

Her smile froze. "But the director announced it at last week's meeting! The entire department knows you're returning. Were you really going to keep it from me?"

The news hit me like a thunderbolt.

I forced composure. "The exact date isn't set yet—"

"Are you leaving again?" Olivia grabbed my hand urgently.

"No." I shook my head quickly, spotting a patient's family member peering down the hallway. "Go on, someone's waiting for you."

After sending her off, I wandered back to the Burn Department in a daze. The waiting area was empty—Alexander Hamilton had vanished.

The exam room door opened, but it wasn't him who emerged.

"Mr. Hamilton had to leave urgently," the doctor adjusted his glasses. "Didn't he find you?"

I managed a weak smile.

"Dr. Carter," the doctor added suddenly, "the director mentioned you'll give an academic presentation after your return. We're all eager to hear about your grassroots experience."

My pulse jumped. Did the whole hospital know?

The director's office door was slightly ajar. Alexander's deep voice carried through:

"...The lab equipment arrives next week. But regarding Evelyn, please keep it confidential for now."

"But I've already announced it at the meeting," the director said hesitantly. "Should I ask staff not to mention it around her?"

Pressed against the wall, my heart pounded wildly.

"She will return." Alexander's voice was resolute. "I won't use these injuries to trap her. Being a doctor is her dream."

I stumbled back two steps and fled.

All this time, unseen by me, he'd been paving my way home.

Back at the Burn Department entrance, I sat numbly on a bench until the sound of wheelchair wheels approached.

Alexander clearly hadn't expected me here. His fingers tightened slightly on the armrests.

"Where were you?" I asked casually, looking up. "Any later and the doctors would've left."

Sunlight streamed through the far window, casting fractured light across his sharp profile. His lashes trembled, leaving delicate shadows beneath his eyes.

"The restroom," he answered softly, gaze lingering on my faintly flushed ears.

I fiddled with the appointment slip in my hands, the paper whispering. The antiseptic hospital scent suddenly felt overwhelming.

"Hungry?" he asked abruptly. "There's a new Cantonese place across the street."

When I looked up, his dark eyes held mine intently. Sunlight danced in his hair, softening his edges with gold.

"Okay," I heard myself say.

In that moment, I understood—some guardianships need no words. Like everything he'd done for me, always silent.
###Chapter 739: I'll Love Anything You Give Me

"I need to use the restroom." Alexander Hamilton indeed used this excuse.

He hoped she'd press further, but Evelyn Carter simply urged him to hurry for his dressing change. When he emerged from the clinic sweating, she handed him a cup of water. "It's just the right temperature."

Olivia Lightfoot had been too excited while pouring and forgot to adjust it, yet it turned out perfectly by chance.

Alexander took a sip, his tense shoulders finally relaxing.

Evelyn drove them back. Glancing at Alexander in the passenger seat, a twinge of guilt surfaced. Perhaps she should show more concern for the patient.

"New Year's Day is next week. Any plans?" she asked, unusually initiating conversation.

He blinked. "Do you have something in mind?"

When he turned the question back, Evelyn explained, "You saved me, helped Vivian and Emily. I should express my gratitude. But I'm terrible at picking gifts—why don't you choose?"

"I'll love anything you give me." His reply came without hesitation.

Even if she plucked a random leaf, he'd treasure it.

Evelyn frowned. "Then... dinner?"

She'd used this too often, even she found it perfunctory.

Remembering how she'd once invited Gregory Wilson home for dinner, Alexander mused, "Since it's almost New Year's, why not spend New Year's Eve with me? The doctor said my leg will heal in a week."

Counting down to midnight was a trendy couple's ritual. Legend said holding hands at zero ensured lasting love.

Though he knew it was superstition, Alexander chose to believe.

"Alright," she agreed.

The week flew by. Alexander rehabbed with almost manic enthusiasm, even driving to pick up Lily and Lotus himself—just to prove his injury had healed.

Evelyn, riding shotgun, teased, "A sprain takes months to heal. Did you fast-forward?"

Alexander deadpanned, "Sitting in a wheelchair was embarrassing enough. Staying home longer would've made me moldy."

Truthfully, his wound still ached when walking. But for their New Year's date, he gritted his teeth through the pain.

Normally, the Hamilton chauffeur fetched the Waters siblings. Their homeroom teacher eyed the newcomers warily. "Who are you to these children?"

"Big brother and sister," the kids chorused.

The teacher squinted. "You're siblings too?"

Young people these days avoided having kids—yet this family had two sets of siblings?

As Alexander and Evelyn exchanged glances, preparing explanations, Lily tugged the teacher aside for a whisper.

The teacher's expression cleared instantly, waving them through.

Curious, Evelyn asked, "What did you tell her?"

She held Lotus's hand while Alexander guided Lily, the four strolling toward the gates.

Lily grinned mischievously. "I said you're divorced."

Privacy concerns meant the teacher asked no further.

Evelyn sighed. "That worked today, but what if someone else picks them up next time?"

Lotus suddenly piped up, "Just say you remarried. Teachers won't pry then."

The response left Evelyn torn between laughter and exasperation. She quickly changed subjects. "Roasted sweet potatoes ahead—want some?"

"Yes!" the children shouted in unison.

Alexander bought three, distributing them before offering the last to Evelyn.

"I couldn't carry four, and I don't like them," he claimed, though his gaze lingered on the treat.

Hiding a smile, Evelyn broke hers in half, handing him a portion. "In high school, I often ate these as midnight snacks..."

It was her first voluntary childhood memory share. Alexander listened intently, as if this granted him access to her past.

New Year's Eve streets glittered with decorations. Pushing a stroller, they blended into the festive crowd.

"No wonder the baby insisted on coming," Evelyn adjusted the infant's hat. "This excitement is rare. The old saying's right—look how cheerful everyone is."

Alexander steadied the stroller. "Which saying? Surely not 'since we're already here'?"

"'It's the holidays,'" Evelyn laughed.

Deliberately baiting more conversation, Alexander pointed at light displays. "Both apply now. No rush back—Mom took Lily and Lotus to celebrate with Uncle Andrew. Good thing you agreed to join me, or I'd be alone tonight."

His tone was light, but anticipation glimmered beneath.
###Chapter 740: The Warmth of Home

"They're having a New Year's Eve celebration in the shopping district tonight," Alexander murmured as he adjusted Baby Chloe's scarf, his fingers lingering on the soft fabric. "Balloon release at midnight, plus a raffle."

Evelyn tucked a windblown strand of hair behind her ear. "I've never even won a 'buy one get one free' soda in my life."

The baby suddenly reached out with tiny hands, babbling excitedly at the distant twinkle lights. Neon hues painted her round cheeks pink, her wide eyes brimming with wonder.

"Seems like someone wants to go," Alexander chuckled. "They say beginners' luck favors children."

Evelyn leaned down to secure the car seat straps. "We leave immediately if it gets too crowded."

Caring for this child had upended their routines. Yet every time those dimpled cheeks curved into a smile, exhaustion melted into tenderness. With Bianca's return imminent, this fleeting kinship approached its expiration date.

"Once Miss Langley comes back..." Alexander hesitated, then steadied his voice. "I want to be Chloe's godfather."

Evelyn's fingers twisted unconsciously. She remembered her firm refusal months ago—words that now lodged in her throat.

"Then..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "The godmother position..."

"Thirty is too old to be an aunt." She turned away, earlobes burning.

Amusement crinkled the corners of his eyes. "Would that make us different generations? Should you start calling me—"

"Did Vincent show you those ridiculous romance novels again?" she huffed.

"His reputation in your eyes is beyond salvage."

A young man with a camera slung across his chest approached. "Excuse me, may I take your photo? Just for my portfolio and a newspaper feature."

Alexander instantly shielded Evelyn. "Sorry, we'd rather not."

"What a shame." The photographer sighed. "You radiate such happiness—perfect for our 'Home' theme."

Evelyn froze. That single syllable—home—pricked like a needle against her heart. The word had felt incomplete since her father left.

"No faces needed," the man pressed earnestly. "Your silhouettes together tell the whole story. I'll mail you prints."

Silent consent passed between them. Rounding the corner, Evelyn glanced back to see the photographer reviewing his shots, lips curved in satisfaction.

As midnight neared, Alexander cradled the stroller with one arm and grasped Evelyn's hand with the other, carving out space in the jubilant crowd.

"Know why I agreed to the photo?" he asked.

She met his gaze, twin constellations reflected in his eyes. "Because of home."

The countdown began. A young man hoisted his girlfriend overhead, drawing cheers. Evelyn shook her head. "Kids these da—"

Her words dissolved into a gasp as strong hands lifted her and the baby skyward. She instinctively tightened her hold on the giggling child.

"Trust me," he mouthed through the noise, arms steady as bedrock.

Above them, the first firework split the night in a shower of gold.
###Chapter 741: Making Peace with the Past

New Year's Eve fireworks illuminated the entire city.

Alexander Hamilton lifted Evelyn Carter high, making her the brightest presence in the crowd.

As the clock struck midnight, heart-shaped balloons filled the sky. Evelyn's gaze traveled over the sea of people, watching the dazzling balloon spectacle drift across the night.

"So this is the romance young people love," she murmured softly.

Alexander's arms remained steady as stone. Around them, couples had long given up, lowering their partners to the ground. Only he still held Evelyn effortlessly.

"Tired?" she asked, looking down at him.

He tilted his head up, his eyes reflecting the fireworks. "Not at all. Do you like it?"

"It's beautiful."

"Then it's worth it."

Noticing the faint tremble in his arms, she whispered, "Put me down."

Only then did Alexander slowly crouch, carefully setting her and their baby on the ground. The little one giggled excitedly, pointing at the sky with babbling enthusiasm.

"Does she want a balloon?" Evelyn asked with a smile.

Alexander scanned their surroundings. "The ones released are gone, but there should be vendors ahead."

He flexed his aching leg subtly. Evelyn caught sight of his scuffed dress shoes and couldn't help asking again, "Is your leg really okay? You startled me when you suddenly lifted me earlier."

The thought of potentially falling and hurting their baby made her grip the stroller handle tightly.

Alexander merely smiled, unbothered. "If I couldn't handle carrying my girls, what kind of man would I be?"

Evelyn settled the baby back into the stroller, and Alexander naturally took the handle. "Let's go see what's ahead."

Amid the New Year's revelry, everyone carried their own stories—some hopeful for the year ahead, others just seeking escape from the shadows of the past.

Evelyn watched the sparkling sky, silently bidding farewell to yesterday.

Alexander quickly found a balloon vendor. Among the usual helium balloons were long, twisted animal shapes—retro toys that made Evelyn freeze.

"My dad used to buy these for me when I was little," she said without thinking. "Later, when money was tight, he learned to make them himself..." Catching herself, she quickly changed the subject. "I didn’t expect them to come back in style."

As Alexander tied a balloon for their baby, he immediately reached for the long ones. Evelyn stopped him. "There's no room in the stroller. We should head home."

She didn’t notice him quietly purchasing a few uninflated balloons.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains.

Evelyn opened her eyes to find a balloon dog resting on her nightstand.

She rubbed her eyes, wondering if she was still dreaming. She hadn’t bought such childish toys since adulthood. The last time she’d received one was from Vivian, earning endless teasing from Annabelle.

The crib was empty—Alexander must have taken their early-rising baby. Evelyn picked up the balloon dog, the rubber cool against her fingertips.

The bedroom door creaked open softly.

Alexander tiptoed in with the baby, only to freeze when he met Evelyn’s alert gaze.

"Morning," she said, shaking the balloon and making the baby laugh.

He settled their daughter back into the crib and draped a shawl over Evelyn’s shoulders. "This little tyrant woke up an hour ago and even slapped me."

Though complaining, his voice brimmed with affection.

"This..." She held up the balloon dog. "Did you go out early to buy it?"

"I made it." Alexander studied her. "I guessed you didn’t refuse last night because you didn’t want one—you just feared a store-bought version wouldn’t match your memories."

The balloon dog was identical to the ones her father had once crafted.

The late morning sun was warm.

Evelyn and Alexander had breakfast in the greenhouse with their baby. Grace Anderson and Margaret Hamilton had stayed overnight at Anthony Taylor’s, and even Auntie Wu had gone home for the holiday.

The grand dining room felt unusually quiet.

"Let’s eat in the greenhouse," Alexander said suddenly. "There’s something I want to show you."

His gaze drifted toward the window, where something glimmered in the daylight.
###Chapter 742: The Hidden Regret

Evelyn Carter froze when the greenhouse door swung open.

The sight before her bore no resemblance to her memories. Where flower stands once stood, solid wood furniture now occupied the space. Medical tomes lined the shelves against the wall, their pages dappled with sunlight filtering through the glass ceiling.

Baby Chloe babbled excitedly, reaching for a pot of blooming primroses. Alexander Hamilton swiftly plucked a few blossoms. His slender fingers wove the petals into a delicate bracelet, which he gently fastened around the baby's wrist.

"You can return to the hospital after the New Year." His voice was soft. "The lighting here is perfect for reading."

Evelyn approached the bookshelf, tracing the spines with her fingertips. Some of these original medical texts weren't even available in the hospital library. The top shelf held volumes she knew intimately—the very ones Annabelle Taylor had once sold as scrap.

"Columbia University's collection?" She pulled one out, flipping through the pages.

Alexander stood half a step behind her. "Called in some favors. A few more are still being negotiated—"

"Don't bother." She closed the book firmly. "They're more valuable in the library."

"Then I'll have them photocopied." His gaze lingered on her faint smile.

The greenhouse had been transformed with meticulous care. Soundproof glass muted the outside world, while lush greenery filled the view. Evelyn noticed even the chair height had been adjusted for her, with protective bumpers added to the table corners.

On Minor New Year's Day, Evelyn finally relinquished all company responsibilities. Alexander entered with a fruit platter as she played with the baby in the crib.

"Your chosen partners are all reliable." He handed her a peeled orange. "Seems my decision was right."

She knew he meant the will. They hadn't spoken of it since their argument, but some matters couldn't remain unaddressed.

"I wanted to tear up that document in anger," she admitted, accepting the fruit. "Until I thought you really..." Her voice trailed off.

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. The baby suddenly grabbed the rattle from his hand, its cheerful jingle shattering the silence.

"Let's travel before Spring Festival," he changed the subject. "Take Chloe south for a while."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "A whole month? But the hospital—"

"Everything's arranged." His eyes held hers. "Consider it making up for..." The words died on his lips.

Their rushed wedding three years ago had left no time for a honeymoon, canceled by their respective careers. Now, watching Evelyn's profile as she bent over their child, that regret burned sharper than ever. Outside the glass walls, wintersweet blossoms unfurled silently against the cold.
###Chapter 743: Honeymoon Getaway

Evelyn Carter had been immersed in medical literature lately, her thoughts growing increasingly analytical. She stared at the date on the calendar, completely oblivious to its special significance.

"Does that mean you won’t be able to spend New Year’s with Aunt Margaret?" she suddenly asked, looking up.

The moment the words left her mouth, she remembered her own situation and hesitated. "This timing really isn’t ideal. It feels wrong to leave the elders alone at home for the holidays while we go off traveling. And Emily—if we don’t take her, she’ll throw a fit."

Alexander Hamilton watched the thoughtful curve of her profile, warmth flooding his chest. He wished time could freeze in this moment forever.

"Don’t worry, they won’t be alone," Alexander said with a light chuckle. "I arranged a vacation in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand for Mother and Aunt Grace. Emily can join them too. If we stayed, we’d just be sitting in an empty house."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. He really had been making a lot of arrangements lately—even the vacation plans were this thorough.

She was about to agree when another concern surfaced. "My mother has never been abroad before, and she doesn’t speak the language..."

"Uncle Andrew and Aunt Grace will be going with them," Alexander cut in, dispelling her worry. "They can look out for each other."

That settled it—Evelyn was fully reassured.

Before their departure, Evelyn packed meticulously, hesitating before finally sending Bianca Langley a message. But the text vanished into the void, not even triggering a read receipt.

Bianca seemed to have evaporated from the world. If not for the occasional updates about the Langley family in financial news, Evelyn might have suspected something terrible had happened.

She’s probably trying to keep Vincent Croix completely in the dark. Evelyn sighed softly and turned her attention back to checking the baby supplies. Three of their five suitcases were stuffed with infant essentials.

Alexander insisted his injuries had fully healed and personally handled the luggage. From check-in to loading the car, he wouldn’t let Evelyn lift a finger.

The local branch manager, alarmed by the sudden visit from the CEO, rushed to the airport in person—only to find the great Mr. Hamilton preoccupied with hauling bags. The sight made him even more nervous.

"Mr. Hamilton, are you sure you don’t need to inspect our operations?" the manager asked for the third time.

Alexander didn’t look up. "Last year’s performance was solid. Keep it up."

The manager turned to Evelyn, who seemed more approachable. "Mrs. Hamilton, the hotel and private car are all arranged. Would you like a local guide? My assistant could double as one."

Evelyn didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. "Really, that’s unnecessary. We’re just here to relax."

The manager’s eyes lit with understanding. "Ah, I see—an incognito inspection." He glanced at the stroller and lowered his voice. "Don’t worry, Mrs. Hamilton. The child’s matter will stay confidential."

Evelyn sighed. "Could you not call me 'Mrs. Hamilton'?"

"Of course, Madam."

Alexander reappeared just then, pulling the manager aside. When they returned, the man promptly switched to addressing her as "Miss Carter."

On the road, Evelyn couldn’t resist asking, "What did you say to him?"

"I told him we’re here for our honeymoon," Alexander replied without batting an eye.

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "Aren’t you worried about rumors spreading?"

"Better than having them follow us around 24/7," Alexander said calmly. "This way, they’ll leave us alone."

Evelyn had no rebuttal. The excuse was absurd, but undeniably effective.

The southern town had a mild, pleasant climate. At dusk, they strolled down the street pushing the stroller and ducked into a casual noodle shop.

The baby watched with fascination as the adults ate. Evelyn said to the owner, "One more bowl of plain rice noodles, no seasoning."

The owner caught on immediately. "For the little one, right? I’ll bring a small complimentary portion."

"Thank you," Evelyn smiled.
###Chapter 744: Since We're Here

Kindness during travels always warms the heart.

When the rice noodles arrived, Evelyn Carter had just picked up her chopsticks. Alexander Hamilton had already deftly opened the disposable utensils. He scooped a spoonful of clear broth noodles, blew on it gently, and offered it to Baby Chloe. The little one's eyes lit up at the first taste, tiny hands waving for more.

"Slow down." Alexander wiped the broth from her lips with a bib, his touch as delicate as handling fragile porcelain.

They were the only customers in the shop. The owner, with nothing better to do, turned on the TV and sat nearby. "You're quite skilled with kids, young man. In all my years running this place, I've rarely seen fathers as attentive as you."

Evelyn lowered her head over her noodles, the corner of her mouth twitching. They'd been mistaken for a family so often on this trip that she'd stopped bothering to correct people.

Alexander, however, uncharacteristically chatty, replied, "Traveling with a child requires extra preparation. By the way, any recommendations for lesser-known spots around here?"

His tone was casual, but beneath the table, his fingers discreetly opened a map. Evelyn caught the subtle movement, amusement flickering in her eyes.

The owner perked up immediately. "Head east ten minutes to Seaside Park—it's the off-season, so hardly any crowds. Oh, and the shopping district's hosting a New Year's market..."

A breaking news report cut him off mid-sentence.

"Latest developments in the alleged poisoning case involving Leonard Laurent, former CEO of Banyan Group..."

Alexander's fingers stilled. Evelyn's chopsticks hovered mid-air as both turned toward the screen.

"Damn shame!" The owner slapped his thigh. "Killing a college student over a piece of land—karma's biting back now, huh? Heard Banyan's stock's in freefall."

The news cut to a young man in a wheelchair at a rehabilitation center. Evelyn's chest tightened; the hot broth suddenly felt impossible to swallow.

"Consequences come full circle," Alexander said quietly, his knuckles whitening.

The owner suddenly leaned closer, scrutinizing him. "Hey, you look just like that Hamilton Group CEO! Saw him on short videos yesterday—"

Cough cough cough! Evelyn choked violently on chili, face flushing crimson. As Alexander handed her a napkin, she shot him a frantic look: Let's go!

"Really?" Alexander remained impassive. "Guess I'll have to work harder to actually become a CEO someday."

The owner roared with laughter. "You're way better than him! Online rumors say that Hamilton guy nearly married the Laurent daughter after his divorce—whole family's a mess..."

Evelyn bit her lip hard. Baby Chloe's sudden "ba-ba!" from the stroller shattered the awkward tension.

Stepping outside, they were greeted by a sky painted in sunset hues. Evelyn finally burst into laughter, the baby giggling and waving her arms in response.

"Seaside Park?" Alexander pushed the stroller, the tips of his ears still faintly pink.

Salty ocean breezes brushed their hair as Evelyn gazed at the fiery clouds. The past suddenly felt as distant as another lifetime.

"Let's go." She nudged a pebble with her foot. "Since we're here."
###Chapter 745: Jealousy and a Windbreaker

Since we're already here, we can't just have a meal and return to the hotel, can we?

Alexander wanted Evelyn to truly relax and leave last year's gloom behind. He took the backpack and stroller from her, allowing her to move freely.

The noodle shop owner hadn't lied—this seaside park was breathtaking. The shallow shore was covered in smooth pebbles, attracting both tourists and locals for strolls and photos.

Some had even set up tents, clearly planning to spend the entire day here.

Evelyn wore only a simple long dress with a shirt, her hair tied into a casual ponytail. Yet when she stood on the shore, she still drew the attention of several young men.

"Hi, are you here alone to see the ocean?" A bespectacled guy mustered the courage to approach her.

"No," Evelyn answered honestly. "Just taking a walk."

The guy's carefully rehearsed poetic lines instantly evaporated. As he scrambled for a new topic, the stroller suddenly bumped into him, nearly knocking him off balance.

"Sorry." Alexander pushed the stroller forward, expressionless, wedging himself between them.

The guy frowned. "It's fine."

"My wife and I are here on vacation." Alexander's tone was calm, but each word struck like a dagger.

The guy's face froze. Wife? Vacation? This fresh-faced, sweet-looking girl was already married with a child?!

"My apologies!" He fled in embarrassment, his retreating figure as awkward as if he were being chased by a dog.

Alexander's expression darkened like ink.

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "You scared him half to death."

"He got off easy just being scared away." Alexander scoffed. "Young people these days have no sense."

Evelyn glanced down at her bare ring finger.

She couldn’t blame him for misunderstanding.

Alexander noticed too, clearing his throat subtly as he closed the distance between them. At the very least, he wanted it to be obvious to onlookers that they were together.

A faint, unmistakable scent of jealousy hung in the air. Evelyn sighed. "He probably didn’t see you. The stroller isn’t easy to push on pebbles."

"I'll hold the baby." Alexander volunteered to take on the role of a "human shield."

With the baby in his arms, Alexander didn’t even need to speak to deter any potential admirers. Yet Evelyn's gentle, serene aura still attracted lingering glances.

"I'm going to buy something," Alexander suddenly announced.

Evelyn assumed he meant water. "Do you want me to hold the baby?"

"Mm." He carefully handed the child over.

Soon, he returned with a shopping bag from a well-known outdoor brand.

"Are you cold?" Evelyn eyed the windbreaker in his hands.

"It's for you." Without waiting for a response, he draped it over her shoulders. "Olivia mentioned you have a weak constitution and shouldn’t catch a chill."

The men's windbreaker swallowed her whole, covering even her wrists. In an instant, she went from a graceful lady to a walking tent.

"..." Evelyn was torn between laughter and exasperation. "Was that really necessary? It was just a kid trying to chat me up."

Hearing this, Alexander finally relaxed. "Why aren’t you bothered?"

Lately, his sense of crisis had skyrocketed, terrified someone might swoop in and steal her away.

"After a divorce, you stop caring about these things." She rolled up the sleeves slightly. "Besides, I don’t like younger guys. What’s the difference between that and babysitting?"

Alexander nearly blurted out asking if she’d consider rekindling their old flame. But he swallowed the words—getting rejected under such a beautiful sunset would be too cruel.

Silently, he pushed the stroller, walking slowly beside her. Now, his mind was entirely occupied by her earlier words, leaving no room to dwell on the glances still directed at Evelyn.

At least with him here, no one would dare get close.

By the time they circled back to the starting point, the bespectacled guy was long gone—likely too embarrassed to stay.
###Chapter 746: Speak of the Devil

Alexander Hamilton watched the retreating figure of the failed flirt, his tense shoulders finally relaxing.

Evelyn Carter hadn't given the brief encounter a second thought. She glanced at the sky, noticing how the southern town's dusk carried a gentler warmth than expected.

Adjusting the stroller's sunshade to shield Baby Chloe from the evening breeze, she said, "Let's head back."

The resort hotel was just a twenty-minute walk away.

"Together," Alexander immediately responded.

He hadn't come for sightseeing. Where Evelyn went, he followed.

Bathed in sunset hues, the trio walked side by side—a picture-perfect family returning from an outing.

The hotel neighbored a bustling pedestrian street, its neon lights painting the avenue in vibrant colors. The night market teemed with couples and groups of giggling girlfriends.

"This way?" Alexander gestured toward the lively stalls. "We can pick up gifts for Mom and Aunt Margaret."

Evelyn turned the stroller. "Good idea."

She began counting on her fingers. "Emily and Vivian's gifts first. Then Lily and Lotus, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson..."

Alexander chuckled as she listed recipients. "We might need another suitcase."

"You choose, I'll carry," he offered. "Your taste is impeccable—Mom will love whatever you pick."

Evelyn eyed him curiously. "Only getting something for Aunt Margaret?"

After a pause, he ventured, "Olivia?"

"Just local snacks—she loves food. Anyone else?"

"Your dean and Natalie?"

"Yes, we might need the dean's help later."

Alexander cleared his throat tentatively. "Should we...get something for Gregory too? He looked after you before."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow, suddenly understanding.

"Let's get gifts for both Wilson brothers then," she said leisurely. "Vincent always calls you 'Big Bro Hamilton'—wouldn't be fair otherwise. Any other friends to include?"

He nearly nodded before catching himself. "No. Grown men can buy their own things."

Evelyn found his reaction odd but didn't dwell on it.

Baby Chloe giggled, mesmerized by the market's colorful lights. Alexander bought a plush toy and placed it in her stroller with the grace of a seasoned father. The baby reached for it, beaming.

Stepping back to make way, Evelyn suddenly felt her foot meet resistance.

"Sorry, I—"

Her apology froze as she recognized the face before her.

Alexander moved protectively forward, then stiffened at the sight.

Speak of the devil indeed.

Gregory Wilson stood before them, his gaze shifting between the three before settling on the stroller. "Evelyn, Mr. Hamilton. What a coincidence. Vacationing?"

"Yes," Evelyn replied politely. "You?"

"Medical symposium." His eyes strayed to the stroller again. "This is...?"

"My daughter," Alexander declared.

Evelyn's eyes widened.

"Goddaughter counts," he added innocently.

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Miss Langley hasn't agreed yet."

"She will." Alexander sounded utterly confident.

Gregory stood awkwardly, suddenly feeling like an outsider.

Evelyn smoothly changed topics. "Have you decided to practice here permanently?"

"Still considering," Gregory admitted. "This trip's for independent research. Anesthesiology requires continuous learning."

Her eyes brightened. "Is the forum open to public?"

"You can join me," he offered quickly. "The organizers allow guests."
###Chapter 747: The Line Between Intimacy and Distance

Alexander Hamilton's nerves instantly tightened.

Evelyn Carter's eyes visibly brightened at the mention of the medical forum. He had to act fast—otherwise, he'd be left alone with a crying baby for the next two days.

"Dr. Wilson," Alexander spoke first, his tone deliberately calm. "What a coincidence to run into you at the medical forum. Which hotel are you staying at? If traveling together is inconvenient, just give us the address."

He strained to control his voice, but an icy edge still seeped through. If not for his concern about Evelyn's opinion of him, his words might have been far less polite.

Evelyn offered Gregory Wilson an apologetic smile.

That subtle expression instantly drew a clear boundary between closeness and distance.

A pang of bitterness rose in Gregory's chest, but he quickly let it go. He had been deliberately keeping his distance lately, and Evelyn had never reached out. The night market bustled with crowds, yet an invisible wall seemed to stand between them.

"I'm staying at the Pearl Hotel," Gregory said, then added to Evelyn, "The forum is at the convention center—just use your GPS. Feel free to contact me if you need anything."

Evelyn suddenly asked, "The forum starts today, so you must have arrived yesterday?"

The question seemed abrupt, but Gregory answered earnestly, "I got here yesterday afternoon. I was delayed with business in Hudson City and almost missed it."

"We arrived yesterday afternoon too," Evelyn said, visibly relieved, her smile softening. "And we're staying at the same hotel."

Gregory looked genuinely surprised. "What a coincidence."

Alexander scoffed. "Indeed. Too much of one."

"The hotel was arranged by the organizers," Gregory explained helplessly.

"Of course," Alexander said, his lips twisting into a smirk. "The world is full of coincidences."

Gregory didn't bother clarifying further. Instead, he glanced at the baby in the stroller. "I heard about the Langley family's situation. Such a lovely child—Vincent Croix truly doesn’t know what he’s throwing away."

Evelyn tensed. "Miss Langley entrusted us with the baby in confidence. If word gets out—"

"I understand," Gregory said with a bitter smile. "I have no connection to Vincent. Even if he asked around, he wouldn’t get anything from me. Besides, I genuinely know nothing."

Evelyn looked remorseful. "I’m not doubting you. It’s just that this child has suffered enough already..."

"I get it," Gregory said gently, though a flicker of disappointment crossed his eyes. "May I hold her?"

Evelyn hesitated. "That depends on whether she’ll let you."

Alexander raised an eyebrow but stayed silent.

The baby usually smiled at everyone, but apart from Evelyn and Alexander, she cried whenever anyone else held her. Even Margaret Hamilton and Grace Anderson, who had cared for her for so long, could only manage brief moments.

Gregory, unaware of the gravity of the situation, reached out confidently—he had always been good with children.

"Waaah—!" The baby burst into tears instantly.

Gregory froze, awkwardly patting her back. The little one only cried harder, tiny arms flailing.

Nearby tourists cast curious glances.

"That baby is wailing so hard—was she taken by a stranger?" someone murmured. "Though that man looks decently dressed..."

Gregory, embarrassed, quickly placed the baby back in the stroller.

The crying stopped abruptly.

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged startled looks, both poised to comfort the child.

"This little one..." Gregory forced a smile. "She’s not even a year old yet, right? Stranger anxiety is normal."

As the baby quieted, the onlookers gradually lost interest.

Alexander exhaled inwardly, warmth flooding his chest. The baby only recognized him and Evelyn—this bond felt almost like a blood connection.

Gregory chatted with Evelyn for a few more minutes about the forum before excusing himself. Though they were staying at the same hotel, he chose a different path.

Some people were destined to be passing figures. He had long since learned to accept regret.

Back at the hotel, while Evelyn showered, Alexander quickly texted Emily Zade, demanding a full investigation into the forum organizers.

The information came swiftly—it was a pharmaceutical company he had once donated equipment to.

Alexander immediately contacted them for an invitation.

Though surprised, the company’s director, recalling that Mrs. Hamilton was a doctor, rushed to prepare two fresh invitations overnight.

By morning, the courier arrived.

Alexander handed the still-freshly-printed invitations to Evelyn, who had just finished dressing the baby.

"You’ll be returning to the hospital after the New Year. Opportunities like this are rare," he said, though it went against his true feelings. "Go if you want. Don’t worry about me."

Evelyn took the invitations, hesitating. "But what about the baby?"

"I’ll take care of her," Alexander said immediately. "If you’re okay with it, I can bring her along. The convention center is huge—we’ll just wander around."
###Chapter 748: Will We Still Be Friends?

The glass facade of the convention center glinted coldly under the winter sun.

Evelyn stood by the revolving door, watching Alexander deftly fold up the stroller. His charcoal-gray overcoat accentuated his tall, lean frame.

"There's a children's book fair upstairs," he said, cradling Baby Chloe in one arm while naturally taking Evelyn's bag with the other. "Perfect for broadening her horizons."

The baby giggled in his arms, tiny fingers clutching at his shirt collar.

Evelyn pressed her lips into a faint smile. The bustling crowd made her instinctively scan the area, but the familiar figure was nowhere in sight.

Alexander observed her expression discreetly, tapping his knuckles twice against the steering wheel. "There's formula and diapers in the trunk—enough for the whole day."

As the car descended into the underground garage, Evelyn's phone buzzed.

A colleague from the hospital had sent the forum schedule. While scrolling through it, she didn't notice Alexander's fleeting glance at the rearview mirror, his lips tightening slightly.

A long line snaked around the registration desk.

Alexander stood beside Evelyn with the stroller, drawing curious glances. A familiar doctor teased, "Dr. Carter, who's this—"

"Family," Evelyn replied smoothly, handing over her invitation without missing a beat.

A flicker of amusement crossed Alexander's eyes as he adjusted the baby's hat. He'd swapped his usual watch for a casual one today, sleeves rolled up twice, looking more relaxed than usual.

"I'm heading to the lecture," Evelyn checked her watch. "You—"

"Add me on WeChat?" Alexander already had his QR code pulled up. "More convenient than calling."

His profile picture had changed to a golden sunrise against a cerulean backdrop. Evelyn scanned it and hurried toward the auditorium, unaware that a long-dormant contact in her list had just lit up again.

The auditorium lights dimmed.

Evelyn settled into the third-to-last row, notebook open. The speaker adjusted the slides, dust motes floating in the projector's beam.

The seat beside her creaked softly.

Gregory sat diagonally behind her in a navy-blue sweater. The projector light traced the sharp lines of his profile.

"Long time no see," he murmured, careful not to disturb the attendees ahead.

Evelyn's pen paused. "How's White Coat?"

"Gained three pounds," Gregory chuckled. "The pet shop owner says he needs a diet now."

An empty seat between them served as an invisible boundary. Neither spoke again after the lecture began.

The crowd surged out like a tide when it ended.

Gregory waited at a corridor corner with two coffee cups. He tapped the side lightly when handing one to Evelyn. "Americano. No sugar."

"Thanks." She accepted the steaming cup.

They stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the plaza below. Alexander pushing the stroller flashed past, disappearing behind the fountain.

"I heard about the Leonard Laurent incident," Gregory said, gaze distant. "When Auntie Dempsey mentioned it, I nearly dropped my teacup."

Evelyn traced the cup's rim. "The wicked will reap what they sow."

Sunlight filtered through the glass, casting delicate shadows on her lashes. Gregory suddenly noticed a faint new crease at her eye corner—one that hadn't been there six months ago.

"Alexander has changed a lot," he blurted out.

Evelyn watched children playing in the plaza. "People change."

The words clicked like a key turning in a lock. Gregory's shoulders relaxed slightly as he studied his coffee's reflection. "Can... White Coat stay with me?"

"He sees you as his owner now," Evelyn smiled. "He only wags his tail at you during video calls."

Gregory's Adam's apple bobbed. "Then we—"

"Of course we're friends." Evelyn raised her cup, lightly clinking it against his. "Always will be."

Beyond the glass, Alexander peered their way with Baby Chloe in his arms. The baby waved her tiny hands like a flower swaying in sunlight.
###Chapter 749: Sweet Talk Comes Free

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Let's keep calling him White Coat then. Lately I've felt guilty—having a pet but not being able to spend enough time with him. Dogs need emotional bonds. Maybe he deserves a better home."

Gregory's eyes lit up. "Don't worry, I'll treat him like my own son. Visit whenever you miss him. Though..." He chuckled. "He's in that awkward phase now—looks more like a little monkey than a Samoyed."

He animatedly recounted White Coat's recent antics.

Seeing the shadows lift from his brow, Evelyn felt genuine happiness for him. As they parted, she said softly, "Thank you for sharing this. I should go now."

Gregory smiled openly. "Till next time."

When Evelyn returned to the main hall, Alexander and Baby Chloe were no longer in their seats. Remembering his earlier plans, she followed the signs.

She found them in the children's book illustration exhibit.

True to his word, Alexander had brought their infant daughter to the display. The little girl stared wide-eyed at the colorful artwork as he knelt on one knee, pointing at a picture book. "The bunny's first adventure outside, where he meets the lamb with a ribbon..."

His deep voice took on an unexpected gentleness weaving through the fairy tale, soon drawing a circle of children. The tiny audience barely reached his knees.

To ensure every child could hear, he remained crouched the entire time. When the story ended and he stood, his injured leg trembled visibly—still recovering from the fracture.

Evelyn stepped forward silently to steady him. Alexander's muscles tensed before relaxing at her touch. "How was the seminar?"

"Enlightening." She released his arm.

Alexander noted her eased expression, privately relieved his invitation had been worthwhile—until she added casually, "I ran into Gregory."

His jaw tightened.

Despite strategically waiting outside the venue with their daughter, his rival had still slipped through. Keeping his tone neutral, he remarked, "Dr. Wilson attended the lecture? At his level, I'd expect him to be the speaker."

Evelyn caught the implication and smiled, recalling Gregory's humility. "Medicine has no finish line. Even the brightest minds must keep learning."

To Alexander, it sounded like praise for Gregory's modesty. Jealousy soured his tongue, yet he forced civility. "Since you met, why not have lunch together?"

His mind already scheming how to intimidate the competition.

Evelyn shook her head. "We have other plans with Chloe this afternoon."

Alexander continued the charade. "Pity. I hoped he could give us a tour." Empty pleasantries cost nothing.

Noticing his clenched jawline, Evelyn couldn't resist teasing. "You're right—I'll call him back now." She pretended to reach for her phone.

Alexander's breath hitched. "He's...still nearby?" His voice strained.

Evelyn laughed. "Just kidding. We settled things—White Coat will stay with him. Closure for that chapter."

Relief crashed over Alexander like a wave, his lips almost betraying a smile. "You gave him the dog?"

"He was always Gregory's dog." Evelyn gazed into the distance. "He invested far more than I did."

Clean breaks all around.

Fireworks exploded in Alexander's chest. Barely containing his joy, he asked, "Would you want another dog someday?"

"No." Evelyn shook her head. "We have Osmanthus. Pets, like children, need attention. With my schedule, independent animals suit me better."

As Alexander prepared to extol feline virtues, a staff member approached. "Excuse me, would you like to join our family activity?"

Encouraged by his rare amiable expression, she enthused, "It's a reader engagement survey for children's books. Seeing you read to your daughter was so heartwarming—top scorers win a mystery prize!"
###Chapter 750: The Compatibility Test

The central lounge area of the mall had been temporarily converted into a survey site. Staff members enthusiastically greeted passing shoppers: "Welcome to our family relationship study! Complete the questionnaire for a chance to win exquisite gifts!"

Alexander Hamilton's gaze settled on the arranged tables and chairs. Several families were already seated—couples nestled together affectionately, parents with their children. He glanced down at the sleeping baby in the stroller, then turned to Evelyn Carter. "Shall we give it a try?"

Evelyn had meant to refuse. The three of them weren’t a real family, and participating in such a survey seemed inappropriate. But the hopeful glint in Alexander’s eyes made her nod before she could think better of it.

A staff member handed them two questionnaires but directed them to separate seats. "To ensure the authenticity of the survey, please answer independently."

Only then did Evelyn notice the other families were also seated apart. In most cases, the mothers tended to the children while the fathers sat nearby. She couldn’t help but smile wryly—this was just the societal norm.

Alexander, however, pushed the stroller to the other side without hesitation, standing out conspicuously among the cluster of mothers.

The questions caught Evelyn off guard. The first half was entirely about intimate partner details: the scene of their first meeting, favorite foods, daily habits... This wasn’t a family survey—it was a compatibility test for couples.

Flipping to the back, she understood the intention. Family atmosphere was undeniably tied to marital harmony. Only when parents shared a loving bond could children thrive.

The final section consisted of multiple-choice questions on parenting philosophies. Evelyn carefully considered each one and marked her answers, completing the questionnaire within the allotted time.

Alexander had already turned in his form and was chatting with other parents, exchanging childcare tips. His effortless charm made him seem like a natural-born father.

Unconsciously, Evelyn’s lips curved into a smile. As if sensing her gaze, Alexander immediately wrapped up his conversation and wheeled the stroller back to her.

"We should score high on this one," he said, a hint of pride in his voice.

Evelyn chuckled. "I’m afraid I’ll disappoint you. The final score averages both answers, and there were a few questions I couldn’t answer."

Alexander, captivated by her rare smile, couldn’t care less about the score. He was already contemplating whether to contact the organizers privately to arrange an additional prize.

The results were announced swiftly. To everyone’s surprise, the highest score went to this pair of "new parents."

"Congratulations!" the staff member beamed. "Who would’ve thought a newlywed couple would know each other best?"

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged a glance but didn’t correct the assumption. By now, they were used to being mistaken for a family.

But when they saw the prize, both froze. An entire box of children’s picture books, stacked taller than Alexander himself.

"Can these be mailed?" Evelyn blurted out, reciting the address of the Hamilton family estate. The words left her mouth before she realized how naturally they’d come. She was about to correct herself when Alexander gently stopped her.

"It’d be too troublesome to ship this many books to the apartment," he murmured, a trace of grievance in his tone. "Let’s just take them straight to the estate."

Evelyn didn’t object. Alexander had indeed shouldered most of the physical labor these past days, and she couldn’t bear to burden him further.

Before leaving, Alexander couldn’t resist asking, "That last question about having another child—what did you choose?"

He confessed first: "I picked ‘willing.’ More kids mean a livelier home."

The question held profound significance for them. The child they’d lost remained a shared wound in their hearts.

Evelyn’s gaze softened. "Me too."

Alexander’s throat moved, his voice trembling slightly. "Does this count as... being in sync?"
###Chapter 751 As Long as I Don't See the Ending, They're Still the Main Couple

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered slightly. She remained silent.

Alexander smiled gently, his gaze warm as he watched her. "Coming to the lecture this afternoon?"

"No." She leaned over to play with the baby in the stroller. "Any longer and she'll start fussing."

Her usually cool voice softened unconsciously when speaking to the child.

The baby babbled, stretching out tiny hands. "Mama... up..."

At just over a year old, she was at that age where words started forming.

No one had taught her to say "mama" or "papa." She'd picked it up somewhere on her own.

Evelyn's eyes suddenly burned.

If that other child had survived, they'd be calling her "mama" by now too.

Alexander's expression darkened, his Adam's apple bobbing. Before he could speak, the baby burst into tears.

"Hungry?" Evelyn checked immediately.

"Fed her half an hour ago." He glanced at his watch.

As Evelyn checked for uncomfortable clothing, her palm met dampness. "Did you change her diaper?"

Alexander rubbed his nose. "I had staff help."

Though the baby was young, he wasn't her biological father. Some things felt inappropriate.

Evelyn said nothing, grabbing diapers and clean clothes before heading to the nursing room. Returning, she chuckled. "The helper was a young woman, wasn't she?"

Alexander nodded.

"The diaper wasn't even fastened properly. Clearly never cared for a baby before." She smiled. "You'd have done better."

His lips parted, then closed.

He actually had learned to change diapers—practiced specifically for it. But mentioning that now would kill the mood.

"New clothes at the mall?" he suggested, tucking the soiled outfit into the stroller's storage compartment.

The once pampered young master now considered even these mundane details.

"Alright." Evelyn agreed readily.

Wet clothes were unbearable.

Alexander exhaled inwardly in relief. He led her familiarly to the mall's luxury boutiques.

Evelyn veered into a fast fashion store instead. "No need for expensive clothes while traveling with a baby."

Pushing the stroller after her, Alexander adapted seamlessly to this "supermarket" shopping style. After surviving small-town wholesale markets, nothing fazed him anymore.

Evelyn moved efficiently, selecting outfits within minutes. Alexander lagged behind deliberately, choosing a men's version from the same collection.

It was an anime collaboration—Evelyn's top featured the female lead, his the male lead.

"You're buying too?" Evelyn blinked. "Your clothes aren't dirty."

"Spares." He deadpanned, checking out swiftly.

When Evelyn emerged changed, Alexander immediately handed her the baby and changed himself.

Side by side, they looked every inch the picture-perfect couple.

"Didn't know you liked this anime," Evelyn remarked.

Alexander stiffened.

"Watched it as a kid." He stared at the graphic on his shirt, scrambling to recall the plot.

"It was serialized when I was in elementary school. Got too long later so I dropped it." Evelyn said. "Vivian followed every episode though—bought the full manga set."

Alexander's pulse quickened. "Did the main couple end up together?"

Evelyn's expression turned odd. "Sure you want to know?"

"Don't tell me it's a tragedy?" Dread pooled in his stomach.

"Not exactly." She chose her words carefully. "The male lead got with the second female lead. The female lead ended up with the second male lead. Vivian ranted about the terrible ending for three days straight."

Alexander stared at his shirt, the design suddenly glaring.

Was it too late to swap for the second male lead's version?

"Doesn't matter." He inhaled deeply. "As long as I don't see the ending, the main couple stays together forever."
###Chapter 752: The Art of Discouragement

The brief encounter was soon forgotten.

Alexander Hamilton drove Evelyn Carter and Baby Chloe to the pedestrian street recommended by Mr. Noodle. Recently viral online, this street had become a hotspot for influencers clamoring to take photos.

Evelyn wasn’t particularly interested in social media trends, but since they were here, she figured they might as well explore.

The street buzzed with even more energy than the night market, lined with unique shops.

Alexander bought a coconut, asking the vendor to open it and requesting two straws. "One is too much to finish alone. Sharing means we can try more drinks."

Sampling local flavors was essential to any trip.

Evelyn agreed. Noticing his hands were occupied with the stroller, she took the coconut. After a few awkward exchanges, Alexander suggested, "Just tilt it slightly."

She pushed his straw aside and lifted the coconut for him.

He leaned down to sip from her hands. The juice tasted sweeter than before.

Nearby, Gregory Wilson raised his hand to greet them but lowered it silently after witnessing the moment—until Alexander noticed him.

Truthfully, Alexander had spotted Gregory at the last intersection. He’d remained quiet, curious to see what the other man would do. Surprisingly, Gregory kept his distance, casually browsing shops, oblivious to Evelyn’s outfit change since noon.

The three finally met beneath an ornate archway.

Evelyn smiled. "Did the afternoon event end early?"

"I didn’t go." Gregory shrugged. "The morning lectures were professional, but the afternoon turned into a pharmaceutical sales pitch. You know how that goes."

His reasoning mirrored Evelyn’s own excuse for skipping the session. Though romance hadn’t worked out, their professional values aligned perfectly—a fact Alexander could never alter.

A weight settled in Alexander’s chest. Once, he’d held the title of husband. Now, he and Gregory stood on equal footing: both single, both with a chance.

The atmosphere grew tense. Evelyn shifted the topic. "Forum organizers don’t profit directly. It’s fair for them to seek revenue elsewhere—consider it funding for research."

Perspectives differed based on position. Her corporate experience had revealed truths she’d once overlooked. Profit drove every decision, even charity structured for tax benefits. True altruism rarely existed in business.

Gregory, raised in privilege, should’ve understood this better. Yet medicine had been his sole focus. Her mention of profits visibly startled him.

"You’re right. I was narrow-minded." He accepted her view with quiet surprise. "I remember you only cared about saving lives. Now you consider the bigger picture."

Evelyn hadn’t expected those words either. She smiled faintly. "Perhaps because I’ve learned healing doesn’t only happen in hospitals. Many lose hope long before they reach one."

Her perspective had expanded since returning from the mountain village.

Gregory, having moved on romantically, now admired her purely as a friend. "Hearing this makes me want to visit those villages myself."

Coddled since childhood, he’d never faced corporate intrigue—let alone harsh environments. In adaptability, he likely matched Alexander poorly.

Evelyn softened her refusal. "Mountain life is nothing like your study abroad trips. Even without friends overseas, you could video call."

Gregory frowned. "No phone service in the villages?"

Some experiences defied explanation to the uninitiated.

Before she could elaborate, Alexander interjected, "If you manage a video call on spotty 3G, the entire village will bow to you."

"When I collected evidence there, I tried sending digital files to save time. The signal was so bad, photos took ages to load—only to fail anyway."

Alexander detailed village hardships with clear intent: discouragement.

Evelyn listened quietly. Everything he said was true. Whenever Gregory glanced at her for confirmation, she nodded slightly.

"Reality is harsher than reports." Gregory’s remorse was genuine. "I only studied these issues academically. To think I dismissed real suffering—I’m ashamed."

His guilt held no pretense. He turned to Alexander abruptly. "I heard Hamilton Group is launching a foundation. Are donations open?"

The question caught Alexander off guard. He narrowed his eyes, assessing.

Long accustomed to Alexander’s hostility, Gregory met his gaze squarely. "I lack your resilience—I’d struggle in the villages. But I still want to help however I can."

Evelyn nearly confessed she’d gone to the mountains to escape grief, not out of nobility. But the words stuck in her throat.

When she’d lost Andrew Anderson, Alexander had been her anchor. No matter how empathetic Gregory was, he could never understand that pain.

Some truths remained unshareable.
###Chapter 753: I Know Myself

Sunlight dappled the cobblestone path through the trees.

Evelyn lowered her gaze slightly, her lashes casting delicate shadows. When she looked up, her voice was calm as still water. "I remember you mentioning the foundation and resort development were simultaneous projects?"

Alexander's eyes lingered on her face before he nodded. "Preparations have begun. The donation portal will open on the official website with detailed feedback for every contribution."

His tone was strictly professional, practically screaming "donate and leave" without words.

Gregory remained composed. "Noted."

The air grew thick with tension.

The trio moved forward in unspoken agreement. Evelyn walked beside Gregory while Alexander trailed half a step behind, pushing the stroller. From a distance, they could pass for a family of four.

A discarded coconut shell hit the trash bin with a hollow thud.

Gregory's back prickled with heat—no need to turn around to identify the source. He cleared his throat. "After this morning's presentation, I planned to tour the exhibition. Turns out it's entirely children-themed."

The remark seemed directed at Evelyn, yet equally served as explanation to Alexander.

Alexander's jaw tightened.

First the night market encounter, then the convention center, now this? In a city this size, what were the odds?

Gregory exhaled through his nose. "I'm leaving in three days. Might return to Hudson City after New Year's, or perhaps continue my studies."

Evelyn's fingers stilled momentarily. "Wishing you all the best."

She omitted her own plans to return to Central Hospital, unwilling to complicate matters.

"Thank you." Gregory's smile remained gentle.

Alexander absorbed every syllable until the polite detachment in Gregory's tone finally eased the tension in his shoulders.

He knew loss intimately—now guarding his treasure like a dragon fearing thieves.

At the street corner, Gregory paused. "I'll check out that heritage house ahead."

The protected building's quiet atmosphere clearly wasn't suited for infants.

"Goodbye." Evelyn understood.

Gregory waved without looking back—no lingering glances this time.

Alexander tracked his retreating figure, Adam's apple bobbing. "That was really coincidental?"

The question dripped with barely contained jealousy.

Evelyn wiped their baby's drool. "What else? Did you share our itinerary with him?"

Even the household staff hadn't known their exact destination—precaution against Vincent's interference.

"Absolutely not." Alexander's denial came swift.

"Then there's your answer." She readjusted the bib.

The baby gripped the stroller's edge, wide eyes sparkling. As Alexander adjusted the pillow, sunlight danced across Evelyn's profile.

Suddenly he asked, "Does he still have feelings for you?"

Instant regret.

Yet Evelyn remained eerily composed. "We don't miss each other after long separations. Does that sound like love?"

This wasn't reassurance—just exhaustion over pointless jealousy.

Alexander muttered, "You don't understand men."

"But I understand myself." Her gaze locked with his. "Just like I know it's time for the baby's feeding."

In the stroller, their little one smacked tiny lips hungrily.
###Chapter 754: Gentle Moments in Time

The cobblestone path of the ancient town wound through rows of quaint shops.

Evelyn Carter lingered by each storefront, her fingers lightly tracing the delicate handicrafts on display. She remembered she needed to pick gifts for Aunt Margaret and Sister Guixiang—each one had to be chosen with care.

Alexander Hamilton pushed the stroller, maintaining just the right distance behind her. His gaze softened as he watched her deliberate over each item.

"Man, you've got the patience of a saint," a weary-looking young man beside him remarked. "I've been standing here for almost two hours."

Alexander arched a brow. Dressed in a casual hoodie with strands of hair falling over his forehead, he looked much younger than his actual age.

"Used to it," he replied evenly.

The guy sighed enviously. "Your girlfriend's lucky. Mine shops like it's an endurance test—my legs are shaking."

A faint smile touched Alexander's lips. "I used to think shopping was tedious too."

"And then?"

"And then I got dumped."

The man's eyes widened. "Seriously? Over that?"

Alexander's gaze drifted to Evelyn, who was examining a pair of bracelets a few stalls away. "I was too young to appreciate things back then."

"So you two... got back together?" the guy pressed curiously.

Before Alexander could answer, a high-pitched voice interrupted.

"Babe, which one looks better?" The man's girlfriend held up two bracelets, tilting them in the sunlight.

Instantly, the guy plastered on a grin. "You look gorgeous in anything, sweetheart!"

Alexander shook his head wryly as the man scurried off.

"What are you looking at?" Evelyn approached, holding two neatly wrapped boxes.

"Just..." He paused. "Observing how young couples behave."

Following his line of sight, Evelyn chuckled. "Don't tell me you're taking notes."

"Just noticing," he said, taking the bags from her, "how some people care deeply but refuse to admit it."

She blinked. "That sounds familiar."

Alexander cleared his throat and nudged the stroller forward. "What did you pick for the aunts?"

"Pearl earrings." She lifted one of the boxes. "The quality here is exceptional."

As the sun dipped low, they settled at a riverside restaurant. Golden ripples shimmered on the water beyond the wooden lattice windows.

"Try this." Alexander placed a steamed dumpling on Evelyn's plate. "Beef filling."

She took a bite, her eyes closing briefly. "Tastes just like when I was little."

"Your dad..." he ventured carefully.

"He always said beef had a strange smell," she recalled with a smile. "But every birthday, he'd buy the freshest cut anyway."

Watching the ease in her expression, Alexander felt an invisible weight lift. Time had softened the pain, leaving only warmth in its wake.

"I hated carrots as a kid," he offered suddenly.

Evelyn looked up, surprised. "Really? I'd never have guessed."

"Auntie Marry tried everything to make me eat them." His voice held a note of nostalgia. "Finally figured out mincing them into beef filling worked best."

She laughed. "No wonder you love beef so much now."

"Some habits," he said quietly, "stick without you realizing."

Outside, the last rays of sunlight vanished beneath the river. Lanterns flickered to life along the ancient streets, their reflections dancing on the water.

Evelyn gazed at the distant lights and murmured, "Actually..."

"Hmm?"

"Teresa loved beef too." Her voice was soft but clear.

Alexander's chopsticks stilled. The lantern glow wavered in his eyes, bright then dim.
###Chapter 755: A Fateful Bond

Her voice trailed off, becoming almost inaudible.

Alexander Hamilton immediately realized their oversight—they'd forgotten to select pearl earrings for Teresa Taylor when choosing gifts for Grace Anderson and Margaret Hamilton.

After all, Anthony and Teresa had joined Grace and Margaret on their Southeast Asia trip.

Evelyn Carter had never met Teresa. In her heart, aside from her adoptive mother Grace, Margaret was the closest maternal figure she had. Missing one gift was understandable.

Yet, thinking of Teresa's guilt and care toward her, a pang of sorrow welled up inside.

She hated owing favors most of all.

Alexander abruptly stood. "Wait here."

Evelyn blinked. "Where are you going?"

His gaze was steady. "To buy another pair of pearl earrings. One for each of them."

He made it sound trivial, as if it were nothing.

Evelyn lowered her eyes. "It's about to rain. Let's go tomorrow—we're staying through the New Year anyway."

Since Andrew Anderson's passing, Anthony and Teresa had become increasingly attentive, embracing even Grace and Emily Anderson as family.

But Evelyn still felt an invisible barrier.

Alexander didn't insist. Instead, he asked gently, "Can you tell me how you truly feel about Anthony and Teresa now?"

Evelyn fell silent. Even as their food arrived, she couldn't find an answer.

Alexander waited patiently, serving her dishes, refilling her water, and tending to the baby. When the formula ran out, he handed over a warm bottle—a trick he'd learned from Auntie Marry.

"Raising a child isn't easy," he remarked casually. "I hear crawling and walking stages are the real challenges. Then comes the 'seven-eight nightmare phase'..."

Evelyn instantly understood his implication. She picked up a lettuce leaf. "I was seven or eight when I was adopted."

Alexander's breath hitched. Though he'd known about her past from Anthony, this was the first time she'd spoken of it herself.

"Anthony said you lost your memories after that fever. Have they returned?"

The lettuce was crisp, but Evelyn tasted only bitterness. She set down her chopsticks. "Not fully. But since meeting Anthony and Teresa, fragments keep surfacing... They love me, yet I don't know how to return to them."

Today was unusual—first running into Gregory Wilson, then this oversight, now long-buried memories resurfacing.

Was fate demanding she resolve all unfinished business today?

Evelyn smiled wryly, her eyes glistening. "If I could redo it all, I'd wish never to have met you at that blind date. Then I wouldn't have known Anthony and Teresa, nor learned I was adopted. The coincidences are... cruel."

Studying Alexander, a thought struck her: even a fateful bond was still a bond.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Do you regret meeting me? Even if you do, it's okay."

The pearl earrings had been his idea. Tonight, he'd either help her overcome this hurdle or be relegated to her past—just like Gregory.

Thinking he was jealous again, Evelyn pondered seriously. "No regrets."

Light rain began falling. Alexander pulled a compact umbrella from the stroller's base—just large enough for three.

As rain slanted sideways, he subtly tilted the umbrella toward Evelyn, letting his own back grow soaked.

Back in the car, Evelyn noticed his drenched sweatshirt but said nothing.

He never sought credit for such small gestures.

Despite his sharp memory, Alexander took a detour, stopping at the old town's lone auto lane.

Evelyn frowned in confusion.

He explained softly, "You're right—the past can't change, but we still have choices now. Give me a moment."

The umbrella opened and closed. When he returned, a delicate gift box was in his hand.
###Chapter 756: The Art of Rituals

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she opened the velvet jewelry box.

Inside lay a pair of pearl earrings, nearly identical to the ones she'd lingered over at the boutique.

"You actually bought these..." Her voice was barely audible. "I hesitated so long at the counter that day. The luster felt familiar, but I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before."

Alexander stood beside her, his gaze tenderly tracing the pink flush on her earlobes. He didn't mention how these pearls perfectly mirrored the ones Teresa used to wear in her youth.

The Lunar New Year arrived faster than expected.

In previous years, the Anderson home would be filled with the aroma of Grace's handmade dumplings. Andrew would hang spring couplets in the living room while Emily pastied upside-down "福" characters on every door.

This New Year's Eve, Alexander whisked her away to a coastal city in the south.

"We're back." Evelyn froze in the hotel doorway.

The formerly minimalist suite had transformed. Intricate paper cuttings adorned the floor-to-ceiling windows. Two crimson lanterns glowed on the coffee table. Even the throw pillows now bore golden embroidered blessings.

"Like it?" Alexander cradled their sleeping baby behind her.

"When did you arrange this?" She traced a lifelike koi fish papercut on the window frame.

"The night before last while you were putting her to sleep." He settled the infant into her crib. "The manager said it was their first custom Lunar New Year decoration request."

Under the food warmer, their reunion dinner still steamed. Crystal shrimp dumplings neighbored sweet-and-sour fish. Blanched greens shared the tray with braised meatballs. At the center, a clay pot kept seafood congee warm.

Evelyn lifted the lid, breathing in the rising aroma. "This is—"

"I had the kitchen prepare it Hudson-style." Alexander poured warmed rice wine. "We may not be home, but the flavors should be."

As the New Year's Gala hosts counted down on TV, fireworks exploded across the night sky. Evelyn stood before the window, colored lights dancing in her eyes.

"Happy New Year." Alexander appeared beside her unnoticed.

Their reflections shimmered in the glass, illuminated by pyrotechnics. Evelyn gently clinked her glass against his. "Happy New Year."

On their return flight the fourth day, their daughter pressed against the window, marveling at cloud oceans. Watching Hudson's skyline emerge, Evelyn murmured, "This wasn't a bad way to celebrate."

Alexander paused mid-diaper change to meet her gaze.

"At least we avoided all those aunts asking when we'll have another." She accepted a wet wipe, lips curving slightly.

Hamilton Manor's red lanterns swayed in dusk's breeze when they returned. Peanut leapt from the cat tree, tail erect, winding twice around Evelyn's ankles before sniffing the sleeping infant.

"She remembers us." Evelyn scratched under the Ragdoll's chin.

Hauling luggage inside, Alexander noticed new koi in the curio cabinet's aquarium. "Auntie Wu bought them before leaving. For 'abundance every year.'"

That night, Evelyn stood on the bedroom balcony. Breezes brushed her new pearls, their luster soft in moonlight. Her phone lit up with Teresa's message:

"The earrings suit you."

Fingering the smooth surfaces, she suddenly remembered—years ago, that always-smiling woman's earlobes had shimmered with this same glow.
###Chapter 757: Your Attitude Won't Influence My Decision

Alexander Hamilton frowned slightly. "Peanut is still an animal. Could there be risks with the baby around?"

Evelyn Carter looked up at him. "Has Peanut been vaccinated?"

"Of course." His gaze softened. "Vaccines, deworming, baths—nothing was missed. My mother handled everything personally."

Margaret Hamilton had doted on Peanut like a child during her solitary years. Now the cat was utterly spoiled.

The corners of Evelyn's lips lifted as she imagined Peanut's fur puffing up during bath time. "Then there's no issue. Many families keep pets away from children due to hygiene concerns, but Peanut has always been indoors. That's not a problem here."

Alexander mentally filed away this parenting knowledge. Though Auntie Wu was experienced, some perspectives needed updating.

A phone ringtone interrupted.

It was Olivia Lightfoot calling.

Evelyn answered immediately. Alexander continued entertaining the baby and Peanut, but his ears subtly perked up.

"Dr. Carter!" Olivia's voice brimmed with energy. "We'll see you next Monday! Your office is ready, nameplate hung—just waiting for your return!"

Evelyn instinctively glanced at Alexander, her eyes complex. She owed him gratitude, yet he'd instructed the dean not to inform her.

Alexander敏锐地察觉到她的目光，转头时却只看到她专注地看着宝宝。

"The application is submitted, but adjusting to work rhythms might take time. I'll need your help then," Evelyn said gently.

Olivia agreed readily. "No problem! By the way, how's your presentation prep? The dean says you're the hospital's pride!"

Evelyn sighed inwardly. The case resolution wasn't primarily her功劳, but for the dean's reputation, she had to accept the credit.

"Haven't started writing yet, but I do have thoughts on rural healthcare disparities. Worst case, I'll share work experiences—it's all among colleagues anyway."

She planned to retreat to the study and draft after resting.

Olivia's next words stunned her.

"Don't worry, Dr. Wilson is presenting too. His topic is Sino-foreign medical developments—definitely less接地气 than yours."

Alexander's back straightened instantly. At "Dr. Wilson," his ears practically twitched.

Even Peanut tilted its head at his reaction.

Alexander clenched his fists, resisting the urge to snatch the phone.

Evelyn hesitated. "Which...Dr. Wilson?"

"Anesthesiology's Dr. Wilson." Olivia sounded puzzled. "You've collaborated on many surgeries. Did something happen?"

The hospital knew nothing of Gregory Wilson's past pursuit of Evelyn, assuming they were merely colleagues.

Evelyn denied quickly. "No. I just didn't expect his return. With his credentials, UK hospitals should be competing for him..."

After their N市 encounter, she assumed Gregory would deliberate longer. His quiet return surprised her.

Perhaps this was better. Only the guilty avoided confrontation.

Clearly, Gregory had truly moved on.

"Having such an excellent anesthesiologist benefits patients," she said evenly.

Olivia disagreed. "Our hospital is outstanding too! His return is the logical choice!"

"Right, right." Evelyn hastily praised the hospital, avoiding misunderstandings.

After hanging up, Alexander's expression cycled through emotions.

A miscalculation!

He'd just removed Gregory from his watchlist—now he had to reinstate him. His conflicted gaze lingered on Evelyn, words trapped in his throat.

Evelyn said coolly, "Heard everything? Ask whatever you want."

Alexander's face shifted through shades before forcing out: "Gregory's career choices are his own. I won't interfere. Your happiness matters most."

The words stabbed his heart. Imagining Gregory working alongside Evelyn daily made him want to demolish the hospital.

But to avoid appearing controlling, he white-knuckled his restraint.

Evelyn blinked. "Doesn't that hurt?"

He inhaled deeply. "No."

She called his bluff directly. "Your knuckles are pale. Don't pretend magnanimity if it pains you—I'm used to it anyway. Your attitude won't sway my decisions, especially not this one."
###Chapter 758 Holding Her Hand

Evelyn Carter knew Alexander Hamilton had been instrumental in helping her this time. But giving up her hospital career for him? Absolutely not.

Alexander unclenched his fist, wincing at the stinging crescent-shaped marks on his palm where his nails had dug in. Tiny beads of blood welled up.

"You're too hard on yourself." Evelyn retrieved the first aid kit from the coffee table drawer, expertly disinfecting his wounds. "These may be minor, but they'll sting when wet. Don't do this again."

The antiseptic solution spread cool relief across his skin. Alexander felt the tension in his shoulders ease.

"There's a backlog at the office. I'll need to start tomorrow." He paused. "But don't worry—I've had Emily Zade deliver the files here. You can review your medical literature in the study. I'll take care of Baby Chloe."

He'd cleared most urgent matters before their trip. Yet as CEO of Hamilton Group, the mountain of pending decisions never stopped growing.

Warmth bloomed in Evelyn's chest. "Baby Chloe was entrusted to both of us by Miss Langley. It's not fair for you to shoulder everything alone. Let's take turns until Auntie Wu returns from vacation and our mothers are back home."

The converted greenhouse study was peaceful, just one floor below his office. The baby could easily alternate between both spaces.

Tucking a loose strand behind her ear, Evelyn exhaled. "We'll take it slow."

As Alexander reached for the used cotton swab, his fingertips brushed the back of her hand.

The trash bin sat inches away.

Evelyn could've simply leaned past him to discard it. In that suspended moment of hesitation, Alexander's hand closed around hers—an impulse he couldn't explain.

Both froze.

The last time they'd touched like this was during that frantic escape in the village.

Alexander's pulse hammered against his ribs. The cuts on his palm throbbed, bracing for her to pull away.

An unspoken agreement held them motionless, as if spellbound.

Peanut the Ragdoll cat leapt from the sofa, his fluffy tail swishing against their ankles like a teasing paintbrush.

Any movement now would shatter the fragile pretense.

Their locked eyes spoke volumes in the thickening silence.

Then came the metallic jingle of keys at the front door.

Margaret Hamilton and Grace Anderson's laughter floated in, followed by Teresa Taylor's occasional murmurs:

"...The seaside was breathtaking, though I never learned to swim..."
"We could take lessons..."
"Not for me—this sun gave me such a headache..."

Teresa's words cut off abruptly. Her eyes widened at the sight of Evelyn springing up from the couch. "Evelyn? You're back already?"

Evelyn hadn't expected their return. She stood mechanically, mind blank.

Alexander swiftly withdrew his hovering hand.

"We just got home," Evelyn managed, forcing calm into her voice.

He rose to greet them. "Why cut your trip short?"

Margaret beamed. "No place compares to home. We've agreed to take more outings together."

Grace studied her daughter's flushed face. "Are you unwell?"

"Just tired." Evelyn deftly redirected. "Alexander had it worse—driving, handling luggage, caring for the baby, plus work tomorrow."

Noticing her son's faint smile, Margaret understood instantly. As she searched for an excuse to usher the others away, Anthony Taylor and Emily Anderson barged in, arms laden with shopping bags.
###Chapter 759: My Wife

Anthony Taylor was busy directing the servants with the luggage, leaving him no time for anything else.

Emily Anderson spotted Evelyn Carter and immediately rushed over like an excited little bird, clinging tightly to her sister. "Evelyn! Thank goodness you pushed me to learn English—it came in so handy abroad..."

Seeing her younger sister's animated expression, Evelyn felt her own reservations gradually melt away.

"I knew you'd do well," Evelyn said with a smile, pulling a carefully prepared gift from her suitcase. "Here, this is for you."

She handed Emily a box of Southern-style pastries and a pressed flower collection from the region.

Emily's eyes lit up as she accepted the gifts, but when she noticed Alexander Hamilton watching Evelyn with a fond smile, she couldn't resist teasing. "Evelyn, did you pick these out alone, or...?"

"Don't like them?" Evelyn arched a brow. "I can always swap them for medical journals—perfect for your pre-study sessions."

Emily immediately ducked behind Grace Anderson, not daring to say another word.

Evelyn proceeded to distribute gifts to the elders. Margaret Hamilton and Grace were delighted, but Teresa Taylor's reaction was the most touching.

"This... is really for me?" Teresa's voice trembled, her eyes glistening.

Evelyn shifted slightly, but the tears in her birth mother's gaze softened her heart. "I hope you like it." She then retrieved an elegant wallet. "And this is for Mr. Taylor."

She and Alexander had scoured all of N City to find it. Having no idea what Anthony might prefer, she'd relied entirely on Alexander's input.

Anthony accepted the wallet, his fingers trembling with emotion. "This is the first gift I've ever received from my daughter... I'll start using it right away!"

The paternal love once squandered on Annabelle Taylor had finally found its rightful recipient. Evelyn felt something icy within her begin to thaw.

Alexander, observing this, suggested they all have dinner together. Since the house wasn't prepared, he simply ordered catering from a hotel.

Soon, it was the ninth day of the new year.

Over these days, the two of them had taken turns caring for Baby Chloe, helping the little one adjust to being with other family members. On Evelyn's first day back at work, the baby was surprisingly well-behaved—it was Evelyn who struggled to part with her.

Alexander used the excuse of testing the baby's adaptability to insist on driving Evelyn to the hospital. When they said goodbye, both wore identical expressions of concern.

"We're only apart for a few hours," Evelyn sighed. "What are we going to do when Miss Liang returns?"

"I've already thought about it," Alexander said firmly. "No matter what, we're going to be her godparents."

He emphasized the word "we."

Evelyn's mood lightened slightly. Once back in her office, she threw herself into work. During the first-day briefing, she found herself seated next to Gregory Wilson.

Gregory joked, "When I heard you were returning today, I braced myself for Alexander's interrogation. Surprisingly, he's been unusually restrained this time."

"He did mention it," Evelyn replied, unaware of the unconscious shift in her tone. "But he's better now. He said it's your choice."

Gregory smiled knowingly. "I'm from Hudson City, after all. It's time I settled down. The Central Hospital gave me my start—I can't forget that." He paused. "Could you... pass that along to him?"

Thinking of Alexander's jealousy, the two shared a laugh.

Evelyn's presentation was particularly successful. When she mentioned the Hamilton Group's charity project, the audience responded enthusiastically. Only afterward did she realize she'd inadvertently advertised for Alexander.

She dialed his number.

"Evelyn?" He answered instantly.

"Did I... interrupt something?"

"Not at all. Go ahead."

She briefly explained the situation.

"We were just discussing this project," Alexander said, amusement in his voice. "Want to listen in?"

"You're in a meeting?" Evelyn was startled.

"Mhm."

"Then I shouldn't—"

"Afraid of what?" His low chuckle sent warmth through the line. "You're a major shareholder. My personal seal is in your hands."

"...Just focus on your work!"

Before hanging up, she faintly heard someone ask, "Your lover?"

"My wife."
###Chapter 760: The Helping Hand

Lunch break arrived. Evelyn Carter organized her medical charts and prepared to head to the cafeteria. As she pushed open the department door, a familiar figure caught her eye.

Alexander Hamilton stood in the hallway holding a thermal lunchbox, his presence starkly noticeable among the pregnant women and their families.

"What are you doing here?" Evelyn's eyes widened slightly.

The nurses at the station giggled behind their hands, one even winking at her.

"Didn't want you eating hospital food." Alexander lifted the container. "Private kitchen today. Emily's recommendation—tasted it myself. Quite good."

Evelyn glanced at the cafeteria card tucked in her white coat pocket. "Weren't you supposed to have a video conference?"

"Rescheduled." His expression remained unreadable. "Meetings can wait. Lunch with you can't."

His blunt words left her momentarily speechless, her ears warming. Since their trip, he'd become increasingly articulate.

Once inside her office, Alexander deftly unpacked the three-tiered lunchbox. The aroma of sweet and sour ribs immediately filled the space, accompanied by stir-fried seasonal vegetables and a small bowl of yam soup.

"When did you prepare all this?" Evelyn stared at the lavish spread.

"Had the driver pick it up this morning." He handed her chopsticks. "Eat while it's hot."

As she lifted a rib, Alexander produced a thermos like a magician.

"Red date and longan tea. Good for digestion."

Evelyn cradled the warm cup, the sweet fragrance enveloping her. She took a careful sip, warmth spreading from her throat to her stomach.

"Good?" His gaze never wavered.

"Mhm." She nodded, her lips curving involuntarily.

For days afterward, Alexander arrived without fail—sometimes with Cantonese dim sum, other times Japanese bento. Once, he even brought an entire hotpot setup, setting up an electric cooker in her office.

"Here comes the Helping Hand with lunch again!" The nurses had coined him a nickname.

Olivia Lightfoot nearly doubled over laughing. "Dr. Carter, Mr. Hamilton's spoiling you rotten!"

Evelyn pretended not to hear as she organized charts, though the lingering warmth of ginger tea in her thermos served as a quiet reminder.

"So you two are..." Olivia trailed off meaningfully.

Evelyn's hands stilled. "We're just—"

A shrill phone call interrupted. The ER reported a multi-car accident with an injured pregnant woman requiring immediate surgery.

Evelyn stood abruptly, her white coat swirling.

"Water broke? Blood pressure?" She strode toward the emergency room, firing off questions.

The patient lay pale-faced, gripping the stretcher sheets. Examination revealed placental abruption—worse than expected. Immediate surgery was critical.

"Family? We need consent."

"Husband's in critical care. Can't reach other relatives," a nurse said urgently.

Evelyn made the call. "Prep the OR. I'll lead."

She moved swiftly—scrubbing in, gowning, gloving—her motions fluid. As the OR doors swung open, she saw the anesthesiologist already in position—

It was Gregory Wilson.
###Chapter 761: A Long Wait

Gregory Wilson's expression remained composed when he saw Evelyn Carter.

He had always known her medical expertise would make her stand out even at a top-tier hospital like Central Medical Center.

They exchanged a knowing glance before immediately shifting into professional mode.

The pregnant patient's records were quickly retrieved.

"Placental abruption with severe blood loss. Emergency C-section required," Evelyn stated calmly, scanning the test results.

A weak plea came from the hospital bed. "Doctor... please save my baby..."

Tear tracks streaked the woman's pale face as her fingers feebly gripped the sheets.

Evelyn removed her gloves and grasped the patient's icy hand. "Trust me. You and your baby will both be fine."

As anesthesia took effect, the woman's eyelids fluttered before Gregory's precise administration rendered her unconscious.

The operating lights remained illuminated for six grueling hours.

When Evelyn emerged cradling the premature infant weighing barely five pounds, only a bespectacled young man waited anxiously in the hallway.

"The baby's stable but requires incubation," Evelyn informed the nurse before turning to the man. "Are you family?"

He wiped his sweaty forehead. "Just a friend. The father's still in ICU..." His voice cracked with emotion.

Evelyn interrupted gently. "We need supplies for mother and child. Can you contact other relatives?"

"I'll handle it!" The man nearly collided with the wall in his haste to leave.

Back in surgery, Evelyn guided Olivia Lightfoot through suturing techniques.

"Dr. Carter, we couldn't have done this without you," Olivia's muffled voice admitted through her mask. "My first time handling such complexity."

Evelyn adjusted monitor settings. "Teamwork matters more."

By shift's end, midnight had passed.

Exhausted staff slumped against locker room walls, sipping glucose solutions.

Gregory recovered first. Returning freshly changed, he announced, "Torrential rain outside."

"No umbrella!" Olivia groaned, shooting Evelyn a pleading look.

Evelyn checked her phone—no messages.

"Share a ride?" she suggested.

Gregory volunteered, "I'll drive you."

In the hospital lobby, Evelyn froze at a familiar silhouette.

Alexander Hamilton sat alone in the vacant waiting area, a black umbrella resting beside him.

"You should've told me you were coming," Evelyn approached him.

Alexander stood, his gaze lingering on her face. "The nurses said you were in surgery."

His fingers lightly traced the mask indentations on her cheeks. "Tired?"

"Successful delivery," Evelyn's eyes brightened. "A healthy baby girl."

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "You always perform miracles."

Evelyn shook her head. "Credit goes to the team."

She glanced back at her colleagues.

Alexander's gaze traveled past her, locking with Gregory's in a silent confrontation.

"Dr. Wilson," Alexander's voice turned glacial.

Gregory nodded evenly. "Mr. Hamilton."
###Chapter 762: She's Always Been Self-Sufficient

Alexander Hamilton's gaze burned holes into Gregory Wilson's back.

"There was a multi-car accident nearby today. All senior anesthesiologists are handling critical cases." Gregory remained unflappable, as if oblivious to the tension. "I'm just filling in."

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "Don't be modest, Dr. Wilson. Everyone knows your reputation after that medical forum where you impressed the keynote speaker."

Olivia Lightfoot stood between them, her spine prickling with discomfort. She forced a conciliatory tone: "Mr. Hamilton, are you here to pick up Dr. Carter?"

Instantly, she regretted speaking. Alexander's stare turned colder than the storm outside.

"We should go." Evelyn Carter intervened, giving Olivia a meaningful look. "You two head home too."

Olivia practically dragged Gregory toward the parking garage like a reprieved prisoner.

Alexander nodded at Olivia. "Drive safely." His gaze deliberately skipped over Gregory.

Evelyn exhaled in exasperation. The man's pettiness knew no bounds.

She noticed the umbrella Alexander had set aside, its tip still dripping. Some things never changed.

"Let's go." Alexander took the umbrella. "Grace will worry."

Mention of her mother softened Evelyn's expression. Since moving back to the family home, Grace Anderson waited up nightly for her return.

"I called Grace." Alexander opened the umbrella. "Told her you had surgery tonight."

Rainwater pooled ankle-deep across the hospital courtyard. Alexander crouched at the steps. "I'll carry you."

"That's not—"

"Better one pair of wet shoes than two." He thrust the umbrella at her. "Hold this."

Evelyn wrapped her arms around his neck. His broad shoulders radiated warmth, reminiscent of childhood rides on her father's back.

The car waited in the deepest puddle. Alexander deposited her safely in the passenger seat before jogging through the downpour to the driver's side.

Only a single nightlight glowed in the Hamilton residence.

Alexander changed into loungewear and headed straight for the kitchen. "Hungry? I'll make noodles."

"Since when do you care about stomach health?" Evelyn arched a brow. "You're the one with chronic gastritis."

"Exactly." He cracked an egg with practiced ease. "I know how much it hurts. Wouldn't wish that on you."

A realization struck her. "Have you been waiting since afternoon?"

"Just caught up on work." His tone was casual. "No big deal."

Evelyn studied him quietly.

"You don't need to do this." Her voice softened. "I can take care of myself."

Self-reliance had always been her default setting.

Alexander dropped noodles into boiling water. "I know. But I want to." Steam curled around his gentle smile. "If it bothers you, I'll just wait at the hospital entrance next time."
###Chapter 763: A Friend of Mine

Alexander's slender fingers deftly separated the baby bok choy, the crisp sound of leaves rustling between them. He gripped the kitchen knife, chopping scallions on the cutting board with practiced ease. Though not quite professional chef level, his skills surpassed most home cooks.

Who would've thought the CEO who once avoided kitchens could now handle ingredients so proficiently?

Evelyn rolled up her sleeves to help, but Alexander stopped her. "You just finished a long surgery. Your hands need rest." He gestured to the simmering pot. "I learned how to make noodle soup from Auntie Wu. Try it."

Outside, rain pattered against the window. A steaming bowl of noodles was perfect for chasing away the chill. Her stomach growled in agreement—glucose could replenish energy but couldn't satisfy hunger.

As the noodles boiled, Alexander handed her a cup of red date tea. "Made with your favorite brand. Added longan and goji berries."

The warm cup gradually melted the cold from her fingertips.

When the noodles were served, a golden poached egg rested atop them, the aroma of sesame oil wafting up. Evelyn took a sip of the broth and suddenly looked up. "This isn't Auntie Wu's recipe, is it?"

"I learned it from Auntie Grace." Alexander's ears tinged pink. "Thought you'd prefer your mom's version. But I only mastered the basics. Once I learn the toppings—"

"This is perfect." Evelyn cut him off. "It has your touch."

Alexander lowered his head to eat, but the corners of his mouth lifted slightly. The warmth he'd once taken for granted, he'd circled so far to finally appreciate.

At least it wasn't too late.

......

The next morning, Evelyn nearly overslept. The previous day's surgery had drained her completely. She only stirred when Alexander carried the baby in to wake her.

"You don't have clinic hours this morning. Want to sleep more?" His voice was soft.

Evelyn rubbed her eyes. "I need to check on the post-op patient."

Cold water splashed on her face chased away the drowsiness. She studied Alexander's dark circles in the mirror. "You're the one who should take leave and rest."

Fresh from the shower, water still dripped from his hair. He absently pushed it back. "At my busiest, I worked fifteen-hour days. This is nothing."

It was the first time Evelyn had heard him mention work. She gave him a second glance. "With your stamina, it's a shame you didn't become a doctor."

"Hmm?"

"Doctors need brains, but even more endurance. Especially orthopedic surgeons—they're all fitness buffs." Her eyes skimmed over him. "But at your age now, you should still prioritize rest."

Alexander's expression froze.

After dropping Evelyn at the hospital, he sat in his office, lost in thought. Whispers floated from the secretarial pool:

"Mr. Hamilton looks awful today."
"Did a project go wrong?"
"Seems more like relationship trouble..."

Emily knocked and entered. After her report, she cautiously asked, "Sir, is there an issue with the proposal?"

"No." Alexander massaged his temples. "A friend of mine is having some trouble."

Emily nodded knowingly. "Relationship problems?"
###Chapter 764: I'll Try to Restrain Myself

Alexander Hamilton was known for his decisive nature in business, never hesitating to make tough calls. Yet now, he sat in his office, brows slightly furrowed, looking every bit like a lovestruck teenager.

"Suppose so," he cleared his throat, adjusting his cuffs with feigned composure. "A friend of mine is a few years older than his girlfriend. Recently, she mentioned he's 'not getting any younger.' What does that mean?"

Emily Zade stifled a laugh. If anyone else had asked this, she'd analyze the underlying meaning. But with Alexander, the answer was glaringly obvious.

"Mr. Hamilton, your friend's girlfriend likely meant it literally. After thirty, one really should focus on self-care. I speak from experience."

She knew Dr. Carter too well—that straightforward, no-nonsense personality. Alexander was overthinking this out of concern.

He nodded thoughtfully. "Understood."

After a pause, he added, as if to cover his tracks, "I'll relay that to my friend."

Emily tactfully played along and returned to her work.

At the hospital, Evelyn Carter had just finished her rounds.

The family of yesterday's placental abruption patient waited at the corridor corner, thrusting a thick red envelope toward her.

"Dr. Carter, we can't thank you enough!"

Evelyn sidestepped. "Saving lives is my duty. Use that for the baby's formula—preemies need special care."

Seeing her firm stance, the family reluctantly pocketed the envelope but continued thanking her profusely.

These moments always drained her more than surgery. She unscrewed her thermos, and the sweet aroma of red date tea instantly soothed her frayed nerves.

How did he manage this? Preparing the tea daily without fail, even the temperature perfectly calibrated.

At noon sharp, Alexander appeared in the doctor's office. He greeted every staff member with ease, as if he were an honorary hospital member.

Watching his effortless charm, Evelyn recalled yesterday's tense standoff between him and Gregory Wilson and massaged her temples.

"Asparagus with ham, plum-glazed ribs, and your favorite crab with rice cakes." He laid out the containers. "You didn't sleep well—eat more to recharge."

Emily's advice had helped him accept his "not getting any younger" status. But so what? A thirty-year-old man's attentiveness was leagues beyond some greenhorn's.

He produced two more thermoses. "The red date tea might not be enough. Brought coffee and pu-erh."

Evelyn arched a brow. "With learning skills like yours, you'd make a fine doctor if you switched careers."

His eyes crinkled with amusement. "I'll learn anything you need."

As he turned to leave as usual, she called out, "There's something I want to discuss."

"Go ahead." He didn't hesitate.

"Could you be more civil to Dr. Wilson?" She met his gaze. "We're just colleagues now."

Alexander's smile froze.

"...I'll try." He inhaled deeply. "But he did pursue you. Almost succeeded."

That thorn still lodged in his heart.

Evelyn sighed. "There are plenty of wonderful women out there. Why must he fixate? We've settled things. If he finds someone, I'll be the first to congratulate him."

A glint flashed in Alexander's eyes—an idea forming.

"You're right." He nodded slowly. "I'll mind my manners."

She relaxed. Friendship wasn't expected; she just didn't want awkwardness.

"Then it's settled." She took a sip of coffee.

Noticing her faintly flushed ears, Alexander murmured, "I'll try to restrain myself."
###Chapter 765: Wishing You Happiness in Advance

The curtains in Evelyn's office were half-drawn, casting dappled sunlight across the floor. Alexander sat on the corner sofa, his gaze lingering on her sleeping profile. Her breathing was even, her lashes casting delicate shadows on her cheeks.

He rose quietly and readjusted the slipping blanket over her shoulders.

The early spring wind still carried a chill.

In the hallway, Alexander had just closed the door when he ran into Gregory. The doctor, with a pen tucked in his white coat pocket, nodded at him. "Mr. Hamilton."

Alexander's jaw tightened as he gave a curt acknowledgment.

"You've been visiting quite often lately," Gregory remarked, adjusting his glasses.

"Hmm."

Whispers floated from the nurses' station. A few young nurses peeked around, their eyes darting between the two men. Alexander's recent behavior was nothing like the cold-hearted ex-husband from the rumors.

"Care to talk?" Gregory gestured toward the side door.

Outside the outpatient building, cherry blossom trees were just sprouting tender buds. Alexander cut straight to the point. "You still have feelings for her."

Gregory let out a bitter laugh. "Can't hide anything from you." He removed his glasses to clean them. "I meant it when I said I've moved on, but the feelings are still there. The way she stands at the operating table—who wouldn't be captivated?"

Alexander's fingers twitched slightly.

"Too bad I'm not the one in her eyes." Gregory put his glasses back on, his gaze clear behind the lenses. "Wishing you happiness in advance."

His white coat billowed slightly as he turned away.

Evelyn noticed that Alexander had started nodding at Gregory when they crossed paths. Though still distant, it was better than the previous tension. Her steps lightened as she made her rounds.

"Dr. Carter, you seem in high spirits today?" a pregnant patient on the bed asked with a smile.

Evelyn touched her cheek. "Must be the good test results." She flipped open the medical chart. "Your baby can leave the incubator this afternoon."

The woman's eyes instantly welled up. "Thank you... We almost..." Her husband had broken three ribs in a car accident, and she had nearly miscarried.

"Fortune follows survival," Evelyn said softly.

That afternoon, she personally wheeled the incubator to the ward. The premature baby, born at seven months, slept soundly with rosy cheeks and tiny clenched fists.

"200 grams heavier than last week," Evelyn said as she handed the baby to the mother.

The new mother trembled as she took her child. "We couldn't even visit her once..." Tears fell onto the infant's swaddle.

Evelyn's chest tightened. She thought of the child she had lost and blurted out, "At least you can still hold her..."

Regret followed the words immediately.

"You have a child too?" the mother asked in surprise.

"Divorced. The baby..." Evelyn's throat constricted. "Didn't make it."

The room fell into silence.

"I'm so sorry!" the woman stammered. "Um... I have a friend who works at a pharmaceutical company. He's got great prospects..."

An image flashed through Evelyn's mind—Alexander that morning, bringing her breakfast, a coffee stain on his cuff. She shook her head. "Too busy with work."

"Just one meeting!" the woman pressed eagerly. "He's actually coming to the hospital tomorrow..."

Footsteps echoed in the hallway. Alexander appeared at the doorway, arms full of documents, his gaze settling on Evelyn's slightly flushed ears.
###Chapter 766: Strictly Business

Evelyn Carter maintained a professional smile as her patient enthusiastically chatted about personal matters. The woman kept probing into Evelyn's private life before bluntly offering to set her up.

"Dr. Carter, my nephew works in healthcare too—an outstanding young man..."

Evelyn couldn't outright refuse. She planned to add the contact first and politely decline later. That same evening, a friend request appeared.

The profile picture unmistakably belonged to that flustered pharmaceutical rep she'd seen outside the OR earlier. Evelyn arched an eyebrow. The man seemed like a complete greenhorn, lacking even basic professionalism.

"Hello Dr. Carter, I'm Liam Macmillan from Meditech Pharmaceuticals."

His direct approach actually relieved her. She immediately replied, "Apologies, but I'm not currently interested in dating."

"Understood," came the swift response. "Actually, I wanted to introduce our newly developed cesarean surgical stapler."

Now intrigued, Evelyn engaged. While staplers were common, models specifically modified for postpartum needs were rare.

"Do you have detailed specifications?" Her fingers flew across the screen. "Final purchasing decisions rest with the department—I'll need substantial data to convince them."

Their discussion grew increasingly technical. So absorbed was Evelyn that she didn't notice Alexander Hamilton emerging from the shower.

"Seems the baby's adjusting well," his sudden comment startled her into nearly dropping the phone.

She glared. "Walking silently—trying to give someone a heart attack?"

Alexander glanced at the peacefully sleeping infant in the bassinet. "You seemed engrossed. Hospital business?"

"Pharmaceutical rep." Evelyn didn't look up. "Scheduled a weekend product demo."

Alexander hesitated, then simply said, "I'll be working in the study. Don't stay up too late."

Since the baby began sleeping through the night, they'd resumed separate bedrooms—Evelyn in the master suite with the child, Alexander in the converted study.

Late that night, getting water, Evelyn noticed light still glowing under the study door. She hovered momentarily before approaching.

Through the door, Alexander's icy tone carried clearly: "...Acquire outright. If they refuse, initiate price wars."

"...They'll beg to sell their shares once bankrupt."

"Don't rush the technical staff. Let them come to us."

Evelyn's raised hand hovered, then slowly lowered.
###Chapter 767: My Wife's Concern

Evelyn stood outside the study door, her fingers hovering in midair.

Alexander's low, icy voice seeped through the crack: "At all costs. I want to see them bankrupt and liquidated."

Her breath hitched.

After weathering the storms between the Andersons and the Hamiltons, she was no stranger to corporate cutthroat games. But hearing Alexander speak in that tone sent a shiver down her spine.

She slowly curled her fingers back.

"Who's there?" The study door swung open abruptly.

Alexander stood at the threshold, his stern expression melting the moment he saw her. He tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Why aren't you asleep? Did the baby fuss?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I came down for water and saw your light still on."

Her gaze drifted to the facedown phone on his desk.

"Just business." He closed the door smoothly. "Let me walk you back."

In the bedroom, Baby Chloe slept soundly, tiny fists clenched tight.

Alexander leaned down to kiss the child's forehead, then brushed his lips against Evelyn's. "Rest. I'll join you soon."

The door clicked shut softly.

Lying in the dark, Evelyn replayed his ruthless words earlier. The merciless corporate titan versus the tender husband—which was the real Alexander?

Back in the study, the voice on the phone hesitated. "Mr. Hamilton?"

"Proceed." His tone frosted over again. "I want the acquisition draft before dawn."

Hanging up, he massaged his temples. The computer's blue glow sharpened his angular features.

"Sir, Mrs. Hamilton was just—"

"She worries about me." His lips curved unconsciously at Evelyn's mention. "Prepare two approaches—one diplomatic, one aggressive."

At 4 AM, Evelyn jolted awake from a nightmare.

Annabelle's shrill voice echoed in her ears: "He'll discard you like he did me!"

She sat up gasping, her nightgown damp with sweat.

A faint noise came from downstairs.

In the kitchen, Alexander was carefully measuring formula powder. Steam softened his usually rigid profile.

"The water's boiling over." Evelyn's voice startled him.

He jerked, splashing hot water onto the counter.

As they scrambled to clean up, heart-wrenching wails erupted upstairs.

"I'll go!"
"Let me!"

They raced for the stairs simultaneously.

Baby Chloe's face was flushed from crying, only calming when she saw both parents. One tiny fist gripped Alexander's sleeve, the other clutched Evelyn's nightgown.

"Sandwiched again." Alexander chuckled ruefully.

Evelyn wiped the baby's tears, then glimpsed silver glinting at his collar—the wedding band she'd placed on his finger, catching the first light of dawn.
###Chapter 768: You Can Interfere With Me

The silver ring glimmered faintly in the sunlight.

Evelyn Carter stared blankly at the necklace dangling from Alexander Hamilton's neck. The familiar wedding band swayed gently with his steps. She remembered this ring had been retrieved by the police after being dredged up—she never expected to see it again like this.

"You kept it."

Her voice was as light as a feather.

Alexander noticed her gaze but didn't slow his pace. "That period was important to me. Unfortunately, I realized it too late. So I need it to remind me not to repeat the same mistakes."

The ring had become his warning sign, a constant reminder of his past failures.

Evelyn recalled the dream she had that morning, her fingers unconsciously tightening around the hem of her coat. The cold voice from last night's study had momentarily transported her back to those dark days.

Annabelle Taylor got what she deserved, but if Alexander was truly as ruthless as the rumors suggested...

"If you don’t like it, I won’t wear it."

Alexander, ever perceptive, picked up on her shift in mood and unfastened the necklace with one hand. Baby Chloe was clutching his other hand, babbling happily.

"Do as you please." Evelyn averted her eyes.

"But you can interfere with my decisions." His deep, steady voice held her gaze.

The words spread through Evelyn’s heart like ink in water. Even after slipping into her white coat and settling into the consultation room, they lingered in her mind. She was accustomed to solitude—aside from patients and close friends, she rarely involved herself in others' lives.

Even during their marriage, she and Alexander had maintained clear boundaries.

Now, he was the one breaking them.

"Dr. Carter?" Olivia Lightfoot’s voice pulled her back to reality. "Should we call Mr. Hamilton?"

"Why?"

"To tell him not to come so early to wait for you," Olivia said with a teasing wink. "Last time it rained, he ran into Dr. Wilson in the waiting area. The atmosphere was so icy it could freeze hell over..."

It was only then that Evelyn remembered Alexander had been picking her up from work recently. As she dialed his number, she flipped through the medical records of a newly transferred patient.

"Don’t come to pick me up tonight."

"Then I’ll wait until you finish? I have overtime too."

"The patient’s condition is critical. I might be here all night." She paused. "Let the family know for me."

The moment the words left her mouth, she froze. Without realizing it, she had started referring to the Hamilton estate as "home."

A brief silence stretched on the other end.

"Alright." Alexander’s voice sounded slightly strained.

The consultation lasted well into the night. The pregnant woman was only four months along—the fetus wasn’t fully developed yet, but the mother’s heart condition posed an immediate threat to her life. Evelyn and the cardiothoracic surgeon debated treatment options at length.

"I’ll have to stay in the on-call room tonight." Rubbing her temples, she headed toward the inpatient ward—only to be stopped by an enticing aroma.

The reception desk was laden with an array of late-night snacks: steaming wontons, fragrant coffee, vibrantly colored pastries...

"Dr. Carter!" Olivia waved at her with a milk tea in hand. "Come eat something!"

"Where did this—"

"Not takeout." Olivia winked mysteriously.

"It’s me."

Alexander emerged from the far end of the hallway, holding an insulated container. The rich scent of chicken wonton soup enveloped her.

"I told you—"

"I know." He cut her off. "So after calling home, I stayed at the office to work overtime. And I prepared these."

His gaze settled on her exhausted face. "You said the patient was in critical condition. I figured everyone must be exhausted."
###Chapter 769: She Has Weekend Plans

Alexander Hamilton's extravagant midnight snack delivery left the entire OB-GYN department speechless. The lavish meal boxes piled high at the nursing station drew curious glances from every night-shift nurse.

Evelyn Carter massaged her temples at the mountain of food. Ever since Alexander started driving her to and from work, the hospital gossip mill had been working overtime. This spectacle only confirmed everyone's suspicions.

"Drink it while it's hot." He deftly arranged the utensils and slid a steaming bowl of chicken soup toward her.

She mechanically lifted a spoonful to her lips. The warm broth soothed her exhaustion from the long shift. After several sips, color finally returned to her pale cheeks.

"There's a Four Seasons nearby," Alexander noted the dark circles under her eyes. "I booked a suite."

"No need." She set down her spoon. "Cardiology is taking over the case. I finally have a free weekend."

His eyes lit up. "How about the new hot springs resort? I heard—"

"I have plans." She cut him off.

His grip tightened around the car keys, but he asked no further questions. During the drive home, Evelyn slumped against the seat in exhausted sleep. He turned off the music and slowed to a crawl.

Dawn filtered through the sheer curtains when Evelyn jolted awake. The warmth at her waist made her freeze—Alexander's arm encircled both her and Baby Chloe.

"Shh." He silently mouthed the word.

She realized why when she remembered last night's chaos—the baby had been crying inconsolably when he carried her home. Auntie Marry changed her into pajamas while Alexander spent half the night soothing their daughter.

"She's been sleeping through the night lately." Evelyn stroked the child's soft hair.

"Maybe she missed us this morning." His whisper was barely audible.

The words pierced Evelyn's heart. Trust took years to build but only seconds to shatter.

They spent the entire morning glued to Chloe's side. The toddler kept looking up to confirm their presence before returning to her yarn ball. Peanut the Ragdoll cat lounged nearby, occasionally batting at the rolling strands.

As afternoon shadows lengthened, Evelyn reached for her coat.

"Invite your friend here?" Alexander suggested, absently twirling Chloe's ribbon headband.

"We made plans." Thinking of his late-night international conference calls, she refused firmly. Gregory Wilson was trouble enough—she didn't need additional complications.

His puppy-dog eyes followed her to the door. Evelyn hardened her resolve and shut it behind her, catching the sound of Chloe's delighted giggles inside.

Alexander was twisting balloons into animal shapes. Once the child tired, he pulled out his phone and dialed Vivian Dempsey.

"Calling for business, Mr. Hamilton?" Vivian's tone turned wary.

"I hear Dempsey Group wants the medical equipment distribution rights?"

A pause. Then icy clarity: "Don't think throwing me deals will work, Alexander. Evelyn sees through that—and so do I."
###Chapter 770: Young Talent or First Marriage

Vivian Dempsey was as blunt as ever.

Others might be fooled by Alexander Hamilton's facade, but as Evelyn Carter's best friend, she saw right through his tactics—he was clearly exploiting Evelyn's loyal nature to win her back.

A former master of romance indeed. His psychological warfare was flawless.

Alexander admitted frankly, "Miss Dempsey, Evelyn has been under a lot of work stress lately. You should take her out more often."

He wasn't hiding his intentions. Since he was calling to confirm Evelyn's whereabouts, he might as well be direct.

"Hah," Vivian rolled her eyes on the other end of the line. "Did you upset Evelyn again?"

Alexander's sharp hearing picked up the background noise—Vivian was working overtime at her office. So she wasn't the one meeting Evelyn tonight.

He made up an excuse to hang up and immediately contacted his informants at Central Hospital.

For months, he'd been driving Evelyn to and from work without fail, showering her with sweet gestures. The entire OB-GYN department assumed they were a couple. Even colleagues who knew about their past marriage thought they were reconciling.

That was how Alexander had obtained the contact details of several nurses—originally just to track Evelyn's schedule. But tonight was different. He sensed danger.

His first suspicion fell on Gregory Wilson, but the intel he gathered made him bolt upright from the couch.

Evelyn wasn't just meeting someone—she was on a blind date!

Rumor had it the guy was a colleague introduced by a patient—young, accomplished, and most importantly, never married!

Alexander didn't bother verifying the details. He grabbed Baby Chloe and rushed out the door, heading straight for Evelyn's favorite cafés and teahouses, especially those near the hospital.

When he sped into the teahouse across from the hospital, he spotted Evelyn immediately.

They'd visited this place before with her father. But today, instead of a private room, she was seated at a semi-private booth on the first floor, across from a sharply dressed young man. Their animated conversation stung Alexander's eyes.

Silently, he booked the booth behind Evelyn and settled in with the stroller. The waiter gave him a curious look—a man with a baby in a teahouse was unusual—but assumed he was waiting for someone and didn't pry.

It was Baby Chloe's first time in a teahouse, and she was excitedly looking around. Alexander pressed a finger to his lips, and miraculously, the little one quieted down.

Father and daughter began their covert observation.

Using his phone screen as a mirror, Alexander studied the so-called suitor. Objectively, the man was average-looking but had an earnest demeanor—exactly the type that thrived in the dating scene.

The thought that he himself had met Evelyn through a blind date sent his alarm bells ringing. He could practically hear his inner voice roaring: So what if he's a few years younger?!

Love makes fools of the wise. His thoughts spiraled into absurdity.

Liam Macmillan suddenly shivered and instinctively tightened his jacket.

Evelyn was focused on the test reports he'd brought. Noticing his discomfort, she asked, "Cold? Have some hot tea."

They'd been discussing surgical staplers since sitting down and hadn't even touched their drinks. Liam poured himself a cup to warm up, puzzled. "The windows are closed. Why is it suddenly so chilly?"

He joked, "Last time I felt like this was in high school when I fell asleep in class and got caught by the dean."

Evelyn closed the report and asked, "What happened then?"

"Got sent to stand at the back of the classroom," Liam laughed. "Ended up sleeping even more soundly against the door."

Behind the screen, Alexander nearly crushed his teacup. Unable to see the medical equipment on the table, all he heard was their lively banter—deepening his misunderstanding by the second.

Once Liam confirmed Evelyn had no plans to remarry, he shifted focus to work. "Dr. Carter, what do you think of this stapler?"

It was a new device designed for C-sections, and he was eager for the seasoned obstetrician's approval.

Evelyn pondered. "Personally, I think it's good. But something this important needs to be discussed with the team."

She meant the department heads, but to Alexander, it sounded like she was referring to "family."
###Chapter 771: A Storm of Jealousy

Images flashed through Alexander Hamilton's mind in an instant.

"No!" He emerged abruptly from behind the screen, his voice icy.

Evelyn Carter was about to accept the stranger's proposal. He couldn't stay seated any longer.

Liam Macmillan nearly jumped out of his chair at Alexander's sudden appearance. "Good heavens! Who was hiding back there?!"

Evelyn turned and frowned upon recognizing him. "Weren't you supposed to be home with the baby?"

"Ah!"

Baby Chloe giggled and waved her tiny hands excitedly at the sound of her mother's voice.

Liam stared at the bizarre scene, utterly bewildered. "What... what's going on here?"

He had been discussing medical equipment with Dr. Carter. How did a man and a child suddenly appear? Was this how business meetings worked now?

Before Evelyn could speak, Alexander cut in sharply. "Evelyn, you can reject me, but you can't just settle for anyone."

Only then did Evelyn realize the magnitude of his misunderstanding.

Liam, oblivious, added fuel to the fire. "Excuse me, sir, but who are you? What right do you have to interfere with Dr. Carter's decisions?"

"I'm her—" Alexander suddenly faltered.

Their relationship was too complicated to define. They lived under the same roof, occasionally shared a bed, yet had no official title. Calling them friends felt hollow, and claiming to be husband and wife wasn't something she had acknowledged.

"Let me introduce you," Evelyn broke the awkward silence. "This is my ex-husband, Alexander Hamilton." She gestured to the baby. "And this is a child we're temporarily caring for, as a favor to a friend."

Liam's jaw dropped. "Huh?!"

Alexander gave a stiff nod. "Mm."

The two men seemed to be competing in brevity.

Evelyn sighed and motioned for Alexander to join them with the baby. She explained the situation clearly.

Finally understanding, Liam felt like the most wronged man alive.

"I did initially consider pursuing Dr. Carter romantically," he admitted, sweating nervously. "But after learning she wasn't interested in marriage or children right now, I switched to discussing business. These surgical staplers are expensive, so I wanted to discuss them in person."

Recognizing Alexander, Liam feared losing the deal and grew even more anxious.

Alexander's expression froze as he took in the medical equipment and documents on the table.

He wished the ground would swallow him whole.

"Which company do you represent?" Alexander asked abruptly.

No one in Hudson City's business circles didn't know Alexander Hamilton.

Liam quickly named his company and ventured cautiously, "I heard Hamilton Group is expanding into new ventures?"

Evelyn suddenly remembered Alexander's previous discussions about hospital donations. So rumors had already spread.

"The bidding opens next month," Alexander said coldly.

Sensing danger, Liam shot Evelyn a pleading look.

She rubbed her temples. "I'll take the samples and reports back for review, but the final decision isn't mine to make."

Liam fled as if granted a pardon.

Baby Chloe giggled in her stroller, seemingly amused by the whole spectacle.

"Alright," Evelyn said, locking eyes with Alexander. "How did you find me here? I didn't notice anyone following me."

"What if I said it was intuition?" Alexander's gaze flickered.

Evelyn considered this. "I'd believe you."

Alexander's eyes brightened. "We're in sync."

"You've been here before," Evelyn said flatly. "It's not surprising you found it."

She had chosen this teahouse for the same reason—intuition.

Suddenly, Alexander understood. This was a place Andrew Anderson had frequented.

"I've recently been looking into medical equipment," he said gently. "Maybe I can help."

Evelyn recalled their late-night conversation in the study and arched a brow. "What kind of 'looking into'? Acquisitions or investments? I may not be as knowledgeable as you, but I understand the basics."
###Chapter 772: Warmth at Her Fingertips

Evelyn stared at the document Alexander handed her, her fingertips lightly tracing the edge of the paper.

"I need an explanation about the acquisition case."

Alexander was prepared. He nudged a coffee cup toward her.

"They cut off our raw material supply first. I just returned the favor."

His gaze swept over the box of surgical stapler samples on the table, his brow furrowing slightly. "That medical rep didn't seem very professional."

Every man who approached Evelyn received his X-ray-like scrutiny three times over.

She flipped through the product manual, pausing at the key specifications. "Credentials check out, but his demeanor wasn't industry-standard."

With efficient movements, she packed the materials into her bag. As she stood, her coat fluttered slightly.

"I'm heading to the hospital."

Alexander immediately reached for the baby in the stroller, but she stopped him.

"Too many germs at the hospital." She pointed at the willow catkins drifting outside the window. "Wait with her in the car."

The nurses at the station brightened when they saw Evelyn.

"Dr. Carter, your boyfriend was just here looking for you!"

Evelyn froze mid-step. Now she understood how Alexander had pinpointed her location at the teahouse. She pinched the bridge of her nose—this problem was more vexing than any complicated medical case.

Inside the patient room, the pregnant woman's face was as pale as paper, her fingers gripping the sheets.

"Dr. Carter, my baby..."

Evelyn opened the test report. The shadow on the CT scan of the heart was alarming.

"Cardiac failure symptoms at four months. The risks will multiply exponentially by the third trimester." Her voice was as calm as if discussing the weather. "Mortality rate during delivery is as high as 30%."

The woman's husband suddenly dropped to his knees, pressing his forehead against the bed rail.

"Our last child... it was a car accident..."

Evelyn's pen made an abrupt line across the chart. She snapped it shut, her fingers trembling slightly in her white coat pocket.

The hospital doors opened to a gust of wind carrying the sharp scent of disinfectant.

Alexander's coat billowed behind him as he caught her cold hand.

"Where's your scarf?"

"Left it in the locker room." She instinctively tried to pull away, but he held on tighter.

His palm was like warm jade, heat spreading from her fingertips to her wrist. Evelyn suddenly remembered her professor saying during residency that human body heat transfers at 0.5 meters per second.

That abstract fact now had tangible meaning.

"Angelica chicken soup?" He glanced at her flushed earlobes. "Or red dates with goji berries?"

The car's AC hummed softly. Evelyn paused while fastening her seatbelt. In the rearview mirror, the baby blew bubbles at her.

"She actually believes you when you say that?"

Alexander turned the steering wheel, his lips curving slightly. "I told her Mommy went to buy candy, so she's counting to one hundred obediently."

Shadows of plane trees flowed across the windshield. Evelyn studied the unfamiliar streets, her reflection in the window showing widened eyes.

"This isn't the way home."

"Taking you somewhere." He undid two shirt buttons with one hand, his Adam's apple moving in the shadows. "About that pregnant patient... I found out some things."

The tires rolled over a speed bump, eliciting giggles from the stroller. Evelyn realized then—somewhere along the way, he'd become attuned to every shift in her emotions.

Just like now, the warmth of his right hand still lingered on her fingertips.
###Chapter 773 When the Coin Flips Through the Air

Weekend sunlight slanted lazily across the car window.

Evelyn leaned against the seat, her gaze drifting over the bleak streets outside. In this transitional period between winter and spring, the city resembled an unfinished sketch—patches of lingering snow and bare branches glaring under the sunlight.

Alexander's Cayenne slowly climbed a slope in the old district.

"Look at those trees," he said suddenly.

Evelyn lifted her eyes. Among the skeletal branches of the roadside trees, stubborn flecks of tender green were emerging. As the car passed, the new buds cast dappled shadows across the windshield.

"Want to take a walk?" Alexander asked.

She nodded.

They stood side by side on the slope, neither speaking. A spring breeze carrying the scent of damp earth brushed their faces. Evelyn broke the silence: "It's warmer here."

"Because the buildings block the wind?"

"Mmm." She reached out to touch the tree trunk. "Plants are the most sensitive to temperature changes."

Alexander chuckled. "I thought you'd say spring chose to linger here a little longer."

She withdrew her hand, fingertips still tingling from the bark's roughness. "Trees are just trees. They don't linger for anyone."

Her quiet words tightened Alexander's chest. He noticed her gaze drifting into the distance, as if fixed on some invisible point.

"What happened at the hospital?" he asked directly.

After a pause, Evelyn recounted the pregnant patient's story. By the end, her voice trembled slightly: "I couldn't persuade them... just like I couldn't persuade myself back then."

Alexander's throat moved, but no words of comfort came. Suddenly, he retrieved a coin from the console: "Try this."

"I don't believe in luck."

"It's not about luck." He pressed the coin into her palm. "It's about seeing your own heart clearly."

The coin traced a silver arc through the air.

Evelyn caught it without checking the result. She returned it to him, her eyes now clear: "I know what to do."

That evening at dinner, Evelyn abruptly set down her chopsticks: "I'm going to the hospital tomorrow."

Alexander's serving hand froze midair: "I thought we agreed you'd rest?"

"That pregnant woman... I want to try again." Her eyes burned with determination. "At least give her one more option."

Silently, Alexander withdrew his chopsticks and managed a smile: "What do you need from me?"

"Take care of Baby Chloe." She was already pulling up medical references on her phone. "It might... take a while."

That "while" stretched into seven full days.

Evelyn became possessed, leaving before dawn and returning late each night. Twice when Alexander brought meals, he found her dozing at her desk, thick medical journals still spread beside her.

On the seventh evening, Alexander stood in the hospital corridor holding Baby Chloe.

Through the glass, he watched Evelyn speaking with the pregnant patient. Sunlight streamed behind her, gilding her silhouette. In that moment, he finally understood the coin's true meaning.

Not about fate choosing for you.

But about choosing to become your own fate.
###Chapter 774: Sincerity for Sincerity

Dark circles shadowed Evelyn's eyes, and her cheeks had grown thinner. Yet her gaze shone brighter than ever, like the most dazzling stars in the night sky.

Late at night at the dining table, she stirred the soup in her bowl with a tired but content smile. "I'll take care of the baby this weekend. You should rest."

Alexander's eyes lingered on her slender fingers, still marked from years of wearing medical gloves. He pushed a bowl of black chicken soup toward her. "I'm not tired. But you—you've been working nonstop for weeks, barely stopping to eat."

His voice carried hidden concern. Since Evelyn had returned to work, he'd become a regular at the hospital. From hot midnight meals to comfortable mattresses, the entire OB-GYN department knew him as their "Helping Hand."

"Now they're calling you Aladdin's lamp," Evelyn chuckled, the fine lines at her eyes softening under the light. "They say you grant all wishes."

Only the ticking of the wall clock filled the living room. Baby Chloe slept soundly in her crib, her rosy cheeks nestled in a soft blanket.

Alexander hesitated, his fingers tapping lightly on the table. "Tomorrow... would you like to catch a movie?"

"More free tickets from Vincent?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "He really has too much time on his hands."

At the mention of his playboy friend, Alexander's lips twitched. Vincent's usual tricks—flowers sent to Evelyn ended up at the nurses' station, Michelin-starred reservations turned into department dinners—never worked on her.

He knew better than anyone—flashy gestures could never win Evelyn's heart.

"If you don't want to go..." His voice trailed off.

Evelyn yawned, her eyelids drooping. "I just want to sleep..." Before she could finish, her head had already tilted back against the chair.

Gently, Alexander carried her to their bedroom, gazing at her exhausted yet peaceful face in the dark. He pulled out his phone and texted his assistant: Cancel all meetings tomorrow.

The next morning, the house was unusually quiet. A note on the table explained—the grandparents had gone on a group outing, even Auntie Wu had taken the day off.

Rubbing her eyes as she stepped out of the bedroom, Evelyn spotted Alexander preparing a bottle. "They're certainly enjoying themselves."

"I've got the baby," he said, expertly testing the milk's temperature. "Go freshen up. Breakfast will be ready soon."

The day flowed by like honey. Curled on the couch with Alexander's special floral tea, Evelyn mindlessly watched a reality show. No surgeries, no patient files—just sunlight painting patterns on the floor through the sheer curtains.

Until a dull thud came from the kitchen.

Alexander stood helpless before a geyser of water, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Droplets sprayed his face, dripping from his chin like a drenched puppy.

"Turn off the valve..." Evelyn's voice came from behind, laced with amused exasperation.

He froze. He'd researched tutorials, gathered tools, but forgotten the most basic step. Water dripped from his hair, pooling on the tiles.

Evelyn stepped forward and twisted the valve shut. The water stopped instantly, leaving only the sound of residual drops.

"I..." Alexander's ears burned. He wanted to be someone Evelyn could rely on, yet he'd bungled the simplest household task.

She handed him a towel, her eyes glimmering. "Take your time learning. No rush."

Her fingertips brushed his palm—warm and dry. In that moment, Alexander understood: this was what he truly wanted. Not perfection, but real companionship.
###Chapter 775: Seduction Tactics

Alexander Hamilton had learned his lesson. He double-checked the pipes to ensure they were properly fixed before letting Evelyn Carter turn on the water. As it flowed smoothly, he exhaled in relief. "Hope this holds up for a while."

The makeshift repair was far from perfect, but given the limited tools, getting through the day would count as a success.

"Margaret would be proud," Evelyn remarked, her gaze inadvertently sweeping over him.

He had taken the brunt of the earlier splash. His soaked white shirt clung to his frame, nearly transparent, outlining every defined muscle. Water droplets still trailed from his hair down his neck.

Evelyn quickly averted her eyes. "You’ll catch a cold. Go change."

Alexander’s physique was undeniably striking—a visual assault too intense for any adult to ignore.

Glancing down at himself, realization dawned. He hurried to his room and emerged in a black shirt, conservative in design save for the slightly lowered collar. With just a tilt of her head, Evelyn could glimpse the faint outline of his chest and the ever-present ring he wore.

Back on the couch, Alexander pretended to focus on the TV, though his mind was elsewhere. At thirty, he knew how to wield his mature charm. He intended to make full use of his assets.

The sudden ring of his phone shattered the charged atmosphere.

"Should I give you privacy?" Evelyn teased.

"It’s Emily," he said, half-hoping she’d probe. But she showed no interest.

After hanging up, his brow furrowed. "An important client is transiting through Hudson City tomorrow morning. I need to meet them."

Evelyn nodded. "Work comes first. I’ll handle the pipes."

Her indifference stung. "It’s just a quick dinner. I’ll be back soon."

"Your business dinners were never that simple before," she mused. "Late nights, drinks, negotiations. Then there were the spas, karaoke bars… Oh, and the billiards halls. Those were fun too."

Her tone was light, but Alexander stiffened as if sitting on needles. "I never fooled around in those places. You can ask—well, never mind. Vincent’s word is worthless. At lounges, I only drank craft beer. At karaoke, I just listened. And I prefer basketball over pool—you saw me at the school, remember? We could go to the court if you want."

The more he defended himself, the deeper he dug.

"I’m on duty next week," Evelyn shut him down flatly.

"The week after?"

"Expert lecture."

As a leading OB-GYN, academic events were non-negotiable.

Alexander froze. "The hospital keeps you busier than the rural clinic ever did."

Amused by his deflated expression, Evelyn chuckled. "Hudson City’s population is dozens of times larger than the village’s. Of course it’s more demanding. At least here, I have backup. I wonder how the clinic is holding up."

Months had passed since their return to the city, and news from the village had dwindled. With Alexander’s help, Lily Waters and her family had settled into urban life, renting a home and thriving.
###Chapter 776: The Insatiable Human Heart

Water droplets still clung to Alexander Hamilton's hair, dampening the collar of his dress shirt. Oblivious, he remained lost in thought, pondering Evelyn Carter's words.

"Your shirt's getting wet again," Evelyn couldn't help but remind him.

Alexander snapped out of his reverie and turned to fetch the hairdryer.

A soft whimper suddenly came from the crib. Baby Chloe's tiny face scrunched up in her sleep, tears rolling down her cheeks.

Evelyn rushed to the cradle in three quick strides, gently rocking it. Normally, the baby napped for at least three to four hours, but today she'd barely slept two.

The child's own cries startled her awake. Her damp eyes fluttered open, her little mouth trembling as fat tears spilled over.

Alexander's heart ached. He immediately scooped the baby into his arms, murmuring soothing words alongside Evelyn: "Shh, sweetheart. Mommy and Daddy are right here."

"Ma...Da..." the baby babbled indistinctly.

Evelyn's chest tightened. The child was missing her birth parents. Though Vincent Croix was unworthy of fatherhood, how could an innocent baby understand that? In her pure little world, parents meant safety and love.

She nearly blurted out "Mommy's here," but Bianca Langley had only left temporarily. Besides, Evelyn never considered herself maternal material.

Alexander seamlessly picked up the thread: "Daddy's right here."

Evelyn's eyes widened at him.

"Better than Vincent," Alexander stated matter-of-factly. "If someone refuses to be a father, I'll gladly step up."

He'd originally intended to be just a godfather, but after these months co-parenting with Evelyn, his feelings had shifted.

Evelyn hesitated. "Miss Langley isn't even divorced yet. Isn't this..."

"I only want to be her father," Alexander's voice turned gravelly, "not her mother's husband."

The words tangled like a tongue twister.

When Evelyn stayed silent, Alexander abruptly asked, "If I really pursued someone—whether Bianca or anyone else—would you mind?"

"No." The answer came too fast, almost instinctive.

The air froze solid.

Despite the blasting heater, Alexander felt icy to his core.

"Let me dry your hair." Evelyn turned to grab a towel.

Rising on tiptoes, her fingertips brushed his roots through the fabric. The moment they made contact, the storm clouds in Alexander's heart miraculously cleared.

Fine. If this arrangement satisfied Evelyn, he'd gladly maintain the status quo.

But human hearts are never content.

The man who'd sworn to be happy with things as they were now craved legitimacy.

Alexander smirked self-deprecatingly.

He left at the last possible minute before the dinner engagement. Speeding through traffic, he barely made it to the restaurant on time.

In the private room, a southern client was pouring tea for his wife. Noticing Alexander's arrival, the man carefully set down his wife's cup before rising to greet him.

"Mr. Hamilton, I heard you've been unwell. A small token."

The elegant gift box contained rare health supplements.

Alexander presented two reciprocal gifts—including a silk scarf specially selected for the client's wife.

The client beamed ear-to-ear. At their age, couples who remained this affectionate were rare. The sight made Alexander's heart twinge—this should have been his and Evelyn's future.

"Is your wife not joining us?" the client inquired curiously. "I heard Mrs. Hamilton is a renowned doctor. My wife's been eager to meet her."

Their circle still believed their divorce had been a sham.

Alexander forced a smile. "She's swamped with work. Not fond of social events."

"The Andersons' daughter, right? I have some ties with Old Anderson. He recently—"

The client's wife elbowed him into silence.

"Mr. Hamilton is being considerate," she chided her husband. "Not everyone drags their family everywhere like you do. Doctors are insanely busy!"

Realizing his faux pas, the client hastily raised his glass. "A penalty drink for me!"

Three rounds later, the conversation somehow circled back.

"Young and accomplished—why not have another child?" the tipsy client asked. "You two seem great with kids."

Alexander's grip on his wineglass tightened.
###Chapter 777: No Light Left Burning for Him

The transparent liquor bottle bore no label, its contents shimmering with an amber-tinged crimson hue under the lamplight—lighter than red wine yet more luminous.

The client poured himself a generous glass and downed it in one gulp.

Alexander Hamilton accepted the offered tumbler, lifting it to his nose. The pungent aroma assaulted his senses—nothing like wine’s mellow richness. His brow furrowed, remembering his morning promise to Evelyn.

"Don’t worry, Mr. Hamilton. Low alcohol content—your wife won’t scold you." The client winked, the knowing smirk of a seasoned drinker.

Glasses rose around the table.

Trapped by etiquette, Alexander took a measured sip. Ice-cold liquor seared his throat like liquid fire, pooling molten in his stomach. The mercifully mild afterburn eased his tension slightly.

The seafood restaurant Emily Zade booked specialized in raw marinated dishes. Briny ocean scents rose from platters of crab and shellfish, but Alexander only touched the congee before him.

Instead, the nameless liquor kept flowing. Early spring’s chill dissipated as warmth crept through his limbs. Alcohol loosened the knots in his chest until he’d drunk more than intended.

The dinner ended earlier than planned. Clients departed arm-in-arm, colleagues collected by spouses. Soon, Alexander stood alone beneath the restaurant’s awning.

He should’ve called a driver. But the distant constellation of glowing windows rooted him to the spot. Behind those illuminated panes, not a single light waited for his return.

Liquor stripped away his polished facade. He collapsed onto a bench, letting night winds scatter the alcohol’s grasp.

His phone shattered the silence.

Not Evelyn.

Emily’s update on the merger acquisition came rapid-fire. Alexander accelerated his responses to double speed: "...retain the tech team, freeze other positions..."

"Sir, is your dinner concluded?"

"Yes." He hung up mid-sentence, pulse hammering at his temples.

Emily immediately dialed Evelyn.

Upstairs, Evelyn played building blocks with Baby Chloe. The caller ID tightened her chest.

"Mrs. Hamilton, apologies for the late interruption."

Her fingers clenched the phone. "Is Alexander hurt?"

"The CEO overindulged. I’m currently out of town..."

When the location ping arrived, Chloe was babbling at a family photo in her picture book. Evelyn knelt, brushing the toddler’s cheek. "I’m fetching your godfather. Stay with Grandma, yes?"

The child blinked, then chirped: "Dada!"

Margaret Hamilton and Grace Anderson exchanged glances.

"She’s claiming Alexander as father," Margaret murmured. "So young to understand loss..."

Grace gathered the girl. "Go. She’s clever—knows you’ll return."

Evelyn found Alexander slumped on the bench. Ash snowed his coat hem, a spent cigarette nearly scorching his fingers. Eyes closed, he might’ve been asleep.

"Wake up." She jostled his shoulder. "Sleep at home."

The night wind carried spring’s lingering bite, stirring his lashes like frost-tipped reeds.
###Chapter 778: I Want to Make You Happy

The night was ink-black. Alexander Hamilton stood outside the convenience store, a freshly bought cigarette between his fingers. He watched the smoke dissipate under the streetlight, feeling strangely dazed.

"Sir, your change." The clerk's voice snapped him back to reality.

He pocketed the coins absently. His phone screen lit up with a message from Emily Zade. He glanced at it once before turning it off.

Annabelle Taylor was a thing of the past. He thought he'd moved on. But tonight's alcohol seemed particularly potent, dredging up memories he'd rather forget.

"Alexander?"

A familiar voice came from behind. He turned to see Evelyn Carter standing under the streetlight, her slender frame outlined in warm yellow.

"What are you doing here?" His voice came out hoarse.

She stepped closer, catching the scent of alcohol on him. Her brows furrowed. "You're drunk."

He wanted to deny it, but realized he could barely stand straight. Under the moonlight, Evelyn's face was strikingly clear. He suddenly wanted to reach out and touch her.

"Get up. I'll take you home." She reached to steady him.

The word "home" sent a tremor through him. He followed her obediently to the car, then froze at the sight of the steering wheel.

"That's my seat." He stubbornly climbed into the driver's side.

Evelyn was torn between irritation and amusement. "In your condition?"

He blinked, finally registering his state, and sheepishly moved to the passenger seat. Evelyn discreetly snapped a photo of his rare moment of vulnerability.

During the drive, Alexander felt unbearably hot. He loosened his collar, but still couldn't catch his breath.

"Do you have a fever?" Worried, Evelyn pressed a hand to his forehead—burning to the touch.

"Hot..." he mumbled, finding her cool skin soothing. He nuzzled against it instinctively.

Evelyn immediately changed course. The family home had elders and children; it was too risky. She called her mother. "Mom, we won't be back tonight—"

Grace Anderson was preoccupied with a crying baby. "This child just won't settle—"

Evelyn patiently gave instructions, but her gaze caught Alexander standing outside in the night breeze. She quickly ended the call and took his hand. "Stop catching a chill. Let's go upstairs."

The apartment was unchanged. Evelyn found fever reducers, but Alexander grabbed her wrist. His scorching palm pressed against her skin, his gaze hazy yet intense.

"Evelyn..." Her name was a ragged whisper on his lips.

The next moment, he pulled her into a tight embrace. His body temperature was alarmingly high, his breath searing against her neck. Just as she tried to push away, he captured her earlobe between his teeth.

"Alexander!" she gasped, only to be swept off her feet.

He carried her steadily toward the bedroom—nothing like a drunken man. As he laid her gently on the bed, she tried to rise, but he dropped to one knee before her.

"You faked being drunk?" Her eyes widened.

Alexander looked up at her. The alcohol hadn't entirely left his eyes, but his focus was unmistakable. He cradled her calf, pressing a kiss to her knee.

"I want to make you happy," he murmured, his lips trailing upward along her skin.

Evelyn's breath hitched, her fingers clutching the sheets. Outside, the moon slipped behind clouds, leaving only the intimacy of the room.
###Chapter 779: Deer Blood Wine

The stars had filled the night sky by the time their passion subsided.

Evelyn Carter lay limp, every fingertip tingling with exhaustion. She shifted weakly, curling up at the edge of the freshly changed sheets.

Before drifting into unconsciousness, a medical journal's claim flashed through her mind—

Male sexual performance declines significantly after thirty.

Apparently, academic studies have exceptions.

When dawn light seeped through the curtains, Evelyn found the bedsheets beneath her replaced. If not for the dull ache in her waist, she might've believed last night was just a feverish dream.

The dream's leading man...

Her ears burned scarlet.

The bedroom door creaked open. Alexander Hamilton stood there with a towel loosely tied around his waist, water droplets still clinging to his hair.

Their gazes locked, and last night's memories replayed simultaneously in both minds.

Alexander looked away first. His Adam's apple bobbed as he focused on the potted plant by the window.

If Evelyn wanted to draw boundaries, he had no right to object.

"Last night..." Evelyn cleared her throat. "Did you ingest something by mistake? Your body temperature was abnormally high."

The angry red scratches across Alexander's shoulders stood out starkly. He grabbed a shirt and shrugged it on, voice tight. "I checked. That red bottle was deer blood wine."

"Deer blood?"

"From a mature stag," he added.

The AC hummed uselessly against the thick awkwardness.

Evelyn tugged at the blanket's edge. "Don't randomly drink gifts from others next time."

"Mm." Alexander's knuckles whitened.

What should've been a tender morning felt like an awkward first date. Evelyn studied the quilt's embroidery. "The sheets..."

"I wanted you to sleep comfortably." Finally, a proper sentence.

She exhaled inwardly. "Get me some pajamas."

As the wardrobe door clicked, Evelyn stared blankly at the ceiling. They'd agreed to maintain distance—how had things crossed the line?

Steam clouded the bathroom mirror until she wiped it away, revealing scattered love bites. Her fingers trembled as hot water ran endlessly before her stiff muscles finally relaxed.

The aroma of congee drifted from the kitchen. Alexander was drizzling sesame oil over pickled vegetables when she entered. His hand jerked, the porcelain spoon clinking sharply against the bowl.

"Make do with this." His voice barely carried.

The century egg and pork congee was perfectly cooked. Evelyn lifted a spoonful. "No need for takeout."

Alexander's chopsticks stilled. Right. She could manage perfectly fine without him.

After clearing the dishes, Evelyn suddenly asked, "What do we tell them when we return?"

"Say I was dead drunk." He shouldered all responsibility.

As she nodded, Evelyn noticed the broken skin at the corner of his mouth.

They maintained half a meter's distance on the return trip. Evelyn walked ahead while Alexander carried the fruit basket like a cheating husband caught red-handed.

Laughter spilled from the ancestral home's parlor. Four elders surrounded the baby's bassinet, none questioning their overnight absence.

"Grapes?" Margaret Hamilton smiled knowingly. "Evelyn's favorite."

Evelyn nearly choked on her saliva. She hurried to the stroller. "Did the baby fuss last night?"

Colorful building blocks littered the carpet. As Alexander knelt to gather them, faint scratch marks peeked above his collar. Teresa Taylor's teacup rattled in its saucer.

Grace Anderson abruptly suggested, "Should you two...move back in with us?"

The rattle slipped from Evelyn's fingers and clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 780: The Dividing Line

Last time they were just slightly late coming home, Baby Chloe had wailed inconsolably. Now after staying out all night, Evelyn stood by the crib watching her daughter's peaceful sleeping face, guilt washing over her in waves.

All those lingering romantic thoughts dissolved instantly.

"She slept wonderfully last night," Grace said in a hushed tone. "That sandwich sleeping method you suggested worked like a charm. Once she adjusts more, the nanny can handle daytime while you two take nights. That way you'll both get proper rest."

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged glances.

Their daughter certainly knew how to pick her targets.

When their eyes met, memories from last night surfaced abruptly. Evelyn's ears burned as she quickly looked away.

Alexander's smile froze before twisting into something more rueful.

The older generation remained engrossed in baby talk, oblivious to the undercurrents between them. Under the pretense of childcare and work obligations, they maintained an unspoken truce.

That evening, Alexander didn't retreat to his study as usual.

Evelyn was humming a lullaby when the mattress dipped beside her. Her fingers stilled briefly, but the song continued.

This was his bedroom. She had no right to banish him.

Baby Chloe slept between them like an invisible boundary. Lying face to face, the atmosphere felt stiffer than between strangers, bearing no trace of last night's passion.

Adults do these things. It's normal, Evelyn told herself.

Just as she nearly convinced herself, Alexander spoke: "About last night...I'm sorry."

The suspended tension suddenly dissipated.

Evelyn blinked. "...I'm tired."

She turned away but heard their daughter whimper in sleep. Both jerked upright simultaneously, instinctively patting the baby's back.

Before their little empress, all romantic complications took a backseat.

Once certain Chloe slept soundly again, Alexander whispered, "My stance hasn't changed. If you're willing, we can continue like this. Last night...we can pretend it never happened."

A pause. "But if you're upset, you must tell me."

Evelyn stared at the ceiling, silent.

Between them hung a sheer veil—seemingly within reach, yet impossibly distant.

Margaret observed everything. One day when Evelyn was at work, she summoned her son to the garden.

"The last wedding was too rushed. This time we'll do it properly." She traced Evelyn's photo in the album. "You're living together now, but the baby should have her proper home eventually."

Alexander remained quiet for a long moment. "Mother, if she doesn't want marriage, this arrangement is fine too."

Margaret hesitated, then sighed.

At the office, Alexander was reviewing documents when the intercom buzzed urgently.

"Mr. Hamilton, Vincent from Liang Group is forcing his way up!"

The door burst open before the secretary finished. Vincent stood there trembling, veins bulging at his temples.

"My apologies," he ground out through clenched teeth. "But I can't wait any longer."
###Chapter 781 Who Said We're Getting Divorced?

Alexander Hamilton hung up the front desk call and glanced toward his office door.

Vincent Croix had already barged in, trailed by several flustered security guards.

"Leave us," Alexander dismissed with a wave.

The guards retreated gratefully.

Vincent stormed to the desk in three strides, slamming both palms on the polished surface. "Mr. Hamilton, isn't meddling in others' affairs beneath you?"

Alexander arched an eyebrow.

That tone sounded eerily familiar.

It reminded him of his own demeanor when confronting Liam Macmillan. A cold smirk curled his lips. "Evidence, Mr. Croix. You'll need it."

The office temperature seemed to plummet.

Vincent's fists clenched until his knuckles turned white.

He inhaled sharply, forcing his rage down. "My wife and daughter have been missing for months."

Alexander leaned back in his chair, gaze glacial. "Still calling her your wife after filing for divorce?"

"Who said we're getting divorced?" Vincent slammed the desk.

Alexander remained unmoved. "The court summons says otherwise."

Vincent's face darkened.

He suddenly yanked a newspaper from his briefcase and slapped it onto the desk. "Explain this then."

The front page displayed a New Year's Eve photo.

Alexander's pupils contracted slightly.

The image showed him and Evelyn Carter pushing a stroller, their backs to the camera.

"Bianca owns that exact stroller model." Vincent's glare burned into Alexander. "Where's my daughter?"

Alexander methodically closed a file. "That model's sold everywhere."

"Alexander Hamilton!" Vincent ground his teeth. "You're determined to oppose me?"

Alexander pressed the intercom. "Escort our guest out."

Vincent slammed a hand over the phone. "I can secure you the East District land deal."

"Not interested." The words dripped ice.

A dangerous glint flashed in Vincent's eyes. "You'll regret this."

"Threatening me?" Alexander chuckled. "Vincent Croix, you're not even in my league."

The door crashed shut behind Vincent's furious exit.

Alexander immediately dialed Evelyn. "Is the baby with you?"

Giggles bubbled through the receiver.

"Yes, why?" Evelyn sounded puzzled.

Alexander recounted the confrontation in low tones.

Silence.

Then a trembling whisper. "He's insane... That's his own flesh and blood..."

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the infant's innocent smile.

Evelyn tightened her arms around the child.
###Chapter 782 Why Couldn't She Let Go

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she gripped her phone.

Vincent Croix's actions couldn't simply be described as "scummy" anymore. Vivian was right—he was a monster in human skin.

Baby Chloe seemed to sense her distress, pausing her play with the plush toy to gaze up timidly. Those clear, innocent eyes brimmed with unease.

"It's okay." Evelyn immediately crouched down, gently holding the child's soft little hand. This poor girl had already suffered enough—her birth mother was missing, and her father was a madman. In comparison, Alexander Hamilton, her godfather, seemed more like a real parent.

Alexander's sharp intuition picked up the tension through the phone. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing." Evelyn steadied her breathing, softening her tone. "I scared Chloe with my tone earlier. Don't worry, I'll remind the family to be extra careful when taking her out."

Since returning to work, they had less time to spend with the baby. During the day, the grandparents usually took her to the park to play with other children.

Days passed uneventfully, and Evelyn almost let her guard down—until that sunny afternoon.

To devise the best treatment plan for a pregnant patient with heart disease, Evelyn often missed meals. Alexander, concerned, made it a daily ritual to deliver a thermal lunchbox to her office, leaving it on her desk even if she wasn't there.

That day, after hurriedly finishing lunch, Evelyn was heading to the washroom to clean her dishes when someone abruptly grabbed her from behind.

The hospital hallway was crowded—who would dare such boldness?

"Dr. Carter, I just want to talk."

The hand clamped around her wrist was cold as iron. The voice carried a bone-chilling eeriness, vaguely familiar.

Evelyn spun around and met a pair of bloodshot eyes.

"...Vincent?"

She finally recognized where she'd heard that voice before—at the Hamilton Resort, where that ruthless man had been searching for Bianca Langley.

Now, Vincent looked even more haggard, his gaze dark and unsettling.

"I just want to know where Bianca is." He cut straight to the point. "The baby is with you and Mr. Hamilton, right? Don't bother denying it. We both know the truth."

He pulled out several surveillance photos from his suit pocket—all taken near the Hamilton estate.

Evelyn's heart sank.

This man was far more dangerous than Alexander had described. To have stalked them undetected for so long, he was either truly desperate or a deeply concealed lunatic.

Sunlight streamed through the hallway windows, yet Vincent's face remained shadowed. He was undeniably handsome, with a tall, commanding presence—no wonder he'd once won Bianca's heart among countless suitors. But now, he only sent chills down her spine.

"Mr. Croix," Evelyn said coldly, "I have nothing to say regarding Ms. Langley."

Her stance mirrored Alexander's exactly.

Vincent, wary of Alexander, didn't dare push too hard. Seeing her resolute silence, he suddenly softened his tone. "The rumors about our marital issues are affecting the company's stock price. Surely she can't ignore all this?"

He practically spat the words through gritted teeth, his eyes swirling with complex emotions. To an outsider, it might seem like he and Bianca shared some deep-seated hatred.

Evelyn recalled Bianca's parting plea and grew even more guarded. "Why should she care? Isn't this exactly what you wanted? Congratulations—you've finally kicked aside the stumbling block."

The sarcasm was unmistakable.

Vincent's expression darkened, but Evelyn stood her ground. This was a hospital, with surveillance everywhere. Any move he made would be self-incrimination.

"There's been a misunderstanding." Vincent suppressed his rage. "Dr. Carter, you wouldn't want to break up a family, would you?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Funny you should say that—I specialize in counseling such families to divorce. Didn't you know I've been divorced too?"

The counterattack caught Vincent off guard. He pressed on stubbornly, "But aren't you and Mr. Hamilton back together now?"

Alarm bells rang in Evelyn's mind.

All previous signs pointed to Vincent despising Bianca and their child. This sudden shift in attitude could only mean another scheme.

"Mr. Croix," she said bluntly, "Alexander and I truly don't know Ms. Langley's whereabouts, and we won't give you the chance to harm them."

"Who said I want to harm them?" Vincent's face twisted, his voice dropping to a growl. "This is all a misunderstanding. I'll explain it myself."

Evelyn lost all patience. "Do you really think your crimes are still secrets? Whether it's the girl you killed or Ms. Langley, who misjudged you—you're the one to blame!"

The hallway fell deathly silent.

Vincent's eyes burned with fury. "Dr. Carter, watch your words."

"What?" Evelyn met his gaze head-on. "Planning to erase me like you did your other mistakes?"
###Chapter 783: Trusting Him Again

"Miss Langley and Baby Chloe owe you nothing." Evelyn Carter met Vincent Croix's gaze steadily, though her fingertips trembled slightly. "Let them go."

Sunlight streamed through the glass window, casting Vincent's elongated, solitary shadow across the floor. He remained motionless, his eyes darkening.

Evelyn turned away, the hem of her white coat slicing through the air with finality.

At the parking lot that evening, Alexander Hamilton leaned against his car, waiting. The moment he saw her troubled expression, he opened the passenger door. "What happened?"

"Vincent came to the hospital." Evelyn fastened her seatbelt, her voice tense. "He knows the baby is at the Hamilton estate."

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel tightened, his knuckles turning white. "Did he threaten you?"

"No." She stared out at the deepening spring twilight. "But he was... different. He kept asking about Bianca's whereabouts, even though he knows the baby is safe with us."

The car jerked to a halt. Alexander turned to her. "He regrets it."

"What?"

"He regrets it," he repeated, a sharp glint in his eyes. "Just like I once did."

Evelyn's breath caught. The spring breeze carried the scent of blossoms through the window, reminding her of Bianca's parting words.

"If that's true..." She clutched the fabric of her coat. "Could he change his mind about the divorce?"

Alexander chuckled. "Bianca isn't someone easily swayed." He restarted the engine. "But the baby isn't safe here anymore. We need to move."

"We?"

"Yes." His gaze remained fixed on the road ahead. "I've already arranged for a new place."

Children's laughter drifted from the estate entrance. Evelyn suddenly remembered—it was Friday. Lily and Lotus were coming to stay for the weekend.

"Dr. Carter!" Lily ran toward them, waving a notebook, her cheeks flushed. "The pretty lady left us a note!"

The postcard bore wild, almost frantic handwriting, the final character nearly leaping off the page. Alexander recognized it instantly. "Bianca."

Beneath the address was a lopsided heart, its edges blurred as if dampened by water.
###Chapter 784: The Real Mother

The sun hadn't fully set when Alexander Hamilton and Evelyn Carter hurried out the door.

"We're meeting a friend," Alexander explained to Aunt Margaret, though his gaze drifted toward the nursery.

Evelyn crouched down, gently squeezing the baby's chubby hand. "Mommy will be back soon."

Aunt Margaret and Grace Anderson exchanged knowing smiles, silently taking over childcare duties.

The address Bianca Langley had given them led to an inconspicuous alley in the old district. Neon signs were half-hidden by ivy—Alexander's sharp eyes barely caught the name "Serenity Lounge" before they would've walked right past it.

Jazz music spilled out like liquid gold the moment they pushed open the door.

"Right this way," said Bartender Lucas, as if expecting them. He guided them through the lively main area to a secluded booth in the back.

Bianca lounged on the leather couch, fingertips tapping her glass. Her sunflower-yellow dress burned bright under the dim lights like a flickering flame.

"Perfect timing." She raised her glass, ice cubes clinking. "Try their signature cocktail?"

Alexander shook his head. "Driving."

"Virgin mojito then." She snapped her fingers, then turned to Evelyn. "Hot milk for the doctor?"

Evelyn ignored the joke, pulling out her phone. "Let's see Baby Chloe's latest videos first."

The screen lit up—Bianca's fingers trembled slightly. The little girl clung to her crib rails, babbling "Mama."

"She..." Bianca's voice caught.

"Eight months old now. Starting to talk," Evelyn said softly. "Demands bedtime stories every night. Loves Guess How Much I Love You."

Alexander spoke abruptly. "We want to be her godparents."

Bianca looked up, eyes still glistening. "That sudden?"

"Not sudden," Evelyn interjected. "These past months, we've already thought of her as—"

"I know." Bianca cut her off with a strained smile. "Of course. It's just..." She swirled her drink. "I'm taking her to Switzerland. Vincent Croix can't reach us there."

The air turned to ice.

"He's contacted you already, hasn't he?" Bianca's laugh was bitter. "Old habits die hard."

Evelyn noticed the faint tan line on her ring finger was gone.

"He turned Langley Group upside down just to flush me out." Bianca downed her drink. "Joke's on him—all those shares, properties? They're his now."

Alexander frowned. "You're just walking away?"

"What choice do I have?" Her glass hit the table with a sharp crack. "Spend my life fighting him? My parents are aging. My baby's tiny. We can't afford the gamble."

The bartender silently delivered their drinks. Evelyn cradled the warm milk, suddenly alert. "You're sure this place is safe?"

"Relax." Bianca's lips curved. "This bar's registered under someone else. Staff have been with me ten years. That narcissist Vincent still thinks I'm running."

She slid a velvet box across the table. "Her first birthday gift. Might...miss the date."

Inside lay a solid gold locket engraved with "Joy & Peace."

Alexander stood abruptly. "Need to make a call."

Once he was out of earshot, Bianca grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "Do me a favor." She pulled a document from her bag. "Keys to our Swiss house. If...if anything happens—"

"Don't say that!" Evelyn slammed the folder shut.

Bianca smiled. "Always plan for the worst. Vincent destroys what he can't have." She watched Alexander's retreating figure. "Be happy, both of you."

The jazz had shifted to Yesterday Once More without them noticing. The raspy female vocalist wove through the shadows.

Evelyn realized—this might be goodbye.
###Chapter 785: Spilled Water Can't Be Gathered Back

Alexander Hamilton frowned slightly, tapping his fingers twice against the glass. "Have your parents settled abroad? Let me know when you're leaving. I'll arrange transportation for you and Baby Chloe to the airport."

This was the furthest extent of friendship could offer.

Their glasses refracted different hues under the lamplight. Alexander suddenly stood and returned moments later with a plate of fragrant fried rice. Evelyn Carter took a small bite—the shrimp was sweet and springy.

"Well," Bianca Langley swirled her wine glass with raised brows, "since when did CEO Hamilton learn to cook? Last I saw you, coffee was your only specialty."

Alexander replied calmly, "A man must learn to be a proper husband."

Evelyn's ears turned pink, her lips leaving a faint imprint on the milk glass rim.

Watching their silent understanding, Bianca swallowed the wedding date on her tongue. Some blessings were meant to traverse mountains and rivers.

When midnight chimes sounded, the conversation turned somber.

"That girl's funeral day," Bianca's knuckles whitened, "Vincent Croix didn't even show his face. But when stocks dipped, suddenly he remembers his devoted husband act." Her冷笑 was icy. "She and I were just different chess pieces on his board."

Alexander's gaze flickered. "I thought he'd wake up sooner."

Evelyn caught the subtext—one regretting past actions, the other regretting poor judgment. Now Bianca had broken free while Vincent descended into madness.

Whiskey swirled in Bianca's glass, amber light reflecting in her eyes. "Lately he's playing the heartbroken lover among socialites—my photo in his office, telling everyone he'll salvage our marriage." She scoffed. "Someone give that man an Oscar."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. "What does he actually want?"

"Damage control for stock prices." Bianca drained her glass. "Once the storm passes, erasing this history will be his first priority."

Spring rain pattered outside as Alexander's thumb brushed Evelyn's cool fingertips. They sat in silence till dawn, none willing to mention parting first.

Bianca suddenly chuckled. "Dr. Carter's attachment to Baby Chloe I understand, but Alexander..." She deliberately drew out the pause. "Weren't you the living grim reaper who made children cry before?"

Evelyn's smile turned bittersweet. Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "Enough teasing." His gaze at Evelyn held repentance. "We..."

The unspoken words dissolved into a sigh. Evelyn turned away—raindrops streaked the window like tears.

"I'll need you to watch Baby Chloe a while longer." Bianca's abrupt statement made both their hands simultaneously grasp her wrists.

Evelyn's voice trembled. "She's so well-behaved, never fusses at night." Her lashes fluttered. "I got lost as a child—my adoptive parents gave me a second life. Some bonds..."

Warmth spread from Alexander's palm. Evelyn inhaled deeply. "Having lost a child... I cherish every moment with Baby Chloe."

Bianca clasped her cold hands. "Kindness always finds its reward." Rising, her glass clinked as she told Alexander, "Meeting Dr. Carter was your life's greatest fortune."

Night rain drummed against the window—three elongated shadows stretched across the wall.

###Chapter 786: He Finally Regretted It

Alexander Hamilton's lips curved slightly, his eyes flashing with approval.

"Well said." He gave a faint nod. "Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything. I may not be able to help with everything, but arranging lawyers or bodyguards is no trouble at all."

Bianca Langley pulled a document from her bag, tapping it lightly with her fingertip. "Actually, there's something I'd like you to handle. Next time Vincent Croix comes bothering you, just give him this."

The bold words "Divorce Agreement" leaped off the page.

Evelyn Carter accepted the file, her brow furrowing slightly. "He probably won't sign it easily now. And wouldn't this expose your whereabouts?"

"Don't worry." Bianca scoffed, her eyes brimming with disdain. "He doesn't even know what coffee I like, let alone how to find me. As for the baby—" She paused. "With you two around, he won't dare scheme anything. This agreement is just a formality. The court summons is already on its way."

The terms were shockingly generous. Aside from custody of the child, Bianca was relinquishing nearly all her rights—even willing to shoulder full blame for the marriage's collapse.

For a woman to go this far, Vincent Croix had truly set a new low for scumbags.

A week later, at dusk, Vincent appeared again outside the OB-GYN clinic.

"Dr. Carter," he blocked her path with a sinister smile, "shouldn't we have a proper talk?"

Evelyn didn't even look up. "Please register first if you need medical attention."

"This is the OB-GYN department!" Vincent's face darkened.

"Oh." Evelyn finally met his gaze. "Third floor, Psychiatry—turn right and go straight. Your current symptoms strongly suggest delusional disorder."

With the shift nearly over, nurses in the hallway sensed the tension and began gathering around.

Vincent's expression turned stormy, but he suppressed his anger. "Why play dumb, Dr. Carter? I'm here today to take my daughter."

"Your daughter?" Evelyn let out a cold laugh. "Do you even remember her birth weight, Mr. Croix? Or her favorite toy color?"

She stood, her gaze sharp as a blade. "That child might shy away from strangers, but when she sees you—" She deliberately paused. "She screams in terror. You've spent less time with her than I have as an outsider. What right do you have to demand custody?"

Struck where it hurt, Vincent dropped all pretense. "If Mr. Hamilton insists on interfering, we'll settle this in court. When this becomes public knowledge, it won't reflect well on anyone."

Blood ties were his final trump card.

Evelyn clenched her fists.

"Dr. Carter!" The head nurse was about to call security when her eyes suddenly brightened.

At the end of the hallway, Alexander approached with steady strides.

Vincent's face paled instantly, his earlier bravado vanishing without a trace.

"Mr. Croix," Alexander's voice was unhurried, "shall I repeat what I said last time?"

A simple question, yet it sent cold sweat down Vincent's back.

Faced with an insurmountable power gap, all schemes were futile.

Vincent's Adam's apple bobbed before he finally forced out, "My apologies."

His retreating figure radiated unmistakable humiliation.

Once the crowd dispersed, Alexander grasped Evelyn's icy hand. "You look terrible."

"He infuriates me." She exhaled deeply. "I can tolerate anything else, but using blood relations to manipulate a child..."

"He regrets it." Alexander's eyes darkened. "But it's too late. Bianca has completely given up on him this time."

Evelyn looked puzzled. "Didn't she already—"

"Some things," Alexander gently squeezed her fingertips, "aren't about what's said, but what's done."
###Chapter 787: New Love

If only they had realized this truth sooner, perhaps they wouldn't have missed so many beautiful moments—or lost that innocent little life.

Evelyn Carter sighed softly. "We should've walked away when Annabelle first returned."

Alexander Hamilton's breath hitched.

"That's not what I meant," he said, his voice dropping as he quickly changed the subject. "I left work early today. Mother is taking the baby swimming. I've notified Bianca to visit."

After six months apart, Alexander worried the child might not recognize her mother. He'd arranged several reunions to ease the transition.

The thought of the impending separation made Evelyn immediately set aside her work. She accompanied Alexander to the infant aquatic center.

Margaret Hamilton had chosen this private facility specifically to protect Bianca's privacy. No paparazzi would find them here.

Bianca Langley leaned against the reception desk when they entered. Her fiery red dress matched the vibrancy in her eyes as she removed her sunglasses—brighter than Evelyn remembered.

"Long time no see," Bianca waved with a smile.

This radiant woman bore no resemblance to someone embroiled in divorce proceedings. Now Evelyn understood Alexander's meaning. Bianca hadn't just moved on—she'd been reborn.

They proceeded to the pool area where Baby Chloe splashed happily in a pink float ring, watched over by doting Margaret and Auntie Marry.

Bianca thanked the elders first, then crouched to extend her hands toward her daughter.

The baby's smile froze. Her tiny lips pressed into a thin line.

Bianca's fingers trembled. "Does she...not remember me?"

"She's recalling," Evelyn murmured. "After so long apart, she needs time to adjust."

A shadow crossed Bianca's eyes as she whispered, "Sweetheart, it's Mommy."

Recognition flashed across the child's face—followed by a sudden wail. Small fists clutched Bianca's collar desperately.

Fumbling for a towel, Bianca bundled her dripping daughter. The baby's heartbreaking sobs continued even as she refused to release her grip.

"Tell her you won't leave again," Evelyn suggested softly.

When Bianca complied, the cries gradually subsided. Margaret and Auntie Marry watched with bittersweet expressions.

Alexander's hand found Evelyn's in the quiet moment.

Two weeks later, mother and daughter had fully reconnected. The day of departure arrived as scheduled.

"Flight's next week," Bianca announced, swirling her drink. Tonight marked her lounge bar's final evening—tomorrow, new owners would take over.

She slid two cocktails across the counter. "Sunset Cruiser for you—barely any alcohol. And this Painkiller for Mr. Hamilton. May it teach you love's true meaning."

Evelyn sipped the fruity, nearly non-alcoholic blend. "Your drink looks special."

"Maple Fantasy." Bianca tilted her wine glass, lips curving unconsciously. "Made with maple syrup."

Alexander had noticed her transformed demeanor since returning. Only now did realization strike Evelyn. "You went to Canada?"

"Studied there years ago. Vast and quiet—perfect for new beginnings." Bianca's eyes sparkled. "And...I met someone interesting."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "A man?"

"Yes." Bianca's smile bloomed like spring.
###Chapter 788 The Charm of a Mature Man

"This trip abroad was just meant to settle my family and take a breather." Bianca Langley swirled her glass, ice cubes clinking softly. "Never expected to run into this clueless junior at my alma mater who immediately called me 'senior.'"

A playful smile danced on her lips, eyes glinting with mirth.

Evelyn Carter caught the honeyed undertone. "What's he like?"

After the Vincent Croix debacle, character was Evelyn's foremost concern.

"Total dork." Bianca feigned disdain, yet joy radiated from her every expression.

Alexander Hamilton set down his drink. "Are you two together?"

"Not there yet." She propped her chin on her hand. "At first I just wanted to tease him—divorce papers pending, savoring that 'married-but-flirting' thrill. But then..."

She paused, her smile softening.

"Does he know about Baby Chloe?" Evelyn pressed.

Though silent, Alexander's gaze turned grave.

"I told him when he confessed." Bianca's eyes shimmered. "Guess what he said?"

Mimicking his earnest tone: "'What does that have to do with my feelings? Worried I won't step up as dad? Should I enroll in early childhood education courses?'"

Laughter erupted from the trio.

"Charming lad. Same field as you?" Evelyn asked.

"Direct junior." Bianca twirled her glass. "Only downside—he's three years younger. The year I married, he was just a freshman."

At the age gap mention, her expression flickered momentarily.

Unnoticing, Evelyn reassured, "Three years is nothing in med school."

Bianca quickly rallied, teasing, "Exactly. If Mr. Hamilton here misbehaves, I'll introduce you to some adorable younger pups."

"Drink." Alexander clinked glasses, scowling.

As they parted, Evelyn offered to see Bianca home, but was declined. Watching Bianca's solitary figure at the bar, she sighed softly.

The night breeze carried a chill.

Alexander naturally draped an arm around Evelyn's shoulders, only releasing her at the car. Buckling up, his lips curved unconsciously.

"When Bianca mentioned the age gap earlier, you seemed... pensive?" Evelyn suddenly asked.

Alexander rubbed his nose. "Vincent was also three years older than her."

He studied Evelyn's face warily, fearing she'd draw parallels to their own history.

"Age means nothing." Evelyn stared ahead. "What matters is happiness. That boy may be young, but he's responsible."

Alexander hesitated. "Though mature men have merits too... better at cherishing."

"Patting your own back?" Evelyn arched a brow.

"The secretaries keep gushing how younger men are trending." He sulked. "Couldn't exactly rebut them on the spot."

Evelyn stifled a laugh. "The mighty Alexander Hamilton eavesdropping on office girls?"

"They were chatting by the conference room." His ears flushed pink.

The following week, they were inseparable. Unaware colleagues assumed reconciliation, oblivious to the silent ache beneath their默契.

In the nursery, Evelyn meticulously arranged Baby Chloe's belongings—nightlight, plush toys, favorite storybooks—each item misting her eyes.

Alexander wordlessly brought vacuum bags, compressing fluffy pillows into flat squares. Diapers filled every suitcase crevice, no corner spared.

When he hefted the weighty luggage, his arm muscles strained. The physical burden was but a fraction of the heartache within.
###Chapter 789: Sympathy for Men Brings Misfortune

The afternoon sun lazily spilled across the courtyard of the Hamilton ancestral home.

Margaret Hamilton and Grace Anderson stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the black sedan slowly exit the gates. Their eyes were already rimmed red, but they stubbornly refused to let the tears fall.

Evelyn Carter sat in the backseat, cradling the baby tightly against her chest. The little one seemed to sense the somber mood, reaching out with chubby fingers to touch Evelyn's face.

"Don't be afraid, Auntie's here," Evelyn murmured soothingly, though her voice trembled slightly.

Alexander Hamilton glanced at them through the rearview mirror, his knuckles whitening around the steering wheel.

Their meeting place with Bianca Langley was a discreet café. When they pushed open the door, Bianca was already waiting, two steaming cups of coffee on the table.

"Let me hold her," Bianca extended her arms, her eyes glinting with complex emotions.

Alexander carefully passed the baby over, his fingertips trembling slightly during the transfer. He leaned down to press a gentle kiss to the baby's forehead, handling her as if she were the most fragile treasure.

Evelyn stood to the side, her nails digging into her palms. She didn't dare hold the baby again, afraid she wouldn't be able to control her emotions.

"Ah!" The baby suddenly stretched her tiny hands toward Evelyn, her big dark eyes filled with expectation.

A faint smile touched Bianca's striking features. "Seems she prefers you."

Evelyn could no longer hold back. She took the baby and buried her face in the soft tufts of hair. The familiar milky scent made her eyes sting.

"It's almost time," Alexander checked his watch, his voice hoarse.

Just then, his phone vibrated abruptly. The number flashing on the screen froze his expression instantly.

"Mr. Hamilton, suspicious individuals have been spotted loitering near the residential area. Should we intercept?"

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "Proceed as planned."

After hanging up, he quickly explained the situation to Bianca. The latter let out a cold laugh, pulling the baby closer.

"Vincent Croix really is relentless," Bianca's red lips curled in scorn. "Too bad I won't give him another chance this time."

The three split up swiftly in the parking lot. Bianca carried the baby into an inconspicuous sedan, while Evelyn and Alexander pushed the empty stroller toward their original vehicle.

The moment their car left the neighborhood, a black Mercedes appeared in the rearview mirror, tailing them closely.

"Just as expected," Alexander smirked, deliberately slowing down to let the pursuer keep up.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the seatbelt. "Are you sure about this?"

"Sympathy for men brings misfortune," Alexander stared straight ahead, his tone icy. "He brought this upon himself."

The two cars sped down a deserted ring road, one after the other. Suddenly, the Mercedes accelerated, cutting them off with a screeching halt in the middle of the road.

Vincent Croix stumbled out, his suit and tie askew. He pounded frantically on their window. "Bianca! Get out here!"

Alexander rolled down the window and punched him square in the face.

"Where is she?" Vincent staggered back, his gaze sweeping over the empty stroller. His face drained of color. "You tricked me?"

He whirled around to run back, but Alexander executed a sharp reverse, blocking his path. The collision sent a piercing screech through the air.

Evelyn calmly dialed emergency services. "Hello, there's been a traffic accident..."

"You!" Vincent trembled with rage, his pointing finger shaking. "Do you have any idea what you've done?"

Alexander leisurely adjusted his cuffs. "Mr. Croix, hit-and-run cases make headlines. You... wouldn't want to be in the news again so soon, would you?"

The sunlight illuminated Vincent's contorted face, revealing the madness and despair in his eyes. In the distance, a silver airplane ascended slowly into the blue sky.
###Chapter 790: The Only True Wrongdoer

"The court verdict is final."

Alexander Hamilton's voice was icy, each word piercing Vincent Croix's heart.

Vincent's knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel. The torn judgment papers still seemed to flutter before his eyes. He'd spent the night preparing appeal materials with his lawyer, only to receive news that Bianca Langley was leaving the country.

"Mr. Hamilton," Vincent sneered, "I heard you and your wife divorced once too. Now you're meddling in other people's affairs?"

Evelyn Carter kept her eyes on her phone, her fingers tapping lightly. Bianca had promised to message them once she landed safely. By now, the plane should have taken off.

Alexander's gaze turned frigid. "We're not the same. At least I never got anyone killed."

The words struck Vincent like a knife. The image of that girl's tragic death flashed before his eyes again.

By the time traffic police arrived, Vincent's face was dark with fury. He scribbled his signature on the settlement form and sped toward the airport.

The departure hall echoed with flight announcements.

"Sir, may I see your boarding pass?" A staff member blocked Vincent's reckless charge.

Vincent seemed not to hear until police officers approached. He halted abruptly, steadying himself against the service counter as he stared at the empty runway.

Bianca's last photo showed her and their daughter smiling like sunflowers.

For months afterward, Vincent vanished without a trace.

One evening, Alexander walked hand-in-hand with Evelyn after dinner. In the twilight, he chose his words carefully: "Vincent is still searching for Bianca."

Evelyn stopped mid-step. "What does he want? He ignored their child completely before. Now he's playing the devoted father?"

Alexander hesitated.

"Just say it."

"That manager Wang from the Langley Group died in a car accident last week."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Falling out among thieves?"

"He was Bianca's ex-boyfriend." Alexander's voice grew heavy. "Made some inappropriate comments at a dinner. Vincent force-fed him broken glass on the spot."

Evelyn suddenly remembered the drunkard Alexander had once held underwater. She gasped. "You mean—"

"We're... somewhat alike." Alexander smiled bitterly.

"No." Evelyn's voice was steel. "No child needs that kind of father. Bianca is happy now. That's what matters."

The night breeze carried away her unspoken words.
###Chapter 791: The Way to a Woman's Heart

Baby Chloe had just turned one, her memory still a blank slate. Bianca Langley and her new boyfriend could easily keep their secret hidden if they chose to.

As night deepened, Alexander Hamilton spoke abruptly, "I wonder if the baby's awake now. It's early morning in Canada—time for her feeding."

Back at the old estate, he used to rise before dawn—mixing formula, changing diapers, barely pausing to breathe. Now that the baby was back with Bianca, sleep eluded him.

Evelyn Carter gazed absently out the window.

"I used to worry constantly—checking on her multiple times each night, afraid she'd be cold or hungry. Now that I don't have to, everything feels... hollow."

She didn't regret her decision. But this strange, fleeting emotion left her momentarily adrift. Alexander stood silently beside her, his expression unreadable.

With the heart failure patient stabilized, Evelyn finally had time off. Vivian Dempsey chose a newly opened fusion restaurant to celebrate them both overcoming recent challenges.

They'd always favored that private kitchen before. The change of scenery felt unfamiliar yet oddly exciting.

Vivian noticed immediately, teasing, "See? Variety isn't so bad. Men are like restaurants—you've got to sample a few before finding your perfect match."

She pushed a bowl of tom yum soup toward Evelyn. The spicy-sour broth exploded authentically on the tongue, but Evelyn still preferred the coconut sticky rice before her.

Vivian already knew the answer but pressed anyway, "I heard Alexander's been sending you meals daily?"

"He's been swamped. His chef prepares them," Evelyn answered truthfully.

"You're making excuses for him now!" Vivian slammed her palm on the table.

Evelyn sighed. "The way to a woman's heart..."

Vivian groaned. "You're trapped. They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach—turns out it works both ways."

She consoled herself, "At least compared to scum like Peter Harrison, Alexander's halfway decent."

Evelyn caught the edge in her voice. "What happened?"

Vivian viciously speared a shrimp. "That bastard Vincent Croix! Thinking I'm connected to the Langleys, he's been sabotaging me everywhere!"

The shrimp disintegrated under her fork. Fuming, she detailed Vincent's recent moves—expanding her network had made her exceptionally well-informed.

"He withheld my payment, so I went to collect it myself. Then he had the nerve to threaten me over the phone!" Her entire body trembled with rage.

Evelyn winced. "I should've warned you sooner."

"Not your fault," Vivian waved it off. "Better he comes after me than harasses you at the hospital. If not for Miss Langley's sake, I'd have exposed all his dirty secrets across the business district!"

Setting down her chopsticks, Evelyn relayed Vincent's recent activities precisely. Though blunt, Vivian kept confidences impeccably.

"He's like a rabid dog now," Evelyn sipped her lemon water. "If he discovers Bianca's whereabouts... who knows what he'd do."

Vivian's smile turned icy. "He'd better give up soon. Otherwise—" She left it hanging, but her eyes said everything.
###Chapter 792: Collective Grief

Evelyn's fingertips absently traced the rim of her teacup.

Whenever she thought about Vincent Croix and Bianca Langley, her chest tightened as if weighted by a stone. That ominous premonition clung to her like the eerie calm before a storm.

"That bastard belongs in hell!" Vivian slammed her palm on the coffee table, making the lemon slice in her glass bob violently.

Evelyn parted her lips, then swallowed her words. Even she couldn't conjure a single justification for a man like Vincent.

"Remember what I said about Alexander? That belated affection is cheaper than weeds?" Vivian's laugh was bitter. "Turns out that's too generous for Vincent. His performative remorse is more toxic than arsenic."

Her glass hit the table with a sharp clink.

Wiping her mouth, Vivian suddenly lowered her voice. "You know what the socialites are whispering about him now?"

Evelyn looked up.

"Those snobbish ladies finally agree on something." Vivian's smirk was razor-thin. "They say Bianca was doomed the moment she married him."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her cup.

This rare sympathy from privileged women was merely collective grief. None could guarantee they wouldn't become the next Bianca.

"If she could do it over—" Evelyn murmured.

"There are no do-overs." Vivian cut her off. "Marriage is a high-stakes gamble. Rather than betting your life on a man, why not make your own fortune? Imagine being surrounded by handsome young men later."

She half-closed her eyes, already envisioning the scene.

Evelyn shook her head. "Wake up. I need to ask you something serious."

"About Vincent's first love?" Vivian's expression sobered instantly.

Evelyn nodded. "Bianca asked me to check on her before leaving. That girl... her story is tragic."

The air grew heavy.

"I know bits." Vivian's voice dropped to a whisper. "Vincent later showered her with apartments, cars, affection. But only after securing his position."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine.

Meaning Vincent had neatly disposed of his first love while pursuing Bianca. The calculation behind it was horrifying.

"I have the cemetery address." Vivian pulled out her phone. "Socialite gossip networks outperform detective agencies."

Evelyn noted the address, planning to leave at dawn.

Alexander insisted on accompanying her. He'd been working late nights just to clear his schedule.

Lying awake in the silent mansion, Evelyn often found sleep elusive.

The master bedroom felt cavernous. Sometimes she'd wake at midnight and drift to the study door. Seeing light seep through the crack inexplicably soothed her.

Tonight, she overheard Alexander's phone call again.

"...Only the finest incense.
Prepare premium offerings.
And osmanthus—
I know it's out of season. Source it from the south.
Cost is irrelevant. Deliver by morning..."
###Chapter 793: The Nameless Tombstone

The sweet scent of osmanthus drifted through the window as Alexander Hamilton stirred a pot of congee in the kitchen. He remembered how Andrew Anderson had loved this fragrance, so he'd planted two trees in the courtyard specifically for him.

Evelyn Carter stood at the corridor's bend, watching his careful movements as he skimmed foam from the simmering porridge. Her throat tightened. She turned away, only discovering the bouquet of dew-kissed osmanthus by the entryway the next morning.

"Thank you," she murmured.

Alexander's fingers paused on his tie. A resigned smile touched his lips. Three years had taught him to accept her polite, distant gratitude.

Pine trees whispered in the cemetery wind. Evelyn knelt before her father's memorial, fingertips tracing the polished sandalwood plaque. No matter how diligently the staff cleaned, she needed to brush away nonexistent dust herself.

"Dad, I'm doing well." Her voice was feather-light, like when she'd tiptoed around her night-shift father as a child.

Alexander retreated ten paces, his gaze snagging on a distant figure in funeral-black. Vincent Croix moved deeper into the cemetery, sunglasses obscuring half his face.

"What is it?" Evelyn followed his stare but saw only swaying shadows.

"Vincent." Alexander's jaw tightened. "He's been too quiet lately."

They melted into the pines. Vincent knelt before an unmarked tombstone, polishing the flawless marble with his sleeve. Removed sunglasses revealed bruised eye sockets.

"I dreamed of you," he whispered to the grave. "You were right. I should've seen my own heart sooner."

Evelyn clutched Alexander's sleeve. The tombstone glared back, devoid even of a name.

"Bianca was correct," she breathed. "He never understood love."

Alexander's expression darkened. Once, people had compared him to Vincent. The memory now tasted like bile.

After Vincent left, they placed white chrysanthemums before the blank stone. Evelyn's pale face reflected in its surface.

"Should we identify her?" Alexander asked.

Evelyn shook her head. "Don't alert Vincent. Men like him..." Her unfinished thought hung between them.

During the drive home, Evelyn stared out the window. Alexander tapped the steering wheel. "You're worried about me."

Not a question.

Her lashes fluttered. She didn't deny it.

The study lamp burned past midnight. When Evelyn entered with an international parcel, Alexander was mid-conference call. She silently unwrapped brown paper. A postcard fluttered from the photo album—Baby Chloe in yellow overalls, wobbling upright by a coffee table. Bianca's red nails peeked from the background.

On the last page, two interlocked hands filled the frame.

Both froze.

"Seems..." Alexander shut his laptop. "Bianca's moved on."

Evelyn traced the unfamiliar man's fingers in the photo, suddenly recalling the nameless grave. Some desperately erase traces of existence, while others never earn the right to carve their names at all.
###Chapter 794: Matching Diamond Rings

The sudden hand was noticeably larger than Bianca Langley's, with distinct knuckles and a healthy tan complexion. The neatly trimmed, rounded nails spoke of someone meticulous. But what truly caught the eye were the dazzling matching diamond rings adorning their intertwined fingers.

Evelyn Carter's gaze lingered on the rings, her lips curling into an unconscious smile. She knew exactly what those rings signified.

"Wonderful," she murmured.

Alexander Hamilton stood beside her, his eyes also fixed on the rings. No one understood better than him how arduous Bianca's journey had been.

"Indeed," he said, his voice warm with satisfaction before shifting topics. "By the way, Bianca invited us to Canada."

He handed her a postcard adorned with red maple leaves. The handwriting on the back was neat, every word brimming with lightness.

Evelyn took the postcard, her fingertips brushing lightly over the paper. "The hospital actually has an exchange program in Canada. I was planning to send Olivia Lightfoot."

Alexander's eyes brightened. "So we could go together?"

"What about your company—"

"Don't worry," he interrupted smoothly. "Everything's arranged."

On the day of departure, Evelyn finally understood what Alexander meant by "arranged."

The entire delegation's tickets had been upgraded to business class, and their accommodations were exclusively five-star hotels. The murmurs among the doctors speculated about the sudden generosity from the hospital director.

Evelyn quietly put on her headphones, pretending to sleep. She could feel Alexander's gaze beside her—soft enough to melt ice.

By the time the plane landed, it was past midnight. To her surprise, Bianca had brought her baby and her new fiancé to meet them.

"Over here!" Bianca waved enthusiastically. Beside her stood a man with thin-framed glasses, one hand pushing a stroller, the other holding a welcome sign.

Evelyn's eyes immediately found the baby in the stroller. The little one's hair had grown longer, tied into adorable pigtails, and she was babbling happily at them.

"May I hold her?" Evelyn's voice trembled slightly.

Bianca laughed. "You're her godmother. Why even ask?"

Evelyn carefully lifted the baby into her arms. The sweet scent of milk clung to the child, and when her soft cheek pressed close, Evelyn felt her heart melt.

Alexander stood nearby, his gaze shifting between Evelyn and the baby. Suddenly remembering something, he turned to the man beside Bianca.

"Congratulations," he extended his hand.

The man adjusted his glasses, smiling shyly. "Thank you. Miss Langley speaks of you both often."

Bianca looped her arm through her fiancé's. "Let's get you to the hotel first. Tomorrow, we'll take you to see the maple leaves—they're at their most beautiful now."

The baby yawned in Evelyn's arms, tiny fingers clutching her collar tightly. When Evelyn kissed her forehead, the little one giggled instantly.

Watching this, Alexander's throat moved. Silently, he gathered their luggage closer, making more room for Evelyn and the baby.

Under the airport lights, their four shadows stretched long. The two pairs of rings gleamed brilliantly, like silent promises.
###Chapter 795: Clearly Head Over Heels

Alexander Hamilton stood quietly to the side, his gaze tenderly fixed on the heartwarming scene of Evelyn Carter bonding with the baby. Only when Evelyn reluctantly let go did he eagerly reach out, carefully cradling the little one in his arms.

Adrian Valentine adjusted his glasses, watching the interaction. If he didn’t know the truth, he’d have sworn Alexander was the child’s biological father.

Baby Chloe giggled happily in Alexander’s arms, her tiny fingers playfully tugging at the cufflinks on his shirt sleeve, completely at ease with him.

"You like these?" Without hesitation, Alexander unfastened the cufflink and handed it to her. "Here, you can play with it."

Bianca Langley couldn’t resist teasing, "Well, well, my daughter’s hit the jackpot. With a godfather like Mr. Hamilton, she’s going to be spoiled rotten."

Alexander, still focused on entertaining the baby, replied seriously, "Spoiling is fine, but boundaries are essential. A girl should be raised with love, but she must also learn to protect herself."

Evelyn smiled knowingly before turning to Adrian. "And you are…?"

The young man before her was the polar opposite of Vincent Croix—sunny, bookish, and with eyes that couldn’t hide his adoration whenever they landed on Bianca.

"Dr. Carter," Adrian said shyly, clutching the welcome sign. "Bianca’s told me so much about you and Mr. Hamilton. Thank you for always looking out for her and the baby."

"Friends do that for each other," Evelyn replied, noticing how his gaze never strayed far from Bianca. "What should I call you?"

Bianca nudged Adrian’s shoulder. "Off-topic again. She asked for your name."

"Oh!" He flushed, adjusting his glasses. "I’m Adrian Valentine, studying photography at the University of Toronto. I graduate next month, and then Bianca and I are returning home to get married."

His eyes sparkled as if already envisioning their future happiness. In the stroller, Baby Chloe babbled and waved her tiny hands, seemingly sensing his joy.

The bustling airport wasn’t the best place for a reunion. Alexander had planned to call for a company car, but Bianca insisted Adrian drive to show off his skills, so he didn’t protest.

No one expected the mild-mannered Adrian to drive like a man possessed. With a sharp drift around a corner, everyone in the car—except for Baby Chloe, safely shielded by Bianca—lurched sideways.

Instinctively, Alexander wrapped an arm around Evelyn. "Mr. Valentine, have you raced before?"

"Just a hobby," Adrian admitted with an embarrassed laugh. "Not professional-level, just for fun now and then."

The answer earned Adrian a bit more of Alexander’s respect—adventurous yet measured. No wonder he and Bianca made such a good match.

The hotel suite was spacious and bright, a welcome fruit basket resting on the coffee table. Evelyn immediately set to work boiling water to sterilize bottles, moving in perfect sync with Bianca as she rummaged for formula.

Meanwhile, Alexander began changing the bedding with linens he’d brought from home. Adrian watched, stunned, as his glasses slid down his nose.

"You’re only staying a week, right?" he whispered. "This looks like you’re moving in."

Alexander shook out a sheet. "Dr. Carter has professional-grade cleanliness standards. Even the best hotel linens don’t compare to home."

Adrian nodded thoughtfully, then glanced toward the living room to ensure Bianca was out of earshot before lowering his voice. "Mr. Hamilton, can I ask you something? About… him."

Alexander paused mid-motion. "Didn’t Bianca explain everything?"

"No, no," Adrian quickly waved his hands. "I was just curious…"

But his stiff posture and reddening ears betrayed his nerves.

Alexander understood. He clapped a hand on Adrian’s shoulder. "Worried she’s not over Vincent yet?"

The room fell so quiet they could hear the maple leaves rustling outside.

Adrian pushed up his glasses. "The first time I saw Bianca was in the university’s maple grove. She stood there alone, her silhouette so fragile it hurt to look at—but when she turned around…" His lips curved unconsciously. "She was dazzling, like autumn leaves. I thought she was a freshman and rushed over to introduce myself."

A love-at-first-sight story. Alexander recalled the red maple postcard and suddenly understood Bianca’s choice.

"Don’t worry," he said firmly. "She named her daughter ‘Baby Chloe’ instead of the name Vincent chose. That decision says everything."

Adrian exhaled deeply, the light returning to his eyes behind his glasses.
###Chapter 796: Life's Unfair Comparisons

"You mentioned bringing her back to the country for marriage. That won't work." Alexander Hamilton tapped the table lightly with his fingertips. "She's already liquidated all her domestic assets. Returning would be pointless. Besides, Vincent Croix is still searching for her."

Adrian Valentine's brow furrowed slightly as his fingers absently traced the rim of his glass.

Alexander assumed he was reluctant to leave his life back home and was carefully choosing his words when Adrian spoke: "Personally, I don't mind. But Mr. and Mrs. Langley—though they've adjusted here—still long for their homeland."

The response made Alexander raise an eyebrow.

He hadn't expected Adrian to be so considerate, especially toward Bianca Langley's parents.

"You've met them already?" Alexander's tone carried subtle meaning. Memories of his own grueling trials with Evelyn Carter's parents surfaced, making Adrian's progress seem meteoric in comparison.

Adrian's ears tinged pink. "More or less. They know I'm serious about marrying Bianca and urged us to get engaged first." His weekly visits with Bianca to see her parents had planted the idea of a hometown wedding.

The Langleys were cultured people who could live comfortably in Canada. Yet leaving their homeland—first from the capital to Hudson City, now across oceans—left them wistful.

Adrian noticed and wanted to fulfill their wish.

After a thoughtful pause, Alexander said, "Hudson City is out, but the capital could work." In Vincent's current state, he wouldn't dare make waves there. As for wedding-crashing? Alexander dismissed the notion. Bianca would never give him the chance.

Adrian's eyes brightened, but before he could thank him, Alexander shifted topics: "The Langleys are settled. What about your parents—"

A crisp clink of glass interrupted from the living room.

Bianca was tilting her head back, taking a swig of ice-cold beer. Evelyn Carter sat frozen, clutching a thermos that had mysteriously filled with steaming red date tea, its sweet aroma wafting through the air.

"Health kick?" Bianca leaned in, tapping the thermos with a mischievous grin. "Prepping for something?"

Evelyn played dumb and countered: "Just storing up energy for wedding planning."

Bianca's smile faded slightly. "We might not hold it here after all."

Evelyn's heart skipped. Baby Chloe was scaling her sleeve, tiny feet planted on her knees, babbling as she tried to clamber onto the couch.

"It's about the location." Bianca sank lazily into the sofa, her curls glowing honey-gold in the warm light. "I've lost my taste for weddings. The last one was extravagant enough—my photos hung in the studio for two years."

She mentioned Vincent with the detachment of discussing a stranger.

"This time, I don't even want the marriage license. Adrian only agreed to postpone that, but regarding the ceremony..." She shook her beer can. "We're at an impasse."
###Chapter 797: Missing That Spark

Every couple has disagreements—that's perfectly normal.

What's truly terrifying is that polite distance, when you can't even be bothered to argue.

Just like Evelyn and Alexander's stagnant marriage in the past.

"Have you talked about this?" Evelyn asked softly. "You two seem great together."

Bianca rubbed her temples. "Not yet. Being with him feels so effortless—I don't want to ruin that."

She thought she'd hidden it well, but the scars from her failed marriage still lingered.

Evelyn understood that feeling all too well.

Memories flooded in like a rising tide.

The moment was interrupted as Alexander and Adrian returned to the living room.

Adrian grabbed two beers from the fridge, handing one to Bianca before settling beside her.

Though they hadn't been together long, their默契 was already evident.

Alexander took the baby from Evelyn's arms with practiced ease, as if he'd done it a thousand times before.

That comfortable familiarity of longtime partners.

Yet missing the electric spark of new love.

Bianca saw right through Alexander's little act and rolled her eyes dramatically.

Adrian took a swig of his beer and suddenly announced, "I've been thinking—if you don't want a big wedding, we could just have an intimate gathering back in Hudson City."

Clatter.

Bianca's beer can hit the floor.

"But...you were so excited about the wedding?" Her voice trembled slightly.

She bent to retrieve it, only to collide with Adrian.

"You okay?"

Flustered, he pressed the icy can directly against her cheek.

Evelyn couldn't help laughing.

Alexander met her gaze, amusement dancing in his eyes.

These two were a riot—life would never be dull with them around.

"Freezing!" Bianca snatched the can and retaliated by smacking it against Adrian's face.

Soon they were wrestling like kids.

"Keep it PG," Alexander tapped the armrest pointedly. "There's a child present."

The baby waved tiny fists excitedly, wanting to join the fun.

Bianca arched a brow. "Someone's jealous?"

Adrian rushed to explain, "I actually asked Mr. Hamilton for advice."

"About what?"

"I worried you didn't want to return to H City because...he's there. Mr. Hamilton suggested Hudson City instead."

Bianca burst out laughing. "You're still stuck on that?"

Adrian's ears turned crimson. "I just...I really need to know why you said yes to me."

Alexander's eyes narrowed.

That wasn't what the kid had said earlier!

Evelyn bit back a smile, patting Alexander's shoulder as he scowled.

He sighed, the corner of his mouth quirking up.

Fine. As long as she's happy.

Bianca didn't mince words in front of them: "You didn't think I agreed because you remind me of Vincent, did you?"

The room temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

Evelyn knew this topic all too well.

Alexander stiffened.

Adrian looked between them nervously. "Did I say something wrong?"

Bianca gave Alexander a meaningful look. "Do all you men have such active imaginations?"

"Just him," Alexander said firmly.

Adrian blinked in confusion.

Bianca simply smiled.

Some things were better left unsaid.

Alexander would gladly bury that chapter of his life forever.

But Evelyn said calmly, "You didn't. Everyone is unique."
###Chapter 798: The Love She Thought Was Real

The night was deep.

Baby Chloe slept soundly in Alexander Hamilton's arms, the living room bathed in the warm glow of a single wall lamp.

Evelyn Carter took a sip of water and said simply, "I was once someone's substitute."

Alexander's expression froze. His Adam's apple bobbed.

Adrian Valentine nearly dropped his teacup.

Bianca Langley interjected smoothly, "Don't look so tense. They're fine now, aren't they?"

Adrian hesitated.

Bianca suddenly asked, "Do you know why I lost my composure when we first met?"

He shook his head.

"Vincent Croix used the same excuse—mistaking me for an alumna." She twisted the ring on her finger. "Later, I learned his first love was his true childhood sweetheart."

Her smile turned bitter. "And I was just a stepping stone for his ambitions."

Adrian grabbed her hand. "I really was there to film an assignment!"

Moonlight filtered through the sheer curtains, making their diamond rings glitter.

At four in the morning, Evelyn saw them to the door.

"Stay the night. The guest room is ready."

Bianca shook her head. "We need to see my parents. To discuss the engagement."

Adrian's eyes lit up. He dashed out like a whirlwind to start the car.

Watching his eager retreat, Bianca turned to Evelyn. "Could you look after Chloe for a few days? We have preparations."

Evelyn and Alexander nodded in unison.

Noon sunlight flooded the bedroom.

Evelyn blinked awake to find Alexander gazing at her with amusement.

"Eleven-thirty?!" He bolted upright.

They scrambled through their routines. Alexander ordered takeout while knotting his tie, Evelyn grabbing her coat as she rushed out.

"I'll drive you." He tucked a sandwich into her bag.

When the medical conference ended that afternoon, Alexander waited at the hospital entrance with Chloe.

"You rented a car?" Evelyn opened the back door.

"Borrowed from the branch office." He adjusted the rearview mirror. "Took Chloe to inspect operations."

Her hand paused mid-tickle. "You brought her to the company?"

"I said she was a friend's child." He shrugged. "My tabloid reputation precedes me."

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Tomorrow's headline: Hamilton heir secretly married with child."

"Saves us an announcement." Smiling, he turned the wheel, guiding them down streets gilded by sunset.
###Chapter 799: Culinary Disaster

Alexander's voice carried a lighthearted tone.

How he wished the baby was truly his and Evelyn's.

The three-day medical exchange program had concluded. Now began their free time before returning home on the seventh day.

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains when a knock sounded at the door.

Bianca stood outside with Adrian, their fingers tightly interlaced, looking even closer than before.

"Thought you two would be out on a date," Bianca teased, peering into the room. "Didn't expect you'd stay in."

Alexander opened the door impassively. "If we weren't here, who'd let you in?"

Adrian held an elegant paper box with a shy smile. "Senior made these cookies herself. We'd love for you to try them."

Bianca tugged Adrian inside. "Stop scowling. We're actually here to deliver this." She waved a gilded card. "Our engagement ceremony tomorrow—under that maple tree where we first met."

Evelyn accepted the invitation curiously. "You decided so quickly?"

"Three days is plenty," Bianca declared confidently. "The campus is public. Booking a weekend spot was easy."

Adrian carefully untied the box's ribbon. "It's her first time cooking. The shapes are...unique, but the taste is wonderful."

Inside lay neatly arranged charcoal-black lumps barely recognizable as cookies.

Alexander studied them, brow furrowing.

Evelyn squinted. "Are these...chocolate chip?"

"Butter cookies!" Bianca huffed. "Adrian ate almost the whole tray! Said they tasted great despite the color."

Alexander's gaze at Adrian turned reverent. Finishing that tray wasn't love—it was a complete lack of taste buds.

Evelyn reached to try one, but Alexander intercepted. "Let me."

His expression froze upon biting in. Forcing it down, his voice strained. "Have you tasted these?"

"Not yet." Bianca looked eager. "Well?"

Evelyn took a bite. Her smile stiffened instantly.

This culinary atrocity proved Bianca had a rare...talent.

"Tastes fine to me." Adrian ate another, genuinely puzzled.

Bianca hesitantly sampled one and grimaced. "What is this abomination?!"

Just then, Baby Chloe grabbed a cookie and stuffed it in her mouth.

"Waaah—" The infant burst into tears, face scrunching up.

Alexander swiftly lifted her, patting her back. "Spit it out. Now."

Bianca paled. "Oh no...I promised homemade cookies for tomorrow's guests!"

"Can you cancel?" Evelyn worried.

Adrian shook his head. "Invitations are sent. Changing plans now would be rude."

Alexander spoke suddenly. "The hotel kitchen's fully equipped." He glanced at Evelyn. "You can bake, right?"

"You're the expert here," Evelyn countered meaningfully.

Bianca brightened. "Then we're counting on you!"

Adrian kept happily munching the disastrous cookies, oblivious to everyone's horrified stares.
###Chapter 800: You're Not Going Anywhere

"Me?" Alexander Hamilton frowned slightly, his gaze lingering on Evelyn Carter's face.

He had indeed learned to bake Chinese tea pastries from Auntie Wu and even showcased his skills in front of Evelyn before. But preparing dozens of cookies in such a short time was an unreasonable demand.

Bianca Langley had already grabbed his hand excitedly. "Perfect! Homemade treats are the most reassuring. See you tomorrow!"

She and Adrian Valentine still had a mountain of preparations, so they hurried out without giving Alexander a chance to refuse.

The next morning, Adrian distributed plainly packaged cookies to guests gathered around the maple tree. No one knew these were the results of Alexander and Evelyn's all-night baking session.

Alexander watched as Evelyn's handmade cookies were handed out, his heart twisting like a cat's scratching post. Only when he noticed the faint smile on her lips did that reluctance gradually fade.

The engagement ceremony took place under the red maple tree where Bianca and Adrian first met. This century-old tree bore witness to their love—not only were all invited guests present, but even passersby paused to offer blessings, touched by their happiness.

After the ceremony, the cookie table was piled high with return gifts. The entire event had been planned in record time, perfectly reflecting Bianca's free-spirited nature—guests weren't expected to give monetary gifts but could receive party favors simply by offering congratulations.

Locals found this arrangement perfectly normal, but some Chinese guests felt uncomfortable arriving empty-handed. Some left red envelopes, others small presents.

Among them, one plush toy stood out conspicuously.

Bianca's expression darkened the moment she picked it up. Finding a loose thread near its ear, she gave a gentle tug—the toy immediately fell apart.

A diamond ring the size of a pigeon's egg rolled out from the stuffing, along with a note that read: "Waiting for you."

The gift sent chills down everyone's spine. Bianca could almost hear Vincent Croix's icy voice whispering in her ear—You're not going anywhere!

Without hesitation, Adrian threw both the toy and ring into the trash, gripping her cold hands. "Don't be afraid. It's over between you two. He can't hurt you anymore."

"I know," Bianca replied weakly, unable to muster even a forced smile.

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged glances. Though there was no proof, they were certain this was Vincent's doing. Unfortunately, whoever delivered the gift had long since disappeared.

"Hiring professionals like this means Vincent is truly desperate," Alexander said darkly. "Someone must have tipped him off from back home."

Just as he suspected, Bianca's sudden exposure in Hudson City wasn't accidental. This place was no longer safe.

Adrian squeezed Bianca's hand tighter. "We'll face this together. Now that we're engaged, he has no right to harass you."

Bianca gave a strained smile. His naivety was both touching and frustrating.

Evelyn and Alexander had already warned her about Vincent's frantic search back home. She wasn't afraid—just disgusted at the thought of him.

How could she have been so blind?

Seeing her distress, Adrian suggested, "Should we return to Hudson City first? Even if he tracks us here, he'll find nothing."

As a student yet to graduate, his thinking was inevitably simplistic.

Bianca sighed. "He's scum, but not stupid. If we all leave, he'll immediately guess we've returned. It might buy some time, but not much."

"Leave it to me," Alexander said, his voice laced with frost.

He'd stayed up all night baking those cookies in the hotel kitchen just to avoid disappointing Evelyn. Now Vincent not only sent that ominous gift but also took the cookies Alexander personally made—this was unforgivable.

Alexander made a call under the tree. When he returned, his expression had subtly shifted.

Noon sunlight filtered through maple leaves, casting dappled shadows on him. The hesitation in his eyes told Evelyn everything—this was about Vincent.

"Hold my bag for me," Evelyn suddenly said.

For Bianca's casual engagement, she'd brought a large backpack for convenience—the kind that could easily be hung in a restroom.

Understanding immediately, Alexander took the bag and followed her toward the academic building.

Coincidentally, Bianca's professor arrived for a reunion, keeping her and Adrian occupied long enough not to notice their departure.

Once they reached the flower beds beside the building, Evelyn cut straight to the chase. "What's Vincent up to now?"

"That 'again' is spot-on," Alexander quipped, indicating the situation wasn't dire.

"I anticipated this. Had some friends restrict his cash flow—financial firms fear liquidity issues most. It worked initially. But I just got word he's 'on a business trip.'"

Vincent traveling wasn't unusual, but his employees' evasiveness about his whereabouts raised alarms. At least he hadn't appeared at the engagement—there was still room to maneuver.

Remembering that eerie plush toy, Evelyn felt a shadow cross her heart. "Who else would do such a thing? If it was really his doing, he's probably almost here."
###Chapter 801: He Has a Plan

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

She stood abruptly. "Vincent won't let this go. I need to warn them!"

Alexander caught her wrist. "Easy. Bianca knows Vincent better than anyone. As for Adrian..." He paused. "Some lessons must be learned firsthand."

"But it's too dangerous!"

"Vincent's a rabid dog now." Alexander's eyes darkened. "The divorce is final, his appeal denied. He'll take it all out on Bianca. If he learns she's remarrying..."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "So Adrian's suggestion..."

"Might be our best move." Alexander tapped the table. "Strike first. Catch him off guard."

Remembering Bianca's concerns, Evelyn frowned. "What if—"

"I have a plan." Alexander cut in, a sharp glint in his eyes.

Noon sunlight glinted off the hot pot restaurant's glass door.

Bianca and Adrian had booked their favorite spot. The Chinese owner boasted authentic Chongqing broth flown in weekly. Bianca had frequented it during grad school until even the owner became a friend.

"Full private booking rates today!" Bianca slapped her card on the counter. "Consider it our engagement favors."

The owner chuckled. "Since when do engagements need favors?" Yet he produced a red silk-wrapped box from under the counter. "My wedding gift to you both."

Inside nestled porcelain figurines—a bride and groom smiling at each other. Bianca traced the glaze when she realized Adrian was gone.

"Adrian?" Her pulse spiked as she scanned the room.

The door swung open. Alexander entered with Adrian close behind. Adrian's damp bangs suggested a lengthy discussion.

"Daddy!" Baby Chloe rushed him in her white tulle dress and flower crown—a tiny Cupid.

Alexander's throat moved. Evelyn squeezed his hand. "How did it go?"

"Better than expected." Alexander kept his voice low. "Young, but clear-headed. Most importantly—" He watched Bianca doodling glasses on the figurine. "He'll compromise for them."

Evelyn hesitated. "But if Vincent—"

"Adrian grew up on a military base." Alexander interjected. "His father's a retired officer."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn.

Steam blurred faces around the bubbling pot. Bianca suddenly raised the figurines. "Look! Don't they resemble us?"

The porcelain couple chimed as they touched.

Departing guests carried the scent of hot pot into daylight. Evelyn squinted. "First lunchtime hot pot engagement party."

"Like it?" Alexander leaned against a lamppost. "We could take notes."

Evelyn smiled. "First meal back home then. But mild broth."

They playfully planned their entire return menu.

"Excuse me." Bianca approached with Adrian, waving her phone. "Which flight? I want him traveling with you."

Adrian adjusted his glasses, lenses flashing white.
###Chapter 802: Wolfish Ambition

Evelyn turned her phone screen toward Alexander, displaying the flight details.

"We're returning with the medical team," she said softly.

Bianca arched an eyebrow. "Perfect. Adrian can go with you."

Without hesitation, Adrian pulled out his phone, fingers flying across the screen. Moments later, he looked up. "Only one seat left."

Evelyn frowned. "Then Miss Langley, you—"

"I'm staying." Bianca's voice was steel. "If Vincent dared to send a ring to my engagement party, he'll dare to cause more trouble. I want to see what else he's got up his sleeve."

Alexander's gaze darkened. "Too risky."

Adrian glanced at Bianca, speaking only after receiving her subtle nod. "We've discussed it. I'll take Baby Chloe first. Vincent's target is Bianca—he won't come after us."

Evelyn noticed Adrian's clenched fist. This usually gentle man now had an uncharacteristic sharpness in his eyes.

"He wouldn't dare touch me." Bianca's laugh was icy. "The Langley Group is in his hands now. He's too busy consolidating power. Chasing after me? Just his wounded male pride."

She remembered the day she gave birth, hemorrhaging on the operating table while Vincent chose to meet a client. Later, he'd played the innocent victim. Now that she'd truly let go, he couldn't seem to.

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged a glance, reaching silent understanding.

"The godparents will be at the wedding on time," Alexander said.

The day before departure, the four brought Baby Chloe to the Langley family's countryside villa. Nestled away from the city, its windows opened to lush green mountains.

When Bianca's parents saw Alexander, a flicker of light passed through their clouded eyes.

"Mr. Hamilton..." Mr. Langley's hands trembled as he poured tea, his white hair glaring under the sunlight.

Alexander accepted the cup. "Uncle Langley, just call me Alex."

Mrs. Langley studied Adrian. The young man was so nervous he'd called her "uncle" instead of "aunt," yet it warmed her eyes. Compared to Vincent—once flawless and impossible to fault—this clumsy sincerity felt infinitely more reassuring.

Amid the fragrant steam, Mr. Langley suddenly wept. "I was such a fool... How could I ever..."

Bianca squeezed her father's hand. "Dad, it's over."

Adrian quietly offered a handkerchief. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting dappled patterns on the tea table. Outside in the wooded hills, a sparrow took flight toward the boundless blue sky.
###Chapter 803: A Heart's Rebellion

The plane touched down at Hudson International Airport. Evelyn Carter gazed out the window at the familiar skyline and exhaled softly.

Alexander Hamilton observed her expression and wordlessly handed her a glass of warm water. "Tired?"

"I'm fine." She accepted the glass, her eyes drifting to Adrian Valentine and Baby Chloe in the back row.

Adrian was expertly feeding the infant, his movements practiced beyond his early twenties. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a gentle glow around him.

"Mr. Valentine," Evelyn turned to face him, "have you thought about what we discussed?"

He looked up, his eyes clear behind his glasses. "Dr. Carter, I've decided. My parents left me an old house in the west district. I'll take Chloe there first."

Alexander frowned slightly. "The security there isn't ideal."

"I know." Adrian patted the baby's back. "But it's home. And..." He hesitated, a shy smile appearing. "I want Bianca to have a real home when she returns."

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged a glance.

"Mr. Valentine," Evelyn chose her words carefully, "you're so different around Miss Langley."

Adrian's ears turned pink. He stared at the sleeping infant, his voice barely audible. "I know I'm awkward... But when I see her, I can't control myself."

Alexander suddenly chuckled. "You've known Bianca for a while, haven't you?"

Evelyn looked at him in surprise.

Adrian's fingers absently traced the edge of Chloe's blanket. "Yes. I first saw her work in my professor's collection. Those mountain landscapes... The composition was alive. I wanted to meet her ever since."

"So it was love at first sight?" Evelyn asked.

"No." He shook his head. "It grew over time. Every meeting made me love her more."

A brief silence settled over the cabin. The baby smacked her lips in sleep, tiny fingers clutching Adrian's collar.

"We're here." Alexander glanced outside. "Stay with us at the estate for a few days?"

Adrian opened his mouth to refuse when Chloe stirred awake. Her round eyes locked onto Evelyn, and she immediately reached out with grabby hands.

"Someone doesn't want to leave her godmother." Alexander raised an eyebrow.

Evelyn's heart melted. She took the baby, who snuggled into her embrace with satisfaction.

Watching them, Adrian hesitated. "Maybe... a few more days? I need to arrange the house and contact the wedding planners in Seaview City."

"Of course." Alexander agreed easily. "Grandmother will enjoy having Chloe around."

As they exited the airport, the setting sun stretched their three shadows long across the pavement. The baby giggled, one hand tangled in Evelyn's hair, the other yanking Alexander's tie.

"This child..." Evelyn shook her head fondly, making no move to stop her.

Adrian stood aside, suddenly speaking up. "I prepared a surprise for Bianca."

"Oh?"

"At the place we first met." His smile turned bashful. "You must come on our wedding day."

Alexander nodded in understanding. "We'll be there."

When they parted, Chloe's face crumpled with impending tears. Evelyn quickly knelt, pressing her forehead to the baby's. "Sweetheart, godmother will visit tomorrow."

Adrian fumbled with the crying child until Alexander produced a colorful pinwheel from his pocket, finally distracting her.

"That girl..." Evelyn watched the departing taxi with an empty feeling.

Alexander pulled her close. "Missing her already?"

"Yes." For once, she admitted it freely. "Do you think Adrian can really take care of her?"

"Don't worry." His gaze deepened. "He's more capable than we think."

During the drive home, Evelyn remained distracted. Alexander suddenly took her hand. "What's on your mind?"

"I was wondering..." She spoke softly. "Does love really change who we are?"

After a pause, Alexander pressed her palm against his chest. "Can you feel my heartbeat?"

She froze.

"It races every time I see you." His voice turned rough. "My heart doesn't obey me either."
###Chapter 804: I'll Hold Up the Sky for You

Adrian Valentine hesitated, his words stuck in his throat. His concern wasn’t about whether Baby Chloe would adjust—the little girl had immediately warmed up to them. What weighed on him was the thought of preparing for the wedding alone. His upcoming trip to Oceancrest would take at least two weeks, and he worried about burdening them.

Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton, however, didn’t give him a chance to voice his worries. With shared understanding, they practically ushered him into the car. Their eyes met, brimming with uncontainable joy.

The ancestral home was filled with the rich aroma of fish maw hotpot. Margaret Hamilton and Grace Anderson hurried to the door at the sound of arrival, but their faces lit up the moment they saw the baby.

"Sweetheart, do you remember Grandma?" Grace cooed softly.

The baby tilted her tiny face upward and let out a cheerful "Oh," her smile blooming like a little flower.

Margaret tentatively reached out to touch her cheek. When the baby didn’t shy away, her heart swelled with happiness. Still haunted by the memory of making her cry last time, they’d learned their lesson—letting the little one settle in first.

But Baby Chloe was a natural social butterfly. She scrambled onto the sofa, and with a playful "Meow," Peanut the Ragdoll cat leaped up beside her. In seconds, the two were lost in their own world.

"Has Miss Langley given the baby a new name yet?" Margaret suddenly asked.

The living room fell silent. Evelyn and Alexander exchanged glances. Bianca Langley had once declared she would erase everything tied to Vincent Croix—including the baby’s original name. Now, with her new fiancé in the picture but the wedding still pending, the child’s name remained in limbo.

Alexander cleared his throat. "Mom, I think 'Baby' is a lovely nickname. It carries the meaning of being treasured."

The simple moniker unexpectedly won unanimous approval. Even Anthony Taylor and Teresa Taylor, who dropped by later, adopted the name.

While the adults were at work during the day, the four elders doted on the baby, filling the house with lively energy.

Teresa gazed at the little face and couldn’t help sighing, "If only she were our own grandchild."

The sentiment echoed in everyone’s hearts. Once Bianca’s wedding was over, the baby would be taken away. So whenever Evelyn returned from work, she was met with the elders’ unspoken, longing looks.

"Having a child around makes the house so lively," Margaret murmured wistfully.

"Evelyn used to run around the yard with Annabelle when they were little—such a delightful pair," Grace added.

Anthony and Teresa were more cautious, only daring to reminisce about Evelyn’s childhood antics. "You were smaller than Peanut back then, but so clever..."

Evelyn understood their unspoken wish. That Friday, she deliberately invited Lily and Lotus Waters over to play. The three children’s laughter in the yard finally diverted the elders’ attention.

But Lily’s words on the way home sent a chill down Evelyn’s spine.

"A strange brother showed me a photo and asked if I recognized the pretty lady—Baby’s mom. I said I didn’t remember," Lily said, blinking her big eyes. "Lotus said he didn’t know either."

Evelyn immediately pulled up a picture of Vincent. Lily nodded. "That’s him, but he looked angrier in the photo."

Her fingers turned icy. After dropping the children back at the ancestral home, she rushed straight to Alexander’s office.

His expression darkened as he listened. Vincent’s so-called business trip was likely a ruse—he probably already knew Bianca hadn’t returned to the country.

"Don’t be afraid," he said, interlacing his fingers with hers. "If the sky falls, I’ll hold it up for you."

Evelyn let him squeeze her hand. "I’m not worried about myself. I’m afraid Adrian might run into him. Thankfully, he’s already in Oceancrest."

Adrian posted daily updates on social media to reassure everyone. Bianca liked every single one, showering praise on the photos he took. The passion for photography that marriage had once extinguished was now reignited through Adrian’s lens.

Suddenly, Evelyn understood: some people enter our lives solely to correct the mistakes fate has made.
###Chapter 805: Strike the Fatal Blow

"I've already stationed people in Harbor City." Alexander Hamilton's eyes turned icy as his knuckles tapped lightly on the desk. Vincent Croix actually dared to target a child—a sharp glint flashed in his gaze.

Three days later, Vincent finally made his move at a cocktail party.

Alexander arrived alone, standing tall under the crystal chandelier in his tailored suit. Vincent approached with champagne in hand, his smile sickeningly fake.

"Mr. Hamilton, long time no see." Vincent raised his glass, malice lurking beneath his pleasant tone.

Alexander didn't even touch his drink. "Been busy lately, Mr. Croix? Even children aren't off-limits?"

Vincent's smile faltered before he feigned innocence. "I don't follow. I was merely concerned about my wife and daughter's safety. If I've offended—"

"Forgotten the divorce papers you signed already?" Alexander cut him off. "Yet you remember the Langley Group's name perfectly."

Vincent's grip whitened around his glass, the liquid trembling. "The company will always bear the Langley name. Bianca is just upset—she'll come back."

Alexander scoffed. The marital home stood empty, Bianca having left nothing of Vincent's behind. Yet here he was, deluding himself.

"She burned all your photos." Alexander's words struck like daggers.

Vincent's eyes reddened as he lowered his voice. "My daughter... is with the Hamiltons, isn't she?"

Alexander took a sip of wine, expression unreadable. Vincent was unhinged—they had to keep him away from Adrian at all costs.

As tension crackled between them, an acquaintance interrupted with small talk. Alexander instantly shifted back to effortless composure, the earlier confrontation erased.

Returning home late, he found a single wall lamp glowing in the living room. He crept upstairs, catching the faint scent of baby lotion outside the nursery door.

Evelyn Carter opened it quietly, finger to her lips. Moonlight filtered through the sheer curtains, illuminating their little one sleeping soundly, tiny fists curled.

"You've been drinking?" Evelyn frowned.

Alexander loosened his tie. "Ran into Vincent."

Her pupils constricted. The humidifier's mist swirled between them, casting her face in deepening shadows.
###Chapter 806: The Persistent Ghost

"He hasn't dared to harass me at the company recently, but he's gone completely off the rails." I stirred the ice cubes in my coffee cup. "Rumor has it he's renovating that wedding house again."

"Wedding house?"

Evelyn's fingers paused slightly.

"Didn't Bianca mention it?" I scoffed. "She smashed that place to pieces. Almost burned the whole house down with the wedding photos."

Bianca had told me all this herself.

Alexander had grown close to Adrian during his time in Canada. Though this was his first time hearing about the fate of the wedding house, his expression remained unfazed.

"That's Bianca for you," he said calmly. "When she loses her temper, even she's afraid of herself. But Vincent..."

He hesitated. "He's been making a lot of threats lately, but I think that's all he's capable of."

"Oh?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Is he still delusional?" I let out a derisive laugh. "He should've realized at the airport—Bianca isn't the same girl he could push around anymore."

Hurt only matters if the other person still cares.

Bianca had long erased Vincent from her heart.

"He claims Bianca will change her mind the moment she sees him." Alexander shook his head. "No idea where he gets that confidence."

Meanwhile, Vincent shivered in his empty office.

He was wealthy beyond measure, yet he had nowhere to call home.

The apartment he'd gifted his first love, the villa where Bianca had lived—both made him restless.

As if something irreplaceable was missing...

In the end, he simply moved into his office.

Apart from money, he had nothing.

When the morning sun peeked through the curtains, Bianca found an envelope on her doormat.

No postmark, no shipping label.

She was relieved her parents hadn't seen it.

Bending down to pick it up, she slung her camera over her shoulder and headed for the woods.

Passing a trash bin, she hesitated.

"Rip—"

As the envelope tore open, a diamond ring clattered to the ground with a crisp sound.

Far more extravagant than the one she currently wore.

Bianca smirked, ignoring the letter inside, and tossed it into the bin.

Before leaving, she made sure to stomp hard on the ring.

At dinner, a sudden knock echoed at the door.

Mr. Langley immediately stood up. "I'll call the police—"

Last time in China, Vincent's men had ambushed them, leaving them on edge.

Now they'd fled abroad—why was this ghost still haunting them?

"Dad, it's fine." Bianca pressed his hand down. "It might be a package from Adrian."

She didn’t want her parents worrying about her again.

Hearing Adrian's name, Mr. Langley relaxed. "Don’t you young people just video call these days? Still writing letters?"

Mrs. Langley teased, "What do you know? Photographers love this kind of romance."

Bianca forced a smile and hurried to the door.

She pressed her ear against it, confirming silence before opening.

No one was there.

Only the morning ring, lying undisturbed.

The dent on the band was gone, the diamond glittering under the light.

A chill ran down Bianca's spine, but she picked it up anyway.

She knew—no matter how many times she threw it away, Vincent would find a way to return it.

Back at the table, she finished her meal calmly, excusing herself to rest.

Once her parents were done, she checked the time and dialed Evelyn.

"Ring—"

Alexander answered. "Evelyn's washing up. Need something?"
###Chapter 807: Evelyn, He's Gone

Alexander Hamilton's voice was still hoarse from sleep. He cradled the baby attempting to stand in her bassinet with one hand while holding a bottle in the other, his phone wedged between shoulder and ear.

The awkward position distorted his tone.

Bianca Langley fell silent on the other end.

Had she called at a bad time?

Alexander's brow furrowed at the sudden quiet. "What's wrong? Evelyn's freshening up."

"Oh..." Bianca quickly changed subjects, about to suggest hanging up when his voice softened abruptly.

"It's Bianca—she needs to speak with you urgently—"

The rest faded as he clearly turned to address Evelyn. Moments later, the phone changed hands.

"It's me," Evelyn's crisp voice came through.

Though their acquaintance was brief, the two women had bonded instantly. Bianca explained her situation concisely before stating, "I need your help. I refuse to keep this ring, but confronting him directly is out of the question. It should be returned to its rightful owner."

"You can't possibly see him now. Returning to Hudson City would be dangerous and disrupt your plans with Adrian." Evelyn's concern was palpable.

Bianca gave a mirthless chuckle.

"Exactly why I need your assistance. The thought of facing him makes me physically ill. An eye for an eye."

If Vincent Croix dared threaten her, he'd taste his own medicine. Only her need to remain hidden necessitated Evelyn's involvement.

Understanding immediately, Evelyn said, "Just mail us the ring."

Alexander, finally freeing his neck, interjected, "Postal service is too slow and unreliable for something this valuable. Someone from our regional office is coming for meetings—they can hand-deliver it."

Two days later, Alexander received the ring during a corporate conference. Without hesitation, he instructed his security team to deliver it to Vincent under cover of the most ominous midnight hour.

No one witnessed Vincent's reaction upon receiving the ring, but Bianca's spirits lifted considerably upon hearing the deed was done.

Evelyn found the method somewhat juvenile, yet considering Vincent's atrocities against Bianca and their daughter, she deemed it fitting retribution.

Days of tranquility passed, unbeknownst to all that this was merely the calm before the storm.

True to his word, Adrian Valentine prepared everything in Seaview City within two weeks. He personally designed every wedding detail, even refining his proposal speech repeatedly before calling Alexander and Evelyn.

"Mr. Hamilton, Dr. Carter, thank you for caring for Chloe these weeks. We'll properly express our gratitude once Bianca arrives." His voice brimmed with unrestrained joy.

On speakerphone, the three conversed.

Evelyn offered sincere blessings: "Don't get so carried away you forget to notify the bride. A wedding without its leading lady would certainly be... memorable."

Their previous engagement ceremony had been unconventional enough. With Bianca's parents attending this time, tradition was preferable.

Adrian's laughter rang through the line.

"Bianca knows—she's booked a flight for the morning after tomorrow. We'll reunite within two days. I've also invited the aunt who raised me, making this both families' formal introduction. Finally, I'll have a real family."

His lifelong yearning for belonging was palpable.

Alexander and Evelyn readily agreed, adjusting their schedules for the trip to Seaview City after confirming details.

Yet before dawn the next day, an unknown number shattered the peace.

Alexander nearly declined the call to avoid waking Chloe, but the infant abruptly startled awake wailing.

"Shh, sweetheart..."

He abandoned the phone as Evelyn roused to help soothe their distraught charge.

The call eventually disconnected unanswered. Just as they thought the disturbance had passed, the same number rang again.

Wrong numbers don't redial so persistently.

With the baby's cries escalating, unease coiled around the couple.

Evelyn took a steadying breath before answering. "Hello?"

A young female voice spoke over emergency room clamor.

"Hospital calling. Do you know Adrian Valentine? His phone was destroyed in an accident—we found your number in his call log. Please come immediately—"

"Understood." Evelyn hung up with forced composure, relaying the news to Alexander.

"Adrian's been in a car crash—critical condition. Given my hospital experience, this call is undoubtedly legitimate. His situation must be dire."

Alexander acted decisively.

"Evelyn, Chloe needs you here, and this is no environment for an infant. Stay—I'll book the earliest flight."

He dressed hastily, departing without luggage.

Evelyn's heart pounded with foreboding, yet she knew additional presence wouldn't help. Clutching the weeping child, she promised, "We'll be fine."

The baby cried relentlessly, only succumbing to exhaustion half an hour after Alexander left.

Evelyn considered informing Bianca, but with Adrian's condition uncertain and the trans-Pacific journey lengthy, she reluctantly postponed.

At ten a.m., Alexander finally messaged. His voice, ravaged by sleeplessness and travel, carried unbearable weight:

"Evelyn... Adrian didn't make it."
###Chapter 808: The Suspicious Accident

Adrian Valentine's death struck Bianca Langley like a dagger through her nearly perfect life.

The engagement ring still gleamed on her finger. The wedding photo proofs had just been selected. Happiness had been within reach—until fate revealed its cruel face.

Evelyn Carter's fingers turned white as she gripped her phone.

"Bianca is bringing her parents back tomorrow," she said, her voice tight. "Telling them now would be too cruel. But waiting until they return..."

Alexander Hamilton took her trembling hand. "I'll make the call."

"No." Evelyn shook her head. "I'm a doctor. Delivering death notifications... I have more experience."

Yet when Bianca's name lit up her screen, Evelyn's breath still hitched.

"Sorry, I was busy earlier," she said hoarsely.

Silence stretched for several seconds.

Bianca's voice was raw. "Evelyn, I can't reach Adrian."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palm.

"He never turns off his phone..." Bianca's words grew faint. "Did something happen?"

Evelyn opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

"I woke up suddenly tonight," Bianca continued, as if afraid of the answer. "Broke that porcelain figurine on my nightstand..."

Adrian's engagement gift to her.

Evelyn closed her eyes. "Miss Langley... Adrian was..."

The sound of shattering porcelain came through the line.

"Half an hour ago... car accident... didn't make it..."

A muffled sob, then utter silence. Evelyn knew Bianca was clamping a hand over her mouth, refusing to let her parents downstairs hear her cry.

"Thank you..." The call ended.

Alexander's call came through immediately. "The traffic police say this wasn't an accident."

Evelyn's pulse jumped. "Not a coincidence?"

"The driver turned himself in, but the details are suspicious." Alexander's voice was grave. "Adrian was hit, then deliberately run over multiple times."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. "This was murder."

"The driver insists it was drunk driving." Alexander paused. "But the doctors confirmed Adrian held on until the very end..."

Right when Bianca had woken in terror.

A thought struck Evelyn. "Where's Vincent Croix been lately?"

"I checked. He's at a Macau casino." Alexander's tone turned icy. "But this... is far from simple."

Drunk drivers don't circle back to crush their victims. Unless someone wanted Adrian dead at all costs.
###Chapter 809 The Man Before Her

Alexander Hamilton shook his head. "The police are still interrogating him. We can't see him yet. But I'll keep waiting here."

His voice was hoarse, his eyes bloodshot.

Evelyn Carter's heart clenched at his exhausted appearance. Adrian Valentine's sudden death had made her realize how fragile life was. Instead of worrying about the future, she should cherish the present.

The man who had stayed up all night for her was the one she should treasure most.

"Don't worry about me." Alexander seemed to sense her emotions, softening his tone. "Get the baby settled first. Be careful on the road."

The next morning, Evelyn rushed to Hudson City.

Alexander stood at the airport arrival gate waiting for her, his shirt wrinkled, dark stubble shadowing his jaw. She had never seen him look so haggard.

"How long has it been since you slept?" she couldn't help asking.

"Caught some rest in the car." He rubbed his temples before getting straight to the point. "The driver was definitely drunk, but his attitude was strange."

His brow furrowed as he recalled the middle-aged man's icy gaze—unnaturally cold for someone who'd been intoxicated.

"He's willing to pay compensation but hasn't offered a single apology." Alexander's voice lowered. "I suspect there's more to this."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "Could Vincent Croix be involved?"

"All evidence points to a standard drunk driving case." He sighed. "Unless we find direct proof, it'll be hard to investigate further."

They walked in silence to the hotel, waiting for Bianca Langley's arrival.

Bianca came alone.

She wore a bright red dress, her makeup flawless, yet she moved like an empty shell devoid of spirit. Evelyn noticed her painted lips trembling slightly.

"Should we rest at the hotel first?" Evelyn asked gently.

Bianca nodded mechanically. "I'm fine. I'm okay."

She'd repeated those words endlessly throughout her journey.

Alexander tactfully excused himself from the room. Evelyn handed Bianca a glass of water, noticing her hands shook so badly she could barely hold it.

"Do you want to see him?" Evelyn whispered.

Bianca's pupils contracted violently. Her mouth opened, but only a stifled gasp escaped.

"Crying might help," Evelyn said, holding her ice-cold hands. "When my father passed, I thought staying strong meant not crying. But—"

Before she could finish, Bianca began trembling violently, like a snapped string. She gripped Evelyn's arm desperately, her nails digging in.

"He promised to come back..." Bianca's voice shattered. "He said he'd give me and the baby a home..."
###Chapter 810 Haven't You Already Known the Answer?

Evelyn Carter's words trailed off as Bianca Langley lifted trembling hands to cover her face.

A stifled sob escaped through her fingers.

The usually bold and decisive Bianca now resembled a helpless child. The fragile facade she'd maintained throughout the journey crumbled completely.

"Is he really... gone?"

Her question hung in the air like a blunt knife slowly carving through everyone's hearts.

After a weighted pause, Evelyn spoke softly, "Haven't you already known the answer?"

Bianca's body jerked violently.

The last shred of desperate hope from the flight evaporated instantly. Not a nightmare. No miracle. Adrian Valentine was truly gone forever.

"Impossible..." Bianca's eyes flew open, her voice raw. "He was an expert driver—even had racing credentials. How could..."

Her fingers twisted the fabric of her dress unconsciously, knuckles bleaching white.

"He didn't even own a car here! Something's wrong..."

Bianca surged to her feet, only to stagger as a wave of dizziness hit her.

Evelyn caught her immediately. "When was the last time you ate?"

"Doesn't matter..." Bianca shook her head, gaze unfocused.

Evelyn firmly guided her back to the sofa, pressing a glass of water into her hands before retrieving chocolate from her bag—prepared earlier by Alexander Hamilton. "Eat this first. You're still alive. That's what matters most right now."

Bianca chewed mechanically as silent tears streaked down her face.

"He promised those porcelain figurines would reunite..." Her whisper floated like a feather. "But now his is shattered..."

Alexander stood in the corridor, his second cigarette nearly burnt out when the door opened.

Bianca emerged wearing a deep red dress—the exact shade of maple leaves when she first met Adrian. The vibrant hue seemed painfully bright against her pallor.

The morgue occupied the hospital's sublevel, its chill gnawing through clothing.

"Your relation to the deceased?" The attendant asked cautiously.

Bianca's lips curved unexpectedly. "His wife."

When the drawer slid open, an icy gust rushed out. Alexander instinctively shielded Evelyn.

Bianca reached to touch Adrian's face but recoiled from the cold.

"Where are his glasses?" she demanded suddenly. "He can't see properly without them."

The attendant hesitated before silently retrieving the effects bag. Through the translucent material, distorted shapes of personal items were visible.

Emerging upstairs felt like rebirth.

On a garden bench outside, Bianca's shaking hands struggled with the sealed bag.
###Chapter 811: It Was Him After All

Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton exchanged a glance before silently taking seats on the bench beside Bianca Langley.

Alexander had intended to share his findings, but the sight before him made him swallow his words.

The truth could wait, but this fragile moment of peace wouldn't last.

As the drawstring bag opened, a porcelain figurine resembling Bianca tumbled out, landing on the bench with a delicate chime. The tiny statue bore dried bloodstains—black and jarring—yet remained miraculously intact.

Alexander had witnessed the crash site firsthand.

The mangled front of the vehicle, Adrian Valentine's lifeless body. Who could've imagined this fragile keepsake he carried would survive unscathed?

Bianca's trembling hands retrieved another pouch from her bag. She poured out the fragments, painstakingly assembling Adrian's likeness piece by piece. The two figurines stood side by side, a perfect pair.

Everything else in the bag had been obliterated—even the glasses were shattered beyond recognition.

The sunlight grew harsher as Bianca's face turned paler. Staring at the figurines, she spoke abruptly: "He was murdered."

Evelyn had heard her theory before.

Alexander met Evelyn's gaze, then said quietly, "The driver confessed. He won't talk, but we found leads. Do you want to see him?"

Bianca's hollow eyes stared ahead, her voice raw. "Go on. How much worse can it get?"

Evelyn grasped her icy hand.

"The car was stolen," Alexander stated. "Terminal illness. Drunk driving suicide attempt. Hitting Adrian was accidental."

"But the owner's identity is suspicious—Vincent Croix's classmate."

The name hung in the air like poison.

Bianca shuddered, her lips twisting into a grotesque smile. "I knew... it was him."

No concrete evidence existed, yet the answer screamed at them.

Alexander waited for her to wipe her tears before continuing: "The trail ends here. The owner reported the theft two months ago. Police hit dead ends. Driver won't budge."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Two months ago—before anyone knew about Bianca and Adrian. What had Vincent been plotting then?

The realization chilled her to the bone.

"Stop investigating." Bianca's tears fell freely. "Vincent only cares about profit. Anyone in his way dies."

Evelyn and Alexander stayed silent. They'd witnessed Vincent's cruelty firsthand. A man who'd abandon his own child was capable of anything.

The trio went to collect Adrian's belongings.

His phone was destroyed beyond repair, only call logs retrievable. The wallet—Bianca's love token—now served as a relic.

"He gave me this." Bianca touched her wristwatch, its hands frozen in time.

Evelyn supported her swaying frame. Since receiving the news, Bianca hadn't eaten or drunk a thing.

She recognized this brink-of-collapse feeling well. Had Alexander not been there when her father passed, she might've shattered too.

Alexander drove back in silence.

At the hotel, an unexpected figure made all three freeze.

Vincent Croix stood waiting outside their door.
###Chapter 812 Meaningless Words

Bianca Langley's pupils constricted violently.

Her gaze locked onto the familiar figure at the end of the hallway. Her fingertips trembled uncontrollably.

"How dare you show your face here?"

She jerked her arm away from Evelyn Carter's supportive grasp. Her stilettos struck the marble floor in rapid succession. Before Vincent Croix could react, a sharp slap cracked across his cheek.

The crisp sound echoed through the corridor.

Passing guests stopped to stare at the attractive couple. Some pulled out phones. Others whispered excitedly, speculating about a dramatic cheating scandal.

But what happened next defied all expectations.

Bianca's handbag smashed into Vincent's head. The metal clasp left a bloody gash on his temple.

"Have you lost your mind?" Vincent clutched the wound as blood seeped between his fingers. A dark glint flashed in his eyes before morphing into wounded innocence. "I came here personally to see you. What more do you want—"

Smack!

Another vicious strike landed.

The studs on her purse left tiny blood droplets on his cheek. The crowd gasped. Someone rushed to find security.

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Alexander Hamilton before intervening.

Evelyn wrapped her arms around Bianca's shaking body while Alexander swiftly confiscated the decorative planter she'd been raising—a potential weapon in her furious hands.

"Go ahead!" Vincent stepped forward instead of retreating, thrusting his bleeding forehead toward her. "Smash my skull if you dare! You only care about that dead man anyway!"

The words ignited Bianca's rage like gasoline.

She wrenched free from Evelyn's embrace, nails digging into her palms. "You think I won't?" Her voice scraped like broken glass. "You know exactly how Adrian Valentine died!"

Vincent's expression froze momentarily.

He absently touched his facial wounds, studying the blood on his fingertips. The ghost of a smirk flickered before he schooled his features into pained remorse.

"I know you hate me." He pulled a velvet box from his suit pocket. "That's why I brought this."

The lid sprang open, revealing the familiar diamond ring glinting coldly under the lights.

Bianca's stomach twisted violently.

When she spotted the wedding band still on Vincent's ring finger, nausea clawed up her throat. She swatted the box away, sending it arcing through the air before crashing against the wall.

"Don't touch me!" Her words hissed through clenched teeth. "Every time I remember standing before that priest with you, I want to carve those memories out and burn them!"

Vincent scrambled to retrieve the ring. When he straightened, genuine panic flickered in his eyes before being replaced by carefully crafted sorrow.

"I was wrong." His voice trembled. "Mailing the ring overseas was unforgivable. But that plush toy was my last memento. When I heard about your engagement to someone else, I finally understood..."

He paused, as if choosing his words deliberately.

"Maybe my heart betrayed you from our wedding day onward."

The confession oozed sincerity, his breathing rhythm perfectly calibrated. Evelyn frowned—his acting surpassed even Annabelle Taylor's skills.

Bianca suddenly laughed.

The sound resembled metal scraping against shattered glass—harsh and hopeless.

"Betrayal?" She lifted her chin slowly. "You mean when I caught you celebrating another woman's birthday during my pregnancy? Or when you ignored my calls during my hemorrhaging labor because some client mattered more?"

Vincent's face cycled through expressions.

His fists clenched until nails bit into flesh. Poisonous memories coiled around him, but he quickly recomposed himself.

"I'm sorry..." His voice rasped.

"Shut up!" Bianca cut him off sharply. "Every apology from you makes me sick."

A vein pulsed at Vincent's temple.

He inhaled deeply, suppressing his fury. Noticing Alexander's vigilant stare from the corner of his eye, he gritted his teeth discreetly.

"Fine." He retreated a step, raising both hands. "If you don't want to hear it, I'll stop."

The hallway plunged into tomblike silence.

Only the rolling sound of the ring on the floor remained—like one prolonged sigh.
###Chapter 813: Men Understand Men Best

"At least let me see our daughter?" Vincent Croix's voice carried a pleading tone. "I've failed as a father since her birth. Isn't it reasonable to want to make amends now?"

Bianca Langley clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. If not for their child, she'd have strangled this hypocrite on the spot.

"Still not as unreasonable as your attempt to erase that mistake," she sneered.

Vincent's knuckles whitened around the ring he held. "That was said in anger. Did I ever harm our baby afterward?"

"Anger?" Bianca scoffed, suddenly exhausted by this futile argument. "The last shred of hope I had for you died when you blamed our child for that girl's death. You're not just a liar—you're a coward!"

That girl had died believing Vincent was divorced. Discovering she'd been the other woman—and pregnant—she'd chosen the quietest exit: pesticide.

Vincent's mask cracked. "Must you provoke me like this? I kept it from her to protect you! I almost—"

"Almost faced the truth?" Alexander Hamilton cut in, his voice glacial. "You're just mourning your shattered fantasy. Had that girl lived, you'd still be playing house with both women."

The verbal strike hit its mark. Vincent turned ashen.

Evelyn Carter shot Alexander an appraising glance, surprised by his surgical precision.

"Mr. Croix," she said calmly, "you've never cared about anyone—only your 'CEO' title. Without the Langley family connection, you're nothing."

Bianca laughed bitterly. "Men truly understand men best. Alexander, why not spell it out clearer?"

Alexander shook his head slightly. "Enough."

He refused Vincent even a sidelong glance, as if the sight polluted his vision.

Vincent burned with jealousy. How could Alexander stand beside Evelyn while he was reduced to a clown? He grabbed Bianca's wrist. "I do care about you!"

"And?" Bianca wrenched free, her gaze dripping with revulsion.

"You came back because you can't forget me, didn't you? We can start over—raise our daughter together—"

"Fine," Bianca smirked coldly. "First confess everything you've done. Then I'll decide whether to slap you or send you to prison."

Panic flashed across Vincent's face. "I've done nothing! I only came to Coastal City hearing you're getting married—"

Bianca lowered her lashes. Adrian Valentine's death would likely remain an unsolved mystery.

"You look upset," Vincent pressed closer. "Is it because of me?"

Evelyn nearly gagged at his narcissism.

"Sorry, I'm nauseated." Bianca tightened her grip on the cloth bag, the two porcelain figurines inside pressing painfully into her palm. Adrian's was already shattered—like her heart.

Vincent kept babbling, but she'd stopped listening.

"I'm done with your lies." She turned toward her room. "From now on, I won't believe a word you say."

Evelyn swiftly produced the keycard. Alexander stepped between them, blocking Vincent. Security guards nearby discreetly withdrew.

Just as the tension seemed to ease, Bianca suddenly collapsed forward.
###Chapter 814: Stronger Than Anyone

An unconscious body is dead weight. Evelyn Carter swiftly reached out to catch Bianca Langley's collapsing form, but the momentum nearly sent her stumbling forward.

Alexander Hamilton reacted instantly, steadying Evelyn by the waist. As he moved to assist Bianca, Vincent Croix charged forward.

"Don't touch her!" Evelyn slapped Vincent's reaching hand away. "You're not welcome here, Mr. Croix."

The open guest room door became an invisible boundary.

Vincent's expression darkened. Since marrying into the Langley family, no one had dared speak to him this way. "You—"

Evelyn stood firm before Bianca, refusing to yield.

Alexander's gaze turned glacial, his knuckles cracking faintly.

The tense standoff shattered when Bianca's weak voice cut through.

"Leave." Her back remained turned, the word barely audible.

Vincent stiffened. "What did you say?"

"LEAVE!" Bianca's sudden scream tore from her throat, her entire body trembling.

The epitome of grace, she'd always maintained composure even in anger. This was the first time she'd ever used such language.

Blood welled where Vincent's palm crushed the diamond ring. After a sharp inhale, he turned with a thunderous expression. "Fine. I'll wait until you've calmed down."

No one acknowledged his departure.

Darkness pulsed at the edges of Bianca's vision. She tried to force her usual composure, but the world swallowed her whole.

White. Blinding white greeted her upon waking.

Disoriented, Bianca's fingers found the drawstring pouch beside her pillow—final proof Adrian Valentine was truly gone.

"Feeling better?" Evelyn asked softly. "The doctor said it was low blood sugar compounded by emotional distress. The IV fluids should help."

Bianca traced the porcelain figurines inside the pouch. "Thank you...but I don't think I'll recover."

Her attempt at a smile twisted into something more tragic than tears.

"You will." Evelyn clasped her icy hand. "In the ambulance, you clung to these figurines like a lifeline. I believe he's still watching over you."

Bianca shut her eyes as tears streamed past her temples.

"Tears are useless..." Her voice scraped raw. "I need to break this pathetic habit."

"You're the furthest thing from pathetic." Evelyn gently wiped her cheeks. "Surviving this long makes you incredibly brave."

Bianca suddenly gripped Evelyn's wrist. "This is all my fault... If I hadn't mentioned Seaview City, he wouldn't have returned—"

Her nails dug into Evelyn's skin unnoticed.

"Alexander's contacted data recovery specialists," Evelyn redirected. "The phone can't be fixed, but we salvaged all the files."

Night pressed against the windows. Bianca stared at her reflection in the glass as another wave of grief crested.

Evelyn retrieved her phone. "We need your help. Adrian's apartment keypad has one attempt left—we didn't want to risk it."

The only lifeline she could offer.

Bianca's lashes fluttered, but even lifting a hand seemed impossible.
###Chapter 815: How Could She Move On

Evelyn Carter gently pressed the bed adjustment button, raising the headrest with care. She fluffed a pillow and carefully placed it behind Bianca Langley's back.

"Is this more comfortable?" she asked softly.

Bianca's fingers finally loosened their grip on the cloth bag, her knuckles white from clutching it too long. She set it on the bedside table with slow, deliberate movements—as if placing down a priceless treasure.

It was her last tangible connection to the past, yet also the most painful reminder she couldn't bear to face.

The suffocating silence in the hospital room pressed down like a weight. Just as Evelyn searched for words to break it, Bianca spoke first.

"Do I look terrible now?"

Her voice was feather-light.

Bianca had always been radiant, her expressive eyes once captivating countless admirers. Now, those same eyes were hollow—like a stuffed doll emptied of its filling.

Evelyn opened her mouth, then closed it. She'd never been good at lying, and now words failed her completely.

"You just... need rest."

Bianca attempted a smile that looked more like a grimace. "Dr. Carter, even your comfort sounds painfully honest."

Her trembling hand lifted. "Give me a mirror. Or my phone. I can't look for too long."

Evelyn's heart ached.

If Adrian Valentine had left even a single word behind—just one—perhaps Bianca could have found something to hold onto. But he'd left so suddenly, without even a chance to say goodbye.

How could she ever move past that?

Silently, Evelyn unpacked the thermal bag Alexander Hamilton had brought. Inside were three neatly arranged containers of steaming porridge with accompanying side dishes. She placed one within Bianca's reach.

Compared to Vincent Croix's flashy takeout, Alexander's thoughtful preparation spoke volumes.

Bianca mechanically lifted a spoonful of porridge to her lips. She couldn't taste it—she was only eating to gather strength for what lay ahead.

The three of them ate dinner in heavy silence.

Outside in the hallway, a man in a tailored suit paced relentlessly. The scratches on Vincent's face had scabbed over, making him appear even more sinister.

He waited and waited, but Alexander's group showed no signs of leaving. Finally, he stalked away in frustration.

Three years ago, that secondhand car had been bought with his scholarship money. Back then, Bianca hadn't known who he was. During a hiking trip, she'd simply pointed at him and declared, "I want to ride in his car."

Her friend had scowled. "That junk isn't worthy of you."

But Bianca had laughed, bright as sunlight. "That's exactly why I like it."

That smile had outshone the sun itself.

If only he hadn't later discovered Bianca was the sole heiress to the Langley Group. If only his insecurity hadn't driven him to those unforgivable actions... But there were no "if onlys."

Vincent slammed his fist against the steering wheel and dialed a number. "Still haven't found that child? The Hamiltons only have a few elderly at home now—how hard can this be?"

The person on the line stammered excuses. "They never leave the house..."

Vincent smirked coldly. With that bargaining chip, Bianca would have no choice but to return to him.

Women were always weak when it came to their children.

Just then, a bouquet of red roses came flying out of a hospital window, petals scattering like rain.

"Look! Someone threw flowers!"
"A breakup in the hospital?"
"Kinda romantic..."

Whispers rose around him.

A few petals landed on Vincent's hood. He slammed the brakes, gripping the wheel until his knuckles turned white.

Bianca was testing him.

Gritting his teeth, he revved the engine and drove off—refusing to take the bait.

Inside the room, Evelyn watched Bianca standing by the window with concern. "Should I go clean up the flowers? You said Vincent might—"

"No need." Bianca watched the swirling petals, tears finally breaking free. "I used to fear his persistence. Now I understand." She wiped her cheeks. "Since I'll never see his smile again... what's left to fear?"

The petals twirled in the moonlight—a silent farewell.
###Chapter 816: May I Hug You?

Bianca Langley mechanically swallowed the last spoonful of porridge. Her tongue registered no taste. She needed this energy—the energy to seek justice for Adrian Valentine.

Evelyn Carter studied her pallid complexion and exchanged a glance with Alexander Hamilton.

Alexander gave a slight nod. His people had already begun moving.

"Would you like to see the baby?" Evelyn asked gently. "She misses you."

Bianca's fingers suddenly curled into spasming fists. That tiny life which once filled her heart with tenderness now felt like a thorn piercing her soul.

"Is she...here with you?" Her voice fractured.

"We can video call." Evelyn immediately softened her tone, sensing the distress.

Bianca shut her eyes. She couldn't face those eyes—identical to Vincent Croix's.

"I'm sorry." Her voice scraped raw. "I don't...deserve to be her mother now."

Evelyn's chest tightened, swallowing back her questions. The answers were too cruel to voice.

"I broke my promise to him." Bianca suddenly looked up, dark fire in her gaze. "At least...I must see him off properly."

She began a frenzied pilgrimage. For two days, she visited every relative of Adrian's, enduring their accusations and curses.

"It's all your fault!" Adrian's aunt screamed hysterically. "I always said you were wrong for him!"

Evelyn stood silently behind her, an unspoken shield.

Until they met Adrian's great-aunt.

The silver-haired elder poured tea with trembling hands. "He showed me your photo." Tears welled in her clouded eyes. "You should have been so happy."

Bianca bit her lip until blood welled.

"I want to bury him beside his parents." Her voice feathered away. "He promised...to take me to meet them."

Evelyn noticed the darkening sky and suddenly remembered Alexander needed to return to Hudson City.

"You should go," she told him. "The baby needs you."

Alexander frowned. "But you alone—"

"I'm more self-sufficient than an infant." Evelyn forced a smile.

He hesitated, then handed her a business card. "Call immediately if anything happens."

At the doorway, he suddenly opened his arms. "May I hug you?"

Evelyn froze. This once-dominant man now looked as vulnerable as a child.

Thinking of Bianca and Adrian, she gave a slight nod.

Alexander's embrace was light, yet it made her heart skip.

"Come home soon," he whispered.

She watched his car disappear around the corner, fingertips still warm from his touch. Fate was so unpredictable—no one knew what tomorrow might bring.
###Chapter 817: Go Ahead and Call the Police

The elderly woman trembled as she handed over a yellowed note. "That child lost his parents young. I'm not sure if there's still space in the cemetery, but you can go check."

"Thank you." Bianca Langley accepted the paper, her fingers shaking slightly.

Evelyn Carter noticed her distress and waited until they were outside before asking softly, "What's wrong?"

Bianca carefully folded the note, her voice hoarse. "No wonder he insisted on having the wedding here first... I always thought his parents were buried in Seaport..."

Adrian Valentine's parents, it turned out, rested eternally in Hudson City.

Evelyn's chest tightened. "Are you going back?"

They both knew what returning to Hudson City meant now. Adrian's ashes. Vincent Croix's predatory gaze. Bianca's fragile mental state.

Bianca closed her eyes briefly. "I have to."

Seaport was supposed to be home, yet now it felt chillingly unfamiliar. This foreign land where she'd met Adrian held her most vivid memories instead.

"I'm coming with you," Evelyn stated firmly.

On the way back to the hotel, Bianca spoke of Vincent with icy detachment. "He probably sees himself as some tragic romantic hero now, waiting for me to play my part in his melodrama."

Before she could finish, a black sedan screeched to a halt in front of them.

Vincent flung the door open and grabbed Bianca's wrist. "Had enough of this charade?"

Bianca wrenched free. "Get lost."

"I'm taking you home." He reached for her again.

Evelyn stepped between them. "Mr. Croix, her home isn't here." Her finger hovered over her phone's emergency call button.

Vincent's gaze turned venomous. "You think I killed him?" He turned to Bianca. "After all these years, you'd rather believe a dead man than me?"

"He's not dead." Bianca enunciated each word. "He was my fiancé."

Vincent's eyes darkened. "What about our daughter? You want her to grow up without a father?"

"Better than having a murderer for one." Bianca's laugh was bitter.

"You're lying!" Vincent tightened his grip on her wrist.

Evelyn immediately pulled out her phone. "Let her go! Or I'm calling the police!"

"Go ahead!" Vincent sneered. "I just want to talk. Is that illegal?"

Suddenly his tone softened. "Bianca, let's start over. Pretend we just met today—"

Bianca yanked her hand free. "If we'd just met today, I wouldn't even glance your way."

"What did you say?" Vincent's face darkened.

"Exactly what you heard." Bianca rubbed her reddened wrist. "I despise you as a person. Money has nothing to do with it."

As she turned to leave, Vincent suddenly embraced her from behind. "Don't go! I was wrong!"

"Release her!" Evelyn had already connected to emergency services.

Bianca stomped hard on Vincent's foot, breaking free when he yelped in pain. "Vincent, you disgust me."

Sirens wailed in the distance. Vincent finally released her with a sinister smile. "You think this is over?"

A police car pulled up nearby. Bianca walked away without looking back, pulling Evelyn along. Vincent's shout followed them: "You'll regret this!"

Evelyn squeezed her hand. "It's okay now."

Bianca watched the flashing police lights recede into the distance and whispered, "This is only the beginning."

Two people who once loved each other now wielded words like sharpest blades.

Every sentence struck precisely at the other's most vulnerable spot.

"You'd actually say that to me..." Vincent Croix's mask of composure cracked for the first time.

He'd always acted with arrogant confidence. Believed that once obstacles were removed, Bianca Langley would inevitably return. But the finality in her eyes now sent panic coursing through him.

"Why shouldn't I say it?" Bianca's laugh held no warmth. "You get to play the victim while I'm forbidden from exposing your true nature? Loving you was the greatest mistake of my life."

The words plunged into Vincent's heart like a dagger.

His face drained of color. Lips trembled, yet no rebuttal came.

Bianca watched his unraveling with disdain. "Can't keep up the act anymore?"

Evelyn Carter discreetly pressed the emergency call button.

She'd considered contacting Alexander Hamilton, but Bianca's fragile state couldn't withstand more turmoil.

"I'm not acting." Vincent forced the words through clenched teeth.

Despite meticulous preparations, he'd failed to secure any leverage against Bianca. His incompetent subordinates had grown even more hesitant after Alexander's return.

Bianca wrenched her wrist free. "You're hurting me."

Only then did Vincent notice the bruise forming on her pale skin. His hand instinctively reached to soothe it, but she recoiled as if touched by something vile.

"Dr. Carter, let's go." Bianca turned toward the exit.

Just as Evelyn began to relax, Vincent blocked their path. "What must I do to make you believe me?"

He clung to the delusion that repetition could transform lies into truth. Hadn't he, a penniless nobody, once successfully charmed the Langley heiress?

Bianca refused him even a glance.

The dismissal ignited Vincent's fury. His handsome features twisted with barely contained rage. "Without the Langleys, I wouldn't have this life. But don't forget what state your family's company was in! Without me, Langley Enterprises would have collapsed!"

"You never wanted to run the business. Even if not me, your parents would've found someone else. Were they any more sincere than I?"

The absurdity nearly made Bianca laugh.

She closed exhausted eyes. "Finally speaking your truth. To you, our marriage was just a transaction?"

Vincent jolted to awareness. "That's not what I meant—I just—" Frantic explanations tumbled out. "I fell for you long ago. I simply refused to admit it."

The more he struggled to conceal his true thoughts, the more they spilled out during arguments.

But his belated sincerity held no value now.

Bianca tightened her grip on the small porcelain figurine in her pocket, as if drawing strength from Adrian Valentine's memory. "Sincerity that comes too late is cheaper than weeds."

Before Vincent could respond, she delivered the final blow. "Don't disturb me until I've settled my husband's affairs."

"Husband? You never married him!" Vincent's shout bordered on hysterical. In his mind, the title of Bianca's husband belonged solely to him.

Bianca studied her reflection in the phone screen, barely recognizing the woman staring back. "Is this...me?"

Evelyn's heart ached with helpless sympathy. "You'll look better after some rest."

"My face may heal. But what about my heart?" Bianca gave a bitter laugh, tugging at tangled hair strands. The more she pulled, the worse the knots became—until several strands tore free in her frantic grip.

Evelyn rushed to stop her. "Don't do this!"

"I'm fine." Bianca's monotone reply contrasted with the blood now backing up into her IV line.

With practiced motions, Evelyn adjusted the drip rate until crimson retreated into veins.

"Sorry for causing trouble." Bianca's voice emerged raw and unrecognizable.

"Don't say that." Evelyn gently squeezed her hand.

A knock interrupted them.

Assuming Alexander had returned, they were surprised when a deliveryman entered. "Order for Miss Bianca Langley?"

Evelyn eyed the insulated food container with confusion. "Who sent this?"

The deliveryman scratched his head. "The order lists Miss Langley's number."

Evelyn grew more perplexed. If Alexander had sent it, why not use her name? And during Bianca's unconsciousness, he couldn't have known she'd wake.

The deliveryman hurried out of the hospital room before Evelyn could say another word.

She glanced down at the order details, confirming the contact number belonged to Bianca Langley. A name flashed through her mind, but she bit it back, not wanting to upset Bianca further.

The oversized thermal container sat awkwardly by the bed.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn lifted the lid. Inside were neatly arranged boxes of delicate side dishes, a sealed soup tureen, and—most strikingly—a bouquet of deep red roses, their petals still glistening with freshness.

There was no way Alexander had sent this.

Roses were an odd choice for a hospital visit to begin with, let alone nineteen flawless crimson ones.

Evelyn took a deep breath and reached for the container, ready to remove it entirely.

"How many?" Bianca's weak voice cut through the silence.

"Nineteen."

A bitter laugh escaped Bianca's lips, her fingers trembling uncontrollably. "Only Vincent Croix would pull such a ridiculous stunt. Does he really think replaying the past will make me break down like I used to?"

Her eyes burned with icy hatred, flickering with something darker.

Evelyn kept her voice gentle. "I'll get rid of them."

"Don't." Bianca shut her eyes, exhaustion weighing her down. "Knowing him, throwing them out once will just make him send ten more. No point causing a scene for the hospital staff."

Her words faded, whether from the sedatives finally taking effect or sheer emotional exhaustion, Evelyn couldn’t tell.

By the time Alexander returned with dinner and the recovered data from Adrian’s phone, Bianca was already asleep.

Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips in warning.

His gaze landed on the thermal container, and without a word, they stepped into the hallway.

"It’s Vincent," Evelyn murmured. "The food is from a restaurant, and the flowers were probably ordered through the delivery service. I can’t decide if that’s thoughtful or lazy."

Alexander frowned. "How many roses?"

"Nineteen." She tilted her head. "Does that number mean something?"

"Nineteen roses symbolize a marriage proposal." His expression darkened. "But at a time like this..."

Evelyn changed the subject. "Did you recover Adrian’s data?"

"How is she holding up?"

"Not well." Evelyn sighed. "She’s forcing herself to stay strong, but Adrian’s death has shattered her."

After a pause, Alexander said quietly, "Most of the content on his phone relates to Bianca—including wedding plans. I’m worried seeing it will only hurt her more."

As they hesitated, a frail voice spoke behind them.

"Give it to me."

Bianca stood there, her face ghostly pale.

"I have to handle this," she whispered, her voice thin but unshakable. "Adrian told me his parents passed away long ago. His relatives raised him. They deserve to know."

Evelyn understood. The sedatives should have kept her asleep much longer. Waking this soon meant the pain had already burrowed too deep.

Alexander handed her the memory card and the shattered phone. Between the cracks on the screen, faint traces of dried blood were still visible.

Bianca cradled the device as if it were Adrian’s hand. When she removed the phone case, a Polaroid photo fluttered to the ground.

Her fingers trembled as she picked it up.

"This was..." Her breath hitched. "The day he said he wanted to take my picture. The next morning, he bought this instant camera. He said it was simple—no settings to adjust."

The photo showed them beneath the red maple tree where they’d first met. The young photographer was mid-stride, running toward the camera, his smile as bright as the morning sun.
###Chapter 818 I Refuse to Lose

Bianca Langley's fingertips trembled slightly.

She stared at the yellowed photograph, her voice hoarse. "I thought he'd thrown this away long ago."

The edges of the photo were curled, yet someone had preserved it with meticulous care.

"Adrian and I never got a marriage license. Never had a wedding." She lifted her chin, stubborn light flashing in her eyes. "But in our hearts, we were already bound together."

Each word stabbed Vincent Croix like a knife.

The cracks in his carefully constructed facade widened. His voice rose sharply. "It's too soon for this! Take it back, and I'll pretend I never heard it."

Bianca let out a cold laugh.

"Who do you think you are?" Every syllable dripped venom. "I'd rather live with regret than leave things unfinished."

Just mentioning Adrian's name burned her chest like a branding iron. As for the murderer standing before her—she wanted to tear him apart with her bare hands.

Vincent's knuckles turned white.

Regret consumed him. He should have eliminated Adrian sooner. Had he been more ruthless, Bianca would never have had the chance to love another man.

"At least I'm still your ex-husband." Vincent ground the words through clenched teeth.

He knew Bianca responded to gentleness, not force. But maintaining this charade of devotion was exhausting him. "Surely that counts for more than being strangers?"

Evelyn Carter felt nauseated.

Thankfully, police sirens cut through the tension.

"I called them!" Evelyn stepped forward, pointing at Vincent. "He's been stalking and harassing my friend!"

Officers immediately moved to separate Vincent. "You'll need to come with us for questioning."

Vincent shot Evelyn a murderous glare before turning desperate eyes to Bianca. "You'd really go this far?"

Without looking back, Bianca told the police, "We're divorced. He's been harassing me nonstop."

Vincent's face darkened. He hadn't expected such absolute rejection.

An officer gestured toward the patrol car. Causing a scene wasn't an option—not with all these business professionals watching outside the hotel.

Bianca linked arms with Evelyn and walked toward the hotel entrance. She never glanced back.

Evelyn studied her friend's profile discreetly.

Back in their room, Bianca stumbled over the carpet. Evelyn caught her arm just in time.

Her slender heels had left faint swelling around her ankles. But compared to the agony in her heart, this physical discomfort meant nothing.

"Stop punishing yourself." Evelyn sighed. "I know you're struggling."

Bianca finally let her mask slip, revealing raw vulnerability. "I almost pushed him into traffic earlier. I hate that I could still speak to him calmly."

She should have remained her parents' treasured jewel. Without Vincent, she might have met Adrian on some sunlit afternoon at their alma mater.

What a beautiful life that could have been.

Uncharacteristically, Evelyn sat cross-legged on the carpet, silently keeping her company.

"Remember our first meeting?" Bianca asked abruptly.

Evelyn nodded. That radiant, sunshine-bright woman had left an indelible impression.

"Mind if I smoke?" Bianca's voice was barely audible.

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded again.

Bianca retrieved a slim case of women's cigarettes from her purse. A silver lighter clicked, flame dancing at her fingertips.

"I loved Vincent once." She exhaled a slow smoke ring. "That mountain trip...I was actually running from him."

Her voice drifted through the haze. "I refuse to lose. When I saw him at the hotel, part of me still fantasized he came to reconcile."

Evelyn gently squeezed her hand. "We've all worn masks. I've swallowed my pride more times than I can count."

Ash fluttered from Bianca's cigarette.

"It's over now." Evelyn said softly. "Cry if you need to. Scream if you want. This life is yours—don't let the past keep torturing you."

Bianca watched dusk settle beyond the window. With sudden force, she crushed the cigarette butt into the ashtray.
###Chapter 819: Truth in Dying Words

Evelyn's gaze remained fixed on Bianca.

Bianca was uncharacteristically baring her soul, every word sounding like a final confession. It reminded Evelyn of that ominous saying.

Truth in dying words.

Her fingers turned cold, fearing Bianca might do something reckless. Just as she was about to speak, Bianca abruptly changed the subject.

"Vincent kept staring at me when they took him away." Bianca flicked her cigarette ash. "I didn't look back, but I could feel his gaze. With his current influence, this level of harassment isn't enough for a restraining order. At most, it'll delay him a few hours."

She exhaled a smoke ring, the haze obscuring her face.

"Maybe he's forgotten how he stood outside my hospital room the day I gave birth." Her voice was barely audible. "He was in such a hurry for his 'business trip' that he didn't even hold our baby. And there I was, lying in bed, still hoping he'd turn back."

That memory cut like a knife, nearly shattering her. If not for her parents' constant vigilance, she might have succumbed to postpartum depression.

Evelyn's throat tightened. As an OB-GYN, she'd witnessed too many broken mothers. Hearing Bianca's calm narration now felt like a boulder pressing on her chest.

"His suffering isn't a fraction of yours." Evelyn grasped Bianca's icy hand. "For men, childbirth is just a fling. But for women—"

"Dr. Carter." Bianca interrupted suddenly. "I never thought you'd be the one saying this to me in the end."

The ashtray was filled with gray residue.

"I'm an obstetrician. It's my duty."

"Nothing in this world is obligatory." Bianca stubbed out her cigarette, as if reaching a decision. "If one day I can no longer care for my baby..."

Evelyn's heart lurched.

"Would you and Alexander be willing to adopt her?" Bianca met her eyes directly. "I know it's presumptuous. The Liang shares aren't much, but—"

"Stop!" Evelyn's voice trembled. "Nothing will happen to you. Alexander is already investigating Vincent. He'll pay!"

She didn't dare mention Alexander's suspicion—that Vincent had already prepared a scapegoat, facing at most a few years in prison. That truth would destroy Bianca completely.

"A love suicide?" Bianca suddenly laughed. "You overestimate me, Doctor."

She traced the cigarette box, her voice feather-light.

"I just... doubt I can love her the way I used to. While I'm still lucid, I want to find her a good home." A pause. "Consider it fate being unkind to us."

Evelyn's eyes burned. How she wished the baby were her daughter—but never like this.

"It's too early for this." She forced a joke. "When you regret it, don't expect me to return her."

Bianca didn't respond. The cigarette burned to her fingers, leaving a red mark.

They changed hotels before Vincent could intervene. En route, Bianca insisted on stopping by the hospital.

The morgue's fluorescent lights were piercingly cold.

"I shouldn't have come." Bianca stared at her reflection. "Now every time I close my eyes, I see him in that drawer."

As the attendant moved to open the compartment, Bianca said abruptly, "I'll take him home."

The hearse arrived swiftly. Evelyn watched Bianca's shaking hands sign the paperwork, insisting on handling everything personally.

When the crematorium roared to life, Bianca's nails dug into her palms. Evelyn turned away, unable to face her shattered expression.

The attendant presented the urn. Bianca chose the brightest one. Donning gloves, she gathered her lover's remains piece by piece.

Evelyn stood behind her, watching Bianca's silhouette tremble in the furnace glow.
###Chapter 820: Just End My Misery

The moment the crematorium door slowly closed, Evelyn Carter felt an invisible hand clenching her heart. She finally understood why people faint from extreme pain—it's the brain's final act of mercy.

But Bianca Langley wasn't granted even that small kindness.

"I used to watch crime dramas and think cremation turned everything to ashes," Bianca's voice was feather-light. "Turns out even bones don't burn completely."

The remaining fragments still bore the cracks from the car crash. Adrian Valentine hadn't died instantly at the scene—internal bleeding had claimed him. Those untreated wounds were now permanently etched into his bones.

Only when the urn was about to be sealed did Bianca finally let her tears fall. Her lower lip was already bitten raw, the metallic taste of blood filling her mouth. Evelyn silently handed her a tissue, pretending not to notice the crescent-shaped wounds Bianca's nails had carved into her own palms.

To shake off Vincent Croix, they'd booked the earliest flight to Hudson City. With a 6 AM departure, they were stuck in this budget hotel overnight. Bianca, raised in luxury, didn't complain about the shabby accommodations.

"Vincent would never think to look for us here," she even managed a faint smile, fingertips brushing the urn's smooth surface.

At 4 AM, the hotel shuttle arrived right on schedule. Just as Evelyn reached for the door handle, a shadow emerged from the darkness. Vincent's suit was damp with dew—he'd clearly been waiting for hours.

Bianca clutched the urn wrapped in her coat, walking straight past him toward the vehicle.

"Nothing to say to me?" Vincent blocked the car door.

"Move." Her voice was colder than the night wind.

Evelyn raised her phone. "Should I call the police again?"

Vincent smirked. "Go ahead. I've got all the time in the world." He turned to Bianca. "I waited here all night. This is how you treat me?"

Bianca snapped. "Get lost! Never let me see your face again!"

Vincent's expression darkened. His gaze dropped to the bundle in her arms, a twisted satisfaction flashing in his eyes.

"You think this is about revenge?" He took a threatening step closer. "I just wanted to say I regret it."

Bianca's nails dug deeper into her palms. She suddenly wished she'd died with Adrian in that rain-soaked wreck. Now, the weight in her arms was the only reason she kept breathing.

The shuttle's engine growled impatiently. Evelyn grasped Bianca's ice-cold hand. "We need to go."

Vincent remained planted before the car like an immovable wall. Bianca lifted her face, a ghastly smile stretching across her pale features.

"Vincent," she whispered, "just end my misery. Look what you've reduced me to—not quite human, not quite ghost. Are you satisfied now?"
###Chapter 821: His Trophy

Evelyn Carter took a deep breath and stepped between Bianca Langley and Vincent Croix.

She moved half a step closer to Vincent, lowering her voice. "If this continues, she might actually die."

Vincent's pupils constricted sharply. "What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said." Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "I've seen countless irresponsible husbands in the OB-GYN department, but you... you're a first."

Her tone was eerily calm, as if discussing the weather. "Need I remind you what a desperate woman is capable of?"

Vincent's face drained of color.

Memories of that day at the cemetery flooded back. His first love was already gone—Bianca was the only obsession he had left.

He couldn't risk it.

When Bianca knocked his coat to the ground for the third time, Vincent bent to pick it up. "Put this on. I'll leave immediately."

Bianca finally took it but refused to wear it.

Dark fury churned in Vincent's eyes, yet he forced it down. The clock struck 3:59 AM.

Evelyn helped Bianca into the car. Through the rear window, she watched Vincent's figure grow smaller until it vanished into the pre-dawn darkness.

The driver's hands trembled on the wheel. "Miss, should we call the police? That man's stare was terrifying..."

"No need." Bianca clutched the porcelain urn to her chest, her voice feather-light.

At Hudson City Airport, Alexander Hamilton had been waiting for hours.

Bianca's face was deathly pale, yet she insisted on going straight to the cemetery. The moment they stepped out of the terminal, she collapsed—but never loosened her grip on the urn.

When she woke again, sunlight filled the room.

Evelyn sat by the bed peeling an apple. The knife stilled as Bianca opened her eyes. "Your fever's gone down."

Bianca stared at the ceiling's intricate patterns, her throat burning. "Is this... the Hamilton residence?"

"Yes." Evelyn handed her a glass of water. "Aunt Margaret prepared this guest room herself. It overlooks the garden."

On the nightstand, the celadon urn gleamed in the morning light.

Bianca's fingers trembled. "I shouldn't have brought this here..."

"Aunt Margaret said it's fine." Evelyn placed a pill in her palm. "Alexander has already gone to the cemetery. Your parents have been notified too."

Suddenly, Bianca asked, "Where's Vincent?"

The room plunged into silence.

Evelyn explained how she'd used psychological tactics to escape. When she finished, Bianca let out a hollow laugh, her eyes glacial.

"He wasn't afraid I'd die." She traced the urn's smooth surface. "He was afraid his collection would lose another piece."

"Ever heard of gaslighting?" Bianca lifted her chin, her smile razor-sharp. "Too bad this time, the one going mad won't be me."
###Chapter 822: The Embodiment of Security

In psychology, there's a term called gaslighting—a manipulative tactic often used by those with ill intentions. Having worked in the hospital for years, Evelyn Carter understood its dangers all too well.

"Don't overthink it." She spoke softly, offering comfort. "As long as you don’t see him, he can’t do anything. He wouldn’t dare barge into the Hamilton estate. Alexander Hamilton isn’t someone to be trifled with."

Somewhere along the way, Alexander Hamilton’s name had become synonymous with safety. Evelyn had never been one to rely on borrowed authority, but if it helped her friend, she had no qualms about invoking his name.

Bianca Langley nodded quietly. In the days that followed, she spent her time recuperating, often lost in thought as she stared at Adrian Valentine’s urn and the little porcelain figurine.

Alexander was careful to avoid any impropriety, always ensuring important matters were discussed among the three of them. Whether it was Vincent Croix’s movements or the upheaval at the Langley Group, none of the news was good.

"Does he really need such a spectacle just to return to Hudson City?" Evelyn frowned. "He’s clearly doing this on purpose."

Vincent had turned the typically low-profile Langley Group into a glaringly public affair. The scene at the airport looked more like a press conference than a private trip.

"Exactly." Alexander’s lips curled into a cold smile. "He doesn’t want anyone to know his real reason for going to Seaview City."

"Is the information reliable?" Evelyn was skeptical.

"Absolutely." Alexander’s eyes darkened. "The only reason he dares to cause trouble for you in Seaview City is because he’s left trusted allies here."

When he said "trouble," his jaw tightened imperceptibly. Even setting aside Bianca’s situation, he would make Vincent pay.

A spark of life finally returned to Bianca’s eyes. "His allies are betraying him? But those were his childhood friends and classmates."

She let out a bitter laugh. "My parents initially looked down on him, but they changed their minds when they saw his capabilities. He exploited that trust..."

Like a venomous snake, Vincent had slowly devoured the Langley Group. His patience was chilling.

Evelyn suddenly realized something. "Just like those people we encountered in the village. The board couldn’t have been completely united. He bought them off too easily."

Alexander turned to Bianca. She gave a weak nod. "The irony is, when he brought his hometown connections into the company, I actually thought he’d finally found a home here."

"Those who can be bought once will betray again." Bianca’s voice was hoarse. "He’ll reap what he sows..."

She listed the few within the Langley Group who could still be trusted. Alexander acted immediately, catching Vincent off guard.

Vincent had intended to use the airport spectacle to send Bianca a message, only to be betrayed by those he trusted most.

While he was scrambling to contain the fallout, Bianca—accompanied by Alexander and Evelyn—dragged her weakened body to the cemetery.

Alexander had orchestrated everything meticulously, ensuring she could say her farewells in peace. The two of them stopped a hundred meters away, giving her space.

The tombstone bore words Bianca had inscribed as Adrian’s widow. With her own hands, she placed his urn into the grave, along with the little porcelain girl.

What she buried wasn’t just love—it was the person she used to be.
###Chapter 823: You'll Regret This

The wind rustled through the cemetery leaves.

Alexander Hamilton and Evelyn Carter stood at a distance, watching Bianca Langley's solitary figure. She bent down to place the urn with such care, as if afraid to disturb the sleeping.

Evelyn noticed Bianca's trembling fingertips as she withdrew her hand. Instinctively, she stepped forward—only for Alexander to gently grasp her wrist.

"Let her have this moment," he murmured.

The century-old cemetery sprawled across the mountainside, white tombstones peeking through pines and cypresses. Mist curled around distant peaks like a painted dreamscape.

Alexander gazed at the view. "This wouldn't be a bad resting place."

Evelyn whirled on him, eyes flashing. "Don't say such things."

Her voice shook. Those days watching him in the ICU were memories she never wanted to relive.

"Forgive me." His lips quirked upward. Her concern warmed him more than any sunlight.

The sky darkened abruptly.

Alexander frowned at the gathering clouds. "I'll fetch an umbrella." He turned—then froze.

Vincent Croix approached through the cemetery gates, white chrysanthemums in hand. Their eyes met. Vincent's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Alexander. What a coincidence."

Alexander didn't move.

When Vincent tried to pass, an immovable arm blocked his path. "How's business, Vincent?" Alexander's voice could have frosted glass.

"Thanks to you." Vincent's jaw clenched. Those sudden financial blows could only have come from the Hamiltons or the Langleys.

Alexander chuckled. "Good. You looked so pale, I thought you might be in trouble."

Vincent lowered his voice. "Must you be so relentless? I survived your attacks." His gaze turned venomous. "Though I hear Dr. Carter still refuses to reconcile?"

Alexander's eyes turned glacial.

In the distance, Bianca rose from the grave. "You'll regret this," Alexander spat before striding away.

Vincent watched him go, fingers crushing the flowers.

Bianca stared at the fresh headstone, her chest too tight to breathe. She clung to composure—until Vincent's figure entered her vision.

"How dare he come..." Her voice fractured.

Evelyn followed her gaze to Vincent's approaching form. Alexander swiftly positioned himself between them, his aura radiating danger.

Vincent ignored the barrier. "Alexander. Dr. Carter." His eyes locked onto Bianca. "You hate me because you think I killed Adrian?"

Bianca's nails bit into her palms. "Not think. Know."

Vincent smiled then—a cruel, knowing twist of lips. "Then tell me, who did he call last before he died?"

The words struck like a dagger through Bianca's heart.
###Chapter 824: Shattered Mirror

Vincent's knuckles turned white.

He stared into Bianca's eyes—once bright with starlight, now dull as stagnant water.

"The company's having issues again." His voice was hoarse. "You know why."

This wasn't a question.

Bianca's lips curled into a mocking smile. She looked at the man she once loved as if he were a joke.

Evelyn's words echoed in Vincent's mind. He forced a pained expression, even modulating his breath.

"If you're convinced I killed Adrian, then I have nothing to say." He lifted the white chrysanthemums. "At least let me leave these."

He had to restrain himself.

Restrain his contempt for that pathetic loser. Restrain his desire for Bianca. Restrain the urge to destroy everything.

Both orphans—why did Adrian get everything? Inheritance. Family. And finally, Bianca's heart.

A shadow flickered in Vincent's eyes.

"Give them to me." Bianca extended her hand, deliberately avoiding his fingers.

How she wanted to smash those flowers against his hypocritical face. But Adrian's grave needed them—even tainted by Vincent's touch.

She took the bouquet by its wrapping paper, as if handling something contaminated.

Vincent's fingertips brushed her sleeve, leaving an invisible mark.

Alexander and Evelyn stood at a distance, watchful.

——

Rain began falling as Bianca gazed at the blurred scenery through the car window.

"I can't find another place," she murmured.

That nightmare-filled marital home still bore her name. Vincent had discarded it like worn-out clothing.

Evelyn watched the windshield wipers sway. "My mother's new place has space."

She was offering an escape route.

Bianca shook her head. Her long hair fell, veiling half her pale face.

"I can't keep running forever."

Traffic crawled. Alexander tapped the steering wheel absently.

"Remember the Dempsey Group incident?" He spoke suddenly. "Time to return the favor."

Bianca's lashes fluttered.

"Anything?"

"Including reclaiming everything you've lost." His voice was steady.

Bianca smiled—her first genuine one in days, yet chilling.

"Make him lose what matters most..." she whispered. "But not yet."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

——

Back at the Hamilton residence, she caught Alexander's sleeve.

"I'm worried..." Her voice dropped. "Will she ask you to care for the baby?"

These days, Bianca barely held little Chloe. Even when the infant reached out, she remained frozen—an outsider.

Returning from night shifts, Evelyn often found Bianca standing outside the nursery door. Never entering.

A shattered mirror can never be pieced back together.

Adrian hadn't just taken his own life—he'd stolen Bianca's capacity to love.
###Chapter 825: Just Like Her

Alexander Hamilton sighed softly after hearing Evelyn Carter's words. "You noticed it too."

He had spent more time caring for Baby Chloe but hadn't mentioned the issue, unsure how to address it.

"Though she won't remember this age, she's already taking her first steps and crawling fast. Sooner or later, she'll sense her mother's distance. It breaks my heart that she has to go through this so young, yet I don't know who to blame."

"Before becoming a mother, Miss Langley was her own person first. Mr. Valentine's sudden passing—without justice—left her with deep hatred for Vincent Croix. As for the baby..." Evelyn trailed off.

Alexander seamlessly continued, "Do you also think she's starting to resemble her parents more? Both Bianca and Vincent are attractive, and Chloe inherited their best features. She'll undoubtedly grow into a beauty. But her timing couldn't be worse."

At just over a year old, Baby Chloe already had delicate features—her eyes and mouth mirroring Bianca's, while her nose and brows were unmistakably Vincent's.

What should have been a blessing now weighed heavily on Bianca, each glance at her daughter reviving painful memories.

Evelyn knew avoidance wasn't a solution, but alternatives were scarce. "Vincent won't give up easily. The more he appears, the harder it'll be for Bianca to move on. She once joked about us raising Chloe. If that day comes... what do you think?"

As godparents, they were the natural choice if Bianca couldn't continue parenting—not just from months of bonding, but because they genuinely connected with the child.

Alexander nervously rubbed his pant seam, uncharacteristically tense. "We could raise her together. Like... how things are now."

Evelyn met his gaze. "You once said you wanted to maintain the status quo."

That was months ago.

Panicked she might recall his past mistakes, he clarified, "I meant our current dynamic, not before."

Back then, they hadn't faced life-and-death trials, and her attitude toward him had been entirely different.

Seeing his fluster, Evelyn chuckled. "I hadn't even finished speaking. If Emily saw you like this, she'd think the company was in crisis."

Her teasing signaled a lighter mood.

Alexander exhaled inwardly. "The company's fine. Vincent's tactics might work on others, but he's met his match with me."

He dismissed Vincent entirely—his real concern was Evelyn's reaction. "I know I'm being greedy, but there's no alternative. If you think I'm going back on my word, I'll accept that."

Recognizing his sincerity, Evelyn smiled without pressing further.

That afternoon, Vivian Dempsey arrived in the rain, visiting Bianca first. Her somber attire showed she knew what had happened.

Bianca seemed unsurprised—or perhaps nothing could surprise her now.

Vivian, however, was shocked by the once-vibrant beauty's haggard appearance. Only Evelyn's prior warning stopped her from cursing Vincent outright.

"Miss Langley... how are you holding up?" Vivian barely caught herself from asking "Are you okay?"

Evelyn retracted the elbow she'd prepared to nudge Vivian with.

"Quite idle," Bianca replied with a hollow smile. Not that she didn't want to smile—she'd simply forgotten how to feel joy.

Vivian's heart ached. "Miss Langley, I heard you're moving? My place is empty—you could stay there!"

Eager to repay Bianca's past kindness (though hiring thugs to beat Vincent was her preferred method), this was her only current option.

Evelyn agreed. "You could keep each other company."

"No need. I'll find a place after the rain stops." Bianca deflected. "Vivian, congratulations on your business success—I hear you're being called 'CEO' now."

Evelyn stiffened at Bianca's casual mention of Vincent, but her calmness matched her demeanor since returning from the cemetery.

When Evelyn had expressed concern earlier, Bianca had shrugged: "I'm not calm—just exhausted. After years without illness, this cold hit hard. Otherwise, do you think I wouldn't have thrown those flowers in his face?"

That reaction would've been more typical of Bianca.

Seeing her discuss Vincent so impassively, Evelyn could only console herself that Bianca wasn't fully recovered.

Yet Bianca successfully redirected Vivian's attention to her loan endeavors.

"Don't flatter me—I know my limits. Without your help, keeping the company afloat would've been an achievement, let alone launching new production lines. So Miss Langley, please don't hesitate to ask for anything."
###Chapter 826 The Custody Battle

Vivian Dempsey had always been straightforward, unable to keep her thoughts bottled up. She slammed the table and stood up, looking ready to pick a fight.

Bianca Langley cradled the steaming tea Evelyn Carter handed her, her face blurred by the rising vapor. She used to love iced Americanos, even in the dead of winter, but now she found comfort in the warmth of this cup.

"Miss Dempsey, I know all about that loan," Bianca's voice was feather-light. "Vincent Croix interfered and prevented you from getting the final payment. I was in no position to help at the time."

"Oh, forget it!" Vivian waved her hands dismissively. "Back then, you were the only one willing to lend me money. It's fine—I've already paid it all back!"

Evelyn watched her best friend, knowing there was no stopping her. She sipped her tea quietly. This weekend had been far too eventful.

Bianca wasn’t ignorant about finance—she just didn’t care for it. As Vivian recounted how Vincent had systematically crushed others to dig up information about her, everything Alexander Hamilton had hinted at finally clicked.

"He must be feeling quite pleased with himself now," Bianca said, her tone eerily calm.

Even the usually oblivious Vivian sensed something was off. "Miss Langley, if you want to vent, I know some people. We could ambush him after dark, rough him up, and force a confession!"

Though Alexander had never spelled it out, Bianca knew the investigation into Adrian Valentine’s car accident had ended with his burial. Vincent had orchestrated it flawlessly—the hit-and-run driver was gravely ill and out on bail, while the friend who’d lent the car was completely innocent. Adrian had died for nothing.

Evelyn and Alexander thought she was in the dark, but she’d already uncovered the truth.

"That’s not a bad idea," Bianca mused seriously. "Too bad coerced confessions aren’t admissible in court."

Vivian shot Evelyn a pleading look.

"It really wouldn’t work," Evelyn agreed. "And it’s too dangerous. If he turns the tables..."

She swiftly shut down Vivian’s reckless suggestion, then turned to Bianca. On the surface, Bianca seemed perfectly normal—but that very normalcy unsettled her.

Though impulsive, Vivian always listened to Evelyn. Before leaving, she refrained from offering any more ill-advised schemes, instead promising to help Bianca find a quiet house close to nature.

It was the first time Bianca had ever wanted to escape the noise.

After seeing Vivian off, Evelyn was about to have a serious talk with Bianca when Aunt Margaret knocked on the door, holding a document. "Someone just delivered this..."

It was a court summons.

Evelyn’s heart clenched. She and Aunt Margaret immediately watched for Bianca’s reaction, but the woman remained unnervingly composed.

"Don’t worry," Bianca didn’t even glance at the summons. "I knew he’d pull this. He’s never accepted the divorce ruling. This is probably about custody."

She was absolutely right.

Even the usually gentle Aunt Margaret couldn’t contain her anger. "He’s never raised that child for a single day, and now he dares to fight for custody? Bianca, don’t worry—we’ll all testify for you!"

"Thank you," Bianca said softly, looking at Aunt Margaret as if seeing her own mother.

Aside from her parents, no one else in this world would stand by her unconditionally. The thought of causing them more pain twisted her heart.

Aunt Margaret gently smoothed Bianca’s stray bangs. "Silly girl, I’ve watched you grow up. I know what matters most to you."

Evelyn understood she meant Baby Chloe and sighed inwardly. Vincent had no idea how to care for a child. If he won custody, the baby would only become leverage against Bianca.

But this wouldn’t be an easy legal battle.

As an OB-GYN, Evelyn knew nothing about the law. She could only contact Attorney Han, whom she’d worked with before.

A top lawyer in Hamilton Group’s legal department, Attorney Han quickly provided professional advice: "Given the other party’s lack of parental involvement, the odds of winning are high, but the process will be tedious."

Evelyn wasn’t afraid of the hassle—she only feared for the baby’s well-being.

That night, Alexander wasn’t just handling corporate affairs in his study. He personally reached out to a lawyer specializing in custody cases.

Evelyn was surprised, then realized Attorney Han, as Alexander’s trusted subordinate, must have reported her inquiry.

"Any solutions?" she asked as he hung up. "Attorney Han didn’t charge a consultation fee, but he didn’t have any brilliant ideas either."

"There’s a way," Alexander reassured her. "Attorney Han’s classmate specializes in these cases. She’s helped many 'Purple Ribbon Mothers' regain custody."

Evelyn relaxed slightly. "That’s good. But I’m worried Vincent might resort to desperate measures—like snatching the baby. Even if we win the case..."

Her concern was valid. With Vincent’s character, nothing was beneath him.
###Chapter 827: People Change

Alexander Hamilton immediately dialed Emily Zade.

"Deploy all available security personnel near the estate," his voice was low. "Focus on protecting Baby Chloe during outings."

Bianca Langley stood nearby, her fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of her teacup.

She remained silent.

When the lawyer asked for her signature, she mechanically completed the paperwork.

Vivian Dempsey had found her several nice properties.

Their scheduled viewings kept getting postponed by the relentless rainy season.

The old Bianca would never have cared about the rain.

She used to be a wild rose in full bloom—storms only made her more radiant.

But not anymore.

Her battered heart couldn't withstand even the slightest turbulence now.

She needed to stay clear-headed until her final mission was complete.

Vincent Croix struck back swiftly.

He submitted a visitation petition to the court with a paternity test report.

The report's origins were suspicious.

He'd never once held the baby since her birth.

Investigations revealed he'd sent someone to infiltrate their former marital home.

A few strands of soft baby hair were found tucked in the crib's seams.

"This case is difficult to fight," the lawyer wiped his sweat as he reported to Alexander. "Unless we prove major misconduct, the visitation rights can't be denied."

Alexander massaged his temples. "Buy us as much time as possible."

When Evelyn Carter heard the news, her fingers twisted together unconsciously.

"I'd love to have someone beat him up right now," she said bitterly.

Alexander scoffed. "Once isn't enough. Best make sure he forgets he ever had a child."

They exchanged a glance, reaching a silent understanding.

Bianca suddenly spoke. "I want to see Vincent."

Her voice was soft but resolute.

"Will you both come with me?"

This was the first time she'd mentioned the baby since returning.

In the teahouse across from the hospital, the four of them sat facing each other.

Vincent's expression darkened upon seeing Alexander and Evelyn.

"Mr. Hamilton," he said with a forced smile, "meeting privately during litigation seems inappropriate."

Alexander leisurely poured a cup of jujube tea.

"We're just here for tea," he said meaningfully, glancing at Evelyn. "We won't say a word."

Evelyn picked up the thread. "If anyone should worry about confidentiality, it's you, Mr. Croix."

Vincent was rendered speechless.

Bianca kept her head down, her fingertip circling the cup's edge.

"I remember you hated tea," Vincent said suddenly.

"People change," she replied flatly, as if discussing the weather.

A calculating glint flashed in Vincent's eyes. "How's the baby? She must be saying 'Dada' by now?"

"I wouldn't know," Bianca looked up. "You want custody? Take it."

Evelyn nearly knocked over her cup.

Alexander squeezed her hand under the table.

"You don't know?" Vincent shot to his feet. "How could you treat your own child like this!"

Bianca smirked. "Compared to you wanting her gone, what's this?"

Vincent's expression shifted abruptly.

He softened his tone. "I was wrong before. The child's innocent—I just wanted to see you—"

"You've seen me now," Bianca cut him off. "Say what you need to say."

The aroma of tea slowly unfurled in the air.

Vincent's performance had only just begun.
###Chapter 828: Obsession

The aroma of tea lingered in the air.

Bianca Langley took a sip from her cup, her brows furrowing slightly. The same tea leaves that had tasted rich and sweet at the Hamiltons' now left nothing but bitterness on her tongue.

"Just water, please," she signaled to the waiter.

Vincent Croix's gaze never left her. Three years had changed her—the sharpness in her eyes had intensified, yet her movements carried a new ease.

A pang of regret twisted inside him.

If only she'd obeyed him back then, she wouldn't have become this version of herself.

"Can we talk alone?" Vincent lowered his voice. "Some things shouldn't be said in front of others."

Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton exchanged a glance. Only after Bianca gave a slight nod did they rise and move toward the lounge area outside the side door.

Alexander pulled out a sanitizing wipe, meticulously cleaning the wooden chair.

"Since when did you develop germaphobia?" Evelyn chuckled.

"Proximity breeds similarity." Alexander helped her sit before settling beside her. "I never noticed how offensive dust was before."

Evelyn blinked. "Or maybe someone always cleaned it for you?"

Alexander paused, then laughed. "Then I'll be the one wiping it down from now on."

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across them. Were it not for needing to keep watch over Vincent, this would've made for a perfect date.

Back at the tea table, the air was so still the ripple of water could be heard.

Bianca drank her water leisurely until Vincent placed his hand on the table—a wedding band glaringly visible on his ring finger.

"I thought you threw it away," she sneered.

During their divorce, both rings had been flung out the window. That hers had been recovered was miracle enough—where had his come from?

"Custom-made." Vincent rubbed the band. "An exact replica."

Bianca set down her glass with a sharp clink.

"Counterfeits will always be counterfeits." She locked eyes with him. "Just like how killing Adrian changed nothing."

Even now, saying Adrian's name sent a stab through her heart. But time was the best healer, and hatred the strongest painkiller.

Vincent's gaze darted around, checking for recording devices before scowling. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Relax, I'm not that petty." Bianca's lips curled mockingly. "There are countless ways to ruin you. How many enemies have you made climbing to your current position?"

Vincent paled but held his ground. "What will it take for you to forgive me?"

"Simple." Bianca stood. "When you're dead, I'll personally place flowers on your grave."

Vincent grabbed her wrist. "Baby Chloe is our daughter—you can't possibly—"

Before he could finish, a glass of ice water hit him square in the face.

Vincent gasped as his expensive suit soaked through. Water dripped from his hair as he gritted his teeth. "Feel better now?"

Bianca snatched the teapot, pouring scalding liquid over his head.

"How about now?" she demanded.

Vincent hissed from the burn but refused to release her. "Pour all you want—if it makes you happy."

His performative devotion turned her stomach. She yanked free, only for his grip to tighten.

Outside the side door, Evelyn and Alexander immediately rushed toward them.
###Chapter 829: The Depths of Insecurity

The teahouse buzzed with hushed whispers like swarming mosquitoes.

"That man still won't let go?"

"Look at that poor girl's face—she's clearly devastated."

"Tsk. Dressed like a gentleman but rotten to the core..."

Bianca Langley's fingers tapped lightly against her teacup. She'd never cared for gossip, but being associated with Vincent Croix again was intolerable.

"Did you receive the court ruling?" She stood abruptly, her voice ringing clear for every onlooker. "Adultery. Hidden assets. How dare you show your face?"

The room erupted in murmurs. Several patrons discreetly raised their phones, cameras trained on the spectacle.

Vincent's face drained of color. He reached for Bianca's wrist, but she wrenched free with a sharp jerk.

"You'll regret this." His words slithered through clenched teeth.

Bianca strode toward the exit without a backward glance. As she passed Evelyn Carter, her step faltered almost imperceptibly.

Evelyn immediately steadied her with a firm grip.

Alexander Hamilton had already settled the bill. He turned, his glacial gaze sweeping over Vincent like a blade—silent but lethal.

Vincent stood rooted, watching Bianca disappear through the doorway. She hadn't even granted him a final look. His fists clenched until his knuckles whitened.

Crash!

The ceramic teapot shattered against the floor.

A trembling server approached. "Sir—"

Vincent flung a wad of cash onto the table. With a sharp gesture, black-suited bodyguards materialized from the shadows, methodically checking every phone in the vicinity.

"Delete it. Or face litigation."

Ordinary people weren't equipped for such intimidation. The recordings vanished instantly. Spectating was one thing; inviting trouble another.

Outside, Bianca's pace quickened.

"I need to move out," she announced abruptly.

Evelyn tensed. "Did Vincent threaten you?"

"No." Bianca shook her head, sunlight etching her gaunt features. "He's been using Baby Chloe against me. But I realized..."

Alexander halted, glancing back at the teahouse. Vincent was gone, replaced by unfamiliar black sedans gliding away.

"He brought backup." Evelyn noted the anomaly. "Was he always this cautious?"

Bianca's dress fluttered in the spring breeze, accentuating her fragility.

"He had enemies, but never cared before." Her voice was featherlight. "Now... perhaps guilt makes him paranoid."

Vincent had changed. During their last encounter, madness had brimmed in his eyes. Insecurity often masqueraded as arrogance, and Bianca's repeated rejections had flayed his pride raw.

Evelyn's unease grew. "Leaving the Hamiltons is too risky. At least there's security—"

"I'm not taking Chloe." The words froze the air.

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged glances. The unspoken truth hung between them—the custody battle was unwinnable. Vincent now controlled the Langley empire. He could prolong litigation indefinitely.

"My parents..." Bianca's voice trembled. "They'll find out soon."

Alexander sighed. "The truth always surfaces."

The spring wind remained tender, powerless against the weight pressing down on the trio.
###Chapter 830: The Silent Farewell

Mr. and Mrs. Langley, frail with age, had spent years praying for their daughter to find happiness. The news of Bianca's return to prepare for her wedding had filled them with joy, but as days passed without any updates, their hearts grew heavy with worry.

"How will you explain it to them?" Evelyn asked softly.

It was better for Bianca to break the news herself than let Vincent, that madman, do it first. That man was capable of anything.

Bianca pressed her lips together.

"I'll say Adrian and I had a fight and broke up. If I act devastated enough, they won’t press for details. Once some time passes, I’ll tell them I’m going to Europe to clear my head."

"I’ll ask Aunt Margaret to cover for you," Evelyn said, recalling the overseas call from Mrs. Langley. If she hadn’t been holding the baby to distract them, the truth would have slipped out already.

Bianca nodded gratefully. "I’ll owe you all for this. I’ll make sure Vincent can’t reach my parents."

"My parents are key witnesses to prove he never fulfilled his responsibilities as a father. If they can’t testify, he might still get visitation rights." A steely resolve flashed in Bianca’s eyes. "So I’ve decided to do what men like him do—just take my child and disappear."

It wasn’t honorable, but against someone like Vincent, who had no boundaries, it might be the only way. Evelyn thought of the "Purple Ribbon Mothers" cases and had to admit this might be the only solution.

Alexander frowned. "There are safer options."

"Safe forever?" Bianca smiled bitterly. She couldn’t rely on others forever—some paths she had to walk alone.

The day she left was bathed in sunlight, just like the day she and Evelyn had first met. Baby Chloe slept soundly in her cradle, her cheeks rosy, blissfully unaware her mother was about to leave.

Evelyn stood nearby, her fingers lightly brushing the baby’s cheek. Should she wake her? The choice twisted her heart.

"Don’t," Bianca whispered. "She’s been sleeping lightly lately. If she wakes up cranky, I don’t want to leave Alexander with that trouble."

She leaned down and pressed a kiss to the baby’s forehead, silently saying her goodbye. When she turned away, her back was resolute and unshaken.

To avoid Vincent’s spies, Bianca pretended she was just going for a walk. Vivian’s car was already waiting in the park. The three chatted under the trees like ordinary friends. When it was time, Bianca got into Vivian’s car—and never returned.

Vincent’s men lost track of her. It wasn’t until dawn the next day that they realized something was wrong.

On Saturday morning, Evelyn and Alexander took the baby to the sunroom. Grace had moved back to her own home, and Aunt Margaret visited often. The Hamilton estate was so quiet you could hear the sunlight touch the ground.

The baby chased after Peanut on the rug while Evelyn paged through a medical journal and Alexander reviewed documents, exchanging the occasional remark.

"Bianca reads people well," Alexander finally said what had been weighing on him. "If she didn’t leave now, Vincent would haunt her like a shadow."

He set down the file, his brow furrowed. "Lately, I’ve noticed cars following me—different models, different colors. To confirm it wasn’t coincidence, I took detours through the business district, but they’re sharp. They always shake off my driver."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "Why didn’t you tell me sooner?"

She’d thought Vincent was just persistent, not bold enough to stalk them openly.

"I didn’t want to worry you or pressure Bianca." Alexander’s gaze was steady and warm. Time had taught him restraint—and how to protect those he loved.

Outside, spring light spilled generously, but the sunroom held a quiet sorrow. No one knew how long this silent farewell would last.
###Chapter 831: The Car Was Targeting Her

Evelyn Carter felt slightly uncomfortable with Alexander Hamilton's bluntness. She instinctively tried to sit up, only to gasp in pain as her long hair got trapped under his shoulder.

Alexander immediately shifted, but their movements synchronized again. They exchanged a glance and couldn't help but laugh.

"We really are in sync," he remarked.

Adjusting her posture, Evelyn hesitated before speaking. "Actually... I've been getting strange calls lately. They either hang up after two rings or disconnect immediately. I suspect it's Vincent Croix's doing."

Vincent didn't dare confront Alexander directly, so he resorted to the underhanded tactics from his past. These petty tricks couldn't harm Alexander, but they were irritating. A less resolute person might have taken their frustration out on Bianca Langley.

Alexander's eyes turned icy. He could tolerate Vincent targeting him, but threatening Evelyn—that was crossing a line.

Noticing his change in demeanor, Evelyn regretted bringing it up. "Let's just treat this as casual conversation since there's no proof," she said softly.

Bianca had only moved out less than a day ago. If these harassments diverted Vincent's attention, it might not be entirely bad.

"Mm." Alexander suppressed his anger with effort.

But a few days later, Vivian Dempsey had an accident.

Evelyn never expected to run into Vivian during her night shift—let alone in the emergency room.

Vivian sat in the observation area, a bandage on her forehead as she pressed an ice pack to her face. She looked dazed, not even noticing Evelyn's approach.

"What happened?" Evelyn frowned. Head injuries could range from minor to severe.

"I'm fine!" Vivian shot up but nearly collapsed from dizziness.

Evelyn steadied her, her tone firm. "If you don't tell me the truth, I'll ask the nurses. You know I have plenty of connections here."

Defeated, Vivian confessed. "Just a minor car accident... A van rear-ended me while I was crossing a speed bump. Luckily, it only grazed the safety island. Just a scratch on my forehead." She gestured to the bustling ER. "Compared to the critical patients here, this is nothing."

Evelyn sat beside her. "That's how emergency rooms are. How long did the nurse say you need to stay for observation?"

"Half an hour. If nothing happens, I can leave." Vivian suddenly remembered something. "Oh, right—the van drove off right after hitting me, faster than a rabbit..."

She stopped mid-sentence.

Evelyn sighed. "Finally realized?"

"You mean... it was intentional?!" Vivian's eyes widened. "I've been busy with business deals lately—other than complaining about stingy clients, I haven't offended anyone! I need to call the police!"

Only now did the fear sink in.

Evelyn held her back. "Alexander was followed before."

Vivian gasped. "Vincent? I thought he'd given up after hitting walls a few times. How dare he!" She immediately dialed the police.

But with cloned license plates, the authorities couldn't track it down quickly. Vivian had an important client meeting the next day and had to drop it.

Evelyn took her to the on-call room to change her bandages. "The nurses are swamped. I'll do it."

"You're the best," Vivian said gratefully.

Evelyn remained unmoved. "Tell me—how many times has Vincent approached you?"
###Chapter 832: The More Concealed, the More Exposed

Vivian Dempsey let out a heavy sigh, her fingers absently tapping the desk.

"Vincent somehow found out Miss Liang is staying with me. He keeps calling, demanding I hand her over." She irritably ran a hand through her hair. "Claims I'm ruining their marriage. Ridiculous. I finally blocked him."

Evelyn Carter frowned. "That was reckless. You know what he's capable of when provoked." She paused. "But this confirms he's behind it all."

Vivian started to nod, but Evelyn held her chin steady. "Don't move. I'm not done dressing this wound."

"What's he gonna do? He already made a scene at my office."

Evelyn's hands stilled. "Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Knowing Vivian's temperament, she didn't suspect ulterior motives, just sighed. "When you said you turned him away...please tell me you didn't actually have security throw him out."

"Of course I did!" Vivian's eyes sparkled. "I don't owe him anything. When he tried forcing his way in, I had them lock the gates." Her excitement grew. "If I'd known what he was really like, I'd have had them toss him into the street!"

Evelyn shook her head in amusement. "You're going to end up in the tabloids..."

Alexander Hamilton entered carrying takeout, immediately noticing Vivian in his usual seat. His expression darkened slightly as he cleared his throat. "Time to go home."

Evelyn didn't look up. "Almost done." She gestured to a nearby chair. "Sit."

Alexander quietly moved the chair half a meter closer to Evelyn before sitting. Vivian gave him a cursory glance. "Evening, Mr. Hamilton."

"Miss Dempsey," Alexander's gaze lingered on the gauze at her temple, "this is the OB-GYN department."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Spit it out. No need for subtlety."

Evelyn quickly summarized the situation. Alexander's expression turned grave. "Vincent won't let this go."

"Let him try!" Vivian scoffed. "Men like him deserve to be punched on sight!"

Evelyn restrained her friend's waving fist. "Easy. You're a target now—get some security detail." She considered. "From the company. People we trust."

Vivian reluctantly agreed. As she left, she suddenly added, "Miss Liang is perfectly safe. Vincent will never find her." She winked mysteriously. "You two know the place better than I do."

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged glances, speaking simultaneously: "The resort hotel?"

"How did you—?" Vivian's eyes widened.

Evelyn smiled. "Somewhere habitable that we're both familiar with? Where else could it be?"

Alexander checked his watch, temporarily suppressing the urge to call the resort manager.

......

By the floor-to-ceiling windows of the resort hotel, Bianca Langley stared at her ringing phone. The name "Evelyn Carter" made her fingers tremble.

"Hello?" She forced unnatural cheerfulness into her voice. "I'm fine, really. Why...why are you calling?"

A beat of silence.

"Bianca," Evelyn's gentle yet firm voice came through, "is someone there with you?"
###Chapter 833: Her World Crumbled

Evelyn Carter clutched her phone, her knuckles turning white. Suppressing the surge of worry, she asked softly, "Vivian said you're staying at a Hamilton Group hotel? It's safer there. Let me know if you need anything."

Alexander Hamilton sat nearby, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the armrest. Frost gathered in his eyes. Vincent Croix had dared to target someone under his protection—this debt would be settled sooner or later.

"I'm fine, don't worry." Bianca Langley's voice suddenly grew distant, her words slurring slightly at the edges.

The sound of a glass bottle toppling over echoed through the phone.

Evelyn's breath hitched. She could almost see Bianca curled up on the hotel carpet, empty liquor bottles scattered around her.

"How much have you had?" The question slipped out before she could stop herself.

"Not much." Bianca chuckled faintly, the rustling of fabric suggesting she'd shifted into an even more defeated posture. "I used to drink only when happy. Now? The more I drink, the more bitter it gets."

Evelyn remembered the redness around Bianca's eyes the last time she'd seen her smoking. Back then, she'd still been holding on for Baby Chloe's sake. Now, even that last pillar had collapsed.

"Did Vincent—"

"This time, it wasn't him." Bianca scoffed. "It was those old foxes at Langley Group, urging me to reconcile with Vincent."

The sound of nails scraping against a bottle label came through the line.

"They said my father's legacy needs restructuring, and they need the 'Langley heiress' to make an appearance." Every word dripped with sarcasm. "How laughable. When they betrayed us, no one cared that I bore the Langley name."

Evelyn glanced at the toddler playing by the floor-to-ceiling window. Sunlight gilded the little girl like an angel.

"Baby Chloe took her first steps. Would you like to see her?"

The other end of the line went deathly silent.

"No." Bianca's voice cracked. "Knowing she's happy is enough."

The call ended abruptly. Alexander took Evelyn's icy hand. "Vincent is forcing her out of hiding."

Two days later, Vincent's call came as expected.

"My daughter is with you." His voice slithered like a venomous snake.

Alexander twirled a pen, its tip bleeding ink onto a document. "Planning a career change into screenwriting, Mr. Croix?"

"Alexander Hamilton!" Vincent shed all pretense. "When we meet in court, we'll see if you're still smiling."

The pen snapped in half. Alexander studied the ink staining his fingers and smiled faintly. "Looking forward to it."

Outside the window, storm clouds gathered. The downpour was coming.
###Chapter 834: The Instigator Shall Have No Posterity

When civil disputes reach an impasse, they inevitably follow procedural formalities. Bianca Langley retains custody of Baby Chloe, while Vincent Croix secures visitation rights—provided no one interferes.

If Alexander Hamilton and Evelyn Carter refuse to relinquish the child, Vincent is powerless. Unless he can prove the couple guilty of child abuse.

"Mr. Hamilton, let's speak plainly." Vincent's jaw clenched audibly over the phone. "Bianca and I will reconcile eventually. Surely you understand the principle of preserving marriages over destroying them? When we reunite, how will you and Dr. Carter save face?"

He had dialed the Hamilton residence's long-disused landline—a number retired from business dealings, now only used by Aunt Margaret for leisurely chats. Vincent must have unearthed it from some obscure record.

Alexander detected the veiled threat but didn't so much as twitch an eyebrow.

"Mr. Croix, you seem to have forgotten another adage—'The instigator shall have no posterity.'"

Though Hudson City lies a thousand miles from the capital, Alexander's investigation into that car accident never ceased. Beneath the officially closed case file, undercurrents still churned.

The breathing on the other end noticeably hitched.

"Mr. Hamilton, I've recently acquired a parcel of land." Vincent's voice turned glacial. "Sandwiched between two of Hamilton Group's new developments. Rumor has it your marketing team has been losing sleep over this 'bisected' plot?"

The land lay like a blade across Hamilton Group's commercial empire. Alexander had offered a king's ransom, yet the previous owner remained obstinate as a mule.

Now the mystery unraveled—Vincent had been pulling the strings.

"So you were the bankrupt owner's backer." Alexander's laugh was icy. "No wonder he dared play hardball."

"Backer is too strong a word." Vincent tapped his desk. "Though his outstanding loans were... substantial. Dr. Carter's on night shift today, isn't she? Let's be frank—I'll transfer the land at cost. In return, you withdraw from the child's affairs."

This chess move was meant as his trump card. But Alexander's probes cut too deep. Left unchecked, they risked igniting a fire Vincent couldn't control.

"Are you dictating terms to me?" Alexander's voice dropped dangerously. "Hamilton Group answers to no outsiders."

A lighter clicked distinctly through the receiver.

"No rush. Consider at leisure." Vincent exhaled a smoke ring. "I can sweeten the—"

"Unnecessary." Alexander severed the offer cleanly. "A plot of land isn't worth my integrity." Then his tone shifted abruptly. "Vincent, do you even know what you're truly fighting for?"

"Naturally." Vincent scoffed. "Having secured your own happy ending, you'd sabotage mine?"

"Turn yourself in." Alexander's voice weighed like iron. "For the baby's sake, Bianca might visit you in prison. But to compare yourself to me—" A derisive snort. "That's an insult."

Click. The line went dead. Alexander left the receiver off its cradle—ensuring Vincent would only ever hear a busy signal henceforth.

——

In the OB-GYN Department at Central Hospital, Olivia Lightfoot waggled her eyebrows at Evelyn returning from rounds. "Mr. Hamilton playing the devoted husband again? At this rate, I'll mutate into a Samoyed from all this sweetness."

Evelyn rolled her eyes affectionately before turning to Alexander. "Bed 21's postpartum patient needs attention. Give me five minutes."

Five minutes later, when Evelyn reentered the lobby, the sight froze her pupils to pinpoints.

Alexander's black Maybach had been reduced to a mangled wreck. The windshield spiderwebbed with fractures, the body gouged with horrific dents. Two side mirrors lay severed on the pavement like torn-off ears.

"Eight masked men charged out of nowhere!" The head guard barked into his radio. "All wielding steel pipes! Surveillance, pull the footage now!"

Bystanders buzzed with speculation:
"Those sledgehammers were arm-thick!"
"Definitely medical dispute retaliation!"
"That car costs seven figures... Who'd dare—"

Alexander swept Evelyn behind him in one motion. Their eyes met—both recognizing the same answer in each other's gaze.
###Chapter 835: I Did It

The car was covered in dents, its windshield shattered into a spiderweb pattern. All four tires had been slashed. It was completely totaled—not even worth towing to a repair shop.

Alexander Hamilton tightened his grip on Evelyn Carter's hand, cold sweat trickling down his back. It had been too long since he'd faced such brazen provocation, and he'd foolishly overlooked the threat in Vincent Croix's words.

That so-called "consideration" was nothing but an ultimatum.

His face darkened like storm clouds, but his grip remained carefully controlled. Evelyn felt the warmth of his palm and gently squeezed back, her fingertips brushing soothingly over his knuckles.

"The hospital has comprehensive surveillance. If we can gather evidence..."

Her voice trailed off. Both knew it was wishful thinking to believe a minor case like this could bring Vincent down. If he could hire assassins and pin the blame on others, vandalizing a car was child's play.

The security footage arrived quickly. A group of teenagers with rainbow-dyed hair were seen kicking and smashing the car with arrogant glee. The officers at the precinct groaned at the sight of them. "You again? Your rap sheets are thicker than dictionaries!"

Alexander stood outside the mediation room with a cold smirk. These delinquents were clearly professional scapegoats, exploiting juvenile protection laws without fear. Even knowing Vincent was behind this, there was no way to touch him.

"I was too naive," Evelyn massaged her temples. "If Vincent dared do this, he must've already arranged an escape route."

The officer rubbed his hands awkwardly. "Well... since they're minors, the most we can do is issue warnings. As for compensation, we’ll need to contact their guardians first—"

"Don't bother," Alexander cut him off. "I just want to know why they targeted my car."

The officer looked even more uncomfortable. "They said... they were jealous because your car was too nice."

Fourteen years old—just under the age of criminal responsibility. Vincent's petty tactic was like gum stuck to a shoe, impossible to scrape off.

Evelyn exhaled heavily. The satisfaction of successfully performing a cesarean on a heart failure patient earlier that day evaporated completely.

Alexander appeared calm on the surface—until three days later.

"Shocking! Finance Tycoon Assaulted at Night, Allegedly Drowning Sorrows Over Failed Romance!" Evelyn stifled a laugh as she slid her phone toward Alexander. "This reporter's headline makes it sound like Vincent was heartbroken."

Alexander was picking green peppers out of her dish when his chopsticks paused mid-air. "This has nothing to do with—"

He caught himself too late.

Evelyn's eyes curved into crescents. "So it really was you?"

Clearing his throat, he transferred the asparagus he'd picked onto her plate. "I don’t like these. Don’t waste them." Rushing from a client meeting, they'd had to settle for a random restaurant near the hospital. Though it couldn’t compare to his usual carefully prepared meals, it was better than letting her go hungry.

"Not denying means admitting," she teased, poking at her rice with a deepening smile.

"It was me." Alexander set down his chopsticks. "With someone like Vincent, the only response is tit for tat. Otherwise, next time he’ll come straight for you." He paused. "Same group of delinquents. I paid them double."

Turns out, after leaving the precinct that day, he'd had his bodyguards track down those minors. Lured by the higher payout, they’d promptly ambushed Vincent in an alley. Despite his bodyguards, Vincent took the beating squarely.

He waited for Evelyn's reprimand. She’d always disapproved of such methods.

Instead, she sipped her red date tea leisurely and only said, "Be careful. Miss Langley warned us Vincent’s inferiority complex drives his madness." When she looked up, the worry in her eyes was unmistakable.

Alexander’s chest warmed. Just as he was about to speak, a shadow fell over their table.

Vincent stood beside their booth, a bandage on his brow and bruises still dark around his eye, radiating hostility.

Alexander glanced up indifferently. "You look unwell, Mr. Croix. Care to join us?"
###Chapter 836: Silence Speaks Louder

The invitation couldn't have been more half-hearted.

The booth's couches faced each other, with Alexander Hamilton and Evelyn Carter occupying opposite sides—neither willing to budge.

Vincent Croix stood in the aisle, his face dark with barely contained fury.

"Bring an extra chair," he ground out through clenched teeth to the waiter.

The confused server quickly produced a barstool.

Evelyn watched Vincent's strained expression, her fingers lightly tapping her glass rim. "If this is about Baby Chloe, you can leave now."

Her subtle alignment with Alexander didn't go unnoticed.

Alexander's lips curved as he delivered the finishing blow. "Perhaps you should visit the hospital across the street first?"

"Already did." Vincent's laugh was icy.

His gaze darted between them before lowering his voice. "Let's cut the pretense. I'll concede on the custody matter. As for that land deal we discussed..."

He let the sentence hang, his stare loaded as it landed on Alexander.

Alexander pretended not to hear, carefully refilling Evelyn's tea.

"Then we appreciate your cooperation." Evelyn replaced the cup lid, her tone as casual as discussing the weather.

Vincent's pupils constricted.

He never anticipated Alexander would disclose their entire private conversation.

"Surprised?" Alexander chuckled. "We keep no secrets between us."

The words stabbed Vincent like a dagger.

His fists clenched until his knuckles whitened. "So Bianca Langley's situation..."

"Correct." They answered in unison.

Vincent staggered to his feet, abandoning his carefully prepared bargaining chips as he fled the restaurant in disarray.

"Will he back off?" Evelyn watched the swaying door curtain.

Alexander shook his head. "Men like him only escalate."

He immediately contacted hotel staff to discreetly monitor Bianca.

Yet two days later, a panicked voice came through the phone: "Mr. Hamilton, Miss Langley is gone!"

The room was spotless—only empty liquor bottles in the trash hinted at recent occupancy.

Alexander's brow furrowed as he dialed Vivian Dempsey.

"This better be important!" Vivian's shout vibrated the phone.

"Bianca's missing."

Dead silence.

"Impossible!" Vivian's voice tightened. "She promised she'd tell me before..."

When Vivian arrived at the hotel, Alexander was reviewing security footage.

The cameras showed Bianca entering and exiting normally the previous night—only to vanish by morning.

A nervous staff member handed over a phone. "This is from today's surveillance..."

Alexander's eyes darkened as he studied the screen.

The hallway cameras never captured Bianca's departure.

###Chapter 837 No Mother Would Willingly Leave Her Child

Vivian Dempsey snatched the phone, squinting at the surveillance footage. "This camera angle is all wrong. How could a grown woman just vanish into thin air?"

The waiter nervously wrung his hands. "I...I don't know either..."

Alexander Hamilton stood by the window, his gaze sweeping every corner of the suite. This was the exact room Bianca Langley had stayed in during her last vacation with Baby Chloe. The echoes of laughter still lingered, now replaced by deafening silence.

"You don't think..." Vivian suddenly covered her mouth, eyes widening.

Alexander's expression darkened instantly. This was the exact scenario he and Evelyn Carter had dreaded most.

Chaos engulfed the hotel until a trembling employee reported seeing Bianca waiting alone for a cab in the predawn hours.

The security chief demonstrated multiple times before confirming blind spots in the hallway cameras. Wiping sweat from his brow, he reported with relief, "Mr. Hamilton, Miss Langley could've left without luggage while avoiding surveillance."

"Hmm." Alexander responded indifferently. "Fix the blind spots."

Staff exchanged surprised glances. The notoriously strict CEO was being uncharacteristically lenient. They scattered like startled birds.

Only Alexander and Vivian remained, staring at each other in tense silence.

"Don't tell Evelyn yet," Alexander said gravely. "It's too early for conclusions."

For once, Vivian didn't argue. "I know what's at stake."

Yet her mind raced. Even if Bianca had urgent business, why wouldn't she say goodbye?

Alexander discreetly deployed two teams—one to monitor Vincent Croix, the other to search for Bianca.

By evening, Evelyn finally had time to call Bianca, only to hear the cold automated response:
"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

Evelyn gripped her phone. Only a handful of people knew this new number. Were those meddlesome Langley elders harassing her again?

The thought haunted her all day.

Alexander picked her up in his newly acquired replacement car, chattering about the purchase: "Luckily the dealership kept records. My mother would've noticed if they'd mentioned the previous damage."

Evelyn responded absently. Noticing her exhaustion, Alexander breathed an inward sigh of relief.

Tonight, Margaret Hamilton had taken Grace Anderson and Teresa Taylor shopping. Auntie Wu had left after cooking to watch her dramas. Only they and the children remained in the dining room.

Baby Chloe babbled while playing with a spoon, then suddenly looked up and clearly called out, "Mama!"

Evelyn's heart clenched.

At that moment, an unknown number flashed on her phone.

The caller remained silent after she answered. Only faint breathing came through the receiver.

"Auntie Bianca had to go away for work," Evelyn gently told the children. "She'll come back when she's done."

Lily Waters blinked her large eyes. "Did Auntie Bianca get a new boyfriend? Is that why she can't take care of Baby Chloe?"

All three adults froze.

Alexander rarely showed confusion. "Why would you think that?"

"Because Baby Chloe is still here," Lily said innocently. "If parents could be together, they'd never leave their child. Last time we saw Auntie Bianca, she was with that uncle—just the two of them."
###Chapter 838: The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing

Lily Waters' innocent words dropped like a stone into still water, sending ripples through Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton's hearts. Was Bianca Langley keeping her distance because she feared her hatred for Vincent Croix might spill over onto her innocent child?

But who was that mysterious man?

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Alexander. Neither believed Bianca would start a new relationship so soon after Adrian Valentine's death—though Adrian would surely have blessed her happiness from beyond.

"That uncle was taller than Miss Langley," Lily recalled, scrunching her forehead. "Dressed as formally as Mr. Hamilton." Her eyes suddenly brightened. "Wait! I've seen him on TV!"

With practiced fingers, the girl pulled up a news clip on her phone. The screen illuminated, stealing both adults' breath simultaneously.

"Could it be...a mistake?" Evelyn's voice trembled—her second time today doubting Lily's memory.

Pursing her lips, Lily recounted every detail. She and Lotus often visited the city on weekends. That day at Wetland Park—dubbed "Lovers' Sanctuary"—she'd instantly recognized Bianca by that unforgettable red dress.

"The same one Miss Langley wore when we first met," the girl affirmed.

Evelyn's chest tightened. Bianca hadn't touched that dress since Adrian's passing. She hastily noted the park's address. "Sweetheart, I do trust you—"

Lily just giggled and skipped away.

Under cover of darkness, the couple entrusted Baby Chloe to Margaret Hamilton and Auntie Wu.

"We have some research," Evelyn explained.

Margaret's knowing smile prompted Alexander to hastily excuse himself, citing the baby's feeding schedule.

In their bedroom, a tablet played Vincent's televised interview. The man on screen—immaculate suit, gold-rimmed glasses radiating warmth—bore no resemblance to the venomous creature from their memories.

"Monster in a three-piece suit," Evelyn spat.

Alexander frowned as Vincent smoothly declared, "My journey from a backwater town proves all critics are merely jealous."

The host pressed: "Your relationship with the Langley family—"

"I'll forever be grateful for their mentorship." Vincent's smile didn't reach his arctic eyes. "Without them, I wouldn't exist."

Evelyn's fists clenched. These polished lies were salt rubbed into the Langleys' wounds.

"He's making his move," Alexander realized abruptly.

Onscreen, Vincent gazed into the camera with theatrical tenderness: "My door always stands open if Bianca chooses to return."

Evelyn shot upright. "He knows!"

Outside, lightning split the night sky. The storm had arrived.
###Chapter 839: Shattering the Last Pretense

The host's professionally made-up face maintained a practiced smile as she smoothly steered the conversation from business to personal matters. The interview show Success Stories was well-known in Hudson City for its incisive questioning, often uncovering lesser-known aspects of its guests.

Alexander Hamilton frowned slightly at the television screen. He pulled out his phone and quickly sent a message to a media contact.

"Vincent Croix reached out to the production team himself," he said calmly, pocketing his phone. "He was very generous with the sponsorship fee."

Evelyn Carter's gaze lingered on the barrage of comments flooding the screen:

—Mr. Croix is so devoted
—Miss Langley is being unreasonable
—Business marriages are always like this

She reached out and turned off the comments. "The paid trolls are obvious."

Alexander's lips curled into a cold smile. "He certainly knows how to perform."

On screen, Vincent Croix was speaking with affected tenderness: "Miss Langley and I simply had a misunderstanding..."

Evelyn fast-forwarded, catching Vincent's choked-up words: "If they're willing to come back, I'd give up everything."

"Including the Langley Group?" the host pressed.

"That was always the Langley family's business," Vincent said, eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I'm preparing to launch a new company—I hope to see them at the ribbon-cutting..."

Evelyn jabbed the pause button. "He knows Bianca hates this kind of spectacle!"

On screen, Vincent looked every inch the devoted husband in his tailored suit. But Evelyn remembered the icy chill in Bianca's eyes whenever she spoke of him.

"He thinks this will win her back?" Alexander's voice was frigid. "How naive."

A week later, crystal chandeliers illuminated the banquet hall of a high-profile business reception. The moment Alexander entered, he spotted Vincent holding court, surrounded by admirers.

"Mr. Hamilton!" A mutual acquaintance greeted him enthusiastically. "I hear Mr. Croix's new company will be right next to your project? You'll have to look out for each other."

Vincent approached with a champagne flute, deliberately holding it lower. "It would be my honor if Mr. Hamilton could attend."

Alexander didn't move, his own glass suspended mid-air. "You have quite the methods, Mr. Croix."

The air around them seemed to freeze. Vincent's smile didn't waver. "You flatter me. Just trying to get by."

Their gazes locked in silent combat while onlookers mistook it for casual banter. Only when a waiter accidentally knocked over a glass did the tension break.

Evelyn was reviewing medical records when Alexander called.

"He's making his move," his low voice came through the line. "The new company is right next to our project."

She set down her pen. "Does Bianca know?"

"Couldn't reach her yet." A pause. "But given Vincent's style, she'll find out soon enough."

Outside, night deepened. Evelyn studied her reflection in the window, recalling Bianca's parting words: "Some people never know when to stop."

Silence stretched between them. Both understood—this was only the beginning.
###Chapter 840: Laying Cards on the Table

Vincent Croix stood before Alexander Hamilton with a wine glass, his posture oozing sycophantic humility.

Alexander watched him coldly, seeing right through the charade. Refusing this toast would fuel Hudson City’s business gossip by morning.

The Liang family affair was already a sensitive topic. Adding speculative whispers could twist the narrative beyond recognition. His reputation meant little, but Evelyn and Baby Chloe didn’t deserve collateral damage.

"Mr. Hamilton, the honor?" Vincent pushed the glass closer.

Alexander’s lips twitched as he clinked glasses with the speed of swatting a fly.

Guests exchanged uneasy glances. No one dared breathe a word—one man was a titan of industry, the other a notorious loose cannon.

Vincent’s smile never faltered. "Your decisiveness inspires me. Our new company launches next month—I’d value your presence."

The casual words hid daggers. Alexander’s temple throbbed, knuckles whitening.

"Certainly." The two syllables grated through clenched teeth.

Their host swooped in to defuse tensions. Both men seamlessly shifted to hollow corporate pleasantries. Vincent praised Alexander’s philanthropy; Alexander countered by strong-arming him into funding a school.

That night, while rocking Chloe to sleep, Alexander recounted the exchange to Evelyn.

"He agreed on the spot. If he backtracks, I’ll make him regret it."

Evelyn stifled a laugh. "Extortion much?"

"Redistributing wealth," he said without remorse. "Fighting fire with fire."

Two days later, Vincent materialized like a specter at a charity gala.

"What a coincidence." He approached with champagne, eyes darting between them. "Bringing family to work events, Mr. Hamilton?"

Evelyn stepped forward smoothly. "The organizers invited me to give a medical lecture, Mr. Croix."

"Of course." Vincent feigned enlightenment. "Perfect timing—I’d like to donate a primary school in Chloe’s name. Your thoughts?"

Alexander’s gaze turned glacial.

Evelyn rested a hand on his arm, meeting Vincent’s stare head-on. "Let’s be clear. You’re not taking Chloe. Ever."

Vincent’s expression darkened. "How versed are you in custody law, Doctor?"

"Less than you," she conceded mildly. "But hospitals teach us plenty. Like recognizing absentee parents who suddenly want involvement—ones who don’t even know their child’s mango allergy."

The verbal blade found its mark. Veins bulged at Vincent’s temple, but the setting shackled his temper.

Alexander shifted protectively in front of Evelyn. Together, they formed an impenetrable wall.

Vincent studied them before a mirthless smile curled his lips. "This isn’t over."

As he turned, his champagne flute shattered against the floor.
###Chapter 841: Leaving Without a Word

Vincent Croix's face darkened with fury.

His gaze locked onto the empty space between Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton—where a baby stroller should have been. That detail stabbed at his heart like a thorn.

"Nickname?" He let out a cold laugh. "I don't even know her full name."

Alexander swirled his wine glass leisurely. "You're joking, Mr. Croix. Weren’t you parading the baby around at the Langley family’s full-moon celebration?"

Vincent's knuckles turned white.

He had held the child that day. But his mind had been too preoccupied with securing his place in the Langley family to even take a proper look at her tiny face.

"Your memory is impressive, Mr. Hamilton," he ground out.

Evelyn gently tugged at Alexander’s sleeve.

Their eyes met, and Alexander smoothly shifted the topic. "I heard Croix Group is bidding for the land in the eastern district?"

Before Vincent could respond, a commotion erupted at the banquet hall entrance.

"It’s Miss Langley!"

"Why is she here?"

Whispers rippled through the crowd. Every eye turned toward the figure in a red gown.

Bianca Langley strode through the crowd in her high heels, her smile radiant. She even waved at a few acquaintances, as if the turmoil of the past six months had never happened.

Evelyn’s heart clenched.

She instinctively checked her phone and saw a missed call from an unknown number. Just as she was about to call back, it vibrated again.

"Hello?"

Heavy breathing came from the other end.

"Miss Langley?" Evelyn kept her voice low. "Where are you?"

"Dr. Carter..." Bianca’s voice was hoarse. "No matter what happens next, please believe me."

"What do you mean?"

"I would never hurt you."

The call ended abruptly. When Evelyn tried redialing, the phone was already off.

Her fingers trembled slightly.

Alexander noticed immediately. "What’s wrong?"

"Miss Langley..." She gripped her phone tightly. "She said something unexpected is about to happen."

Alexander’s expression hardened. He pulled Evelyn close and murmured, "Let’s go. Now."

Vincent blocked their path. "What’s going on?"

"Move." Alexander’s tone was icy.

At that moment, all the lights in the banquet hall went out. In the darkness, Bianca’s voice echoed through the speakers:

"Thank you all for coming to this special charity gala."

A spotlight suddenly illuminated the center of the stage. Bianca stood at the podium, a remote control in her hand.

"Tonight, I’m auctioning off 32% of Croix Group’s shares."

Gasps filled the room.

Vincent’s face turned ashen. "Have you lost your mind?!"

Bianca smirked. "These shares are enough to make any of you the second-largest shareholder of Croix Group." Her gaze swept over the crowd before landing on Vincent. "Starting bid—one dollar."

Evelyn inhaled sharply.

Alexander immediately made a call. "Trace Bianca Langley’s financial activity for the last three months."

On stage, Bianca pressed the remote. The screen behind her lit up, displaying a series of stock transfer documents.

"These shares were all bought with Mr. Croix’s money." She chuckled. "Thank you for the generous 'dowry' you’ve given the Langley family over the years."

Vincent lunged toward the stage but was stopped by security.

"Bianca Langley!" he roared. "Do you have any idea what you’re doing?"

Bianca looked down at him coolly. "Of course I do." She turned back to the stunned guests. "Let the auction begin."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed again. A text from an unknown number:

"Take the baby and leave the hotel. Now."

After reading it, Alexander didn’t hesitate. He pulled Evelyn toward the exit. Behind them, Vincent’s enraged shouts and escalating bids filled the air.

"Get the baby," Alexander said tersely. "Bianca is going scorched earth."

Evelyn’s heart pounded. "What is she planning?"

"I don’t know." He jabbed the elevator button. "But Vincent is going to snap tonight."

As the elevator doors closed, the sound of shattering glass erupted from the banquet hall.
###Chapter 842: I'm Perfectly Fine

Evelyn Carter stood by the window, phone in hand. The sunlight outside was bright, but it couldn't penetrate the worry in her eyes. Bianca Langley had left too few clues—that convenience store call was like a kite with a severed string, impossible to trace.

Alexander Hamilton entered just as she was staring blankly at her phone screen.

"Found it," he said, hanging his suit jacket on the coat rack. "It's a 24-hour convenience store in the east district. The clerk said she only bought a bottle of water and left without even taking her change."

Evelyn turned. "How did she look?"

"Like a lost tourist, but coherent." Alexander loosened his tie. "She deliberately chose a blind spot for the cameras. Clearly didn’t want to be found."

Evelyn sighed softly. Bianca had always been sharp. If she didn’t want to be found, no one could.

"Any movement from Vincent?" she changed the subject.

Alexander smirked. "He’s been unusually quiet. Heard he even removed the cot from his office and moved back to his penthouse downtown."

"Playing the devoted husband now that he’s got the Langley Group?" Evelyn scoffed.

The early summer breeze carried the scent of flowers through the window. Baby Chloe babbled in her crib, tiny hands waving. Evelyn walked over and gently rocked the cradle.

"I’m on night shift tomorrow," she said suddenly. "Let’s take a walk down the pedestrian street after work. I heard Lily’s got a new batch of handmade toys."

Alexander nodded, his gaze settling on the baby. "She could use some new ones."

The next evening, the wind was unusually gentle. As Evelyn stepped out of the hospital, she saw Alexander waiting under a streetlamp, pushing the stroller. Baby Chloe, in a soft yellow hat, was happily playing with the hanging toys.

"Being so good today?" Evelyn bent down to tease the baby, who immediately giggled.

The pedestrian street buzzed with activity. Lily’s stall was swarmed with customers, her brother Lotus scrambling to handle payments. Spotting them, Lily’s eyes lit up, and she pulled out a woven grass rabbit from under the counter.

"Dr. Carter! I saved this especially for the baby!"

Just as Evelyn was about to thank her, Lotus suddenly blurted, "We saw Auntie Bianca yesterday! At the café up ahead!"

The air froze. Alexander’s grip tightened unconsciously on the stroller handle.

"You’re sure?" Evelyn’s voice was tense.

Lily nodded eagerly. "She was wearing a red dress, as pretty as ever. But..." She hesitated. "There was a man in a black suit with her. Looked kinda scary."

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged a glance. Then, a familiar voice came from behind:

"What a coincidence."

Dressed in fiery red, Bianca strode over in high heels. Her makeup was flawless, lips a bold crimson, with no trace of her former exhaustion. More surprising, Vincent stood two steps behind her, wearing a smug smile.

"Miss Langley..." Evelyn was momentarily speechless.

Bianca reached out to stroke the baby’s cheek, her touch feather-light, as if handling fragile porcelain. "Long time no see. She’s grown so much."

Alexander eyed Vincent warily. "You two..."

"Relax," Bianca chuckled. "We just happened to run into each other." She turned to Vincent, her gaze as calm as if he were a stranger. "Mr. Croix offered to buy me coffee, but I don’t like bitter things."

Vincent’s smile stiffened.

"Miss Langley," Evelyn couldn’t help asking, "have you been... alright?"

Bianca’s red lips curved, but her eyes were deep and unreadable. "I’m perfectly fine."

She bent to kiss the baby’s forehead, then turned away, her skirt flaring like a flickering flame before she vanished into the crowd. Vincent stood stunned for a moment before hastily chasing after her.

Evelyn stared at the direction they’d gone, her fingers unconsciously clenching the stroller handle. Alexander gently took her hand—her palm was ice-cold.

"Something’s wrong with her," Evelyn murmured.

Alexander frowned at where Bianca had disappeared. "What the hell did Vincent do to her?"
###Chapter 843: Stubbornly Awaiting Her Response

The gazes of surrounding guests grew increasingly curious.

The friendship between the Hamilton and Langley families was common knowledge, but when had Bianca Langley become so close with the future Mrs. Hamilton?

After Lydia Laurent's scandal, Evelyn Carter's true identity was no longer a secret. The public assumed her remarriage to Alexander Hamilton was inevitable—only the couple's silence kept the "future" prefix in place.

Bianca ignored the probing stares, smiling brightly at Mrs. Stapleton. "You look radiant. Mother mentioned you just the other day."

Evelyn noticed Bianca deliberately maintaining distance, her chest tightening. She recognized her friend's protective gesture but worried more about Bianca's current predicament.

Alexander wordlessly enveloped Evelyn's cool fingers in his warm, dry grasp.

Only when instinctively returning the pressure did Evelyn realize her lapse. As their fingers intertwined, her chaotic thoughts miraculously stilled.

The charity gala had two segments: a cocktail reception followed by an auction. Alexander, as foundation chair, navigated such events effortlessly. Evelyn aimed to secure more donations for mountain village children.

Guests settled into seats before the auction.

Vincent Croix, the finance prodigy, was seated at Alexander's table. Bianca sat directly across from Evelyn, maintaining precise distance from Vincent.

Evelyn sipped tea, casting Bianca a questioning glance.

As lights dimmed and spotlights illuminated the auction stage, Bianca responded with a dazzling smile, her eyes glinting with familiar mischief.

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly, her gaze meaningfully flicking toward Vincent.

Vincent's stare remained fixed on Bianca. Even without reciprocation, he stubbornly watched her, his scorching gaze nearly burning holes through her.

"Aren't they divorced?" whispered a nearby guest. "Didn't Mr. Croix publicly apologize in that interview?"

"Rumor says there's a life between them..."

Bianca remained expressionless, slender fingers lightly tapping her wineglass.

Evelyn abruptly pushed her water glass forward.

Clatter—

Tea splashed across Bianca's crimson skirt.

"My apologies." Evelyn stood.

"No matter." Bianca rose smoothly.

A lean hand offered a handkerchief.

Vincent had materialized beside her, murmuring to the neighboring gentleman, "Might we switch seats?"

The man practically fled.

Evelyn swiftly tossed tissues. Bianca caught them with a wink, ignoring the suspended handkerchief.

"Tonight's first lot is my reproduction of..." The host's voice rang out perfectly timed.

Vincent's hand hung midair before slowly retracting. He crushed the linen until blood seeped through the fabric, only then noticing his lapse.

The auction proceeded fervently. The straw weavings donated by Evelyn's group fetched astonishing prices under bids from businessmen courting Hamilton favor.

When the next item reached the podium, the auctioneer's expression froze.

Was this donation... appropriate?
###Chapter 844: The Bare Ring Finger

The auctioneer nervously wiped sweat from his brow, his gaze repeatedly darting toward the event organizers.

After receiving silent approval, he cleared his throat. "The next item is a pair of diamond wedding bands donated by Mr. Vincent Croix. These rings were once exchanged between him and his ex-wife. Mr. Croix wishes to contribute to education as atonement for irreparable mistakes in his marriage..."

The ballroom plunged into eerie silence.

Even breathing became inaudible.

Guests openly stared or stole glances behind raised glasses, their eyes shifting between Vincent and Bianca Langley.

Bianca sipped champagne with an impassive expression.

Vincent kept his gaze fixed on the auction stage as if the rings held no connection to him.

"One million, going once..."

"One million, going twice..."

"One million, sold!"

The rings were bought back at starting price—by Vincent himself.

Evelyn Carter watched coldly, fingertips absently tracing her glass rim. She knew Vincent's game too well—this was a meticulously staged melodrama.

After the auction, the four departed with separate agendas.

Early summer wind carried a tipsy warmth as Bianca walked ahead alone, her ten-centimeter heels clicking. Her slender frame looked paper-thin under the streetlights.

"Miss Langley!" Evelyn hurried after her.

Bianca turned. Her wedding band glinted coldly under the lamplight.

"Dr. Carter." Her smile didn't reach her hollow eyes. "Thank you for caring for Baby Chloe."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "How have you been—"

"I saw the auroras." Bianca gazed at the stars. "Adrian promised to take me."

Headlights suddenly tore through the darkness.

"Look out—!"

Alexander Hamilton's shout shattered the night.

Evelyn was yanked into a warm embrace as tires screeched. In that split second, she saw Vincent lunging desperately toward Bianca.

Thud.

Vincent's body crumpled five meters away like a broken doll.

Bianca collapsed by a flowerbed, stockings torn by bushes, blood snaking down her calves.

"Call an ambulance!" Alexander lifted Evelyn, his glare sharp as the fleeing taillights vanished.

The ER lights glared mercilessly.

Bianca sat motionless as nurses treated her wounds—until Vincent's critical condition was announced. She suddenly seized scissors.

Snip.

Bloodstained fabric fluttered to the floor.

"Miss—?" The nurse gaped.

"I don't know that man." Bianca slammed the scissors down. As she turned, her ring cracked against an IV pole.

Down the hall, Alexander barked into his phone: "Trace that vehicle. I want whoever's behind this."

Evelyn handed him water, fingers trembling. "Too coincidental. Like..."

"Like last time." His fist clenched. "Except Vincent nearly got himself killed."

Amid antiseptic smells, Bianca watched dawn brighten the windows and suddenly laughed. "Tell me... isn't this karma?"

She raised her hand. Only a pale band of skin remained where her ring had been.
###Chapter 845: This Was Exactly What He Wanted

Evelyn's fingers twisted together unconsciously. The image of Vincent pushing her away lingered in her mind.

"Are you thinking about what just happened?" she asked softly. "He did save someone this time, but..."

She swallowed her words. Voicing baseless suspicions would only cause unnecessary distress.

Bianca spoke first. "You also think this car accident is too coincidental, don't you?"

Evelyn exhaled in relief and lowered her voice. "I suspect this is his self-harm strategy. High risk, but enormous rewards. If successful, he not only clears his name but makes everyone see him as the victim."

"Mr. Valentine's accident was only three months ago. Two car crashes in succession—anyone would think the mastermind is a reckless fool."

Who was Vincent Croix? A man infamous in the business world for his ruthlessness and meticulous planning. How could such a man make such an amateurish mistake?

Unless—this was exactly the impression he wanted to give.

Evelyn stopped short. "Miss Langley, I know I shouldn't speculate maliciously, but..."

"I understand." Bianca closed her eyes, her lashes trembling slightly. "On the way to the hospital, I was already thinking about how to prove this."

No wonder she had been eerily quiet during the ride.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "Should you go home and rest first?"

If this was truly Vincent's orchestrated act, he wouldn’t be in any real danger. Waiting here was pointless.

But Bianca shook her head, a dark glint flashing in her eyes. "You two go ahead. I have some unfinished business."

She had prepared thoroughly for their "reunion," never expecting the opportunity to arrive so suddenly.

"This is a hospital," Evelyn said anxiously, grabbing her hand. "Don’t do anything reckless."

Given Bianca’s fiery temperament, strangling the man who had schemed against her wouldn’t be surprising.

Bianca suddenly smiled. "Don’t worry. I won’t... take action here."

That slight pause made Evelyn’s heart skip a beat.

Alexander approached with the medical report. "Vincent only has minor injuries and a slight concussion, but he hasn’t regained consciousness." He frowned. "The doctor said he should’ve woken up by now."

Evelyn replied coolly, "The scans are clear. He’s probably just knocked out."

Bianca smirked sarcastically. "I’ll cover the medical bills. Mr. Hamilton, hand me any documents that need signing."

Alexander understood immediately and passed her the paperwork without another word.

After signing, Bianca didn’t spare a glance toward the hospital room, leaving her contact number before walking out.

At the hospital entrance, Evelyn remained uneasy. "Do you want to see the baby?"

Bianca paused, emotions flickering in her eyes. But she quickly composed herself. "No. Sometimes she looks like me, sometimes like him... Our fate ends here."

The best thing she could do for her child now was to stay away.

Alexander interjected, "We’ll take you home. Where are you staying?"

Bianca gave an address that stunned them both.

"The house we lived in when we were married," she said flatly, as if discussing someone else’s life.

Evelyn gasped. "Aren’t you afraid he’ll come looking for you?"

Bianca scoffed. "He’s the one who should be afraid. If he dares to show up, I might actually respect him for it."

The most dangerous place was the safest. Vincent would never imagine that the woman he’d been desperately searching for was living in their former marital home.

Alexander insisted on escorting her home. The three-story villa stood eerily desolate in the night.

Evelyn stared at the darkened windows, her worry deepening. "Are you sure you don’t want to move somewhere else?"

"No need." Bianca pulled out her keys. "Want to come in? You’ve never visited my place, have you?"
###Chapter 846: The Feeling of Being Alive

At Bianca Langley and Vincent Croix's wedding years ago, Alexander Hamilton and Evelyn Carter were still legally married but had become like strangers. They silently skipped the ceremony and never set foot in the newlyweds' mansion.

Alexander glanced at Evelyn, waiting for her decision.

She checked her watch—just past nine. "Alright, we'll take you up on that."

Bianca pushed open the car door, breathing in the night air. "I've been alone too long. Need someone to talk to. These days I barely see sunlight—my sleep schedule's completely reversed."

"But tonight—" Evelyn hesitated, eyeing Bianca's pallid complexion.

Bianca tossed her curls. "Right. Tonight's different."

The two women walked toward the villa side by side, Alexander parking before following. At the threshold, he suddenly turned toward the darkness—only rustling trees met his gaze.

Probably just his imagination.

The bridal suite blazed with light, crystal chandeliers casting prisms across marble floors. Yet closer inspection revealed broken furniture piled in corners, a rolled-up carpet, and scorch marks on the walls.

Bianca rummaged through the kitchen, producing two water bottles. "Make do with these." She grabbed a half-empty brandy bottle from the fridge and took a deep swig.

Evelyn remembered Bianca's deft fingers mixing cocktails at the lounge bar—back when Adrian Valentine was still alive, when her eyes still sparkled.

"Forty-proof liquor," Alexander frowned. "This will end badly."

"Miss Langley, you can talk to us," Evelyn said, watching Bianca's reddened fingertips.

Bianca shook the bottle. "I wish I could get drunk. Just pass out cold." She didn't mention the insomnia that haunted her without alcohol.

Evelyn scanned the room. The vaulted living room walls held glaring blank spaces—where wedding portraits should've hung.

"Maybe a change of scenery—"

"I need this." Bianca suddenly raised her bottle. "To my success." Her smile sent a chill down Evelyn's spine.

A phone rang sharply. Bianca checked the unknown number—her gaze instantly sharpening.

"Mm."
"Unnecessary."
"Let him."

The call ended abruptly.

Evelyn blinked. "You reactivated your old number?"

Bianca coughed on her drink. Alexander handed her a tissue: "The hospital? Not worried Vincent will trace it?"

"I hope he does." Bianca wiped her lips. "That man—the more obvious the clue, the more convoluted paths he'll take to believe it."

Her laugh turned bitter. "Back then I gave him my heart, and he thought I was acting. Now? Everyone around him is dead. Satisfied?"

Evelyn remembered the pregnant woman who took her own life, fingers turning cold. "Don't follow her example. People like him never stop testing—who but the dead could pass forever?"

Alexander's jaw tightened, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn unconsciously thought of Baby Chloe. That pure little life, mercifully spared from the monster.

"I know." Bianca gazed into the night, her eyes drifting far away.
###Chapter 847: A Grave Misunderstanding

Alexander Hamilton frowned, sensing something amiss. "What did the call say?"

Bianca Langley let out a cold laugh and tossed her phone onto the couch. "Vincent Croix woke up. Throwing a tantrum at the hospital."

Disgust flickered in her eyes. "The nurses said he kept calling my name, asking about me. Hah. I told them to let him rot."

Evelyn Carter exchanged a glance with Alexander, both seeing the concern mirrored in each other's gaze.

"If they really want to resuscitate him," Bianca said idly, tracing her nails, "I'd be more than happy to sign the DNR form."

Outside, the night deepened. Evelyn quietly draped a blanket over Bianca, who had curled up asleep on the couch.

Before leaving, Alexander made a call to the hospital for confirmation.

"He's still in his room," he said, hanging up, his frown deepening.

In the dimly lit hospital room, Vincent Croix reclined against the headboard, the stark white bandages on his face glaring under the muted lights.

"Keep watching," he murmured into the phone.

The man standing by the bed scoffed. "What's the point? Her heart belongs to a dead man. Who's this pathetic act for?"

Vincent's gaze turned icy. "Watch your mouth."

The man clamped his lips shut but flashed a venomous look as he turned away.

The next afternoon, Evelyn pulled Alexander to Vincent's hospital room.

"How long does he plan to stay?" she whispered.

Alexander's expression darkened as he observed Vincent reviewing documents inside. "Not a ploy. Just insanity."

As they turned to leave, hushed whispers reached them from the nurses' station.

"Oh my god, it's really him!"
"So romantic—risking his life to save his ex-wife..."

Evelyn froze. She approached the counter. "What's going on?"

A young nurse eagerly handed over her phone. "Dr. Carter, look!"

A video played on the screen—slow-motion footage of Vincent pushing Bianca out of harm's way, set to a dramatic soundtrack. The likes had already surpassed a million.

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

Alexander immediately offered his own phone. "Use mine."

The trending page was flooded with the hashtag #DevotedTycoon, filled with fabricated "love stories" between Vincent and Bianca.

The top post featured an old clip of them at a business event, the comments unanimously gushing about "second chances" and "true love conquers all."

Evelyn's heart sank.

This misunderstanding had spiraled out of control.
###Chapter 848: Afraid I'll Hit Him?

Alexander Hamilton stood beside Evelyn Carter, his brow furrowed as he stared at his phone screen. His long fingers hovered over the call button, but he never pressed it.

"The platform's complaint system is too slow," he muttered darkly.

Evelyn tapped the report button with a sigh. "At least we should try."

The internet was flooded with old videos of Vincent Croix and Bianca Langley. Carefully edited clips painted their broken marriage as a fairy tale. The fabricated sweetness turned Evelyn's stomach.

"Complaints from the involved parties would be more effective." Alexander's gaze shifted toward the end of the hallway.

Evelyn immediately understood. "The last thing Bianca needs right now is to see this."

"But the other party is right next door." Alexander took the phone and strode out. "Rest. I'll handle it."

The hospital room door flew open. Vincent lounged in bed scrolling through his phone. Seeing Alexander, his lips curled into a mocking smirk. "To what do I owe the honor, Mr. Hamilton? Come to visit your 'rival in love'?"

Alexander tossed the phone onto the sheets. A looped video played—Vincent "heroically saving" Bianca.

"Delete it." Alexander's voice was glacial.

Vincent feigned confusion. "Freedom of speech, Mr. Hamilton. You're overstepping."

"Using dirty tricks to force Bianca back?" Alexander's laugh was icy. "You're even more despicable than I thought."

The air in the room froze. Vincent's face darkened, fingers twisting the sheets.

"I suggest you stop while you're ahead." Alexander looked down at him. "You know Bianca's temper. This will only push her further away."

Vincent suddenly grinned. "Mr. Hamilton seems awfully concerned about my ex-wife. Does Dr. Carter know?"

"Don't bother trying to provoke me." Alexander's gaze sharpened like a blade. "Someone like you doesn't deserve to be a father."

The standoff was broken by a light knock.

Bianca leaned against the doorframe, oversized sunglasses hiding half her face. Without makeup, her pallor was striking—only the faint curve of her lips held remnants of her usual fire.

"Finished talking?" she asked softly.

Alexander instinctively stepped aside, then immediately blocked the space between them. Bianca noticed the subtle movement, her smile deepening.

"What?" She removed her sunglasses, revealing healing bruises near her eyes. "Afraid I'll hit him?"
###Chapter 849: Lingering Warmth in the Palm

"No." Alexander Hamilton's expression remained unreadable. "A hospital isn't the place for that."

The memory of their last encounter in that dark alley flashed through his mind, his eyes turning icy.

Vincent Croix's face stiffened, his lips twitching. "Mr. Hamilton seems quite experienced."

He deliberately turned his injured cheek toward Bianca Langley as she approached. "I didn't expect you to come."

Bianca's stilettos clicked against the floor as she walked closer. Behind her sunglasses, her gaze was sharp as a blade. "Just checking if you're dead yet."

She casually pulled a photo frame from her bag and smashed it onto the ground.

The wooden frame splintered into pieces, the photograph slipping out.

Alexander glanced down, his brows furrowing instantly.

It was a picture of Bianca and Vincent, with their baby nestled between them. He remembered clearly—it was taken during the baby's hundred-day celebration.

Vincent struggled out of bed, staggering as he picked up the photo. The hospital gown hung loosely on his frame, his bloody palm staining the edges of the picture.

"Now you care?" Bianca sneered. "Why didn't you stop me when I burned the rest?"

Vincent's Adam's apple bobbed. "I'm sorry..."

"Do you remember how this photo was taken?" Bianca's voice trembled.

Vincent clenched the photo tighter, oblivious to the glass shards digging into his palm.

Alexander spoke up suddenly. "The baby wouldn't stop crying that day until she saw the balloons. The photographer captured that exact moment."

Vincent's hand shook slightly.

Blood dripped onto the photograph.

"I'll make it right..." His voice was hoarse.

"Don't bother." Bianca cut him off. "I'm here today for answers."

She turned to Alexander. "I'd like you to witness this."

Alexander sighed and nodded.

Vincent shot him a dark look. "Ask away."

"What really happened with last night's car accident?"

"Probably enemies seeking revenge." Vincent gave a bitter smile. "I dragged you into it."

Bianca's lips curled mockingly.

"Second question." She extended her hand. "Why was this photo on your desk?"

As Vincent handed it over, he suddenly grasped her wrist.

Bianca tried to pull away but couldn't break free.

Alexander stepped forward, but Bianca shook her head. "Just bear witness, Mr. Hamilton."

Vincent stared at her sunglasses before slowly releasing her. "I just... wanted to remember what I missed."

His blood smeared across Bianca's hand.
###Chapter 850: Blood for Blood

"Regret?" Bianca Langley sneered, yanking her hand away.

A drop of Vincent Croix's blood fell onto her pale wrist like a crimson serpent. She grabbed a tissue and scrubbed violently until her skin turned red.

Alexander Hamilton stood by the window, fingertips tapping the sill. He should've known—that eerie feeling of being watched outside Bianca's home wasn't his imagination.

"I found Baby Chloe's photo while cleaning our marital home," Vincent rasped. "Just didn't get to tell you."

Bianca's sunglasses reflected icy light. "Marital home? The one you smashed to pieces?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. He had returned before she came back to the country. Shattered glass and overturned furniture had erased all traces of his existence.

"One last question." Bianca suddenly closed in on the hospital bed. "Did you have anything to do with Adrian Valentine's death?"

The air froze.

Alexander narrowed his eyes. The moment Vincent threatened Evelyn Carter, he'd already sentenced this man to death. Blood debts demanded blood payment—justice served.

"We loved each other so much," Vincent's eyes reddened. "Is this how little you trust me?"

"First time was an accident. Second time too?" Bianca's voice dripped venom. "Vincent, do you really think I'm stupid?"

"I swear!" Vincent slammed his fist onto the bed, IV stand rattling violently. "Adrian's death had nothing to do with me!"

Whispers rippled through the gathered crowd outside.

"That couple from the viral video is hospitalized here..."
"The tension's terrifying—who's that man beside them..."

As Alexander moved to shut the door, a cool voice cut through the noise.

"2:10 PM." Evelyn Carter stood at the crowd's edge, clutching medical charts. "Don't you people have jobs?"

The onlookers scattered like startled birds.

Evelyn entered the room, instinctively positioning herself beside Alexander. A corner of a surgery consent form peeked from her white coat pocket, stained with fresh blood.

"No rest?" Alexander took the charts from her.

"Sleep any longer and I'll get complaints." Her gaze swept over Vincent. "Besides, you're making quite the scene."

Vincent glowered. "Something you need, Dr. Carter?"

"Front row seats to the drama." Her bluntness was jarring.

Alexander summarized the situation in three sentences. Bianca suddenly chuckled, her expression unreadable behind dark lenses.

"Need a witness?" Evelyn produced an ink pad from her pocket. "My office has a printer."

Vincent stared desperately at Bianca. "I'll return the Langley Group shares right now." His voice shook. "Surely you'll believe me now?"

Bianca's fingers trembled slightly. This money-obsessed man was willing to spit out his prize?

Maybe...it really wasn't him?

She crushed the thought the instant it surfaced. Yet her heart still twisted painfully.

"Oh." Bianca finally uttered the single syllable before turning on her heel.

Evelyn and Alexander followed.

Watching her retreating back, Vincent pressed the call button. As the nurse removed glass shards from his palm, his lips curled in perverse pleasure.

"Deeper," he murmured.
###Chapter 851: Forced Landing

Evelyn Carter was strategizing her next moves upon arriving in Burlington when urgent radio chatter erupted from the helicopter cockpit.

"N77DT, this is NYPD Air Control. You've entered restricted airspace. Immediately alter course and return to New York airspace!"

The pilot's grip on the controls stiffened.

His eyes flicked to the registration number on the dashboard—N77DT, this helicopter's call sign.

This was an official NYPD warning.

As a pilot for the clandestine organization, he'd been in radio silence before this mission. Their rules prohibited any external contact during standby, let alone unauthorized departures.

He had no idea New York's skies had become a hunting ground.

"NYPD, this is N77DT. We have clearance for Burlington," the pilot replied, forcing calm. "Why are we being diverted?"

"DHS emergency directive," came the terse response. "Land at these coordinates immediately, or we will enforce compliance."

Evelyn instantly detected the anomaly.

"Explain," she demanded coldly.

Beads of sweat formed on the pilot's brow. "Police are ordering us down for inspection—national security grounds."

"And if we refuse?"

"They'll scramble police choppers. Possibly even National Guard Black Hawks." His voice tightened. "Last time I saw this level of response was 9/11..."

Alexander Hamilton suddenly raised his phone. "Just got word—the Rothschilds leveraged government connections to lockdown all major transit routes in New York."

"What?!" Evelyn's eyes flashed with lethal frost.

She never imagined a mere business dynasty could impede her.

The radio crackled again: "N77DT, final warning! Turn heading 280, descend to 2,200 feet, speed below 80 knots. Repeat—final warning!"

The pilot glanced back nervously. "Ma'am, we must comply. NYPD choppers could launch any second, and Guard fighters are on standby nearby."

Evelyn's knuckles whitened.

Never had she endured such humiliation.

Yet reason dictated that defiance now would only delay greater priorities.

"Do it," she hissed through clenched teeth. "This debt will be repaid."

As the helicopter banked toward the designated landing zone, Evelyn watched Manhattan's skyline recede through the window—her gaze murderously cold.
###Chapter 852: The Thickest Skin in the World

The hot pot restaurant buzzed with warmth. Evelyn Carter studied the menu with practiced ease. Alexander Hamilton watched her deft selections, his lips curving as he added her favorite dishes to their order. When they finished, they realized they'd both chosen items the other loved.

Vivian Dempsey, starving, already had her chopsticks poised over the freshly arrived beef rolls.

Through the rising steam, Bianca Langley broke the silence. "I owe you all an apology for leaving so abruptly last time." She sipped her tea. "Remember those people who kept trying to contact me?"

"Of course." Evelyn set down her chopsticks. Their shameless persistence had rivaled even Vincent Croix's.

Bianca dabbed her lips with a napkin, removing her lipstick. "When they couldn't persuade me to reconcile, they started pushing me to sue Vincent." Without the lipstick, her striking features looked even paler.

"They wanted to use you as their weapon?" Vivian nearly choked on her tripe. "That's despicable!"

Evelyn considered this. "So you disappeared to avoid them?"

"Partly." Bianca swirled a paper-thin beef slice in the spicy broth, her eyes watering from the heat. "My parents still hold shares meant for Baby Chloe..." She hesitated. "I gave up my portion to cut all ties with Vincent."

Vivian slammed the table. "Why should you? He was the one who cheated!"

"That girl is dead now." Bianca's voice remained steady as she wiped her teary eyes. "No point dredging up the past. I laid low until they lost interest."

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged a glance. They suddenly remembered Bianca hadn't bid on anything at that charity gala.

"What gala?" Vivian blinked curiously.

Evelyn started to explain, then caught herself, glancing at Bianca. Alexander discreetly tugged her sleeve under the table.

Bianca, pouring more tea, missed the gesture.

Vivian pressed on. "What happened after? Those online trolls made my blood boil!"

Evelyn shot her a warning look. Belatedly, Vivian clapped a hand over her mouth.

"It's fine," Bianca smiled. "I reported plenty of those rumor-spreading accounts. Seeing them get banned was... therapeutic."

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Teach me! My reports always get rejected."

"Bait them into swearing first, then report." Bianca winked. "We call it entrapment."

Vivian immediately pulled out her phone to try. "It works!" she crowed, slapping her thigh in delight.

The meal flowed with laughter, but Evelyn and Alexander never found the right moment to ask about Adrian Valentine's old house. One question lingered—what precious auction item had drawn Bianca to that gala?
###Chapter 853: Deeper Than a Ghost's Grudge

The steam from the hot pot still lingered in the air as the trio stepped out of the restaurant, only to be blocked by an unwelcome figure.

Vincent Croix had somehow slipped out of the hospital. He stood under the streetlight in a crisp suit, the bandage covering half his face doing nothing to hide the venom in his eyes.

"Ugh," Vivian Dempsey muttered under her breath, tugging Bianca Langley's arm to steer her away.

Vincent's gaze slithered after them like a serpent. Despite his polished appearance—even his shoes gleamed—an innate coldness radiated from him.

Bianca swiftly slid on her sunglasses and turned her face away.

Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton moved in unison, forming a protective wall between them. Alexander's tall frame cast a long shadow under the streetlight, completely shielding Bianca.

"I need to talk to you," Vincent said, his voice dripping with ice.

The air froze for several seconds.

"She's not interested," Evelyn replied coolly.

Vincent's eyes locked onto Bianca's shadow. "Even if you're sentencing me to death, I deserve to know why. Unless..." His voice dropped to a whisper. "You actually have no proof?"

The words struck like a knife, hitting its mark with precision.

Bianca's nails dug into her palms. Behind the sunglasses, her eyes were bloodshot, but her voice remained eerily calm. "Proof? You're not worth it."

Vincent smirked. He knew her too well—this reaction was exactly what he wanted.

"That hot pot place," he drawled, "was where we had our first date."

"You're mistaken," Bianca scoffed. "I come here every week."

A dead leaf spiraled between them.

Suddenly, Vincent reached for her sunglasses. "Then why won't you look at me?"

Smack!

Vivian slapped his hand away. "Touch her again, and I'm calling the cops!"

Vincent's expression darkened. The humiliation of being hauled away by the police in the capital was still fresh, and that prickling discomfort returned.

"I just wanted a meal," he said, softening his tone. "Consider it repayment for getting hurt because of you."

Vivian trembled with rage. "You shameless bastard! Who was that car really aiming for?" She yanked her collar aside, revealing a scar on her collarbone. "I haven't even settled this score with you yet!"

Bianca stiffened. She hadn't known Vivian had been targeted too.

Vincent narrowed his eyes. He hadn't expected these two women to be so close—his plan was unraveling.

"So what if I did it?" He dropped all pretense. "You shouldn't have meddled."

The chilling honesty sent a shiver down their spines.

Alexander's brow furrowed. If Vincent would admit to this so brazenly, could he really be responsible for Adrian Valentine's death...?
###Chapter 854: You Deserved It

The thought barely surfaced before I dismissed it.

For a scheming snake like Vincent Croix, such PR tactics were child's play.

Vivian Dempsey trembled with rage. "I swear I'll end you today—"

I yanked her back. "Don't! He had a minor concussion last time. What if he fakes injury to extort you?"

"So we just let him off?"

"Could you even take him in a fight?"

"I—"

Bianca Langley stepped from behind me and delivered a stinging slap.

Crack!

The sharp sound echoed down the hallway.

Vivian froze mid-struggle. Bianca's strike had been swift and brutal, snapping Vincent's head sideways.

Alexander Hamilton subtly shielded me.

Red marks bloomed on Vincent's cheeks as he lifted his gaze, eyes dark. "You—"

Crack!

Another slap.

Now perfectly symmetrical.

Vincent licked his split lip, staring at Bianca's bare ring finger. "Still no wedding band."

"Wearing one would've ruined your face."

He smirked. "Then you'd better cripple me. I'll call the police—make you responsible for life."

"I can afford the medical bills. Vincent, I'd pay to never see you again."

"Unacceptable," he drawled. "You'll be my caretaker."

"I'll hire a nurse."

Vincent finally fell silent, nodding slowly.

Bianca's chest heaved. "Those slaps weren't free. First, you earned them. Second, come at me next time. Betrayal's nothing new for you!"

She turned to leave.

Vincent grabbed her sleeve. "I admit harassing Miss Dempsey was wrong. But I only own what I've done."

Fresh blood seeped through his bandages.

Bianca had worn long sleeves specifically to hide last night's abrasions. She wrenched free. "Let go!"

"Why not cut the fabric again, like last night?" His bitter laugh cracked. "Since I 'deserve' it."

"You were faking unconsciousness."

"The nurse told me after I woke." Vincent's gaze dimmed. "You left your number but never visited..."

Bianca scoffed. "Done acting? My turn."

He waited, eyes guarded.

"At last night's auction," she enunciated, "those rings weren't your original donation, were they?"

Alexander immediately texted someone.

I understood instantly.

Vincent spoke first. "I switched items last-minute. But I swear I didn't know you'd be there!"

"Men's vows are cheaper than weeds," Vivian sneered.

Bianca added, "Storm season's coming. Watch for lightning."

Vincent stared desperately. "How do I prove it?"

"Tell the truth."

"I am." He reached for her sunglasses. "These aren't safe at night."

That familiar concern froze Bianca's blood.

Years ago, his hot-and-cold games had ensnared her.

Now, her heart was completely dead, she pivoted away.

"Where are you going?" Vincent demanded.

"To have fun."
###Chapter 855: The Art of Ditching Someone

Neon lights flickered along the commercial street as KTV signs and bar illuminations competed for attention. Bianca Langley stood at the intersection, her gaze sweeping across the dazzling array of entertainment venues.

Vivian Dempsey's eyes sparkled with mischief as she linked arms with Bianca. "Miss Langley, there's an arcade around the corner. How about we try the dance machines? Guaranteed to make you forget all your troubles." She deliberately glanced at Vincent Croix trailing behind them. "As for certain unwelcome company, let him stew in his own juice."

Vincent's expression darkened, yet he stubbornly maintained his pursuit.

Alexander Hamilton bent his head toward Evelyn Carter. "Tired from your shift? Want to head back early?"

Evelyn massaged her aching shoulders. "It's rare to have time off. Might as well enjoy ourselves." Her eyes traveled over Alexander's tailored suit. "Though aren't you a bit overdressed for an arcade?"

Alexander chuckled. "Worried I can't handle youth culture?"

The group naturally split into three distinct pairs. Vivian expertly exchanged cash for tokens, dragging Bianca straight to the basketball hoops.

"Best stress reliever ever!" Vivian thrust a ball into Bianca's hands. "Imagine those annoying people are the backboard—slam dunk your frustrations!"

Vincent lingered nearby, silently clutching a fistful of tokens.

Evelyn noticed Vincent's persistence and whispered to Alexander, "Planning to wear her down through sheer stubbornness?"

Alexander's gaze turned frosty. "Pity he's using the wrong approach." The memory of his own clumsy courtship attempts tugged at his lips.

Evelyn became captivated by a claw machine filled with plush feline toys. She inserted coins, wholly focused on maneuvering the joystick. Each time the claw descended, the toy barely missed the chute.

"Try another machine?" Alexander suggested, already calculating the cost of buying the entire display.

"This one looks just like Peanut." Evelyn dropped two more coins. "He's been sleeping with my slippers lately."

Alexander immediately rolled up his sleeves. "My turn."

After a dozen alternating attempts, their token supply dwindled. Vincent's voice suddenly cut in: "Aim for the one lying on its back. Higher success rate."

From the racing game area, collision sounds erupted as Vivian and Bianca cheered. The commotion seemed overly stimulating for Bianca's recent hospital recovery.

Evelyn pretended not to hear Vincent, keeping her attention fixed on the machine.

Alexander turned with an arched brow. "Mr. Croix, an expert at prize grabs?"

Vincent remained impassive. "Worked here during university."

Just then, Alexander's phone vibrated. Reading the message, he asked pointedly, "Mr. Croix must have held many part-time jobs in his student days?"

"Did anything that paid." Vincent's tone stayed neutral, but his eyes betrayed unease.
###Chapter 856: Fatal Weakness

Vincent Croix unexpectedly brought up those financially strained years.

Evelyn Carter's fingers paused slightly as she pretended to focus on counting the arcade tokens in her palm. The metallic glint reflected in her eyes while she strained to catch every word of their conversation.

Was he really playing the sympathy card? Too bad Alexander Hamilton was immune to such tactics.

"Did those part-time jobs include planting false leads at the auction?" Alexander cut straight to the chase.

Vincent feigned confusion.

"You never changed the donated item." Alexander tapped the claw machine's glass surface. "That message was bait specifically for Bianca Langley, wasn't it?"

The arcade's chaotic background noise perfectly masked their discussion. Yet Vincent still lowered his voice. "Mr. Hamilton, unsubstantiated accusations should be voiced carefully."

He suddenly confessed, "I did hesitate. Wasn't sure if she'd show."

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "What I really want to know is—what leverage made her appear?"

"Don't know what you're talking about." Vincent rubbed the edge of his bandage, the flashing lights carving his profile into fractured planes of light and shadow.

The claw machine suddenly erupted in cheerful music. Evelyn watched the plush toy tumble out, exchanging a glance with Alexander—against all odds, following their enemy's advice had actually worked.

Vincent seized the moment to twist the knife. "I'd recommend switching machines. This one's odds are rigged."

Alexander's jaw tightened. Evelyn accepted the stuffed animal with a curt thanks.

"Dr. Carter," Vincent abruptly shifted topics, "you've known Mr. Hamilton longer than Bianca, haven't you?"

The air turned glacial.

"Do you really understand him?" Vincent's voice slithered like a venomous serpent.

Alexander clenched his fists but strangely didn't interrupt. He was waiting for an answer.

"You expect me to trust you over him?" Evelyn countered without hesitation.

The sharp click of heels echoed from the shadows.

"If you have to wonder whether to say something," Bianca removed her sunglasses, "then swallow it."

Vincent's gaze clung to her. "Finally climbed out of your racing simulator?"

"Care to join me?" Bianca's red lips curved. "Heard you still get carsick?"

Evelyn suddenly remembered something, murmuring to Alexander, "Adrian Valentine back then—"

Before she could finish, Vivian Dempsey came bounding over. "Miss Langley! You drive well enough to go pro!"

"Just a game," Vincent coldly interrupted, his glare fixed on the racing simulator.

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Still better company than certain buzzkills."

The imprint of her slap still lingered on Vincent's face. He silently retreated half a step like a predator biding its time.

Bianca pulled Vivian toward the dance machines. Vincent immediately followed, sticking close despite the deafening music. He ignored Vivian's repeated jabs.

The strobe lights swept across his tense profile. No one noticed his trembling hands—just like when he'd sat passenger-side watching Bianca speed down highways years ago.
###Chapter 857: How Could She Have Ever Loved Him?

The arcade buzzed with noise, filled with the laughter of young people.

Bianca Langley noticed people raising their phones and quickly tugged Vivian Dempsey's sleeve. "Ignore him. Let's try the dance machine."

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Does clubbing count as dancing?"

"Of course." Bianca pulled her toward the queue.

Two trendy guys who had just finished a game stood nearby. The curly-haired one stared blatantly at Bianca while the other whistled at Vivian.

Vivian rolled her eyes.

Bianca, however, remained composed. Taking the curly-haired guy's suggestion, she selected beginner mode. She picked it up instantly, and Vivian, a seasoned player, quickly switched them to a high-difficulty track.

A crowd gathered to watch.

Vincent Croix stood in the corner, his face dark with anger.

Alexander Hamilton arrived pushing a cart loaded with plush toys just in time to see the scene. He and Evelyn Carter stayed on the periphery, but their height gave them a clear view.

Bianca executed the complex moves effortlessly, her score skyrocketing to an S-rank.

"I'm done," Vivian panted, waving her hands. "I need a break."

The curly-haired guy immediately approached. "Can I dance with you?"

"Sure." Bianca smiled brightly.

Vincent's knuckles turned white from clenching his fists.

Vivian bounded over to Evelyn and gasped at the cart. "Did you empty the whole claw machine?"

"Alexander did all of it," Evelyn said with a laugh.

Vivian opened her mouth to praise him, then pursed her lips. "Planning to open a toy store?"

Alexander shrugged. "Evelyn suggested we share them."

Vivian cheered and began picking through the haul, but Evelyn noticed Vincent's icy glare. Even through the crowd, the hostility was palpable.

"Miss Langley is provoking him on purpose," Evelyn murmured.

Sure enough, as the game ended and the curly-haired guy pulled out his phone to ask for Bianca's number, Vincent shoved him aside. "Move."

"Sorry, I didn't know she had a boyfriend—"

"He's not," Bianca said coldly.

Vincent smirked. "True. Ex-husband. We also have a child."

The guy fled in terror.

Bianca looked at Vincent with disdain. "Finally admitting it now?"

"Never denied it." His voice was low.

She turned away with a scoff. She had a plan, but this wasn't the time to reveal it.

As they left, Vincent blocked Alexander. "I'll take Bianca home."

Bianca put on sunglasses, hiding the disgust in her eyes. How could she have ever loved such an arrogant man?

Alexander feigned ignorance. "Concussion patients can just check themselves out now? Did the doctor approve that?"

Evelyn Carter responded with perfect timing: "Mr. Croix, shall I contact your physician for a neurological evaluation?"

Vincent Croix had endured humiliation all evening, his fury simmering beneath a veneer of forced composure.

Bianca Langley's laughter sparkled like champagne. "What a delightful night. You should head home—work awaits tomorrow."

Evelyn shot Vincent a wary glance. "Baby Chloe misses you. Come with us."

Vivian Dempsey instantly understood. "I'll stay with Miss Langley. My schedule's clear tomorrow anyway."

Vincent's face darkened.

With Vivian present, his chances of reconciling with Bianca would evaporate completely.

Bianca ignored him entirely, smiling at Vivian. "There's a lovely lounge bar ahead. Let's grab drinks."

"Absolutely not!" Vincent finally exploded.

Vivian's smirk was razor-sharp. "And who are you to object? Single women can't enjoy themselves? Your presence alone would clear out the entire establishment."

When it came to verbal sparring, Vivian never lost. She'd even berated Alexander Hamilton during his indecisive phase.

Vincent's temple pulsed with rage as he turned to Bianca. "Those bar rats only want one thing!"

He remained oblivious to Bianca's past ownership of a lounge bar.

Alexander listened silently, hearing echoes of his younger self.

Evelyn suddenly gagged, fighting back nausea.

Bianca's question floated like a dagger wrapped in silk: "And what about you? What's your true motive?"

Vincent choked on his words again.

"Bar patrons might covet my body," Bianca enunciated each syllable like a death sentence, "but you? You wanted my fortune. Used me as your stepping stone. Even framed me for murder!"

Vincent's breathing turned ragged. "Say whatever you want. I'm not leaving you tonight."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Ugh, like a leech that won't detach."

Alexander murmured to Evelyn, "Shall I call your driver? The baby needs to sleep."

Clutching her plush toy, Evelyn suppressed dizziness. "No need. I'll take a cab. Keep an eye on them."

She couldn't shake the fear that Bianca and Vincent's confrontation might escalate dangerously.

Alexander sighed. "At least consider your own condition."

Watching Vivian and Bianca's fiery determination, Evelyn whispered, "Vivian's like a sister to me, and Miss Langley... I owe her."

Every time she cradled Baby Chloe as her own, guilt gnawed at her.

Alexander understood her unspoken remorse. He summoned a private car, insisting she text upon arriving home.

Meanwhile, Vincent kept retreating under Vivian and Bianca's combined assault. They still managed to wave Evelyn goodbye between verbal strikes.

The night breeze cooled Evelyn's face, yet her vertigo worsened.

Margaret Hamilton gasped at her pallid arrival. "What happened? Why didn't Alexander escort you?"

Baby Chloe toddled into Evelyn's arms.

"It's nothing," Evelyn hugged the child. "I told him to stay. Miss Langley's ex came causing trouble again."

Memories surfaced of Bianca's darkest days spent recuperating at the Hamilton residence.

Margaret Hamilton's fingers trembled slightly. The ripples in her teacup mirrored the pain in her eyes. Vincent Croix's obsession was like a blunt knife, repeatedly cutting into her heart.

"What a tragedy..." she murmured. "If he truly cherished their past, he should let Bianca and the child go. Now both mother and child are suffering. The baby is over a year old and still doesn't have a proper name."

As if sensing the tension, Baby Chloe toddled over and clutched Margaret's sleeve with her tiny hand.

"No cry..."

Margaret's heart warmed as she gathered the child into her arms. "She's so clever. Yesterday she saw a butterfly in the garden and knew to pull my hand to chase it."

"Very bright indeed," Evelyn Carter agreed, stroking the baby's soft hair. "Shall we hire an early education teacher?"

Margaret started to nod, then hesitated. "But she doesn't even have a legal name... What about school later?"

Evelyn's chest tightened. This child's life had barely begun, yet she already bore the weight of her parents' feud.

Late that night, Evelyn cradled the sleeping baby, gazing absently at the moonlight through the window.

Alexander Hamilton entered quietly and found her sitting motionless by the bed.

"Still awake?"

Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips. "Just got her to sleep."

Alexander slipped into bed on the opposite side, their hushed conversation spanning the sleeping child between them.

"How are you feeling?"

"Mrs. Hamilton asked me the same thing." Evelyn smiled wryly. "I'm fine."

Alexander exhaled in relief. "Bianca Langley and Vivian Dempsey are settled now."

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "Is she... alright?"

"She made a decision." Alexander's voice dropped. "She wants to formally grant us custody of the baby."

Evelyn's head snapped up, nails digging into her palms. "She's serious?"

"She said..." Alexander swallowed hard. "Rather than watch the child grow up with Vincent's face and torment each other, it's better to let go now."

Only the baby's steady breathing filled the room.

Evelyn gently wiped drool from the child's mouth. "What about the name..."

"She said we should choose." Alexander's voice roughened. "We'll process the paperwork tomorrow."

Moonlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows across the baby's face. Evelyn suddenly realized this tiny life was about to become her greatest responsibility.
###Chapter 858: The Insatiable Human Heart

Alexander Hamilton shook his head. "She said she shouldn't interfere with the child's life."

Bianca Langley had always been decisive. Her past devotion to the child was genuine, just like her current resolute withdrawal.

Evelyn Carter's fingers trembled slightly. She understood this heart-wrenching pain all too well.

Adult conflicts should never burden children. Yet fate loved its cruel irony.

Noticing her somber expression, Alexander gently changed the subject. "The baby's a girl. We should choose her name carefully to avoid teasing at school."

Evelyn pondered for a moment. "How about Easy? With your surname. This child has suffered enough. I just want her to have a peaceful life."

"You'd let her take the Hamilton name?" His eyes brightened instantly.

"Better than Croix," Evelyn said coldly. "Though Langley would be more fitting. But explaining that would be too cruel."

"I'll ask Miss Langley again tomorrow," she added.

Alexander feared she might reconsider. "Easy is perfect. Though... I thought you'd pick Anderson."

After all, legally they were still divorced.

Evelyn chuckled. "Your circumstances are far better. There's a top-tier kindergarten nearby. Registering under you gives her more advantages."

The light in his eyes dimmed. "So that's why..."

"Hmm?"

"Nothing." He stood abruptly. "I'll be in the study."

Since that night of crossed boundaries, they'd maintained a careful distance at the ancestral home. Even Aunt Margaret, though anxious, dared not pry.

Seeing the dark circles under his eyes, Evelyn's heart softened. "Just sleep here."

Alexander immediately feigned a yawn.

The human heart was never satisfied. Knowing when to stop yet craving more—such was its nature.

At dawn, Evelyn called Bianca.

"Lunch together?" Bianca's voice carried morning drowsiness. "Vivian and I were just heading out."

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel tightened.

"Sure." The moment Evelyn agreed, the car jerked to a sudden stop.

Shielding her, Alexander heard Bianca's concerned inquiry through the phone.

"Traffic jam." Evelyn eyed the gridlocked road. "Might have to run to the hospital."

A shout came from ahead. "A woman's in labor!"

Evelyn bolted from the car. Three kilometers later, she was sprinting in heels.

Chaos engulfed the accident scene. Beside an overturned bus, a pregnant woman lay on a blood-soaked coat.

"OB-GYN here." Evelyn pushed through the crowd. "How long since her water broke?"

The mother wept. "She's two weeks early!"

After examination, Evelyn's face paled. "Full dilation. Delivery must happen now!"

Men quickly turned away. Alexander came sprinting back, holding two black umbrellas high—creating a private space under the public gaze.
###Chapter 859: Fainting Spell

The morning sun hid behind dark clouds, filling the air with dampness. Evelyn Carter stood by the roadside curb, shielding the pregnant woman under her umbrella. The chaotic accident scene around them didn't faze her.

"Take deep breaths. Stay calm." She held the woman's trembling hand. "I've delivered many emergency births. You and your baby will be fine."

The woman's face was ghostly pale, her nails digging into Evelyn's palm. "Doctor... I'm scared..."

Sirens wailed in the distance. Alexander Hamilton's tall figure parted the crowd, clearing a path for the paramedics.

"Dr. Carter!" The emergency physician jumped out of the ambulance, visibly relieved to see Evelyn.

She rattled off the patient's condition while efficiently sterilizing instruments. Amniotic fluid mixed with blood soaked her pants, yet she didn't even blink.

A loud newborn cry pierced the air as the baby emerged from under the umbrella. Just as Evelyn searched for something to wrap the infant, a still-warm suit jacket appeared before her.

"Use this." Alexander's voice came from above.

The exhausted mother opened her eyes weakly. "My baby..."

"A beautiful baby girl." Evelyn gently placed the newborn on the woman's chest before helping transfer her to the stretcher.

Only when the ambulance doors closed did Evelyn remember Alexander standing alone in the rain. Through the window, she saw him on the roadside, his shirt billowing in the wind.

Hospital corridors blurred past as Evelyn carried the newborn. After confirming both mother and child were stable, she finally leaned against a wall, exhaling deeply. Bloodstains covered her white coat, unnoticed.

"Dr. Carter!" A nurse rushed over. "Bed 3 is hemorrhaging!"

Evelyn straightened immediately, sprinting toward the delivery room. The crisis consumed hours. When she finally returned to her office, the sun hung high.

The door's creak alerted the figure by the window. Alexander turned, sunlight fracturing across his sharp profile. His sleeves were rolled up, a spray bottle in hand.

"Finished?" He set it down and approached.

Evelyn nodded—then the world tilted violently. She gripped the desk edge as everything distorted.

"Evelyn!"

Darkness swallowed her, but not before strong arms caught her fall.

The antiseptic smell told her she was in the hospital lounge when consciousness returned. Alexander kept vigil beside the bed, his usually immaculate shirt wrinkled, eyes bloodshot.

"How long was I out?" Her voice rasped.

He clasped her hand. "Don't worry. Olivia already covered your shift." The bruise on his knuckles stood out starkly.

Evelyn bolted upright. "My morning clinic—"

"The department head took over." Gently, he pressed her back down. "You need rest."

Only then did she notice his injury. "What happened?"

Alexander withdrew his hand casually. "Bumped it when catching you."

Evelyn stared at the bruise, warmth flooding her chest. Outside, sunlight finally broke through the clouds, painting golden patterns across the hospital floor.
###Chapter 860: Pregnancy

Alexander Hamilton's hand bore a dark bruise that stood out starkly against his tanned skin.

"Knocked it against the table corner," he said casually, withdrawing his hand to pour a glass of water.

Evelyn Carter studied the injury. Last night, when she fainted, she'd heard a dull thud. Now she realized—he must have slammed into the solid oak table rushing to catch her.

"The doctor said it's low blood sugar." He handed her the water, his fingertips lingering briefly against her palm. "Skip clinic this afternoon."

"I always keep candy in my bag." She took a sip, then froze. She'd eaten breakfast this morning. The sugar cubes were still tucked in her purse.

Alexander's expression darkened. "I'll be right back."

The moment the door clicked shut, Olivia Lightfoot slipped inside like a shadow.

"Dr. Carter!" She locked the door and pulled a lab report from her white coat. "You need to see this first."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she took the paper.

The HCG level glared back at her in bold three digits.

"I retrieved it directly from the lab." Olivia's voice shook. "Only the night nurse and I know."

The curtains billowed, casting swaying light patterns across the room. Evelyn stared at the number, a dull roar filling her ears.

"Should we tell Mr. Hamilton?" Olivia whispered.

Evelyn crumpled the report. The searing pain of her last miscarriage surged through her, and her hand flew protectively to her abdomen.

"Not a word." Her voice cracked. "I need your help..."

Footsteps echoed in the hallway. Olivia hastily forwarded a falsified digital report to her own phone.

Alexander intercepted her as she tried to slip out.

"Results?"

"Just low blood sugar!" Olivia brandished her phone.

The data looked suspiciously perfect, but Alexander's attention had already shifted to Evelyn feigning sleep on the bed. Her lashes fluttered, casting delicate shadows beneath her eyes.

He discreetly snapped a photo and set it as his chat background.

When Evelyn awoke, she found him watching her. The intensity in his gaze forced her to look away.

"Eleven-thirty." His fingers brushed her hair. "Vivian booked us lunch."

At the fusion restaurant, Bianca Langley was dropping strawberries into champagne flutes.

"You look terrible." Vivian reached to feel Evelyn's forehead. "Could it be—"

Evelyn choked on her lemon water.

Alexander immediately passed her a napkin, his gaze flickering to her flat stomach for the briefest second.
###Chapter 861: I Thought I Played the Part Well

Vivian Dempsey swiftly grabbed her coat. "You look pale. Put this on."

They'd been inseparable since college, even sharing closets.

Evelyn Carter shook her head gently. "No need. The sun's out, and you're all dressed so beautifully. I'd ruin the mood bundled up like a dumpling."

A faint smile touched her lips, but they were nearly translucent with pallor.

Alexander Hamilton rose discreetly and requested a cashmere throw from the server. As he leaned in to drape it over her shoulders, his whisper brushed her ear. "Your cycle's due soon. Don't catch a chill."

Her fingers twitched.

He remembered. But this time—there would be no cycle. Not ever again. The thought constricted her chest, dragging her back to that sterile examination room.

"Evelyn?" Vivian waved a hand before her glazed eyes. "Earth to Dr. Carter?"

Bianca Langley smoothly redirected. "Shall we order?"

When the menu reached Evelyn, her usual steamed sea bass held no appeal. Her tongue craved something sharper.

"Rosé crab pasta. Extra chili flakes." She hesitated. "And hot hibiscus tea."

Three pairs of eyes snapped toward her.

Alexander's brow furrowed. He recalled how she'd coughed violently from tom yum soup last Thai dinner—she despised spicy-sour flavors.

"Since when?" Vivian eyed Alexander suspiciously. "Did someone pressure you into this?"

Evelyn chuckled. "Don't be absurd. Just a craving."

She casually added a salad, but her nails dug crescent moons into the menu's leather cover.

The meal passed in distracted silence.

When Bianca set down her napkin and mentioned "adoption paperwork," Vivian's fork clattered against her plate.

"You're giving up the baby—" She bit her tongue.

Bianca traced the rim of her wineglass. "I should've done this sooner. If I'd left completely back then, Chloe wouldn't have suffered through..."

The air turned viscous.

Evelyn clenched the throw over her lap. That morning's double-lined pregnancy test burned in her memory. As Bianca spoke, her lower abdomen tightened.

"Miss Langley," her voice scraped raw, "she'll always be your flesh and blood. I don't want you living with regrets."

Alexander's head jerked up. They'd agreed to co-parent.

Vivian glanced between them and wisely stayed mute.

Bianca suddenly laughed, her eyes glistening. "You saw right through me, Dr. Carter. And here I thought my acting was convincing."

Last night in the guest room, she'd stared at the ceiling until dawn. At first light, the mirror had reflected a woman with bloodshot eyes—a cornered animal.
###Chapter 862: Her Name Is Easy

Vivian Dempsey's eyes widened as she stared at Bianca Langley in disbelief.

"Miss Langley, if you're hurting, just let it out. I know it's late to say this, but you can't avoid seeing your child just because of one failed relationship. That bastard Vincent Croix will get what's coming to him!"

Her blunt words bordered on reckless, yet they struck directly at the unspoken concerns Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton had been tiptoeing around.

Bianca's hands trembled slightly.

She had indeed been avoiding the baby.

Perhaps even she hadn't realized that beyond fearing the child would grow to resemble Vincent more each day, the deeper reason was her inability to face the guilt festering in her heart.

"I'm devastated," Bianca whispered, her voice feather-light. "But I've made my decision. About the baby... I don't regret it."

Evelyn watched Bianca's pallid face, her chest tightening.

"I respect your choice," she said softly. "But if you ever change your mind—"

Bianca's eyes reddened. "Thank you."

Evelyn hesitated. "I've picked a name for the baby—Easy. What do you think?"

"Easy..." Bianca repeated the word, her lips finally curving into a genuine, if fragile, smile. "It's perfect. May her life be smooth sailing."

Alexander had remained silent throughout.

Only now did he speak. "If it's convenient, we can complete the paperwork this afternoon."

Bianca nodded, the simple motion seeming to drain her completely.

The civil affairs office buzzed with activity.

Vivian pulled Evelyn aside, whispering urgently, "Do you think Miss Langley will really recover from this?"

Evelyn watched the two figures filling out forms, her gaze shadowed. "I don't know."

"You're acting strange today." Vivian's sharp eyes missed nothing. "Did something happen?"

Evelyn drew a shaky breath. "I might be pregnant."

"What?!" Vivian nearly jumped. "You two... you actually..."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn. "I thought it was a safe day."

Vivian grabbed her hand. "Was it consensual?"

At Evelyn's nod, Vivian exhaled in relief. "Thank God. The man's a jerk, but at least he's easy on the eyes. It's just... the timing. Do you want to keep it?"

Evelyn's fingers turned ice-cold.

Dark memories surfaced.

"I don't know," she murmured. "After last time, I thought I couldn't conceive again."

Vivian squeezed her hand tighter. "Alexander's different with you now. If he finds out, he'll lose his mind with joy."

Evelyn pictured the scene, her fleeting smile vanishing as quickly as it appeared.

"Have I become pathetic?" she asked with self-mockery.
###Chapter 863: Through Storms and Seas

The hormonal fluctuations of pregnancy made Evelyn Carter unusually sensitive. She'd witnessed countless expectant mothers breaking down in her clinic, never imagining she'd one day be caught in the same emotional whirlpool.

Vivian Dempsey handed her a glass of water. "You've been wound too tight lately."

"That last child..." Vivian hesitated. "I know you never let it go. Now that things are finally looking up, you're even more terrified, aren't you?"

Evelyn's fingers turned pale around the glass. She'd always been the epitome of rationality and restraint—even during her divorce from Alexander Hamilton, she'd maintained perfect composure.

This was exactly what worried Vivian most. "Cry if you need to. Scream if you want. I'll always be in your corner." She squeezed Evelyn's cold hand. "Whatever you decide, I've got your back."

When Alexander returned from completing paperwork, he immediately sensed the charged atmosphere. "Do I have something on my face?"

"No." Evelyn quickly schooled her expression, discreetly pinching Vivian's arm.

Vivian snorted. "Some people are getting cocky now that they've got a daughter. Let me warn you—if you ever make Evelyn suffer—"

"Vivian!" Evelyn cut her off.

Confusion flickered in Alexander's eyes, but he wisely didn't press. Turning to Evelyn, he said, "All the paperwork's done. Though..."

He hesitated. "Adoption regulations require a forty-year age gap for single men adopting girls. So I temporarily used Mother's name."

Evelyn nodded. "That's probably for the best."

"And..." Alexander studied her face. "For the mother's name... I put yours."

The air froze.

Evelyn's fingers drifted unconsciously to her abdomen—a movement Alexander didn't miss.

"If you're uncomfortable, I can—"

"Don't." Evelyn's voice was soft. "Leave it as is."

Bianca Langley suddenly stood. "I should go." She forced a smile. "Now that this is settled, I should celebrate."

But everyone could see her unsteady steps, her frail silhouette like tissue paper.

Evelyn didn't stop her. Some wounds needed to be endured alone.

Vivian also rose. "I need to catch up on sleep." She shot Alexander a warning glare before leaving. "Remember what I said."

Only when they were alone did Alexander ask quietly, "Did something happen?"

"Perhaps Miss Langley's situation has affected everyone's mood." Evelyn changed the subject. "Is the baby's paperwork all complete?"

Alexander recognized her evasion but respected it. "Everything's done. Though..." He paused. "When we take her out, people might assume we're a family of three."

Evelyn gazed at the sunlight beyond the window. A family of three... Soon to be four.

"Would you like to take a walk?" Alexander offered.

She shook her head. "I should return to the hospital. I can't keep taking time off so soon after coming back."

She needed work to distract her. Those secrets buried deep weren't ready to surface yet.

Alexander studied her profile. Sunlight through the glass scattered gold flecks across her lashes. Suddenly, he felt simply being allowed to stand beside her was fortune enough.

Having weathered countless storms, he'd finally learned patience.
###Chapter 864: Domestic Affairs

Emily Zade had already rescheduled all of Alexander Hamilton's afternoon appointments. He decided to accompany Evelyn Carter back to the hospital.

The moment they stepped into the office, Olivia Lightfoot rushed over in a panic. "Dr. Carter, there's trouble! Someone filed a complaint against you for misconduct!"

Evelyn froze. In all her years at Central Hospital, she had never received a single complaint.

Alexander's brow furrowed slightly, worried the morning's shift change might have caused issues.

Olivia tugged Evelyn toward the hallway. "The department head is waiting for you."

In the corridor, Olivia lowered her voice. "It's a patient's family member. They accused you of having a bad attitude."

"Family member?" Evelyn thought for a moment. "The husband of that emergency delivery patient this morning?"

Olivia nodded. "Exactly. The department head says he's being unreasonable, but protocol must be followed."

The department head's office door was slightly ajar. At the sound of knocking, a voice responded immediately.

"Come in."

The department head set down the file in her hands. "Are you feeling better? I was shocked to hear you fainted."

Evelyn forced a smile. "I'm fine now."

Olivia stood to the side, hesitating to speak.

The department head sighed. "The husband complained that you ignored him. He was worried you wouldn’t take proper care of his wife."

Evelyn scoffed. "How considerate of him—he didn’t even know his wife was in a car accident and went into premature labor."

"I see." The department head's frown deepened. "No wonder he filed a complaint. Guilty conscience."

Olivia couldn’t help interjecting, "Men like that deserve to be divorced!"

"It's never that simple." The department head shook her head. "Even the wisest judge can't settle domestic disputes."

Evelyn said softly, "Divorce during breastfeeding is difficult. It's their private matter. We shouldn’t interfere."

Her hand instinctively rested on her abdomen. Since becoming pregnant, she had grown more cautious.

Olivia opened her mouth, glanced at Evelyn, then closed it again.

Outside the door, Alexander waited quietly. When Evelyn emerged, he stepped forward immediately. "Do you need my help?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It's nothing serious. I have rounds to make. You should head back to the office."

Though he sensed her distance, Alexander still replied gently, "Alright. I'll pick you up tonight."

During her rounds, Evelyn found the new mother silently crying. After speaking with her, she learned the woman was indeed considering divorce.

Back in her office, Evelyn noticed a missed call from Bianca Langley on her phone.

She called back immediately, but no one answered.

"Vivian, have you heard from Miss Langley?"

"Not at all." Vivian Dempsey's voice was drowsy. "What's wrong?"

Evelyn tightened her grip on her phone. "She called me but didn’t answer. Now I can’t reach her."

"Don’t worry. I’ll go look for her."

Half an hour later, Vivian called back. "Found her! She's at Adrian Valentine's cemetery."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Is she okay?"

"She said she’s going to Europe for a trip..." Vivian paused. "Oh, and she mentioned calling to thank you both for adopting the baby."

After hanging up, Evelyn couldn’t shake a strange feeling. Bianca's voice on the phone had been eerily calm—too calm.
###Chapter 865: Seaside Mystery

Evelyn's finger hovered over her phone screen before she finally lowered it.

Bianca's silence weighed on her heart like a stone.

"Maybe she needs time," Evelyn murmured, slipping the phone back into her bag. Outside, cicadas buzzed relentlessly as summer's scorching heat loomed.

Baby Chloe giggled in her crib, tiny hands clutching colorful blocks from the early education teacher. Watching the child's innocent smile, Evelyn felt an invisible thorn prick her heart.

"Still no response from Miss Langley?" Alexander entered the nursery with a fruit platter, his gaze landing on the phone in Evelyn's tight grip.

She shook her head. "Phone's off. Messages unread. And Vincent..."

"Also vanished." Alexander finished her sentence, offering a peeled grape to her lips. "Our European branch confirmed her passport is still in the apartment."

The grape burst tart-sweet in Evelyn's mouth, doing nothing to ease her unease.

"Something feels wrong." She squinted at the blinding sunlight outside. "Vincent isn't the type to give up easily."

Alexander's eyes darkened. His traps were already set, waiting to spring. But right now, Evelyn's distress concerned him more.

"I'll have it investigated." He clasped her chilled hand. "Rest first."

The hospital corridor reeked of antiseptic as usual. Evelyn's white coat bore sweat stains from her latest surgery when her phone buzzed—Alexander calling.

"News?" She hurried toward the lounge, voice hushed.

A beat of silence. Then: "I'm at the hospital entrance. We need to go somewhere."

The black sedan left the city behind, landscapes growing desolate. Evelyn gripped her seatbelt. "What's going on?"

"Vincent's last phone signal came from the coast." Alexander's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "An abandoned fishing zone."

Salty wind slapped their faces upon arrival. Evelyn's canvas shoes sank into damp sand with each unsteady step.

Alexander steadied her. "Easy."

At the cliff's edge, gusts whipped Evelyn's hair wildly. She shielded her eyes, scanning the steel-gray horizon.

"This place is too remote." Her voice trembled. "If—"

"Police are already alerted." He pulled out his phone. "Let's wait in the car."

But Evelyn remained rooted. An inexplicable pull drew her toward the precipice. Waves smashed against jagged rocks below, spraying white foam.

Then her breath caught—

A crimson scarf snagged between wave-breakers, fluttering like fresh blood against the tide.
###Chapter 866: Falling into the Sea

Something floated on the distant sea, flickering in and out of view under the sunlight.

Evelyn squinted and instinctively stepped forward. Her attention was completely captured by the unknown object, unaware that she had already reached the edge of the cliff.

"Stop!"

Alexander grabbed her wrist and yanked her back into his arms. His grip was so tight that Evelyn's back collided hard against his chest. She could feel his heart pounding violently.

"What are you doing?" Evelyn frowned.

"You almost fell!" Alexander's voice was strained, his fingers locked around her wrist. "The ground here is loose. It could collapse any second."

Only then did Evelyn realize she had been standing less than half a meter from the edge. She steadied herself and pulled out her phone. "I just wanted to see what it was."

Zooming in, the screen revealed a shattered phone wedged between the gaps of the wave-dissipating blocks.

The police arrived quickly. When divers retrieved the phone, it was severely damaged, barely holding its shape thanks to a black phone case.

"Recognize this?" An officer held up the evidence bag with gloved hands.

Evelyn shook her head. Alexander stared at the faint scratch on the phone case and said grimly, "It's Vincent's."

The sea wind turned bitingly cold. A wave of nausea hit Evelyn. She covered her mouth, forcing it down.

"We found something!" A shout came from farther away.

Evelyn turned to see officers crouching near the cliff's edge, photographing evidence in the mud. She tried to walk over, but her legs suddenly gave way. Darkness swallowed her vision—

When she woke, night had fallen outside the window.

Alexander sat by the bed, immediately handing her a glass of water when she opened her eyes. "Drink."

Her throat burned with dryness. She took small sips, her gaze drifting to the closed curtains. "Miss Liang... any news?"

Alexander's fingers trembled slightly. He walked to the window and parted the curtains just enough for moonlight to spill in, illuminating his tense profile.

"The police found tire tracks near the cliff," he said quietly. "One of Vincent's cars is missing."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

"The search is still ongoing." Alexander returned to the bed and took her icy hand. "But based on the scene, they likely..."

"Fell into the sea," Evelyn finished for him, tears silently rolling down her cheeks.

Alexander didn't offer comfort. He knew words were meaningless now.

"That day, she called me..." Evelyn's voice broke. "If I had answered..."

"It's not your fault." He squeezed her hand tightly. "Bianca had already made her decision. Staying by Vincent's side for so long took everything she had."

Evelyn remembered Bianca's eerie calm at the civil affairs office. It wasn't acceptance—it was goodbye.

"She did it for the baby..." Evelyn's chest heaved. "She could've—"

"She didn't want to drag anyone down with her," Alexander cut in sharply. His eyes dropped to her flat stomach. "Right now, you need to focus on your health."

Only the ticking of the clock filled the room.

Bianca had severed every tie. Her parents were overseas. Her assets were settled. Even her beloved daughter had been entrusted to someone trustworthy.

She left without a trace—as if she had never existed.
###Chapter 867 The Agony of Waiting is Worse Than Death

Evelyn Carter opened her eyes to find herself in her familiar bedroom.

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting dappled patterns across the bedsheets.

Her hand instinctively moved to rest on her abdomen.

"You're awake." Alexander Hamilton's voice came from beside the bed, tinged with cautious relief.

She turned to meet his conflicted gaze.

"I..." Her lips parted, but words failed her.

Alexander handed her a glass of warm water, his fingers trembling slightly. "The doctor confirmed you're eight weeks pregnant."

The steam from the water curled before her eyes as she accepted the glass.

She should have known.

Olivia Lightfoot's hesitant expression during her last fainting spell. The unexplained exhaustion these past weeks. And... that possibility she'd deliberately ignored.

"I know," she finally whispered, her voice feather-light.

Alexander's breath hitched audibly.

He slowly knelt beside the bed, meeting her at eye level. "Evelyn, I—"

Those usually calculating eyes now brimmed with uncertainty and hope.

She turned her face away.

Memories flooded back—the despair of her last pregnancy, the blinding surgical lights, the endless sleepless nights.

"I haven't decided," she heard herself say.

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"I understand." His voice roughened. "Whatever you choose, I'll respect it."

His hand hovered midair before finally settling on the edge of her blanket.

Evelyn stared at those distinctive knuckles.

These hands had signed countless business deals, yet now lacked the courage to touch her.

"The baby's only the size of a peanut right now," she murmured.

Alexander's lashes fluttered. "I know."

"Medically speaking, it's not even considered a life yet."

"I know."

Suddenly her eyes burned.

The cold surgical instruments. The sting of antiseptic.

"I can't go through that again—" Her voice broke.

Alexander's head snapped up.

Seeing her unshed tears, his heart clenched violently.

"Evelyn..." His outstretched hand froze between them.

She drew a steadying breath. "I'll keep it."

His expression froze.

As if he hadn't heard correctly—or feared he'd misheard.

"You're..."

"I'm saying I'll have this baby." Firmer this time.

Light ignited in Alexander's eyes.

He ached to embrace her but restrained himself, fingers twisting into the sheets instead.

"Thank you." His voice cracked. "Thank you, Evelyn."

Seeing his red-rimmed eyes, something inside her softened.

"But I have conditions."

"Name them." Instant agreement. "Anything."

"First—we maintain our current relationship status."

"Done."

"Second—I won't quit my job during the pregnancy."

"Of course."

"Third..." She hesitated. "You handle explaining to your family."

Without pause: "I'll tell them I have commitment issues. That I refused to marry."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Margaret Hamilton will murder you."

"Doesn't matter." A tear escaped as he smiled. "As long as you and the baby are safe, nothing else does."

She turned away but couldn't hide her quirked lips.

"Idiot," she muttered.

Alexander heard it—and beamed like a child given candy.

Gently, he covered her hand with his. Together, they cradled the promise of new life.

Sunlight bathed them in quiet gold.
###Chapter 868: Maintaining the Status Quo

The operating room lights glared with dizzying intensity.

I stood at the end of the corridor, fingernails digging deep into my palms. The sterile scent of disinfectant clashed with the metallic tang of blood in the air.

Alexander Hamilton leaned against the wall, his suit jacket draped carelessly over his arm. His tie hung loose, shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows, revealing corded forearms. Those usually sharp eyes were now bloodshot.

"He'll be fine," he rasped suddenly, his voice barely recognizable.

I stared at the red light above the operating doors, my throat tight. Three hours. The surgery had lasted three hours.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. A text from Olivia Lightfoot: "The board demands your immediate return."

I snorted and powered it off.

Footsteps approached. Alexander's assistant hurried over, whispering in his ear. I saw his jawline tense abruptly.

"Tell them," he said in a dangerously low voice, "the world can wait."

The assistant hesitated but didn't dare argue, turning on his heel.

Silence reclaimed the hallway. Only the intermittent beeping of monitors penetrated the walls.

I remembered the last time I'd seen the old man, swinging his golf club with vigor. "This old bones has twenty good years left," he'd declared.

The operating doors swung open.

The lead surgeon removed his mask, expression grave. My stomach plummeted.

"Stable for now," the doctor said, making my knees weaken. "But we need 48 hours of observation."

Alexander caught me. The heat of his palm burned through my sleeve.

"Thank you, Doctor," he said evenly, though the veins in his hand stood out.

Through the ICU window, I watched the old man's tube-covered body. Machines surrounded him, emitting rhythmic sounds.

"You should rest," Alexander said from half a step behind me.

I shook my head. "The board—"

"I'll handle it," he cut in. "Grandfather comes first."

Outside, night deepened. The hospital lights stretched our shadows long across the floor, merging them together.

My phone buzzed again. Seventeen missed calls from Olivia.

As I reached to call back, Alexander stopped me. "Maintaining the status quo benefits everyone."

His eyes gleamed startlingly bright in the dimness. Suddenly, I understood his meaning.

News of the old man's critical condition would send Hamilton Group's stocks plummeting. The circling shareholders, the lurking competitors...

"Fine," I heard myself say. "Status quo."

At the hallway's end, elevator doors slid open silently. A group of white coats approached, led unmistakably by the hospital director.

Alexander moved to meet them, his posture straight as a pine. Watching him, I realized this storm was only beginning.

And we had no choice but to keep playing our parts.
###Chapter 869: Center of Attention

Evelyn Carter sat encircled by her family, treated like a priceless treasure on display.

Anthony Taylor burst through the door, triumphantly carrying a bucket of thrashing carp. "Freshly caught this morning!" His crow's feet deepened with joy. "Perfect for nourishing soup."

Teresa Taylor fidgeted beside Evelyn, nervously twisting her hem. "When I was pregnant with you..." Her featherlight voice trailed off. She suddenly slapped her forehead. "Silly me—you're the OB-GYN specialist. What could I possibly teach you?" Tears welled as she turned away.

Anthony squeezed his wife's trembling hand. "Only good days ahead." His voice quivered like he feared waking from a dream.

Watching their cautious affection, Evelyn's throat tightened. "I'll be careful," she murmured.

The front door swung open. Grace Anderson marched in like a hurricane, trailed by servants laden with packages.

"Mom!" Evelyn instinctively rose, only to be gently restrained by Alexander Hamilton's firm hand.

"Don't move!" Grace scolded, tucking a stray lock behind Evelyn's ear with practiced ease. "You're our top priority now."

Teresa's fingers dug into the sofa cushions.

Margaret Hamilton directed servants like a general. "Cherries in the fridge! Walnuts over there—"

"Did you buy out the entire grocery store?" Evelyn laughed weakly. "Emily will be jealous."

Grace beamed. "That clever girl understands!" She produced speckled goose eggs like a magician. "From the countryside—packed with nutrients!"

Watching her mother bustle about, Evelyn suddenly missed her late father. If only he...

A warm palm covered her hand. "We'll visit Dad this weekend," Alexander murmured.

Evelyn nodded.

Grace gathered her purse. "I forgot the sour jujube powder—"

"My driver will take you," Alexander said, already dialing.

After Grace's whirlwind departure, silence settled. Evelyn finally noticed Teresa's hesitant expression.

She inched closer. Blood ties were strange—this woman felt simultaneously intimate yet galaxies away.

"Um..." Evelyn's lips parted, but the word "Mom" lodged in her throat.

Teresa's eyes briefly sparkled before dimming. "Perhaps... your mother could move in with us?" she whispered. "The guest room is ready..."

Anthony nodded eagerly. "Anytime!"

Evelyn clenched her skirt. She couldn't bear hurting them, but forcing Grace would be worse.

Alexander smoothly intervened. "Grace is best positioned to care for Evelyn here. But please consider this your home too."

The tension dissolved like morning mist. Sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, gilding Evelyn's lashes as she exhaled in relief.
###Chapter 870: I Can't Be This Selfish

Anthony Taylor and Teresa Taylor understood loneliness better than anyone. After losing little Evelyn years ago, they thought they'd never find her again. Adopting Annabelle was merely an attempt to fill the void in their hearts, and for over two decades, they indulged her every whim.

All they reaped in return was heartbreak.

Anthony sighed, conceding to Alexander Hamilton's point. "You're right. Moving back and forth between homes would be too much trouble. This decision should be yours—we didn't consider it carefully enough."

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts and shook her head gently. She picked up Baby Chloe, who was tilting her head curiously at the adults, and said softly, "By the way, she has a new name now—Easy Valentino. But we'll still call her Baby."

Teresa and Anthony immediately grasped the meaning behind the name. Yet, thinking of the child's circumstances, they couldn't help but worry. "You two are so attached to her... What about her biological parents? Is the custody battle still ongoing?"

They knew little about the Langley family.

Though Margaret Hamilton was well-informed, she never spoke much about it. The Taylors only knew that Bianca Langley's fiancé had passed away and that she was fighting Vincent Croix for custody.

"Full custody has already been transferred to us," Evelyn stated firmly. "As for her father, the only one she has now is Alexander."

Warmth spread through Alexander's chest. "By the time Baby is ten months old, she'll be a big sister."

Anthony, recalling the ordeal with Annabelle, grew uneasy. "Do her maternal grandparents know? What if later—"

"Miss Langley may no longer be with us," Evelyn's voice softened. "But her grandparents will always be family. When Baby is older, we'll take her to Canada to see them."

Haunted by his own past mistakes, Anthony spoke earnestly. "It's good that you care for her so deeply, but it might be best for her to leave the past behind completely. Otherwise, it could hurt her in the future."

"I've long considered her my own daughter," Evelyn murmured, her gaze distant. "I even calculated the timing, hoping she might be..." She stopped abruptly. "But I can't be this selfish."

The thought sounded absurd, yet it was her most honest desire.

The elders fell silent. Only Alexander truly understood her pain—the child they'd lost was a shared wound.

Unconsciously, Evelyn glanced at Alexander, and their eyes met across the room.

That afternoon, Evelyn insisted on returning to the hospital. Alexander insisted on driving her, this time accompanying her all the way to the OB-GYN Department.

"I'm not that fragile," Evelyn said, exasperated.

Alexander fussed nervously. "The first trimester is the most delicate. Are you cold?"

"The lowest temperature today is 24 degrees."

He pulled out his phone to check. "If you catch a cold, you can't take medicine—it'll be miserable." He completely forgot Evelyn was an OB-GYN specialist.

He was the spitting image of Teresa.

Evelyn wanted to laugh but couldn't. Back in her office, she had just started reviewing patient files when Olivia Lightfoot burst in, flustered. "Dr. Carter, are you... okay after yesterday?"

"Just exhaustion," Evelyn replied calmly.

Olivia stomped her foot anxiously. "But you're pregnant now!"

"How many pregnant women work in this hospital?" Evelyn didn’t want special treatment. After the divorce scandal, news of her pregnancy would undoubtedly become gossip fodder.

"You didn’t tell anyone, did you?"

"I didn’t, but..." Olivia hesitated.

Turns out, after Evelyn fainted yesterday, Alexander had carried her into the ER in such a panic that the staff was alarmed. The test results, of course, couldn’t stay secret.

Evelyn covered her face, her ears burning.

Olivia quickly reassured her, "Everyone’s talking about getting you gifts—"

Before she could finish, the office door swung open abruptly.
###Chapter 871: Mirror Reflection

The office door burst open.

A man in a tailored suit stood at the threshold, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose, but they couldn’t mask the fury in his eyes. It was the same patient’s family member who had filed a complaint against Evelyn Carter just days prior.

"You doctors think you can meddle in everything?" He jabbed a finger at Evelyn’s face. "My wife wants a divorce—did you put that idea in her head?"

Olivia Lightfoot immediately stepped between them. "Watch your tone!"

"Who else could it be?" The man gnashed his teeth. "She was fine until after the baby was born, and now she’s dead set on leaving me!"

Evelyn rose slowly, the hem of her white coat swaying. "If she was truly ‘fine’ all along, why would she file for divorce during breastfeeding?"

Olivia scoffed. "Exactly! She survived childbirth, but she can’t stand being married to you. Ever wonder why?"

"I disappointed her?" The man’s face flushed crimson. "I work day and night to provide for this family! She gets to live like a queen at home—what more does she want?"

Evelyn tapped the desk lightly with her fingertips.

She’d heard this self-righteous rhetoric too many times. Men who believed money equated to love, blind to what their wives truly needed.

"Your idea of ‘doing nothing’—does that include suffering her morning sickness for her?" Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "Or were you even there to massage her legs when she had cramps at midnight?"

The man’s face darkened. "How—how could I do those things for her? Besides, I never made her work after marriage!"

Evelyn’s heart sank.

No wonder the new mother had only her elderly mother by her side during that car accident. A housewife’s world often narrowed down to just two anchors: her husband and child.

"You can’t endure her pain for her," Evelyn said softly, each word deliberate, "but you could choose not to come home. Using overtime as an excuse to dump all the responsibility onto her alone."

Humiliation twisted the man’s expression. Suddenly, he raised his arm.

Olivia froze in shock.

Evelyn was prepared, her finger already hovering over the emergency shortcut on her phone. But before she could call security, a shadow moved in front of her.

Alexander Hamilton seized the man’s wrist in an iron grip.

"Ah—ow! Let go!" The man crumpled instantly, sweat beading on his forehead. "I’m sorry, I swear I won’t come back—"

Alexander’s voice was glacial. "You’re apologizing to the wrong person."

The man whirled toward Evelyn. "Dr. Carter, I’m sorry! I promise I’ll never bother you again!"

Evelyn studied this cowardly bully and almost laughed. "Leave."

Alexander released him, and the man scrambled out like a frightened animal. Olivia hurried after him to photograph his retreating figure for documentation. Silence settled over the office.

"From now on, you’ll have bodyguards at the hospital." Alexander’s voice was tight.

Evelyn chuckled. "Are we filming a drama?"

"I’m serious." His brow furrowed. "They can wear plain clothes."

She shook her head. "The hospital has its own security. Besides, men like him are all bark and no bite."

She noticed Alexander’s knuckles had gone white. This titan of the business world now looked like a dragon guarding its last treasure, coiled with tension.

The potted plant on the windowsill thrived, lush and green—rescued by Alexander when he’d last come to water it. A memory surfaced. "You used to wait in the car when you came to the hospital before, didn’t you?"

Alexander said nothing.

He’d heard every word outside the door. Each of Evelyn’s sentences felt like a verdict on his past self.

For those three years, he too had mistaken material provision for love. Only after losing her did he learn: real love meant seeing the other’s needs—even the unspoken ones.
###Chapter 872: Lost at Sea

Evelyn Carter looked up as Alexander Hamilton unexpectedly returned, her fingers tapping lightly on the medical chart. "Why are you back?"

His suit jacket still carried the sterile scent of hospital disinfectant. He stood at the clinic doorway, his gaze settling on her slightly rounded abdomen. "Forgot something."

She arched an eyebrow.

This man was meticulous—such careless mistakes were beneath him.

Alexander turned to retrieve a paper bag from the hallway. Inside lay a soft cashmere blanket and a memory foam lumbar cushion. "The AC is too strong. This will keep you warm. The cushion helps with prolonged sitting."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she accepted them.

These were exactly what she needed most right now.

"Thank you." Her voice was soft, yet it sent ripples through his dark eyes.

After leaving the hospital, Alexander lingered before a maternity store display. His reflection in the glass showed an uncharacteristic smile.

When Emily Zade opened his office door, she nearly blinked at her boss's rare expression.

"Mr. Hamilton, shall I arrange roses?" Her instincts prickled.

His fingers paused on the desk. "Not yet."

The search report from Bianca Langley's disappearance at sea flashed through his mind, extinguishing the light in his eyes.

Emily inhaled sharply—she'd seen the deepening indentation on his ring finger.

The police call came at dawn on the seventh day.

"Mr. Hamilton, we've recovered the vehicle wreckage." The officer's voice crackled through the receiver. "Two bodies were found inside."

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white.

The funeral home lights glared coldly. Alone outside the morgue, his pen carved deep grooves into the confirmation form.

The coroner handed him an evidence bag. "These were Miss Langley's personal effects."

A sapphire earring glimmered dully in the plastic—the matching pair to what Bianca had worn on Evelyn's birthday.

Alexander dialed a long-dormant number. Vincent Croix's former associate wailed theatrically: "Dead? My cash cow!"

He hung up and transferred a sum of money.

During the ashes handover, the man rubbed his hands. "Mr. Hamilton, shall we... scatter them at sea?"

"Do as you please." Alexander turned away. The salt-laden wind reminded him of Vincent's final text: "I'll go with her."

When Evelyn pushed open the cemetery gates, ginkgo leaves rustled down like falling snow.

Emily followed with a black umbrella, hesitating. "Mrs. Hamilton..."

"I'm fine." Evelyn traced the cold headstone where Bianca's photo still blazed vibrantly. Suddenly she doubled over retching, steadied by Alexander's grasp.

Emily gasped. "The first trimester is hardest! You should be resting!"

Waving her off, Evelyn produced a velvet box from her bag. Inside lay an identical sapphire earring.

"I meant to..." Her words dissolved in the wind.

Then Alexander knelt abruptly on the damp earth, his soil-streaked palm upturned. "After the baby comes... Let's see the Northern Lights in Iceland?"

Ginkgo leaves dusted his shoulders like belated snowfall.
###Chapter 873: A Parent's Love

"Thank you, Emily." Evelyn Carter accepted the thermal cup, steam curling against her pale face.

Emily Zade gently patted her hand. "Don't overthink things. Your health comes first now."

Evelyn gazed at the trees blurring past the car window, her fingers absently tracing the cup's edge. "I know what I should do. But I can't help it. I've studied all the prenatal theories, yet when it's happening to me..."

Her voice trailed off as if choked by an invisible force.

"That's perfectly normal." Emily shook her head with a knowing smile. "When I was pregnant, I once woke my husband at 3 AM demanding to smell the hedges. Poor man nearly had a heart attack."

Evelyn's medical training kicked in automatically. "That's caused by hormonal changes heightening olfactory sensitivity. I had a patient who craved chalk dust during her second..."

Mid-sentence, she remembered this wasn't her clinic. The cemetery's outline had come into view.

"What happened then?" she asked softly. "How did your husband handle it?"

Emily's eyes softened. "He transplanted every hedge plant into our balcony. The holly he planted still grows there."

The car rolled to a stop at the cemetery gates. Alexander Hamilton stood waiting under a black umbrella, his dress shirt soaked through with sweat.

"He's been here awhile," Emily remarked meaningfully.

Stepping into the sweltering heat with white roses in her arms, Evelyn felt the umbrella immediately tilt over her. Alexander took the bouquet with his free hand.

"Bianca left something for you." His voice was deeper than usual.

Pine trees stretched wildly toward the sky, their verdant branches piercing the summer haze. "People always say green symbolizes life," Evelyn murmured, staring at the aggressive foliage.

Alexander silently handed her a waterproof envelope.

The laminated suicide note's edges were worn, as if handled repeatedly. Bianca Langley's handwriting pressed fiercely into the paper:

"Evelyn, if you're reading this, I've succeeded. Vincent Croix must die—this is the only way to ensure he disappears forever."

Evelyn's finger lingered over the word "Baby." The indented letters seemed carved with the writer's entire strength.

"...Let her never know she had a mother like me.
...
My parents will receive postcards 'from Europe' until their last days.
...
If my body isn't found, the digital version will send when she turns eighteen."

A tear splashed onto the laminate, fracturing into tiny droplets.

"She planned everything," Evelyn whispered like a sigh. "Not absence of love—but too much of it."

Alexander studied the endless rows of headstones. "She chose the safest path for her child."

Wind rustled through the pines. Pressing the letter to her chest—where new life grew—Evelyn looked toward the horizon.

"Vincent will never know," she said, "how happy his daughter will be."
###Chapter 874: Mutual Destruction

Alexander Hamilton inserted the restored dashcam memory card into his tablet. The footage that appeared on screen made the air freeze instantly.

The final moments of Bianca Langley's life began to play.

The lens captured only a hazy horizon and distant rolling waves. Two figures stood before the car hood.

Vincent Croix spoke first. His head still bandaged, his voice feigned calm but couldn't conceal anticipation: "You asked me here because you've come around? Hand over the company, and you can keep living as the privileged heiress."

He believed this was his ultimate concession.

Bianca sat on the reef, sea winds tangling her long hair. She sneered: "This is your sincerity? Can't even manage equal dialogue?"

Vincent remained standing above her. After leaving the civil affairs bureau, Bianca had requested this meeting—yet he'd delayed until sunset.

Arrogance at its extreme becomes insecurity. He needed this power play to maintain his fragile ego.

Bianca looked up at him with disdain: "Remember this place?"

Vincent gazed at the sea: "Our first date. You drove."

"I must've been blind back then." Bianca scoffed, clapping mechanically. "The damsel-in-distress act was staged, wasn't it? If I hadn't fallen for it, would you have produced some tear-jerking reunion show next?"

Her eyes brimmed with mockery.

Vincent admitted freely: "Yes. Because I loved you."

"Did you say that to that girl too?" Bianca asked abruptly.

Vincent paused before understanding, his tone shifting: "You care about that?"

Bianca dismissed him: "Sit down or leave."

"Let's talk in the car." Vincent frowned. "It's too cold here."

"Fine." Bianca pointed to the beach. "Fetch me a seashell. The same kind as before."

Vincent's expression darkened. Years ago, to impress her, he'd scavenged rare shells at low tide.

"The tides are rough lately. Might not find one."

"No shell, no discussion." Bianca turned away, hair whipping in the wind.

Gritting his teeth, Vincent trudged toward the shore. He mistook this for another spoiled whim.

As he walked away, Bianca suddenly returned to the car. Off-screen, metal snapped sharply.

Evelyn Carter and Alexander exchanged glances. Scissors severing brake lines.

When Vincent returned exhausted, Bianca was already in the driver's seat. As he pulled the door handle—click. The locks engaged.

"What are you doing?!" Vincent's face twisted in panic.

Bianca floored the accelerator. A hundred meters remained between them and the cliff.

Vincent lunged for the wheel, nails digging into leather. He stomped the brake—only to feel the pedal lifeless beneath his foot.

"I cut the lines." Bianca laughed wildly, fingers welded to the steering wheel. "This time, you won't hurt anyone else!"

Her nails tore backward from the force, blood smearing the wheel.

Suddenly, Vincent stopped struggling. Calmly, he pulled seashells from his pocket, letting them clatter to the floor.

"Fine." His smile turned eerie. "Then we die together. In the end, it's still me beside you—not Adrian."

As the car launched off the cliff, Bianca's laughter rang with liberation.

The deafening crash exploded through the speakers. Evelyn shuddered as Alexander gripped her icy hand.

Before the screen went black, the final frame froze on Vincent's grotesque grinning face.
###Chapter 875: Death Settles All Scores

The screen froze on its final frame.

Evelyn's finger hovered in midair, hesitating to press the exit button.

Alexander stood behind her, his gaze resting on her trembling shoulders. He'd already reviewed the recording himself—only after confirming its absence of graphic imagery had he dared share it with her.

"Are you okay?" His voice was soft.

A cemetery breeze brushed Evelyn's hair, carrying early spring's chill. She shook her head slowly. "No."

Even forewarned, the unveiled truth clutched her heart like an invisible fist. Evelyn stared at the endless rows of distant tombstones, her voice feather-light. "Five months into this year, and I've already buried three people."

"Mr. Anderson passed last—" Alexander began correcting.

"What difference does it make?" She cut him off. "The weather was exactly like this when Father left."

A terrifying thought struck her—was she somehow cursing those around her? The idea turned her blood to ice.

Alexander recognized her spiral but deliberately shifted focus. "Bianca and Vincent's ending was inevitable. At least Baby Chloe is safe."

Without Evelyn, Bianca wouldn't even have found someone to entrust her daughter to.

Mentioning the baby brought warmth back to Evelyn's eyes. "She said a gift would arrive on Chloe's birthday. We can't let her down."

It was Bianca's final keepsake for her child.

Evelyn inhaled deeply, forcing composure. "She'd want to rest beside Adrian. Is the burial plot arranged?"

"Everything's prepared. They need three days for final arrangements." Alexander handed her a water bottle.

The columbarium's lighting was dim. Evelyn instantly identified the plain white urn—Alexander had deliberately chosen one matching Adrian's.

As a doctor, she shouldn't believe in such things. Yet since her father's death, she'd often imagined existence beyond this world.

"Miss Langley," she whispered, "I'll raise Chloe as my own. If you can hear me, please watch over her."

The attendant worked efficiently. As the twin urns settled side by side, sunset pierced through the pines.

Evelyn placed white roses before the headstone. "She loved red roses, but the florist was out."

Petals trembled in the breeze like silent replies.

Only when twilight painted the sky crimson did Evelyn turn. "Time to go. Chloe will be waiting."

Alexander naturally took her hand. She didn't resist, though her other hand drifted protectively to her abdomen.

In the car, Evelyn suddenly asked, "What happened to Vincent's remains?"

"Cremated and given to his 'friend.'" Alexander's mouth twisted sardonically. "Langley Holdings will be entertaining soon."

Evelyn scoffed. "He had friends?"

"Even villains have allies." Alexander kept his eyes on the road. "Though this 'friend's' first question was about inheritance distribution."

Evelyn watched landscapes blur past. "Pity he escaped legal justice."

"Not necessarily bad." Alexander turned the steering wheel. "Those jackals at Langley will tear each other apart. We just need to secure Chloe's shares."

The wolf pack Vincent trained would now turn on itself. Without their master, Langley Holdings would soon become a blood-soaked arena.
###Chapter 876: Price Tags

The television played news of the arrest of the Langley Group's general manager. Evelyn Carter knelt beside Baby Chloe, helping her stack colorful blocks.

The little girl clumsily grasped the blocks, her bright eyes sparkling with excitement.

Unlike most toddlers who adored plush toys, Chloe showed an unusual fascination for puzzles and brain-stimulating games.

That trait...must have come from her father?

Yet those lively eyes and spirited personality were unmistakably Bianca Langley's carbon copy.

Evelyn stared absently at the TV screen. Alexander Hamilton's prediction had come true—Vincent Croix's former associates had struck with lethal precision.

Snip. Margaret Hamilton's floral shears nearly severed a blooming peony. She set them down with a worried sigh. "The Langleys...oh dear. If this news reaches Canada—"

"It won't." Evelyn reassured softly. "Only Alexander and I know about Miss Langley's situation. The media's entirely focused on Vincent's scandal now."

When Vincent had tried manipulating public opinion to control Bianca, he'd never imagined the backlash would erupt posthumously.

Reporters now dissected every fabricated "heroic rescue" story, even replaying his old interview clips. Meanwhile, his so-called friends were auctioning off his secrets like merchandise.

Margaret relaxed and shifted to discussing Chloe's birthday party. "When I called relatives, everyone promised absolute discretion."

Evelyn tensed. "Do they suspect Chloe's identity?"

"Goodness, no." Margaret chuckled. "They all think you and Alexander faked your divorce and can't hide it anymore."

Relief washed over Evelyn, followed by fresh unease. More people knowing the truth meant greater risks for Chloe's future.

Distracted, she absentmindedly stirred her soup with chopsticks.

"Keep stirring and you'll turn it into paste." Alexander slid a plate of peeled shrimp toward her. "Worried about the party?"

"Yes." She set down her utensils. "How do we explain everything?"

Alexander meticulously deboned a fish fillet. "Don't. Let them speculate. Nobody would dare assume the worst. At most..." His lips curved slightly. "...they'll think Chloe was born during our separation."

His tone made it sound like something to celebrate.

Remembering Margaret's misunderstanding, Evelyn lost her appetite. The soup—made with free-range chicken from Grace Anderson and Teresa Taylor's premium cordyceps—was nourishing, but she couldn't bring herself to drink it.

"Here's the plan." Alexander wiped his hands. "Just smile and nod. I'll handle the rest."

"You have a solution?"

"No." He admitted frankly. "But when I glare, people stop asking questions."

The weekend arrived swiftly.

The Hamilton estate glittered with decorations—rainbow arches in the garden, balloons adorning trees, even the rose bushes pruned into festive shapes.

Anthony Taylor and Teresa arrived early, proudly introducing to guests: "This is our daughter Evelyn." Their grins were irrepressible.

Grace and Emily Anderson bustled about, radiating joy.

Upstairs in the parlor, Evelyn and Alexander entertained Chloe. The toddler flitted about in her puff-sleeved dress like a delighted butterfly.

"Winter's finally over." Evelyn murmured, watching sunlight stream through the windows.

Alexander squeezed her hand. "Rest here. I'll manage the guests."

"I'm not made of glass." She sighed. "Besides, Chloe will get lonely."

Knock-knock-knock.

That energetic rapping could only mean one person. "Come in."

Vivian Dempsey burst in, immediately scooping Chloe into a spin. "Sweetheart! I've missed you so much!"
###Chapter 877: His Special Bond with Baby Chloe

Baby Chloe blinked her big eyes, tiny hands waving in the air as she tried to grasp the crystal pendant dangling from the chandelier. Vivian Dempsey immediately rose on tiptoe to help her reach it.

"Careful!" Evelyn Carter swiftly extended her arms to steady them both, fearing they might lose balance.

Alexander Hamilton approached silently and effortlessly plucked the crystal ornament. The baby's eyes sparkled with delight as she babbled and reached for it.

"Let me hold her," Vivian said, stretching out her hands. But the little one squirmed and burrowed deeper into Alexander's embrace.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Well, aren't you a little traitor."

"He spends more time with her. Of course she's attached." Evelyn's lips curved unconsciously as she watched Alexander skillfully cradle the baby with one arm while entertaining her with the other.

Vivian suddenly lowered her voice. "So...you two made up?"

"We're maintaining the status quo," Evelyn replied softly.

"And he actually agreed?" Vivian's eyes widened. "That doesn't sound like him."

Evelyn gazed out the window. "He told our parents he has...marriage-related trauma."

Vivian nearly choked. "He said that?"

"Yes." Evelyn nodded. "Even Margaret believed him."

Shaking her head in amazement, Vivian rummaged through her bag and produced an exquisite gift box. "Enough about him. Look what I got for the baby!"

Nestled inside was a pair of buttery yellow shoes embroidered with two adorable ducklings.

"Where are the eyes?" Evelyn picked up two black buttons.

Vivian facepalmed. "Those are blush dots..."

They shared a laugh. Evelyn's gaze drifted toward the doorway, her expression turning distant.

"Expecting someone?" Vivian noticed immediately.

"Miss Liang's gift should arrive today," Evelyn murmured.

The air grew still. Vivian pinched Evelyn's cheek playfully, trying to lighten the mood. "You're glowing lately."

"Two months pregnant—it's about time I put on some weight." Evelyn swatted her hand away with a smile.

Alexander's soothing voice drifted upstairs as he entertained the baby, punctuated by her gleeful giggles. Sunlight filtered through the curtains, painting warm golden patches on the floor.
###Chapter 878: The Battle for Recognition

Her reflection in the glass display case revealed the same ethereal beauty, yet now with a newfound vitality—like a painted maiden suddenly gifted with a soul.

Vivian Dempsey pulled Evelyn Carter aside for a long heart-to-heart, only parting when the music from downstairs grew too loud to ignore.

Alexander Hamilton stood guard at the ballroom entrance as promised. His icy demeanor deterred every curious guest from asking about the baby's origins. Even a few bold relatives froze under his sharp gaze.

From the second-floor balcony, Evelyn watched the scene unfold, her lips curving into an unconscious smile.

Baby Chloe, adorned with a diamond-studded tiara, looked every bit the little princess surrounded by admirers. Evelyn eyed the glittering crown under the chandelier's glow and whispered during the cake-cutting, "Don't tell me this is your doing again?"

Alexander steadied the baby's tiny hand on the cake knife and leaned close. "Not this time. Aunt Teresa and Uncle Anthony had it custom-made."

Evelyn bit back her words at the sight of the heavy tiara. Had it been her own parents' gift, she'd have protested. But thinking of the Taylors' intentions, she merely sighed.

The cake topper depicted an uncannily lifelike figurine of a happy family of three. Evelyn stared at the delicate edible sculpture, hesitating to take a bite.

"Shall I taste it first?" Alexander teased, wiggling frosting-coated fingers.

She speared the chocolate figurine and offered it to him. He slowly closed his lips around the fork, sweetness blooming on his tongue—though it paled beside the warmth spreading through his chest.

Baby Chloe tugged impatiently at Evelyn's dress until she received her own figurine. Evelyn quickly popped the last piece into her mouth before the toddler could claim it too.

From across the room, Vincent Wilson elbowed his friend excitedly. "See that? Sharing a fork! Told you Alex would win her back eventually!"

His friend gave him a pitying look. "Alex is about to remarry, while you're still single. Getting another lecture from the old man tonight?" Vincent's grin vanished instantly.

As the party wound down, Alexander casually asked Vincent, "Your brother didn't come today?"

Vincent smirked. "Checking up on him?" At Alexander's warning glance, he straightened. "Gregory's at an academic lecture. Sent gifts though."

Alexander's gaze lingered on an antique book set in the corner, his eyes darkening. What lecture could possibly be scheduled for today? Clearly an intentional absence. The man might have stepped aside, but his feelings hadn't entirely retreated.

"Alex," Vincent shook his head, "you're completely wrapped around her finger. Take my advice—start stashing some emergency cash."

"If only she'd agree to manage my finances." Alexander's tone carried quiet frustration. Even his will had met with Evelyn's firm refusal—she wanted no part of Hamilton Group.

Vincent tried to slip away but froze when Alexander called after him: "What did you just call Evelyn?"

"S-sis... sister-in-law?" Vincent's back prickled with cold sweat.

Amusement glinted in Alexander's eyes. "Don't say it to her face. Your sister-in-law... dislikes it." The last three words came out softly, like honey melting between his teeth.
###Chapter 879: No One Can Substitute Another

Baby Chloe's first birthday party was a grand celebration, with smiles lighting up every guest's face. Yet as night fell, the item Bianca Langley mentioned in her suicide note still hadn't surfaced. Evelyn Carter stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her fingertips absently tracing the rim of her glass.

The staff bustled about cleaning the banquet hall. Anthony and Teresa Taylor, concerned for their daughter, had urged her to rest early. Though not particularly tired, Evelyn acquiesced to her parents' worried glances and retreated to her bedroom.

The silence here was so profound she could hear leaves rustling outside.

Alexander Hamilton saw off the last guest, then frowned at the mountain of gifts. Unwrapping all those elaborately packaged boxes would likely take half a day.

"Alex," Margaret Hamilton approached, her gaze lingering on the presents. "If you two married, these would've been wedding gifts."

Rubbing his temples, Alexander sighed. "Mom, let's discuss this another time."

"If I don't bring it up, who will?" Margaret's earlier cheerfulness turned sharp. "Look at the Lins' son—his child is already in preschool!"

Grace Anderson, whose opinion of Alexander had recently improved, immediately stiffened. "Evelyn's always been sensible. Now that her father's gone, I won't let her suffer any indignities. Mr. Hamilton, what exactly are your intentions?"

Anthony and Teresa stood nearby, silent but visibly anxious.

"I—I'll go check on my sister!" Emily Anderson blurted, seizing the chance to escape. At the stairwell, she turned back and added, "Mom, don't be too harsh!"

Grace shook her head, torn between irritation and amusement. "That girl—always taking others' sides!"

Emily sprinted to Evelyn's door and burst in. "Sis! Emergency! Alex is getting interrogated by the tribunal!"

Evelyn paused while folding Baby Chloe's clothes. "What happened?"

"Mom and the Taylors have him cornered," Emily gestured dramatically. "Demanding to know his true feelings. Sis, if he treats you so well, why won't he marry you?"

Evelyn lowered her eyes, fingers twisting a fabric edge. "Maybe... the past left him with scars."

"Huh?" Emily gaped. "Shouldn't you be the one traumatized?"

"We... both are." Her voice was featherlight, though she knew Alexander was shouldering this burden for her.

Emily pondered. "So this is the legendary gamophobia?"

"Every situation differs." Evelyn smoothed her sister's hair. "You're young—don't let our issues affect you. Love is something you only understand through experience."

She studied Emily's youthful face, wishing her sister's path would be smoother.

"Sis," Emily suddenly whispered, leaning close. "Do you think... you and Alex are right for each other?"

Outside the door, Alexander's raised hand froze mid-knock.

The room held its breath for seconds.

"Used to it." Evelyn's murmur was barely audible. "I did hate him once. But after everything... the thought of him leaving like Dad did hurts. This... is fine."

Alexander's fingers clenched. His chest constricted as if struck. He retreated silently, deliberately scuffing his shoes before knocking.

"Come in." Evelyn's tone was steady now.

He entered with his usual calm smile. "Is the baby asleep? There are too many gifts downstairs—want to take her to see?"

Emily's eyes bulged at his composure.

"Not yet." Evelyn's gaze softened toward the toddler playing on the rug. After a hesitation, she asked, "Earlier... did you run into trouble?"

"Minor issues." His shrug was effortless. "All handled."

Emily scooped up Baby Chloe. "I'll take little Easy to unwrap presents!"

Once the door shut, Evelyn murmured, "My mother... didn't make things difficult?"

"It's expected." Alexander chuckled. "I told them nonmarital partnerships are trending—future kids can take your surname. They weren't thrilled, but it got us through tonight."
###Chapter 880: The Fear of Losing Her

Evelyn let out a slow, measured breath.

A subtle pang of guilt stirred in her chest.

Alexander's devotion these past months had been undeniable—visible not just to her, but to everyone around them. Yet his excessive caution had begun to weigh on her.

"If I can't even handle these trivial matters, what right do I have to promise you anything?" Alexander's expression was solemn. "You need rest now."

He was terrified she might change her mind. If she said yes, he’d shoulder everything without hesitation.

Evelyn shook her head. "I just wanted to say... thank you. For considering so much on my behalf. For sharing this burden."

The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension.

Alexander's gaze softened to something unbearably tender. For two adults, this proximity felt dangerously intimate.

Just as Evelyn raised her hand, hurried footsteps echoed down the hallway.

"Sis! Alex!" Emily's voice pierced through the door. "There's a mysterious package—can we open it?"

Their eyes met, the same thought flashing between them.

Evelyn bolted upright, momentarily forgetting her pregnancy. Alexander caught her instantly. "Easy. I'll go with you."

His steadying hands guided her downstairs to the living room.

The elders were already gathered around the baby unwrapping gifts. The unopened parcel lay untouched on the coffee table.

Grace Anderson watched Alexander's protective hold on Evelyn, her lips parting as if to speak—then closing again.

Evelyn sensed the odd atmosphere. Alexander must have given them a vague explanation. But now, there were more pressing matters.

"The sender is... Bianca?" Margaret Hamilton's voice trembled as she examined the package. "But she's already..."

Alexander swiftly unwrapped it. Evelyn's eyes welled up at the contents. "She planned this in advance... A timed delivery service."

Inside were neatly arranged photos of the baby, eighteen exquisite gift boxes—each labeled with an age.

Evelyn only opened the one marked for today: a gold-inlaid jade longevity locket, paired with silver bracelets.

In Hudson City, silver bracelets symbolized safety, prosperity, and a hundred-year life.

From the bottom of the box, Alexander retrieved a stack of documents: investment transfer agreements, notarized wills... Everything left to them.

And a handwritten letter in meticulous script.

Bianca had arranged every detail of her affairs. The final lines read: "Learning of her mother's death on her birthday would be too cruel for a child. Let today be her rebirth instead. From now on, she's your daughter."

"Consider these material things my parting gift. Tell her... they're from a friend."

A teardrop had smudged the last period.

"Her tear," Evelyn whispered, tracing the stain.

Alexander carried the items to his study. He'd promised Bianca the baby would know her birth mother's love.

After reading the letter, the elders' eyes grew moist.

"That child had an extraordinary mother," Margaret spoke for them all. "We'll honor Bianca's wish—she'll be our granddaughter in every way."

The rain lasted until dawn. Morning sunlight streamed in, unusually brilliant.

With no work on Sunday, Evelyn slept in—a rare luxury.

When she awoke, Alexander had already returned from his morning run, breakfast arranged by the bedside.

"I think... I overslept," Evelyn admitted, sheepish.
###Chapter 881: Pregnancy Brain

The weekend morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains.

Alexander Hamilton tiptoed into the bedroom, careful not to wake the sleeping Evelyn Carter. He leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead. "Sleep a little longer. It's the weekend."

Evelyn blinked drowsily and glanced at the wall clock. "It's already nine..."

"You work so hard during the week. Weekends are for resting." He tucked the blanket around her. "The baby's downstairs playing with Peanut, but..."

"But what?" Evelyn immediately caught the hesitation in his voice.

"The cat tree collapsed."

She sat up instantly. "Is Peanut okay?"

"Don't worry, she's fine. That cat's nimble as ever." Alexander chuckled. "But our little one has quite the strength. She and Peanut brought the whole thing down together."

Evelyn considered this. "Seems she's got good motor skills. I'll talk to the early education teacher about it on Monday."

"Want to go shopping?" Alexander suggested. "We can get a new cat tree and pick up some clothes for her. I unpacked all those gifts—lots of toys and jewelry, but hardly any outfits."

Evelyn remembered the duck shoes Diana Roscente had sent. "She can wear those little duck shoes today."

Alexander picked up the unfinished decoration on the shoes. "These red eyes on the duck..."

"That's blush." Evelyn suppressed a laugh. "Vivian Dempsey insisted on it."

They shared an amused glance and dressed their daughter together. Since learning to walk, the toddler refused to be carried, preferring to bounce along on her own. With Evelyn's current condition, they brought the stroller just in case.

At the mall, Evelyn walked ahead with their skipping daughter while Alexander followed behind with the stroller like an attentive bodyguard. While browsing the pet supplies section, a familiar figure made Evelyn pause.

"Miss Winston?"

Sophia Winston turned, visibly startled. "Dr. Carter?"

Evelyn spoke sincerely, "At the resort hotel, I owe you thanks. If not for your warning, I might have fallen for Lydia Laurent's tricks."

Alexander's gaze softened as he looked at Sophia.

Her eyes landed on the child, lighting up. "Is this...?"

"Our daughter," Alexander answered naturally.

A flicker of surprise crossed Sophia's face before she masked it. "May I hold her? I run a small flower shop now. Life's been... decent."

Evelyn noticed the shadow that passed through her eyes at the mention of the shop. A former social butterfly now living a quiet life—only Sophia knew the bittersweetness of that transition.

"Of course." Evelyn smiled gently. "Where's your shop? I'd love to visit."

"Just on the pedestrian street behind here." Sophia carefully cradled the baby, a rare smile appearing. "It's small, but business is steady. Though sometimes, seeing young girls receive flowers... it reminds me of the past."

Evelyn's chest tightened, thinking of Bianca Langley—the woman whose life Vincent Croix had destroyed. Sensing her mood, Alexander quietly took her hand.

Sophia teased, "Still so in love. How enviable."

Only then did Evelyn realize their hands were entwined. She pulled away quickly. "He's just worried about losing track of the baby."

Alexander remained straight-faced. "There've been too many child abduction cases lately. Can't be too careful."

Sophia burst out laughing. "Mr. Hamilton, who here could possibly take your child except me? Are you two actually guarding against me?" She tickled the giggling toddler.

"That's not—" Evelyn started to explain.

"I'm joking!" Sophia's eyes crinkled with mirth. "Dr. Carter, when did you become so gullible? They say pregnancy brain lasts three years—you'd better recover soon, or Mr. Hamilton might trick you one day."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Next you'll say 'all men are scum,' won't you?"

"I was just about to—" Sophia began, then suddenly focused on Evelyn's loose blouse—

###Chapter 882 Her Greatest Joy Was Seeing Loved Ones Happy

Evelyn gently caressed her slightly rounded belly, an unconscious smile playing on her lips. "It truly was a beautiful surprise."

This hadn't been part of her life plan, yet this tiny life had become the sole beacon guiding her through the darkness after Bianca's passing.

Sophia's eyes sparkled mischievously as she glanced at Alexander. "Congratulations, Mr. Hamilton. You'd better be a responsible father, or I'll tell Dr. Carter all about your escapades at the billiards hall."

She winked playfully at Evelyn, clearly joking.

Alexander's expression darkened instantly as he blocked Sophia's exit. "Explain yourself before leaving!"

Baby Chloe tilted her head curiously, never having seen Uncle Alexander so flustered.

Evelyn leaned back on the sofa with amused interest, enjoying the spectacle.

The ruthless business tycoon now fidgeted like an awkward teenager—the contrast was utterly entertaining.

Sophia pivoted gracefully on her heels. "No need for alarm, Mr. Hamilton. Everyone knows you only taught girls proper billiards technique there."

The clarification only made things worse.

Evelyn nodded calmly, recalling the scene she'd witnessed at the billiards hall. "That girl learned remarkably fast."

Her tone was as neutral as discussing the weather, devoid of any jealousy.

Alexander's chest tightened with frustration, yet he had no defense, standing there helplessly.

Recognizing Evelyn's emotional obliviousness, Sophia tactfully excused herself after adding Evelyn on WeChat. "Come to me for flowers—I'll give you a ten percent discount."

Baby Chloe waved enthusiastically at the pretty auntie.

Alexander secretly studied Evelyn's reaction, longing for even a hint of jealousy. Instead, she remarked, "Ms. Winston has changed quite a bit. The living room flowers need refreshing—I'd like to buy new ones."

The air grew thick with the unmistakable scent of vinegar.

"Our greenhouse has every variety. The peonies in the garden are blooming beautifully—fresher than any florist's." Alexander desperately wanted to avoid another encounter with Sophia.

This wasn't gratitude—it felt like vengeance.

Evelyn pondered. "Do we have hydrangeas?"

The Hamilton estate indeed lacked them. Not wanting to appear petty, Alexander reluctantly accompanied her to the flower shop.

Fortunately, Sophia was out purchasing inventory, leaving only staff present.

The upscale boutique featured exquisite decor with handcrafted wall ornaments—crude yet heartfelt. Evelyn immediately recognized Sophia's handiwork, warmth flooding her chest.

Alexander mentally noted which decorations held her gaze longest.

Departing with an armful of vibrant green hydrangeas, Evelyn carried a variety with unusually straight stems.

Alexander frowned. "You like these?"

He remembered Evelyn always preferred baby's breath.

"Emily adores them." Her voice softened. "Her school's nearby—we can visit her."

Since becoming pregnant, she cherished family more deeply. The shadow of her previous miscarriage made her especially cautious this time.

Alexander immediately changed course. "Emily's school has excellent academics—great for Baby Chloe's early exposure."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Your alma mater ranks higher. How ironic coming from you. Besides, she's barely formed yet."

The elite's humblebrags were always so unpretentious.

"Does Emily have a proper vase?" Alexander changed subjects. "Hydrangeas need deep water."

"She uses repurposed bottles." Evelyn's eyes warmed. "She's ingenious—always creates perfect vessels. Mass-produced vases lack soul."

"She's loved beautiful trinkets since childhood, but money was tight with Dad raising us alone. Emily would claim not to like hair clips just to save pennies."

The florist visit had reminded Evelyn of her sister.

During medical school, she'd promised Emily a gift for good grades. When her sister ranked top ten, Evelyn took her shopping—where Emily became transfixed by a florist's window display.

Behind the glass sat a bouquet of emerald hydrangeas.

Though a single stem cost a week's allowance, seeing Emily's radiant eyes, Evelyn bought it without hesitation.

More than her own happiness, she wanted joy for those she loved.
###Chapter 883: The One Who's Worth It

Alexander Hamilton's fingers tapped lightly on the steering wheel after listening to Evelyn Carter's story. "So you never bought that last hydrangea bouquet, did you?"

Evelyn's lashes lowered. "Emily said she didn't like it after seeing the price. She dragged me to look at regular hydrangeas instead, claiming they were prettier. But I saw how long she'd stared at those white ones."

Children who've known poverty understand—some desires remain unspoken. Now that life was better, she wanted to give her sister everything she'd missed.

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed, a dull ache spreading through his chest. How he wished time could reverse, letting him recognize this stubborn yet tender woman sooner.

On the university campus that weekend, they looked like any young couple revisiting their alma mater with their toddling child. Only they knew the years of each other's youth they'd missed.

He'd deliberately dressed casually today, his gold-rimmed glasses softening his sharp features until he truly resembled a young professor. As Evelyn texted Emily their location, he bent to brush petals from their daughter's hair, his profile impossibly gentle.

Nearby, female students whispered.

"Is that a new professor? So handsome!"
"Stop drooling—can't you see he's married with a kid?"
"But he's absolutely dreamy. Just one photo wouldn't hurt..."

Evelyn was about to intervene when a figure came barreling toward them.

"Sis!"

Emily skidded to a stop like an overexcited fawn, nearly knocking Evelyn over with her hug. Alexander's pupils constricted, almost tipping the stroller.

"White hydrangeas!" Emily's eyes sparkled as she spread her arms for another tackle. Alexander swiftly intercepted, producing two snack bags. "Your sister bought these specially for you."

Emily glanced at Evelyn for confirmation before accepting them gleefully. A classmate asked, "These your relatives?"

"My big sister! She's a doctor at Central Hospital!" Emily jutted her chin proudly. "Top of her class at Hudson Medical, studied abroad on scholarship!"

The girls instantly brightened. Compared to an unavailable man, an accomplished career woman was far more inspiring.

Alexander tactfully retreated, guiding their daughter through drifts of rose petals. Amid the pink-and-white snowfall, he played with the little girl like a professional stay-at-home dad.

"Dr. Carter," a student ventured, "did you and your husband meet in college? How do you balance career and family?"

Evelyn watched the distant figure crouching to collect petals, her lips curving. "Actually, you should ask him."

These days, she didn't need to balance anything—Alexander arranged it all flawlessly. School runs, meals, chores—he handled them better than professional nannies.

"Then..." The girl blushed. "How do you know if someone's worth it?"

Evelyn gazed at the swirling petals. "Time will show you."

Once she'd thought she understood, only to fall and shatter. Later she vowed never to look back, yet he'd stubbornly waited. Now, she simply cherished this hard-won peace.
###Chapter 884: All Men Are Crooked Trees

Emily Anderson watched as her classmates crowded around Evelyn Carter, bombarding her with questions. Her chest tightened. She hurried forward and thrust the hydrangea bouquet in her arms toward her sister. "Eve, these flowers will wilt if we don't put them in water soon!"

The midsummer sun was relentless. The delicate edges of the hydrangea petals had already begun to curl. Emily knew her sister wasn't short on money these days, but their childhood habit of frugality made it impossible for her to waste anything. Clutching the flowers, she dashed toward the dorm, her ponytail bouncing behind her.

With Emily gone, the group of girls felt awkward continuing their gossip. Their gazes drifted to Alexander Hamilton playing with Baby Chloe on the lawn nearby, their eyes filled with envy.

"I want to marry someone like that someday—someone who's good with kids and takes care of the home," a girl with a topknot murmured.

The bespectacled girl next to her adjusted her glasses. "Please. All men are crooked trees. Why hang yourself on just one? If you ask me, a career is what really matters. Men? Well..."

The girls giggled as they walked away.

Evelyn watched their youthful figures retreat, her gaze unconsciously settling on Alexander. He was crouched on the grass, picking up fallen petals one by one to amuse the baby. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across his shoulders.

She wasn’t sure if he had heard them.

Not that it mattered to her whether he had or not. What unsettled her was how she had allowed Emily’s classmates to believe they were married. The lie pricked at her heart like a tiny thorn.

She knew too well the bitterness of shattered hope. Even with all the history between them, she couldn’t bear to hurt him this way.

Alexander seemed to sense her gaze. He deliberately tossed the petals high into the air, turning to her amid the fluttering shower of petals. Behind his glasses, his eyes held a gentle warmth. "Done talking?"

"Yeah. Emily went back to put the flowers in water." Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"Should we take her out for dinner?" Alexander brushed grass stains from his trousers. "You pick the place."

By sunset, they had dropped Emily off at her dorm. The girl clung to the new backpack Evelyn had bought her, adamantly refusing to return to the Hamilton estate with them.

"I’m not about to be a third wheel!" Emily winked at her sister before darting into the building.

Evelyn shook her head helplessly, though the corners of her lips lifted despite herself.

On the drive back, Baby Chloe had already dozed off in her car seat. Alexander glanced at Evelyn in the rearview mirror. "Want to take a walk by the river? It’s too hot during the day. Now’s the perfect time."

He knew she needed the exercise, but he also worried about her drowning in the grief of Bianca Langley’s death. Lately, he often woke to the sound of her startled breaths in the middle of the night.

"Sure." Evelyn turned to the window.

The riverside at night was alive with scattered lights. Couples strolling, elderly walking their dogs, children playing—it painted a vivid scene of everyday life. Crickets chirped in the grass, and occasionally, a stray cat darted past, its green eyes gleaming in the dark.

Evelyn took a deep breath of the damp night air, her tense nerves gradually unwinding.

"Emily is happy," Alexander said suddenly. "Aunt Grace and Uncle Andrew gave her all the love she needed."

Evelyn’s fingers absently traced the railing. "If it weren’t for me—"

"There are no 'what ifs,'" Alexander cut in. "They chose to love you, just like you chose to keep this baby."

The river breeze brushed through Evelyn’s hair. She thought of her father’s rough hands, her mother’s warm embrace. That love, deeper than blood, had long since become part of her bones.

The mansion was quiet when they returned. A new cat tree stood in the corner of the living room, with Peanut curled up in the topmost cubby, his tail swaying lazily.

Alexander carefully settled the baby in her crib before returning to the living room with a toolkit. With practiced ease, he affixed corner guards to the cat tree, his movements as efficient as a professional installer.

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, watching him work. "When did you learn how to do this?"

"When the baby started learning to walk." He didn’t look up. "A father should know some practical skills." He paused. "We’ll need these when our child is born."

Moonlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, stretching their shadows long across the floor. The soft edges of the corner guards glowed a warm beige under the light—just like the fragile peace they had carefully built together.
###Chapter 885: The Inquisition

Alexander Hamilton knelt by the baby crib, carefully tucking in the blanket around Baby Chloe. The warm glow of the nightlight illuminated his focused profile. Evelyn Carter leaned against the doorframe, a rare sense of peace washing over her.

Weekends always slipped away too quickly. On Monday morning, Alexander drove Evelyn to the hospital as usual. Before leaving, he bent down to kiss their sleeping daughter and refilled Peanut’s food bowl.

"Drive safely," Margaret Hamilton hesitated, then simply handed Evelyn a thermos. "If you feel tired, take the day off. Don’t push yourself."

Evelyn accepted the cup, her fingers brushing its warm surface. "Thank you, Aunt Margaret. I’ll be careful."

"You’re always too considerate," Margaret sighed. "If Alexander had half your steadiness, I wouldn’t worry so much. A man in his thirties, still so indecisive..."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, offering no reply.

Grace Anderson emerged from the kitchen, stuffing two lunch boxes into Evelyn’s bag without glancing at Alexander.

Alexander took the car keys without flinching, smoothly starting the engine.

"Maybe..." Evelyn fastened her seatbelt, hesitating. "I should explain things to Aunt Margaret?"

"No." Alexander vetoed immediately. "If we come clean now, the scolding I endured these past few days would be for nothing."

He turned the steering wheel, his tone resigned. "My mother finds fault with everything I do these days. If you suddenly change your story, she’ll assume I pressured you."

Evelyn watched the scenery flash by outside the window, murmuring, "Then I should move back to the apartment."

Alexander’s grip on the wheel tightened. "The baby cries for you at night."

The words struck a chord. Evelyn sighed and dropped the subject.

In the CEO’s office at Hamilton Group, Emily Zade noticed her boss’s distraction.

"Mr. Hamilton," she handed him a file, "relationship troubles again?"

Alexander rubbed his temples. "Mine."

Emily nodded knowingly. "Mood swings during pregnancy?"

"She doesn’t want to burden the elders." Alexander rarely showed frustration. "I’m trying to figure out how to..."

"I understand." Emily adjusted her glasses. "When I was pregnant, I felt the same. The key is making your wife feel that caring for her is the family’s joy, not a duty."

Alexander fell into thought.

At noon, Alexander carried a lunchbox into the OB-GYN department, only to find Evelyn’s seat empty.

"Where’s Dr. Carter?" He stopped a passing nurse.

The nurse looked surprised. "Dr. Carter’s in the OR. She’s been there for three hours."
###Chapter 886 I'm Worried About You

Alexander Hamilton frowned slightly, tapping his phone screen. The call log was empty, and there were no new notifications in his messages. His Adam's apple bobbed as he muttered, "I was careless."

A nurse organizing medical records didn't look up as she said, "Dr. Carter left in a hurry. She probably didn’t have time to inform you. The surgery will take at least another hour and a half. If it’s urgent, I can relay a message."

A lung transplant patient had suffered a sudden placental abruption—a critical emergency. As a key OB-GYN specialist, Evelyn Carter had to join the emergency surgery immediately. Alexander didn’t know the details. His only concern was that she might miss lunch.

"Please give this to her," he said, handing the nurse a thermal lunchbox. "Remind her to heat it in the microwave."

The red light above the operating room finally dimmed. Evelyn removed her mask, her bangs damp with sweat. Leaning against the wall, her legs trembled slightly.

"No wonder you're Professor Liang’s star pupil," the chief of internal medicine said, patting her shoulder. "Though your stamina could use some work."

Evelyn forced a weak smile. A dull ache pulsed in her lower abdomen, forcing her to hunch slightly for relief.

"Dr. Carter is almost three months pregnant," a nurse whispered.

The chief’s expression darkened. "Why wasn’t I told? Go rest—now!"

In the locker room, Evelyn collapsed onto a bench. Her fingers brushed the faint swell of her stomach as she silently prayed, Please be okay, little one.

The prenatal report showed normal fetal development. But as a doctor, she knew better than anyone how precarious the first trimester could be. Every contraction sent a jolt of terror through her.

"Dr. Carter!" A nurse hurried into the hallway. "Mr. Hamilton sent lunch."

Only then did Evelyn realize she hadn’t eaten since morning. The thermal container held steamed perch and yam rib soup—dishes she’d been craving lately.

But the moment the oily scent hit her, nausea churned in her gut. She choked down a few bites of plain congee before dumping the rest in the trash.

Her phone buzzed. A new message from Alexander popped up, his profile picture now replaced with the blue robot cat she loved.

—How was the surgery? The nurse said you took an emergency case. Call me when you see this. I’m worried.

Evelyn’s lips curved at the goofy Doraemon avatar. She opened her gallery and switched her own profile picture to one of Peanut, their Ragdoll cat, batting at a butterfly.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard before typing a simple reply:
"Just finished. Everything’s fine."
###Chapter 887: The Wrong Formula for Romance

Evelyn Carter stared at her phone screen, fingers hesitating over the keyboard for several seconds.

Alexander Hamilton's lunch invitation arrived with its usual punctuality. She pressed her lips together, her reply unconsciously softening in tone.

"The surgery was successful. Both mother and baby are doing well. Thanks for asking."

At the Hamilton Group's penthouse, Alexander's lips curved slightly as he reread the brief message. His fingertips traced the words on the screen.

Vincent Wilson's confident assurance echoed in his mind: "This emoji is guaranteed to make her smile."

A cartoon puppy holding flowers bounced across the display. Alexander held his breath, waiting for a response.

Ding.

Six black dots appeared in the chat bubble.

Alexander's brow furrowed. He immediately dialed Vincent's number.

"Alex..." Vincent's voice oozed guilt. "Maybe... this isn't her style."

Evelyn's social circle was small but refined. She'd always been slow to adopt internet trends, preferring life's tangible moments. Even her emoji collection had been forced upon her by Vivian Dempsey.

Among all the women Vincent had dated, none resembled Evelyn.

The call ended with a decisive click.

Alexander massaged his temples. Trusting Vincent's dating advice had been pure folly.

Meanwhile, Vincent clutched his phone, forehead beading with sweat. He'd royally screwed up.

The conference room's atmosphere turned glacial.

Executives exchanged nervous glances, dress shirts clinging to sweat-drenched backs. The CEO's brief absence had transformed him into a storm cloud.

"Was it the financial report...?"

"Nonsense! Clearly your marketing team messed up!"

"Quiet," the senior director whispered. "My money's on marital troubles."

Instant silence.

At precisely 5:00 PM, Alexander strode out. The executives exhaled in unison, making immediate plans for a stress-relieving bar trip.

Outside the hospital, Alexander froze mid-step.

Evelyn emerged from the outpatient wing, face pale as parchment. One hand braced against the wall, her brow pinched in discomfort.

Alexander covered the distance in three strides. He seized her bag with one hand while steadying her shoulder with the other.

Evelyn looked up into his worried gaze. For some reason, that ridiculous puppy emoji flashed through her mind. The corner of her mouth twitched, laughter nearly escaping.

Alexander misinterpreted the expression as pain. In the next instant, her feet left the ground as he swept her into a bridal carry.

"What are you doing?" Evelyn gasped.

"Don't speak." He marched purposefully back toward the building.

Patients gawked from the hallway. Evelyn thumped his shoulder. "Put me down! It's just morning sickness!"

Alexander paused, glancing down. "Just morning sickness?"

"I'm an OB-GYN," she said dryly. "Think I can't tell the difference?"

Relief washed over him, but he still insisted on carrying her to the car. He settled her gently into the passenger seat, fastening the seatbelt with excessive care.

"You left early, and you looked so pale..." Guilt laced his voice.

"Long surgery today. No early shift tomorrow." Her words cut off as she clapped a hand over her mouth.

Alexander immediately reached over, patting her back with featherlight touches. Each motion treated her like the most fragile treasure.
###Chapter 888: Kneeling to Help Her Change Shoes

Evelyn's morning sickness hit without warning. She curled up in the passenger seat, her slender fingers gripping the seatbelt so tightly her knuckles turned white. The nausea churned in her stomach, beads of sweat forming on her forehead as if she'd just been pulled from water.

Alexander immediately rolled down the window. The early summer breeze carried the fresh scent of grass and leaves into the car. His gaze swept over the air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror—without hesitation, he yanked it off and tossed it out.

"Better?" His voice was soft, careful not to startle her.

Evelyn managed a weak nod. She hadn’t expected her sense of smell to become so acute. The car fragrance she could tolerate just last week now felt like a trigger.

"I’ll have the car deep-cleaned tomorrow." Alexander steered with one hand, the other hovering protectively behind her back. "Should we go home to rest?"

She shook her head. "No, it’s just—" Before she could finish, another wave of dry heaving hit.

He immediately turned the car around. Ten minutes later, they pulled up smoothly in front of the villa.

Walking inside, Evelyn’s steps were unsteady. She leaned against the foyer wall, slowly lowering herself onto the shoe bench. The movement made her vision darken, forcing her to close her eyes briefly.

When she opened them again, Alexander was already on one knee before her. His long fingers deftly untied her shoelaces, his touch as gentle as if handling something fragile.

"I can do it—" She instinctively pulled her foot back.

He held her ankle firmly. "Don’t move." His voice was quiet but firm. "Let me take care of you."

Just as her slippers slid on, footsteps approached from the dining room. Grace Anderson and Margaret Hamilton walked in, freezing at the sight of Alexander still kneeling.

The air turned thick with tension.

Margaret recovered first, grabbing Grace’s arm. "Oh! The soup on the stove!" They retreated hastily into the kitchen.

Evelyn’s ears burned. She tried to stand, but Alexander steadied her. He leaned close, his warm breath brushing her earlobe. "Easy."

"You did that on purpose?" She glared at him.

He chuckled. "I read that pregnant women shouldn’t bend over." A pause. "And I’ve wanted to do this for a long time."

Her heart skipped. She looked away. "Smooth talker."

"Truth." His expression turned serious. "Evelyn, I want to be part of this child’s every moment. From your morning sickness to the first kick, to every night after they’re born." He took her hand. "Give me this chance. Please."

She froze. Memories surfaced—her childhood neighbor, a single mother working three jobs until she collapsed. The child always waiting alone at the school gate, watching classmates leave with both parents.

"Are you sure?" Her voice trembled. "This isn’t something to take lightly."

His gaze burned with certainty. "I’ve never been more sure of anything."

From the kitchen came the clatter of utensils and hushed conversation. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting warm patches on the hardwood.

Evelyn looked down at their joined hands and gave a small nod.
###Chapter 889: I Wish You Could Be More Selfish

Alexander Hamilton's promise sounded sincere, but Evelyn Carter had witnessed too many broken vows in the hospital.

He took a deep breath and suddenly grasped her hand. "I'll prove it with actions."

Evelyn's stomach churned violently, leaving her too weak to speak.

In the dining room, their mothers were chatting warmly. Margaret Hamilton hinted, "Young people should go on more dates."

Grace Anderson agreed, "Take more walks before the baby bump shows."

Evelyn forced herself to sit. "Let's eat first."

The mothers immediately sprang into action, piling her bowl high with food in seconds.

The multigrain rice smelled earthy and comforting, but Evelyn's throat tightened at the sight of the lavish spread.

"Lemon water helps with morning sickness," Alexander suddenly stood up.

He returned with a cup of warm honey-lemon water, perfectly balanced between sweet and tart.

Evelyn took a small sip, her brow finally relaxing.

Margaret wondered silently: If he's this attentive, why hasn't he proposed yet?

Throughout the meal, Alexander performed like a professional nanny—removing fish bones, skimming grease, feeding the baby, and finally eating the cold leftovers.

Grace watched, her stance softening gradually.

While clearing the dishes, she noticed Evelyn hadn't touched her favorite fruits.

"Are you feeling unwell?" Grace knocked on the bedroom door.

Evelyn assumed it was Alexander. "Come in."

A mother's warm hand pressed against her forehead.

"Mom?" Evelyn's nose tingled with emotion.

Grace studied her daughter with concern. "Tell me what you'd like to eat."

The soft lamplight eased Evelyn's pallor. "Just grapes and blueberries."

"That's good..." Grace still looked troubled.

Evelyn linked arms with her. "I performed a major surgery today. Even the department head insisted I take time off."

Grace sighed. "I support your career, but I wish you could be more selfish sometimes."
###Chapter 890: He Wants Remarriage, I Want Freedom

"What mother doesn't love her own child?" Grace Anderson gently held Evelyn Carter's hand. "You've done wonderfully. Don't be so hard on yourself."

Evelyn immediately tensed when she sensed her mother's shift in tone: "As for Alexander Hamilton..."

She braced herself, fearing the next words would be about that man.

Grace glanced around cautiously before lowering her voice: "I can see Alexander genuinely cares for you now. When I was pregnant with your sister, even your father wasn't this attentive."

At the mention of her father, Evelyn's expression softened. "Before Dad passed, I promised to take care of you both. This way, I haven't failed him."

"Your father entrusted you to Alexander out of desperation." Grace sighed. "But I know he'd want your happiness above all."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest, though she found it amusing. "Mom, I'm perfectly content. Alexander wouldn't dare mistreat me. As for marriage..." She hesitated. "This arrangement works well—it leaves room for an easy separation later."

"Separation?" Grace's face paled.

"Just a hypothetical." Evelyn quickly clarified, spending considerable effort to convince her mother she truly didn't care about marriage.

Finally, Grace relented. "As long as you're happy. But remember—a man unwilling to commit is hiding something. If he steps out of line again, you must tell me!"

Evelyn rubbed her nose, at a loss for words.

That evening, she recounted the conversation to Alexander: "My mother's started worrying about us not marrying. I'm thinking of moving to the apartment for a while."

Alexander was prepared. "I have an idea. Let's say we want more privacy as a couple—the family will approve."

Evelyn's eyes brightened, then dimmed. "But what about the baby?"

"Weekdays at the apartment, weekends home." He'd already planned it. "She's used to not seeing us during the day, and now there's preschool."

The realization struck Evelyn—preschool's greatest function was giving parents breathing room.

At breakfast next morning, Alexander's proposal received unanimous approval. By the time Evelyn came downstairs, everything was settled.

"What excuse did you use?" She intercepted Alexander in the yard, suddenly realizing "couple's privacy" might invite more complications.

He smiled knowingly. "I said the apartment's closer to the hospital for your shifts and better rest. They supported it immediately."

Though Margaret Hamilton and Grace exchanged knowing looks, they agreed for Evelyn's wellbeing—insisting only that Auntie Wu accompany them for meals.

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Thank you. I'll pack."

"No need." Alexander gestured to the walk-in closet. "I organized everything last night."

Evelyn shook her head in amusement. This man left nothing to chance.

That afternoon at the hospital, Evelyn radiated energy. Olivia Lightfoot pulled her into an office, buzzing with excitement. "Dr. Carter! What happened yesterday? The whole hospital's talking!"

Evelyn's temple throbbed. "About what?"

"Some say you remarried! Others claim you're in some angsty lovers' game—you wanting freedom, him demanding remarriage, so he ambushed you at work..."
###Chapter 891: Have Fun

Alexander Hamilton visited the hospital every single day without fail to bring lunch for Evelyn Carter. But he always stayed within the OB-GYN Department. It wasn't until yesterday, when he carried Evelyn through the Emergency Department in front of everyone, that their relationship became hospital-wide gossip.

"What kind of ridiculous rumors..." Evelyn massaged her temples and sighed, giving Olivia Lightfoot a helpless look. "You know we're not remarried, right?"

Olivia blinked. "Of course I know. But others don't." She leaned in curiously. "Dr. Carter, what exactly happened yesterday?"

The conversation had circled back again.

Evelyn exhaled, fastening the buttons on her white coat as she explained. "Just normal morning sickness. He overreacted and made a scene. Stop laughing."

"Sorry—pfft!" Olivia covered her mouth, shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter, tears forming at the corners of her eyes.

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "After knowing you for so long, this is the first time I've seen you laugh this much."

Olivia buried her face in her arms on the desk, her shoulders still trembling. She thought to herself—how could Alexander not know about these things? The man had practically memorized every medical journal, short of actually getting a medical license.

"Whatever." Evelyn found herself smiling too. Once Olivia calmed down, she turned to business. "How's that lung transplant patient from yesterday?"

Olivia's expression turned serious. "Still critical." She lowered her voice. "Dr. Carter, you don’t keep up with hospital gossip, do you?"

Evelyn shook her head. She barely had time to breathe between patients, let alone listen to rumors.

"This patient..." Olivia hesitated. "She got the transplant after only a year on the waiting list."

Evelyn frowned. "Extremely severe case?"

"Rumor has it pregnancy worsened her condition." Olivia whispered. "Internal Medicine advised termination, but she refused."

Evelyn's chest tightened. As a doctor, she understood the patient’s choice. But as a mother, she couldn’t help but worry.

Two days later, the patient was finally transferred out of the ICU. Coincidentally, it was the weekend, and a group of young residents suggested celebrating with dinner.

"Terrible timing!" Olivia groaned. "I’m on call tomorrow—I can only stay for the meal."

Evelyn was about to decline when the rotating interns surrounded her.

"Dr. Carter, our attending is your classmate!"
"Tell us about your research!"
"Can we take a photo with you?"

Faced with their enthusiasm, Evelyn had no choice but to agree. She texted Alexander: "Department dinner tonight. No need to pick me up."

Alexander was organizing documents in his office when the message arrived. His fingers stilled. Silently, he canceled the restaurant reservation and concert tickets, replying: "Have fun. Call me when you’re done."

Reading it, Evelyn inexplicably sensed a hint of dejection between the lines. She sent back a smiling emoji and slipped her phone into her pocket.

Alexander stared at the yellow smiley face for a long moment, assuming she was genuinely happy, and returned to work.

When Emily Zade entered, she froze. "Mr. Hamilton, you’re working late tonight?"

"Yes." He didn’t look up. "Last-minute arrangements."

Emily quietly retreated, thinking her boss’s mood was gloomier than a typhoon.
###Chapter 892: Silence is Golden

"Emily, you all can head home first." He paused, then added, "It's the weekend. Get some proper rest."

As night fell, the lights in Hamilton Tower gradually dimmed, leaving only the top-floor office illuminated.

Hospital department gatherings always took extra care when selecting restaurants. While taste preferences varied, hygiene standards were non-negotiable. Doctors from two departments created a temporary group chat, enthusiastically debating options.

When Evelyn saw the voting results, Lily Waters had already won by a landslide. This private kitchen she'd frequented with Alexander held too many memories.

"Something wrong with this place?" Olivia leaned closer. "Did it make some hygiene violation list?"

"No." Evelyn's finger hovered over her screen. "It's just..."

Memories of encountering Annabelle and Lydia here flooded back. The restaurant felt like fate's crossroads—every visit brought unexpected turns.

"Bad food?"

"The flavors are actually quite good."

Olivia tilted her head. "Then why do you look like you're marching to the gallows? I thought you'd veto it."

"Let's go here." Evelyn pocketed her phone, not wanting to dampen the mood.

After work, the group arrived promptly. Their reserved private room spared them the waitlist.

The department's Dutch treat tradition turned ordering into a relay race. When the phone reached Evelyn, she immediately selected steamed perch.

"Not browsing more?" A colleague seemed surprised.

"No need."

Olivia interjected, "Dr. Carter's a regular here. Her picks never miss."

This sparked immediate curiosity. Evelyn briefly recommended signature dishes: "I prefer lighter flavors, so take these as suggestions."

"Perfect for sampling more with a big group!" The designated mood-lifter laughed.

When dishes arrived, Evelyn's recommendations earned universal praise.

"Dr. Carter," a new resident asked excitedly, "social media says Lily Waters' night views are super photogenic. Any angles you'd recommend?"

Images flashed of Annabelle photographing Lydia by the pond. "The stone steps near the water work well."

Several female colleagues immediately planned a post-dinner photoshoot.

"Dr. Carter," the young resident suddenly ventured, "when you came here before, was it with that guy who drives you daily? You two seem so in love—newlyweds?"

Evelyn's chopsticks froze.

Newlywed wasn't wrong, though their most recent "wedding" had been a divorce. The topic was landmine territory.

As she struggled to respond, another colleague tugged the questioner's sleeve, whispering urgently.

The resident flushed crimson. "Sorry, Dr. Carter, I didn't know—"

"It's fine." Evelyn offered a faint smile.

The resident hastily raised her juice glass. "Let me toast you."

"Our situation is complicated," Evelyn sipped her drink, "so I don't discuss it much."

Noticing the awkwardness, someone swiftly changed subjects: "Heard anesthesiology's Dr. Wilson is dating!"

This detonated the table.

"With his qualifications, that's hardly surprising!"

"Seriously? He used to visit OB-GYN so often."

"Met during an academic exchange, apparently..."

Gregory's love life became the meal's focal point. Evelyn ate quietly, avoiding the discourse.

Tonight's fears had materialized one by one. While she genuinely wished Gregory happiness, as someone who knew too much, silence remained her only option.
###Chapter 893: An Unexpected Encounter

Olivia's fingers tightened slightly around her juice glass. She knew all about Gregory's unrequited feelings, but being questioned directly by colleagues made her pretend to choke. "Cough! Who told you that?"

"Dr. Lightfoot, your face is turning red," the colleague teased with a wink. "Don't worry, we can keep secrets."

As if anyone would believe that. Olivia shot Evelyn a pleading look, searching for a way to change the subject when the private dining room door suddenly opened.

A server wheeled in a cart. "Complimentary desserts and honey lemon water, courtesy of a gentleman."

"Who's this generous?" The group exchanged puzzled glances.

Evelyn's phone vibrated in her palm. She glanced down to see a message from Alexander, whose profile picture had somehow changed to match hers—a photo of Peanut.

Vincent saw you dining there. Let me know before you head home.

Her fingers hovered over the screen for two seconds before replying with a simple, "Okay."

Alexander stared at that single word under the office lights, his silhouette stretching long against the window's cityscape backdrop. The document before him remained untouched.

"Let's go sing!" someone suggested as dinner wound down. "It's only eight—too early to call it a night."

Olivia checked the duty roster. "I have the morning shift tomorrow, but... fine, I'll suffer for the cause!"

Laughing, the group headed out—only to run into the Wilson brothers in the parking lot. Vincent paled. He'd deliberately used the side exit to avoid this very scenario.

"What a coincidence," Evelyn greeted calmly.

Gregory's Adam's apple bobbed before he simply nodded to the others. "You all are...?"

"Join us, Dr. Wilson!" An enthusiastic colleague nudged closer to Evelyn, making space.

Vincent yanked his brother back. "We have an emergency!" he hissed. "Mom just texted—she needs us home now."

The night breeze carried Gregory's fleeting glance toward Evelyn before he looked away. "Next time." His voice was barely audible.
###Chapter 894: The Father and My Husband Could Be Two Different People

Adulthood comes with no curfews.

It's merely a polite excuse.

Gregory Wilson gave a slight nod, his voice gentle. "Apologies, we do have prior arrangements. But there's a lovely lounge bar nearby if you'd like to unwind."

His recommendation proved exquisite. Upon arrival, the group discovered not only private rooms with impeccable soundproofing but also an ambiance of refined elegance—far removed from the typical clamor of karaoke venues.

Unfortunately, peak hours left only one large enclosed room available.

Olivia Lightfoot noticed the glass-enclosed garden area. "Isn't that section available?"

The space offered panoramic views amidst lush greenery, far more comfortable than confined private rooms.

The server apologized. "That's reserved for members only."

"Can we sign up now?" Olivia pressed.

"Certainly, though it requires a minimum deposit of—" The quoted figure made everyone gasp.

Exchanging glances, the group quickly agreed the standard room would suffice.

Inside, a colleague wiped sweat, exclaiming, "Goodness, that membership fee is outrageous! Regular prices are steep enough without premium tiers."

Had it not been for splitting costs and skipping dinner, none would've considered such luxury.

"Dr. Wilson's family must be loaded. The rumors seem true."

"Heir to the local Wilson business empire, apparently. But he ditched commerce for medicine."

"Money buys freedom..."

Evelyn Carter listened silently, Alexander Hamilton's image surfacing in her mind. Wealth had its privileges, yet true freedom remained far more complex.

While others adjusted equipment, Olivia sidled up to Evelyn. "Thinking of someone, Dr. Carter? Gregory?"

"A little," Evelyn murmured. "Haven't seen him lately—even the last joint surgery had Dr. Han substituting. Wonder what new research this conference will present. I'll check recordings later."

OB-GYN and anesthesiology collaborations had grown with rising epidural adoptions—a field she closely followed.

Olivia's expression turned complicated. From anyone else, this would sound like deflection. But Evelyn's sincerity was undeniable—this woman could genuinely wed medicine for life.

"Did I say something wrong?" Evelyn noticed the shift.

"Not at all." Olivia patted her shoulder. "Dr. Carter, it's clear you harbor zero romantic interest in Gregory."

Evelyn glanced around, lowering her voice. "Let's drop this permanently."

Nothing had ever transpired between them, and he'd maintained distance. Yet walls had ears—the department already buzzed with rumors about his crush on an OB-GYN doctor.

The thought made her sigh.

Though vivacious, Olivia understood boundaries and nodded promptly.

Across the room, colleagues played rock-paper-scissors to determine singing order.

The song-chooser beckoned eagerly. "Dr. Carter! After all this time, we've never heard you sing. Grace us!"

"I'm tone-deaf—better spare your ears." Evelyn declined. The enclosed space unsettled her.

Olivia interjected, "I'll go! Play The Doctor—consider it professional development."

Laughter erupted as volunteers instantly surrendered the mic.

Evelyn tried embracing the merriment, but growing nausea made her press a hand to her abdomen. The dim lighting masked her pallor.

"Dr. Carter, feeling warm? Try this iced orange juice." A colleague offered a chilled glass.

An OB-GYN coworker intervened. "She's pregnant."

The flustered colleague swapped it for room-temperature. "Congratulations! How far along? You're barely showing."

"Nearly three months." Evelyn accepted the drink.

"Almost past the risky phase. Your husband's so attentive with daily pickups—he must worry sick. Once the baby arrives, your little family..." The speaker abruptly recalled dinner conversations and choked back words.

Evelyn and her ex-husband clearly weren't reconciling, and she intended to raise the child alone. Such well-wishes rang hollow.

With Olivia mid-performance, no one could lighten the moment.

"Your kindness is appreciated." Evelyn's voice remained steady. "As for parenthood—the father and my husband could be two separate people. The latter's absence changes nothing."
###Chapter 895: The Rival

Her pupils dilated in shock, disbelief written across her face.

Dr. Evelyn Carter was usually as gentle as water. Who would have guessed such steel lay beneath that calm exterior? The woman couldn't help pressing further. "Dr. Carter, when do you plan to start your maternity leave? I'd like to arrange my schedule accordingly."

Medical professionals already had scarce vacation time. Maternity leave was especially precious. Everyone tried to strike a careful balance between career and family.

Evelyn's fingertips traced the rim of her water glass. "One week before the due date, as planned. But if my condition worsens..." Her voice softened. "Some medications are off-limits during pregnancy."

The pain of losing a child was etched into her bones. No matter how much she loved her profession, she would never risk her unborn baby's safety.

The other woman was single, her knowledge of pregnancy limited to textbook descriptions. "I've read that labor pain is the most intense level. The discomfort must be..."

She stopped mid-sentence upon noticing Evelyn's reddened eyes and distant expression. "Dr. Carter, are you feeling unwell now?"

"My apologies." Evelyn stood abruptly. "I need to visit the restroom."

The private room's stuffy air had triggered sudden morning sickness. She hurried out, not wanting to disrupt her colleagues' gathering.

Inside the restroom, the overpowering floral scent only intensified her nausea. Evelyn dry-heaved several times before splashing cold water on her flushed cheeks.

Meanwhile, a black sedan pulled up silently outside the lounge bar.

Alexander Hamilton had appeared composed when receiving Vincent Wilson's message, but his fingers had typed gibberish across the keyboard. Upon learning Evelyn had gone to the lounge Gregory Wilson recommended, he snapped his laptop shut and stormed out of his office.

Jealousy was secondary. What truly gripped him was Evelyn's worsening morning sickness lately. Foods she'd craved yesterday might revolt her today. Enclosed spaces inevitably made her suffer.

He sped through the streets until spotting that familiar silhouette at the hallway's end. One glance, and his restless heart stilled.

"The lady's private room..." Alexander murmured to a server.

Inside, Olivia Lightfoot was belting into a microphone when Evelyn returned. She immediately set it down. "Sick again? You've barely eaten tonight."

The doctor from earlier looked guilty. "Dr. Carter, let me drive you home?"

"Really, I'm fine." Evelyn forced a smile. "Don't let me ruin the fun."

A server entered. "Ladies and gentlemen, the main lounge is now available for a complimentary upgrade."

"Seriously?" The colleague holding the mic couldn't believe her ears.

Olivia sighed in relief. "Better ventilation there. You'll feel better."

Evelyn nodded, though suspicion prickled her mind. She knew exactly who the "mysterious benefactor" of that private dining room had been. But Alexander had claimed he was working late tonight...

Then she remembered Vincent hastily dragging Gregory away earlier.

In the car at the street corner, Vincent was still typing furiously. Gregory glanced at the rearview mirror at a red light. "Mr. Hamilton must be frantic?"

"Obviously!" Vincent didn't look up. "He's probably already on his way or found Evelyn by now. This time he's really—"

He cut himself off. Provoking Alexander was dangerous, but angering his older brother was equally unwise. Imagining a future of reined-in freedom, his enthusiasm deflated.

The light turned green. Gregory pressed the accelerator gently. "It's a good thing. If you could find your destined person like he did, our parents would rest easier."
###Chapter 896: He Was Always There

Gregory Wilson remained calm, easing Vincent Wilson's worries. "Bro, what about that girl tonight...?"

Gregory had been tricked into a blind date with a family friend's daughter—perfect in every way, yet his heart remained untouched. A single call had summoned Vincent to rescue him.

Vincent saw right through it but couldn't resist pressing further.

The Wilson brothers were polar opposites—one a free spirit, the other steadfast in love. Their elders were beside themselves with frustration.

"She's lovely." Gregory rubbed his temples. "It's my issue. I'll explain to Mom and Dad. You go ahead."

Vincent's eyes lit up. "So I can pursue her?"

Gregory nearly laughed in exasperation.

At the lounge bar, Alexander Hamilton barely caught his breath before slipping into the adjacent café. The window seat offered a clear view of the glass hall where Evelyn Carter and her colleagues gathered.

Though the bar had plenty of empty seats, he kept his distance. Evelyn never said it outright, but he knew she preferred keeping their relationship private at work.

Lunchtime pickups were unavoidable, but after hours, he respected her space.

His phone battery dwindled to 15% with no charger in sight. He flipped through a magazine absently. He could've charged it in the car, but he wanted to stay close—even if she never noticed.

Unbeknownst to him, Evelyn had already spotted him.

The glass hall was bright and spacious, a grand piano tucked in the corner. A musically inclined colleague played an impromptu piece, elevating the lively gathering into something refined.

Evelyn sat near the door, ready to excuse herself. In the glass reflection, she glimpsed Alexander in the café.

Of course it was him.

She sighed softly, but without the expected irritation. Somewhere along the way, she'd grown accustomed to his presence. Strangely, the nausea from her pregnancy seemed to ease whenever she sensed him nearby.

Perhaps this was what security felt like.

The party lasted well into the night. Olivia Lightfoot linked arms with Evelyn. "That was so fun, I won't even need coffee for tomorrow's shift! Let's head out."

Colleagues dispersed in small groups.

At the café, Alexander pretended to read while tracking the lounge bar's movements. The moment Evelyn and Olivia stepped out, he rose—but didn't approach immediately.

Only after they'd walked ahead did he return to his car, using the last of his battery to text: They've left. Let's go home.

Brief and to the point.

Olivia reached for her phone to call a ride, but Evelyn stopped her. "We've got a ride."

"Huh? You didn't drive."

Evelyn pointed to the approaching vehicle. The window lowered, revealing Alexander's sharp profile. He looked perfectly at ease, as if he'd been waiting there all along.

Olivia grinned. "So this is why we got special treatment tonight."

Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips.

With a friend present, Evelyn opted for the backseat with Olivia. Even the seatbelt required extra care now with her pregnancy.

After dropping Olivia off, Alexander asked, "Apartment or the family home?"

"The family home. It's the weekend—time to see the baby and Mom." She wanted to surprise them.

Yet the house stood dark. Neither Margaret Hamilton nor Grace Anderson was home—not even the baby.

Evelyn frowned. "Where could they be? They shouldn't be out this late with the baby."

As Alexander moved to make calls, Evelyn stopped him. "Let me try first."

Margaret's phone rang from between the couch cushions. Hanging up, Alexander glanced at the lit windows next door. "Should we check?"

Teresa Taylor usually retired early—lights on at this hour was unusual.

Evelyn insisted on going together. The door swung open to Anthony Taylor's delighted face. "Perfect timing! Everyone's here!"
###Chapter 897: Fated Connections

Evelyn Carter paused slightly as she stepped into the Anderson family villa.

During her last visit, this luxurious mansion had felt cold and empty like a showroom. Tonight was entirely different—warm golden light spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and faint laughter drifted from inside.

Alexander Hamilton stood beside her, giving her hand a gentle squeeze.

"Uncle Anderson," Evelyn nodded at Andrew Taylor who opened the door, "Sorry to disturb you so late."

Andrew's face still held traces of lingering joy. "Come in! Perfect timing for supper. I caught plenty of fish today—fresh as can be."

Alexander's stomach chose that moment to emit a quiet growl.

Evelyn couldn't suppress a small smile. She knew he'd barely eaten all evening but hadn't complained.

"You came at just the right time," Andrew rubbed his hands together, "So...do you play mahjong?"

A sudden cheer erupted from the side parlor.

"Mahjong!" Margaret Hamilton's voice rang out triumphantly.

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged glances before hurrying toward the sound.

Pushing open the parlor door, the scene before them made both freeze.

The mahjong tiles clattered as the machine shuffled them. Four elders sat around the table—Grace Anderson counting chips while Teresa Taylor handed Margaret tea. But most surprising was Baby Chloe sitting in an antique high chair, clutching half an orange with bright eyes watching the adults play.

That chair...

Evelyn's fingers trembled unconsciously.

"What's wrong?" Alexander murmured.

"This chair..." She stared at the carved patterns, "I think I've seen it before."

Teresa set down her tiles, eyes glistening. "Evelyn...this was yours when you were little."

She walked to a corner cabinet and retrieved a dust-covered photo frame.

The image showed a porcelain-skinned toddler sitting in the same high chair, grinning ear to ear. Behind the chair, a small boy's hand could barely be seen steadying it.

"This is..." Evelyn's throat tightened.

"Your hundredth-day celebration," Teresa's voice was feather-light. "Alexander had just learned to walk. The photographer had him stand behind to support you."

Alexander leaned closer to the photo and suddenly chuckled. "That's definitely my sleeve. Mom always loved dressing me in this bear-embroidered shirt."

Margaret wiped her eyes. "You were so well-behaved that day—no crying, just smiling at the camera. Alexander kept trying to shove toys into your hands."

Grace looked between the photo and Evelyn in astonishment. "You're the spitting image."

Andrew stood beside his wife, fingers tracing the frame's edge. "After you disappeared...we couldn't bear to display these photos. Too painful to look at, and afraid..."

His gaze flickered to Teresa's graying temples, leaving the thought unfinished.

Suddenly Evelyn understood why Teresa had seemed so familiar when they first met. These memories buried by time had always existed—just in another form.

Baby Chloe suddenly babbled excitedly, tiny hands slapping the chair's armrests. Orange juice splattered her rosy cheeks, mirroring the cake-smeared toddler in the photo.

With a decisive click, the mahjong machine began dealing a new round.
###Chapter 898: Caught Between a Rock and a Hard Place

The yellowed photograph lay quietly in its frame, preserving a moment frozen in time over two decades ago.

Anthony Taylor and Teresa Taylor carefully hung it in the most prominent spot of their living room, their fingers trembling slightly. Two porcelain-like children held hands in the picture, their innocent smiles radiant.

"I never knew you two knew each other as children." Teresa's eyes reddened, her voice thick with emotion.

Evelyn Carter stood before the frame, tracing its edges with her fingertips. She'd never imagined her connection with Alexander Hamilton stretched so far back.

Alexander silently brought over an armchair. "Have a seat."

"Thanks." Evelyn snapped out of her reverie. "Weren't you playing mahjong with them?"

"Terrible at it." He gave a wry smile. "With three elders at the table, losing to any would be... complicated."

Evelyn understood immediately. Between Margaret Hamilton, Grace Anderson, and Teresa—each was someone he couldn't afford to offend.

Her gaze returned to the photo. The little girl wore pigtails and a floral dress, her smile brighter than sunshine. Evelyn suddenly thought of the child she'd lost—had she lived, she'd be sitting up or crawling by now.

Noticing her distraction, Alexander slipped away to prepare supper. Anthony had specifically requested fish soup, but the sight of the live fish thrashing in the sink froze the Hamilton heir in place.

In thirty-some years, when had the young master ever butchered a fish?

Taking a deep breath, he donned rubber gloves and raised the cleaver like he'd seen fishmongers do. The tail lashed out, splashing water across his face. Droplets stained his custom shirt and silk tie.

Thwack!

The tail smacked his forearm. Gritting his teeth, Alexander pinned the flailing fish, the blade hovering uncertainly.

"Let me."

Evelyn appeared in the kitchen doorway, faint exasperation in her eyes. She deftly took a long needle and pierced the fish's spine. The struggling ceased instantly.

"Required course in med school." Her tone was clinical. "After animal testing, euthanasia is basic respect."

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed. "Works on all animals?"

"Vertebrates." She sterilized the needle. "Same principle as cervical dislocation."

A chill ran down his spine as he mentally filed away this knowledge.

An hour later, the aroma of fish soup filled the living room. Evelyn sipped from her bowl, warmth spreading through her. Under the wall lamp, Baby Chloe slept soundly with her plush toy, cheeks rosy.

The mahjong tiles had gone quiet. The elders cradled their soup bowls, contentment on their faces. Anthony's eyes grew moist at the heartwarming scene. "The reservoir has even better crucian carp. Next time, we'll take you fishing."

Alexander made a mental note. Crucian carp was excellent for postpartum recovery.
###Chapter 899: A Tougher Heart, A Lower Bar

Night fell, and the Anderson villa was brightly lit.

Everyone was staying overnight. Andrew Anderson had once brought his wife and daughter here as guests, a visit that reconciled the two families and officially united them. The rooms they stayed in on the second floor were still preserved, cleaned weekly by dedicated staff.

Grace Anderson and Margaret Hamilton shared a guest room, where the baby was also taken.

Alexander Hamilton accompanied Evelyn Carter to her room, deliberately making small talk to distract her. But when they passed the door of the room Andrew had once stayed in, Evelyn’s steps noticeably faltered.

If she had noticed her father’s condition earlier, would he still be here?

Her eyes burned suddenly.

Alexander immediately took her hand, silently walking beside her. Pregnant women were prone to mood swings—he ached for her but didn’t know how to comfort her, so he could only offer silent support.

The bedroom had been outfitted with fresh summer bedding, the crisp green color a refreshing sight.

After washing up, Evelyn sat on the edge of the bed. A cool breeze drifted through the open window, carrying just the right chill. The villa was naturally warm in winter and cool in summer, and this bedroom had the best natural light and ventilation in the entire house—even surpassing the master suite where Anthony Taylor and his wife slept.

They were truly making an effort to make up for lost time with their daughter.

Noticing Evelyn’s distant expression, Alexander, who had planned to sleep in the guest room, paused and sat in the chair across from the bed. "If I did anything wrong tonight, just tell me."

"It’s not about you," Evelyn replied calmly.

Her attitude toward him remained detached.

A flicker of disappointment crossed Alexander’s eyes, but he quickly adjusted. "I can keep a secret. If something’s bothering you, you can talk to me."

Evelyn sighed. "I know they genuinely care about me, but I just can’t bring myself to call them 'Mom' and 'Dad.' Especially when my mother is right there... Though I’ve noticed she doesn’t mind."

"Aunt Grace just wants more people to love you. Uncle Anthony and Aunt Lillian won’t force you," Alexander reasoned objectively.

"But I can’t get past it," Evelyn murmured, gazing out the window. The night breeze was gentle—tonight, they didn’t even need the air conditioning.

If she could harden her heart a little more, lower her standards a little more, life might be easier. But then she wouldn’t be Evelyn.

Understanding her nature, Alexander suggested, "Why not try truly merging the two families?"

It was Andrew’s dying wish and Anthony’s hope. Evelyn rested a hand on her slightly rounded belly and finally nodded. "The grudges of the past generation should end. For the baby’s sake, I’m willing to try."

Alexander’s gaze was resolute. "Leave it to me."

"You?" Evelyn raised an eyebrow. This was the man who still refused to commit to marriage.

"Aunt Grace and Aunt Lillian’s birthdays are only three days apart. I want to throw them a joint celebration," Alexander explained, his plan clear. "I’ll have the details ready in two days."

He knew Evelyn was the key, but the older generation’s relationship needed progress too. This time, he would handle it personally—no delegating.

While Alexander buried himself in planning, Evelyn was swamped at the hospital.

A colleague’s joke at last week’s gathering had turned out to be prophetic—this week, patient numbers surged, and emergencies kept cropping up. The most challenging issue was the post-op complications of a lung transplant patient who had given birth.

The premature baby, weakened by the mother’s lung transplant during pregnancy, was still in the incubator—expected. But the mother’s paranoia was escalating.

First, she accused the doctors of inadequate treatment, blaming them for her slow recovery and repeatedly harassing the attending physician. After multiple interruptions, the doctor finally lost patience.

A formal complaint left the attending physician scrambling, and Evelyn, who had assisted in the surgery, became the next target.

"Dr. Carter, you performed my C-section. You saw the transplanted lung, right?" The patient had her husband "invite" Evelyn to the room, then asked anxiously, "Could the donor have had some disease?"

Evelyn had come on her break, but professional ethics kept her lips sealed. "Donor information is confidential, but all transplant organs undergo rigorous screening. Your discomfort is a normal post-op reaction."

The patient grew more agitated. "But lately, I keep feeling short of breath, and my chest hurts terribly. Are you sure it’s not the lung?"
###Chapter 900: His Transformation

"This is quite common." Evelyn Carter closed the medical chart, her voice gentle yet firm. "Many post-operative patients experience similar somatic reactions."

The patient's pale fingers clutched the blanket edge. "But I feel like something's crawling in my lungs..."

"Have you been taking your immunosuppressants on schedule?" Evelyn's gaze swept over the pillbox on the bedside table.

The previously silent husband quickly nodded. "Twice daily, right when the alarm goes off."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Then it's fine. If symptoms persist, you can contact Dr. Porter for a follow-up." As she turned to leave, muffled sobs reached her ears.

"Dr. Carter!" Olivia Lightfoot bounded over like a startled rabbit. "That patient didn't give you trouble, did she?"

Evelyn shook her head, though her brow furrowed slightly. "Her condition is worse than expected."

"Could it actually be medical malpractice?" Olivia gasped. "You and Dr. Porter are the steadiest hands in this hospital!"

The antiseptic scent lingered in the corridor. Evelyn stood before an incubator, fingertips lightly touching the glass. The tiny occupant, no larger than her palm, had a wrinkled face that softened her heart.

"Hang in there, little one," she whispered. A subtle flutter from her own rounded belly answered, like some magical response.

Alexander Hamilton appeared carrying a steaming thermal bag. Evelyn watched him unpack the meal containers before finally speaking. "You really don't need to deliver meals daily."

His elegant fingers paused midair. Sunlight slanted through the window, casting shadows beneath his lashes. "Am I disturbing you?"

The tone reminded Evelyn of a drenched golden retriever. Rubbing her temples, she said, "This hospital's gossip spreads faster than medical records."

Alexander's eyes suddenly brightened. "Then I'll inspect your cafeteria?"

"What?"

"Employee benefits survey," he deadpanned with fabricated seriousness. "Hamilton Group is renovating our staff dining facilities."

Two hours later, Alexander returned looking grave. "Is your hospital facing funding issues?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her water. "We have the most advanced medical equipment in the city!"

"Then why does your cafeteria lack proper ventilation?" His suit cuffs carried cooking oil aromas. "The braised pork could cure jerky, and the stir-fried vegetables taste like lawn clippings."

Evelyn unexpectedly laughed. "That's precisely what patients need. Strong flavors replenish electrolytes, while mild ones soothe stomachs." She scooped congee. "This porridge is perfectly balanced."

Next noon, Henry Lowell delivered the meal box with a mysterious wink. "Mr. Hamilton personally cooked this congee. He's been watching the clay pot since 4 AM."

Lotus seed and lily aromas wafted up when she lifted the lid. Seeing the floating goji berries, Evelyn felt her heart swell as if steeped in warm water.
###Chapter 901: The Perfect Distance

Evelyn Carter had just stepped out of the examination room when she spotted Henry Lowell standing at the end of the hallway, holding a thermal container.

She paused in surprise.

She hadn't seen Alexander's assistant since his last hospital stay.

"Mrs. Hamilton." Henry approached with a bright, sunflower-like smile. "Mr. Hamilton asked me to bring you lunch."

Evelyn accepted the container, her fingertips brushing against the warm edges. "Thank you. But..."

She hesitated.

Henry, however, seemed eager to chat. "You wouldn't believe how different Mr. Hamilton has been since you returned. Last week, when someone from marketing dozed off during a meeting, he just tapped the table as a warning."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "And before?"

"Before?" Henry mimed slitting his throat. "Instant dismissal would've been merciful."

Evelyn glanced down at the container, suddenly feeling its warmth burn her palms.

She'd been deliberately avoiding Hamilton Group to minimize contact with Alexander. Yet here she was, sitting in a hospital, while her influence already spread through his company.

"Maybe he's just in a good mood lately," she deflected.

Henry shook his head. "Absolutely not. The day before yesterday, he was furious—and it was sunny as could be."

Her fingers stilled.

That had been the day she'd refused his offer to drive her.

The food suddenly lost its appeal.

"Mrs. Hamilton?" Henry asked cautiously, noticing her distraction. "Are you alright?"

She forced a smile. "Fine. Please thank Mr. Hamilton for me."

After Henry left, Evelyn sat in her office, staring blankly at the container.

She'd only wanted to avoid burdening him. How had he interpreted that as...?

Her phone vibrated.

A message from Alexander: [How's the food?]

Her fingers hovered over the screen, unmoving.

Meanwhile, in the CEO's office at Hamilton Group...

Alexander frowned at his unresponsive phone.

"Mr. Hamilton," Henry ventured cautiously from across the desk, "Mrs. Hamilton looked well."

"Did she say anything?" Alexander asked without looking up.

Henry shook his head. "No."

Alexander set his phone down and massaged his temples. "You may go."

Once alone, he leaned back in his chair, gaze drifting to the window.

Sunlight streamed in, glinting off the glass walls—just as it had caught in Evelyn's hair that day outside the hospital.

At six that evening, Evelyn packed up to leave.

For once, Alexander wasn't waiting outside her office.

She exhaled in relief—yet couldn't ignore the odd emptiness.

Stepping outside, summer heat rushed to greet her.

She squinted against the glare—then saw the familiar black sedan parked in its usual spot.

The door opened. Alexander approached with a black umbrella.

"It's sunny today," he said softly, tilting the shade toward her.

Evelyn studied their elongated shadows on the pavement and suddenly smiled. "Why didn't you come in today?"

He paused. "This works too."

What he didn't say: This way, she wouldn't worry about colleagues' stares.

Understanding, her lips curved slightly. "It does."

During the drive home, gentle piano music filled the car.

Alexander focused on the road. Evelyn watched the scenery blur past.

Neither spoke, yet the silence felt more comfortable than ever before.

Arriving home, the clatter of mahjong tiles drifted from the neighboring yard.

"Mom's at the Taylors' again," Evelyn sighed, eyeing the lit-up house next door.

Alexander parked. "Is Baby Chloe home?"

"Yes, probably with Peanut."

Inside, giggles echoed from the living room.

Baby Chloe sat astride the Ragdoll cat, tiny fists clutching its tail. Peanut lay defeated, releasing a pitiful "meow" at their arrival.

Alexander swiftly scooped up the child. "Be gentle with Peanut."

The baby waved her arms in protest, babbling incoherently.

Evelyn poured water, noticing Alexander's open laptop displaying an unfinished proposal.

"Working late again?" she asked.

He settled the baby into her high chair. "A project deadline."

Seeing the shadows under his eyes, Evelyn suddenly said, "I'll take a cab to the hospital tomorrow."

He froze. "Why?"

"You're exhausted." She handed him the glass. "And..."

And this distance was better for them both.

As their fingers brushed, both startled at the contact.

"Thanks," he murmured, watching her ears turn pink.

Evelyn looked away. "Don't mention it."

In the living room, Baby Chloe sang off-key. Peanut dozed beneath the sofa.

Cicadas chirped outside.

The perfect distance. The perfect warmth.
###Chapter 902: Him Again

The Hamilton kitchen became the liveliest place since Evelyn's pregnancy. Grace sent over crates of organic goose eggs from her hometown, filling the refrigerator. The Taylors contributed fresh seafood and nutritional supplements, creating a lavish display.

Alexander emerged from the kitchen with a glass of warm water, moving with effortless precision. He navigated the dark room flawlessly without switching on lights.

"Under five minutes." Evelyn checked her watch, lips curving. "The CEO has mastered water-pouring now."

"I—" Before Alexander could respond, an orange blur landed on his shoulder. Peanut's fluffy tail coiled around his neck like a living scarf.

"Papa!" Baby Chloe tugged his pant leg with tiny fists, round obsidian eyes blinking. Her chubby arms reached up demandingly. In her fading memories, Vincent Croix had never existed, and Bianca's presence grew dimmer each day.

She would grow up believing these two radiant figures were her true parents.

Warmth flooded Alexander's chest. Balancing the cat on his shoulder, he knelt gracefully. Straightening his spine, he lifted Chloe to eye level with Peanut.

The Ragdoll leaped nimbly to Evelyn's side, carefully avoiding her rounded belly as it nuzzled her palm.

Evelyn stroked the purring creature without hesitation. Margaret and Grace had suggested temporarily rehoming Peanut, but Alexander came prepared.

"Indoor cats with regular deworming pose no pregnancy risks." He spread printed research across the table. "Peanut's automatic feeder and self-cleaning litter box require zero maintenance."

Scientific evidence instantly eased both mothers' concerns.

As Evelyn shifted positions, a sharp pain shot through her lower back. Alexander reacted instantly—supporting Chloe with one arm while grabbing a cushion to support her spine.

"OB-GYNs need lumbar protection too." His gaze flickered toward her office, already formulating plans.

At the next hospital meeting, Evelyn received two bombshell announcements: office equipment upgrades and cafeteria renovations.

Olivia chewed her pen cap. "The cafeteria was just remodeled last year. Who'd take this money-losing project?"

"The new contractor's touring today," a colleague whispered. "Hospital cafeterias have razor-thin margins. Must be an inside connection."

Evelyn traced her meeting notes, a certain someone's image surfacing in her mind.

"Prices won't increase." Her tone remained light. "The director would veto it first."

Nods rippled through the room. As colleagues filed out laughing, none noticed Evelyn's pensive expression.

Frantic footsteps echoed down the hallway. A nurse sprinted past with Dr. Porter, both faces grim.

Evelyn's pulse jumped. She thrust her files at Olivia. "Go ahead without me."

She arrived at the ward to find the door ajar, sheets tangled. A nearly full bottle of immunosuppressants rolled on the floor—medicine that should've been almost empty.

Pupils contracting, Evelyn snatched the bottle and raced to the ER. Harsh red lights glared as a family member paced outside.

"His last checkup showed stable levels." She feigned casualness. "What triggered this relapse?"

The man avoided eye contact. "He... suddenly couldn't breathe..."
###Chapter 903: His Way of Protecting Her

The lights in the emergency room remained on.

Evelyn Carter stood at the end of the corridor, the sharp scent of antiseptic filling her nostrils. Her fingers absently traced the edges of the medical chart as she watched the restless man shifting on the bench.

"Did you take the immunosuppressants on time?"

The man jerked his head up, his gaze flickering. "O-of course I did."

Evelyn said nothing, simply holding his stare. Under the fluorescent lights, beads of sweat formed at his temples.

"Rejection isn't trivial." She closed the chart. "That donor organ was hard-won."

The man's knuckles whitened as his fists clenched.

Back in her office, Olivia Lightfoot was pacing with her phone in hand.

"Dr. Carter!" She grabbed Evelyn's arm. "It's a disaster!"

The hospital group chat was exploding with messages. Evelyn scanned the screen, her brow furrowing.

—The transplant patient is an influencer
—Her post went viral
—The comments are slaughtering our reputation

Olivia's eyes reddened. "How dare they drag you into this?"

Evelyn gave her shoulder a light pat. "Just keyboard warriors."

She opened the article. Between the lines were veiled accusations against the hospital. The comment section had already escalated to doxxing medical staff.

When Alexander Hamilton arrived to pick her up, the car stereo was playing a soft piano piece.

"The hospital situation?" He muted the music.

Evelyn handed him her phone. "Someone's stirring the pot."

Alexander's eyes darkened as he read. "I'll handle it."

At dawn the next day, whispers buzzed through the nurse station before Evelyn even reached it.

"The article vanished!"
"Even the hashtags are gone!"

Olivia rushed over, breathless. "Dr. Carter! Guess what? That patient's entire account got suspended!"

Evelyn blinked.

She checked her phone. The viral storm from last night had been wiped clean, as if it never existed. Only the hospital group chat remained active, colleagues marveling at the abrupt reversal.

"Rumor says a heavyweight contacted the platform directly..."
"That's terrifying efficiency..."

Evelyn looked out the window. Alexander's black sedan was gliding away through the morning light.

She remembered the certainty in his eyes last night when he'd said, "I'll handle it."
###Chapter 904: The Greed That Knows No Bounds

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she buttoned her white coat, texting Alexander a brief "Got it" in response.

The operating room lights finally dimmed as sunset painted the windows.

Dr. Porter removed his mask, beads of sweat still clinging to his forehead. "Dr. Carter, we owe you for catching that medication error."

Had it been gratitude tied to the Hamilton name, she might have hesitated. But this time, she accepted it with quiet dignity.

"Just doing my job." She pocketed her stethoscope. "I hear I'm on the complaint list?"

Dr. Porter scratched his head, crumpling his coat collar. "My apologies. But the patient's demands..."

His Adam's apple bobbed as he trailed off.

Evelyn waited. When she heard the patient's request for a different lung donor, her brows knitted tight.

"Organ transplants aren't grocery shopping." Her voice turned icy. "Stopping immunosuppressants is playing Russian roulette with her life."

Dr. Porter gave a weary smile. "We've refused three times. She won't give up. Now she's gone to the media to pressure us."

Their shared glance spoke volumes—unshakable resolve mirrored in both pairs of eyes.

By the time the gasping patient was wheeled back, she lacked the strength to protest. Evelyn finished giving post-op instructions and turned toward the OB-GYN wing.

At the corridor's bend, a woman in a baseball cap intercepted her.

"Doctor, I have stomach pains—"

Evelyn eyed the overstuffed bag. "Reporter? Schedule interviews through Administration."

The woman flushed and scurried away.

Her phone buzzed incessantly upon returning. After three missed calls, she silenced it completely.

At lunch, the driver Henry studied her curiously. When Alexander's call reached the dean's office, the secretary nearly spilled her coffee.

"Mr. Hamilton, we're handling the situation—"

Alexander's knuckles rapped his desk, but he resisted pulling media strings. He knew too well how public opinion could backfire.

In the evening car ride, he handed her sparkling water. "Your lips are chapped."

Only then did Evelyn realize she hadn't drunk all day. As cool liquid soothed her throat, Alexander murmured, "For the birthday dinner this weekend, I thought just three close families."

"What about Aunt Margaret..." Her grip tightened on the bottle.

"Mother severed most ties years ago." His tone remained even. "After losing you, she and Father became islanders."

Evelyn's chest constricted. As an expectant mother, she understood that agony more than ever.

The window slid down, letting in spring's floral breeze. Sunset illuminated Alexander's profile with startling clarity. "Sometimes I wonder, if we'd found you sooner—"

Her phone lit up again—"Dean's Office" flashing across the screen.
###Chapter 905 The Expectant Partner

"Your hands are perfect for manicures," Evelyn remarked softly.

Her gaze lingered on Alexander's slender fingers, her tone genuine.

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "Actually, I almost threw up earlier."

Lately, he'd been like this. The slightest discomfort from Evelyn triggered an even stronger reaction in him. It was as if his body had installed sensors, detecting her unease before she even noticed it herself.

"How long has this been going on?" Evelyn frowned slightly.

She turned to study him with focused eyes—her professional demeanor when facing patients. Yet it warmed Alexander's heart.

Accustomed to dealing with female patients, Evelyn always spoke gently. She didn't realize there was anything unusual about her current attitude toward Alexander.

"Since last Monday," Alexander kept his eyes on the road. "The day I had Henry deliver lunch to you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "So skipping meals together has this effect?"

Suspecting he was up to something, she nodded. "Any loss of appetite or dizziness? Then you'd better keep your distance."

Alexander slammed the brakes, barely stopping the car at the roadside. "Is it contagious?"

Their prenatal class was just around the corner. If he really fell ill now, he'd have to watch Evelyn face it alone. The thought made his vision darken.

Evelyn burst into laughter. Only then did Alexander realize she was teasing him.

"It's called couvade syndrome," she explained seriously. "One in four expectant fathers experiences similar symptoms due to anxiety about pregnancy."

"Staying away from me might help. As for contagion..." She chuckled. "We eat together every day. If it were contagious, you'd have caught it by now."

Alexander's heart skipped a beat. The phrase "expectant partner" set off fireworks in his chest. He suppressed his rising smile, afraid she might retract the words.

Even after returning home, the glow in his eyes remained undimmed.

"You seem happy," Margaret pulled him aside. "Did the proposal go well?"

Noticing his own radiant reflection in the glass cabinet, Alexander quickly rubbed his face. "We're celebrating Aunt Grace and Aunt Lin's birthdays this weekend. Could you help pick gifts?"

This diversion tactic never failed.

"Now you tell me!" Margaret immediately got sidetracked, hurrying upstairs. "I need to prepare right away."

Alexander exhaled in relief, carrying a fruit platter back to Evelyn. "My mother's becoming more impatient lately."

Without looking up, Evelyn replied, "Typical menopausal symptoms. Just ensure proper sleep and mood stability."

Alexander fell silent, quietly picking up a navel orange. He meticulously peeled away every strand of pith, his movements as delicate as unwrapping a gift.

These were specially airfreighted for her. Lately Evelyn craved sour flavors but would only eat this particular variety.

"That's enough." Evelyn pushed the plate away. "Did you handle the hospital matter?"

"Yes." Alexander admitted outright. "Those comments were too harsh."

He devoured the remaining orange in two bites, seeds and all.

"What if I really did have issues with that patient?" Evelyn suddenly asked.

"You know how to separate personal from professional," Alexander pinpointed accurately.

Indeed she did. Even embroiled in medical disputes, Evelyn always maintained boundaries. When Olivia wanted to defend her, Evelyn had talked her down.

But she never anticipated how deeply that patient on the bed already hated her—merely too weak to act on it yet.

Alexander asked no further questions. If she didn't volunteer, he wouldn't pry.
###Chapter 906: Newton's Third Law

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, bathing the living room in golden warmth. Baby Chloe sat on the carpet, engrossed with her new toy. Peanut the Ragdoll cat dozed nearby, tail twitching occasionally.

"Meow!" A sharp feline cry shattered the peace.

Chloe had accidentally stepped on Peanut's tail. The cat leaped away instinctively, its fluffy tail brushing against the toddler's bare calf.

The little girl froze. Her eyes welled up instantly, but she stubbornly bit her lower lip, refusing to cry.

Evelyn Carter set down her medical journal and hurried over, kneeling beside her daughter. "Does it hurt?"

"Didn't... mean to," Chloe whispered, tiny fingers twisting nervously.

Alexander Hamilton abandoned his tablet and joined them. Without speaking, he wiped away an escaped tear while Evelyn rubbed soothing circles on their daughter's back.

"Peanut didn't know it was an accident," Evelyn explained gently. "Let's go apologize, okay?"

Nodding, Chloe wobbled toward the corner where the cat had retreated. She crouched down and tentatively stroked Peanut's head, murmuring unintelligible words.

Miraculously, the Ragdoll leaned into the touch, nuzzling the small hand.

Alexander watched thoughtfully. "We should consider finding her some playmates her own age."

Evelyn glanced up. "Preschool?"

"Mm. No matter how clever Peanut is, she can't have conversations or play proper games with Chloe."

Evelyn headed for the stairs. "I'll call the early education center now."

Upstairs in the study, Evelyn dialed the number.

"Mrs. Hamilton! We offer several program options..." The teacher launched into an enthusiastic pitch.

Evelyn selected the basic introductory course, but paused when the teacher added, "Many families enroll siblings together, though balancing attention between two children requires—"

She blinked, realizing the misunderstanding. Then smiled—perhaps this was a fortuitous omen.

After hanging up, Evelyn decided to research early education materials in the first-floor study. Passing through the hallway, she stopped abruptly.

In the living room, Alexander sat cross-legged on the carpet before a roly-poly toy taller than Chloe. Wearing absurd cartoon-print gloves, he demonstrated how to "counterattack."

"Newton's Third Law," he lectured with mock seriousness. "For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. If someone pushes you..."

Chloe mimicked his movements, delivering a featherlight punch to the toy. It wobbled with a soft thump.

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, lips curving unbidden. The domestic scene held her captive—until a jarring ringtone shattered the moment.

Her work phone vibrated violently on the sofa.

Alexander moved to retrieve it just as Evelyn darted through the side entrance. They collided at the couch.

"Olivia's calling," Alexander steadied her, handing over the phone. "Probably urgent."

Evelyn answered immediately. Olivia's panicked voice crackled through: "Dr. Carter! Emergency! Critical OB case just arrived—complicated presentation!"
###Chapter 907: A Thousand Rehearsals of Protection

Evelyn Carter was reading a fairy tale to her unborn baby when Olivia Lightfoot's voice exploded through the phone.

"Dr. Carter! Emergency!"

For Olivia, who had witnessed countless life-and-death situations, to sound this frantic meant real danger. Evelyn snapped the book shut, her fingers already hooking the white coat from the rack.

"I'm on my way." She tucked the phone between her ear and shoulder, buttoning up with practiced efficiency. "Brief me."

"A newborn in the neonatal ward spiked a fever. Clear signs of pulmonary infection, but—" Olivia's voice cracked. "The parents are missing. Even the mother who just gave birth is gone!"

Evelyn's hand froze mid-air. With neonatal infections, every second counted.

"Police notified?" She grabbed her bag and bolted for the door—straight into Alexander Hamilton's chest.

Without a word, he scooped up their toddler from the building blocks and palmed his car keys. "I'll drive."

Three minutes later, the Cullinan's engine roared through the night. Evelyn watched streetlights blur past the window. "Why this car?"

Alexander's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "Keys were in the foyer."

He didn't say the rest—they'd have taken a tank if necessary.

The ER entrance lights stabbed at her eyes. Evelyn didn't notice the phone camera glinting in the shadows as she jumped out.

Olivia clutched her like a lifeline. "Still no trace of the family!"

Chaos erupted down the hallway. Evelyn instantly recognized the lung transplant patient and her husband, screaming at the nurses' station.

"Our child gets ignored while others get treated?" The man's fist slammed the counter, sending charts flying.

The wheelchair-bound woman coughed violently, then speared Evelyn with a glare. "Who's playing angel now?"

Evelyn strode past them, her coat swirling antiseptic air. "This isn't a marketplace."

Silence dropped like a guillotine. Watching his wife's unyielding back, Alexander suddenly understood—this was her battlefield. She needed no backup.

Twelve hours later, the steady beep of monitors marked the end of a medical marathon. Evelyn's scrubs clung to her drenched back.

"Still no leads on the family." A nurse handed her the chart. "The mother gave a fake address at admission."

Evelyn stared at the fragile life in the incubator, gut twisting. She remembered her own day on the operating table—cold instruments, colder choices.

Someone had left a cushioned pad on the hallway bench. As Alexander guided her down, he produced a thermal bag like a magician. "Eat."

The sandwich aroma disoriented her. Evelyn chuckled, crumpling the wrapper. "People might think I just delivered."

"There'll be more than sandwiches when it's time." His thumb brushed the shadows under her eyes. "I've memorized every postpartum meal recipe."

The words were a warm drop melting glacial ice. Evelyn looked up into eyes reflecting ER lights—where nine hundred days of waiting and rehearsals lived.
###Chapter 908: The Iron Tree Blooms

Evelyn Carter wanted to say Alexander Hamilton didn't need to be present for the birth. The words lingered on her tongue before she swallowed them back. She could face it alone, but having someone by her side would make a difference.

"We'll see when the time comes," she finally replied.

Alexander sensed her subdued mood. "Still upset about the abandoned baby?"

He'd already learned the details from the nurses. "I sent people to look for the mother," he offered. Then paused. "But... the chances are slim."

The surveillance footage showed the mother slipping away during lunch break. The contact number on file was disconnected.

"Can your people find any leads?" Evelyn's voice was calm, but disappointment seeped through.

"If she planned this abandonment so meticulously, even if found, she might not want the child." Alexander stated the harsh truth.

Evelyn's fingers absently brushed her slightly rounded belly. She didn't voice the thought—perhaps the orphanage would be better for that baby.

"It's a felony." Alexander handed her a milk carton with the straw already inserted. "The father shares responsibility. Without the mother, we can't identify him."

The warmth from the paper cup seeped into her palms. A realization struck her—no one had the right to decide that child's future. Not even her.

"You're right," she murmured. "Every life deserves to know its origins."

That night, Evelyn chose to stay at a hotel near the hospital. Seeing this, Alexander texted his mother and remained as well.

Margaret Hamilton nearly knocked over her flower vase when the message arrived mid-arrangement. Delighted, she began mentally planning wedding details, oblivious to the real surprise coming her way.

At 6:30 AM, Alexander's phone jarred him awake. He glanced at the still-sleeping Evelyn and padded silently to the living room.

"This better be important." His voice rasped with sleep.

Vincent Wilson's chuckle carried suggestive amusement through the line. "Big bro, you and sis-in-law... making an official announcement?"

Alexander was instantly alert. "Explain."

"Financial section headline—'Hamilton Spotted Accompanying New Flame to Prenatal Checkup at Midnight.'" Vincent lowered his voice. "Blurry photo, but I recognized Evelyn immediately."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Ridiculous. She's a doctor."

"The media's implying worse." Vincent warned. "Calling it 'an old house on fire,' 'iron tree blooming'—"

"Enough." Alexander ended the call abruptly. Turning, he found Evelyn standing in the bedroom doorway.

Her robe loosely tied, hair slightly tousled—clearly just awakened. "What's wrong?"

Meanwhile, at the Wilson estate gates, Vincent stared at his disconnected phone. He collided with Gregory Wilson returning with his Samoyed.

The excited dog lunged forward as Gregory tightened the leash, eyeing his younger brother. "Another breakup?"
###Chapter 909: Not Ready for "Mrs. Hamilton"

"Bro, this time it really wasn't me." Vincent Wilson handed over his phone, displaying a paparazzi shot of Alexander Hamilton and Evelyn Carter entering the hospital together.

Gregory Wilson glanced at the screen, his lips quirking slightly. "Expected."

He stood, clipped the leash onto White Coat's collar, and walked out without another word. Vincent scratched his head as he watched his brother leave—had Gregory moved on or not? If his brother married first, maybe he could enjoy his bachelor life a little longer.

Alexander ended the room service call while Evelyn still slept soundly. He arranged breakfast quietly, the aroma of crab roe dumplings filling the suite.

"Make do with this." He offered her chopsticks just as she finished freshening up.

Evelyn eyed the elaborate spread. "If this is 'making do,' Michelin restaurants should close shop."

"You're pregnant and still working." His gaze dropped to her barely visible bump. "I won't let you endure hardships."

She sipped her congee, steam obscuring her expression. "Eat quickly. You have that morning meeting."

Only at the doorway did Alexander hesitate. "We might need to use the side exit today."

Her fingers paused on her shoelaces. "Trouble again?"

"Got photographed last night." He frowned at the news alert. "Strange—I haven't attended any public events recently."

Evelyn skimmed the article. "Maybe they're targeting me."

She grabbed her bag, but Alexander suddenly loosened his tie. His deft fingers transformed his pristine business attire into disheveled casualwear, even mussing his usually perfect hair into artfully tousled strands.

"You..." Evelyn stifled a laugh at his reflection in the elevator mirror. "Now you look like a celebrity dodging paparazzi."

He froze. She sighed. "Let's leave separately. Your face is too recognizable—just showing up confirms the rumors."

At the parking garage, their hands both reached for the buttons. When their fingers brushed, Alexander jerked back as if burned.

"Go ahead." Evelyn calmly pressed for the lobby.

Before parting, Alexander seemed to wrestle with unspoken words. She waved her phone. "It's only three months. No need to panic."

Turning toward the hospital's side entrance, she paused at the corner. Her palm pressed lightly against her abdomen—though barely showing, her back already ached. At this rate, she'd soon have to step back from surgeries.

A shutter click sounded in the distance. Evelyn whirled around just in time to see a shadow vanish behind the trees.
###Chapter 910: Exposed

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Carter rose carefully, avoiding any noise that might wake her parents in the next room. She inspected her reflection, deliberately choosing a loose white blouse to conceal the subtle curve of her abdomen.

The service road by the hospital's side entrance was quieter than usual. Evelyn avoided the main doors, her heels clicking sharply against the asphalt. She positioned her ID badge prominently—if any reporters approached, they'd immediately recognize her as staff.

The scent of disinfectant hung thick in the changing room. Just as Evelyn fastened the last button of her white coat, a furtive rustling came from outside. Through the door crack, she spotted a woman in a beige trench coat glancing around shiftily.

The third suspicious figure this week.

Evelyn pushed the door open, intentionally dropping her medical chart. "Oops." As she bent to retrieve it, she caught the woman abruptly turning away.

"Need help?" Evelyn straightened with a professional smile.

The woman flustered, adjusting her glasses. "N-no, I'm just... waiting for someone."

"A patient from OB-GYN?" Evelyn pointed to the registration slip in her hand. "The specialist's queue is already at number 32."

The woman's ears flushed crimson. Her grip on the notebook whitened her knuckles. "Actually, I'm—"

"A reporter?" Evelyn finished for her. "Is your department that desperate for gossip?"

The trench-coated woman jerked her head up, eyes wide behind her lenses. "How did you—"

"Lucky guess." Evelyn shrugged. "Last week, a male journalist pretending to have stomach pains wore the same expression when security escorted him out."

The digital screen at the hallway's end displayed the time. Evelyn checked her watch. "I have rounds in twenty minutes. Let's make this quick?"

The woman bit her lip, shoulders slumping in defeat. "I'm Rebecca Watson from the Metro Morning Post lifestyle section. My editor sent me to dig up dirt on Hamilton Group's CEO's fiancée, but I don't even know what she looks like..."

Evelyn's phone buzzed in her coat pocket—a message from Alexander Hamilton asking about lunch preferences. She silenced the screen without reaction.

"Circulation numbers that bad?" Evelyn asked abruptly.

Rebecca blinked. "We had layoffs last year. Veteran staff like me got reassigned to hard news." A bitter laugh escaped her. "I was deputy editor of the finance section before maternity leave."

The examination room's call system activated. Evelyn adjusted her collar. "Here's some advice, Rebecca. Instead of chasing society scandals, write about women struggling to return to work after childbirth." She gestured to the faded ring mark on Rebecca's finger. "You'd understand that story better than anyone."

Rebecca stood frozen. By the time she regained her composure, Evelyn had vanished around the corner. Staring at the scribbled notes in her pad, Rebecca suddenly tore out the page and crumpled it.

On the third floor ward, Evelyn heard rapid footsteps behind her as she reached for a door handle. Rebecca caught up, breathless, holding up a recorder. "Dr. Carter, could you elaborate on your suggestion?"

Outside, plane tree leaves whispered. Studying this disheveled yet determined woman, Evelyn saw a reflection of her possible future. Her hand drifted to her abdomen as she pushed the door open. "Come along during my rounds if you want. But—" She waggled a finger. "Recorder off."

Rebecca fumbled to power it down, eyes suddenly glistening. "Thank you... really."

Evelyn offered no reply. Sunlight spilled through the doorway as she entered the first patient's room, casting her elongated shadow across the floor.
###Chapter 911 The Scandal Storm

Reporter Rebecca Watson's eyes gleamed with shrewdness when Evelyn Carter agreed readily. She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Young lady, wealthy men aren't always reliable. Take that female doctor's boyfriend at your hospital—Alexander Hamilton from Hamilton Group has serious skeletons in his closet."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her coffee cup.

"What kind of skeletons?" Her voice remained steady.

Rebecca glanced around before leaning closer. "We may be a small paper, but our sources are solid. This Mr. Hamilton? Divorced once, engaged twice—to completely different women. His ex-wife got lucky and escaped. The other two? One vanished without a trace, the other's rotting in prison."

Evelyn's fingertip traced the rim of her cup.

Annabelle Taylor, who disappeared. Lydia Laurent, imprisoned. The memories surged like a tidal wave. Her lips pressed into a thin line.

"Shocking, right?" Rebecca patted her hand. "But men like that have nothing to do with ordinary folks like us. Just juicy gossip. I'm here digging for his latest scandal."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Would people even care? I thought everyone's obsessed with young entrepreneurs now."

"You don't understand." Rebecca winked. "The more mysterious the tycoon, the juicier the story. But I'm just shooting my shot—this Mr. Hamilton's become a recluse lately. Even financial reporters can't get near him."

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully.

"Did you see that photo yesterday?" Rebecca suddenly whispered. "Heard some自媒体工作室 caught it purely by chance. Visiting the hospital at midnight—what a lucky break."

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat.

Just then, her phone vibrated in her pocket. Seeing "Alexander Hamilton" on the screen, she hastily excused herself.

"Found her." Alexander's voice was firm through the phone. "The child's mother used fake ID, but we've located her. A sophomore at the local university. Should we call the police?"

Evelyn quickened her steps toward a corridor corner. "How's your situation?"

"Dealt with a few reporters already." A pause. "You okay?"

"I'm fine." She took a deep breath. "Don't alert the police yet. Send me the address. Is she underage? This is more complicated than we thought."

"I'm coming with you." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn halted mid-step. "No need. If you show up again—"

"Relax." He cut in. "No one will recognize me this time."

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn spotted the familiar black sedan at the hospital's side entrance. When she opened the door, she froze.

The man in the driver's seat wore a plain white tee and a black baseball cap, looking a decade younger. If not for those penetrating eyes, she'd have missed him entirely.

"Bought it last minute." Alexander gestured at his outfit. "Reporters think I'm still at the office. Won't expect me like this."

He merged smoothly into traffic. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating his sharp profile. For a fleeting moment, Evelyn remembered how he'd looked when they first met.

"Address sent to your phone." His voice snapped her back. "Girl's name is Su Xiaoyu. Nineteen. Literature major."

Evelyn checked the navigation, then stiffened—a glint flashed in the rearview mirror. She whirled around to see a white sedan tailing them at a steady pace.

"We're being followed," she murmured.

Alexander glanced at the mirror, lips curling coldly. "Hold on."

The black sedan accelerated abruptly, weaving through traffic with precision. After several expert lane changes, the white car was left far behind.

"Guess my disguise wasn't foolproof enough." He chuckled dryly, meeting Evelyn's gaze. "But this confirms we're on the right track."

Her grip tightened on the seatbelt. "You mean..."

"That girl knows something someone doesn't want us to find out." Alexander's eyes turned razor-sharp. "This time, we're getting to the truth."
###Chapter 912 The Great Escape

This escape plan was executed flawlessly.

The reporters staking out nearby remained completely unaware, still believing the driver Henry had left in the car.

According to their intel, Henry drove out punctually every noon, seemingly running errands for Alexander.

Evelyn gazed at the scenery whizzing past the window and sighed softly. "Our peaceful days are over."

A faint smile tugged at Alexander's lips.

These years had never felt light—only by Evelyn's side could he find fleeting tranquility. Hearing her words, an unexpected satisfaction welled up inside him.

Perhaps his care during this period hadn't been entirely inadequate.

As the car entered the campus, Evelyn nearly pushed the door open to jump out. Alexander swiftly grabbed her wrist. "Easy. She's definitely still in the dorm. I've had people watching."

He omitted the surveillance detail, wary of her disapproval.

This vocational college on the outskirts of the university district had shockingly lax security. Alexander expected to be stopped, yet they strolled unchallenged into the female dormitory area.

Glancing down at his attire, he briefly questioned his appearance—had he been mistaken for a delivery guy?

Only upon spotting the waiting bodyguard did he relax. Even the suit-clad security hadn't been stopped—clearly a campus management issue.

Evelyn frowned at the unsecured dormitory building. Memories surfaced: the mountain clinic, the helpless mothers in hospital wards. She exhaled slowly.

Urban suffering often hid in deeper shadows.

Alexander watched her trembling lashes, pretending not to discern her thoughts as he turned to confirm with the bodyguard. "You're certain it's her?"

"Lily Flores, freshman in Business English." The bodyguard lowered his voice. "She's skipped classes for a week. Fortunately, attendance isn't strict here."

The name sent a pang through Evelyn's heart. No wonder she'd given a false name at the hospital—"Flores" carried the blood and tears of countless girls.

Alexander gave a slight nod. "Good work."

The bodyguard understood, bowing respectfully to Evelyn before leaving. "Goodbye, Mrs. Hamilton."

The title made Evelyn's mouth twitch. Once the bodyguard departed, she murmured while climbing the stairs, "Can they use a different form of address?"

A shadow flickered through Alexander's eyes, yet he agreed readily. "Of course."

During their three-year marriage, this title had once unsettled Evelyn for ages. Had he not destroyed everything himself, they wouldn't need to start over.

Preoccupied with thoughts of Lily and the newborn urgently needing signatures, Evelyn missed his shift in mood. One hand cradled her abdomen, the other gripped the railing as they ascended slowly.

The dormitory stood silent at midday on a weekday.

Evelyn paused before the target door and knocked gently. Alexander stepped aside wordlessly.

A weak voice answered from within. "Forgot your key?"

Lily's pale face appeared in the crack. Recognizing Evelyn, she recoiled in panic, nearly slamming the door shut.

"Your baby had a high fever last night," Evelyn said softly.

The door froze mid-swing.

Lily's fingers dug into the wood before finally going slack. "I'm sorry, Dr. Carter..."

"The child needs a guardian's signature." Evelyn kept her tone gentle. "You also need a follow-up exam."

Footsteps echoed in the hallway. Alexander suddenly seized Evelyn's wrist. "Let's talk elsewhere."

His gaze remained fixed on the door crack, wary of Lily lashing out.

Spotting the man, Lily shrank back in fear. The door slammed shut—Evelyn's hand still on the frame.

Alexander's knuckles struck the doorjamb with a dull thud.

"Are your bones alright?" Evelyn immediately inspected his reddening hand.

He shook his head, turning to the trembling girl. "The hospital hasn't called the police yet. There's still time. Even if you don't want this child, at least complete the paperwork."

His calm tone shattered Lily completely. The girl collapsed to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably as her confession poured out.
###Chapter 913 The Child Will Grow Up With Her Mother

Lily Flores huddled in the corner of her dormitory bed, fingers clutching the sheets. It wasn't that she didn't want to keep the baby—but reality had left her with no way out.

"He refuses to acknowledge the child..." Her voice trembled. "If my parents find out I had a baby out of wedlock, they'll beat me to death. Even my little brother will be shamed because of me... Please don't call the police..."

Tears rolled down her gaunt cheeks, soaking the wrinkled hospital gown.

Evelyn Carter glanced at Alexander Hamilton's bloodied hand where Lily had bitten him. "Wait downstairs," she said firmly.

Alexander frowned at the couple canoodling at the end of the hallway but held his tongue.

"It's fine." Evelyn shook her head gently. This girl was too weak to even stand, let alone hurt anyone. And those eyes held nothing but fear and despair.

"I'll wait for you downstairs." Alexander left reluctantly, pausing every few steps before finally standing under the scorching sun, staring up at the window.

The dorm was cramped, with four bunk beds leaving barely any room to move. Lily's bed was a mess, a half-empty water bottle and some stale bread on the nightstand.

"Don't be afraid." Evelyn's voice was as gentle as a spring breeze.

Lily suddenly grabbed her hand, her bony fingers icy cold. "Dr. Carter, I'm not trying to skip out on the bill... I'll pay you back once I find a job..."

"I know." Evelyn squeezed her trembling hand. "Right now, your health and the baby's are what matter most. Even if... even if you eventually decide to give up custody, she still needs to grow up safely first."

Those words were like a key, unlocking Lily's tightly guarded heart. She bit her lip and nodded, tears falling onto their clasped hands.

Evelyn helped her pack a few changes of clothes and left a note for her roommate. By the time they reached the ground floor, Alexander's T-shirt was drenched and clinging to his back.

"I'll get the car." He wiped sweat from his face, his gaze lingering on Lily's pale face for a moment.

The air conditioning in the car was on full blast. By the time they reached the hospital, Alexander's hair was plastered flat from sweat. Evelyn silently handed him her comb, which he took quickly—as if afraid she'd change her mind.

Olivia Lightfoot stormed into the office with a fierce expression, but it vanished the moment she saw Lily.

"I'm sorry, Dr. Lightfoot." Lily kept her head down, her voice barely audible.

"Never mind that," Olivia waved it off. "Let's get you to your room first. Even after a natural delivery, you need three days of observation."

Lily turned to Evelyn, her lips parting.

Evelyn spoke first. "Go see your baby. She misses her mom." Then, lowering her voice, she added, "You're registered as Lily Flores now..."

"I changed it two months ago." Lily suddenly smiled—the first time Evelyn had ever seen her do so. "I was going to steal my household register to get married..."

The smile was faint, but it instantly brought life to her exhausted face.

After they left, Alexander asked, "Should we contact an orphanage?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"Why not?"

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting golden flecks on her lashes. "Because the child will grow up with her mother."
###Chapter 914 Mr. Hamilton and Mrs. Hamilton

Alexander Hamilton frowned slightly, his gaze fixed on Evelyn Carter's face. "Can she really take care of the child? Someone who once abandoned her own baby."

His fingers tapped lightly against the desk, the rhythm betraying his unease. Now that he'd poured all his tenderness into that swaddled infant, his anger toward the irresponsible mother burned fiercely.

Evelyn looked up at him. "People make mistakes. Besides, having a child isn't a one-person responsibility." She paused. "At least she gave the child life. What about that man?"

The boyfriend Lily Flores mentioned had never shown his face. If her impulsive decision to abandon the baby was wrong, the vanished man was the true source of this tragedy.

Alexander's expression faltered, a flicker of regret crossing his eyes. "I wasn't thinking clearly."

Just like how he used to expect Evelyn to always be perfect, forgetting she could grow weary too.

Evelyn didn't press the matter further. She braced her lower back as she slowly sat down—the aches had been coming more frequently lately. The prenatal checkups she should've had kept getting postponed by their constant travels.

Noticing her movement, Alexander stepped closer. "Emily mentioned there's a prenatal yoga class near the office. Evening sessions. Very effective for relieving discomfort."

He recited the details meticulously, even remembering the exact schedule. Evelyn could almost picture the surprised expression on the other end when he'd called to inquire.

"It does help," Evelyn nodded. "I'll check it out after we settle the hospital matters."

She didn't specify when. Didn't mention whether she wanted him to come along.

Alexander's throat moved. "Going alone isn't convenient."

"Can't trouble Vivian—she's swamped lately." Evelyn mentally ran through possible companions before stopping abruptly. "You mean... you'd accompany me?"

The thought hadn't even crossed her mind. With paparazzi potentially lurking and a crowded yoga class, the risk of recognition was too high.

Alexander's gaze remained steady. "If you're willing, I have a solution."

That evening, Evelyn witnessed his "solution."

"Private lessons for prenatal yoga?" She surveyed the freshly arranged yoga room, torn between laughter and exasperation.

They'd cleared out a second-floor room in the Hamilton estate, padding it wall-to-wall with soft mats. The elite instructor beamed. "Mrs. Hamilton is so fortunate. Mr. Hamilton specifically requested one-on-one instruction."

Evelyn didn't correct the title. Explanations would only complicate things—calling them ex-spouses might be mistaken for some couple's game.

Alexander watched her reactions intently throughout. Only when he confirmed her full attention on the lesson did he relax and follow along.

During the pelvic exercises, he stood quietly nearby. The moment her shoelace came loose, he was already on one knee, deft fingers tying it securely.

As the session ended, the instructor reminded cheerfully, "Next week we'll need partner assistance, Mr. Hamilton. Do come on time."

Alexander nodded. He'd already memorized every stretch. For the next six days, he could personally guide her through them.

Perspiration dampened Evelyn's forehead. She wanted to shower, but her legs felt like lead.

"Rest first." Alexander handed her warm water. "Sudden exercise causes muscle soreness."

Kneeling, he gently cradled her ankle to remove the soft-soled shoes. His fingertips brushed her instep—just a fleeting touch that sent shivers dancing across her skin.
###Chapter 915: Twins

Evelyn's yoga socks were damp with sweat, clinging to her swollen ankles. She tried bending down to untie her shoes, but her rounded belly made it impossible.

Alexander knelt on one knee, gently lifting her calf. His warm palms circled her puffy ankles with practiced motions.

"Better?" He looked up.

She nodded, eyelids fluttering at the returning blood flow. As an OB-GYN, she understood pregnancy edema better than anyone. Yet this tenderness still made her heart tremble.

Alone in the yoga studio, she'd be struggling against the wall one-legged. The thought stung her nose.

Reporter Watson's words echoed: Pregnancy tests a marriage—how many couples barely hold on for the baby's sake?

Watching Alexander now felt like another lifetime. In their old mansion, they'd gone weeks without crossing paths. Now even yoga classes had become routine.

He deftly swapped her shoes for soft slippers, then suddenly swept her into his arms.

"I can walk—" Her hands flew to his shoulders.

"Mom started a betting pool downstairs," he murmured, "on when I'll get promoted from probationary husband. Humor me?"

Evelyn chuckled. Margaret's kindness wasn't lost on her. But why was he carrying her around the kitchen?

Until Margaret's relieved sigh floated up: "Finally showing some sense."

That night, Evelyn called Olivia.

"Lily's back?" Her grip tightened on the phone.

"Mm, some family emergency." Olivia sounded sleepy. "The baby's fever broke. I gave them formula—"

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "My test results—"

The line perked up. "First—how was yoga today?"

"Fine." Her pulse quickened. "So the—"

"Twins!" Olivia nearly shouted. "Too small to see before, but two heartbeats now! No wonder your back's been killing you!"

Evelyn clapped a hand over her mouth. Tears blurred her vision as she caressed her belly, as if touching both little lives.

"Could it be...her?" The words barely made it past the lump in her throat.

"Absolutely!" Olivia declared. "They're here to stay this time!"

Evelyn laughed through tears, then hushed: "Don't tell Alexander yet."

"Why not?"

"He'll turn the hospital inside out." She eyed the door, almost seeing him poised to burst through.
###Chapter 916: Mother and Baby Safe, All Is Well

Alexander Hamilton had been wanting to call about Evelyn Carter's prenatal checkup all day, but urgent company matters kept him occupied.

His concern for Evelyn bordered on obsession. If work hadn't demanded his attention, he would've stayed by her side every minute.

Of course, Evelyn would never allow that.

Olivia Lightfoot was prepared when the call came. She cleared her throat. "Don't worry, mother and baby are safe. Everything's normal."

Silence filled the line. Alexander frowned—how could it be "mother and baby" when the child wasn't born yet? He softened his tone. "How's the fetal development? Besides accompanying her to classes, what else can I do?"

He desperately wanted to make up for past neglect, even through small gestures.

"All developmental markers are standard," Olivia answered carefully, avoiding any hint about the twins.

"Could you send me the ultrasound report?" Alexander's voice was tender. "At three months, we should see the outline."

His knowledge of pregnancy surprised Olivia.

"No!" The word escaped before she could stop it.

At three months, the head and limbs were clearly visible. Anyone—let alone someone who'd studied prenatal development—could spot twins immediately.

Alexander's grip tightened on his phone, knuckles whitening. "Is there a problem—"

He couldn't bear to finish the thought. If anything happened to the baby, Evelyn would be devastated.

Olivia realized her mistake and backpedaled. "I swear the baby is healthy! If there were any issues, may I get hit by a car!"

She emphasized "healthy" while avoiding any mention of quantity.

Alexander relaxed slightly. "I just wanted to see our child's first photo."

Olivia tugged at her hair in frustration. Worried he might request the records directly from the hospital director, she improvised: "An ultrasound isn't a real photo! You can take all the pictures you want after birth. Hospital policy, you know how Evelyn hates special privileges."

She adopted a righteous tone. After a pause, Alexander finally conceded. "Alright, I understand."

Hanging up, Olivia exhaled sharply and dialed Evelyn's extension. "I never thought he'd obey you so readily. I should've invoked your name earlier."

Evelyn was reviewing discharge records, phone cradled against her shoulder. "Don't joke. We barely got away with it this time."

She knew the real reason but chose to ignore it. Pregnancy hormones were unpredictable; she had to stay doubly rational.

As her prenatal yoga classes became routine, disaster struck the hospital.

The patient who'd faked medication adherence to secure surgery had died during emergency treatment.

Evelyn, fresh off night shift, snapped to alertness and immediately contacted Dr. Porter from Internal Medicine.

Dr. Porter sounded harried. "Your warning made no difference. The patient pretended to take her meds, even fooling the nurses. Her husband admitted they wanted better lung donor priority."

Worse, the deceased's social media posts were going viral. The Medical Affairs Department scrambled between compensation negotiations and PR damage control.

Evelyn sighed, thinking of the soon-to-retire hospital director. She never imagined this scandal would reach her.

That afternoon, a Medical Affairs colleague hesitated before speaking. "Dr. Carter, you're almost four months along?"

"Approximately."

"Regulations allow early maternity leave..."

Evelyn understood. "Need me to lay low? No problem."

The colleague visibly relaxed, processing the paperwork swiftly. Forcing a smile, Evelyn prepared to leave early.

As she exited the outpatient building, Alexander's familiar figure stood waiting beside his car.
###Chapter 917: Everyone Cares About Her

The scorching sun blazed overhead as Alexander Hamilton approached swiftly, holding a black parasol that cast a steady shade over Evelyn Carter's head.

"Olivia mentioned you'd be leaving work early today," he said in a low voice, his gaze lingering on her slightly pale face.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Did you bribe Olivia to spy on me?"

"She’s just concerned about you." Alexander chuckled, his hand hovering lightly behind her waist. "Like I am."

They walked side by side toward the parking lot. The parasol wasn’t large, leaving half of Alexander’s shoulder exposed to the sun. His shirt soon became damp with sweat. Evelyn noticed and subtly shifted closer to him.

The car’s air conditioning was set to a cool temperature. As soon as Evelyn settled into the back seat, Alexander asked, "Is the temperature comfortable?"

Staring at the scenery flashing by outside the window, she suddenly spoke. "Aren’t you curious about what happened at the hospital?"

Alexander glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "I only want to know if you need help."

Her fingers absently traced the seatbelt. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting delicate shadows on her lashes.

"Let’s talk about it at home," she murmured.

Margaret Hamilton and Grace Anderson were in the living room doing crafts when they saw the couple return early. Their eyes lit up simultaneously.

"Evelyn!" Grace rushed forward, pressing her palm to her daughter’s forehead. "Are you feeling unwell?"

Even Baby Chloe abandoned her toys, toddling over to cling to Evelyn’s leg.

"I’m fine." Evelyn bent down to pick up the child, planting a kiss on her soft cheek. "The dean gave me the day off."

Margaret shot a sharp look at Alexander, who shrugged helplessly.

"Mom, I’d love some of your peanut paste," Evelyn said, deftly changing the subject.

Grace immediately headed for the kitchen. "I’ll make it right now. Go take a warm bath and change into something comfortable."

Margaret took the baby and glared at her son. "What are you standing around for? Go draw Evelyn’s bath!"

Steam filled the bathroom. Standing in front of the wardrobe, Evelyn hesitated—none of her loungewear seemed to fit anymore.

"This one should work," she muttered, pulling out a loose linen dress, only to turn and collide with a solid chest.

Alexander had appeared behind her without a sound, holding a glass of lemon water.

"Be careful not to catch a chill," he said, swiftly wrapping a shawl around her, his gaze carefully restrained as it lingered on her face.

Her ears warmed as she clutched her clothes and retreated into the bathroom. By the time she emerged in her nightgown, Alexander was no longer in the bedroom.

A cup of warm honey water sat on the nightstand, next to a neatly folded thin blanket.

The sweet aroma of peanut paste wafted up from downstairs. Grace immediately served her a full bowl when she descended.

"Take your time. There’s more in the pot."

Evelyn took small sips, the sweet, sticky flavor melting on her tongue. Alexander sat across from her, his gaze tender.

"What would you like for dinner?" Grace asked.

"Mom, are you trying to fatten me up?" Evelyn laughed, shaking her head. "I’ll rest for a bit and eat when I’m hungry."

As she climbed the stairs, she overheard Margaret scolding Alexander in a hushed tone: "You could stand to be more proactive!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together to suppress a smile and quietly closed the door.
###Chapter 918: Love Means Always Feeling Indebted

Grace Anderson noticed Evelyn's exhaustion but said nothing more, retreating to the kitchen. Soon, a neat row of dumplings filled the freezer.

Evelyn dragged her heavy steps upstairs. The moment the door closed, she finally let her guard down. The ache in her lower back made lying flat impossible, forcing her to half-recline against the headboard, hands gently cradling her swollen belly.

The burden of twins arrived earlier and weighed heavier than a single pregnancy.

Soft footsteps approached outside. Alexander Hamilton entered just as she winced while adjusting her position. He moved silently to the bedside, his warm palm pressing against the small of her back with perfect pressure.

Evelyn kept her eyes closed, lashes fluttering faintly. She didn’t need to look to know who it was.

"Thanks," she murmured.

Alexander paused mid-motion, meeting her weary gaze. "This is what I should be doing." His Adam’s apple bobbed. "The babies are ours. I can’t bear this for you, but I can try to make it easier."

Evelyn opened her eyes. "I wasn’t talking about that." A beat. "Did Olivia tell you about the hospital?"

His timing had been too precise, as if prepared.

Alexander’s eyes flickered. He’d never planned to hide it. "The dean did."

Evelyn chuckled. "So the cafeteria contractor and office supply donor was you." She tilted her head. "Why keep it a secret?"

"I worried you’d..." His voice dropped. "Think I was interfering with your work."

His caution softened her heart.

"You underestimate me." A faint smile touched her lips. "I’ve dreamed of upgrading our equipment. The savings from operational costs can finally update our instruments."

Seeing her genuine lack of resentment, Alexander exhaled in relief. "If needed, I can arrange the best legal team—"

"No." Evelyn shook her head. "Medical Affairs will handle it. Dr. Porter and I acted with clear consciences, but outsiders will see it as bullying. As long as my license isn’t revoked, I can accept it."

Her tone was calm, but deep guilt shadowed her eyes.

Alexander saw through her. "It wasn’t your fault."

"I know." Her smile turned bitter. "But I just... can’t stop feeling guilty. If I’d been firmer back then—"

That motherless child had become a thorn in her heart.

Alexander had no words. He wasn’t a doctor; he couldn’t comprehend the professional guilt. All he could do was squeeze her hand, silently sharing his warmth.

No one expected Alexander’s reaction that night to be more intense than Evelyn’s.

She woke at midnight to noises in the bathroom. Pushing the door open, she found Alexander hunched over the sink, retching, his face ghostly pale.

"Stomach acting up?" Her first instinct was to fetch medicine.

He shook his head. "No... suddenly smelled something foul—" Another dry heave cut him off.

Evelyn froze. The symptoms... why did they seem so familiar?

"You don’t have..." Realization struck. "Couvade Syndrome?"

Alexander looked up blankly.

"Basically, when expectant fathers empathize so deeply with their pregnant partners that their bodies mimic pregnancy symptoms," she explained. "It’s not an illness. It’ll pass."

After hearing this, a faint smile broke through his pallor. "So... this is how I get to share what you’re feeling."

Evelyn studied the redness at the corners of his eyes and sighed. "There’s an easy solution—stay away from me."

"No." His refusal was absolute. "I’ll vomit until delivery if I have to."

Watching his stubbornness, Evelyn suddenly understood—perhaps this was love. Willingly bearing even the smallest fraction of another’s pain.
###Chapter 919: Sharing Her Burden

"I think this is perfect," Alexander Hamilton said hoarsely, his intense gaze fixed on Evelyn Carter.

"Other than not being able to carry the baby for you, I'm willing to endure any discomfort on your behalf. Maybe if your hormones affect me, you'll feel better."

He was determined to share the burdens of her pregnancy.

Evelyn realized Alexander's symptoms had become her unexpected comfort. Since he developed couvade syndrome, her own discomfort had noticeably eased. Sometimes, she even found herself reassuring him: "Hang in there. It'll pass soon."

Alexander, pale and weak from vomiting, could only nod faintly.

By the weekend, Evelyn had fully recovered, her mood lighter. While shopping with Vivian Dempsey, she couldn't help but laugh. "I've only read about cases like this in textbooks. Never thought I'd see it firsthand."

"Don't tell me you're thinking of writing a paper about it?" Vivian nearly choked on her boba tea, eyes wide as she gave a thumbs-up.

Evelyn nodded seriously, sipping honey-infused lemon water from her thermos. Her heightened sense of taste made store-bought drinks unbearable.

In the sweltering summer heat, Vivian gulped her iced tea. "If I had your dedication, Dempsey Group would be leading the industry by now. My dad would be over the moon."

"Uncle Dempsey is already proud of you. If you became any more ambitious, he'd be too excited to sleep," Evelyn said sincerely.

When the Dempsey family had faced crisis years ago, Vivian had been a sheltered heiress. That she'd pulled the company back from the brink was nothing short of miraculous.

Vivian beamed, holding up a loose sleep dress against Evelyn. "Keep complimenting me and I'll float away. Try this—bright colors suit your complexion."

Evelyn's fair skin, further protected by Alexander's ever-present parasol, refused to tan. She checked the fabric for allergens before reaching for her wallet.

"You're too casual!" Vivian groaned. "Pregnancy isn't an excuse to settle. This cut is more flattering—it'll still show off your waist."

Evelyn laughed. "At four months, my waist is disappearing. I'll be lucky not to look like a barrel."

The maternity boutique specialized in stylish comfort. Normally indifferent to fashion, Evelyn now needed a wardrobe overhaul. She sighed at her growing bump. "These clothes will be too small in weeks."

"Twins show sooner," Vivian counted on her fingers. "But don't just think about the babies. You deserve to feel beautiful. Enjoy this break—dress up however you want."

Another sigh escaped Evelyn at the thought of her extended leave from the hospital. Even at home, she revised research papers and kept up with medical journals.

"Dr. Carter, I beg you!" Vivian dramatically shook her. "No work talk during girls' day! Let me escape reality!"

"Fine, fine. No more shop talk," Evelyn surrendered with a smile.

Satisfied, Vivian resumed planning. "Lunch, boba, and then a movie! There's a new rom-com—"

Her phone interrupted. Assuming it was work, she grimaced—then lit up at the caller ID.

"Dad's bringing Grandma home!" Hanging up, she danced in place. Raised by her grandmother, Vivian adored the elderly woman.

Evelyn shared her joy. "Is Grandma Dempsey better?"

"The doctors cleared her for convalescence back home." Vivian suddenly gasped. "Oh no—Dad sprung this on me. I need to prepare..."

Evelyn understood. "Go ahead. I'll visit Grandma another time. Since when do we stand on ceremony?"

Vivian snapped her fingers. "I'll call Olivia Lightfoot to join you! The theater's right upstairs—tickets are already bought."
###Chapter 920: Unexpected Invitation

Vivian Dempsey was enthusiastically explaining the movie plot to Evelyn Carter when her fingers moved faster than her brain, swiftly booking two tickets. "The show starts in an hour. There's still time to find someone else to go with you."

"I can call Olivia myself," Evelyn said gently. "You should head back first."

Vivian stubbornly shook her head. "I need to make sure someone's with you." She insisted on waiting until Evelyn finished the call, only to learn Olivia was on night duty.

Vivian bit her lower lip in frustration. This outing had been her idea, yet she was about to leave Evelyn alone. "What about Emily?"

"She has plans with classmates." Evelyn chuckled. "I'm not a child who'll get lost, you know."

"But you're pregnant!" Vivian stomped her foot, then suddenly brightened. "No choice—I'll have to call him."

Before Evelyn could stop her, Vivian had already dialed Alexander Hamilton's number. She tersely explained the situation and hung up immediately, as if hearing his voice for even a second was unbearable.

Evelyn hesitated. She knew Vivian's hostility toward Alexander stemmed entirely from her own past. The words of reconciliation lingered on her tongue but remained unspoken.

Alexander arrived astonishingly fast. Dressed in a minimalist smoke-blue shirt with slightly undone buttons and crisp dress pants, he exuded an aura of restrained elegance, clearly having come straight from the office.

Vivian sternly instructed, "I have an emergency. Evelyn's your responsibility now. If she loses even a single hair, you'll answer to me!"

Alexander naturally stepped to Evelyn's side, taking her thermos. "If anything happens, you can hold me accountable." He paused. "Give my regards to your father and grandmother. Evelyn and I will visit soon."

Vivian raised an eyebrow. She'd only just learned about her grandmother returning for medical treatment, yet Alexander already knew. Remembering his help arranging the private jet, she reluctantly softened her tone. "Thanks for before. I'm leaving."

Before departing, she pulled Evelyn aside for extensive last-minute reminders, her demeanor completely different from moments ago.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh. Once Vivian was gone, she explained to Alexander, "Vivian is actually grateful to you. It's just... best friends are always extra critical of the men in their friend's life."

Alexander's eyes darkened. "Do you really think I'm that petty?"

Evelyn considered seriously. "Remember when Annabelle first returned? You fired several employees. And that time—"

Alexander cleared his throat, swiftly changing the subject. "The movie's starting soon. Let me pay."

Evelyn pressed her lips together to hide a smile, pointing to the shopping bag. "Already taken care of."

Alexander picked up the bag, frowning. "Why so few items?"

"Maternity clothes won't fit for long. These are enough." Evelyn shrugged.

He strode directly to the sales associate. "Wrap up everything except these three sets."

The clerk froze. Alexander handed over a black card. "Leave the purchases here after payment. Someone will collect them." He immediately called his driver Henry to retrieve the items.

Evelyn stared in disbelief. "This is excessive. I couldn't wear them all even changing daily."

"Then change daily." Alexander was dead serious. "If nothing fits, I'll have designers come for custom measurements."

Evelyn recalled the luxury brand designers who'd previously arrived with models in tow and immediately felt a headache coming on. "Absolutely not. I have no interest in haute couture, and it's unsuitable for work. The movie's about to start."

Alexander instantly relented, carefully guiding her onto the escalator before buying popcorn. Had ticket sales not ended, he would've happily bought out the entire theater.
###Chapter 921: Trapped in the Theater

The air conditioning hummed, blowing cold air, yet the enclosed space remained stifling. Alexander Hamilton's gaze lingered on Evelyn Carter's slightly rounded belly. His brow furrowed involuntarily.

The memory of Evelyn vomiting violently in the office last week twisted his heart into knots.

Vivian Dempsey proved herself the ultimate best friend. Not only had she purchased VIP couple tickets, but she'd specifically chosen aisle seats in the back row.

The entire theater was filled with pairs of lovers. The plush leather sofas were generously spaced, offering excellent privacy.

Alexander exhaled silently in relief.

Sinking into the sofa, Evelyn suddenly understood Vivian's thoughtful arrangement. This wasn't about watching a movie—it was about creating an intimate setting. She made a mental note to treat Vivian to an action film next time.

The screen abruptly lit up.

Evelyn looked up and froze. Onscreen, the lead actors were locked in a passionate embrace, their clothes slipping away. Surround sound speakers emitted breathy moans that burned her ears.

She stared at the English title printed on her ticket stub, fingertips turning cold.

Vivian adored romantic dramas, but who could've predicted the uncensored international version? The much-discussed "emotional turning point" online turned out to be an explicit love scene.

Evelyn discreetly scanned their surroundings.

Their seats were disastrously perfect—dead center, surrounded on all sides by couples. Leaving now would require climbing over at least three rows. With her current baby bump, bending low to sneak out was impossible.

Alexander remained perfectly composed.

He wasn't watching the film at all. His attention stayed fixed on Evelyn's profile—wondering about her lipstick's flavor, whether her morning sickness had improved, if they should ask Olivia Lightfoot for another checkup...

"I'm thirsty."

Evelyn's voice cut through the blue-lit darkness, tension lining her jaw. She'd caught Alexander staring at the screen earlier, setting off internal alarms.

The thermal cup reached her hand at the ideal temperature.

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed as he watched her sip carefully. When she finished, he expertly tightened the lid, wiped condensation from the exterior, and returned it precisely to its holder.

Onscreen, the action escalated.

The female lead was pressed against an ornate bedpost, sheer curtains swaying violently. Several couples ahead were already entangled—one girl had even straddled her boyfriend's lap.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

She suddenly elbowed the armrest with a dull thud.

"I think I dropped my phone," she said faintly. "Could you...?"

Alexander immediately knelt to search. He combed through every crevice between seats. Watching the crown of his head, Evelyn's chest tightened inexplicably.

"Maybe I imagined it." She tugged gently at his sleeve.

He rose without hesitation. Just then, the onscreen lovers finally separated, panting beneath tangled sheets. As Evelyn exhaled in relief, unmistakable wet sounds came from the row ahead.

That couple was now kissing deeply. The girl's spaghetti strap had slipped to her elbow, the boy's hand already beneath her blouse.
###Chapter 922: When She's Unfazed, Others Feel the Awkwardness

The couple's theater was dimly lit to perfection.

Evelyn stared at the screen without absorbing a single word. The couple behind them was making too much noise—the wet sounds of their kisses echoed uncomfortably in the quiet auditorium.

Her fingers tightened around the armrest.

"Tissue," she blurted.

Alexander immediately retrieved a travel-sized pack from his suit pocket, even peeling one out for her.

She mechanically wiped her palms, though they weren't sweaty.

Onscreen, the leads kissed passionately in the rain. Behind them, fabric rustled. From the corner of her eye, she saw his Adam's apple bob.

"Is the AC broken?" Her voice sounded brittle.

He tested the vent. "It is warm. Should we move?"

She shook her head. Standing now would only draw more attention.

The scene abruptly cut to a hotel room. The heroine's spaghetti strap slipped—Evelyn choked on air.

Alexander offered his thermos. When their fingers brushed, she recoiled like she'd been burned.

"Let's go." His suggestion came suddenly.

Relief flooded her—until she noticed every other couple tangled in their own worlds. One pair had practically melted into their seats.

She froze.

"I'll lead," he murmured.

She pictured his tall frame eclipsing half the screen, possibly getting them ejected. Gritting her teeth, she sat back down. "Wait a bit longer."

Breathy moans rose from the row behind them. Even in the dark, she saw the tips of his ears redden.

Evelyn forced her gaze forward. The actress now straddled her co-star, their lips locked. She thanked the universe for the darkness.

"This movie—" His voice strained.

"Wasn't my pick," she cut in.

When credits rolled, she sprang up like a jack-in-the-box. Rushing toward the exit, she nearly collided with a soda-bearing usher. Alexander shielded her with one arm while carrying untouched popcorn, his composure unshaken.

Cool air hit her face. She exhaled. "I didn't know it was that kind of film."

He nodded. "Your viewing history leans toward documentaries."

Her head whipped toward him. "How would you—"

"Your tablet's watchlist. And the Blu-rays on your shelf." A pause. "Nature films for insomnia."

Her mouth opened, then closed.

A plush bear suddenly blocked their path, clutching rainbow balloons.

"Congratulations! You've won our family package!" chirped the mascot. "Expecting moms get first pick!"
###Chapter 923: The Gift of Charming Elders

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the toy store, casting golden pools across the colorful displays. A cluster of teddy bear balloons swayed gently in the breeze, their cheerful faces bobbing like childhood memories.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on a particular blue bear balloon. For a fleeting moment, she was six years old again, watching her father walk through the door with yet another whimsical balloon creature.

Andrew Anderson had always found ways to bring magic home, even during lean years. The memory warmed her chest with bittersweet tenderness.

This time, she didn't refuse Alexander's offer. "That one," she said, pointing to the azure bear.

A costumed employee cheerfully handed over the balloon. As Evelyn carefully untangled the ribbon, her fingers brushed against Alexander's knuckles—an accidental touch that sent static dancing up her wrist.

Inside, plush animals of every imaginable variety lined the shelves. Evelyn lifted a backpack-shaped stuffed toy, then froze. Alexander's left hand gripped a thermos and popcorn bucket with whitened knuckles, his fingers strained from maintaining perfect balance.

"Let me." She took the thermos, her fingertips grazing his chilled palm.

Alexander flexed his stiff fingers discreetly before following her deeper into the store. Three plush companions were chosen: a backpack for Baby Chloe, plus bears for Vivian and Emily.

Two days later, outside the Dempsey estate.

Alexander maneuvered the stroller with one hand while carrying gift baskets of tonics with the other. Evelyn cradled Vivian's bear, watching as he knelt to fasten Chloe's tiny shoes.

Grandma Dempsey's eyes lit up when they entered. "What a blessed child," she murmured from her armchair, hands trembling slightly with age.

Vivian accepted her bear with a knowing glance. "Adorable. Where'd you find this?"

Before Evelyn could answer, Alexander lifted Chloe's hand. "Her name's Easy. Would you like to hold her, Grandma?"

The elderly woman hesitated. "These old arms..."

Then a miracle happened. Chloe reached out and grasped Grandma Dempsey's wrinkled finger. Sunlight haloed their intergenerational handclasp—youth and wisdom connected by an invisible thread.

Vivian's eyes glistened. Evelyn quickly steered her upstairs, leaving Alexander to work his magic with the elders.

Behind closed doors, Vivian's composure shattered. Evelyn handed her a tissue. "Seeing Grandma's hands... I thought of Dad too."

Through the window floated Chloe's giggles and Alexander's soothing baritone. Evelyn watched as he animatedly recounted Chloe's first steps to the delighted grandmother, whose laughter seemed to erase years from her face.

Golden light painted the trio below, their shadows merging into one warm silhouette on the hardwood floor. For the first time, Evelyn understood: Alexander Hamilton possessed the rare gift of making elders feel cherished.
###Chapter 924: Who's the Truly Generous One

Tears streamed down Vivian Dempsey's face.

"I feel like I've failed their expectations..." Her voice trembled as she recounted recent events.

"My father never discusses company matters with Grandma. She had no idea the Dempsey Group almost collapsed." She wiped her eyes. "Yesterday she held my hand and said while she hopes I marry, she'd rather see me happy and single forever."

Evelyn Carter knew Mrs. Dempsey was progressive, but this surprised her. "Do you think Grandma... suspects something?"

Vivian shook her head, smudging her mascara.

"I'm not sure. We kept the crisis from her completely, even at the worst moments." She gave a watery smile. "Maybe it's that unspoken bond between family."

The Dempsey Group was Mrs. Dempsey's life's work with her late husband. Her intuition wasn't surprising.

Evelyn gently dabbed Vivian's cheeks with a tissue. "If she asks, tell her the truth. The company isn't fully recovered, but you've done brilliantly. The loans are nearly repaid."

When Vivian's father took his mother abroad for treatment, the company had teetered on bankruptcy. Banks hounded them daily, certain Vivian would flee. No one expected her to persevere.

Vivian took a steadying breath. "Looking back, it feels like another lifetime. You're right—I've nothing to be ashamed of. If Grandma asks, I'll explain everything. She might even have advice."

Her mood shifted rapidly, tears replaced by sparkling curiosity. "So... how was the movie? I haven't had time to see it."

Evelyn's temple throbbed at the memory. "Avoid the couples' theater."

"Why?" Vivian leaned in eagerly.

Evelyn described the incident with clinical detachment before concluding, "I wanted to remind those couples the theater has night-vision cameras."

Rumors claimed cinema surveillance captured everything, even in darkness.

Vivian's eyes widened. "That wild?"

"Wild enough to make me want to vanish. I'd rather risk questionable hygiene at a private cinema." Only with her best friend would Evelyn voice such thoughts.

Vivian bit her lip. "Did you two... you know..."

She made an exaggerated kissing noise while miming an embrace.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, swatting her hand away. "Had that happened, would I have allowed him to come? I said we're maintaining boundaries. One overstep, and I'm taking our child elsewhere."

Hudson City offered endless options—new apartments, different neighborhoods, even other cities.

True to her word, Evelyn kept Alexander Hamilton at arm's length. Beyond attentive care, he dared not cross the line.

Seeing her resolve, Vivian dropped the teasing. "Good. Alexander used to look at you like a starved wolf eyeing prey—ready to drag you to his den." The crude analogy was uncomfortably accurate.

Evelyn choked on laughter. "Since when am I meat? He's been impeccably behaved lately—separate bedrooms unless tending to the baby, separate blankets when sharing a bed."

Their conversations revolved around nursery designs and parenting tips. Evelyn maintained a dedicated memo for these discussions.

Vivian scanned the notes with admiration. "He's shockingly invested in parenting. But if men's promises were reliable, pigs would fly." She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Either he's faking, or..."

Her whisper made Evelyn snort. Years in obstetrics plus marriage gave her zero prudishness. "No urology consult needed. All systems were functional." She added dryly, "As of four months ago."

"Your professional detachment is showing!" Vivian groaned before launching into unsolicited advice. "Functionality isn't enough. After how he wronged you—and with no basis for comparison—you deserve better. Younger men outperform those past thirty."

Though inexperienced, Vivian moved in social circles ripe with gossip. "At last month's gala, someone mentioned a brand heir discovered his 'son' wasn't biological. The man dumped his age-appropriate wife—who'd gotten sterilized per their childfree pact—to marry some twenty-something."

Evelyn gasped. "The ex-wife warned him after the divorce settlement? That's astonishing grace after such betrayal."

Vivian threw up her hands. "Everyone praises her 'magnanimity'—except you should! Your divorce reaction was the epitome of grace. Remembering that bastard still makes me want to dismember him!"
###Chapter 925: The Test of Conscience

"Let's talk about something else first." Evelyn Carter took a sip of tea, deftly changing the subject. "As for him and me... let's leave it at that. I'm more curious about how that ex-wife warned her former husband."

Vivian Dempsey immediately perked up. "She exposed all his dirty laundry and held up a mirror to his face—literally asked him to see what he had that was worth coveting."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips, but shadows flickered in her eyes. Her fingers absently traced the rim of her teacup as thoughts of her postponed work surfaced.

"That wasn't a warning. It was the last straw. After forty, a man's physical decline is inevitable. At the hospital, I've seen too many women forced into IVF because their husbands' sperm motility was too low."

In matters of reproduction, women always bear the greater burden. Yet even basic consideration is rare—whether a partner shares responsibility depends entirely on their conscience.

Vivian's anecdote sounded amusing at first, but its underlying cruelty soon became apparent.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her voice barely above a whisper. "I hope that ex-wife finds happiness. Some people aren't worth holding onto."

Just as Vivian was about to respond, inspiration struck. "Wait—by that logic, wouldn't the guy downstairs also be... past his prime?"

Her nicknames for Alexander Hamilton were always situational. In good moods, she might call him "Mr. Hamilton." Otherwise, euphemisms sufficed.

Evelyn shook her head ruefully. "I know this might sound harsh, but professionally, he's impeccable. If people thought you had issues with him, it wouldn't reflect well on you."

Vivian blinked, instinctively deflecting blame onto Alexander. "He wouldn't... hold a grudge over something this petty, right?"

Then the rumors about Alexander resurfaced in her mind—how he'd ruthlessly bankrupted multiple competitors. Whispers said one rival who tried underhanded tactics ended up fleeing overseas to escape creditors.

Evelyn's gaze was steady, weighted with quiet gravity.

A delayed shiver ran down Vivian's spine before confusion set in. "Honestly, I almost forgot what he's really like. The weirdest part? Around you, he becomes a completely different person."

"Without your reminder, I'd have totally misjudged him. You'd better keep your guard up—what if this nice act is just a facade? Once he wins you back, the real him might reappear!"

Evelyn's fingers stilled. Her concern wasn't about Alexander pretending—she remembered all too well when he'd worn masks before. "I've already seen his true colors."

"Remember what I told you when I decided to divorce? That devastation wasn't just about being his second choice. It was realizing I'd shared a bed for three years with a stranger."

"So what!" Vivian immediately jumped to her defense. "He didn't understand you either, did he?" Worried she'd upset Evelyn, she hastily changed topics. "Don't worry about me. Worst case, I'll just be polite to him."

Tonight, Alexander was technically the Dempseys' guest. With her father and grandmother present, Vivian had to maintain appearances, however grudgingly.

Seeing her friend's selective hearing, Evelyn could only sigh. Lately, her mind had been heavy enough without adding conflicts among loved ones.

Alexander, attuned to Evelyn's unspoken cues, behaved impeccably at the Dempseys', the picture of a model husband.

Mr. Dempsey couldn't help remarking, "Mr. Hamilton, if you know any suitable young men, perhaps you could introduce them to Vivian. I've given up trying to manage her—maybe her friends can help."

Vivian choked on her juice. "Dad! Grandma already said times have changed." She'd sooner die than admit friendship with Alexander, let alone entertain matchmaking horrors.

Alexander had zero interest in playing matchmaker. Every eligible bachelor he knew was marriage-averse. Vincent Wilson's family was pressuring him, but Alexander wasn't foolish enough to pair Evelyn's best friend with a playboy.

Grandma Dempsey, bouncing the baby on her knee, rapped her son's knuckles with chopsticks. "Stop nagging! Is this how fathers act nowadays? Since you're back, you should handle company matters."

Mr. Dempsey placatingly served her vinegar-pepper fish. "My mistake—I won't bring it up again. Mom, try this fish."

The Dempseys had deep roots in the capital, and Grandma particularly missed hometown flavors. One bite earned a satisfied nod. "This tastes authentic. Those greasy fried fish abroad made me sick just looking at them."

Having studied in England, Evelyn empathized. "Even healthy people can't stomach too much fried fish, let alone you. Studying there forced me to become a decent cook."

The two chatted amiably. Evelyn subtly winked at Vivian: crisis averted.

Vivian had just relaxed when Grandma suddenly asked, "By the way, did the housekeeper buy fish today?"

The housekeeper had shopped according to Vivian's preferences—clearly, no fish had been purchased.

Grudgingly, Vivian pointed at Alexander. "He brought it."
###Chapter 926: Making a Mountain Out of a Molehill

"Grandma Dempsey" was certainly more polite than "old lady," though the tone remained as stiff as a formal report.

Evelyn Carter exhaled quietly in relief.

Alexander Hamilton appeared unperturbed. "I heard fish is good for elderly health. We happened to have fresh catch at home, so I brought one."

He slid the fish toward Grandma Dempsey as he spoke.

Before leaving, Evelyn had intended to prepare the gift herself, but her growing baby bump made even bending difficult. Seeing her discomfort, Alexander had taken charge—though in their haste, he hadn't specified what he'd chosen.

"This fish is incredibly fresh!" Grandma Dempsey praised enthusiastically.

Uncle Dempsey, hearing his mother's approval, immediately inquired about its origin. Learning it was caught by Anthony Taylor, he noted the reservoir location for a future fishing trip.

Vivian Dempsey groaned, leaning toward Evelyn. "There goes my vacation."

"You're still thinking about work projects—clearly not eager for time off," Evelyn teased with a smile. As she reached for the fish, she found a deboned portion already in her bowl.

Even the peppercorns and chili threads had been meticulously removed.

Alexander paused mid-shrimp peeling. "Something wrong? Feeling unwell?"

His concern wasn't unwarranted. Evelyn's pregnancy cravings had become unpredictable—dishes she craved at noon might revolt her by evening.

Take bell peppers: two days prior, she'd suddenly yearned for shredded pork with peppers, only to reject the peppers entirely within two meals—demanding the pork retain their flavor without actual contact.

Grace Anderson had fretted over this until Alexander stepped in, painstakingly removing every pepper strand.

The memory warmed Evelyn's heart. "It's nothing. I just didn't expect you'd remember about the peppercorns."

An offhand remark he'd committed to memory.

That evening, Alexander proposed to Grace: "Let me handle lunch tomorrow."

"You know how to make vinegar-pepper fish?" Grace eyed him skeptically. This northern dish wasn't even in her culinary repertoire.

"No, but I'll learn." He'd already considered alternatives. "If needed, I'll consult the Dempseys' housekeeper."

His dedication softened Grace's expression. "You've been working hard lately."

Ever since Alexander shouldered blame for "not wanting marriage," she'd held reservations. Only witnessing his meticulous care for Evelyn had gradually shifted her perspective.

"Of course." His reply held quiet certainty.

Late that night, as Evelyn washed up upstairs and Baby Chloe slept soundly, Grace descended for water, meeting them upon their return.

"How were the Dempseys?" She hesitated. "Evelyn may seem aloof, but she remembers every kindness."

Alexander answered earnestly: "Grandma Dempsey's recovering well, though she'll need a wheelchair temporarily. Uncle Dempsey looks weary, but he's hiring caregivers after returning home."

The kitchen held only the occasional splash from the fish tank's occupant.

After a pause, Grace voiced her lingering question: "How are things... with Mr. Taylor's family?"

This year's upheavals had rewritten countless relationships.

Surprised by the mention of Evelyn's birth parents, Alexander responded honestly: "Unchanged."

"And Evelyn... toward them?" Grace's whisper barely carried.
###Chapter 927: Between a Rock and a Hard Place

The question burned like a hot potato in Alexander Hamilton's hands. Neither accepting nor rejecting it felt right. Standing between the two families, one wrong move could alienate everyone Evelyn Carter held dear.

After careful consideration, he chose honesty. "In Evelyn's heart, you'll always be her only mother. Blood ties matter, but twenty years of nurturing can't be easily replaced."

His words rang sincere. Alexander understood better than anyone how Evelyn's wounded heart now resembled a tightly shut clam—only actions could prove his sincerity.

Grace Anderson's eyes glistened. "I knew you'd understand her. Evelyn treasures relationships deeply. Though she never says it aloud, she remembers every visit and gift from the Taylors these past days."

She never feared Evelyn would distance herself. Her words simply wished for her daughter to receive more love.

Alexander marveled at this selfless maternal love. Without such a family, Evelyn wouldn't have grown into this resilient yet gentle woman.

"Mr. Taylor carries immense guilt. They'd never blame Evelyn for keeping her distance," he carefully sidestepped the blood relation topic.

Grace surprised him by proposing, "Could you help bridge the gap between Evelyn and them? Seeing Teresa Taylor's sadness weighs on me."

Alexander's pulse quickened. Asking Evelyn to call Teresa "Mom"? This was dancing on knife's edge—success meant harmony; failure meant permanent exile from Evelyn's heart.

"I'll try," he heard himself say.

The next morning, Alexander knocked on the Taylors' door.

"Mr. Taylor, Peanut killed all our fish. Evelyn suddenly craves vinegar-pepper fish..."

Anthony Taylor looked puzzled. "Weren't there three yesterday?"

"We took one to the Dempseys. Peanut destroyed the other two," Alexander said without blinking. In truth, he'd personally dispatched those fish—now resting in Peanut's bowl.

By noon, an unprecedented scene unfolded—three families gathered around the Hamilton dining table.

Grace gasped at the feast. "When you said you'd learn to cook vinegar-pepper fish last night, I expected three dishes at most."

Evelyn, well-rested and glowing, finally understood—this stemmed from her offhand remark at the Dempseys.

"You didn't have to go through such trouble..." She glanced at Peanut sunbathing by the window. "Since when does Peanut hunt fish?"

Alexander remained composed. "Surprised me too."

Evelyn's lips quirked. "Perhaps more walks are needed. I hear energetic cats destroy homes."

As Alexander inwardly groaned, Teresa smoothly interjected, "The garden should suffice. Too many bugs outside."
###Chapter 928: The Weight of Gossip

Qin Xiaoyue's fingers wove intricate seals as her dark hair whipped in the wind.

"By the power of all living souls—merge with me!"

A radiant dao blossom unfurled above her, its brilliance illuminating the heavens.

Ancient Evergreen's crimson pupils flared. The phantom hand of his Profane Avatar materialized midair, crushing the celestial flower to dust.

Blood sprayed from Qin Xiaoyue's lips as she plummeted like a broken kite.

Spectating cultivators gasped in unison.

A lone warrior challenging the world—unstoppable, unyielding.

This was the true bearing of a sovereign.

The Dragon Subduing Spear spun violently in Ancient Evergreen's grip, its bloody aura flickering like tongues of flame.

"Begone!"

The crimson lance tore through space, aimed straight at Dreamli's heart.

Her porcelain face drained of color, yet she stood firm.

Retreat was not an option.

Only her Jade Marrow Bones could purify Ancient Evergreen's corruption.

"My love..."

The whisper trembled with unshed tears.

She'd known of his Bloodfiend Constitution since their parting at the Alchemy Convention—and followed him regardless.

Even now, she had no regrets.

Meng Yizui's eyes nearly burst from their sockets. His worst nightmare was unfolding before him.

The spear tip pierced skin. A crimson bead welled up.

At the fatal moment, a figure materialized before Dreamli.

Clang!

The metallic collision reverberated across the battlefield.

Chu Yunmo gripped the bloodstained spearhead single-handedly, scarlet droplets pattering from his palm.

"It's Chu Yunmo!"

"He intercepted the Sovereign's strike?"

The crowd erupted in disbelief.

Through tear-blurred vision, Dreamli studied the achingly familiar stranger.

Chu Yunmo's features shimmered, resolving into Ancient Evergreen's exact likeness.

"My love..."

Her trembling fingers closed around his bleeding hand.

The avatar gently brushed her cheek. "I transferred a soul fragment here. My true self still battles the Annihilation Will."

His gaze shifted to Xiao. "Get them to safety."

Before the words faded, the Corrupt Soul's true form descended like a meteor.

Chu Yunmo sent Dreamli flying to safety with one palm while pivoting to meet the attack.

Boom!

Their fists collided, unleashing a shockwave that sent billions of cultivators scrambling back under their leaders' protection.

"Since when could Chu Yunmo fight like this?"

"They're two halves of the same whole!"

Meng Yizui's eyes widened in epiphany. "So that's why..."

High above, the doppelgangers clashed with terrifying ferocity.

Blood mist and lightning seas divided the sky.

The Dragon Subduing Spear and Immortal-Shattering Arrow crossed paths midair—only to repeatedly switch allegiances.

The two divine artifacts oscillated between their masters, locking the battle in stalemate.

Ancient Evergreen and his avatar locked eyes across the battlefield, identical frustration flashing in their gazes.

This was the most infuriating fight imaginable.
###Chapter 929: A Series of Surprises

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling the asphalt road. Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton walked side by side along the tree-lined path toward home. A gentle breeze stirred the loose strands of hair framing her forehead.

As they passed a convenience store, Evelyn's gaze lingered on a little girl licking an ice cream cone. The sight transported her back to childhood summers.

Alexander abruptly stopped and turned toward the store. Before Evelyn could speak, he disappeared behind the glass door.

Five minutes later, he returned with a vanilla cone, carefully wrapped in a napkin before handing it to her.

"How did you know I wanted this?" She accepted the treat, her fingertips brushing against his warm palm.

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "You stared at that girl for three full seconds."

The ice cream melted quickly under the scorching sun. After just two bites, a drop of cream landed on Evelyn's pastel dress.

"Oh no." She froze, staring at the spreading stain.

Alexander immediately pulled out his handkerchief, but it was too late. Evelyn's obsessive cleanliness left her paralyzed in place.

"Let's go home." He decisively wrapped an arm around her shoulders and quickened their pace.

At the villa, Grace Anderson and Margaret Hamilton were arranging flowers in the living room. Before they could greet the returning couple, Evelyn rushed upstairs.

"What happened?" Margaret asked in confusion.

"Ice cream stain," Alexander explained briefly before following his wife.

The sound of running water came from the bathroom. Standing outside the door, Alexander heard a muffled groan.

"Evelyn?" He knocked.

No response.

He knocked again, firmer this time. "Are you okay?"

A faint gasp mixed with the running water. Alexander's chest tightened as he pushed the door open.

Through the steam, he saw Evelyn gripping the edge of the bathtub, her face pale. Water droplets fell from her hair, creating tiny splashes on the tiles.

"Don't come in!" She frantically reached for a towel, only to have it snag on a hook in her haste.

Alexander crossed the room in three strides and turned off the shower. Without glancing elsewhere, he retrieved the towel and wrapped it securely around her.

"Can you walk?" His voice sounded rough.

Evelyn shook her head, the cramping pain in her abdomen stealing her voice.

Alexander scooped her into his arms. Water trailed behind them, leaving damp footprints from the bathroom to the bedroom.

The sheets grew damp where they touched. Alexander fetched a dry towel and gently blotted her wet hair.

"I'll call the doctor." He turned to leave.

Evelyn caught his sleeve. "No need. The baby just kicked really hard."

Only then did Alexander notice the subtle movements beneath her rounded belly. Kneeling beside the bed, he carefully placed his hand over the spot.

A strong kick responded against his palm.

"They're energetic," he murmured, his tone completely different from his earlier urgency.

Watching his focused profile, Evelyn suddenly found their earlier embarrassment insignificant. She reached up to brush aside the damp strands clinging to his forehead.

"Your shirt is soaked too."

Alexander only then realized his dress shirt was dripping. As he moved to change, Evelyn caught his hand.

"Wait." She pointed to the nightstand. "Call Olivia first."

Understanding immediately, Alexander dialed the number. Olivia Lightfoot's tense voice came through: "Is Dr. Carter alright?"

"She had abdominal pain," Alexander summarized concisely.

Olivia exhaled in relief. "Strong fetal movement is normal during the second trimester, but she should rest. Also, the ice cream—"

"My oversight," Alexander admitted, watching Evelyn's flushed cheeks with self-reproach.

After hanging up, silence settled over the room. Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting dappled patterns on the floor.

Evelyn peeked out from the blankets. "Today was really..."

"My fault," Alexander interrupted. "Next time I'll bring a cooler bag."

Evelyn couldn't help laughing. "Are you opening a mobile concession stand?"

Their laughter dissolved the lingering awkwardness. Alexander leaned down to press a light kiss to her forehead. "I'll change, then make you ginger tea."

As he turned, Evelyn noticed how his soaked shirt clung to his back, outlining defined muscles.

She quickly buried her face in the blankets. This chain of unexpected events would likely become one of her most unforgettable memories.
###Chapter 930: I Never Dare to Slack Off When It Comes to You

Evelyn Carter had always believed herself to be strong.

Those sleepless nights she endured alone, those hardships she gritted her teeth through—they all proved she didn’t need anyone.

But pregnancy had shown her that some things couldn’t be overcome by sheer willpower.

Like the sudden, sharp pain that had struck her in the bathroom moments ago.

Her hand instinctively braced against the wall, but she still slipped.

The slippers were the same, but her swollen feet no longer fit.

As an OB-GYN, she knew these symptoms well.

Yet this was the first time she truly felt powerless.

"Don’t move."

Alexander Hamilton’s voice was suddenly beside her.

She hadn’t noticed him appearing at the bathroom door, a towel in hand.

Gently, he wrapped it around her.

The hum of the hairdryer filled the bedroom.

Evelyn sat on the edge of the bed, feeling the warm air weave through her hair.

Alexander’s fingers moved carefully through her damp strands, as if handling something fragile.

"Discomfort during pregnancy is normal," she said, trying to break the silence as she shifted slightly away.

Alexander only gave a quiet "Mm," his gaze fixed on her hair.

Even with her wrapped only in a towel, her skin exposed, his eyes never strayed.

Evelyn suddenly remembered Vivian Dempsey’s words.

Could it be true?

Was he really... unable to?

The memory of that night four months ago surfaced.

If not for that bottle of deer blood wine, she’d still be working night shifts at the hospital.

Who could’ve guessed one drink would lead to this?

The blackout curtains were drawn shut.

Ever since he noticed her sensitivity to light during naps, Alexander had immediately replaced them.

Such meticulous attention almost made her believe in illusions.

But she knew better than anyone—some wounds never heal.

The birthday celebration was held on the Anderson family terrace.

Alexander had arranged every detail flawlessly—from the lavender balloons Grace Anderson loved, to the champagne-colored tablecloths Teresa Taylor preferred.

Even the placement of the silverware was precise.

"Sis, come take pictures!" Emily Anderson waved excitedly.

She was busy arranging gifts into a heart shape, the two mothers standing in the center with gentle smiles.

Watching the warm scene, Evelyn murmured to Vivian beside her, "I didn’t expect him to put in so much effort..."

"I never dare to slack off when it comes to you."

The deep voice came from her other side.

Evelyn turned sharply to find Alexander where Vivian had been standing moments ago.

A faint smile played on his lips, but his gaze was serious.

"Where’s Vivian?"

"Over there." He pointed to the lawn.

Vivian was chasing a ball with Baby Chloe, laughing like a child.

Evelyn shook her head, not noticing it was Alexander who’d sent the baby to call Vivian over.

Before the cake cutting, Henry Lowell hurried over with two gift boxes.

Alexander handed them to Evelyn. "Want to take a look now?"

"Aren’t these for Mom?"

"Wasn’t sure they’d arrive in time, so I didn’t mention it earlier." His eyes held quiet anticipation. "It’s not too late now."

Puzzled, Evelyn opened the boxes.

Inside lay two photo albums.

The first page held her earliest childhood photo in the Anderson home.
###Chapter 931: Blood Ties

Evelyn's fingertips brushed the photo album's cover, and she immediately sensed something unusual.

The yellowed edges of the photographs bore the marks of time, yet the paper itself felt unnaturally crisp and new.

Her head snapped up as she locked eyes with Alexander.

The man stood at the edge of light and shadow, his dark gaze fixed on her, silently awaiting her reaction.

Pages flipped rapidly beneath her fingers.

Each spread captured pivotal moments of Evelyn's life as the Andersons' daughter—her nervous expression cradling newborn Emily, the family's beaming faces at her middle school graduation, the celebratory portrait when her college acceptance letter arrived.

Memories flickered through her mind like a spinning zoetrope.

The second album felt noticeably lighter.

Evelyn hesitated three seconds before opening it.

Images showed a toddler's first steps, a pigtailed preschooler, finally freezing at a first-grade orientation photo. Blank pages dominated the remainder.

"This is..."

Her throat tightened as she recognized her childhood self.

Alexander wordlessly offered a tissue. "Your eyes are red."

She ignored it, gripping his wrist instead. "When did you prepare these?"

"Started collecting the day we learned the truth." His warm hand closed over her chilled fingers. "Some came from the old estate. Others were recovered negatives from local photo studios."

Teresa's hands trembled violently as she accepted the album.

Twenty-plus years of absence cut like blades, each photograph reopening old wounds. Only when Evelyn embraced her did the long-suppressed word escape: "Mom."

"I'm so sorry..." Teresa's voice shattered. "I missed so much of your life..."

Anthony pulled his weeping wife close, his own eyes glistening.

Nearby, Grace chuckled while tracing a childhood photo. "Your father nearly dismantled our closet hiding this album."

Emily pointed at one image. "See? You cried even more than I did."

"Liar." Evelyn reached for her sister's ear, but Emily dodged with a laugh.

Alexander discreetly captured the moment.

A minor debate arose during the family portrait.

"Evelyn should stand center," both mothers insisted simultaneously.

As she began protesting, the baby in her arms grabbed her collar with a delighted coo. Laughter erupted, and she naturally assumed the central position.

"Three, two, one—"

The shutter clicked just as Evelyn turned her head.

Grace and Teresa flanked her with linked arms while Emily flashed her signature peace sign behind them. Alexander stood at the periphery, his gaze never leaving her.

Like spring reviving withered branches, every lost year had been tenderly reclaimed.

Anthony gasped while reviewing the shots. "This candid one's perfect! Look how naturally Evelyn's smiling."

The image showed her gently wiping the baby's drool, her entire expression softened with affection. Behind her, Alexander's adoring gaze could have melted glaciers.

"I'm enlarging this for our living room," Teresa declared, unable to put the photo down.

Evelyn responded without thinking: "Whatever makes you happy, Mom and Dad."

She froze at her own words.

All her lingering doubts had quietly dissolved beneath her family's warm regard. Like dormant seeds finally breaking through winter soil.
###Chapter 932: Mrs. Hamilton Scheduled You a Urology Appointment

Anthony Taylor and Teresa Taylor froze simultaneously.

They exchanged glances, seeing mutual disbelief reflected in each other's eyes.

"Evelyn..." Teresa's lips trembled as her eyes instantly reddened.

Anthony's fingers shook with barely contained emotion. "Did you just...call us Mom and Dad?"

Evelyn Carter felt an unexpected pang in her chest at their cautious expressions.

She lowered her head, flipping open the photo album to slide in freshly printed pictures. The previous page held Andrew Anderson's final family portrait. This new one included Baby Chloe and Vivian Dempsey—yet would forever lack one presence.

Vivian,敏锐地 sensing the shift in mood, dramatically brandished an orange. "Where should we travel after you deliver? My treat!"

"The hospital," Evelyn answered automatically.

"What?!" Vivian fumbled the citrus, nearly launching it across the room. "Girl, don't do anything drastic! Babies can be remade—you only get one life!"

After two stunned seconds, Evelyn burst into laughter. "I meant returning to work!"

She ruefully touched her rounded abdomen. "Bending over is impossible now, let alone performing surgeries. I thought I could last until two weeks before the due date..." Her voice trailed off.

Vivian exhaled in relief and swiftly changed subjects. "Remember that gossip I told you? Update: the guy tested with zero sperm motility. Now he's divorcing!"

Peeling the orange, she continued, "Dad's matchmaking again. I told the suitor straight up: we must conceive a daughter immediately after marriage—she takes my surname. If I'm not pregnant within a year, it's his inadequacy—"

"Medically speaking, that's accurate," Evelyn mused. "But you reminded me... Alexander..."

She whispered into Vivian's ear.

Vivian's eyes bulged. "Seriously?!"

"Just a hypothesis." Evelyn frowned professionally. "But early intervention is crucial if true."

That evening, Evelyn handed Alexander Hamilton a slip of paper. "You've seemed fatigued lately. Consult this specialist."

Alexander smiled tenderly. "My physical showed no issues, darling."

"So it's just exhaustion..." Evelyn muttered, guilt flickering in her gaze.

"Pardon?" He leaned closer.

"Nothing!" She hastily diverted, "Call soon. This doctor is discreet."

Puzzled, Alexander stepped onto the balcony to dial.

Five minutes later, he returned with the crumpled note in his fist, complexion ashen.

A urologist?!

His wife had booked him a urology appointment?!
###Chapter 933: The Inevitable Comes

Each second on the phone stretched endlessly.

The doctor answering was Evelyn Carter's former classmate, now a pillar of their OB-GYN department. After Alexander Hamilton's explanation, the doctor chuckled knowingly. "Mr. Hamilton, these are normal physiological responses. There's no need for embarrassment."

"It's not about embarrassment!" Alexander's temple throbbed as he suppressed his irritation. "I don't have these symptoms at all!"

Clearly accustomed to patients in denial, the doctor softened his tone. "Mr. Hamilton, modern medicine is quite advanced—"

A vein bulged on Alexander's forehead as he ended the call abruptly. Turning to Evelyn, who was organizing prenatal records, his Adam's apple bobbed. "Have I... fallen short recently?"

His gaze burned, jaw clenched tight.

Evelyn didn't look up. "No. That's precisely why I contacted someone familiar with your case. Declining physical functions after thirty are natural. No shame in that."

Alexander froze as if struck by lightning.

Thirty? Old man? He stared at Evelyn's impassive profile, his chest constricting. Asking "Do you think I'm too old?" outright was impossible.

In the following days, Hamilton Group's headquarters simmered under oppressive tension.

Alexander had mellowed considerably this year, but recently reverted to his thunderous demeanor. Employees triple-checked documents, walking on eggshells.

Only Emily Zade recognized the signs. After delivering quarterly reports, she casually inquired, "Has Dr. Carter's morning sickness improved?"

"She's been restless." Alexander massaged his temples. "Third-trimester symptoms emerged prematurely. None of the yoga techniques help."

Emily frowned. "But she's only four months along?"

"She refuses my company at checkups." His voice turned leaden. "Won't even share ultrasound results."

The mighty Hamilton Group CEO resembled a child deprived of his favorite toy.

Emily hesitated. "Sir, Dr. Carter is strong-willed, but expectant mothers need support. Prenatal visits, fetal education—you must take initiative."

A glint flickered in Alexander's eyes.

At dawn the next day, Evelyn nearly collided with Alexander, impeccably suited in the foyer.

"Light schedule today?" Her grip tightened on the medical folder.

"Accompanying you to the hospital." He took the bag from her. "We'll make it a stroll."

Cold sweat prickled Evelyn's back.

The hospital corridor overflowed with expectant mothers. Olivia Lightfoot, swamped with patients, signaled Evelyn from afar. A nurse retrieving reports misinterpreted the gesture, winking conspiratorially at Alexander.

As Alexander opened his mouth, his phone rang.

Unknown caller.

He squeezed Evelyn's hand reassuringly before stepping aside. When he returned, his expression had darkened.

"What happened?" Evelyn clutched his sleeve.

Alexander enveloped her chilled fingers. "Grandmother's been hospitalized."
###Chapter 934: Blood Is Thicker Than Water

"What's wrong?" Evelyn Carter stood abruptly, her chair scraping loudly against the floor.

Alexander Hamilton steadied her swaying frame with quick reflexes. "The blood bank is running low. A critical patient needs a transfusion."

His voice was soft, but it sent Evelyn's nerves taut. As a doctor, she knew exactly how rare Rh-negative blood was. Only a few thousand registered donors existed in all of Hudson City. In emergencies, every second counted.

"Which hospital?" she demanded before catching herself.

Alexander was already grabbing his coat. "The OR upstairs."

His movements were decisive, without hesitation. Evelyn studied his sharp profile, struck by how unfamiliar he seemed. When had the aloof CEO of Hamilton Group become so compassionate?

"I'm coming with you." She snatched her bag and followed.

Alexander frowned. "In your condition—"

"I'm a doctor," she cut in. "Do you think someone who's seen life and death would fear an operating room?"

The elevator was packed. Alexander subtly shielded her with his arm, and the crowd parted. Evelyn noticed his wedding band glinting under the lights.

Outside the OR, a familiar figure made her chest tighten.

"Vivian?"

Vivian Dempsey looked up, her swollen eyes wide with panic. She lunged forward, gripping Evelyn's hands. "It's Grandma... The caregiver said the kettle exploded—"

Evelyn felt her friend's icy, trembling fingers. She pulled Vivian into an embrace just as a nurse whisked Alexander away.

"This wasn't your fault." She rubbed Vivian's back, feeling the fragile shoulders shudder with sobs.

Grandma Dempsey had been despondent since returning from abroad. Vivian had suggested the nursing home for a change of scenery—no one expected this tragedy. Now guilt threatened to crush the usually cheerful girl.

"The doctor said... if they can't stop the bleeding—" Vivian choked on the words.

Evelyn suddenly grasped her shoulders. "What's Grandma's blood type?"

"RH-negative, but the blood bank—"

Before she finished, both women turned toward the donation room. Vivian's tears froze mid-fall. "Alexander, he..."

At the end of the hallway, the man approached with a gauze pad pressed to his arm. His rolled-up sleeves revealed the needle mark. Sunlight through the windows outlined him in gold.

Vivian sprang up and bowed deeply. "Thank you! I was wrong before—"

"It was nothing." Alexander steadied her with a light touch, then glanced at Evelyn's slight baby bump. "Consider it blessings for the child."

The words unlocked a flood of memories. Evelyn looked away, throat burning. Their first lost child remained the deepest scar.

Vivian studied them both and suddenly laughed through tears. "Seems I need to reevaluate Mr. Hamilton." She blew her nose loudly. "When Grandma wakes up, I'll tell her exactly who saved her."

The OR light turned green. A surgeon emerged, relief visible above his mask. "The patient is stable."

Three hearts settled at once. Alexander stepped back quietly as the two women embraced, weeping. He gazed at the puncture mark on his arm and thought—this might be the most worthwhile pain he'd ever known.
###Chapter 935 In Her Name

Vivian Dempsey's fingers twisted together until they turned white.

She stared at Alexander Hamilton's impassive face, her throat clogged with unshed tears. Two decades of prejudice weighed on her like a mountain, rendering her speechless.

Evelyn Carter gave her hand a subtle squeeze.

"I always repay my debts," Vivian straightened abruptly, voice trembling. "If you ever need anything, just ask."

It sounded like a declaration of war.

Alexander chuckled softly, but his gaze drifted toward Evelyn. His face was alarmingly pale, beads of sweat forming at his temples.

"How much did you give?" Evelyn rushed forward to steady his swaying frame.

"Four hundred."

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

Vivian's water bottle clattered to the floor. Four hundred milliliters—the maximum donation limit. No wonder he could barely stand.

The operating room doors burst open.

"More blood needed!" A nurse's mask was smeared with crimson. "At least another four hundred!"

The hallway air turned to ice.

Vivian's knees buckled, only the wall keeping her upright. The blood bank was empty. Her grandmother couldn't wait.

"I'll do it." Alexander pushed himself up using the chair, his sleeve still stained with antiseptic.

"No!" Two nurses gasped in unison.

He unfastened his cufflink. "That's my fiancée's most cherished family member in there."

Vivian's tears splattered against the tiles.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. Reason and emotion warred within her until the heart monitor's alarm pierced the operating room.

"I'm coming with you." She seized Alexander's icy hand.

In the donation room, dark crimson snaked through the tubing. Evelyn watched the viscous flow, stomach churning. She'd witnessed bloodier scenes, yet now each breath felt like shards of glass.

"I weigh ninety kilos." Alexander's lips were turning chalky. "This amount..."

Evelyn pressed down on the cotton swab covering his puncture site. Eight hundred milliliters—equivalent to two water bottles. Suddenly she remembered the stack of donation certificates in his study drawer, dating back five years.

"Thank you." Her voice feathered the air. "In Evelyn's name."

Not for the Dempseys. Not out of politeness. For the first time, she thanked him simply for being himself.

Something flickered in Alexander's eyes. He braced against the donation table, rising unsteadily—only to collapse at the third step.

The last thing he heard was Evelyn screaming his name with raw desperation.
###Chapter 936: Peaceful Days

Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad to remain asleep like this forever.

Alexander Hamilton drifted in and out of consciousness, his thoughts dissolving into darkness. The sleep was deep and dreamless, undisturbed by the usual restlessness. When he finally opened his eyes again, he found himself in the familiar comfort of his own bedroom.

Sunlight filtered through the half-drawn blackout curtains, casting a golden glow across the wooden floor.

He remembered collapsing around noon—so why did the light now feel like early morning? Frowning slightly, he tried to push himself up, only for his arm to brush against someone beside him.

Evelyn Carter lay next to him, still fully dressed, her hand resting lightly in the crook of his elbow. Sensing his movement, her eyes fluttered open instantly.

The moment their gazes met, they spoke in unison: "You're awake."

Alexander's face was ashen, his lips devoid of color. Evelyn's chest tightened, her voice softening involuntarily. "You've been asleep for a full day and night. How do you feel?"

So it was already the next day.

He wasn’t surprised. Despite his stubborn front, he knew the truth—losing 800 milliliters of blood would send an average person into shock. If not for his strong constitution, he wouldn’t have lasted this long.

"Dizzy. Heavy eyelids. No strength..." He answered honestly, attempting to sit up before a wave of darkness forced him back down.

Evelyn sighed. "Losing 800 milliliters is nearly a fifth of your total blood volume. Any more, and you’d have gone into hemorrhagic shock—possibly even suffered brain damage."

She deliberately emphasized the worst-case scenario, watching as guilt flickered in his eyes before softening her tone. "But you were lucky. You collapsed right at the hospital, so we could start IV fluids immediately."

If he’d needed a blood transfusion with the current shortages… The thought alone was unbearable.

A shadow of worry crossed Alexander’s expression. "Did I cause you trouble? I couldn’t control it..."

The image of Evelyn, pregnant and exhausted, juggling his care alongside Vivian Dempsey’s grandmother made him wish he could turn back time—just to hold on a little longer.

Evelyn froze. She hadn’t expected his first words upon waking to be self-reproach. A pang of emotion tightened her throat. "No. You helped immensely. Grandma Dempsey is out of danger now—she wants to thank you in person."

In fact, the elderly woman had woken even earlier than Alexander.

Yet his first question was still about others. "Did Mom and the baby get frightened?"

"I called Margaret beforehand. She was relieved when she heard you’d acted to save someone. The baby thought you were just sleeping—she’s been very calm." Evelyn studied him as relief smoothed the tension from his face, then couldn’t help adding, "Why can’t you ever worry about yourself first?"

All his concerns had been for everyone else.

Alexander paused. "Because I trust that if anything were seriously wrong, you’d tell me."

"That much faith in me?"

"If I can’t trust you, who else is there?" His answer came effortlessly, his fingers grazing the ends of her hair as he spoke.

Evelyn’s dark locks now cascaded to her waist, silken and smooth. Even seated beside the bed, her hair spilled within easy reach.

Sunlight slipped through the curtains, scattering flecks of gold between them.

The scene was so tender it made Evelyn’s pulse quicken. She inhaled sharply, forcing herself to break the moment. "Do you need water?"

Alexander nodded. "A little thirsty."

After significant blood loss, drinking too much too soon was dangerous. He’d been sustained by IV fluids while unconscious, leaving his throat parched and aching.

"I’ll get you some." Evelyn rose, relieved for the distraction.

The kitchen was already prepared—warm water, Grace Anderson’s red date chicken soup, and the congee Margaret had left behind. She arranged everything carefully on a tray and carried it upstairs.

At six in the morning, the house was still quiet. Moving silently, she focused on one thought: I have to take care of him.

Alexander couldn’t recall the last time Evelyn had tended to him so meticulously. He reached for the water glass, but his arm trembled weakly, nearly tipping it over.

The arm used for the blood draw throbbed painfully, rendering even the simplest movements difficult.

He stared at his unsteady hand, brow furrowed.

Noticing his struggle, Evelyn pulled a chair to the bedside. She propped pillows behind him first, ensuring he could sit up comfortably before explaining, "Donation needles are thicker than standard ones. Soreness is normal."

Then she lifted the glass to his lips. Alexander drank gratefully, the cool water soothing his raw throat. "How long until I recover? There’s still work at the company..."

Suddenly, Evelyn understood exactly how Vivian must have felt. "You seriously think you can work right now?"

A man who couldn’t even hold a glass, whose pallor suggested he might faint again at any moment—yet still pushing forward. Alexander’s voice was weak but firm. "I’ll manage."

Even if he couldn’t, he’d never show it. With the company at a critical juncture, even the slightest sign of vulnerability could jeopardize everything.
###Chapter 937: A Rare Moment of Tenderness

Evelyn Carter sighed softly as she watched Alexander Hamilton forcing himself to stay awake. She set down the water glass and picked up the bowl of red date congee again, lifting a spoonful to his lips.

This time, Alexander didn’t refuse. He obediently opened his mouth.

The congee was soft and sweet, the rich flavor of red dates melting on his tongue. Only then did he realize just how hungry he was.

"Emily called yesterday," Evelyn said quietly as she fed him. "You promised to take only half a day off, but you disappeared for the entire day."

Alexander swallowed the congee and nodded slightly. "She knows?"

"Yes. I told her you fainted." She scooped another spoonful. "She said to focus on recovering. Everything at the company is under control."

A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes. He hadn’t expected Evelyn to handle things for him, and warmth bloomed in his chest.

"What about the important meeting this afternoon?" he asked weakly, feigning concern.

"Moved online." She fed him another bite. "Why are you smiling?"

The corners of his lips curved up. "The congee is sweet."

Evelyn paused, thinking he must be starving to find plain congee delicious. Guilt twisted in her heart.

A soft knock sounded at the bedroom door.

Margaret Hamilton hurried in, frowning at her son’s pale face. "You foolish boy, how could you push yourself like this?"

She turned to Evelyn. "Make him rest for a few more days. Use up all his accumulated leave."

Evelyn quickly explained, "Aunt Margaret, he lost a lot of blood this time. I’m afraid—"

"Then take sick leave!" Margaret’s eyes brightened, and she subtly winked at her son. "Focus on recovering. Work can wait."

Alexander gave a resigned nod and leaned weakly against the headboard.

Once Margaret left, satisfied, Evelyn studied him with concern. "Don’t push yourself—"

Before she could finish, the door swung open again. Baby Chloe, her hair tied into tiny braids, stumbled in, clutching Grace Anderson’s hand.

"Mommy!" The little girl’s sweet voice rang out as she rushed toward Evelyn.

Alexander instinctively reached for her, but the moment he sat up, darkness clouded his vision. He collapsed back onto the pillow.

Grace sighed. "She’s been crying since her early education class ended, insisting on seeing you."

Evelyn gently wiped the tears from the child’s cheeks, but Baby Chloe suddenly pulled away. Wobbling unsteadily, she toddled toward Alexander and stretched out her tiny hand. "Daddy…"
###Chapter 938: Heart's Knot

The hospital kept Evelyn Carter on her feet without respite. She had just pulled three consecutive night shifts. Alexander Hamilton, concerned for her, took time off to care for Baby Chloe at home. Strangely, the baby called "Mommy" far more readily than "Daddy."

Alexander didn't mind. He gently tapped the baby's tiny nose, his touch featherlight, as if afraid of hurting her.

Evelyn watched, her chest tightening. The memory of that blood donation surfaced—the emergency with Grandma Dempsey, the flustered nurses, the unusually thick needle. Though no visible bruise remained on Alexander's arm, something about him felt off.

"Could it be...?" A cold dread settled in her stomach. She'd seen too many seemingly healthy people collapse gravely ill. That near-fainting episode—had it unmasked some hidden condition?

She was considering dragging him for a full checkup once he recovered when noises erupted downstairs.

Grace Anderson carried the baby to investigate, returning with a smile. "Mr. Taylor and his wife are here. They brought live fish and are cooking in the kitchen."

Alexander's lips twitched wryly. His bedroom was becoming a tourist attraction. But since they were Evelyn's family, he forced himself upright despite the effort.

Evelyn, her four-month pregnancy slowing her movements, bent stiffly to assist him. The simple motion sent aches radiating through her lower back.

Guilt flashed in Alexander's eyes. Suddenly summoning strength, he pushed himself up unaided.

"Stop overexerting," Evelyn frowned.

"Don't worry, I know my limits." His smile softened his features, warmth flooding his gaze.

The door swung open. Anthony and Teresa Taylor entered. "Mom, Dad," Evelyn blurted, then froze at her own words. The terms still felt foreign on her tongue.

Teresa immediately noticed Evelyn's posture. "Sit down," she urged, rushing to support her.

Evelyn complied, stealing a glance at Grace. Seeing her adoptive mother unfazed, she relaxed. Grace would always come first in her heart.

"Your bump is enormous!" Teresa exclaimed. "When I carried you, I only showed this much at six months."

Grace chimed in, "Same with my pregnancy with Emily."

The two mothers launched into a lively discussion, completely forgetting their original purpose. Propped against the headboard, Alexander watched, his lips curving unconsciously. Nothing pleased him more than seeing Evelyn cherished.

Evelyn's ears burned. "Maybe it's just a growth spurt," she deflected. As an OB-GYN, her professional opinion instantly reassured them, steering the conversation back to Alexander.

After pleasantries, the Taylors prepared to leave. Teresa couldn't resist tickling Baby Chloe, who giggled and reached for her.

Trembling with hesitant joy, Teresa hesitated—afraid her frail arms might falter. Grace understood, transferring the baby into her hold while supporting the tiny legs.

Only then did Teresa dare cradle the infant, pressing a reverent kiss to her cheek as if holding the world's most fragile treasure.

Evelyn stood frozen, an ache swelling in her throat. Childhood memories surfaced—yearning for exactly this maternal embrace.

"Walk us out?" Teresa asked suddenly, hope flickering in eyes mirroring Evelyn's own.

Evelyn stiffened. Logically, she knew her birth parents meant no harm. Yet the prospect of alone time left her flustered.

But meeting that familiar gaze—so like her reflection—a crack formed in her defenses.
###Chapter 939: It Still Involves Him

Grace Anderson gently patted the baby’s back, her gaze soft as she looked at Evelyn. "Take your time talking. I’ll take care of the baby."

From the kitchen came the sound of Margaret Hamilton and Auntie Wu discussing recipes. Evelyn walked Anthony and Teresa Taylor to the door, her fingers absently tracing the doorframe. "Would you... like to stay for dinner?"

Her tone was polite yet distant, as if addressing guests from afar.

Anthony shook his head. "Alexander needs rest. We won’t intrude." He pulled a bank card from his shirt pocket. "The PIN is your birthday."

Evelyn took a half-step back. "Really, it’s unnecessary."

Teresa grasped her daughter’s hand. "Childbirth takes a toll. You should have savings." Her eyes reddened. "We calculated your hospital salary..."

Evelyn cut in, "I have savings." She paused. "If I needed money, Alexander should be the one providing it."

The words landed like a dull blade, slicing through her parents’ hearts.

Seeing their expressions darken, Evelyn softened her tone. "When I truly need help, I’ll come to you." She tried to lighten the mood. "I never repaid that last loan, did I?"

Tears instantly spilled down Teresa’s cheeks. "Silly child, our money has always been yours!"

Reluctantly, Evelyn accepted the card and tucked it into her bag.

Upstairs, Alexander was winding up a toy with his left hand. The baby lay beside his legs, her small face flushed with excitement. Grace sat nearby, the creases between her brows smoothed away.

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, her palm resting lightly on her abdomen. It was the first genuine smile her mother had worn since her father’s passing.

After the baby was taken for feeding, Alexander suddenly spoke. "You should keep what they gave you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Did you conspire with them?"

"No." He closed his eyes briefly. "They once asked me about doctors’ salaries."

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "You knew they’d worry."

Alexander suddenly pressed a hand to his temple, his face paling. This time, it wasn’t an act—playing with the baby had drained what little strength he had left.
###Chapter 940: I Can Answer For You

Evelyn Carter noticed Alexander Hamilton's pale complexion and furrowed brow. She immediately set down her medical chart and hurried to his bedside.

"Does it hurt here?" Her slender fingers gently pressed against his temples.

Alexander closed his eyes, savoring the warmth of her touch. "Much better."

Her hands carried the sterile scent of hospital antiseptic, fingertips slightly calloused from years of wielding surgical tools. Yet their presence against his forehead brought him inexplicable comfort.

Evelyn methodically examined his cervical vertebrae, her frown deepening. "This isn't just headache from blood loss. It's muscle strain from prolonged poor posture."

She paused, realization dawning. "You need to replace that office chair of yours."

She'd visited his office several times. The expensive leather executive chair felt as unforgiving as hardwood.

"Perhaps..." Alexander hesitated, "if you grew twenty centimeters taller, it might fit better."

The air froze.

Evelyn's fingers dug in sharply. "Fine. Enjoy your height advantage. Next time you have a headache, don't come to me."

Alexander scrambled to sit up and explain, only to smash his forehead against her chin.

A dull thud echoed through the room.

Evelyn clutched her jaw, tears welling. In all her years of practice, no patient had ever injured her.

"I'm sorry!" Alexander ignored his dizziness, reaching to check the damage. "I didn't mean—"

She waved him off; the minor injury meant nothing to a surgeon. But the incident haunted Alexander through his evening video conference. Even his executives noticed his distraction.

On screen, the pale-faced CEO looked alarmingly ill. The terrified managers exchanged glances—what catastrophic project failure could distress their unflappable leader so?

Propped against his headboard in a rumpled suit, Alexander's paper-white complexion glowed eerily in the laptop's light. He deliberately slowed his speech, but his voice remained hoarse.

"Safety inspections...aren't negotiable...budget can be increased..." The moment he finished, he snapped the laptop shut and collapsed backward.

Evelyn had been pretending to review medical journals nearby while monitoring his condition. She immediately set aside her reading.

"Can you hold on?" Her voice softened to a whisper.

Beads of sweat dotted Alexander's forehead as he kept his eyes closed. "Dizzy. Nauseous. Exhausted but can't sleep."

"These symptoms..." Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Are identical to my first trimester."

Alexander lacked even the energy to shake his head in protest.

As Evelyn prepared to insist he rest, his phone vibrated. Alexander reflexively reached for it, but vertigo forced him back onto the pillows.

"It's Emily Zade." Evelyn picked up the device, startled by his icy fingertips. Those always-warm hands now felt like frozen marble.

She pressed her lips together. "Should I answer? If you're really unwell...I can handle it."

Alexander's eyes lit up. He'd waited years for this moment.

Evelyn maintained strict professional boundaries, never interfering with his work. During her brief stint managing Hamilton Group, she'd discovered being CEO was more exhausting than surgery—at least in the operating room, no one stabbed you in the back.
###Chapter 941: The Embodiment of Jealousy

Troublemakers in the company sprouted like weeds. No sooner had Alexander Hamilton dealt with one batch than another emerged. His furrowed brow betrayed yet another thorny issue.

Evelyn Carter had no intention of meddling initially. But after being repeatedly thrust into these situations, she'd learned the ropes.

The call connected swiftly.

"Miss Carter." Secretary Emily Zade's voice held no surprise, warm as a casual chat. "During the video conference earlier, Mr. Hamilton seemed unwell. You'll need to take extra care of him."

"It's my responsibility." Evelyn's tone carried quiet resignation.

Emily detected the subtle softening in Evelyn's attitude toward Alexander—a promising sign. She swallowed her initial words, pivoting to mundane topics instead.

"Mr. Hamilton truly cherishes you. In all my years working with him, I've never seen him so devoted. Not even to himself. The day he learned of your pregnancy, his joy was unmistakable."

Alexander, usually ice-cold and unapproachable at work, had radiated happiness that day.

Evelyn had noticed but deliberately avoided dwelling on it. Now, hearing Emily's words while gazing at the weakened man in bed, an invisible weight pressed against her chest.

The afternoon rain left the room perfectly temperate, needing no air conditioning.

Fanning herself, Evelyn excused the heat and stepped away. On the terrace behind sheer curtains, she murmured, "Emily, I understand your meaning. He's been kind lately, but... perhaps it's lingering trauma."

"I know." Emily, ever the observer, didn't invoke the child. "Mr. Hamilton's past actions were inexcusable. Frankly, your current care for him is already generous. He admits you tolerate him solely for the baby's sake."

Alexander privately thought so bleakly?

Evelyn's heart clenched. Unconsciously, her voice gentled. "I don't... resent him that much. He can't share my pregnancy burdens, so extra consideration is natural. But Grandma Duan's matter—he didn't have to intervene."

Some favors were grace, not obligation. She wasn't selfish enough to count life-saving debts.

Besides, the past was smoke. She'd never expected anything from him. Yet between the fire rescue and now, he'd effectively saved her life one and a half times.

Emily tactfully shifted topics. "Actually, I needed to discuss something else. The Wilson family sent an invitation for Elder Wilson's sixtieth birthday celebration."

Alexander, notorious for his workaholism, practically lived at the office. Outsiders always contacted him there first.

The Hamiltons and Wilsons shared deep ties, especially between Alexander and Vincent Wilson. For the patriarch's milestone birthday, even if Alexander couldn't attend, etiquette demanded proper acknowledgment.

Evelyn loathed such social obligations, but the Wilson connection warranted caution. "I'll relay the message."

Elder Wilson was Gregory and Vincent's father. Though she and Gregory worked at the same hospital without deliberate avoidance, fate lately kept them apart.

Even Gregory's return from his business trip coincided with her leave. Olivia Lightfoot had informed her.

Alexander lay in bed, his mind suspended midair. He trusted Emily wouldn't slander him—if anything, she'd sing his praises. But where Evelyn was concerned, anxiety gnawed at him. Combined with cerebral hypoperfusion, he nearly fainted.

Yet Evelyn remained on the terrace. Gritting his teeth, he clung to consciousness, awaiting developments. None of his usual composure remained.

The sheer curtains fluttered.

Evelyn reentered, brows slightly furrowed, gazing at him with unreadable hesitation.

Alexander's pulse raced. Paler than ever, he still managed concern. "Sit down."

Hand supporting her lower back, Evelyn perched on the bed's edge. "Emily mentioned Vincent's father's sixtieth birthday. You must attend."

A sixtieth birthday marked a life milestone. Everyone connected to the Wilsons would be present.

But in Alexander's current state?

Evelyn's eyes, glistening under the bedside lamp, brimmed with worry. Misinterpreting his silence as reluctance, she suggested, "Perhaps go in a wheelchair? Claim a leg injury."

Given Alexander's status, no one would dare comment—they might even praise his dedication to the Wilsons.

Alexander jerked upright. "You're not coming?"

Evelyn blinked, more startled. "Why would I? I wasn't invited. Surely you don't expect me to represent you? Emily would be more suitable."

She'd entirely misunderstood.

Terrified she might realize, Alexander shook his head so vigorously he nearly blacked out again. "Of course not. You should rest during pregnancy. I'd never impose."

He'd assumed Gregory would seize this chance to invite Evelyn—hence his earlier relief.

Evelyn studied him incredulously, questioning if he'd truly suffered brain damage.

Alexander had become jealousy incarnate, viewing every man near Evelyn as a threat. But Gregory Wilson remained his greatest dread.

Logically, Evelyn's pregnancy should have eased his mind. Emotionally, vigilance persisted. He feared Gregory's unresolved intentions—playing stepfather to their child.

After all, in terms of official standing, they started from equal footing.
###Chapter 942: The Sycophant's Downfall

Alexander Hamilton finally felt the weight lift from his chest when he noticed Evelyn Carter keeping her distance from Gregory Wilson. He slept soundly that night, his dreams sweet and undisturbed.

The next morning, the Wilson family sent a visitor.

Vincent Wilson, usually irreverent among friends, forced himself into a facade of propriety in front of elders. Laden with gifts, he greeted Margaret Hamilton with practiced decorum.

"Aunt Margaret, I brought you some premium bird's nest."

Margaret accepted the gift with a smile. "You shouldn't have gone to such trouble."

Vincent turned to Grace Anderson, his eyes brightening. "You must be Dr. Carter's mother! You look so young—like sisters standing together."

His sunlit grin and perfect white teeth usually charmed elders effortlessly.

Grace offered a polite smile that cooled noticeably when Margaret introduced him as "Alexander's close friend."

She hadn't forgotten how Alexander's so-called friends had kicked Evelyn when she was down during the divorce. Especially that notorious playboy named Wilson—likely this very man.

Vincent sensed the shift and quickly changed tack. "That cheongsam suits you perfectly, Aunt Grace. It accentuates your elegance."

Grace replied evenly, "Thank you. Evelyn picked it out for me."

The flattery fell flat.

Beads of sweat formed on Vincent's forehead as he redirected to Margaret. "Aunt Margaret, your complexion glows lately. You look ten years younger."

Margaret chuckled. "Alexander has matured. I worry less now."

Thinking fast, Vincent produced skincare boxes from his bag. "My mother asked me to bring these—newly developed medical-grade products perfect for both of you."

Grace showed little interest until hearing "medical-grade." "Does someone in your family practice medicine?"

"My brother's an anesthesiologist at the same hospital as Dr. Carter," Vincent blurted—then immediately wished he could bite his tongue off.

Margaret's expression tightened. She knew exactly how her son felt about Gregory.

But Grace perked up. "So Dr. Wilson is your brother? Evelyn often mentioned his kindness abroad. I've been wanting to thank him personally."

Vincent's collar grew damp. "No need! My brother hates formalities!"

He mentally kicked himself. This wasn't helping—it was sabotaging.

Fortunately, Grace didn't press further. Seizing the opportunity, Vincent pivoted. "Actually, Alexander's done remarkable charity work lately—donating equipment to Central Hospital, establishing a foundation..."

Margaret and Grace exchanged surprised glances.

"That boy never mentions his good deeds," Margaret murmured, eyes glistening.

Grace's demeanor softened. "Truly commendable."

Vincent finally found solid ground and pressed his advantage. "He's also sponsoring underprivileged students, and at last month's auction..."

He prattled on, heart pounding. This sycophantic performance had nearly buried him alive.
###Chapter 943: Someone in His Heart

Vincent Wilson couldn't stop singing Alexander Hamilton's praises until Grace Anderson and Margaret Hamilton both nodded approvingly. He finally took a sip of tea to soothe his throat.

Suddenly, he felt a light tap on his knee.

Looking down, he saw Baby Chloe standing beside him. The little girl had grown chubbier since their last meeting, her rosy cheeks glowing against porcelain skin. Her tiny hands clutched his pant leg.

Vincent, who usually avoided children like the plague, found himself smiling.

"Is this Alexander and... Dr. Carter's daughter?" He carefully avoided saying "sister-in-law." "Last time I saw her, she could barely walk."

Margaret gave a knowing smile. "Play with her for a while. I'll go check upstairs."

Vincent nodded eagerly. The child's big, curious eyes made him briefly consider marriage and fatherhood. His voice softened. "What's your name, sweetheart?"

"Easy," she lisped.

When she kept tugging his sleeve, Vincent felt a surge of pride. "Call me Uncle."

The girl tilted her head. Though she didn't recognize this stranger, anyone in the house must be safe. She tugged again.

Before Vincent could tease her further, Alexander's voice came from the stairs. "You're sitting on her toy."

Vincent jumped up, finding a feather cat teaser wedged in the couch cushions. The moment he handed it over, Baby Chloe scampered to the window to play with the cat.

So that's what she wanted.

Alexander approached, dark circles still faint under his eyes, though he looked better than days prior.

Upstairs, Evelyn Carter merely nodded upon hearing Vincent was the visitor before returning to her work. Grace soon followed her upstairs.

The living room held only the two men now.

"Alexander," Vincent frowned, "what really happened? The company says you're sick, but no one gave me a straight answer."

"I donated blood for Dr. Carter's friend's grandmother's surgery," Alexander said flatly.

"How much?"

"800 milliliters."

Vincent gasped. "800?! Why not donate a full liter?!"

"I tried," Alexander replied calmly. "The nurse refused. Other volunteers showed up later."

He made it sound like passing someone a napkin.

Vincent gaped. "If Dr. Carter's family needed it, would you donate a kidney too?"

"I'd consider it." The answer was as good as yes.

Vincent had never witnessed such legendary lovesickness firsthand. He was speechless.

"Your father's birthday banquet is coming up," Alexander changed subjects. "Shouldn't you be preparing instead of running around?"

Vincent rubbed his hands awkwardly. "I came specifically to invite you... since my brother will definitely be there."

Alexander's gaze turned icy. "I heard your brother is dating?"

"There was one match," Vincent forced a laugh, "but I ended up with her."

"So he's still single."

"Technically..." Vincent hesitated. He couldn't exactly say his brother's heart belonged to someone else—someone he couldn't move on from.

"The family plans to introduce him to a doctor at the banquet. She just returned from abroad."

Alexander's eyes flickered. "He likes doctors?"

A faint sourness suddenly filled the air.

Vincent hurried to explain. "Nothing like your wife! Not an OB-GYN! You'll see when you meet her!"

"I'll attend," Alexander agreed abruptly. "Though I may not look my best."

That evening, when Evelyn learned of his plans, she frowned. "Can your body handle it?"

"Vincent came personally," Alexander said impassively. "It would be rude to decline."

At home, Vincent sneezed, suddenly feeling a chill down his spine.

Evelyn scowled. "That friend of yours has no sense of boundaries."

"Probably your father-in-law's idea," Alexander agreed. "Our families go way back. Not going might raise suspicions..."
###Chapter 944: Playing Matchmaker

Alexander Hamilton observed Evelyn Carter's reaction discreetly. Seeing her expression remain unchanged, he continued, "Elder Wilson has been wanting to meet Baby Chloe ever since he heard about her."

Evelyn frowned slightly. "There shouldn't be any connection between Elder Wilson and the baby. Is this because of the Langleys?"

At the baby's birthday party, the Wilson family had sent representatives, but Elder Wilson himself hadn't attended. Evelyn couldn't understand why this respected patriarch would take such an interest in a little girl.

"Perhaps he's eager for grandchildren," Alexander said calmly. "Both Gregory and Vincent are still single. It's natural for him to be anxious."

Compared to the Hamilton family's sparse lineage, the Wilsons had more descendants. But with the Hamiltons expecting new additions soon, Elder Wilson couldn't help feeling impatient.

Evelyn nodded. "Then I'll go with you. It wouldn't be convenient for you to take care of the baby in your condition." She wasn't distrustful of Alexander, but he had just been discharged from the hospital and still looked pale. If he became exhausted at the party and frightened the baby, it would be troublesome.

The thought of Gregory Wilson never crossed her mind. that chapter of her life was long closed and not worth revisiting.

But Alexander was calculating something else entirely. His original plan had been to make Gregory give up any lingering hopes. If Evelyn went along, wouldn't that give them a chance to meet?

What if Gregory persisted and Evelyn softened?

Visions of melodramatic scenarios flashed through his mind, making him increasingly uneasy. His expression visibly darkened.

"You look even paler now," Evelyn noticed immediately.

Alexander forced composure. "You're four months pregnant. Would attending a banquet be too taxing?"

His gaze dropped to her noticeably rounded abdomen—larger than average, as if she were carrying twins.

"I'll just sit and rest," Evelyn said with a light laugh. "All those daily walks have to count for something."

She needed to maintain moderate activity, especially with two little ones growing inside her.

Unable to find a better excuse, Alexander reluctantly agreed.

On the day of Elder Wilson's birthday celebration, the couple arrived dressed elegantly yet comfortably. Alexander had regained some color, but traces of fatigue lingered between his brows, adding a touch of sternness to his demeanor.

Evelyn wore a flowing dress with her hair elegantly pinned up, exuding gentle grace. Holding Baby Chloe's tiny hand, they entered the banquet hall and instantly became the center of attention.

The Wilsons welcomed them warmly. Though everyone tacitly understood Evelyn's status, since she and Alexander hadn't remarried, they politely addressed her as "Miss Carter."

"I heard you work at Central Hospital?" Elder Wilson asked kindly. "My eldest son is also there. You must know him?"

Evelyn responded politely, "I've collaborated with Dr. Wilson on several surgeries. He's highly skilled and well-respected in the hospital."

The elder waved a hand. "He's nowhere near as accomplished as you young people."

Seeing the conversation shift to Gregory, Alexander quickly interjected, "Uncle Wilson, I heard you've been arranging matches for Gregory recently?"

Evelyn shot him a surprised look. Had he suffered brain damage from blood loss?

Mentioning his son's marital prospects made Elder Wilson sigh. "Neither of my boys gives me peace of mind!"

Alexander understood immediately. "So the matchmaking hasn't gone well?"

Evelyn was secretly astonished. With Gregory's qualifications, how could he possibly fail at matchmaking?

"Don't even ask," the elder lamented. "Either Vincent ruins things, or the women find Gregory too aloof. You young people understand each other better—perhaps you could introduce him to someone?"

"No problem," Alexander agreed readily. "I'll have my secretary make arrangements."

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock. Since when had he become so enthusiastic about playing Cupid?
###Chapter 945: A Farewell to My Past Self

Baby Chloe blinked her big curious eyes as she studied Elder Wilson.

The old man's face lit up. "My wife and I always wanted a daughter, but we ended up with another boy. Didn't dare try again after that." He chuckled. "This little one is absolutely delightful."

He picked the juiciest peach from the fruit tray, polished it carefully, and handed it to her.

"Thank you, Grandpa~" Her tiny voice sent waves of laughter through the room.

Alexander Hamilton found a small basket to hold the peach, worried she might drop it. His fatherly instincts were on full display.

Evelyn Carter suppressed a smile at the sight.

Noticing her amusement, Alexander's gaze softened. Their eyes met briefly before Evelyn quickly looked away.

"With such a loving relationship, no wonder you're expecting again so soon," teased one of the Wilson elders.

The comment brought an awkward silence. Saved by new arrivals, Alexander guided Evelyn and Chloe to a quiet corner.

"Didn't know you played matchmaker," Evelyn quipped.

Alexander handed her a juice. "Just acquaintances."

His intense stare made her shift uncomfortably. Baby Chloe giggled nearby, as if understanding the tension.

They rejoined the party when dinner was served.

Gregory Wilson stood by the side entrance, watching them leave. He'd known Alexander would bring Evelyn, yet the sight still twisted his heart.

The garden bloomed with fragrance as Evelyn led Chloe through the flowers. The toddler adored them, sniffing each blossom enthusiastically.

"Dr. Wilson?" Evelyn turned and spotted him.

Gregory swallowed hard. "Congratulations on the pregnancy."

"Thank you." She rested a hand on her belly, eyes glowing.

"Let me know if you need anything." His voice tightened. "About the hospital incident—I was away..."

"It's over." Evelyn cut him off, unwilling to revisit the past.

Silence fell until Chloe's babbling at the flowers broke it.

Evelyn produced a bank card. "Actually, there's something I need to return."

Gregory froze.

"Two million, principal plus interest." Her tone was steady. "PIN is the first six digits of your phone."

The card was from Teresa Taylor—the exact amount owed, as if fate intervened.

"Consider it... closing a chapter." Gregory refused to take it.

"If I don't pay now, the interest will bury me." Evelyn joked but firmly pressed the card into his hand. "Unless you're trying to scam me for more?"
###Chapter 946: Always Has Been

Gregory Wilson watched as Evelyn Carter slid the bank card across the table. His fingers tapped lightly on the wooden surface.

"In such a hurry to cut ties with me?" A bitter smile touched his lips, though his gaze remained clear.

Evelyn tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Debts must be repaid. It's only right."

Outside, roses bloomed in vibrant splendor. Baby Chloe crouched by the flowerbed, tiny fingers brushing against delicate petals. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling her with shifting patterns.

Gregory's eyes lingered on the child before returning to Evelyn. "Actually, this money..."

He paused, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Alexander Hamilton settled it long ago."

Evelyn's fingers tightened abruptly.

"When?"

"Remember that chance meeting at Cloud Terrace Resort?" Gregory's gaze drifted into the distance. "After you and Vivian Dempsey left, Alexander sought me out immediately. Transferred the full amount on the spot."

The memory surfaced—Alexander slamming the check onto the table with stormy eyes. Gregory shook his head. "Principal and interest. Every cent accounted for."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered.

She remembered that day. Her first encounter with Bianca Langley. The first time she'd met the child who would later become her daughter. Fate worked in strange ways—a single random crossing could alter life's entire trajectory.

"Why didn't he tell me?"

Gregory chuckled. "The fragile male ego, I suppose."

Sunlight gilded Evelyn's profile, softening her features. Understanding dawned, lifting the corners of her lips. "I see now."

In that moment, Gregory realized with crystalline clarity—he'd never truly held her heart. Not because of poor timing or inadequacy, but because he'd chosen to wait while Alexander had charged forward without hesitation.

"I wish you both happiness." Sincerity weighted his words.

Evelyn nodded. "Thank you."

She insisted on transferring the interest. "Principles matter. This isn't negotiable."

A notification chimed. Gregory stared at the payment alert, struck by the absurdity—their final connection severed by digits on a screen.

Baby Chloe toddled over clutching a petal. Gregory knelt, plucking a rose to offer her.

"Say thank you to Uncle," Evelyn prompted softly.

The child studied Gregory with wide eyes before extending her small hand. "Tank...oo..."

Gregory ruffled her hair and rose to leave. Sunlight stretched his shadow long across the garden path until it dissolved into nothingness.

By the banquet hall's side entrance, Vincent Wilson exhaled. "See? Just like I told you—nothing going on between my brother and Evelyn."

Alexander's gaze remained fixed on the mother-daughter pair in the distance, warmth softening his expression. "Always has been."

"But then why—"

"I trust Evelyn." Alexander's voice sharpened as his eyes turned glacial. "What I don't trust..."
###Chapter 947: Settling Old Scores

Gregory Wilson had just opened his mouth to say, "It's my brother I don't trust," when Alexander Hamilton's cool voice came from behind. "Looking for me?"

His body stiffened as he turned mechanically. "Brother..."

Guilt was written all over his face.

Gregory stepped past him, addressing Alexander directly. "Taking a breather too, Mr. Hamilton?"

"Indeed." Alexander's lips twitched. "Thought some fresh air might help me remember things people conveniently forget."

The jealousy was practically suffocating.

Vincent Wilson rolled his eyes internally. Dr. Carter was five months pregnant—who in their right mind would make advances on an expecting mother? Not that he dared say it aloud.

With the confrontation focused on Gregory, he had no intention of drawing fire to himself.

Gregory remained unruffled. "I haven't forgotten. Some debts simply can't be left unsettled. Do you recall that two million Dr. Carter repaid on my behalf?"

As colleagues who saw each other daily, he preferred transparency over evasion. He'd once harbored feelings for Evelyn, but always maintained proper boundaries.

Alexander knew this. Yet like an abandoned dog panicking at the sight of new pets around its owner, his expression darkened at the mention of the money.

Noticing this, Gregory said to Vincent, "Let's go."

Vincent practically fled in relief, though when he turned to bid Alexander farewell, the man was already striding toward the garden.

There, Baby Chloe stood on tiptoe, trying to place a flower in Evelyn's hair.

"Since when did you become so beauty-obsessed?" Evelyn laughed, dodging. "Other children want flowers for themselves. Why always me?"

"Because Mommy's the prettiest."

Alexander's voice cut in as he scooped up the little girl, helping her tuck the rose into Evelyn's hair. But her tiny hands lacked finesse—the delicate petals crumpled instantly.

The child's eyes widened, her lower lip trembling. Alexander quickly soothed her. "Flowers fade, sweetheart. Daddy will buy you ones that never wilt, okay?"

His anxious gaze darted to Evelyn, expecting anger. Instead, she sighed in amusement. "No flower lasts forever. Don't lie to her."

"They exist." Relieved, he seized the moment. "I ran into Gregory. He mentioned you repaying the debt."

Evelyn wasn't surprised. "Debts should be paid. Though I didn't realize you'd already settled it for me. I called you that day—you never answered."

For once, Alexander was forthright. "Petty jealousy. I'd prepared the payment, but if I hadn't..."

Had he not acted on pride, Evelyn wouldn't have needed Gregory's help. He knew her stubbornness well, yet had waited for her to yield.

"I'm sorry."

"That was over a year ago." Suddenly Evelyn understood why he hated her gratitude.

She retrieved a bank card from her purse. "I've transferred the interest to Gregory. This is your principal."

Now Alexander realized why the Andersons had met Evelyn privately that day. He refused firmly. "That's from your parents. I can't accept it."

"Then you remain my creditor." Her tone was calm. "My salary covers monthly interest payments."

Hadn't he insisted on maximum interest rates back then?

Alexander had no choice but to take the card. Rejecting it would only mean higher repayments later—making reconciliation even harder.

When Evelyn shared the PIN, his face froze. "This is—"

"First six digits of Gregory's phone number." She met his gaze steadily. "Appropriate for repaying him."

"Then I won't take it." He seized the excuse. "If you used his birthday for his repayment, mine should be used for yours."

Evelyn nearly laughed. "Are you five?"

"Absolutely." Alexander squared his shoulders. "But if you're settling debts, my feelings matter too, don't they?"
###Chapter 948: Love's Bitter End

"I've been swamped lately." Evelyn Carter gently touched her rounded belly, a trace of weariness flickering between her brows. "Prenatal checkup tomorrow, picking up Grandma Dempsey from the hospital the day after, and then..."

Alexander Hamilton discreetly slipped the bank card back into her dress pocket. "No rush. We can update the details after the baby arrives."

The Wilson family's birthday banquet was lavish yet tasteful. Given the elderly patriarch's advanced age, most guests tactfully departed after lunch. Only a few close family friends lingered. Alexander held little Chloe's hand as he and Evelyn bid farewell to Elder Wilson.

"Bye-bye, Great-Grandpa!" The toddler waved with childish sweetness. The old man's eyes crinkled with delight. "If only those two useless grandsons of mine could give me a great-granddaughter like this."

Gregory Wilson kept his gaze lowered, while Vincent Wilson pretended not to hear while glancing around. Bringing home an illegitimate child would likely give the old man a stroke on the spot.

"What are you waiting for? Escort our guests!" The patriarch's glare sent both brothers trudging toward the door. Vincent sighed dramatically, missing the troubled shadow in his elder brother's eyes when he looked back.

Once alone, Elder Wilson finally addressed the elephant in the room: "The family legacy needs an heir. Since Vincent is hopeless, Gregory must step up."

Alexander nodded understandingly. "Don't worry, Uncle Wilson. I haven't forgotten."

But the old man turned to Evelyn. "I heard Gregory once fancied a doctor from your hospital? Perhaps you could..."

Evelyn's fingers twitched, nearly spilling her tea. "I... don't know much about that."

Alexander smoothly intervened. "That doctor is already married with three children." He adopted a regretful tone. "Gregory met her during a marital rough patch. After she reconciled with her husband, the matter..."

Evelyn sipped her tea, the tips of her ears turning pink. The fabricated story was so seamless even she almost believed it.

"Enough." The elder sighed deeply. "You young people... I just hope Gregory moves on soon." His gnarled fingers traced the dragon head carving on his cane. "His mother and I fell in love at first sight—married within eight months. This prolonged melancholy must be heartbreak."

In the car home, Evelyn watched trees blur past the window. "Lying to Elder Wilson like this..."

"Better than the truth." Alexander turned the steering wheel. "If he learned Gregory's feelings were for you, his blood pressure would skyrocket."

At a luxury boutique, Alexander bought Chloe an eternal rose glass globe. Evelyn gasped at the five-figure price tag. "That's excessive."

"Just this once." He squeezed the toddler's chubby hand as she rolled the delicate orb like a toy, oblivious to its symbolism of everlasting love.

Evelyn frowned. "We can't indulge her. When she starts preschool—"

"I know." Alexander cut in. "But some things, I want to give her the best." His gaze flickered to her abdomen before darting away. Sunset light through the window dappled his profile in shifting patterns.
###Chapter 949: A Wise Man Avoids Danger

Alexander Hamilton had always been fiercely independent—until he met Evelyn Carter. She taught him how to step outside his own world.

He listened to her words, wanting to comply, but some principles were non-negotiable.

"Being different isn’t a bad thing," he said, gripping the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white. "No one will ever lay a finger on our daughter. If anyone dares, they’ll regret it."

The mere thought of his child suffering made him want to eliminate every potential threat before it could even take root.

Evelyn paused, a memory surfacing. "When I was adopted, I lost all my memories. As the new kid in class, everyone thought I was strange."

"In a child’s world, different means isolated. Only Vivian Dempsey and a few others were willing to befriend me."

Their twenty-year friendship had blossomed from those lonely days.

Understanding dawned on Alexander. She feared history repeating itself—a wise man avoids danger. She’d rather be called timid than let their daughter endure hardship. Not every child was lucky enough to find a friend like Vivian.

After a long silence, his voice was low but firm. "I promise our daughter will never experience that. Neither will our future children. Even if they struggle to make friends, they’ll always have each other."

At a red light, he glanced in the rearview mirror at Evelyn’s rounded belly. In four months, their second child would arrive. Their little girl would soon have a sibling.

In the backseat, Baby Chloe carefully cradled an eternal rose glass orb, remembering her last lesson when she’d crushed a rose.

As the light turned green, the car ahead braked abruptly. The glass sphere slipped from her hands, teetering toward the seat’s edge—until Evelyn snatched it mid-fall.

Alexander slammed the brakes, stopping inches from the car ahead. Ignoring the near collision, he turned to his wife and child.

"Are you okay?"

"We’re fine," Evelyn assured him, returning the orb to their daughter with a relieved sigh.

Then a tear-streaked woman burst from the car ahead, darting into traffic. Alexander was about to drive on when Evelyn rolled down her window. "Mrs. Grant?"

The woman froze, turning in shock. "Dr. Carter!"

Alexander recognized her—the woman Evelyn had delivered in an emergency roadside birth.

A bespectacled man stormed toward them. Alexander’s icy glare stopped him cold, recalling how hospital security had once dragged him out.

Evelyn seized the moment. "Get in."

Mrs. Grant scrambled into the backseat beside Chloe, wiping her reddened eyes.

The man erupted. "How long will you keep humiliating me? Our relatives are asking about the baby’s celebration!"

"I’m not coming back," Mrs. Grant said, trembling. "Sign the divorce papers, or I’ll file in court."

As the man lunged, Alexander accelerated, leaving him shouting amidst blaring horns.

Mrs. Grant hung her head. "I’m so sorry, Dr. Carter. First the hospital complaint, now almost causing an accident..."

"Don’t worry," Evelyn handed her a tissue. "The department head dismissed that complaint. Are you... having trouble with the divorce?"

Alexander’s grip on the wheel tightened, veins bulging—but he remained silent.

This wasn’t over.
###Chapter 950: First Birthday Tradition

Mrs. Grant's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "He's too ashamed to get divorced. He'd rather suffer than lose face."

Marriage was never just between two people. Divorce was even more complicated. When both families were equally powerful, the tug-of-war became unbearable.

Her eyes reddened, voice trembling. "Before the wedding, my mother kept pushing me to marry. Now that she's seen my in-laws' true colors, she finally supports the divorce. But the baby is still so young..."

"Having second thoughts?" Evelyn asked gently. "Need a ride home? We're free this afternoon."

The shopping list was complete. Only naptime remained for little Chloe.

Mrs. Grant fidgeted with her fingers. "Don't trouble yourselves. Any intersection will do."

Alexander glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "Listen to Dr. Carter."

A simple statement that conveyed his stance while easing her hesitation.

Only then did she provide her parents' address, gazing at them wistfully. "You two are so loving, Dr. Carter. Still affectionate even with a second baby. I'll never have that blessing."

Evelyn didn't bother explaining their complicated history. "Marriage isn't mandatory. Children are the real treasures."

Alexander silently swallowed his frustration. Wasn't he currently relying on their daughter to stay relevant?

At the mention of children, Mrs. Grant's expression softened slightly, a fragile smile breaking through her tear-streaked face.

Before parting, Evelyn offered comforting words. To everyone's surprise, Alexander handed over a business card. "Call this lawyer. Mention my name."

Mrs. Grant hesitated. "But..."

Years of pregnancy and childcare had drained her savings. A top attorney's fees were beyond reach.

"He takes pro bono cases annually," Alexander said evenly. "If his quota's full, others at the firm will help."

Grateful tears welled as she watched their car disappear before turning away.

Evelyn studied Alexander thoughtfully.

"What?" He instantly noticed her gaze.

"Didn't expect you to help," she murmured. "Thought you found her troublesome."

The old Alexander would have. His eyes remained on the road. "Don't judge others until you've walked their path. I helped because..."

His voice unexpectedly gentled.

"...I finally understood how deeply my 'fair' divorce terms hurt you. That realization came far too late."

Evelyn blinked, then smiled softly. "Helping others is what matters."

Warm silence filled the car.

The peace shattered upon returning home—another parenting debate erupted.

This time, the trigger was a call from the yoga instructor.

With prenatal classes ending, Evelyn considered signing up for fetal education. The instructor enthusiastically pitched music, bilingual courses, even early-learning programs.

"Chloe's introductory classes are finishing soon. Next we recommend art, coding..." The teacher prattled on.

Evelyn's scalp prickled. Were all these activities appropriate for such a young child?

Hesitantly hanging up, she relayed the conversation.

Alexander frowned as if contemplating national security. "Let's recreate the First Birthday Tradition for her."

"Now?" Evelyn hesitated. "She's already past her first birthday."

"Doesn't matter." His tone brooked no argument. "Our daughter deserves every tradition others have."
###Chapter 951: The Unexpected First Birthday Tradition

Evelyn Carter looked up at Alexander Hamilton. His confident expression made her think he'd recalled some crucial detail.

"Baby Chloe never had her First Birthday Tradition?" she asked softly. "I thought no matter how much Miss Langley and Vincent Croix fought, they wouldn't involve their child."

The baby should have been a princess born with a silver spoon. But the Langley family's downfall came too swiftly, and her parents became sworn enemies, leaving her tragically alone.

Evelyn still remembered Bianca Langley's tender expression when holding her daughter. Back then, she'd assumed the child only lacked a father.

Alexander sighed. "Bianca truly wanted to shield her daughter. But Vincent is unpredictable. After the Langley's one-month celebration, they never hosted another gathering. I'm not sure if Baby Chloe had the tradition privately."

He knew the truth but couldn't bear to voice it.

As first-time parents, Evelyn and Alexander relied entirely on elder advice and parenting classes. Baby Chloe was well-behaved and taller than her peers, yet they constantly felt inadequate.

"Since we're uncertain," Evelyn pondered, "let's assume she hasn't had it with us. It's just a small ritual—no need for elaborate preparations. We can do it anytime."

Hearing her say "us," Alexander's lips curved slightly. Though not officially recognized, he was already Baby Chloe's father and Evelyn's partner in life.

Evelyn quickly gathered paper, pens, and professional books from the study as options. Alexander brought down a cardboard box. Wordlessly, they arranged the items on the sofa.

Baby Chloe watched with wide, curious eyes. No one noticed when Peanut the cat leaped onto the sofa's backrest.

As Alexander guided the baby's tiny hands toward the display, she immediately climbed onto the sofa and grabbed Peanut's tail.

The cat, who usually only tormented middle-aged humans, showed remarkable patience with the young. Instead of protesting, Peanut rolled onto its back and let out a soft "meow."

The living room fell into stunned silence.

Alexander surveyed the arranged stationery, toys, and accessories. "Was Peanut an option?"

"Apparently so," Evelyn said calmly. "If it was on the sofa, it counts. Maybe she'll become a veterinarian or simply adore animals. Not everything needs practical significance."

After a moment's thought, Alexander nodded. "Let's just hope our home doesn't turn into a zoo."

The dry joke made Evelyn smile. She ignored his use of "our home," instead picturing Baby Chloe grown up—with both parents being beauties, the already delicate child would undoubtedly blossom into a stunning young woman.

"Baby Chloe's grandparents are returning to the country!"

Margaret Hamilton's urgent voice shattered her thoughts. Her usually elegant mother-in-law hurried downstairs, flustered. "They don't know about Bianca yet. What do we do?"

Evelyn and Alexander paled simultaneously. Their locked gazes reflected mutual shock.

Bianca's suicide note had arranged everything meticulously: Baby Chloe entrusted to them, her parents in Canada cared for by the old butler, receiving annual postcards in her name. She'd even written, "Let them think me an unfilial daughter."

Now, with the elder Langleys' sudden return, this plan would collapse entirely.

"When did you hear?" Alexander steadied himself. "If they haven't left yet, I can take Baby Chloe to Canada first."

Over four months had passed since Bianca's death, and related news had long faded. But if her parents returned, they'd eventually uncover the truth.

"Just got the call," Margaret trembled. "They couldn't reach Bianca, so they contacted me. I followed the letter's instructions—said she was traveling." Tears glistened as she thought of her friend's daughter, gone forever.

Evelyn sensed the unspoken fear behind the Langleys' call—they dreaded confronting the worst possibility.

"When do they arrive?" Alexander pressed.

"They leave tomorrow. Just the two of them—no nanny or butler." Margaret massaged her temples in distress.

Alexander's voice turned resolute. "There's still time. I'll find a way to maintain the deception."
###Chapter 952: May I Have a Hug?

Margaret Hamilton furrowed her brows, her fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of her teacup. "Do you think they already suspect something? After all, blood runs thicker than water. Parents always have the sharpest intuition about their children."

Alexander Hamilton tapped the table with his knuckles in a steady rhythm. "I have an inspection scheduled at the Canadian branch next week. Since the Liang couple is only back for a family visit, I’ll take the opportunity to sound them out first. As for Bianca..."

He paused, his gaze drifting to the plane trees outside the window. Withered leaves spiraled down, a fleeting dance that mirrored Bianca Langley’s tragically short life.

Evelyn Carter gripped the armrest of the sofa. "We can’t keep this hidden forever."

Margaret’s eyes reddened. "The Liangs gave up their family legacy for their daughter. If they find out—" Her voice broke, and she pressed a handkerchief to her eyes.

"Mom, I’ll handle this," Alexander said, his tone low and resolute. "Whatever anger comes, I’ll bear it."

Margaret hesitated, then simply patted her son’s shoulder before heading upstairs. The living room was left with only the three of them and the scattered remnants of Baby Chloe’s first-birthday toys.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, stretching their shadows across the floor. Peanut, their Ragdoll cat, leaped down from the cat tree and rubbed affectionately against the baby’s ankles.

Alexander knelt to gather the toys, his movements gentle, as if handling fragile treasures. He glanced up at Evelyn. "Don’t stand for too long."

Before she realized it, he had guided her to the sofa, immediately cushioning her lower back with a plush pillow. She stared absently at his slender fingers. "When are you leaving?"

"Tomorrow," he replied, settling beside her. "I moved up the original schedule."

Evelyn frowned. "That important?"

The corner of Alexander’s mouth lifted slightly. "There’s a designer I need to poach. Highly sought-after, according to the Canadian branch."

"If the great Alexander Hamilton is going in person..." Evelyn arched a brow. "He must be quite the talent."

"Early thirties, international award winner," Alexander said, lightly tapping his knee. "Most importantly, he’s considering returning to work domestically."

Evelyn relaxed slightly against the cushions. "Then I wish the CEO a swift victory."

She knew this version of Alexander was no longer the aloof aristocrat of years past. His time in the village had taught him to see everyone as equals—a quality that made him irresistible to top talent.

The airport farewell came abruptly.

Baby Chloe clung to Peanut, her face buried in the cat’s fluffy fur. The feline flicked its tail impatiently but didn’t pull away.

Evelyn crouched to adjust the child’s collar. "Listen to Daddy, don’t eat too much ice cream, keep your distance from the TV when watching cartoons—"

She stopped abruptly, realizing how much she sounded like a nag. Emily Zade stifled a laugh nearby, shooting Alexander a knowing glance.

His gaze never left Evelyn. When the boarding announcement echoed through the terminal, he suddenly stepped forward, his voice rough. "May I have a hug?"

Without waiting for an answer, he pulled her into a gentle embrace. The familiar scent of cedarwood enveloped her, and she could feel the rapid beat of his heart against her ear.

"Just one," he murmured. "Or I won’t sleep from missing you."
###Chapter 953 There Won't Be Such a Day.

The plane roared into the sky. Alexander Hamilton leaned back in the plush first-class seat, his fingers absently tracing the cuff of his suit jacket. The fabric still held the lingering warmth from Evelyn Carter's embrace.

"Mr. Hamilton, would you like a blanket?" Emily Zade, his secretary, asked softly.

Alexander shook his head, his gaze settling on the little girl beside him. The toddler was perched on the armrest, chubby fingers playing with the seatbelt.

"Daddy." The baby suddenly looked up, her voice sweet and milky.

Warmth flooded Alexander's chest as he reached out to ruffle her fine, silky hair. He'd bought her a separate seat—no expense spared to ensure her comfort.

Outside the window, clouds churned like an ocean. But Alexander's thoughts drifted back to that farewell embrace. The faint scent of jasmine from Evelyn still seemed to cling to him.

Meanwhile, in the master bedroom of the Carter residence, Evelyn sat propped against the headboard, lost in thought. The room was so quiet she could hear the ticking of the wall clock.

"Penny for your thoughts?" Vivian Dempsey barged in, hugging a pillow before plopping onto the bed.

Evelyn snapped out of her reverie. "Nothing. Just... the house feels too quiet suddenly."

"Missing your Mr. Hamilton already?" Vivian winked mischievously. "It's only been a few hours."

The tips of Evelyn's ears warmed. She changed the subject. "How long are you staying this time? What about Grandma—"

"Relax!" Vivian waved a hand. "Dad's super attentive now—makes her special soups every day. You should've seen him yesterday, asking me how to order takeout on his smartphone!"

They shared a laugh. Then Vivian mysteriously pulled a knitted bunny from her bag. "A gift for my future goddaughter. Made it myself!"

Evelyn took the plush toy, her fingers brushing the soft fleece. "Since when did you learn to knit?"

"Recently." Vivian flopped onto the bed. "Work stress. Knitting's weirdly therapeutic. I've decided—retirement plan is opening a handicraft store."

"CEO Vivian switching careers to artisan?" Evelyn stifled a giggle.

Vivian suddenly sat bolt upright, eyes sparkling. "Actually, I have a bold idea! I'm going to find a live-in son-in-law—kids will take my surname!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her water. "You're serious?"

"Absolutely!" Vivian counted on her fingers. "Over six feet, Ivy League degree, good temper, and most importantly—must be willing to marry into my family—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn suddenly clutched her stomach, face draining of color.

"What's wrong?" Vivian rushed to steady her.

Evelyn bit her lip, beads of sweat forming at her temples. "My stomach... it hurts..."
###Chapter 954: One More Absurd Than the Last

Vivian Dempsey bolted upright in bed, fumbling for her phone. "I'm calling an ambulance!"

Evelyn Carter caught her flailing hand. "Relax. Fetal movement during the second trimester is completely normal."

Vivian collapsed back onto the mattress, clutching her chest. "You scared me to death. I almost forgot you're the expert." She suddenly leaned in closer. "Alexander still doesn't know?"

Ever since Alexander Hamilton nearly sacrificed himself saving Vivian's grandmother, she'd become his staunchest ally. These days, she looked at him with stars in her eyes, practically ready to drag him to the courthouse herself.

Evelyn rested a hand on her rounded belly. "He's probably noticed my bump is larger than average for this stage, but he hasn't asked."

"We agreed this arrangement works for now."

Vivian's eyes widened. "And you're okay with that? I thought he'd have figured out it's twins by now! Men really are useless."

A soft laugh escaped Evelyn. "It's not that he can't guess. He's waiting for me to tell him."

Vivian sucked in a sharp breath. "Your relationship dynamic... I'd have flipped the table by now!" Her expression suddenly soured. "Speaking of which, the candidates my dad set me up with are something else."

"The first one brought his mother to the 'interview.' The old lady announced she was hiring me as her daughter-in-law on the spot."

Evelyn choked.

"The second was even better—started lecturing me on how to run my company the moment we met."

"The third looked like a K-pop idol but opened with 'just bear me a son.'" Vivian rolled her eyes. "What, is there a throne waiting to be inherited?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Where does Uncle Dempsey find these specimens?"

"His old buddies' connections." Vivian looked utterly defeated. "A few more of these blind dates, and Dad will get booted from their group chat."

Now Evelyn understood why Uncle Dempsey had asked Alexander to arrange introductions.

Her phone screen lit up just then. Alexander's video call request appeared.

In the conservatory, Evelyn set aside her medical journal. The man on screen had dark circles under his eyes, a hotel room visible behind him.

"It's 3 a.m. Why aren't you asleep?"

"Just finished the meeting." Alexander adjusted the camera to reveal a sleeping baby surrounded by pillows, a smile still on the tiny face.

Evelyn's eyes grew moist. "The Langley family..."

This was the unavoidable challenge between them.

Alexander's voice remained steady. "The baby stays with us." He rubbed his temples. "Mr. and Mrs. Langley... they know now."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her shirt hem.

"Someone leaked the news to them." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Mr. Langley had a stroke but received timely treatment. As for Mrs. Langley..."

He didn't continue, but Evelyn understood. The pain of losing their only daughter wasn't something anyone could easily bear.
###Chapter 955: Too Expensive for My Budget

Alexander Hamilton stood at the Langley family's villa entrance, taking a deep breath before ringing the doorbell. In his arms, Baby Chloe slept soundly while he carried carefully selected gifts in his other hand.

The moment the door opened, the sudden noise startled the baby awake. Her wails pierced the tense silence.

Mr. and Mrs. Langley stood in the foyer, their gazes fixed on the infant whose features unmistakably resembled Vincent Croix's.

"Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Langley." Alexander fumbled to soothe the crying baby, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Mrs. Langley turned her face away, voice trembling. "Come in."

The living room's atmosphere weighed heavier than lead. Alexander alternated between calming the distressed infant and stealing cautious glances at the elderly couple.

"That child..." Mr. Langley studied the baby for a long moment before sighing. "She looks just like her mother did as a baby."

The housekeeper intervened at just the right moment, taking the baby and allowing Alexander to finally exhale.

During their video call, Evelyn Carter immediately noticed his exhaustion.

"You look terrible," she murmured.

Alexander rubbed his temples. "The Langleys are emotionally fragile, and the baby's been fussy with strangers."

Seeing the stubble shadowing his jaw on screen, Evelyn felt an unexpected tenderness. "Don't push yourself too hard."

The words gave him pause. After ending the call, he stared at the darkened screen before collapsing onto the bed in deep sleep.

Vivian Dempsey burst into Evelyn's home with hurricane force, nearly toppling the coffee table.

"What's got you so distracted?" She grabbed Evelyn's cup and gulped its contents.

Evelyn snapped to attention. "That was my jujube tea!"

"Huh?" Vivian smacked her lips. "No wonder it's so sweet."

Auntie Wu discreetly retreated to the kitchen, leaving the friends their privacy.

"Company troubles?" Evelyn detected the tension in her friend's demeanor.

Vivian flopped onto the sofa. "Don't ask. Trying to hire architects—either they charge astronomical rates or their skills don't measure up."

A thought occurred to Evelyn. "Alexander's in Canada right now scouting a designer."

"No!" Vivian waved her hands frantically. "Anyone Hamilton Group wants is way beyond Dempsey Corporation's budget."

She counted on her fingers. "Dad's return helped stabilize things, but funds are still tight. I'm planning to camp out at Hudson University and snag some graduates for internships."

Evelyn chuckled. "You've got this all figured out."

"Damn right." Vivian grinned smugly. "But if Alexander knows any reasonably priced designers, send them my way."

Her voice dropped suddenly. "Speaking of which... how are things with the Langleys?"

Evelyn's expression dimmed. "Their feelings about the baby are... complicated."

Vivian patted her shoulder. "Give it time. Hey, there's a new dessert place opening this weekend. Come with me?"

"Sure." Evelyn nodded with a smile. "But nothing too expensive—I'm on a budget."

Their shared laughter momentarily scattered the gloom.
###Chapter 956: Playing the Long Game

Poaching talent wasn't like digging up turnips. Evelyn Carter knew even with preparations, the candidate could still walk away. With no guarantees yet, she remained cautious—never making promises she couldn't keep.

Vivian Dempsey smirked. "You have too much faith in him."

"It's not faith." Evelyn pressed her lips. "Just facts. His professional competence speaks for itself."

For once, Vivian nodded. "I used to be biased against Alexander Hamilton, but even I admit two things about him are flawless—his looks and his work ethic. For this campus recruitment, I'm going personally. Anyone meeting one criterion gets an offer."

Graduation season approached. While Hudson City couldn't rival the capital, it boasted several prestigious universities. The Dempsey Group, as a reputable corporation, had no trouble securing a recruitment booth.

Evelyn chuckled. "We're not casting actors. Why prioritize looks?"

Vivian had always valued appearances, and past heartbreaks only raised her standards. Her ideal man needed both striking looks and impeccable character.

"Seeing a handsome face daily lifts my mood. If compatible, he might even become a live-in son-in-law. That'd ease Dad and Grandma's worries."

Since Grandma Dempsey's accident, the elderly woman remained open-minded. But Vivian had matured overnight, determined to reassure her family.

Understanding her friend's intent, Evelyn advised, "Don't rush this. Find someone trustworthy—no need to lose the dowry and the bride."

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Speaking of which, our high school reunion's coming up. Tenth anniversary—even overseas classmates are returning."

A decade had passed in a blink. Evelyn hesitated. "Aside from bumping into our class president, I've lost touch with everyone."

She studied Vivian's expression carefully. Had it not been for that third-place schemer, Vivian—with her family background and grades—could've soared higher.

"Maybe check the attendee list first?" Evelyn suggested tactfully. Truthfully, Vivian was well-liked; only one person needed avoiding.

Vivian saw through her concern and laughed. "Relax. Simon Stapleton was ruined by Alexander. I can't even recall his face now—wouldn't recognize him if he stood before me."

Evelyn held her gaze. "Your words. Then I won't accompany you—spares me the interrogation."

"Focus on your pregnancy." Vivian met her eyes steadily. "I can handle it."

Evelyn remained skeptical. With a month until the reunion, there was time to arrange backup through old classmates if Vivian insisted on going.

Two days later, Alexander returned unexpectedly.

Post-rain sunshine bathed the Hamilton estate's garden in gentle light, the air fragrant with greenery. Breathing deeply by the newly installed swing, Evelyn heard footsteps.

"Off work early?" Assuming it was Vivian, she teased without turning.

"Missed you, so came home first." The deep voice startled her.

Alexander's smiling face greeted her when she turned. He wasn't due back for two more days.

"Wrapped things up ahead of schedule. Left Emily to handle the rest and brought Baby Chloe home." He glossed over the Langley parents' grief. "They didn't blame her, but... couldn't bear to care for her."

Evelyn understood the unspoken truth. For grandparents mourning their daughter, a granddaughter carrying their enemy's blood made kinship unbearably painful.
###Chapter 957: Decisive Action

Evelyn stood by the window, her fingertips lightly tracing the window frame. The post-rain air carried the scent of damp earth, but it couldn’t dispel the gloom in her heart.

It was better to give this child a complete home now than to let them grow up in an oppressive environment. This thought had lingered in her mind for a long time, and today, she finally made her decision.

"I understand what you mean." She turned around, forcing a faint smile. Alexander's gaze was too tender, making it unbearable for her to add to his burdens.

Baby Chloe babbled and waved her tiny hands in the stroller, kicking excitedly when she saw Evelyn. Evelyn bent down to pick her up but paused when her rounded belly got in the way.

"Let me." Alexander swiftly scooped up the child and took Evelyn’s hand, leading her inside. His palm was warm, but the exhaustion in his whitened knuckles was unmistakable.

The dim light inside revealed the dark circles under his eyes. "How long has it been since you slept?" Her voice tightened involuntarily.

Alexander instinctively touched his chin, where stubble remained. "I dozed on the plane," he said casually, but the hoarseness in his voice betrayed him.

Evelyn’s gaze shifted between the baby’s rosy cheeks and his haggard face. She knew him too well—this man had poured all his energy into caring for their child while pushing himself past his limits.

"Go upstairs and rest." She took the baby from him, her fingers brushing against his cold hand. "I’ll take care of Chloe."

Alexander opened his mouth to protest but was cut off by a yawn. Rubbing his temples, he reluctantly headed upstairs.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure disappear around the staircase, a pang of sorrow tightening her chest. She looked down at the baby in her arms. "Did you miss Mommy?"

Chloe giggled, grabbing at Evelyn’s hair and kicking her tiny feet happily. Evelyn kissed the top of her soft head and carried her to the nursery.

After her bath, Chloe quickly fell asleep to the lullaby Evelyn hummed. Evelyn tiptoed out of the room, only to realize Alexander wasn’t in the bedroom or the study.

The sound of running water from the bathroom caught her attention. She knocked, but there was no answer.

When she pushed the door open, her blood ran cold. Alexander lay back in the bathtub, the water already rising to his collarbone. The faucet continued to pour in a steady stream.

"Alexander!" She rushed forward and turned off the tap. Cold water splashed onto her skirt, but she barely noticed.

Alexander jolted awake, water sloshing. "What time is it?" His voice was rough, his eyes still dazed.

"You nearly drowned yourself!" Her voice trembled as her fingers clenched the edge of the tub.

Only then did Alexander fully wake, scrambling for a towel to wrap around his waist. Water droplets slid down his taut abdomen, pooling on the tiles.

Evelyn’s gaze lingered on the slight hunch of his back. "Your lumbar spine—" Her professional instinct made her blurt it out.

Alexander froze, his ears turning red. He hastily dried himself, only to find Evelyn’s face paler than his own.

"Do you have plans tonight?" Evelyn asked, forcing composure.

Alexander wiped his face. "The new director arrives tonight." He checked his watch, his brow furrowing. "This partnership is crucial for overseas expansion. I can’t cancel."

His fingers trembled slightly as he adjusted his tie. Evelyn stepped forward and took over, deftly straightening it for him. "Go," she said softly. "I’ll hold down the fort."

Alexander gripped her hand, as if wanting to say something, but in the end, he only gave it a firm squeeze. As he turned to leave, his figure hesitated at the doorway—but he didn’t look back.
###Chapter 958: The Best Male Friend

Alexander ran his long fingers through his tousled hair, pushing the stray strands back to reveal his smooth forehead. A sudden memory made his lips curve upward. "By the way, we hit it off in Canada. Turns out he's actually from Hudson City."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "A fellow hometown boy? No wonder you managed to recruit him."

"Not just that." His deep eyes flickered with amusement, but the thought of the man's equally impressive career and striking looks set off alarm bells. He abruptly changed tack. "He hasn't been back in the country for years."

The clumsy pivot didn't escape her. "That's not what you were going to say, is it? Don't tell me it's someone I know?"

The bathroom fell silent except for the sound of running water.

Evelyn's eyes widened slightly. "Who is it?"

She racked her brain but couldn't recall knowing any architects.

Alexander pressed his lips together in frustration. "Victor Laurent. A year older than you. Went to Hudson High School but transferred abroad during senior year. You might've been classmates."

"Victor as in 'knowledgeable,' Laurent as in 'restraint'?" Her words tumbled out. "Tall, with a mole near his eye, fair-skinned?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Everything except the last part."

A sudden spark lit her eyes as she laughed. "We weren't just classmates—we shared the same homeroom. Top of the class, well-off family. Then he vanished overseas senior year without so much as a goodbye."

Mid-year transfers were rare enough to cause a stir, though the gossip was soon eclipsed by Vivian failing her college entrance exams.

The memory darkened Evelyn's expression. "If Victor had stayed, maybe Vivian wouldn't have had such a hard time. He was her best male friend. Period."

Alexander's voice tightened. "Were you two close?"

He was already regretting bringing Victor back. Ivy League pedigree, exceptional skills, seamless collaboration—none of it mattered now that "Evelyn's old friend" had entered the equation.

The steamy bathroom was making her lightheaded. Watching his jealous scowl, she braced herself against the sink with a laugh. "You're not seriously jealous of Victor, are you?"

He looked away, noticing her discomfort, and immediately moved to support her. "Let's get you somewhere cooler."

Fresh air helped. His expression remained tense, prompting another chuckle. "Just a bit stuffy in there. You look like I'm about to deliver any second."

"During my residency, I saw plenty of expectant fathers in the waiting room. Some looked ready to cry—it made even me nervous."

"What about the ones who weren't nervous?"

With just over four months until her due date, he needed to prepare.

Settling onto the sofa, she reminisced. "Some brought flowers and gifts. Others got so dizzy they nearly passed out. A few played video games right outside the delivery room..."

Hospital corridors had witnessed every emotion, though doctors could only observe.

His brow furrowed. "How could anyone focus on games while their wife was in labor?"

She smiled faintly. "Would panicking help? Childbirth is a woman's battle. As long as men don't make it harder, flowers and games are equally meaningless to me."

Not yet thirty, she'd already seen through life's illusions. With Alexander, she kept expectations low to avoid disappointment.

A long silence ended with his sigh. He had no rebuttal.

"I've reserved a private suite near your due date. Just come through safely." His omission of the baby spoke volumes.

Warmth bloomed in her chest. She could tell he meant it, even if the decision pained him.

"Relax. 'Mother or child' scenarios only happen in soap operas."

The words snapped him to full alert. He finished getting ready with military precision, as though he'd never been jet-lagged.

Calculating his brief nap in the tub, she worried about overwork. "Emily's still in Canada. Is Henry accompanying you to dinner tonight?"
###Chapter 959: A Fatal Encounter with a Straightforward Player

The Hamilton Group employed thousands, yet only a handful could enter Alexander Hamilton's inner circle. Evelyn Carter could count them on one hand. The secretarial department performed their duties meticulously—overtime and accompanying the boss to business dinners were never part of their contracts.

"Just Victor Laurent and me," Alexander murmured, his fingers tracing the rim of his teacup. "A simple dinner to discuss the project. No alcohol."

His stomach condition hadn't flared up in months, but constant travel had weakened his immunity. Evelyn knew all too well how dangerous a relapse could be in this state.

"Perfect." She set down the medical chart. "I should catch up with this old classmate of mine anyway."

As Alexander's brow furrowed, she wiggled her ring finger, the diamond catching the light. "A five-month baby bump is obvious even to the blind. If the great Alexander Hamilton gets jealous over this, you’re being unreasonable."

Only they knew about the "divorced" status on their household register. To outsiders, she was the picture of marital bliss—a glowing expectant mother.

"I’ll try." His Adam's apple bobbed before inspiration struck. "Vivian Dempsey has been keeping you company lately, hasn’t she? Invite her along. Consider it my thanks."

Evelyn smirked. "Sure. It’ll give Victor an out. Disappearing without a goodbye back then—this reunion must be excruciatingly awkward."

Alexander knew she saw right through him. Since Evelyn’s pregnancy, her gentle resilience had become even more captivating, fueling his irrational fear that someone might steal her away.

He dialed Vivian immediately. Keyboard clacks echoed through the receiver. "Alexander? Weren’t you in Vancouver?"

"Back now. With a blast from your past," he teased.

When "Victor Laurent" left his lips, Vivian’s shriek nearly shattered his eardrum. "That bastard dares show his face?! Vanished into thin air years ago, and now he waltzes back like nothing happened?!"

Alexander grinned, rattled off the restaurant address, and hung up. Turning, he found Evelyn struggling to slip on her shoes, one hand supporting her lower back.

He dropped to one knee, cradling her swollen ankle—pregnancy had softened its once-slender curve. Evelyn used to blush at such attentiveness; now, she’d grown accustomed to this man’s devotion.

The French restaurant, booked by his secretaries, exuded understated elegance. Lattice screens created intimate nooks, floor-to-ceiling windows framing the city’s glittering skyline. By the window sat Victor, his tailored suit a far cry from the school uniform of memory.

Only the tear mole at his eye corner confirmed his identity.

"Vivian’s best friend!" Victor sprang up, his gaze snagging on her belly. "I never thought you’d—"

"Long story." Evelyn deftly redirected. Her lilac dress draped softly over the gentle swell.

Alexander handed her a cushion with practiced ease, as if he’d rehearsed the motion a thousand times. Victor gaped. "The rumors did you dirty, Alexander. They paint you as unlucky in love, but you’re clearly winning at life."

"You and Vivian deserve each other," Alexander muttered, his temple throbbing.

One asked brazen questions; the other gave blunt answers. Their sheer audacity was downright criminal.
###Chapter 960: Calling Each Other "Dad"

Victor Laurent completely missed the probing tone in Alexander Hamilton's words. He answered earnestly, "Vivian Dempsey and I were comrades-in-arms. We sat front and back from middle school through high school, seeing each other every single day. How could we not be close?"

At the mention of Vivian, the corners of his lips lifted unconsciously, and his eyes brightened.

Evelyn Carter was also drawn into the memory, her gaze softening. "You two weren't just weathering hardships together—you were partners in crime. I still remember that Monday flag-raising ceremony when the principal made you both read your self-criticizations under the national flag, arms still in casts. What a spectacle that was."

Though the memory had yellowed with time, the absurdities of their youth remained vivid.

Alexander disliked feeling left out and deliberately interjected, "A top student like you wrote self-criticizations, Mr. Laurent?"

Victor's academic record was impeccable. No one would guess he'd ever been rebellious. Evelyn nearly laughed out loud at Alexander's praise.

Victor waved his hands hastily. "Please don't say that, Mr. Hamilton. Overseas, where no one knows me, I might have the nerve to accept such flattery. But in front of an old classmate? I'd die of embarrassment!"

His tone was so casual, as if he'd merely gone abroad for a vacation. Evelyn asked curiously, "Weren't you in Canada the whole time?"

"Not at all. I moved to Australia with my parents during high school for their jobs, did my master's in Europe, and only started working in Canada this year. But after six months, I wanted to come back—so here I am." Victor spoke as if he'd simply transferred schools a few times.

Having studied in Europe herself, Evelyn felt exhausted just hearing about it. "You've practically toured every continent."

Alexander picked up on something. "Were you deliberately avoiding returning to the country before, Mr. Laurent?"

Victor adjusted his glasses, his wheat-colored skin glowing healthily under the light. "Not deliberately. It just happened that way."

"By the way, about that self-criticism—I should clarify." He abruptly changed the subject, his expression animated. "I got in trouble for beating up some bullies who were picking on others—"

Mid-sentence, he froze, his gaze locking onto something behind Evelyn. He shot to his feet. "Vivian Dempsey!"

His shout drew the attention of the entire restaurant.

Vivian squirmed under the stares but, having already arrived, had no choice but to walk over. "Was that necessary? I'm just here to eat."

She took a seat across from Evelyn, sizing Victor up. "I heard an old classmate was back. Had to come see for myself."

Victor's hands trembled slightly, his voice unsteady. "I didn’t expect to see you here."

He slowly sank back into his chair, his eyes never leaving Vivian's face. "I should’ve thought this through. You and Evelyn are so close—of course you’d come if she did."

Vivian waved a hand dismissively. "Not everyone’s as heartless as you, vanishing without a word when you transferred."

"I’m sorry." Victor's gaze was tender. "It was all so sudden. By the time I thought to exchange contact info, I was already in Australia."

He hadn’t attended a single class reunion in all these years, severing ties completely.

Vivian merely said, "Oh."

Stung by her indifference, Victor fell silent, unable to tear his eyes away. "You’ve changed so much."

Alexander noticed his expression and instantly understood. His earlier hostility evaporated.

Evelyn laughed, trying to lighten the mood. "Enough pretending. Who was it that called me crying in the middle of the night, complaining about a heartless friend who left without saying goodbye? Well, here they are. Say what you need to say."

Victor’s eyes lit up. "She really said that?"

When Evelyn nodded, he grinned triumphantly at Vivian. "Since you’re being so sentimental, let’s call it even on our old bet. Just call me 'godfather' and we’re good!"

Alexander, who’d been pouring water, nearly spilled it on the menu. He stared at Evelyn, utterly baffled by the term.

Evelyn calmly steadied the cup. "Didn’t all you boys in middle school love calling each other 'dad'?"
###Chapter 961: Sharing This Original Sin

Teenage boys always have an exhausting amount of energy. During their school days, some inexplicable trend emerged where the closest friends stopped calling each other by name and instead started claiming to be each other’s fathers.

"I don’t think... I ever did that," Alexander Hamilton mused, searching his memory. All he recalled was people calling him "Alex."

Evelyn Carter paused, then laughed. "Oh right, you went to that elite private school. Those kids probably didn’t play those kinds of games."

Ordinary private schools might resemble public ones, but Alexander’s was different. It catered to the children of the most powerful families, its very architecture exuding an air of exclusivity. Naturally, such down-to-earth antics had no place there. Now, sitting with three old classmates, he felt distinctly out of place.

"Back then, I was entirely focused on my studies," he said smoothly. "My path was already mapped out."

He knew Evelyn too well—knew she admired driven, ambitious people. His tone was casual, but there was an unmistakable peacock-like pride in it, as if he were preening for her approval.

In the past, Vivian Dempsey would’ve rolled her eyes. But now, he was the man who’d saved her grandmother. She could only pretend not to notice, turning instead to Victor Laurent. "You can’t even remember my phone number, but you remember this?"

"You were the one who made the bet with me," Victor replied, his eyes crinkling with amusement.

"That year, there was a gang of thugs extorting students outside the school," Vivian said, her temper flaring at the memory. "They specifically targeted freshmen. The school sent security patrols, but those cowards hid in alleyways, waiting to ambush kids. Once, they even stole a scholarship from a poor student in our class!"

Her fists clenched. If they weren’t in a restaurant, she would’ve slammed the table.

"Looking back, we didn’t hit them hard enough! Who did they think they were, demanding protection money? Too bad the baseball bats we had were cheap junk."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "I’ve heard a joke about a country where they sold thousands of baseball bats but only a handful of actual baseballs. You weren’t in that situation, were you?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, amused. "That night during study hall, Vivian said she was going for a walk. The next day, I found out she’d gone out to fight."

Victor chimed in, "I used the excuse of going to the bathroom. Guess we were on the same wavelength."

"Please!" Vivian scoffed. "You snuck out right after dinner to hide in the equipment room! You even climbed through a window to steal a bat. If you hadn’t prepared in advance, we would’ve had to fight them barehanded! But we still won!"

She was practically glowing as she recounted the story, none of her post-work exhaustion visible. Victor stared at her profile, her baby fat long gone, and for a moment, he was lost in thought.

"There were two of us against over a dozen. We got banged up, but someone called the police, and they arrested the whole gang." Vivian grew more animated as she spoke. "We even got the stolen money back!"

Evelyn sighed. "A broken arm is a minor injury? Thank God it was your left one, or you would’ve fallen behind in your studies."

"Mine was my right arm!" Victor immediately protested.

Vivian shot back, "You’re left-handed. What’s the problem?"

"I’m ambidextrous!" he declared. "I could’ve spun a pen while solving equations. Now, I don’t even have the right study atmosphere."

"Stop inflating your ego—" Vivian launched into a list of his past embarrassments.

Alexander, the outsider, had nothing to contribute. Even Evelyn, who’d been in the same class, could only watch helplessly. She picked up the gilded menu. "If we don’t order soon, the owner’s going to kick us out."

Only then did the two settle down.

Alexander had never been to this restaurant before, but since Victor had gone from being a company director to just an old classmate, he relaxed. "You order first. They don’t seem hungry."

Evelyn was hungry. Pregnancy had made her ravenous. She flipped through the menu decisively. "Orange-glazed ribs. Cream of asparagus soup."

"Last time at the French restaurant, you ordered salmon salad," Alexander remarked offhandedly. "Your tastes change so fast, it’s like you’re carrying twins."

Her fingers twitched, gripping the napkin tighter. "Add a mint salmon salad, then."

The truth about the twins couldn’t stay hidden forever. But lately, she’d been having nightmares—dreams where the little girl she’d lost had taken on a clear form. To ensure this child returned safely, she’d decided to keep the secret until the birth.

Some things were better known by fewer people. Especially Alexander—as the father, they should have shared this burden of guilt together.
###Chapter 962: Alexander, Your Good Deeds Are Immeasurable

Alexander Hamilton immediately noticed the subtle shift in Evelyn Carter's expression.

He set down the menu at once, his gaze filled with concern.

Evelyn quickly took a sip of water, her fingers lightly tapping the glass. "If you don't order soon, Vivian will beat you to it."

Alexander snapped back to attention. "I'll have the same as you, but swap the salmon for pan-seared foie gras with scallops."

When the menu reached Victor Laurent, he effortlessly leaned in with Vivian to browse through it.

After placing their orders, he smoothly signaled the waiter with practiced ease.

Vivian raised an eyebrow, studying him. "The same guy who used to skip class to play games has turned into quite the gentleman."

"Evelyn said the same thing." Victor smiled, though a hint of melancholy flickered in his eyes.

Vivian, oblivious to his mood, focused on the teardrop mole under his left eye. "This mole hasn't changed, but you've gotten much tanner. Do those contact lenses bother you?"

She remembered how Victor used to mistake people without his glasses—once even confusing the principal for a janitor.

Victor suddenly leaned closer. "So, what do you think of the new look? Handsome, right?"

Vivian's silence was deafening.

Alexander and Evelyn simultaneously picked up their water glasses, watching the amusing pair with interest.

Victor, indignant, pulled out his phone. "I had a whole drawer full of love letters overseas."

"That's only because they never saw you in high school." Vivian counted on her fingers. "The girl next door brought you breakfast for a month, and you—what did you do? Calculated every penny and transferred the money back."

Victor was speechless. Then, abruptly changing the subject, he drawled, "Speaking of which, before I left, you and that..."

He deliberately trailed off, pretending to search his memory.

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat, but just as she was about to interrupt, the waiter arrived with their food.

The elegant plating of French cuisine instantly crowded the table.

Vivian's grip on her fork tightened slightly, her gaze distant.

Alexander, sensing the shift in atmosphere, smoothly redirected the conversation. "Have you visited the project site yet, Mr. Laurent?"

"I went just the other day." Victor seized the topic. "It's remote, but the environment is excellent. The villagers kept saying how grateful they were for your investment—that it was a true act of charity."

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Are you talking about Greenwood Village?"

She set down her utensils, eagerly joining the discussion.

Victor suddenly understood. "You must be the Dr. Carter the village elder always mentions?"

"How is the elder's health?" Evelyn's voice carried a note of regret. "I promised to stay for a year, but..."

Alexander gently took her hand under the table.

Victor nudged Vivian repeatedly with his foot, but she simply rested her chin on her hand, watching the couple's interlaced fingers with a knowing smile.

"Hey!" Victor finally elbowed her.

Vivian popped a shrimp into her mouth. "You'll get used to it. They do this all the time."

Victor scratched his head in frustration but couldn't bring himself to ask outright.

Evelyn was already enthusiastically describing the village's customs, even vividly recounting details of the temple fair.

Seeing her absorbed, Alexander quietly took her steak and began cutting it into bite-sized pieces.
###Chapter 963: Stepsiblings by Different Parents

Evelyn Carter had specifically requested her orange-glazed ribs to be well-done. The thick steak glistened under the lights, coated in a rich citrus sauce.

Alexander Hamilton's slender fingers gripped the knife and fork with practiced elegance. He methodically sliced the steak into uniform pieces, the blade gliding through the meat without a sound.

"Here you go." He gently pushed the plate toward Evelyn.

Victor Laurent stared in awe. This wasn't just steak-cutting—it was a masterclass in precision craftsmanship.

"Was it your medical team that Elder Thompson mentioned?" Victor blurted out. "I heard all the village investments and construction projects were spearheaded by that doctor's husband."

Evelyn lowered her head, spearing a piece of steak as if she hadn't heard.

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "The villagers took good care of us, especially the two children who helped tremendously. Giving back was only natural."

"That's quite the generous payback." Victor chuckled. "An investment that size could dam a river."

Vivian Dempsey's stiletto came down hard on Victor's foot.

"Gah—" He sucked in a sharp breath, nearly leaping from his chair.

Alexander feigned concern. "Are you unwell, Mr. Laurent? Evelyn could examine you."

"It's nothing," Victor gritted out. "Just... overwhelmed by tasting hometown flavors again."

Vivian arched a brow. "Which dish here can't you get abroad?"

"Same ingredients, different essence." Victor's gaze burned into her. "Like dating—local tastes are superior."

She completely missed his implication. "Free tomorrow? Join me for drinks. Evelyn's abstaining, Alexander's driving—that leaves you."

Alexander rose smoothly. "We'll take our leave."

In the car, he broke the silence. "Victor's in love with Vivian."

"What?" Evelyn nearly choked. "They haven't seen each other in ten years!"

"His eyes tell a different story." Alexander turned the steering wheel. "Like a long-game predator."

Evelyn frowned. "They were practically siblings. Vivian even collected love letters for him—he always glared at her suitors."

"Exactly the problem." Alexander's low laugh held knowing. "Since when do brothers seethe over their sister's admirers?"

Evelyn froze. The rearview mirror reflected Alexander's ocean-deep gaze.

Suddenly, those "accidentally" misplaced letters made sense. Those suspiciously timed coincidences placing Victor near Vivian.

Some seeds were planted long before anyone noticed the roots.
###Chapter 964 Everyone Changes

Evelyn pondered for a long time, her fingertips lightly tapping the car window edge. "When Vivian was being relentlessly pursued by that third-place guy, Victor happened to be abroad. What was he really thinking... I can't figure it out."

Alexander gripped the steering wheel, the corner of his mouth lifting. "Now I understand why you and Vivian became best friends."

"We've known each other for years, of course—" Evelyn cut herself off mid-sentence and turned to glare at him. "Are you implying I'm as oblivious as she is?"

Soft prenatal music filled the car as sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating her slightly flushed earlobes.

Alexander kept his eyes on the road, his smile deepening. "You said it, not me."

Evelyn turned away but couldn't suppress the smile tugging at her lips.

——

The whiskey bottle was more than half empty in the restaurant.

Vivian swirled the ice ball in her glass, challenging the man across the table. "What, scared? Who was it that claimed they could drink anyone under the table?"

Victor stared at the overflowing glass before him, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Are you trying to kill me?"

His knife made a precise cut through the sea bass, sending parsley flakes trembling.

"Stop whining!" Vivian downed her drink in one gulp and slammed the empty glass on the table. "You disappeared without a word back then, and now you won't even drink with me?"

Victor took a deep breath, lifted the glass, and drained it. The alcohol burned his throat as he thumped the glass down. "I was wrong to leave. I'll take my punishment."

A memory flashed—a summer night on the rooftop. Two high schoolers secretly sharing a can of beer. He'd blacked out, only to wake up covered by a school jacket, Vivian curled beside him clutching the half-finished can.

"I remember that night," Victor's voice turned hoarse. "You stayed with me the whole time so I wouldn't be alone."

Vivian scoffed. "You were such a lightweight—one beer and you were out. What if some stray cat dragged you away?"

As the alcohol took effect, Victor's gaze grew hazy. "Things were simpler then. Our biggest worry was midterm rankings."

He suddenly looked up, eyes red-rimmed. "Why do people have to change?"

Vivian swirled her glass, ice cubes clinking. "Like how I loved sweet milk as a kid, then got hooked on coffee, and now prefer whiskey. People grow up."

Victor studied her for a long moment before breaking into a grin. "Is this your way of comforting me?"

The smile hadn't fully formed before he pitched forward.

"Hey!" Vivian grabbed at him but only caught his sleeve.

With a dull thud, Victor's forehead hit the table.

She poked his cheek. "Quit faking. I can't carry you."

Only steady snores answered.

Sighing, she massaged her temples while surveying the drunken mess before her. Outside, the setting sun stretched their shadows long across the floor.
###Chapter 965: Riches Are Common, True Hearts Are Rare

Vivian Dempsey stood outside the restaurant clutching her phone. The night breeze sobered her up instantly.

A terrible realization hit her—she had no idea where Victor Laurent lived!

Evelyn Carter had just stepped through her front door when her phone rang. After hearing Vivian's plea, she chuckled and approached Alexander Hamilton, who was playing with their cat. "Do you know Victor's current address?"

Alexander paused mid-air with the cat food can, brow furrowing. "Why do you ask?"

"Vivian's in a real bind," Evelyn explained, phone wedged between her ear and shoulder as she stroked Peanut. "She can call a designated driver, but they need a destination. These two have been like this since childhood—some things never change."

Alexander shook his head ruefully. "The company offered him employee housing, but he declined, saying he'd already rented a place." He added, "HR should have it on file, but at this hour..."

Vivian's wail came through the phone: "What sin did I commit in my past life to be stuck with this nuisance now?"

Listening to her best friend's lament, Evelyn suddenly remembered something. "Did you bring your IDs?"

Three seconds of silence.

"We're screwed." Vivian's voice dripped with despair.

Meanwhile, Victor slept soundly, face planted on the table. Vivian angrily tugged his ear, only for him to roll over and trap her wrist beneath his cheek. When she finally freed herself, a red mark circled her skin.

Take him home? Vivian immediately pictured her father and grandmother's delighted faces—

"That's Victor Laurent! The bespectacled boy who visited often in high school!"

"What a coincidence! Let's invite his parents for dinner tomorrow!"

Vivian shuddered violently.

"Worst case, we could—" Evelyn began, but Vivian cut in decisively: "I'll dump him in the car and go get my ID myself!"

Before hanging up, Evelyn heard a waiter panting in the background.

When Vivian returned sweating, she found Alexander leaning against his car waiting.

"Evelyn was worried," he said simply. "Never leave a drunk alone. Our place."

Tears nearly sprang to Vivian's eyes. Alexander hoisted Victor into the car single-handedly, effortless as carrying a sack of rice.

At the Hamilton estate, Vivian still looked shaken. "I thought he built up tolerance abroad! Who knew one drink would knock him out?"

Evelyn poked her forehead. "Forgot your hospitalization last year from client dinners?"

Vivian immediately turned playful, begging for mercy. Watching her, Evelyn recalled Alexander's words during the drive.

What if... Victor truly had feelings for Vivian?

"Vivian, actually—"

"Stop!" Vivian reacted like a scalded cat. "Me and Victor? I'd rather go on blind dates!"

Evelyn swallowed her words. She knew better than anyone—the Dempsey family needed not just a son-in-law, but genuine love.

Meanwhile, in the guest room, Victor turned in his sleep, lips curving slightly as if dreaming something sweet.
###Chapter 966: Freeing Herself and Alexander

Evelyn Carter gazed at the ice cubes swirling in her glass, fingertips lightly tapping the crystal surface. She hadn't intended to meddle in Vivian Dempsey's love life, but seeing her best friend agonize over blind dates made her impulsively mention Victor Laurent's name.

Regret instantly flooded her.

"Sorry." Evelyn set down her drink, leaving a ring of condensation on the table. "I shouldn't interfere."

Vivian burst out laughing and pinched her cheek. "Since when does Dr. Carter stand on ceremony? Keep this up, and I'll tell Alexander exactly how many little miracles you're carrying."

Warm summer air drifted across the terrace. Evelyn's baby bump was unmistakable now, the flowing nightgown unable to conceal its gentle curve.

"Stop." She gently swatted Vivian's hand away. "These two are particularly active today. Their kicks are bruising my ribs."

Alexander Hamilton never missed his nightly ritual of massaging her swollen ankles, no matter how late he worked. The sight of those elegant fingers carefully avoiding her stretch marks always made her heart flutter.

Vivian swirled her wine before turning serious. "You're right though. Victor is actually a decent option."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "What changed your mind?"

"Because..." Vivian downed her drink in one gulp. "I finally understand why you refuse to remarry Alexander."

Starlight caught in Evelyn's lashes, casting delicate shadows. Her whisper blended with the city's distant glow. "How is what we have now any different from being married?"

"Then why not just—"

"Because that certificate means nothing to me." Evelyn cut her off. "A marriage license is just a gilded cage—easy to enter, impossible to escape. I just want to breathe."

Vivian nearly dropped her glass. "What did Alexander do now?"

"He's perfect." Evelyn's hand drifted over her belly, lips curving unconsciously. "Terrifyingly perfect."

Behind the floor-to-ceiling windows, Alexander stood frozen with their sleeping daughter. The toddler nuzzled his shoulder, murmuring drowsily, "Daddy..."

He took a steadying breath and carried her toward the terrace.

"Someone misses her mommy." His voice was softer than the night breeze.

Evelyn turned. Moonlight etched his profile in silver. In that moment, she realized some shackles had been fastened long ago—without either of them noticing.
###Chapter 967: A Father Adoring His Daughter

The summer breeze drifted across the terrace, carrying the faint herbal scent of the newly added wicker furniture. Evelyn Carter and Vivian Dempsey sat chatting while Alexander Hamilton stood nearby, cradling the baby, his tall frame striking against the night sky.

"Why hasn't the baby fallen asleep yet?" Evelyn glanced up, her fingers lightly tracing the gentle curve of her belly.

Alexander set the child down and leaned against the railing. "This little one's been wild lately—sleeping all day, wide awake at night." Though his tone was exasperated, his eyes brimmed with adoration, the very picture of a doting father.

Vivian's face lit up as she crouched to wave at the baby. "Baby Chloe, remember me?" Her voice dripped with sugary sweetness.

The baby blinked her large, grape-like eyes and chirped, "Auntie!"

"No, no," Vivian corrected quickly. "Call me sister. I'm not married yet!"

The child tilted her head, then suddenly clapped her hands. "Then I'm a sister too!"

The adults stifled laughter. Vivian wiped tears of amusement. "Yes, yes, you're the little sister. But your baby brother or sister is still in Mommy's tummy."

Alexander's smile faltered. It struck him that while he'd arranged full postpartum care for Evelyn, he'd forgotten to prepare supplies for their unborn child.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn noticed his shift immediately.

His expression softened. "I just realized how irresponsible I've been—I haven't even bought baby essentials yet."

Evelyn chuckled. "Did you think I wouldn't notice? The nursery is nearly finished." She pointed to the sunlit room on the first floor. "Right next to Chloe's."

His ears tinged pink. "You knew?" He added hastily, "Don't go in yet. Even with eco-friendly materials, it needs another month to air out."

Seizing the moment, Vivian pressed a finger to her lips and tiptoed away.

"Vivian's been visiting often lately," Evelyn remarked, eyeing the empty chair. "Even Peanut recognizes her now." She turned to Alexander. "Sit and rest for a while. Aunt Margaret would worry if she saw you like this."

He settled across from her, exhaustion etched clearly on his face in the dim light. They sat in comfortable silence, the hum of summer insects filling the air.

"Evelyn." His voice was tender as morning dew.

"Hmm?"

"Let's visit the temple in the suburbs this weekend." He paused. "I... had a memorial lamp placed there."

Understanding dawned in her eyes. She nodded gently. "Okay."

At dawn, Victor Laurent awoke to a splitting headache. He stared blankly at the unfamiliar ceiling, his last memory being a drinking contest with Vivian the previous night.

"Where am I?" Rubbing his temples, he sat up and found all his belongings neatly arranged on the bedside table.

Stepping into the opulent hallway deepened his confusion. Just then, Alexander returned from his morning jog, a towel slung over his shoulder, breathing evenly.

"Good morning, Mr. Laurent." Alexander's tone was neutral. "You were intoxicated last night. Since Ms. Dempsey couldn't take you home, we accommodated you here."

Victor flushed crimson. To make such a disgraceful first impression before officially starting his job—was his career over before it began?

Fortunately, Alexander said no more, simply inviting him to breakfast. Victor followed stiffly, each step filled with trepidation.
###Chapter 968: Someone Finally Notices the Anomaly

Margaret Hamilton nearly dropped her chopsticks when Vivian Dempsey appeared at the Hamilton family breakfast table. The familiar face usually only showed up for dinner—this unexpected morning visit left both matriarchs exchanging bewildered glances. They'd been playing mahjong at the Andersons' until midnight, oblivious to the household's latest developments.

Grace Anderson, more acquainted with Vivian, was the first to break the ice with a teasing smile. "This young man looks quite dashing. Is he your boyfriend?"

Victor Laurent stiffened under the scrutiny of unfamiliar elders, his smile frozen like ice. Remembering how she'd gotten him drunk last night, Vivian intervened with sudden conscience. "Aunt Grace, you've got it wrong. He's definitely not my boyfriend. Take a closer look—maybe you'll recognize him?"

Evelyn Carter pressed her lips together, amused but silent. Victor stared at Grace for a long moment before his face lit up with realization. "You're Evelyn's mother! That parent-teacher conference—I'd have been lost without your directions."

Grace studied the tear-shaped mole near his eye as memories surfaced. "Victor! You were the one who guided me that time..."

Margaret finally connected the dots—this was her daughter's classmate. Her gaze flickered toward Alexander Hamilton, bracing for another jealous outburst. Yet her son remained absorbed in peeling a boiled egg for Evelyn, not even glancing up.

The unusual scene made Margaret pause. When she noticed how Victor's flustered eyes kept darting toward Vivian, understanding dawned—unrequited affection at play.

Regaining his usual vivacity, Victor gestured dramatically. "Blame Vivian for challenging me to that drinking contest. Who knew she'd built such tolerance?"

Vivian swallowed her wonton and fired back. "The future design director of Hamilton Group can't hold his liquor? How will you manage business dinners?"

Learning this was the designer Alexander had personally recruited from Canada, Margaret perked up with interest. Victor charmed the table with witty professional anecdotes, easing the atmosphere further.

"Need a ride?" Victor shamelessly sidled up as Vivian prepared to leave.

"Thanks to you, my car's still parked outside the restaurant!"

"Perfect chance to split cab fare then."

Alexander smoothly intercepted the bickering pair. "I'll drive you." Though still slightly pale, he looked markedly better than the previous night. His lingering gaze toward Evelyn as they left carried an intangible veil between them.

Victor observed everything. Only after settling into Vivian's car did he casually probe, "About Alexander and Evelyn..."

"That's a whole soap opera." Vivian turned the steering wheel. "You'll find out after joining the company."

Two intersections later, Vivian suddenly braked. "Wait—where do you live?"

"The Four Seasons." The address was barely two blocks from Dempsey Tower. Vivian burst out laughing. "And here I thought you'd already scouted the Andersons' neighborhood."

She adjusted the wheel, her tone softening with nostalgia. "Never pictured you as an architect. Back in art class, you always sketched those bizarre blueprints..."

Victor's eyes sparkled. "You remember that? What did you study at Peking U—"

The car plunged into silence, broken only by the AC's hum.

Victor's voice dropped as he realized his misstep. "Did...the college entrance exams not go well?"

Vivian's grip tightened on the wheel as she forced a smile and changed the subject. "If you need housing leads, I can ask around. There are new developments near Hamilton Group..."

Sunlight streamed through the windows, stinging their eyes.
###Chapter 969: No Guarantees

Avoiding a topic is fundamentally different from casual conversation.

Victor Laurent immediately sensed Vivian Dempsey's reluctance to revisit the past. Suppressing his curiosity, he shifted to sharing updates about his own life.

Perhaps letting her know about his journey these years wouldn't be a bad idea.

"Even after being away for so long, this place will always be home. I haven't forgotten basic skills like apartment hunting—it's just that living in hotels became routine after work. My parents settled in Australia and have no plans to move here."

Victor genuinely saw nothing wrong with hotel living. Without family, even the finest house is just an empty shell.

To him, a home and a house were never the same.

Misinterpreting his situation as loneliness, Vivian impulsively declared, "Why stand on ceremony with me? Leave the apartment hunt to me!"

Victor almost mentioned his long-term hotel lease but caught himself. "Alright, I'll await your good news," he said instead.

True to her decisive nature, Vivian had everything arranged within a day.

On Friday evening, she rushed straight from work to his hotel, whisking him off to the new apartment while enthusiastically detailing the neighborhood.

"Without a local driver's license, you can't buy a car yet. This building is under fifteen minutes' walk to Hamilton Group. By the way, I hear only management works overtime there now—which category are you in?"

"Likely the overtime category," Victor replied with unmistakable anticipation. "I'm back for good, and this first project must succeed."

Recognizing his determination, Vivian shot him a sympathetic look. "I give it a week before you change your mind."

Puzzled, Victor asked, "Why?"

Vivian's smile was knowing. "Because I once thought the same."

Three days later, Victor understood her meaning during his first day at Hamilton Group. Alexander Hamilton didn't exploit employees—he reserved his relentless drive for himself. Keeping pace demanded overtime from management without exception.

As Project Director, Victor fell squarely into that bracket.

He spent one day grasping the project and another acclimating to the team. Soon, his three-piece suits gave way to casual wear, and contact lenses were swapped for wire-frame glasses.

With only twenty-four hours in a day, every saved minute counted—even the time spent inserting contacts.

Hamilton Group had no dress code beyond neat professionalism. So when Alexander encountered Victor's liberated new style, he merely remarked, "Vivian won that bet."

Victor paused mid-file acceptance, eyes brightening. "Does Vivian still visit Evelyn often?"

In school, the two had been inseparable. Though Evelyn was now married, their recent dinner suggested frequent visits. Victor's eagerness surfaced at Vivian's days of silence.

Even busy executives make time for small talk. "Vivian adores my daughter," Alexander shared. "She visits to play whenever she's off early, giving Evelyn time for parenting classes."

Without waiting for a response, he smoothly added, "Evelyn and I will be out Saturday afternoon. Our daughter expects us around. Could you help?"

"Absolutely! Weekends are free, and I love kids!" Victor's enthusiasm rivaled a nanny applicant's.

Alexander simply provided the time for Saturday morning at the family estate. Only after Victor's cheerful departure did he call Evelyn.

"Mission accomplished for Uncle Dempsey, but results aren't guaranteed," he said, referencing the elaborate setup requested by Vivian's father. Normally, Auntie Wu could easily manage a half-day's childcare.

Fortunately, Victor shared Vivian's guilelessness, suspecting nothing. Any sharper observer would've seen through Alexander's amateur matchmaking.

In the greenhouse with her book, Evelyn sighed. "You shouldn't have to do this. Had I known visiting Grandma Dempsey would lead here, I'd gone alone."

The chain of events began two nights prior.

Alexander and Evelyn, estimating Grandma Dempsey's recovery progress, visited with gifts. After profuse thanks, Uncle Dempsey turned the conversation to Vivian's overtime habits.

"A friend saw Vivian touring apartments with some pretty boy last Friday. It's worrying. The matches I arranged were disasters, so I let her choose—only for her to pick some flashy freeloader clearly after her money."

He earnestly asked Evelyn to caution Vivian: flings were fine, but avoid gold-digging playboys.

Baffled, Evelyn only understood when Alexander deduced the "pretty boy's" identity from the apartment location. "Don't worry, Uncle. We know him—nothing like a freeloader..."
###Chapter 970: Liberation Through Letting Go

Uncle Dempsey finally relaxed his furrowed brow after hearing about Victor Laurent's situation. Rubbing his hands nervously, he ventured, "If that young man really has feelings for Vivian, could you help set them up?"

Alexander Hamilton swallowed the refusal that had risen to his lips. Vivian was Evelyn Carter's closest friend—making Uncle Dempsey practically family. When it came to Evelyn's loved ones, he strived for perfection.

"I'll do my best," he agreed with a nod.

The older man excitedly rubbed his palms together, promising full cooperation.

Alexander's lips twitched as he recalled Evelyn's accounts of Vivian's disastrous blind dates. Uncle Dempsey's matchmaking instincts left much to be desired.

Evelyn's sigh carried through the phone. "Uncle means well, but he's genuinely impressed with Victor this time."

At least they knew Victor's background—a vast improvement over previous candidates.

Fingering his wedding band, Alexander murmured, "When Baby Chloe grows up, I'll probably be worse than Uncle Dempsey."

The thought of his daughter walking away with another man constricted his chest. For the first time, he truly understood Andrew Anderson's protective instincts.

Not wanting to reopen old wounds, he changed the subject. After confirming Evelyn's wellbeing, he ended the call.

At dawn, Vivian Dempsey burst into the Hamilton estate like a whirlwind, scooping up the toddler building blocks on the floor.

"Miss me, sweetheart?" She spun the giggling child, her voice dripping honey. Tiny hands patted her shoulders as she nuzzled the baby's cheek. "Go enjoy your date—I've got this!"

Evelyn hesitated. "Actually, we arranged some help..."

"Details later!" Vivian waved dismissively. "Unless it's cooking, childcare's my specialty!"

Watching their playful interaction, Evelyn swallowed her words. Let it be a surprise.

Alexander guided his pregnant wife outside. Dressed simply, they headed to the countryside temple to honor the child they'd never held.

The abbot recognized Alexander's solemn escort and led them directly to the memorial hall.

Flickering candlelight bathed the space in ethereal glow. Evelyn's gaze traveled across tiers of eternal flames before settling on one particular lamp.

"This one." Her fingertip grazed the flame, drawing back with a start before smiling through tears. "She's saying hello."

The steady flame suddenly danced in response.

Alexander touched the fire, throat tight. "It never reacts when I come alone. She prefers her mother."

The abbot pressed his palms together. "Parent-child bonds transcend lifetimes. Unfinished connections will reunite."

Evelyn's eyes glistened. "Master, does this mean letting go will bring her back?"

The monk smiled enigmatically.

Understanding, Alexander quietly requested prayer scrolls and ritual paper. The crackle of burning sheets echoed through the silent hall.

As Evelyn fed papers to the flames, her whisper barely carried: "I know it's foolish. But I remember Dad's last words. If she returns...maybe we'll see all who've left us..."

The fire leaped suddenly, casting her profile in dancing shadows.
###Chapter 971: Victory in Sight

"I miss Dad and the grandparents too." Alexander Hamilton's fingers stilled for a moment at Evelyn Carter's rare admission. He added a pinch of sandalwood to the incense burner, watching the tendrils of smoke curl upward. "How about we light some memorial lamps for them here? The cemetery is too far, but we can visit this place every week."

Evelyn rested a hand on her slightly rounded belly and nodded. "That sounds nice. I’ll have time to practice calligraphy and copy scriptures while I’m home resting."

Gazing at the sunlight streaming through the window, she realized how long it had been since she’d allowed herself such quiet moments. From medical school to the OB-GYN department, her life had always been packed to the brim. Now that it had slowed down, the change felt almost unfamiliar.

Meanwhile, a startled gasp echoed through the Hamilton family estate.

"It’s you?" Vivian Dempsey’s eyes widened at the unexpected sight of Victor Laurent. "Where’s Auntie Wu? Did you come alone?"

She craned her neck, searching behind him in vain.

Victor adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses with a wry smile. "That hurt. Do I really seem so useless?"

"What could you possibly help with?" Vivian crossed her arms.

"Babysitting, obviously." Confident, he crouched down and extended a hand toward the toddler stacking blocks. "Easy, say 'big brother.'"

The child blinked up at him, tiny fingers clutching Vivian’s sleeve.

Vivian burst out laughing. "You think she’ll remember you after one meeting? I’ve been playing with her every day, and she still won’t call me anything."

Unfazed, Victor pulled a colorful pinwheel from his pocket. Its cheerful spinning and chiming instantly captured the baby’s attention.

"Watch this," he boasted, shooting Vivian a smug look before softening his voice. "Easy, want to fly high with big brother?"

Before he could finish, the child’s face crumpled, and she let out a wail.

"Victor!" Vivian scrambled to scoop her up, while Peanut the Ragdoll cat hissed from the windowsill.

Victor frantically pulled faces and mimicked animal sounds until, at last, the tears turned to giggles. The little girl perched on his shoulders, waving her arms excitedly.

"Brave little thing," Vivian murmured, steadying the child with a chuckle. "Evelyn was never this wild as a kid."

"Is 'Baby' her actual name?" Victor asked cautiously, seizing the moment. Having been abroad for so long, he was out of the loop with old classmates.

Vivian’s smile faltered. Studying his profile, she abruptly changed the subject. "Have you eaten breakfast yet?"

"Not yet." His eyes lit up, catching on immediately. "Want me to cook? I remember you love—"

"Tomato egg noodles," they said in unison.

Sunlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, stretching their three shadows across the room. Peanut yawned lazily before curling up on the sofa and drifting off.
###Chapter 972: Simple Pursuits

Vivian Dempsey hastily lifted Baby Chloe off Victor Laurent and handed her a pile of building blocks. Clearing her throat, she began reciting Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton's instructions.

"Adults can order takeout or ask the Hamiltons' housekeeper for help. As for the baby..." She pointed to the kitchen cabinet. "There's rice cereal and yogurt melts. You just need to boil water."

These reminders were originally from Evelyn. After tasting Vivian's disastrous cooking in college, Evelyn had banned her from the kitchen—boiling water was her only permitted task.

Just as Vivian was about to tease Victor, she suddenly remembered something. Clutching the baby, she rushed into the kitchen. "Stop!"

Victor stood there, whisking two eggs in a bowl, looking baffled. "Are the eggs bad?"

The kitchen was stocked enough to host a banquet. He'd planned to steam egg custard for the baby but was intercepted before even lighting the stove.

Vivian exhaled in relief. "Remember your college stunt with the alcohol burner and instant noodles? That landed me in the hospital with gastritis for three days!" She rolled her eyes at the memory.

Victor chuckled dismissively. "I've improved. Let me show you." He patted his chest confidently. "Back then, it was the tools' fault. Now I have a proper stove."

"And you're sure it wasn't your skills?" Vivian eyed him skeptically. This guy didn't even have a permanent address abroad—how good could his cooking be?

"Just watch." Victor was eager for her to stay and witness his skills.

Thirty minutes later, a bowl of golden, silky egg custard emerged, garnished with green scallions and wafting an enticing aroma.

Vivian's eyes widened. "You actually made this?" The baby in her arms curiously reached out a tiny hand.

Victor beamed. "Piece of cake. Want me to whip up some spaghetti? That's my specialty."

Another half hour passed.

They stared in stunned silence at the pot of flaming spaghetti. Victor frantically turned off the burner and covered the pot, but the noodles were already charred to a crisp.

"So..." Vivian massaged her temples. "You didn't know to break the noodles before boiling them?" She took a bite of the egg custard. "The skill gap is unreal."

Victor sheepishly cleaned up the mess. "Well... I only know how to make egg custard."

Vivian sighed deeply. "Let's order takeout. Is this pot salvageable? If not, I'll buy a new one."

After thirty minutes of scrubbing, the stubborn black stains remained. Victor emerged from the kitchen, disheveled. "I'll head out. What do you want to eat?"

His carefully planned meal had gone up in flames. Resigned, he decided to fall back on the simplest way to prove himself—actions.

A shadow crossed his eyes as memories from before his time abroad resurfaced. Thinking he was upset, Vivian offered rare comfort. "Spaghetti is tricky to get right."

Not that she'd ever tried.

Victor instantly perked up. "Really?"

Vivian immediately regretted her softness. "...Yeah. You're going to buy a new pot, right? The mall carries the same model. For lunch, I want spicy hot pot—medium heat with extra garlic—"

"No tofu, extra lotus root and napa cabbage, skip the luncheon meat." Victor recited flawlessly. "With an iced cola, right?"

Vivian froze. "You remember?"

In their school days, they'd been an inseparable trio with Evelyn. Her preferences were etched in his memory.

Victor grinned ear to ear. "Of course. How many years did I bring you meals? Before I transferred, wasn't I the one delivering your lunches and midnight snacks?" He barely stopped himself from adding, "Before Simon Stapleton showed up."

Vivian laughed at his eager-for-praise expression. "Fine, good memory. My treat today."
###Chapter 973: Boundaries

"Sponsor you?" Vivian Dempsey waved her hand dramatically. "No problem!"

Victor Laurent raised an eyebrow with a smirk. "Then you'll have to call me 'Daddy' first."

He pretended to leave, but Baby Chloe suddenly lunged forward, tiny hands clutching his sleeve.

"See?" Victor lifted the baby triumphantly. "She doesn't want me to go."

Vivian stared in disbelief. In just a few hours, the baby had grown attached to this stranger. She reached out. "Sweetheart, Uncle needs to buy a pot."

"Together," the baby lisped, blinking her big eyes.

Vivian's face lit up with understanding. She pinched the baby's cheek. "Little glutton, you just want chocolate, don't you?"

Baby Chloe giggled, revealing tiny white teeth.

"Easy fix." Victor grinned. "Uncle will take you."

Vivian blocked him. "No." She lowered her voice. "Evelyn's rule—one chocolate per day. She's already had hers."

Her breath brushed Victor's ear as she leaned in.

His ears turned scarlet. He froze.

"Hello?" Vivian waved a hand before his dazed eyes. "Earth to Victor?"

"N-nothing." He stammered. "Since when did Evelyn get so strict?"

In his memory, Evelyn had always been gentle as water.

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Don't be ridiculous. Evelyn's not some tiger mom."

"But you just—"

"It's about principles." Vivian dressed the baby in a mint-green dress and floppy sunhat, transforming her into a tiny fairy. "Even if Evelyn wouldn't mind, I can't cross that line."

Victor turned away automatically, but bitterness welled up. "You weren't this careful before."

"You never really knew me." The words slipped out casually.

Victor's smile stiffened. Right. After years of absence, what right did he have to expect her remembrance?

Vivian was already pushing the stroller outside, the shopping trip forgotten.

Victor watched her adjust the car seat with practiced ease. Sunlight through the window haloed her silhouette in gold.

Suddenly he sprinted forward, claiming the passenger seat.

"You sit with the baby." Vivian gave him a strange look.

Flushing, Victor retreated to the backseat. The entire ride, he entertained Baby Chloe with silly games.

As they parked, Vivian studied him. "You're surprisingly good with kids."

Victor flashed a grin, teeth gleaming. "I tutored in Canada."

"But your family's loaded." Vivian frowned.

"A real man doesn't mooch off his parents forever." His tone was light, but shadows flickered in his eyes.

He strode toward cookware, suddenly pointing. "Isn't that the brand you wanted?"
###Chapter 974: Practice Makes Perfect

Vivian Dempsey's gaze was drawn to the cookware display, momentarily forgetting her earlier questions. "The brand is right, but the design seems different?"

The sales associate approached eagerly. "This model is perfect for young families like yours."

"We're not a family of three," Vivian corrected bluntly.

The clerk's smile froze. "My apologies, I assumed—"

"We did come together," Vivian attempted to clarify, "but we're buying a replacement pot for a friend. We accidentally damaged theirs."

The explanation only deepened the awkwardness.

Victor Laurent quickly interjected, "And the baby isn't ours."

The clerk's expression turned wary, fingers inching toward the panic button.

"Not kidnapped!" Victor blurted.

Now it was beyond salvage.

Baby Chloe tensed at the rising tension.

"Don't scare her!" Vivian immediately softened her expression. The toddler relaxed, even mimicking adults by patting Victor's shoulder to be put down.

Victor wiped his brow but carefully lowered the child.

Seeing their natural interaction, the clerk exhaled and resumed her sales pitch.

Vivian abandoned explanations and focused on selecting a pot—only to find none matching the Hamilton household's original.

"That model was discontinued three years ago. This upgraded version performs better," the clerk insisted.

They settled on the upgrade. As Vivian reached for her wallet, Victor scanned the payment first. "My treat."

"That expensive?!" Vivian's eyes widened. "I thought four digits max!"

Victor winced too. "Had I known, I'd have snapped the spaghetti to cook it. No Italians here to lecture me."

"You've offended Italians before?" Vivian perked up.

Baby Chloe tilted her head curiously.

After hesitation, Victor confessed, "Cultural clash. I brought Hawaiian pizza to a potluck. My Italian classmate nearly fainted at the pineapple, even brandished a cross like it was demonic."

"Allergic to pineapple?"

"No—just that fruit doesn't belong on pizza. For revenge, he later served boiled soup dumplings..."

"What?!" Vivian slammed the table. "Soup dumplings must never be boiled!"

United by culinary principles, they left the store with Baby Chloe.

"Let's have lunch out," Vivian suggested.

Choosing a dumpling restaurant for the toddler's sake, Vivian expertly coaxed bites with animated "Ahhs" while Victor folded a napkin into a bib.

"When did you learn this?" Vivian marveled.

"Practice makes perfect." Proudly, he shaped another into a bunny. "Hotel part-time job."

Envious stares from the next table's children earned them a second paper bunny.
###Chapter 975: Fading Memories

The little boy stood timidly beside the table, tiny hands clutching the hem of his shirt. His wide eyes remained fixed on the paper rabbit in Victor Laurent's grasp.

Victor smiled knowingly, placing the origami bunny gently into the boy's palm. "If you like something, you should say it. How else will people know what you want?"

The boy's mother nudged him forward with a gentle push. "What do we say?"

"Thank you, sir..." The child's voice was barely louder than a whisper as he cradled the paper treasure against his chest.

Victor ruffled the boy's soft hair. Before the mother could express her gratitude, her gaze darted between him and Vivian Dempsey. Her eyes widened in sudden recognition. "Victor Laurent? Vivian Dempsey? You two... finally together?"

Her exclamation carried layers of emotion—surprise, delight, nostalgia—as if witnessing a long-awaited resolution.

Victor looked utterly bewildered. Years abroad had severed old connections, leaving him unable to recognize former classmates. Vivian, however, slapped the table in realization. "Class president!"

Their once top-ranking academic leader now wore gold-rimmed glasses as a product director at a tech giant. She adjusted her frames with playful accusation. "Victor, you transferred schools without leaving contact info. Missed every reunion."

"Making up for it now." Victor flashed his QR code. "Next gathering, I'll be there."

The class president's eyes lit up. "Perfect timing—we're meeting next weekend." She turned to Vivian. "You're responsible for delivering him."

Vivian laughed, hugging the toddler in her arms. "If he dares bail, I'm kidnapping Evelyn's little darling here."

Studying the baby's chubby cheeks, their former leader had an epiphany. "Mrs. Hamilton's daughter?" At Vivian's nod, she sighed. "Evelyn moves in silence. When she posted wedding photos, our class chat exploded."

Victor concentrated fiercely on his soup dumplings, though his ears perked up. The class president studied them meaningfully. "So you two are..."

"Just co-parenting buddies," Vivian interjected, stomping Victor's foot under the table.

He choked on his broth. "I just returned to Hudson City. Working at Hamilton Group when I ran into Vivian..."

The class president wore an "I-know-better" smirk. "The whole class shipped you back then..."

"President!" Vivian lunged to cover her mouth as the baby giggled.

All three tactfully avoided mentioning a certain name. Departing, their former leader winked at Victor. "Don't skip the reunion. Someone's waited years for you."

As she walked away with her son, Victor stared at the new contact in his phone. "Never imagined our class president having kids. She swore she'd stay single forever in school."

Vivian lifted the baby toward sunlight filtering through her fingers. "People change." Golden flecks danced across the child's face like scattered stars.
###Chapter 976: Father-Free Parenting

"It's because you men are so unreliable." Vivian Dempsey rested her chin on her hand, tapping the table lightly with her fingertips. "Our class president is what you'd call a modern independent woman—father-free parenting, ever heard of it? She's practically my second idol now."

Victor Laurent nearly choked on his dumpling. "Father-free parenting?!"

His voice shot up an octave, startling Baby Chloe. The dumpling she'd just grabbed plopped back onto the table.

Vivian shot him a disdainful look. "Why the shock? Single mothers are everywhere abroad. If it weren't for all the red tape here, I'd have picked premium genes from a sperm bank ages ago—sparing myself the headache of dealing with men."

"You're serious?" Victor's Adam's apple bobbed. "No plans for marriage?"

"Maybe if I meet the right one." She counted off on her fingers. "Lately it's been either mama's boys or mediocre guys with inflated egos. At this rate, I'll develop commitment phobia."

Her gaze swept over Victor, and she found him oddly tolerable for once. Sure, he was a bit of a goof, but at least he wasn't completely insufferable.

Victor's mind raced. Part of him was relieved she wasn't looking to settle down, but another part winced at how she'd written off every man on the planet.

"You've got lots of classmates abroad, right?" Vivian's eyes suddenly sparkled.

"Y-yeah..."

"Perfect!" She slapped the table. "Introduce me to a few. If things work out, I'll bring one home to shut my dad up."

Victor nearly knocked over the vinegar dish. "Absolutely not!"

"What? Afraid I'll devour your friends?"

"I'm afraid they wouldn't be worthy of you!" Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. "Those guys are either alcoholics, promiscuous, or can't even speak proper English!"

He silently apologized to his old classmates.

Vivian burst into laughter. "Who's devouring whom remains to be seen. I just want a mixed-race baby—blonde hair, blue eyes, like a little doll—"

Hearing the compliment, Baby Chloe happily kicked her tiny feet.

"Mixed genes are unstable!" Victor's voice cracked. "What if the baby has black hair? And none of my friends are even blonde!"

"Just throwing it out there." Vivian blinked. "So, introductions?"

"No!" He gritted his teeth. "Finding a father isn't like grocery shopping—you need someone thoroughly vetted!"

He emphasized the last four words pointedly.

Vivian mused, "Thoroughly vetted men... that is a short list."

Victor's pulse quickened, his fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of his teacup.

"My secretary's boyfriend is great—always packing her lunch." She suddenly started counting examples. "And Yingying's husband—high school sweethearts to marriage..."

Victor's expression grew increasingly rigid.

"Oh!" Vivian leaned in abruptly. "Remember Yingying's desk mate? The one who brought her breakfast every day..."

"I remember." He forced a smile. "But those 'happily ever after' types are rare—"

Before he could finish, Vivian sighed into her hands. "Why are all the good ones snatched up so young?"
###Chapter 977: Brotherhood

Victor Laurent's fingers tapped lightly on the steering wheel.

He stole a glance at Vivian Dempsey's profile through the rearview mirror, terrified she might recall that unmentionable name.

That guy was nothing but a smooth talker with no real substance.

What if they were just on a temporary break...

"You're right. He must've dated before," Vivian suddenly said, snapping him out of his thoughts.

She squinted at Victor as if discovering new land.

This guy used to be famously clueless about romance.

Now he's suddenly so invested in relationship talk? Definitely suspicious!

Victor's Adam's apple bobbed. His palms grew damp with sweat. Deflated, he even breathed with extra caution.

Vivian remained puzzled until she dropped Baby Chloe at the Hamilton residence and ran into Evelyn Carter and Alexander Hamilton, who had just returned.

"He's been acting so weird lately, asking all these strange questions about love. Did something traumatize him?"

She helped Evelyn unroll the rice paper while complaining.

Evelyn and Alexander had specially gone shopping for calligraphy supplies today. Even the smell of ink made her nauseous during pregnancy, yet Alexander insisted on getting the finest materials.

"How do you think he feels about you?" Evelyn asked abruptly.

Vivian answered without hesitation: "He's great. If he hadn't disappeared back then and seen me making a fool of myself over that jerk, he probably would've cut ties with me ages ago."

She shuddered at the memory of that cringe-worthy chapter of her life.

Evelyn mused: "Maybe none of that would've happened if he'd stayed."

"Then I'd have to blame him," Vivian pouted, quickly changing the subject. "Seriously, does your company background check include romantic history?"

She recalled that handsy client from before. If they'd caught that earlier, the company wouldn't have wasted that settlement money.

Evelyn gave her an exasperated look: "Since when did you become so financially savvy?"

"I can't mooch off you forever," Vivian winked playfully before suddenly hugging Evelyn from behind. "But if I really hit rock bottom, you're stuck with me!"

Evelyn laughed as she peeled her off: "More clingy than the baby."

"You're the one who said I'm like your little sister." Vivian suddenly turned serious. "Speaking of which, Victor's like family to me. If he's having relationship troubles, I have to help!"

She rubbed her hands together, eyes sparkling with determination.
###Chapter 978: The Live-in Son-in-Law

Evelyn Carter watched Vivian Dempsey's beaming expression and couldn't help but massage her temples.

This girl's thought process was a perfect match for Victor Laurent's.

"You could actually help with this, but..." She hesitated.

Vivian's eyes lit up. "As long as I can help! I'll ask him what relationship problems he's having. If necessary, I'll personally help him pursue someone!"

Evelyn opened her mouth, then closed it. In the end, she could only pat Vivian's shoulder sympathetically.

She hoped Victor would face reality sooner rather than later.

Meanwhile, Victor was clutching his phone, texting their class president.

He began by sincerely apologizing for leaving without a word years ago before cautiously broaching the real topic.

"Will that third-ranked student from back then be at the reunion? Who initiated the breakup between him and Vivian?"

"President, I just don't want to say the wrong thing in front of our classmates."

He deleted and rewrote the message repeatedly before finally sending it.

The president instantly replied with a sweating panda emoji.

Victor stared at the awkward-looking panda and immediately realized he'd stepped on a landmine.

He quickly sent a question mark.

The chat fell into prolonged silence.

Just as he worried the president might report him to Vivian, a reply finally arrived.

"He won't be coming."

"It's not appropriate to discuss this. Ask Vivian yourself."

"Forget it. Pretend this person never existed."

"Whatever you do, don't ask!"

Four messages exploded into the chat like consecutive bombs.

Victor's temples throbbed.

This was clearly something major!

His fingers hovered over the screen before he deleted everything he'd typed.

With the president's attitude, there was no way he'd get answers.

Tormented by curiosity, Victor desperately wanted to question that third-ranked student from years ago. But being alone in the country with no connections left him helpless.

By Monday morning, dark circles hung heavily under his eyes.

Alexander Hamilton frowned at his disheveled appearance. "What happened?"

"Couldn't sleep." Victor handed over the revised design plans.

The resort project had hit a snag, prompting Alexander to specifically recruit Victor back from abroad to resolve the details.

But Alexander's frown deepened as he reviewed the new designs.

"This is what you produced after staying up all night?" He pointed at the lakeside pavilion. "Director Laurent, this isn't your usual standard."

The design overly preserved the pond's original appearance, completely disjointed from the surrounding architecture.

Victor seemed distracted. "Just a draft. I can make changes if there are issues."

His tone suggested he'd expected revisions from the start.

After studying him for a moment, Alexander understood. "Relationship troubles?"

"If it were just design problems, you wouldn't look this haggard. Is this about Vivian?"

Out of consideration for Evelyn and Victor's newcomer status, he let it slide this time.

But if it happened again, he'd reconsider the director position.

Knowing Alexander's strict professional standards, Victor lowered his head. "My apologies, Mr. Hamilton."

Seeing his admission, Alexander's expression softened. "No need to apologize to me. If you truly regret it, adjust your state quickly."

Silence filled the office.

Victor nodded slowly.

"Want to know about Vivian's current situation?" Alexander said bluntly. "She's single. Grandma Dempsey is open-minded, but Uncle Dempsey and the company situation have her considering taking in a son-in-law."

Victor's previously drooping head suddenly lifted.

His eyes shone startlingly bright.

He showed no resistance—even seemed eager—at the prospect of becoming a live-in son-in-law.

The Laurent family had multiple children. His parents wouldn't object to him "marrying out."

The real question was—did Vivian's consideration list include him?

Bitterly, Victor asked, "Do you know about that third-ranked student from Vivian's high school days?"

He hung his head like an abandoned puppy.

He assumed Alexander wouldn't know.

Unexpectedly, Alexander nodded straightforwardly. "I do."

"How would you—"

"He was also Evelyn's classmate."

To understand Evelyn better, Alexander had investigated her school years—including why she chose medical school.

After hearing Alexander's account, Victor's face turned ashen.

"Honestly," Alexander sighed lightly, "after learning why Evelyn studied medicine, my feelings were complicated."

"If she'd gotten into that top university as planned, we might never have met."

The thought of Evelyn being able to soar higher made his chest ache faintly.

"I've never told Evelyn this. But if there were a chance, I'd prefer she achieved her original dreams."

Victor rubbed his face hard. "I'm sorry..."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "You left early and knew nothing. Why apologize?"

"I don't know." Victor's eyes reddened. "But I can't help feeling things might have been different if I'd stayed."
###Chapter 979: He's Kicking Me

"That guy chased after Vivian like a rabid dog back then." Victor Laurent's fingers tapped absently against the desk. "Flowers, gifts—he'd have ripped his heart out if she asked."

Alexander Hamilton arched an eyebrow.

"I never even got close." Victor gave a bitter laugh. "Eventually I just..."

His voice trailed off into incoherent mumbling.

Alexander studied him for several seconds before suddenly smiling. "At least you're self-aware."

Victor's head snapped up.

"If Simon knew you were here, he'd flee town overnight." Alexander said lazily. "Nobody knows his tricks better than you."

Victor's expression froze.

Memories he'd deliberately ignored surged up, twisting his stomach.

"Stop." Alexander cut through his thoughts. "Regret is useless."

Victor stood rigid, as if struck by lightning.

"Understood?" Alexander asked.

"Understood." Victor nodded mechanically, but his gaze gradually sharpened.

Seeing his dazed state, Alexander dismissed him outright. "Take the day off. Get some air."

"Anywhere?" Victor asked abruptly.

"Wherever."

That afternoon, Alexander received word that Victor had gone to a construction site.

"I thought he'd seek out Vivian." Alexander remarked that evening while peeling an orange for Evelyn. "Instead he went hiking."

Evelyn accepted the orange segment with a faint smile. "That's just like him."

"You seem pleased?" Alexander narrowed his eyes.

"I simply think," she took a delicate bite, "some people never change."

As the sweet-tart juice burst across her tongue, she suddenly frowned, a hand drifting to her abdomen.

Alexander tensed instantly. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing." Evelyn laughed at his flustered expression. "Just movement. Want to feel?"

Alexander moved at double speed—rushing to wash his hands before darting back.

His palm settled gingerly against her belly.

Beneath the thin fabric, a distinct little bump pressed upward.

Alexander went completely still.

"Evelyn," his voice trembled, "he's kicking me."

Those perpetually composed eyes now shone brilliantly, their corners tinged pink.

Watching him, Evelyn recalled the ultrasound images—two tiny figures curled together, one serene, the other lively.

"Could be a girl." Alexander gently pressed his ear to her stomach. "Just like you—"

Another kick interrupted him.

Alexander grinned like a fool. "Feisty. Definitely takes after you."

"What if it's a boy?" Evelyn teased.

"Even better." He answered without hesitation. "A son who resembles you would be infinitely more likable than me."

His expression dimmed suddenly. "Truthfully...I'd love any child of yours. That way, even if you leave me someday, I'd still have pieces of you."

Evelyn blinked. "Keep the baby, ditch the father?"

"Mm." Alexander smiled bitterly. "I deserve it."

Evelyn stared at him before suddenly pinching his cheek. "Alexander Hamilton, are you an idiot?"

Her fingertips still carried the citrus scent of oranges.
###Chapter 980: The Unspoken Bond Between Men

"Why would you think that?" Evelyn frowned slightly. "These things are usually planned. Do I strike you as someone who plans ahead?"

The memory of that unexpected night made her cheeks flush.

Alexander immediately grasped her hand, afraid she might change her mind. "How about we do something planned right now?" His gaze burned with intensity. "Want to see the nursery?"

This nursery had consumed countless hours of his effort.

The air purifier hummed day and night, ensuring not a trace of renovation odor lingered.

Evelyn pushed the door open and was instantly awestruck.

Floor-to-ceiling windows were etched with star and moon cutouts, sunlight filtering through to cast dappled patterns on the floor. Her fingers traced the glass. "It's beautiful."

A faint smile touched Alexander's lips as he pressed a switch by the bed.

The ceiling suddenly glowed with soft light, revealing adorable animal silhouettes that flickered in and out of view.

"One more thing." He pressed another button.

A gentle lullaby filled the room.

Evelyn instinctively rested a hand on her belly, her eyes crinkling with joy. "You even prepared prenatal music?"

Alexander switched to a cheerful nursery rhyme. "The instructor suggested familiar tunes as lullabies." He paused. "At least until they're old enough to sleep on their own."

"And what about Baby Chloe?" Evelyn teased. "She already sleeps independently."

Alexander considered this seriously. "If it's a girl, she can share the room with Chloe. Sisters should keep each other company."

Anticipation sparkled in his eyes.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh, indulging his fantasy. She gazed at the ceiling. "This melody sounds familiar."

"Mozart from our prenatal class," Alexander recited effortlessly. "It aids brain development."

They shared a smile, wrapped in the warmth of the moment.

A jarring ringtone shattered the tranquility.

Alexander answered with a frown, his expression shifting from stern to bemused.

"What happened?" Evelyn asked with concern.

"Victor got into an accident," he massaged his temples. "A sheep knocked his tractor into a ditch during his field research."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Is he badly hurt?"

"Just a sprained ankle." Alexander sighed. "But his dramatic wailing terrified the villagers."

They exchanged a knowing glance.

"Should we tell Vivian?" Alexander asked.

Evelyn shook her head. "Let her ask first."

The next day, Vivian's call went straight to Alexander's phone.

"Victor? He's on leave," Alexander played coy.

Vivian's roar came through the speaker: "Tell him to lock his damn door next time! His keys are still in the lock!"
###Chapter 981: Frenemies

Alexander Hamilton's fingers stiffened around his phone.

Front door? What did that mean? Were they living together? Impossible!

Vivian Dempsey on the other end immediately sensed his confusion and spilled the entire story like tipping out a bag of beans.

Turns out Victor Laurent had left in such a daze that he forgot to close the door. A concerned neighbor reported it to the property management, who eventually contacted Vivian—the one who'd helped him rent the place.

The plot twist was more dramatic than a soap opera. For the first time in his life, Alexander shot Evelyn Carter a pleading look.

How was he supposed to respond to this?

Evelyn sighed and took the phone. "He won't be back for a while. You should contact him directly."

"Huh?" Vivian's reaction mirrored Victor's exactly. "He's already back in the country? The rent's paid for the whole year."

"He got knocked off a tricycle by a goat while doing field research at the construction site. He's in the hospital now." Evelyn phrased it as delicately as possible.

The other end of the line erupted with earth-shaking laughter.

"HAHAHA!"

Evelyn quickly held the phone away, her eardrums nearly shattered.

Vivian was slapping the table, wheezing. "A goat? We need photographic evidence! Gotta go!"

The call ended abruptly—clearly, she couldn't wait to mock Victor in person.

Alexander took back the phone, his expression twisted. "Are they actually friends? Sounds more like sworn enemies to me."

"That's just how they are," Evelyn said, barely suppressing a laugh. "They'll be the first to cackle at each other's misfortunes, but if anyone else dares to mess with one of them, they'll also be the first to throw hands."

"If I had to define it, I'd say they're the legendary frenemies."

Even she chuckled at her own words. This kind of relationship was light-years away from romance.

The term "frenemy" triggered Alexander's reflex memory of Vincent Wilson, making him shudder violently.

Dating Vincent? He'd rather take a knife to the gut—it'd be quicker.

Evelyn nearly cried laughing at his reaction.

Three days later, Victor was finally transported back to Hudson City, with his first stop being Central Hospital.

Evelyn had been suffering from dizziness and sun sensitivity lately, so Alexander went alone to visit. Just outside the hospital room door, Vivian's unrestrained laughter rang out.

"That goat wasn't even knee-high! And you got launched by it?"

"When it jumped to headbutt you, why didn't you just jump to dodge? But full marks for professionalism—finishing the site inspection on a sprained ankle..."

Alexander shook his head outside the door and knocked.

A synchronized "Come in" answered him.

Inside, Victor sat propped against the headboard with one leg in a cast, peeling an apple. Vivian nibbled on a rabbit-shaped slice with relish.

The patient serving the visitor—what a picture.

Alexander placed a bouquet by the bedside. "Here on behalf of the company."

Per Hamilton Group protocol, this should've been HR's job. His personal visit was purely for Evelyn's sake.

Victor awkwardly added, "Mr. Hamilton, my hands are fine. I can still revise the design drafts on time."

"That's actually why I'm here." Alexander kept it strictly professional. The resort project couldn't afford delays—if Victor couldn't work, they'd need a replacement.

For once, Vivian didn't tease. Instead, she agreed, "Thank goodness it's just his foot."

Victor had no comeback, so he offered another apple slice. "Want some, Mr. Hamilton?"

Alexander eyed the fruit now smudged with fingerprints and declined firmly. "No, thanks."

Vivian promptly snatched it and popped it into her mouth. They'd shared snacks like this since high school—old habits died hard.

Alexander opened his mouth, then remembered Evelyn's advice to let things unfold naturally. He changed tack. "Evelyn asked me to relay something."

This could've been a phone call, but Evelyn thought face-to-face was better.

Both nodded in perfect unison.

"About the class reunion—want to go together? Evelyn wants to catch up with everyone, but she'll only attend the dinner." Alexander paused. "I'll be accompanying her."

The class monitor had specified in the group chat that plus-ones were allowed.

Vivian nodded automatically, only realizing after Alexander left—

Wait. Did that mean she'd be the odd one out?

Victor noticed her frozen apple slice. "Don't want to go? I'll keep you company."

"No." Vivian shook her head. "It's just... realizing Evelyn won't always be by my side anymore."

She exhaled deeply. "You might not believe this, but right before you came back, I absolutely despised Alexander Hamilton."

Victor nodded. "I believe you. You still don't seem particularly fond of him now."
###Chapter 982: Peacock Display

Men understand men best.

Victor Laurent immediately sensed the tension between Vivian Dempsey and Alexander Hamilton. The Dempsey heiress had clear boundaries—grateful to the man who saved her grandmother, but gratitude didn't guarantee compatibility.

"Friendships can be territorial too." Vivian leaned against the window, sunlight dancing on her hair.

Victor paused while peeling an apple. "You don't dislike Mr. Hamilton. You resent him for taking Evelyn away."

"Half-right." She accepted the rabbit-shaped apple slice and took a crisp bite. "Ancient history. More importantly—why did your 'field research' take you so far? Trouble?"

The apple peel spiraled around his fingers. He couldn't admit insomnia-driven longing drove him to the mountains.

"Creative block." He carved the final bunny ear. "The resort design clicked when a goat headbutted me downhill."

Vivian burst out laughing. "An architect inspired by livestock?"

"Lying on that hillside under the stars," Victor's gaze burned, "I imagined watching them with you—"

The words dissolved. Vivian tilted her head,梧桐树影 flickering in her eyes.

"You're acting strange today." She suddenly leaned in. "Don't tell me..."

His heartbeat stuttered.

"...you want me to drive you to the reunion?" She patted his casted leg. "Relax. Even if you could walk, I'd still chauffeur you."

Victor's lips parted.

An orange dropped into his palm. She remembered his high school favorite.

"Doctor says you're discharged tomorrow." Vivian slung her purse, the tailored blazer sweeping a sharp arc. "I'll pick you up."

She left like a summer storm, missing the unspoken words in his eyes.

——

Two days later, antiseptic lingered in hospital corridors.

The nurse tied his sneakers with a chuckle. "Dressed to impress, young man. Meeting your girl?"

Victor adjusted his collar in the mirror. The reflection showed sharp features and broad shoulders—only the right leg cast spoiling the peacock display.

A car horn sounded outside. Vivian leaned against a scarlet convertible checking her watch. Sunlight filtered through梧桐 leaves, dappling her silhouette.
###Chapter 983: Floodgates of Memory

Victor Laurent suddenly remembered something. He hopped back to the hospital bed on one foot and grabbed the bottle of Jo Malone cologne, spritzing it liberally. The crisp scent of English Pear & Freesia instantly filled the room.

He'd specifically chosen this fragrance for tonight—a youthful, summery blend with just the right touch of boyish charm.

Even during his two-day hospital stay, he hadn't been idle. When he'd asked about Vivian Dempsey's recent preferences and heard she'd developed a liking for younger men, he'd adjusted his strategy immediately. The glasses stayed, but everything else leaned younger.

The caregiver chuckled knowingly. "Still in the honeymoon phase with that girl who visits you? Young people these days—injured but still determined to date."

Aside from Alexander Hamilton, Vivian was the only one who'd come to see him recently.

Victor's smile froze for a split second before he replied matter-of-factly, "You've got it backwards. I'm the one pursuing her." His words were clear, leaving no room for misunderstanding.

Vivian hated gossip more than anything. No matter how close they were, this wasn't negotiable.

The caregiver awkwardly rubbed his hands together. "Ah...my apologies. I just assumed..."

The door swung open abruptly. Vivian strode in, twirling her car keys. "Ready to go?"

Victor, who'd been listless all afternoon, instantly perked up. "Absolutely!"

If not for the cast on his right foot, he would've bounded over immediately.

Seeing his enthusiasm, Vivian assumed he was eager for the reunion. She pushed forward the rented wheelchair. "Hop in."

She always had patience with the injured.

Victor shook his head vehemently at the wheelchair. "No way. If I show up to the reunion like this, everyone will think I'm on death's door."

"Not that badly hurt, huh?" Vivian rolled her eyes, then spotted the crutches in the corner. "Those, then?"

Victor's eyes lit up. He snatched the crutches and made for the door with the energy of a man on stilts.

Vivian followed with a sigh, suddenly understanding how that client with the hyperactive husky must feel.

Noticing her gaze, Victor preened internally. So what if he was twenty-five? Still a rising star!

To showcase his vitality, he marched ahead with surprising speed on the crutches, only wiping his brow discreetly once safely in the car.

Two days without exercise, and his stamina was already slipping.

His injured foot needed space, relegating him to the backseat. As he watched Vivian in the driver's seat, he suddenly burst out laughing—first a suppressed chuckle, then full-bodied laughter.

Vivian, who'd just changed into flats, checked the rearview mirror in confusion. Her ponytail was intact, lipstick unblemished.

When his laughter subsided, she smacked his knee. "What's so funny?"

"Remember how we used to go out in high school?" Victor's eyes still glistened with mirth.

"Of course. Evelyn and I taught you to ride a bike." Vivian started the car as the evening breeze rushed through open windows.

"Back then it was either buses or bikes. That weekend we wanted to hike the mountain, and you suddenly admitted you couldn't ride!"

"I genuinely didn't know how." Even now, the memory made Victor cringe. That trip would've been canceled without Vivian's quick thinking.

A smile tugged at Vivian's lips unbidden. "But you learned eventually. Evelyn and I pushed you from behind while you kept looking back to make sure we hadn't let go."

She'd thought those memories were long forgotten. Victor's words were like a key, suddenly unlocking the floodgates.

That entire afternoon, they'd run up and down the same mountain path just to teach Victor. The tallest boy in class, yet the most afraid of falling. Vivian had held the bike seat until he found his balance, only releasing her grip when he was steady. By the time he noticed, he'd already ridden far ahead—nearly toppling over in surprise.
###Chapter 984 Matchmaking

"You scared me standing so far back when I turned around." I steadied the bicycle handlebars as sunlight danced across the chrome frame. "Though the real miracle is I can actually balance this thing now."

Victor Laurent approached on crutches, his plaster cast glaring white under the sun. "Cycling was my fresh start. When I first moved abroad, I'd ride for hours just to avoid the silence."

I squinted at his sun-bronzed skin. "All that outdoor activity? Can you swim? I know a decent pool nearby."

His eyes lit up like constellations. "Let's go."

My habitual kindness to friends didn't reveal how his pulse stuttered at the invitation. Only when our destination appeared did I realize how time had flown. "Talking to you makes hours disappear. I haven't had conversations this long with anyone except Evelyn Carter."

Victor dismounted smoothly despite his injury, crutches clicking into place. "How's Uncle Dempsey these days?"

Half our classmates already filled the banquet hall. Victor's entrance caused an immediate stir. The class monitor recognized him first, followed by male friends delivering playful shoulder punches. "Where've you been all these years? No calls, no texts!"

"Made it back in one piece, didn't I?" Victor dodged, using his cast as a shield. "Hit me again and I'll collapse dramatically."

Nathan York pulled out a chair for him. I noticed Victor's prolonged stare at Nathan's softened physique. "Typical programmer bod," I interjected. "Marriage amplifies it."

Nathan patted his beer belly but glowed while showing his phone wallpaper—a gap-toothed girl with pigtails. "Parenting's more exhausting than debugging code."

The conversation veered into child-rearing anecdotes. Victor leaned toward me. "Never pictured Nathan as an early dad. Remember his basketball court arrogance?"

I smirked. "Check who he married."

His covert glance nearly made him topple. "That underclasswoman who chased him?"

"Obviously." I rolled my eyes. "He wouldn't even accept water from other girls."

Victor's epiphany expression tempted me to throttle him. I pointed to a quiet tea-sipping woman in the corner. "Remember Jasmine Valentine? Literature class rep."

Blank stare.

"The time she bought you extra time with the teacher!" I hissed. "You'd have gotten parental summons otherwise."

Victor slapped his thigh. "Now I recall! You forged my homework with handwriting so awful the teacher almost—"

A napkin missile cut him off. "Deadline pressure!"

He dodged, his cast "accidentally" hitting the table leg. The resulting grimace sparked collective laughter. Someone heckled, "Vivian Dempsey, after all these years you still can't handle him?"

Warm banquet lights transported us back to high school. Victor massaged his shin, grinning as afternoon sun gilded his lashes with fractured gold.
###Chapter 985: No Wonder He's Still Single

Victor Laurent had bizarre academic strengths in school. He ranked top three in English but barely passed Chinese. His homework was always disorganized, yet his handwriting was effortlessly elegant—a stark contrast to Vivian Dempsey's chicken scratch.

Vivian twisted his ear sharply. "You never complained about my handwriting when begging me to finish your homework!"

"Ow! Mercy, Your Highness!" Victor yelped theatrically.

His outburst drew stares from single classmates, including Jasmine Valentine whom Vivian had mentioned.

Jasmine sat quietly in the corner until the noise made her glance up. Her gaze lingered on Victor briefly before coolly shifting away.

Vivian's eyes sparkled. "Jasmine used to like you. She's still single, you know."

Victor nearly choked on his own saliva.

What kind of twisted matchmaking was this? His childhood crush playing cupid for him?

Seeing Victor's conflicted expression, Vivian mistook it for shyness and clapped his shoulder. "Relax, I'll set you up!"

"No—" Before Victor could protest, Jasmine was already approaching.

He stared at the ceiling, plotting escape routes. If not for his injured leg, he'd have bolted to Nathan York's table already.

Jasmine greeted him softly, "How's your injury, Victor?" Then she smiled at Vivian. "Long time no see."

Vivian looked surprised. "I heard you moved south for work?"

"Yes, my vacation coincided with this reunion." Jasmine's eyes shone as she looked at Vivian.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly. Whenever Jasmine mentioned work struggles, Vivian offered clever solutions. Their laughter soon filled the air.

The banquet hall grew livelier. Married couples swapped parenting tips while dating pairs shared sweet anecdotes. Naturally, the remaining singles clustered together at one table.

Evelyn Carter arrived late, her pregnant belly prominent as Alexander Hamilton hovered protectively. They immediately spotted the animated duo of Vivian and Jasmine—and Victor's miserable expression.

Victor's emotions were in turmoil. While relieved Vivian forgot her matchmaking scheme, being utterly ignored left him fidgeting.

Evelyn's arrival was a godsend.

Victor waved frantically, interrupting the girls' chat. Though Jasmine was harmless, some primal alarm bells rang in his head.

"What's so interesting?" Evelyn seamlessly joined them.

Vivian grinned. "Jasmine was telling me this hilarious story from the south..."

Evelyn nodded knowingly. She remembered Jasmine's history with them—how Vivian and Victor once got hospitalized and disciplined respectively while helping Jasmine retrieve stolen tuition money. They'd kept Jasmine's family struggles secret even from the police.

Alexander stood dutifully behind Evelyn. Jasmine visibly tensed around strangers—her social anxiety from school days resurfacing.

Noticing this, Evelyn excused herself, dragging Alexander toward the married couples' table. Alexander's grin nearly split his face—Evelyn had just publicly acknowledged their relationship.

Victor gaped. Some battle buddy you are!

With outsiders gone, Jasmine relaxed again. Blushing, she asked Vivian, "Are you and Victor... together?"

Vivian waved dismissively. "God no! We're just buddies." She shot Victor a meaningful look. "Right?"

Victor, engrossed in another conversation, missed the cue entirely.

Vivian rolled her eyes. The trio ended up seated in the singles' section facing away from the married tables. She wanted Victor as buffer, but the idiot was already deep in conversation elsewhere.

This clueless blockhead—no wonder he's still single!
###Chapter 986: The Unfortunate Matchmaker

Vivian Dempsey cursed Victor Laurent inwardly. Just as she was about to speak, Jasmine Valentine murmured something under her breath.

"What did you say?" Vivian tilted her head closer to Jasmine.

Jasmine traced circles on the tablecloth with her fingertip. "I was wondering if you'd like to visit our old high school with me. Are you free?"

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Of course!" Then she suddenly turned to Victor, who was pretending to be invisible. "Why don't we drag him along too? Bet he hasn't stepped foot on campus since graduation."

Victor's back instantly broke out in a cold sweat. He'd been chatting animatedly with a classmate precisely to avoid Vivian's matchmaking attempts.

"Victor!" Vivian raised her voice.

The classmate beside him nudged him playfully. "She's calling you."

Victor turned stiffly, feigning ignorance. "Huh? What?"

His terrible acting made Vivian roll her eyes. Just as she was about to call him out, a server entered with their food.

Victor seized the distraction like a drowning man grabbing a lifeline. He immediately buried his face in his soup bowl, gulping it down as if his life depended on it.

Vivian smirked. "Playing deaf, are we? Then I'll take that as a yes. You're coming with us later."

Victor nearly choked. "If I show up at school looking like this, people will stare..."

"Oh, so now you can hear?" Vivian narrowed her eyes.

Victor rubbed his nose in frustration. Lately, he'd been slipping up constantly around Vivian.

"Well? Are you coming or not?" She drummed her fingers impatiently on the table.

Defeated, Victor nodded. His gaze flickered to Jasmine, only to find her eyes fixed adoringly on Vivian.

The scene reminded him of something Vivian once said—even friendships could be possessive. At least they were both girls, or he might actually feel jealous.

"Sounds fun. The more, the merrier," Jasmine said softly, a hint of disappointment flashing in her eyes.

Their table's commotion soon drew the attention of other classmates. The loudmouth beside Victor immediately proposed, "Why don't we all go? Give our old homeroom teacher a surprise!"

"Are you sure it'll be a surprise and not a shock?"
"Perfect! I can finally show my boyfriend our famous cafeteria."
"Sorry, I've got a meeting this afternoon..."

Amid the lively debate, Evelyn Carter watched from afar as Vivian got sandwiched between Jasmine and Victor. She sighed helplessly.

Matchmaking was proving much harder than she'd imagined.

Alexander Hamilton was meticulously peeling shrimp for Evelyn when he noticed her troubled expression. "I felt the same way when I visited them at the hospital last time."

It wasn't that he didn't want to help—Victor was just hopeless. If it were him, he would've noticed Jasmine's special attention toward Vivian ages ago.

Evelyn gave him a sympathetic look. "You've had it rough."

"Not rough," Alexander deadpanned. "Just cursed."

He picked up a piece of steamed fish, carefully removed the bones, dipped it in wasabi soy sauce, and placed it in Evelyn's bowl. Watching her enjoy it, he couldn't resist taking a bite himself.

Instantly, his face twisted in agony.

Evelyn burst out laughing. "Even I can't handle that flavor. What possessed you to try it?"
###Chapter 987 Restless

The sharp sting of wasabi still lingered on her tongue when Alexander Hamilton's voice cut through with unusual clarity: "I want to understand the present you better."

His gaze dropped to Evelyn Carter's rounded belly. Though her pregnancy-related symptoms had faded, a new unease gripped him—the inability to truly share her discomfort.

Evelyn traced the rim of her teacup before suggesting, "Come visit our old high school with me later."

Fetal movements made sitting still impossible, but her condition remained stable overall.

Delight flashed in Alexander's eyes, mistaking this as her opening the door to shared memories.

"Take notes," Mrs. Zhou nudged her husband, nodding toward Alexander peeling shrimp for Evelyn.

Zhou Liang caught on instantly, mimicking the gesture for his wife.

"I meant the romance, you blockhead," she laughed, shaking her head.

Time had softened the edges of this campus sweethearts-turned-parents. Studying the fine lines around his wife's eyes, Zhou suddenly proposed, "Let's revisit our alma mater too. Consider this a personal holiday."

Dappled shadows from plane trees danced across the empty Saturday campus. Alexander's umbrella remained steadfast over Evelyn as they walked the tree-lined path.

Behind them, Vivian Dempsey struggled to keep up with Victor Laurent's surprisingly nimble strides despite his crutches. Jasmine Valentine trailed silently, using her compact parasol to shield Vivian from stray sunlight.

"Notice?" Alexander murmured, "Vivian's playing matchmaker."

Evelyn shook her head. "Spectacular failure." She briefed him about Jasmine. "Always alone back then, like a startled rabbit."

Recognition flickered in his eyes. "The classmate who got mugged?"

"You should set up a fortune-telling booth," Evelyn teased, secretly impressed by his recall.

Every corner of the campus triggered memories. Victor excitedly pointed at the refurbished field. "Those plastic bleachers were falling apart in our day!"

He suddenly bolted toward the bubble tea shop, crutches tapping at breakneck speed. Vivian gave chase while Jasmine fumbled with her parasol, instantly left behind.

"Care for tea?" Alexander indicated the shaded patio seating. "We could rest awhile."

No sooner had Evelyn settled than Victor's confused voice carried from the counter: "What's...this 'Boba Tea'?"

Vivian leaned in with mischief. "Say it properly."

"Did your Chinese regress?" She batted her lashes, deliberately provoking him.
###Chapter 988: Don't Hold Back

"Of course I know it!" Victor Laurent's voice suddenly rose an octave as he stubbornly stared at the drink menu. "Isn't it that... what's it called... Boba Milk Tea? Get me one with ice!"

The bubble tea shop employee stifled laughter, shoulders shaking. Vivian Dempsey doubled over in hysterics. "You actually said it out loud? Hahaha..."

Even the usually stoic Alexander Hamilton couldn't help curling his lips.

He hadn't meant to laugh, but Victor's expression while pronouncing the cutesy drink name was priceless—a six-foot-tall man grimacing through the saccharine beverage title.

Alexander instinctively glanced toward Evelyn Carter under the parasol. She was smiling too.

Her crescent-moon eyes sparkled in the sunlight, radiating quiet beauty.

Alexander couldn't look away. No one noticed Jasmine Valentine watching Vivian with the same intensity—she wasn't laughing at Victor, but simply mirroring Vivian's joy.

Victor, thick-skinned as ever, asked, "What are you all having? My treat today."

Vivian wiped tears of laughter. "Same as you."

Jasmine fidgeted with her bag strap, hesitant.

"Can you handle ice?" Vivian slung an arm around her shoulders. "Don't hold back—order something expensive."

Jasmine pressed her lips together, smiling. "I'll have the same."

Five drinks arrived quickly.

Alexander returned to Evelyn with two jasmine milk teas, their little world complete.

Victor stared at his plain pearl milk tea, temple twitching. "It's just regular bubble tea! Why give it such a ridiculous name?"

"It's an internet meme," Vivian said incredulously. "Don't tell me you actually didn't know?"

Victor reached for his drink with his crutch but nearly toppled—balancing on one foot while holding a cup proved impossible.

"To-go, please," he sighed to the employee.

Vivian rolled her eyes and snatched both cups. "Keep standing like that and you'll faceplant."

"Jinx! Don't curse me!"

"If I could actually jinx people, I'd use it on clients to make them give all contracts to Dempsey Group..." Work talk dominated Vivian's every third sentence.

Jasmine stood quietly nearby, eyes smiling. Vivian, not wanting to exclude her, kept drawing her into conversation.

"The southern market has huge potential. Once production capacity increases next year, we should expand..."

She'd intended to find common ground, but Jasmine earnestly engaged:

"I know some material suppliers there—I could ask around..."

"The school's distance doesn't matter, I pass by often..."

"If you need a tour guide, I can..."

Vivian got pulled into work talk until realizing Victor was boredly slurping pearls.

Changing topics abruptly felt forced, so she switched to drinks: "Is the campus bubble tea shop still there? I miss it."

Victor said gloomily, "It was under construction when I transferred."

Jasmine murmured, "I didn't drink these much in school."

Vivian suddenly remembered the three of them were the only classmates who skipped graduation trip. Memories flooded back, draining her complexion. "It's so hot..."

This trick always worked.

Victor touched her cup—the ice had completely melted. He grabbed his crutch to buy menthol oil.

Jasmine moved faster, pulling menthol oil, bug spray, wipes... and miraculously produced a folding fan, gently fanning Vivian. "Better now?"
###Chapter 989: I Want to Pursue Her

"I'm fine." Vivian Dempsey waved her hand, her cheeks still flushed with lingering embarrassment. She had only pretended to faint to diffuse the awkward tension earlier, never expecting Evelyn Carter to take it so seriously.

A decade had passed in the blink of an eye. The carefree teenagers who once laughed and played in these classrooms had grown into adults—some chasing careers, others finding joy in the simple routines of parenthood.

Though reluctant to leave their alma mater, the returning alumni respectfully avoided interrupting ongoing classes. They exchanged distant greetings outside the classrooms before dispersing in small groups, each retracing memories in familiar corners.

Victor Laurent stubbornly insisted on visiting the newly renovated sports field, leaning heavily on his crutches. Unable to dissuade him, Vivian reluctantly supported his slow progress while Jasmine Valentine followed behind.

Under the shade of a café umbrella, Evelyn stirred the ice cubes in her drink. Across from her, Alexander Hamilton held a pearl milk tea—a beverage he'd normally never touch. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling his sharply defined profile.

"Mind if I join you?" A young man in black-framed glasses stood politely by their table.

Alexander's brow furrowed briefly before smoothing. After all, this was Evelyn's classmate—he couldn't be too obvious.

"Simon Evans?" Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Long time no see."

Simon adjusted his glasses, gaze flickering between them. "Sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to ask Evelyn something."

His quiet voice carried unmistakable resolve: "Are Vivian and Victor together now?"

Alexander's eyebrow arched at the blunt question. This Simon Evans spoke and acted with refreshing directness—a promising trait.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Why the sudden interest?"

"Because," Simon inhaled deeply, "I want to pursue Vivian."

Evelyn nearly choked on her tea. Her gaze drifted toward the field where Vivian chatted animatedly with Jasmine, while Victor sat apart, fiddling with his crutches like an outsider.

"This is a reunion, not a matchmaking event," Evelyn sighed. What was with everyone suddenly eyeing old classmates today?

Alexander remained unfazed. The reunion horror stories Vincent Wilson had shared with him were ten times more dramatic than anything online. Compared to those, courting a single alumna seemed perfectly normal.

Simon followed their line of sight, lips quirking upward. "Just as I thought—some things never change."

Evelyn couldn't argue. The evidence was plain before them.

"In high school," Simon recalled, "Vivian and Victor were inseparable until Simon Stapleton appeared—"

Hearing that name, Evelyn and Alexander simultaneously frowned. These days, Vivian only referred to that person as "Third Place," refusing to even speak his name.

Disgust flashed in Simon's eyes. "During one monthly exam, Vivian was the only one who solved the final math problem. I wanted to ask for her help, but Simon Stapleton stopped me, claiming I'd distract her."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "I actually believed him—he ranked third while I was thirteenth. Only when he cheated his way into that early admission spot did I understand."

Evelyn nodded faintly. She recognized that helplessness.

"After results came out, I considered comforting Vivian," Simon's voice dropped, "but feared she'd think I was gloating. I'd overperformed on that test, after all."

Evelyn studied him thoughtfully. "You attended a top university, didn't you? Working in securities now?"

Her subtext was clear: With credentials like yours, why fixate on an old classmate?

Simon understood her hesitation. "The truth is, Vivian and I shared more moments than anyone realized."
###Chapter 990: Politeness Is for Strangers

Sunlight streamed through the glass window, casting golden reflections on Evelyn's coffee cup. She stirred her latte absently.

"Do you remember that lost girl from high school?" Simon adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "The one crying in the hallway with a fruit basket? Vivian helped her find the classroom."

Evelyn's fingers stilled.

She searched her memories but only recalled Vivian's habit of sneaking to the snack bar between classes. The fruit-bearing girl left no impression.

"My apologies," Evelyn took a sip, "It was too long ago."

Simon's eyes crinkled behind his lenses. "No matter. She was my little sister. She wouldn't stop talking about how kind and cheerful Senior Vivian was."

His soft voice carried unmistakable nostalgia.

"Another time," he continued, "my study notes got soaked. Vivian immediately fetched me a fresh set from the teachers' office."

Evelyn's cup hovered mid-air.

These fragments assembled like puzzle pieces, revealing a complete picture—Vivian had always been this warm presence in unnoticed corners.

"Your memory," Evelyn set down her cup, "is impressive."

Simon's ears pinkened. "Not memory. Some people..." He hesitated. "They're like sunlight. You can't forget where they've shone."

The café's background music shifted to a gentle piano melody flowing between them.

Understanding dawned on Evelyn.

"So," she met Simon's gaze directly, "today's meeting is about Vivian's current life?"

Simon traced the cup's rim nervously. "Is she...still single?"

The window reflected Alexander's approaching figure. Fresh from a conference call, his tailored suit accentuated his frame as he paused briefly behind Evelyn, assessing Simon.

"Discussing something important?" Alexander pulled out a chair effortlessly.

Simon's spine stiffened. "Mr. Hamilton."

Alexander nodded before turning to Evelyn. "Uncle Dempsey called. He's inviting us for dinner this weekend." His tone carried implication. "Victor will attend."

Simon's spoon clinked sharply against porcelain.

Watching the silent duel between the men, Evelyn suppressed amusement.

"Mr. Evans," she broke the tension, "Vivian is indeed single. But matters of the heart..."

"I understand." Simon inhaled deeply. "I'm not proposing to pursue her immediately. If possible, I'd appreciate a proper reintroduction."

Alexander chuckled. "All this trouble for that?"

The air froze.

Evelyn kicked Alexander under the table. He remained unflinching. "I can arrange it."

"Alex!" She glared.

Simon stood abruptly. "I'll take my leave then." He moved with hurried grace, vanishing before Alexander could reconsider.

Evelyn whirled on Alexander. "Have you lost your mind? Uncle Dempsey would never—"

"Tell me," Alexander stirred his coffee leisurely, "does Uncle Dempsey care more about his son-in-law's identity? Or his daughter's happiness?"

Sunlight shifted, dappling his sharp profile with fractured gold.

Evelyn fell silent.

"Besides," Alexander leaned in, voice dropping, "that kick was adorable."

Heat flooded Evelyn's ears. She averted her gaze. "This is serious."

"So am I." Alexander straightened. "Simon and Victor each have merits, but the choice belongs to Vivian."

A pause. "Just like when you chose to forgive me."

Outside, plane tree leaves rustled. One drifted onto the windowsill.

Evelyn watched it, her smile softening. "You're right. Although..." She narrowed her eyes. "Did you deliberately provoke Simon?"

Alexander raised his cup, hiding a smirk. "Who's to say?"
###Chapter 991: Overdoing It

Alexander Hamilton's lips curved slightly, his eyes gleaming with confidence. "I bet Victor Laurent will be the first to react. Care to make it interesting?"

"No bets." Evelyn Carter refused bluntly. "You picked Victor, so I'm stuck with Simon Evans. But Vivian Dempsey would never choose him."

She absently stroked her rounded belly, her gaze clear and composed.

Alexander chuckled, caught in his own scheme. "I was going to wager a family trip. After the baby comes, let's take a vacation—just the two of us."

His eyes lingered on Evelyn's tired profile, heart aching. She'd endured so much lately. How he wished he could whisk her away from it all.

"We'll see." She didn't outright reject the idea, a gentle smile playing at her lips.

Alexander's eyes brightened.

"First, explain your reasoning." Evelyn steered the conversation back on track, glancing toward the distant bleachers.

The original trio had become four, yet the divide was stark. Simon stood close to Victor, while Vivian leaned toward Jasmine Valentine. Though their expressions were unclear, their animated conversation was obvious.

"Simon and Vivian are talking." Alexander narrowed his eyes.

The distance would challenge most, but his vision missed nothing.

"He's asking Vivian about financial planning..." Alexander narrated as if standing beside them.

Evelyn blinked. "You can see that from here?"

The奶茶店 was at least eighty meters away!

"I know a bit of lip-reading." His tone was casual, but Evelyn recognized his understatement—when Alexander said "a bit," he meant mastery.

Under the scorching sun, Evelyn couldn't walk further. "Then be my eyes."

On the bleachers, Simon was deep in discussion with Vivian. Normally reserved, he now spoke with uncharacteristic fluency, his professional expertise shining through.

Victor didn't notice at first—until their rapport became undeniable.

Logically, Simon should be discussing business with Alexander. The Hamilton Group dominated Hudson City's finance sector. Yet he'd chosen the Dempsey Group—a company fresh from a delisting scandal.

"Visit my office on a weekday," Vivian's voice held hopeful notes. "We're trying to relist, but the roadblocks..."

Her first application had been rejected outright, and few managers would touch the case since. She hadn't burdened Evelyn with these worries, not wanting to stress the pregnant woman. Instead, she'd opened up to this near-stranger, a former classmate.

Victor's alarm bells rang. He interrupted, heedless of abruptness. "Perfect timing—I want to invest! Take this future shareholder along!"

The excuse was hastily fabricated but plausible.

Vivian laughed. "This is a business meeting, not a field trip."

"It is business!" Victor protested like a petulant child. "I want to see how building materials are produced!"

Unable to dissuade him, Vivian relented. "Fine."

Simon adjusted his glasses, observing coldly. Their dynamic resembled bickering friends, which oddly boosted his confidence.

Noticing Simon's gaze, Victor immediately puffed up like a preening rooster.

From afar, Evelyn and Alexander simultaneously facepalmed.

"Young and energetic? More like juvenile." Evelyn sighed. "Vivian did say she liked younger men, but this is excessive."
###Chapter 992: The Adult World

Evelyn's finger hovered over her phone screen before she finally locked it. She desperately wanted to text Victor right now: Wrong approach—the harder you try, the more awkward it gets!

Alexander's lips twitched imperceptibly. He'd thought his own courtship of Evelyn had been clumsy enough, but someone had just set a new standard for awkwardness.

This Mr. Laurent was the living embodiment of "hopelessly obtuse."

After a moment's consideration, Alexander chose to remain silent. He turned to Evelyn instead. "Sometimes a little crisis is healthy."

"What do you mean?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"If someone never recognizes the problem, no amount of effort will help." Alexander steepled his fingers beneath his chin. "At least he's taking action now, even if his methods are off."

Amusement flickered in Evelyn's eyes. "I didn't realize you were such an expert."

"In relationships, the real danger isn't making mistakes—it's lacking the courage to try at all." He delivered this sagely, completely unaware the words applied equally to himself.

Evelyn's gaze grew increasingly knowing as she studied him.

This Mr. Hamilton's theoretical knowledge had certainly advanced by leaps and bounds.

"Since you're so experienced," Evelyn suddenly leaned closer, "why don't you play relationship counselor for them?"

Alexander's pupils dilated. "Me?"

"Weren't you just making perfect sense?" Evelyn coaxed skillfully. "Practice makes perfect."

She used the same persuasive tone reserved for interns, effortlessly steering Alexander into confusion.

Alexander had never been able to resist Evelyn's gentle persuasion. Even knowing it was a trap, he stepped right in. "Alright, I'll try."

If it made her happy, he'd walk through fire.

Evelyn nearly softened. Then she reconsidered—if she didn't keep Alexander occupied, he'd probably cling to her 24/7.

Her hand drifted unconsciously to her rounded abdomen. Just five more months until she could return to the operating table.

This peaceful life worried her. She feared she might grow too accustomed to it.

The setting sun painted the sky as students streamed out of campus in small groups.

"I hated school so much, but now I kind of miss it."
"Back to work tomorrow—I wish I could return to senior year."
"When's our next reunion?"
"Anytime!"

Evelyn walked at the rear, listening with a faint smile.

"What are you thinking?" Alexander asked quietly.

"Adult promises," Evelyn gazed into the distance. "Always sincere when spoken, but hard to keep when the time comes."

She understood reality's weight all too well. Work, family, life—which wasn't more pressing than a class reunion?

Alexander studied her composed profile with equal parts admiration and ache. How he wished to be the one who loosened her rationality.

They walked on slowly, unaware Vivian and Jasmine had fallen behind.

Jasmine suddenly tugged Vivian's sleeve. "Can you come to the restroom with me?"

"Now?" Vivian looked baffled.

Jasmine bit her lip and nodded, her eyes flickering like a startled fawn.

Vivian could never refuse that look. "Of course."

This left Victor and Simon standing beneath the plane trees in frozen silence.

Simon scrolled through his phone, perfectly at ease. Victor leaned on his crutches, radiating discomfort.

"So..." Victor broke the silence. "I heard you're visiting the Dempsey Group? Should we exchange contacts?"

Simon glanced up, his gaze lingering on Victor's cast. "You really want to balance on crutches while texting?"
###Chapter 993: Ripples of Fate

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows that swayed gently on the cobblestone path.

Simon Evans' gaze lingered on Victor Laurent's cast-encased leg, a flicker of complexity in his eyes. He hadn't cared about this stranger's injury—until Vivian Dempsey's worried glance changed his mind before she left.

"Need help?" Simon gestured to a nearby stone bench.

Victor reacted like a cat with its tail stepped on. He hoisted himself up with startling agility using his crutches, practically leaping to the bench—an improbable feat for someone injured.

The corner of Simon's mouth lifted as he settled on the opposite end. "Have we met before?"

"No." Victor's reply was brittle, his fingers drumming restlessly against the crutch.

Simon chuckled, cutting straight to the chase. "You're in love with Vivian."

It wasn't a question.

Victor stiffened, mental alarms blaring. He'd caught Simon's unspoken "too"—and that single syllable set his teeth on edge. "Don't tell me you're planning to confess today?"

His grip on the crutch turned white-knuckled. If Simon dared nod, he'd intercept that confession if it killed him.

"Not yet." Simon's eyes drifted toward the wisteria trellis. "I don't exist in her memories of youth."

The words doused Victor like ice water. A bitter realization struck—wasn't he in the same boat? To Vivian, he'd always just be the troublemaking buddy.

The forest breeze stilled. Even the cicadas fell silent.

"Mr. Laurent," Simon said with businesslike calm, "Neither of us is her only option. Every eligible bachelor in Hudson City knows the Dempseys are seeking a son-in-law."

Victor's chest constricted. He'd assumed there was time—forgotten how Vivian never lacked suitors. Meanwhile, he might not even make the shortlist.

——

Beneath the wisteria trellis, Jasmine Valentine twisted her fingers together. "I lied earlier. There's something I need to say..."

Vivian gave her shoulder a hearty slap. "Obviously! Those two were cramping our style. Spill the tea!"

"Thank you." Jasmine lifted tear-bright eyes. "Ten years overdue."

Vivian blinked. "Ten years ago?"

"When you and Victor fought those hoodlums for me." Jasmine's voice feathered away.

Recognition dawned, followed by a laugh. "That? Victor got pummeled worse than I did! You should thank him."

She turned to call for him, but Jasmine caught her wrist.

"It's different." A tear escaped. "That night...I was going to jump off the rooftop."

Vivian's smile froze.

"That money was half my monthly allowance." Jasmine trembled. "When I overheard you telling Evelyn Carter to keep it secret in the hospital...I realized someone cared about a stranger's dignity that much."

The sunlight turned blinding. Vivian's lips parted soundlessly. She'd never imagined that impulsive act had altered another life's course.

Wisteria blossoms drifted down like purple snow.
###Chapter 994: May I Hug You?

Jasmine Valentine looked directly into Vivian Dempsey's eyes, her voice soft but firm. "Not possibly. Definitely gone. The only reason I came back from the rooftop was seeing the police investigating at school. If you hadn't suggested confronting those delinquents for my money, they wouldn't have shown up."

Vivian's breath hitched as if something heavy had slammed into her chest. Complex emotions swirled in her eyes as she gazed at Jasmine. "I'm sorry."

Jasmine froze, the bitterness on her lips solidifying. "Why apologize?"

She should be the one apologizing. Years ago, Vivian had pulled her back from death's edge, yet she'd lacked even the courage to push open that hospital door and say thank you.

Vivian scratched her head, her ears turning slightly pink. "I thought you kept glancing over because you liked Victor Laurent. I even tried playing matchmaker... Turns out I was projecting."

Jasmine blinked, then suddenly laughed softly. "No wonder you... I thought..." She shook her head, leaving the sentence unfinished.

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling her face with shifting patterns. In that mosaic of light and shadow, she asked quietly, "Do I count as your friend now? Not the kind you introduce to others."

"Of course," Vivian answered without hesitation.

Jasmine took a deep breath. "Then... may I hug you?"

Before the words fully left her mouth, Vivian had already opened her arms, enveloping her in a firm embrace. Jasmine stood half a head shorter, completely encircled by Vivian's hold.

Closing her eyes, Jasmine's lashes fluttered faintly. After a moment, she was the first to release the hug.

An indescribable atmosphere lingered between them.

Watching Jasmine walk away, Vivian's brows unconsciously furrowed.

"You're back from the restroom already? The nearest one's inside the building," Victor Laurent suddenly spoke up, breaking the silence.

Vivian rolled her eyes. "If you ever want to date anyone, never ask women that question."

"Why?" Victor looked genuinely puzzled.

"Restroom trips are private. Either it's urgent or for touch-ups. Which scenario warrants follow-up questions?" Vivian ground out through clenched teeth.

Victor's eyes lit up. "So is this a date now?"

Vivian clenched her fists. "Don't make me ruin my good mood by punching you."

She planted one hand on her hip, the other braced against Victor's chair back, bristling like an irritated cat.

Victor immediately raised his hands in surrender.

Simon Evans, who'd remained silent until now, interjected mildly, "Vivian, stop scaring Victor. He looks about to suffocate."

"I'm not scared!" Victor protested instantly.

Simon smiled gently. "Fear is natural. No rule says men must be brave."

Victor opened his mouth, then realized any explanation would sound wrong.

"He's faking," Vivian said with a disdainful curl of her lip. "Been like this since childhood."

A flicker of envy passed through Simon's eyes. "I envy your long-standing bond. My three years at First High were all study, no close friends."

Vivian's expression softened. "We're getting acquainted now. We're all friends here."

She nudged Victor with her elbow, but he suddenly turned toward the school gate.

A tall, imposing figure strode against the flow of students—Alexander Hamilton returning.

"Mr. Hamilton!" Victor waved like a drowning man spotting rescue.

Alexander approached with long strides, his aura forbidding. "Evelyn was worried. Sent me to check on you."

His gaze swept over the trio, noting Jasmine's absence but asking no questions.
###Chapter 995: Secondary Injury

Simon Evans adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his gaze lingering on Alexander Hamilton's sharp profile. He considered asking for help but immediately sensed the icy aura around the CEO in Evelyn Carter's absence.

Victor Laurent, however, yelled like a drowning man clutching at straws, "Mr. Hamilton, save me! Vivian Dempsey's going to beat me up at Disneyland! I need Dr. Carter to mediate!"

Dragging his casted leg, he miraculously scrambled into the backseat of the custom Mercedes V-Class—spacious enough for three, specially chosen by Alexander for Evelyn's comfort.

Alexander glanced at the rearview mirror. Seeing Evelyn's calm expression, he silently fastened his seatbelt. Though their private time was interrupted, he wouldn't complain if she didn't mind.

Noticing Victor had been "rescued," Vivian turned to Simon. "How are you getting back?"

"I had some red wine at lunch." Simon stood under the dappled shade of plane trees, fractured sunlight scattering across his tall frame. "But it should've metabolized by now."

Vivian frowned. "You'll lose your license if caught. Want me to drive your car back? I'm heading to Evelyn's anyway—can take the subway later to retrieve mine."

Thud. Victor stuck his head out the window. "What, Mr. Securities Elite doesn't know how to swipe a metro card?" His sarcastic tone instantly overpowered the floral scent in the air with vinegar.

Simon adjusted his glasses. "I lived in a basement in the suburbs after graduation. Four-hour daily commute." His quiet words made Vivian's eyes light up.

"Same! I rode the subway daily during Dempsey Group's crisis." She eagerly launched into startup war stories.

Within moments, Simon naturally slid into her passenger seat. "Mind if I hitch a ride? I'll collect my car tomorrow." His fingers lightly brushed the knitted charm on her rearview mirror. "Did you make this? Adorable."

Victor, watching from the other car, nearly chewed through the window frame in frustration. Alexander and Evelyn exchanged an amused glance.

"Should we follow?" Alexander tapped the steering wheel.

Victor hissed through clenched teeth, "That's my seat!"

Evelyn kindly reminded him, "You sat in the back last time."

The Mercedes glided after Vivian's car. Victor clawed at the seat, his injured foot unconsciously grinding into the mat. Evelyn suddenly spoke: "Secondary fractures might require steel pins."

Victor froze instantly, a horrifying image flashing through his mind—him hobbling on crutches at Vivian's wedding.

"So," Evelyn met his eyes directly, "when did you start having feelings for Vivian?"
###Chapter 996: No Innocent Players Here

If not for Alexander Hamilton's cryptic warning, Evelyn Carter would still be in the dark. She'd always assumed Vivian Dempsey and Victor Laurent were just exceptionally close friends.

Back in their school days, the trio was inseparable—especially during group activities. But only now did Evelyn realize how deeply Victor's feelings for Vivian ran.

"You're not the only one who missed it," Victor admitted with a bitter smile, his brow shadowed with melancholy. "Even I didn't realize until after I left the country..."

His voice caught. The origins of these emotions were unclear—perhaps they'd grown gradually through daily interactions, or maybe the seed was planted at their first meeting. Now, it hardly mattered.

"My parents were open-minded," he said quietly. "Before Australia, they gave me a choice—leave with them or stay. At the time... I hesitated."

Evelyn sensed the unspoken reason. "Because Simon Stapleton was with Vivian?"

Victor's knuckles whitened as he nodded mechanically. "If I'd known his true nature... I might not have gone. But I was naive enough to believe they genuinely loved each other."

Suddenly, his head snapped up, eyes blazing. "I won't let Vivian get hurt again!"

This was the first time Evelyn had seen such hostility from him. She softened her tone. "So what's your plan? Following her like this? You know better than anyone that'll backfire."

Victor took several steadying breaths before confessing awkwardly, "Truth is... I can't find fault with Simon Evans. He's been transparent with me. It's just... I envy how well Vivian treats him."

Rare vulnerability colored his admission.

Evelyn chose her words carefully. "If—hypothetically—Vivian rejected you, what then?"

The question struck like a dagger. Victor had never considered the possibility, childishly believing persistence would eventually win her over.

"I would—" He froze mid-sentence, eyes widening. "Wait, why are we at my apartment?"

By the residential side gate, Vivian was bidding farewell to Simon, who held an access card.

"Just meant to vent about difficult clients," she said, smoothing her hair self-consciously. "Didn't expect to ramble so long. Funny—Victor lives nearby too."

With Evelyn and Victor, Vivian spoke freely. But around Simon, she instinctively moderated herself.

Simon followed her gaze. "Victor lives in that building?"

"For now." Her vague reply protected her friend's privacy.

Then she sensed it—the strange tension between two men who should have no connection. Had they clashed at the gathering?

Vivian mentally rolled her eyes but defended Victor aloud. "After nearly a decade abroad, his Chinese is rusty. If he said anything inappropriate—"

"Already forgotten." Simon adjusted his glasses with an easy smile. "Old classmates shouldn't hold grudges."

The polished response showcased generosity while subtly relegating Victor to "old classmate" status.

Vivian exhaled in relief. "Good. He's just impulsive, actually—"

Rapid crutch taps interrupted her. Victor was approaching at alarming speed.

"The doctor only approved temporary discharge!" Vivian immediately switched to battle mode. "Your caregiver's waiting at the hospital! No shortcuts until that cast comes off!"

She knew Victor too well—even his medical charts required her personal inspection.
###Chapter 997: Undercurrents

Evelyn Carter linked arms with Alexander Hamilton as they stepped into Victor Laurent's new apartment. Simon Evans stood hesitantly by the door before Vivian Dempsey enthusiastically pulled him inside.

The bachelor pad had minimalist decor, exuding the polished sterility of a showroom. But a few personal items Victor had added before his injury lent the space a lived-in warmth.

"Drinks are in the fridge. Coffee machine's in the kitchen." Victor flopped onto the couch with his crutches, his casted right leg propped on an ottoman. "Can't play host properly with this leg."

He tossed his crutches aside, relaxing into the cushions like a king reclaiming his throne.

Vivian disappeared into the kitchen and emerged moments later with a tray of carefully prepared beverages.

Evelyn accepted a warm honey lemon water. Black coffee sat before Alexander. Simon received room-temperature sparkling water, while Vivian and Victor each cracked open an icy cola.

"You remembered my favorite." Victor's eyes lit up as he clinked cans with Vivian. The fizz burst on his tongue, drawing an involuntary smile.

Simon twisted his bottle cap slowly. "I'm surprised you recalled my preference for sparkling water, Miss Dempsey."

Victor's grin froze. His cola suddenly tasted flat.

"I thought you only drank plain water?" he asked pointedly, fighting the urge to dump every sparkling water in the fridge.

Alexander, who'd been tucking a pillow behind Evelyn's back, arched an eyebrow. He tested the mug's temperature before handing it to his wife.

Evelyn sipped her drink, watching the subtle tension between the two men with quiet amusement.

Vivian gulped her cola, oblivious to the charged atmosphere. "At least sparkling water has some flavor. Picking up these details comes from entertaining clients."

Her diplomatic answer only made Victor's chest tighten. He nearly choked on his drink.

"Easy there." Simon handed him a napkin, his glasses glinting. "There's something I've been meaning to mention."

Though a guest, he carried himself with the ease of a host.

Victor crushed his empty can. "Spit it out."

"My colleagues all gave up cola when trying to conceive," Simon adjusted his glasses. "Though I'm single now, it's never too early to consider my future wife's wellbeing."

Vivian sighed, recalling her disastrous blind dates. "Men with your consideration are rare these days. The guys my dad introduces are either mama's boys or overconfident jerks."

"Perhaps it's not that modern men are lacking," Simon said meaningfully, "but that our class set higher standards—with a few exceptions, of course."

For the first time, clear disdain colored his words. Evelyn recognized his jab at Simon Stapleton but felt an inexplicable unease.

This man calculated every word, each sentence carefully designed to align himself closer to Vivian.

Evelyn took a delicate sip. "Moderation matters when preparing for pregnancy, but avoiding alcohol and smoking suffices. Cola's impact is negligible."

Her gentle tone carried an undercurrent that made Simon pause. He pressed smoothly, "But I've heard cola affects sperm motility?"
###Chapter 998: The Truth About Cola

Alexander Hamilton's gaze lingered on Victor Laurent's face for a moment.

Those deep eyes held no trace of deception—only pure concern.

Though Evelyn Carter had left the hospital over two months ago, her instincts as a doctor were ingrained in her bones. She leaned forward slightly, her voice gentle yet professional: "That's actually a common misconception. Many couples trying to conceive ask the same question."

Her eyes drifted to the can of cola in Victor's hand. "As long as it doesn't come into direct contact with sperm, cola won't affect quality. However—" Her tone shifted. "The phosphorus and caffeine content can increase the risk of osteoporosis."

Victor's smile froze mid-lift.

With a defeated sigh, he set the can back on the coffee table. The aluminum clinked sharply against the glass surface.

"See?" Vivian Dempsey arched an eyebrow triumphantly. "You'll believe a doctor's word, won't you? I'm taking you back to the hospital later. No wandering off until that cast comes off."

Her tone brooked no argument.

Victor nodded dejectedly, but his spine straightened abruptly when he caught the dimmed look in Simon Evans' eyes.

The label of "friend" was both a shackle and an opportunity.

The lingering heat of summer clung stubbornly to the air. The group had taken refuge in the air-conditioned apartment when an abrupt silence fell over the living room.

Alexander chose that moment to speak. "I heard the Dempsey Group has been facing some difficulties lately?" His gaze settled on Vivian. "If you need help, just say the word."

The offer was delivered casually, yet carried the weight of a boulder. The influence of the Hamilton Group could easily crush the mountains looming over the Dempsey family.

"No need." Vivian refused without hesitation. "The Dempsey Group handles its own problems."

Evelyn shot Alexander a questioning look.

They'd agreed to assist discreetly.

Alexander returned a reassuring glance.

"Who dares give you trouble?" Victor suddenly slammed the table as he stood. "Once my leg heals, I'll teach them a lesson myself!"

The familiar line made Vivian burst into laughter. "Please, in your condition? If you really want to help, just collapse dramatically in front of them."

"Professional scam artist for twenty years!" Victor gestured theatrically. "I won Best Actor in drama club, you know!"

Laughter quickly filled the room.

Only Evelyn didn't join in.

Suddenly, she understood Alexander's intention.

Victor was indeed a good friend—but as a partner? Far too immature.

Simon waited for the laughter to fade before speaking. "Last week, a client asked if we could prevent typhoons from affecting stock prices." He spread his hands helplessly. "I had to explain we're not the weather bureau."

"Oh my god!" Vivian slapped her thigh excitedly. "I've had that too! They demanded direct shipping routes straight through uninhabited zones!"

The two quickly fell into animated conversation, jumping from eccentric clients to industry anecdotes.

Victor tried several times to interject but found himself utterly out of his depth. No matter how beautiful architectural designs were, they couldn't compete with the thrill of financial markets.

Watching the light fade from Victor's eyes, Alexander shook his head imperceptibly.

The opportunity had been given. Who could he blame for failing to seize it?

By the time dusk settled, Simon rose to leave. Vivian reluctantly arranged to meet him for dinner another day.

After seeing Simon out, Vivian grabbed Victor's arm. "Let's go, patient."

Victor mechanically picked up his crutches, following her toward the elevator like a marionette.

Evelyn held Alexander back. "We'll take the next one."

The elevator doors slid shut.

Supporting Evelyn, Alexander remarked casually, "This apartment was a good choice. Convenient location—ideal for someone with limited mobility."

"Vivian's always reliable." Evelyn sighed softly. "Except when it comes to matters of the heart."
###Chapter 999: Double Blessings

Evelyn's fingers absently traced the sofa armrest. Her voice was feather-light. "Vivian may seem carefree, but she feels things more deeply than anyone."

Memories surfaced—Vivian sobbing over her first love in college, then forcing smiles through her divorce.

Alexander's palm suddenly covered her chilled hand.

"Why are you so cold?" His brows knitted together. "Aren't pregnant women supposed to run hot?"

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "Reading my research papers again?"

Since her leave from work, she'd been compiling pregnancy observations into an academic paper. Medical journals littered the sunroom chaise.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "You've been dozing off mid-page lately. I—"

The elevator's ding cut him off. He stepped protectively in front of her, shielding her in the corner like a human barricade.

Evelyn studied her rounded belly. At six months with twins, she'd experienced backaches sooner than most expectant mothers. Fine lines had begun framing her eyes.

"Page 37 notes that drowsiness is more pronounced in twin pregnancies," she murmured.

Alexander stared blankly at the elevator buttons, missing this crucial detail entirely.

Vivian's car was already gone. Evelyn gazed at the empty parking spot, recalling her red-eyed friend vowing, "This time I'll choose wisely." She touched her stomach, words dissolving unspoken.

During the drive home, Evelyn counted streetlights from the backseat. At the third right turn, she caught Alexander stealing glances in the rearview mirror. Their eyes met—then darted away, both feigning interest in the scenery.

The aroma of fish soup greeted them. Grace poked her head from the kitchen with a plate of sweet-and-sour ribs. "Perfect timing!"

Dinner brimmed with warmth. Aunt Margaret served Evelyn a fifth bowl of soup while Alexander's chopsticks hovered over steamed fish for ten minutes—meticulously removing every bone.

Evelyn's appetite fled at the mountain of deboned fish in her bowl.

The shower stopped. Changing into maternity pajamas, she found Alexander sitting rigidly on the bed. They spoke simultaneously: "We need to talk."

His robe gaped open, revealing his chest. He sat like a defendant awaiting sentencing, spine unnaturally straight.

"Sit down first." Evelyn paced, hands supporting her aching back. Two tiny boxers practiced kicks inside her.

"I'm carrying twins."

Alexander shot upright, his robe falling open completely. His face drained of color. "The babies...are they—"

His voice shattered as ICU scenarios flashed through his mind. Private jets, global specialist consultations—emergency plans assembled at lightning speed.

"They're perfectly healthy." She cut off his spiral. "Just...there's two."

His pupils dilated violently. Jaw working, he suddenly dropped to one knee, trembling hands cradling her belly. "Two?"

Moonlight through the sheer curtains caught the glimmer in his reddened eyes. Evelyn realized—this man who commanded boardrooms now had fractured light clinging to his lashes.

"Yes, two." She clasped his hands. "You're going to be a father to two babies."

His throat convulsed. Burying his face against her soft abdomen, warm tears soaked through the nightgown. A tiny foot nudged against Evelyn's palm—answering its father's overwhelming love.
###Chapter 1000: Love-Induced Stupidity

Alexander's fingers tightened abruptly, his knuckles turning white. He feared Evelyn had fabricated this lie just to comfort him.

Feeling his tremor, Evelyn gently squeezed his hand in return. "It's true. If you don't believe me, you can feel for yourself. Or..." She paused, the corners of her lips lifting. "Come with me to my prenatal checkup next week? Olivia said they're two very healthy babies—a boy and a girl."

Alexander's breath hitched. Twins? He blinked mechanically, terrified this was just a beautiful dream. His heart pounded violently against his ribs, as if trying to break free. He pulled Evelyn into an embrace but caught himself at the last second, his arms hovering loosely around her waist.

The warm glow of the bedside lamp bathed the room in honeyed light, while the gentle hum of the heater brushed through their hair. Evelyn's cheeks gleamed like pearls under the soft illumination. Though her face had rounded slightly from pregnancy, her cool, composed eyes remained unchanged.

Compelled by some inexplicable force, Alexander lowered his head, his lips barely grazing her earlobe—a fleeting touch, almost imperceptible.

"Sorry, I'm just... too happy," he rasped, his voice rough with emotion. "I thought..."

Evelyn chuckled, tapping his forehead with her fingertip. "I know."

Their gazes met, unspoken words flowing between them. Just as Alexander leaned in again, a shrill ringtone shattered the quiet.

His expression darkened instantly, and he muted the call without hesitation. His fingers had barely brushed Evelyn's sleeve when she nudged him away. "Answer it."

"But—"

"At this hour? It must be urgent." She pointed at the wall clock. "What if it's a company emergency?"

Alexander gritted his teeth, pressing his forehead to hers. "Ignore it. Shouldn't we celebrate today?"

"Celebrate at 1 AM?" She poked his chest, exasperated. "Mr. Hamilton, pregnant women need sleep."

The ringing finally stopped. He exhaled in relief—only for Evelyn's phone to vibrate wildly.

They exchanged a glance and sighed in unison.

Alexander bent to retrieve her phone, deliberately avoiding the screen. Evelyn frowned at the unfamiliar number—Emily always called Alexander directly. Why would—

"Oh god, Vivian's cutting me off!" Victor's wail exploded through the speaker, startling Evelyn so badly she nearly dropped the phone.

Without missing a beat, Alexander steadied her and guided her to sit, then began massaging her swollen ankles with practiced ease.

"What happened?" Evelyn was baffled. Vivian had forgiven Victor for leaving without a word—why the sudden hostility?

Frantic rustling came through the line. "I just tried copying Simon's whole 'green tea' act to show her we're more compatible... and she said it made her skin crawl!" Victor's voice pitched higher. "Then I asked if she’s into Simon now!"

Evelyn and Alexander facepalmed simultaneously. This wasn't love-induced stupidity—this was a complete IQ wipeout.

After a long silence, Victor ventured weakly, "Did I... say the wrong thing?"

"What do you think?" Evelyn's temple throbbed, half-afraid prolonged exposure to this idiocy might be contagious.

Alexander took the phone, noting his own 99+ missed calls with an arched brow. "Never, under any circumstances, ask that question."

On his hospital bed, Victor stared blankly at the ceiling, gnawing his nails in despair. The switch in speakers didn't surprise him—where else would they be at this hour? He should've known.

Seeing Evelyn's drowsy eyes, Alexander decided to wrap this up. "Listen. Three things." He held up fingers. "First, stop imitating Simon immediately. Second, buy sunflowers and wait outside the Dempsey building. Third—" A pause. "Find the brain cells you lost."
