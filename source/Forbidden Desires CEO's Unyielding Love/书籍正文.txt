###Chapter 1 Another Secretary

"Hold on!"

Emily Thompson's dress strap had slid down to her waist. teasingly revealing more skin, while Patrick Rivera's touch ignited a fire within her. Their kisses deepened, bec crossing into uncharted territory.

But right at that crucial moment, Emily called for a break.

Patrick opened his amber eyes, clearly annoyed.

Emily took off the bracelet from her wrist and placed it on the nearby dresser.

Patrick glanced at it, his cool demeanor darkening.

"Seriously? You're worried about a cheap bracelet that costs less than five hundred bucks?" he asked.

The bracelet looked old-fashioned and downright tacky, like something found at a flea market. It had oxidized and discolored so much that it was practically falling apart.

Every time, Emily would take it off, clean it, and put
it back on.

Emily's long lashes hid her true feelings. "I'm just used to wearing it."

Patrick lifted her chin, forcing her to look at him.

"Are you used to the bracelet or something else?" he asked coldly.

Emily's attitude was submissive, but her eyes clearly showed she didn't want to answer. She pressed closer to him, kissing the corner of his mouth. "Mr. Rivera,let's continue."

Patrick wasn't stupid; she was using affection to divert his question.

However, her soft body reignited his desire.

He cupped her face and kissed her more fiercely,roughly flipping her onto the bed and pulling off her dress.


His large hands roamed possessively over her curves,his touch so intense that Emily's breath came in ragged gasps.

She tried to push him away to get some air, but every
time she retreated an inch, he advanced three.

In the end. Emily had to give up resisting and let herself relax to take his forceful advances.

Just then, Patrick's phone rang.

Emily turned her head to reach for it and glanced at the caller ID as she brought it to his face.

Patrick was already grabbing one of Emily's legs,ready to take the final step.

Seeing the caller, he stopped.

"Shirley, what's wrong?" He answered the call and quickly got off the bed.

Before he even left the room, Emily heard the gentle,clear voice on the other end."Patrick..."

Emily slowly sat up, looking at the disheveled sheets,knowing Patrick wouldn't be coming back. She went to the bathroom to take a shower.


When she came out in a loose bathrobe, Patrick was already preparing to leave.

He was fully dressed, even his tie was neatly in place.It was as if nothing had happened.
"Make sure all the meeting materials are organized.We'll need them for the nine o'clock meeting tomorrow," Patrick said coldly.

"Got it, Mr. Rivera," Emily replied.

Patrick used the tone of a boss giving orders to a subordinate. Emily naturally responded in the tone of a subordinate to a boss.

Patrick left without a trace of reluctance.

Emily looked down at the red marks on her chest from his rough kisses, feeling a bit desolate. She was Patrick's personal secretary. By day, she had to be the perfect professional at the office. By night,she was summoned to his presidential suite to fulfill his desires.

At work, she was excellent and professional. In bed,she was obedient and dutiful.

Patrick had said that what he liked about her was that she was useful and low-maintenance. Of course,that was all. She would never enter his heart.

In his heart was that girl named Shirley Wright.

The next day, Emily was heading back to her office
after dropping off some documents at Patrick's when she caught some gossip in the break room.

"Come on, spill the beans! I saw you stepping out of the Bentley!"

"Yeah,seriously,you really know how to keep things under wraps! When's the big announcement?"

"Mr. Rivera is always so serious. but when you're together, it's like he comes alive! 'Ms. Boss,' just remember us little people when you're running the company!"

Emily acted like she didn't hear anything and walked in to get some water.

Shirley was surrounded by a group of female colleagues,all showering her with compliments.

Shirley kept telling them to stop, but she was clearly enjoying the attention.

She smiled and waved her hand. "Mr.Rivera and I grew up together. Our families have been friends for generations. You guys shouldn't spread rumors.Besides, Emily is also close to Mr. Rivera, isn't she?"

Hearing her name, Emily slammed her cup on the
table. Finally, she got their attention.

They all fell silent, lowered their heads, and greeted her in unison. "Hi, Emily."

Shirley said. "Sorry. Emily, we weren't trying to slack off. We'll get back to work right away."

Shirley looked pitiful, making Emily seem like the villainous secretary. But Emily hadn't said a word.

That was Shirley's skill; she could make it seem like the whole world was bullying her.She was beautiful and charming, and her innocent demeanor made people want to protect her. That was probably why Patrick liked her.

Emily said, "I didn't say you were slacking off. you don't need to pin this on me..."

Emily hadn't finished speaking when Shirley started apologizing again.

"Shirley's new to the company, so give her a hand and show her the ropes."

Emily looked up to see Patrick entering the room, his distant expression carrying a hint of reproach.
"Please make sure to take good care of her," he added.


Patrick walked over to Emily. his gaze telling her this was an order,not a request.

Before Emily could respond. Patrick turned to Shirley.playfully tapping her head with an ID badge. "Don't forget your badge next time."

Shirley shrank back. sticking out her tongue. "Thanks.Patrick. I won't forget again."

Their intimate behavior was blatant. Everyone else quickly got the hint and left.

Finally, it was Emily's turn to leave. She looked down and nodded. "I'll be going now. Mr. Rivera."

As she walked out of the break room, she could still hear Shirley and Patrick talking. Shirley was complaining about not having enough breakfast and wanting a sandwich from three blocks away.

Patrick responded gently. "Sure, let's have Emily get it."

Standing outside the break room, Emily felt unsettled.The ID badge Patrick had given Shirley was for an
assistant position. It meant she had the same job and status as Emily. But Shirley didn't even meet the qualifications to join the company. In terms of education and internship experience, she was far behind. But she still got in because Patrick made it happen.

For Shirley, he broke company rules. Their relationship was as clear as the gossip among the female colleagues. But Shirley kept denying it. It was so childish and ridiculous.

Soon, Patrick came out. As his secretary, Emily followed him to the conference room for the meeting.

After the meeting. Emily was organizing the minutes when Shirley walked in with a box of macarons.

"Emily!"
###Chapter 2 You're Not Shirley

Emily spun around to see Shirley waving a pink box in the air.

"Hey, Emily! I brought you some desserts," Shirley announced, strolling in without even knocking. "This is the kind of treat we young folks love." She really laid it on thick with the "young" part.

Emily took a slow sip of her water. After more than a decade in the corporate grind, she could see right through Shirley's little games.

"Thanks, but I'm not really into sweets," Emily said,turning her down.

Shirley looked shocked. "Seriously? How anyone wouldn't enjoy sweets! Don't tell me you've never had macarons before? Oh, right, you grew up in Silvercrest. No wonder you haven't had anything this fancy."

Emily didn't want to get into it, but considering Shirley's connection with Patrick, she knew she had to tread carefully. Still, Shirley kept pushing her buttons.
With a faint smile, Emily said, "Oh, I've had my fair share of macarons. I just prefer to keep my taste buds sophisticated-unlike some people!"

Shirley was caught off guard by Emily's words and looked a bit embarrassed.

Seeing Shirley quiet down, Emily calmly said. "Why don't you focus on your work instead?"

She pulled out the printed task list submitted by the branch offices for the month.

"All the completion statuses are in the company's public email.Summarize them." Emily instructed.

There were both paper and electronic versions. All Shirley had to do was create a table and fill it in. It was the simplest task.

Shirley flipped through the papers and asked. "Emily.what do I do next?"

Emily sighed and explained it to her again. Seeing Shirley still looking confused. Emily decided to give up.

"Never mind. Here's Mr. Rivera's schedule for next week. Coordinate with the airline and hotel," Emily
said.

This was a task that required no thinking, just basic communication. If Shirley couldn't even handle this.then she was really useless.

What should have taken an hour dragged on until the afternoon, and Shirley still hadn't finished.

Frustrated, Emily went to find Shirley, only to see Patrick casually sitting in the office lobby in a tailored suit.

"Patrick, you got it done in just a few words. You're so amazing!" Shirley gushed.

Emily sighed. If every general manager handled all the travel arrangements themselves, the assistants would have it so easy. Knowing Patrick's usual strictness. Shirley would likely be scolded soon.

Before Emily, Patrick had fired several secretaries.She had carefully worked her way up from an administrative assistant to the general manager's assistant, knowing how tough it was.

Patrick said with a gentle smile, "It's okay, you're new to the company. It's normal not to be familiar
with these tasks yet. Ask Emily if you have questions.



Emily was shocked. She didn't know he could be so understanding. When she first started, she got scolded harshly for a minor mistake. This made her meticulous and thorough, earning her a reputation for professionalism.

"But Emily always ignores me. Today, I even brought her macarons, and she mocked me for not being able to afford high-end brands..." Shirley whined.


Emily found it both funny and annoying and lost interest in listening further.

Back in her office, Emily was about to dive intothe task completion reports when she saw a tall, familiar figure.

Patrick said coldly, "Why are you being so difficult about her?"


Immersed in her work, Emily was startled. Patrick had been in the lobby just moments ago. How did he get here so quickly? She looked up to see Patrick's stern face.
Emily quickly stood up and tried to keep her voice steady. "I'm not trying to be difficult; I justwant to ensure that we're all on the same page," she replied.

Patrick frowned, tapping his fingers lightly on the desk. That small gesture was enough for Emily to know he was pissed.

She had no choice but to think to herself, 'Fine, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.'

"I'm committed to helping her..." Emily tried to explain.

Patrick said nothing, just stared at her with those sharp eyes that seemed to see right through her.

"Emily, do you think I'm easy to brush off?" Patrick's voice was low and powerful, each word hitting Emily like a hammer.

Emily looked up and met Patrick's cold gaze. Her heart tightened, knowing her response had displeased him. She tried to stay calm and said, "Mr. Rivera, I've been following your instructions to take care of her,but..."

"What's wrong?" Patrick interrupted, his tone leaving
no room for argument.

"You seem dissatisfied with my arrangements!" he said coldly.

Emily's face changed slightly. She hadn't expected Patrick to be so blunt. She lowered her head,avoiding his gaze, feeling a mix of emotions.

What right did she have to be dissatisfied? As a secretary? A lover? Or...

Emily remained silent, clutching the hem of her shirt.

Patrick slowly walked toward her, exuding a powerful presence.

Emily instinctively stepped back. When they were just a foot apart, Patrick leaned in and said softly, "Emily,you don't hold a candle to Shirley in my opinion!"

Emily's heart sank, and she struggled to control her emotions.

"I know," she said with a bitter smile.

Patrick made no further move and turned to leave.He suddenly stopped and, in a commanding tone,said, "My sister's engagement party is tonight. Pick
out a gift and send it over."

"That doesn't seem appropriate," Emily replied,the thought of the engagement party making her nervous,knowing Patrick's mother would be there.

"Emily, remember your place!" Patrick emphasized her role as a secretary, making it clear she had no choice but to go.

Emily chose a limited edition CARTIER MARCELLO BAG. It had been reserved by a local tycoon, but after offending a subsidiary of the Gray Group, his funds were cut off, and the bag remained available.

When Emily arrived at the engagement party with the gift, many guests were already there. In the center of the room, a middle-aged woman in a luxurious silk dress, slightly plump, wearing anexpensive black pearl necklace, was chatting animatedly. It was Patrick's mother,Jennifer Rivera.

Emily hoped Jennifer wouldn't notice her so she could drop off the gift and leave. Because every time they met, Jennifer would harshly criticize her.

Emily anxiously looked for Patrick's sister, but turned and met Jennifer's gaze.
Jennifer glanced at her with disdain.

"People should know their place. Some women think they can marry into wealth just because they're pretty,without considering their background," Jennifer said to the wealthy ladies around her.

"Exactly. How could an ugly duckling become a swan? Girls like Karen, who are elegant and dignified,are rare."

Emily found it tiresome but knew it was inevitable.She stepped forward.

"Mrs. Rivera, hello. Mr. Rivera asked me to bring this engagement gift for Ms. Rivera..." Emily said.

Before Emily could finish, Karen Rivera approached.

"Oh, it's you! Since you're here, feel free to look around. Don't be nervous. You probably won't get many chances to visit such a high-end place," Karen said.


Emily didn't argue, just quiely handed over the limited edition bag.

Karen was stunned, saying, "Mom, this is the bag I told you about, the one I couldn't get!"
With the bag in hand, the atmosphere eased a bit.Just as Emily was about to leave, a familiar voice called out.

"Karen, we're here!"
###Chapter 3 Silvervale or Silverwood

Jennifer spun around, expecting to see Patrick, but instead, it was Shirley rushing over.

"Jennifer, it's been forever!" Shirley exclaimed,throwing herself into Jennifer's arms.

Jennifer grinned, "Shirley, it's been ages since you last visited. You look even more stunning."

"Jennifer, I brought a little something for you and Karen." Shirley handed over a cute bag with two boxes of homemade cookies. She said shyly, "I just started my job and haven't gotten my first paycheck yet. I made these cookies myself this morning.Hope you like them."

Jennifer quickly took the bag and handed it to Karen.who was standing nearby. "Shirley, that's so sweet of you. Karen and I love it. You must have put in a lot of effort. If only Patrick were half as thoughtful as you, I wouldn't worry so much. It's frustrating that he hardly ever comes to see me-just a handful of times each year."
Karen chimed in, "Mom, what are you talking about?Shirley's practically famnily already. Once she's officially in, you won't be able to get rid of Patrick even if you tried."

Jennifer held Shirley's hand, clearly fond of her.

"I'm glad you like it, Jennifer," Shirley turned her head and exclaimed, "Oh, Emily's here too! Jennifer,you have no idea how amazing Emily is."

Jennifer's expression changed at the mention of Emily.Amazing? In what way? Was it about attracting men or her skills in bed?

"Shirley, some people use sneaky tactics to get what they want. Don't admire such people too much."Jennifer turned away, her words pointed.

Shirley looked up with wide, innocent eyes, clinging to Jennifer's arm. "Jennifer, what are sneaky tactics?"

Jennifer replied, "Sneaky tactics are when someone who is clearly an ugly duckling tries to pass themselves off as a noble swan. You're still young.Shirley, so it's normal you don't understand. But in
the future, stay away from such people."

Emily,who had overheard the conversation, knew exactly what Jennifer meant. She had been planning to leave anyway. "Mrs. Rivera, there's an urgent matter at the office that I need to handle. I won't stay any longer."

Before leaving, she glanced in Patrick's direction, only to see him engrossed in conversation with other guests, completely oblivious to the situation.

Emily thought, 'How could I expect him to come to my rescue? Even if he did, he'd probably side with the seemingly innocent Shirley and put me down.'

Without lingering,Emily quickly left.

Back at the office, Emily had just sat down when her assistant, Betty Anderson, rushed over.

Betty said, "Emily, there's a problem."

Emily frowned as she said, "What is it?"

Betty was frantic. "Mr. Rivera's schedule for tomorrow is to go to Silverwood to sign a contract.
but the tickets we received are for Silvervale."

"The airline said a Ms. Wright from our company booked the tickets. Besides Shirley, who else here has the last name Wright? The tickets to Silverwood are sold out now. What should we do,Emily?"

Emily fell silent.

After a moment, she said, "Betty, contact a few travel agencies and see if they have any last-minute cancellations."

"At this hour? Who's going to cancel? Shirley is such a troublemaker!" Despite her complaints, Betty immediately called several travel agencies they frequently worked with.

"Emily, it's sorted!" Betty said happily after hanging up, "Luckily, one agency has a VIP tour to Silverwood tomorrow, and they just had two cancellations. They've coordinated with the airline,and we'll have the tickets by this afternoon."

Emily let out a sigh of relief.

"But Shirley needs to be held accountable for this.
Jennifer spun around, expecting to see Patrick, but instead, it was Shirley rushing over.


"Jennifer, it's been forever!" Shirley exclaimed, throwing herself into Jennifer's arms.


Jennifer grinned, "Shirley, it's been ages since you last visited. You look even more stunning."


"Jennifer, I brought a little something for you and Karen." Shirley handed over a cute bag with two boxes of homemade cookies. Shesaid shyly,"I just started my job and haven't gotten my first paycheck yet. I made these cookies myself this morning. Hope you like them."


Jennifer quickly took the bag and handed it to Karen, who was standing nearby. "Shirley, that's so sweet of you. Karen and I love it. You must have put in a lot of effort. If only Patrick were half as thoughtful as you,I wouldn't worry so much. It's frustrating that he hardly ever comes to see me-just a handful of times each year."


Karen chimed in. "Mom, what are you talking about? Shirley's practically family already. Once she's officially in, you won't be able to get rid of Patrick even if you tried."


Jennifer held Shirley's hand, clearly fond of her.

"I'm glad you like it, Jennifer," Shirley turned her head and exclaimed,′′Oh,Emily's here too! Jennifer, you have no idea how amazing Emily is."


Jennifer's expression changed at the mention of Emily. Amazing? In what way? Was it about attracting men or her skills in bed?
"Shirley, some people use sneaky tactics to get what they want. Don't admire such people too much." Jennifer turned away. her words pointed.


Shirley looked up with wide, innocent eyes, clinging to Jennifer's arm."Jennifer.what are sneaky tactics?"


Jennifer replied. "Sneaky tactics are when someone who is clearly an ugly duckling tries to pass themselves off as a noble swan. You're still young.Shirley. so it's normnal you don't understand. But in the future. stay away from such people."


Emily.who had overheard the conversation, knew exactly what Jennifer meant. She had been planning to leave anyway. "Mrs. Rivera, there's an urgent matter at the office that I need to handle. I won't stay any longer."


Before leaving, she glanced in Patrick's direction,only to see him engrossed in conversation with other guests, completely oblivious to the situation.


Emily thought, How could I expect himn to come to my rescue? Even if he did, he'd probably side with the seemingly innocent Shirley and put me down.


Without lingering, Emily quickly left.


Back at the office. Emily had just sat down when her assistant. Betty Anderson, rushed over.


Betty said. "Emily, there's a problem."

Emily frowned as she said. "What is it?"


Betty was frantic. "Mr. Rivera's schedule for tomorrow is to go to Silverwood to sign a contract, but the tickets we received are for Silvervale."
"The airline said a Ms. Wright from our company booked the tickets.Besides Shirley, who else here has the last name Wright? The tickets to Silverwood are sold out now. What should we do, Emily?"

"Emily, it's sorted!" Betty said happily after hanging up, "Luckily, one agency has a VIP tour to Silverwood tomorrow, and they just had two cancellations. They've coordinated with the airline, and we'll have the tickets by this afternoon."

Emily let out a sigh of relief.

"But Shirley needs to be held accountable for this. This was an important task, and she messed it up. If there hadn't been any cancellations,would Mr. Rivera have to take a train?" Betty said angrily.


Given Patrick's favoritism towards Shirley, he wouldn't even let her drive herself, let alone take a train. Emily shook her head helplessly.

"She's new and mistakes are inevitable. Teach her more," Emily said.

Seeing Emily's stance,Betty left the office, albeit reluctantly.

However,Emily didn't expect that by the afternoon, HR would bring Betty's termination papers for her to sign.
"Shirley was on her phone all afternoon. When Betty reminded her. she ran to Mr. Rivera's office to complain," HR said indignantly.


Emily sighed. "Alright. I understand. Leave the papers with me."


Betty had been with the company for six years. She was diligent and competent. Losing her would mean a long time to train a new assistant.especially considering Shirley...


Emily thought for a moment and went to Patrick's office. Before she entered, she heard Shirley's soft voice.


"Patrick, it's my fault. I didn't do my job well and caused you trouble."

"No problem. It's already resolved," Patrick's voice was calm.

Shirley, still crying, tried to snuggle into Patrick's arms.

Emily shook her head, realizing Betty's fate was sealed. After all. to Patrick,an assistant was insignificant.


"What are you doing here?" Patrick's cold voice addressed Emily standing at the door.


Shirley glanced back at Emily and feigned distress. "Emily isn't here to complain about me, is she, Patrick?"


"What could she possibly complain about?" Patrick gestured for Emily to leave.


Emily walked away, feeling helpless. What right did she have to say anything?


Instead of returning to her office, she went to the break room, still unsure how to face Betty.
"What were you going to say?" Patrick asked coldly.

Emily turned back. meeting Patrick's gaze.

"Can you give Betty another chance?" Emily asked. deciding to speak up.

"There's no need." Patrick replied firmly.


"But she's part of my teamn!" Emily said. biting her lip. She felt guilty about Betty, who had done nothing wrong but was being unfairly treated.


"Do I need to report my decisions to you?" Patrick stared at her and said."Know your place."


Emily had worked tirelessly for the company and supported Patrick's decisions without complaint. But now, because of Shirley's words, Patrick was firing her assistant without considering her feelings.


Emily grew angrier and turned away from him.

For years, she had been loyal to the company and Patrick. Didn't he care about her at all?


Seeing Emily get upset with him over an assistant made Patrick even more furious.


Patrick said coldly. "Don't challenge me."

The more she wanted to escape, the closer he wanted to get.

He continued,"My decisions are for you to accept, nothing more."
###Chapter 4 Reaction or Not

Emily went quiet. and the break room got super awkward.


She knew there was no way she could change Patrick's mind. Sticking around would just make things worse for her.


Emily was about to leave. but Patrick stopped her.


She felt this tightness in her chest. a weird mix of emotions. Was it disappointment? Helplessness? Or something else?


Either way, she didn't want to stay a second longer.

Emily said firmly. "Mr. Rivera.let go of me."

She looked Patrick straight in the eye, trying to keep her cool. Patrick hesitated.then let her go.


Emily rushed back to her office and slammed the door. Her emotions were all over the place.


Just then, her phone buzzed.


It was a text from Betty: [Emily, don't worry about me. My mom called a few days ago, asking me to come back to our hometown. I've caused you enough trouble lately. Thank you.]


She didn't deserve this, but she was getting the short end of the stick.


Emily rubbed her temples, feeling a headache coming on. After a moment.she picked up her phone and called a business partner she trusted.


"Hey. Mr. Brooks, is your company hiring right now?" Emily asked.
Kade Brooks replied. "Oh. Emily, it's rare for you to call. But you know.my company is currently dealing with layoffs."

"Alright. I won't bother you then." Emily said and hung up.


Kade didn't waste any time and immediately called Marlon Hughes from the Hughes Group. trying to curry favor.


"Mr. Hughes, the Ms. Thompson you asked me to look after seems to be in some trouble lately." Kade said.


Meanwhile. Emily was nervously flipping her phone back and forth.

"What are you doing?" a cold voice came from behind her. It was Patrick.

Emily jumped. almost dropping her phone.

"Why is the door closed during work hours?" Patrick asked coldly.


Emily felt a pang of guilt.


Patrick pretended not to notice the panic in her eyes and instead focused on the necklace she was wearing. The delicate swan pendant highlighted her long, fair neck and collarbone, giving her a unique charm.


Seeing Emily not respond, Patrick stepped closer.

"What, cat got your tongue?" he asked.

Emily snapped back and casually said. "The room is cold."

Her offhand answer made Patrick stop. He then closed the door.


"Emily might get implicated because of what happened this morning. Poor thing. Who knows what Shirley's relationship with Mr. Rivera is. to make
him favor her so much?"

"Keep your voice down. Mr. Rivera is probably still angry. We should stay out of his way to avoid getting caught in the crossfire."


"Exactly."

The other colleagues outside the office quickly scattered.


Patrick frowned, looking at Emily's coat on the office chair. How could she be cold and still take off her coat?


"Are you playing me?" Patrick looked down at her. his presence overwhelming.

Emily replied. "I wouldn't dare."

Patrick grabbed her chin, forcing her to look at him.

"What wouldn't you dare to do!"


Patrick cornered Emily against the wall, lifting her waist, leaving almost no space between them.


Emily's heart raced. She felt the intense pressure from Patrick. She tried to struggle.but his grip was too strong, making it impossible to move.

"Still cold?" Patrick asked with a mocking tone.


"No..." Emily started to say, but Patrick's lips crashed onto hers with a force that left her breathless. Her struggles were useless against his dominant kiss, and she found herself surrendering to him.


The kiss was so sudden and intense that Emily almost forgot to breathe. It felt both familiar and passionate. Her lips parted slightly, quickly melding
with Patrick's. She could feel the warmth and firmness of his body. and without thinking. she wrapped her arms around his neck. wanting to respond.


Patrick always had a way of controlling Emmily. both her soul and her body.She hated herself for being so weak. always determined to keep her distance,only to crumble whenever he was near.


When Patrick saw Emily's dazed and confused expression, he couldn't help but smile. Then, he abruptly pulled away.


"Dinner with a client tonight. I'll have someone bring you a dress." Patrick said, his voice devoid of emotion.


Jerk!' Emily cursed him silently.gritting her teeth.

He was always so domineering. After he left. Emily slumped weakly into her chair.


Soon,Patrick's driver delivered a delicate gift box containing a burgundy slip dress.


Emily was a bit surprised. Usually, when dining with clients. Patrick insisted she wear a suit, saying they needed to look professional.

Emily shook her head1. Well, she had no right to refuse.


She put the slip dress back in the gift box and tossed it into the drawer under her desk. Before she could close the drawer. Shirley quietly walked in.


"Emily, what are you doing?" Shirley asked.

Emily was startled, suppressing her disgust for Shirley's fake demeanor.
and replied. "Nothing."

Shirley said. "Emily. I thought about it after last time. You must have found the macarons too sweet. right? This time I brought you a mango dessert, made with pure animal cream. I made it myself. try it."


Mango? That would be deadly. Emily. who had been allergic to mangoes since childhood, refused without a second thought.


"No. thanks. You can have it..."


Before she could finish. she saw Patrick slowly walking in behind Shirley.

"Shirley made it especially for you." Patrick said.

Emily looked up at Patrick's cold. expressionless face.

She held a glimmer of hope. After all. they had shared a bed for so long.He should know aboout her mango allergy, but Patrick's words made it clear he wanted her to accept it.


"Thank you," Emily reluctantly took the cake.


Shirley said. "Patrick, it seems Emily still won't forgive me. She must think I forced Betty to leave. She might throw the cake away as soon as we leave.
"


Shirley must have some kind of delusional disorder.' Emily thought helplessly.


Seeing Emily not taking any further action. Shirley opened the cake box and handed it to her, looking pitiful.


Emily was stunned. With such an innocent and pure look. no wonder she could easily win Patrick over. What man could resist that?
Patrick stared at her, as if she was being ungrateful. If she didn't eat it.she would be the villain.


"Fine." Allergic reaction or not. she didn't care anymore.

Emily took the cake box. scooped a bite, and ate it. It didn't take long for an itchy sensation to spread across her back.
###Chapter 5 What a Hypocrite!

As the night settled in and the city lights flickered to life. Emily pulled up to the swanky Nightfall Club.


Her smooth skin glowed against the deep red of her dress. Even though she had taken an antihistamine earlier, the red marks on her skin were slowly fading, but the itchiness was still there.


Emily parked her car. grabbed her black leather clutch. and headed towards the club.


The red dress was a masterpiece. hugging her curves just right and turning heads as she walked. The deep V-neckline showved off her delicate collarbones and alluring figure. oozíng undeniable sensuality. The hem of the dress clung to her shapely hips. and with every step. she exuded a captivating charm.


"Hey.Emily!"


Emily turned to see Marlon Hughes leaning casually against the door of a private room.


Marlon, an openly gay heir to the Hughes Group. had short, light brown hair that radiated youthful energy and a rebellious spirit. His deep. bright eyes seemed to see right through people but held a gentle acceptance of the world. His sharp, well-defined nose added to his handsome features.


Emily said, "Hey, Marlon. What a surprise."

Marlon replied. "Not really. I was waiting for you."

Emily asked, "Waiting for me?"
Marlon said. "Yeah. Kade told the you've been having some trouble lately."

Emily was a bit takem aback.


Emily said. "Yeah, a colleague of mine had to leave the company for personal reasons. but she's great and really capable."


Marlon said. So. you want to help her find a job?"

"Yes." Emily said softly.

Marlon said. "That's no big deal. We're hiring. Have her come to the Hughes Group tomorrow morning."


"Thank you so much!"

Emily let out a sigh of relief. Betty's problem was finally solved. and a happy smile spread across her face. as bright and warm as a spring blossom.


Marlon was momentarily stunned. In his memory. Emily was always serious, dressed in business suits. and he had never seen her in a dress, let alone smiling. But now. she was not only smiling but also wearing such a sexy dress.


Emily felt a bit embarrassed under Marlon's gaze and tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, a gesture that only captivated Marlon further.


Marlon said. "Emily, the Hughes Group would welcome you anytime. with double the salary."


"You're too kind..."


Emily was about to say more when she saw Patrick approaching with a stern expression.
"Emily.do you have any sense of time?


Emily reached for het phone to check the time. She remembered leaving two hours early, and the drive from her apartment to here was about an hour. How could she be late? Besides. traffic wasn't bad today.


"Get moving. Do you expect the client to wait for you?" Patrick's tone was harsh and commanding.


Marlon said. "Patrick, you really don't know how to be smooth.do you?No wonder you're still single."


Marlon casually dIraped an arm over Patrick's shoulder. but Patrick brushed his hand off with disdain.


"We're not that close. you know." Patrick shot Marlon a cold look.


Marlon said. "Watch your mouth, or I'll spill all your dirty secrets from your time abroad."


Patrick glared at Marlon, who immediately fell silent.

"Patrick, why aren't you coming in?"

Shirley ran over, clinging to Patrick's arm. her face almost touching his.

"Oh,it's you. Marlon."


Marlon looked at Shirley with disdain, saying. "Let's not get too familiar.okay?"


Marlon rolled his eyes and instinctively moved closer to Emily.

Shirley didn't seem to mind, continuing to cling to Patrick and act coy.but she noticed Marlon's gaze was fixed on Emily. Her expression changed.
but she quickly smiled at Emily.

Shirley said."Emily,why are you so late? Patrick and I have been waiting for you."


She added. "Patrick, don't be too hard on Emily. She's juggling a lot of work right now. I have a lot on my plate too, but I always make time for you when it comes to meeting clients. It's just a shame she can't do the same."


Emily remained silent.

"I can't take it anymore. I haven't even had a drink, and I feel like throwing up. There must be something dirty around! Patrick, I need your assistant." Marlon signaled to Emily to help him to the restroom.

Emily was about to go when she saw Patrick's murderous look.

Patrick said. "Go throw up on your own."

Patrick turned and walked towards the private room, then looked back to see Emily still standing there.

"Get moving," his tone was commanding.

Emily sighed and gave Marlon an apologetic look.

At the door of the private room, Shirley didn't rush in.

Shirley asked, "Emily,why are you dressed so sexy today?"

What could Emily say? That Patrick forced her to wear it?

Patrick said, "Get in here!"
As soon as they sat down, the client arrived.

"I've heard Mr. Rivera is always surrounded by beautiful women. Seeing it today.it's true."


Shirley clenched her fists in jealousy as the client's lecherous eyes roamed over Emily's barely concealed chest.

"Let's toast to our future cooperation!"

The client, a balding man in his forties with a face full of fat, raised his glass.


Patrick downed his drink, but the client didn't sit down.

"They say Emily is a rare beauty. Seeing her today, it's true. May I have the honor of a drink with you?"

The bald man leered at Emily.

Shirley said. "Emily istruly a star employee at our company. And her drinking capacity? I doubt anyone can match that!"

"Is that so?" The bald man left his seat and moved closer to Emily.


Emily was in a difficult position. The company valued this deal highly,or Patrick wouldn't be here in person.


"Absolutely, I'd be delighted."

Before Patrick could speak, Emily downed her drink.

After several rounds, she was feeling tipsy.

The bald man sat next to Emily, trying to grope her, but Patrick blocked
him.

The bald man, seemingly drunk, said. "You wore this to get into my bed.didn't you?"


Shirley said. "How can you say that about Emily? She's our top secretary."


If it weren't for the allergy and the alcohol making her weak and itchy.Emily would have slapped him.


The bald man sneered. "What a hypocrite! You act all virtuous. but you're just a whore!"


Emily couldn't take it anymore and was about to slap him when she heard a familiar. magnetic voice.


Patrick said. "That's right.”


So, this was how Patrick saw her all along. Emily's vision went black, and she lost her strength.


"But no matter what. she's my problem to deal with." Patrick said.

Unfortunately. Emily didn't hear the last part as she fainted.
###Chapter 6 Emily Belongs to Me

Patrick scooped up the unconscious Emily and sped off to the hospital in his car.


Shirley stood alone at the club entrance, muttering curses under her breath about Emily.


Just then. Marlon walked out of the club.

"Why are you here alone? Where's Patrick?" Marlon asked.

"He took Emily to the hospital." Shirley whispered.

Marlon was shocked."What?"

Shirley's eyes darted around. "Emily suddenly fainted. I asked Patrick to take her to the hospital. Marlon. I couldn't get a cab. Can you take me there? I'm really worried."


Marlon could see through Shirley's intentions but was genuinely concerned about Emily.

"Get in the car." Marlon said.

In the hospital corridor. Patrick paced back and forth anxiously,glancing into the emergency room every now and then.


His heart was filled with worry and unease. He was worried something might happen to Emily.


Patrick thought, 'Alright, you win. Just wake up, and you can wear whatever you want! You can even keep that stupid bracelet!'

Soon, Emily was wheeled out of the emergency room.
"How is she?" Patrick asked anxiously.

The doctor looked up at him. "The patient has a severe allergy history.How could you not know that? Her condition is stable for now, but she needs to be observed in the hospital for two days. Go handle the admission paperwork."

"Okay." Patrick's worry finally eased a bit. He looked at Emily lying on the gurney,filled with tenderness and concern.


As Patrick went to handle the paperwork. Shirley and Marlon arrived at the hospital. After some inquiries, they found Emily's room.

"Emily. wake up," Shirley said, shaking Emily and pretending to cry.

Seeing that Emily didn't wake up, Shirley continued, "I told you not to drink so much. but you insisted it was how you closed deals. And I told you not to wear that dress. but you did anyway, afraid I'd outshine you."

"Wow, someone's really trying to make friends! But why does she need to negotiate contracts? What are the salespeople for?" Marlon interrupted Shirley's monologue with a glare.


"Marlon,you might not understand our company. You stay with Emily;I need to use the restroom," Shirley said.


Marlon didn't respond to Shirley, just looked at Emily with immense gentleness.

Shirley left the room, her heart filled with jealousy and resentment.

She thought, 'Emily, you're just lucky; it won't last. Just wait!'

Shirley didn't go to the restroom but paced around the hallway.
Patrick had just finished the paperwork and ran into Shirley outside the room.


"Patrick, let's not go in just yet." Shirley said.

"Why?" Patrick asked in confusion.


"Emily was mumbling Marlon's name in her sleep. Marlon went in to calm her down. and she fell asleep." Shirley said.

"Marlon?" Patrick said.


"Yeah, Marlon said Emily had asked him out today. No wonder she dressed so sexy. Patrick, listen to me..." Shirley started.


Before Shirley could finish, Patrick stormed into the room, seething with anger.He grabbed Marlon by the collar.

"Come with me," Patrick said in a low voice.


Marlon glanced at Emily on the bed, reluctantly following Patrick into the hallway.


"I don't care what your intentions are. Stay away! Emily belongs to mne."Patrick growled, his tone menacing.


"I really like her!" Marlon shot back.


Patrick patted Marlon's shoulder, his grip firm.′′Iyou don't want the Hughes Group to fall apart, keep your feelings to yourself!"

"Why? Do you like her too? You've been hiding it well," Marlon said.


"Who said I like her? My business is none of your concern," Patrick retorted.
Patrick's phone rang, interrupting the tense moment.

"Yes. Donna. I'll be right there."


Patrick glared at Marlon before turning and walking towards the hospital exit.


"If you don't like her, why not let me have a chance?" Marlon called after him.


At that moment. Shirley answered her phone.


Jennifer's voice came through, "Shirley, don't worry. I've arranged for Donna to call Patrick. He'll be back soon."

"Thank you, Jennifer. Whether Patrick likes me or not. I just want him to be happy," Shirley said.


Shirley's phone displayed a photo she had just sent to Jennifer,showing Marlon by Emily's bedside.


"Emily has a lot of rumors at the company. I didn't believe them at first.buat..." Shirley said.


"Shirley, you don't need to say more. I know. Emily is clearly after our family's status and money. I won't allow it!" Jennifer's voice was filled with anger.


"I didn't believe Emily was so promiscuous at first, but I've seen her flirting with many men!" Shirley added.


Jennifer's voice trembled with rage as she tried to calm down.

"Shirley,Patrick has always had feelings for you..." Jennifer said.
"Jennifer, please don't say that. Patrick and I grew up together. I trust him!But now, with her around..." Shirley said.


"Don't worry, Shirley. I won't let that bitch succeed!" Jennifer said.


Seeing her plan succeed. Shirley agreed with Jennifer and hung up the phone.


Emily woke up, the smell of disinfectant filling the air.


She remembered fainting at the club. Who brought her to the hospital? She recognized that familiar scent of sandalwood and cedar. It could only be him.


That jerk. One moment he called her a slut, the next he was by her side.


Emily wasn't planning to forgive Patrick easily this time. Unless he begged her,she'd rather quit than forgive him.


But if she had quit, what would have happened to her brother in the special school and her mom working in the restaurant?

Emily turned her head, letting a tear fall from her eye.

Just then, a large hand held hers.

"Emily,you're awake?"


Emily quickly pulled her hand back, looking in disbelief at Marlon sitting by her bed.


"Emily, you're finally awake. You don't know how worried Marlon was.He stayed by your side the whole time you were unconscious. I'm so jealous," Shirley said.
"Mr. Hughes, did you bring me to the hospital?" Emily asked. confused.

Marlon didn't speak, just looked at Emily with a doting smile.

Emily looked up at Shirley. "Where's Mr. Rivera?"


Shirley lied. "Patrick has been busy with the partnership. After all. you fainted in front of the partners..."

Emily thought. 'Patrick, you really are a heartless man!'
###Chapter 7 You Can't Leave Without My Per mission!

After a day in the hospital. Emily was back at work the next day like nothing happened.


But the moment she walked into the office, she knew something was up.


"Did you hear? We landed that contract two days ago. Not only did they sign. but they even dropped their price by 5%."

"Isn't that partner a total creep? He's sexually harassed so many people and is super stingy. How did this go down?"

Her coworkers were huddled together, whispering.

"Well, it's Emily who closed the deal this time. You should know that there's no client Emily can't handle!" Shirley said, pretending to praise Emily.

"Wow, Emily's really something."

"Yeah, I heard the client is bald and overweight. How did Emily manage?"


"You guys don't know, do you? They say men with a lot of fat on their faces are surprisingly good in bed. Maybe it was even enjoyable for her."

The others shook their heads in disbelief.
Emily cleared her throat, pretending not to hear, and walked straight into her office.


What on earth happened? Emily remembered the last meeting ended badly,with the deal in jeopardy. How did they end up lowering their price?


As long as the job got done. Her reputation had been tarnished long ago when she agreed to be Patrick's secret lover to pay off debts and cover her brother's medical bills.


While Emily didn't care about the gossip, some people did. Jennifer had arrived at the office early but didn't rush upstairs. She waited until Emily entered the building before following her in. She had planned to talk to Emily directly but overheard the other employees'conversation.


Furious, Jennifer stormed into Emily's office and threw a card at her face.


Jennifer said angrily, "I thought you were interested in Patrick and that's why you clung to him. But I overestimated you. You're justa shameless slut who'll sleep with anyone!"

Emily bit her lip, trying to keep her cool. She picked up the card and handed it back to Jennifer.


Jennifer sneered, "Keep it. There's five million dollars on it. I was going to pay you to leave my son, but now I've changed my mind.Without the PIN, it's just a useless piece of plastic."

Emily smiled and snapped the card in half.
Emily said, "If it's useless. let's make it completely worthless."

"You're crazy!" Jennifer stared at Emily in disbelief.


Emily said. "Since I'm being fired without cause. please inform HR to pay me ten months'severance."


With that. Emily finally exhaled. Yes. with Shirley back. it was time for her to leave.


Emily turned to pack her things

"Leaving? You think you can just walk away without my permission?"

Patrick grabbed Emily's arm tightly.

"You can't leave without my permission!"

His words stunned Emily. Jennifer, and Shirley, who was standing at the door.


When Patrick was young, his father had racked up huge debts and ran off with another woman, leaving Jennifer to raise him and Karen alone. Patrick had never defied Jennifer since then.


Shirley stood at the door, seething with anger, glaring at Emily.

Jennifer's eyes filled with tears, ready to spill over.

Jennifer said, "Emily, you made this mess. If youI leave,who's going to clean it up? Don't think you can dump it on us!"

Emily was about to be moved, but it was laughable.
"Yeah, rather than letting me go, it's more satisfying to keep me here.humiliated and criticized. Patrick, just let it go already!" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.


Shirley. who had been eavesdropping, strutted in with a smug look on her face.


"Jennifer, you were worried for nothing. Patrick's just worried it might be too tiring for me." Shirley said. her tone dripping with fake concern.


"That's good. But that Emily has no dignity!" Jennifer added. her words cutting deep.


Emily clenched her fists. "Sorry, but I'm resigning now!" she declared.grabbing her shoulder bag and heading for the door. But Patrick blocked her way.

Suddenly. her phone rang. "Emily, something's happened at your house!" It was her neighbor Carol. Carol never called unless it was urgent...


Emily dlidn't dare think too much and struggled to get past Patrick,but he held the door firmly.

Patrick yelped as Emily bit his hand, causing him to let go.

"Emily, how dare you?" Shirley, abandoning her ladylike demeanor,rushed to check on Patrick's hand.

Patrick frowned. "Mom, go back. I have some things to handle."
With that, he chased after Emily without looking back.

"Emily,you just wait!" Shirley spat venomously.

Jennifer watched the scene unfold, stunned.

"Damn it!" Jennifer muttered and left.


Emily rushed to her neighborhood, a rundown apartment complex from the last century. with no elevator and mostly elderly residents.


The stairwell lights flickered, and the narrow steps were plastered with various ads.


Before she even reached her door, she heard her mother, Lisa Thompson, begging for mercy.

Carol saw Emily and signaled her to stay back.


Emily grabbed a shovel from a nearby coal pile and cautiously approached.


Before she entered, she heard the sound of a slap, followed by a scream.


Emily burst through the door to find Lisa collapsed on the floor.


The room was filled with thugs, led by a bald man in his thirties, his arms covered in tattoos.


Emily shielded Lisa, saying, "You're trespassing, and I can have you arrested."
"That's funny. What about your mom's unpaid debts? Go ahead, call the cops! Don't think I don't know what your mom did with the money!"


Emily glanced at Lisa. To pay for her brother's treatment, Lisa had worked in a bar and picked up a drug habit.

Seeing Lisa's evasive eyes, Emily understood.

"Why so quiet?" The thug leader taunted, stepping closer.

Emily pointed the shovel at him. "Stay back. How much does she owe? I'll pay."

The leader snatched the shovel away. "You'll pay? 550 thousand dollars. How do you plan to do that? Or, let us have some fun with you for a night, and I'll give you a discount."

Lisa pleaded, "Please, don't touch my daughter!"

"Get lost, old woman!" The leader signaled his men to kick Lisa aside.

He advanced on Emily, who retreated until she was cornered by the sewing machine.

The leader ogled her chest, reaching out with a fat hand.

"Fine, this counts as seIf-defense!" Emily secretly grabbed the scissors from the sewing machine, gripping them tightly, eyes fixed on the leader's hand.

Emily braced herself for the worst.
###Chapter 8 Kept?

Emily's heart pounded as the gang leader's hand inched closer to her chest, her grip tightening around the scissors she held.

Just when it seemed like there was no way out, a cold,commanding voice cut through the tension.

"If you lay a finger on her, you'll regret it."

"Who the hell are you?"

The gang leader spun around, locking eyes with Patrick's deadly glare.


The Rivera Group was a name everyone knew, especially with Patrick's face plastered all over town from his interviews.


"Well, Mr. Rivera. Heard a lot about you1. Gotta say, you're even more impressive in person than on TV."

Patrick's face twisted in disgust as he yanked Emily to his side.

"What do you think you're doing? Back off!" Patrick said coldly.

"No, it's a misunderstanding. Her mother owes us $5.5 million and hasn't paid a dime. I'm just here to collect. If I'd known she was yours..."


Patrick cut him off, "Debts need to be paid, but there's a proper way to handle things."

The gang leader's eyes lit up, relieved he hadn't messed with Patrick's
woman.

Patrick said. "But she's mine now. If you don't want to die.leave.Come to the Rivera Group tomorrow for the money."

The gang leader, drenched in cold sweat. quickly signaled his men to retreat.


The Rivera Group had its hands in both legal and illegal dealings.

"Ill be waiting in the car downstairs. Don't keep me waiting."

Patrick left. leaving Lisa in shock, tears streaming down her face.She had thought Emily had a good job. not realizing she was in debt and had been sold off.


"Emily, tell me, what's your relationship with Mr. Rivera?" Lisa asked.her voice trembling.

Emily looked down, silent.

Lisa had a sinking feeling, "It's all my fault! I failed as a mom!" She covered her mouth, choking back sobs.


Emily looked at the wounds on Lisa's face. wanting to wipe away the blood.


How did Lisa owe so much money? They had just paid off the last debt last month.


Emily felt a wave of unease.

"Mom, tell me, you didn't start using drugs again, did you?"
Emily gripped Lisa's arm, but Lisa avoided her gaze, remaining silent.

"Let's go to rehab!"

"No. I can't go. I can't handle it, Emily. You care about me,right?And what about your brother?"


Lisa saw Emily wasn't budging. She pushed Emily out the door with all her might.
′′Iwant nothing to do with you anymore. You can pretend I don't exist."


The door slammed shut,leaving Emily outside.

No matter how much she knocked, Lisa wouldn't open the door.

"Emily, maybe you should go. I'll talk to your mom," Carol,who had been helping the family for years, suggested.

Emily left, feeling lost. She didn't remember how she got into Patrick's car or how they got back to his apartment.


"Why did you do that?" Emily stood at the door, furious, glaring at Patrick. "Why did you humiliate me in front of my mom?"


Patrick hadn't thought much at the time; he just wanted to resolve the situation quickly.


"Who said you could leave? Did you get my permission? If you choose to ignore me, don't say I didn't warn you."

"I..." Emily wanted to argue but realized she couldn't. Given the
circumstances, how could she quit? She had to send Lisa to rehab and cover her brother's special school fees.


Exhausted, Emily didn't say anything more and walked into the bathroom.


Thinking about everything that had happened, she felt dirty and scrubbed her body vigorously.

When she came out, Patrick was waiting in the bedroom.

"Put this on," he said, pointing to a dress on the bed.

Emily hesitated but put on the dress, realizing it was the burgundy gown she had worn before.

How did it get here?

She looked up, only to find herself face-to-face with Patrick's muscular chest.


Patrick didn't give her much time to react. His eyes filled with an intense, indescribable desire.


His breath was warm and familiar, making Emily's heart race.

Then, his passionate kisses rained down on her, melting away her doubts and fears.


At first, Emily resisted, but soon she was lost in the sweetness and passion, her arms wrapping around Patrick's neck, responding to his kisses.
His hands roamed her body, exploring every curve. until they reached the depths of her being.


Their bodies pressed tightly together. like magnets drawn to each other,inseparable.


Their heartbeats echoed in each other's ears. their breaths quickening.the air thick with heat and anticipation.


Patrick's head dipped. his lips trailing from her chin to her collarbone.her breasts. her stomach, moving lower, warm and lingering.

Emily gasped uncontrollably.

Patrick smiled, savoring the moment. as Emily's leg wrapped around his waist. Feeling the warmth of her embrace, he gently lifted her legs onto his shoulders. diving deeper into their shared passion. He moved rhythmically, exploring the lush terrain, their breaths intertwining and growing heavier with each gentle thrust.

Patrick picked up the pace, wanting Emily to feel the power of his thrusts. As their movements grew more intense,they reached a climax.Patrick slowly releasing Emily.


Emily panted, her face flushed, the red dress discarded on the floor.She didn't know how long it had lasted, but she felt a long-lost joy,quickly replaced by shame.


"Here," Patrick tossed a card at her, "The password is your employee number."

"Be at work on time tomorrow!"
Patrick pulled up his pants and left coldly.

Emily stared at the ceiling, feeling helpless.

Emily thought. 'Am I just a passing thought, or do I mean something more to you?
###Chapter 9 Can't Wait

The next day, Emily threw on her work clothes and headed to the office right on time, only to find her desk completely empty.


"Hey. Emily, I already packed up your stuff and put it in the storage room. Patrick wanted to toss it, but I convinced him to let me keep it for you." Shirley said, batting her seemingly innocent eyes.

Shirley's tricks might work on Patrick, but they had no effect on Emily. She didn't want to get into it with her at the moment.

Emily said calmly,"Okay,thanks."

Emily looked up. revealing the red marks on her collarbone from the previous day's intense encounter.

Shirley recalled how Patrick had rushed off yesterday. Could it be?She trembled with anger.


"Emily, Mr. Rivera asked me to let you know that starting today, you've been reassigned to the Canyon Ridge project team," HR said as they approached Emily, "YouI'll probably be there for a while."

"Alright."

Canyon Ridge was remote, with only about a dozen people in the so-called project team. It was said that the area was swarming with mosquitoes in the summer, and the office was just a few small prefab buildings. Generally, the only contact with the main office was during the end-of-month payroll. Even the janitors avoided the place.
"Patrick is trying to force you out in a different way. Do you still think you have what it takes and the charm?" Shirley's mood improved instantly.


Emily was also pleased. Her brother was currently at a special needs school in Canyon Ridge, and the project site was only a ten-minute drive from the school. Besides, staying at the main office would only make her the subject of gossip.

Emily completed her handover, took her things from the storage room, neatly packed them into a box, and left the company.

The two-hour drive to Canyon Ridge made Emily feel inexplicably irritable. When she arrived, she didn't go straight to the project team but headed to the special needs school.


The so-called school was more like a children's rehabilitation center.The sun was warm, and Emily walked into the school with a light step.


In the classroom, Emily immediately spotted her brother Gordon Thompson sitting in the corner. She quietly walked over to him.Gordon glanced up at her, then continued drawing, as if the world consisted only of him and his pencil.


Emily smiled helplessly. She understood Gordon's condition.Although he couldn't communicate like other kids, seeing him healthy and safe filled her with happiness.


She sat beside him, quietly accompanying him, enjoying the rare peace and closeness.
Just then, a familiar figure appeared in the classroom.

"Emily, what are you doing here?"

"Mr. Hughes?" Emily was surprised. Marlon was known as a playboy.yet here he was at a special needs school. It was unexpected.


Marlon explained. "I was just reassigned to take over the Canyon Ridge project. What about you?"

Emily said, "I'm volunteering here."

Marlon noticed the little boy next to Emily.

Marlon asked. "Gordon, is that an aircraft carrier you're drawing?"

Gordon nodded. "Yes."

Emily was shocked. No matter how hard she tried. Gordon never responded to her. She had even thought he might be mute rather than autistic.


"Every autistic child is like a star in the night sky. They have their own unique universe," Marlon said, sharing his insights aboutautistic children.


"They're curious about the world and want to interact,but they're afraid of rejection and misunderstanding. This conflict makes them feel lonely and helpless, trapping them in their ideal corner," Marlon continued.


Emily said, "I've never heard it explained that way before."
Marlon smiled. "If you're interested. Ms. Thompson, how about we grab a bite and chat more?"


Emily shook her head, "No, thanks. I need to head to the Canyon Ridge project team."

Marlon grinned. "Perfect timing. Wait a bit, and I'll give you a ride."

Emily replied, "No need, I drove."

Marlon insisted, "Ms. Thompson, you promised to treat me to a meal last time. You can't back out! Plus, I know a great place near the project site."

Marlon looked at Emily with innocent, hopeful eyes

Emily sighed, "Alright, I'll wait here."

Seeing Emily agree, Marlon's face lit up with a childlike smile, his eyes twinkling mischievously.


Meanwhile, Patrick sat in his office, deep in thought, before finally calling the Canyon Ridge project team.

"Emily hasn't arrived yet?" Patrick asked.


It was already afternoon, and the drive from the company to Canyon Ridge was only two and a half hours. Why wasn't she there yet?

Patrick paced his office anxiously.

"Shirley, cancel tonight's party!" Patrick ordered.
Shirley said in confusion. "But Patrick, there will be many industry leaders at the party. Is something urgent?"

Patrick replied. "Yes, I need to go somewhere important."

Shirley asked, "Can Icome with you?"

Shirley clung to Patrick, and he reluctantly agreed to take her along.


Patrick drove fast, his mind racing with countless worst-case scenarios.each one making his heart pound harder.


As they neared the project site, Patrick spotted Emily at a pasta restaurant by the road.

He slammed on the brakes, ignoring Shirley's protests, and walked straight to Emily. She was discussing autistic children with Marlon,occasionally smiling in a way Patrick had never seen before.


"Emily, it seems like you're really eager to see him, huh?" Patrick stood before her, seething with anger.

Emily looked up, surprised and slightly pleased to see him.

Shirley hurried over and clung to Patrick's arm.

"So this is the important place you mentioned," Shirley said,smirking.


"Emily, shouldn't you be at the project team? What are you doing here with Marlon? Are you two hiding something from us?" Shirley sneered at Emily and Marlon.

Patrick shouted, "Emily, you're really pushing my buttons!"
He stormed off, dragging Shirley to the car. He sped off.leaving Shirley bewildered.


Suddenly. Patrick slammed on the brakes. "Shirley, you can go back on your own."

Shirley was left standing alone, stunned.
###Chapter 10 Wake Up

When Patrick came back looking like he had a storm cloud over his head, the restaurant was already deserted; Marlon and Emily were nowhere in sight. He'd been brooding in his car all night.

Patrick said. "Marlon, we need to talk."

Marlon nodded. "Sure thing. Mr. Rivera. It's not every day you call me."


Patrick hung up and glanced at the empty restaurant. He hadn't budged since he got back yesterday.


Meanwhile. Emily was getting the hang of her new job. It was mostly small tasks and errands, which she handled with ease.


Shirley had also joined the project team. She was still fuming about yesterday, blaming Emily for her being stuck in this remote place.

Shirley thought, 'Emily, just wait. I've got a big surprise for you!

Shirley eyed the project-issued water bottle on Emily's desk and got an idea.


Shirley asked, "Xyla, could you grab me some water?"

In the small office, there were six workstations, each with just a desk and a chair. Besides Xyla, who was in her forties and sitting opposite Emily,everyone else had left.

While Xyla went to get water, Shirley took out a vial of colorless,odorless liquid from her bag and poured it into Emily's water bottle.
Shirley thought. Im going to share this with Patrick, but you'll get it first.


Soon, Xyla returned with a ceramic cup.

Xyla said. "Ms. Wright, here's your water."

Shirley took the cup happily but didn't drink it right away. She placed it on the desk to cool.


Shirley said. "Xyla. you should keep an eye on Emily. After everything she's been through, it's understandable that she might be struggling."

"What happened?" Xyla asked. intrigued.

Shirley said. "You might not know, but Emily was hospitalized recently. She sacrificed a lot to secure a client..."


"Did she contract an STD?" Although the project team was in a remote area, there were still rumors about Emily.

"Xyla, let's not jump to conclusions." Shirley feigned innocence.

Xyla was engrossed in the gossip when Emily returned.

Emily was surprised to see Shirley but chose not to make a fuss.

Shirley quickly approached Emily.

Shirley said, "Emily, I didn't get a chance to ask you yesterday how you're doing here. Patrick drove off with me, but I managed to convince him to let me come check on you."
Xyla thought Shirley seemed like a caring person.

Shirley said, "Oh. the water's a bit cold. Xyla. is there any hot water?"


"Ill get some." Xyla fetched a kettle and poured hot water into Shirley's cup and Emily's water bottle.

Poor Emily! Xyla thought to herself.

"Thanks." Emily took a sip from her bottle.


Immediately. Emily felt something was wrong. Her body heated up.and her mind became foggy.


"Emily, are you okay? You're burning up. Maybe you have a fever.Xyla.please watch Emily. I'll get the car."

Shirley pretended to be concerned. grabbed Emily's bag and phone.and rushed out.

[I'll be waiting in room 316 at Whispering Pines Inn.] Shirley sent the message to Marlon and quickly deleted it.


Shirley brought Emily's car around. Xyla helped Emily downstairs but was stopped by Shirley.

Shirley said, "Xyla, if the boss comes, just cover for Emily,okay?"

Xyla nodded in agreement.

Marlon had just sat down when Patrick stormed in with a dark expression.
"What are you doing here?"

They spoke at the same time. but Patrick's voice was more menacing.

Patrick said. "I should be asking you why you were with her!"

Before Marlon could respond, he received a message from Emily.
Marlon was stunned. After a moment's hesitation, he handed his phone to Patrick. Patrick's anger flared.

Patrick said. "Are you trying to show off?"

Marlon said. "No, don't you think something's off?"


Indeed.Emily had just arrived in Canyon Ridge and wasn't familiar with the area. Plus, she was too dedicated to skip work for a fling.


"Damn it!"

Patrick sped to Whispering Pines Inn.

"I'm not even in the car!" Marlon followed in his own car.


Patrick rushed to the inn. ignoring the front desk, and burst into room 316. Emily was on the bed, eyes closed, face flushed, and breathing heavily. The drug had taken effect.


"Emily.wake up!"

Patrick tried to rouse her, but it was no use. Emily was burning up.His presence seemed to bring Emily a sliver of clarity. She felt a familiar, comforting presence.
Patrick picked her up and rushed to his Bentley. Emily had been drugged.


When Marlon arrived at room 316. it was empty. He realized he was too late.


Patrick gently placed Emily in the back seat. but she clung to him.seeking the coolness he provided.

Emily's moans grew louder as she writhed in the back seat. desperate.

Patrick,unable to pull away. closed the car door.

"Emily,you owe me again."

Patrick kissed her, and Emily eagerly responded. They were soon entwined.


The kiss was like a jolt of energy. Emily's body, burning with desire,responded intensely. She tried to stay conscious but succumbed to Patrick's warmth.


Emily clung to Patrick, her body soft and warm.

Patrick's feelings were mixed. He knew Emily had been set up,but he couldn't shake the image of her with Marlon.


Fueled by jealousy, Patrick gave Emily's chest a nip.

Emily's cries grew more intense as she rubbed against him. Patrick pulled down her pants and, without hesitation, thrust into her.


Patrick held Emily tightly, as if trying to merge their bodies.
In the car. Patrick released his pent-up emotions. the vehicle shaking with their movements. After a while. Patrick's release overflowed.filling Emily.


Emily relaxed and opened her eyes to see Patrick. His presence always soothed her fears. As sleep overtook her. the world faded away.
###Chapter 11 Conspiring to Drug Her?

When Emily woke up, she found herself staring at a spotless white ceiling, the faint smell of disinfectant in the air. She strained to move her eyes, scanning the room, and realized she was in a spacious.bright hospital room. It was empty. except for the occasional chirping of birds outside the window breaking the silence.

She tried to recall the events of the previous night. but her memory was a blur. She vaguely remembered feeling feverish, almost burning up,then a cool sensation on her lips. She instinctively moved towards the coolness. eager to immerse herself in that comfort. Thinking about it made her cheeks flush.


Just then, the door to the room opened gently, and a nurse walked in.Seeing Emily awake. she smiled warmly. "You're finally awake. How are you feeling?"


Emily forced a weak smile and asked. "Where am I? What happened to me?"


The nurse patiently explained, "You were brought in last night. After some tests, we found traces of an aphrodisiac in your system. But don't worry, you're fine now. Just rest for a few days."


She added, "And if you need to report this to the police, please let me know."


The nurse had seen many girls who, desperate to win a boyfriend's sympathy, would risk their own well-being.


But someone as stunning and naturally alluring as Emily? That
seemed unlikely.

"Thanks." Emily nodded awkwardly.

The nurse picked up a chart. made a few notes. and turned to leave.

Emily said. "Excuse me, do you know who brought me to the hospital last night?" Emily called out to the nurse.


"Yes. I remember clearly. It was a man with very refined features.but he had a stern expression," the nurse said. blushing slightly. "Although I didn't talk to him much. I could sense his confidence and authority."


Patrick's image immediately came to Emily's mind. She remembered seeing those deep eyes in her hazy state theprevious night.


The nurse said, "He said he found you in front of Whispering Pines Inn and brought you here because you didn't look well."

Emily asked. "Is all of this what he told you?"

The nurse said, "Yes, and he's a very kind man!"

Could it be someone other than Patrick?

Emily's heart tightened, followed by a wave of inexplicable disappointment.


Lying on the white hospital bed, she recalled the events of the previous day.

She did feel dizzy, initially thinking it was just exhaustion. But now,
it seemed far more complicated.

As her memory became clearer. Emily remembered some details before she lost consciousness. She returned to her desk. avoiding Shirley nearby. Later. Xyla from the opposite desk offered her some hot water. Having been out on business and not drinking water.she was indeed thirsty and. out of politeness. accepted the cup without much thought and took a big gulp.


It was after drinking the water that her body started to feel increasingly hot, her legs grew weak. and her consciousness began to fade...

Emily also remembered seeing Shirley's meaningful gaze in her daze.

Could it be that Shirley and Xyla had drugged her?

Emily couldn't accept this. She had just started working there and had no significant conflicts with Xyla, who had been the friendliest to her on her first day. As for Shirley. Emily had never intended to compete with her. She had even considered leaving the Rivera Group and Patrick to avoid conflict. Shirley had always targeted her, but Emily had dismissed it as petty jealousy. She never expected this...


Reality was often harsher than imagined. Emily now understood that in this harsh society, trust was a rare commodity.

She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.

The most important thing now was to uncover the truth. Although Emily had her suspicions, finding evidence was crucial.
Emily got up and faced the window. A breeze blew in. but she felt an unusual chill.

"Emily? Are you feeling better?"

Emily turned around to see Xyla.

"Yeah,much better."


Emily was puzzled. What was Xyla's plan? Emily hadn't even confronted Xyla yet. and here she was.

Xyla said, "Actually, I'm here to apologize."

Xyla put down the fruit she was holding, looking uneasy

"Apologize?" Emily was taken aback by the sudden confession.

"I'm sorry, Emily!" Xyla bowed deeply, her sincerity evident.

Xyla said sincerely, "I've been feeling feverish for a few days, but I didn't report it to the company because I needed the full attendance bonus."


Emily frowned, confused by the explanation.

Xyla explained, "When you suddenly got a fever yesterday,I feared I might have infected you. I thought it was only right to apologize in person. I'm really sorry! My whole family relies on my income, so every dollar counts for me, even if it seems like a small amount to you."


Emily looked at Xyla's earnest eyes, feeling a mix of frustration and
amusement.

She had been drugged, not infected with a virus.

Emily couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity.

Emily asked. "What about the child's father?"

Xyla explained. "He passed away before the child was born."

Emily asked, "Did you remarry?"

Xyla blushed deeply and shook her head.

Emily thought of her own mother, who had raised her and her brother alone after their father passed away. Every dollar had to be stretched to cover their needs.


After Xyla left, Emily's thoughts became clearer. If it wasn't Xyla,then it had to be Shirley.

But Shirley's influence was too strong, and she had to be cautious.

To avoid alerting anyone, Emily didn't rush to the police. Instead.she took a long leave from work, citing her need to recover.

Strangely, Patrick didn't question her and quickly approved her leave.

Emily was puzzled but didn't dwell on it. She knew she had to stay sharp and gather evidence while preventing Shirley from destroying any.

Emily decíded to start with the most direct approach. She requested
the surveillance footage from the Canyon Ridge project site. claiming she had lost something. In the fragmented footage, she saw Shirley helping her, already disoriented, into a car.


Shirley was holding her crossbody bag and phone. However.when she tried to get a clearer view. the image became blurry when zoomed in.


Rewinding the footage. Emily saw Shirley stop the car. do something with Emily's phone. and then put it back in the bag.

So it was Shirley. But what had she done with Emily's phone?

Emily suspected Shirley had used her phone to contact Patrick,wanting him to see her in a vulnerable state.


Emily shook her head at the thought. saved the video clips, and headed to Whispering Pines Inn, hoping the hotel's footage would reveal the truth.
###Chapter 12 Refuse to Admit

When Emily dashed into the Whispering Pines Inn, she immediately recognized a familiar figure with curly hair and a slim waist. It was Shirley. Emily instantly felt like this trip was going to be a total waste of time.


Sure enough, the hotel manager told Emily that the surveillance cameras had been broken for a week and were still being fixed.


Emily had seen this coming. She felt a wave of disappointment. That video was super important to her.

"Hold up! Ma'am!"

The front desk clerk hurried over.

"Hey there, ma'am. Your friend has an outstanding balance for two days. Could you please contact her to either check out or settle the bill?"


"Friend?" Emily was confused.

The clerk said, "Yeah, the one who came back with you a few nights ago."

Emily's mind started racing. This couldbe a breakthrough.

"You've seen me before?" Emily asked cautiously, wondering if the clerk had been bribed by Shirley.


The clerk said, "Yeah, a couple of nights ago, you and your friend came in together. You seemed pretty drunk, and she was helping you
the whole time. I was on duty that night."

Emily said, "Right, that was me. I just didn't remember at first. I'll settle her bill, but I need to go to the room and gather some things."


"Of course, no problem!" The clerk quickly activated the elevator.afraid Emily might change her mind.

In room 316. Emily found Shirley's brooch on the floor.

This was the most direct evidence.

Satisfied with her discovery, Emily gathered all the materials and confidently drove to the office. She wanted Patrick to see how dirty his supposedly innocent and kind goddess was behind the scenes.


Thinking of Patrick's furrowed brows, Emily felt even more delighted,her steps lighter.


Before she could enter Patrick's office, she heard Shirley's soft voice in the hallway.


Shirley said, "Patrick, I didn't mean to make a mistake. I just haven't learned yet."

Patrick asked, "Didn't Emily teach you before?"

Shirley said, "Patrick, please don't blame Emily. She's always so busy with various meetings..."


Patrick's mind flashed to the image of Emily writhing beneath him. If he hadn't arrived in time, Marlon might have had his way with her!
Patrick got angry, slamming the documents on the desk.

Shirley. never having seen Patrick so angry. was stunned.

Shirley covered her eyes, pretending to cry.

Emily walked straight into the office, clapping her hands."Bravo!Such acting skills are wasted as a secretary."


Patrick was already irritated.

Shirley's data error had cost the company nearly a million dollars. All related departments were reporting to him, indirectly expressing their dissatisfaction with Shirley.


This loss was nothing to Patrick. But such a trivial matter reaching his desk annoyed him. When Emily was in charge, there were never such mistakes.


But thinking of Emily made Patrick even angrier.

"Aren't you on vacation? Why are you here?" Patrick asked expressionlessly, hiding his anger.

"Of course, to watch a good show!" Emily smiled at Shirley.

Shirley, who had stopped crying the moment Emily entered, felt a chiIl down her spine.


Emily didn't plan to hide anything. She took out the recording and video, handing them to Patrick. Patrick placed the phone on the desk and played it.
As the video played. Shirley's face turned pale, her eyes filled with panic. and her hands clenched tightly.


Shirley felt a sense of doom. Her act of drugginng Emily was likely exposed.


Her heart raced. feeling a heavy weight on her chest. Shirley knew that if Emily exposed her, she would face legal consequences. lose her reputation. and her beloved Patrick. These were unacceptable outcomes.

Shirley thought. No! Absolutely not!'

In extreme fear and anxiety. Shirley began plotting an escape.thinking of ways to create false evidence and destroy the real ones.She knew time was running out.

Just as Shirley tried to grab the phone. Patrick picked it up.

"So? What are you trying to say with this video?" Patrick's tone was unusually calm.

Emily was stunned. Wasn't it obvious?

Emily said seriously, "So, my illness wasn't an accident. Someone tried to harm me!"


Patrick looked at Emily with a complex expression.

He said coldly, "Just based on this video?"


"Isn't this enough?" Emily was about to mention the hotel front desk as a witness but stopped herself.
Years of companionship had never earned her genuine affection.Even a bit of pity would have sufficed forEmily.

But the next second. Patrick deleted the video.

Emily watched as the evidence disappeared from the screen. feeling an indescribable anger and frustration. She couldn't believe that the evidence she painstakingly gathered was deleted by Patrick.


She looked up, her eyes piercing, and questioned. "Why did you do that? Do you know how much effort I put into getting this evidence?"


Patrick's eyes showed a flicker of complex emotions. After a moment of silence, he said, "That just means you're stupid!"


Patrick's eyes deliberately avoided hers, but Emily,filled with disappointment, didn't notice. She didn't understand why Patrick called her stupid or why he deleted her hard-earned video. But she knew she had to rely on herself now. She had to uncover the truth and make Shirley pay for everything.


Seeing Patrick's actions, Shirley quickly regained her composure.realizing he was on her side.


Shirley said confidently, "Emily, don't falsely accuse me. I never drugged you. Your so-called evidence is fabricated. I saw you unwell and kindly took you to the hospital, stopping by the hotel to get my ID.How can you accuse me?"


Emily sneered, "Do you think I'd stoop to your level? Do you think I only have this one piece of evidence?"
Seeing Shirley's stunned expression, Emily calmly took out a delicate brooch.


Shirley recognized it immediately as hers.

Feigning calm, Shirley said. "A brooch means nothing."

"I found this on the floor in room 316." Emily sneered.

"So what?" Shirley acted defiant.

"You seem to forget this brooch is a limited edition,with your name engraved inside!" Emily's words struck Shirley's heart.

Shirley looked pitifully at Patrick, but he showed no intention of intervening, watching them with interest.

"Emily, even a cornered rat will fight!" Shirley,enraged, reached for the brooch in Emily's hand.


Emily wasn't foolish, holding the brooch tightly. They struggled, but Emily underestimated Shirley's shamelessness. Shirley grabbed Emily's hair and tried to stomp on her foot with her high heel. Emily dodged, causing Shirley to fall forward, grabbing Emily's bracelet as she fell.


Just five feet from the window, Shirley crashed to the floor, the bracelet flying out the window.

"Have you two had enough?!" Patrick shouted.
###Chapter 13 Just a Bracelet

As the bracelet slipped from her wrist, Emily's heart sank right along with it. Ignoring Patrick's shouts, she bolted out the door.

The sun was blazing. but Emily didn't care. She dropped to her knees.sifting through the dirt and trash, not missing a single spot. Her clothes got filthy, her hair a mess, but she didn't care. All she wanted was to find that bracelet.


Minutes ticked by, and Emily came up empty-handed. Desperation started to creep in, tears threatening to spill as her emotions bubbled over.


Suddenly, a pair of long legs appeared in front of her. The figure,dressed in a suit she once knew so well, now seemed like a stranger,standing boldly in her way.


"Emily, what are you doing?" Patrick's voice had a mix of confusion and mockery. "Is that bracelet a gift from some other guy?"


Emily looked up at Patrick's handsome but cold face, anger flaring up inside her.


Right now, she didn't want to say a word to him, even though he was someone she had once loved deeply.

Everything had happened so fast, faster than Emily had expected.
She knew he would side with Shirley, but she hadn't thought he'd
hurt someone who had loved him silently for so long just for Shirley!

"Is this fun for you?" Emily sneered.
For years,she had supported Patrick without question, acting as both his secretary and his caretaker, doing everything to please him. Even during her period, she would still meet his sexual needs. But in the end, what did she get in return? He knew she had been drugged, yet he still protected the person who harmed her!


She knew Patrick had always misunderstood her, thinking she was a woman who relied on men. But this time, she was truly enraged.


"Patrick, what gives you the right to say that to me?" Emily's voice shook with anger.


At this moment, Emily's eyes were red, a side of her Patrick had never seen before.


Maybe realizing he had gone too far, Patrick didn't stop Emily any further. He stayed silent for a moment, then turned and went back upstairs.


The sunlight slanted across the lawn, casting Emily's figure in the dirt and grass, making her look particularly disheveled. Her hands were covered in dirt, her clothes torn in several places, but her eyes shone with determination. She had to find that bracelet.


In the CEO's office, Patrick stood by the window, staring at the small yet infinitely energetic figure below.


After a moment of hesitation, Patrick picked up the phone and called the security department.

The call from the CEO's office caused a stir in the security department. Since the company's establishment, Patrick had never
directly contacted the security department; it was always his secretary or assistant who did.


The entire security team immediately assembled and went downstairs to search for the bracelet.


Emily's fingers were caked with dirt, but there was no sign of the bracelet. Just as she was about to give up. a security guard appeared in her view. holding something in his hand. It was ordinary, slightly oxidized, and not very bright, clearly old.

Emily's heart raced. She rushed over and snatched the item from the guard's hand. It was her lost bracelet!


"I finally found it!" Emily clutched the bracelet tightly, collapsing to the grouand in tears. She no longer cared about her appearance,only holding the bracelet close to her chest.


The security guard, confused, was signaled by his supervisor to return to his post.

Patrick watched thoughtfully from upstairs. He couldn't understand why Emily cherished such an ordinary bracelet. He had bought her various bracelets made of jade, gemstones, and gold, but she never wore them.Instead, she always wore this cheap bracelet.


He was insanely jealous. At first, he thought their relationship was just a convenient arrangement, but over time, his feelings for Emily grew stronger. Even with the drugging incident, Patrick had deleted the video to protect her. Shirley's background was way more complicated than it seemed, and he was already gathering evidence.
He didn't want to drag Emily back into the mess. But he couldn't explain all this to her yet.

"Emily,how could you be so careless?"

A gentle voice sounded beside her. It was Marlon.


Marlon had coincidentally passed by the Rivera Group and was planning to visit Patrick when he saw Emily in such a disheveled state.


Marlon's eyes were filled with concern and tenderness. Seeing Emily like this, he felt a pang of heartache and instinctively reached out his hand.


Emily hesitated, looking at Marlon's outstretched hand, but didn't take it. Marlon gently helped her up by her arm and then carefully wiped the dirt from her hands with a wet wipe.

Emily felt awarm current in her heart from Marlon's kindness.

"It's okay now," Marlon said.


Emily looked into Marlon's deeply affectionate eyes, unable to hold back her tears any longer.


Marlon glanced upstairs, meeting Patrick's warning gaze. Under that gaze, he seemed to understand something.

Marlon said with a gentle smile, "I'll take you home."

For Emily,where was home? Was it the dorm where Lisa lived or the apartment Patrick had rented for her?
"Actually. I don't know where my home is." Emily thought of her childhood home with her parents and brother. That was home. but it was long gone. never to return.

Seeing Emily's distress. Marlon turned around and headed to his villa.

Marlon poured a glass of warm water and handed it to Emily.

Marlon said sincerely, "Everyone thinks I'm a spoiled troublemaker.but I've been living independently since fifth grade. My parents only appear together at public events. Privately, they do their own thing.It's ridiculous, isn't it?"

Emily looked at Marlon's sincere face.

Emily asked. "Is that why you haven't gotten married?"

"That's part of the reason. I don't want to repeat my parents' path,pretending to be a loving couple when they're not. But it's also because I haven't met the right person. But now, things are different."

Marlon looked at Emily with deep affection.

"Maybe now, I'll consider marriage. Who knows?"

Emily fell silent.

Marlon sensed her discomfort, smiled, and asked, "What happened to you? How did you end up like this?"

Emily looked at the bracelet on her wrist. "Because it almost got lost.My dad passed away early. This is the only thing he left me.Whenever I see it, I remember his love and expectations. So, it's very
immoctand to hme.

Mariom's eyes shoored a mix of restrect amd sxumpanhy.

"But now it's ckay. Twe foomd in." Emály smniled,and Marlem wias momentarily stunned.


"What's wrong? Did I diirty the couchn?" Emily asiced cantiousiy.


Marlon said with a playful smille. "If you could dirty a dark brown couch, that would be impressive."


Emily's clothes were indeed covered in dirt, making her uncomfortable.


Marlon said. "There's a bath in the bathroom. Go take a warm bath."

Emily locked at Marlon warily.


Marlon gently patted her head. "Don't worry. Ill be in the living room playing games. I'm not interested in peeking."


Emily smiled awkwardly and went to the bathroom. locking the door behind her.


Just then. the doorbelI rang. Marlon looked through the video intercom and saw Patrick standing outside the villa.
###Chapter 14 In Marlon's House

In the bathroom. Emily peeled off her mud-stained clothes,revealing her smooth skin, firm breasts, and long, toned legs. She stood there.staring at her naked reflection in the mirror, her eyes a swirl of emotions.


The bathtub was surrounded by fancy tiles, and a crystal chandelier hung above, casting a shimmering light onto the water. The whole setup made the bathroom feel like a private sanctuary. cut off from the world.


Emily dipped her hand into the water but didn't get in. Instead, she turned on the shower, letting the warm water wash over her tired body.


Outside the bathroom, Patrick and Marlon were sitting on the couch,facing each other.

Patrick heard the shower and couldn't help but furrow his brows,clearly annoyed.

The living room atmosphere got awkward.

Marlon turned on the TV and switched to the game console.

"Want to play a round?" Marlon suggested.


Patrick and Marlon had met while studying abroad. They were the heirs to the Rivera Group and the Hughes Group,respectively,and had unknowingly crossed paths. They were notorious for skipping classes. Patrick still pulled A's, while Marlon hovered around C's and
D's.

Unexpectedly, they were paired together to represent their school in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. The competition was fierce, but their teamwork and skills led them to victory in the global finals.

"Sure," Patrick said. grabbing the game controller.

The game was a popular battle game that required high-level skills and quick reflexes. As the game started, the screen filled with intense combat scenes.


Marlon quickly gained the upper hand, his familiarity with the game evident. "What's the matter? Haven't played in a while, and your skills have gotten rusty?" he teased.


Patrick ignored Marlon, focusing intently on the game. He didn't want to lose. Soon, his deep understanding of the game mechanics and strategic thinking turned the tide.

The match grew more intense, with flashy skills and effects lighting up the screen. But Marlon wasn't about to lose either.


The game went on for a long time, and Marlon eventually won by a narrow margin. He looked at Patrick's slightly frustrated expression and said with a teasing smile, "Mr. Rivera, it's just a game. Don't take it too seriously."


Patrick shot Marlon a glance, not wanting to engage.

At that moment, the bathroom door opened softly, and Emily
emerged,steam swirling around her. Her wet hair fell loosely over her shoulders, and water droplets trailed down her face.


Her eyes were a bit dazed as she looked at Patrick on the couch.surprised to see him there but not showing it much.

Emily was already disappointed in Patrick.

Patrick's face darkened further upon seeing Emily. He couldn't understand why she had so easily come to Marlon's place. But when he noticed she was still wearing her dirty clothes. his expression softened slightly.


At the office, from the moment Emily had started frantically searching for her bracelet, Patrick hadn't taken his eyes off her. When he saw Marlon take her away, he had followed them, driving like a madman.


"I remember leaving you some clean clothes in the bathroom. Why didn't you change?" Marlon asked gently.

"No need to trouble yourself. I'll wear this," Emily replied calmly.


Patrick felt ignored, and Emily's response triggered his temper.He stood up. walked over to her, and grabbed her wrist tightly.


"You're really something, looks like you need a man on speed dial!"Patrick whispered harshly in her ear.


Emily, unlike before, used all her strength to shake off his hand,looking at him coldly.
"It is none of your business! Mr. Rivera. I think you might want to reconsider what you just said!"


Patrick said angrily, "None of my business? Emily, get a grip. As long as you're with the Rivera Group,you're mine!"


Emily looked at him, her feelings complicated.

Patrick was domineering, always wanting things his way. Emily had known this, thinking it was just a facade he put up. She believed he was kind and soft-hearted underneath, shaped by his tough experiences. She had tried to warm him, to soothe his anxieties. But now, she needed to reassess their relationship.


"Patrick, you really went too far this time!" Marlon stepped in, trying to ease the tension.


Patrick ignored Marlon, his eyes fixed on the bracelet on Emily's wrist.


Patrick sneered, "Which man gave you that?"


Emily looked at Patrick, saying nothing. She had tried to understand him, but had he ever tried to understand her?


Marlon stepped forward. "Patrick, what are you thinking? Don't you know what kind of person she is?"


Patrick glared at Marlon. "I don't need you to remind me. I know exactly what kind of person she is!"


Marlon sighed, "If you know so well, then you must know how
important that bracelet is to her. It's her everything."

Patrick was puzzled but didn't show it.

Marlon continued. "It's the last and only thing her father left her."

"What?" Patrick was shocked. He knew how much Emily cherished the bracelet but had never imagined it was her father's last gift.


"Now that you know, Mr. Rivera. please leave. I have nothing more to say to you." Emily said, her voice cold and firm.


Emily had never imagined she would speak to Patrick like this. He had always been special to her.


Patrick felt a mix of guilt and anger. Emily had never shared this with him, not even when he was upset about it. Yet, she had easily told Marlon everything.

"Come with me!" Patrick demanded.

They stood there, locked in a standoff, until Emily's stomach growled.

"How about I treat us to dinner?" Marlon suggested.

The three of them went to a restaurant.

Marlon and Emily sat on one side, Patrick on the other. The restaurant was small but famous, serving only 20 guests a day.


However, the atmosphere was tense and awkward.

Just then, Shirley walked over.
###Chapter 15 Shirley Is Everywhere!

Shirley said. "Patrick, what are you doing here? I was supposed to meet Karen, but she just called to say she can't make it. I wwas about to leave."


Emily couldn't believe her rotten luck. bumping into Shirley while just trying to grab a bite. She wished she could hurl her steak right into Shirley's smug face.


"Emily, what a surprise seeing you here." Shirley said, her voice oozing with fake sweetness.


Shirley's eyes locked onto the bracelet on Emily's wrist. "You found the bracelet! I was just thinking about how to explain it to you.I swear. I didn't toss it on purpose."

Emily shot her a cold look. "You're the one who threw it. Don't push your luck,Shirley."


Shirley turned to Patrick with a pitiful expression. "Patrick, Emily's been holding a grudge against me ever since you taught me how to handle the airline and hotel accounts. I've explained it to her so many times,but..."

"But what?" Patrick asked, his voice icy.

"But Emily is still upset about you teaching me the job!" Shirley said.pouting.


Emily said, "Shirley, stop making stuff up! I'm just an employee.How Mr. Rivera teaches you is none of my business. I have no reason
to hold a grudge over it!"

"An employee..." Patrick repeated, his face darkening. After all these years. she still saw their relationship as just a professional one. Had she not noticed how he treated her all this time?


Shirley. undeterred. shamelessly sat down next to Patrick.

Marlon handed a plate of cut steak to Emily. "Weren't you hungry?Eat something. It's not good for your stomach to stay empty."


Emily was grateful for Marlon's help in this awkward moment. But seeing Patrick's furrowed brows. she hesitated.


"Marlon, when did you become so considerate? But your kindness might not be appreciated." Shirley said, trying to stir up trouble.


Emily, who initially wanted to refuse, took the plate of steak, picked up a fork, and started eating. The tender meat melted on her tongue,filling her mouth with a rich aroma.


"Why are you eating steak? This place is famous for its Grilled Shrimp with Smoky Paprika. Don't you know that?" Shirley batted her eyes at Marlon.


Marlon sighed, "Shirley, is there a reason you're acting so flustered?Did you forget how to hold a conversation?"


"Marlon, watch your language!" Patrick scolded harshly.

No wonder Shirley dared to be so brazen. Emily shook her head in resignation.
Soon. Grilled Shrimp with Smoky Paprika was served. Marlon carefully peeled a shrimp and placed the tender meat in Emily's bowl.

Emily feIt a warm surge in her heart. She looked at Marlon gratefully."Thank you."


However, this scene deeply hurt Patrick. Watching Marlon care for Emily so tenderly, a flash of anger crossed his eyes. He couldn't stand seeing his woman being doted on by another man.


Shirley, on the other hand, had a sly smile on her face. She brought a peeled shrimp close to Patrick's mouth. "Patrick, you usually peel them for me. This time, let me do it. Open up."

"Look at that couple over there, so sweet."

"Stop staring, they're just a pair of lovebirds!"

"The guy is really handsome, and the gir1, well, she's quite pretty too.They make a great pair!"


Emily listened to the comments from the neighboring table and watched Shirley cling to Patrick. Her mood plummeted, feeling like a clown in this situation.


Shirley looked at Emily with a triumphant expression. "By the way,Emily, I think you misunderstood something."

Emily asked,"What?"

Shirley said, "The incident where you were drugged."

"Drugged?" Marlon almost spat out his drink, whispering in shock.
This reaction was exactly what Shirley had hoped for.

Shirley said. "Marlon doesn't know? I shouldn't have said anything.Never mind. it's nothing."


Shirley's face was full of malicious glee.

Marlon remembered the day Emily texted him to come to room 316at the hotel. When he got there, the room was empty, and later he heard she had gone to the hospital. He knew something was off but didn't dig deeper at the time.

That unease led Marlon to visit the Rivera Group, just to check on Emily.


Emily,who had anticipated Shirley bringing this up, stayed calm and resolute. She looked at Shirley for a moment before speaking slowly,"Don't worry, I won't let the person behind this get away. She will pay for what she did!"


Shirley's face turned pale, her eyes darting nervously. She glanced at Patrick, hoping he'd back her up, but his expression only brought her disappointment.


Marlon looked at Emily with deep sympathy. "It's allin the past.You have me now."


Upon hearing that Marlon was still defending Emily,Shirley remarked with a hint of malice. "Marlon, your feelings for Emily are truly admirable!" She then feigned innocence.

Patrick, sitting across from Emily, looked like he could kill someone
with his glare.

"Emily, did you report it to the police?" Marlon asked, concerned.

"Yes, I will. I won't let this go!"

Emily looked Patrick in the eye, her words firm and serious.

Patrick chose to remain silent.

The meal ended on a sour note.

Outside the restaurant, the lights were dim and romantic.

"I'll take you home," Marlon offered.

Emily refused, "No need, it's close by. I'll just grab a cab."

Marlon was full of concern.

Shirley, meanwhile, clung to Patrick's arm, planning to leave with him. But Patrick shook her off, his gaze fixed on Emily.

Patrick said, "Shirley, I have something important to discuss with Emily. You can take a cab."

He added, "Emily, get in the car."

Patrick's tone left no room for argument.

Emily hesitated but got into Patrick's car.

Marlon shook his head in resignation and went to get his car.
Shirley stood there, stunned. She thought she had Patrick wrapped around her finger, but she watched Patrick and Emily drive away.her heart filled with anger and resentment.


Shirley thought, 'Emily, you don't think this is my last move,do you?I won't let you off easily!'


The Bentley stopped in front of the apartment building. Patrick and Emily got out, one after the other.

Emily said, "What do you want to say? Say it here."

Knowing Patrick well, Emily knew he had something important to discuss.


"What, I can't go to the apartment I rented myself?"

Before Emily could react, Patrick had already stepped into the elevator.


Using the fingerprint scanner, they entered the apartment. Before Emily could change her shoes, Patrick had her pinned against the wall.


Patrick asked,"Why didn't you tell me this was left to you by your father?"


Emily was puzzled, thinking, 'Is that what he wanted to ask? Is this so important? But he never lets me explain.'

Just as she was about to answer, Patrick leaned down and kissed her.

Patrick's familiar scent surrounded Emily, but this time, she had no
interest in continuing.

She struggled fiercely, the taste of blood filling Patrick's mouth.


Patrick stopped, saying. "This ends here. As compensation,I've bought this apartment and put it in your name."


Although the apartment wasn't large, it was located in the bustling city center, right by a winding river, with convenient transportation,shopping, dining, and entertainment facilities. Recently, the arrival of a prestigious university neaby had driven up property prices.

But was her reputation worth just an apartment?

"Patrick, what do you take me for?" Emily looked at Patrick with anger, tears welling up in her eyes.

"Think it over." Patrick turned and left.
###Chapter 16 Mysterious Disappearance

Patrick's worst nightmare had finally come true.


When Emily woke up, she started packing her clothes. So much had gone down lately, and she needed to see Lisa back in the old neighborhood.

Emily thought, 'Mom's probably cooled off by now.'

When she got there, Emily climbed the stairs, thinking about how to convince her mom to go to rehab. She knocked on the door a bunch of times,but no one answered.


Emily pulled out her phone and called Lisa, but there was no answwer.

'Maybe she's still mad at me, Emily thought as she turned to leave.Just as she was about to walk out of the building, she bumped into Carol, who was coming back from grocery shopping.

Carol said, "Emily, you're back! Come on in, your mom left the key with me."


"The key?"

Emily followed Carol inside, confused.

Carol handed Emily a key and a letter.

Carol said, "Emily, your mom's been having a rough time. She didn't want to drag you down. The day you left, she regretted it right away,regretting the harsh words she said to you..."
Emily forced a smile."Carol, I get it."

Holding the key and the letter, Emily opened the door to her home.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a warm glow in the living room. Emily felt a sense of peace as she looked around at the familiar surroundings.

She sat quietly on the couch and opened the letter.

Lisa: [My dear Emily, by the time you read this letter, I will have already gone to rehab. Don't worry, Patrick has covered the costs. He told me everything about you two. I misunderstood you, and I owe you an apology. Emily, my good daughter, you've suffered a lot with me these past few years. But I only have you and your brother. I've thought a lot and decided I can't continue like this. So this timne,please believe in me! Please check on your brother often and take care of yourself.]

Emily held the letter, curling up on the couch.

Had she really misjudged Patrick?

She wasn't sure. But at this moment, she felt a bit grateful to Patrick.At least he had helped her maintain a good image in front of her mom.


As Emily pondered the letter, her phone suddenly rang.

She glanced at the screen; it was a call from the special school. An ominous feeling washed over her.
"Hello, is this Emily? I'm Gordon's teacher. I'm sorry to bother you.but there's something I need to tell you. Gordon's gone missing!" The teacher's voice was filled with urgency.


Emily's heart skipped a beat, and she could almost hear her own heartbeat.


She tried to stay calm and asked, "How did this happen? Isn't he supposed to be at school?"


"Yes, he was supposed to be. But this afternoon, there was a special donation event at Seaside Splash Park. We counted everyone before leaving, but when we returned, we realized Gordon was missing. We've contacted the park staff and checked the surveillance footage.Gordon did get on the bus, but we've searched the playground and the school, and we can't find him."


The teacher's voice carried a hint of guilt.

Emily couldn't listen to the teacher's explanations anymore. She hung up, grabbed her car keys, and rushed out. She wanted to find Gordon!

Emily drove frantically to the special school. She burst in, seeing the teacher and several staff members anxiously searching.


"Emily, you're here. We've already called the cops; they'll be here soon. Don't worry, we'll figure this out together," the teacher said,walking up to Emily.


Emily nodded, trying to keep it together. She started searching the campus, checking every nook and cranny. She called out Gordon's name, hoping he'd hear her and respond.
As time ticked by, Emily's anxiety skyrocketed. She had no clue where Gordon could be or if he was in danger.


Just then, her phone rang again. It was Marlon.

"Emily. I heard about your brother. I'm on my way. Don't worry. we'll find him together." Marlon's voice was both urgent and comforting.

Emily felt a warmth in her heart and nodded. saying. "Okay."

Marlon showed up quickly, and together they kept searching for Gordon. They asked everyone who might have seen him but got no useful info.


"Could Gordon still be at Seaside Splash Park?" Emily wondered aloud.


As it got darker, Emily could no longer stay calm. She grabbed the teacher's hand, asking desperately, "Are you sure he got on the bus?"


"Emily, if the surveillance shows Gordon got on the bus, he must have returned. Don't worry, I've contacted the park, and we'll get the video soon," Marlon said, gently patting Emily's shoulder.


"Let's think again. Are there any places we might have missed?"Marlon asked the teachers and staff.

"We've searched everywhere," the young teacher said, her voice trembling.


Just then, the park staff sent over the video. The footage showed Gordon getting on the school bus, followed closely by a slender
woman.


"Wait, who is that?" the young teacher asked, pointing at the woman behind Gordon.


Emily and Marlon exchanged puzzled looks.

"She's not from our school!" the young teacher exclaimed,showing the phone to the principal.


The principal tried to zoom in, but the woman was wearing a tracksuit,sunglasses, and a mask, making it hard to identify her.

"Could she be a kidnapper?!"

Everyone fell silent, feeling a wave of despair.

Just then, a staff member, who had been watching the video,said,"I think I saw this boy run to the storage room behind the school building this afternoon."


Emily and Marlon were overjoyed and rushed to the storage room without hesitation.


The door was tightly shut. Emily pushed it open, and a musty smell hit her.


They stepped inside, looking around. Suddenly, Emily saw a familiar figure curled up in the corner, like a trapped puppy.

Without thinking, she ran over and hugged Gordon, tears streaming down her face.
"Gordon,you scared me! If something happened to you, what would I do? What would Mom do?" Emily cried.

Gordon stared blankly at Emily.

"Why did you come here?" Emily asked anxiously.


Gordon, frightened, struggled and broke free from Emily, running outside.


Marlon quickly stepped in to help chase after Gordon.

Marlon caught Gordon, holding him gently and speaking softly to calm him down.


After some effort, they finally managed to soothe Gordon.

Emily stroked Gordon's head, saying, "It's okay now. I won't ask anymore. Don't be scared. We're going home,right now."

On the way home, Marlon tried asking Gordon what happened, but he stayed silent. Fearing more harm, Emily interrupted Marlon's questions.

"I thought it was Emily, so I went to wait," Gordon stammered.

Emily and Marlon exchanged confused looks.
###Chapter 17 The Truth Is Not That Simple

Marlon drove Emily and Gordon back to their apartment in the city.He wanted to stick around, but Gordon insisted he leave, so Marlon reluctantly took off.


As Marlon was driving away, he thought he spotted a familiar silver Bentley, but when he looked again, it was gone. Shrugging it off,he headed back home.


In a hidden corner downstairs, a Bentley was parked. Patrick sat inside,staring wistfully at the warm light in Emily's apartment.

Earlier that morning. Patrick had gone to Emily's apartment, but no one was home. He figured she might have gone back to the city, so he knocked on the door for a while. Eventually, Carol from downstairs answered.


"You're looking for Emily, right?" Carol asked with a friendly smile.

Patrick nodded, not wanting to say much.

"She came back today. She might be out shopping now. Why don't you come in and wait?" Carol invited him warmly.


Maybe it had been too long since Patrick felt the warmth of a home,so he followed Carol inside.


Carol poured a cup of hot water and handed it to Patrick. He took it but didn't drink, instead observing Carol's home.

The 600-square-foot apartment had a sofa, TV, and fridge, all a bit
old but neatly kept.

"Emily's had a tough life." Carol said with a smile.

"When she was little, her dad passed away. Lisa worked far away, so Emily took care of her younger brother. One summer, the kids bought me a big birthday cake. I saved a piece for Emily, but she wouldn't eat it. She said she didn't like cake, but I saw her swallow hard a few times. She wanted to save it for her brother. By the afternoon, the cake's frosting had melted, and Emily blamed herself.crying in the hallway. She had never had cake before and thought it was her fault."


Patrick felt a pang of sympathy. When he was young, his father left a mountain of debt and ran away. Jennifer raised him and Karen with great difficulty, so he understood the feeling of being careful with everything.

"You like Emily, don't you?" Carol looked into Patrick's eyes.

Patrick looked down, blushing, and didn't answer.

"Sometimes, outsiders see things more clearly. Life is short, and some people, once they turn away, you might never see them again," Carol said, reminiscing about the past.

Carol said, "Young man, remember to follow your heart!"


Patrick was taken aback. He was rarely called a young man anymore.He was used to being called Mr. Rivera but had forgotten he was only in his early twenties.
Hearing a door open upstairs. Patrick excused himself.but it wasn't Emily's door. So, he returned to his car to wait for her.


Then he saw Emily and a young man getting out of a black car.heading home. Patrick gripped the steering wheel, a surge of jealousy and anger rising within him.

"Emily!" Patrick knew the car was Marlon's, buat in the dark.he couldn't see the man clearly. He assumed Emily was being overly friendly with Marlon. which made him furious.


Inside. Emily settled Gordon, turning on his favorite animal show.and went to the kitchen to cook. There weren't many ingredients. but she could make pasta. She remembered making pasta for Gordon when Lisa was away, standing on a stool because she was too short to reach the stove.


Soon, the delicious smell of pasta filled the apartment.

As Emily was about to bring the pasta out, she heard a faint noise.She looked into the living room and saw Gordon was no longer on the couch. Her heart raced as she put down the pasta and searched for him.


"Gordon, where are you?" Emily called out anxiously.


She found Gordon curled up behind the bedroom door. She rushed to him, tears streamning down her face, afraid of losing him again.


Gordon didn't struggle like he did in the storage room. Instead,he hugged Emily tightly.
"Don't be scared. Emily. I'll protect you!" Gordon said.


"That lady said bad people want to hurt you, behind the school in the storage room." Gordon said blankly.

"Which lady?" Emily asked carefully.

Gordon seemed to be thinking.

"The lady with the butterfly," Gordon said seriously.


Emily's face darkened. She remembered seeing a butterfly tattoo near Shirley's collarbone.

"Don't worry,Gordon. I'm fine now," Emily said.

After comforting Gordon, Emily brought the pasta and warm water to the bedroom. She watched as Gordon ate heartily, then changed him into clean clothes and gently put him to sleep.

Maybe it was the long day, but Gordon soon fell asleep.

Emily picked up the phone and called Marlon.

"Mr. Hughes, I really need your help this time," Emily said.

"Emily, you don't need to be so formal. Just tell me what you need,and call me Marlon," Marlon answered.


Emily paused, saying, "Marlon, Gordon's disappearance today wasn't just him wandering off."

"I thought so too. I reviewed the surveillance footage and found
something important. I'll bring my laptop over, and we can discuss it in person," Marlon said.

"Okay."

Emily sighed in reliefafter hanging up.

She went to the bedroom and looked at Gordon's sleeping face,filled with guilt and regret.


She knew Shirley was behind this, seeking revenge. Gordon got hurt because of her. She vowed to be more careful and protect him better.


In the car, Patrick frowned, thinking for a long time before deciding to confront Emily. He knocked on the door.


Emily,afraid of waking Gordon, quickly opened it. Seeing Patrick,she was stunned.


They stood in silence. Emily didn't know whether to thank him for helping Lisa or question him for believing Shirley without hearing her side.


"Is it inconvenient for me to come in?" Patrick asked.

"No, please come in," Emily said.

Emily stepped aside, and Patrick entered.

It was his second time here. The first time, he hadn't had a chance to look around.


Patrick glanced around. Though the apartment was the same size,
Emily's place felt more cramped, with a cheap sofa, old TV, faded sewing machine, and piles of fabric.


"Thank you for helping my mom! I'll pay you back, I promise!"Emily said.

"Pay me back? With what?" Patrick sneered.

Patrick looked around but didn't see Marlon, wondering if he had been mistaken.


Then he heard a faint snore from the bedroom and walked over.

Emily rushed to stop him.
###Chapter 18 Paying the Price

Emily stood her ground in front of the door, blocking Patrick's way.

Patrick sneered, "What's the deal, Emily? Got another guy?"

Emily's eyes blazed with anger. "That should be you! Ever since Shirley showed up, you've been a mess!"

Patrick frowned. "My business is none of your concern!"

Emily shot back, "Fine, then why are you still defending Shirley when you know what she did?"


Patrick said, "Emily, I'm telling you to let it go for your own good!Besides, Lisa is still in rehab..."


Any gratitude Emily had felt instantly vanished. So, he paid for Lisa's rehab just to control her, to use it as leverage. She had foolishly believed he genuinely wanted to help.

"Get out. I don't want to see you!" Emily pushed Patrick out the door.

Seeing Emily's resolute expression, Patrick said, "Fine, but don't regret this!"


Patrick turned and left. As he sped away in his car, he saw a black sports carapproaching from the opposite direction. The driver's seat revealed Marlon's chiseled face.


What was going on? Wasn't Marlon just in the bedroom? Could it be Emily's brother?
In the living room, Marlon pulled out his laptop and played the surveillance footage frame by frame. The fully armed figure seemed oddly familiar to him.

Marlon asked, "Emily, does this person look familiar to you?"

Noticing Emily was distracted, Marlon reached out and touched her forehead.


Emily snapped back to reality, saying, "What did you say?"

Marlon shook his head in exasperation and patiently repeated himself.

Emily clenched her fists, her eyes blazing with anger.

She said firmly, "It's Shirley!"

Marlon was taken aback and reviewed the footage again.

How did he not see it before?

Marlon quickly took a screenshot from the video and enlarged it.

Marlon said, "Don't worry, Emily. I will make sure Gordon gets justice!"

Emily said with a smile, "This time, I won't let her get away with it!"

Marlon nodded. "Whatever you want to do, I'm with you."

"Thank you!" Emily felt deeply grateful to Marlon. She owed him so much already.

Marlon said, "It's late. Tomorrow, I'll go with you to find Shirley."
Emily nodded.

Marlon packed up his things and left.


The next morning, sunlight streamed through the window, but Emily felt no warmth. Her heart was filled with anger and a thirst for revenge. She decided she couldn't be weak anymore; today, she would confront Shirley.


Marlon stood by her side, his gaze steady, ready to fight for her at any moment. He saw Emily's clenched fists and knew her anger had reached its peak. But he also understood that staying calm was crucial now; they couldn't let anger cloud their judgment.


They drove to Shirley's apartment. Emily took a deep breath and rang the doorbell.

The door slowly opened, and Shirley peeked out. Seeing Emily and Marlon, a flicker of surprise crossed her face, but she quickly regained her composure, a cold smile playing on her lips.

"What do you want?" Shirley asked, feigning calm.

"I told you, you will pay for what you've done!" Emily said, her voice steady.

"What are you going to do?" Shirley tried to sound confident, but her voice trembled, sensing the impending storm.


Emily didn't say a word. She stepped forward and shoved Shirley out the door. Shirley stumbled, almost falling, but Emily didn't stop. She kept pushing Shirley until she was cornered against the wall.
Marlon stood by, his expression stern. He didn't intervene because he knew Emily needed to vent. He waited silently, letting her release her anger.


"What did you do to my brother?" Emily's voice shook, each word forced through gritted teeth. Her eyes blazed with fury, as if she could burn Shirley to ashes.


Shirley's eyes widened in fear. Emily's rage was palpable, and she realized she might have truly angered these two. She tried to lie,"I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't do anything." But her voice grew weaker, even she didn't believe her own words.


Emily's anger flared even more. She grabbed Shirley's hair and yanked it back.


Shirley screamed in pain, but Emily didn't let go. She watched Shirley's pained expression without a hint of pity.


"Why are you still lying? My brother told me himself that you lured him into the storage room! How could you be so cruel?" Emily shouted, slamming Shirley's head against the wall with each word.Each impact deepened Shirley's pain and slightly eased Emily's anger.


Marlon watched, knowing Emily needed to vent but also aware this could go too far. He stepped forward and gently touched Emily's shoulder. "Emily, that's enough."


Emily stopped. She looked into Marlon's steady eyes, feeling a wave of warmth. She knew Marlon was always there for her, supporting her. She took a deep breath and let go.
Shirley slumped to the floor, her eyes filled with fear and despair.She looked at Emily and Marlon, knowing she was in deep trouble.She tried to get up and run, but Marlon blocked her path.

"Wait for it. The police will be here soon. Everything you've done will be punished by the law," Marlon said coldly. His voice was calm but carried undeniable authority.


Emily looked at Shirley's disheveled state, feeling a mix of anger.resentment, and a bit of satisfaction. She knew what she did might not be right, but she couldn't stand what Shirley had done to Gordon.

Emily turned to Marlon. "Let's go."

They walked away from Shirley's apartment.

Watching them leave, Shirley sneered, "I think the ones who will be punished first are you two."


Emily and Marlon walked down the quiet street, neither speaking.Emily's emotions gradually calmed, and she began to think about her next steps. She knew this incident might change her life's path, but she also understood she had to face all challenges and difficulties bravely to protect herself and her loved ones.


"Thank you, Marlon," Emily suddenly said. She looked at Marlon's determined eyes, feeling deeply grateful. She knew she couldn't have gotten through this without his support and companionship.


Marlon smiled slightly and gently patted Emily's hand. "It's okay,Emily. I'll always be here."
Emily hesitated for a second, then pulled her hand back.

Marlon didn't mind, looking at Emily with nothing but compassion.

They continued walking, their shadows stretching in the sunlight.
hinting at the long and challenging road ahead.
###Chapter 19 A Chilling Decision

Sunlight peeked through the curtains, casting a patchy glow on Emily's weary face. She lay sprawled on the big wooden bed. eyes squeezed shut, trying to soak up every bit of this rare peaceful moment.

Lately.her life had been one long, relentless nightmare. Between Lisa's and Gordon's health problems, the money troubles, Shirley's spiteful antics. and Patrick's lack of trust, it was all just too much.

Thank goodness for her neighbor Carol. who helped with Gordon,and Marlon's support. Without them, she might not have made it through.

Emily stared blankly at the ceiling, lost in thoughts about her future.

Suddenly,her phone rang, jolting her out of her reverie. She grabbed it and saw it was HR from her company. Her heart skipped a beat,dreading more bad news.


Taking a deep breath, Emily answered the call.

"Hey, Emily. Just a heads-up, your leave is almost over. You need to come back to work tomorrow," the voice on the other end said.


"Okay, I'll be at the Canyon Ridge project team on time tomorrow,"Emily replied.

"Actually, not the project team. You're coming back to the main office,
"the voice corrected.

"What?" Emily was confused.
"Yeah, Mr. Rivera just issued the notice and specifically asked me to call and remind you," the voice explained.

Emily thought. 'Patrick, what are you up to now?

"Emily, you there?" the voice asked.

"Yeah. I got it," Emily said, snapping back to reality.

Hanging up, Emily felt a swirl of emotions. She had no idea what Patrick's intentions were in calling her back to the main office.Was he going to explain things, or was she about to get fired?

But she knew it was time to face Patrick and settle things.

She quickly freshened up and picked up Gordon from Carol's place.In the afternoon, she took him shopping for some new clothes and then drove him back to his special school, where he could get the education and treatment he needed.


The school staff were very welcoming when they saw Emily bringing Gordon back. After the last incident with Gordon, the school had held several meetings to address safety issues, and the responsible teachers had written formal apologies.


"Thank you for your trust. Rest assured, I will take good care of Gordon!" Gordon's teacher said as he shook Emily's hand.


Emily patted Gordon's head. "Gordon, be good. I'll come to pick you up this weekend! Remember, don't go with anyone else except me,okay?"
Gordon nodded, somewhat understanding, and followed his teacher back to the classroom.


Emily left. looking back several times. By the time she returned to Lisa's place,it was already dark.


She knew she had to start preparing. Both Lisa and Gordon needed more money, and since she had decided to leave, she had to plan ahead.


The next day, Emily returned to the main office, only to find the atmosphere a bit off.


"Did you hear? Emily's hooked up with the CEO of the Hughes Group."


"No wonder she can go to the Canyon Ridge project whenever she wants and come back whenever she pleases. She's got connections!"

"That's not all. I heard Mr. Rivera caught her and Mr. Hughes in bed together!"

"Oh my God, that's scandalous! Mr. Rivera must have been furious!"

"He was probably relieved to get rid of her. She was the one who seduced him in the first place!"

Her colleagues whispered among themselves.

"How do you know I'm not the one who's relieved?" Emily said,startling the most talkative one by tapping their shoulder.

"Emily, Mr. Rivera wants to see you!" Iris from HR called out,giving
the gossiping colleagues a stern look.

"Don't you all have work to do?" Iris snapped.

The gossiping colleagues reluctantly dispersed.

Emily took a deep breath, trying to stay calm, and walked confidently into Patrick's office.


Holding her resignation letter tightly, Emily felt conflicted.She knew that once she handed it in, it would mean the end of her complicated relationship with Patrick and the start of new challenges.


But she was determined. She knew that only by breaking free could she truly start over.


Emily placed the resignation letter on Patrick's desk and turned to leave.


Patrick said, "Emily, did I say you could leave? Sit down!"

Emily stopped, standing straight in front of Patrick, but did not sit.

They stared at each other in silence, the only sound being the ticking of the clock.


Patrick opened the resignation letter, reading it carefully.

Emily glanced at Patrick occasionally, noticing the glass figurine on the shelf behind him.


That figurine was from the first event she attended with Patrick.Back then, she was so nervous that she didn't dare accept the gift
from the organizers until Patrick signaled her to.

She had chosen a small glass rabbit with a crooked ear, which Patrick had teased her about all day. Embarrassed. she had left it behind. but later found it on Patrick's shelf.


Remembering those moments. Emily felt a mix of emotions. Patrick made her heart flutter was now the source of her deepest pain.


His distrust. coldness, and domineering attitude had left her exhausted and hopeless.

She had wanted to explain herself to him, to ask what she meant to him, but every time, she swallowed her words,afraid of his answer.

"Mr. Rivera, I want to resign," Emily repeated.

Patrick was silent for a moment.

"Emily, are you sure? This is your last chance," Patrick's voice trembled slightly, whether from anger or reluctance.

Emily said firmly, "Yes, I'll repay the money for my mother as soon as possible."

"Repay? How?" Patrick scoffed.


He added, "You can resign if you complete this project. The money for your mother was my gift, not a loan."


'A gift? ' Emily thought bitterly. Whether it was a leverage or genuine help, it was Patrick who had convinced Lisa to open up.
Patrick. Ill help you one last time.' Emily thought.

Patrick slammed a folder on the desk in front of her.

Emily frowned. quickly scanning the contents. It was an almost impossible task.

"Scared? Then take back your resignation letter, and I'll pretend I didn't see it." Patrick said, watching her reaction closely.

"Mr. Rivera, you said if I complete the project, you'll let me go. I hope you'll keep your word," Emily said firmly.
###Chapter 20 The Dawn of Victory

Emily clutched the documents tightly as she left the CEO's office. her steps echoing her determination and courage.


Patrick watched her go, stunned. He hadn't expected her to take on the impossible task so decisively.


"Emily, are you really that eager to leave me?" Patrick's hand slammed down on the desk, his voice filled with frustration and anger. But Emily was already gone,too far to hear his words.


Outside the CEO's office, Emily glanced at what used to be her private secretary's office. It had once been her workspace, a place of hard work and ambition, but now it was empty and silent. Shirley had taken sick leave, leaving the office feeling particularly desolate.Emily couldn't help but feel a wave of nostalgia.

Just then, Iris approached her.

"Emily, Mr. Rivera has arranged for you to work in the small office next to the conference room for now," Iris said politely, with a hint of respect. She wanted the other colleagues to know that even if Emily wasn't favored, she still had the CEO's direct arrangement and a designated workspace,beyond their judgment.

Emily nodded in thanks and entered the small office. Though it wasn't large, it was well-equipped and sufficient for her to focus on her work.


She set down the documents and immediately dove into the demanding project. She knew time was of the essence and she had to
push forward relentlessly.

In the following days, Emily poured all her energy into the project.She understood that this project would determine whether she could leave, so she didn't dare slack off for a moment.


Every day, she arrived at the office early to start her work. She reviewed a vast amount of material. from academic papers to the latest industry developments, trying to find clues to breakthrough the key technologies. However, the project's difficulty far exceeded her expectations. What seemed like simple technical issues were actually complex mathematical operations and profound algorithm principles.

Despite her solid background in artificial intelligence from college.Emily still felt overwhelmed by these challenges.

With Patrick having disbanded the company's AI team, Emily was left to tackle the project alone, making it even more strenuous.

Late at night. Emily often found herself wworking alone in the office.

One afternoon, as her colleagues gradually left, Emily sat in her office,staring at the code and data on her computer screen, deep in thought.

She tried various possible solutions, but each attempt ended in failure,leaving her feeling incrediblyfrustrated and exhausted.


Whenever she felt like giving up, she would remember Patrick's cold face and his doubts about her abilities. These memories acted as an invisible force, driving her to keep going.
Just as she was intensely focused on her work, the phone rang. Emily glanced at the caller ID.hesitated for a moment. and then answered.


"Emily,do you have time to grab dinner tonight?" Marlon's gentle voice came through the line.


"No, I still have some work to finish here." Emily replied. her throat a bit hoarse from not having had a sip of water all afternoon.


Marlon said. "Don't be so quick to turn me down. I heard you're working on the TX1 new intelligent system project. right?"

"Yeah, how did you know?" Emily asked, surprised.

Marlon said, "This is a secret. But seriously, this project is a huge undertaking. You're in for a tough time."

"I know, I'm already struggling with it," Emily admitted.

Marlon said, "Don't worry. I set up a meeting with Dr. David Garcia from the National Intelligent Systems Research Group. He's an expert in this field and might have some useful advrice. You can discuss it over dinner."


Emily felt a surge of gratitude. "Really? That would be amazing!Thank you."


"I'm downstairs at your office. Pack up and come down quickly,"Marlon said warmly.

"Okay!" Emily grabbed her bag and hurried downstairs.

When Marlon saw Emily, her hair slightly disheveled and dark
circles under her eyes, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy.

In his office, Patrick stood by the window, watching Marlon and Emily below. For some reason, he felt a sharp pain in his heart.

Patrick's phone rang, displaying David's number.

David said, "Hello, Mr. Rivera. As per your instructions. I deliberately let the Hughes Group know about my schedule. Their CEO has already arranged dinner with me tonight. What should I do next?"


David was actually one of the people Patrick intended to hire for the project, though it hadn't been announced yet. They had known each other from their time abroad, and David had once been bested by Patrick in the field of AI. But times had changed, and Patrick had moved on from his research.


When Patrick instructed David to leak the information, David thought it was to steal trade secrets, feeling conflicted yet excited about the espionage.


"Answer their questions honestly and offer help if needed," Patrick said calmly.

Though he had set up this project to challenge Emily, he didn't want her to leave the company. He knew that if she left, it would mean the end of any possibility between them. But seeing her work tirelessly, looking so worn out, he couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt.

David found it hard to believe. Was the domestic market really this harmonious now?
Emily and Marlon had just sat down when David arrived at the restaurant.


David. a middle-aged man with a modest appearance, had eyes that revealed depth and wisdom.


Emily and Marlon stood to greet him, and the three of them sat down together.


At the table. Emily detailed the project's background and challenges to David. After listening. David fell into deep thought.

"The TX1 new intelligent system project presents a challenge. but it is certainly solvable. The key lies in finding a new algorithm to optimize the system's performance." David said.

Emily's eyes lit up. "A new algorithm? Can you elaborate?"

David nodded and began explaining his idea in detail.

He proposed a new algorithm based on deep learning, which could automatically optimize the system's performance through extensive data training and learning.


Emily found his explanation very reasonable and decided to try the algorithm as soon as she returned.

During the meal, the three of them discussed many topics related to artificial intelligence and intelligent systems.


Emily learned a lot of new knowledge and perspectives from David and Marlon's conversation.
She sensed a significant expansion in her perspective and thought.

David also offered his contact information, indicating his willingness to help in the future.


Emily felt a surge of gratitude and anticipation. With David's help,she might be able to find the breakthrough she needed to complete the project.

"Thank you so much!" Emily raised her glass.

David humbly waved his hand. "If you want to thank someone,thank Patri... I mean, Mr. Hughes!"

Emily turned to Marlon and smiled.

The three of them clinked glasses, chatting and laughing as they ended the meal on a pleasant note.
###Chapter 21 The Sudden Turmoil

The three of them left the hotel, and Marlon said, "Hey Emily, how about I give you a ride home?"

Emily checked her watch.

"Thanks, Marlon, but no need. Could you take Dr. Garcia instead? I gotta head back to the office," Emily replied.

Marlon saw she was set on her decision and didn't push it.

"Alright, just be careful on your way back!" he said.

"Don't worry, I will!" Emily smiled.

Marlon had picked this hotel because it was close to the Rivera Group,even though it was a bit hidden.


Back at the office, Emily was eager to dive into the new algorithm David had suggested. She worked tirelessly, tweaking and optimizing the code.


After days of relentless effort, she finally got the initial functionality of the algorithm working. This small victory filled her with excitement and pride.


But she knew this was just the beginning. There was still a lot of work to be done. She realized she had found a key breakthrough and that with continued effort, she could complete the project.

Emily glanced at her phone; it was already past 4 AM.
Exhausted, she fell asleep at her desk.

The ringing of her phone woke her up. Groggily, she reached for it.not noticing her gray jacket slipping off her shoulders.


"Hello, Ms. Thompson, this is the police. We've received a report accusing you of intentional harm. Please come to the station to assist with our investigation," said the voice on the other end.


Emily was stunned. Still half-asleep, she had no idea what was going on.


She tried to keep her voice steady. "I don't understand. I've never intentionally harmed anyone."


But the officer didn't give her a chance to explain, simply repeating the request for her to come to the station.

Emily hung up, filled with confusion and anxiety.

She tried to recall her recent actions. She hadn't done anything that could have hurt anyone-except for Shirley!


This unexpected situation put her in a bind. If shedidn't cooperate with the police, her reputation and future were at risk. But if she went to the station and couldn't prove her innocence, the consequences could be worse. After all, she had been quite emotional that day.


Emily felt a headache coming on. She didn't know how to handle this. She decided to consult a lawyer she knew to see what she should do.
After hearing Emily's account, the lawyeradvised her to cooperate with the police but to stay calm and rational, and not to admit to any accusations lightly.


The lawyer also suggested seeking reconciliation with the other party.Reconciliation? The thought of Shirley made Emily shake her head.


But with no better options, Emily sighed and followed the lawyer's advice, heading to the police station.


At the station, she answered the officers'questions and explained her recent actions and whereabouts in detail. The police didn't immediately believe her and said they needed to investigate further.


Since Shirley hadn't provided any medical evidence of injury, and there was no premeditation or deliberate harm, it couldn't be classified as intentional harm. At most, it was a case of fighting. But Shirley refused to reconcile, making the situation more complicated.

In the following days, Emily's life was thrown into chaos.

She had to deal with the police investigation, as well as questions and doubts from her company and society.


Most importantly, the project was at a critical stage. If the new algorithm couldn't support the project's operations,it would fail.

Emily felt an unprecedented sense of loneliness and helplessness. She didn't know if she could get through this or what her fuature held.


But she knew she couldn't give up. She had to keep going. To get Shirley to back down, she had to act first.
So,she handed over evidence to the police showing that Shirley had led Gordon into the storage room and locked him in.


Although she submitted the evidence, the police said they needed to investigate further, leaving her both hopeful and anxious.


Back at the office, Emily tried to stay calm. She knew that any panic could make things worse.

"Come in," Patrick said to Emily in a low voice.

"What's up?" Emily asked, pretending not to know.

"What did you do to Shirley?" Patrick demanded.

Emily sneered. "Why don't you ask what she did to me?"

Patrick didn't look at Emily, remaining silent.

"You were wronged last time. Don't hold it against Shirley," Patrick tried to soothe Emily.


Emily said, "Shirley drugged me with an aphrodisiac and locked my autistic brother in a dark storage room!"


"Autistic?" Patrick frowned.

Emily said, "Do you know how terrifying and desperate it is for an autistic person to be alone in a dark place?"

"What do you mean?" Patrick asked, puzzled.

"All these years, you didn't even know my brother has autism!"
Emily sneered. "He's the person I want to protect the most, and Shirley keeps crossing the line! What would you do?"


Patrick didn't respond. He understood Emily too well. Family was his bottom line too.


But he also knew Shirley's vengeful nature. Once, when a kid in the neighborhood tried to take her doll, she cut it up with scissors rather than let anyone else touch it. If Emily crossed her, she would get hurt in the end.


"I'll have her apologize to you, and the company will issue a statement to clarify the facts. Just don't be stubborn," Patrick said softly.


Emily looked at Patrick, disappointment flashing in her eyes. She had thought that despite the distance between them, Patrick would at least understand and support her in critical moments. But his words made her feel more isolated than ever.


"Mr. Rivera, this isn't something an apology can fix," Emily said firmly, "Shirley's actions have crossed my bottom line and hurt the person closest to me. I need a fair judgment, not a apology."


She had thought that even if they weren't lovers, she held some place in Patrick's heart. But now, Emily realized how foolish she had been.


Patrick saw the determination in Emily's eyes and knew he couldn't persuade her to change her mind. He sighed and said, "Alright,I'll handle this as best as I can. But promise me you won't act impulsively."
Emily remained silent and left the CEO's office with a heavy heart.She no longer had any illusions about Patrick.


She knew that in this battle with Shirley, she could only rely on herself. She had to force herself to become stronger and braver.


Emily began collecting evidence of Shirley's misconduct at work.including abusing her power for personal gain and maliciously targeting colleagues. She knew this wouldn't bring Shirley down,but it would keep her busy.

Her phone rang. It was Marlon.

Marlon said into the phone, "Emnily, guess what big news I found!"
###Chapter 22 This Is Just a Warning

Marlon was on the other end of the line,practically buzzing with excitement.


But Emily, who had just walked out of Patrick's office, couldn't care less. All she wanted was to finish the project and get the hell out of the Rivera Group. What used to be a place of dreams had turned into her suffocating cage.


"Marlon, I'm really beat today. Can we talk about this tomorrow?"Emily cut himn off without hesitation.

There was a brief silence on the other end.

"Alright, get some rest. Call me back when you're feeling better!"Marlon finally said.

"Okay," Emily replied.

She hung up and slumped into her office chair, looking utterly exhausted.


What should she do next?

Leaving the Rivera Group, where would she go?

Before she could think further, her phone rang again.

She glanced at the screen; it was a call from the rehab center where her mom was staying.

"Hello, is this Lisa's famnily member?"
"Yes, I'm her daughter." Emily said, her voice uneasy.

"We found contraband among your mother's visitation items. We need you to come over as soon as possible to help us understand the situation," the voice on the other end was calm and serious.


Emily's heart sank. Contraband? Her mom had voluntarily decided to go to rehab this time, so how could this happen? But she didn't have time to think it over. She grabbed her coat and was ready to drive to the rehab center.


Before she could leave, Shirley barged into her office, blocking her way.

"Emily, it's been so long! Did you miss me?" Shirley said smugly.

Emily had no patience to deal witha Shirley right now.

"Didn't you learn your lesson last time? Or do you need another reminder?" Emily said calmly,frowning.


"Emily, how can you talk like that! Looks like the police didn't teach you well enough, you arrogant bitch." Shirley glared at Emily.

"Not pretending anymore? I have something urgent to do today,no time to watch your performance!" Emily tried to leave.


"Don't be in such a hurry, Emily. Don't you want to know what happened while you were on leave?"

Before Emily could respond, Shirley continued.

"The HR department already approached me. The board thinks I've
been doing well lately and plans to make me the head of the secretarial team!" Shirley said proudly. "I have to thank Patrick.Without his personal guidance day and night, I wouldn't have made it!"


Emily frowned and gave a wry smile.

The Rivera Group was a well-known company nationwide, with strict hiring standards in recent years. Even graduates from prestigious schools needed to have completed their own projects to get an interview. But Shirley, a graduate from Evergreen University, a second-rate college, had no projects, no interview, and got into the company directly. And now she was up for a promotion? Not to mention what Patrick was thinking, how could the board members...

Though Emily found it unbelievable, considering Patrick's favoritism towards Shirley, it seemed like something he would do.

"So what? What does that have to do with me?" Emily said calmly.

"Emily, you're so hypocritical! You always looked down on me."Shirley stepped closer to Emily.


"Don't be so self-righteous. We're actually the same kind of people,"Shirley whispered maliciously. "I know how you became the team leader! Just by sleeping with men!"

Emily stayed silent, her face calm.


"Too bad, Patrick only has eyes for me, and you're just a tool. He'll use you when he needs you and toss you aside wvhen he doesn't."
Emily had no time for this. She needed to get to the rehab center and didn't want to delay any further.

Shirley turned and blocked the office door.

"Emily, your brother's incident last time was too light. I wonder if my gift to Lisa has been received?" Shirley's smile was sinister.

Emily's face changed.

"Did you put the contraband in my mom's visitation items?"

Emily took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.

"What? Got caught? What a pity, I wanted Lisa to have a good taste!"

Shirley stepped closer, taunting Emily, "I love seeing you in pain.But if you dare to do anything to me, Patrick won't let you off!"


Mentioning Patrick, a flash of pain crossed Emily's eyes. Given everything that had happened, she couldn't help but believe Shirley might be telling the truth.


"Shirley, just remember, this is the last time I'm putting up with you!"Emily said,gritting her teeth, her voice firm.


"Oh, I have a bad memory! Whether there's a next time depends on your behavior," Shirley said nonchalantly.

Emily gave a cold laugh and turned to leave.

Shirley quickly caught up and blocked Emily's way again.
"The show hasn't started yet, you can't leave!" Shirley said word by word.


Before Emily could react, Shirley pushed her hard. Emily instinctively grabbed Shirley, who stumbled back and knocked over a standing rack by the door.

The loud noise drew the attention of the people in the meeting room.

Patrick frowned, and the vice president, Steven Harris, hurried out to check.


He saw the fallen rack, Shirley on the floor, and Emily standing there in shock.


"Mr. Harris," Shirley cried even louder upon seeing Steven.

Steven, as the company's vice president, had seen all kinds of situations. He knew this was typical drama. But knowing Shirley's relationship with Patrick, he knew this could get complicated.


As Steven was thinking about how to report this to Mr. Rivera,Patrick appeared in the hallway.


Seeing Shirley on the floor next to the wooden rack, Patrick rushed over, "Are you hurt?"

Shirley cried pitifully, "Patrick, I think I upset Emily, and she..."

"What did I do?" Emily snapped back.


Shirley pretended to be scared and clung to Patrick. He gently stroked her face, "Shirley, don't be afraid, it's okay now."
Then he turned to Emily, his face dark,"Look at what you've done!"

Emily had no interest in explaining to Patrick or watching Shirley's performance. She just wanted to get to the rehab center as soon as possible.


"She fell on her own. If you don't believe me, Mr. Rivera, you can check the surveillance footage." Emily walked out.


"Emily,how dare you talk to me like that..." Patrick started to stop her, but Shirley grabbed his sleeve.

Emily ignored Patrick's shouts and left.

She had more important things to do now.

Patrick, furious, wanted to chase after her, but a weak voice beside
him said, "Patrick, my foot hurts, I can't walk!"

Patrick looked at Emily disappearing down the hallway, feeling a sense of loss.
###Chapter 23 Bring Patrick with You

"Hey Steven, can you take Shirley to the medical office?" Patrick shot Steven a knowing look before walking off.


Shirley barely had time to process what was happening before Patrick vanished from sight.

Steven awkwardly maneuvered around the equipment stand and approached the fragile-looking Shirley, unsure of how to help.Despite being in his forties, he was still single, having devoted his youth to research. This dedication had made him the youngest board member at the Rivera Group, second only to Patrick.


Now, he crouched in front of Shirley, his back straight and his expression tense, unsure how to help her up.

"No need. I'm fine now!" Shirley started to get up but,seeing her colleagues watching, changed her mind. If they realized her foot wasn't hurt, it could be problematic, especially since Patrick hated being deceived. Plus, Steven, being a high-ranking executive, could be beneficial for her future.


So, Shirley pretended to lose her balance and fell to the side with a dramatic gasp. Steven quickly caught her.

Steven's heart raced. He had seen many workplace power plays, but experiencing one firsthand left him flustered. He took a deep breath to calm himself and suggested, "Ms. Wright, how about I carry you on my back?"

Reluctantly, Shirley climbed onto his back, wrapping her arms tightly
around his neck. The warmth and softness of her body made Steven's heart flutter.


"Mr. Harris, be careful," she said in a playful tone, making Steven even more uneasy.


"Got it,"' he replied, standing up cautiously and heading towards the medical office.


In the hallway, colleagues cast curious glances and whispered among themselves:


"What's Shirley's deal? Even Steven is flustered. You know, he never shows emotion."


"Watch what you say. Shirley's Mr. Harris's woman. You don't want to get fired,right?"

"I'm just jealous!"

Steven caught those comments and felt a bit uneasy, but he kept his cool on the outside. He walked steadily, making sure Shirley felt comfortable.


"Mr. Harris, don't listen to their nonsense. It's all Mr. Rivera's fault for treating me so well. We're not even that close yet," Shirley said,feigning shyness and nuzzling her face against Steven's back.


Steven felt a surge of heat and unconsciously tightened his grip on her.


Meanwhile, Emily hurried to the rehab center. After learning the
details, she calmed down, took a deep breath, and entered the reception room.

"Miss, these are your mother's visitation items. During inspection,we found a bottle containing gamma-hydroxybutyrate." the staff member said sternly.


"Gamma-hydroxybutyrate?" Emily asked, puzzled, examining the seemingly ordinary handmade juice bottle.


Seeing her confusion, the staff member explained patiently, "It's a central nervous system depressant, often used as an anesthetic or hallucinogen. It's colorless and tasteless, and can cause drowsiness,dizziness, or even unconsciousness, posing a serious risk."

Emily was horrified. If her mother had consumed the drink,the consequences would have been dire.

"Can I see the test report?" Emily asked, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside.


Determined to gather evidence against Shirley, she knew she had to stay calm and focused.


"Of course," the staff member said, handing her the report. Emily read it carefully, her expression resolute.


"Thank you for catching this and handling it professionally. Is there any chance the bottle has fingerprints or other traceable evidence?"she asked.


The staff member thought for a moment before replying,′′I's possible,
but the bottle has been handled by many people, so the evidence might be compromised. We'll do our best."


Though disappointed, Emily didn't lose hope. "Can I get a copy of the test report?" she asked firmly.


Knowing that evidence was crucial to proving Shirley's involvement.she needed the report, even if it couldn't directly incriminate her.

The staff member nodded and quickly made a copy for her.

"I'd like to request the surveillance footage from today," Emily said decisively.

With her mother's safety at stake, she had to pursue every lead.

"Sorry, the footage has been sent to a third-party tech company.We're also eager to find the culprit, so please be patient," the staff member responded sincerely.


Emily had no choice but to wait. "Can I see my mom?" she asked,filled with longing.


Though the rehab center wasn't a mandatory facility, visitation rules were strict.


The staff member made a quick calI and soon returned, saying, "You can. I'll take you to the visiting room."


In the visiting room, Emily finally saw her mother. After months apart, Lisa looked frailer, with more gray hair. Emily's heart ached.

She had so much to say but couldn't find the words.
Lisa gently tucked Emily's loose hair behind her ear, full of guilt. "My dear Emily, you've lost weight again. It's my fault for not being able to take care of you and your brother."


Emily's eyes filled with tears as she thought about everything that had happened recently.


"Why are you crying? Did Patrick do something to you?" Lisa asked angrily.


Emily shook her head. She didn't know what Patrick had told her mother, but under her gentle concern, she felt even more wronged and couldn't speak.


"Don't worry. When I get out, I'll confront him! If he dares to hurt you, I'll fight him to the end."

"No... he didn't hurt me," Emily denied quickly, not wanting her mother to worry.

Lisa said, "That's good. As long as you two are okay, I'm relieved."

"Yeah," Emily replied softly, avoiding her mother's eyes.

"Are you sure nothing's wrong between you two?" Lisa asked,sensing something was off.

"No..." Emily mumbled.


"Alright, next time you visit, bring Patrick with you," Lisa said, her eyes full of hope. Emily could only nod.

Leaving the rehab center, Emily headed straight to her apartment in
the city. Downstairs. Marlon was waiting for her.
###Chapter 24 Breaking the Deadlock

"Sorry. Marlon. I'm just too wiped out todlay."

Emily looked at Marlon with a guilty expression.

Marlon gazed at Emily's red, tear-streaked eyes, feeling a deep ache in his heart.


"If you're this tired, why stay at the Rivera Group? Come work for me at the Hughes Group. We will always welcome you!" Marlon said gently.


"Actually, I've already submitted my resignation, but I can't leave just yet."

"Why not?" Marlon asked, puzzled.

"Because I need to finish this project first!" Emily shook her head helplessly.

Marlon was silent for a moment, understanding that Patrick was likely making things difficult on purpose. The project was highly challenging, even for a team of seasoned experts.

"How about I talk to Patrick?"

"No need!" Emily blurted out, picturing Patrick's grim face and the scene of them arguing over her. She shook her head repeatedly.

Seeing Marlon's low spirits, Emily changed the subject.

"Did you come to see me for something important?" Emily looked at
him curiously.

"Yeah. I almost forgot! It's too crowded here. Can we talk somewhere else?" Marlon said seriously.

"Sure."

After a brief thought, Emnily led Marlon to a nearby café. Marlon had hoped to chat at her place, feeling a bit disappointed but understanding Emily's caution.

Sitting in a corner of the café, Marlon handed over some documents.

"I had a friend abroad dig up some information on Shirley. You'll be shocked when you see this!"


Marlon said confidently. Shirley had hurt Emily multiple times, and he couldn't stand it any longer.

Emily took the documents, puzzled, as Marlon continued:

"She claims to be an executive at MD Company,but she only interned there for a few months. She also said she graduated from Evergreen University, there's no record of her. She likely dropped out."


Emily was genuinely surprised. That school was known for being lenient-you could get a diploma just by paying and meeting attendance requirements. The fact that she couldn't even manage that was truly unexpected.


"Moreover," Marlon lowered his voice,'"My friend found records at a black-market clinic abroad. She had an abortion."
Emily's hand trembled slightly. "Is that true?"


Marlon nodded firmly.′′Iconfirmed it. It's absolutely true."

Emily imagined Patrick's reaction to the news and found it amusing.

"If it were you, would you like a girl like that?" Emily asked casually while flipping through the documents.

Marlon nearly spat out his coffee."Of course not! I'd stay far away!"Marlon said emphatically.

"What if you didn't know at first?" Emily pressed.

"Still no. She's not my type!" Marlon responded sincerely.

Seeing his nervousness, Emily almost laughed, feeling relieved that not all men were as clueless as Patrick.


"Please don't tell Patrick about this yet!"

Emily knew the timing wasn't right. She needed to wait for the perfect moment to shut Shirley up.


"Do you mind if I keep these documents for now?" Emily asked tentatively.

"Of course not." Marlon handed over the document folder.

Lately, Marlon couldn't help but admire Emily's dedication to her work. But every time he tried to get closer, she pulled away. Oh well,he thought, let things take their course.
By the time they left the café, it was already late.

Emily thanked Marlon and walked into her place without looking back.


Marlon stayed in his car, watching until her lights turned on before reluctantly driving away.


Maybe it was Marlon's bombshell news, but Emily had her first good night's sleep in days.

Stretching, she checked her phone. It was past eight.

Emily quickly ate, washed up, did her makeup, and grabbed her document bag before driving to the office.


Her office was next to the conference room,so she rarely saw her colleagues, avoiding much gossip.


In a good mood, Emily had just sat down to dive into the project when she received a call from the rehab center with good news: "Hello, Miss. We retrieved the surveillance video. It confirms that the person who delivered something to your mother was a petite woman in sportswear. The video has been handed over to the police, and they'll find her soon," the staff member said excitedly.

"Got it. Thank you!" Emily's lips curled into a meaningful smile.

Just as she hung up, Shirley walked in.

"Do you need something?" Emily asked deliberately,hoping she'd walk into a trap.
"Can't I just drop by? Emily, everything here belongs to the Rivera Group!" Shirley said as she rifled through the papers on the desk.scattering them everywhere. "Are you here to pick a fight?"


Emily leaned in and whispered. "You better pray my mom and brother are safe. or I can't guarantee when the police will come for you!"

"Emily. I'm so scared!" Shirley taunted, showing no concern.

"You're really ignorant! Inciting, coercing. or deceiving someone into drug use is a crime. you know?" Emily said firmly.

"I didn't. What can you do to me?"

"Not much, except I have a video on my phone. The visitor looks a lot like you. Want to see?" Emily said disdainfully.

"I didn't do it. Your mom asked me to bring it! I was just the courier."Shirley stammered.


"Smuggling. selling, transporting, or manufacturing ddrugs are all punishable offenses. You're too naive."

Shirley fell silent. head down.

"What? Scared already? Take a look at this!" Emily laid Marlon's investigation report in front of her.

Shirley opened it in disbelief, her hands trembling even more.

"If you don't want Patrick to know about your abortion,you'd better behave yourself," Emily said with a hint of threat.
Shirley said, "Fine, no problem! Just remember what you said today."

Emily replied. "You don't have the right to negotiate with me yet."

Emily savored the satisfaction of delivering a harsh warning.

Shirley, who had come to see Emily embarrassed, left in a huff.feeling cornered.


Emily added, "Oh, by the way, I told Mr. Rivera that once the project is done. I'm resigning. So, if you have nothing else, just wish for the project's speedy completion."

"Really?" Shirley turned, full of doubt.

Emily said, "Yes."
###Chapter 25 Reckless

Without Shirley stirring up trouble, Emily dove headfirst into the project, excited to wrap it up and make a grand exit from the Rivera Group.Just thinking about it made her grin.


The project soon hit the testing phase, and Emily was pumped,feeling like freedom was just around the corner. But there was a tiny bit of hesitation in her heart.


Then,out of nowhere, a bug popped up during testing, making Emily scowl. She tried debugging over andI over but got nowhere.Frustrated, she called David, "Hey. Dr. Garcia, got a sec? There's a problem with the projecttest, and I need your help." Her voice was respectful but urgent.

"Well, I'm at the Southern Research Center right now and won't be back for a week. How about we talk when I get back?" David replied.

Emily couldn't wait that long and quickly asked, "Dr. Garcia,can you help me over the phone?" For her, even a few days felt like forever right now"


After Emily explained the problem briefly, David paused. The issue was tough, but Mr. Rivera had told him to help, so he couldn't say no."Alright, Emily, I know a tech expert who just got back to the country. I'll try to set up a meeting for you."

"That would be awesome!" Emily couldn't hide her excitement.

Soon, David sent over the business card of Andrew Anderson, the Deputy Director of ELE Artificial Intelligence Institute. That
afternoon. Andrew agreed to help. Emily quickly sent over the details of the issue and soon got a reply.

Andrew: [Hi, Emily, I've looked over your problem. If you have time,bring the relevant materials to my office, and I can help you in person.]

Emily: [Thank you so much.]

Andrew: [I'm at the Synergy Research Center.You can find me here.]

Emily: [Thanks, Mr. Anderson!]

Emily quickly packed her things and headed out.

As she drove further out, Emily felt a bit uneasy but reminded herself that research centers were often in remote areas to avoid disturbances.


Soon,she met Andrew and his assistant. The assistant, in her twenties,had a striking figure even in a loose lab coat. Andrew, in his fifties,had thinning hair, pale skin behind large black-rimmed glasses,and a fit physique.

Andrew looked at Emily sternly, frowning. She instinctively looked down, feeling self-conscious in her form-fitting work clothes. Andrew quickly looked away and took her laptop. Emily stood politely by the desk, watching as he replaced the code.


Emily felt uneasy; her original setup seemed fine, and this change could mess things up. "If we follow the usual programming setup here, it will definitely cause issues during later testing," she said softly,
leaning in closer, making her curves more noticeable.

Emily didn't notice the assistant's unfriendly gaze beside her.

"Alright, Emily, you can start testing again," Andrew said with a smile. She marveled at his skill, solving in minutes what she couldn't in hours. She quickly sat down, focused on testing, her fingers flying over the keyboard, oblivious to the unfriendly gaze behind her.


Andrew stood behind her, a cold smile on his lips, his eyes filled with greedy desire, roaming over her body, finally resting on her chest. He slowly reached out his right hand, pressing down on Emily's hand on the keyboard. She instinctively tried to pull away but was held tightly.


At the same time, Andrew's other hand wrapped around her shoulder,trapping her in the chair. Emily struggled in fear, "What are you doing?" Her voice trembled, unable to believe this seemingly respectable director could be so shameless. Disgust and anger surged within her as she fought with all her might, but Andrew's strength was overwhelming.


Andrew's face inched closer, his hands brazenly reaching for her bra."Aren't you afraid of making headlines tomorrow?" Emily tried to stay calm.


Andrew sneered, "Headlines? Who's going to report it? Me? You?"Emily looked at the assistant. Andrew called out dismissively, "Echo,come here!" The assistant immediately approached, kneeling before him.
"I want you, now!" Andrew ordered. The assistant, expressionless.quickly undressed, revealing bruised breasts and a flat stomach.Emily was shocked to see the assistant wasn't wearing underwear.clearly ready for Andrew whenever he wanted.

Meanwhile, in the Rivera Group's CEO office.


"Mr. Rivera, here are the top technical experts we plan to hire. Please review." Patrick took the list, his eyes landing on Andrew's profile.He had heard of Andrew's top-notch skills but also knew of his poor personal conduct and numerous sexual harassment allegations.

The new secretary,seeing Patrick's interest, explained, "Mr. Rivera.Andrew graduated from the prestigious Ivy League and is now the Deputy Director of ELE Artificial Intelligence Institute.He has expressed interest in collaborating with our company."

"Is this all the information we have on him?" Patrick frowned.


Shirley,passing by,saw the secretary's awkwardness and, wanting to assert herself. walked in. "Patrick, I'm familiar with him too. Despite some past harassment allegations, his skills in AI are top-tier. If he joins us, it would be a huge asset."


Patrick looked at Shirley, puzzled. Firmly, he said, "Shirley, remember,our company will not, now or ever, hire someone like him!"
###Chapter 26 The Top Expert

Patrick hadn't seen Emily all day. which made him suspicious.Normally, she was always on top of things and should have been in the office by now.


"Why hasn't Emily shown up today? Is she planning to skip work?"Patrick asked HR casually.


"No. Emily came in early this morning. She mentioned there was an issue with the project and needed external help, so she took a leave,"Iris quickly explained.


"Alright," Patrick replied, a bit impatient. She left in such a hurry to complete the project without even informing him. "How bod!"Patrick muttered with a helpless smile, then went back to his office and called David.


"Mr. Rivera, you actually remembered me! What a rare occasion!"David joked.


"Cut the crap. Has Marlon contacted you recently?" Patrick asked,trying to be subtle.


"Oh,you're asking about Mr. Hughes? We haven't been in touch since our last dinner. But his female friend did reach out a couple of days ago, saying there was a problem with the project and needed help with debugging. However..." David dragged out his words.

"Spit it out!" Patrick urged sternly.

"Don't be so harsh. Anyway, I'm out of town and can't help right
now," David continued. "But I did introduce her to a top expert.How about that for a favor?"


"A top expert? What's his name?"' Patrick pressed.


"Andrew! You must have heard of him," David said proudly. "By the way.are you interested in her? Mr. Hughes seems quite fond of her too. But if I were a woman, I'd definitely choose you first!"


Patrick ignored the comment and confirmed. "Are you talking about Andrew Anderson, the deputy director of ELE Artificial Intelligence Institute?"


"Yeah, he's at Synergy Research Center today," David replied, puzzled.

Patrick paused for a moment. "Do you know that a few years ago,Andrew was blacklisted in the industry for a sexual assault incident?"


"No way, I hadn't heard about that!" David realized he had made a mistake.


"Look what you've done!" Patrick snapped, hanging up the phone.He immediately drove to Synergy Research Center,where Andrew's studio was located. It was a converted1, abandoned yard in Silvercrest,surrounded by desolation and overgrown vines.


Before he entered, Patrick heard intermittent moans and the sound of a table shaking.


The urgent gasps and piercing screams were particularly jarring.Patrick clenched his fists, burning with anger, his body trembling. He strode forward and kicked the door open, ready to unleash his fury.
A voice inside cursed. "Who the hell is it? Do you have a death wish?
”

Andrew was naked from the waist down, his dick still inside his equally naked female assistant. She wasn't disturbed by the door opening, her legs spread wide. lost in pleasure, writhing excitedly.her hands kneading her breasts, occasionally letting out cries. with clear fluid sticking to her inner thighs.


Patrick awkwardly turned away and said to Andrew. "Get dressed and come out in two minutes!"


Patrick then walked outside. Andrew. speechless. quickly pulled out of his assistant Echo, who shuddered. her eyes glazed. Andrew put on his pants and stood in front of Patrick. thinking he would make this intruder pay.

"Where's Emily?" Patrick demanded first.


Mentioning Emily made Andrew furious. "Don't mention that bitch to me. She stole my work, and I haven't even settled the score with her yet!" Andrew sneered at Patrick. "Is she your woman? How about you settle her debt for her?"


Andrew stepped forward to grab Patrick, but Patrick threw him to the ground with a shoulder throw. Andrew was in too much pain to stand.


"Who the hell are you..." Andrew fumed.

"I'll be waiting for you at the Rivera Group!" Patrick adjusted his sleeves, his face cold. Andrew was shocked. Could he be the president
of the Rivera Group?

"Since I've answered your question, it's your turn to answer mine!"Patrick continued. "Where is Emily now?"


Despite the pain, Andrew didn't dare show it and said obsequiously,"Mr. Rivera, I don't know. She came to ask me a question today. After I kindly answered, she left without even thanking me."


Patrick didn't rush to question further. He calmly observed the surroundings and decided to believe that Andrew didn't know Emily's whereabouts for now.





Earlier that afternoon, when Andrew was about to assault Emily,she pretended to seek help from his assistant. As Andrew looked at the assistant,Emily took a stun gun from her bag.


Coming to such a remote place alone, she had to be prepared. Emily suddenly stood up and pushed Andrew, who was on a swivel chair,away. She held the stun gun, looking at the fallen Andrew.

"Did you forget how I found you?" Emily sneered.

Andrew was puzzled. "Weren't you introduced by someone?"

"Yes, David recommended you to me!"


Emily continued calmly, "But he might not have told you that I work for the Rivera Group!"

Andrew frowned. He had just sent a resume to the Rivera Group,
hoping for a collaboration opportunity. "There are many people at the Rivera Group. So what?"

"The important thing is, if the Rivera Group's president, Patrick.knows what you've done, do you think he'll let you off easily?" Emily seized the moment while Andrew was thinking to pack her laptop into her bag.


"I think you've heard about Patrick's ways. He hates it when people covet what's his, especially a person."

Emily sneered. Andrew had heard rumors that Patrick doted on a female employee, even staying away from home for years because of her.


"So it's you!" Andrew sized up Emily. Her perfect proportions,S-shaped curves, smooth skin, and deep eyes were indeed captivating.

"You'd better turn yourselfin, or you can wait for the police to come for you!" Emily said disdainfully.


Andrew froze, and Emily took the opportunity to leave. As she was about to exit. Andrew suddenly lunged at her. Emily instinctively jabbed him with the stun gun, causing him to convulse and collapse.
###Chapter 27 The Most Hurtful Words

Emily glanced at Echo, still on her knees. "Want to tag along?"

"No way. I'm just an intern at the research institute. I need to land a full-time gig first..." Echo replied. determination in her eyes.

"Alright. your choice." Emily said. opening the door and squinting against the bright sunlight. raising her hand to shield her eyes.


Marlon was frantic. As soon as the car stopped, he saw Emily,pale-faced. walking out. Seeing Marlon. Emily finally felt the fear set in. If she hadn't brought her stun gun. who knows what could have happened.


"Are you okay. Emily? As soon as Dr. Garcia told me you came to find that scumbag. I rushed over. Did he hurt you?" Marlon gripped Emily's shoulders tightly. looking her up and down with worry etched on his face. sweat beading on his forehead from his hurried arrival.


Emily hadn't been cared for like this in a long time. She felt a warmth in her heart. a bit moved. She gently pushed Marlon's hands away and said. "I'm fine, just a scare." She shook the stun gun in her bag. trying to muster a smile to reassure Marlon. but her trembling hands betrayed her fear.


Marlon ran a hand through his hair, bent down, and picked up a large brick, ready to confront someone. Emily, seeing this,grabbed Marlon's arm. Her legs were weak, and she stumbled forward into Marlon's arms.
Marlon quickly dropped the brick and held Emily steady. "You say you're fine, but you're shaking like a leaf. I think you should go to the hospital. Are you feeling anxious?" He reached out to check her forehead, his brow furrowed with concern. "You alwaystry to act so tough. How could you not be scared after something like this?"

Marlon sighed. feeling both pity for her strength and anger at what she had gone through.


Patrick arrived outside the research institute just in time to see this scene. Before the car even stopped. he flung the door open and rushed out, landing a punch on Marlon's face.

"Didn't I tell you to stay away from my woman?" Patrick's eyes blazed with anger. his fists clenched, his body trembling slightly.Seeing Emily in Marlon's arms. jealousy and rage surged through him.

Marlon wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and looked at Patrick with disdain. "Your woman? Do you really treat her like she's your woman? You knew there was a creep inside and still sent Emily here. You know she wants to leave you, so you set an impossible task for her. You're just a psycho who can't have what you want, so you try to destroy it." Marlon faced Patrick, his eyes full of anger and contempt, standing up for Emily.

Patrick's eyes were bloodshot as he grabbed Marlon by the collar. "It's none of your business. As long as she's with me, she'll do what I say!"His voice was low and hoarse, his expression almost feral, his possessiveness over Emily allowing no one else near.

"Patrick, stop acting like you own her. Emily's a person,not your
property. You don't even show her basic respect. let alone deserve her love." Marlon shot back, his gaze unwavering, trying to make Patrick understand how to treat Emily with respect.

Seeing Marlon pinned to the ground by Patrick, Emily panicked. She rushed over and grabbed Patrick's arm. Patrick turned, seeing her fighting for Marlon, his anger flared. He let go of Marlon and gripped Emily's slender arm, making her feel trapped.

Already shaken and weak, she couldn't break free. Pain and helplessness flashed in her eyes, wondering why Patrick always treated her this way when all she wanted was respect and understanding.


Patrick's eyes were red as he harshly questioned, "Are you so desperate for a man? Isn't it enough to be played by an old man,now you have a young one ready at any time? Am I not enough for you?" Jealousy and anger laced his words, seeing Emily with Marlon igniting his fury.

Emily, in pain, cried out intermittently, "Let go! Let me go!" Her voice choked with sobs, her face contorted.


Patrick, gripping her arm, tried to drag her to the car. Marlon got up from the ground, blocking Patrick, and threw a punch. Patrick stumbled, caught off guard. Marlon didIn't care about the Rivera Family's power,fighting for Emily. Emily broke free and stumbled to her car.


Patrick clung to the car door, locked in a standoff with Marlon.Seeing Emily about to leave, Patrick shouted, "Emily, get out of the
car! We haven't finished talking. Where do you think you're going?"His voice was urgent, not wanting her to leave with so many questions unanswered.


Emily drank half a bottle of water in the car. calming herself down.She rolled down the window and said to Patrick. "Mr. Rivera, I uploaded the data and algorithm mechanisms from the lab to the company before I left. I've completed the task you gave me. I'm verbally submitting my resignation from The Rivera Group." Her voice was calm. but her eyes were resolute. She had had enough and was determined to leave this place of heartbreak.

Patrick's veins bulged as he roared. "I forbid it! Without my permission. you're not going anywhere!"

His face twisted with anger, not expecting Emily to suddenly resign.In his mind. Emily was his and couldn't leave so easily.


Emily bitterly tucked her hair behind her ear and said. "Mr. Rivera.as you like to say. 'This isn't a discussion, it's a notification.'" She drove off without looking back.

Patrick raged behind her, "Emily. come back here!"
###Chapter 28 The Harbor of the Soul

Emily didn't shed a tear when she was bullied at the research institute or when Marlon swooped in like a knight in shining armor.But Patrick's hurtful words kept replaying in her head, making her feel more and more wronged.


She drove with tears streaming down her face, feeling utterly miserable.


If it weren't for The Rivera Group, why would she have gone to such a remote place to endure harassment from that old creep?

Patrick didn't comfort her but instead spew venomous words. Didhe ever worry about her, even a little?

His mind was probably filled with thoughts of Shirley. How could he possibly care about her?


Emily shook her head, trying to stop the tears and keep her vision clear, but the more she wiped, the more tears fell.

Looking at the bustling traffic around her, a dark thought flashed through her mind for a moment. Thankfully, thinking of her mom and brother helped her suppress the impulse.


On the highway, the signs kept passing by, and the name Silverbrook came into view. At this moment, Emily desperately needed comfort,and it felt like a divine sign pointing her to Silverbrook, where someone who could console her lived.

Back in college, Emily was burdened with family debt and worked
multiple jobs, often disappearing from sight. Melissa Clark. a younger student, was frail and often engaged in quiet activities like painting.

They both belonged to the art design club, as Emily was pursuing a double major and the club frequently held events. Once, they needed to design a diverse poster incorporating traditional art elements.which stumped Melissa. who stayed late in the classroom.

Melissa, her mind full of poster designs. bumped into Emily. who was returning from work. Melissa, being introverted, usually didn't ask for help and was about to leave after a brief greeting.

Emily took off her helmet and noticed the colorful design drafts in Melissa's hands. For some reason, she felt compelled to offer suggestions and shared some vector graphics libraries for reference.

To Melissa, Emily was the first person to reach out to her. "If you add the totems of bells and flowers here. it might look a bit abrupt.How about adding them here instead..." Emily said, holding the draft and thinking seriously. This scene often replayed in Melissa's mind,and she regretted not taking a photo to remember it.


Since then, Melissa often pestered Emily to look at her work, and Emily accompanied her to museums to gather materials.


When Emily returned late from work, Melissa would prepare meals for her. Emily, in turn, shared interestinng stories with her, and their bond grew stronger over time.


After graduation, Emily got into Starlight University for her master's,while Melissa, three years younger, dropped out and disappeared for
a long time.

Years later. Emily found out that Melissa had moved to the countryside in Silverbrook for therapy and had opened a café. With her hectic work schedule. Emily hadn't visited in a long time.

Emily thought to herself, 'Instead of staying here and being mistreated. why not take a break and relax for a couple of days?' The project was already completed, and she didn't care whether Patrick approved or not.

With this thought, Emily felt a sudden clarity and determination.Despite the heavy traffic on the highway, she felt an unusual calmness inside. She turned on the car's music and let the melody lift her spirits.


As the scenery outside the window changed, memories of her time with Melissa flashed before her eyes like a slideshow. After graduation, Emily joined the Rivera Group and had a packed schedule, while Melissa stayed in Silverbrook, and their contact gradually lessened.

Driving into Silverbrook, the familiar yet strange atmosphere brought warmth to Emily's heart. The peaceful and beautiful town wasn't a place to stay for long.


Standing outside Melissa's café, watching her seriously grinding coffee beans, Emily's eyes welled up.

Emily gently pushed open the door, and Melissa looked up, her face instantly lighting up with surprise. "Emily, oh my God! What are
you doing here?"

Melissa shouted as she ran over and hugged Emily tightly.

"I missed you, so I came to see you," Emily smiled, hugging the frail Melissa, feeling a sense of peace.

Without saying much. Melissa grabbed two to-go coffees and cakes from the counter. walked over to the only two customers, whispered a few words, and they left happily with gift bags.

"You didn't have to clear the place out for me, did you?" Emily teased, crossing her arms. She hadn't expected the exclusive treatment she couldn't get from Patrick to come from her best friend, warming her heart.


"Why are you here alone? Where's Patrick?" Melissa asked,looking around after closing the shop.

"Don't bother looking, it's just me," Emily smiled helplessly.

"That's weird! Ever since you started working,your focus has been either on work or Patrick. You didn't even have time to call me. How come you have time now?" Melissa asked seriously.

"That's because I gave myself a vacation!" Emily laughed. "You're not happy to see me?"


"Of course, I'm very happy!" Melissa asked, "How long are you planning to stay?"

Emily thought for a moment. "Well, that depends on my mood!"
They laughed and joked for a while before Melissa closed the shop and led Emily back to her place.


In the bathroom, the scent of bath oils filled the air. Emily layin the large bathtub, closed her eyes. and let the warm water envelop her body,quietly enjoying the long-lost tranquility and comfort.

She wondered if Patrick had seen her resignation letter. He was probably having dinner with Shirley right now.

In Patrick's eyes, she was probably just a doormat. someone to call upon and dismiss at will.
###Chapter 29 Bestie

Emily dunked her head underwater, holding her breath before coming back up. She thought. 'Emily, get it together! You and Patrick were just a contract. It's done now!'


She leaned her head back, trying to keep the tears from mixing with the bathwater.


Deep down, she knew starting off with compromises might've been a bad move.


After her bath, Emily rushed back to her room and flopped onto the soft bed, quickly drifting into a deep sleep, wrapped up in the sheets and pillows.


Melissa tiptoed into the room, seeing Emily already asleep. She gently covered her with a blanket and was about to leave when Emily's phone rang loudly.


Seeing Emily frown even in her sleep, Melissa quickly grabbed the noisy phone and stuffed it into her hoodie, sneaking it under the couch cushion in the living room.


On the other end, Patrick was waiting anxiously, anger and confusion battling within him. Emily's name cut through his heart like a knife.


All he wanted was to see her immediately, to confront her and ask if she had really gone to such lengths to leave him, even sleeping with that scumbag Andrew.

Disturbing images flooded his mind. Patrick tried to stop thinking
the worst but couldn't help wanting to fly to Emily and find out what she had done behind his back. As time passed, his anxiety and unease grew stronger.


He searched from her apartment to her house, circling around but never finding a trace of Emily. "Where else could she be?" Patrick pondered. memories of their time together flashing before him. Those quiet moments now seemed like fragile dreams. easily shattered.

Suddenly, a thought struck him-Marlon's villa. The place that had once filled him with jealousy and unease was now his only lead.


Driven by impulse. Patrick changed direction and headed straight for the villa. hoping to find Emily but dreading what he might see. His emotions were a whirlwind. and he kept telling himself to stay calm.but the anxiety and frustration were overwhelming.

A truck's headlights flashed. snapping Patrick back to reality.He swerved sharply, the impact throwing him forward. The sound of screeching brakes and shattering glass filled the air...

Emily slept soundly through the night and woke up the next day.

She slowly got up. opened the window, and looked around.

The small yard was beautifully arranged, with a pond in the southeast corner, lush flowers and plants, and some unknown greenery.

Feeling cheerful, Emily walked to the pond and squatted down to watch the goldfish. The fish seemed to sense her presence, swimming over and wagging their tails happily.
Emily couldn't help but smile, feeling like she was part of this peaceful,beautiful world.

"Finally. you're awake!" Melissa said, grinning as she walked over.

"I haven't slept this well in forever!" Emily stretched. "This place is amazing. Living here must be a dream!"

"Then stay and open a coffee shop with me!" Melissa joked.

"No way, I still have stuff to do in Pearl Peak City!" Emily laughed. "Why don't you come back to Pearl Peak City with me?"

Melissa pretended to think deeply. then hugged Emily with a playful grin. "I guess I could, but you'll have to take care of me. I'm leaving everything behind!"


Emily knew Melissa came from a wealthy family. She had only visited Melissa's grand old house once, and it had left a lasting impression.

But she never thought about taking advantage of it.

Seeing Emily in a good mood. Melissa retrieved the phone from under the couch. "Here. I put it here since you were sleeping so soundly last night."


Emily hadn't checked her phone all morning and wasn't in a hurry to do so now.


"Patrick called you a lot. I didn't answer, but he kept calling, so I hid it. What's going on with you two?" Melissa asked cautiously,
watching Emily's expression.

Emily was taken aback and saw the numerous missed calls from Patrick.


"It doesn't matter anymore," Emily sighed. "He probably saw my resignation letter and freaked out."

She said it nonchalantly.

Emily casually opened the news, and a headline caught her eye: #ELE AI Research Institute Vice President Andrew Arrested for Rape.Multiple Victims Speak Out.


It seemed the recordings and videos from the studio had worked.Emily laughed.


"What? You quit your job?" Melissa was more shocked than Emily."And you can still laugh about it!"


Work had once been as important as life to Emily, and the Rivera Group was her college dream. How could she just quit?


"Tell me, did Patrick bully you?" Melissa asked seriously, her big eyes wide with concern.


"No. I dumped him!" Emily tried to sound casual, but her heart ached as she said it.


"What? Are you serious?"

Melissa was so shocked her mouth hung open.
Seeing her reaction. Emily smiled. "Guess!"

"Oh.you tease!"

Melissa didn't believe it, knowing Patrick was Emily's first love.

Then. Melissa pretended to be angry and started tickling Emily.and they ended up in a playful tussle.

Just then. Emily's stomach growled. She hadn't eaten the night before.

They looked at each other and burst out laughing.

"Wait here. I'll cook something for you!" Melissa volunteered confidently.


Emily remembered a college volunteer event where they cooked for elderly people. Melissa had been so excited and dragged her along to sign up. Now,seeing Melissa's confident look. Emily couldn't help but marvel. Could this pampered girl really cook?
###Chapter 30 Are You Pregnant?

Emily was totally overthinking it. Watching Melissa chop potatoes was like watching a horror movie; she almost sliced her finger off.


What did you expect from a spoiled rich girl? Cooking was definitely not her thing.


Whether it was hormones or Emily's shaky hands. it took forever to make four or five dishes, and the whole place reeked of vinegar.

Melissa took a bite and couldn't hide her grimace, "Emily, your cooking has seriously gone downhill. Why'd you put so much vinegar in this?"


Emily was munching away, talking with her mouth full, "It's not that sour." Seeing Emily wasn't kidding, Melissa tried the cabbage next,but it was so sour she couldn't even swallow it.


Melissa suddenly had a lightbulb moment and grabbed Emily's wrists,"Something's up with you!"

Emily looked confused,"What's up with me?"

Melissa gave her a once-over, "You can eat something this sour... are you pregnant?"


Emily tapped Melissa's hand with her fork, "Stop talking nonsense!What do you know about pregnancy? You've never even been in a relationship!"

Emily knew she couldn't be pregnant. Every time she and Patrick
were together, he made sure she took emergency contraception afterward.


At first, she thought he was being considerate. Later, she realized Patrick looked down on her background and thought she didn't deserve to bear a child for the Rivera family.


Seeing Emily's serious expression. Melissa didn't dare say more.

Melissa noticed that whenever Emily mentioned Patrick, the light in her eyes would dim.


Back in college. Emily was head over heels for Patrick. Just a glance from him could make her happy for days. But now, all that was left was bitterness.


Lost in thought. Melissa's phone buzzed. She answered without looking. "Let me speak to Emily," a demanding voice said.

Melissa glanced at Emily, hesitated, then handed over the phone,′′I7S Patrick's number, but it's a woman speaking."


"Emily, you're such a jinx! Always playing these manipulative games!It's disgusting!" Shirley's voice came through.


"Are you done? Got nothing better to do than use Patrick's phone to insult me?" Emily shot back without hesitation.


Shirley said, "Why wasn't it you in the car accident? You're the one who should die! Your mom's a whore, your brother's an idiot, and you're no better, sleeping around with everyone! You don't deserve to be with Patrick!"
"Shirley, you know phones can record, right? Slander.personal attacks, insults-enough to get you three months in jail." Emily said coldly.


"Hmph! Jinx!" Shirley hung up, not daring to push further after hearing the word "record."

Patrick was in a car accident?

Emily was sharp. If something could make Shirley lose her cool. it was probably about Patrick. Judging by the timing, he must have had the accident while coming to see her.

With that thought, Emily stood up, feeling anxious.

"Melissa, I can't eat anymore. I'm going to rest. I'm heading back to Pearl Peak City tomorrow." Emily started walking to her room, but after a few steps,she collapsed.

"Emily!" Melissa rushed over, panicking.

At Silverbrook Central Hospital, the doctor came out of the emergency room and spoke to Melissa, "The patient is awake. You can go in now. But there's something you should know-she's six weeks pregnant. This fainting spell was due to emotional stress and physical exhaustion. She needs to take it easy from now on."


Melissa, shocked and worried, walked into the room. Seeing Emily's pale face, she didn't know how to start.

Emily forced a smile, "It's just low blood sugar. I'm fine."
Seeing her like this, Melissa guessed Emily didn't know she was pregnant yet. She spoke softly. "Emily, the doctor said you're six weeks pregnant."


Emily didn't respond. Over the past few days, her appetite had increased, and she, who usually avoided sour food, had been craving sour flavors. All the signs...


"Me? I'm going to be a mom?" Emily murmured. Every time she and Patrick were together, they took precautions, except for that one time in the car. She hadn't considered the possibilty of pregnancy.


But Emily quickly accepted the reality. She gently touched her still-flat stomach, feeling a tiny life inside. The thought excited her.


"Emily, I've been meaning to ask, what's really going on between you and Patrick?" Melissa asked cautiously.

"Didn't I tell you? I dumped him," Emily said calmly.

"I thought you were joking!" Melissa was worried. "What about the baby?"

"The baby has nothing to do with him," Emily said firmly.

"But you're still young. Having a baby is a huge responsibility.Your brother's health isn't good either. I really don't think you should keep it." Melissa tried to persuade her.


Emily was silent. She knew her mother was in rehab, her brother's condition was difficult, and she had just quit her job at The Rivera Group. Having a baby now would be a heavy burden.
"Emily, don't let a baby tie you down! Listen to me, the procedure is simple. Just close your eyes, and it'll be over," Melissa held Emily's hand tightly,speaking earnestly.

Emily fell into deep thought. After Patrick dealt with the debt collectors, her debts were temporarily cleared. Patrick gave her $100.000 a month. After family expenses, she saved quite a bit. If she was frugal and found another job, raising a child wasn't impossible.


Besides, she had seen too many homeless children. Their helpless,desperate eyes had pierced her heart. And the doctor had mentioned she had a low chance of conceiving. If she terminated this pregnancy,she might not get another chance.

Emily touched her stomach, feeling the tiny heartbeat, a sensation both strange and warm. It strengthened her resolve.

"Melissa, I've made up my mind. I'm keeping this baby. Trust me, I'll be a good mom." Emily said softly, her voice full of determination.
###Chapter 31I Want to Keep the Baby

She knew that becoming a mom was a whole new Chapter. and it was gonna take all her love and effort to raise this little one. She was ready to tackle whatever came her way and swore to protect her baby no matter what.


"Melissa, you should feel it. He's right here. a living little being!"Emily gently placed Melissa's hand on her belly.

Melissa, feeling a bit nervous, slowly reached out and mumbled. "He didn't hear what I said earlier, did he? Um, hey there, baby. I'm Melissa. I was just saying those things for your mom's sake. You didn't hear anything, okay? To make it up to you. Ill reluctantly be your godmother. But you can't hold a grudge when you grow up. alright?"

She worried that her earlier talk about abortion might have stressed Emily out even more.

"Alright, it's a deal. I'll handle the crib, the formula... all of it!"Melissa promised sincerely.


"Thank you. Melissa." Emily knew her friend truly cared and felt grateful for her support right now.

Meanwhile, in the hospital's VIP room. Patrick lay on the big bed,eyes closed, looking pale and worn out.

Jennifer sat quietly by his side, her eyes full of worry and tenderness.

The doctor had just finished his rounds, telling Jennifer that Patrick only had a mild concussion and would wake up soon. But she was
still anxious, gently stroking Patrick's face with a loving touch,as if trying to make up for past neglect.


Suddenly, her phone rang. Jennifer answered quickly, "What did you find out?"


The voice on the other end was low, "Mrs. Rivera, we found out that on the day of the accident, Patrick's driving records show he was near the old employee dorms in the city. He was probably looking for someone. I checked the company roster, and only Emily's address is listed there. Also, we managed to recover some data from his broken phone. His last few calls were to Emily, but she never answered..."

"Emily! You're nothing but trouble!" Jennifer cursed angrily.

She didn't notice Patrick's fingers twitch slightly, his brow furrowing.

After a few days of rest in Silverbrook, Emily felt better and decided to head back to the city to cancel her apartment lease. She needed to save money for the future-formula, a crib, toys, everything cost money.


"Take good care of yourself. I'll visit whenever I can!" Emily reminded Melissa.


Melissa looked reluctant to part, "Emily, I have a gift for you! It's on the table by the door!"


"What gift? Why so mysterious?" Emily laughed as she was pushed inside.


When she came out with the gift box, she saw Melissa already in the
passenger seat. buckled up.

Emily smiled helplessly, "Melissa, I suspect you've been planning this for a while!"


Melissa played innocent.′′I′m just worried about you. You're carrying a baby now."

"What about your café?" Emily asked seriously as she got in the car.

"What else? I'll close it!" Melissa shrugged, acting all casual.

Emily felt a warm glow inside, knowing her friend really cared.

As the car cruised along, Emily asked, "What song do you wanna listen to? You can hook up to the Bluetooth."


Melissa quickly connected her phone and played Justin Timberlake's "Can't Stop The Feeling."

"Your taste in music is just like a friend's of mine!" Emily laughed,thinking about how Marlon always played this song in his car.


Melissa got serious, "What friend? Do I know him? Are you closer to him or me?"


Emily chuckled, "You don't know him. Of course I'm closer to you. I'Il introduce you someday."

With Melissa around, the trip back seemed to fly by.

After getting Melissa settled, Emily called her landlord, "Hi, this is the tenant from apartment 908. I won't be renewing my lease next
month. so I'm giving you a heads-up."

The landlord replied. "Actually, we were about to contact you. Mr.Rivera has sold the property, so we won't be able to offer you the apartment next month. We apologize for the inconvenience."

"Mr. Rivera?" Emily asked, curious. "Could it be Patrick?"


"I'm sorry. we can't disclose the buyer's information," the landlord apologized.


Hanging up. Emily muttered under her breath. "Bastard, can't wait to push me to the edge?"

But she still had stuff in the apartment and needed to pack before the property management's deadline.

As she stepped out, she ran into Jennifer.

Surprisingly. Jennifer didn't start yelling this time, catching Emily off guard. To Jennifer. Emily had always been the homewrecker and the reason Patrick stayed away.

"Let's find a place to talk." Jennifer said calmly.

"There's a small park nearby, or we could go to a café." Emily suggested.

"The park will do," Jennifer replied decisively.

The small park was bustling with people exercising and dancing.

They found a quiet spot in a pavilion and sat down.
"Patrick contacted you recently?" Jennifer asked sternly.

"Yes, I've already submitted my resignation," Emily responded firmly.

"So. you're leaving the Rivera Group?" Jennifer pressed.

"Yes." Emily replied, puzzled. Jennifer had always wanted her gone.so why seek her out now?


Jennifer fell silent, debating whether to tell Emily about Patrick's accident. She just wanted someone to talk to, and surprisingly, Emily was the first person who came to mnind.


Jennifer had initially thought Emily was after Patrick's money, but a private investigator revealed that Emily was the girl Jennifer had hit with her car seven years ago on a rainy night.

That night. Jennifer had been driving alone in poor visibility and knocked over a girl on a scooter. Afraid of the media and being blackmailed, she had given the girl a large sum of money at the hospital to keep quiet.

To her surprise, the girl returned most of the money the next day,only keeping what the hospital had deducted.
###Chapter 32 There's No Way You're Br i ngi ng the Child into This World

"Jennifer?" Emily called out softly. snapping Jennifer out of her thoughts.


Just then. two kids. a boy and a girl. ran over. one holding a hot dog and the other a burger,laughing and playing.

Emily watched them with a tender smile, but the smell of the hot dog made her stomach churn. and she felt an overwhelming urge to vomit.

"What's up with you?" Jennifer asked. frowning with disdain.

"Nothing." Emily replied. trying to suppress her morning sickness.

Jennifer's intuition kicked in. "Hold on... Are you pregnant?"

"No!" Emily quickly denied. She didn't want her child to have any ties to the Rivera Group.

"Well. no matter how much Patrick likes you. he'll only marry someone from a suitable background. You don't stand a chance,"Jennifer said firmly.


Emily took a deep breath. "Jennifer. you're overthinking it! Even if you begged me. I wouldn't marry into the Rivera family!"


"Good! Keep it that way," Jennifer snapped, standing up and walking away.
As soon as she got into her car. Jennifer called her private investigator. "I need you to check Emily's recent medical records.ASAP."


The information came back quickly-Emily was pregnant!

Jennifer was deep in thought. She had longed to be a grandmother,but she never imagined the mother of her grandchild would be someone like Emily.Keeping the child and discarding the mother seemed like a viable option.


At the office, Shirley pretended to clean Patrick's desk. While wiping it down, she accidentally saw a transfer contract-Patrick had transferred ownership of an apartment to Emily.


Clutching the contract. Shirley trembled with rage. "If I can't deal with you,someone else can!"


Shirley stood at the Rivera family mansion and rang the doorbell.The butler opened the door, and she walked in without even looking up, as if she owned the place.


Seeing Jennifer sipping tea on the sofa, Shirley quickly approached and clung to her arm.


"Jennifer, you have to stand up for Patrick!" Shirley's eyes filled with tears.


"What happened, Shirley?" Jennifer asked gently.

"Jennifer,that Emily forced Patrick to transfer an apartment to her!"Shirley said angrily, handing over the contract.
Jennifer glanced at it briefly.

"Emily must have used some trick to deceive Patrick!" Shirley continued.


Jennifer recalled seeing Emily in the city and realized Patrick likely initiated the transfer. Emily probably didn't even know about it yet.Given that she was pregnant. Patrick's actions made sense.


Seeing no reaction from Jennifer. Shirley added fuel to the fire."Maybe Emily just wants a place to fool around with other guysand pop out a bastard.!"

Before Shirley could finish. Jennifer slapped her hard across the face.

"Enough! This was Patrick's decision! Now get out!" Jennifer said firmly.

Shirley was stunned. Jennifer, who had always been kind to her.had suddenly turned hostile. She didn't know what to do.

"Out!" Jennifer pointed to the door. "You can say whatever you want about Emily. but you will not speak ill of my grandchild!" Jennifer was visibly agitated.


Shirley stood outside the Rivera family mansion. the door that once held so much hope now closed, shutting her out completely.


Her eyes filled with disbelief and disappointment as memories of her time there flashed by like a movie.

From childhood to adolescence, she had grown up in that house with
Patrick, often fantasizing about becoming the lady of the house,being accepted by everyone.


As time passed, she became more brazen, enjoying everything in the house without hesitation. Patrick and Jennifer's tolerance made her believe she was already part of the family, her position unshakable.


But reality hit hard. The closed door was an insurmountable barrier.bluntly telling her she was just the daughter of a foolish driver.nothing more.


Shirley laughed bitterly, tears glistening in her eyes. "What am I to them?"


She muttered angrily, her voice filled with rage and resentment."When they looked down on Emily, they used me as a shield. Now they think she's better? They're insane. What's so great about her? She's just a whore."


Shirley buried her anger deep inside. Having lived under someone else's roof for so long, even when furious, she had to suppress her emotions.


"A child?" Shirley muttered. "Emily doesn't deserve to have a child.Patrick is mine! His child should be mine!"


Her eyes gleamed with madness as she clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms, oblivious to the pain.


Consumed by anger and jealousy, she was certain she hadn't misheard Jennifer mention the child.
Shirley thought. 'No wonder Emily's been leaving the company and moving out of the apartment. She's trying to get everyone's attention.

Now that she's carrying Patrick's child. she has to act all high and mighty. After all, the Rivera family and I have humiliated her plenty.Of course, she wants revenge! Shirley convinced herself that Emily was flaunting and taunting her.

"Emily. I won't let you have him. There's no way you're bringing Patrick's child into this world! And forget about stepping into the Rivera family! As long as I'm here. you'll never set foot in the Rivera mansion!" Shirley spat out her words with venom. glancing at the setting sun. The warm light did nothing to ease her cold heart.


Grabbing her bag from the ground. she turned and walked away. her silhouette lonely and desolate in the fading light.
###Chapter 33 The Woman Patient Without Uterus

Summer in Pearl Peak City was as hot as ever.


During the peak of summer. they'd chill a sweet watermelon in the freezer and pull it out when the heat got unbearable. The whole family would gather around and enjoy it together. making it the best part of the day.


Linda, as usual. carried a freshly chilled watermelon, smiling as she headed to her family's clinic.


Linda's family had been running a clinic in Pearl Peak City for years.Her father-in-law, a well-known medicine practitioner, had once drawn in crowds. But as the city developed and after his passing, the clinic, which refused to move, started to feel out of place. The once-bustling clinic now saw few visitors.

Most days, Linda's husband. Wade, would be lounging on a rocking chair in his office, listening to the music, and waiting for Linda to bring him watermelon.


Today, Wade was acting really strange. He was shaking his head and mumbling to himself, looking completely puzzled.


Linda was taken aback by his odd behavior. She quickly set down her basket and rushed over, "What's wrong with you? Are you Weeling sick? Why are acting so weird? Where does it hurt? Listen.don't be shy about it. We're both doctors here; if something's wrong.we need to deal with it. How about I book you an appointment with
a specialist at Pearl Peak City Hospital for a fulI check-up today?"

She stared at Wade, her eyes filled with concern.

Wade was still lost in thought, and Linda's sudden interruption startled him. Rubbing his temples, he said. "It's nothing, just don't freak out. I just feel... how do I put it? It's a bit of a shame..."


"A shame about what? Did you forget where you hid your stash of cash?" Linda joked, trying to lighten the mood.


Thinking about the stash that had been discovered made Wade a bit angry. "I'm trying to talk about something serious here! I had this weird encounter today. A young woman came in wanting to buy abortion pills. She was crying and said she'd been to several pharmacies. but they all wanted a hospital note before selling her anything, so she came to us. She told me she'd take whatever I could give her, not caring about the risks to her health. When I refused, she.



Wade spoke quickly, his breath a bit uneven.

"What did she say?"

Linda's curiosity was piqued, her eyes wide with interest.

"She insisted that I prescribe her the medication, practically grinding her teeth in frustration. I just felt something was off; it seemed like she wanted to give it to her love rival or something. I couldn't take that risk-what if something went wrong? I could end up causing a tragedy!" Wade said, pounding his chest in anxiety.
Linda nodded in agreement. "Exactly, we need to be careful. We're doctors, and if something happens, it could ruin our clinic's reputation. But it's not that unusual; maybe she was just being honest and didn't mean any harm."


Linda didn't quite grasp Wade's underlying worry; she thought it wasn't as serious as he made it seem.


"What I'm trying to say isn't about that. When she asked for the pills,I didn't think much of it at first. I just wanted to do a check-up to see what medication would be appropriate, to minimize any harm to her body," Wade explained patiently. He had always been cautious and responsible in his practice.


"That makes sense; if we can help her have a safe abortion, that's a good thing. She must be going through a tough time, being from out of town, right?" Linda said with sympathy.

Wade interrupted her empathy. "Her accent sounded a bit like it's from Pearl Peak City, but definitely not from the city center. But that's not the point!"

He was feeling a bit frustrated now.

"Alright, so what's so strange about it?" Linda asked as she sliced into a watermelon, the red juice dripping onto the old table.

"What's strange is this: when I suggested a check-up, she initially refused. I explained that without an examination, I couldn't accurately determine the right dosage for the medication. She kept insisting on a large dose, even double the amount. She seemed a bit
out of control, and I was ready to kick her out. But then, maybe because she saw I was serious, she finally agreed." Wade recalled, his expression full of confusion.


"When she agreed to the check-up, that's when I was shocked. This woman-she didn't even have a uterus! How could she be pregnant?"Wade's voice dropped, knowing it was a sensitive topic, even when speaking to Linda.

"What?" Linda gasped, covering her mouth, her eyes wide in disbelief.

"What are you saying, Wade? Are you losing it? Is she really a woman? Could she be a transgender person dressed as a woman to buy the pills?" Linda struggled to believe it, desperately searching for an explanation.


"She is a woman! I've been a doctor for over fifty years; there's no way I could be wrong!" Wade felt defensive, his confidencein his medical skills shining through. "No way! You can doubt my character,but you can't question my medical judgment..." The more he talked,the more aggrieved he felt.
###Chapter 34 Buy a House for the Child

"Alright. I believe you. Keep going." Linda handed Wade a slice of watermelon, her voice calm but still a bit skeptical. She rested her chin on her hand, eager to hear more.


Wade stroked his beard and continued. "That woman really didn't have a uterus. I checked multiple times to make sure. She seemed normal at first, but for some reason, it was removed. I wanted to ask why, but it felt too personal, so I didn't. She got impatient and snapped, Just give me the prescription already.' Now tell me. how could she be pregnant without a uterus? Who was that medicine for?"

Wade analyzed, "It definitely wasn't for a relative. She probably wanted to harm someone, so I kicked her out." He finished, still shaken, grateful he hadn't prescribed anything and avoided a disaster.


"Wade,looks like your instincts are still sharp. You did the right thing. I wouldn't have let you prescribe anything either." Linda pursed her lips in disapproval.

She then sighed, "They say the older generation is conservative about relationships, but I really can't understand the young people's views on love. You try to talk to them, but they don't listen. In the end,they just hurt themselves..." She shook her head, baffled by the younger generation.

They fell into contemplation as the evening cicadas gradually quieted,leaving only the oppressive heat.

The air was heavy, mirroring their somber mood.
They pondered the strangme patient. the clinic silent except for the old fam spinming comtinucusly.


Wade and Linda sat quietly. their faces filled with worry and confusion, wondering what had happened to the world to bring about such bczarre events.


The afternoon sun blazed down. scorching the streets of Pearl Peak City. Shirley stormed through the crowd. furious.


Her face was flushed. eyes blazing. and she cursed under her breath."Emily, you bitch. I won't let you get away with this!"


Her sharp voice drew the attention of passersby, but she was oblivious.lost in her rage.


"Why her? Just a lowly woman. how could she be pregnant with Patrick's child? I should be the one by Patrick's side!" Jealousy festered in Shirley's heart. She stormed back to the office, her steps heavy and hurried, muttering curses as she went. Onlookers thought the usually gentle-looking girl had gone mad today.


Shirley sensed the strange looks, feeling everyone was mocking her,just like Emily did. with that superior. confident, and disdainful gaze.

She screamed internally, fists clenched, nails digging into her palms without feeling the pain, only the burning anger.


She glanced at the hardware store sign gleaming coldly and a wild thought crossed her mind, 'If it comes to it, Ill buy a hammer. I'd rather be charged with assault and spend a few days in jail than let Emily marry into a wealthy family. If I can't have him, neither can
Emily!

The idea swirled in her mind as she moved towards the hardware store.


But as she reached the entrance, a wave of fear and rationality washed over her. quelling her impulse. Staring at the cold tools inside.she imagined attacking Emily with a hammer, and her hands trembled. She thought. 'Do I really want to do this? If I do. it's all over...


She was torn with inner conflict.

In the end. she didn't have the courage to enter the store and turned into a grocery store instead.


The store was filled with the aroma of food, but it couldn't dispel the gloom in her heart.

Meanwhile, Emily stood at the entrance of a newly built community,surrounded by tall buildings and busy construction. The sunlight bathed her. but she felt little warmth, filled with confusion and anticipation.


She was torn, wondering whether to buy a house in a good school district or one with a garden. She had been in Pearl Peak City for years. living like Patrick's shadow, dependent on him.


Living in the house Patrick bought seemed comfortable, but it was like being a caged bird, unaware of life's complexities. Now she realized how much thought went into buying a house. "If you have elderly family members, you need to be near parks and hospitals; if
you have kids. you need to be close to markets and schools; if you're working.you need to be near the subway and gyms..." She muttered to herself, her eyes filled with helplessness and reflection.

There was no perfect house, just like there was no perfect solution to every problem. but she still hoped to findthe best place for her child.

"Ms. Thompson? I noticed you went to the bathroom three times while looking at the house, and you kept rubbing your back and yawning. I guess you might be pregnant. right? Are you looking for a new home for your future baby? You have a good eye. This house is in a school district. There's a kindergarten and an elementary school nearby. The middle school is a bit farther, but it's only a 15-minute drive." A slightly awkward but enthusiastic voice interrupted Emily's thoughts. She turned to see Vida, a round-faced saleswoman,smiling brightly with genuine anticipation in her eyes.

Emily was surprised, not expecting the young woman to be so observant.


"How did you figure that out? No one else noticed."Emily asked curiously.
###Chapter 35 The Desired House

Vida chuckled softly. "I studied nursing, but my degree wasn't exactly from a top-tier school. Couldn't snag a job at a big hospital.and I wasn't keen on heading back to my small town. So. I hustled to stay in Pearl Peak City, hoping to make a name for myself. When nursing gigs didn't pan out. I switched to real estate."

Emily felt a sense of camaraderie. Neither of them were natives of Pearl Peak City, and they had both worked hard to establish themselves in the big city. "Some people are born in Rome, while others spend their lives striving to get there. Without a doubt. Vida and I are the latter."


Emily felt a growing sense of closeness to Vida.

Pointing to the house. Emily asked, "Are there any hospitals nearby?"

Vida quickly grabbed a laser pointer and indicated a building. "This is Sunrise General Hospital, a nationally recognized facility. The medical equipment and staff are top-notch, but... it's a bit pricey."

She smiled sweetly, and Emily nodded in satisfaction before asking."Is it close to any train stations, subway stations, or airports?"


Vida looked a bit regretful. "I wish I could say it'sconveniently located, but the nearest bus stop is 25 minutes away. The airport and train station are even farther, at least 40 to 50 minutes by car.I'm afraid the transportation might not meet your needs."


Emily shook her head. "You're mistaken. I'm not looking for convenience; I want a safe environment. High-traffic areas aren't safe
for kids."

Vida's eyes lit up. "Exactly! If you have children, a quiet and serene house is much better!"


Emily nodded. lost in thought.

She remembered her childhood. moving to Pearl Peak City with her mother for work. They lived in cramped1. noisy.old shared housing.a haunting memory. After her mother remarried. her stepfather. a steelworker. still lived in a rundown. cluttered apartment.


"As a child. I dreamed of owning a house. but homes in the big city are so expensive." Emily sighed.


If it weren't for Lisa's addiction and Gordon's illness, she would have saved enough money to buy a house by now. Patrick's departure made her reassess her life. especially since she was pregnant. Buying a house had become even more important; she had to plan for herself and her child.


Emily was clearly interested. Vida. the sales agent, pulled out a calculator and enthusiastically explained. "Ms. Thompson. don't worry. While the house isn't cheap. we offer installment plans for the down payment, making the total cost more manageable. This 1.000-square-foot.three-bedroom. one-living room house even comes with a study. It's priced at 546.000 per square foot, totaling S4.6 million."


Vida continued. "If you go with the installment plan. you can pay 30% upfront and the rest in monthly payments. You can move in right away since it's not an off-plan property; it's already built and fully

furnished. You'd only need to buy a bed, mattress, and bedding.Given that you're pregnant. buying an unfurnished house would mean waiting for renovations to finish before moving in, so this is perfect for you."


Emily did some quick mental math. She had enough for the down payment. but the thought of a monthly mortgage over $10.000 made her uneasy, especially since she no longer worked at the Rivera Group. Emily thought. 'Can I really afford this? How will I manage in the future?' Anxiety crept in.


Vida noticed her hesitation and knelt down, speaking softly. "Ms.Thompson, if you have any concerns, feel free to share them. It's okay if you don't buy today. I'm an intern, so I don't earn much commission. Consider this practice for me. By the way. I've enjoyed our conversation. You can just call me Vida if you don't mind."

Emily felt warmth in her heart, seeing the sincerity in Vida's eyes.She felta surge of courage and strength. She thought, 'I can't be weak anymore. I have a degree and skills. I won't starve. Am I going to live off Patrick's $3 million and scrape by in Pearl Peak City? Even without Patrick, there are many big companies where I can interview for jobs. There's no rule against pregnant women working. Worst case.I can do part-time jobs to support myself.'


With newfound determination, Emily declared, "Bring me the contract. I'll sign it!"

Vida's eyes widened in surprise, as if she were frozen.

She had been with the company for over ten days, facing cold stares
and setbacks without making a single sale.

Her boss's harsh words still echoed in her ears, "If you don't make a sale this month, you're out."


Initially. she didn't expect Emily to buy a house. She just wanted to practice her social and sales skills. thinking it wouldn't matter if she lost this job. Experience is built through challenges.


Now, hearing Emily's decision to buy. Vida felt a wave of joy. Her cheeks flushed. and her eyes sparkled with excitement. She beamed."Ms. Thompson. remember my name is Vida. Ill handle all the paperwork for you. If the contract looks good. just sign it."

Her voice trembled with excitement as she quickly organized the contract, afraid Emily might change her mind.
###Chapter 36 Emily Didn't Come?

"I believe you." Emily said. giving Vida's shoulder a reassuring pat. It made Vida feel all warm inside.


For the next half hour. they chatted away happily. the vibe light and easy. With Vida's professional and patient help. Emily managed to sign the home purchase contract without a hitch.


Stepping out of the sales office. thesunlight hit Emily. filling her with a sense of ease and joy.

She walked with her head held high, her steps confident. like the path ahead was brand new.


She glanced down at her new leather flats and smiled. These shoes felt like a symbol of change in her life.


Gently touching her stomach, she felt a wave of tenderness and strength. "From now on. I'm gonna be a strong and independent mom," she whispered to herself.

Looking back at the sales office, she felt like her life was just beginning.


She used to think that being with Patrick was everything, giving up so many chances to grow and tying her self-worth to his approval.Now. it all seemed so ridiculous.


Emily thought. "What a jerk! To hell with all of them!"

Buying a house on her own was the first step towards independence.
Next, she needed to step out of her comfort zone and earn money for her baby's formula!

Emily silently cheered herself on.

Patrick slowly woke up from a haze, his head heavy, like it was wrapped in thick fog, his thoughts sluggish. Instinctively,he wanted to see Emily as soon as he opened his eyes.


Struggling to open his eyes, the familiar yet strange hospital room came into view. The white walls were glaring, the disinfectant smell was strong, and the silence felt like invisible pressure, making him uneasy.

He rubbed his head instinctively, feeling the rough, tight bandages on his hand and head. They reminded him of the recent accident,causing his heart to tighten.

Adding to his frustration, Emily wasn't there!

His throat was dry. He pressed the button by his side, the crisp sound particularly jarring in the silence.


His eyes were filled with lonely confusion, hoping for a familiar face to break the solitude. A nurse hurried in, her steps brisk.


"Why am I the only one here? Where is everyone else?" Patrick croaked out each word with difficualty.


The nurse kept a professional smile. "Mr. Rivera, how are you feeling?The doctor will be here shortly."
Seeiing Patnick's urgent expression, the mutse qwickly aduled. "A young lady beought you some food eatlier. When she saw you hadn't woken up. she took it to the nurse's suation to heat it up. As for your momn.she visits you every day, but usually after 5 PM. During the day. that young lady spends more time with you."


Patrick's heart settled a bit. like a heavy stone dropping, creating ripples of relief.


He thought. "Emily. at least you have a conscience. knowing I was in a car accident and coming to take care of me. But don't think Tll forgive you for quitting without permission and staying out all night!"

With that thought. Patrick's fists clenched involuntarily. his knuckles turning white. An unidentifiable fury ignited within his chest.wanting to pin Emily down and teach her a lesson.


His brows furrowed.eyes filled with anger, yet there was a hint of anticipation, hoping she would appear and explain herself.


Just then, the door slowly opened, and a slender figure walked in with a thermos.


Patrick's heart filled with anticipation, but the light in his eyes dimmed the moment he saw who it was.


It was Shirley, not the Emily he longed for. "What are you doing here?" Patrick blurted out coldly, his mouth turning down,eyes filled with disappointment and displeasure.

Shirley seemed oblivious to his coldness, forcing a sweet, innocent smile, trying to dispel his gloom.
"Patrick, you're awake. Does your head still hurt? Are you feeling uncomfortable? As soon as I heard from the nurse. I rushed over.Look. I brought you your favorite crab and corn soup!" Her eyes were full of expectation, like a child waiting for praise.

Patrick glanced at the soup, momentarily lost in thought,his mind drifting to Emily.


He never ate crab. but the chef at home made excellent crab and corn soup for a foodie who loved it. Every time, he would have a large portion packed to take to the office.


Seeing this dish now only fueled his anger. "Where's Emily?" he demanded coldly. his eyes urgent and expectant, like a faint glimmer of hope in the darkness.

Hearing Patrick call out Emily's name. jealousy and grievance surged in Shirley's heart, her eyes welling up with tears.

Shirley said, "Patrick, why are you still thinking about Emily? She hasn't come to see you even once since your accident! I've been here with you every day. Do you know how worried I've been? I wished it was me who got hurt. Seeing you unconscious and hearing the doctor say you had a concussion scared me to death! Patrick, please stop thinking about her."
###Chapter 37 She Doesn't Love You at All

Shirley spoke through her tears, her voice thick with frustration and hurt, hoping her tears would make Patrick pay more attention to her.

She looked at Patrick with longing eyes, desperately wanting him to comfort her.


But when Patrick saw Shirley crying, he looked at her with disdain instead of sympathy.


Patrick had a thing about cleanliness and couldn't stand seeing women cry. except for Emily. When Emily cried, it oddly made him feel at ease, as if he had control over her emotions.


In the past. when Shirley and Emily were together, and Shirley got bullied by Emily, Patrick would occasionally feel sorry for her.


But now. with Emily not around, any sympathy Patrick had for Shirley vanished instantly. He wondered if his feelings had changed because Emily was gone, or if the car accident had messed up his brain.


Patrick's face was full of confusion, his brows furrowed tightly.

Seeing Patrick remain silent, Shirley felt even more wronged and continued, "Patrick, you have no idea how heavy you are. I've been the one turning you over and cleaning you these past few days."

"I know you don't like others touching you, so I didn't let the nurse help. Look at my hands, they're red and sore, and I have no strength left."
She extended her trembling hands to show Patrick. They were covered in blisters, some of which had burst, looking quite alarming.Shirley looked exhausted, hoping Patrick would notice her hard work.


Patrick glanced down and saw that Shirley's hands were indeed badly hurt. His heart softened, and his tone became gentler, a hint of guilt flashing in his eyes. He said, "Thanks, Shirley."

He knew Shirley had suffered a lot taking care of him. Although he was grateful, his emotions were mixed with other complicated feelings.

Just hearing "thanks" made Shirley feel like she had received a treasure. Her face lit up with a satisfied smile, happy like a child who had just gotten candy.


She quickly opened the lunchbox, handed Patrick a fork, pouted, and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, saying sweetly, "Patrick,try this. I made it myself. If you don't want the crab and corn, that's fine.You're sick right now. I remember Jennifer said too much crab can upset your stomach. So, have some chicken soup instead. And there's this pie... it's my first time making it, so it's not perfect."

She playfully stuck out her tongue, trying hard to act cute and innocent in front of Patrick, hoping he would eat a few bites.


Patrick frowned at the unappetizing food in front of him, his brows knitting even tighter, showing hesitation and disdain.

But not wanting to hurt Shirley's feelings, he slowly placed the utensils on the table and said softly, "I'm not hungry right now.Please take it away."
Patrick had no appetite at the moment; his mind was filled with thoughts of Emily.


Patrick was puzzled why Emily hadn't come to see him and what she was doing.


His anticipation gradually turned into anger, wondering if he meant nothing to Emily. Was she so eager to get rid of him?


"Shirley, has Emily really not come by even once?" Patrick asked again, unwilling to give up, his eyes cold but filed with a mix of hope and anger,waiting for a different answer.

Seeing Shirley remain silent, his eyes were full of urgency, eagerly waiting for her to confirm.


When Shirley heard Patrick mention Emily again, jealousy flared up inside her. Her expression changing slightly, her eyes flashing with anger and resentment.


She wondered why Patrick kept asking about Emily when she had repeatedly told him Emily hadn't come. Did he not believe her?


Could it be that in Patrick's heart, Emily was the most important,and he just didn't realize it yet?


Thinking this, Shirley trembled with anger, her hands clenched into fists, her body shaking slightly.

Everyone thought she was Patrick's beloved and would surely become Mrs. Rivera in the future. She couldn't let anyone know that Patrick actually loved Emily.

Otherwise, she would become the laughingstock of Pearl Peak City.and all her father's efforts over the years would be in vain.


Shirley felt both resentful and jealous, but she didn't dare show it in front of Patrick.


Thinking of her somewhat mentally challenged father, Shirley felt the Rivera family owed her family. She believed that only by marrying into the Rivera family could she settle the score.


Shirley stood up, wiped her tears with the back of her hand,leaving a tear streak, and said. "Patrick, since you woke up, you haven't asked about Jennifer or cared about me. Even when you saw my injured hands, you didn't feel sorry for me. All you do is think about Emily.Have you forgotten? She quit and left. Who knows where she went? She hasn't shown up for days. When you had the car accident,I called her first thing, but she didn't answer and even blocked me.Look-"


She pulled out her phone and showed it to Patrick, her eyes full of urgency, hoping he would believe her.

Patrick saw Shirley had called Emily 42 times without getting through,realizing she wasn't lying.

A surge of anger, disappointment, and helplessness overwhelmed him.With determination in his eyes, he pulled out the IV needle, causing blood to spurt and Shirley's face to turn pale with fright.

"Patrick, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Don't get so worked up.Emily isn't worth it. You care about her, but she doesn't care about
you at all." Shirley cried, her face covered in tears, her makeup smudged.

She just wanted to persuade Patrick to see her worth, her eyes full of worry and urgency,hoping he would calm down.


"She sees you as a monster and avoids you. She doesn't love you!" As soon as Shirley said this, Patrick looked up, his eyes fierce and burning with anger, scaring her into taking a step back.
###Chapter 38 Single Mother

Shirley looked at Patrick, who was fuming like a volcano about to erupt. Her teeth started chattering on their own.

"Patrick, please, don't be like this. I'm scared. It's me. Shirley.the one you always protect," she said, her voice trembling.

Her eyes were wide with fear and helplessness.

Patrick's face softened as soon as he heard her.

Shirley hadn't really done anything wrong, except maybe mess up dinner.


Thinking about her dad. Elbert Wright, Patrick felt a wave of sadness.

If Elbert hadn't acted so quickly during that car accident, unbuckling his seatbelt and shielding Patrick in the backseat. Patrick might've been the one with a head injury or worse.

Elbert ended up with a disability because of that accident.

For years. Patrick and Jennifer felt guilty and tried to make it up to Shirley. They gave her and Elbert a monthly allowance of $3.000 to $5.000 and kept Elbert on as a driver. Even though his mind wasn't as sharp, he was still a safe driver.

Remembering this, Patrick's eyes filled with gratitude and guilt. He waved Shirley over. "Come here, Shirley."


Seeing Patrick's softened expression, Shirley cautiously sat on the edge of the hospital bed. Patrick gently took her hand, and the vow
he made as a kid came rushing back-to love Shirley like a sister.

Why had he just lost his temper with her?

Patrick barely recognized himself. He blamed it all on Emily, making him lose control. If I catch that woman, she'll regret it! Leaving? Not without my permission!' Patrick fumed, feeling like a betrayed husband.


Shirley watched Patrick's expression, gripping the lunchbox so tightly she almost crushed it. Patrick used to despise Emily, so why did he care so much now?


Could it be that Patrick knew Emily was pregnant?

The thought made Shirley's heart clench. She resolved not to let Emily get close to Patrick again. How could she compete with Emily otherwise?


She had to see if Emily could even have this baby!

As she plotted, Shirley felt smug, cursing under her breath,'Bitch,wait for karma to get you!'

"Emily, you move fast! Buying a house just like that, impressive!How come you didn't bring me along for such a big decision?"Melissa nudged her, then added, "I've decided, I'm buying a place next door. We'll stay best friends and neighbors, and when your baby is born. I'll be the godmother!"

Melissa was thrilled, acting like she had bought the house herself.
Emily looked at her carefree friend with a hint of envy. Melissa had always lived in a small town because of her weak health. Silverbrook's peaceful vibe was perfect for her, with her family building a villa and opening a café for her, even letting her return to Pearl Peak City.


Pampered by her family, she had no worries, unlike Emily.

Emily's new place was on the seventeenth floor, not too low.

The complex faced a park and a hillside, quiet and peaceful; across the park was Gordon's rehab center, and behind it was a detox center.Emily chose Silverbrook to live freely as a single mom, far from Pearl Peak City and Patrick, but close enough to help her famiy if needed.


"Emily! Let's celebrate! You're a homeowner now!" Melissa said excitedly. Emily pinched her cheek and asked, "Can you really leave Silverbrook? I know your heart condition is why your parents want you to stay there."

Emily was full of concern.

Melissa said, "I'm really fine, I promise!"

Melissa leaned on Emily's shoulder, pouting, "I'm so bored in Silverbrook. You're the only friend who visits often. My grandparents are all in Pearl Peak City. It's so dull."


Emily said, "Buat the medical facilities in the suburbs..."

Melissa interrupted, "Don't worry, I'm really fine! I had surgery abroad at 16, and after two years of recovery, I'm all good. Look, I
can even jump around."

"Oh my God, don't jump!" Emily quickly held her back.′′I7s good you're fine, no need to prove it. But you should tell your parents about moving back to Pearl Peak City, so they don't worry."

"Don't worry,they know as soon as I leave home," Melissa replied.

Looking at the empty house,they sat on the floor.


Melissa grabbed Emily's hand and asked, "Does Patrick know you're moving this far? Do you really want nothing to do with him? You're carrying his child. Cutting ties completely isn't fair to you, is it?"

She continued angrily, "Why should you handle the pregnancy and childbirth alone? It's so painful to give birt,and he gets off easy? I wouldn't stand for it."


Emily leaned against the wall, gazing out the window with a sigh."Keeping the baby was my decision. I don't want him to know or be involved. You know the Rivera Family looks down on me. Patrick never acknowledged me as his girlfriend. What's the point of dragging it out? Having a child without a status would just make it a bastard. I'd rather raise the baby on my own and proudly say I'm a single mom!" Her words were bold.
###Chapter 39 Spilling Oil

Melissa listened to Emily's upbeat attitude and hugged her arm tightly.


She couldn't help but wonder why someone as amazing as Emily always seemed to face so many challenges. Do hardships really come before good things?

Melissa, full of enthusiasm, insisted on giving a housewarming gift and helped move the furniture. Emily felt warm inside and gladly accepted the help.


They lay hand in hand on the still-wrapped mattress, feeling secure in the new home. Melissa asked, "Emily, when you came to Silverbrook to find me, I thought you were moving far away. I didn't expect you'd come back to Pearl Peak City. By the way,how's Gordon doing? Can he come home to recover?"

Emily's eyes lit up at the mention of her brother. She pulled out her phone to show Melissa. "Gordon's doctor messaged today, saying he can communicate a bit now and isn't as withdrawn as before. I'm planning to bring him home in a week. The rehab center has a special school, and Gordon's almost ten. He needs to grow up."

Talking about Gordon softened Emily's heart. Years ago, Lisa had worked in a bar to make ends meet and accidentally drank a spiked drink, becoming addicted to drugs. She was already four months pregnant with Gordon when she found out, thinking her missed periods were due to the addiction.
Lisa had considered an abortion, but the doctor warned that her health was too poor, and she might never be able to have children again if she went through with it.


Emily was just over two years old then, a well-behaved and understanding child. Lisa knew the dangers of drugs and feared that if something happened to her. Emily would be left alone. Having a brother would give her a family connection and support, so she decided to have Gordon despite the opposition.

Others didn't understand, but Emily knew her mother's intentions.

They laughed and rolled around on the bed, not noticing Emily's phone screen flashing with different names.


The phone was on silent, cutting off her connection to the outside world. If it weren't for basic manners, Emily would have deleted those contacts long ago.

At Crystal Heights Residences. Emily and Melissa stood at the door of the new home, exhausted but full of hope for the future. Emily's eyes were determined, with a hint of anticipation. "Let's go, we need to finish packing and move in as soon as possible."

Melissa nodded, and they headed to Emily's old place.

The place looked the same, with weathered walls full of history. As soon as they stepped into the yard, the noise hit their ears.


Emily frowned. She never liked such noisy environments, especially dealing with neighbors arguing over trivial matters.
But she had lived here for many years, with memories and connections.

She pulled Melissa, wanting to quickly pass through the crowd.

Unexpectedly, the neighbors seemed to have planned it. sopping her.A middle-aged woman named Zola approached enthusiastically.her face exaggeratedly warm. "Emily.you're back! You've got some luck.don't you?"

Emily was puzzled and stopped. politely asking. "Zola. what do you mean by luck?"

She was eager to pack and didn't want to stay long. but the neighbor s words piqued her curiosity, making her stop to listen.


Emily's brow furrowed, feeling uneasy. not knowing what had happened.

A woman in pajamas holding a bucket quickly added, "Someone poured oil on the stairs. Rob and John fell down the stairs. John died on the spot. and Rob couldn't even crawl up."

The woman's eyes showed fear, mixed with excitement.

Emily's heart tightened as she pictured the dark stairwell and the two old men falling. She felt a chill down her spine and looked at the neighbors, wanting to know more.


Zola vividly described, "It was in your building, the stairwell was covered in oil!"
"What kind of oil?" Melissa asked, curious.

"Just regular cooking oil," another woman chimed in. "Luckily, it wasn't gasoline, or it would have been a disaster."


She added, "At first, everyone thought some careless kid spilled cooking oil, and it flowed down the stairs. But then John's son came back and saw his dad had fallen. The young man, being educated.immediately thought, what kind of oil could flow from the 7th floor to the 1st floor? It would take several buckets, so he suspected someone did it on purpose."

Melissa's exaggerated reaction fueled Zola's storytelling, and she continued, "Exactly! I went up to see, and the oil flowed from the 7th floor to the 1st floor, covering the stairwell. The smell wasn't strong.as it's common cooking oil, so no one noticed. Plus, the building is old, with no sensor lights, making the stairwell pitch dark."

Zola complained about the building's condition, trying to get everyone to agree.


The woman in pajamas continued, "Last night, I was playing cards in the hallway, and there was no oil then. This morning, the accident happened. I suspect someone poured it on purpose in the early hours!
###Chapter 40 Lucky

The old guy with the thermos shook his head and sighed, "Poor John,man. He got such a raw deal. He takes a walk every morning,and now he's caught up in this mess. Who knows which heartless jerk is behind this, causing trouble in our building."


His eyes were full of sympathy for John, showing they were indeed close.


The neighbors were all talking at once, their voices getting louder,turning the courtyard into a stage. Emily glanced towards her front door, which was taped off by the police. Several officers in white coats were crouched down, discussing something.


The sunlight bounced off the police car, glaringly bright. A wave of unease washed over her, filling her with questions. Why would someone pour oil in the stairwell?

Could it have anything to do with her?

Emily started walking towards the building, but a female officer stopped her, politely saying, "Ma'am, you can't go in there. It's sealed off while we collect evidence. Is there something you need?"

Emily pointed to the top floor. "I live up there, in 706. I was planning to move out and came back to get a few things."


The officer looked Emily up and down, noting her tall, delicate frame and flat shoes. She seemed gentle and harmless, so the officer's guard lowered a bit. "You can't go up right now. The stairwell is covered in cooking oil. The stairs are concrete and already slippery from wear.
With the oil. it's a guaranteed fall. We're wearing anti-slip shoe coners to go up there."


Melissa glanced at Emily's belly and kindly suggested. "Emily.maybe you should leave it for today. It's not urgent. and a fall could be serious"


Emily didn't respond. standing with her arms crossed. fingers tapping hner chin last in thought.

If someone wanted to rob and kill. why target this poor area?

The residents here didn't have much money; even a thief would be out of luck.


Could it be a personal vendetta among the residents?

But if it was revenge. wouldn't gasoline be more effective than cooking oil?

Or maybe they just wanted to teach someone a lesson with a fall?

Bur that seemed too childish.

Thinking about her new house and leaving the past behind. could this incident be related?


Her mind was full of questions and unease.

Emily stopped moving forward and nodded politely to the officer."
Thank you."

The officer reminded her. "Don't go up today. Wait until we've
finished. The stairs need professional cleaning. Be careful and avoid getting hurt again. We'll find out where the oil came from. so don't panic or spread rumors." Emily nodded repeatedly.


She knew most of her clothes and household items were already moved to the new house. She just wanted to check if Lisa had left any old keepsakes behind.


If Lisa got out of rehab and found out something precious was left behind,she'd definitely blame her.


Besides, this old apartment held memories of her stepfather.

Emily and Melissa turned to leave. Melissa noticed the crowd and pulled Emily along, saying, "I saw a video once where a shop owner poured oil on the stairs to the second floor. There was a bar on the second floor, and the noise kept the first floor awake. They tried to negotiate, but it didn't work, and the police couldn't help. Both floors were owned by the same landlord. So, the first floor poured cooking oil on the stairs. A bunch of young people singing and drinking upstairs, about seventeen or eighteen of them, all fell down the stairs.Three of them broke bones. It was serious!"


Melissa's story made the two incidents seem very similar.

Emily's unease grew. Could the oil incident be related to her?

A flash of her conflict with Patrick crossed her mind. Could someone close to him be behind this?


Her heart raced with anxiety.
Emily instinctively placed a hand on her belly. not noticing Shirley lurking around the corner, wearing a baseball cap and mask,glaring at her with hatred, wishing she could stab her.

Shirley cursed under her breath. 'Lucky you, still alive after all this!

Frustrated,her meticulous plan had failed. She thought Emily still lived in the building. Did she not come down this morning, or did she not come home last night?


She wondered if Patrick, who left the hospital alone, had gone to see Emily.


Shirley gripped the fruit knife in her bag, her fingers turning white from the pressure.

She didn't want to go down with Emily unless absolutely necessary,
but her hatred was overwhelming. All her careful planning had been for nothing!

Emily and Melissa left the courtyard as the sun set. Emily felt dread,convinced the oil incident was connected to her but unable to piece it together.


Suppressing her anxiety, she hurried Melissa along, feeling safer only when they reached Crystal Heights Residences.

At Crystal Heights Residences, the sunlight gently streamed through the windows, casting a soft glow on the new sofa. The room was peaceful and serene.

Emily and Melissa sat on the sofa, sipping milk, quietly enjoying the
tranquility. The scent of milk filled the air. warming their friendship.
###Chapter 41 Two Fathers in Memories

Melissa shot a glance at Emily's calm face, a hint of worry in her eyes."Emily, now that you've snagged the house, what's the game plan?You're so independent, you won't let me help out. If you did.you wouldn't need to work. You could whip up some meals for me.and I could focus on selling my paintings. We'd be swimming in cash!"

She waved her hands around, eyes sparkling with dreams of the future, like her paintings had already sold out and she was basking in fame and fortune.


Emily chuckled,giving her nose a playful tap, feeling a warm glow in her heart. Her best friend's words were like a cozy blanket on a chilly day, comforting and reassuring. After all the ups and downs,this friendship had become her most cherished solace, like finding a safe harbor in life's storms.


Seeing Emily's silence, Melissa eagerly continued, "Hey, didn't you major in jewelry design in college? You even won first place with that cross-disciplinary project. When you get a chance, could you design a set of jewelry for me? My neck feels so bare. The stuff my parents gave me is way too tacky. Remember, I love colorful pieces."

Melissa had a thing against traditional jewelry and craved unique designs. She touched her neck, imagining herself decked out in beautiful,playful pieces.

Emily knew Melissa didn't really hate jewelry; it was because she had been frail and often hospitalized as a kid, unable to wear any.
Those tough hospital days had only strengthened their bond. Emily's mind drifted back to college, where the sky was always blue, and the campus buzzed with youthful energy.

On the day she volunteered to welcome new students in her senior year. Melissa had shown up like a fairy, wearing a short skirt and with long, flowing blonde hair, lively and beautiful.


From that moment, Melissa had stuck to Emily like glue, sweetly calling "Emily..." in a clear voice that echoed down the hallways,becoming Emily's closest companion during college.


Later, when Melissa missed a few days of classes, Emily found out she had a severe heart condition and kidney failure.


Emily quickly organized classmates to donate blood and secretly got tested for a kidney match, but she wasn't a match. The Clark family found out about this and, despite the unsuccessful match, they were grateful and took good care of Emily. She was always welcome at the Clark household, and they deeply valued the bond between them.


Hearing Melissa mention her college major, Emily's memories were unlocked, and stories Lisa had told her came flooding back, filled with the marks of time and emotional warmth.


Emily's mom, Lisa, was from Lindell Harbor. Though her family was ordinary, she was naturally beautiful. With numerous admirers, she stood out like a radiant blossom blooming in the heart of the town.


At that time, she didn't know the hardships ahead and shyly chose a boyfriend with her parents' guidance.
Eventually, her grandparents chose John Thompson, who had a stable job.


Back then, being a driver was a great job, with high income and freedom. Lisa and John lived happily, and within two years, Lisa was expecting Emily.


Those days were filled with hope, looking forward to the new life and dreaming about the child's future, with life bathed in sunshine.


But fate is unpredictable. John died in a horrific multi-car pileup,being the last car in the crash and thus held most responsible according to the laws at the time.


Even after his death, the injured drivers' families demanded compensation, ignoring the fact that the Thompson family wwas left with a widow and an orphan.


Lisa couldn't bear it and, pregnant with Emily,left Lindell Harbor for Pearl Peak City, stepping onto unfamiliar ground with fear and uncertainty about the future, all for her child's peace.


In her youth, Lisa was fair-skinned, with red lips, tall and graceful,attracting attention wherever she went.


Soon,she caught the eye of Brian Thompson, Gordon's biological father, who worked as a quality control inspector at IronForge Industries in Pearl Peak City.


Brian brought light into their lives. Though he was just an ordinary worker, his kindness and sense of responsibility brought warmth to their home.
After Emily was born, their family life got back on track. Brian treated Emily as his own, using his modest salary to support her education and extracurricular activities. Lisa often felt as if he were Emily's real father.
###Chapter 42 Just Friends

Emily didn't grow up with much money, but her house was always filled with laughter.

Brian would often bring her little snacks after work, and seeing her enjoy them made him smile.


Even though he didn't have much education, he had a special way of helping Emily with her homework, always cheering her on.


If it weren't for that one bad event, the family would have stayed happy together. Even in their tiny 600-square-foot house,Emily would have been content.


Later, her mom had to deal with neighbors gossiping, saying she was cursed and brought bad luck to her husband. Emily always stood up for her, often putting her hands on her hips and arguing with people in the yard.

These memories, both sweet and bitter, became part of her life,shaping her resilience and determination.


Melissa said, "Emily, I noticed you've been daydreaming. I juast asked about your plans. why aren't you saying anything?"

Melissa's voice snapped Emily back to reality.

Emily laughed,hugging Melissa's shoulders. "You genius bestie,thanks for the reminder. I almost forgot I had this skill."

Her eyes sparkled with confidence, like she saw a beacon of hope in
the darkness. If it weren't for Melissa's mention, she might have forgotten her old dream.

Melissa asked, "Huh? What skill?"


Emily's sudden enthusiasm left Melissa puzzled, not understanding how she had become a genius.


Emily jumped up, waving her arms excitedly. "You're right, I have a skill. Why worry about starving? Even if I don't work as Patrick's secretary, I can still make it in Pearl Peak City. Ican design jewelry!"She was full of energy, pacing around the room, already envisioning her future creations.


Melissa's eyes lit up. "Yes! You always had a talent for design in college!" She grabbed Emily's hand. "It's a shame you insisted on being Patrick's secretary back then. Well, after serving him for years,you've finally come to your senses. A woman needs her own career."She was thrilled, as if she was about to become a top designer, her face beaming with joy.


"How about this? I'll invest in a studio for you in Pearl Peak City. I'll be the silent partner, and you can be the boss," Melissa suggested.

Emily shook her finger. "Great idea, but not just yet. Starting a studio without any work to show for it would be a sure loss." She analyzed calmly, knowing that starting a business required more than just passion; it needed thorough preparation.


Melissa meant well, but Emily didn't want to drag her into a risky venture. Success would be great, but failure would leave Melissa
feeling guilty and heartbroken.

Melissa stood up. hands on her hips. not buying it. "Why not? I'm a customer, and I love all the jewelry you design. I'd buy everything."

Emily laughed, a bit exasperated. "You can't be both the boss and the customer. Why even open a studio? I could just design at home and make pieces for you. Wouldn't that still mean you're supporting me?"She appreciated Melissa's genuine help, but she wanted to make a name for herself in the jewelry design world on her own.

Melissa scratched her head. "Alright, so what do you want to do?"


Emily spun around, an idea forming. "I have a friend who used to be a client of The Rivera Group. The Hughes Family is in the jewelry business, and about a third of the mall counters are theirs. I want to intern at his company, start as a jewelry designer, and once I can design award-winning pieces and build a reputation, then we can open a studio. That way, we can have both fame and fortune without risking your investment." Her eyes gleamed with determination.Success required honing one's skills, and blind entrepreneurship was foolish.


Melissa clapped her hands. "You're a genius, using someone else's company to gain experience. Do I know this friend?"

Emily shook her head. "You probably don't. He's Patrick's arch-nemesis. I'll introduce you sometime; he's quite interesting. But don't fall for him easily; he's a notorious playboy in Pearl Peak City."

Melissa rubbed her chin, eyeing Emily suspiciously. "How do you
know he's a playboy? Did he hit on you?"

Emily coughed awkwardly. Marlon's image flashing in her mind.

She wasn't sure if his previous attentions counted as hitting on her.but she was certain he had feelings for her.

However, she had never considered him as a romantic option or accepted his feelings. After leaving Patrick, she hadn't thought about finding another man. Maybe that day would come, but not now.

Shaking her head, she pulled out her phone and dialed Marlon's number. His deep, pleasant voice came through in two seconds."Emily,calling so soon? Miss me already?"

Seeing Melissa's teasing expression, Emily quickly covered the receiver and spoke softly. "Talk properly, Marlon. We're just friends."

"Yes, we're just friends. So, my friend, what can I do for you?"Marlon asked.
###Chapter 43 Zola and Patrick

Emily knew Marlon was a jokester, but his genuine nature made it hard for her to dislike him. People warned her to steer clear of Marlon, calling him a playboy.


But Emily felt a lot of warmth and support from Marlon.Whenever she was in a jam, he was the first to help. He could've taken advantage of situations but always showed respect. She wanted to be real friends with him.


With a hint of shyness and apology, Emily said, "You once invited me to work at The Hughes Group. Is that offer still open?"

Marlon was thrilled. His dream girl wanted to be near him!

Trying to contain his excitement, he said, "I'd love that! When can you start? This afternoon? Should I pick you up?"

Emily glanced at her phone. It was already 6:30 PM. Who starts work at this hour?


She chuckled and said, "Tomorrow. I'll come to The Hughes Group at 8:30 in the morning."

Marlon replied, "Great, I'll be waiting for you at 8:30 AM.Don't be late."


Marlon didn't even ask what position she was applying for; he just eagerly agreed.

Melissa, who had been watching, was stunned."Emily,I
underestimated you. You have some serious connections. You just landed a job like that?"


Emily turned to Melissa and said, "Ill cook for you. You've been helping me move these past few days."


Melissa leaned on Emily's shoulder. "It's no trouble. You can help me move too. I bought the apartment across the hall. We're neighbors now."


Emily pretended to be upset. "Looks like I've become someone's personal chef. Woe is me."


They laughed and joked in the new apartment, their laughter filling the room. Their friendship, like the new home, was full of life and hope.


Emily was lost in happy thoughts, unaware of the angry man outside the building where she used to live.


Patrick stood at the iron gate, banging until his hand was swollen. "Emily! I know you're in there! Come out! I didn't approve your resignation. You're still an employee of the Rivera Group!"


The lazy afternoon sun did nothing to ease Patrick's anxiety and frustration.


His knocking was loud and aggressive. If it weren't for that, no one would have dared to stop him.

Zola, who had a habit of taking afternoon naps, was about to sleep when the noise from upstairs became unbearable. She tried to ignore
it. but it only got louder.

"Who the hell is making all that noise?"

Grumbling. Zola, with her curly hair and indistinguishable-colored pajamas, grabbed a fly swatter and shuffled to the door in her slippers.


"Stop it! Even if the person is in there, they won't open the door with you banging like that. Are you a debt collector? No one here has money. You won't get anything!" Zola glared at Patrick with fierce eyes.


Patrick was taken aback by the aggressive middle-aged woman. He frowned, his impatience growing, but he was more concerned about Emily's whereabouts and held back his anger.


Seeing that she had him rattled, Zola pressed on, "What are you staring at? Never seen a beautiful woman before? Look, no matter how good-looking you think you are, it won't impress me. I'm well past menopause, so save your charm for someone else. If you keep causing a scene, I'll call the cops. They've been keeping a close watch on our neighborhood lately, and trust me, I'm not scared."

She waved the fly swatter like a weapon, ready to defend against any intruder.


Patrick sighed in frustration. He didn't have time to argue with Zola.Instead of finding Emily, he was dealing with a neurotic, disheveled woman.

"Are you saying no one is inside?" Patrick squinted, his hoarse voice
barely containing his anger. His eyes were filled with urgency and worry for Emily.


Zola noticed that despite his casual attire, Patrick had an air of sophistication. His well-tailored shirt and diamond cuffs indicated status.


Men of such quality were rare in the building. Zola thought of Emily and guessed he might be her boyfriend.

Thinking of this, Zola's eyes twinkled. "Why should I tell you? Who are you?" She asked, hands on her hips, her scrutinizing gaze making Patrick uncomfortable, as if he were being appraised.


Patrick didn't want to waste time. He pulled out a wad of cash and handed it to her.


Zola's eyes lit up. After a moment's hesitation, she said, "That's not enough. You need to add more."


Patrick cursed under his breath, thinking how greedy people in this neighborhood were, just like Emily.


But he needed to know where Emily was. Frustrated, he threw all the money in his wallet at Zola.


Zola picked up the money, checked its authenticity, and happily stuffed it into her pajama pocket. Her tone shifted from cold and angry to warm and fawning. "What's your name,handsome?"

Patrick was taken aback. "What's it to you?"
###Chapter 44 Starting Over

Zola scoffed. "With a temper like that, I think I'll call you Mr.Grumpy. How's that sound?"


Even the toughest folks in the world are scared of a sharp-tongued woman, especially one who's been sparring with her mother-in-law for thirty years.

"My last name is Rivera," Patrick snapped.

Zola nodded. satisfied. "That's better. Young people should be polite.Emily can be pretty rude when arguing, but she's usually very polite otherwise."


"So, you're Emily's friend," Patrick said, his patience wearing thin. He just wanted to know where Emily was, not get into personal chit-chat.

"Spit it out! Where did she go?" Patrick growled, barely containing his anger, with a hint of threat in his voice.


Zola noticed people in the courtyard looking over and, fearing she wouldn't get her information fee, quickly stepped forward. Patrick raised a hand to stop her. "Stay there and tell me the truth."


Zola smoothed her hair and whispered, "Emily moved out. She bought a new house somewhere. She came back a few days ago but didn't go inside. Something happened in the neighborhood..."

Patrick tensed up and asked, "What happened?"

Zola's eyes darted around, and she lowered her voice, "Ill tell you,
but don't spread it around. It's been kept quiet by the authorities.Some jerk spilled a large amount of cooking oil on the stairs. Several people fell and got seriously injured. An old man even died!"

She patted her chest as if still shaken, "His son was heartbroken. The police investigated for a long time but found nothing.The neighborhood is old and doesn't have security cameras. No one knows if it was an accident or a deliberate act. There's talk of a psycho killer."


Seeing Patrick unmoved, Zola felt disdain but continued eagerly, "Everyone in the neighborhood is scared. The community committee paid hush money to keep it quiet. I'm only telling you."

Zola felt lucky she hadn't gotten up early that day, or she might have been another victim.


Patrick initially thought it might be related to Emily, but lost interest when he realized it wasn't. His mind was solely focused on finding Emily.


As Patrick started to leave, Zola muttered, "Poor thing. If a pregnant woman had fallen, it would have been two lives lost."


Patrick paused at her words, a flicker of concern crossing his face,but he turned and left. He had to find Emily. She wasn't in the slums or her apartment,so where could she be?


Emily wasn't a local. Her mother had brought her to Pearl Peak City to start a new family. She had no relatives here, and her grandparents hadn't been in touch for years.
Patrick leaned against his Maybach, legs crossed, lightly scratching the bandage on his wrist, still healing from a car accident. He stared into the distance, lost in thought.

What had happened to Emily? Why had she disappeared?

Patrick couldn't believe she would leave without a word. He had to find out the truth.


Emily could only be in two places. Her best friend Melissa lived in Silverbrook. Patrick had his assistant check, and Melissa had also been missing for over ten days, likely disappearing with Emily.

Patrick considered that Emily might have gone to Marlon, but he couldn't believe she would betray him.


A Maybach was parked outside the Hughes Group building from ten in the morning until four in the afternoon. Whenever security attempted to chase it away, they were handed two dollar bills, but after one round, no one dared to try again.


The car stood out in the sunlight, its luxury clashing with the surroundings, signaling the owner's determination and status.

The Hughes Group's second-floor dining area had floor-to-ceiling windows, offering a great view and a place for busy employees to relax.


Emily arrived at The Hughes Group at eight-thirty sharp. Marlon was already waiting, impeccably dressed, with a smile and a look of joyful anticipation. Seeing her made his world light up.
Emily insisted on going through the proper channels. so Marlon called the HR manager for an interview. When he heard Emily was applying for a jewelry design intern assistant position, he was stunned, "What? You're here for an assistant job? An intern?"


In the company, assistants didn't hold high positions. Regular assistants were second-in-command, and interns had even less status.


The company often hired batches of interns, sometimes ten or even a hundred, but only about ten percent were eventually hired. The acceptance rate was low.


Aside from recent graduates, most people with a few years of work experience didn't want to be interns, mainly because they couldn't endure six months of poor treatment and humiliation.
###Chapter 45 Patrick Comes to Visit

Emily used to be the executive assistant to the president of the Rivera Group, a pretty sweet gig. Now, she was willing to ditch her status to work as an intern assistant, which made Marlon both admire and feel sorry for her.


He knew Emily was stubborn, and once she made up her mind,there was no changing it. All he could do was support her quietly, hoping she'd find happiness at the company.


The afternoon sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled patterns on the restaurant's floor-to-ceiling windows. The light spots fell on the tables, the floor, and the people, making the whole place seem bathed in a golden glow, warm and romantic.

Patrick looked up and saw Emily in the sunlight, looking like a pure angel.


Her skin was smooth and delicate, her face stunningly beautiful. She wore a well-fitted business suit that showed off her graceful legs,exuding a captivating charm that drew everyone's attention, including Patrick's.


Patrick suddenly slammed his hand against the car door! He glared at Marlon, who was pulling out a chair for Emily, filled with jealousy and anger. How dare she? What did Marlon have that he didn't? He wasn't as tall, handsome, or wealthy as Patrick. Was Emily blind?

Or had they already slept together?

No!
Patrick believed that in the bedroom, he couldn't possibly lose!

Patrick lit a cigarette, trying to calm his rage and jealousy. He took a deep drag, his eyes growing more determined through the smoke. He had to confront Emily and get to the bottom of this. He couldn't tell if he liked or loved her; he just knew he couldn't lose her.


Emily watched Marlon eagerly fetching food and leaned closer,embarrassed. "That's enough, why are you getting so much food? I'm here for afternoon tea, not a buffet. I can't take it all back to my desk,and there are colleagues around."


Her face showed a mix of shyness and helplessness. She just wanted to work quietly without drawing attention.

Marlon smiled, touched his nose, and glanced around, causing the murmurs to stop abruptly.


Despite his playful demeanor, he had an air of authority. As the president of The Hughes Group, he could make anyone leave on the spot.

People were curious but didn't want to lose their jobs.

Emily was exceptionally beautiful and well-known as The Rivera Group's "golden assistant," capable of handling projects and clients with ease. Some gossiped that she used her looks to secure contracts,but despite their jealousy, it balanced out the fact that she was too perfect-beautiful, educated, eloquent, and highly competent, which was hard for others to accept.

After enjoying a luxurious afternoon tea, Marlon mentioned he had to
leave for something.

Emily sat alone, reflecting on her decision to join the Hughes Group as an intern assistant. She was determined to prove her abilities and succeed anywhere.


As she prepared to take the elevator back to the 17th floor,someone grabbed her hand in the stairwell. Instinctively, she raised her leg and screamed, but the person seemed to know her well, pinning her knees with his legs, covering her mouth and nose with one hand, and wrapping an arm around her neck. She was immobilized,filled with fear and surprise. not knowing who it was.

Smelling the familiar scent, Emily realized it was Patrick. A mix of anger, helplessness, and a hint of excitement surged within her.

Patrick released her when he felt her relax, but Emily immediately bit down on an old wound on his arm, causing it to bleed. Patrick cried out in pain, his anger boiling over. He grabbed her neck and pressed her against the wall. "Do you hate me that much? Do you wish I were dead?"


Pinned against the wall, Emily couldn't move. She instinctively slapped at Patrick, targeting his face and arms, her only concern being the safety of her child.


Patrick, provoked, grabbed the back of her neck and kissed her forcefully, binding her hands behind her back with his other hand.Tears streamed down Emily's face, her breathing rapid, her cheeks flushed. Patrick's lower body reacted as well.
"Patrick, you're crazy! Let me go." Emily was terrified, her voice trembling,echoing in the silent stairwell. Her eyes were wide with fear and disbelief.

She never expected Patrick to show up here and lose control.

Feeling Patrick's erection against her thigh, she turned pale with fear.If anything inappropriate happened here and got out, the consequences would be dire. She would become the center of attention in The Hughes Group, the subject of everyone's gossip.
###Chapter 46 Patrick's Jealousy

If word got out, Emily would be hit like a ton of bricks, leaving her floundering in her new surroundings.


Acting out at someone else's company? Bad move. Was she trying to tank the Hughes Group's stock?

Emily fought to break free, but Patrick's grip was like iron.

Patrick's voice was rough as he whispered, "Don't move. You know if you keep struggling, I might actually do something right here."

He breathed near her ear, his warm breath making Emily fee1 both disgusted and terrified. She shuddered involuntarily, as if she could smell the breath of a demon.


Seeing the desire creeping onto Patrick's face, Emily dared not move.She pleaded softly, "Mr. Rivera, can't you just let me go?"

Her eyes filled with helpless despair, swallowing all hope.

All she wanted was to escape from Patrick, start a new life, and stay far away from this man who was a mix of love and hatred.


"No way!" Patrick's response came through gritted teeth, filled with anger and determination. "Why should I let you go just because you say so? You're mine! I don't agree to this, so you're not going anywhere-not even a step! You better stay by my side, no matter what!"


His eyes were full of crazed possessiveness, like flames ready to
consume Emily.

He wouldn't allow Emily to leave, seeing her as his property,not to be coveted by anyone else.


Emily closed her eyes, fearing her anger might reveal her pregnancy.If Patrick found out, he'd force her to have an abortion. She had already decided to keep the baby and didn't want Patrick to interfere.


Her heart was in turmoil, filled with fear and loathing for Patrick,but also a protective hope for her child.


Seeing Emily avoid his gaze, Patrick's anger flared. His face turned ashen, veins bulging on his forehead. He grabbed her cheek tightly.causing intense pain.


Patrick glared at her, his voice low and menacing. "Look at me! You can't even spare me a glance now? What's the deal? Now that you're cozying up to Marlon, you've got no room for any other man? You were anything but faithful when you were with me, so don't pretend you want to be loyal to him now. Let me tell you, that's not happening!"

His words were full of insult and jealousy, stabbing at Emily like a knife. He glared at her, his eyes blazing with anger, jealousy、and resentment.


Emily listened to his humiliating words, her veins throbbing with anger. Tears welled up, but she held them back, refusing to let them fall, a final act of defiance.

She mustered all her strength to pry Patrick's hand off her face and
slapped him hard. The sound echoed in the stairwell,breaking the silence.


Patrick turned his head in shock, using his tongue to probe his teeth,spitting out blood-tinged saliva. He said quietly, "You dare to hit me?1


Like an enraged beast, he grabbed Emily's hair, forcing her face up.

Emily bit her lip stubbornly, refusing to cry out in pain, her lips turning white in defiance.


Patrick, standing at 6-foot-1, looked down at the barely 5-foot-5Emily, pulling her close to his chest. The pressure was overwhelming.making it hard for her to breathe.


"I'm telling you, Emily, don't make me angry, or I'll take the Hughes Group down with you!"

Patrick's eyes narrowed like an enraged lion, his hot breath on Emily's face made her shiver uncontrollably, herbody trembling as if facing a fierce beast, powerless to resist.

"Don't think you can provoke me easily. The money, time, and effort I've spent on you over the years and your drug-addicted mother, who do you think supported all that? Now you want to leave, found a new backer? Think climbing into someone else's bed will get you the same treatment? Don't come crawling back to me when they kick you out. I have standards."


Patrick's roar was like a knife to Emily's heart, exposing her deepest wounds, making her feel unbearable pain.
Emily used all her strength to pull her hair free, stomping hard on Patrick's foot, struggling with every ounce of her being.

Patrick let go due to the pain.

At that moment, Emily seemed to have exhausted all her strength,her body trembling slightly, breathing heavily, but her eyes were firm and resolute.


Patrick glared at Emily like an enraged beast. "Are you really not coming back with me?" Emily lifted her head stubbornly and said,"Even if you kill me today, I'm not going back. It's over. You despised me when I was with you, and now that I want to leave, you come after me. What do you want?"

Her voice trembled but was strong, a cry for freedom and dignity.

Patrick sneered, looking Emily up and down. "If you can be here today, you'll be in someone else's bed tonight. Emily, you really disgust me. You're just a whore."

His words grew more venomous, trying to hurt Emily enough to make her return to him, his eyes full of disdain and mockery, as if she was worthless.


After speaking, Patrick turned and left through the fire exit. The sound of the door closing startled Emily, making her heart tremble.
###Chapter 47 The Hughes Group Couldn'Match The Rivera Group

The sound hit Emily like a punch to the gut. She never thought that all those years of love and dedication would be seen as a burden and disgrace in Patrick's eyes.

Tears streamed down her face as her world fell apart.

Maybe, in his mind, she was just a high-priced call girl, always at his beck and call,ready to work or sleep with him.

His furious outburst was just him losing control.

Emily's heart ached with helplessness, her life plunged into darkness. She slid down against the fire exit door, hugging her knees and burying her head, her tears soaking her clothes, her body trembling as waves of sorrow washed over her.

After a while, a dull pain in her stomach made her stop crying and wipe her tears, forcing herself to calm down. She thought,'I can't be weak, I can't cry. I have a baby now. I have to be strong. Patrick's words mean nothing.'

Her eyes gradually showed a determined gentleness,the power of a mother's love.


Emily braced herself against the wall and stood up. Once the pain in her stomach subsided a bit, she took a deep breath and noticed a few drops of fresh blood where Patrick had been
standing.

After regaining her composure, she patted her face to look natural and returned to her desk upstairs, facing curious and suspicious glances from her colleagues. She knew it would be hard to hide what had happened with Patrick. Her coworkers'eyes were probing, doubtful, and even hostile, but she decided to ignore them. She would prove herself with her abilities,start anew in this environment, and create a future for her child,unafraid of the thorns and obstacles ahead.


Emily quickly calmed herself, ready to face the rumors and doubts alone.


When Marlon returned to the Hughes Group, sunlight cast shadows on the ground.

He wore a light gray plaid suit, exuding an extraordinary aura,holding a royal blue velvet box.

His steps were hurried, the sound of his leather shoes quickening,his heartbeat accelerating. The employees' murmurs made him uneasy. He glanced around, and those who met his gaze quickly looked down, pretending nothing had happened.

Pushing open the door, he saw the bruises on Emily's neck.Marlon's heart tightened, his breath catching. The bruises were glaringly obvious against her smooth skin.

"Emily, what happened to you?" Marlon asked.
He rushed forward to check her injuries, his eyes full of concern and anxiety. But Emily stood up and took a step back.avoiding his hand, her movements stiff, her eyes filled with panic and embarrassment.

Marlon pulled back, feeling awkward and worried. His hand trembled slightly before he placed it on the table, coughing twice,feeling helpless.

"What happened? It doesn't look like you just fell," he asked.his voice filled with confusion. Marlon thought,'How could she have gotten hurt in just half an hour? Could there be bullying in the company?' He felt like he had made a mistake by bringing her here to protect her.

Emily knew he misunderstood. She calmly poured water and placed it on the table, speaking in a low, steady voice,suppressingthe turmoil inside her. "Patrick came to see me just now."


Marlon felt a surge of guilt and anger. He blamed himself for being apart from Emily, giving Patrick the opportunity.His hands clenched tightly, his nails digging into his palms. Anger burned in his heart. He couldn't understand why Patrick didn't cherish her. Even he, a notorious playboy, would never hit a woman. How could Patrick be like this?


His eyes were filled with anger and pity for Emily.
Marlon had known Patrick since childhood. Jennifer took him to high society events, and Patrick often visited the Hughes family. The Hughes family matriarch, Hannah Hughes, liked him for his good grades, discipline,and manners.

Marlon, on the other hand, was carefree and disliked studying,often being compared to Patrick by his family, which annoyed him. Later, Patrick met Emily and fell in love with her at first sight.

Patrick was domineering and wouldn't let anyone else have his prize. Back then, Emily only had eyes for Patrick.

Marlon had once sent flowers to Emily in college, only to be rejected. He then vowed to protect her silently.

The Hughes family had built their fortune in the jewelry business, leading the industry in Pearl Peak City. Their family reputation and wealth were illustrious, with each piece of jewelry being a work of art, carrying the honor of their legacy.

The Rivera Group, however, had a broader range of industries,including smart robotics, chip manufacturing, real estate,automotive, and medical devices, dominating various fields like a commercial giant. In terms of scale, five Hughes Groups couldn't match one Rivera Group. Marlon could only swallow his pride and try to calm his turbulent emotions.
###Chapter 48 Tears of Elegance Col lecti on

Marlon slowly opened the box in his hands.

A set of deep blue jewelry appeared before Emily's eyes.enchanting and profound. like the depths of the ocean, hiding countless stories and emotions.


Each gem sparkled with a unique light, reflecting off one another, dreamlike and magical.

Emily asked, "What is this?"

She gasped, her eyes filled with surprise and admiration. She recognized it as the jewelry that won the Most Collectible Award at last year's Veridian International Exhibition. After the show,it disappeared,bought by The Hughes Group.

Seeing Emily's fascination, Marlon gently pushed the velvet box towards her and said. "It's for you."

His voice was gentle yet firm, as if he had thought it through.Emily stepped back in shock, "For me?"

Her eyes widened with surprise and confusion. Even though she wasn't in the industry last year, she knew this jewelry had dominated fashion and top jewelry magazine covers.

This set of Tears of Elegance Collection was priceless. Each year,
only one piece of jewelry received this honor, often bought for collection and treasured.

Its design, collectibility, and fame made it invaluable.

Emily knew that after it won the gold award, someone offered $200 million to buy it, but the final price was unknown.She quickly closed the box, resisting the urge to accept it,her hands trembling as if holding a bomb.

She wondered how Marlon could casually take out such a valuable item. Shouldn't it be under heavy security?

Rumors of spending a fortune for a woman's smile weren't false; Marlon's dedication to her was beyond imagination.

Emily pushed the box back to Marlon, "It's called the Tears of Elegance Collection,right?"

Her voice was soft.

Marlon nodded, "I think the name doesn't suit me. I don't like seeing women cry. Giving you this jewelry, I hope you never cry for anyone again because you have the Tears of Elegance Collection."

His eyes were gentle and sincere.

Anyone would be moved by these words, especially since this wasn't a small amount, and even the Hughes Family couldn't
casually take it out.

Emily smiled but spoke seriously, "I can't accept this jewelry.We're just friends, and I'm your employee. I can't accept such an expensive gift. I want our relationship to be based on equality and respect. I came here to get away from Patrick.Do you want to become another Patrick?"

Her eyes were firm and clear, her determination undeniable.

She knew she couldn't accept it, given its value and not wanting to complicate her emotional life. Besides, she hadn't developed feelings for Marlon and felt unworthy of his sincerity.

Marlon quickly caught himself, realizing how presumptuous he sounded. He waved his hand and said, "No, Emily, don't think like that. I'm not like Patrick. He never knew how to appreciate you the way you deserve. I really like you! Do you honestly believe my reputation is that bad?"

His eyes were eager and hopeful, wishing Emily would understand his feelings.

"My family keeps arranging blind dates for me. I got so annoyed that I started partying and drinking, but I was never serious. I always went home on time. It was all fake. Please believe me."


Marlon anxiously explained, his face turning red. Emily felt he was different from before.
Despite his bad reputation, Marlon was a young man in his mid-twenties.


After spending time with him, Emily discovered the playboy rumors were false; there were no women around him. It showed that the gossip about wealthy families couldn't be trusted.


Marlon's words moved Emily. It was true that you couldn't judge a book by its cover; Marlon was sincere and straightforward.

Emily smiled and handed back the Tears of Elegance Collection,"No matter what, this jewelry has speciaI significance to your family. Can I really keep it safe? Do you want me to get assassinated for wearing it out?"

Her tone was light and humorous, easing the awkward atmosphere.

Marlon was stunned. Indeed, as Emily said, this top-tier jewelry was kept in a century-old safe at home. Wherever she took it, it would be troublesome.

He realized that his actions might have been too hasty.

Marlon thought, if Emily married him, giving her the jewelry would mean it had a home.

With that thought, a smile crept onto his face, filled with shy
anticipation, as if seeing a beautiful future.

Emily saw Marlon's silly smile and was taken aback, finding him more genuine. This silly look seemed familiar.

She suddenly thought of a quirky girl she knew and considered introducing them as friends.

Marlon and Melissa might have an interesting reaction.
###Chapter 49 Baby, What Should Momm Do

Emily watched Marlon leave and wandered over to the big window in her office. She stared down at the busy city streets.feeling all sorts of emotions.

Outside, people were rushing around, cars were honking, but she felt stuck in her own mess.


She rubbed her neck gently, still feeling a bit of pain. It wasn't just physical; it was emotional too.

Every time she touched the bruise, she remembered Patrick's angry outbursts. He was never kind.

Patrick probably went to the Hughes Group after not finding her in the city.

She couldn't let him know she had bought a house in the suburbs, or he'd never leave her alone.


Thinking back, Emily had chased Patrick for a long time before they got together. She was young and thought Patrick was the most important person in her life. She didn't care about having a title, thinking she could win him over.

But then Shirley came along, always getting in the way. Patrick's favoritism and indifference hurt Emily deeply. HIer pride and self-respect were worn down as she lost her place in Patrick's
heart.

Now, with Patrick's child, she wanted to be there for the baby,to raise the child and find the love she never got from Patrick.

Thinking about this, Emily lightly tapped her forehead.mocking herself for being crazy.

She had just been yelled at and hit by Patrick,yet here she was thinking about him again. She felt pathetic, but she couldn't help it. She was a hopeless romantic and didn't know what to do.

She spoke softly to her belly, "Baby, what should Mommy do?"

Even though the baby was small, she felt a special connection and wanted to create a beautiful future for the child, free from pain and Patrick.

Emily hugged herself, rememnbering how Patrick had stormed out, bleeding, without letting her ask what happened. She knew if it had been Shirley, Patrick would have comforted her instead.


Emily felt a deep sadness, wondering how many times it would take to give up on Patrick. Every time he showed a bit of kindness, she would soften.

She closed her eyes, trying to push thoughts of Patrick away,determined to focus on her work and repay Marlon for his
support. Relying on a man wasn't a long-term solution;she needed to prove her worth through her abilities.

Emily cleared her mind, opened her laptop, and prepared to dive into work.


Starlight University was a top-tier school, and she had graduated with the highest honors in her design program.despite switching majors. She had a natural talent and a knack for developing computer algorithms.

Her fingers danced across the keyboard like a pianist, quickly bringing her design to life.

She could draw parallels and contrasts from the database to avoid clichés, knowing that originality was crucial in jewelry design. She couldn't afford to be accused of copying.Immersed in her work, she forgot everything else around her.

Marlon leaned against the window outside Emily's office,watching her work with a sigh. "Patrick, you've really put me in a tough spot. Coming to my company and attacking my employee, should I fight back?"

He felt frustrated and helpless.

Marlon remembered his mother, Robyn Hughes, urging him to study and manage the company when he was younger.He had always thought she was nagging and had been complacent,lacking ambition. Now, seeing the Rivera Family's assets far
surpassing his own, he realized how naive he had been. He understood that hard work and ambition were essential to succeed in the business world.


He smiled bitterly, finally understanding that working hard wasn't just for the family, but also to protect the woman he loved. Yet, facing Patrick, he lacked the courage to protest.

Marlon sighed, turned away from Emily's office door,and silently vowed to become stronger, for himself and to protect Emily.

Sunlight streamed down the hallway as Marlon's figure receded,while Emily remained focused on her work in the office.

What they didn't know was that after Patrick's visit to the Hughes Group, rumors about Emily had spread like wildfire.After all, the fire escape wasn't deserted, and the door didn't muffle sound.
###Chapter 50 Patrick's Friends

In the Twilight Enchantment Lounge of Pearl Peak City,Patrick was knocking back glass after glass of some crimson drink. A freckled waitress with a ponytail nervously kept his drinks coming, since he'd scared off all the glamorous girls,leaving just her.

"Who ticked off Mr. Rivera?" Vincent Watson teased, breaking the silence. He leaned back on the sofa, a mischievous grin on his face, clearly ready for some drama.

Willard Ramirez chimed in, "Why's Patrick drinking alone and not calling us? If Otis hadn't spotted you, we'd be clueless.What's the deal? Emily not around?"

Willard walked over to Patrick, a concerned smile on his face.They'd been in neighboring classes in high school and became friends after a fight over a love letter. Patrick hadn't backed down despite being outnumbered, and they'd been tight ever since.


At the mention of Emily, Patrick slammed his glass down,shattering it andd scaring the waitress to tears.

Patrick's face darkened, a mix of anger, helplessness, and pain.He clenched his fists, knuckles turning white,trying to keep it together.

Vincent,legs crossed,clung to the sofa, staring at Patrick. "Mr.
Rivera really don't know how to treat a lady! Why isn't Emily here? Bet you drove her away, huh? Emily's got a great personality,and you don't appreciate her. Serves you right!"

His words dripped with sarcasm and frustration, watching Patrick's reaction with a smirk.


Willard saw Patrick's grim expression and knew Vincent had hit a nerve. Even though they thought Emily wasn't the best match for Patrick, they enjoyed the attention from a beautiful woman. Emily was smart, pretty, obedient, and capable-who wouldn't want that?


They were used to having her around, and her absence felt weird.


Willard shook his head, sighed, and went back to the sofa to light up a smoke.

Otis Patterson, the club owner, was older and more composed.He clapped his hands, letting the waitress go, and handed Patrick a fresh glass of whiskey. "If something's bugging you,just spill it. If we can help, we will."

Otis's tone was steady and reliable. The Patterson family had connections with high-ranking military figures. Even though he couldn't join the military or politics, he still contributed to the family. In this chaotic place, information was everywhere. He looked at Patrick with concern, not great at expressing himself,
but trying to comfort him.

Patrick stayed silent, and Otis knew it wasn't business troubles.

Vincent loosened his tie and unbuttoned his shirt, the black fabric gleaming with quality. His family had been in trade for generations.

Vincent leaned back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling with a dreamy look, a smile on his lips. He was wild and unrestrained,charming many girls, but not Emily.

He swirled his glass, the ice clinking.

Vincent had once asked Patrick for Emily. He liked girls like Emily-high achievers, smart, beautiful, ambitious, and with a great figure. Despite being only 5-foot-5, her legs were over 3-foot-7 long.

To get Emily, Vincent had offered mansions, luxury cars,stocks,and even a foreign trade company, but Patrick had refused.

Vincent almost thought Emily was special to Patrick, but seeing Patrick's repeated violence towards her, he realized Patrick just wanted control.


There was no true love!

Vincent's eyes flashed with regret as he drank, mocking himself.

No matter, he had patience.
###Chapter 51 The Unattractive Scheming Woman

Vincent had a reputation for being a ladies' man, way more than Marlon, who might seem like a player but was actually pretty loyal. Out of the four guys in Pearl Peak City, Vincent was the real deal when it came to being a playboy. He confessed that his desire for Emily eclipsed his admiration, yet he resolved not to make a move as long as she was with Patrick. However, if there ever came a day when Patrick no longer wanted her, he would definitely make his move.

Once, Vincent tried to play the good guy and told Patrick to appreciate Emily. But Patrick didn't take him seriously.Vincent watched Patrick down drink after drink, feeling a weird sense of satisfaction. Even someone as proud as Patrick had fallen for Emily.

Willard, noticing Vincent's smirk, shook his head, lit a cigarette,and handed it to Patrick. "If you like her,go for it. Why drown your sorrows here? If you can't man up, I'll go get her for you. And if that doesn't work, I'll take more drastic measures."


Willard wwas perpetually impulsive and reckless, as if he would genuinely follow through with it simply at Patrick's request.His eyes held a foolish kind of determination, echoing the spirit of his high school days.
"Willard, don't even think about it! How could you hurt someone as beautiful as Emily? Come on. you guys really need to step up your game when it comes to appreciating women!"Vincent scolded, pointing a finger at Willard. He was clearly pissed off at Willard's suggestion.

Vincent feigned indignation, hurling insults that merely elicited Otis' swift grip around his neck. pressing down with considerable force, before compelling him to drink a cup of wine.

In Vincent's mind. he regarded the argument as a victory.convinced that the three opponents before him were no match for his wit. Yet, when it came to physical prowess, he knew he fell short of even half of Otis'strength.

Seeing Patrick stay silent, Vincent lost interest in coming up with ideas for him and opened a bottle of Romanée-Conti,sulking on the side. Willard poured himself a glass of wine,downed it, and slammed the glass on the table.

Otis, who rarely spoke, was about to say something to comfort Patrick when the door to their private room swung open. This room,labeled 999, was Otis's exclusive hangout, usually just for the four of them. Who would be dumb enough to barge in?

Willard raised an eyebrow, kicked his legs up, and let his cigarette dangle fromn his mouth, looking like he was ready to throw down. His eyes were filled with dissatisfaction; he hated
when their hangouts got interrupted.

When Vincent saw it was Shirley, he burst out laughing. "One follower leaves, another one shows up?" His laugh was dripping with mockery, making it clear he wasn't thrilled to see her. Vincent looked at Shirley with disdain; he never liked her fake attitude.


Patrick glanced up and saw Shirley's panicked expression."What are you doing here?" he asked coldly, clearly not pleased.He furrowed his brow, feeling quite irritable at the moment.The appearance of Shirley only added to his agitation.

Shirley looked scared, took a few steps back, then gathered her courage. Clutching her bag tightly, she said softly,"Patrick,I worked late at the office today,and when I got back, I saw your car outside. It's late, and I thought it wouldn't be safe for me to walk back alone. Can I wait and ride back with you?"

Her eyes were full of hope and caution, like she was scared Patrick would say no. She lowered her head, fingers gripping her bag strap tightly. She knew Patrick's friends didn't like her,but she still wanted a chance to be with him.

Patrick thought for a moment, then nodded. "Sure," he said.sounding a bit perfunctory, like he was just going through the motions. He didn't really want Shirley to tag along, but he figured it wasn't safe for her to be out alone so late, so he agreed.
Vincent was taken aback when Shirley dared to ignore him. He stood up and said, "Playing the innocent angel. huh? You're pretty convincing." His words were laced with sarcasm, and his disdain for Shirley was palpable. Vincent walked over to Shirley.circling her and sizing her up and down.

Among Patrick's friends, Shirley liked Vincent the least.However, she had no way to avoid him. All of these friends came from well-known, prominent families in Pearl Peak City.and she even had a thought in her mind: if she couldn't marry Patrick by any means, marrying any one of these three would be a good choice. Shirley bit her lip, enduring the grievance in her heart, knowing she couldn't afford to offend any of them and had to swallow her pride.

Vincent paced around Shirley, his gaze sweeping over her with a critical eye. He turned to Patrick with a smirk. "So, this is your driver's daughter, huh? Is she just not developed yet, or is this her final form?"


He leaned in closer, his voice dripping with scorn. "Her figure is quite straight. Where's the charm that even comes close to Emily?"

"Honestly, sometimes I wonder if you're seeing things clearly.You've got a stunning girl right in front of you, yet you're pining after this plain one."

"You're completely oblivious, my friend. I'm honestly concerned
that your poor taste might influence me."

With every word, Vincent's disdain pierced through the air.mercilessly mocking Shirley's figure and presence. He shook his head in disbelief, a look of utter disgust etched on his face.

Shirley felt her heart sink as his words hit her like a cold wave.Tears welled up in her eyes, and she walked over to Patrick.her expression a mix of hurt and vulnerability. Crouching down,she rested her head on his knee, tilting her face up, allowing her tears to spill freely.

"Patrick, can we go back? It's so noisy here," she whispered,her voice trembling with emotion, desperately seeking his sympathy and attenton.

She looked up at him with wide, pleading eyes, hoping he would speak up for her,to shield her from the harshness of the world around them.

Vincent, on the other hand, couldn't stand Shirley. He thought she was scheming, always relying on men, and not even attractive. If she had Emily's looks, maybe her pretentiousness wouldn't be so bad.


Vincent poured himself another glass of wine with a sneer, not even bothering to look at Shirley anymore. Shirley couldn't understand why, despite always trying to get along with them,they still looked down on her. She thought to herself, 'It'sall
Emily's fault! Did she sleep with all these guys? Is that why they all like her?'

Shirley's nails dug into her flesh as she stared hatefully at Vincent's back. When Patrick looked over, she quickly put on a smile and tried to please Vincent. She was full of jealousy and resentment, feeling like Emily had stolen Patrick and his friends'attention, but she didn't dare show it. Instead, she silently cursed Emily in her heart.
###Chapter 52 Patrick's Strange Behavior

Otis turned his head away, pretending not to notice the scene where Shirley's expression had changed dramatically just moments ago. He scrunched up his eyebrows a bit, looking a tad annoyed. Even though Otis owned a nightclub, he just couldn't get into these women. What he really loved was drinking and boxing. You'd always find him at the bar or the boxing gym, but never in some woman's bed.

Otis thought women were mostly a hassle, especially Shirley,so he avoided her like the plague. He picked up his glass again,took a sip, and sat quietly on the side, as if the noise around him didn't exist.


Willard asked Patrick, "You didn't mention it earlier. Where's Emily? You two are usually inseparable. And with you drinking so much today, did you bring a driver? You're not planning to drive yourself back, are you?" Willard looked at Patrick with concern. He knew something was off with Patrick today, not just because Emily wasn't around, but there had to be more to it.


Shirley timidly raised her hand and murmured, "I can take Patrick home." Her eyes sparkled with anticipation, hoping Lu Wen would agree. She smiled, feeling it was a perfect chance to be alone with him.

Vincent smirked and said, "Oh, you can take Patrick home.Let
me guess, you want to take him to your own bed, right?" His words dripped with sarcasm, and he looked at Shirley with disdain. Vincent loved seeing Shirley in a tough spot, finding her obvious scheming laughable.


Vincent knew Shirley's game all too well. Sometimes he really wondered why Patrick always defended this annoying Shirley.Women like Emily were the ones worth protecting! It was even more frustrating that Patrick didn't like Emily but wouldn't let her go! Otherwise, he would've gone after Emily long ago.Vincent leaned back on the couch, his eyes showing disdain and confusion, not getting why Patrick was so conflicted about Emily, liking her but also hurting her, and now Emily had run off.


Today, he just wanted the answer to one question from Patrick's lips-whether he wanted Emily or not. Vincent thought to himself that if Patrick really gave up on Emily, he wouldn't hesitate to pursue her. After all, Emily was such a catch!

Patrick seemed to catch on to Vincent's thoughts, glared at him,and then said to Willard, "Don't you usually look down on Emily? Why are you so worried about her today? Or are you secretly in touch with her behind my back?" Patrick's eyes showed a hint of suspicion and dissatisfaction. He found Willard and Vincent's behavior odd today, suddenly so concerned about Emily's whereabouts.

Seeing Patrick lash out, Willard leaned back and remarked,"
Don't be ridiculous! I'm not into Emily. You should be askíng Vincent!" Willard glared at Patrick, thinking he was being unreasonable. How could he even think that?


Vincent nodded and expressed, "Yeah, I like Emily, Patrick.When you're done with her, just let me know. Even if I can't marry her, I want to keep her in my life." Vincent's face showed a hint of pride, deliberately saying this to provoke Patrick and see his reaction.


Patrick stood up, smashed his glass at Vincent's feet, and scolded, "How dare you!" He cannot fathom why, but upon hearing Vincent utter those words, he felt as though something of his had been seized. He would never let anyone take Emily away. Patrick's body trembled slightly. He had complicated feelings for Emily, and even though he couldn't explain them,he knew he couldn't let Vincent win.


Vincent shook his head, smiled, and remarked, "It's not that I don't dare, I just don't think it's worth it, Patrick. I won't ruin our friendship over a woman. You've had too much to drink today,go home with Shirley. I'm not interested in discussing an uncertain answer with you. Sorry, I have a date with a pretty woman tonight. Goodbye, everyone." Vincent waved and left the room, a relaxed smile on his face, feeling like he had achieved his goal for the day, at least letting Patrick know how he felt about Emily.

Watching Vincent's arrogant exit, Shirley became more
Cnapter 5z Patrick s Strange Behavior

convinced that Vincent must have slept with Emily. Otherwise,why would he always defend her? After the most annoying person left. Shirley slowly leaned against Patrick, putting his hand on her shoulder, and suggested, "Patrick, you've had too much to drink, let me take you back." Her voice was gentle and sweet, trying to win Patrick over.

Otis glanced at Shirley and said to Patrick, "I can have a driver take you back." He didn't trust Shirley to take Patrick home,finding her unreliable, and he didn't want anything to happen to Patrick.


Shirley got anxious when she heard this, stood up, and raised her hands, "No! Thank you, Otis. Let me take Patrick back to the Rivera Manor today. Jennifer misses him." Hearing Shirley mention Jennifer, Otis stopped talking. He sighed helplessly,knowing he couldn't stop Shirley.

Patrick was actually feeling very frustrated at that moment. He didn't really hear what everyone was saying around him, only catching Vincent saying he liked Emily. After Vincent left.Patrick felt like all the noise had nothing to do with him.

Patrick leaned against Shirley, feeling sick from the scent that wasn't hers.


'Damn it! How could I remember the smell of Emily? Isn't it just a habit by now? No way! I couldn't possibly like her! She was just an accessory in my life. Without me, what was she
even worth?'

After a moment of thought, he pushed away Shirley's support.opened the car door, got in, locked the door out of habit,reclined his seat, and fell asleep in the car. Patrick lay there,his brows furrowed, Emily's image constantly popping into his mind, trying hard not to think about it. Slowly, his breathing calmed down.
###Chapter 53 Letting Go of Distractions

Shirley was floored by the scene but didn't dare to slam the car door.She knew waking up Patrick, especially when he was drunk and cranky, wouald be a disaster.

Standing by Patrick's car, she whispered, "Patrick? Can you open the door and let me in? I'm still outside." Her voice was shaky and filled with anxiety as she stared at the car, feeling totally lost. Seeing no response from him, Shirley felt embarrassed as people around her started whispering. She felt like she was close to Patrick, yet somehow far away because she was unsure how to really get into his heart. When Patrick was sober, he was sweet to her, but once he drank, all he could think about was Emily.

At that moment, Shirley was burning with jealousy and resentment. She couldn't wrap her head around why Emily was so important to Patrick. She didn't think she was any less than Emily, so why did he care more about her?

Suddenly, Shirley remembered there was a key to Patrick's car at Emily's old apartment. Thinking Patrick wouldn't wake up anytime soon,she quickly hailed a cab to Emily's previous place. Sitting in the cab, Shirley was filled with anticipation,believing that getting the key would give her more chances to be with Patrick, maybe even make him like her. As she looked at the night scenery outside the window, she silently vowed to make Patrick her husband.
Not long after Shirley left, Patrick felt thirsty in the car and reached out to pat the passenger seat. calling out. "Emily.Give me a hangover cure pill. My head hurts! Can't you hear me?"

When no one responded, Patrick finally opened his eyes. He thought, 'Where is Emily? Could she be in another man's bed right now?' The thought of her pushing him away during the day and even biting him made Patrick even more irritable. He pounded the steering wheel several times, honking the horn loudly, startling pedestrians who cursed at him as they passed.

Patrick was convinced that Emily had betrayed him. But he couldn't understand why. He had given her a job, sent money to her mother in prison, and covered her brother's medical bills.What more did she want? Just an insatiable woman!

Or was she simply tired of him? Was that why she was ready to move on to Marlon?

Looking at his watch and realizing it was past midnight,Patrick remembered how angry he was when he went to find Emily earlier that day, wanting to bring her back to him. But what had he done? He had choked Emily. However, Emily would rather be choked by him than come back with him.

Leaning back in his seat, Patrick stared blankly ahead, feeling a mix of anger, self-blame, and regret. He knew his actions had hurt Emily, but he didn't know how to make amends. He felt like he might really lose Emily.
With these thoughts. Patrick's mind cleared up a bit. He opened the glove compartment and found the hangover cure pills that Emily habitually prepared for him, along with a bottle of water. He swallowed a few pills, leaned back in his seat to rest for a moment, then drove back onto the road.


Looking at the hangover cure pills in his hand. Patrick felt a weird sense of strangeness. He remembered how Emily used to be so obedient and thoughtful towards him, and her recent behavior was totally unexpected. If she wasn't seeing someone else, she wouldn't be treating him like this! The thought of Emily possibly being with Marlon right nowv made Patrick's blood boil with anger, wishing he could just throttle both of them.


Patrick parked the car at the entrance of Hughes Manor, where it was already pitch black inside. He thought to himself,'Are Emily and Marlon hooking up right now?' The thought made his heart ache with a mix of resentment and fury. If it weren't for the fear of making the news headlines in Pearl Peak City the next day by storming into Hughes Manor, Patrick would have lost control. He clenched his hands tightly on the steering wheel, just like he had gripped Emily's neck earlier that day.

Realizing that Emily truly didn't want to be with him,Patrick suddenly felt a bit scared. He thought to himself, 'Was Emily out of her mind? Could she really just let go? Or was she playing some twisted game, trying to make me chase her? No,
she must be in cahoots with Marlon, putting on a show to make hm jealous. That had to be it.'

He slammed his hand against the table, the sharp sound slicing through the silence. Leaning back, he felt frustration wash over him like a tidal wave, a tight knot forming in his chest that made it hard to breathe. It was suffocating. With a sense of urgency, Patrick took out his phone and repeatedly called Emily, only to hear her voicemail message.

Filled with anger and jealousy, Patrick couldn't believe that Marlon had actually taken Emily away, nor could he believe that Emily would leave him so easily. He kept dialing the phone, hoping to hear Emily's voice, even if it was just a scolding.

After a long day of work, Emily had just taken a shower and was wrapping her hair while revising the plans from the day.Every year, there was a jewelry exhibition, and this year's exhibition was held in Sunshine Bay City. Emily wanted to establish herself in the Hughes Group, so she needed impressive pieces to showcase.

She kept adjusting her thoughts, sketching all the jewelry designs that had come to mind over the years on paper. For example, the pieces she saw when she and Patrick attended auctions. However, Patrick never got her a gift on his own; He'd toss her something extra, like it was an afterthought, once Shirley had her gift.
At that time, she would imagine a scene in her mind,hoping that one day when Patrick bought these things, it wouldn't be some random gifts, but a piece of beloved jewelry given wholeheartedly.

Sitting at the table, Emily focused on drawing the designs,her eyes filled with determination. She knew that only by succeeding in her work could she truly be independent and break free from her current predicament. Thinking of Patrick's attitude towards her, she felt sad, but she told herself to be strong.

Emily also thought about Lisa, who was still bravely fighting addiction. When she was younger, she had also wanted to make a beautiful piece of jewelry for Lisa, but Lisa had been poor and busy for many years, and even ended up in a rehab center without a decent piece of jewelry. A tear glistened in Emily's eyes as she felt sorry for Lisa, hoping for her early recovery and wanting to design the most beautiful piece of jewelry for her to feel her love.

Emily also wanted to design a set of jewelry for Melissa.Despite Melissa's prestigious background, she liked quirky things and wasn't interested in traditional jewelry styles.She refused to wear the precious jewelry her grandparents gave her.

If she could design a unique piece of jewelry for Melissa,Melissa would surely be overjoyed. Just thinking about her excitement upon receiving the gift made Emily smile; Melissa
was the first friend who had given her confidence and unconditional support, so she was determined to create a unique piece of jewelry for Melissa.
###Chapter 54 You Stole My Woman!

Emily wanted to design a piece of jewelry for the baby growing inside her.something that captured all her hopes and love. She even dreamed of creating a piece that would wow everyone, ensuring her design would be remembered for generations.

She gently rubbed her belly,feeling all the love and tenderness. Her thoughts drifted back to Patrick. She picked up her constantly buzzing phone and decisively hit the power button.


She didn't owe Patrick anything and was done clinging to him. Having this baby was her final act of love for him. She might forget him, but never the love she put into it.


Emily had no idea that as she drifted off to sleep, her face was streaked with tears.


Meanwhile. Shirley rushed back to the parking lot of Twilight Enchantment Lounge, clutching her car keys, but Patrick was nowhere to be found. Her heart pounded, and a wave of unease washed over her.


She frantically pulled out her phone and kept dialing Patrick's number,only to be met with the annoying voicemail message.


Shirley felt like she was lost in the dark, desperately searching for a sliver of light. She kept dialing over and over.

With each call she made, Liu Yangyang felt her heart plunge further into despair. 'How could Patrick, who drinks so much, just drive off? When did he leave? Was it because Emily showed up? It had to be! Only Emily could make Patrick leave! Emily! Why is it always you?!
Tonight, with Patrick drunk, was supposed to be Shirley's perfect chance.She even went to Twilight Enchantment Lounge to pick him up and carry out her plan, regardless of Vincent's mockery. But now. Patrick had vanished! She had to find him, she had to make him understand her feelings.


'Emily. I won't let Patrick go to you!' Shirley thought and slammed her bag hard against a car parked by the roadside. The loud alarm from the car startled her. She glared at the vehicle in front of her, as if it were Emily.



She truly couldn't figure out when Emily was with Patrick, he only had eyes for Shirley. Now that Emily was gone. Patrick's attention was back on Emily. Was his previous kindness to Shirley just a ploy to provoke Emily?No way! After finally driving Emily out of their lives, it seemed like Patrick's heart had left with her. The thought that Patrick might actually fall in love with Emily filled Shirley with an unprecedented sense of fear and despair.


Shirley slowly put the car key back in her bag. Then her fingers dug into the bag's compartment and pulled out a small bag of pink pills. This was her trump card, her last hope in desperate times. She didn't want to use it unless she had to. She kept dialing her phone until it died, then despairingly put it back in her bag.

At Hughes Manor

"Sir, that Maybach outside has been parked there for a while. It looks like Mr. Rivera's car. Should I invite him in?" The butler, Rex Green, knocked on the study door cautiously, standing at the door and asking respectfully.Rex studied Marlon's expression, feeling somewhat perplexed. Patrick had been coming and going at The Hughes's Family since childhood,as if it
were his own. When had he ever been this awkward? Could they have fought over a woman? Rex had a pretty good understanding of them.


Hearing Rex's words,Marlon felt extremely restless. He yanked the curtains open, as if he wanted to tear apart the world outside. Sure enough, there was Patrick, leaning against his car, chain-smoking like it was going out of style.


Even Marlon,who usually had a good temper, couldn't help but curse,“Patrick, what the hell are you playing at?" He couldn't wrap his head around why Patrick was acting this way, why he treated his relationship with Emily so carelessly. To Marlon, Emily was pure and kind, someone he wanted to protect and cherish. But Patrick treated her like she was disposable.


Marlon stared blankly out the window, cursing under his breath as he took a sip of his drink. "Is Patrick realy that thick-headed? Or is he just blind? How could he be so petty! He was standing at the door, refusing to leave, clearly suspecting that Emily was following me home."


"Forget about him," Marlon said impatiently. Rex hesitated for a moment before saying. "But Mrs. Hughes saw Mr. Rivera too. She asked if you had a fight with him."


Hearing that his grandma, Hannah Hughes, was aware of the situation made Marlon even more annoyed. He thought about her health, her love and care for him. Frustrated, he dialed Patrick's number. "Why are you waiting outside? Come up."


Marlon taunting words were intended to make Patrick feel miserable.

"Is Emily there?" Patrick's low voice came through the phone,sounding like it was coming from the depths of darkness, filled with exhaustion.
Hearing Patrick's subdued tone, Marlon couldn't help but smirk. He deliberately dragged out his words. "Why did you hit her today? Now you're asking about her whereabouts? Of course she's here!" He wanted to infuriate Patrick, recalling how painful it was to see the bruises on Emily at the company. How could Patrick do that?

Unable to control his emotions any longer. Patrick stormed into courtyard.grabbed a cigarette box, and angrily threw it at Marlon, who was standing upstairs with the phone, flipping him off.

"Patrick, you really disgust me. When she was with you, you never appreciated her. Now that she's leaving, you're desperate to find her.I genuinely care for Emily, but I won't hold her back like you. At least I respect her!" Marlon looked down at Patrick.


"You talk a big game! Didn't you take her to the Hughes Group? Don't think I don't know what you're up to. Marlon, you couldn't beat me in school, and you weren't as favored by the elders. Are you trying to prove your worth by taking Emily away?" Patrick clutched his phone,refusing to go upstairs or leave. He glared at Marlon with pure contempt, feeling like Marlon wasn't even in the same league as him. Patrick thought Marlon had no right to take Emily away from him.
###Chapter 55 Elbert Was a Fool

"Patrick, you're really full of yourself, aren't you? Emily's with the Hughes Group now, not the Rivera Group. Maybe it's time you took a good look in the mirror. Or are you still blind to your own controlling ways?" Marlon shot back, not backing down an inch.


"Marlon! I don't need a lecture from you! She's my woman. Do you even care about her? Has she ever looked at you with anything but indifference?She doesn't even like you!" Patrick yelled, his voice booming through the mansion like he wanted to bring the whole place down.


Marlon's expression twisted with resentment at Patrick's taunt. He stormed downstairs.


Seeing the tension, Rex rushed over and whispered, "Mr. Marlon Hughes,Mr. Patrick, please don't argue in the garden. Mrs. Hannah Hughes just fell asleep." His voice was filled with helplessness and anxiety. He didn't know how to stop their fight, just hoping they wouldn't disturb Hannah.


Patrick had a soft spot for Hannah. Hearing Rex, he lowered his voice.walked up to Marlon, and said, "Marlon, as a friend, I'm warning you.Stay away from her. Even if she's with the Hughes Group now, don't get any ideas."


Marlon shoved Patrick's shoulder with both hands. "I don't need your advice. Just don't come to my place acting crazy. Just because my grandmother likes you doesn't mean you can act all high and mighty. And as for Emily, she makes her own choices. Stop trying to control her."Marlon had been holding back his anger all afternoon, and if it weren't for the family ties, he would've punched Patrick by now.

Patrick stumbled back a couple of steps, brushing off imaginary dust from
his chest. "Remember what you said. Don't let me find out if Emily's being mistreated by you."


Marlon's words confirmed that Emily wasn't at the Hughes Manor, which was enough for Patrick. He took a deep breath and left. It didn't matter if he didn't find her here; she'd show up at the Hughes Group eventually.Patrick believed he had all the patience in the world.

Back at the Rivera Manor

Shirley didn't go to chat with Jennifer like she usually did. The memory of Jennifer kicking her out last time was still fresh; though she was usually shameless. she couldn't just brush it off. Besides. Jennifer was too focused on Emily's child right now, and Shirley hated hearing Jennifer talking about it.

Shirley grew up in the Rivera Manor. After her dad got a brain injury saving Patrick, she felt a special bond with him, especially since Patrick always treated her with such care. It was more than just romantic feelings;it was like they were connected on a deeper level.


Jennifer and Patrick treated her like family from the start. She had the freedom to come and go as she pleased in the Rivera Manor and would even chat with Jennifer every night before bed.


All those little things used to make Shirley feel so warm and happy. But now, She felt increasingly lonely and helpless in this manor. It seemed like everyone in the manor had changed.


Feeling down. Shirley wandered over to a small wooden house behind the garden. It was a cute little place with white walls and red tiles,like something out of a storybook. Her dad, Elbert Wright, had built and painted it himself after seeing a picture book and thinking Shirley would


But Shirley couldn't stand that house. It felt so out of place behind the grand Rivera Manor, as if it mirrored her own sense of not belonging within the Rivera family, which made her feel small and insignificant. She preferred staying in the guest room at Villa No. 3 in The Rivera Manor.where she felt a bit more dignified and confident.


The Rivera family appreciated Elbert. They didn't want him and Shirley to feel like they were just charity cases. so they kept him on as a driver but didn't arrange much work for him. But to Shirley, it was humiliating. She felt like the Rivera family was just pretending to be nice, treating them like they didn't really matter. She even thought. 'If they really cared, why doesn't Patrick just marry me?' Their fake kindness made her feel disgusted.


Most of the time, the Rivera family didn't need Elbert to drive Jennifer or Patrick around. Only when they were short-handed did they ask for his help. This made Shirley feel like her dad was just a tool, used whenever convenient, which made her feel both angry and helpless.

The people in the manor were nice to Elbert and Shirley,respecting him for saving Patrick. No matter how nice everyone around her was to them,Shirley still felt uneasy. She simply hated Elbert, to the point where she didn't even want to hear his name. To her, his name was like a curse,always bringing bad luck and pain.


Thinking about all this. Shirley touched the pink pill in her bag,pushed open the door of the little house she once despised, and stepped inside.


Patrick lay on his bed after coming back, Marlon's words echoing in his mind like thorns, piercing his heart. He thought, 'Could it be true? Have I really liked Emily all these years? Are my feelings for her more than just a employer and employee?'
Patrick felt like his world was falling apart. He had always thought he could control everything, but now he realized he had lost control of Emily.He hated this feeling. and even more, he hated Emily's sudden boldness!
###Chapter 56 Pink Pills

Patrick was staring at the ceiling,feeling a mix of confusion and anger, and let out a sigh. 'Damn it! Isn't Emily usually the most obedient one? Why did she change all of a sudden?' he thought.Emily's sudden departure left Patrick feeling somewhat unsettled. He was used to being in control, and now he felt powerless.

"Did Emily change her mind?" Patrick wondered, gritting his teeth in frustration. He couldn't believe that Emily, who had always been under his control, would think of leaving him. No way! He had to keep her by his side until he decided he was done with her.


Patrick silently vowed to himself that he would make Emily come back. As long as he didn't want her to leave, she wouldn't be able to.She was the one who chased him down in the beginning,and now she's just gonna leave without a care? What role did he truly play in Emily's heart? Was he merely a sex partner, or was he regarded as a god of wealth? This contemplation filled his heart with a surge of anger. He felt betrayed and couldn't accept it.

"Shirley, can I eat these pink pills?" Elbert asked, looking at the three pink pills in Shirley's hand with childlike curiosity. He seemed to think they were candy, his face full of anticipation.


Shirley covered Elbert's hand with her own, giving him a stern look. "No. Remember what I said, you must not eat these. They are medicine that can make one's body better." She spoke to him as if he were a child, concealing her true intentions. A hint of panic flashed in her eyes.
"But I..." Elbert anxiously pointed at himself and blinked his eyes.Shirley quickly extended her hand and waved it above Elbert's head.In response, Elbert hurriedly covered his head. "Don't hit! Don't hit!Daddy won't eat! Won't eat!"


Seeing that Elbert had calmed down, Shirley finally lowered her hand.


Elbert pointed to himself anxiously, looking helpless and confused.He didn't understand why Shirley wouldn't let him take the pills. He felt his body needed improvement, too.


"Dad, you can't eat this! Because you've been doing housework for years, keeping fit! Just look at how great your body is! So you don't need to eat! Remember that? Patrick is always busy working and has no time to exercise, so I bought these pills for him to improve his health. You must not take them, or you'll get a nosebleed," Shirley explained impatiently, looking at Elbert's naive expression. She felt that the Rivera family owed them, and she wanted to change that.These pills were her chance.


Hearing Shirley's explanation, Elbert immediately covered his nose and took two steps back. "No, I don't want a nosebleed! Then why don't you give the pills to Mr. Rivera?" he asked, still confused.

Shirley lowered her eyes, thinking that if things went wrong,Elbert wouldn't be held accountable because he was a fool. But she couldn't risk being kicked out of the Rivera Manor. She knew the risks of her plan, and if discovered, she wouldn't get involved with it anyway. If they want to get rid of Elbert, then so be it. At worst,she could just feed him every day-he won't starve.
Shirley looked up and smiled at Elbert. "Because, Dad, you like Patrick the most, and Patrick likes you the most too, right? So,he wvill be glad if you give him water with the pills dissolved in it. But don't tell him about the pills; it's a surprise." Elbert nodded proudly,beaming. "Yes, I like Mr. Rivera the most, and I like Shirley too." He had a happy, contented smile.


A cold smile crept onto Shirley's lips. Ever since Elbert saved Patrick from that head injury, Patrick had been all he could think about. He didn't even consider who had caused him to get hurt in the first place. 'If it weren't for the Rivera family, how did we end up so miserable?' she thought, feeling a wave of resentment. She believed her fate shouldn't be like this; she wanted to change it and become the mistress of the Rivera family.

Thinking back to the last time Jennifer kicked her out, she felt a flush of humiliation. Despite treating Jennifer with respect and filial piety all these years, Jennifer's kindness and favoritism were all just a show!Why was Jennifer doing this? It was clearly to maintain the family's reputation to show outsiders how much they sacrificed to raise the daughter of a loyal servant. It was all a facade! Shirley felt deceived by Jennifer and no longer believed in her emotions. She only believed in herself; only she could change her fate.


Having seen through it all, Shirley no longer held any hope for Jennifer. She once thought Jennifer might suggest that Patrick marry her, but that was just wishful thinking. Shirley was resolved to get pregnant with Patrick's child! That was the fastest way to enter the Rivera family. 'This is my only way out, my only chance to change my destiny,' she thought and clutched the pill tightly in her hand,
her eyes burning with intensity.

Shirley examined the three small pills under the fluorescent light. as if she were looking at her soon-to-be-realized dream of entering the aristocratic family. She was determined to become the woman everyone envied and admired! She could even picture herself in a stunning gown, adorned with expensive jewelry, standing at the entrance of Lu Villa No. 1. she ordered all the servants to line up at her feet.


Patrick slowly woke up. the sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows. bright and warm. Suddenly, his hand twitched unnaturally. When he lifted his robe,he saw the wound was red and infected. With a furrowed brow, he picked up his phone and dialed Elbert's number. After a few rings. Elbert's hearty voice came through."Mr. Rivera, what's wrong?"


"Elbert, my wound is infected. Could you check which driver is home right now? I need to go to the hospital." Patrick asked. Elbert.hearing this, became nervous and muttered. "The driver is out taking Mrs. Rivera somewhere, and the other driver is on leave. What to do?" He was anxious, worried that Patrick's wound and afraid of his current situation wouldn't allow him to drive Patrick. The main reason was that Mrs. Rivera had prohibited him from driving for the time being.
###Chapter 57 Maple Peak Apartments

Elbert nervously said over the phone, "Mr. Rivera, I'm the only one here right now. How about I take you to the hospital?" He hung up quickly, dashed to Patrick's bedroom door, knocked, and asked. "Mr.Rivera, are you ready? Let's get to the hospital!"

Patrick replied, "Give me 10 minutes!" Elbert stood there, fidgeting and adjusting his clothes, trying to make a good impression.

In the parking lot outside Rivera Manor. Elbert was all set,waiting for Patrick. Sunlight streamed through the car window, glinting off the bottled water Elbert had prepped for Patrick. As Patrick walked down the steps, Elbert jumped out to open the car door for him.Once they were settled, Elbert eagerly handed the water to Patrick,who hesitated before taking it.


Elbert stammered, "Mr. Rivera, this spring water is for you. I went through a lot to get it!" Patrick's lips curled into a smile,remembering how Elbert had once risked his life for him. Feeling a warmth in his heart, Patrick unscrewed the cap and took a sip. He looked at Elbert, touched by his genuine kindness despite his quirks.It was very sweet.


In the rearview mirror, Elbert noticed Patrick's cheeks turning red,which freaked him out. He quickly asked, "Mr. Rivera, are you feeling okay?" Patrick, looking restless, tossed his suit jacket aside.Elbert's mind raced, not sure what was happening.


Suddenly, Elbert recalled what Shirley had said last night:"Dad,if Patrick feels unwell tomorrow, call me right away!"
With that in mind, Elbert dialed Shirley's number. "Dad, what's wrong?" she answered expectantly. Elbert, panicking, said. "Mr.Rivera seems off. What should I do? We were heading to the hospital for his infected wound, but now he seems really uncomfortable!" His voice was filled with genuine concern and fear.


Shirley replied softly, "Dad, only I can help Patrick. Bring him to Maple Peak Apartments, and don't waste any time. Don't take him to the hospital or call anyone else." Hearing this, Elbert glanced at Patrick, who was mumbling in the back seat, then turned the car around and sped towards Maple Peak Apartments.


Though puzzled. Elbert trusted Shirley. He believed she had a way to help Patrick. He floored it, praying silently for Patrick's safety.

Meanwhile,Melissa was casually brushing her teeth and walked over to Emily's house. Seeing Emily rummaging through boxes, Melissa,still yawning, asked groggily, "Why are you still home? Don't you have work today? And what are you looking for?" She yawned again,her hair a mess, eyes half-closed with laziness.


Emily, looking frantic, said, "I can't find my bracelet! The one I've always worn!" Her eyes darted around the room, hoping to spot it somewhere. That bracelet wasn't just any pieceof jewelry; it was a keepsake from her dad, filled with memories.


Melissa suggested, "Maybe it got lost in the move?" She joined Emily in the search, feeling the urgency too.


Emily's mind was in a tangle, 'How could I lose something so important? I haven't even been back to the old apartment, and the
only other place I've been is Maple Peak Apartments!' She realized she needed to check there. The property management had mentioned the place was sold, and she worried she might be too late. The idea of her dad's keepsake being treated like trash made her anxious. She clenched her hand, her brow furrowed with worry.


Checking her work list, Emily saw she only had to drop off a sample accessory at the workshop this morning. She could swing by Maple Peak Apartments first. Grabbing some milk and bread, she hugged the still-groggy Melissa and rushed out. Emily walked along.munching on her bread, her mind filled with silent prayers. She hoped for good fortune from the divine, wishing desperately not to lose it. Yet, when she finally arrived at the Green Forest Apartment.she found herself hesitating to enter. In the past, her visits had always been shrouded in secrecy, lacking any joyful memories. Still,during the days she spent waiting for Lu Wen, she had indeed felt a flicker of happiness.


Even though it had been a while since she last visited, Emily still parked in her usual spot, as if it held some kind of hope for her.Waiting for the elevator, a strange sense of anticipation grew. Would
she run into Patrick? Probably not. He always returned to Rivera Manor, no matter how late.


In the past, after their intimate moments, she had begged him to stay the night, only to face Patrick's disdain and mockery. The pain of his indifference and scorn cut deep, leaving her feeling lost and sad. A wave of sorrow washed over her as she wondered why she had fallen for someone who caused her so much pain.
Trying to shake off the memories. Emily squeezed her wrist. As the elevator arrived, she stepped in, wearing her comfy flats, and soon reached the apartment door. She wondered if Patrick had changed the fingerprint lock after she left.

Hesitating to use her fingerprint, she suddenly heard faint sounds from inside: gasps, moans, and Shirley's pleading voice.
###Chapter 58 Damage the Bond We've Buil2

Emily froze, her heart pounding like crazy. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. Her hand hovered in the air, not sure what to do next.


"Patrick, don't do this, please," Shirley pleaded, her voice cracking with sobs. Hearing it, Emily's hand trembled on the doorknob.Curiosity got the best of her, and she nearly failed to resist the urge to peek through the door. She imagined Patrick and Shirley together,but reality snapped her back. Why did she still care so much? Even if it was Patrick in there, what difference would it make? Her heart ached, and tears welled up in her eyes.


Standing there for what felt like half a century, Emily's inner conflict manifested as a doorknob she couldn't turn. She wanted to know what was happening, but was scared to face it. Tears blurred her vision, and it felt like her heart was being ripped to shreds. Memories of Patrick flooded her mind, filling her with anger.


'Patrick, you finally gave in to temptation, right?' she thought.'Shirley is still your goddess, even in bed. You can't stand to hear her scream or see her in pain, right? Every time we were together, you were rough, even when I was in tears, you wouldn't slow down.'


When Emily was exhausted and begged softly, Patrick would cruelly pinch her chin and say, "You're such a slut!" She was overwhelmed by anger and pain, feeling like she was just a toy for Patrick,someone he could use and discard. Tears streamed down her face,
her body trembling, her world was falling apart.

She pulled her hand back, leaning against the door, tears pooling at her feet. Patrick, I've loved you for ten years. Since the first time I saw you, I've loved you.' Patrick radiated brilliance, standing out as the most captivating heartthrob. After entering the workforce.he transformed into a deity of the business realm. Countless individuals aspired to be by his side. yet only Emily remained. Thus, she always believed that she held a unique place in his heart. Therefore,when she offered her first time to him, she felt like a willing sacrifice.


Emily had wasted ten years of her life on Patrick. She had given him everything, only to end up like this. Sliding down the wall, she sat on the floor, hugging her knees, crying her heart out.


Inside the apartment, in the steamy bathroom. Patrick turned the shower on full blast, trying to clear his head. In a daze, he caught sight of Emily beside him, replaying their moments together.Occasionally, he let out a groan, missing her more than he could admit. He realized that he couldn't live without her,not understanding why he felt this way, only knowing he wanted her back.


Outside the bathroom, Shirley, in a satin camisole and glamorous makeup, replayed the scene in her mind. Everything was perfect, and when Patrick came in, he kissed her, but then he pinched her chin and said, "You're not her!"


Shirley couldn't understand why Patrick treated her this way,feeling like she was better than Emily, wondering why Patrick didn't like her.
Shirley plopped down on the sofa. fuming. After Patrick's harsh words, he had shoved her out of the bedroom and opted for a cold shower instead of letting her back in. She felt humiliated, her plan crumbling before her eyes. She glared at the bedroom door, swearing to herself that she'd get Patrick no matter what.


'Why does Emily have such a hold on Patrick? I gave him my heart.and this is what I get? Emily, what makes you so special? I've known Patrick since we were kids. I'm the one he truly loves! Maybe he's just saving himself for our wedding night. It can't be that he doesn't love me!' Shirley tried to reassure herself.

Hearing the bathroom door open and the water stop. Shirley instinctively took a few steps back, a wave of panic washing over her.She had no idea how Patrick would react, afraid he might lash out at her.


Patrick emerged from the bathroom,towel-drying his hair,looking furious. He couldn't believe Shirley had tried to seduce him. Was she out of her mind? And to make matters worse, she was still ogling his abs.


Sitting on the sofa, Patrick spoke in a rare, stern tone, "Shirley Wright,do you have something to say to me?" It was the first time he had addressed her so seriously. Shirley, snapped out of her daze by his question, trembled, unsure how to respond.

After a moment, she stammered, "Patrick, your anger scared me. You've never treated me like this before. I got a call from my dad,heard you weren't feeling well, so I dropped everything and rushed over."
With a shaky voice, she tried to evoke sympathy and forgiveness from Patrick. She looked at him with hopeful eyes, praying he would believe her.


Patrick knew what had happened but didn't want to accept it. Shirley had been a part of his life since childhood, and her care for him was rooted in Elbert's lifesaving act when he was young. But human emotions were complicated, and Patrick was conflicted, unsure how to handle the situation. He knew that if he didn't address it, it would only lead to more problems. He couldn't just kick them out of the Rivera family over this.


Sitting on the sofa, Patrick furrowed his brow, tapping the armrest as he pondered a solution. He understood Shirley's feelings but didn't share them. He didn't want to hurt Elbert and Shirley, considering their past kindness.


Quickly, he typed out a message on his phone and sent it to Jennifer.Then he stood up, grabbed his clothes, and with his back to Shirley,said. "Shirley, you were wrong. I've always seen our relationship as more like family. You respected me, relied on me, and I appreciated that, treating you as my younger sister. Elbert once saved my life, so if I gave you the wrong impression over the years, I apologize. Please don't misinterpret my feelings or damage the bond we've built over the years."
###Chapter 59 Coming Back Out of Di ssatisfaction

Patrick's voice was deep and serious. He hoped Shirley would get the hint and stop acting like that. He threw on his clothes, ready to get out of this awkward situation.


After saying his piece. Patrick left without a backward glance. Although he managed to push through the medication's effects for now, he knew it would mess him up if he didn't satisfy his sexual urges soon. Patrick realized he couldn't be with any woman other than Emily.

Stepping out of the apartment, Patrick felt all kinds of conflicted. Why did he have these feelings for Emily? He felt like he couldn't be without her,but admitting it was a whole other story.


As Patrick walked away, tears streamed down Shirley's face. Her beloved Patrick had just said he saw her only as a younger sister! What about all the years she had devoted to him?


Shirley thought, 'Patrick, you just haven't figured out your true feelings yet.You don't want to hurt me because of those strong pills.' Sitting on the sofa, crying. In her heart, there was a faint thought,'Could it be that all my efforts were in vain, that Patrick had no feelings for me? No, it's absolutely impossible. It's all that wretched Emily's fault!'


Emily, unsure of how to proceed, felt like a soulless doll lost. Meanwhile, a gust of wind lifted her skirt, snapping her back to reality.Watching the kids play happily in the square, she thought life could be that simple.Looking at her slightly bulging belly, Emnily gently touched it, thinking, 'Baby, I'm so lucky to be your mom. Although your father has brought a lot of pain into my life, having you around seems to offer a little bit of
comfort.' Her eyes were full of tenderness and love; she felt like this child would give her life new hope.

Emily's gaze fell on her empty wrist, and she pictured Patrick and Shirley all over each other, making her mood turn sour. After all those years together. it felt like it meant nothing. It's almost better to have a pet,which wouldn't betray her!


With a mix of anger and unease. Emily stood up from the bench,opened her purse, took out her favorite lipstick and a small mirror, touched up her fading lipstick, smiled at the mirror, and said. "Emily, you got this. From now on, you have new strength to keep going!" Encouraging herself in the mirror, she knew she had to be strong for the baby.


With that, she headed back towards Maple Peak Apartments, thinking.'Since I'm here, I can't leave empty-handed.' That bracelet, which Patrick looked down on and mocked as outdated anad tacky, is the only keepsake Brian left her; it carried unique memories and love. Emily walked firmly towards the apartment, her only goal to find that bracelet. She thought of Brian, feeling warmth and longing. The bracelet was the bond between her and Brian.


As she entered the apartment building, Emily caught a glimpse of Shirley's stumbling figure disappearing by the fountain. She couldn't help but think,Just moments ago, those two were all over each other, so why weren't they together now? It's really puzzling, but whatever, it's not my problem.'Emily walked into the apartment, feeling a bit confused. She didn't know why Shirley left so quickly, but she didn't care. All she cared about was finding her bracelet.


Emily quickly walked to the elevator, pressed the up button, and just wanted to find the lost bracelet! In no time, she was back in front of the
apartment door. Her fingertips landed on the keypad, and it lit up."Unlocked, welcome home." A small smile flickered at the corner of Emily's mouth. She thought, 'Maybe there's still a little place for me in his heart.Emily opened the door, her heart somewhat hopeful, wondering if shestill had a place in Patrick's heart. She walked into the room. looking at everything familiar. filled with emotion.


As she pushed the door open. Emily noticed the usually spotless floor was covered with water stains. She thought. 'They really know how to have fun!Emily felt uncomfortable. remembering the sounds she heard earlier. She didn't want to dwell on it; she just wanted to find the bracelet.

Without wasting time. Emily began to search methodically. There were too many memories here. Important things from the past, she always placed them closest to where she rested. As she turned around, she came to the place where they made love the most. The bedroom, the place she least wanted to step into. Apprehensive of the disorder that could disturb her.Emily paused. Her right hand grazed her bare left wrist, now devoid of Shirley's voice in the room. Taking a deep breath, she entered. Everything remained as it was. In this room, she and Lu Wen had shared many moments.


The bedroom door was pushed open, only to find everything neatly arranged, as if nothing had happened before. Did she have auditory hallucinations earlier, or was she mentally disturbed? Emily was surprised.She didn't know why the room was so tidy. She felt like she was having hallucinations. She walked into the room, searching everywhere for the bracelet.


Opening the first drawer of the bedside table, to her surprise, her thick books lay quietly there. Emily thought she had taken everything she could with her, never thinking her beloved books were left behind. She picked
up one from the middle, flipped through a few pages gently, and the pungent ink smell made Emily want to vomit. She puat down the book in her hand, hurried to the bathroom, and vomited frantically into the toiet.Emily's body felt uncomfortable, her recent morning sickness getting worse.She looked at herself in the mirror, feeling helpless.

During this time., Emily found her morning sickness more pronounced.Looking at her thin face in the mirror, she muttered to herself. "It's a good thing I'm not at the office. otherwise. I don't know what I'd do looking like this."


In a daze, she seemed to hear the sound of the door opening. Emily's body involuntarily trembled. Who could it be? Emily felt nervous. She didn't know who had come back. She was scared it might be Patrick,but she also hoped it was him.

Emily faintly felt a gaze behind her, feeling the burning stare could ignite her. She turned around and saw Patrick. Why did Patrick come back?
###Chapter 60 What Are You Doing Here?

"Why are you here?" Patrick asked.staring at Emily, who had just shown up out of nowhere. He was surprised but secretly hoped she was there to see him.


Emily,clearly annoyed, shot back, "I came back to find something important!" Patrick's mind started racing. Was she here because she wanted him back, but couldn't sayit? He felt a surge of thrill in his heart.

He sensed that Emily still cared about him, and a faint smile crept onto his face.


Patrick loosened his suit, adjusted his tie, and leaned back on the sofa."Emily, what important thing are you looking for?" he asked,trying to sound casual.


"It's none of your business," Emily snapped, her initial emnotion quickly fading. Patrick's expression darkened. "If it's none of my business.then please leave my apartment immediately," he said, feeling a wave of anger and disappointment ather coldness.


Emily tried to walk past him but tripped over something on the floor. She almost fell, but Patrick caught her by the waist just in time, nearly falling himself. The sudden closeness made their hearts race.


Emily's cheeks turned a light shade of pink. Feeling Patrick so close brought a rush of mixed emotions. Patrick held her tightly, worried she might fall.


This morning, the skirt she randomly grabbed when leaving seemed a bit short and cinched at the waist. The thought of being held in his arms seemed somewhat tempting.
As soon as Emily thought of this, she struggled to break free. But Patrick hadn't held her like this for a long time. He felt that the fit of this body was like it was tailor-made for him. Holding her felt so soft. Seeing Emily struggling. Patrick involuntarily used more strength. For a moment.the injured area began to emit a faint pain.


Patrick gently rested his head on Emily's shoulder. He had just been irritated by Shirley and had actually left the Green Forest apartment ahead of time. However, when he reached the parking lot. the extinguished smoldering flame in his heart was rekindled by a sudden rush of desire.In that moment of rising desire, his mind was filled with thoughts of Emily.


He knew he couldn't find her. But if he went back to the Rivera manor.it would be even more impossible to sense any trace of Emily. It was better to stay at the Green Forest apartment. At least, her tears were most visible here.


Before he knew it, he was back at Maple Peak Apartments, where they had shared so many intimate moments. And finally met Emily as he wished.


Patrick looked at Emily, and desire surged in his heart. He didn't want to let her go; he felt like he couldn't live without her. His wound went from a dull ache to a numbness in his shoulder, but he didn't care; he just wanted to hug her tightly.


Seeing Emily no longer resisting, Patrick leaned in and kissed her passionately. At first. Emily resisted, but soon she was lost in the familiar sensation brought by the man she once deeply loved. Then, resentment got the best of her as she wondered, 'Why do you get to treat me like this,showing up only when you feel like it and ditching me when you're done?'
As she tried to break free, Patrick mistook her resistance for desire and
kissed her even more intensely. Holding her tightly, he led her to their familiar place of intimacy.


Emily didn't know what to do, torn between her love for Patrick and the pain he had caused her. Patrick held Emily tightly, his mind filled with thoughts of possession.


Throwwn onto the soft bed. Emily knew what was coming. Surprisingly.a flicker of anticipation sparked within her. longing for the intimacy that was uniquely theirs. But then she thought. 'Emily, are you nuts? Are you really missing this jerk? Don't let blind love mess with your head.Have you forgotten Patrick was just here with Shirley?

Just as Patrick lunged, Emily turned and dodged him.

Patrick's eyes locked onto her, his dissatisfied gaze like a predator eyeing its prey, ready to pounce.


"Why are you dodging me?" Patrick's deep voice filled the room, carrying an undeniable authority. His eyes bore into Emily,showing a mix of displeasure and confusion.


"I don't want to. Patrick." Emily lifted her head, her eyes shining with fearless determination, though inside she felt a subtle panic. She tried to sound firm to mask her unease, not wanting to show weakness in front of him.


"Do I need your permission now? Do you think you have a say in this?"Patrick said, his brows furrowing slightly, a hint of annoyance crossing his face. He was used to being in control, and Emily's rejection caught him off guard.fueling his frustration.

"Dirty." Emily lowered her head, her voice soft but firm. She couldn't meet
Patrick's eyes, feeling oppressed by his presence

"You think I'm dirty?" Patrick's anger flared at her words. Dropping to one knee, he grabbed Emily's neck, a rough gesture tinged with possessiveness. Emily had no choice but to lift her head, her face blushing.a mix of pitiful beauty and stubbornness.


"Who's really dirty? Don't you know? You've been with Marlon. You even reminded me." Patrick grabbed her shoulders, his eyes flashing with anger.He lifted her and headed straight for the bathroom. his steps urgent and forceful.


Emily clung to the door frame, writhing frantically. "Let me go. Patrick,don't go crazy." Unsure of his intentions, she was enveloped in struggle.

With his head lowered. Patrick used his head to steady Emily's wildly swaying body. "Just two days after you left me, you're already resisting my touch. How dare you say you haven't betrayed me?" Patrick's voice trembled,laced with hoarseness. And there was even a hint of grievance.But the panicked Emily didn't notice any of it.
###Chapter 61 Just Like Pandora's Box

Emily.all jittery、said, "Patrick, I really don't want to spell it out."


"Just say it." Patrick held her against the sink, his arms wrapped around her waist. His eyes were a mix of eagerness and teasing, wanting her to spill whatever was on her mind.


"I saw Shirley leaving the apartment earlier," Emily blurted out. Patrick grabbed the back of her neck, making her look at him. His eyes flashed with a complex emotion. Yet, he felt he shouldn't explain to Emily. He was torn between not wanting her to misunderstand and not wanting to appear weak. So, he stayed silent for a long time.


"So,you think something is going on between Shirley and me?" Patrick's voice was low and rough.


"What if I do?" Emily shot back, her eyes blazing with anger and jealousy.She felt that Patrick was being unfair. She'd given up so much for him,only to be treated like this.


Seeing her jealous face, Patrick felt a weird sense of satisfaction, but he didn't want to explain. His hand slid under her skirt, filled with desire and possessiveness. He couldn't bear the thought of losing her.


Suddenly. Emily remembered she was pregnant and couldn't risk it. She squirmed,pounding on his chest. "Patrick, you can't do this!" She worried about the baby.


Patrick's eyes darkened at her words. He stopped and placed his hands on her hips. "You really don't want to do this?"


Patrick's skin was burning up, hotter than usual. Emily, noticing he had
stopped. touched his neck and felt the heat. He must've been drugged!

When Patrick saw Emily stroking him, his grip weakened."Patrick, if you really need it. I'll help you." Emily bit her lip, trying to fight her feelings for him, but she couldn't stand seeing him suffer.


Patrick, no longer forcing her, lay down on the bed, his shirt half-open,waiting for her touch.


With his eyes closed, he seemed to be waiting for her reaction. Despite their many intimate moments, he still felt a thrill. Not having felt her touch in a while, he squinted at her and noticed a different look in her eyes. He felt a slight tremor in his heart when he realized that she had a pair of clear, bright eyes. They were like two crystal-clear orbs that seemed to see right through him.


Patrick felt a bittersweet mix in his heart. The sweetness was his hopes for their future,while the bitterness was the real emotions he couldn't express,leaving him often feeling lost.


Emily took a deep breath, feeling like she was gearing up for a showdown.Her fingers brushed over Patrick's open shirt, accidentally grazing his chest.She heard a faint moan and realized he was just as easily provoked.


He must have been enduring for a long time. Thinking of this, Emily couldn't help but feel a surge of joy; it seemed that he hadn't just given in to Shirley when he was unable to hold back.


Emily knew which parts of Patrick were sensitive, and just as she was preparing for the next step, his phone rang at that moment. The mood she had been stirring up instantly cooled down. She sighed and tossed the phone onto his chest.
At the same time, the ringtone pulled the dazed Patrick back to reality.He sat up quickly, saw the name on the screen, frowned, and then swiped to answer.


On the other end. Jennifer's voice came through in a rush.

"What's wrong?" Patrick asked, his voice slightly hoarse.

"Is everything okay? Are you hurt?"

"I'm fine." Patrick had no desire to discuss Shirley and just wanted to end the call with Jennifer quickly.

"Is someone with you?" Jennifer sensed that there was someone nearby.


"Shirley definitely crossed the line this time. Mom, some things can be forgiven for Elbert's sake, but not the principles."


"I understand. I called to ask if you're really angry or just temporarily upset. You know, Shirley has grown up with you. You've protected and spoiled her more than I have."


"This time, it won't happen," Patrick replied.

"Alright,since you say so, I know how to handle it. She is maturing and starting to think about marriage. She sees you as the perfect match, and because you are not related by blood, she may be entertaining certain thoughts."


Jennifer said all this because of her connection to Elbert. It would be too cruel to completely abandon them over a small mistake."And remember,don't let your wound get wet, and go to the hospital soon," Jennifer added before hanging up.
"How could the wound get infected?" Emily felt a twinge in her chest when she heard that. She turned to Patrick, realizing he was hurt. How could he be so reckless?


After hanging up. Patrick's gaze accidentaly met Emily's. and he noticed her worry. He casually said. "I'm fine, don't overthink it."


Emily turned her gaze away, unwilling to admit her concern. Patrick lay back down, but Emily's heart had already lost its romantic feeling.Moreover. Patrick had clearly become much more alert after her help; he just needed to take some medicine and soak in warm water.

"Are we continuing?" Patrick asked when he saw Emily standing still.

"Patrick, if you're fine, I'll leave first. I have things to do." Emily said softly.Without waiting for his reply, she stood up and turned to go to the bedroom to wash her hands.


Patrick got up, put on his clothes, and blocked the door. "Tell me, Emily.what conditions would you need to come back?"


Emily looked deeply at Patrick while drying her hands and shook her head. She pushed his hand, which was propping up the door, aside.


"Patrick, you've helped me. I've helped you, too. There's no need for us to stay in contact. Let's just let it go; you never liked me anyway. Stop bothering me." Emily knew that once she touched on Patrick's pride, he would blow up for sure. And just like that, he stepped back a couple of paces.


"Do you think I would bother you? Who do you think you are? Emily,you really overestimate yourself!" He then grabbed his coat and slammed the door as he left.
Emily hurriedly left the apartment as well. She realized she had no willpower at all. Just seeing Patrick, especially when he was hurt or pleading, made her heart crumble instantly.

In a state of emotional turmoil, she seemed to have forgotten the purpose of returning to the Green Forest apartment. Distracted, she was drawn to a vendor selling colorful balloons nearby, surrounded by children clamoring for their favorite cartoon balloons.


Seeing this scene finally helped to calm her troubled heart. Forget about Patrick. It was better to think about the baby in her belly. Emily unconsciously reached out to touch her slightly bulging belly, a motherly smile spreading across her face.


Angry, Patrick hadn't walked far, but he regrettably missed witnessing this moment.
###Chapter 62 The Bracelet Forgotten Again

As the phone buzzed. Emily snapped back to reality. She glanced at the screen and saw Marlon's name. Quickly, she picked up.


"Emily, where are you? Did you deliver today's documents?" Marlon's voice came through.


"Mr. Hughes, I'm on my way, but I got stuck in traffic this morning."Emily replied.


Emily quickly hung up the phone and rushed backto the office to handle her work. It had been a terrible day. She felt a bit downhearted. Her response to Marlon the phone was clearly off. Marlon, being sensitive,noticed it.


"If you're not feeling well, you can rest at home and come back to work later. There's no rush!" Marlon comforted her gently.


“It's nothing, sorry, Mr. Hughes. I got delayed by some matters today,"Emily replied, feeling a bit embarrassed. She had just started working and had already slacked off, getting caught by Marlon. It was really too much.


“It's fine, just handle your things. If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask. Emily, don't forget, besides being your boss, I'm also your friend.”Marlon emphasized the word "friend."


“Okay. I understand." After quickly finishing her tasks, Emily remembered that she had an appointment for a prenatal check-up at four in the afternoon. She hurriedly sent messages to Marlon and Melissa, then rushed to the hospital.


Melissa stood at the Maternal and Child Health Hospital, anxiously holding
various reports and past medical records. "Hurry up! If you don't come soon, I might just have to go in for the check-up myself!" Melissa exclaimed. urging Emily to hurry, but she was careful not to push too hard since pregnant women shouldn't rush.


"Did you get the bracelet?" Melissa asked curiously when she noticed Emily's strange expression.

"No.” Emily didn't know how to explain and just gave a perfunctory reply.


"What do you mean 'no'? Did you not find it? Or were you unable to get into the house?" Melissa asked as they walked. She knew that bracelet was the only thing Brian had left her. and she treasured it deeply. Back in college, she had even suggested trading her own jade bracelet for it, but Emily had refused. It had to be said that Brian was quite skilled; his craftsmanship was very fine and had an antique charm that Melissa loved.So, not being able to find that bracelet would definitely leave Melissa feeling regretful.


Seeing that Emily was silent, Melissa asked repeatedly, “Emily, what's wrong? Didn't you hear me?”


"It didn't go very smoothly." Emily finally spoke softly, explaining the situation.


"No way! Was it that intense? Didn't he always say that Shirley was like a friend to him?” Melissa asked eagerly. "Did you hear them doing anything in there?”


Emily shook her head. "They didn't have much time inside, so they probably couldn't get everything done. Just based on Patrick's condition..."

As soon as she said this, Emily's face turned as pink as a peach.She
suddenly realized that Melissa seemed to have never been in a relationship.What she was saying sounded quite risqué. She immediately fell silent.


"What? Based on what? What about Patrick's condition?" Melissa asked curiously, like a little child. Emily hurriedly covered Melissa's mouth with one hand and dragged her into the hospital.

"The baby is healthy. but you need to pay attention. You're both going to be mothers now, so don't perm your hair. try not to wear makeup. and avoid high heels. Also, stay away from crowded places and places with water. Oh. and don't live in newly renovated houses. got it?" The doctor treating Emily was an older gentleman.


Wearing reading glasses, he wrote notes on the medical records while giving instructions. Emily nodded at everything he said.“Hey,young lady,I've seen you many times. Why hasn't your husband come even once?"The doctor asked. and Emily felt a bit embarrassed.


"That's not good. Children need their fathers around. You know,the sound waves from the baby's father are extremely beneficial for the brain development of the unborn child, helping with their future abilities in shape recognition and logical processing." The old doctor adjusted his glasses and continued.


"No matter how busy work gets, you have to take care of both sides.Women shouldn't be too understanding; otherwise, men will easily take you for granted." The old doctor noticed that Emily bit her lip as she listened and shook his head slightly, sighing. It seemed he understood a lot in that moment.


Melissa looked between the doctor and Emily, unsure of what to say.Every word the doctor said was correct. Emily's grievances weren't caused by the doctor.
But she was still very angry. It was all Patrick's fault. All this embarrassment was caused by him. In Melissa's mind, if Patrick were a punching bag, he'd be getting a serious beating right now.
###Chapter 63 Jennifer

In the fragrant garden. Jennifer paced back and forth, trying to figure out how to handle the whole mess with Shirley drugging Patrick. It was a real headache.


Suddenly, an idea hit her. 'To know the whole story, it's better to just ask Elbert; he won't lie.' She quickly had Kathy call Elbert over. Elbert walked while nodding awkwardly, as if unable to control his movements. Jennifer waited until he finished the tea on the table before speaking up. "Where did you take Patrick today?"


Elbert, who had been the Rivera family's driver for twenty years. always told the truth to Jennifer and Patrick, no matter what. Even when Shirley told him to keep quiet, he never hid anything.


"Madam, Mr. Rivera wasn't feeling well today. He asked me to take him to the hospital," Elbert explained, trying his best to lay it a1l out. But Jennifer still couldn't quite piece it together. She knew Elbert well enough to trust that he would never harm Patrick, even if it cost him his own life.


"And then?" she pressed.


"Shirley showed up, Mr. Rivera got better, but then he got mad and told me to come back," Elbert answered honestly.


Jennifer was still puzzled. She motioned for Rex to pour another cup of red tea for him. "Take your time, Elbert," she said with a smile.


Elbert took a sip and continued, "I was waiting in the car for Mr. Rivera,and I even brought the bottled water I specially prepared for him."

Jennifer's heart skipped a beat. How did Elbert find the time to prepare
bottled water? Something seemed off.

Noticing Jennifer was silent, Elbert continued. "After Mr. Rivera got in the car.I handed him the bottled water, just like Shirley told me to. I even emphasized that it was good for his health. At first, he didn't want to drink it. but he eventually took a few sips. So I'm very happy."

Jennifer's face darkened. "Go on. Elbert."


"After he drank the water. I saw in the rearview mirror that his cheeks turned red, he got a bit dizzy, and he started unbuttoning his collar."Elbert said. trying not to laugh.


Jennifer was starting to get the picture. She asked Elbert to continue."Seeing Mr. Rivera like that. I was worried but didn't want to bother you.So I called Shirley and told her what was happening. She told me to take him to Maple Peak Apartments and not to tell anyone, saying only she could help him."


Jennifer's mind raced. 'Shirley's trying to trap Patrick into mnarrying her!'she thought angrily.


She clenched the hem of her clothes, her anger clear. Shirley had gone too far this time, and Jennifer was ready to deal with her.


Jennifer took Elbert's phone and sent a message to Shirley.

Elbert: [Shirley, come back to the Rivera Manor quickly. I need you!]


Then she asked Elbert, "Do you still remember that old house of the Rivera family? The courtyard you used to love, where all the flowers were planted by you?"

Hearing the old house, Elbert's eyes immediately lit up. "Yes, Madam."
Jennifer continued. "Do you want to go back there? In this big Rivera Manor. do you feel like you and your daughter belong here?"


Jennifer was trying to use Elbert to get Shirley to back off and send her parents away to deal with the drugging incident.

But Jennifer underestimated Shirley. She wasn't just some ordinary girl.She had big ambitions. not just for Patrick but for everything the Rivera family had, including their wealth.


When they were kids. Shirley was several years younger than Patrick.Patrick was very busy with his studies and had no friends, except for Shirley, who would stick to him like a little tail. Patrick had a low tolerance for nonsense. so he hadn't made many friends growing up.


Although Jennifer thought Shirley wasn't particularly smart, there was something magical about her. Patrick didn't exclude Shirley from his life.Today's incident. which could really give Patrick a headache, was the first of its kind.


Jennifer's fingers gently tapped on the marble tea table. her well-manicured nails producing a crisp sound.


Shirley was restless in the room. When she saw a message from Elbert, she was startled. Elbert was like a ticking time bomb! If he let anything slip,both of them would surely be kcicked out!

Shirley immediately called Elbert back.

Jennifer answered the call and said, "Shirley, Elbert is insisting on going back to the old house. Come back quickly." Then she hung up. Shirley was puzzled, thinking, 'Why did Jennifer answer the call?' To figure out what was going on, she quickly drove back to the Rivera Manor.
After parking, Shirley hurried towards the manor and saw Jennifer and Elbert in the garden. She ran over and nodded respectfully to Jennifer.Jennifer waved her hand and said, "Shirley. Elbert just told me he urgently wants to go back to the old house. Do you know about this?"


Shirley almost stumbled. Although Elbert had mentioned this before, she had always managed to brush it off. She thought. 'Why is this coming up again?


Shirley replied, "Mrs. Hughes, my father might not be feeling well lately.You probably understand his condition better than I do. Please don't take it seriously."


Jennifer gently smiled. Shirley wasn't the naive girl she used to be, and there was no need to go easy on her anymore.


Jennifer coughed deliberately and continued, "Since Elbert wants to go back to his hometown, you should respect his wishes. Although we regret what happened in the past, as the head of the Rivera family, I still hope for the happiness and health of your family in the future. What do you think,Shirley?"


Feeling a bit cornered. Shirley agreed and said, "Ma'am, you're right. I'll discuss it with my father and make a decision."


Jennifer saw that the situation was under control and agreed. Shirley took Elbert back to the room, looking impatient. She asked, "Dad, what did you and Jennifer talk about? Why did she suddenly mention going back to the hometown?" Elbert stammered, "I just want to go back. Jennifer asked about Patrick's wound infection, and I told her the truth.".


Hearing this, Shirley felt a wave of anxiety. Had the truth come out? She glared at Elbert and thought, 'Their dad is loaded, while my dad is just a
total mess! Since Jennifer hadn't explicitly mentioned the drugging incident.
I'd play along and take Dad back to our hometown to cool things down and distance myself from the situation. Otherwise. I might lose everything.'


Later. Shirley returned to the estate and saw Jennifer having coffee.She approached Jennifer and said softly. "Mrs. Rivera. you're right. I've talked to my father, and we'll take him back to his hometown as soon as possible.After living together for so long, there are still many attachments."


Jennifer felt a warmth in her heart hearing this. Suddenly.Shirley stepped forward. hugged Jennifer, and said. "Thank you. Madam. After my father fell ill, my mother left without a word. If it weren't for you keeping me by your side all these years. I wouldn't have received such good care."
###Chapter 64 Pregnancy Check-Up
Controver sy

Pregnant women often feel like their lives aren't their own, especially in the early stages of pregnancy.


The afternoon was crazy clear, and Emily and Melissa were cruising to the prenatal hospital, chatting the whole way. They got there pretty quickly.just in time for the appointment.


The obstetrics department was on the second floor. There were just too many people! Crowded everywhere, half were pregnant women and half were their family members.


Emily hadn't eaten anything because she needed to fast for the examination. Melissa took the examination slip from Emily's hand and began to queue up obediently. “Emily, you just sit here and wait for me.I'Il stand in line first. and when it's your turn, I'll call you. That way, you won't have to stand for too long. I'm really afraid you'll faint."


Melissa felt a bit sorry for Emily. All the other pregnant women were plump,but why did it seem like Emily had lost some weight since getting pregnant? Aside from her slightly larger belly, her arms and legs were still thin and felt quite bony to the touch.

"Okay. I'll just sit here." Emily replied like an obedient quail.


Emily had woken up too early that morning, so she was feeling quite sleepy. In the waiting area, she leaned back in her chair and started to doze off.


Suddenly.her phone rang, jolting her awake. It was Marlon calling,which surprised her because she thought it might be Patrick.
When she answered. Marlon heard the background noise and guessed she was at the hospital. He got all worried and asked. "Emily. what's going on?Are you okay?"


Emily instinctively covered the receiver for a moment, then felt as if he were guilty of a crime, so he could only close his eyes and lie, "Mr. Hughes.
I'm fine. Just here for a check-up because of a stomach issue. Is there something going on?"


Marlon relaxed a bit but still asked, "Which hospital are you at? I'll come get you later."


Emily replied, "No need, Mr. Hughes. I'm with a friend. But thanks for the offer."


Soon, Melissa's call came in. Emily hurriedly said. "I'll call you back later,"and quickly hung up the phone.

Seeing the dark screen, Marlon wasn't sure if he had just heard “Obstetrics Clinic 2" or "Gynecology Clinic 2." In any case, he was quite certain that the mechanical voice hadn't mentioned “Gastroenterology.”


Entering the consultation room, Emily began to undress as usual. The doctor glanced up at her. "It's you again, young lady? Did you come alone today?”


"No. I'm with my friend." Emily lay back nervously.


The doctor gently touched her belly. "The baby is developing well, but it seems your nutrition might be a bit lacking. You need to eat more meat and high-protein foods. Also, you're toothin; you should eat more foods rich in hormones. Absolutely don't try to lose weight, okay?”

Emily quickly nodded.
"It's best if you bring your husband next time. Around four months, the baby will start to interact with the parents. At that time, the hospital will have free prenatal education courses and such; you can bring your husband along."


Emily responded vaguely, just wanting to leave quickly. As long as the baby was fine, she didn't want to discuss anything about Patrick with anyone.

At that moment, her phone rang again.


"Hello? Emily? Are you sure you don't want me to come keep you company?" Marlon said.clearly worried.


"No need, Mr.Hughes. Sorry, they called my number, I have to hang up now.”Emily hung up the phone and sighed. 'Marlon's enthusiasm sometimes really overwhelmed me.'


"Emily, please enter the first consultation room for examination," the nurse called out. Emily got up and told Melissa, "Wait here for me. There are a lot of procedures. and I don't want you to get too tired." She walked into the consultation room, noticing how exhausted the doctors looked from seeing so many patients.


As she sat down, the older female doctor asked, "What brings you in today?"


Emily replied, "Prenatal check-up. It's my first time here. I came for a check-up last time, and the doctor suggested I come back to set up a medical record."


The doctor then asked, "How old are you? When was your last menstrual period? Do you have any family history/of illnesses or any other medical
conditions?"

Emily answered. "I'm 24. I can't remember my last period. No family history or other illnesses."


The doctor nodded and signaled the assistant to enter the info into the system.


The assistant typed away, entering all the details. When it came to the emergency contact info, the doctor's gaze fell on Emily, who remained motionless. Feeling a bit awkward, she nervously tapped her fingers together, wondering to herself. 'Should I put down Patrick's number?' She asked the doctor softly, "Can I leave a friend's number?"


The older doctor looked at her and said, "Sure, as long as someone can be reached in an emergency. You can leave two numbers if you want." They were used to seeing young women in all sorts of situations, so they didn't judge.


They heard the printer whirring and saw a stack of papers coming out.The doctor's assistant quickly marked them up and handed them to Emily.Each test, the floor, and the time were cleary noted. Emily felt a warm,fuzzy feeling from this thoughtful gesture. The vibe was way better now compared to the tired scene when she first walked in.


With a thick stack of forms in hand, she left the room and saw Melissa almost dozing off. She hurried over, got Melissa, paid the fees, and started on the tests. There were quite a few to get through today. Emily flipped through the forms and saw the one she dreaded most - the blood draw.


Blood draws were pretty standard, but they freaked Emily out. She clung to Melissa's arm, and it was obvious how scared she was. Even Melissa felt bad for her and held her hand tighter.
First up was the blood test. Knowing the wait for results would be long and that Emily was scared of blood. Melissa tried to pep her up. "If you want this baby, you gotta face these challenges. You never know what else is coming. Be ready, cause pain is part of the deal."


Trying to be brave. Emily joked. "Melissa. I can do it; you need to believe in me."


Melissa took Emily to the blood draw window and had her sit down.Then she leaned over to the nurse and whispered. "Could you be gentle?My friend faints at the sight of blood. Thanks!"


"Raise your right hand. place it here, and give me the form," the nurse instructed. Emily slowly raised her hand, trembling, placed it where the nurse indicated. and then shut her eyes tight. burying her head in Melissa's arms.


Having someone there made the fear fade. Emily, who was terrified of blood, felt less scared with Melissa by her side. Then she heard Melissa's encouraging voice, "You're actually braver than I thought. I remember back in college, every time you had to get blood drawn, you would spend a long time mentally preparing yourself."

After conquering the first big hurdle, everything else was a breeze for Emily. They navigated through the crowd, hit up the exam rooms,and knocked out almost everything in no time. The highlight for Emily was the final ultrasound, the moment she'd see her baby for the first time!Emily felt a sense of anticipation to meet her child sooner.
###Chapter 65 Prenatal Checkup Controversy

As Emily walked to the payment counter with the receipt in hand, her eyes caught a familiar figure in the crowd. Patrick's tall frame stood out.oozing elegance and charisma, drawing everyone's atention.


'Patrick! What's he doing at the hospital?' Emily wondered. After storming out of Maple Peak Apartments. he hadn't even sent a message. It probably seemed to Patrick that Emily's emotions were fleeting. coming and going in an instant. never really weighing on him. He certainly wasn't here for himself,was he?


When Patrick turned around. Emily got a clear look at his face. confirming it was him.


"What are you staring at. Emily?" Melissa asked, noticing Emily had stopped walking. She followed Emily's gaze and saw Patrick. "Is that Patrick? Is he here for you?"


Even with the crowd between them,Patrick somehow noticed Emily standing there, their eyes locking with an intense heat.


Emily guessed Patrick was at the hospital because his injuries hadn't healed yet. "People who are despicable must have their reasons,"She muttered under her breath. As she spoke, a hint of worry crept into her words.


Patrick hesitated, the awkwardness from their last encounter still fresh. But he found it odd that Emily was at the hospital, holding a stack of checklists. The girl with her seemed to be a junior from,school, the one who was often absent due to illness.


"Emily. he's coming over! What do we do?" Melissa stepped forward,half
shielding Emily.

But Emily looked away from Patrick. grabbed Melissa's arm. and disappeared into the crowd.


Feeling a sudden pain in her stomach. Emily asked Melissa to fetch some medicine while she went to the restroom. They agreed to meet at the entrance later.


Seeing Melissa walk away, Patrick discreetly followed Emily to the restroom. He leaned against the corridor wall,waiting.


A few minutes later. Emily emerged. looking for Melissa.Suddenly.a substantial hand grabboed her. It was Patrick! The mix of perfume and disinfectant filled the air. The hand she held felt like a tether she wanted to break free from. Yet. Emily didn't muster all her strength to do so.She both yearned for freedom and feared it. Because the Patrick who resided in her heart had never truly left.


Patrick urgently led Emily towards the emergency exit. Panic set in as Emily realized what was about to happen. At the emergency exit, Patrick pushed the door open and pulled Emily inside, kissing her passionately.Despite her resistance, Patrick's excitement grew.


Patrick's hands roamed over Emily's body, igniting a response from her.Her initial resistance faded, and she succumbed to his kisses, even letting out a familiar moan. The anger from their earlier argument was replaced by mutual longing.


As Patrick's hand moved downwards, Emily gently stopped him.whispering,"Can we go to bed?" Patrick was taken aback. Did Emily seem to understand him a bit better? Or was it that she was in a good mood today? She had taken the initiative to express such a need,and there was
no reason for him to refuse.

"Emily, please come to the information desk in the lobby on the first floor.Your friend is waiting there," the sudden announcement startled Patrick.causing him to release Emily. She quickly straightened her clothes and hair.then disappeared into the crowd. Emily had never felt so relieved in the hospital's crowded environment; Patrick wouldn't easily catch up to her.


Watching Emily slip away, leaving behind the scent of her lavender shampoo. Patrick wondered when she had become so eager to leave him.

Patrick still saw Emily as the girl who used to beg him to stay the night.

Emily left hand in hand wvith Melissa. The distress call was actually made by Melissa at Emily's request while Emily was in the bathroom.


Emily knew Patrick's scent so well that she could identify him even through a wall and a corridor. Over their ten years together,she had bought every bottle of cologne and shampoo for him. How well she must know Patrick.
###Chapter 66 New Expectations

After busting out of the hospital. Emily floored it all the way home.feeling on top of the world now that she was free from anyone's grip. She could finally be herself. something she'd always dreamed of. Slowly, it hit her that she didn't need to obsess over Patrick anymore.


The cozy moments behind the safety door brought back a flood of memories for Emily. Those raindrop-like kisses felt a bit different this time.She could taste a hint of love in them. Thinking about it, she pinched her thigh hard.trying to push thoughts of Patrick away. She thought. Emily.can you really forget about Patrick?


As the twilight faded. Emily and Melissa sped home, looking worn out.

Back home. Melissa and Emily couldn't wait to drop everything and flop onto the couch. not moving an inch. After spending half the day at the hospital, they were wiped out. Melissa suggested. "How about we go out and celebrate? It's rare for you to have a day off. What do you think.Emily?" But when she turned to Emily, she saw she had already dozed off.


Melissa grabbed a blanket from the bedroom and gently covered Emily.Then she headed to the fridge. looking around. There wasn't much left. so a biggrocery run was in order soon. Melissa wrote down a list. Although it was her first time taking care of a pregnant woman, weren't all parents once inexperienced before they became skilled? She thought to herself. 'Let's raise a healthy, chubby girl.'


Thinking about this made Melissa smile. Her plan was filled with thoughts of Emily and the baby. She felt a strange sense of accomplishment. as if she would be the one to manage her future goddaughter's upbringing.Then. she took out all the ingredients, planning to prepare a lavish dinner
to treat Emily.

Melissa quickly cracked the eggs into a bowl, whisked them, cleaned the shrimp. and prepped the ingredients. Now. she just had to wait for Emily to wake up so they could enjoy a simple, cozy dinner together.


Emily was jolted awake by the phone ringing. Ironically,the more tired she was, the faster she fell asleep and the deeper she slept. without even dreaming. Even though she'd only napped for half an hour, Emily's fatigue and panic vanished in an instant. The phone on the bedside kept flashing. It was a call from Patrick's new secretary. Emily hesitated for three seconds but ultimately didn't answer.

Melissa poked her head out and said, "Awake? Come eat! I made it!"

When Emily walked out and looked closely, she saw the table was already filled to the brim with the dishes that Melissa had prepared. Melissa had meticulously selected each piece of kitchenware, enhancing the meal's visual appeal and making it even more appetizing. Emily started to realize that maybe the world didn't need so much romantic love. Having a good friend was enough. Watching Emily dig into the pie, Melissa felt she could finally relax a bit, knowing how much Emily loved Patrick.

It was already hard enough to finish the noodles that Melissa kept piling on her plate, and now she was handed a big bowl of fruit. Emily's face scrunched up in protest.

"Melissa.I really can't eat anymore. Babies don't grow up in a day,and pregnant women can't give birth in a day either. No matter how anxious you are. can you please consider the well-being of the mother?"


"Don't say such inauspicious things! If you can't eat, just set it aside. You can eat it later when you're hungry." Melissa cleaned up the kitchen and
then sat cross-legged beside Emily, leaning her head on her shoulder.

"Tired?" Emily patted Melissa's hand.


"Im not as capable as you. I really can't imagine how you've managed to deal with Patrick for so many years, handling his work and taking care of his life. How have you endured it all?"


"Could it be that love really makes a person stronger?" Melissa said.hugging Emily's arm.


"Alright, who's the pregnant one here. you or me? Why are you suddenly getting all emotional? That's not okay."

"Come on, let's go out for a walk to digest. Didn't you say you wanted to buy a lot of things?"


Emily didn't want to discuss the past. She had finally managed to forget that man for four hours. She wished for just a little more tíme, until the memories faded enough that they wouldn't stir any feelings in her heart.That would be true forgetting.


The night breeze was getting a bit chilly, but Emily loved it. She finally had a place of her own. After working so hard for so long, having this moment feIt totally worth it. Melissa held Emily's hand as they strolled through the park. watching night joggers and cyclists. Even at night,this city was buzzing with life.


As they walked. Melissa said. "Hey, there's a big shopping mall up ahead.Since we're here, why not check it out?" Emily had been in Pearl Peak City for years, but it seemed like she never really lived for herself. Every day was about Patrick, his office, and his bed. It was crazy. Emily responded,"Sure,Melissa!"
Pointing to the bright moon. Emily said. "Melissa, look. is it a supermoon this year?" She pulled out her phone and snapped a picture.

The newly opened supermarket was indeed impressive, grand and luxurious. The two of them wandered a bit before diving straight into the bookstore.


Melissa stood stubbornly in the corner of the cooking guide section.unwilling to budge. Meanwhile. Emily transformed into a novice mother.browsing through various parenting guides. Before they knew it, both of them were feeling sore and achy from standing.


"No, no! I'll just buy these books online and have them delivered to my home later. I don't have the energy to carry them back today. Come on,beautiful pregnant lady. I'll accompany you to the restroom." Melissa shook her head at Emily, who was ready to pay for the books. She was worn out.
###Chapter 67 An Unexpected Fall

Emily stepped out of the restroom and caught a glimpse of a familiar figure. 'Shirley? Is this some lingering grudge? How do I manage to bump into her everywhere?' She thought.


She lowered her head slightly, not wanting to make eye contact. Shirley was like a bad penny - she just keeps turning up. Just as she turned to leave. Shirley spotted her.


Emily had no choice but to pretend she hadn't seen her and attempted to walk past.

"Emily?!" Shirley crossed her arms, eyeing Emily's completely different style of dress with a frown. "Looks like you have reverted to your original self after leaving the Rivera Corporation? Not even wearing high heels anymore? What,can't afford them now?"


Shirley's taunts couldn't hurt Emily. Even without high heels, she held her head high, casting a condescending glance at Shirley. Then she rolled her eyes and turned to leave.


Used to being domineering, Shirley couldn't stand being disrespected by a jobless young woman. She grabbed Emily's arm, nearly pushing her over.


"You shameless woman! If it weren't for you, I would have married Mr.Rivera by now!" Shirley whispered, unable to hold back her true feelings.


Emily sidestepped and shot her a glance. "Shirley, what do you want? Don't you know there are surveillance cameras all over this mall? You need to take responsibility for your actions. I heard you made a mistake and got kicked out of the Rivera family. What difference is there between you and me now? Do you still think you're superior?"
Fueled by resentment. Shirley didn't care about the consequences.She lunged forward, grabbing Emily's hair and angrily exclaimed. "It's all your fault that I had to leave the old house! I can't believe how disrespectful you are being, you shameless harlot!"


But before she could secure her grip. Emily and Melissa seized her.Although Melissa was often unwell, Shirley was no powerhouse either.Two against one, it was hard not to win.


Shirley, flustered, glanced at her dress as the strap slipped down.Covering her chest, she glared at Melissa and Emily. "Such dirty tactics! Resorting to violence when you can't win, huh?"


Melissa disdainfully pulled out a pack of wet wipes, wiping her hands while sizing Shirley up. "What a foul smell! What's wrong with this mall?Why are they letting just anyone in?"


"How dare you insult me?!" Shirley pointed angrily at Melissa.

Melissa stepped forward, causing Shirley to retract her finger in an instant.


"Emily, I'm not here to fight with you. I have something to discuss. This city isn't too big or too small, but it's still easy to run into each other."

"There are some issues I want to discuss face-to-face. No fighting!"


Shirley felt that the spot where Melissa had grabbed her hair was likely going bald. Now, she felt a draft on her head.


Emily shot her an annoyed glance. "We have nothing to discuss. There's no need to waste time between us. If you have something to say, go talk to Mr. Rivera!"


Seeing Emily about to walk away, Shirley noticed a cleaning bucket by the
restroom door,half-filled with water.

In a few quick steps, she moved past Emily,positioning herself in the corridor. Then, while kicking over the bucket, she held onto Emily's arm tightly. Melissa rushed over, trying to separate them, but the two of them were too strong. The water was slippery, likely due to the floor cleaner added by the janitor.


Emily suddenly felt her footing slip. Instinctively, she reached for anything nearby to grab onto, managing to avoid falling hard onto the floor.


Emily's sudden stumble startled Melissa, who quickly pushed Shirley away and hurriedly checked on Emily. Seeing herface turn pale and cold sweat beads at her temples, Melissa panicked.


She quickly took out her phone to call for an ambulance. Noticing Shirley trying to leave as if nothing had happened. Melissa shouted, "Shirley! Are you just going to walk away after injuring someone? There are witnesses all around! And surveillance! I'm going to record this right now! Anyone who dares delete the footage is guilty of harboring a criminal!"


Melissa's voice was loud, attracting the attention of many people passing by the restroom. Some even took out their phones to record the scuffle.


Seeing Emily sitting on the ground without getting up, and noticing her loose-fitting clothes, onlookers began to whisper.

"Isn't this the original wife fighting the mistress?"

"I don't think so; the girl on the ground looks more like the original wife."

"The one sitting down looks pregnant, doesn't she?"

"Seems like women fight over men. Both of them are so beautiful; too bad
I don't have that kind of luck."

"If I had such beautiful women fighting over me. I'd wake up laughing in my sleep."


Melissa couldn't care less about what the onlookers were saying. She was too afraid to move Emily, just hoping the paramedics would arrive soon.


Emily was also afraid to move. Leaning against Melissa, she silently prayed for the baby in her belly.


Before long, her phone vibrated again. By this time, Emily was drenched in cold sweat and had no energy to answer.

After hanging up twice, Melissa finally managed to connect. "Emily, are you home? Don't misunderstand. I called because you went to the hospital today. All employees of Hughes Corporation can use medical insurance,so if you organize your medical bills, you can get reimbursed by the finance department."


"Hello? Emily? Can you hear me?" Not receiving a response from the other end. Marlon grew anxious and asked again.


"Hello, I'm Melissa, Emily's best friend. Emily had a little accident,and the paramedics should arrive in about five minutes. Don't worry. I'll help her take a leave of absence. She'll likely call you tomorrow when she wakes up to explain the situation herself."

"What? What happened to Emily?" Marlon was taken aback.

He wanted to ask more, but Melissa hung up the phone.

When Marlon rushed to the emergency center, he saw a girl quietly wiping her tears outside the rescue room.
"I'm Melissa, her friend," she said, a bit embarrassed. "I've hated hospitals since I was a kid. They scare me. And thinking of Emily in there alone makes it worse."


Marlon watched her,feeling a strange sense of familiarity.

His phone rang. and he answered, "How's the investigation? We need more surveillance footage. Make sure no one messes with it. Tell the mall if they delete anything, they'll have the Hughes Group to deal with."


The clock ticked away, the operating room light stayed on, the sky outside darkened, and the smell of disinfectant filled the air. Melissa paced the corridor,anxiety written all over her face.


Marlon sat on a bench, trying to appear calm, but he kept checking his watch.


He wanted to protect Emily, but the right moment hadn't come yet.

In the corridor, Melissa and Marlon waited anxiously. Inside, the lead doctor worked methodically. Finally, the surgery was over, and the light in the operating room dimmed.


Marlon jumped up as the door opened. He grabbed the doctor's hand,"Was the surgery successful? How is she?"


The doctor nodded, "The surgery went smoothly. She's out of danger."Marlon sighed in relief. Melissa looked at his anxious expression and thought to herself. 'Why is Marlon more worried about Emily than I am? I've never heard Emily mention him. When she wakes up, I need to ask her about him.


Seeing Emily being wheeled out of the operating room with a pale face made Melissa's heart leap into her throat.
Emily was moved to a private room, thanks to Marlon. Melissa sat beside her,listening to the dripping sound of the heart monitor. She couldn't shake the feeling that she hadn't performed well in the mall today.


Marlon leaned against the wall,saring at the ceiling, hands in his pockets,waiting for updates from his team. Not long after, he received feedback from the mall. Unfortunately, the surveillance cameras in the mall malfunctioned.
###Chapter 68 Run for It

After Shirley bailed from the mall, she knew she'd messed up big time.She floored it back to Rivera Manor, catching Elbert totally off guard. She yanked him ouit, and they bolted to their hometown without even saying bye to Jennifer.


Elbert suddenly yelled. "Shirley, this isn't the right way! We're going the wrong way!" That was when Shirley realized she'd taken the wrong road.She thought, 'If it wasn't for Emily, I wouldn't be in this mess!'


The road back was rough, and with every twist and turn on the mountain road, Shirley's grip on the steering wheel tightened. The mountains seemed to be closing in on her. like Emily was right there. screaming,"Shirley. I'm coming for you!"


Shirley shivered as she looked out the window, thinking, 'Is it wrong to chase my own happiness?' She was overwhelmed by love, felt a bit of fear at this moment. Intentionally harming someone will land you in jail. She usually flaunted her power, all because of the Rivera family's reputation,but recently, Mrs. Rivera was tired of her, including the incident of seducing Patrick not too long ago.


Shirley figured, if she were to go to Patrick for help during this time, it probably wouldn't be very effective. So, she had to run.


With a loud crash, Kathy rushed over. "Madam, are you okay?"She saw food scattered everywhere and asked, worried. Jennifer was startled,trying to figure out what was happening. Lon Ramos looked tense, sweat dripping down his forehead.


"Madam, something's wrong. Elbert's missing," Lon said. panicked.Jennifer quickly asked, "How could he be missing? Why are you so worked
up?"

"I went to get the car keys from Elbert for tomorrow, but he's gone. He's usually in his room at this time." Lon said. He and Elbert have had a friendship of several decades. His current worry was also heartfelt.


Jennifer headed to Elbert's room. Sure enough, it was empty, but everything was still there. Something wvas definitely off.


She called Elbert's phone. After a few rings. Elbert answered,"Madam,is something wrong?" Jennifer asked. "Where are you?"


"Madam, it's Shirley. My dad wanted to go back to the hometown, so I took him. You weren't home when we left, so we didn't say goodbye."Shirley grabbed the phone and explained.


Jennifer was puzzled. thinking. 'I've been home all day. How did this happen?


She said. "Alright, take care of your dad. If you need help, call Lon."

Jennifer knew something was up. She called Patrick, but he didn't pick up.

After hanging up. Shirley thought. 'Jennifer's attitude changes so fast. She pretends to care about me and my dad just to keep up appearances. If she's so fake, she can't blame me for being ruthless!


"Dad, after we get back to the hometown, are you planning to return to Rivera Manor?" Shirley asked suddenly. Elbert squinted and said, "If Mr.Rivera needs me, I'll go back. If he's doing well, I'll stay in the hometown.
I follow Madam and Mr. Rivera!"


Seeing Elbert's hopeful look, Shirley was furious. If murder wasn't a crime,she'd want to kill Elbert. How could fate give her such a father?
Jennifer went back to her room, thinking it over. This wasn't like Elbert.He wouldn't leave without a word, especially with his attachment to Patrick. Jennifer thought. 'Did Shirley cause trouble?' Jennifer truly understands Shirley well enough.


When they pushed open the door of the Oakwood Homestead, a strange smell hit them, causing Shirley to cough. Elbert seemed both normal and off at the same time. As he walked in, Shirley followed, surprised to find the place spotless.


Shirley was confused. How could this be? No wonder Elbert always wanted to come back here. She was the one holding him back! She didn't even notice Elbert's expression. Coming back here was what he really wanted, even if he always seemed distracted.


Suddenly, Elbert said. "We need to clean up a bit. It's been a while since we stayed here." Shirley looked around, surprised. "The place is spotless.Why would we need to clean?"


Shirley pulled out her phone and quickly typed a message. The night sky in the hometown was beautiful, with mountains, stars, and fresh air.


As she glanced at her phone, she realized she'd caused more trouble than she thought. The reply she got was: [Emily's surgery was successful,but she hasn't woken up.]


Feeling nervous, Shirley replied, telling the person to hurry back to the Oakwood Homestead.


After tidying up for a bit, Elbert said, "It's late. Go wash up and get some sleep."

Shirley felt something was off. Elbert seemed more normal after coming
back here.

As the night grew darker. Elbert went to bed early. as usual. After a while.Shirley,sitting on the sofa, got another message: [I'm here.]


She grabbed her mini bag and quietly slipped out of the house.closing the door gently so she wouldn't wake Elbert. She walked quickly to the roadside. where a black car was waiting. The back door opened, and she got in.


"How is she? Did I go too easy on her today?" Shirley dropped her obedient act.


The man replied. "After you left. Marlon showed up, called an ambulance.her friends had been accompanying the translation as well, and I followed them to the hospital. I stayed until the surgery was over before leaving."


"Come here!" Shirley demanded. The man got out of the driver's seat and came to the back. Shirley grabbed him by the neck, and they kissed passionately. Shirley let out a moan, igniting the man's desire.


Faċing Shirley's dominance, the man kissed her back, his tongue exploring her mouth. Shirley responded eagerly, tearing off his clothes. The car windows fogged up, and their breathing grew rapid.


Suddenly, they heard Elbert's voice not far away, "Shirley, where did you go?" The man, caught in the moment, was annoyed by the interruption.He pushed Shirley away and said, "Go back quickly. I'll update you later.Remember to behave."


Shirley pretended to make a phone call as she walked back to the Oakwood Homestead. "Dad. I'm on an important call. Did I wake you?Sorry if I did."
Elbert replied, "No, but there are wild animals around here. Be careful when you're alone. I got up to use the bathroom and saw you weren't there,so I got worried!"
###Chapter 69 Twilight Enchantment Lounge

Patrick was fuming over Emily's escape, so he called up Ots, the owner of Twilight Enchantment Lounge, and booked a room. Then he sent a message to Vincent and Willard.


Patrick: [Meet me at Twilight Enchantment Lounge at 8 PM.]


Vincent and Willard were taken aback when they got the message and quickly replied: [Got it!]


They started chatting in their group chat.

Vincent: [What's up with Patrick today, booking a room at Twilight Enchantment Lounge?]


Willard: [Something's definitely up.]

Otis: [I think so too.]

Vincent and Willard couldn't wait to get to the lounge.

At eight. Patrick rolled up in his AMC sports car. As he pushed open the door, he saw two guys in black holding umbrellas at the entrance, with Vincent and Willard standing nearby.


"It's not even raining!" Patrick said,frowning.


"Mind your own business! We're trying out the Eldoria tycoon look!"Vincent said.flicking his hair dramatically.


"Are we drinking or what?" Willard asked from under his umbrella.

"Every time we go out, it's the same old thing. Tonight, I'm having Otis set me up with twenty girls!" Vincent said, clapping his hands like a
playboy.

Otis stood on the steps, unimpressed, and asked, "Emily didn't come?"


"Since when do you care about Emily? I liked her first!" Vincent snapped at Otis.


"What did she do to piss you off this time? You two have been at it for years," Willard said, waving his hand for the security guard to step back.


Patrick, not interested in talking about Emily's antics, led the way inside,and the three friends followed him into the private room.


Even though Otis wasn't into playing around with women, he had to admit that the place was packed with beautiful women. Most of them weren't even staff; they just came here willingly because the bar was their hangout spot.

Even if it was just for a night. it was worth it. And if someone was lucky,marrying into a wealthy family wasn't just a dream. Fairy tales like that often happened in Sunshine Bay City or Shadow City.


As soon as Patrick and his friends sat down, the waitress whispered something to Otis. He nodded, and she bowed to everyone before leaving with her walkie-talkie.


"New girl?" Vincent asked, leaning back on the sofa and tilting his head at Otis.


Otis lit a cigarette, nodded, and said,"No idea."


Soon, the door opened again, and a bunch of stylishly dressed girls walked in, blowing kisses to Patrick and his friends. Willard stayed calm,Otis looked indifferent. Patrick had a chilling vibe, and Vincent had a playful
grin.

The waitress opened all the bottles of wine she brought in, including XO and Romanée-Conti. The table was covered with various types of alcohol.and the girls' eyes lit up instantly. The waitress opened all the bottles of wine, from XO to Romanticony, and the girls' eyes lit up instantly.

The girls had already zeroed in on their targets. They weren't staff.just here to have fun. If they clicked with someone, great. If not,they'd move on. But not paying after having fun? That was like a free-for-all, and Twilight Enchantment Lounge had a vibe no ordinary club could match.


One pretty girl tried to cozy up to Patrick, her perfume wafting over.He stood up and moved to a corner. Seeing this, she switched gears and sat next to Otis instead.


A club staff member in a black dress and stockings poured wine for Patrick,saying. "Mr. Rivera, it's been a while since you've been here. Let's have a good time tonight!"


Patrick raised his glass and downed it in one go, not caring who he was toasting with, just wanting to drink.


Thinking Patrick was easygoing, the new girls approached him with their glasses, saying softly, "Mr. Rivera, nice to meet you." Patrick didn't even glance at them, just finished his drink again.


Seeing Patrick so accommodating, the two girls sat on either side of him.One even tried to link arms with him. Patrick smoothly moved his arm away and said in a low voice, "Back off!"


Just as the two girls were left confused, Willard's phone rang. Seeing an unfamiliar number, he ignored it and hung up. But the number kept
calling. Annoyed, he stepped out of the private room to answer. The urgent voice on the other end said. "Emily is injured and in the hospital.If you can find Patrick, please tell him, thank you!"


Willard was about to ask who it was, but the caller hung up. He stood at the door,thinking for a moment, then walked back in. Even though Patrick and Emily were on the outs, this was serious. If Patrick found out later,he'd be furious.


Avoiding the noise. Willard leaned in and whispered to Patrick, "Emily is injured."


Patrick's eyes flickered, and he asked coldly. "Where is she?"

Willard grabbed his coat and asked. "Want us to come with you?"

Patrick didn't respond. He was thinking. 'How bad is it? Is she bleeding?'

The three friends had an unspoken understanding. When Willard followed Patrick out, the other two ditched the women and booze without hesitation.


The girls left in the private room stared blankly as the four left like a gust of wind, then turned their attention to the bottles on the table. Soon,the room was filled with sounds of revelry.


On the way. Patrick nervously held his phone, tapping his fingers on his watch. Though he didn't speak, Vincent could sense his agitation. Willard had just told them about Emily being in the hospital.


The night air grew colder, and the hospital was bustling with people coming and going.


Patrick glancedat Vincent walking ahead, squinted slightly, ignored him.and continued towards the hospital entrance.
###Chapter 70 Mr. Rivera Goes Berserk

Vincent strolled up to the reception desk on the first floor and asked. "Hey.can you tell me which room Emily's in?"


The nurse, clearly smitten by Vincent's good looks. couldn't help but stare.


Patrick came up next and quietly asked. "Excuse me. which room is Emily in?" The nurse turned and was taken aback by yet another incredibly handsome guy!


She thought. Who gets to date such good-looking guys? She softly replied."Room 203."


As Vincent reached the elevator, he suddenly remembered something and glanced at the outpatient category on the second floor,which was Obstetrics and Gynecology.


Without a second thought, Patrick walked into the elevator and hit the button for the second floor.


Vincent stayed quiet, standing to the side, just staring at Patrick's profile.

Patrick quickly got to the door of the second-floor ward but hesitated,his hand frozen on the doorknob.


Vincent said."Ifyou can't swallow your pride, let's just head back!"

Patrick wasn't worried about pride; he just couldn't face Emily!

Since they were already there, he figured he might as well go in and check on her!


Vincent reached out first, about to gently push open the ward door, but a
voice stopped him.

Because Room 203 was a private ward, a nurse came up and asked. "Who are you? The patient just had surgery and needs rest. Don't disturb her."

Hearing this, Patrick asked, "What's her condition now? Is it serious?"

The nurse frowned and said. "The patient just hadsurgery and needs rest.Who are you to her? Don't you know she's been malnourished for a long time?"


The nurse looked at Patrick, then thought about the frail figure inside.thinking. 'Boyfriends these days are so unreliable. They don't care about their girlfriends with such serious conditions.


Vincent and Patrick sat on a bench in the corridor.

Patrick stared at Room 203, unsure of what to say. while the sound of rain outside grew louder.


Just then, he saw a girl walking towards them from the elevator. It was Melissa. Emily's good friend.


Patrick hurried over, grabbing Melissa's shoulder and demanding, "What's wrong with Emily? Why hasn't she woken up yet? Tell me everything you know!"


Melissa pushed Patrick's hand away and said, "Mr. Rivera,get a grip.When you were having your romantic moments with your beloved, did you ever think about her? If you want to know what's going on, ask her yourself!"


Vincent also approached. The two nodded at each other, and Vincent said to Melissa, "Melissa, can we talk in private?"
Melissa glanced at Vincent. saw his polite demeanor, and nodded.following him to the side.


After hearing what Melissa said, Patrick ran his hand through his hair in frustration. He hated not being in control of everything now.


Patrick had no one to vent his anger on. It seemed like no one. except the person lying in the hospital bed.


He wanted to rush in and tell Emily. "Please don't leave me." This was his inner thought. something he couldn't say to anyone. Patrick leaned against the wall alone, feeling a bit dizzy.

Vincent and Melissa went to the stairwell.

Vincent introduced himself. "I'm also Emily's high school classmate.
Vincent. Can you tell me what happened to Emily?"


Melissa looked Vincent up and down, then slowly said,"If you just want to know why Emily's in the hospital, you might want to ask Patrick; he might know better."


Accompanied by Patrick, who was Patrick's friend. Melissa didn't want to reveal too many details.

Indeed,hiding this was what she should do.

"No, I want to know why Emily got injured," Vincent said.

"Someone had a conflict with her." Melissa thought mentioning Shirley's situation wasn't snitching.


"Do I know this person?"

"Shirley. Patrick's 'little sister'," Melissa said with a sarcastic tone.
Vincent chuckled. "Thank you."

Having achieved his goal. Vincent took a few steps forward. then rurned back to look at Melissa.


"Dear little sister, do you have time for a meal with me?"

"No." Melissa rolled her eyes and thought to herself. 'Truly not a good person.


Vincent returned to the ward door. watching Patrick. who was caught between staying and leaving. sighing. He softly asked. "The danger has passed. If you don't want to go in, come with me. This matter might involve you a bit."


However. Patrick showed no intention of leaving; he was still immersed in her world of regret. He regretted not teling Emily how he truly felt and that she held a special place in his heart. He knew that confessing his feelings would bring uncertainties for her.


There might be reasons for his unspoken love that no one else knew! For Patrick, his love was just something he couldn't admit.


Patrick didn't know where to go. As he was about to get up. he heard a voice softly asking Melissa. "Is Emily awake? It's been two hours?"

The voice sounded very familiar. He looked up and saw Marlon.


Patrick grabbed Marlon by the collar, saying. "Why are you here? Is it because of you that Emily...?"


Marlon replied impatiently, "Mr. Rivera, what are you accusing me of now?Do you think you have the right to question me?"
Vincent hurried over, pulled Patrick aside, and looked Marlon up and down,realizing that Marlon seemed even more confident than Patrick.Emily's boss.


Patrick swung a fist at Marlon's cheek, and Marlon grabbed Patrick's collar and punched him back, hitting Patrick's jaw. The slightly tipsy Patrick was instantly sobered by the blow.


He staggered to the side, still processing what had happened. Marlon then said. "This is a hospital! Emily is still inside and hasn't woken up! If you want to go crazy.get out!"


Patrick's worry and anger turned into strength, and he stood up against the wall, pointing at Marlon as if he was about to explode.

Marlon timely said. "Mr. Rivera, are you planning to fight me in a hospital?
You don't have the right to vent your anger on me. Emily is my employee.
I must be by her side. As for you, go find your first love, don't embarrass yourself here!"

At that moment, a weak voice came from the ward.


"Melissa," Emily called out. Melissa quickly opened the door and saw that Emily had finally woken up. She hugged Emily, saying, "What happened just now?"


Marlon. Vincent, and Patrick all walked in.


Marlon brought the dinner he had specially bought downstairs,not knowing what Emily liked to eat.


Following the doctor's orders, he bought light food suitable for a patient.

He placed the food in front of Emily's bed and said, "Emily, now that you'
re awake, you can eat something!"

Emily thanked Marlon in a weak voice.


Then she glanced at the two people in the corner of the room, but didn't say anything.


At that moment, the nurse came in for a check-up.


After looking arounad the room, the nurse said, "The patient just woke up.please leave if you're not family."


Vincent looked at Patrick, raised his chin, indicating that Patrick should speak up, as he didn't want to be considered an outsider.


Patrick, seeing the weak Emily, wanted to rush forward to hold her and check on her, but before he could move, the nurse repeated, "The patient just woke up, you can leave now!"


Patrick had no intention of leaving. He saw that Emily, whom he cared about, didn't even look at him.


"Emily," Patrick said.


"Didn't you hear what the nurse said? I need to rest now. Please leave,"Emily said.

Hearing this, Patrick turned and left without looking back.
###Chapter 71 The "Dad-Style" Doctor

A middle-aged doctor in a white coat, with a polished demeanor but a bald spot, led a bunch of interns into Emily's room. Sunlight poured through the windows, giving the white walls and sheets a warm glow. The faint smell of disinfectant permeated the room, and a sense of tension lingered in the quiet.


The doctor walked in with steady steps, the interns trailing behind him,their footsteps echoing in the quiet room. His gaze was sharp and serious,like he was trying to soIve a big mystery.


"You're lucky you got here in time," the doctor said. "You could've put both your lives at risk! Why would you go to a crowded mall while pregnant? Even with flat shoes, you should know the first three months are critical. Stay away from crowded places!"


As the chief physician at Pearl Peak City General Hospital, he often saw young pregnant women who didn't take it seriously, only to end up heartbroken when things went wrong. As an obstetrician, he wanted every baby to come into the world safely.


His words hit Emily hard. She looked down, feeling guilty and uneasy.She knew she had been careless and almost caused a disaster. She gently stroked her belly. feeling the baby inside, silently promising to be more careful from now on.


After scolding Emily, the doctor turned to Marlon, who was standing nearby, taking food out of a bag. "And you, as her husband, didn't take care of her properly." The doctor looked at Marlon, clearly thinking he was Emily's husband.

Marlon was caught off guard, a bit embarrassed. He opened his mouth to
explain, but decided it wasn't the right time. He quietly put down the food.feeling a mix of emotions. He looked at Emily with concern. but mostly shock, realizing she was in the hospital because she was pregnant. not just from fainting.


"Some pregnant women may experience weakness and malnutrition.especially if they do not have access to proper prenatal care. You're lucky to have this child. Your progesterone is low. estrogen is low. and you haven't done any pre-pregnancy checks or taken folic acid. progesterone.DHA. ARA. or even cod liver oil." the doctor continued. his tone full of concern.


Emily tensed up. She knew her health wasn't great. but she didn't expect pregnancy to bring so many complications. She bit her lip. unsure if she could provide a healthy environment for her baby.


"What kind of food are you bringing? Pizza? And this Mexican chicken wrap? How can a pregnant woman eat something so spicy? No more takeout for her!" the doctor scolded Marlon, looking at the food in his hand.


Seeing Melissa reaching for snacks, the doctor chimed in, "When you make chicken soup, skim off the oil on top. Don't let the pregnant woman get too fat. Moderation is key, you know? And cut down on the snacks; they can mess with her hormones!" Melissa nodded quickly. not wanting to get scolded for being late.


The room got tense. Melissa shrank back, thinking, 'This doctor is intense;his presence is overwhelming!' She glanced at Emily with pity and helplessness. She knew Emily had been working hard, struggling to make ends meet, and now with the pregnancy, her body was even weaker.Melissa silently vowed to take good care of Emily and the baby.
Despite his bald spot, the doctor was sharp. He rattled off all the things a pregnant woman needed to know. then left the room with his interns.


Once they were gone. the room returned to its quier state. Sunlight still streamed in, warm and peaceful. Emily lay on the bed. staring out the window, her mind racing with thoughts. She had no idea what the future held or how this baby would change her life.


Marlon was left speechless by the doctor's scolding. He watched the doctor leave. then turned to Emily. lying silently on the bed. "You're pregnant? Is the child...?"


Marlon was shocked and confused. He couldn't believe Emily was pregnant. He looked at her. his eyes filled with mixed emotions. He had a hunch about who the father was but hoped for a different answer. He didn't know what Emily's plans were. especially since he was trying to win her over.


Emily lowered her eyes, not wanting to admit the child was Patrick's. She felt like saying it out loud would cause trouble for Marlon. Seeing her silence, Marlon pulled up a chair and sat by her bedside.


Emily was torn. She didn't know how to answer Marlon's questions. She didn't want him to know the child's father was Patrick, not wanting to burden him. She felt she had already caused him enough trouble.


"Emily, is it Patrick's child? Do you want to keep this baby?" Marlon's voice was soft and gentle, filled with concern. He knew Emily and Patrick's relationship was complicated and that she had sacrificed a lot for him.


Marlon couldn't understand why Emily ended up pregnant with Patrick's child, and he didn't know what she planned to do. To him. Emily and Patrick's relationship was like a deep, tortured love story.
Emily pursed her lips. then nodded. "I want to keep the baby."


She was determined. She knew this child was a bond berween her and Patrick. and she didn't want to give up on it. She feit the baby was a gift from God and wanted to protect it.


"Does Patrick know?" Marlon asked. frowning. Seeing Emily's silence, he continued. "Emily. are you saying Patrick doesn't know this child is his?"The thought of his speculation left Marlon stunned.
###Chapter 72 Where did I lose?

Marlon bad no clue How Patrick would react when he found our about the baby.Would he freak out? Ot maybe he'd just get even meaner? Marlon was mostly scared that Emily would end up getting hurt.


Emily looked down, feeling a bit hurt as she spoke. "Marlon. please don't tell him. okay? If he finds out I'm pregnant with his kid. he ll definitely make me get an abortion."


Emily didn't dare to take the risk. She suspected that Patrick probably wouldn't want the child. However. she didn't want to terminate the pregnancy. So the best solution was to keep it a secret from him.


Seeing Emily beg like that. Marlon was shocked. He knew Patrick wasn't great to Emily. but he didn't realize he was that heartless, to the point where Emily had no hope of keeping the baby.


Patrick and Emily had been together for years, but Patrick never gave her any real status. She was like an accessory to him, without any respect.


Marlon thought Emily deserved so much better. She had sacrificed so much for Patrick, only to get treated like this. He couldn't understand why she still wanted to keep the baby, and he didn't know what to do.


Marlon said gently, "Do you really want to raise this child on your own?As a friend. I think you should consider giving up the baby. You're still young, Emily. Even though you have a job at Hughes Group now. raising a child needs a stable family. Have you thought about how you ll explain things to your child when they ask about their father?"


Marlon's voice was soft and caring. He looked at Emily with concern. He knew her decision was tough, and her future would be even tougher. He
didn't want her to go through it alone and hoped she d think about her own future.


Hearing Matlon's words. Emily lifted het head with derermination. She looked straight at Marlon and said. "So if I tell Patrick. he ll suddenly want ro be a dad? Take responsibility and raise the child with me? No way! If he was willing to take responsibility. he would ve given me a proper status years ago."


Emily knew it wouldn't be easy. but she wasn't about to give up her baby.This child was her hope. She didn't want it to be a burden on Patrick or something she'd regret later.


"Marlon, if you really see me as a friend. promise me you won't tell Patrick about this." Emily's voice was soft but firm. She gazed at Marlon,her eyes filled with pleading.


Marlon could no longer bear it and nodded. conflicted. "Emily, have you ever thought? Maybe I could..."


He was torn, not sure what to do. He looked at Emily, his eyes filled with compassion. He knew that Emily's decision was difficult. and he also understood that her future would be challenging. He didn't want her to bear so much alone; he hoped she would consider her own future.


Emily placed her hand on his, saying. "Marlon, you're not just my friend.you're also the CEO of Hughes Group. Your family isn't just any family.I ve met your parents; they'd never accept a woman carrying another man's child. I don't want to hurt you, but I've only ever seen you as a friend. not anything more."


Emily's voice was low and gentle as she looked at Marlon. her gaze resolute and pure.
Marlon felt like his heatt hed been shattered. He knew Emily was right.but it was still hard to accept. His eves were fifled with pain and helplessness. He felt like his world was falfing mpwrt.


He had hoped that Emily working at Hughes Group might make her see his feelings. He even considered being a stepfather to her child. But he never expected such a firm rejection. Marlon smniled bitterly.


"Do I not have a single chance?" Marlon asked. unwilling to accept it. His voice was low and gentle as he looked at Emily. He knew his request was unreasonable. but he had no other way. He didn't want to give up on Emily: he felt she was the best girl he had ever met.


Emily forced a smile at the corners of her mouth and said to Marlon."Marlon. can wve be good friends for life? If you're willing. when the child grows up. you can be their godfather." Emily's voice was low and gentle:she knew her words would hurt, but she didn't want to give Marlon false hope. She believed he was a good person who deserved a better future.


Marlon let out a deep breath, leaned back in his chair. crossed his legs.and proudly lifted his chin, saying. "I don't want a godson; how about a goddaughter?"


Marlon grinned, but the thought of a child resembling Patrick made him feel sick to his stomach.


Emily smiled knowingly, touched her belly, and softly said. "Of course. as long as you don't mind."


The atmosphere in the room warmed up. Sunlight streamed in. making everything feel peaceful. Their conversation was filled with warmth and care, their eyes full of hope for the future.
Leaning against his car, Marlon lit a cigarette and took a deep drag. He looked at his reflection in the window-6 feet 5 inches tall, broad shoulders, narrow waist, long legs. and a good family background. He thought. 'Why couldn't I win over Emily?
###Chapter 73 Finally Found Her!

Marlon was totally clueless about why he couldn't win Emily over.


He muttered to himself, "If being 0.7 inches shorter than Patrick is a dealbreaker, then I'm really screwed." He blew out a smoke ring. tracing a heart in the air, thinking. 'Emily, you've been into Patrick for ten years. but do you even know how long I've been into you? Even if you're having his baby. I can't just give up on you. I don't care. I just want to be near you.Marlon even felt as if he was about to be moved by himself. He self-deprecatingly tapped on the glass. Emily's rejection just completely knocked the wind out of him.


Marlon pounded his chest silently. trying to hold back the bitterness.Being her friend was better than being a nobody.


Thinking about Patrick. who had the nerve to come to the hospital and pick a fight today. Marlon wished he could storm into Rivera Manor and take him out. He thought. 'This jerk lives in his own little world, not appreciating what he has. Emily loves him so much, she's even willing to have his kid without any promises! Marlon crushed his cigarette and threw it on the ground angrily.


Marlon felt Emily deserved way better. He thought Patrick was a total jerk.not appreciating Emily's love. He couldn't understand why Emily was so into Patrick.


'Patrick, should I be jealous of you, or should I just hate you?'Marlon shook his head with a sigh.


As Patrick left the hospital, he sat in the car with Vincent, not letting the driver leave, and not wanting to get out himself, chain-smoking and making Vincent cough like crazy.
Smoke filled the parking lot. starlight streaming through the car window.casting a silver halo over his features. His eyes were cold and angry, his heart a mess of contradictions.


"Are you out of your mind? You hear Emily's in the hospital, rush over there, don't even ask what's wrong, just start a fight with Marlon, and then leave." Vincent waved away the smoke, clearly pissed off. Patrick turned to stare out the window at the dark parking lot. not saying a word.


Patrick was not sure why he acted so rashly. He looked out at the parking lot,feeling like his world was spinning out of control.

"Say something, Patrick. It's late. do I have to sit here all night, choking on your smoke?" Vincent rolled his eyes, continuing, "If it wasn't for my connection with Emily, I wouldn't even be here with you. Make up your mind, I'm leaving. Get out of the car, the smoke is killing me. You can have your driver pick you up."


Vincent had no idea what had gone down between Patrick and Emily.He was just there for the drama, but it was too costly, so he chose to walk away.


Vincent's words finally got Patrick out of the car. The night wind was chilly,brushing against his face as he stood there, watching Vincent's car disappear into the distance. The dim parking lot lights cast long shadows,making him feel even more alone. A mix of emotions surged within him.


He couldn't figure out why he had acted so impulsively, why he lost his cool when he heard Emily was in the hospital. He wanted to know how she was doing, but he was scared to face her.


Patrick replayed Vincent's words in his head, "You need to get to the bottom of this. Her injury might be connected to you. Marlon beating you
up just confirms my suspicion. She got hurt at the mall. so check the surveillance footage. You need to find out the truth and figure out your own feelings. Stop being so impulsive. When you treated her like crap.you didn't think she mattered. Now that she's done with you,you can't stand it.I'm not like you; I never planned to marry her. I just wanted to keep her safe." Vincent's words hit Patrick hard, like a knife to the heart.


Vincent didn't tell Shirley because he felt it was just Melissa's version of events. Without any surveillance evidence, he thought Patrick should look into it himself.


After hearing Vincent's words, Patrick, who rarely reflected on himself.struggled to think, 'Is Emily really just an accessory? When did she become so important? She could even disturb my thoughts.' Patrick shook his head, unwilling to admit it. yet finding it amusing.

Patrick stood in the empty parking lot, frowning as he tossed his cigarette butt on the ground. He had to find Emily and figure out what happened.He made a few calls and got the mall's surveillance footage.


Patrick's assistant. William Lynn, rushed to the hospital to pick him up and take him back to Rivera Manor. The streets were almost empty, the streetlights casting a dim yellow glow. William drove, sneaking glances at Patrick's expression. He knew Patrick and Emily's relationship was a mess,and he had no idea how to help.


Back at the Rivera Manor, Patrick sat on the sofa, feeling anxious. He looked at William, who handed him a tablet, and asked softly, "Have you seen it?"


William nodded, "Yeah, it's Miss Wright."

Patrick frowned."Why was she there?"
William knew Patrick was asking about Emily, and he replied softly,"Miss Thompson bought an apartment in Crystal Heights Residences. The supermarket is near her place."


Patrick was surprised by William's answer and looked up. He didn't understand why Emily chose to live in Crystal Heights Residences. He remembered that Crystal Heights Residences was close to Crystal Heights Park, and behind it was a special children's training school and a rehab center. Emily must have had reasons related to her mother and brother for buying the place.
###Chapter 74 Elbert's Obsession

Thinking about it. Patrick realized Emily was busting her butt for her family. He used to think she was just a gold digger. always taking his money without a second thought. More than once, he'd thrown cash in her face and called her a greedy whore, until he found out she was doing it all for her family.

"Why was Shirley there?" Patrick asked, still puzzled.


William shook his head. "I don't know. Miss Wright was sent back to Oakwood Homestead by Madam. She didn't have a driver with her, so I can't track her right now."


Patrick didn't know Jennifer had sent Shirley back to Oakwood Homestead,but he quickly realized it made sense. After all, Shirley had to face some consequences for the drugging incident.


Patrick also wanted Shirley to understand that he only saw her as a little sister. He didn't want her to waste her energy on him. He felt guilty towards Shirley and Elbert, so he couldn't bring himself to be too harsh.He didn't want to embarrass her.


Shirley had lost her mom young, and her dad was disabled. Patrick felt responsible for most of her troubles. If he hadn't insisted on that joyride.Elbert wouldn't have hurt his head trying to protect him and would have ended up mentally impaired.


Patrick clenched his fists, thinking Jennifer's punishment for Shirley was too harsh. He planned to bring Shirley back soon. She was used to living at the Rivera Manor. Without maids and drivers, she must be struggling.Plus, she loved being around people and following him everywhere.
Patrick genuinely saw Shirley as his little sister and cared for her deeply.So.her drugging him was both embarrassing and heartbreaking.


Patrick sat on the sofa, lost in thought. He had no idea how to handle things with Emily and Shirley. 'Women are troublesome. Why can't they all just get along?'He thought.


The morning sun at Oakwood Homestead peeked through the leaves,casting a golden glow. Shirley stood in the yard. watching Elbert push out an old motorcycle. She took a deep breath and looked annoyed.


"Dad. I've told you. I don't need you to take me to work. Even without a car, I can take a taxi, bus, or subway. It's better than riding that old motorcycle," Shirley said, sounding impatient.


Elbert waved his hand, his eyes full of love and concern. "Shirley, this motorcycle isn't broken. I fixed it last night, and it runs great. Think about it, you're so pretty. What if you run into a creep on the bus or subway?Let me take you. You can sit in the back and enjoy the ride, just like when you were a kid. How about that?"


When Elbert brought up her childhood, Shirley's eyes flared with anger.Memories of her carefree days under her parents' care flashed through her mind. But everything changed after Elbert's accident. From then on,all the fatherly care she should've gotten went to Patrick. Thinking about it made her grit her teeth in rage.


Shirley fumed, thinking. 'Patrick hurt my dad and stole the fatherly love that was supposed to be mine. How dare he reject me and send me off to Oakwood Homestead?


"Shirley, what are you daydreaming about? Get on the bike, or you'll be late for work," Elbert said, putting a cartoon-themed helmet on her head.
Her carefully styled hair was instantly flattened.

Shirley angrily yanked off the helmet, slammed it on the motorcycle. and snapped. "I told you! I don't want you to take me! How many times do I have to say it? Patrick and Jennifer only have to tell you something once.and you remember it. But I have to repeat myself over and over. Are you messing with me?" Her voice was full of frustration and anger.

Elbert, hearing her outburst, waved his hands in panic, staring at her in confusion. "Shirley, what's wrong with you?"


Seeing Elbert's hurt expression, Shirley, feeling a mix of anger and sadness.held back her tears. "I'm done talking to you. I'll be late for work. You go find something to do today. If you need anything, call me. but try not to. I'm busy."


With that, Shirley hailed a taxi, got in without looking back, and left.ignoring Elbert's frantic waving.


The sunlight shone on Elbert, making him look lonely and desolate. He watched Shirley leave, not feeling too sad, but instead muttered to himself."Shirley's grown up. She doesn't need me anymore. Madam said kids are like little eagles; they'll soar high one day." A contented smile spread across his face.


Thinking of this. Elbert felt proud of how well he had raised Shirley.He patted the helmet she left behind and said, "Good girl, focus on work! Dad will be waiting for you to come home." Then, he put on his own helmet and secured the pink one to the back seat.


Elbert rode the motorcycle along the familiar road towards the Rivera Manor. The trees on both sides were lush, and the breeze rustled the leaves. Sunlight filtered through, creating patches of light on the ground.
His mood was complicated; he looked forward to seeing Patrick but worried about Shirley's anger.


Oakwood Homestead was about 40 miles from Rivera Manor. but Elbert's motorcycle only had enough fuel for 25 miles. This meant he would have to push it for the remaining 15 miles. Along the way, he struggled to push the bike, his clothes soaked with sweat. His face showed determination.as if this was nothing.
###Chapter 75 The Daily Routine

When Elbert showed up, it was already 2 p.m. The servants at Rivera Manor saw him pushing his motorcycle and rushed over. "Elbert, why are you here so late? Is everything okay?" one of them asked.

Elbert shook his head with a sheepish smile. "Yes, everything's fine."


Rivera Manor was a sight to behold. The buildings were impressive.radiating an air of nobility. Everyone knew Elbert; he'd been around longer than anyone else, practically part of the furniture. No one really knew why Jennifer had sent Elbert and Shirley back to their hometown.but the sharp servants had their suspicions. Maybe it was some hush-hush issue.


Whatever the reason, it didn't seem to involve Elbert directly. This made everyone feel a bit more sympathy for him. They watched him, cheeks flushed, sweat soaking his jacket.


Noe Lester, the security captain, grabbed two bottles of water from the booth and handed them to Elbert. "Elbert, you're drenched. Did you walk here?" Noe asked, concern etched on his face.


Elbert chuckled, pointing to his bike. "Forgot to refuel, but it's no big deal!"Everyone got it then-Elbert had probably walked the whole way.


Noe, a recent military retiree with a knack for combat skills, had quickly risen to captain. He respected Elbert, knowing he'd also served in the military. Taking the motorcycle from Elbert, Noe said, "Come on in and grab some lunch. I'll refuel your bike so you can ride back later."


Elbert nodded, grinning. "Thanks. Noe. You're too kind." Noe scratched his head. "Elbert, if you don't mind, I have some leftover lunch. Want it?"
Elbert's eyes lit up. "Sure, I don't mind. even though I'm not hungry."Elbert wasn't great at lying, and everyone felt a pang of pity for hím. He didn't waste a bite, finishing Noe's lunch and even washing the lunchbox.


With his bike refueled, Elbert didn't seem in a hurry to leave. Someone asked, "Elbert, are you looking for someone inside? It's fine, you can go in.Madam won't mind."


Elbert shook his head. "Nope. not looking for anyone."

Noe, curious. asked, "Waiting for Mr. Rivera then?" His sharp eyes missed nothing.

Elbert grinned wider.


Noe looked puzzled. and Elbert started counting on his fingers. "There are three drivers here, besides me. One drives for Madam, and another one can drive for anyone, but his wife's sick, so he's not always around. When Mr. Rivera needs a driver. I'm the only one available. So, I gotta wait here in case he needs me."


Noe was taken aback by Elbert's words. He hadn't realized just how much Patrick meant to Elbert, whose simple heart always kept him in mind.


Noe hesitated, furrowing his brow, and whispered, "Elbert, Mr. Rivera left early this morning and hasn't come back yet."


Elbert's eyes widened, and he nodded like a child. "Okay, I'll head back then. I'll come again tomorrow."


Noe quickly grabbed his arm. "Elbert, your hometown is pretty far, and your bike's low on gas. You must've spent a lot of time getting here.How about this: if Mr. Rivera needs you, I'll call you in the morning so you don't make a wasted trip."
Elbert shook his head. "Noe. you don't get it. Mr. Rivera always has urgent stuff, but when he doesn't, he's here with Madam. I gotta be here.ready for his call. It's fine, I'm not tired." Determination shone in Elbert's eyes.


Noe sighed and pulled a piece of candy from his pocket, handing it to Elbert. "Here. Elbert, eat this. It'll help with the tiredness."


Elbert took the candy with a smile and tucked it into his pocket. "Shirley loves candy. I'll bring it back for her."


Elbert wouldn't listen to anyone's advice. Every morning, he stubbornly insisted on riding his motorbike to take Shirley, only to get scolded by her each time. After that. he would ride to the manor's gate to wait for Patrick,and then Noe would persuade him to go back. Over timne. Elbert became a familiar sight at the manor gate.


After a week, word of Elbert's daily vigil reached Jennifer. The manor buzzed with talk of his persistence-some admired his loyalty, others pitied his stubbornness. But Elbert stuck to his routine, waiting for a chance that might never come.


One warm afternoon, the sun bathed the Rivera Manor garden in a gentle glow. Jennifer sipped from an elegant coffee cup, sitting under a cool pavilion. savoring the tranquility. She squinted at the distant scenery,lost in thought.


"Does Elbert really come every day?" Jennifer asked softly, her voice clear in the peaceful air.


Efren Britton stood nearby, hands clasped, waiting respectfully. He didn't respond until Jennifer asked again, her tone tinged with doubt and emotion.
"Yes. Madam. Elbert rides that old motorcycle you gave him over a decade ago. The gas tank must've been replaced by now. His shoes are worn out;he must walk a lot every day." Efren, a decade younger than Elbert,had always respected him.


Jennifer frowned, a mix of emotions swirling inside her. She set down her coffee cup with a sigh. "Hasn't anyone told Elbert not to come?"


Elbert was a good person, and she certainly knew that. She felt that she owed Elbert a life. Therefore, transferring the punishment meant for Shirley onto Elbert made Jennifer feel very guilty.
###Chapter 76 Patrick Can't Perform Anymore

Efren shot back quickly. "Yeah, my nephew keeps telling Elbert not to come, but he just won't listen. He says ifthe family driver isn't enough, he's waiting at the entrance."


Jennifer,sipping her coffee. paused with a flicker of emotion in her eyes.She went quiet for a moment, sighed, and said, "If it weren't for Shirley.I wouldn't have the heart to let him go."


At Rivera Manor, everyone was used to seeing Elbert around every day. He'd always come out of that red-roofed, white-walled cottage, ready to help anyone who needed it. He'd help the gardener trim the flowers, water the trees, or assist the busy staff with carrying things. Elbert was the hardest worker at Rivera Manor, always showing up when someone needed him,selflessly and without complaint. He just knew that as long as someone needed him, he had a purpose.


Jennifer's thoughts drifted from Elbert to Patrick. "What's Patrick been up to lately?" she asked softly.


Efren quickly checked his tablet and replied earnestly, "Mr. Rivera is still swamped with company stuff. The group recently auctioned off two pieces of land for commercial real estate projects, so he's pretty busy."

Jennifer nodded slightly and then asked, "Emily hasn't come back to the company,has she?"


Efren shook his head, "Nope. Miss Thompson hasn't returned to the Rivera Group since she left. She's working at Hughes Group as a jewelry designer now."

"Jewelry design?" Jennifer repeated, a bit puzzled. She didn't remember
Emily studying jewelry design. But then she thought about Emily carrying Patrick's child, and a mix of emotions hit her. She didn't want Emily to stay with Marlon from the Hughes family. Thinking of this, Jennifer felt a bit annoyed, furrowing her brows and starting to plan her next move.


Crossing her legs on the chair, she thought for a moment before saying,"Arrange for Elbert to bring Shirley back sometime."


Efren hesitated, knowing about Shirley drugging Patrick before. He cautiously asked, "But what about Mr. Rivera?"


Rubbing her forehead, Jennifer said softly, "It's okay. I'm sure Patrick isn't mad anymore. Otherwise, he wouldn't let Shirley keep working at Rivera Group. Bring Elbert back so Patrick doesn't worry. You know how Patrick is. If he wants something, he won't say it directly. It's really frustrating."Jennifer really understood Patrick.


"Tell Patrick to publicly acknowledge Shirley as the Rivera family's adopted daughter," Jennifer instructed. Efren was momentarily stunned by her plan and quickly responded, "Madam."


Jennifer continued. "Shirley's grown up and has too many thoughts. Being Elbert's daughter, she will always have a connection with the Rivera family.We owe her, but I can't let her become Patrick's wife. Let her be the adopted daughter of the Rivera family, it'll be easier for her to find a partner in the future. And set up a few blind dates for her, to completely cut off her thoughts about Patrick."


Efren nodded and said, "Madam, you've thought it through. I'll get on it right away. Should I inform Mr. Rivera about the rest?"


Jennifer shook her head. "No, I'll handle it. Don't let Patrick worry about this. He's got enough on his plate with the company. As the lady of the
Rivera family. it's my job to make sure everything runs smoothly. Every decision here can change the course of our family's future."


Meanwhile. Patrick lay in bed, the first rays of morning sunlight creeping through the curtains. But his heart was heavy. For five days straight.he hadn't had a morning erection, and it was driving him nuts. At first. he blamed it on the drug Shirley gave him, but as the days passed with no change,his anxiety grew.


"Damn, what's happening to me?" he said to himself. punching the bed in frustration. He considered calling the family doctor. but couldn't swallow his pride. He picked up his phone, scrolling through his contacts. but there was no one he trusted enough to confide in. If Vincent and the guys found out, they'd never let him live it down. Regretting his decision to go easy on Emily, he felt even more frustrated.


Checking the time, he saw he had no important meetings today. He decided to head to the hospital tofigure out what was wrong.

William, holding a suit, looked at Patrick in surprise. Patrick was dressed in casual clothes, wearing a mask and a cap. "Mr. Rivera, where are you going?"


Patrick grabbed the keys from William's hand. "Don't follow me. I have personal stuff to take care of." Without waiting for a response, he left Rivera Manor.


Williamn. Patrick's personal assistant, was puzzled. He checked Patrick's schedule but found nothing unusual. Since Patrick didn't want him to follow, he decided to take the day off.

Patrick arrived at Pearl Peak City General Hospital. The place was packed,and the noise only added to his stress. He found the office of an old, white-
haired doctor,feeling anxious.

"How long has this been going on?" the old doctor asked,looking at Patrick,who was reluctant to take off his pants. Getting an appointment with such a top expert wasn't easy; it required connections and a hefty fee.


"Five days," Patrick said, stiffening his neck. The old doctor nodded.writing "one week" on the medical record. "Besides not having morning erections, do you also lack interest in women?"


Patrick turned his head, thinking. He usually wasn't interested in other women, except for Emily. He wondered, "Why is it that only Emily makes me feel something? Is it just habit or real love?" This question left him deep in thought.
###Chapter 77 Going Home with Emily

Patrick's mind wandered back to memories of Emily. She was always there for him, her every expression burned into his memory. He remembered her serious work face, her occasional stubbornness, and that complicated look she gave him. He couldn't tell if what he felt for her was love or just possessiveness.


Seeing Patrick lost in thought, the doctor pressed on, "Come on, don't be shy. Drop your pants so I can take a look. We need to check things out properly."


With a huff. Patrick yanked down his pants. "Just stop talking," he snapped. The doctor shook his head. reached out, and carefully examined Patrick's condition.


"Sir, if you don't take care of this, you might have problems down the line,"the doctor warned, sounding almost smug.


Patrick shot up, furious. "That's nonsense! I'm still young. I'm fine! Don't make stuff up." He grabbed his coat and stormed out before the doctor could even prescribe anything.


Stomping down the hospital corridor, Patrick glanced at the signs,his feet unconsciously leading him to Emily's ward. Their last encounter had ended badly, and he hadn't even checked on her health since. Emily was always a workhorse, pulling late nights and overtime like it was nothing.


To Patrick, Emily had always seemed invincible. But now, after joining Marlon's company, she seemed so fragile. He wondered, 'Was I too hard on her before?' Standing at her door, he hesitated, unsure whether to go in.

His heart was a mess. Part of him wanted to see Emily, but another part
was scared to face her. He didn't know how to deal with the woman who had always supported him or their tangled relationship. He raised his hand to knock but froze, caught in indecision.


"Looking for someone? I've seen you around before!" A nurse in a pink cap, holding a blanket, stood behind him. eyeing him curiously. It wasn't every day a guy like Patrick showed up in the obstetrics and gynecology department.


"You're here for Emily. right? She just checked out. If you hurry. you might catch her in the parking lot." With that. Patrick bolted out of the hospital.


He really wanted to see Emily, even to prove to himnself that he could still get it up. But thinking of her frailty made him squash that impulse.


The parking lot was pretty empty, maybe because it wasn't the weekend.As soon as he stepped out of the elevator, he spotted Emily getting into a pink Jaguar-the car he had bought her. On their third anniversary, Emily hugged Patrick's waist and acted cute for the first time. Patrick knew she wanted a serious commitment, but he just gave her a car to placate her and warned her not to expect too much.


Even though she left Maple Peak Apartments, she still kept the car. Emily must be pretty sentimental. Patrick suddenly remembered the day Emily showed up at Maple Peak Apartments out of the blue-she must have forgotten something. He thought about it for a moment, then got into his own car and quietly followed Emily all the way to Crystal Heights Residences before turning back.


After Melissa followed Emily back to Pearl Peak City, she only stayed at Crystal Heights Residences for a short while. The Clark family in Pearl Peak City was a big deal, and Melissa's health was slowly getting better.
She was also at the age where her family started arranging blind dates for her. Even though Melissa wasn't thrilled about it, she couldn't go against her elders' wishes. So, after making sure Emily was settled. Melissa left.


As for Marlon, being the CEO of a big company, he couldn't always be around Emily. Right now. Emily was alone on the couch,watching TV and sipping water. She had been in the hospital for five days. and the doctor had told her that her progesterone and estrogen levels were low. If she didn't take care of herself. the baby might not make it.


For the sake of the baby, she took a long leave for the first time. Marlon was understanding.way better than Patrick. In the past, when she was sick and asked Patrick for a day off, he'd just say. "Are you dying? If not.keep working."


Emily had gotten used to dragging herself to work, even when she was sick. It was like being sick was a luxury she couldn't afford around Patrick.She sighed heavily, thinking. 'Patrick, all these years I've been like a robot by your side.' Just as she was cursing Patrick in her mind, the doorbell rang.


Emily thought, 'Who could that be? Did Melissa forget something?Without thinking, she opened the door, only to find Patrick standing there,looking cold. She tried to close the door, but Patrick wedged his hand in and pushed it open.


Emily,off balance, almost fell, but Patrick grabbed her arm and pulled her into his arms. It was then that Emily realized she was only wearing a silk camisole nightgown.


Seeing the desire in Patrick's eyes, Emily crossed her arms over her chest and said sternly,"Get out, you're not welcome here." She was filled with panic and anger, not understanding why Patrick was suddenly here. She
just wanted him to leave.

Patrick's strong hands grabbed Emily's wrists and lifted them above her head. Her chest. now exposed. was squeezed into a perfect shape. Patrick couldn't help but swallow.


"What are you doing? If you don't stop, I'll scream." Emily was startled by Patrick's sudden dominance. She squirmed and tried to resist. Patrick's other hand grabbed her waist. pulling her close.


Standing at 6'6". Patrick towered over Emily. who was 5'5". Looking down.he could see her bare breasts and her nipples trembling slightly. Emily's face turned red, her pink earlobes as alluring as ever.
###Chapter 78 No Smoking Allowed in My Hou

Patrick's aggressive gaze swept over Emily from top to bottom,shamelessly scrutinizing her through the silk nightgown. Emily feIt his look gradually shift from icy cold to fiery hot, and even Patrick's breath began to become oppressive.


This wasn't the first time Emily had seen such desire in Patrick's eyes. She quickly lifted her knee to push against him, and Patrick instinctively bent backward. Seizing the moment. Emily broke free from his grip and retreated into the room. She grabbed the door with both hands.attempting to close it. but Patrick reacted just in time, placing his hand and foot against the door.


Even though Patrick reacted quickly, he still got his hand caught in the doorframe. He glanced at the red mark on his hand and pressed his knee firmly against the door.


"Do you really hate me this much? Or are you just playing hard to get?"Patrick narrowed his eyes, his grip on the door unwavering. No matter how hard Emily tried, she couldn't close the door.


"Let go! You lunatic!" Perhaps it was Emily's resolute resistance or the word "lunatic" that triggered Patrick. With a shove, she was instantly pushed back a few steps by the door's recoil.

Patrick loosened his tie while unbuttoning the cuffs of his shirt. Emily sighed, turned, and grabbed a thin blanket from the sofa, wrapping it around herself. She sat cross-legged on the sofa, looking upat Patrick.

"Mr. Rivera, what exactly do you want to do by barging in here? Are you here to rob me or to beat up a former employee? You can tell me, and I'll try my best to cooperate, but please maintain some respect. I'm a person,
not a prostitute you can summon at will."

Patrick knelt on one knee in front of Emily. gripping her chin and pulling her toward him. "Are you in love with Marlon?" Patrick's deep gaze fixed intently on Emily. as if seeking an answer. But if that answer wasn't what he wanted. he could easily belittle this woman who didn't know her place.


"It hurts!" Tears shimmered in Emily's defiant eyes, but she refused to let them fall.


"Say it!" Patrick's grip on her chin tightened as his other hand grasped the back of her neck. Emily suddenly gave up her resistance, tilting her head back softly, yet her gaze was still angled down at Patrick.


In that instant. Patrick felt a pang in his heart. Although it was fleeting, he still averted his gaze and released Emily. She let out a breath.


"If you're here to seek revenge, there's no need. There's nothing between Marlon and me-never has been, isn't now. and won't be in the future."


Upon hearing this, Patrick tilted his head, then stood up and walked to the window, pulling out a cigarette from his pocket. He hadn't even had a chance to light it when Emily suddenly approached from behind,grabbing his hand and snatching the lighter away.


"This is my house; smoking is not allowed." Emily placed the lighter on the coffee table. Patrick frowned slightly.

"Is this your reason for buying a place of your own?"

"That's none of your business. Anyway, smoking is not allowed in my house. Mr. Rivera, if you have nothing else, please leave. I'm tired today and need to rest."
Patrick broke the cigarette in his long fingers. tobacco and white paper fragments scattering all over the floor.


Emily couldn't help but frown repeatedly. Patrick sneered. took off his suit jacket, and sat on the three-seat sofa. his legs spread wide with a strong sense of aggression.


"I won't say it a second time-come here!" Patrick's tone was icy. his aura fully unleashed. In the past. Emily had always feared Patrick when he was like this.


"No! I told you, this is my house! I don't welcome you! How much clearer do I need to be? Or do you want me to call the police before you leave?"Emily deliberately avoided Patrick's gaze. turning her head stubbornly, her voice calm.


"Emily, you have quite the nerve. You should know that whether this is your house or not, as long as I want to, I can stay here indefinitely. There's nothing I. Patrick, can't get."

Patrick was getting agitated, and his words were becoming reckless.

Hearing Patrick say this, Emily sat back down on her small sofa, wrapping herself tightly in the blanket, leaning her head back, and no longer speaking to Patrick.


"Come here." Patrick lightly tapped his fingers on the armrest of the sofa.his tone growing colder.


Emily suddenly thought, 'What if Patrick really forced me later? Should I tell him about the child? If I didn't, would the child be in danger?'


She didn't dare to take that risk. She stood up in anger and then sat down beside Patrick.

"I'm not feeling well." Emily's tome softerred. resembling her past attitude of seeking peace.


Patrick's hand, which was about to reach for her shoulder. fell to her lower back.


"I remember, isn't it your period these days?"


Patrick spoke casually. but Emily felt a storm raging in her heart.When did Patrick start caring about whether she was on her period? In the past.whenever he wanted her, he never cared. and there were times it was a "bloody battle." Emily remained silent.


Patrick's hand covered Emily's back. "You're so thin. If you're having a hard time, just come back with me. There's no need to suffer alone."

Patrick thought he was being considerate. but Emily still shook her head.

"No need, Patrick, I really don't feel well today. I want to rest. If you really like it here, I can let you have the living room, or there are plenty of guest rooms. You can choose one to mnake do with; I don't have the enèrgy to entertain you."


"Ah?! What are you doing? Patrick?! Put me down!" Emily didn't expect Patrick to suddenly lift her from the sofa.


"Since you're not feeling well, let's go to the hospital. Staying at home won't help you recover. If resting could cure you, all the hospitals in the country would have to close down."


"I won't go! Patrick! Put me down! I'm not going to the hospital! I'm just tired, fatigued, do you understand? It's not a physical illness."

"Is your fatigue directed at me or...?"
"Patrick. please stop this. I really need some personal space."

Emily kept pushing him away. but refused to go to the hospital. Patrick suddenly smirked.


He placed Emily back on the sofa. then stood up. pointing at the closed guest room. "There's not a man hiding in there. is there?"


Emily was taken aback for a moment. and Patrick took a long stride,crossing over the small coffee table. beginning to look around Emily's house.
###Chapter 79 Delayed Calm

Patrick stood up and took a look around the house. surprised to find it was actually pretty spacious. Besides the three bedrooms. there was a bright and sunny study. Back when Emily lived at Maple Peak Apartments. she had a similar setup. She loved reading by the window in the early morning light. always saying it was the best time of day.

After Patrick checked out all the rooms. Emily stood with her armns crossed.leaning against the door frame. "Mr. Rivera. are you done snooping around? No other men hiding here. right? Can you leave now?" she said.clearly trying to get rid of him. Patrick frowned. about to lose his temper.but Emily cut him off. "Mr. Rivera, this is my place. and it has nothing to do with you. You barged in without my permission. and I could have called the cops. If you don't leave now. I will." Her stern words made Patrick pause.


Patrick took off his sports jacket, revealing a round-neck T-shirt underneath. He usually stuck to formal wear, being the CEO of the Rivera Group and all, so this casual look was a rare sight for Emily. It reminded her of their college days when she used to follow him around,watching him with his girlfriend. She'd even secretly wish they'd break up.


It was unclear whether her curse had been too effective or if Patrick and his girlfriend simply didn't have strong enough feelings for each other, but in the end, they drifted apart.


Noticing Emily staring at him, Patrick spread his arms and leaned back on the sofa. With his 6-foot-6 wingspan, he looked like a powerful protector,oozing charm. Emily, standing by the door frame. couldn't help but feel drawn to him, her heart racing and cheeks flushing. She had to admit.Patrick was quite the catch with his tall frame, deep eyes,and sharp


Snapping out of it. Emily felt embarrassed by how easily she was affected.She pinched her arm, trying to snap herself back to reality. 'Patrick hurt you so much before, do you really want to go back to that?' she thought.She tried to calm the storm inside her. reminding herself not to fall for Patrick's charm again.


"Come here!" Patrick's voice was commanding. Emily took a few steps forward before realizing she wasn't his secretary anymore and didn't have to obey him.


She stopped. lifted her chin, and said. "Why should I come to you just because you say so? Please leave. you're not welcome here." Her eyes were full of stubbornness and determination, refusing to let Patrick control her.


Seeing Emily so drawn to him yet still resisting. Patrick felt a sense of familiarity. Her stubbornness and persistence reminded him of the Emily he used to know.


"Don't make me say it again. Come here." Patrick's voice dropped, laced with irritation. Emily could tell he was getting pissed. but she wasn't about to back down this time. She'd finally foundthe guts to leave him, blowing all her savings on this place just to get away from him. After years of being his shadow, she'd gotten nothing in return.


Emily knew being pregnant wouldn't change Patrick's mind. He'd probably think she was trying to trap him with the baby, seeing her as nothing but a goldl-digger. It was laughable. The real schemer was right under his nose, and he had no clue. Her eyes turned cold as she pointed to the door, "Please leave, Mr. Rivera."


Patrick's face shifted through a ranage of emotions, but he still seemed set
on kicking her out. A weird mix of anger and loss bubbled up inside him.Why was Emily so hell-bent on pushing him away?


Patrick pulled something from his pocket. walked to the window. and opened it. He dangled the item outside. "This floor's pretty high. Think it would break if it fell? Even if it's not valuable. it would probably shatter.right?" Emily's eyes widened in shock. It was the bracelet Brian had given her. How did Patrick get his hands on it?


Panic surged through Emily as she lunged to grab the bracelet. Patrick yanked her into his arms. feeling her desperation. She struggled to snatch it back, forgetting she was still in her thin silk nightgown. Her soft breasts pressed against his chest. and Patrick felt a familiar stir in his groin. This time, he was sure-he could get turned on by Emily anytime.


"Patrick! Give it to me! If you break it. I'll hate you!" Her words made his face darken with displeasure.


He grabbed her wrist, pulling it to his chest. "Do you really hate me?"

Emily's stubbornness flared, refusing to apologize. Her heart was a mix of anger and hurt. Patrick handed her the bracelet, "Take care of it. You were always so meticulous at work, but with your own stuff. you're careless. Is this some kind of strategy? Or do you think if you leave it out. I'll bring it to you?"


"You're talking nonsense!" Emily snapped, quickly putting the bracelet away. She came back out in casual clothes. Patrick gave her a once-over."Why are you so guarded with me?"


Emily didn't answer, just glared at him. Thinking about how Patrick had returned the lost bracelet, she couldn't help but soften her tone. She stood by the bar, "There's beer, soda, and coffee in the fridge. What do you want?
"Coffee." Patrick said. turning to look at the sunlight streaming through the windows. A complex emotion washed over him. This was the first time they were in a house together without it leading to sex. It seemed like he had already forgiven her. Maybe time really could heal everything.
###Chapter 80 What Do You Take Me For?

Patrick was lost in thought, trying to figure out what he really felt for Emily. Was it just possessiveness, or something deeper? Watching her busy herself with making coffee, his confusion only grew. Emily,on the other hand, was just as puzzled. She had no idea what Patrick's sudden visit meant or where their relationship was heading.


When the coffee was ready, Emily handed Patrick a cup. He took a sip,letting the aroma fill his senses. The silence between them was thick and awkward. Finally, Emily broke it. "Why are you here?" Patrick looked at her, a bit lost, and said, "I don't know, I just felt like coming when I saw you." Emily scoffed, "Do you really think I believe you anymore?" Patrick sighed, "I know I messed up before, but..." He trailed off, struggling to find the right words.

Emily cut him off. "You don't need to say anything. It's over between us.I just want to move on with my life, without you in it." Patrick's heart sank.He hadn't expected her to be so firm. After a moment of silence, he said,"Alright, if that's what you want, I won't bother you anymore." He put down the coffee cup,stood up, and headed for the door.

Emily watched him leave, her emotions a tangled mess. She wasn't sure if she was making the right choice, but she knew she couldn't go back to the pain of the past. She had to think about her and her child's future.Patrick reached the door, paused, looked back at Emily, wanting to say something.but in the end, he just left.


Emily sat on the sofa, tears streaming down her face. She listened to his footsteps fade away and the elevator door close, knowing he was really gone. On impulse, she rushed to the door and opened it, only to bump right into Patrick.
He opened his arms, a cold smile on his face. "Can't bear to see me go?"

"No!" Emily pushed him away, trying to retreat back inside.

But Patrick gently held her, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still.His embrace was warm and strong. making Emily's heart race. She wanted to pull away, but her body wouldn't cooperate.


Patrick looked down at her trembling lips, his desire burning. He leaned in slowly, and Emily's eyes widened. She wanted to turn away, but he held her tight. His breath was hot and commanding, making her feel dizzy.


When his lips touched hers, it was like a jolt of electricity. Her mind went blank, and she forgot everything. Patrick's kiss was gentle yet intense.like he was savoring the most delicious thing in the world.


Emily's legs felt weak, her hands hanging uselessly at her sides.Patrick's kiss grew more passionate, his tongue gently parting her lips and exploring her mouth. She was overwhelmed by his presence,her breath quickening.


Patrick held Emily close, like he wanted to fuse their bodies. His kiss was full of raw desire, making Emily's body heat up against her will. She wanted to push him away, but her hands felt weak. Her mind was a mess.knowing this shouldn't be happening, yet unable to resist his pull.


Patrick's hand gently caressed her back, feeling her warmth. His kisses trailed from her lips to her cheeks, then to her earlobes. When he sucked on her earlobes, her body trembled, and a soft moan escaped her lips.


Patrick's desire intensified when he heard Emily's moans. His hand slid down her back, resting on her butt, giving it a gentle squeeze. Emily's body tensed up, her eyes wide with shyness and panic.
"Don't be scared, baby," Patrick whispered in her ear, his voice dripping with tenderness and temptation. Emily felt flustered, not knowing how to respond to his gentleness. She wanted to break free. but her body leaned into him instead.


Patrick's lips found hers again, the kiss growing more intense. Emily was breathless, her hands clutching his clothes for support. His body pressed tightly against hers, his erection pressing against her abdomen.


Feeling his desire, Emily's face turned bright red. She wanted to push him away, but he held her too tightly. His hand slipped under her clothes,caressing her skin. Her body trembled with a mix of fear and shyness.


"Patrick, please stop," Emily's voice trembled, a hint of pleading in it.Patrick heard her, feeling a pang of guilt, but his desire was too strong.His hand continued to explore her body, feeling her softness and warmth.

Tears streamed down Emily's face. She wanted to resist, but his kisses and touches made her heart race. She felt trapped, unable to escape his control.


Just when she felt hopeless, Patrick suddenly stopped. He looked at her tear-stained face, guilt washing over him. He gently kissed her tears away,saying, "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have been so impulsive."


Emily didn't say anything, just looked at him silently. It was the first time he had ever apologized to her. Her heart was filled with conflict; she didn't know what kind of feelings she had for Patrick. Patrick gently held her and asked, "Emily, what should I do?"


Emily was shocked, unable to believe her ears. She looked at him,her eyes full of confusion and surprise. Patrick repeated, "After you left, I realized I can't be without you. I know I treated you badly before, can you forgive me?"
Emily was touched, falling into silence. She leaned into his embrace.feeling his warmth and heartbeat. This moment with Patrick was something she had longed for.


"Emily, can you come back? Name your conditions: a house, a car. or a check?" Patrick turned her shoulders, looking into her eyes seriously.


Emily's emotions shifted from touched to shocked to angry as she pushed him away and coldly questioned, "Mr. Rivera, what am I to you? A secretary? A sexual partner? Or a prostitute you pay for sex?"


Hearing her words, Patrick realized he had messed up. He reached out to grab her, but she pushed him away.
###Chapter 81 Patrick Stayed Overnight

Patrick was losing his cool, barely holding back his anger. "What do you want、 Emily? I've already swallowed my pride to make you happy.What more do you need?"

Emily's eyes welled up with tears. She reached out, her fingers catching the drops. Her voice trembled, "Mr. Rivera, if you really don't know.please don't ask. I can't keep torturing myself like this."


Patrick's heart softened when he saw her tears. He gently pulled her into a hug,resting his chin on her head. "Alright, I won't bring it upagain.Just tell me what you want, Emily. I can't read your mind. Please, stop crying."

Emily stayed silent, torn inside. She didn't know if she could trust Patrick's words or if they could ever go back to how things were. Sensing her hesitation, Patrick kissed her forehead softly. "Emily, please don't cry."

Her heart was in turmoil, and she was unsure of what to do. She wanted to believe him, but was scared of getting hurt again. Her mind was a whirlwind of confusion about the future.


Patrick held her tighter. "If you want to stay at Hughes Group, that's fine.But no more solo lunches with Marlon. If you want to chase your dream in jewelry design, go for it. I'll support you. And if working outside gets too tough, come back to me. There's always a place for you here." Emily felt a flicker of warmth, unsure if she should trust his words, but something inside her wavered.


They clung to each other at the doorway, as if the world had shrunk to just the two of them. Their hearts were a mix of desire and conflict,uncertain about the future but finding comfort in each other's embrace.
Watching Patrick sleep. Emily hesitated with her hand on the curtain.She didn't pull it open, just stared at his handsome face. lost in thought.Normally, she'd open the curtains first thing, letting the sunlight flood the room. She loved waking up to the morning sun, hearing the birds and insects from Crystal Heights Park. It made all her struggles feel worth it.living at Crystal Heights Residences.


Maybe that was why everyone in Aetheria dreams of owning a home. It was not about the size, but the sense of belonging. Just like Patrick. he was so outstanding that everyone looked up to him. But so what? Emily felt that he couldn't provide her with a sense of security and belonging.She had been his secretary for three years. enduring sarcasm and neglect. Didn t Patrick know? Of course, he did, but he would only say a few words to Emily when he was in a good mood. However, if Shirley bullied her,he would choose to remain silent, and might even side with Shirley.Thinking about it, Emily wanted to slap the sleeping Patrick awake. But then,she hesitated.


This was the first time Patrick had stayed the night. Usually, after their intimate moments, no matter how late it was, he'd always leave Maple Peak Apartments and head back to Rivera Manor. At first, Emily thought he was just a mama's boy, not wanting to leave Jennifer alone in that big empty mansion. But then Shirley mentioned that Patrick couldn't bear to leave her alone in Rivera Manor, worried that she might be scared, so he went back every night to keep her company. More than once, when Emily called,she was greeted by the sound of Patrick and Shirley's voices,which only made things worse. Eventually, she stopped insisting he stay after their moments together.


Emily gently placed her hand on her belly and cracked the window open.The morning breeze brushed her face, bringing in a fresh breath of air.Living on a higher floor gave her a stunning view of Crystal Heights Park,
which looked like a beautiful painting with its lush trees and shimmering lake. Since getting pregnant, she hadn't visited Gordon.She wondered how he was doing. The doctor had said he was almost recovered last time she checked. so he should be back this week. Having a child had softened Emily's heart, making her realize that having family around was the greatest happiness.


She glanced back at Patrick.the morning sun casting a dazzling light on his face, making him look like a perfect sculpture crafted by the gods. yet so unattainable. The sunlight highlighted his deep features.making him even more handsome and charming. Emily wondered. 'Were Patrick's words last night out of ignorance, or did he really think I wasn't worthy of his love?' Her hand gripped the curtain tightly.


Whether it was the intense sunlight or the gentle breeze,Patrick rubbed his eyes and saw Emily standing by the window. He naturally reached out his hand, beckoning her over. "Come here," he said in a lazy, gentle tone that was hard to resist. Emily sat on the edge of the bed as Patrick pulled her into his arms. "Why are you up so early? Aren't you feeling well? Why not sleep a little more?" His embrace was warm and reassuring, making Emily feel at peace. Hiding her emotions. Emily murmured, "I couldn't sleep."


Patrick rested his chin on her head, rubbing it gently. "Are you going to work at Hughes Group today?" Emily nodded slightly. Patrick added, "Don't get too close to Marlon." His tone unconsciously slipped back into the condescending manner he had as her boss. Emily pursed her lips, not replying. She knew Patrick was possessive, but she had her own work and life, and she wasn't about to let him control her all the time.


Thinking he had matters to attend to at Rivera Group, Patrick got dressed,had breakfast, kissed Emily's cheek, and swiftly left Crystal Heights Residences. His movements were decisive, without any hesitation. Emily
looked at the messy living room, her expressionless face. As she turned her head. she saw Patrick's watch still on the coffee table. She picked it up.looking at the exquisite dial. feeling a surge of complex emotions. The watch was valuable, representing Patrick's status and position. She wondered why he had left it behind-was it unintentional. or was there another reason?
###Chapter 82 Their Relationship Started to Ease


"Did Patrick not come home last night?" Jennifer asked, sitting at the dining table with a morning newspaper spread out in front of her.She pushed her glasses up. Efren nodded and replied. "Mr. Rivera didn't come back last night. William wasn't with him all day. Mr. Rivera said he had something to do and left early in the morning."


Jennifer glanced up and saw Elbert pushing his motorcycle in. She said."Get Elbert to go back to his own place. Have Shirley move back to Villa No.
3. Keep her away from Patrick for now. Have you gathered all the info on those young heirs?" Her tone was firm, showing she had already made up her mind.


"Yes, Madam," Efren said, placing a tablet in front of her. Jennifer swiped through the photos, nodding as she reviewed each young man. "They all seem suitable. Make the arrangements," she said, planning Shirley's future in her mind.


Through the large floor-to-ceiling window, Efren saw Shirley standing at the entrance of the estate with her luggage, hesitating. "What if Shirley doesn't want to go on these blind dates?" he asked.


Jennifer's hand paused for a moment. Following Efren's gaze, she looked out and said, "It's not up to her. Tell her if she refuses, I won't be responsible for her anymore."


Shirley, standing outside Rivera Manor, clutched her luggage and vowed not to return to Oakwood Homestead. Although it was large and fully furnished, it felt like a haunted house without any sign of life. Since it was very far from the city center, she spent hundreds of dollars ontaxi fares
each month commuting to work. More importantly,she couldn't see Patrick there, which was unbearable. With this in mind. she put on a gentle smile, walked into the hall, and greeted Jennifer respectfully. "Mrs.Rivera." Her smile was sweet and gentle. restoring her past charm.


Seeing Shirley. Jennifer felt a softness in her heart. She had watched Shirley grow up. After Elbert's accident. Shirley's mother learned that Elbert's intelligence had regressed to that of an 8-year-old with no hope of recovery. That night, she packed her bags and left quietly. never to be heard from again. Shirley was not even a year old then.and Jennifer had raised her like her own child. providing the best education and care.


When Shirley wanted to study animation design abroad but didn't have the grades. Jennifer paid a large sum for her tuition and fulfilled her wish.After graduation, she arranged for Shirley to work at the Rivera Group.Shirley had grown up under Jennifer's protection for 20 years. If Shirley hadn't had inappropriate thoughts. Jennifer wouldn't have had the heart to send her back to Oakwood Homestead and neglect her for so long.


"Shirley, come here. What do you think of these guys? They're all potential suitors I've picked out for you. You've grown up, and it's my fault for not noticing you're at the age to get married. I've always seen you as a child.But don't worry, I'll take your marriage seriously. No matter which wealthy young man you choose, I'll make sure you have a grand wedding.presenting you as the adopted daughter of the Rivera family. What do you think?" Jennifer's friendly words made Shirley secretly fume.


She realized she was brought back to the Rivera Group for a marriage alliance. In the eyes of a businesswoman, there was only cold calculation.Did she really expect Jennifer to treat her like a real daughter after all these years? Feeling resentful, Shirley still managed a soft smile and said."I'll follow your arrangements. Don't worry, I won't cause trouble for you
and Patrick this time." Jennifer patted Shirley's hand and said. "Good girl."

So,on an ordinary morning at the Rivera Manor, it was decided that Shirley would go on blind dates. Although she was unhappy, she didn't dare defy Jennifer. She knew her place and understood that her fate wasn't entirely in her own hands. She could only accept everything silently and wait for her chance.


When Patrick got to the office, he realized he had forgotten his watch. He called Emily and asked, "Where are you?" His voice was low and magnetic.making people want to obey him. Emily had just handed over the design drawings to the 3D modeling department and was rushing to Marlon's office.


When she got Patrick's call, she replied, "I'm on my way to your office."Then she paused, realizing her mistake, and quickly added, "I mean, I'm going to report to Mr. Hughes about this week's work schedule. Do you need anything?"


Patrick coughed, pretending not to notice her slip-up. After a moment,he said, "I left my watch at your place."


Emily's phone volume was loud, and she was standing at Marlon's office door, surrounded by his secretaries. They looked up at her and then fell silent.


Emily hurried to the water cooler and said, "I'll call a courier service." Her voice was nervous and uneasy. Patrick chuckled and said, "My watch is worth $600,000. Are you sure you want to call a courier service?" His tone was teasing and confident.

Hearing the value of the watch, Emily bit her lip and, as if making a big sacrifice, said. "Why don't you come over tonight to pick it up?" Her voice
was hesitant and expectant.

Patrick's lips curled up, and he leaned back in his chair. crossing his long legs and putting them on the table. "Since you invited me. I'll take you up on that." he said, his tone full of pride and pleasure.


Hearing people whispering around her. Emily felt the gossip behind her back. She nodded quickly. realizing Patrick couldn't see her, and whispered."Okay. come over to pick it up. I'm at work, I have to go." She quickly hung up. Her cheeks were flushed with embarrassment and unease.


Seeing Emily hang up on him in a hurry for the first time. Patrick raised an eyebrow, thinking. 'Emily is getting too bold now. She no longer regards me highly.' He sneered. Emily was his woman. and he never let go of what he wanted. He was full of confidence and dominance. believing he could control everything.
###Chapter 83 Why is Mr. Rivera so Clingy?

At Crystal Heights Residences. Emily absentmindedly set the tomato soup on the dining table. As she stared at the steaming bowl. her mind was a whirlwind of emotions. Watching Patrick dig into his dinner like he belonged there, she thought. 'Am I losing it again? Why did I let him come over for dinner? Should I kick him out after we eat?' She was torn.not sure how to deal with Patrick.


Noticing Emily just standing there. Patrick grabbed her hand.pulled her to a chair, and said. "Come on, eat up. Don't you have some drawing to do after dinner? Don't waste time. After we eat. I'll take you to the park for a walk. Fresh air and exercise are good for you." His voice had a touch of care and tenderness.


Emily looked at Patrick, feeling a strange sense of gratitude. She knew he was looking out for her, but she had her own worries.


As Patrick talked about their plans for after dinner, Emily realized they seemed like an old married couple, coming home from work,cooking dinner, and then going for a walk. It was so ordinary, the kind of life most couples have. She had dreamed of this scene so many times, and now it was happening again. even after she had decided to leave Patrick.


Seeing Emily lost in thought, not even noticing the tomato soup on her lips, Patrick picked up a napkin and reached out to wipe it off.


Emily stared at him blankly; it was as if she saw a different Patrick, a gentle and caring Patrick who was not bossy. She wished time could stop right there, letting her forget all the past unhappiness. She also hoped Patrick would really stay by her side, being a gentle and caring partner.

As night fell, Patrick and Emily strolled through Crystal Heights
Residences like an old married couple, then took a leisurely walk through Crystal Heights Park before heading back to the apartment.


Emily checked her watch; it was already 8:30 PM. "Aren't you going back tonight?" she asked, her voice a mix of anticipation and anxiety.


Patrick opened the closet. pulled out some men's clothes, and said. "What's with all this talk about never seeing each other again? You forgot your own stuff but remembered to bring mine?"


Patrick's teasing tone made Emily blush instantly. She rushed forward in a few steps and quickly grabbed the blue silk pajamas from him, saying. "No.these are for my brother!" Her voice was panicked and shy.


Patrick raised an eyebrow and said. "I remember your brother is only 10years old, right? Does he wear clothes in an adult size?" His tone was teasing and confused.


Hearing Patrick's teasing, Emily blushed even more, stuttering,"It's none of your business."


Seeing Emily's embarrassed expression, Patrick felt a sense of accomplishment. He pulled her close, leaned down, and whispered in her ear,"After you left, I ran out of my shower gel. William bought me a bunch of different kinds, but none of them are like yours. It's my favorite scent. Give me the clothes, I'm going to take a shower." His voice was soft and gentle, like a feather brushing against Emily's ear, with a hint of hoarseness and desire.


Emily's heart softened, and Patrick snatched the pajamas from behind her and headed into the bathroom.


Seeing Patrick acting all shameless, Emily stomped her foot, turned back to
the living room, crossed her arms. and pouted in anger. 'When did he become like this? He used to be the aloof CEO. If he were still that proud and arrogant Patrick, she could have kicked him out with just a few words.But now, he was shameless! No matter how harshly she spoke, it felt like she was indirectly trying to keep him around.


Emily thought and worried that Patrick had gotten too comfortable living at Crystal Heights Residences. If something unexpected happened.or if he took advantage of her inattentiveness to have sex with her and it harmed the baby, it would be a disaster. She still didn't dare to tell Patrick about the pregnancy. As she thought about this. a worried expression appeared on Emily's face.


Emily sat on the sofa in the living room, her heart a mess of conflicting emotions.


The sound of water from the bathroom made Emily's heart beat faster. She thought of Patrick's sexy body and gentle gaze, a strange desire welling up inside her. She knew she shouldn't have such thoughts, but she couldn't control her emotions.


She remembered the doctor's advice: the first three months were very dangerous for the baby, especially after her recent scare. She had barely managed to save the baby, so she shouldn't have sex, at least not for another five or six months.


Thinking of this, Emily quickly gave herself a mental pep talk. She must hold on. She absolutely had to resist Patrick's seductive charm.


Patrick finished showering and stood at the bedroom door with his wet hair. water droplets dripping down, shimmering faintly in the light. He looked at Emily, seeing her furrowed brow and anxious expression, a hint of curiosity rising in his heart. He naturally walked over, put his arm
around Emily's shoulder, and asked softly, "What's bothering you? Tell me so I can make fun of you."


Feeling Patrick's warm breath on her, Emily felt restless. She reached out and pushed Patrick's chest, saying, "Shut up. Mr. Rivera, with the Rivera Manor being so big, why do you have to squeeze into my tiny house? Don't you feel cramped?"


When Emily said this, her eyes slightly narrowed. The proud Patrick, who usually despised being provoked with questions, was now in front of her.She really wanted to know if, at that moment, he had lowered his standards when it came to her.
###Chapter 84 Do You Need My Help?

Patrick tilted his head, running his fingers through his still-wet hair,sending droplets flying in a little arc. He glanced at Emily's pouty face and found it kind of adorable. "Dry my hair," he ordered, his voice carrying a hint of expectation.


When Emily didn'trespond, Patrick's face hardened. Growing impatient,she tossed a dry towel at his head. "Do it yourself, then clean up and get out. Don't think a few sweet words will make me take you in."


Patrick's irritation flared up when Emily told him to leave again. 'Why's she always so stubborn?' he thought, roughly drying his hair as if taking out his frustration on the towel. He shot her a look, then stormed into the master bedroom. slamming the door behind him.


The loud bang of the door startled Emily. She glared at the closed door,her anger boiling over. "Patrick, you jerk! That's my room! What are you doing in there? Get out! I haven't even showered yet. How am I supposed to shower with you in there?"


Patrick swung the door open again, his eyes filled with impatience and a mocking glint. He grabbed Emily, trying to undress her. Shocked, she crossed her arms over her chest. "What are you doing? If you don't stop. I'Il call the police."


Patrick, acting like a rogue, pushed her onto the bed and taunted her,"Scream all you want, no one's coming to save you."Lu Wen found the awkward Emily to be quite interesting. She was nothing like the way she used to be, just lounging around like a couch potato.


As Emily felt Patrick's intent gaze upon her, she instinctively pushed against his solid chest, her legs straining against him. Perhaps she was just
being foolish. When he kept his distance, she ached for him, but now that he was trying to claim her, every fiber of her being resisted.


Yet, it was evident that she didn't truly understand men. Patrick noticed her reluctance, and a surge of desire ignited within him. It felt as if she was caught in a dance of rejection and invitation. With a swift motion,he seized her wrist, pinning both of her hands above her head, while his other hand ventured to caress the softness of her breast.


Emily's resistance grew more frantic, her heart sinking into despair and helplessness. Patrick spread her legs with his own, her thin nightgown outlining her genitals. With her legs restrained, she could only wiggle her hips and waist, feeling utterly helpless.

Anticipating that Emily might speak up. Patrick quickly kissed her, his heart pounding with longing and urgency. He wanted to silence her, to stop her from refusing him. His lips moved skillfully over hers, his tongue exploring her mouth, drawing out her sweet tongue and sucking deeply.


Every move Emily made was countered and dominated by Patrick. She felt humiliated and helpless, unsure how to escape his grasp. His hand slid from her chest to her abdomen, stopping at her thighs. Under his touch,her thighs tingled with unwanted desire.


Just as Patrick was about to go further, he noticed tears streaming down Emily's face. He froze, a mix of emotions surging within him. He hadn't expected her resistance to be so strong. His erection pressed against her thigh,but he hesitated.


Emily gritted her teeth, her heart filled with fear and despair. She licked her bitten lips, her tongue brushing the corner of her mouth, and Patrick's desire nearly erupted. But seeing her tears, he held back.
In a hoarse voice, he asked, "You really don't want to do this?" Confusion and disappointment filled his heart; he didn't understand why she was resisting. Emily's tears kept flowing, and she let out a soft sob. She thought about how if Patrick acted as usual, the baby wouldn't be safe. His intensity always left her exhausted, sometimes even causing her to faint before he was done. Now that she was pregnant. she couldn't endure his roughness and dominance. Her tears flowed uncontrollably at the thought of this.


When he saw her cry. Patrick's overwhelming desire began to fade. He reached out, gently brushing his fingertips across her cheek. His heart ached with helplessness as he faced the weeping Emily, unsure of what to do. "If you don't want to, I won't do it," he said softly.


Emily whispered. "I'm sorry. I'm sick. The doctor said I'm not allowed to have sex right now." Her heart was filled with guilt and helplessness; she was unsure how to explain her situation to Patrick. Hearing her words,Patrick turned to the side of the bed, sighing deeply, trying to calm himself down. His heart was filled with doubt and worry as he wondered what illness she had.


With her head lowered, Emily lay on Patrick's chest and softly said, "Let me help you." Patrick thought, 'Even if it's not the full act, it's better than nothing.' With that in mind, he let Emily proceed. His heart was a mix of impulsive desire and concern for her.


Patrick's absence from the Rivera Manor for two consecutive days finally made Jennifer feel that something was wrong. In the garden, sunlight shone on the vibrant flowers, but it couldn't dispel Jennifer's worries.Sitting in a garden chair, furrowing her brow, she asked Efren, who was standing behind her, "Did you arrange the things I asked you to last time?"
###Chapter 85 Mr. Rivera's Matchmaking Candi date

Efren nodded and said, "The young lady has already been taken to The Rivera Group by William today. Mr. Rivera will see her as soon as he gets here." His tone was respectful and cautious.


"Good. Call Patrick later and tell him it'smy decision. Make sure you take good care of that girl. She's from a wealthy family, so don't neglect her."Jennifer's eyes had a hint of authority and expectation. Efren nodded again,
"Don't worry, Madam. Mr. Rivera knows what to do."

"He better!" Jennifer snapped. She couldn't understand why Patrick had to choose Emily. Jennifer thought, With so many well-off women around,why does Patrick have to choose Emily?

A daughter-in-law like Emily wouldn't represent the Rivera family well.If Emily married Patrick, the Rivera family would be a laughingstock among the noble families. Jennifer didn't want Emily to be a weakness for Patrick or a flaw in the family. She was filled with helplessness and concern. She really doubted if Patrick had let love cloud his judgment, as he knew it wasn't suitable, but still pushed forward!


Monday at the Rivera Group was like any other, filled with the tense atmosphere of early meetings. Sunlight streamed through the large French windows into the spacious conference room, but couldn't dispel the serious and busy vibe. Patrick, the CEO, despite his outstanding abilities, found it hard to smile easily with all the overwhelming work.


But today. William was surprised to see Patrick smiling during the meeting. It was rare to see Patrick, usually all business, acting like a boy in love,which was quite unsettling. William wondered what could make
Patrick act so unusually. Could it really be because of the legendary Patricia?


William was a meticulous worker, always completing tasks diligently.But today, Patrick's mood, like a gentle breeze, unknowingly affected him. As he organized meeting materials, he occasionally stole glances at Patrick,filled with curiosity.


By the time Patrick finished all the meetings, time had quietly passed. In Patrick's office, Patricia Evans was elegantly seated, already on her fourth cup of coffee. She was the blind date that Jennifer arranged for Patrick; she was the daughter of the Evans family.


The sunlight bathed her as if draping her in a golden veil. With hertall figure.standing over 5 feet 7 inches, she appeared even more graceful in the play of light and shadow. Her face was as beautiful as the moon, her eyes affectionate. exuding the typical aura of an heiress from a wealthy family.


As Patrick pushed open the door, he was greeted by this scene. Patricia had her hands folded in front of her abdomen, looking gently at Patrick,and softly said. "Patrick, do you remember me? We've met before, I'm Patricia."


Patrick looked at the girl in front of him, indeed feeling very familiar,but the scent on her was not to his liking. Patrick nodded slightly and said,"Efren already told me this morning. My mother arranged for you to come to the Rivera Group for a period of exchange and learning. Since your master's degree is in economics management, how about temporarily serving as the Director of Market Economic Analysis at the Rivera Group?"


Patricia readily nodded, saying, "Sure, no problem, Patrick. This is exactly the kind of work I excel at. You can rest assured, I will do my best."
Patricia knew very well that, as the arranged blind date for her family and the Rivera Group, she couldn't afford to be the slightest bit artificial. She understood that family alliances were not just about the emotions between her and Patrick, but also about whether both parties had the ability to take on the responsibilities expected of family members.


She and Patrick, as the sole heirs of the Evans Group and the Rivera Group,respectively, were like the pillars of the next generation of the family,needing to demonstrate strong capabilities to show their family's honor.


Meanwhile, in the lobby of the Rivera Group, Shirley strutted in, rocking a short skirt that showed off her figure. Her high heels clicked on the smooth floor. practically announcing her arrival. Her perfectly styled long hair swayed with each step, and her eyes were filled with curiosity and anticipation. But when she noticed the whispers around the company.unease started to creep in.


She approached a few friends she was close with and asked, "What's the buzz around here? Spill it. I have no clue what's going on." Her friends went silent when they saw her. They all knew that in Shirley's eyes,Patrick was off-limits, and she wouldn't tolerate any gossip about him.Especially when Emily was around. Shirley would lash out at anyone who got too close to Patrick.


Seeing her friends' silence. Shirley grew more puzzled. She pulled out several new shades of high-end lipstick from her bag and handed them out. saying, "We're all good friends. right? So when I have something nice.I think of you all. If you have any news, tell me. If I become the mistress of the Rivera Group one day. I won't forget you. Promotions and raises will be a piece of cake."

Her friends' eyes lit up at Shirley's words. Shirley lived in the Rivera
Manor, even though she didn't have the Rivera name. If Patrick and Jennifer didn't have any interest in her, why would they let her stay with the Rivera family for 20 years? Maybe she was being groomed as Patrick's wife! Plus, Shirley didn't have a high education or strong abilities, yet she was Patrick's executive assistant. There had to be a connection.


And then there was the fact that a capable woman like Emily had been driven out of the Rivera Group by Shirley, showing her high status in Patrick and Jennifer's hearts.


Thirdly, they didn't know much about Patricia. If Patricia became the mistress of the Rivera Group, it wouldn't concern them.


But if Shirley really became Patrick's wife, her words and promises might actually come true.


With these thoughts, the friends pulled Shirley into the pantry. The pantry was filled with the faint aroma of coffee, sunlight streaming through the windows onto the table. creating patches of light.


The girls sat around, whispering. "Shirley, a new Market Department Director named Patricia joined our company today."


Upon hearing the name Patricia, Shirley furrowed her brows. She knew Patricia, the only daughter of the Evans Group. Patrick had taken her to the Evans family banquet before, so she had even had a few meals with Patricia.


"Why is she working here? The Evans Group is also a big company,"Shirley asked curiously.


A short, slightly full-figured girl who seemed to know a lot of insider info walked over and whispered. "I saw it with my own eyes. This morning,
Patricia came to the company in Efren's car. Efren personally escorted her to Mr. Rivera's office. Think about it, Patricia is the only daughter of the Evans Group, and Efren is Jennifer's special assistant. He personally escorted her to Patrick's office, so I guess Patricia's visit this time is not just an ordinary work visit," the full-figured girl said and deliberately paused.


"If she isn't just here for work, then what is she here for? Quick, tell us,"urged a slender girl with her hair in a bun.

The full-figured girl said. "I think Patricia is going to marry Mr. Rivera!"
###Chapter 86 Patricia's Contempt

Upon hearing that. Shirley's coffee cup slipped from her hand and shattered on the floor. Coffee splashed all over the girls' shoes. stockings.and uniforms.


The full-figured girl shrieked. "Shirley. what the heck? I just bought these shoes today!" Seeing the mess. Shirley bit her lip in frustration and snapped. "What's the big deal? How much? I'll pay you back!" She was fuming inside. unable to handle the thought of Patrick having another potential marriage partner. After all the years she had spent by his side.she felt he should be hers. Her face twisted with anger, and she felt like she was about to explode.


Suddenly. Shirley's demeanor changed; she became cold and intimidating.Everyone realized her previous kindness was just a facade. The girls stopped talking, aware that Shirley was still the executive secretary and not someone to mess with. The full-figured girl forced a smile and said, "No worries. I'll just clean up in the bathroom. A little coffee won't hurt." The other two girls quickly chimed in, "Yeah, it's no big deal. We wvere just scared." Seeing Shirley's rage. they hurriedly left the pantry.


Shirley grabbed a wet tissue and roughly wiped the coffee off her stockings,her movements harsh and angry. She then fixed her hair and adjusted her already short suit skirt. Looking at herself in the mirror,she felt a wave of anxiety. She couldn't understand why Patricia had suddenly appeared to threaten her position by Patrick's side.


With a sway in her hips. Shirley pushed open the door to Patrick's office.As she entered, her fierce expression melted into a sweet, friendly smile.

"Patricia! Long time no see, you look as stunning as ever," Shirley said
with a slight smile.

Patricia, who had just received Patrick's appointment letter and was about to leave his office, saw Shirley walk in. She couldn't stand people like Shirley,who relied on the wealthy for power and status.


In Patricia's eyes, Shirley's behavior was far from respectable. Her family would conduct thorough background checks before any marriage. They'd look into how many women had been around Patrick, who he had dated.whether he had made anyone pregnant or had abortions, or where he liked to go at night. For a prestigious family like theEvans Group,they could investigate thoroughly. So Patricia saw Shirley's methods as beneath her.


Compared to Shirley. Patricia respected someone like Emily more, who had exceptional work abilities and could completey separate emotions from work. Patricia believed a woman's emotions were only a small part of her life. Her career dreams. contributions to her family and society,and how to make her life meaningful were her primary goals. Things like marriage and having children were optional. So women like Shirley,who devoted themselves entirely to men and were jealous, were not worthy of Patricia's friendship.


Patricia, who was half a head taller than Shirley, looked down at her and said, "Shirley, that skirt is way too short. It's already above the midpoint of your thighs. You might want to lengthen it a bit for easier movement around the office." Shirley felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her as Patricia bluntly pointed out the length of her skirt. She glanced at Patrick,hoping for some support, but he remained silent. Putting on a hurt expression, she said. "Maybe I grew taller. It used to reach my knees."

Patricia chuckled and crossed her arms. "I didn't know you could still
grow at 22. That's quite a talent." With that, she ignored Shirley and walked out. Patricia didn't need to suck up to anyone. Working at the Rivera Group was just a way to spend more time with Patrick. She could always go back to the Evans Group and take over as heir or even CEO.People like Shirley didn't even have the qualifications to step into the Evans Group.


Feeling humiliated in front of Patrick, Shirley walked up to him with a wounded look and said. "Patrick, Patricia probably didn't mean it. I didn't say anything to upset her. Why did she get so mad? She doesn't seem like someone with a bad temper. You shouldn't be angry with her."


Patrick sighed and said. "Patricia's right. Next time, make your skirt a bit longer to avoid attracting unwanted attention from your colleagues."Shirley's face lit up when she heard Patrick's words. "Patrick, I knew you cared about me the most."


At that moment. Patrick was buried in paperwork, his desk cluttered with documents and reports. His brow was furrowed with the stress of Monday's meetings, briefings, and shareholder discussions. He wished he could clone himself to get everything done.


Seeing Shirley still standing there, Patrick looked up, annoyed. "Don't you have anything to do this morning? If not, check these data, distribute the files I signed, and bring me a cup of coffee." His instructions hit Shirley like a slap. She was stunned for a moment and asked, "Patrick, what did you just say? Can you repeat that?" Patrick rolled his eyes, lit a cigarette,and waved her off. "Get out."


Shirley left Patrick's office. In the past, Patrick had always been gentle with her; it was the first time he acted like this today! It must be that Patricia spoke ill of her in front of him! Moreover, she couldn't understand why
Patrick was always so busy. Shouldn't he be spending his days taking her out on adventures, enjoying shopping together, traveling, and capturing memories?


What was the point of being a CEO if he worked so hard? If life was just about working and making money, then being a boss was no different from being an employee. Shirley was confused. She took out a voice recorder and tossed it on another secretary's desk, saying, "Mr. Rivera just instructed you to take care of these things."


"Why a voice recorder?" asked Cecilia Thorne, a fresh college graduate who had just started working as a secretary.


She wasn't really qualified for the job, but Emily had noticed her meticulous work and sharp numerical skills, so she kept her on. After Emily left, Cecilia naturally became one of Shirley's targets.


Shirley rolled her eyes and said, "I'm afraid your tiny brain won't remember, so I recorded it for you. Either do it or get out." With that,Shirley adjusted her super short skirt and headed to the pantry to kill some time.
###Chapter 87 Madam Asks You to Go Home fa Dinner

When Patrick wrapped up his work, he looked up and saw Patricia and Efren sitting on the sofa with a lunchbox, as if they had been waiting there forever.


"Mr. Rivera, this is lunch Madam prepared for you and Miss Evans. She said you've been under a lot of stress lately. plus you were injured a while back, so she made you some soup. This fish soup is for Miss Evans.hoping she'll takebetter care of her health." Efren said. He'd been Jennifer s assistant for thirty years. When he retired, instead of moving on to another big company, he chose to come back to the Rivera Manor as a butler. Patrick respected him a lot for that and always treated him like family.


"Thanks, Efren." Patrick rubbed his brow, sat on the sofa, opened the lunch box himself, and handed a fork to Efren, saying, "Efren, join me. It's late, and I'm sure you haven't had lunch either."


Efren shook his head. "No, Mr. Rivera. Madam is waiting for me to return.I'll head back now; there's food in thecar. You and Miss Evans enjoy your meal. If there's anything you like, let me know tonight, and I'll have Elbert bring it to you tomorrow."


"Will do." Patrick was about to talk about the evening plans when Efren reminded him, "Mr. Rivera, don't forget to bring Miss Evans home for dinner tonight. Madam is cooking for you."


"Thanks, Efren, we'll be there on time." Patricia noticed how much Patrick respected Efren and addressed him warmly,too.
Efren's eyes softened. He thought. 'Who wouIdn't like Miss Evans? She's beautiful, kind, and polite. Emily wasn't bad either, but Madam didn't like her. and her family background was a bit lacking.

Efren sighed silently to himself. then said goodbye to the two and quickly left The Rivera Group.


Shirley had just planned to call Patrick to go to the company cafeteria for lunch when she saw Efren leaving.


Shirley thought bitterly, 'What's Efren doing here? Did Jennifer come too?Is it because of Patricia?'


"Patrick! I'm here to take you to the cafeteria for lunch!" As Shirley pushed the door open, she saw Patrick having a meal with Patricia. She immediately said. annoyed. "Don't we always have lunch together? Why didn't you call me today? Is this the food Efren brought? I'm hungry too."


Patrick was caught off guard by Shirley's words. Patricia pursed her lips,glanced at the dishes on the table, and said slowly, "I'm sorry, Miss Wright.I guess Efren didn't prepare your portion today. We're almost done with our meal. If you don't mind,you can join us and have some."


Shirley glanced down. Sure enough, whether the food was just that delicious or they both had big appetites, the lunch box was almost empty.If she joined them now, she'd feel like she was intruding.


Her face darkened, humiliation bubbling up inside her. She'd lived at the Rivera Manor for so long and had never been treated like this. She bit her lip,trying hard to keep her emotions in check.


The sunlight streamed into the dining room, but it couldn't warm Shirley's cold heart. She looked at Patrick and Patricia, filled with jealousy and
anger. She felt excluded. like she was suddenly the third wheel. Shirley clenched her fists. nails digging into her palms. but she didn't feel any pain. Her mind raced with thoughts of how to win Patrick back and get rid of Patricia.


Patrick saw Shirley's expression and felt a bit torn. He knew how she felt about him. but he also knew he couldn't reciprocate. He sighed and said."Shirley, don't be upset. Should I have the chefs make another portion for you?"


Hearing Patrick's words, Shirley felt a bit better. But she still stubbornly shook her head and said. "No. Patrick. I'm not hungry." She turned to leave, but Patricia stopped her.

With a faint smile. Patricia said. "Miss Wright. why are you so upset? I was just stating the facts. If you're really hungry, just have the chefs make another portion. It's just a matter of waiting a bit longer, no need to be so dramatic,right?"


There was a hint of sarcasm in Patricia's tone. Shirley's anger flared up again. She turned around, glared at Patricia, and said. "What gives you the right to talk to me like that? You're just an outsider working at the Rivera Group."


Patricia smiled slightly and said, "I'm an outsider? What about you? Do you think you're so important in Patrick's heart? You're just a parasite living off the Rivera family." Shirley trembled with anger, wanting to retort but finding herself at a loss for words. She knew she appeared small and powerless in front of Patricia. She glared fiercely at Patricia, then turned and ran out of the room.


Patrick watched Shirley's retreating figure, feeling somewhat helpless.He knew her temper and her feelings for him. But he couldn't give her hope
because his heart belonged to Emily. He looked at Patricia and said. "Why did you have to say that to Shirley? She's not having an easy time either."


Patricia shrugged and said. "1 was just stating the facts. Shirley needs to know her place." Patrick shook his head and didn't say anything more.He knew the conflict between Patricia and Shirley was a class conflict. difficult to reconcile. and he didn't want to get involved.


In fact. what Patrick was really thinking about was how he could avoid going back to the Rivera Manor for dinner tonight. When he left this morning,Emily had asked if he wanted to come back for dinner.and he had clearly promised her. Patrick had stood Emily up countless times in the past. but after experiencing her resignation this time. he realized he could no longer bring himself to hurt her intentionally.


Patrick sat at his desk, his eyes somewhat unfocused. He thought of Emily's gentle face and expectant eyes, feeling a sense of guilt. He knew he should keep his promise and go back to have dinner with her. but he didn't know how to face those people at theRivera Manor. He tapped his fingers lightly on the table, a hint of frustration brewing inside him.
###Chapter 88 Patrick's First Love

Shirley stormed out, slamming the door behind her. She knew she couldn't compete with Patricia. 'If Patricia marries into the Rivera family,where does that leave me?' she thought. 'No way! Patricia can't marry Patrick!'Determined, she dialed Emily's number.


"Shirley? Seriously? You have the nerve to call me? Aren't you worried I'll report you for pushing me last time? You could get charged with assault!"Emily's voice was filled with anger as she recognized the number she had deleted.


Emily's anger flared up as she remembered what Shirley had done. She gripped her phone, tempted to hang up, but curiosity got the better of her.'What's Shirley up to now?' she wondered,feeling wary.


"Emily, why so angry? Remember, you're pregnant. Oh, right,you haven't told Patrick, have you? Worried he won't want the baby?" Shirley's voice dripped with smugness.


"Are you calling just to provoke me?" Emily asked, feeling uneasy. She didn't want to talk to Shirley, fearing it might affect her baby. She sat on the sofa,hand on her belly, feeling the sunlight but not its warmth.


"Emily, I won't tell Patrick about the baby. Come to the office, I need your help," Shirley's tone suddenly softened.

"What do you need?" Emily asked cautiously.


"It's about the work you handed over. There's a formula I can't find. Do you have a backup?" Shirley sounded anxious.

"I don't. I stored everything on a USB drive and gave it toyou and
William. Ask him," Emily replied, ready to hang up.

"Wait. Emily. Come to the office now. If you don't, I'll tell Patrick about the baby. Your call," Shirley threatened before hanging up.


Emily was furious and helpless. She knew Shirley was ruthless and might really tell Patrick. She didn't want Patrick to know about the pregnancy, at least not yet. She feared his reaction. Emily stood up, pacing the room, her mind in turmoil. The sunlight outside was fading, casting long shadows,mirroring her inner conflict.


Emily gently touched her slightly rounded belly, feeling the baby move inside her. She sat by the window, staring out at the sunny day, but the warmth outside couldn't ease her tangled emotions.


This baby was an unexpected result of her and Patrick's relationship,a secret she held close to her heart. She had been torn about whether to tell Patrick, fearing his reaction, his potential irresponsibility, and the possibility of him hurting her again because of the baby.


After a fierce internal battle, Emily decided to head to the Rivera Group.She slipped into a loose dress to hide her pregnancy. As she walked towards the building, a gentle breeze brushed her face, bringing a slight chill. Anxiety gnawed at her as she was unsure of what awaited her.

Stepping into the Rivera Group's lobby, a mix of familiarity and strangeness washed over her. The place was bustling as usual. She took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. As she rode the elevator to the familiar floor, her heart pounded faster with each passing second.


As she exited the elevator, ready to find Shirley, she spotted a familiar figure at the end of the corridor. It was Patricia. Tall and elegant,Patricia's presence momentarily stunned Emily. She noticed Patricia bore a striking
resemblance to Patrick's first love. Lucy Kim.

A wave of bitterness and unease surged through Emily. She remembered Patrick's deep affection for Lucy, and it stung. She stood there, staring at Patricia, memories of Patrick and Lucy flashing through her mind.


Conflicted and pained, Emily wondered about Patrick and Patricia's relationship and why Patricia was here. Her mind raced with questions and worries. She feared that Patrick might abandon her for Patricia.


Unable to resist. Emily approached Patricia, wanting a closer look at the woman who resembled Lucy so much. Patricia sensed someone staring at her, turned, and saw Emily. Her eyes filled with confusion and curiosity.


"Hi, can I help you?" Patricia asked softly.


Emily snapped back to reality, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Hi, I'm Emily.I used to work here at the Rivera Group."


Patricia nodded slightly. "I think I've seen you before. What brings you here?"


After a brief hesitation, Emily replied, "Shirley called me."


A look of disdain crossed Patricia's face. "Shirley? What does she want with you? She's not exactly a good person."


Emily was taken aback by Patricia's low opinion of Shirley. "I don't know why she called me. She just threatened to tell Patrick some things about me if I didn't come."


Patricia furrowed her brows. "She really stops at nothing. You don't have to be afraid of her. If you need help, I'm here for you."
Emily was touched by Patricia's unexpected offer. "Thank you. but I prefer to handle it myself."


Patricia smiled faintly. "Alright, but if you need help. feel free to find me."


Emily nodded and turned to leave, but her heart was still heavy with bitterness and unease. She worried about how Patrick would react to seeing Patricia and whether it would remind him of Lucy.
###Chapter 89 Patrick's First Love 2

Emily finally tracked down Shirley, who was grinning like a cat that got the cream.


"Well, look who decided to show up. Thought you might chicken out."Shirley taunted.


Emily shot her a frosty glare. "What do you want,Shirley?"


Shirley shoved a document at her. "I can't find this calculation formula anywhere. You must have a backup. Hand it over."


Emily, clearly irritated, glanced at the document. "I don't have a backup. I gave all the work to you and William. Figure it out yourself."

Shirley's expression turned sour. "You definitely have a backup. You just don't want to give it to me. Are you still thinking about crawling back to the Rivera Group?"


Emily's temper flared. "Shirley, you're out of line. I've left the Rivera Group for good. I really don't have a backup. Ask William."


Shirley bit her lip, seething. "Fine, don't give it to me. But remember, I can spill your secret to Patrick anytime."


A wave of fear washed over Emily. She knew Shirley wasn't bluffing."Why are you doing this? What do you want?"


Shirley's eyes burned with jealousy and anger. "I want Patrick. I can't let you have him. I'll tell Patrick about your pregnancy and show him what a schemer you are."


Emily was stunned by Shirley's venom. "Shirley, you're going too far.
There's nothing between Patrick and me anymore. Why are you so obsessed?"


Shirley sneered. "Nothing between you? You think being pregnant with Patrick's child means nothing? Just wait, I'll make sure Patrick sees your true colors."


Seeing Emily so upset that she couldn't speak, Shirley felt a sense of relief.It was as if all the frustration she had endured from Patricia had finally found an outlet.


Shirley watched her go, smirking. 'I won't tell Patrick about your pregnancy. You're the only one who thinks he'll make you get rid of the baby,idiot.


As Emily walked down the hallway, she weighed her options. Instead of letting Shirley control her fate, she decided to tell Patrick herself.She was determined to keep the baby, even if it meant Patrick rejecting her. After all,he was with Patricia now, and he probably didn't care about her feelings.


Just then. Emily saw Patrick coming out of his office. Nervous, she tried to avoid him, but it was too late. Patrick noticed her and looked surprised.


"Emily? What are you doing here?" Patrick asked.


Emily was conflicted and didn't know how to respond. "Shirley asked me to come."


Patrick frowned. "Shirley? What does she want with you?"


After a moment of hesitation, Emily said, "She said a calculation formula is missing and asked me to check if there's a backup."

Patrick looked confused. "Shirley is getting out of hand. You don't have to
deal with her. If she bothers you again, just refuse."

Emily nodded, feeling bitter. "Patrick. I need to talk to you."

Patrick looked at her. "What is it? Go ahead."

Emily struggled to find the right words, afraid of Patrick's reaction and being hurt again.


Just then, Patricia walked over. Patrick greeted her warmly, and Emily watched the interaction between Patrick and Patricia, feeling a twinge of heartache. It seemed that she was soon going to lose her place in Patrick's heart; his tenderness and smiles were now all directed at Patricia.


Suppressing her pain, Emily said, "Take your time talking, I have to go.Goodbye."


With tears in her eyes, Emily walked away, unsure of her next steps. She found herself on the rooftop of the Rivera Group, a place where she used to seek solace after being humiliated by Patrick.


Looking at the skyscrapers around her, Emily leaned on the railing, lost in memories of high school. Back then, Lucy was like a gem that outshone all others, radiating a captivating light. She was every boy's dream girl,her beauty etched in the hearts of all who beheld her.

Lucy had cascading golden hair, smooth and glossy in the light. Her eyes were clear and bright, sparkling with a playful glint whenever she narrowed them slightly in a teasing smile. Not to mention, her skin was porcelain-white,radiant, and flawless.
###Chapter 90 Childhood Sweethearts

Everyone liked Lucy, including Emily. Back in high school. Emily was dirt poor,always stuck in her school uniform. She didn't have any pretty dresses, shoes, bags. or even a decorative hairpin with diamonds. So. when it came to looks. Emily felt she couldn't hold a candle to Lucy.


Then there was Patrick, who was like Lucy's shadow, always around her.He was already 6'4" back then, tall and straight like a pine tree. with a presence that turned heads wherever he went.


Emily felt like a thief, always sneaking glances atthe shared moments between Lucy and Patrick from their school days.


"Lucy, about that last question on the math test...? Is the auxiliary line supposed to go here?”


Lucy smoothly sketched a curve on her scratch paper, the blue ribbon in her hair swaying gently. "See? Connecting these two points gives us similar triangles."


Outside, the cicadas fell silent. Emily stared at the two heads in front of her, closely huddled together, her pencil tip poking tiny holes into the eraser.


Patrick's school uniform collar was always crisp, but now it tilted slightly toward Lucy. like a compass drawn to a magnet.


“Wrong.” Patrick's voice sliced through the chatter, his long fingers pressing down on Lucy's paper. "This needs to be a perpendicular line here...” As he pulled the pencil from his grip, a gentle breeze stirred Lucy's hair.
"Patrick!" Lucy puffed up her cheeks. pressing her palm against the draft paper. “I'm about to solve it!"


“By the time you figure it out, the steak in the cafeteria will probably be sold out." His voice held a rare warmth, his knuckles tapping lightly on the desk.


“Remember to bring your jacket for PE next period." As he stood, the hem of his uniform brushed against Emily's desk, leaving behind a faint scent of laundry detergent.


Emily quickly pulled back her fingers, almost brushing against him. The thud of a basketball hitting the pavement echoed from the playground as she caught snippets of Lucy's voice discussing, "borrowing your chemistry notes for the duty today." It was then that she noticed Patrick's chair,still tilted slightly backward, reminiscent of every time Lucy spoke, he would unconsciously lean in her direction.


“Emily,are you coming with us?" Lucy turned her head, sunlight catching on her eyelashes like shards of gold.


Emily tightened her grip on the frayed cuffs of her uniform, her throat feeling like it was stuffed with damp cotton. She could feel Patrick's gaze skimming over her head, finally landing on the blue bow bouncing in Lucy's hair.


"You guys go ahead." She lowered her head, pretending to organize her backpack, listening as their footsteps faded away.


Muffled voices echoed in the hallway, "I told you not to run in the corridor..."

"Got it. Mr. Rivera!" The last note carried a swveet, sticky laughter, like
melting cotton candy drifting on a spring breeze.

As Emily crossed the courtyard with her homework in hand. raindrops slanted through the shadows of the camphor trees. She saw Patrick's blue checkered umbrella leaning toward Lucy, exposing his wet right shoulder.Water droplets slid down his sharp jawline, leaving dark stains on the ground.


“Didn't I tell you to bring an umbrella?" His deep voice mingled with the sound of rain.


"The weather forecast said scattered showers..." Lucy's voice suddenly rose.“Patrick. your shoulder is soaked!"


As the umbrella swayed. Emily saw the boy pull the girl closer to the center of the umbrella with his left hand, while his right hand maintained a polite distance behind her.


Suddenly, thunder cracked through the rain. Lucy instinctively inched closer to Patrick, the blue ribbon brushing against his school badge.


Emily counted the raindrops on the second button of his uniform until her eyes began to sting. The unopened, transparent raincoat in her arms suddenly felt scalding, curling silently into a ball amidst the patter of rain.


“Patrick, look!” Lucy exclaimed, pointing at the sky,“It's a double rainbow!”


At that moment, Patrick tilted his head back, and Emily finally saw the light flicker in his eyes.


That glow was familiar-she had seen it countless times at dusk-when Lucy spoke on the podium; when she fell on the playground and laughed while getting back up; when she held out a milk tea, saying, “This one's
for you." Like the North Star always pointing in a fixed direction, like migratory birds never losing their way home.


The classroom was empty after class. Emily gently brushed over the open exercise book on Patrick's desk, the penmanship penetrating the paper,with an ink blot blooming at the end of the character.


She suddenly noticed the edge of the draft paper had a crooked sunflower drawn on it, identical to the stickers on Lucy's pencil case.
###Chapter 91 Lucy is Sick

In a quiet corner of the campus. Patrick and Lucy could always be seen hanging out. They'd sit under this big tree, sharing laughs and tears.Patrick would gently brush the leaves out of Lucy's hair, and she'd smile at him, her eyes sparkling with happiness. It was like time just stopped for them.


Emily often daydreamed about being in Lucy's shoes,hoping that one day Patrick would look at her the same way. Maybe it was her genuine heart,or maybe it was her past jealous thoughts, but after the SATs, Lucy got really sick.


That summer, right after the SATs, should've been all about fun and looking forward to the future. But out of nowhere, disaster struck.


Lucy.always so cheerful and full of life, was diagnosed with leukemia.The news hit like a ton of bricks, leaving everyone on campus in shock and sadness.


Patrick was in the middle of chatting about plans with his friends when he heard the news. His face went pale, and his eyes filled with disbelief and fear. He couldn't wrap his head arouand the fact that Lucy, always smiling by his side, was now seriously ill.


"No way, this can't be happening! Lucy can't have leukemia. There must be some mistake!" Patrick's voice shook with anxiety. He rushed to the hospital to see for himself.


When he got there and saw Lucy lying in that hospital bed, it felt like his heart was being squeezed. Lucy's face was so pale, and her bright eyes had lost their shnine, She lay there quietly, with a fragile look about her.
"Lucy, you're gonna get better. I promise I'll find a way to cure you."Patrick held her hand tightly, his eyes ful of determination. He swore he'd do whatever it took to make sure she recovered.


Patrick started organizing his classmates to get tested for a bone marrow match. He went around, desperate to find some hope. His eyes were filled with both hope and anxiety as he realized that time was running out for Lucy.


Meanwhile.Emily was dealing with her own problems. Earlier that month,her mom and brother had suddenly fallen ill and needed a lot of medication. To pay for it, Emily had to donate plasma for money.

But even with all that. Emily still went to get tested for a blood type match.While getting her blood drawn, Emily nervously asked the nurse if she could still be tested after donating plasma earlier that month. The nurse scolded her, "You're already weak, and you want to donate bone marrow too?"


Emily remembered the nurse warning her that if she donated blood again,she might develop thalassemia, an incurable disease. The thought of it scared Emily to death.


So after that blood draw, Emily didn't say a word to Patrick and just quietly went back to her dorm. Later, when the classmates who got tested came back, they said only Emily's blood type matched Lucy's-they both had that rare RHAB type. When Patrick heard the news, he searched everywhere for Emily but couldn't find her. He was furious. Emily sat on her bed, hugging her knees, feeling a bit relieved that she didn't have her phone with her. It was the perfect excuse to dodge Patrick.


But deep down, Emily knew she was in the wrong. She skipped school for a few days, too scared to face Patrick. She couldn't bear the thought of his
teary eyes. She felt that if Patrick asked her to die for Lucy, she might just agree. However, she couldn't sacrifice her life for Lucy; she didn't think she was that noble.


Patrick, clueless about Emily's situation, kept looking for her. Without a phone.he had classmates pass on messages. found her class schedule, and waited for her in every classroom. He even waited outside her dorm.calling her name over and over. Some classmates even thought Patrick had developed feelings for Emily now because of Lucy's illness.


Finally, one evening. Patrick found Emily. It was the first time he had ever approached her, but it didn't go well.


"The doctor said your blood type matches Lucy's. You can ask for anything.just please save her." Patrick pleaded, his eyes full of tears.

Emily stayed silent, not knowing how to turn him down. She didn't want everyone to know her family was so poor that she had to donate plasma for money.


Emily had her pride, and she could only meet Patrick's desperate plea with silence.


"Emily, say something! Whatever you want, I'll do it. Just save Lucy,"Patrick begged, gripping her shoulders.


Emily closed her eyes, gritted her teeth, and pushed him away. "I'm really sorry about Lucy, but I can't help. I'm powerless."


Eventually, the Kim family couldn't wait any longer. They heard about a hospital abroad that found a match for Lucy's blood and bone marrow, so they decided to take her there for treatment. This decision left Patrick feeling utterly desperate. He knew this might be Lucy's last hope, but he
couldn't be with her.

On the day Lucy left. Patrick rushed to the airport, frantic. He wanted to see her one last time, to tell her how much he loved her and how much he hoped she'd get better. But when he got there, the Kim family had already boarded the plane with Lucy. Patrick could only watch as the plane took off.


"Lucy,you have to get better. I'll be waiting for you," Patrick's voice echoed in the wind. his eyes filled with tears and longing. He didn't know if he'd ever see Lucy again, his heart filled with fear and unease. And at the same time, he couldn't stop thinking about Emily, the girl with a heart of steel.
###Chapter 92 Cheer Up and Give Thanks

After Lucy went abroad. Patrick was on edge every single day.waiting for any news. He kept tabs on the mnedical updates from overseas, hoping for some good news about Lucy. But life had other plans. A mnonth later,he got the gut-wrenching news that Lucy had a rejection reaction after a bone marrow match, and she didn't make it.


Patrick was shattered. He couldn't wrap his head around it,feeling like his whole world had just crumbled. Memories of the good times with Lucy kept flashing through his mind.


"Lucy, how could you leave me like this? We had so many dreams to chase,how could you just give up?" Patrick's voice was thick with despair.He was drowning in regret and self-blame, convinced he hadn't done enough for Lucy, hadn't loved her enough.


In college. Patrick spiraled into a deep pit of despair. The confident guy he once was had vanished, replaced by someone silent and withdrawn.He shut himself off from everyone, his eyes always clouded with sadness and indifference. making people think twice before approaching him.


Every day. hethought of Lucy-her smile, her kindness. He felt like he'd lost the most important person in his life and had no clue how to move on.He buried himself in studies and work, trying to numb the pain.


But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake off Lucy's memory.She was always there, in his mind, making it impossible to let go. He knew she'd always have a place in his heart.


Emily had been watching Patrick from the sidelines. She knew how much he was hurting and felt the sting of Lucy's loss, too. She wanted to comfort him, but was scared her presence would just make things worse.
After finally getting into the same university as Patrick, Emily, who had been stealing glances at him for a wvhile, finally mustered the courage to approach him. "Patrick, I know you're hurting, but you can't go on like this. You have to be strong. Lucy wouldn't want to see you like this." She lowered her eyes after speaking. Even though Lucy's death wasn't her fault.in Patrick's eyes. Emily had become the scapegoat.


Patrick looked at Emily, his eyes cold and distant. Without a word,he turned and walked away.


Emily watched him go, feeling helpless and heartbroken. She knew she could never take Lucy's place in his heart, but she still hoped he'd find his way out of the darkness and regain his confidence.


As time went by. Patrick's mood slowly stabilized. He knew he couldn't keep wallowing in pain; he had to live well for Lucy. And as for Emily,who had always been there, he realized he'd never treated her right.


That was why Emily always stayed silent in the face of Patrick's indifference. Lucy's death had created an unbridgeable gap between them.and now someone who looked so much like her had appeared.


Emily hugged herself, letting the cold wind bite at her neck. At that moment, she felt like all her years of effort meant nothing to Patrick.


Emily left the Rivera Group in a daze, feeling like her world had lost all its color.


The sun was shining, but it couldn't warm the coldness in her heart. She slowly walked out of the building that held so many memories.


On the street, people were bustling around, but Emily felt completely alone.Memories of her time with Patrick kept flashing through her mind;those
sweet moments now felt like knives piercing her heart. She had no idea where to go, her heart was a mess of confusion and pain.

How ridiculous, she thought. She had hoped Patrick would come looking for her, maybe even apologize. She had once believed their relationship could go back to the way it was, even foolishly imagining that if Patrick knew she was pregnant, he might treat her differently.


Back at Crystal Heights Residences. Emily opened the door to a silent room. She collapsed onto the sofa, tears streaming down her face. She looked around the empty room, feeling utterly lost. She waited for Patrick to come back, but as night fell, he didn't return, not even a phone call.


Emily's heart sank. What she was waiting for might not be Patrick's true feelings. but perhaps just his pity.


What did she really mean to Patrick? A capable secretary? Or just a lover?In the end, she had wanted too much.


Emily touched her belly and sighed. God had given her three years with Patrick; what more could she ask for?


Lucy would always be Patrick's unforgettable first love. She represented his youth, and even if someone who looked like her appeared now, it would still stir up memories for Patrick. Emily was just a companion in his loneliness.


For three days straight, Emily's life was a blur. She spent each day replaying every moment with Patrick, thepain in her heart never easing.She tried to keep herself busy, to forget Patrick, but no matter what she did.his image was always there.

Finally. Emily decided to go to the hospital for a check-up. The hospital's
smell of disinfectant was oppressive. As she sat waiting, Emily was filled with nervousness. During this period, she found herself wrapped in sadness and gloom, worrying that it might somehow impact the baby growing inside her.


When the doctor told her she could go back to work, Emily felt a glimmer of hope. She decided to pull herself together and return to work at the Hughes Group. She knew she couldn't keep wallowing in pain; she had to fight for her future and her child's. Continuing to sink would only worsen the situation, trapping her in an endless cycle of longing for Patrick.


"Are you really feeling better? The doctor said everything's fine, right?"Marlon asked, seeing Emily in the design department early in the morning.

Emily handed Marlon a lunchbox, saying, "Thanks for the other day.These are handmade sandwiches I made. If you don't mind, give them a try," she said with a smile.


Marlon raised an eyebrow and took the lunchbox from Emily. He had always known she was good at cooking. Sometimes, when they used to hang out with Patrick, he would have a meal before coming out to play.
###Chapter 93 The Beauty of Rivera Manor

Seeing Emily's calm face. Marlon felt a wave of happiness. Even though she had turned him down, he had liked her for years and just wanted her to be herself, not to rely on Patrick.


Marlon tightened his grip on the office door handle. With his back to Emily, he said. "Emily, I'll always be here, waiting for you."

As Marlon walked away, Emily sighed and fiddled with her bracelet.Maybe she felt about Marlon the way Patrick felt about her. Even though Marlon was a great guy, Emily just didn't love him.


Meanwhile, outside the Rivera Group building, the setting sun cast a golden glow over everything. Patrick walked out with his usual steady stride, but stopped short wwhen he saw Efren by his car. Patrick's brow furrowed in annoyance. "Tell my mother I'm not coming home tonight,"he said, trying to get past Efren.


But Efren quickly snatched the keys from William and said firmly, "Mr.Rivera, Mrs. Rivera insists you come home for dinner tonight." Patrick's frown deepened as he noticed Patricia walking out of the building. She looked elegant in the sunset, a confident smile on her face.


Patrick paused, then said, "No need, you can take Ms. Evans back." But Efren stood his ground. "Mr. Rivera, if you don't want Mrs. Rivera to go directly to Ms. Thompson, I suggest you come home for dinner with Ms.Evans tonight. Mrs. Rivera was very upset when you didn't come home a few days ago. If she decides to send Ms. Thompson away,you might not get another chance to see her."


"Are you threatening me?" Patrick asked, anger flashing in his eyes. Efren took a step back, seeing Patricia getting closer, and said softly, "Mr. Rivera.
Mrs. Rivera's decisions are usually final. I just don't want to see you in a tough spot." Patrick looked at Efren, feeling a mix of emotions. He knew Efren was trying to help, but he hated being pushed around.


Patrick didn't like being controlled. Since becoming the head of the Rívera Group, he has often clashed with Jennifer, leading to many conflicts.Jennifer rarely came to the office anymore, knowing Patrick needed to assert himself. She didn't like to interfere.


But this time, Jennifer seemed determined to meddle in Patrick's life. Just as Patrick was about to lose his temper. Patricia walked up. "Efren, why did you bother picking me up again? I told you this morning, I'd ride back with Patrick tonight, right?" Patricia calmly opened the car door,glanced at Patrick without a word, and started working on her laptop.


Patricia was clearly sharper than Shirley, who came down the stairs a moment later and saw the whole scene.


Patricia said, "Efren, if Patrick isn't coming, let's head back first. I'm starving."


Efren hopped into the car without hesitation. Patrick knew his mom,Jennifer, was stubborn. If he defied her about Patricia, she'd definitely make Emily leave, just like Efren warned. With a sigh, he got in the car and sat next to Patricia.


"Wait for me, Patrick!" Shirley's voice echoed, but it was too late. Patrick's car sped off, leaving her behind. She watched the exhaust fumes fade.stomping her foot in frustration.


The setting sun bathed her in light, bout it couldn't warm her cold heart.Her eyes were filled with loss and anger. Usually, Patrick would take her back to the Rivera Manor, and she'd feel like the happiest person alive.
But lately. Patrick had been unpredictable. She'd leave work early,hoping to see him, but he was never there.


Today, she finally saw him and hoped to go back with him as usual. But instead, he left with Patricia. Shirley was furious, biting her lip and clenching her fists so hard her nails dug into her palms. She silently cursed Patricia, 'Damn you,Patricia! How dare you steal my man!


A gentle breeze tousled Shirley's hair, but she didn't bother fixing it.Images of Patrick and Patricia together kept flashing in her mind, driving her jealousy to madness. She was terrified of losing Patrick and her place at the Rivera Manor.


She quickly hailed a taxi, telling the driver she was catching someone cheating,and the car sped off.


She had to arrive at Rivera Manor first to ensure Patricia had no chance to play hostess.

In the quiet outskirts stood the magnificent Rivera Manor.


The grand gate was tall and imposing, with black iron carvings and golden decorations, exuding luxury and dignity. Beyond the gate, a wide cobblestone path wound forward, flanked by lush greenery. Tall plane trees stretched their branches, providing shade. The flower beds along the path were filled with colorful blooms, emitting a charming fragrance.


Walking along the cobblestone path, a spectacular fountain came into view.In the center, an exquisite sculpture stood, with water spraying around it,shimmering in the sunlight. Surrounding the fountain was a neatly trimmed lawn, soft like a green carpet. Delicate outdoor furniture was placed on the lawn, perfect for enjoying the beautiful scenery.
The manor's main buildings consisted of three villas, with the main guest house where Jennifer lived year-round. The white walls and blue roofs looked exceptionally elegant. The villa's large, bright windows had golden frames that shone in the sunlight.
###Chapter 94 The Future Mistress of Rivera Manor

At the back of the manor, there was this super chill lake. The water was so clear it was easy to see right through it, and little ripples danced across the surface whenever the breeze blew. Along the shore, a bunch of weeping willows swayed their branches like they were playing with the lake.A few elegant white swans glided around, their reflections making the wvhole scene look like a painting.


Anyone who visited Rivera Manor couldn't help but be blown away, like they had just stepped into a paradise where everything was picture-perfect.


Patricia was cruising around in a golf cart, soaking in the views of the manor like she already owned the place.


Shirley watched Patricia lounging in the cart, biting her lip as she noticed Elbert still fixing the roof of his little red house, feeling super embarrassed.


Elbert had named his white-walled. red-tiled cottage "Enchanted Cottage."which Shirley thought was pretty childish.

Outside the RiveraManor, the golden sunset wrapped the whole place in a warm, mysterious glow. Shirley stood at the main gate, eagerly waiting with her eyes glued to the distant road. She was dressed to impress in a light blue dress that showed off her charm, with her long curly hair cascading over her shoulders. She kept fidgeting with her skirt,anxiously waiting for Patrick.


Shirley stood at the entrance of the main guest house, watching Patricia and Patrick walk towards her. She quickly stepped forward,wedging herself between them, and warmly asked Patrick. "Patrick, what took you
so long? Jennifer cooked up a storm today. all by herself. and I haven't had her cooking in ages!"


When Patrick's car finally came into view. Shirley greeted him with a beaming smile. Her eyes sparkled with pride. like she was showing off her special place in the Rivera family to Patricia.


Patricia, dressed in a simple yet elegant white suit. her long hair neatly tied back, looked all business. She raised an eyebrow. giving Shirley a cold look with a hint of disdain in her smile. "Since Jennifer worked so hard today.why didn't I see you helping out? Or do you think you're too good to lend a hand in the kitchen?" Patricia's words were dripping with sarcasm, instantly darkening Shirley's mood.


"Mind your own business! Jennifer has always treated me like family. You better watch your tone." Shirley's face turned red with anger, her hands clenched into fists as she glared at Patricia. She felt like Patricia was deliberately trying to mess with her, disrupting her peaceful life at the Rivera Manor.


But Patricia didn't seem bothered by Shirley's anger. She calmly said,"Sorry, but I won't be polite to someone who freeloads." With that, she casually patted Shirley's shoulder with her handbag and strutted into the main guest house.


Shirley was shaking with anger at Patricia's actions, her eyes red and tears threatening to spill. She looked at Patrick, hoping he'd step in. "Patrick.look at her, she's bullying me. Are you just gonna stand there and let her do that? You used to treat me like a sister." Her voice was full of hurt,making anyone who heard her feel sorry for her.


Patrick, dressed in a sharp black suit, stood tall and imposing. He furrowed his brow slightly as he watched Patricia walk away, feeling a bit
helpless. Patricia had that proud vibe and didn't feel the need to please anyone, especially not Shirley. He reached out and patted Shirley's shoulder gently. saying. "She's a guest. don't make a scene and embarrass my mom."


Even though Patrick's words stung. Shirley knew she couldn't make things harder for him right now. She tried to hold back her tears. forcing a strained smile. 'Alright. so what if Patricia's acting all high and mighty?She hasn't married Patrick yet. Besides. it doesn't look like Patrick's into her. With that attitude, it's a wonder he can stand her. Shirley thought.feeling like she still had a shot as long as Patricia wasn't officially with Patrick.


With that in mind. Shirley suddenly felt she didn't need to stir up trouble;maybe Patrick didn't even like Patricia. Jennifer was justbeing hopeful.


Thinking this, she linked her arm with Patrick's, wanting to go inside together.But Patrick gently pulled his hand away, his eyes showing a mix of tenderness and firmness. "Shirley, you can't cling to me like before." His voice was deep and magnetic, making Shirley's heart race.


Blushing, Shirley shyly said, "Okay, Patrick." She knew she couldn't come on too strong; she had to slowly win Patrick back, especially after the dumb things she had done before.


Shirley knew Patrick had always seen her as a sister, but she wanted more.She secretly vowed that one day she'd turn Patrick into her boyfriend.With that thought, Shirley clenched her fists, put on a sweet and gentle smile. and walked into the main guest house.


Inside, Jennifer was chatting happily with Patricia. Jennifer, in a purple dress with an elegant hairstyle, had a kind smile on her face. She was great at conversation, full of wisdom and humor. Patricia listened
attentively, responding politely. Jennifer nodded in satisfaction.

As Shirley entered and saw Jennifer and Patricia getting along so well,jealousy flared up inside her. She tried to join the conversation several times but was cleverly blocked by Patricia. It was clear Patricia had no intention of letting Shirley get a word in; she kept engaging Jennifer more,making it impossible for Shirley to join in.
###Chapter 95 You Must Come Back Tonight

"Ms. Evans, it's your first time dining with the Rivera family. Jennifer's cooking is top-notch, you gotta try it. I've been eating her food since I was a kid, so I'm pretty used to it." Shirley said, finally finding a chance to speak up. Her tone was a mix of trying to be nice and a bit provocative.


Patricia smirked, "So, you're sick of it and don't want to eat anymore,huh?"That comment made Shirley see red, and she snapped, "That's not what I meant."


Jennifer placed her fork down and shot Shirley a stern look, "No yelling at the table. How many times do I have to tell you?" Shirley sat down,feeling hurt,tears welling up in her eyes. She felt more and more like she was losing her place in the family, and Patricia's presence was making her feel threatened.


Patricia took Shirley's spot, sitting between Jennifer and Patrick. Shirley had wanted to sit next to Patrick, but Jennifer's glare stopped her.


Shirley always thought she knew Jennifer's preferences, but now she realized she'd always be seen as less important, no matter who else was around. She felt like just a well-known servant. This realization made her feel miserable during the meal.


After dinner. Jennifer checked the time and said, "Patrick, it's getting late.You should take Patricia home. If her parents are there,say hi before you come back." Patrick nodded, grabbed William's keys, and was about to leave. Shirley stood up and said, "Patrick, let me come with you to take Patricia home. She might feel lonely, and we can chat on the way back."


Patrick didn't mind, but Jennifer frowned and said, "You stay. Elbert is fixing the roof, go help him."
To Shirley. Jennifer mentioning Elbert in front of Patricia felt like a deliberate humiliation. She bit her lip and said,"Jennifer..."

Jennifer cut her off, "Shirley. did you not hear me?" With tears in her eyes.Shirley reluctantly left.


Shirley felt Jennifer was trying to humiliate her by mentioning Elbert fixing the roof in front of Patricia. She was filled with anger and hurt,not understanding why Jennifer treated her this way. She angrily picked flowers and plants along the way, throwing them on the ground. When she saw the servants looking at her, she snapped. "What are you looking at!?"


Shirley's position in the Rivera family was somewhere between a servant and a family member, often the butt of jokes, and no one was afraid of her.Someone rolled their eyes at her and walked away.


Meanwhile, Patrick, driving the car, was lost in thought. He had no idea how Shirley was feeling.


All he could think about was getting back to Crystal Heights Residences after dropping off Patricia. He hadn't seen Emily all day and was feeling anxious.


Though Patricia seemed to be challenging Shirley, she didn't have feelings for Patrick.


Sitting in the car, she looked out the window, thinking about her future.She knew her relationship with Patrick was all about family interests. They didn't like each other.


Patrick drove while Patricia handled business in the back seat, their relationship feeling like that of a driver and passenger who barely knew
each other.

When they got to the Evans Manor. Patricia told Patrick to head back directly. They weren't officially together yet. and she didn't want to introduce him to her family and start any gossip.


Patricia was cautious. Just as Patrick was about to turn towards Crystal Heights Residences. he got a call from Jennifer.

"Patrick, you need to come back tonight. I have something to tell you."Jennifer said firmly.


"Mom, just tell me over the phone." Patrick replied quietly.

"Patrick. don't make me say something harsh. Patricia is a good girl. a perfect match for you. She's the daughter-in-law I've chosen. You'd better understand your place and not make any wrong decisions. In the past.you could date whoever you wanted, but now I can't let you continue like this. You know what I mean." Hearing Jennifer's words. Patrick lit a cigarette, the flame flicering in the dark.
###Chapter 96 The Invitation

Patrick really didn't want totalk about his feelings for Emily with Jennifer.
Sometimes, he felt like he didn't even understand himself.


Seeing Patrick go quiet. Jennifer jumped in, "The Evans Group has a bunch of development sites right now. When we lost to them at the last auction, they acquired this site. My research shows it could be worth around $9.23 billion. The Rivera Group can't handle this alone. and it's likely that the Evans Group can't either. I need you and Patricia to establish a closer relationship, secure cooperation rights. and convince them to co-develop."


Jennifer continued, "You know the Rivera Group hasn't been doing great in real estate lately. Even if you don't do it for yourself, think about the responsibility you have towards the 30,000-plus employees of the Rivera Group." Hearing Jennifer's words, Patrick said. "I get it, I'll be back soon."

Jennifer was right; he shouldn't be only thinking about romance. Even though he missed her like crazy, he kept telling himself that not seeing her wouldn't be the end of the world. He figured he would wait a few days until he sorted things out with Patricia.


Patrick suddenly wanted to get Emily a gift. She'd been wearing that old bracelet for years and couldn't bear to part with it. Patrick had been to so many auctions but hadn't given her anything valuable. He felt a bit guilty about that.


While Patrick was away, Emily's life seemed to get back to normal. Marlon noticed Emily's health improving and handed her an invitation.


Marlon, dressed in a stylish casual outfit with slightly messy hair, looked charming. His face was lit up with a smile, and his eyes were full of
concern for Emily."Emily, didn't you want to go to this year's Jewelry Design Grand Exhibition in Sunshine Bay City? I heard you submitted a design to the crafts department, but it got rejected?" Marlon teased her.

Emily, in a simple white shirt and blue jeans, with her long hair casually tied back, looked fresh. There was a hint of sadness in her eyes as she said."Yeah, I designed a traditional-style bracelet, the kind that celestial maidens would wear gracefully on their arms."

Marlon asked, "What kind of bracelet was it?"


Emily explained, "This bracelet required a lot of intricate decorations and a blend of modern and traditional craftsmanship. Unfortunately, I was missing a crucial technique, and my colleagues in the crafts department said that the skill had been lost over time, so we couldn't create a sample.I was worried."


Marlon shook the invitation in his hand with a mysterious smile. "Well, I'm here to save you. Check this out."

"What's this?" Emily asked, curious.


Emily opened it and saw the words "Traditional Craftsmanship Fair and Auction" written on it.


"Wow, I've been dying to get an invite to one of Mr. Phillips' events,but it's always been impossible! You actually got one! How did you know Mr.Phillips had the key technique I needed?" Emily's eyes sparkled with surprise.


Seeing Emily's excitement, Marlon ran a hand through his hair and said proudly, "Of course, I'm the heir to the Hughes Group. Getting this invite was a piece of cake for me. So, what's there to worry about? Didn't I just
do you a huge favor?" Marlon leaned on the table with both hands. clearly fishing for some appreciation.


Emily pushed the cookies on the table towards him, smiling. "Yes. Mr.Hughes, you've really helped me out. Consider these cookies my thank-you gift. Take them and go. I need to study the invitation and improve my design quickly. If I meet Mr. Phillips later, I want to showcase my design concept properly."


Marlon looked at the cookies and said in a slightly hurt tone, "Oh my god.is this all I get for helping you?"


Emily stood up with a smile, pretending to take the cookies back. Marlon quickly hugged them to his chest, saying, "Hey, once given, you can't take them back."


Tying her hair back, Emily said, "Mr. Hughes, please don't bother me now.I'm busy."


Marlon shook his head, admiring how dedicated Emily was to her work.No wonder everyone at the Rivera Group used to call her a "workaholic."Marlon thought to himself, 'Patrick, it's your loss for not appreciating Emily. If you didn't, I wouldn't have had the chance to meet her. It's a shame, but if Emily had feelings for me, you wouldn't stand a chance.'


Meanwhile,looking at the invitation in front of him, Patrick asked Jennifer,"When did the Rivera Group get involved in the jewelry industry?"


Jennifer replied, "It's Patricia; she likes to collect intricately designed and elegant jewelry. The second half of this exhibition is an auction, so you and Patricia should go together. Consider it a weekend break. You can't work in the office every day. Besides, when are you going to settle down and start a family? It all depends on how things progress between you two.
Hearing Jennifer's words, Patricia blushed, a rare moment of shyness. She glanced at Patrick and said, "Patrick, if you don't want to go with me.it's okay. I can go by myself. Don't worry, I won't be bored."


Just as Patrick was about to agree with Patricia and refuse to go to the auction. Jennifer cut him off. "Patricia, don't overthink it. Patrick has been to many auctions before, so let him accompany you. You might find a piece of jewelry you like and ask Patrick to buy it for you."
###Chapter 97 Chief Designer Nora Adams

Patrick knew Jennifer had made up her mind, and if he pushed back too hard, she'd definitely get suspicious. He had planned to visit Emily over the weekend. but he didn't expect Jennifer to be all over his schedule.Rubbing his temples, he sighed, "Alright. I'll come pick up Patricia in the afternoon."


Shirley, holding a cup of coffee, watched Patrick with eager eyes. She placed the coffee in front of him and leaned in, whispering. "Patrick, you always took me to auctions. I'm really into this traditional crafts exhibition too. Can I come along? I promise I won't bother you1 and Patricia. I'll just wander around on my own, okay?" Her eyes were so hopeful,it was hard to say no.


Patrick's resolve softened when he saw Shirley's expression. He didn't really want to go along with Patricia anyway. He glanced at Jennifer,and seeing no objection, he said, "Alright, you can come with us. Just let me know what catches your eye." His gentle tone made Shirley's heart skip a beat.


Shirley lifted her chin proudly at Patricia,as if to flaunt her special place in Patrick's life. But Patricia just gave her a cold look, then casually pulled out five black cards from her bag, showing off her wealth before putting them back with a calm expression.


Shirley was stunned by Patricia's move, feeling a wave of inferiority. She bitterly thought that if she came from a rich family too, Patricia wouldn't treat her like this. Her eyes dimmed with helplessness. She bit her lip,silently vowing to work hard and raise her status so no one could look down on her.
Henry Phillips, the heir to traditional craftsmanship, created pieces that were like works of art. Each piece of jewelry was intricate, with unique craftsmanship and priceless value. In an age where traditional skills were hard to replicate with modern methods, people valued these centuries-old techniques even more.


He never married nor found a suitable apprentice. His personality was peculiar, and his work ethic was so strict it bordered on harshness. When he was younger, he had high hopes of training several apprentices to pass on his craft. But if they didn't meet his exacting standards, he would ruthlessly make them destroy their work. The materials used were often gold, silver, or diamonds, which were already valuable. Naturally, the apprentices hesitated to destroy pieces that had cost them so much effort and precious materials. Eventually, Henry gave up on them.


Henry thought people were too obsessed with money and lacked the pure heart needed for true craftsmanship. They just couldn't grasp the essence of it, let alone pass it on. As he got older, he realized his precious skills were at risk of dying out. That was why his annual ancient craftsmanship exhibition became such a big deal. Everyone knew Henry's creations were becoming rarer, and collectors from all over wanted to snag one of his masterpieces.


Tickets for the exhibition were like gold dust, usually snapped up by influential noble families as soon as Henry announced the event. Regular folks had to pay through the nose to get in. The Hughes family, being one of the top jewelry tycoons in Pearl Peak City, had no trouble getting an invite. But they usually sent their chief designer to these things.


Today, in the coffee room of the Hughes Group, the air was thick with tension. A freelance designer, green with envy, said, "Ms. Adams,why did Mr.Hughes give your spot to that Emily this time? You're our chief
designer. Why should she go? She's only been here a hot minute."The designer's words were dripping with jealousy, clearly unhappy about Emily's sudden rise.


Nora Adams, a short-haired woman in a sharp suit. looked elegant and composed. With her wavy curls and gold-rimmed glasses. she had an intellectual beauty about her. As the chief designer of the Hughes Group.Nora was always respected. Her main focus was modern inlay craftsmanship, and she wasn't particularly into Aetheria's traditional methods. For her, attending these events wasn't a big deal.

When Marlon asked Nora if she could give up her spot for a talented new designer, she agreed without a second thought. She figured it was no biggie, but she didn't expect anyone to get jealous.


Nora's brows furrowed slightly as she scanned the room with a cold gaze.The whispering stopped. She spoke slowly, her voice calm but authoritative,"Have you finished the sketches I assigned? Have you brought the samples from the craftsmanship department? Have you memorized the process for the jewelry design exhibition in Sunshine Bay City?" She fired off questions one after another, making the employee who had been stirring the pot shiver. The others fell silent, not daring to say another word.
###Chapter 98 Why Did Patrick Come to the Exhibition?


Nora took a sip of her coffee, set the cup down, and strolled out of the coffee room with an air of confidence. She wasn't thrilled about the gossip behind her back, but she knew that jealousy and competition were just part of the game at work.


When she got to Emily's office, she gave a light knock. Emily looked up.saw Nora-the Chief Designer of the Hughes Group-and quickly said,"Ms. Adams, what can I do for you?" Emily's eyes showed a mix of doubt and nerves as she wondered why Nora was there.


Nora walked in and took a look around. She was surprised to see that Emily's office was almost as big as hers. Not bad for a newbie designer at Hughes Group. No wonder Emily's colleagues were all jealous of her.

Nora sighed to herself, realizing that in the workplace, talented folks naturally got more opportunities and perks, but also more envy and challenges.


Sitting on the sofa, Nora looked at Emily and said, "You're going to the handicraft exhibition for me this time."


Emily was shocked. She thought Marlon had recommended her without asking Nora.


She quickly stood up, put the invitation on Nora's coffee table,and said,"I m sorry, Ms. Adams, if you're going, then I won't. And I wasn't informed by Mr.Hughes."

Nora raised her hand to stop Emily from explaining. She smiled and said."
I focus on modern art, and I'm not really into Aetheria's craftsmanship. Mr.
Hughes sending you means he thinks highly of you. Go and learn well.and we can talk about it later. Nowadays, people appreciate both modern and traditional styles. Don't worry. I'm not here to scold you. I never liked going to this event anyway, so it's good you're going instead. I just wanted to clear things up. If anyone talks badly about you, know it's not from me."With that, Nora calmly left Emily's office.

Watching Nora leave, Emily felt grateful. She didn't expect Nora to be so understanding. Emily had never met someone as cool and straightforward as Nora before. It reminded her of her time at the Rivera Group,where most people saw her as a rival, making her cautious every day.

Now at Hughes Group. despite some jealousy and gossip, there were still people who appreciated and helped her.

Emily picked up the invitation, holding it tightly. She thought to herself that since she was trusted so much, she had to make the most of this opportunity at the event. She knew this exhibition was not just a learning opportunity but also a chance to prove herself. She wanted those who envied her to see her skills and achievements in this field.


As the exhibition approached, Emily started preparing. She did a ton of research on handicrafts, learning about their history, craftsmanship,and current trends. She also got advice from senior designers, soaking up their experiences and insights.


Emily knew that only with thorough prep could she make the most of the exhibition and not let Marlon and Nora down.


In a tucked-away corner of the bustling city, something mysterious was about to go down. Unlike the usual exhibitions or auctions held in stuffy auction houses, Henry's final handicraft exhibition was set in a Victorian-style private estate for the event.
The winding tree-lined paths, exquisite gazebos and greenhouses.along with the well-arranged fountains and gardens, collectively created a serene and mysterious atmosphere, as if one were transported into a dreamlike world.


Emily had planned to bring Melissa along to the event. Melissa loved tradlitional craftsmanship too. But since Melissa went back to the Clark Manor, she had been swamped with dates arranged by her elders and couldn't make it. So, Emily had to go solo.


Maybe because of the Hughes Group's status, from the moment Emily stepped into the estate. she felt like she was being treated like royalty. She got a seat in the circle closest to the exhibition hall, a spot seemingly reserved for VIPs. giving her a front-row view of the exquisite works on display.


Across from her was the Watson Group's area. separated by a specially designed screen. Emily didn't know these screens had a unique feature.allowing one-way viewing. She could see the items on the exhibition table through the screens, but people outside couldn't peek in. This unique setup added a touch of mystery to the whole event.


Arriving early. Emily sat quietly in her seat, soaking in the calm. The coffee and snacks brought by the waiters smelled amazing. Since getting pregnant. Emily's appetite had picked up. The doctor had said she was too thin, which wasn't good for the baby, so she had started eating more.She nibbled on the pastries while flipping through the catalog of artworks in her hand.


The catalog was like a gateway to the art world, each page showcasing Henry's masterpieces over the years. As Emily looked at those stunning pictures, she was filled with admiration. Each of Henry's works was like a
national treasure. The intricate craftsmanship, unique designs, and deep cultural heritage in them captivated her.


Meanwhile, the organizers got a surprise. The CEO of the Rivera Group.Patrick, showed up unexpectedly with Patricia, the heiress of the Evans Group. Since the innermost circle was reserved for the big players in the jewelry business, the organizers had to quickly arrange two seats in the front row for Patrick and Patricia. Coincidentally, these seats were right within Emily's view.
###Chapter 99 Henry's New Rules

Handcrafted pieces, unlike run-of-the-mill jewelry, were not just beautifully made and detailed, but also super delicate. So, Henry's exhibition was a whole different ball game compared to regular ones. These precious items couldn't be examined up close by everyone like regular jewelry. Only trained staff with special gloves could handle them, walking past each person one by one, letting the crowd admire from a distance without touching.


Emily was deep into the catalog of works when a clear silver bell rang. She put down the pastries and the booklet she was holding, eagerly waiting for the staff to bring out those stunning jewelry pieces. Her heart was racing with excitement. But when she looked up, she saw something she didn't expect.

Patrick, the guy who had left a big mark on her life, was chatting happily with some girl she didn't know.


A storm of emotions hit Emily-surprise, confusion, and a bit of sadness.She thought, 'What is Patrick doing here? When did the Rivera Group get into the jewelry business?'


She had no idea; it had been over a month since she left the Rivera Group.In that short time, it seemed like everything had changed.


Then she thought, Well, the Rivera Group has tons of money and power;they can get into any business they want. If there's money to be made,they'll find a way.


Emily's eyes stayed on Patrick's back for a while. She had to admit, even though she hadn't seen him in days, his back was still as attractive as ever.That straight posture, that confident vibe, seemed to have an invisible pull
on her. But Emily quickly snapped out of it. pressing her lips together.Patrick hadn't called or texted her in all this time. It was like all his previous feelings for her were just a fleeting joke.


Emily shook her head slightly, trying to push all thoughts of Patrick out of her mind. She told herself she couldn't let this guy affect her anymore; she needed to focus on the exhibition and appreciate those beautiful handcrafted pieces. So, she forced herself to pay attention to the exquisite items the staff were about to show.


After everyone had admired the masterpieces, the host stepped onto the stage with a big smile. His steps were steady and confident, like he was about to kick off an artistic extravaganza.


"Welcome, distinguished guests, to Mr. Phillips' handcrafted works exhibition. The first half of our event is wrapping up. Next,we'll move on to our second activity, which is the auction of the thirty-two handcrafted pieces you just saw!" The host's voice was loud and clear,echoing through the hall.


As soon as the host finished speaking, the audience erupted in exclamations. Everyone knew Henry's works were priceless. These pieces had high artistic and practical value, plus immense collectible value.


In the past, Henry's works were only exhibited, not auctioned. This time,the news that some pieces would be auctioned off had drawn many wealthy folks to the event. But no one knew Henry was going to auction off all his collections!


After hearing the host, everyone had different reactions. Some were secretly thrilled, thinking they were lucky to have a chance to buy these precious pieces. Others started toregret not bringing enough money with them today.
Seeing the crowd's reactions, the host raised his hand to quiet them down.cleared his throat, and continued. "Ladies and Gentlemen, please stay calm.Our auction today is different from what you're used to. Each item will start at $150.with increments of $150, but we have set a maximum price."


The host's words caused a stir in the audience. The murmurs grew louder.


"What? There's a maximum price!" exclaimed a glamorous woman.


"I've only heard of no maximum price..." a middle-aged man frowned and said.


"What does a maximum price mean?" another person asked curiously.

"Could it be price-capped sales?" someone speculated.


"Maybe that maximum price refers to a cap of tens of millions of dollars?"a young man guessed.
###Chapter 100 The Show Begins

When folks in theother private rooms heard that, they started to get a bit jittery. Honestly, dropping tens of millions on a one-of-a-kind piece of jewelry wasn't that crazy; the kicker was that those auctions usually wanted cash or cashier's checks, no installment plans allowed.


A bunch of rich families quickly got on the phone with their secretaries.making sure they had the cash ready so they wouldn't miss out on snagging something precious.


Meanwhile. Emily was nervously counting her money, wondering if she had enough to buy anything. When she overheard someone say a piece could go for tens of millions, she shook her head, feeling a bit out of her league, and thought about just enjoying the show.

"Forget it." Emily thought. "Since I'm here. I might as well watch others buy these jewels." She felt a bit bummed but quickly decided to just enjoy the auction and appreciate the art.


Just then, the host's voice boomed out again, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is a rule set by Mr. Phillips. He believes the price of each item should reflect its true value, not some crazy high amount. He wants the craftsmanship to be passed down, so everyone has a chance to wear it, not just lock it away in a safe. Each of these thirty-two treasures has its price,but I can't tell you what they are. You'll need to bid incrementally, starting from the $150 base price. So, if someone bids $15,000, the next bid should be $15,150, not jumping straight to $16,500. That's our first rule,no skipping bids."


Seeing everyone paying attention, the host went on, "Secondly, we only take cash or card payments, no personal checks. Thirdly,since this
exhibition is in a private estate, apart from the people already here, no one else can come in. So, if you were thinking of having friends or staff bring money, don't bother calling them, they won't be let in."

Hearing this, the room buzzed with chatter.

"What are we supposed to do? They didn't mention this before, and now they want everything paid up front. I didn't bring enough money!" a woman's anxious voice came from one of the private rooms.


"Can I pawn my watch or trade something?" a man whispered from a booth behind Emily.


The whole place was buzzing with tension and excitement. Everyone was trying to figure out how to get their hands on the items they wanted.


Meanwhile, Emily thought. 'It's fine, the main reason I came was to visit,and I've already done that. As for the auction, it's the participation that counts.' She had often gone to auctions with Patrick before, just watching without buying anything. Today, she felt happier than before, at least she had her own booth and seat.


Hearing the murmurs below, the host continued, "I'm sorry, we do not accept barter. So, today's auction is all about luck. If you bid the price set by Mr. Phillips, then that jewelry is yours, on-the-spot transaction, first come,first served."


The host's voice was crystal clear in the quiet room, sparking more chatter among the crowd.


A middle-aged woman raised her paddle and spoke into a walkie-talkie,"What if the money we brought isn't enough to buy everything here? Will they be destroyed? Or will there be a second auction?" She was dressed to
the nines, her hair perfectly styled, her eyes a mix of worry and excitement.
It was clear she really admired Henry's work.


The host replied politely, "Don't worry, these items won't be destroyed.They're all masterpieces by Mr. Phillips. Congrats in advance to those who bid successfully today. For items that don't sell, we'll donate them to the Handicraft Museum. Mr. Phillips said he'd be upset if such craftsmanship were lost during his time. Since he has no apprentices, he wants to preserve these crafts in the museum. If someone is destined, they might receive Mr. Phillips' legacy, but it's not guaranteed. Do you all understand the auction rules for today? If everyone is ready, we'll start with the first item."


The host's voice was steady and powerful, his eyes scanning the room as if looking for that special someone.


Everyone straightened up, and the room fell silent. The whole place felt solemn, each person holding onto their own hopes and dreams. Everyone had hoped to win the bid for Henry's masterpieces, including Emily.


Emily sat in her seat, her mind racing. She calculated the cash she had left after the down payment for her house, which was supposed to go towards renovations. But since the place was fully furnished, thanks to Melissa, she had $328,000 in her bank account.


Thinking about it, Emily mentally divided her remaining money. Some of it was for Lisa after she got out of rehab. Lisa's situation had always been a sore spot for her, and she hoped Lisa could start fresh. Another part was for Gordon's recovery. Gordon's condition also weighed heavily on her mind. After all that, she realized she had less than $100,000 of disposable cash!


Emily felt a bit helpless. Faced with such top-notch jewelry, of course,she
wanted it too. The exquisite pieces seemed to call out to her, each one with its own unique charm. But with limited funds, she sighed and kept listening as the host started introducing the prices of the treasures laid out in front of them.


"Next. we have the first treasure, a handcrafted carved necklace, starting at $150!" The host's voice was full of enthusiasm and anticipation.


"I bid $300."

"I bid $450."

"I bid $600..."


The bidding voices echoed one after another, each person eager to quickly match Henry's set price, afraid that if they hesitated,someone else would outbid them. For this group of tycoons, a $150 increment was nothing.They were dressed in their finest, exuding confidence and pride. Their voices echoed in the serene estate, like a fierce battle was unfolding.
