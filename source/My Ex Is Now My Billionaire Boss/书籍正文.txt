###Chapter 1

"Are you nervous to see me?"

Anna Ross stared at the figure in the black suit approaching her, her back ramrod straight.

She never expected to run into her ex, Adrian Sinclair, at the family dinner hotel arranged by her stepfather.

"You—"

She instinctively stepped back, but before she could finish, he had already seized her wrist, slamming her against the cold tiles of the restroom wall.

"Three years apart, and you can worm your way into an event like this? Anna Ross, I underestimated you."

His warm breath brushed her cheek. Adrian looked lazy, but his eyes held a frosty chill. "Who's your sponsor now? Do tell."

"I don't have one!"

Her eyelashes fluttered as she denied it vehemently. Adrian abruptly tightened his grip around her waist.

He lowered his head, biting the soft skin of her neck, his voice low and dangerous. "Why pretend with me? I know exactly what you're like."

Pain spread from her neck. Humiliated and furious, Anna struggled desperately to break free, but she feared her family in the private room next door would notice the commotion.

She could only hiss in a low voice, though it trembled badly. "Let go! Are you insane?"

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted. Noticing her panicked glances toward the door, he increased the pressure of his hold. The platinum ring set with a sapphire on his finger swayed slightly.

So afraid of being seen?

What kind of man is she with now?

Remembering her resolute breakup three years ago, and recalling how he had just seen her step out of a Mercedes-Benz behind a portly, older man, a dark fury surged in his eyes. His hand abruptly pushed up her skirt.

"Serving an old man is worse than being with me. I'll double whatever he pays you."

His fingers pressed against her inner thigh. The cold gemstone made her shudder. "Or do you prefer older men?"

"Shut up!"

Anna's chest heaved. She raised her hand and slapped him hard across the face.

After all these years, this man's words were still so vicious and cruel! Absolutely hopeless!

The crisp sound of the slap echoed. His handsome, arrogant face reddened instantly.

Adrian's eyes darkened. He pressed his tongue against his cheek, his fingers suddenly clenching.

"You're willing to latch onto an old man for money, but you play the innocent with me?"

He pinned her wrist with one hand, bending to press her against the sink. He bit her lip harshly, his large hand moving directly toward her waist.

Anna fought back frantically, but it was useless.

The butler had said the family dinner was about to start when he picked her up. If she didn't appear soon, the Lowell family would come looking. If they saw this scene, how could she and her mother ever face them?!

Her eyes reddened, but she didn't dare cry out for help. She could only press her knee against him, trying to stop his advance.

But his hand had already slipped under her skirt...

"Don't!"

Tears rolled down Anna's cheeks. She bit her lip until it bled. Adrian watched with mockery in his eyes, his fingers hooking onto the flimsy fabric, ready to tear it away.

Her heart turned to ash. Suddenly, a phone rang.

The man glanced at the caller ID on the screen. His eyes turned cold. He finally released her and turned to answer the call.

She couldn't hear what was said, but Anna clearly felt the chilling aura around him intensify. He let out a cold laugh and responded indifferently. "Right away."

Hanging up, he gave her a deep look before turning and leaving.

Shaken, Anna hurriedly straightened her clothes.

Her phone vibrated on the vanity. She composed herself and answered. Her mother's dissatisfied voice came through. "Where are you? The butler said he picked you up ages ago. Does it take half an hour to fix your makeup? All your father's relatives are here, waiting just for you. Is this appropriate?"

Anna cursed Adrian a thousand times in her heart. "I'm coming now."

After hanging up, she confirmed she looked presentable and walked into the adjacent private room with feigned composure.

But when she saw the figure next to her stepfather, her heart clenched violently!

Adrian Sinclair sat at the head of the table, his expression indifferent, leisurely wiping his fingers with a napkin. Though casual, he exuded the noble air of someone in power.

Why was he here?!

"Anna's here? Let me introduce you, sweetheart."

Her stepfather, Howard Lowell, smiled insincerely and waved her closer. "This is your eldest cousin, Adrian Sinclair. Coincidentally, you both attended Stanford. He was two years ahead of you."

Then he looked at Adrian, piling on a fake smile. "Adrian, you're close in age. Get to know each other better in the future."

Anna kept her head down, not daring to look up. She felt the man's gaze on her, cold and piercing.

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted. His eyes swept over her and Howard, a hint of a mocking smile playing on his lips. "Oh? So this is the little cousin brought by the new wife my uncle just married?"

He rubbed the sapphire on his ring, his tone meaningful. "And my alumni... What a remarkable coincidence."

Anna's pupils constricted.

Adrian Sinclair was the ruthless, merciless eldest nephew her stepfather had spoken of?

She knew the Lowell family was powerful. Howard was the only son of the family patriarch, with two younger sisters.

But the current acting CEO of Lowell Enterprises was Howard's eldest nephew.

The patriarch believed his son was useless and his daughters only knew how to enjoy themselves. He originally wanted to assess the grandchildren, but Howard was diagnosed with a low sperm count. Neither of his wives had borne children.

The hope of inheriting the family business fell on the outstanding grandson from a young age.

Naturally, Howard was unwilling. He secretly obstructed his nephew while trying every possible way to have an heir.

Otherwise, her mother couldn't have married into the Lowell family while pregnant, bringing her, the extra baggage, along.

Their eyes met. Anna looked into his icy gaze, clenched the hem of her dress, and lowered her head further.

Howard didn't suspect anything, only thinking his timid stepdaughter was embarrassingly inept. He frowned slightly.

"What's wrong with you? Your father is introducing family, and you don't even say hello?"

Seeing the tense atmosphere, Vivian Lowell hurried forward to smooth things over, protectively cradling her slightly swollen belly. She linked arms with Howard and grabbed Anna's hand, pinching her wrist covertly. She smiled at Adrian.

"Adrian, Howard often praises how capable you are. Anna is just shy. Please be understanding."

Adrian withdrew his gaze and gave a slight nod, his expression unreadable. "It's nothing. You're too kind, Aunt Vivian."

Red marks already showed on Anna's wrist from her mother's pinching. She forced herself to calm down and mustered a well-behaved smile. "Hello, Cousin Adrian."

No one noticed the dark glint in Adrian's eyes.

His relationship with Howard had always been strained. Ever since the patriarch appointed him CEO, this uncle had repeatedly set obstacles, even once intending to kill him.

He'd heard earlier that Howard had married a young wife who brought along extra baggage, but he hadn't paid it any mind. If not for the patriarch's order, he would never have come here.

When he saw Anna, he thought she was here with an older man. He never expected... she was his uncle's stepdaughter.

"You're too polite, cousin."

The smile on his lips deepened, his voice tinged with amusement. "I didn't know your identity earlier. My apologies for the offense in the restroom."

Both Vivian and Howard were stunned. Had these two already met?

Remembering Anna's long delay in the restroom, Howard looked thoughtfully at them. "Oh? What happened in the restroom?"

Anna met Adrian's teasing gaze, and her heartbeat suddenly accelerated.
###Chapter 2

She spoke first.

"It's nothing serious."

"Cousin accidentally bumped into me."

"My dress got wet."

"That's why we were delayed."

Howard Lowell looked at Adrian Sinclair.

His eyes held suspicion.

"Oh?"

Anna Ross tightened her fingers.

Her dress was wrinkled from her grip.

Her heart raced nervously.

She wasn't sure if Adrian would cooperate.

He was always reckless.

And he hated her so much.

He might directly accuse her of seduction.

Then she and her mother would be kicked out of the Lowell family.

In the silence.

She heard Adrian chuckle softly.

"It was my carelessness."

"I'll have someone send a few new dresses to my cousin later."

"As an apology."

Howard felt it was a bit strange.

But he didn't think too deeply about it.

Anna took after her mother.

She was beautiful and alluring.

But his nephew had high standards.

He never had women around him.

He was recently dating a high society heiress.

How could he possibly be interested in this girl?

He didn't think further.

He smiled to smooth things over.

"We're all family."

"It's just a dress."

"We can buy another one later."

Anna breathed a sigh of relief.

She lowered her head to avoid his gaze.

She didn't dare look at Adrian.

The family dinner officially began.

Howard and Vivian were both remarried.

She entered the family while pregnant.

The Lowells cared about their reputation.

They didn't make a big fuss.

Adrian attended on behalf of Grandpa Lowell.

Anna sat beside her mother.

She ate quietly.

Adrian was right across from her.

Next to Howard.

She always felt his gaze on her.

It was terrifying.

She didn't even dare raise her head.

She only hoped the dinner would end soon.

Howard suddenly spoke with a smile.

"Anna."

"Don't be shy."

"Talk more with the relatives."

"Although you're not my biological daughter."

"I felt a connection with you the moment I saw you."

His tone was kind.

"Even after your mother gives birth to your brother."

"I won't treat you unfairly."

"I'll definitely treat you as my own."

Anna looked up.

Her spine stiff.

She forced an obedient smile.

"Thank you, Dad."

She didn't understand Howard's intention.

But she quickly figured it out.

Howard looked at Adrian.

"Adrian."

"Although you're from the Sinclair family."

"You're also the eldest brother in this family."

"You'll need to take care of your younger siblings in the future."

"After your cousin is born."

"I'll need you to help him take over the Lowell family business."

"We can't let outsiders take advantage."

The dinner atmosphere instantly became awkward.

His words were entrusting.

But they mocked Adrian as an outsider.

Even if he was in power now.

He would have to return the Lowell Group to his son eventually.

Adrian paused the knife in his hand.

His thumb rubbed his index finger.

No emotion showed on his face.

But Anna knew.

He was angry.

"Uncle is indeed as Grandpa said."

"Magnanimous and tolerant."

"It's truly rare to be so accepting of a stepdaughter."

He wiped the corner of his mouth with a napkin.

He spoke with a smile.

"But Uncle has had no children for so long."

"The family finally has a younger generation."

"It's normal to be happy."

"If Aunt could add a considerate little darling."

"That would be a true blessing."

"If it's a little cousin."

"I will naturally nurture him well."

"With the same dedication Grandpa had for Uncle."

"To make him become exactly like Uncle."

These words sounded fine.

But they made Howard's face tremble with anger.

This damned brat.

Was still so sharp-tongued.

Indirectly mocking him for not being able to have children.

Now he only had a stepdaughter.

And cursing him to have a daughter.

Even saying that having a son would be useless.

He trembled with anger.

But couldn't find fault.

He forced a stiff smile.

"Thank you for your kind words, Adrian."

Anna couldn't help but want to laugh.

She held it back.

Adrian was the first debater on Stanford's debate team.

Outwardly gentle and aloof.

His mouth was cutting and vicious.

A casually spoken sentence.

Could stab someone right in the heart.

The guests saw the tense atmosphere.

They quickly tried to smooth things over.

"President Lowell is having a child in his later years."

"The young master must be intelligent."

"Speaking of which."

"Mr. Sinclair is also twenty-five."

"Grandpa Sinclair has been arranging blind dates recently."

"Any plans to marry?"

Adrian looked up.

He glanced at Anna unintentionally.

He casually adjusted his cuff.

"Perhaps soon."

"I'll invite Uncle's family to honor us with your presence at the wedding."

He smiled at Anna.

The curve of his lips held an inexplicable meaning.

"Cousin hasn't been back to New York for a long time, right?"

"You must come then."

"Let me play host."

His tone was gentle and noble.

Like polite conversation between relatives.

But Anna heard a hint of mischief.

She clenched her palms.

She responded stiffly.

"Okay, Cousin."

The family dinner continued.

是 harmonious and joyful.

But the atmosphere was uncomfortable.

After it ended.

Anna excused herself to return to the company.

She wanted to leave quickly.

Adrian suddenly spoke.

"Cousin is returning to the company."

"We're going the same way."

"Take my car."

Same way?

Anna didn't know what way that was.

She instinctively felt he was up to something again.

She declined politely.

"No need to trouble Cousin."

"I'll take a taxi."

Adrian stood with his back to everyone.

His tall frame blocked her.

His tone was gentle.

But his eyes held mockery.

"Of course it's the same way."

"Grandpa asked me to check on the branch's operations."

"I heard Cousin just joined the company."

"Please give me an introduction later."

Anna couldn't find words to refuse.

Howard was incompetent.

But he was Grandpa Lowell's only son.

The Lowell Group couldn't be handed to him.

He could only manage the San Francisco branch.

Adrian was the CEO of the Lowell Group.

Inspecting the branch was not a problem.

But she didn't want to have anything to do with him.

A flash of panic crossed Howard's eyes.

He coughed.

"Then Adrian can take Anna."

"Anna."

"Show your cousin around San Francisco."

He separated the two.

He gave Anna a meaningful look.

He took her aside under pretext.

His tone was cold.

"When Adrian inspects later."

"Keep a close eye on him."

"Don't say anything unnecessary."

"I'll arrange for someone to handle it."

"Understood?"

"That little bastard can't stand to see me do well."

"If he finds any leverage."

"You and your mother won't have it easy either."

Anna lowered her head.

She responded obediently.

"I understand."

"Dad."

Howard nodded with satisfaction.

He let her leave with Adrian.

The man held the car door open politely.

Every movement was noble and gentle.

Anna got in the car.

She was nervous inside.

Worried he would cause trouble again.

Adrian remained silent the whole way.

He drove properly to the company.

Anna breathed a sigh of relief.

She took him upstairs.

"Mr. Sinclair, please look around yourself."

"I have work to attend to."

"I won't keep you company."

"The vice president will bring the quarterly report later."

She turned to leave.

Her wrist was grabbed by the man.

Adrian pulled her into his arms.

He locked the meeting room door.

He gripped her chin.

He smiled faintly.

His thin lips curved with mockery.

"Your father asked you to accompany me."

"Abandoning me like this."

"Aren't you afraid you can't explain?"

Feeling the warmth of his palm.

Anna realized something was wrong.

"Are you crazy?"

"This is the company!"

Adrian curled his lips.

He increased his grip.

Pulling her closer.

"Why are you nervous?"

"Is there a problem with the company?"

"Or do you think it's less exciting than the restroom?"

He pressed her against the door.

His palm stroked her neck.

"That old fool Howard."

"Would love for you to have a connection with me."

"A bait delivered to my doorstep."

"Wouldn't it be disrespectful not to bite?"

Anna's pupils contracted.

The hand on her neck tightened.

Adrian forced her to look up.

He bit her lip.

His palm pressed her wrist.

Trapping her between his arms.

"You're insane..."

The taste of blood spread.

Anna frowned in pain.

She instinctively bit back at his cool thin lips.
###Chapter 3

Adrian Sinclair tightened his grip.

He pulled her toward the sofa.

Leaning in close.

"Three years apart."

"You've grown quite a temper."

His palm pressed against her waist.

Rubbing through the fabric of her dress.

Anna Ross's breath hitched.

Her lips were sealed by his.

His hand wandered over her body.

Fingertips burning with heat.

"You curse so fiercely."

"Yet your body tells a different story."

"These three years."

"Did no man satisfy you?"

Anna's cheeks burned.

The meeting room felt suffocating.

A fine sweat dampened her back.

Her voice trembled.

"What do you want?"

"I'm your uncle's stepdaughter now!"

"How dare you—"

Adrian gave a low laugh.

His eyes darkened.

"A stepdaughter."

"Beyond my reach?"

"I don't even regard Howard Lowell."

"Much less you."

He nibbled her earlobe.

His hand moved toward her zipper.

"Just catching up."

"And settling our score from three years ago."

"Why resist?"

"In the past."

"You loved this the most."

The Ross family had fallen long ago.

The Sinclairs were New York's elite.

As the heir, Adrian had every right to arrogance.

But what did that have to do with her?

Three years ago, he was the one who spoke cruelly.

They had been broken up for years.

What gave him the right to seek revenge?

Anna raised her hand to strike.

He caught her wrist.

A sharp pain bloomed on her neck.

The zipper slowly descended...

Anna's eyes reddened.

Struggling was useless.

She bit her lip in despair.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Mr. Sinclair."

"I'm the vice president of the branch."

"Here to deliver documents."

"Are you available?"

Adrian paused.

Anna shoved him away.

She frantically adjusted her dress.

Her eyes blazed with fear and anger.

The man's lips curved.

His voice returned to cool detachment.

"Come in."

The vice president entered.

Meeting Adrian's icy gaze, he instinctively looked down.

"Mr. Sinclair."

He noticed Anna's disheveled state.

But didn't dare ask.

While the vice president reported, Anna quickly left.

She walked the streets for a long time.

When she finally gathered her thoughts, she stood outside the Lowell manor.

The night was deep.

Anxiety coiled in her chest.

If her stepfather learned she had left Adrian, he would take it out on her mother...

She hesitated.

Headlights suddenly flashed.

A black Maybach pulled up nearby.

Adrian stepped out.

Anna instinctively retreated.

He caught her wrist.

His voice was warm, almost amused.

"You've had a long day."

"Let me take you to dinner another time."

Anna froze.

The manor lights turned on.

The housekeeper greeted them with a smile.

"Miss Anna, Mr. Sinclair, you're back?"

"Madam and Mr. Lowell have been waiting."

Anna had no choice but to enter with him.

The living room was brightly lit.

Howard Lowell and her mother sat on the sofa.

Howard frowned.

"Why are you back so late?"

Anna's fingers trembled slightly.

Adrian calmly removed his coat.

"We visited the company."

"Then explored San Francisco."

"I was concerned for her safety alone."

"So I brought her home."

Howard relaxed.

He offered a false smile.

"Young people enjoy their fun."

"Thank you, Adrian."

"Stay the night."

"The housekeeper will prepare a guest room."

Anna's heart sank.

Adrian nodded in agreement.

He sat down comfortably.

"Grandpa wants me to meet Chloe Valentine."

"I may need to impose for a few days."

A flicker of suspicion crossed Howard's eyes.

But he couldn't refuse.

He instructed the housekeeper to prepare a room.

It happened to be right next to Anna's.

Anna paled.

Howard probed about company matters.

But Vivian Lowell watched her daughter.

Her eyes filled with alarm.

Distracted, Anna excused herself to go upstairs.

She was about to lock her door and wash up.

Her mother entered.

Vivian grabbed her hand.

Her voice shook.

"What happened with Mr. Sinclair?"

"What are those marks on your neck?"

Anna looked in the mirror.

A vivid love bite marred her neck.

Her heart turned cold.
###Chapter 4

"Oh, this..."

She quickly recovered, scratching the red mark nonchalantly. "I got bitten by a mosquito yesterday while accompanying Adrian on his walk."

"Is there a problem, Mother?"

Vivian Lowell stared intently into her daughter's eyes, finding nothing unusual, and finally relaxed a little.

"You should keep your distance from Adrian Sinclair."

She closed the door, lowering her voice. "Your uncle said that man appears gentle and noble on the surface, but he's ruthless and merciless at his core."

"The Sinclair family wasn't considered top-tier in New York originally. But since Adrian took over Sinclair Corp, he now dominates everything."

"The old master favors his decisiveness and intends to hand over the Lowell Corporation to him as well."

"He dares to use any means in business. A young girl like you is nothing but a blank page in his eyes!"

"Besides, he's now your nominal cousin. Don't you dare entertain any improper thoughts!"

Anna Ross lowered her eyes, answering obediently. "I know, Mom. If it weren't for... Dad's arrangements, I wouldn't have gone out with him either."

Vivian finally felt reassured and left after a few more words of advice.

Anna watched her mother leave, her nails digging deeply into her palms.

She couldn't afford to entangle with Adrian any longer.

Even if their breakup three years ago was unpleasant, he was now her cousin!

Neither the Sinclair nor the Lowell families would ever accept her. Moreover, Adrian's current behavior was clearly just to humiliate her!

If he was going to stay at the Lowell residence, then she had to leave...

After a moment's thought, Anna dialed her best friend's number. "Mia, are you still working in real estate? Can you help me find a suitable apartment? I want to move out as soon as possible..."

Unaware, footsteps approached outside her door. A man in a black suit stopped at her doorway, his gaze cold and gloomy.

By the time Anna finished her shower, it was already 1 a.m.

Drying her hair, she picked up her phone. The screen lit up with a text message from a number that hadn't appeared in a long time.

[S: Come to the room next door.]

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

It was all her fault for being soft-hearted back then... She hadn't had the heart to block him when they broke up!

She ignored the message and directly dragged the number into her block list.

But soon, her phone buzzed with an AirDrop notification.

Hesitating for a moment, she opened the image. A photo filled the screen.

In the picture, she lay on a sofa, her neck and ears flushed red.

A slender hand rested on her leg, the thumb adorned with a sapphire ring. It was Adrian's hand!

Anna's pupils constricted sharply.

When did he take such a photo?!

Trembling, she gripped her phone tightly, threw on a coat, and hurried out of her room.

The door to the adjacent room was slightly ajar. The manor was silent, only warm yellow light spilling from within.

Clenching her teeth, Anna pushed the door open.

Adrian had just emerged from the bath. His wet hair fell across his forehead, a towel wrapped around his waist. His broad shoulders and narrow waist were strikingly apparent, the usual sharpness softened, replaced by a lazy elegance.

Those eight-pack abs were still dripping water, enough to make anyone's heart race and cheeks flush.

"We're at home! Even if you disregard Uncle, do you not care about Grandpa Lowell at all?!"

Anna kept her voice low, demanding, "Adrian Sinclair, what exactly do you want? Aren't you going on blind dates? Why won't you let me go?"

A faint smile touched Adrian's lips. He reached out and pulled her into his embrace.

Anna struggled fiercely, but he restrained her, and they tumbled into the swimming pool.

Water flooded her nose and mouth, sending her into a fit of violent coughing.

Suddenly, her chin was gripped. Adrian kissed her lips forcefully.

"I want to sleep with you."

Her freshly changed clothes were soaked through, clinging to her body and outlining her alluring curves. Adrian's lips and teeth trailed downward, from her jaw to her neck, then biting open the strap behind her neck.

Dazed from the water, Anna leaned weakly against his chest.

"You think moving out will let you escape?"

Adrian nibbled on her earlobe, his voice lazy yet full of threat. "Once you leave the Lowell family, what do you think will hold me back?"

Anna's heart tightened.

Had he overheard her phone call with Mia?

Her heart sank bit by bit. She looked up at him, eyes red. "Then what do you want me to do? Isn't it enough that I won't stay here to be an eyesore? Mom already noticed. Do you have to push me to death to be satisfied?"

A mocking smile played on Adrian's lips. He increased his pressure, making her cry out in pain.

"Oh? She knows? Doesn't that make it more exciting?"

He released his bite, twirling her reddened earlobe carelessly. "If something like this happens, would your mother dare tell Howard Lowell? Tell him his stepdaughter seduced his nephew?"

Then, he added sarcastically, "Perhaps this is Howard Lowell's plan all along. If something happens between us, angering the old master, won't the Lowell Corporation fall into his hands?"

"By then, he might even thank you, his good daughter."

Anna's fingertips turned white, all color draining from her face.

Adrian was the old master's most favored grandson. Any family scandal would only be covered up for his sake.

And she, the stepdaughter, would only become the scapegoat, ruined and thrown out of the Lowell family!

Seeing her cease resistance, a flicker of disgust passed through Adrian's eyes. He stood up, pulled her from the pool, and threw her onto the floor.

"Weren't you so skilled at seducing men three years ago? Now you're stiff as a board?"

He looked down at her, playing with his ring mockingly. "Do you think being a Lowell stepdaughter makes you a千金小姐? Have you forgotten your old tricks?"

Anna's lips trembled. Watching him snort derisively, sit by the window, and light a cigarette, she shakily climbed up from the floor and fled through the door.

Adrian didn't follow.

Relieved, she ran back to her room to change, but sleep eluded her for a long time.

Early the next morning, after much hesitation, she went upstairs toward her mother's room.

Before she could knock, she heard a pained cry from inside.

Her heart clenched. She pushed the door open in a panic.

She saw her stepfather grabbing her mother's hair, slapping her hard across the face.

Blood trickled from the corner of her mother's mouth and nose, her eyes filled with terror and helplessness.

A chill ran down Anna's spine. Her eyes widened in fury!

She rushed forward, trying to pull her stepfather away. "Let go! Mom is pregnant with your child! How can you hit her?!"

"Get away from me! Damn liar! How dare you deceive me!"

Howard Lowell's eyes were bloodshot, like a mad bull. He shoved her away. "Pregnant? I've been fooled by this damned pillow... Vivian Lowell, you are utterly shameless and would stop at nothing!"

"Return all the bride price I gave when I married you! We're getting a divorce now! Or else you'll regret it!"

Disbelief flashed in Anna's eyes.

Her mother faked the pregnancy...?
###Chapter 5

Howard Lowell shot to his feet.

Anna Ross threw herself over her mother, shielding her.
Her voice trembled. "Mom, give him the money back. Let's just go."
She didn't want to stay here.
She wanted nothing more to do with Adrian Sinclair.

But Vivian Lowell clamped a hand over her daughter's mouth.
Her mother scrambled on her knees to Howard's feet. "Howard, I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied. Please, don't throw us out!"
"You bitch! You dare beg for mercy?"
Howard's chest heaved. He raised his foot to kick her.

Anna's knuckles turned white.
She tried to pull her mother up, but Vivian shoved her away.
"Howard, a divorce right after our marriage will hurt the company. How will you explain it to the old man?"
Vivian wiped the blood from her face, clutching his pant leg. "I had no other choice. I got sick three years ago, the debt was crushing. They were going to sell Anna if I didn't pay!"
"Think of how long she's called you Dad. Please, forgive us this once? I'll give you a son, I promise!"

Anna's arms shook.
So that was why her mother had married Howard.
Three years ago, her mother needed a kidney transplant.
The cost was astronomical.
She had scrambled for money, but it wasn't enough.
In desperation, she'd taken a loan from a loan shark.
For three years, Anna worked herself ragged to pay it back.
Then her mother suddenly met Howard and married into the Lowell family.
Anna had been happy for her, never intending to rely on the Lowells.
She never knew her mother married to settle the debt.

Howard stared at Anna, weighing his options.
After a long silence, his voice was cold. "You can stay. But I don't keep idle people around."
He kicked Vivian aside and walked over to Anna. "You and Adrian Sinclair get along well?"
At the mention of Adrian, Anna's heart clenched. She looked down. "No."
Howard rubbed his chin, thoughtful. "That boy never has women around. He invited you to the company himself. Even went shopping with you. That's rare for him."
"He has a blind date tonight at The Royal Lounge with the Valentine heiress. Hmph... The Sinclair old man wants him to establish himself in San Francisco and swallow up the Lowell family. I won't let him succeed."
"You will ruin that date. Do something. Make him do something to you, get evidence. I'll clear your mother's debt."

Anna's fingers twitched. She looked up, disbelief written on her face.

。。。。。。

Late at night, The Royal Lounge was unusually quiet.
Anna was led in through the staff entrance by the butler, her palms slick with cold sweat.
Beneath her black coat, she wore only a thong and a bra that left little to the imagination.
The butler took her to a private room, shoved a packet of powder into her hand, and left.
Anna sat on the sofa, her mind in turmoil.
She didn't want to be here, but her mother had begged her through tears.
Was she really going to drug him...?

As she wrestled with the decision, footsteps sounded outside the door.
Anna's heart seized. Instinctively, she hid in the attached restroom.
In her panic, the packet of powder fell onto the sofa.
Adrian Sinclair pushed the door open. The clean scent of orchids followed him in.
He paused, his eyes scanning the room and landing on the paper packet on the sofa. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.
He picked it up, his voice icy as he summoned a waiter. "Bring me your strongest whiskey."

Anna bit her lip, hidden in the wardrobe, praying he would leave quickly.
Instead, she heard the door click shut.
Footsteps drew nearer.
The wardrobe door was yanked open, revealing Adrian's cold, handsome face.
A chill ran down her spine.
"Here to join my blind date?"
A smile played on his lips, but his eyes were frozen. He gripped her neck and dragged her out. "You came all this way. Why hide? What were you planning?"
Adrian held up the powder. "This looks interesting. Tell me, what's it for?"
Anna trembled, speechless.
Adrian gave a silent, cold laugh. He poured the powder into a glass of whiskey, pinched her jaw, and forced it into her mouth.
"Not talking? Then I'll see for myself what it does."
Anna's pupils contracted. "No! I didn't want this! It was How—"
He gave her no chance to explain. He tightened his grip on her jaw and forced the liquor down her throat.
The strong alcohol burned. She choked and coughed, her head instantly growing foggy.
The drug, mixed with the whiskey, took effect fast. She stumbled against the wardrobe, fighting to stay conscious, desperate to escape.
Adrian threw her onto the bed and slowly removed his jacket.
"I don't know what this does yet. Why are you running?"
He leaned over her, then suddenly stopped.
Noticing what she wore underneath, his eyes turned to ice. "Not a fan of home, but you dress like this for a bar? Anna Ross, you're as self-destructive and shameless as you were three years ago!"
He tugged at the thin strings, a storm of brutality raging in his gaze.
Three years ago... What happened then?
Anna's consciousness blurred. She instinctively curled her legs, trying to struggle.
Her ankle was caught in a firm, long-fingered grip. Adrian bit down hard on her lip.
"Since you're offering, I'll oblige."
The drug spread. Pain and pleasure twisted together. Anna couldn't suppress a soft, shameful moan.
Adrian's hand moved up from her ankle, gripping her thigh tightly. He savaged her lips with his teeth.
The taste of blood filled her mouth. She whimpered, pleading. "Please... stop... let me go..."
"You delivered yourself to me. How can I let you go?"
Adrian's lips curled in a sneer. "Knew I had a date with Miss Valentine today? Came specifically to seduce me? Think it's more exciting in front of my fiancée?"
He increased his force, his mouth moving down from her jaw to her neck, leaving a trail of red marks.
Anna wanted to resist, but her body was betraying her, yielding to instinct.
Then, a knock came at the door.
A sweet, coquettish voice called out. "Adrian? Are you in there?"
###Chapter 6

Anna Ross trembled.

Fear drenched her like ice water.

If anyone saw this scene…

She couldn't bear to think further.

Her panicked eyes locked onto the cold face above her.

She prayed desperately for him to stop.

Adrian Sinclair frowned, annoyed by the interruption.

He suddenly gripped Anna's chin.

His fingers pressed with painful force.

"You say…" His voice was low and amused. "If she pushes the door open and sees us like this…"

Anna's vision darkened.

She pushed against him, legs kicking wildly.

The more she struggled, the tighter his grip became.

His long fingers clamped around her wrists like iron.

"Having an affair right in front of my fiancée…" He let out a cold laugh. "So this is what you're into."

The pain in her chest cut deeper than any physical torment.

Tears slid silently down her cheeks.

She fought with all her strength.

But the alcohol had weakened her.

Her fingers could only scratch weakly down his back.

The knocking at the door sounded again.

A sweet female voice pierced through the wood. "Adrian? Open up! It's me!"

Anna stared at the door in terror.

Her body shook uncontrollably.

Adrian was about to continue.

The persistent knocking finally irritated him.

He paused, studying the woman beneath him.

"Wait." He threw out the two words.

He jumped off the bed, wearing only a towel.

He opened the door just enough, blocking the gap with his body.

Chloe Valentine saw Adrian clad only in a towel.

Her heart leaped with joy, though she feigned shyness.

She looked down, speaking softly. "Adrian… so eager?" "Let's go inside and talk."

She thought this was a surprise he had prepared.

She resolved to secure this man.

She tried to push past him to enter.

Anna grabbed the sheets, wrapping them tightly around herself.

Adrian glanced back at the trembling figure on the bed.

A wicked smile touched his lips.

Anna was on the verge of tears.

He suddenly took Chloe's hand.

He paused, then issued a roguish command. "Chloe, go buy some more drinks for me."

Chloe had been puzzled by his blocking.

Hearing his request, she immediately understood.

A blush spread across her pretty face.

"Of course! I'll go right now!" She replied sweetly. "Wait for me~"

Adrian nodded.

Chloe left satisfied, her high heels clicking away.

Anna let out a long breath.

Ignoring her pounding headache, she grabbed her clothes and dressed hurriedly.

She had to leave immediately.

Her phone vibrated.

A message notification from her mother flashed.

Her hands shook as she opened it.

The contents plunged her into an ice-cold abyss.

[Mom: Anna, our lives are in your hands. Your stepfather says if you can't ruin Adrian's meeting with Miss Valentine, we'll be handed over to the loan sharks.]

Anna turned ice-cold.

Her fingertips pressed white.

Was there truly no escape?

Her phone vibrated again.

[Mom: Anna, I'm begging you. You must succeed. I'm so sorry!]

Tears blurred her vision.

The warm yellow light fell on her pale face.

Anna finally sighed.

Trading herself for her mother's life.

It was worth it.

Adrian walked closer.

His gaze remained fixed on her.

The bed dipped slightly as he sat on the edge.

He crossed his long legs.

Anna thought he would continue and instinctively shrank back.

But the man made no move.

He simply toyed with his platinum signet ring.

His deep eyes swept over her tear-stained cheeks.

"Stop pretending to be the victim." He sneered. "Dressing like this and drugging yourself… wasn't it all to please me?"

Each word pierced her heart.

Her自尊 was crushed to dust.

Thinking of her mother, Anna bit her lower lip.

She spoke with difficulty. "What are you planning… with Miss Valentine later?"

Her small hands clenched, knuckles white.

She wished she could disappear into the ground.

Adrian's eyebrow lifted slightly.

He gave her a scornful look. "Isn't it a bit late to care about that now?"

Her motives were disgustingly obvious.

Anna's heart tightened.

Meeting his disgusted gaze, she quickly looked down. "I just…"

"Enough!" He cut her off sharply.

He turned away, heading straight for the walk-in closet.

Anna sat frozen on the bed.

His sudden anger frightened her.

After a moment, she remembered her mission today—to stop him from meeting Chloe Valentine!

Adrian emerged dressed in a suit.

The black suit accentuated his handsome, noble features.

He looked like an untouchable deity.

He ignored the woman on the bed and left through the door.

Anna's heart sank.

He was going to find Chloe!

She hurriedly put on her shoes and followed.

She trailed him quietly.

She saw a pair of slender hands link through his arm.

He leaned down to whisper, and the woman laughed joyfully.

Chloe stood on her toes and planted a kiss on his cheek.

Adrian did not refuse.

Anna turned her face away.

She couldn't bear to watch the painful scene.

Her fingers twisted tightly in her clothes.

She turned to flee.

Her phone vibrated again.

Reality forced her to look.

[Mom: Anna, you must succeed tonight. I'm counting on you. Your stepfather threatened that if you fail, not only will we be handed to the loan sharks, but our reputations will be ruined. We won't be able to stay in New York!]

Each word cut like a knife.

Anna leaned weakly against the cold wall.
###Chapter 7

"Mom, I won't let anything happen to you!"

Anna Ross bit her lip hard.

She had to find a way to get inside.

A woman in a black bunny costume walked past.

Anna steeled herself and reached out to stop her.

The woman looked at her curiously. "Yes?"

Anna's lips were bitten until they bled.

She spoke with difficulty. "Can I buy your costume from you?"

She had worn more revealing clothes before. This was nothing.

The bunny girl scoffed. "Why should I give it to you? You're crazy."

She shook off Anna's hand and avoided her like the plague.

Anna pulled out her phone. "I'll pay. Name your price."

The woman's eyes lit up.

She quickly showed her payment QR code. "You should have said so earlier! Five hundred!"

Anna transferred the money in silence.

The bunny girl beamed and pulled her into the restroom.

Adrian Sinclair lounged on the sofa.

The light outlined his cold, sharp profile.

Chloe Valentine swayed over and pressed against him.

Her fingers traced circles on his suit. "Adrian, it's so noisy here. Let's go back to my room?"

Her red lips pouted as she leaned closer.

Adrian frowned and avoided her strong perfume.

His voice was cold. "What's the hurry?"

Chloe was persistent.

She stood up and pulled him. "Let's go to a private room. I have something to tell you."

She was determined to succeed tonight. She wouldn't let go.

Adrian was about to push her away when a burst of whistles from the dance floor caught his attention.

Chloe also looked over, momentarily forgetting her actions.

In the center of the stage, a bunny girl wearing a lace mask made her entrance.

Her fair skin looked even more tempting against the black fabric.

The bodice barely contained her full curves.

Her legs were long and straight under the short skirt.

The mask covered half her face, adding mystery that made hearts itch.

The men in the audience stared with wide eyes, whistling madly.

Adrian's eyes turned cold.

His fingers tightened around his glass. "Anna Ross, you've got some nerve!"

Chloe didn't hear him clearly, but she felt a sudden chill.

Anna stood on stage, enduring the shame.

The fabric was pitifully scarce.

She scanned the crowd nervously but didn't see Adrian.

She had to take the gamble.

She swayed her hips to the music.

The crowd cheered even louder.

Anna's heart pounded like a drum.

She prayed nothing would go wrong.

As she danced, she felt her dignity being completely crushed.

Suddenly, a fat man rushed onto the stage and danced close to her.

Anna wanted to run.

But she remembered the image of her mother vomiting blood.

She gritted her teeth and kept dancing.

The man's sweat made her nauseous.

His greasy hands touched her waist.

Anna glared at him and moved forward to avoid him.

The man was provoked and pressed closer.

The crowd roared. "Get her!"

The man leered and reached for her chest.

Anna stumbled back in panic.

She missed a step and fell off the stage.

She closed her eyes and braced for impact.

But the expected pain never came.

She landed in a solid embrace.

A familiar scent washed over her.

She opened her eyes and met Adrian's furious gaze.

Her breath caught.

Adrian helped her stand.

He strode onto the stage.

The fat man was about to complain.

But he recognized Adrian and immediately fawned. "Mr. Sinclair!"

Adrian's eyes were dark. "You think you can touch her?"

Before anyone could react, he kicked the man hard between the legs.

The fat man screamed and fell to the ground, writhing in pain.

The entire room fell silent.

Adrian's leather shoe stepped on the man's face, leaving a bright red mark.

His gaze swept toward Anna.

Even with the mask, she couldn't hide.

He had recognized her.

Adrian grabbed Anna's wrist.

He pulled her away roughly.

The crowd automatically parted.

Chloe watched as Adrian left with the strange woman.

She smashed her glass in anger.

"Adrian! Where are you going!"

No one answered.
###Chapter 8

The noise of the dance floor faded behind them.

Adrian Sinclair's grip was unyielding.

He dragged Anna Ross down the long hallway.

Cold wind bit through her thin clothes.

She shivered uncontrollably.

They walked in complete silence.

Anna stole glances at his tense profile.

Her right hand clenched secretly.

There was no escaping this time.

She had brought this upon herself.

Why did she have to dress like this to provoke him?

How pathetic.

She reached up and tore off the bunny ear headband.

She wiped the bright lipstick from her mouth.

Her hair was a mess from being grabbed.

She hugged her chest tightly.

Trying to hide the provocative outfit.

Adrian noticed her movements.

He only let out a cold, mocking laugh.

Servants bowed and greeted them along the way.

Anna tried to shrink behind him.

Wishing she could disappear.

She expected to be dragged into a room.

Instead, he suddenly shoved her toward the main entrance.

Anna fell hard onto the cold tiles.

The pain jolted her awake.

Adrian adjusted his cuffs as he looked down at her.

His eyes held pure contempt.

"Get out of here."

"Stop being a nuisance."

He turned to leave.

Anna tried to stand.

A sharp pain shot through her ankle.

She looked down.

Her fair skin was already swollen and red.

A passing server rushed over.

"Miss, do you need help?"

His Adam's apple bobbed as he glanced at her curves.

He quickly looked away.

The commotion made Adrian turn back.

He narrowed his eyes at the scene.

His expression was unreadable.

The server tried to help her up.

Anna cried out in pain.

"Sprained ankle?"

"Let me call a cab to the hospital."

Adrian suddenly strode back.

"What an act."

"Is this your way of seducing men?"

A taxi arrived quickly.

The server moved to assist her.

But Adrian pushed him aside.

He yanked Anna up roughly.

Dragging her toward his own car.

Anna stumbled after him.

Her vision filled with his cold, hard profile.

His lips were pressed into a tight line.

He was clearly furious.

He shoved her into the passenger seat.

She breathed a silent sigh of relief.

It was humiliating.

But at least she had ruined his date.

Her mother should be safe now.

Yet overwhelming self-disgust followed.

She refused his demands.

Yet dressed like this to cause trouble.

He must think her utterly ridiculous.

Adrian suddenly leaned in close.

"Anna Ross."

"Is this all you've got?"

His eyes looked at her like she was a virus.

Full of disgust.

Anna's throat tightened.

She couldn't speak.

He sneered and released her.

"Stop pretending to be pitiful."

"It makes me sick."

Anna whispered her reply.

"Okay."

She didn't care what he thought anymore.

She painfully moved toward the car door.

The agony in her ankle nearly made her fall.

Adrian watched coldly.

Not offering any help.

She finally got into the car.

The door slammed shut behind her.

Adrian started the engine.

His gaze was icy and detached.

Anna clenched her fingers.

Summoning her courage to speak.

"Can you take me back to the Lowell family?"

He glanced at her.

His eyes still indifferent.

Anna expected sarcasm.

She bowed her head silently.

But he drove out of the parking lot without a word.

Dead silence filled the car.

Anna held her phone tightly.

Only worried about her mother's safety.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

Chloe Valentine's name lit up the screen.

Anna's heart ached.

If she hadn't interrupted.

They would be on a sweet date right now.

Adrian glanced at the caller.

He ignored it completely.

Anna was surprised.

But she didn't dare ask.

The phone rang insistently throughout the drive.

The car moved fast.

Soon stopping outside the Lowell mansion.

Adrian's voice was cold.

"Get out."

Anna looked at the brightly lit house.

Wondering if her mother was safe.

She eagerly pushed the door open.

Forgetting her injured foot.

She fell to the ground again.

Adrian frowned deeply.

He got out and hauled her up.

Dragging her roughly toward the entrance.

Not caring if he hurt her.

Anna tried to break free.

But she was no match for his strength.

She thought he would drag her into the living room.

But he suddenly stopped at the steps.

Adrian stared at her intently.

His voice dripping with coldness.

"Anna Ross."

"Pull another stunt like this."

"And next time, I won't go easy on you."
###Chapter 9

Anna could feel the dangerous aura radiating from him.

She knew.

He wasn't joking.

She pressed her lips together.

Her gaze avoided his.

"Alright…"

She understood.

She had thoroughly angered him today.

After this.

They should have no further interactions.

Adrian released her hand.

His face showed no emotion.

Soon.

The sound of an engine starting came from behind.

Anna breathed a sigh of relief.

She then remembered her mother was still waiting for her.

Ignoring the pain in her ankle.

She hurried home.

In the living room.

Howard was lazily sprawled on the sofa smoking.

Cigarette butts littered the floor.

The pungent smell of smoke filled the entire space.

Anna frowned and covered her nose.

She paid it no mind.

She quickly searched every corner.

Her heart sank.

She rushed over to Howard.

"Where is my mother!?"

Howard stopped smoking.

He looked her up and down.

He didn't answer.

Anna had no patience for his stare.

She pressed urgently, "I asked you where my mother is!?"

Seeing he still wouldn't answer.

Her heart kept sinking.

Fear spread through her entire body.

Howard suddenly sneered.

"You're just like your mother.

You'll do anything to seduce a man!"

Anna knew.

He was blaming her mother for pretending to be pregnant to marry him.

She was looked down upon because of it.

But the state she was in now.

Wasn't it all his doing?

She didn't want to hear these vile words.

She pointed to the door.

"I did what you asked.

I ruined Adrian and Miss Valentine's date.

He just drove me home.

Are you satisfied now?

Can you tell me where my mother is?"

Howard actually started clapping.

He laughed strangely. "Not bad.

Then let me ask you.

Did you get any evidence of what he did to you?"

Evidence?

Anna was speechless.

She had pushed herself to the limit tonight.

And he actually wanted evidence!

She couldn't hold back anymore.

She cried out in collapse, "Do you think Adrian is a fool?

With his power.

What evidence could I possibly get!?"

Adrian's disgusted expression lingered in her mind.

But she could overlook all that.

Her worry for her mother.

Consumed all her thoughts.

Howard's face darkened.

He took a hard drag of his cigarette.

"I just praised you for being smart.

Now it seems.

You're as stupid as your mother!"

Anna didn't want to waste more words.

It was clear Howard wouldn't tell her where her mother was.

"Fine.

You won't say.

I'll find her myself!"

She walked past Howard.

She searched every room.

But she couldn't find her mother anywhere.

Howard remainedcoldnessly on the sofa smoking.

He didn't even bother to look at her.

The house staff saw her running through the villa in revealing clothes.

They started gossiping.

"My goodness.

Dressed like that.

She has no shame!"

"Young girls these days.

It's unbelievable."

When she approached.

The staff immediately fell silent.

Anna stopped them to ask.

"Have you seen my mother?"

They shook their heads, indicating they didn't know.

Anna was too heartbroken to speak.

She had searched every room.

But Vivian was nowhere to be seen.

She suddenly thought of something.

She ran back desperately.

Her high heels were in the way.

She took them off and ran barefoot.

Finally.

On the balcony of her mother's bedroom.

She saw a familiar figure.

She hurriedly pulled open the glass door.

Tears fell the moment she saw Vivian's condition.

She could hardly believe her eyes.

"Mom.

Did Howard do all this?"

Vivian lay weakly on the ground.

An iron chain was locked around her foot.

Her ankle was already raw and bleeding.

She was covered in large and small wounds.

Some were still bleeding.

Others were bruises.

Vivian saw her daughter dressed like this.

Her heart ached.

"Anna, it's all my fault.

I'm useless.

I've hurt you!"

She held Anna and cried bitterly.

Anna didn't care about herself.

She just wanted to know why Howard would do this to her mother.

She had done exactly what he asked.

"Mom, wait for me.

I'll go ask him why!"

She had endured so much for so long.

But Howard had gone too far!

Vivian cried even harder.

She held onto her tightly.

"Don't go!

Let it be.

I'm fine.

Listen to me just this once, okay?

Anna."

She knew Howard's temper best.

If Anna went to confront him now.

It would be suicide.

Her daughter might get hurt too.

Anna was furious.

Howard treated her mother like an animal.

But seeing her injured mother so humble.

She couldn't bear to make her worry.

She turned and helped Vivian up.

She said softly, "I'll find the key to unlock you."

Entering the bedroom.

She saw the key on the large bed.

She gritted her teeth, picked it up.

And held it tightly in her hand.

After unlocking the chain.

Anna helped Vivian into the bedroom to lie down.

"Mom, I'll get the first aid kit to treat your wounds."

Vivian nodded.

Her gaze drifted downward.

She soon noticed Anna's swollen ankle.

Combined with what she was wearing.

Her heart jumped.

"Anna, you're hurt!?"

That glaring red mark.

Hurt her more than her own wounds.

Anna then remembered her own injury.

In her rush to find her mother.

She had forgotten she was hurt too.

But she still smiled to comfort Vivian.

"I'm fine.

I just twisted it by accident."

She took out the antiseptic to disinfect Vivian's wounds.

She blew gently to ease the pain.

Vivian watched her daughter's every move.

A wave of bitterness and guilt washed over her.

She reached out and stroked Anna's head.

"Anna, I need to apologize to you.

I've dragged you into this."

It was her fault.

For giving in to Howard's pressure to pay off debts.

And selling out her own daughter.

Anna remained silent.

Vivian hesitated for a moment.

She asked again, "Adrian…

He didn't do anything to you, did he?"
###Chapter 10

Anna Ross's hand froze mid-air.

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

She looked up at her mother.

Her voice was soft.

"Nothing."

"Nothing happened between us."

Vivian Lowell wanted to ask more.

Anna gently interrupted.

"Mom."

"Let's run away."

This life was too unbearable.

Adrian Sinclair's icy gaze.

Her stepfather's endless schemes.

Howard Lowell's abuse toward her mother.

Each burden pressed down until she could barely breathe.

Vivian paused.

She reached out to tidy Anna's stray hairs.

"Anna..."

"Why say that so suddenly?"

Anna forced her tears back.

She swallowed all her grievances.

Her mother had suffered enough.

She couldn't add to her troubles.

She held Vivian's hand.

Her eyes were determined.

"Mom."

"We can live well without Howard Lowell."

Her voice lightened slightly.

"The jewelry and money he gave you before."

"You saved it all, right?"

"It's enough for us to start over somewhere else."

Anywhere would do.

As long as they escaped this living hell.

Vivian nodded gently.

Howard had been generous early in their marriage.

Expensive jewelry.

Large sums of cash.

She had secretly saved several hundred thousand over time.

This money was her secret safety net.

Originally meant as her daughter's escape route.

She feared something might happen one day.

Leaving her daughter with no one to rely on.

Anna's eyes brightened.

Her mother agreed.

She had no more reservations.

"I'll start preparing in the next couple days."

"We'll leave as soon as we get a chance."

Her work skills were solid.

Supporting her mother would be more than manageable.

But Vivian lowered her gaze.

Her expression dimmed.

Anna anxiously gripped her hand.

"Mom?"

"Are you feeling unwell?"

She carefully checked her mother's body.

Worried there might be other injuries.

Vivian gently stroked her hair.

Her voice was soft but firm.

"Anna."

"We can't leave yet."

Anna's fingers trembled.

Why endure any longer?

"Mom..."

"Why?"

Vivian looked at her with heartache.

Her pale lips parted slightly.

"Trust me."

"I will take you away when the time comes."

Anna wanted to press further.

Vivian suddenly broke into violent coughs.

Anna swallowed her questions.

Her mother's health was too fragile.

She couldn't add more pressure.

Since her mother said so.

She would wait a little longer.

She forced a smile.

"I'll listen to you, Mom."

Vivian's heart ached.

She pulled her daughter into an embrace.

"My good girl..."

"You've suffered too much."

Anna patted her back gently.

Just a little longer.

She could endure it.

After putting away the medical kit.

Anna had calmed down.

"Mom."

"I'll get warm water to clean you up."

Vivian nodded.

Watching her daughter's retreating figure.

She sighed helplessly.

Anna changed into simple home clothes.

She tied her hair up casually.

Without any makeup.

She was still stunningly beautiful.

She carried hot water through the living room.

The servants watched with cold eyes.

Some even whispered mocking laughs.

Since the fake pregnancy incident was exposed.

No one respected them anymore.

Anna gripped the basin edge tightly.

She hated their snobbery.

But felt powerless.

In this house.

Without Howard's permission.

No one cared about their well-being.

She ignored their stares.

Walking straight into her mother's bedroom.

Vivian lay on the bed.

Her eyes empty.

Seeing her daughter.

She finally smiled.

"Anna."

"Go rest."

"You don't need to do this."

Anna's heart ached.

Those servants wouldn't come anyway.

She shook her head.

"I don't trust others to care for you."

"I want to do it myself."

Vivian smiled helplessly.

Having such a daughter.

Made her life worthwhile.

Anna helped her sit up.

Gently wiping her wrists with a warm towel.

After settling her mother to sleep.

She tucked her in properly.

"Mom."

"Rest well."

Vivian nodded with a smile.

Anna kissed her cheek.

Turned off the light and left.

The moment the bedroom door closed.

Her smile vanished.

"I can't let Mom get hurt again."

She clenched her jaw.

Gently shutting the door.

Phone in hand.

Anna looked toward Howard in the living room.

Howard enjoyed his tea leisurely.

Legs crossed arrogantly.

Seeing her.

He shot a disdainful glance.

"Your wretched mother isn't dead yet?"

Anna's nails dug into her palms.

The pain came.

But she felt nothing.

The power imbalance was too great.

She couldn't touch him now.
###Chapter 11

Anna Ross turned her phone screen toward Howard Lowell.

The photo clearly showed Adrian Sinclair's license plate.

Her voice was cold.

"I've done what you asked."

"He left Chloe Valentine to personally drive me home."

Howard repeatedly checked the license plate.

Wild joy flashed in his eyes.

"Well done."

He couldn't help but laugh.

Anna retrieved her phone.

Her gaze sharp as a blade.

"If you want me to keep getting close to Adrian Sinclair, don't touch my mother."

"If you harm her again, I will never see him."

Howard narrowed his eyes.

"Threatening me?"

His voice turned grim.

Anna didn't back down.

"Your choice."

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

Howard fell silent for a moment.

Finally, he nodded darkly.

"Fine."

"But if you play games, I'll handle it myself."

Anna turned and went back to her room.

The door slammed shut.

She curled up under the covers.

Burying herself completely in the dark.

She woke up at nine in the morning.

Sunlight stung her eyes.

She walked into the walk-in closet.

Her eyes fell on a brand new bag.

It was a gift her mother had scrimped and saved to buy.

She had been overjoyed.

But now...

Anna gently took the bag down.

Her fingers traced the fine leather.

Her eyes filled with reluctance.

"Return it."

"At least it'll get some money back."

She washed up and changed.

Carrying the bag, she went out.

The luxury store was brilliantly lit.

A sales associate greeted her warmly.

"What can I help you find today?"

Her eyes scanned the bag in Anna's hand.

Anna smiled and handed it over.

"I'd like to return this bag."

The sales associate's smile stiffened.

She quickly regained her professionalism.

"Was there something unsatisfactory?"

Anna shook her head.

"Nothing was wrong."

"I just don't want it anymore."

Her tone was calm.

The sales associate checked the bag.

She turned to process the return.

Anna waited quietly.

Just then.

A coquettish female voice rang out.

"Adrian, help me pick out new clothes."

Anna turned her head sharply.

Chloe Valentine walked into the store arm in arm with Adrian Sinclair.

They looked intimate.

Adrian seemed relaxed.

Anna's face instantly paled.

She hurriedly looked down.

Afraid of being recognized.

Fortunately, they didn't notice.

They walked right past her.

Anna secretly sighed in relief.

Chloe happily picked out dresses.

"Does this look good?"

She held it up against herself for Adrian.

Adrian glanced over casually.

"Not bad."

He seemed distracted.

Chloe pouted.

"You didn't even look properly!"

She coquetted.

Adrian curved his lips.

"It really suits you."

"Get whatever you like."

His tone was indulgent.

Chloe immediately beamed.

She swayed her hips and continued shopping.

Anna's legs grew tired from standing.

But she didn't dare move.

Every second felt agonizingly long.

Chloe picked out another pile of clothes.

She sweetly called the sales associate.

"Find my size in this."

She was a regular. The staff knew her measurements.

Anna bent down to rub her legs.

Compared to Adrian's composure.

She seemed particularly pathetic.

The sales associate returned.

"Miss, this is the last limited edition piece. Are you sure you want to return it?"

She sounded regretful.

Anna gritted her teeth and nodded.

"Sure."

Fine sweat coated her palms.

Chloe suddenly rushed over.

She snatched the bag.

"I've been waiting for this bag for a week!"

"Refund her quickly. I'll take it!"

She was ecstatic.

The sales associate immediately became delighted.

She hurriedly agreed.

Chloe looked Anna over arrogantly.

Her eyes were disdainful.

"Know your place."

"How dare you compete with me?"

She suddenly paused.

Studying Anna closely.

"Hey, have we met before?"

The more she looked, the more familiar Anna seemed.

Anna's heart stopped.

She desperately lowered her head to avoid recognition.

Chloe was about to press further.

The sales associate恰好 brought the clothes.

"Here's your size."

Chloe took the clothes.

She turned and entered the fitting room.

Anna clutched her chest, breathing heavily.

Thankfully, she wasn't recognized.

The sales associate handed over the refund.

"Please keep this safe."

Anna quickly took it and stuffed it into her bag.

She was eager to leave.

She glanced at Adrian.

He didn't seem to have noticed.

She would be safe once she left the store.

She quickened her pace.

She deliberately turned her head away as she passed Adrian.

She was almost at the door.

A large hand suddenly grabbed her.

Anna froze completely.

She didn't dare look back.

Adrian's sarcastic voice coldly rang out.

"Is this how you and your mother drain men dry?"

"Howard just bought it, and you're already selling it."

Her worst fear had come true.
###Chapter 12

Adrian Sinclair let out a cold laugh.

His gaze was full of mockery as he looked at her.

It was as if he was watching the biggest joke in the world.

Anna Ross felt her face burn.

His voice was just loud enough.

It carried throughout the entire store.

Every pair of eyes instantly focused on them.

Anna felt like she was being publicly executed.

Fortunately, Adrian had already released her hand.

As long as she left this place.

She would never have to endure these stares again.

Adrian saw her silence.

His brow lifted slightly.

His tone grew even more vicious.

"What?"

"Did I hit a nerve?"

"Is this your silent admission?"

The store clerks began to whisper among themselves.

Anna avoided their gazes, humiliated and angry.

"What you choose to believe is your freedom."

She didn't want to argue anymore.

She didn't have the energy for it.

Anna's indifference inexplicably annoyed Adrian.

It was like punching cotton.

The more she wanted to leave.

The less he wanted to let her have her way.

As Anna turned to go.

A clicking sound came from behind her.

Her steps froze.

It was the sound of a camera.

Anna's body trembled slightly.

Her small hands clenched tightly into fists.

Adrian saw her stop.

A satisfied smile curled his lips.

"What's wrong?"

"You don't look so well."

He was asking a question he already knew the answer to.

Adrian walked over to her.

He caught the fear on her face.

His mood instantly improved.

Anna looked up.

She met his playful gaze.

Her small face flushed red with anger.

"What will it take for you to just leave me alone!?"

It was him who told her to disappear.

She did it.

This time wasn't intentional.

Why wouldn't he let go?

Adrian showed her the photo.

He toyed with the phone in his hand.

He snorted coldly.

"What if I send these to Howard Lowell?"

"Let him see what his stepdaughter is up to behind his back."

"Do you think he'd thank me?"

Anna's face instantly turned pale.

All color drained from it.

Adrian continued his attack.

"If he knew you were obedient on the surface."

"But a gold digger behind his back."

"What do you think his reaction would be?"

He smirked devilishly.

He enjoyed seeing her defeated.

Anna cursed inwardly.

Howard must not find out about her escape plan.

"What right do you have to take my picture?"

"I have the right to demand you delete those photos."

Her tone was flat.

No emotion could be heard.

Adrian saw her defiance.

His eyes darkened.

He raised his hand and pinched her chin.

A sinister smile played on his lips.

"Delete them for you?"

"Fine."

"Get on your knees and beg me."

"Make me happy."

"Maybe I'll consider it."

A flicker of hope appeared in Anna's eyes.

It died out instantly.

She knew it.

Adrian would never kindly let her go.

Adrian saw through her reaction.

He increased the pressure of his grip.

"Hmm?"

Pain shot through her chin.

Anna's small face scrunched up.

She slapped his hand away.

She countered calmly.

"What does selling my father's gifts have to do with you?"

"Please stop bothering me!"

She tried her best to control her emotions.

She didn't want to attract attention.

Adrian was completely enraged.

His furious eyes bore into her.

He spoke icily.

"Oh?"

"So that's how it is."

"Are you involved with Howard Lowell too?"

Anna's expression turned ugly.

Rage burned in her heart.

How could he be so vile?

More and more onlookers gathered around.

They whispered to each other.

Smiles on their faces.

Watching her humiliation.

Adrian nodded to himself.

He put on a pitying expression.

"Right."

"It's not like it's your first time getting involved with a sugar daddy."

Slap!

A slap landed on his face.

Her strength wasn't great.

But it left his face stinging painfully.

He narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Anna.

His face darkened like ink.

Anna gave him a disappointed look.

She tried to walk past him.

"Did I say you could leave?"

Adrian's icy voice sounded behind her.

He viciously pulled Anna back.

His face gloomy, he dragged her back inside.

Anna's heart jumped in fear.

That direction led to the fitting room!

What did he want to do!?

She struggled desperately.

"Let me go!"

"Let go!"

Adrian acted as if he didn't hear.

He kicked open the fitting room door.

It slammed open.

Then slammed shut.

The store clerks looked at each other.

They all shook their heads.

They could see Anna was being forced.

But none dared to intervene.

Adrian Sinclair's name could buy ten stores like this.

They couldn't afford to offend him.

Chloe Valentine was happily trying on clothes.

She planned to have Adrian buy them all.

To show off in front of her girlfriends.

Hearing his voice.

She hurriedly dressed and rushed out.

But she didn't see him.

She frowned.

"Where's Mr. Sinclair?"

No one answered.

Seeing she was being ignored.

Her voice grew more displeased.

"I asked where Mr. Sinclair is!?"

She definitely heard his voice earlier.

He couldn't have just vanished.

The clerks shook their heads.

They pretended not to have seen what happened.

Chloe wasn't someone easy to deal with either.

Best not to provoke her if possible.

Chloe stamped her foot in anger.

Her heart ached.

Did he abandon her and leave first?

She forgot about the new clothes.

Grabbing her purse, she ran out to look for him.

The sound of her footsteps faded away.

Anna used all her strength to break free.

But his strength was too great.

She could clearly see the bulging veins on his hand.

It was somewhat frightening.

Adrian pinned her against the wall.

His tall figure completely trapped her smaller one.

She couldn't escape even if she wanted to.

They were very close.

In the narrow space, they could hear each other's breathing.

The air was filled with his scent.

Anna didn't know if she was angry or embarrassed.

Her small face was unbearably red.

Adrian gripped her chin.

Forcing her to look up.

"You've really grown some nerve."

"Daring to hit me."

"Quite a surprise."

His tone rose at the end.

He tilted his head.

Touching the spot where she hit him.

The overhead light shone down.

Casting shadows under his eyes.

But it couldn't hide the malice in them.

Anna had calmed down.

She was a little scared.

She did hit him.

But he provoked her first.

Right.

The photos!

"What will it take for you to delete the photos?"

Anna didn't understand.

Why was Adrian so fixated on her?

Was tormenting her his idea of fun?
###Chapter 13

Adrian Sinclair let out a cold laugh.

His gaze swept over her with amusement.

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"You want me to calm down."

"Then delete the photo."

His grip tightened.

Anna Ross's expression froze.

She understood his meaning.

A cold laugh echoed in her heart.

He just wanted to humiliate her, didn't he?

But she couldn't afford to gamble.

She had to obey him.

She couldn't let the secret of her escape with her mother be exposed!

She nodded.

Even though she had mentally prepared herself.

Tears still fell uncontrollably.

Adrian watched her cry.

His heart felt like it was stuffed with wet cotton.

It was stifling and uncomfortable.

Was she really that unwilling?

Anna closed her eyes.

She stood on her tiptoes to reach his lips.

Their touch was slightly cool.

Adrian watched her.

A flicker of emotion passed through his eyes.

Her movements were clumsy.

It was less of a kiss.

And more like she was frantically gnawing at him.

Anna continued her awkward gnawing for a while.

But Adrian never opened his mouth.

She was confused.

Unsure of what to do next.

Annoyance flared within her.

Adrian was definitely doing this on purpose.

Just as she grew angry and tried to pull back.

Adrian's large hand cupped the back of her head.

His strength pulled her back.

Suddenly.

His thin lips covered hers.

He tilted her chin upward.

Deepening the kiss.

Anna instinctively tried to escape.

His hand applied slight pressure.

Holding the back of her head firmly.

Giving her no room to retreat.

His other hand on her waist tightened.

Anna was pressed entirely against him.

Forced to feel his presence.

Her head grew dizzy from the kiss.

His burning hand探进 her clothes.

Anna no longer had the strength to resist.

Her words of refusal were trapped in her throat.

Her eyes became hazy.

Just as Adrian was about to touch that softness.

Someone's phone rang.

They both snapped back to reality.

Adrian's handsome features twisted with anger.

He shoved Anna away as if she were trash.

Anna crashed into the wall behind her.

A pained grunt escaped her.

Adrian glared at her with disgust.

His tone was sarcastic.

"You're just as cheap as ever."

"You'd throw yourself at any man without a second thought!"

After speaking.

He opened the door and walked out.

Leaving her with only a cold, merciless shadow.

Anna saw him gently lead Chloe Valentine away.

She could no longer suppress her sorrow.

She crouched on the ground and cried.

Yes.

He hated her.

She deserved his humiliation.

Many scenes flashed through her mind.

Tears fell like a broken string, never stopping.

She could only hug herself.

Trying her best not to collapse.

"Miss, are you alright?"

After crying for a while.

A shop assistant appeared before her.

Handing her a tissue.

Her expression concerned.

Anna dried the tears on her face.

The assistant bent down to help her up.

Comforting her.

"It's alright."

"This will all pass."

Anna shook her head.

Thanking her.

"I'm fine."

"Thank you."

The assistant watched her despondent retreating figure.

She couldn't help but sigh.

Another pitiful soul.

Anna didn't know how she left the mall.

The outside light was so bright it hurt her eyes.

She raised a hand to shield them.

But bumped into someone.

She quickly apologized.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"

"Anna Ross!?"

A female voice rang out.

It sounded surprised.

And questioning.

Anna moved her hand away.

She看清 the person before her.

Her university classmate.

Lynn Wanwan.

After Lynn看清 her face.

She couldn't hide her look of惊艳.

Praising her.

"It really is you."

"I didn't expect to see you again."

"You're even more beautiful than before!"

Anna forced a smile.

It had been a year since she graduated.

She basically never saw most of her classmates.

Plus, she was hardly at school during her junior and senior years.

She wasn't very close with these classmates.

She could only barely remember some of them.

But they all seemed to know her.

Lynn wasn't annoyed.

She knew about Anna's situation.

She asked with a smile.

"By the way."

"Why didn't you come to the last two class reunions?"

"I had things going on during that time."

"So I didn't go."

Anna replied faintly.

Lynn nodded in understanding.

"I heard Adrian Sinclair is very successful now."

"Like, really successful."

"Are you two getting married soon?"

"You were the golden couple of the school back then."

"You have to invite me to the wedding!"

Anna's eyes dimmed.

Her head felt like it was buzzing.

Completely out of control.

She gave a dry laugh.

"We've already broken up."

Broken up!?

Lynn, stunned站在原地, didn't have time to ask more.

Anna had already stumbled away.

The first thing she did upon returning home was to go upstairs to see Vivian Lowell.

But Vivian was already waiting for her in the living room.

Seeing her poor state.

Vivian rushed over to support her.

Asking with heartache.

"Anna, what's wrong?"

Feeling her mother's presence.

Anna could no longer control herself and hugged her tightly, crying.

Vivian's heart ached.

She could only gently pat her back in comfort.

After Anna cried enough.

She returned to her room.

Vivian followed her.

Tucking her in.

"Anna, get some rest."

"Mom is here."

She nodded安心.

Falling into a deep sleep.

Vivian stayed by her bedside.

The next day.

Anna was awakened by a nightmare.

Checking the time.

Oh no.

It was so late!

She still had to go to work!

Her stupid head.

She forgot to set the alarm.

Not even bothering with breakfast.

After washing up and changing clothes, she rushed desperately towards the company.

Scolding herself in her heart.

She had just started this job.

She was only an ordinary employee in the Creative Department.

She actually dared to be late.

She was finished.

Despite rushing.

She was still thirty minutes late.

Anna could only brace herself and enter the company.

She kept her head down.

Trying her best not to be noticed.

As she walked, she noticed a shadow fall before her.

Anna slowly looked up.

Adrian's handsome face was reflected in her pupils.

Anna was startled.

She took a few steps back.

Only just managing to steady herself.

A group of branch managers and company leaders簇拥 around Adrian.

He was a born leader.

Anna's heart pounded like thunder.

Praying he wouldn't cause trouble for her now.

But Adrian only glanced at her indifferently.

He raised his hand to check the time.

Raised an eyebrow towards a company leader nearby.

His tone was very distant.

"This employee seems to be late."

"Since when does the company need to keep people like this?"

Anna looked up.

This employee?

Was he pretending not to know her?
###Chapter 14

Adrian Sinclair's voice was cold as ice.

The manager's heart dropped.
He cursed internally, wondering which fool had chosen today of all days to cross him.

Being late was one thing.
But being late when the Taskmaster was present?
That was sheer idiocy.

Then he saw who it was.
Cold sweat instantly soaked through his dress shirt.

Anna Ross.
The daughter of the company's head.
How was he supposed to discipline her?

He couldn't afford to offend Adrian.
But Howard Lowell?
That was an even greater risk.

Adrian's frown deepened when no one responded.
He turned his head slightly toward the manager.
His fingertips tapped the desk lightly.

"Is this how lax discipline is at your company?"
"A late employee doesn't even warrant a reprimand?"

The managers' legs trembled.
They stumbled over their words.
"S-Sir Adrian, it's not like that..."
One man bowed his head, not daring to meet his eyes.

Adrian remained standing.
His gaze drifted casually toward Anna.

Anna happened to look up at that moment.
Her eyes met his bottomless ones.
She quickly lowered her head, her fingers twisting her clothes.

The manager forced himself to intervene.
"Go report to HR," he said sternly, though internally panicking.
He needed to get her out of there, fast.

Anna felt a wave of relief.
She nodded quickly.
"Alright. I'll go right now."
She turned to escape.

"Stop."
Adrian's voice cut through the air again.
Anna pretended not to hear and quickened her pace.

Adrian's expression darkened.
He strode after her and blocked her path.
They nearly collided.

The managers gasped collectively.

Adrian looked down at her, a cold smirk playing on his lips.
"Did I say you could leave?"

"Didn't you want to punish me?"
Anna frowned, her tone urgent.
"What's wrong with me going to HR?"

Adrian chuckled lowly.
He leaned in close, bending toward her.
"I said I would punish you," he murmured, his breath brushing her ear.
"I didn't say you could leave."

Anna bit her lower lip.
She had thought he was letting her go.
He was just waiting for this moment.
"What do you want?"

Adrian straightened up, pretending to consider.
The room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

After a moment, he raised an eyebrow playfully.
"I want you to be my Executive Assistant."

His Executive Assistant?
He just wanted to keep her close to torment her.
"I refuse!" Anna said firmly.

Adrian's eyes darkened.
"The pay is much better than your current job," he said.
He emphasized the word "current" deliberately.

Anna froze instantly.
He was threatening her about her mall job.

Adrian turned away, satisfied.
"From today onward, she's my Executive Assistant."
"Remove her from her previous position."

The managers exchanged uneasy glances.
Their faces were pale with sweat.
"Sir Adrian, we need Mr. Lowell's approval for that..."

Adrian's expression turned icy.
The temperature in the room seemed to drop.
"Are you saying my word carries less weight than a branch manager's?"

He stood tall, his presence overwhelming.
No one dared to look up.
They could only swallow hard.

"What's going on here?"
Howard Lowell's voice suddenly rang out.

Everyone breathed a silent sigh of relief.

Howard shot Anna a glare before smiling at Adrian.
"Adrian, you should have told me you were coming."
"Join me for dinner tonight?"

Adrian's face remained expressionless.
"No need. I was just looking around."
Howard's fist tightened, but he kept smiling.

"Uncle," Adrian said, pointing at Anna.
"I want her as my Executive Assistant."
"They say I need your approval."

Anna's heart stopped.
He actually dared to say it.

Howard's smile stiffened.
He glanced at Anna, his eyes shifting.
What game was Adrian playing now?

"Adrian, Anna isn't capable enough. She might hinder your work."
Anna relaxed slightly.
Thankfully, Howard hadn't agreed.

Adrian's eyes darkened.
"Uncle, you should reconsider."
"Although I'm only here to inspect, taking over this branch wouldn't be difficult."

Howard's head snapped up.
He met Adrian's cold gaze.
He was right.
If Adrian wanted, he could take everything away at any time.

Howard narrowed his eyes at Anna.
Maybe this was a good thing.
She could keep an eye on Adrian for him.

"If you want her, take her," Howard said, forcing a smile.
He walked over to Anna.
"Anna, be perceptive and work hard," he said, patting her shoulder heavily.
He emphasized the word "perceptive" distinctly.
###Chapter 15

Anna Ross's heart sank at Howard Lowell's answer.

"I don't want to be his Executive Assistant!"

No one had asked for her opinion.

They just decided for her.

Was she really that worthless?

Adrian Sinclair glanced at her with amusement.

He found her struggle ridiculous.

Howard Lowell snapped at her first.

"Aren't you old enough to know better?"

"He is your cousin."

"Family should help each other."

"But..."

Anna tried to argue.

Howard shot her a threatening glare.

Her words stuck in her throat.

"Wait for me in the office."

"We'll handle the handover later."

"Then you'll go to Adrian's side."

It was useless to say anything.

Adrian smirked.

He gave her a victorious smile.

Anna turned her head away.

She didn't want to see his smug expression.

"Since it's decided."

"Come over soon."

"Don't keep me waiting."

"Little cousin."

He walked past her.

Giving her a meaningful look.

Howard signaled Anna to go to the office.

He smiled and followed Adrian.

However unwilling she was.

Anna had to obey.

This only strengthened her resolve to take her mother away!

After a while.

Howard walked in with a cold face.

Muttering under his breath.

"Adrian Sinclair, I remember you."

"Just you wait!"

He sat on the sofa.

Then he noticed Anna.

Anna asked him calmly.

"Why did you agree?"

Howard's eyes still burned with anger.

His tone was harsh.

"Why so many questions?"

"Just remember this."

"Follow Adrian closely."

"Report his every move to me."

"Or don't blame me for what happens to your mother."

He could control Anna.

Because Vivian Lowell was in his hands.

Anna understood.

He agreed to let her go.

Just to spy on Adrian.

How despicable.

But thinking of her mother.

She softened.

"I'll do it."

"But don't touch my mother."

"That depends on your performance."

Howard snorted coldly.

He waved his hand, dismissing her.

Anna returned to her desk.

She couldn't focus on work.

Her mind was in chaos.

Adrian was such a jerk!

He warned her not to provoke him.

Why did he have to come after her?

A colleague noticed her distress.

They couldn't help but ask.

"Are you okay?"

"Not feeling well?"

She looked completely drained.

Anna patted her cheeks.

She told herself to be strong.

Only then could she give her mother the life they wanted!

She hadn't been here long.

She wasn't close to her colleagues.

But they cared about her.

She replied politely.

"Thank you for your concern."

"I'm fine."

"You look nice when you smile."

"You should smile more."

"Don't always look so worried."

Anna felt helpless.

Without all these troubles.

Maybe she could be carefree.

And laugh heartily.

But circumstances didn't allow it.

......

Finally, it was time to leave work.

Anna dragged her tired body out of the company.

She immediately saw the black Maybach.

The window rolled down.

Adrian leaned back casually.

His fingers tapped the steering wheel.

"Get in."

"No, thanks."

"I have to get home."

Anna forced herself to stay calm.

How annoying.

The more she didn't want to see him.

The more he appeared.

As she tried to leave.

Adrian spoke.

"Don't say I didn't warn you."

"You're my Executive Assistant now."

"You have to listen to me."

He watched her stop in the rearview mirror.

Anna closed her eyes.

She told herself not to show weakness in front of him.

She composed herself.

Turning around, she looked directly at him.

"I am your Executive Assistant."

"But Executive Assistants have off hours too."

"I haven't started working yet."

"You have no right to order me around now!"

Adrian gave her a calm, sidelong glance.

Well, she's got some spine now!

His face turned cold.

"Then consider yourself on duty starting now."

He commanded.

Leaving no room for refusal.

Anna was angered by his shamelessness.

Her face flushed with frustration.

"Who does that?"

Just because he was in a high position.

Did that mean he could control others as he pleased?

Adrian started the car.

His tone held a warning.

"You have three seconds to get in."

"Or face the consequences."

Another threat.

Anna laughed bitterly inside.

Adrian and Howard were two of a kind.

But she couldn't refuse.

If he told Howard about yesterday.

Howard would be even crueler to her mother.

She had no choice.

Anna reached for the back door.

It was locked.

"Didn't you tell me to get in?"

"What do you mean?"

"Sit in the front."

Adrian leaned against the seat.

Watching her sideways.

Even simple actions looked dignified.

"What are you trying to do now?"

She clenched her fingers.

She had never understood him.

Adrian ignored her.

Anna had no choice.

She walked around and opened the passenger door.

She slammed it shut.

The door closed with a loud bang.

Adrian remained unfazed.

The car pulled out.

Anna looked around the interior.

It was very clean.

No dust or stains.

No small decorations.

There was a faint scent in the car.

Indescribably pleasant.

But being with Adrian.

She felt uneasy.

It wasn't usually like this.

Adrian's cool voice broke the silence.

"I hope you remember."

"As my Executive Assistant."

"You need to be on call twenty-four seven."

"Without my permission."

"You cannot clock out."

"Understood?"

Anna turned to him in disbelief.

Looking at his cold face.

She was furious but didn't dare speak.

On call twenty-four seven.

How was that different from a slave?

He might as well just say he wanted her to be a slave.

Adrian noticed her silence.

His expression turned displeased.

"Do you have a problem?"

"No."

How dare she have a problem.

Anna looked out the window.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.

She muttered under her breath.

"What a complete and utter slave driver!"

"What did you say?"
###Chapter 16

Anna could feel the temperature around him drop sharply.

His dark, menacing eyes were fixed intently on her.

"You misheard."

She offered a quiet explanation, turning her face away to avoid his gaze.

。。。。。。。

Buzz buzz buzz...... Buzz buzz buzz......

Adrian held the steering wheel with one hand and answered the call.

"Adrian, where are you?"
The car was quiet. Anna could clearly hear the voice on the other end.
It was Chloe.

She immediately felt uncomfortable.

Adrian's expression remained unchanged. His voice was lazy. "Driving."
"Adrian, I miss you. Can you come pick me up?"
A sweet, coquettish voice came through the phone.
Anna felt goosebumps.
She stole a glance at Adrian.
His brows were tightly furrowed, his eyes completely unreadable.
Did this approach not work on him?

Adrian had intended to refuse.
But noticing Anna's stolen glance, the corner of his mouth suddenly lifted. "Alright. I'll come find you."
He ended the call.
Anna quickly turned her head, her fingers tightening on the seatbelt.
He was going to see Chloe. Surely he would let her go now?

She ventured cautiously, "Since you're meeting someone, can I go home first?"
"No. You're coming with me."
Adrian turned his head slightly. His gaze swept over her face, devoid of any emotion.

Anna thought he was utterly unreasonable.
She stared at his profile, unable to decipher his thoughts.
Go with him to witness his sweet moments with Chloe?
She suppressed the strange feeling in her heart and found her voice. "This isn't within an Executive Assistant's duties, is it? I'm just your assistant. I don't need to be involved in your personal matters."

Adrian let out a cold laugh, his tone icy. "You haven't grasped the situation. You're my personal assistant. Your duties extend beyond work. Remember that."
His voice was a command.
Anna felt like a fish on a chopping block, completely at his mercy.

The car continued moving.
But Anna wanted to escape.
"Personal assistant? You didn't say that earlier!" She stubbornly lifted her chin, attempting to argue.
He had clearly only said she would be his assistant. When did it become personal assistant?

Displeasure flashed across Adrian's face. His brows furrowed again, a ruthless glint appearing in his eyes. "I'm your superior. What I say goes. It's not your place to question it. You will only listen to me."
Anna smiled bitterly.
Right. He could do whatever he wanted.
She never had the right to object.
In his eyes, she was just an insignificant ant he could crush at will.

Seeing her slight reaction, Adrian's lips curved faintly. "Weren't you desperate to ruin my blind date? So desperate you were willing to use your charms. Now a perfect opportunity is right in front of you. Stop pretending."
Pretending?
Anna just felt a chill in her heart.
She instinctively wanted to explain. "It was because..." But her words caught halfway.
She had indeed done those things.
Any explanation would sound weak and hollow.

Adrian scoffed. "Because of what? Why stop? Let me hear what irrefutable reason you have." His tone held resentment, as if questioning the recent events, or perhaps the events of three years ago.
Anna paused, ultimately choosing silence.

Adrian, however, had no intention of letting her off. "Don't try to explain. It's too hypocritical. It makes me sick to listen to it, you know?" His expression shifted abruptly, a violent aura erupting from him. He was like a beast ready to crush her at any moment.
She was desolate for a moment, silently looking out the window.
Quiet descended upon the car once more.

The car soon stopped in front of an upscale restaurant.
Adrian didn't look at her, getting out directly.
Anna didn't dare hesitate, quickly following.
He walked fast. She had to half-jog to keep up behind him.

"Adrian, over here!" The sweet, coquettish voice rang out.
Anna looked up.
Chloe was running towards Adrian happily.
Adrian stopped, allowing Chloe to loop her arm through his.
She leaned against his shoulder playfully, pouting. "Where did you go yesterday? You just left me all alone suddenly. I was so upset."
Adrian's lips curved. He offered a bland explanation. "There was an urgent matter yesterday. I had to leave in a hurry. Didn't have time to tell you."
Anna's heart trembled. She bit her lip.
She remembered Adrian leaving with Chloe yesterday. Did he leave again partway through?

"Alright, I'm not actually mad. But you can't do that again, okay?" Chloe cooed, though a smile was on her face.
Adrian merely gave a slight smile and said nothing.

Chloe was about to pull Adrian away when she suddenly noticed Anna following behind him.
She narrowed her eyes. "Who are you?"
Anna's heart jumped. Before she could speak, Adrian cut in, his tone leisurely. "Chloe, I forgot to introduce you. This is my assistant."
"Assistant?" Chloe looked her over, her eyes full of suspicion. "I've never seen her before."
Clearly, she didn't believe it.

Anna didn't want to provoke Chloe. Avoiding her was best right now. "I really am his assistant. I just got hired today. Don't worry, I won't disturb you. I'll be going now." As she spoke, she turned to leave.
"You don't need to leave."
Adrian's cold voice came through.
Chloe was startled, looking at Adrian in disbelief.
He was actively asking this third wheel to stay?
This was their date. Why keep her around?
She looked at Anna again, her eyes now holding more wariness.

Anna's fingers twitched, then clenched tightly. She answered with her back to him. "Mr. Sinclair, while I am your assistant, I have my own matters to attend to."
'Mr. Sinclair.' How formal.
Adrian's eyes instantly darkened. His gaze turned cold rapidly, his tone sarcastic. "Why do you think I want you to stay? Just to have you follow us around and serve tea and water."
Anna's spine stiffened. She didn't leave.

Chloe watched Anna vigilantly, her gaze icy, as if she wished she could bore a hole through her.
But she quickly retracted her gaze, turning a sweet smile towards Adrian. "Adrian, she doesn't need to follow us. There are waiters inside."
Her intuition told her this woman was definitely not just an assistant!
###Chapter 17

Adrian Sinclair’s gaze settled on her. “I only want her to serve.”

Anna Ross’s fingers tightened then relaxed.

“But I just want to be alone with you. I don’t want any outsiders interrupting.” Chloe Valentine’s voice was sweet, but her eyes held a cold glint. “Don’t you have things to do? Shouldn’t you leave?”

Anna Ross curved her lips into a smile. “Alright.” She turned to leave.

Her wrist was suddenly seized in a strong grip.

Adrian pulled her back in front of him, his voice low. “You don’t leave until I say so.” His fingers tightened, leaving red marks on her pale skin. “That’s an Executive Assistant’s duty.”

Anna couldn’t break free. She looked up and glared at him.

Adrian seemed to enjoy her angry expression, a slight smirk playing on his lips.

Anna suddenly looked at Chloe. “Since Mr. Sinclair insists, I suppose I have to stay. But will Ms. Valentine be upset?”

Adrian raised an eyebrow, a flicker of interest in his eyes.

Their gazes locked for a moment.

He turned to Chloe, his tone gentle. “Chloe is the most understanding, isn’t that right?”

Chloe’s nails dug into her palm. She forced a smile. “Of course I don’t mind.” Her eyes, however, shot venomous daggers at Anna.

Anna hadn’t expected her to concede.

Adrian was already walking to Chloe’s side. He spoke coldly. “Aren’t you coming?”

Anna followed.

The restaurant was opulent, like a palace.

A server led them to a private room and respectfully withdrew.

Adrian signaled to Anna. “Pull out the chairs.”

A triumphant smile touched Chloe’s lips.

Anna’s fingers trembled slightly as she pulled out two adjacent chairs.

Adrian sat down gracefully. Chloe immediately took the seat next to him.

Anna quietly stepped back to the side.

The food arrived quickly, its aroma filling the air.

Anna pressed a hand against her growling stomach. She hadn’t eaten a thing since morning.

She just hoped this torment would end soon.

Chloe placed food on Adrian’s plate, her tone dripping with concern. “Adrian, you’ve lost weight recently. You should eat more.”
###Chapter 18

Adrian Sinclair gave Anna Ross a brief, indifferent glance.

He accepted the soup bowl Chloe Valentine handed him, but merely set it down on the table.

Chloe’s heart tightened.
She needed to secure this man, and quickly.

“Since you’re here to serve, be more observant,” Adrian said suddenly, looking at Anna. “Come here and serve the food.”

Anna’s fingers trembled slightly.
She wanted to refuse.
But his icy stare froze her in place.

Silently, she picked up the serving utensils.
“Which dish would you like?”

Chloe nearly gritted her teeth to dust.
He wouldn’t even touch the food she had just served him.
Now he was asking another woman to do it.

“Whatever,” Adrian replied lazily, leaning back in his chair.
His eyes, however, remained fixed on her movements.

Anna picked up a piece of fish with the serving fork.
Just as she was about to place it in his bowl, he moved his hand away.
The fish fell directly onto his polished leather shoe.

“Clean it up,” Adrian’s voice turned cold.

Anna looked up. “You moved on purpose.”

“I said, clean it up.” His tone was terrifyingly dark.
Even Chloe shrank back slightly.

Anna’s eyes instantly welled with tears.
She reached for a napkin.
He pushed her hand away sharply.

“Use your hand.”

“Adrian!” Tears spilled from Anna’s eyes.
He only repeated coldly, “Hurry up.”

She took a deep breath.
If he was determined to humiliate her,
then so be it.

She slowly knelt down.
Her hand shook as she reached out.
Tears fell onto the carpet.

Adrian watched her humble的姿态.
A storm raged in his eyes.
He suddenly pulled his foot back.

“Get away.”

He ultimately didn’t let her touch the shoe.
Anna silently stood up and retreated to a corner.
Her face was now a mask of calm.

Chloe shot her a contemptuous glance.

。。。。。。

“Adrian, take me home.”
After dinner, Chloe linked her arm with Adrian’s.
Her eyes were full of expectation.

Adrian withdrew his arm.
He called his driver.
“Someone will take you home.”

Chloe’s lips pressed together in disappointment.
But she quickly smiled again. “I’ll message you when I get home.”
She couldn’t appear too eager.

Adrian gave a slight nod.

Soon, they were the only two left.
Anna’s heart pounded like a drum.
She needed to leave immediately.

“I’m heading back now.”
She kept her head down and turned to go.

Adrian let out a soft laugh. “I’ll take you.”

Anna shook her head hurriedly. “I’ll get a cab.”
She frantically pulled out her phone.
Her fingertips were trembling.
###Chapter 19

Adrian Sinclair raised a lazy eyebrow, his right hand slipping casually into his trouser pocket.

His heavy gaze settled on her, tinged with amusement.

Anna Ross kept scrolling through her phone screen.

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

The streetlights stretched their shadows long across the pavement.

The street was empty.

She bit her lip and looked into the distance.

Mom must be waiting anxiously.

The night was silent.

Only the rustle of wind through leaves broke the stillness.

A taxi slowed to a stop, its available light glowing.

Anna glanced at him.

Seeing no reaction, she quickly pulled the door open.

"South Lake Community, please—"

Before she could finish, the opposite door swung open.

Adrian slid into the seat beside her, his long legs folding into the car.

Anna froze.

"What are you doing?"

She suddenly remembered his earlier words.

"I said I don't need a ride!"

Adrian gave her a dismissive look.

He addressed the driver. "The Waterfront Residences."

Anna's fingers twitched.

The Waterfront Residences?

That was his new apartment.

Howard had mentioned it last time.

Was he taking her there?

Her heart raced suddenly.

Her voice tightened. "I need to go home!"

Adrian tapped the window with his knuckle.

"Drive."

The driver hesitated, sweat beading on his forehead.

Anna gripped the door handle.

"Adrian Sinclair, what do you want?"

Her voice carried suppressed anger.

Adrian's eyes flickered to her tense fingers.

A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

"Something interesting."

Anna instantly understood his implication.

Her ears flushed pink.

She shoved the car door open.

"I'm walking!"
###Chapter 20

Anna Ross pushed the car door open.

She had one foot out.

Adrian Sinclair lunged forward.

He grabbed her wrist.

Anna was yanked back into the car.

Adrian loomed over her instantly.

She struggled to push him away.

He only pressed down harder.

Adrian shifted, seizing her other hand.

He pinned both her wrists above her head with one hand.

Anna was powerless to resist.

He slammed the car door shut.

The driver stared, stunned, through the rearview mirror.

He hesitated before speaking.

“The young lady doesn’t seem willing to go with you.”

Adrian shot the driver a cold glance.

“Can’t you tell it’s a lovers’ quarrel?”

“Drive.”

The driver, intimidated by his aura, quickly started the car.

Anna’s heart ached sharply at the word “lovers.”

It was true once.

But not anymore.

She suddenly became aware of their humiliating position.

She was lying flat on the seat.

Her hands were pinned above her head.

Her ankles were gripped firmly by him.

Adrian leaned in closer.

His warm breath brushed her ear.

“Still trying to run?”

“The more you run, the tighter I’ll hold on.”

The air in the car grew thick and tense.

Anna turned her face away.

Her wrists ached.

“I won’t run.”

“Let me go.”

Adrian’s fingers trailed along her leg.

“Why should I let go?”

“Isn’t this what you wanted?”

His voice was low and husky.

“Last time, you dressed like that to seduce me.”

A shiver ran through Anna’s body.

“Don’t bring up the past.”

“I’m not feeling well right now.”

“Please let me go.”

Adrian moved even closer.

A low chuckle echoed in the car.

“What if I don’t?”

Anna had nowhere to retreat.

She suddenly jerked her knee upward.

Adrian grunted in pain.

His grip loosened.

Anna scrambled to the car door.

Adrian braced himself against the seat.

His brow was furrowed.

His gaze was icy and terrifying.

Anna didn’t dare look at him.

She seemed to have hit a sensitive spot.

He probably wanted to kill her now.
###Chapter 21

Adrian Sinclair took a long time to recover from the intense pain.

He adjusted his collar expressionlessly and leaned back into his seat.

His slender fingers pressed against his temples as he closed his eyes to rest.

A fine sense of guilt stirred within Anna Ross.

The memory of his pained expression lingered in her mind.

Had she been too harsh?

But he had been the one to act like a jerk first.

It wasn't entirely her fault.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

Anna was startled.

It was a call from her mother.

She cleared her throat, trying to keep her voice steady.

"Mom."

Vivian Lowell sounded anxious.

"Anna, why aren't you home yet?"

Anna glanced at Adrian.

Her fingers tightened around the phone.

"I'm working overtime. I might be very late tonight."

In truth, when she could leave depended entirely on Adrian's mood.

But she had to lie.

The guilt of lying made her voice tremble.

Vivian sighed in relief.

"Even if work is busy, you need to take care of your health. Come home early."

A wave of sorrow washed over Anna.

She sniffled.

"I know. Please go to sleep and don't wait for me."

She wanted nothing more than to go home early.

After a few more words of advice, the call ended.

Anna stared at the night scenery rushing past the window.

A sense of powerlessness overwhelmed her.

She fought back tears.

Adrian's cold laugh broke the silence.

"Lies come so easily to you. Is that how you deceived your Sugar Daddy too?"

His gaze was disdainful, as if looking at something filthy.

Anna's face turned pale.

Her suppressed emotions finally broke through.

Tears streamed down her pale cheeks.

She wiped them away roughly.

Her voice was cold.

"Stop the car. I want to go home."

Adrian's eyes turned even colder.

"Keep driving!"

The driver broke into a cold sweat, not daring to disobey.

Anna completely broke down.

"I'm just an Executive Assistant! I didn't sell myself to you!"

The driver glanced back in shock, but a cold look from Adrian made him quickly turn away.

"I'll do whatever I want."

He gritted his teeth.

"If you don't want Howard Lowell to find out anything, behave yourself."

Anna was furious.

What else did he know how to do besides threaten her?
###Chapter 22

Anna Ross took a deep breath.

She forced herself to calm down.

She met Adrian Sinclair's gaze.

She spoke each word with perfect clarity.

"Adrian Sinclair."

"Three years ago, I was the one who left you."

"It was my fault."

"But I don't regret it."

"Even if you are rich and powerful now."

"I still won't like you."

The air instantly froze.

Time seemed to stop flowing.

Adrian Sinclair turned his head sharply to look at her.

The aura around him turned frigid and dark.

Terrifying fury churned in the depths of his eyes.

He suddenly raised his hand.

His fingers wrapped around her slender neck.

His dark pupils were like deep, icy pools.

Chillingly suffocating.

His voice trembled uncontrollably.

"Well said."

"You are absolutely incredible."

Anna coughed violently.

Looking into his bloodshot eyes, her instinct to struggle suddenly faded.

She slowly closed her eyes.

If he truly wanted to strangle her, perhaps it would be a release for both of them.

After a long time, the pressure on her neck suddenly released.

Anna gasped for fresh air.

For that one moment, she truly thought she would die by his hand.

Adrian had regained his composure.

Only his expression remained cold and terrifying.

His voice was as clear and cold as ice.

"Stop the car."

The driver immediately hit the brakes.

The tires screeched against the pavement.

The car came to a steady stop by the roadside.

Anna gathered her wits slightly.

A trace of relief flashed in her eyes.

Was he getting out?

"Get out."

Adrian spoke coldly again.

Anna didn't react at first.

She stared at him blankly.

The driver whispered a reminder.

"Miss."

"He's telling you to get out..."

He had been driving on edge this whole trip.

These two had been arguing since they got in the car.

Anna finally understood.

He was kicking her out of the car.

Adrian glanced at her sideways.

His eyes were icy, devoid of any warmth.

His tone was extremely impatient.

"Don't you understand?"

"I said get out."

Anna didn't dare say another word.

She pushed the car door open and stepped out.

The moment she found her footing, the door slammed shut.

The car sped away.

It quickly disappeared from her sight.

She looked around.

A slight frown creased her brow.

This was clearly the cab she had hailed.

Why was she the one getting kicked out?

Then she sighed in relief.

None of that mattered.

Being away from him was what counted.

But now it was the dead of night.

She needed to get home quickly.

Otherwise, her mother would worry and lose sleep.

She wondered if she could even get another cab.

Adrian leaned back in the car seat.

He covered his eyes with one hand.

His breathing was heavy and suppressed.

After a moment, he suddenly clenched his fists.

He slammed them hard against the seat.

His eyes were a frightening shade of red.

Anna Ross.

How could you be so cruel?

The driver was startled.

After a moment's hesitation, he spoke up to comfort him.

"Man."

"Fighting is normal."

"Don't take it too hard."

"Your girlfriend will definitely come back to you in a couple of days."

Even though he didn't understand kicking one's girlfriend out of the car, he could sense the other man's anger.

And his sorrow.

Men understand men best.
###Chapter 23

Adrian Sinclair's gaze was icy cold.

He ignored the other man's words completely.

Anna Ross stood by the roadside.

The night wind tangled her hair.

She waited a long time.

Finally, she hailed a taxi.

She opened the door and slid inside.

Exhausted, she leaned back against the seat.

She needed to get home quickly.

The late-night streets were empty and silent.

She wondered if her mother was already asleep.

When she reached the manor, the living room lights were still on.

Her heart tightened.

She quickened her steps into the house.

Vivian Lowell sat alone on the sofa.

Her figure looked frail.

Anna's nose stung with emotion.

Her mother had waited up for her again.

She took a steadying breath.

"Mom, I'm home," she called out softly.

Vivian turned at the sound.

A relieved smile touched her lips.

She stood and approached her daughter.

She gently smoothed Anna's hair.

"Anna, why were you working so late tonight?"

Worry filled Vivian's eyes.

She suspected Howard Lowell had given Anna a hard time.

Anna guided her mother back to the sofa.

"It was a data issue," she explained quietly.

"It needed to be fixed tonight."

She hid the conflict with Adrian.

She didn't want her mother to worry.

"I'm just glad you're home."

Vivian took her bag.

"Go get cleaned up and rest."

Suddenly, a cold voice came from the stairs.

"Why are you back?"

Howard Lowell descended.

Vivian's face instantly paled.

Her body trembled slightly.

Anna gripped her mother's hand tightly.

She met Howard's gaze.

"Isn't it stranger to not come home this late?"

Her tone was calm, but her eyes held an edge.

Howard studied her.

He casually crossed his legs.

"Adrian Sinclair took you away."

"I thought you wouldn't be returning."

Anna's fingers trembled slightly.

A cold feeling spread through her heart.

In the eyes of her nominal father, they were just pawns.

Vivian looked at her daughter in surprise.

She realized Anna had lied.

Howard continued his interrogation.

"Who did Adrian Sinclair meet today?"

Anna lowered her eyes.

"We did nothing," she whispered.

She wanted no part in this power struggle.

She only craved a peaceful life.

But fate never gave her a choice.
###Chapter 24

Howard Lowell nodded in satisfaction.

He thought Anna Ross was referring to Adrian Sinclair's restrained behavior today.

He lit a cigarette.

His cunning eyes narrowed through the haze of smoke.

"You will stay by his side from now on."

"Monitor his every move."

He blew out a smoke ring.

"Of course."

"If you can win him over."

"That would be perfect."

It would make his plans much easier to execute.

Anna felt a wave of disgust at his words.

She wanted to argue back.

But her mother held her hands tightly.

Vivian Lowell shook her head slightly.

Warning her not to act impulsively.

Anna sighed helplessly.

"Adrian Sinclair would never trust me."

"I am your person."

"How could he possibly let me know his affairs?"

"This is something I cannot do."

Howard's face darkened instantly.

He stood up abruptly.

Spat on the floor.

"Vivian Lowell!"

"Look at your wonderful daughter!"

"You are useless!"

"She is even more useless than you!"

"How dare she defy me!"

Vivian watched fearfully as he approached.

She tried her best to shield her daughter behind her.

"Anna is just worried."

"She doesn't mean to defy you."

Anna's heart ached seeing her mother humiliated.

Her eyes reddened slightly.

Howard shoved Vivian aside.

He glared at Anna with a sinister warning.

"Your lives are in my hands."

"You have no choice."

"You must do as I say."

"Or you can both get out of this house."

He shot a cold glare at Vivian.

Kicked the coffee table.

Then turned and went upstairs.

Vivian closed her eyes.

Tears streamed down her cheeks.

She pulled her dazed daughter close.

"Anna."

"Please listen to him this time."

"Just do as he says, okay?"

Anna didn't understand why her mother insisted on staying.

But her mother was her closest family.

She couldn't lose her.

Her mind was in turmoil.

She held her mother's hand tightly.

"Mom..."

Vivian nearly broke down sobbing.

She blamed herself for being incompetent.

For making her daughter suffer.

But she quickly composed herself.

"Anna."

"Promise Mom, okay?"

"Or I will kneel down and beg you."

Seeing her about to kneel.

Anna quickly pulled her up.

Her heart filled with sorrow.

She had no choice but to nod in agreement.

"I will listen to you."

"Mom."

Vivian looked at her daughter gratefully.

"Anna."

"Thank you."

"Thank you for understanding Mom."

She hated herself for not being able to protect her daughter.

But she had no other choice.

Anna wiped her mother's tears away.

"Mom."

"Don't worry."

"I won't let anyone hurt you."

A determined glint flashed in her eyes.

She silently vowed to take her mother away from here.

To never let anyone oppress them again.

After Vivian fell asleep.

Anna dragged her exhausted body back to her room.

She tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep.

She remembered Adrian's bloodshot eyes.

The resentment and anger in his gaze.

Anna smiled bitterly.

After all this time, he still hadn't let go.

Perhaps she had hurt him too deeply back then.

That was why he hated her so much.

But maybe it was for the best.

He wouldn't come looking for her for a while.
###Chapter 25

Anna Ross was jolted awake by a shrill ringing.

She kept her eyes closed, fumbling under her pillow for her phone.

The screen displayed an unknown number.

She hung up out of habit.

Rolling over, she pulled the blankets tighter.

She had been awake until dawn last night.

All she wanted now was more sleep.

Her phone vibrated again.

She dismissed it with irritation.

The ringing started a third time.

Anna snatched up her phone.

"Who is this, disturbing my sleep so early?!"

She yelled, her voice thick with sleep.

Silence answered from the other end.

A sudden chill ran down Anna's spine.

She instinctively pulled the blankets closer.

"Anna Ross, did you just yell at me?"

An icy voice cut through the receiver.

She was instantly wide awake.

It was Adrian Sinclair.

She scrambled for an excuse.

"I was just talking in my sleep..."

Her voice betrayed her guilt.

Adrian cut her off coldly.

"An Executive Assistant should have some awareness."

"Get up for work. Now."

Anna glanced at the clock. It was only six.

She cursed him inwardly as a ruthless boss.

Outwardly, she answered with deference.

"Okay. I'm getting up right now."

"You have fifteen minutes to meet me."

The call ended abruptly.

She leapt from bed and rushed into the bathroom.

Fifteen minutes later, she was sprinting out the door.

Adrian was leaning against his car, waiting.

His long legs were crossed in a lazy posture.

His gaze swept over her flustered appearance.

"Get in."

He commanded simply.

Anna obediently slid into the passenger seat.

The car headed in an unfamiliar direction.

She looked uneasily at the driver's seat.

"This isn't the way to the office?"

Adrian signaled a turn.

"You'll find out when we arrive."
###Chapter 26

Anna Ross looked warily at the man in the driver's seat.

Weren't they supposed to go to the company?

What trick was he trying to pull now?

The black Mercedes-Benz came to a smooth stop.

Anna looked out the window.

It was an entirely unfamiliar, upscale club.

Adrian Sinclair unbuckled his seatbelt, a playful smirk curling his lips.

"Taking you to a college reunion today."

He said it lightly, as if it were the most ordinary thing.

Anna's face instantly paled.

Her fingers tightened around the seatbelt.

She didn't want to go at all.

"Get out."

Adrian tapped impatiently on the window.

Anna shook her head desperately, shrinking back into the car.

The car door was yanked open.

Adrian grabbed her wrist firmly.

He leaned in close, his warm breath brushing her ear.

"If you don't want to walk yourself, I don't mind carrying you in."

Anna looked up and met his bottomless gaze.

Her heart gave a violent jolt.

She quickly lowered her head.

She knew he meant every word.

She shook off his hand forcefully.

Anna gritted her teeth. "I'll walk myself."

Adrian's lips curved in satisfaction.

"Good."

Anna got out of the car, her lips bitten white.

She hadn't seen any of her college classmates since that incident.

He brought her here specifically to humiliate her publicly.

Adrian strode forward.

Anna followed silently.

The private room was already buzzing with activity.

The class monitor greeted them warmly.

"Adrian, you finally made it! Thought we wouldn't see you again this year."

Adrian smiled faintly.

"Had some free time today."

All eyes turned to the two of them.

Whispers immediately broke out.

"They're still together? I really didn't expect that!"

"They were the sweetest couple back in school. Probably getting married soon?"

Lucas Evans suddenly interrupted the conversation.

"Don't guess wildly. They broke up a long time ago."

Everyone looked unconvinced.

"How is that possible? They came together."

Lucas was also full of doubt.

Last time, Anna had personally admitted they had broken up.

Anna quietly took a step to the side.

Trying to create some distance.

Adrian shot her a cold glance.

"Stand closer."

Everyone immediately fell silent.

Anna clenched the hem of her clothes and stiffly moved back to his side.

Adrian's lips curled with satisfaction.

He reached out and lifted her chin teasingly.

"Don't forget you're here to serve me."

Everyone was stunned.

What kind of roleplay was this?

Anna swatted his hand away.

Suppressing her humiliation, she silently retreated to the side.

Adrian rubbed his fingers together, giving her a faint glance.

Just then, a clear male voice rang out.

"Anna."

Anna looked up.

Lucas was walking towards her with a smile.

Unmistakable surprise was written all over his face.
###Chapter 27

Lucas Evans's appearance shocked everyone present.

No one expected him to come.

He never attended class reunions before.

But today, he showed up unexpectedly.

People whispered and murmured among themselves.

Lucas seemed not to hear any of it.

He walked directly toward Anna Ross.

His gaze fell gently upon her.

"Anna, long time no see."

His voice was as gentle as ever.

Anna looked up.

Lucas was smiling at her.

Sunlight fell on his slightly curly hair.

Those captivating eyes curved into a pleasant arc.

His expression radiated warmth.

He was still the same as he was in college.

Completely unchanged.

Anna returned his smile.

"Long time no see."

Adrian Sinclair shot Lucas a cold glance.

His eyes held a scrutinizing edge.

Lucas gave Adrian a slight nod.

Then he turned his attention back to Anna.

"Anna, there's been no news from you these past few years."

"I thought you had gone abroad."

"It's really good to see you again."

"How have you been these past two years?"

Anna paused for a moment.

Then she smiled.

"Thank you for your concern. I've been doing quite well."

"And you? I heard after graduation, you've been..."

Adrian suddenly cleared his throat lightly.

The air around them instantly turned cold.

Anna's smile faded.

She quietly closed her mouth.

Lucas seemed unaware of the tension.

He spoke gently.

"Just getting by. As long as I can manage, it's fine."

Anna smiled slightly.

She didn't continue the conversation.

The class monitor saw that almost everyone had arrived.

He urged everyone to take their seats.

"We're all classmates here. Don't stand on ceremony. Sit wherever you like!"

Lucas reached out to pull out a chair for Anna.

But his movement halted mid-air.

He pulled out a chair.

Speaking softly to Anna.

"Let's sit down first."

Anna instinctively glanced at Adrian.

She quickly waved her hand.

"You go ahead and sit. I'm fine."

According to Adrian's requirements.

She was here to serve.

She wasn't qualified to sit.

Lucas looked at her, puzzled.

Everyone else had taken their seats.

Only three empty chairs remained.

Adrian leisurely sat down next to Anna.

Lucas sat on her other side.

A seat was left empty between them.

Anna remained standing.

Lucas asked with concern.

"Are you feeling unwell?"

Adrian played with his wine glass.

He wore an expression of amusement.

The others also stared curiously at Anna.

From the moment she entered.

They had sensed something was off about her today.

The atmosphere became awkward all at once.

The class monitor couldn't help but speak up.

"Is something bothering you?"

Other classmates joined in.

"You rarely come to these gatherings."

"We're all really happy to see you."

"Please, sit down!"

Anna clenched the hem of her clothes tightly.

Her lips were bitten until they turned pale.

But she couldn't find the words to speak.

She couldn't very well say that Adrian forbade her from sitting.

Everyone seemed determined not to let it go until she sat.

Anna was caught in a difficult position.

Adrian rubbed his ring.

He spoke with calm composure.

"There's no need to ask."

"She is currently my Executive Assistant."

"She is here to serve me."

"Therefore, she must remain standing."

The room instantly fell into complete silence.
###Chapter 28

Anna Ross closed her eyes.

Her classmates' stares pierced her like needles.

Lucas Evans stood up abruptly.

He glared at Adrian Sinclair. "Who gave you the right to stop Anna from sitting?"

His voice was thick with suppressed anger.

Adrian gave him a dismissive glance.

"What gives you the right to question me?" His tone was icy cold. "It's not worth offending me over a woman."

Lucas clenched his fists.

Anger flashed across his usually gentle face for the first time.

Their eyes locked.

Sparks seemed to fly between them.

The classmates quickly tried to defuse the tension.

"It's a class reunion today. Let's not talk about work." "Let Anna sit down." Everyone chimed in agreement.

Only then did Adrian look away.

He spoke indifferently. "Sit." It sounded like a condescending allowance.

Anna sat down with her head lowered.

The reunion officially began.

The class president raised a glass for a toast.

The atmosphere became lively again.

Lucas placed a piece of ribs onto her plate.

"Eat something." His voice was gentle. "You must be hungry."

Anna thanked him softly.

She picked up her fork and knife.

Her stomach was growling with hunger.

Adrian suddenly tapped the table.

"Get me some food." He commanded. "The wine is also empty. Pour more."

Anna paused her movement.

She reached for the wine bottle.

Lucas stopped her.

He looked at Adrian. "Don't you have hands?" His tone was sarcastic. "Do you need others to serve you?"

Anna shook her head anxiously.

She didn't want Lucas to offend him.

But Lucas remained unmoved.

Adrian's gaze turned cold.

He stood up abruptly and pulled Anna towards him.

She fell into his arms unexpectedly.

The classmates gasped in surprise.

Anna hurriedly tried to sit up straight.

But Adrian held her tightly, refusing to let go.

Lucas grabbed her other hand.

Tension crackled between the two men.

Their stares felt like they were tearing her apart.

"I need to use the restroom." She broke free from both of them.

She fled the private room as if escaping.

Adrian watched her retreating figure.

His eyes were deep and unreadable.

A classmate joked, "If I didn't know better, I'd think you two were a couple." Everyone cautiously observed Adrian's reaction.

He merely curved his lips slightly.

Adrian looked at Lucas provocatively.

His gaze gradually sharpened.

He was certain Lucas had ulterior motives towards Anna.
###Chapter 29

Lucas Evans met his challenging gaze.

He couldn't shake the feeling Adrian Sinclair was performing.
Putting on a show just for him.

"I need to take this call."
Lucas excused himself from the group.
He rose from his seat and left.

Adrian leaned back into his chair.
A shadow fell over his eyes.

Anna Ross rushed into the restroom.
She splashed cold water on her face.
Trying to wash away the humiliation Adrian had inflicted.

She looked up at the mirror.
The reflection showed disheveled hair.
A pale complexion.
Not even a trace of lipstick.
She had been in too much of a hurry this morning.
There was no time to prepare.
This disheveled appearance.
Was utterly embarrassing.

"Whatever."
She whispered to comfort herself.
"None of this matters anyway."

She finished washing her hands.
And prepared to leave.

Lucas stepped out of the private room.
He searched for Anna.
He had so many questions for her.
How had she been these past two years.
What exactly was going on with Adrian.
If Adrian was treating her poorly.
Then he...

"Lucas?"

Anna emerged from the restroom.
Surprised to see him.

She instinctively smoothed her hair.
Trying to hide her disarray.

Lucas watched her silently.
His heart ached.
His nose tingled with emotion.
He wanted to hold her.
To tell her she could lean on him.
But in the end, he only smiled.

"Don't bother."
His voice was gentle.
"You look beautiful just like this."

Anna paused.
Her hands dropped to her sides.
"Sorry."
She forced a smile.
"I didn't have time to get ready today."

"You're overthinking it."
Lucas maintained his smile.
"You're the most beautiful even without any preparation."

"Thanks for the consolation."

Anna lifted the corners of her mouth.
But the smile didn't reach her eyes.

Lucas's fingers trembled slightly.
He curled them into a fist.
"These past two years..."
He hesitated.
"How have you been?"

He still didn't dare ask about Adrian.

Anna laughed softly.
"Pretty good."
She said.
"After graduation, I stayed with my mom."
"Found a job."
"Everything's been fine."

Lucas watched her smile.
It felt like a mask.
He wanted to tear it away to see the truth.

"Enough about me."
Anna started walking forward.
"What about you?"
She remembered their earlier unfinished conversation.

Lucas kept pace with her.
He sighed quietly.
"My last two years have been rather legendary."
He tried to lighten the mood.
"Want to hear about it?"

Anna's interest was piqued.
"How legendary?"

"Well, that's a long story..."
###Chapter 30

Anna Ross curved her lips into a faint smile.

Lucas Evans was clearly holding back information.

It had been so long since she last felt this lighthearted.

......

The gathering was in full swing.

Someone came to invite Adrian Sinclair for a drink.

He wasn't in the mood.

His gaze remained fixed on the two empty seats.

Why was she taking so long?

Adrian irritably loosened his tie.

He stood up and left the table.

He walked toward the restroom with a cold smirk.

Two familiar figures came into view.

Anna was leaning against Lucas's chest.

Rage instantly surged in Adrian's eyes.

His hands clenched into tight fists.

Lucas supported a unsteady Anna.

Panic was still written across his face.

His voice was tense. "Anna, are you okay? I'll take you to the hospital!"

Anna shook her head.

"It's nothing. I probably just skipped breakfast."

She struggled to stand straight.

She tried to lean against the wall.

She wanted to avoid any misunderstanding.

Lucas reached out to steady her.

Her sudden dizziness had frightened him.

"Anna Ross, I underestimated you."

"You said you were going to the restroom."

"But you're actually here having a secret rendezvous."

"Are you that desperate?"

Adrian's sarcastic voice cut through the air.

Anna whirled around.

She saw him standing behind them with a cold expression.

Her eyes widened in alarm.

She quickly stepped back.

Putting distance between herself and Lucas.

She couldn't drag Lucas into trouble again.

But the action looked like guilt in Adrian's eyes.

Adrian strode closer.

He turned his head to look at Anna.

His icy gaze burned her, forcing her to look down.

He was taller than Lucas.

An intimidating chill radiated from him.

"Anna Ross, you're truly despicable."

Lucas couldn't take it anymore.

"Enough, Adrian!"

"Anna almost fainted. I was just helping her."

"How dare you humiliate her?"

Adrian scoffed.

"How dare I?"

"She belongs to me."

"I can do whatever I want with her."

"Why is an outsider meddling?"

The word "outsider" stung Lucas.

He gritted his teeth. "If you bully her again, I won't hold back!"

A dangerous glint flashed in Adrian's eyes.

He grabbed Lucas by the collar.

Lucas immediately seized his wrist in return.

Anna pleaded in fear. "Stop this, please!"

She was afraid of causing a scene.

But neither man seemed to hear her.

The tension between them remained high.

Anna stepped forward.

She forcefully pulled Lucas's hand away.

Then she grabbed Adrian and dragged him in the opposite direction.

"Come with me!"

Surprisingly, Adrian actually obeyed.

Lucas stood frozen.

Watching them walk away.

Anna had just breathed a sigh of relief.

When Adrian suddenly twisted his wrist.

He seized her.

And pulled her toward the stairwell.

Before she could react.

He pinned her hard against the wall.
###Chapter 31

Anna Ross's back hit the cold wall.

She shuddered.

She looked at the man before her in terror. "What do you think you're doing?"

Fear pricked at every pore like fine needles.

This was a hallway.

Someone could walk by at any moment.

She pushed against him with all her strength.

Adrian Sinclair didn't budge.

He pressed closer instead.

He leaned in, his face nearing hers.

His gaze was dark.

His voice was hoarse. "Doing what?"

He let out a light laugh. "Giving you what you want, of course."

His eyes swept over her body with insolence.

His fingers lifted her chin.

He stroked it slowly.

Anna's eyes reddened with anger. "You're shameless!"

She turned her face away.

He forcefully turned it back.

She was forced to look directly into his deep eyes.

"Me? Shameless?" His tone was furious. "Why don't you take a look at yourself?"

He sneered. "You're quite skilled at seducing men."

His fingers tightened.

Anna gasped in pain.

"Got tired of the old one, so you moved on to a younger one so quickly?" He moved closer. "He seems to care about you a lot?"

She opened her mouth.

She wanted to explain.

But meeting his sinister gaze.

She swallowed all her words.

It was useless to speak.

He never believed her.

He would only humiliate her further.

Adrian saw her silence.

An inexplicable irritation rose in him.

He would rather she argued.

Even if she lied.

This calm felt like a silent mockery.

He glared at her fiercely. "Speak!"

Anna lowered her eyes.

She refused to look at him anymore.

A dangerous glint flashed in Adrian's eyes.

He suddenly lowered his head and kissed her.

He forced her lips apart roughly.

The kiss felt like a punishment.

A疯狂掠夺.

It brooked no refusal.

Anna was pinned against the wall.

Her hands were restrained by his.

Their fingers tangled together.

There was no escape.

His kiss held no tenderness.

The back of her head knocked against the hard wall.

It hurt.

A bitter taste rose in her heart.

Forget it.

Consider it atonement.

She closed her eyes.

She stopped struggling.

Adrian sensed her submission.

He paused.

An inexplicable anger flared within him.

His hand slid under her clothes.

It caressed the soft skin of her waist.

Anna let out a soft moan.

Her body trembled slightly.

Adrian chuckled lowly.

His fingertips teased as they wandered.

A blush spread across Anna's cheeks.

Her legs felt weak.

Her consciousness grew hazy.

She felt like a small boat on turbulent waves.

What was more shameful.

Was that she actively wrapped her arms around his shoulders.

Adrian's breathing grew heavier.

His lips moved from the corner of her mouth.

He kissed her chin.

Her neck.

Her collarbone.

Leaving behind searing marks.

Finally.

His burning gaze landed on her chest.

He reached out to tear at her collar.
###Chapter 32

"Anna!"

A voice pierced the silence.

Anna Ross snapped back to reality.

A cool breeze brushed against her skin.

She realized with horror that her blouse had come undone.

Pale skin was exposed to the air.

Footsteps approached from a distance.

Anna looked up in panic.

She struggled to push Adrian Sinclair away.

The man didn't budge.

Adrian gripped her wrists.

His deep eyes burned with intense fire.

He lowered his head and bit her earlobe.

His voice was low and dangerous. "Keep struggling, and I'll let everyone see."

Anna froze instantly.

She curled into his chest, not daring to move.

Her eyes remained fixed on the outside.

Lucas Evans' voice was now dangerously close.

"Anna, are you there?"

Anna squeezed her eyes shut.

Her fingers dug into Adrian's arm.

The footsteps paused for a moment.

Finally, they faded into the distance.

She let out a long breath.

Her hands hurriedly adjusted her clothing.

Adrian released her.

His fingers absently traced his platinum signet ring.

His tone was icy. "Stay away from other men."

Anna turned her face away.

She fastened the last button.

Her voice was distant. "Does the CEO even control his assistant's personal life?"

Adrian's eyes darkened.

"You know what happens if you disobey."

He turned and walked away.

Anna bit her lip, glaring at him.

The man looked impeccably dressed and composed.

She was left disheveled and humiliated.

She forced herself to stay calm.

Quickly, she followed him.

After only a few steps, dizziness overwhelmed her.

Cold sweat instantly soaked through her back.

Her heart raced uncontrollably.

Her limbs began to tremble without command.

Adrian's figure grew increasingly blurry.

She reached out, trying to grab something.

But her hand met empty air.

Complete darkness swallowed her vision.

Adrian noticed the silence behind him.

He turned back impatiently, then his pupils contracted sharply.

Anna lay pale and collapsed on the ground.

His heart clenched violently.

He rushed over and gathered her into his arms.
###Chapter 33

Adrian Sinclair scooped Anna Ross into his arms and rushed toward the parking lot.

Her face was deathly pale, her breathing faint.

His arms tightened around her. His voice was strained. "Anna, hold on. The hospital is close."

He gently placed her in the passenger seat.

He floored the accelerator.

The sports car roared into the traffic.

His knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel.

He burst through the ER doors, holding her.

White coats quickly surrounded them.

His voice was hoarse. "She collapsed suddenly. Please, help her!"

A doctor motioned for him to calm down.

The gurney wheels rattled urgently into the distance.

The emergency light glowed red.

Adrian leaned against the wall.

His gaze was locked on those doors.

The light went out.

He immediately stepped forward.

The doctor removed his mask, frowning. "It's a coma induced by low blood sugar."

"She must eat breakfast regularly from now on."

"Otherwise, it could be life-threatening."

Adrian froze.

He remembered how she had curled up.

He remembered Lucas Evans's supporting arm.

It wasn't intimacy. It was support.

He had misunderstood her.

The drip made a soft sound in the quiet room.

Anna lay on the white sheets.

She looked as fragile as fine china.

His fingertips lightly brushed her cold cheek.

His eyes were dark and deep.

Her eyelashes fluttered.

She slowly opened her eyes.

She took in her surroundings.

Her gaze settled on him. "Why am I in the hospital?"

He quickly pulled his hand back.

His tone was cold and hard. "I brought you."

"I wouldn't have bothered if I wasn't concerned about a death affecting work."

She tried to sit up and remove the IV. "I'm sorry for delaying work..."

He pressed her hand down firmly. "If you want to die, don't do it in front of me."

"Finish the IV. You need to recover to keep working."

She lay back in silence.

She looked like a butterfly drenched by the rain.
###Chapter 34

Adrian Sinclair released his grip and sat back in the chair.

The hospital room fell into silence.

The nutrient solution dripped away, drop by drop.

Anna Ross stared blankly at the IV tube.

The medicine bottle was soon empty.

Adrian pressed the call button.

A nurse hurried in.

He stepped back toward the window to give her space.

The nurse deftly removed the needle.

Anna hissed softly and pressed down on the cotton swab.

"Remember to eat on time." The nurse gathered her equipment. "You might not be so lucky next time."

Anna looked down and murmured an agreement.

The nurse glanced at Adrian before leaving with her tray.

Anna pushed herself up and slipped on her shoes.

Some color had returned to her cheeks after the IV.

But a dizzy weakness remained.

Adrian watched coldly as she swayed unsteadily.

"The medical fees will be deducted from your salary." His voice was icy. "Remember to eat if you don't want to lose money."

Anna's head snapped up.

"You called at six! I had fifteen minutes to get to the company!" She trembled with anger. "When was I supposed to eat?"

The intense emotion made her vision swim.

Adrian turned his head away, silent.

Anna gripped the sheets, trying to steady her breathing.

The thought of her savings being deducted made her bite her lip. "This counts as a work-related injury. You should pay."

Adrian stepped closer.

His shadow fell over her.

"Does the money from selling luxury goods not cover it?" He sneered. "Stop pretending to be poor."

Her heart ached, but she only said quietly, "I'm not feeling well. I need to take leave."

"Low blood sugar won't kill you." Adrian turned away. "Get back to work."

Anna laughed bitterly.

So in his eyes, as long as she wasn't dead, she had to work.

Tormenting her was his only goal.

"Adrian Sinclair." Her voice shook. "Do you hate me that much?"

Enough to destroy everything she had.

Enough to only be satisfied seeing her suffer.

Adrian's back stiffened.

His fingers clenched at his sides.

"Yes." His voice was like frozen steel. "You deserve it."

The door slammed shut behind him.

Anna slowly curled into herself.
###Chapter 35

Anna Ross lowered her gaze.

Her fingertips discreetly wiped away the moisture at the corners of her eyes.

She didn't understand what she was still hoping for.

Some expectations were destined to bring only deeper pain.

She supported herself on the edge of the hospital bed and slowly stood up.

Her body was still so weak it trembled.

She walked out of the hospital room.

The hallway was empty, devoid of Adrian Sinclair's presence.

Anna's heart clenched.

Had he already left?

She forced a bitter smile.

Leaning against the wall, she slowly made her way out.

Outside the hospital entrance.

The black Mercedes-Benz sat silently.

Adrian was already in the driver's seat.

The sharp lines of his profile were cold and unreadable.

Anna paused for a moment where she stood.

Finally, she pulled the car door open and got in.

"So slow."

"What a nuisance."

Adrian glanced at her.

His eyes held no warmth whatsoever.

Anna closed her eyes, refusing to look at him.

Her hands unconsciously pressed against her abdomen.

Although she had received an IV drip.

The prolonged hunger still caused sharp pains in her stomach.

Adrian noticed her pale complexion.

He casually tossed a paper bag toward her.

"Don't die in my car."

Anna opened the paper bag.

Inside was a still-warm breakfast.

She silently picked up the food and began eating in small bites.

She had been hungry for too long.

She ate a little too quickly.

Her cheeks puffed out slightly.

Adrian's gaze flickered over her.

A barely perceptible shift passed through his eyes.

But it quickly returned to ice.

Anna stole a glance at him.

This was the first time she had looked properly at his profile since their reunion.

He was still heartbreakingly handsome.

But colder and more distant than she remembered.

That once gentle young man.

Had truly vanished.

The sunlight through the car window stung her eyes.

She hurriedly tilted her head back.

And continued eating mechanically.

Anna made a vow to herself.

One day, she would leave him completely.

And never see him again.

The car came to a smooth stop.

Adrian's voice was devoid of emotion.

"Get out."

Anna gathered her trash.

She pushed the door open but froze in place.

They were right in front of her apartment complex.

"Don't I need to go to work?"

She asked hesitantly.

Had he suddenly softened?

Adrian gave her a cold look.

"You look terrible."

"Do you want to be responsible for scaring the clients?"

He paused before adding.

"Be available on call during your rest."

"Don't even think about slacking off."

The car sped away.

The slender figure in the rearview mirror grew smaller and smaller.

Adrian's fingers tightened slightly on the steering wheel.

She had asked if he truly hated her.

That question echoed repeatedly in his mind.

Had he gone too far?

Anna stood still, lost in thought.

She only turned to walk home after the taillights disappeared around the corner.

Vivian Lowell was arranging flowers in the living room.

She had picked these flowers with her daughter.

She trimmed them with extra care.

A gentle smile graced her lips.

She looked up at the sound of the door opening.

Her face first lit up with delight at seeing her daughter.

Then she noticed Anna's pale complexion.

She immediately put down the scissors and hurried over.
###Chapter 36

Anna Ross gently touched her cheek.

She didn't mention fainting.

She didn't want her mother to worry more.

"It's just work exhaustion," she said, forcing a smile as she guided Vivian Lowell to the sofa.

Her body felt weak, and standing too long made her dizzy.

Vivian immediately frowned.

"I told you not to overwork yourself," she scolded gently. "Your health comes first."

Anna leaned into her mother's embrace.

"I know," she murmured softly. "I'll be more careful."

Only with her mother could she truly relax.

Vivian patted her back.

Her movements were as gentle as soothing a baby.

"How could I ever be angry with you," she sighed.

Anna's nose tingled with emotion.

Her desire to escape grew stronger.

"Has Adrian Sinclair been giving you trouble?" Vivian suddenly asked.

She held her daughter at arm's length, studying her face.

Anna squeezed her mother's hand.

"No," she said firmly. "It really is just work fatigue."

Vivian finally relaxed.

Anna smiled quietly to herself.

She could never reveal the truth.

Otherwise, her mother would blame herself even more.

"Where is he?" Anna glanced around.

Howard Lowell was nowhere to be seen.

Vivian's expression darkened.

Pain stabbed through her heart.

Tears welled in her eyes.

Guilt threatened to overwhelm her.

She had failed her daughter in so many ways.

"Mom?" Anna noticed her distress.

She quickly reached for tissues.

Vivian turned away.

"He went out," she said quietly. "Don't worry."

Anna breathed a sigh of relief.

At least she wouldn't have to face her stepfather's interrogation.

Vivian suddenly embraced her daughter.

"Anna," her voice choked with emotion. "You've suffered so much."

Anna gently patted her mother's back.

"It's alright," she comforted softly. "We'll leave this place soon."

She could endure any hardship for their freedom.

A phone suddenly rang.
###Chapter 37

Vivian Lowell released her embrace.

Anna Ross looked down at her phone.
The screen showed an incoming call from Mia Lawrence.
She wiped away her tears.
She steadied her breathing and answered.

"Mia?"
Mia's voice was cheerful. "Anna! That apartment you mentioned last time is available!"
Anna's eyes lit up.
She had almost forgotten about her search for a new place.

"Really?"
Mia laughed. "It's in high demand. Do you want to see it now?"
Anna's heart raced.
She could finally take her mother away from here.

"I'll be right..."
She didn't finish her sentence.
Her phone was snatched away by Vivian.
The call ended abruptly.

Anna stared in shock.
"Mom, that was Mia."
Vivian shoved the phone back into her hand.
Her expression was grave.

"Don't waste your effort."
Anna gripped her phone tightly.
"We can move out together."
Vivian shook her head.

"I'm not leaving."
Anna grabbed her mother's hand.
"This place isn't worth staying for."
Vivian pulled her hand back.

"I said I'm not leaving."
Anna bit her lip.
Why was her mother being so stubborn?
They stared at each other in silence.

Vivian sighed softly.
"You move out."
Anna shook her head.
"I can't leave you behind."

Vivian straightened her daughter's collar.
Her fingertips brushed against Anna's cheek.
"Be good."
Anna's eyes reddened.

"He will hurt you."
Vivian's gaze was firm.
"I'll come find you after I handle things here."
Anna's heart ached.

She remembered Howard Lowell's fists.
She remembered her mother's bruises.
She could never let her mother face this alone.
She held her mother's hand tightly.
###Chapter 38

Anna knew her daughter was worried about her.

She spoke softly to reassure her. "Don't worry about me, Anna. Howard doesn't dare touch me right now. He still needs you to get close to Adrian."

Vivian saw the situation clearly.

Howard was using Anna as a pawn.

A pawn to use against Adrian.

It was this very value that kept him in check.

Anna still felt uneasy.

But she reconsidered. Leaving early to prepare might be for the best.

She needed time to plan and pave the way for the future.

Vivian's stance was firm.

She would not leave the Lowell family.

Anna held her mother's hand.

"Mom, I can move out first."

"But you must promise me you'll take good care of yourself."

"Absolutely do not let yourself be mistreated."

A gentle smile touched Vivian's lips.

"Silly child, don't worry."

"We still have a good life to live together in the future."

Anna suppressed the ache in her heart.

"I'll bring you over once I have everything arranged."

Vivian gave a slight nod.

Mother and daughter sat talking on the sofa.

Anna was about to get up and go upstairs to pack.

Suddenly, there was a noise at the door.

Howard returned from outside.

His gaze swept over them, landing on Anna.

"Home so early? No work?"

He handed his coat to a servant.

He loosened his cuffs and sat on the sofa.

The cushion sank deeply under his weight.

Anna answered calmly. "I finished my work for today."

Howard let out a cold laugh.

"It seems Adrian treats you well."

"Keep it up. Secure him."

Anger welled in Anna's eyes.

Vivian discreetly pressed her hand.

Anna took a deep breath.

"I'm moving out."

Howard slammed his teacdown.

His gaze turned sinister as he stared at her.

A chill ran down Anna's spine.

Vivian gripped her daughter's hand tightly.

Her palm was slick with cold sweat.

Howard's rage erupted suddenly.

"Move out? Dream on!"

"Don't think I don't know what you're planning!"

He shot to his feet.

"Think you can fly away now that your wings are strong?"

"Planning to team up with Adrian against me?"

Anna found it absurd.

"I just want to move out."

"I have the right to choose."

Howard was completely provoked.

"In this house, what I say goes!"

"Don't you dare make decisions on your own!"

Vivian quickly stood to intervene.

"Howard, don't be angry. Let's talk this through."

Howard immediately turned his hostility toward her.

"Useless woman. You have no say here!"
###Chapter 39

Howard Lowell violently shoved Vivian Lowell onto the couch.

A savage glint flashed in his eyes.

His hand rose to strike her.

The thought of being deceived by a mere pillow for so long made his rage boil over.

How dare this useless woman who couldn't even bear a son defy him?

Anna Ross threw herself over her mother, shielding Vivian with her own body.

Her eyes were red-rimmed. Her entire frame trembled.

Howard's movement halted abruptly. He forced his hand down.

This girl was still useful. He couldn't touch her.

Anna helped her mother up, her voice shaking. "You promised you wouldn't hit her again!"

She was like a small animal baring its spikes, staring fixedly at Howard.

Howard's face was dark. He glared at Vivian. "I didn't hit her, did I?"

He brushed everything off lightly.

Tears welled in Anna's eyes. "And what about the humiliation Mom suffered?"

"Enough!" Howard snapped coldly. "Keep causing trouble and you'll regret it!"

He sat back down on the sofa and lit a cigarette.

Smoke curled through the air. Anna's stomach churned.

"I'm moving out," she said, clenching her fingers. "Whether you agree or not."

Howard stood up and crushed his cigarette underfoot.

He stepped closer, like a demon crawling out from hell.

"Getting bold?" His voice was icy.

Vivian hurriedly knelt and wrapped her arms around his leg. "Please, don't hurt Anna!"

She begged him pitifully.

Howard lifted his foot to kick her away.

Anna's throat felt blocked. It was hard to breathe.

"Mom, don't beg him!" She reached out to pull her mother up. "Let him kill me if he dares!"

Vivian pushed her hand away. "Anna, apologize now!"

Anna's hand froze mid-air.

Howard looked at her smugly, flaunting his authority.

"What does she need to apologize for?"

A detached voice came from the doorway.

Howard immediately helped Vivian up and straightened his clothes.

A smile plastered his face. "Adrian! What brings you here? Please, have a seat!"

Anna sneered inwardly. Such a bully, only tough on the weak.

Adrian Sinclair glanced at the downcast Anna. "Little cousin, you don't look well."

He stopped beside her. "I heard arguing just now?"

He lounged casually on the sofa, but his gaze remained locked on Anna.

Adrian always called her 'little cousin.' It made Anna uncomfortable.

Howard stared nervously at Anna, terrified she would tell on him.
###Chapter 40

Anna Ross lowered her head to adjust her mother's collar.

Her fingertips smoothed out the wrinkles.

She deliberately avoided that scorching gaze.

She didn't want to answer.

It was useless anyway.

He would only mock her.

He would use her embarrassment as a joke.

Adrian Sinclair leaned back on the sofa.

His long legs were crossed.

He spun a ring on his finger.

His dark eyes were unfathomable.

She remained silent.

So he waited.

Howard Lowell's eyes darted between the two.

Adrian clearly cared about Anna.

He couldn't let her leave.

His plan couldn't fail.

He forced a smile to ease the tension.

"Adrian, it's all a misunderstanding."

"We were discussing family matters. Our voices got a little loud."

"Sorry you had to see that."

He gestured for Vivian and Anna to sit down.

But his eyes held a warning.

"Is that so?"

Adrian's tone was casual.

His gaze remained fixed on Anna.

She just wanted to retreat into her shell.

To escape his scrutiny.

Howard's eyes shifted.

His earlier decision was indeed correct.

But...

"Adrian, what brings you here so late?"

Anna also looked up.

She wondered why he was visiting so late at night.

"I came to see my little cousin."

"Working with me is too exhausting."

"I came specifically to check on her."

Both Howard and Vivian were stunned.

Anna's lips twitched.

Check on her?

No one would believe that.

Adrian stared directly at her.

Seeing her color had returned.

The tightness in his chest eased slightly.

Howard put on a smiling face.

"That's very thoughtful of you, Adrian."

"Anna, aren't you going to thank him?"

He glared at Anna.

His eyes urged her on.

Anna steeled herself.

"My cousin is very concerned about me."

"Moving out was his idea too."

"It's for better work efficiency."

Adrian set down his teacup.

When had he said that?

And she called him cousin?

Howard's face turned pale.

If it was Adrian's idea...

He didn't dare oppose it.

"Adrian, is that true?"

Anna held her breath.

Praying he wouldn't expose her.

"It was my idea."

Adrian's voice was flat.

His gaze swept dangerously over her fingertips.

This woman actually dared to use him.
###Chapter 41

Howard Lowell’s eyes flickered with surprise.

It really was Adrian Sinclair who had asked her to move out.

Since it was his decision, Howard had to tread carefully.

"So it was Adrian's idea. Work must come first, of course. I wouldn't dare interfere."

He forced a smile.

"But Anna is just a young girl. I'd be terribly worried about her living alone."

He poured more tea for Adrian, playing the concerned stepfather.

Anna Ross saw right through his act.

He was pretending to respect Adrian's authority while subtly opposing her move.

What a sly fox.

Her long lashes fluttered as she looked at Adrian.

Her eyes held a silent plea.

He was her only hope now.

If he refused to help, her plan would fail.

Adrian glanced up and met her gaze.

Anna's heart clenched.

She feared he might choose this moment for revenge.

"Hmm..." He raised a brow lazily.

His slender fingers tapped the table as he feigned deep thought.

Anna bit her lower lip.

Her dark eyes filled with anxiety.

She unconsciously tightened her grip on her mother's hand.

He was doing this on purpose.

Howard frowned, growing impatient with the mind games.

He silently cursed Adrian's manipulative tactics.

"What do you think, Adrian?"

But Adrian wasn't trying to pressure Howard.

He just wanted to tease a certain someone.

Anna was trembling with nerves.

Just as she was about to break, he finally spoke.

He gave her a brief glance.

His tone was casual.

"But I asked her to move for work reasons. Work matters can't be neglected, Uncle."

Anna's tense nerves finally relaxed.

Thank goodness he didn't expose her.

She didn't know what she would have done otherwise.

Adrian shot her a meaningful look.

Howard nearly choked on his anger at Adrian's calm demeanor.

"Adrian, I understand that. But I still can't rest easy letting her live alone."

He continued, "Besides, Anna and her mother have always been inseparable."

"Wouldn't it be cruel to separate them now?"

He shot a threatening look toward Vivian Lowell on the sofa.

Anna marveled at Howard's acting skills.

He was even using the mother-daughter bond against her.

But she was determined to leave.

She wouldn't stay.

Her mother supported her move and wouldn't stop her.

Vivian timidly averted her gaze.

She looked at her daughter.

Howard's words made her doubt her decision.

After a moment of hesitation, she spoke softly.

"Anna, your father is right. We're all worried about you living alone."

"Maybe... you should just stay home?"
###Chapter 42

Anna Ross froze.

Her mother had just agreed moments ago.

Why the sudden change of heart?

She looked at her mother.

Vivian Lowell avoided her gaze.

Howard Lowell wore a victor's smile.

He cast a dismissive glance at Anna.

His eyes were filled with mockery.

It seemed to say all her efforts were in vain.

Anna's nails dug into her palms.

She bit her lip hard.

She refused to give up so easily.

Adrian Sinclair observed everything.

He noticed Vivian's fearful expression.

And Anna's stubborn defiance.

This family was clearly complicated.

He spoke suddenly.

His voice was calm yet firm.

Since it was my suggestion.

I will naturally be responsible for her safety.

Howard's face darkened.

He hadn't expected Adrian to insist.

This completely ruined his plans.

Adrian rose slowly.

He walked over to Howard.

I've recently uncovered some interesting information.

Should I report it to Grandpa?

Cold sweat broke out on Howard's back.

He forced a calm smile.

We're all family here. No need for formalities.

Anna can move out if she wants.

Adrian raised an eyebrow.

Should have agreed sooner.

Anna breathed a sigh of relief.

She looked at Adrian with gratitude.

She hadn't expected his help.

Adrian turned to her.

You move tonight.

Go pack your things now.

Anna was stunned.

This was too sudden.

She hadn't found a place yet.

Vivian quickly pulled her daughter close.

Stay a few more days.

I can't bear to see her go.

Howard pretended to object.

Let them say proper goodbyes.

Moving requires preparation too.

Adrian's gaze turned cold.

Then tomorrow.

No further delays.

He looked at Anna.

I'll pick you up tomorrow.

He turned and left.

Anna stood rooted to the spot.

Her emotions were tangled.

She could finally leave this place.

Yet unease prickled at her.

Howard stared at her retreating back.

His expression was terrifyingly grim.
###Chapter 43

Anna Ross worried he might refuse to help.

She added softly, "I'll move out once I find a place."

Adrian Sinclair's gaze swept calmly over both of them.

......

Howard Lowell smiled, trying to smooth things over.

"Anna hasn't found a place yet. It's not convenient for her to move out now."

He secretly pondered Adrian's intentions.

"I'll arrange for a place." Adrian leaned back lazily on the sofa.

The light outlined his sharp jawline.

Anna was stunned.

This was completely unexpected.

Her intention was to seize this chance to escape Howard.

Instead, she found herself in an even more dangerous situation.

"No need to trouble you. I still need to pack my things tonight." She insisted.

Staying with the Lowells was safer than going with Adrian.

Howard breathed a sigh of relief.

He needed more time to control Anna.

Adrian narrowed his eyes.

This woman used him and then turned her back immediately.

He had plenty of time to settle this score.

Anna avoided his gaze and turned to her mother.

"You can stay tonight." Adrian stood up.

He gave her a deep look.

Anna was somewhat surprised.

He didn't make things difficult for her.

"I'll take my leave now." He gave a slight nod in farewell.

Howard pretended to urge him to stay. "Be careful on the road."

Adrian curled his lips into a smile and turned to leave.

Anna's emotions were complicated.

His behavior today was completely unlike his usual self.

She thought of their conversation this morning.

She shook her head, refusing to dwell on it further.

The moment Adrian left, Howard's expression changed instantly.

A teacup slammed heavily onto the table.

"You can move out. But you know what you need to do." He said coldly.

Anna clenched her fingers.

Howard suddenly stood up and grabbed Vivian Lowell's wrist.

"If you disobey me, your mother will pay the price." He said viciously.

Anna's face turned pale.

She tried to push his hand away, but it only caused her mother more pain.

"I'll keep an eye on Adrian and report to you." She was forced to compromise.

This was exactly why she wanted to take her mother away.

If both of them left, Howard would have no way to threaten her.

It was a pity her mother refused to go.

"Now that's more like it!"
###Chapter 44

Howard Lowell sneered and shook off Vivian's hand.

Anna's heart ached.

She couldn't bear to watch her mother suffer any longer.

But her plan wasn't fully prepared yet.

Howard glared at them with disgust.

He snorted coldly.

If he didn't need Anna to monitor Adrian Sinclair, he wouldn't bother with them at all.

Then he reconsidered.

Letting her move out might actually be beneficial.

"Keep a close eye on Adrian."

"Don't forget my orders."

"You must secure him."

Anna's fingertips turned cold.

Secure Adrian?

That was utterly impossible.

He hated her to the core.

Trying to do this would only bring her humiliation.

But she knew Howard's methods too well.

If she didn't agree, she could forget about leaving.

For now, she had no choice but to comply.

"I understand."

Howard turned and left.

His footsteps faded down the stairs.

Anna let out a long sigh of relief.

Today had been full of twists and turns.

But at least she could finally move out.

"Anna."

"I won't stop you."

"Please take good care of yourself out there."

Vivian held her hand tightly.

Her eyes were full of reluctance.

"Don't worry."

"I'll come back for you once I'm settled."

Anna comforted her softly.

Though parting was painful, escape was the only way forward.

A quick break was better than prolonged suffering.

Back in her room, she immediately called Mia.

She had hung up abruptly earlier.

She worried her friend might be upset.

The call connected quickly.

"Anna?"

"Why did you hang up so suddenly?"

Anna quickly explained.

"Something came up."

"It's handled now."

"Where is the apartment you mentioned?"

"It's near Bay Area."

"When are you moving?"

"Tomorrow works!"

Anna was overjoyed.

Bay Area was very close to the company.

Mia chuckled lightly.

"Call me tomorrow."

"I'll come pick you up."

After hanging up, Anna lay on her bed.

She could finally escape this house.

She suddenly remembered something.

She picked up her phone and texted Adrian.

[Thank you for today.]

After a pause, she added.

[I need half a day off tomorrow to move.]

[I'll come straight to work after.]

She waited for a while.

There was no reply.

Perhaps he was already asleep.

Or maybe he hadn't seen it.

But she had already requested the time off.

It should be fine.

Anna held her phone.

She gradually drifted into sleep.
###Chapter 45

Morning light filtered through the gap in the curtains.

Anna Ross frowned and turned over.

She reached for her phone on the pillow.

The screen remained dark.

No new notifications.

She took a deep breath.

Pushing the covers aside, she sat up.

"I'll take it as his silent agreement," she murmured to herself.

She walked into the bathroom to wash up.

Warm water splashed against her face.

She studied her reflection in the mirror.

Her gaze gradually grew determined.

She packed all her belongings neatly into the suitcase.

As the zipper closed, Vivian Lowell entered with a bowl of porridge.

"Anna, have something to eat first," her mother said, offering the warm bowl.

Anna hesitated.

The memory of working on an empty stomach yesterday was still fresh.

She accepted the bowl and spoon.

"Thank you, Mom."

Vivian stood nearby, seeming to hold back words.

Only after her daughter finished the last spoonful did she speak softly. "Remember to eat on time at your new place."

"Don't work too hard."

"Your health comes first."

Anna checked the time.

It was much later than usual.

"Mom, I need to go now," she said, pulling up her suitcase.

"I have to get to work."

There wasn't much luggage.

A single suitcase held all her essentials.

Vivian insisted on seeing her downstairs.

Just as Anna was about to call a cab, a black Maybach slowly pulled up in front of her.

The door opened.

Adrian Sinclair stepped out.

His tailored black suit emphasized his tall, lean frame.

Anna's eyes widened in surprise.

Why was he here?

"Cousin moving?" Adrian naturally took her suitcase. "I can give you a ride."

Before she could refuse, her luggage was already in the trunk.

Anna quickly waved her hand. "No need to trouble yourself. I can take a cab."

Adrian glanced at Vivian beside them.

A slight smile touched his lips. "Moving alone isn't safe."

"Aunt must be worried too, right?"

Vivian indeed looked concerned.

"Anna, let Adrian take you," she said. "I really don't feel comfortable with you going alone."

Anna bit her lower lip.

She hesitated for a moment.

Ultimately, she didn't want to worry her mother.

"Then I'll trouble you," she said, opening the door and sliding into the passenger seat.

A hint of amusement flickered in Adrian's eyes.

He nodded to Vivian.

Then he got into the driver's seat.

"Just take me to Bay Area," Anna said stiffly, her gaze fixed out the window.

Adrian didn't respond.

He focused on holding the steering wheel.

Silence filled the car.

Only the steady hum of the engine could be heard.
###Chapter 46

Silence filled the car.

Anna Ross finally relaxed her tense nerves.

It seemed he had genuinely come to help.

"About last night, thank you."

She wasn't sure if he had seen her text, but saying it in person felt more sincere.

"Didn't you already message me last night?" Adrian Sinclair's voice was lazy.

Anna froze for a second.

So he had seen it.

He just couldn't be bothered to reply.

That was perfectly in line with his usual style.

Getting his help was already a blessing. She shouldn't expect anything more.

She pressed her lips together and said nothing more.

She was afraid one more word might start another argument.

The car came to a slow stop.

Thinking they had arrived, Anna politely thanked him and got out to get her luggage.

She stopped dead in her tracks the moment she turned around.

This was definitely not Bay Area.

A majestic villa stood before her.

She instinctively took half a step back.

What was he doing?

Adrian was suddenly standing right behind her.

His low voice brushed past her ear. "This is the place I prepared for you."
"You'll live here from now on."

His warm breath made her quickly step away.
"No, thank you." She refused outright. "I've already found a place to stay."

She turned to leave immediately.

There was no way she was moving into his territory.

Adrian's face darkened. He took a long stride and grabbed her arm.
"You used me to move out. Now you'll do as I say." His voice was laced with displeasure. "Two choices: live here, or go back."
"Your decision."

Anna pressed her lips together tightly.

If she had to choose, she would rather go back to the Lowell family.

She struggled to break free from his grip and turned away resolutely.

Adrian's expression turned completely cold.

......

"Adrian!"

A sweet female voice suddenly called out.

Anna's steps faltered.

Chloe Valentine was running happily toward Adrian.

So she lived here too.

Was he making her move here just to humiliate her?

Anna laughed coldly inside.

She really shouldn't have expected anything from him.

Adrian saw Chloe and merely offered a faint smile.

His deep gaze, however, remained fixed on Anna.

Chloe, completely oblivious to his mood, was overjoyed. "Adrian, it's been so long!"
"I've missed you so much!"

She soon looked puzzled. "What are you doing here?"

Anna frowned unconsciously.

She didn't understand why she had stopped to listen to their conversation.

She picked up her suitcase again, ready to leave.

Before Adrian could answer, Chloe's eyes landed on Anna.

She looked down her nose at this secretary Adrian always ordered around.

Seeing the suitcase, a sudden realization dawned on her.

She looked at Adrian, ecstatic. "Adrian, are you moving in here!?"
###Chapter 47

Adrian Sinclair's voice was soft, but his gaze remained fixed on Anna Ross.

"It's not for me to live here."

Chloe Valentine froze, her eyes shifting to the suitcase.

Only then did she realize it wasn't Adrian's belongings at all.

Anna felt a chill run down her spine.

Chloe scanned her from head to toe, then suddenly laughed.

"Do you know what kind of place this is?"

Anna remained silent.

Chloe's tone was leisurely, laced with mockery.

"This is the most exclusive gated community in New York."

"Only high society lives here."

"A lowly Executive Assistant like you doesn't belong here."

What infuriated her more was that Adrian had personally brought her here.

But she had to maintain her image in front of him.

Adrian frowned, his expression darkening.

"I arranged for her to stay here."

"It's close to the office. Convenient for work."

Chloe narrowed her eyes, jealousy boiling within them.

Why?

Why would he go through the trouble of arranging housing for a mere assistant?

And personally escort her?

But she didn't dare argue further.

She feared he would see her as petty.

Anna just wanted to leave as soon as possible.

"Ms. Valentine is right."

"I can't afford a place like this."

"Mr. Sinclair, I should just return to my rented apartment."

She deliberately echoed Chloe's words.

Surely he wouldn't insist now.

Chloe shot her a glance, her eyes triumphant.

Adrian turned to look at her, a cold smile curling his lips.

She had learned to use leverage against him.

Too bad it wouldn't work on him.

"You're my Executive Assistant."

"You follow my arrangements."

"There's still much for you to learn."

He slid one hand into his pocket and stepped closer.

Looming over her.

"If I say you stay, you stay."

His proximity made her breath catch.

Chloe watched them standing so close, burning with envy.

She was about to speak, but Anna beat her to it.

Anna took a step back, her tone calm.

"This is your house."

"It's not appropriate for me to live here."

"A single man and woman living alone would cause misunderstandings."

Her gaze lightly swept over Chloe.

The other woman's expression instantly changed.

Chloe cursed inwardly.

Adrian belonged to her alone.

She would never allow another woman to move in here!

She suppressed her anger and linked her arm through Adrian's.

Her voice sickly sweet.

"Adrian, she's right."

"It's bad for your reputation."

"Since she doesn't want to stay, just let her go."

She pretended to be understanding and considerate.

Every word framed as concern for him.

Anna breathed a sigh of relief.

Surely he would give up now.

Adrian's brow furrowed deeply, his gaze heavy.

He stared at Anna, his expression unreadable.

But clearly displeased.

Chloe's heart ached with bitterness, and she tightened her grip on his arm.

Her voice tinged with grievance.

"Adrian, you've been neglecting me lately."

"Do you hate me now?"

Adrian's expression stiffened.
###Chapter 48

Anna Ross's heart raced.

The chaotic scene before her was the perfect chance to escape.

She didn't believe Adrian Sinclair would abandon the beauty in his arms to chase after her.

She grabbed her suitcase and turned to run.

Adrian's eyes turned cold as he tried to pursue her.

But Chloe Valentine clung desperately to his arm.

Anna rushed out of the hotel without looking back.

She quickly hailed a taxi.

"To Bay Area, San Francisco, please!"

She finally breathed a sigh of relief as the car door closed.

She took out her phone and made a call.

"Mia, I'll be there soon."

The taxi soon arrived at the residential area.

Mia Lawrence was already waiting at the entrance.

"Anna!" She waved excitedly and ran over.

"Why did it take you so long to get here?"

Anna shook her head helplessly.

"Adrian stopped me. I almost couldn't make it."

Mia's eyes widened.

"He's causing trouble for you again?"

Anna smiled bitterly. "It's a long story."

The two carried the luggage upstairs.

The new apartment was decorated in a simple and stylish manner.

Anna fell in love with the place at first sight.

As she was unpacking, Mia moved closer.

"Anna, can you do me a favor?"

Anna nodded. "Just tell me what it is."

A sly smile appeared on Mia's face.

"My parents are forcing me to go on a blind date."

"Can you go in my place?"

Anna froze.

"Can someone else go on a blind date for you?"

Mia clasped her hands together pleadingly.

"Just this one time!"

Anna quickly shook her head.

"That's too ridiculous."

Mia hugged her arm and whined.

"Please, Anna."

"You're the only one who can help me."

Anna felt dizzy from all the shaking.

She finally sighed in resignation and gave in.

"Alright, just this once."
###Chapter 49

Mia Lawrence beamed when Anna Ross nodded in agreement.

She threw her arms around Anna in a tight embrace.

"Anna, I knew you'd do this for me!"

Anna smiled helplessly.

She had agreed to help, but what was she supposed to do now?

She had no idea where to even begin.

"Wait, let me send you the blind date location first."

Mia quickly pulled out her phone.

"I have an emergency at work. I need to go."

She grabbed her bag and rushed toward the door.

Anna opened her mouth to speak.

Mia suddenly turned and blew her a kiss.

"Love you, babe!"

The door slammed shut.

The room fell into silence.

Anna looked down at the address on her phone.

She couldn't help but laugh bitterly.

"My first blind date is for someone else."

She shook her head and began tidying the room.

Evening arrived.

Anna applied light makeup.

She chose a casual dress.

Her long hair was loosely tied up.

It revealed her slender, pale neck.

The reflection showed bright eyes and white teeth.

Her gaze carried a natural charm.

She took a deep breath.

She had already devised a strategy.

She would reject him directly upon meeting.

After all, her friend hadn't intended to actually date.

The restaurant was located on a quiet street off the main road.

Its Italian-style decor was elegant and unique.

Plane tree shadows danced gracefully outside.

Anna checked the address and pushed the door open.

Warm, soft yellow light spilled down.

Soothing music flowed through the air.

Her tense nerves gradually relaxed.

A waiter approached with a smile.

"Good evening, ma'am. Do you have a reservation?"

Anna showed her phone with the reservation details.

The waiter checked carefully and nodded.

"Please follow me."

The reserved seat was still empty.

Her blind date hadn't arrived yet.

Anna had no choice but to wait patiently.

Her drink was almost finished when a figure approached.

Anna looked up and froze.

"Lucas?"

Why was it him?

Lucas Evans's gloomy expression suddenly brightened.

He looked at Anna with surprise.

"What are you doing here?"

He hadn't expected to see her.

A smile spread in his eyes.

But confusion was more evident.

Anna pressed her lips together awkwardly.

"I'm here for my friend's blind date."

Lucas understood immediately.

He thoughtfully refilled her drink.

"It seems your friend was forced into this too."

Anna couldn't help but laugh.

"You two are in the same boat!"

They smiled at each other.

The atmosphere became light and cheerful.

Adrian Sinclair was in an extremely foul mood.

Images of Anna's defiance replayed in his mind.

His face was dark and stormy.

"Chloe, you should go back first."

His voice was cold and devoid of warmth.

"I have matters to attend to."

Chloe Valentine immediately pouted.

She hated when he made excuses to leave.

"No!"

She tugged at his sleeve, whining.

"Unless you take me to dinner."

She batted her big eyes, pretending to be pitiful.

"I'll let you go after we eat."

Adrian had no patience for this.

He was about to refuse directly.

"Chloe, we'll talk about it next time."
###Chapter 50

He moved to push her hand away.

Chloe Valentine's eyes instantly reddened.

Her voice trembled with hurt. "Grandpa specifically asked us to spend more time together yesterday."

"He wants us to build a connection."

"I don't want to disappoint him."

"If you're truly too busy, then forget it."

She lifted a hand to gently wipe the corner of her eye.

She stole a glance at his reaction.

Hearing the word "Grandpa," Adrian Sinclair's knuckles turned white.

His cold gaze swept over her red-rimmed eyes.

He finally spoke in a flat tone. "Let's go."

"I'll have dinner with you."

Chloe felt a secret thrill.

She quickly followed his steps, acting obedient.

A black Mercedes-Benz stopped in front of an upscale restaurant.

Adrian deftly unbuckled his seatbelt and got out.

Chloe hurried after him.

She naturally linked her arm with his.

A sweet smile bloomed on her face.

"Adrian, I love this restaurant."

"I've been here several times."

"I specifically wanted to bring you here today."

Adrian gave her a faint, strained smile.

He walked into the restaurant.

That smile made Chloe's heart race.

It strengthened her resolve to win this man.

The restaurant had soft lighting.

Chloe carefully selected a table.

Adrian seemed distracted.

"Let's sit by the window." She pointed to a spot with a good view.

Adrian nodded.

He followed her to the seat.

As Chloe adjusted her hair, she spotted a familiar figure.

Anna Ross was here.

She was chatting happily with a man.

A smirk touched Chloe's lips.

She stood and walked over to greet them. "Executive Assistant Ross, what a coincidence."

Anna Ross and Lucas Evans were interrupted.

They both looked surprised.

Anna responded politely. "Miss Valentine, it is a coincidence."

Chloe gave Lucas a meaningful look.

She returned to her seat, satisfied.

"Adrian, Executive Assistant Ross is here with her boyfriend."

"They seem to be having a great time."

Adrian narrowed his eyes.

His gaze turned intense as he looked in that direction.

Anna really hadn't enjoyed a meal this much in a long time.

She and Lucas talked easily.

She unconsciously drank too much of her beverage.

"I need to use the restroom." She smiled apologetically.

Lucas nodded understandingly. "Alright, I'll wait for you."

Anna checked the time.

She stood and headed for the restroom.

The restaurant was bustling with noise.

The hallway to the restroom was unusually quiet.

"Having dinner with him makes you that happy?"

A cold voice suddenly rang out.

Anna looked up sharply.

Her heart skipped a beat.

Adrian stood before her, his face dark.

Anger burned in his eyes.

He took a step forward, looming over her.

"Was your day off for moving?"

"Or for a date with a man?"
###Chapter 51

His words pierced her heart like an icicle.

Anna Ross wanted to explain.

Her wrist was suddenly seized in a tight grip.

Before she could react.

She was dragged into the men's restroom.

Her cheeks burned instantly.

She panicked, squeezing her eyes shut.

She struggled desperately against his control.

But he forcefully pushed her into a stall.

He locked the door behind them.

The click of the lock echoed sharply.

Her heart sank straight down.

The cramped space was mostly occupied by the toilet.

Only a fist's distance remained between them.

She didn't dare struggle too hard.

Afraid of alerting anyone outside.

Her face flushed crimson with tension.

She never imagined he would go this far.

Dragging her into a place like this.

Overwhelming shame washed over her.

She bit her lip hard.

He closed in on her again.

Her back pressed against the cold tiles.

Nowhere to escape.

He suddenly leaned down.

And crushed his lips against hers.

She didn't understand why he had suddenly gone mad.

She could only desperately suppress any sound.

Her hands pushed against him wildly.

But he easily restrained them.

His kiss grew more savage.

As if he wanted to completely consume her.

She was powerless to resist.

She could only let him take control.

Just as she was nearing suffocation.

He suddenly released her.

His cold gaze swept over her face.

"Do you remember what I said?"

"Stay away from other men."

She recalled his previous warning.

So that was the reason.

"I really didn't—"

She tried to explain.

But he lowered his head and bit her burning earlobe.

A shiver ran through her entire body.

Only then did she understand.

His anger wasn't because she asked for time off.

It was because she came to see Lucas Evans.

Lucas was still waiting outside.

What if he came looking for her?

Panic instantly seized her.

"Please, let me go this time."

"If anyone finds us, it's over."

"Afraid Lucas will find out, aren't you?"

A ruthless glint flashed in his eyes.

He bent down and bit her collarbone.

He only released her when he heard her gasp in pain.

Then he sealed her lips again.

Her eyes widened in terror.

She twisted her body, fighting back frantically.

But she was no match for his strength.

His body heat scorched her skin.

Her breathing grew increasingly ragged.

"This can't happen."

She turned her head away from his kiss.

"Don't forget Miss Valentine is still here."

"What would she think if she knew?"

He should care about Chloe Valentine's feelings.

"You dare threaten me?"

His movements halted abruptly.

His gloomy eyes fixed on her.

Rage seemed ready to erupt.

"You think using her name will work?"

She hurriedly covered her mouth, shaking her head.

"It's not a threat."

"It's just... someone is waiting for you."

"And I don't want Lucas to worry."
###Chapter 52

If he insisted on misunderstanding, then she would let him misunderstand completely.

As long as she could escape his control, what did these misunderstandings matter?

"Say that again?"

Adrian Sinclair looked up sharply, his brows furrowed. His deep eyes fixed on her, seemingly incredulous. Though he remained silent, Anna Ross could clearly sense the turbulence beneath his calm surface.

Seizing the moment he was distracted, Anna pushed him away forcefully and rushed out. Only after hiding in the women's restroom did her racing heart begin to settle slightly.

Her pulse still thundered.

After calming her breathing, Anna looked into the mirror to fix her appearance. Her reflection was a mess—her carefully styled updo was disheveled, her dress wrinkled and clinging, her lipstick smeared. She looked as if she had just survived a disaster.

Perhaps this was the retribution she had to endure. There was no escape.

Remembering Lucas was still waiting outside, she didn't dare delay. She quickly let down her hair, combing it with her fingers to make it look natural. After reapplying her lipstick and confirming nothing looked obviously wrong, she returned to the restaurant.

"Sorry to keep you waiting," Anna said with an apologetic smile as she sat down.

Lucas responded gently, as always. "It's fine. No need to be so polite. It's just..."

Despite Anna's efforts to act natural, he noticed subtle changes—her flushed cheeks and ears, her slightly trembling fingers.

"Anna, are you feeling unwell? Your face is so red."

Anna instinctively covered her cheeks, her heart lurching. She hadn't noticed that detail. She quickly explained, "I'm fine. It's probably just hot in here. I flush easily. Even a slight rise in temperature does this."

Hearing this, Lucas relaxed and smiled. "That's good."

Just as Anna began to relax, she caught sight of a familiar figure from the corner of her eye. She looked up. It was Adrian! Why was he here?

Lucas frowned slightly, his gaze turning wary as he looked at Adrian.

Adrian simply chuckled. "Why so tense? I just happened to see you and came over to say hello." His words were casual, but his eyes shifted to Anna, feigning surprise. "Executive Assistant Ross is here too?"

Anna gritted her teeth inwardly. This man was such an actor. After what had just happened...

But with Lucas present, she could only force a smile and nod.

The corner of Adrian's lips lifted. His gaze fell on her flushed cheek. He asked slowly, "Is the restaurant too warm? Executive Assistant Ross seems quite uncomfortable. Her face is completely red."

Lucas followed his gaze and remained silent. Adrian continued to stare at her face, watching with keen interest.

Anna's heart leaped into her throat. Under the table, her hands clenched into tight fists. If Adrian mentioned what happened now...
###Chapter 53

Lucas Evans's gaze darkened.

He stared at Adrian Sinclair, his tone cold. "The greeting is over. You can leave now."

He could never forget how Adrian had treated Anna Ross.

That memory made it impossible for him to feel any goodwill toward this man.

A shadow flickered in Adrian's eyes.

Lucas's protective stance was far too obvious.

Coupled with her words in the restroom, meant to sever their connection.

That nameless fury flared within him once more.

Anna's fingertips turned cold.

She just wanted him to leave quickly.

Was letting her go once so difficult?

Adrian acted as if he hadn't heard Lucas.

He suddenly leaned in close to Anna.

She instinctively tried to pull away.

But he seized her wrist firmly.

His warm breath brushed her ear.

His voice was a low murmur. "Don't move."

"I'm just giving work instructions."

"If you don't behave, I won't mind telling him what happened in the restroom."

He lifted his eyes to look at Lucas.

His gaze held blatant provocation.

Anna immediately froze.

She lowered her eyelids, docile as a kitten.

Adrian's lips curved into a slight smile.

His fingers gently brushed through her hair.

Lucas's face darkened.

His voice carried suppressed anger. "Is the Young Master Sinclair this intimate with every Executive Assistant?"

Anna's heart raced.

The tension between the two men was palpable.

Adrian moved even closer.

His voice was lazy. "I'm discussing confidential work with my Executive Assistant."

"Outsiders naturally cannot listen."

He deliberately emphasized the words "confidential" and "outsiders."

Seeing Lucas's expression change abruptly, he released Anna with satisfaction.

"The greeting is over."

"I won't disturb your meal."

He turned and returned to his own seat.

Anna quietly let out a sigh of relief.

Lucas watched her.

He asked softly, "Are you afraid of him?"

Anna was taken aback.

She hurriedly refused. "No."

"He's just my superior. Quite strict."

"I just get a little nervous around him."

Lucas nodded.

He recalled the previous incident.

"At the last class reunion, why did you leave so suddenly?"

"I waited for a long time, but you never came back."

He paused, his voice growing softer. "You looked very unwell that night."

"Did he give you a hard time?"

Anna's fingertips trembled.

Scenes from that night flashed before her eyes.

She and Adrian were separated by just a single wall.

While Lucas waited for her outside.

She was lost in thought for a moment.

Lucas called her. "Anna?"

She quickly shook her head. "No."

"I had an emergency that day."

"I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye."

Lucas smiled.

"It's alright."

As long as she wasn't mistreated, that was all that mattered.
###Chapter 54

They chatted for a while longer before continuing their meal.

Lucas Evans watched her, the corners of his lips lifting slightly.

He made a silent vow to himself.

This time, he would not let go again.

....

Adrian Sinclair returned to his seat, but his gaze kept drifting involuntarily toward Anna Ross.

Watching her laugh and talk with another man made his chest feel tight.

Chloe Valentine had been looking down at her phone and hadn't noticed anything unusual.

Seeing him return, she put her phone down happily.

"Adrian, you're back."

He didn't respond.

Chloe felt a twinge of doubt.

He had excused himself abruptly earlier, saying he was going to the restroom.

She had waited quietly, sensing nothing wrong.

But now she could feel his mind was clearly elsewhere.

Chloe followed his line of sight and realized he was stealing glances at Anna.

She trembled with anger.

Her once lovely face twisted with fury.

"Adrian?"

She called his name again.

He still didn't react, as if he hadn't heard her at all.

Jealousy gnawed at her heart.

She had long suspected there was something between Adrian and Anna.

Seeing his jealous expression now confirmed her suspicions.

But Adrian was hers. No one else could have him!

She stood up and served him some food, reminding him softly, "Adrian, eat up. What are you spacing out for?"

Adrian finally snapped out of it and gave a noncommittal grunt.

He picked up some food from next to his plate and ate it.

Chloe nearly stamped her foot in frustration.

He had ignored the food she served him.

Suppressing her anger, she forced a sweet smile. "How does it taste?"

Adrian didn't look up. "It's alright."

Watching Anna enjoy her meal so much made everything taste like ash to him.

He could barely swallow.

He didn't understand how she could laugh so happily.

He clenched his fist, the veins on the back of his hand standing out.

Chloe continued, "But this steak is a bit tough, not very tender."

"Besides that, I like everything else."

She waited for his response, but he only hummed in acknowledgment.

Hearing his dismissive tone, her expression froze.

Reason told her she couldn't lose her temper.

No matter how upset she was, she could only eat in silence.

After the meal, Anna checked the time.

It was very late.

She began to feel anxious.

Even though she had moved out, returning home too late always made her uneasy.

Lucas noticed her concern and said gently, "Let me drive you."

He couldn't let her go back alone so late at night.

Anna instinctively glanced toward Adrian.

She happened to meet his gaze.

Her heart tightened.

If he saw Lucas driving her home, she didn't know how he would make things difficult for her.

She politely declined. "No, thank you. I can go back by myself."
###Chapter 55

Night deepened.
The streetlights cast a dim, yellow glow.

Lucas Evans quickly caught up to Anna Ross.
His voice was laced with concern. "I really don't feel comfortable letting you go back alone this late."

He reached out to take her arm.
She gently avoided his touch.

Anna tightened her grip on her backpack strap.
She took a step back. "Really, it's no trouble. I'm fine."

Her eyes darted toward the restaurant.
Her heartbeat quickened slightly.

Lucas's expression dimmed.
"Why are we being so formal with each other?"

He stepped forward again, attempting to take her bag.

Anna turned away quickly.
"I should go. You should head back early too."

She walked briskly toward the roadside.
The night wind lifted her long hair.

Lucas stared blankly at her retreating figure.
Suddenly, he chased after her.

Inside the restaurant's glass window, Adrian Sinclair set down his napkin.
He spoke calmly to Chloe Valentine. "I need to step out to take a call."

Chloe bit her lip hard.
Her nails dug deeply into her palms.

The temperature outside was noticeably colder.
Anna couldn't help but shiver.

She was about to open her ride-hailing app.
A hand suddenly grasped her wrist.

Lucas stood before her, slightly out of breath.
"Let me drive you."

His suit jacket was damp with night dew.
His eyes, however, were unusually bright.

Anna pulled her hand free, maintaining distance.
"Really, it's not necessary."

She kept glancing toward the restaurant entrance, her expression tense.

Lucas noticed her gaze.
His tone darkened. "Are you waiting for him?"

He grabbed her wrist again, his grip tighter.

Anna tried to break free. "Lucas, don't do this."
Her voice held a plea, her eyes slightly reddening.

"Executive Assistant Ross."
A cold voice came from behind her. Anna turned sharply.

Adrian Sinclair stood under the streetlight.
His figure was tall and slender.

She慌乱ly shook off Lucas's hand.
She looked like a startled rabbit.

Lucas wanted to say more.
Anna had already quickly stepped back. "Thank you for your kindness. I can manage on my own."

She walked toward the street corner without looking back.
Her steps were hurried and unsteady.

Lucas watched her fading figure.
A dull ache spread through his chest.

Chloe Valentine stood at the restaurant entrance.
She stared fixedly at the scene.

Her newly done manicure dug deep into her flesh.
She felt no pain.

Adrian's gaze never left the figure fleeing in panic.
His eyes were deep and unreadable.
###Chapter 56

Adrian Sinclair’s gaze was icy.

Anna Ross dared to pull away from another man right in front of him.

Now she was trying to escape as if nothing had happened.

Did she think she could get away?

His warning earlier today clearly wasn’t enough.

He stepped forward.

Reached out to grab Anna.

But another hand stopped him.

Chloe Valentine’s eyes welled with tears.

Her voice trembled with hurt. "Adrian, why did you leave me alone at the restaurant?"

Adrian paused.

He turned to look at her.

Anna seized the chance to leave.

Urgency flashed in his eyes.

But he couldn’t shake Chloe off.

He forced patience into his tone. "Chloe, I have work to discuss. I’ll be right back."

Chloe’s fingers trembled slightly.

She knew it was an excuse.

But she couldn’t make a scene.

She released his arm.

Softly, she said, "Then hurry back."

Adrian nodded.

He quickly caught up to Anna.

Blocked her path.

Anna startled.

Stopped immediately.

Seeing his severe expression, she turned to go around him.

He blocked her again.

She frowned, about to speak.

Another figure suddenly appeared.

Lucas Evans stepped in front of her.

He glared coldly at Adrian. "What do you think you’re doing? Stay away from her!"

Anna’s heart raced.

She tried to intervene.

But Adrian spoke first. "Always meddling. I’m discussing work with my subordinate. This doesn’t concern you."

Adrian’s face darkened.

The two men faced off.

Tension thickened the air.

Anna stepped forward.

She met Adrian’s gaze directly. "You wanted to talk about work? Go ahead."

She surprised herself with how calm she sounded.

Adrian snorted. "A reminder to be on time tomorrow."

His eyes sharpened. "No unnecessary absences. If something like today happens again, I can’t be responsible for my actions."

He gave her a cold glance.

Turned and walked back to Chloe.

Chloe heard it was indeed about work.

She shot Anna a glare.

Her mood improved.

She linked her arm with Adrian’s and they left.

Only Lucas and Anna remained.

After a moment of silence, Lucas spoke. "It’s okay now. Let me take you home."

Anna understood.

Adrian was gone.

She didn’t need to be afraid.

But Adrian’s warning was clear.

She didn’t want to drag Lucas into this.

"No need. I’ll take a cab."

She pulled out her phone to book a ride.

Traffic was busy.

A car arrived quickly.

She said goodbye to Lucas.

Got into the car.

The car drove away.

Lucas watched her leave.

A sad expression crossed his gentle face.
###Chapter 57

Orange streetlights flickered past the car window.

Anna Ross leaned against the glass.

Light and shadow danced across her face.

Memories of reuniting with Adrian Sinclair flooded her mind.

They were a tangled mess she couldn't unravel.

Those youthful days of love were long gone.

Yet the memories felt vivid as yesterday.

"Adrian, look at that beautiful villa."

"I'll buy you a better one someday."

"Really? You promise?"

"Have I ever lied to you?"

They used to walk hand in hand at dusk.

She would chatter endlessly.

He always responded with patience.

Even the most trivial questions received serious answers.

He was cold to the entire world.

But he held her gently in his palm.

She thought it was ordinary back then.

Now everything had changed except their reunion.

She forced a faint smile.

It tasted bitter.

The car came to a stop.

Anna pushed the door open and stepped out.

The residential area was silent and empty.

Only streetlights stretched her shadow long.

Wind whispered past her ears.

Suddenly, a figure moved in the shadows.

Anna took half a step back.

Her hand slipped into her bag, gripping her phone.

Few lights were on in the residential buildings.

Who would be out at this hour?

If it was a criminal...

She didn't dare think further.

Her palm grew damp with sweat.

Her heart pounded like a drum.

"Anna?"

A familiar voice called out.

Mia Lawrence emerged from the shadows.

She looked at Anna with confusion.

Anna let out a long breath.

"What are you doing here?"

"I missed you."

Mia warmly linked arms with her.

"And I wanted to hear about your blind date."

She added with a cheerful grin.

"I'm sleeping over tonight!"

"I've waited too long for you to move out!"

Her friend's warmth seeped through her sleeve.

All her loneliness and grievances melted away.

Anna felt a surge of warmth in her heart.

She nodded gently.

They chatted and laughed their way upstairs.

The key turned in the lock.

Mia squeezed through the door first.

She pulled Anna down onto the sofa together.

"Tell me about the blind date!"

Mia's eyes sparkled with excitement.

Anna set down her bag.

Her voice trembled with emotion.

"It was such a coincidence."

"The blind date you set me up with..."

"Turns out he was my college classmate!"
###Chapter 58

"Wow, then what happened?"

Mia Lawrence's eyes sparkled as she leaned closer to Anna Ross.

Anna couldn't help but laugh.

"He's well-off, exceptionally handsome, and has a gentle personality."

"Much better than an iceberg like Adrian Sinclair."

She paused briefly.

"It's a shame you didn't go."

Anna surprised herself by comparing him to Adrian.

Perhaps it was because he kept appearing everywhere.

No matter how hard she tried to avoid him.

Mia immediately shook her head.

"I don't regret it at all."

"I don't want to get married right now."

"Especially not through a family-arranged blind date."

She pursed her lips.

"Who does that in this day and age?"

Anna chuckled softly.

She knew her best friend valued independence.

Following orders was never an option for her.

Mia suddenly turned serious.

"Anna, have you ever thought about moving to another city?"

Anna was taken aback.

"Why are you asking this suddenly?"

Mia rarely brought up such topics.

It took Anna a moment to process the question.

Mia let out a long sigh.

"I'm tired of being pressured about marriage every day."

"I really want to just leave everything behind."

Anna finally understood her intention.

She wanted to escape too.

But...

"Mia, I can't leave."

"Mom is still with the Lowells."

She lowered her gaze.

If she left alone, she didn't know what might happen to her mother.

Mia looked thoughtful.

"Didn't you want to take Aunt Vivian away before?"

"Now that you've moved out, it's the perfect opportunity."

Anna smiled bitterly.

"I don't have enough savings."

"There are too many uncertainties after leaving."

She didn't dare take the risk.

She had weighed these problems repeatedly.

What made things more complicated was Adrian.

He forced her into the Executive Assistant position.

She couldn't move freely now.

Mia said urgently, "Money can be earned slowly."

"It's better than being trapped here."

Seeing her friend suffer pained her deeply.

Anna stood up to pour water.

She handed a glass to her friend.

"Mom doesn't want to leave herself."

Even during the most desperate times.

Vivian Lowell refused to leave.

"Why?"

Mia couldn't understand.

Life was clearly so difficult.

Yet she refused liberation.

Anna sighed softly.

"She won't say."

"I suspect it's because of the debts."

"Howard Lowell helped us pay them off."

They had to repay him.

This might be her mother's unresolved issue.

Once the debts were cleared.

She could take her away.

Mia sensed her helplessness.

She reached out and hugged her.

"Things will get better."

Anna patted her back.

"Yeah."

She believed everything would improve.

Whether it was the debts or other matters.

Mia suddenly released her.

She blinked her eyes rapidly.

"You've been spending a lot of time with Adrian Sinclair lately."

"Are old feelings resurfacing?"
###Chapter 59

Mia's words made Anna freeze.

She instinctively denied it. "That's impossible."

"How is it impossible? You reunited after three years apart. That's fate." Mia rested her chin in her hands, her eyes sparkling. "If Adrian didn't always give you such a hard time, you two might actually get back together."

Anna lowered her gaze.
Fate?
This was a toxic relationship.
Adrian only had hatred in his eyes. There was no trace of their past feelings left.

She smiled bitterly. "What's over is over. There's no rekindling old flames. I was the one who broke up with him back then. He hates me too much now."

His disgusted looks and sarcastic tone always managed to hurt her.
If anyone still thought they had a chance, they must be insane.

Mia held her hand. "Anna, why did you really break up with him back then?"
She could tell Anna still had feelings for Adrian.
But Anna never spoke about it. She never offered a single explanation.

Back then, they were both busy with graduation and job hunting. They rarely talked.
Mia only remembered Anna hastily telling her they had broken up. She never said anything more.

Anna held her water glass. Her fingertips felt cold.
That year, she was the one who suggested breaking up. Adrian refused.
They had a huge fight.
His eyes were red. He gripped her wrist tightly and warned her: if she dared to break up, he would never let her go.

But...
Life never goes according to plan.
She was the one who broke his heart first. She had no right to hope for anything.

Anna forced a smile. "We just weren't right for each other. He's so outstanding. He shouldn't waste his time on someone like me."

"Nonsense!" Mia glared at her, furious. "You're beautiful and talented. You were the top student at Stanford. I always thought he wasn't good enough for you!"

Anna quickly tried to soothe her. "Okay, okay. I won't say that anymore. Don't be angry."

Mia knew these weren't her true feelings.
But if Anna didn't want to talk, no amount of questioning would help.

She ruffled Anna's hair. "Don't keep everything bottled up inside. If there's a misunderstanding, explain it. If you still love him, don't be stubborn. Follow your heart."

Anna smiled and nodded. "I know."
She leaned against Mia's shoulder. Her smile slowly faded.
A beautiful love?
She didn't deserve that anymore.

Noticing the time on her phone, Anna gasped. "It's almost eleven. I need to go wash up."
Mia hummed in response, curled up on the couch playing with her phone.

The sound of running water filled the room.
Anna closed her eyes. Her mind was filled with thoughts of Adrian.
Her reflection in the mirror looked pale.
She smiled bitterly. "Anna, wake up. There's no chance for you two. He already has a fiancée."

Ice-cold water splashed onto her face.
It was bone-chillingly cold.
Only this could keep her sober.
###Chapter 60

Anna Ross changed into her pajamas and sank lazily into the sofa.

Mia Lawrence was still washing up in the bathroom.

She suddenly thought of her mother.

She wondered if her mother had already gone to bed at this hour.

She dialed the number.

The phone was picked up after just two rings.

Vivian Lowell's gentle voice came through the receiver. "Anna, you're still up so late? How was your day?"

Anna's nose tingled with emotion.

She forced a smile. "I'm fine, Mom. How about you? Why aren't you resting yet?"

Vivian chuckled softly. "I was just about to sleep. Silly child, don't worry about me. Everything is fine at home."

Hearing her mother's normal tone, Anna felt slightly relieved.

"Then rest early, Mom. I'm going to sleep too."

As long as her mother was safe with the Lowells, she had no other wishes.

She hung up just as Mia walked out, drying her hair.

"Anna, who were you talking to just now?"

"My mom. I suddenly missed her a little."

Anna gripped her phone and pulled Mia into the bedroom.

Mia threw herself onto the soft bedding. "Aren't you a little old to be clinging to your mom? I wish my mother would nag me less."

Anna got into bed from the other side and shot her a look. "Having a mother who nags you is a blessing. I think it's wonderful."

Mia was about to say something else when a phone ring cut through the air.

The caller ID showed Adrian Sinclair.

Anna's smile vanished instantly.

Mia leaned closer. "Who is it?"

"Adrian Sinclair."

"Answer it! See what he wants."

Anna didn't want to answer.

But he was still her boss.

She swiped to answer, her tone cold. "What is it?"

Mia curiously moved closer to the receiver.

A deep voice came from the other end. "Reminding you to be on time for work tomorrow. If you're still out playing, you'd better go back and sleep now. Don't be late again."

......

Anna responded flatly. "If it weren't for someone's disturbance, I would have been asleep long ago."

There was a brief silence on the other end.

Then came a soft hum from Adrian before the call abruptly ended.

Anna stared at her phone screen, her brow furrowed.

"Absolutely ridiculous. What a wicked capitalist!"

She knew better than to expect any kindness from him.

He only knew how to exploit her in different ways.
###Chapter 61

Mia Lawrence’s eyes sparkled with mischief.

She leaned closer to Anna Ross, lowering her voice to a whisper.

“Something’s off here. The vibe between you two isn’t normal.”

She winked playfully.

“He’s supposedly your boss, but I bet he’s actually your boyfriend.”

Her finger gently poked Anna’s flushed cheek.

Anna turned away, her ears burning.

“Stop making things up. He’s just upset I took a day off today.”

She looked down, nervously smoothing her clothes.

“He just wants me at work on time tomorrow.”

Mia burst out laughing.

She threw an arm around Anna’s shoulders.

“Work? I heard him specifically ask if you were still out!”

She squeezed her friend gently.

“That’s concern, Anna! You can’t fool me.”

Anna sighed, rubbing her forehead.

“You should see him when he’s angry.”

A cold shiver ran down her spine at the memory of Adrian Sinclair’s icy glare.

“That’s because you haven’t seen his gentle side!”

Mia hugged a plush toy from the couch.

She tilted her head, studying Anna intently.

“You’re just too oblivious.”

Anna squirmed under her gaze.

She pushed Mia toward the bedroom.

“Go to sleep. We have to get up early tomorrow.”

Mia giggled, sliding under the covers.

“I knew it! Your face is completely red!”

“I’ll really get mad if you keep this up!” Anna turned away to switch off the light.

Darkness finally silenced Mia.

Only her steady breathing remained.

But Anna lay awake, eyes open.

The thought of seeing Adrian tomorrow tangled her thoughts into a messy knot.

She pulled a pillow over her head.

Eventually, she fell into a fitful sleep.

The next morning, Anna woke before dawn.

She rubbed her eyes with a bitter smile.

Even her subconscious feared being late and facing his wrath.

She hurried through her morning routine.

A dry piece of bread served as breakfast.

Her new apartment didn’t even have jam yet.

As she packed her bag, Mia still slept soundly.

Anna closed the door softly behind her.

She sighed at the gray, overcast sky.

The miserable daily grind of a worker began before sunrise.

Standing on the quiet, cold street, she froze.

She realized he never told her where to meet him yesterday.

After a moment’s hesitation, she finally dialed the number memorized by heart.
###Chapter 62

The phone rang for a long time before it was answered.

Anna could almost picture his sleepy face.

She took a deep breath.

She tried to suppress the resentment surging inside her.

She never dared to act recklessly in front of Adrian.

She softened her voice and asked, "Where should I go to meet you now?"

A hurried response came from the other end. "The Marriott Hotel."

His voice carried a clear tone of busyness.

Before Anna could say another word, the call ended.

Listening to the dial tone, Anna's heart tightened involuntarily.

A hint of confusion also rose within her.

He owned such a luxurious villa.

Why would he choose to stay in a hotel?

But these were not matters she should question.

Shaking off the distracting thoughts, she entered the destination into the ride-hailing app.

Standing at the hotel entrance, Anna unconsciously clenched the hem of her clothes.

No matter how much she prepared herself mentally, she still felt nervous when facing him.

Entering the hotel lobby, the spacious and bright environment was eye-catching.

The light gray marble floor gleamed under the lights.

Expensive art pieces hung on the walls.

Everywhere exuded luxury.

People came and went in a continuous stream.

There were couples embracing sweetly.

There were also hurried travelers.

Anna chose to wait in the lounge area.

She specifically picked a seat with a clear view of the exit.

Not long after, a familiar figure came into view.

She was about to stand up when she noticed a girl following closely behind Adrian.

The girl held his arm intimately.

Their laughing and chatting appearance was particularly striking.

At first, she thought it was Chloe.

But as they came closer, she realized it was a completely unfamiliar face.

The girl was as delicate as a porcelain doll.

She was a type Anna had never seen before.

She instinctively hid behind a nearby potted plant.

Afraid of being discovered.

The two stopped in the center of the lobby.

They seemed to be discussing something.

The girl smiled radiantly.

Adrian also showed a rare gentle expression.

He gallantly brushed away a stray strand of hair from her face.

His gaze was soft and unfamiliar.

The girl shyly tapped his shoulder.

Their intimate interaction resembled that of a couple deeply in love.

Watching this scene, Anna felt an inexplicable pain in her chest.

But she quickly suppressed the strange emotion.

After all, they were no longer together.

Who he was with had nothing to do with her.

Just then, Adrian leaned close to the girl's ear and whispered something.

The girl giggled and planted a kiss on his cheek.

Anna hurriedly averted her gaze.

She pressed her palm against her rapidly beating heart.

She didn't understand why she felt so sad.

Anna Ross, what exactly are you hoping for?

She looked up with a bitter smile.

Only to find that the girl had disappeared at some point.
###Chapter 63

Anna Ross was lost in thought.

Her phone rang abruptly.

The sound echoed sharply through the empty hall.

She frantically sat down and reached for her phone.

The more she rushed, the more flustered she became.

Her phone was stubbornly stuck inside her bag.

Adrian Sinclair listened to the incessant ringing.

He noticed a figure moving in the distance.

He walked over.

"What are you doing here?"

Anna had just managed to grab her phone.

Adrian was already standing before her.

His gaze was scrutinizing.

He put his own phone away.

He studied her leisurely.

Anna clutched her phone tightly.

Her fingertips turned pale.

If he discovered she had been spying, she didn't know how he would mock her.

She stammered, unable to form words.

Adrian raised an eyebrow.

"I asked you to come to work."

"Are you hiding here to slack off?"

"Is this your work ethic?"

Anna quickly looked up.

"That's not it."

"I was afraid of disturbing you."

Adrian narrowed his eyes.

He slipped his phone back into his pocket.

He stared down at her, as if trying to see through something.

Anna nervously avoided his gaze.

"It's still early."

"I thought you were still asleep."

"So I waited here."

She didn't even believe her own words.

But she absolutely couldn't let him know she had just witnessed his intimacy with someone else.

Adrian scoffed lightly.

"You think everyone is like you?"

"Sleeping until noon?"

"Follow me."

He turned and walked away quickly.

Anna hurried after him.

Inside the car.

Adrian handed her a file.

"The client we're meeting today."

Anna took the documents.

What project required his personal attention?

She then remembered she was just an Executive Assistant.

Her job was to focus on her own tasks.

By the time she finished reviewing the materials, the car had stopped.

They were in front of an upscale restaurant.

It was so luxurious it felt intimidating.

A single meal here could cost half a year of her salary.

Anna's eyes dimmed.

The private room door was pushed open.

Adrian walked straight in.

Mr. Klein immediately stood up and extended his hand.

"Mr. Sinclair, I've heard so much about you."

The others rose to their feet as well.

Adrian wore a rare smile.

Though it didn't reach his eyes.

He still shook hands politely.

Their fingers barely touched before pulling away.

Mr. Klein awkwardly retracted his hand.

"Mr. Sinclair, please have a seat."
###Chapter 64

Adrian Sinclair gave a slight nod.

He took his seat with effortless composure.

Anna Ross immediately moved to stand at his side.

William Klein finally noticed the stunning beauty accompanying Adrian.

His gaze swept over Anna with greedy appraisal.

She felt a wave of discomfort.

She subtly shifted half a step behind Adrian.

After a brief exchange of pleasantries.

Adrian cut straight to the point.

"Mr. Klein, we've already discussed the project details over the phone."

"You insisted on a face-to-face meeting."

"Is there something about the proposal you're unsatisfied with?"

William paused while pouring wine.

He laughed evasively.

"Don't be so impatient, Mr. Sinclair."

"Let's discuss this over our meal."

He pushed a glass of wine toward Adrian.

Then downed his own drink first.

Adrian watched the glass with cold indifference.

He showed no intention of touching it.

"I simply want to know."

"What is your actual stance on this collaboration?"

William's attention drifted back to Anna.

He stroked his chin.

His smile was oily.

"Mr. Sinclair, I said we should take this slow."

"You've only recently taken over the company."

"There's still much for you to learn."

Anna recognized the deliberate condescension.

This man was clearly trying to undermine Adrian.

Adrian let out a cold laugh.

His eyes turned icy.

He toyed idly with his platinum signet ring.

After a long moment, he finally spoke.

"Mr. Klein, you should think before you speak."

Faced with this direct threat, William snorted dismissively at his assistant.

His expression was full of contempt.

As if mocking Adrian for overestimating himself.

He downed another glass of wine.

Then leered openly at Anna.

"If you're willing to let me have this beauty, Mr. Sinclair."

"We can sign the contract right now."

Anna's heart clenched.

Her knuckles turned white where she gripped the files.

She looked at Adrian.

Terrified he might actually offer her up.

She would rather die than go with this disgusting old man.

Seeing no reaction from Adrian, William stood and moved toward Anna.

He wore a nauseating smile.

"Even more beautiful up close."

"What's your name, sweetheart?"

He reached out to touch Anna's face.

She recoiled in disgust.

But backed into a wall with nowhere to retreat.

Just as William was about to lunge forward.

A powerful hand clamped around his wrist.

Looking up, Anna saw Adrian glaring darkly at William.

Before William could react.

A heavy fist connected with his face.

Several more blows followed in quick succession.

William cried out and collapsed to the floor.

The others gasped and crowded around.

Anna stood frozen in shock.

She never expected Adrian to intervene for her.

William tried to speak.

But Adrian kicked him hard in the chest.

Adrian's voice was frigid.

"Who do you think you are?"

"Overestimating your own importance?"

The others exchanged uneasy glances.

No one dared to make a sound.

Adrian straightened his collar.

Then took Anna's hand and walked out without looking back.

The deal had fallen through.

Anna felt a pang of guilt.

She apologized softly.

"I'm sorry. This is all because of me..."

Adrian suddenly stopped walking.

His cold eyes swept over her.

"Don't flatter yourself."

"If you weren't my Executive Assistant right now."

"I wouldn't have bothered."

Anna's face paled.

She bit her lip hard.

She shouldn't have expected anything from him.

Adrian's anger still radiated from him.

She didn't dare speak again.

She followed him silently back to the hotel.
###Chapter 65

Anna Ross stepped into the hotel lobby.

A figure in pale yellow bounded toward her.

She recognized the girl from this morning.

The girl affectionately looped her arm through Adrian Sinclair's.

Her smile was as bright as the morning sun.

Anna's fingers tightened slightly.

She felt like an awkward outsider.

Adrian noticed her distraction instantly.

He withdrew his arm, his expression cool.

"Mind your surroundings."

His voice gave nothing away.

The girl finally looked at Anna.

A flicker of admiration passed through her eyes.

She studied Anna with curiosity.

"What's your relationship?"

Adrian's gaze swept over them.

"Executive Assistant."

He answered with detached ease.

The girl raised a brow, clearly skeptical.

She had seen him stealing glances at Anna.

She stepped forward and extended her hand.

"I'm Sophia Roscente."

Anna was slightly surprised.

She shook hands politely.

"Anna Ross."

A faint curve touched her lips.

Sophia nodded, satisfied.

She returned to Adrian's side and took his arm.

Rising on her toes, she whispered near his ear.

"Cousin, do you like this pretty lady?"

Adrian's brow twitched almost imperceptibly.

His peripheral glance brushed Anna's profile.

"Don't cause trouble."

His voice dropped low.

"Or I'll send you home."

Sophia pouted in displeasure.

But her eyes soon sparkled as she tugged his sleeve.

"I'm hungry."

"Take me to eat, please?"

Adrian gave a faint hum of agreement.

Sophia immediately beamed with joy.

Anna watched their intimate posture.

A subtle ache bloomed in her chest.

She quickly suppressed the emotion.

At least she could leave work early.

She thought of Chloe Valentine.

The official fiancée was probably still kept in the dark.

She shook her head lightly, dismissing the thought.

"May I clock out now?"

Sophia observed their interaction.

A knowing smile played on her lips.

She was certain her cousin treated his assistant specially.

Adrian's cold gaze shifted to Anna.

"Join us for dinner."

His tone brooked no argument.

Anna instinctively stepped back.

"I don't want to be a third wheel."

She refused directly.

Adrian's expression darkened instantly.

He closed the distance between them.

"It's still work hours."

"Are you attempting to leave your post, Miss Ross?"

Anna's heart fluttered nervously.

He clearly had a companion already.

Why was he singling her out?

She lowered her eyes without responding.

Adrian's voice grew deeper.

"Did you not hear me?"

Every word carried undeniable pressure.

Sophia watched with keen interest.

Her cousin was clearly being contradictory.

His insistence on keeping Anna there was downright domineering.
###Chapter 66

Sophia Roscente stepped forward.

She spoke softly. "You should come with us. I don't mind."

Her words pierced Anna Ross's heart like needles.

A sharp pain shot through her.

She wanted to flee this place immediately.

But Adrian Sinclair gave her no chance to escape.

She could only agree in a low voice. "Alright."

Adrian remained silent.

Sophia affectionately linked arms with him, walking ahead.

Anna followed quietly behind them.

A long distance stretched between the three of them.

Halfway there.

Sophia leaned close to Adrian's ear.

She said mysteriously, "Cousin, just admit you like her already."

Adrian's gaze shifted away.

He did not respond.

Sophia glanced back at Anna.

She lowered her voice. "It's perfect she's joining us for dinner."

"I saw her expression just now. She was definitely jealous."

"Let me test her feelings for you. What do you think?"

She was confident in understanding a woman's heart.

When she said she didn't mind.

She clearly saw the subtle change on Anna's face.

"No need."

Adrian refused in a deep voice.

He pulled open the car door.

His eyes swept over Anna.

Then he got into the car.

Hearing about testing Anna's feelings.

A faint thread of anticipation stirred within him.

But fear accompanied it.

He rubbed his temples.

Coldly instructing the driver to start the car.

Sophia saw his complex expression.

She already had a plan in mind.

At the restaurant.

Adrian chose a seat and sat down.

Sophia immediately sat close beside him.

She looked at Anna and said generously, "Don't stand on ceremony. Make yourself comfortable."

Anna felt like an extra person.

She forced herself to sit opposite them.

Watching her calm face.

Adrian felt inexplicably irritated.

He looked away.

The waiter quickly served all the dishes.

"Please enjoy your meal."

Sophia placed food in Adrian's bowl.

She said thoughtfully, "Eat more. You've gotten so thin from being too busy with work."

Adrian glanced at Anna.

He lowered his head and began to eat.

Sophia looked at Anna again.

She said with a clever smile, "Sorry, I just feel bad for him."

"Even when he's on a date with me, he's always busy with work."

"It's rare to have a meal out, so I couldn't help myself. Please forgive me."

She picked up a napkin and wiped the corner of his mouth.

The gesture was very intimate.

Anna's eating movements halted.

On a date with her?

She looked up at Adrian.

A sense of loss washed over her.

Had he become like this now?

Able to casually have multiple women.

Having any type of woman he wanted.

She laughed coldly inside.

Men really do change when they get money.

He was no longer the Adrian Sinclair from before.

Adrian pretended to glance up casually.

Looking at her across the table.

Then he lowered his head and continued eating.

A long time passed without any reaction from her.

He actually felt somewhat sad inside...
###Chapter 67

Anna Ross offered a faint smile.

"It's fine."

Her voice was soft.

Sophia Roscente didn't need to worry about her.

She was just the Executive Assistant Adrian Sinclair had forced to come along.

What opinion could she possibly have?

Yet her heart felt heavy, like a stone was lodged inside.

A dense, uncomfortable weight.

All she wanted now was to leave.

Surprise flickered in Sophia's eyes.

She glanced furtively at Adrian Sinclair.

He appeared even calmer than Anna.

Sophia decided to turn up the heat.

She gave a playful, charming laugh.

"That's good then."

She suddenly turned her head.

She planted a kiss on Adrian's cheek.

She smiled like a cat that got the cream.

Anna's expression froze.

She hadn't expected Sophia to be so direct.

Adrian's face darkened instantly.

He shot a look at Sophia.

His eyes held a clear warning.

Sophia stuck out her tongue.

She lowered her head to eat.

But her peripheral vision remained fixed on Anna.

Adrian also looked at Anna.

Her face was completely unreadable.

A sharp pang pierced his chest.

Did she really not care at all?

Another woman had just kissed him.

And it meant nothing to her?

Rage surged within him.

His fingers clenched tightly around his fork and knife.

His knuckles turned white.

Sophia served him some food.

She leaned in and whispered close to his ear.

She covered her mouth with a light, tinkling laugh.

Adrian glanced at Anna.

She seemed visibly uncomfortable.

A smirk suddenly tugged at his lips.

He also leaned close to Sophia's ear to speak.

Sophia giggled playfully and hit his shoulder.

"You're awful!"

"There are other people here!"

They both looked at Anna simultaneously.

Their gazes seemed to say she was the third wheel.

Anna felt like she was sitting on pins and needles.

She put down her fork and knife.

"Excuse me."

"I got some grease on my clothes."

"I need to go clean it."

She stood up and left the table.

Her retreating figure was hurried.

Sophia immediately looked at Adrian.

"Cousin, just give it up."

"She doesn't like you."

Adrian's face grew even colder.

He put down his fork and knife with a heavy thud.

"I told you not to cause trouble."

Sophia was indignant.

"What does that have to do with me?"

"You like her."

"But she feels nothing for you."

"You're just embarrassed your pride got hurt."

The air suddenly went quiet.

Only the sound of footsteps from the surrounding area remained.

Adrian stood up.

"I'm going to the restroom."

He left with a cold expression.

Sophia watched his retreating back.

She muttered under her breath.

"Got his ego bruised and now he's sulking."

"It's rare for a woman to reject him."

"This should be interesting to watch."

Anna was lost in thought in the restroom.

She didn't want to go back and watch their intimate display.

Her brow was furrowed tightly.

She finally let out a sigh.

Hiding away forever wasn't a solution.

She turned and walked out of the restroom.

Only to run straight into Adrian Sinclair.

He was walking toward her, his face completely blank.

Anna's heart leaped into her throat.

She met his gaze for a few seconds.

Then she hurriedly looked down.
###Chapter 68

Anna Ross intended to walk past as if she hadn't seen him.

The moment they brushed shoulders, Adrian Sinclair suddenly reached out and grabbed her.

Anna forcefully shook off his hand.

She looked up, meeting his gaze directly. "Will you let me leave work now?"

She had already witnessed the entire spectacle.

He shouldn't have any reason to keep her any longer.

Adrian stared at her with a dark, gloomy eyes.

The fire inside him hadn't subsided.

She dared to make demands?

"I said no," he stated, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Anna couldn't help but let out a cold laugh. "You specifically called me here to watch you and your new flame be affectionate. Is that kind of show entertaining? Or is this just your true nature? I truly feel sorry for Miss Valentine!"

Whether it was anger or impulse, she shouted everything that had been bottled up inside.

Adrian, however, seemed to hear something pleasing.

He took a step forward, a hint of a smile actually appearing in the depths of his eyes. "What's this? Are you jealous, seeing me with someone else?"

Anna's face instantly turned pale.

His expression now frightened her.

She was afraid he would treat her the way he had before.

She hastily took a step back, explaining in a low voice, "You've misunderstood. I just think it's unfair to Miss Valentine. I'm leaving."

With that, she turned and ran, leaving only a panicked shadow behind her.

Adrian stood in place, watching her leave.

Something in his cold, deep eyes seemed to melt.

He walked into the restroom and looked at his reflection in the mirror.

Only then did he realize he was actually smiling.

He immediately restrained the smile.

When he looked up again, his usual coldness had returned.

Anna ran all the way, glancing back over her shoulder frequently.

Only when she confirmed he wasn't following did she finally relax.

She secretly regretted her earlier outburst.

In her eyes, Adrian was like a dangerous wolf.

Ready to pounce and tear her apart at any moment.

She had to maintain her distance at all times.

Returning to her seat, Sophia Roscente looked up and smiled at her. "Is your outfit okay now, Miss Ross?"

Anna was momentarily stunned before she remembered.

She hadn't actually gotten anything on her clothes.

She had just made an excuse to leave, not wanting to watch their public display of affection.

She returned the smile. "It's fine, thank you."

The two sat in silence for a moment.

Anna secretly observed Sophia.

She was the cute type, her style and momentum radiating liveliness.

But she looked very young.

Anna felt a wave of confusion.

Did Adrian prefer dating younger women now?

Hesitating for a moment, she couldn't help but ask, "Miss Roscente, may I ask how old you are?"

"I just turned twenty. Why?" Sophia's frank reply surprised her.

"Nothing, I just think you're very cute," Anna said.

The other girl chuckled. "Can't help it. I have a baby face. People often mistake me for a middle schooler!"

Anna, however, couldn't bring herself to laugh.

She took a sip of water and said softly, "Do you really think Adrian is suitable? He seems to have a fiancée."
###Chapter 69

"It's alright, I don't mind."

Sophia Roscente blinked her round eyes, her smile sweet.

"Having him by my side now is enough."

Anna Ross sighed quietly.

Such a bright girl, yet she had to meet Adrian Sinclair.

She said no more, lowering her head to take a sip of water.

Sophia suddenly leaned in, asking playfully.

"What about you?"

"You and Adrian... it doesn't seem like a normal boss-employee relationship."

"Do you like him?"

Anna choked violently, coughing uncontrollably.

Sophia quickly patted her back.

It took a moment for Anna to recover, murmuring her thanks.

She set down her glass, her tone light.

"I'm just his Executive Assistant."

"Beyond that, there's nothing between us."

"Please don't joke about such things, Miss Roscente."

A bitter feeling stirred in her heart.

Why did it still affect her when it was already over?

Sophia tilted her head, her eyes sly.

She didn't believe these two had no connection.

"But the way he looks at you is clearly different—"

"Sophia Roscente!"

A cold male voice cut her off abruptly.

Adrian Sinclair stood by the table, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Sophia immediately looked down, pretending to focus on her meal.

Adrian's eyes fell on Anna.

"You can clock out now."

His voice was icy. "Stop being an eyesore here."

He sat down directly, the atmosphere instantly tense.

Anna gripped her bag strap tightly, standing up to leave.

Her departure was swift, without a hint of reluctance.

Sophia watched her go, sighing inwardly.

What on earth did her cousin do...

To make that girl avoid him so quickly?

She picked up a piece of meat, trying to lighten the mood.

Adrian shot her a cold look. "She's gone. No need to act."

Sophia huffily put the meat back, muttering.

"So ungrateful!"
###Chapter 70

Adrian Sinclair glanced at her briefly without a word.

His gaze swept over the spot where Anna Ross had been sitting moments before, pensive.

Sophia Roscente took a few bites before another thought struck her.

She leaned in with a gossipy grin, curiosity sparkling in her eyes. "Cousin, I remember you were a complete wreck after that breakup. Moping around, drowning yourself in alcohol for ages."

She recalled clearly how he'd lock himself away, refusing to see anyone, or stumble home drunk late at night, muttering 'why' over and over. The whole family was worried sick, but nothing they did helped.

Adrian's expression darkened instantly.

Sophia felt the air around them freeze, a chill running down her spine.

"Stay out of it if you want to stay here," he warned coldly. "Or I'll call your mother right now and have a nice long chat about you."

Sophia panicked immediately.

She whined about him always resorting to threats while begging, "I'm sorry, cousin! I promise I'll keep my mouth shut! Please don't tell Mom! I snuck out—if she finds out, I'm dead! You wouldn't let your adorable cousin suffer, would you?"

"You think I didn't know you sneaked back?"

Adrian shot her a look, taking a slow sip of water.

The noise was giving him a headache. He just wanted to send her away as soon as possible.

Sophia pouted, feeling wronged.

She glared at her aloof cousin and muttered under her breath, "Life abroad is so boring. It's much better here. Everything's more fun." She quickly added some flattery, "And most importantly, I get to see my handsome cousin!"

Adrian looked disgusted and told her to shut up.

"So what's your plan now? You know what will happen if your mother finds out you sneaked back, right?"

Sophia deflated instantly.

She sighed deeply. With her mother's fiery temper, she'd probably break her legs just for this!

The thought made even the delicious food in front of her lose its appeal.

She shook her head. "I'll just take it one step at a time. Keep it hidden for now!"

Adrian glanced at her but didn't comment.

Sophia, however, saw an opportunity.

She immediately put on a pitiful face and pleaded, "Cousin, please take your poor little cousin in! Otherwise, I won't even have a place to stay in San Francisco!"

Seeing her act cute gave Adrian goosebumps.

He held up a hand to keep her at a distance. "Stop. I don't need extra baggage."

With that, he stood up and headed toward the hotel.

Sophia stomped her foot in frustration.

Afraid he would really abandon her, she hurried after him, shouting, "Cousin! Wait for me!"
###Chapter 71

The car came to a stop.

Anna Ross pushed the door open and got out.

She walked quickly into her apartment.

She locked the door behind her.

Only then did she allow herself to relax.

She lay down on the bed.

She stared blankly at the ceiling.

The image of Adrian Sinclair confronting the client surfaced.

He had shielded her.

It was exactly like before.

Back then, he always protected her.

He never let her get hurt.

But.

Everything had changed.

He had said he hated her.

If not for her position as his Executive Assistant.

He probably would have just watched coldly.

She reminded herself not to overthink it.

But seeing him interact so closely with Sophia Roscente.

Her heart still felt heavy and uncomfortable.

A wave of bitterness washed over her.

She despised this part of herself.

She was like a ridiculous fool.

He clearly didn't care.

Yet here she was, lost in her own delusions.

She shook her head and sat up.

She walked to the dressing table mirror.

She stared at her reflection.

Anna Ross, stop these foolish thoughts.

It was doomed from the day you broke up.

Now he is him, and you are you.

There is nothing between you except work.

After this self-affirmation.

She felt a little lighter.

Her phone suddenly rang.

She picked it up.

Seeing it was her mother calling.

She answered immediately.

Her voice filled with joy.

Mom!

There was a moment of silence on the other end.

Then Howard Lowell's rough voice came through.
Are you off work?
Come back. Now.

Hearing his voice.
Anna's face instantly turned cold.
She didn't speak.

Howard's voice was icy.
What, not willing?

Anna suddenly realized something.
Her face paled.
Where's Mom?
Why do you have her phone?
She gripped the phone tightly.
Her voice trembled.
Where is my mother!?

Howard snorted coldly.
If you want to see her, get back here.

The call ended.
Anna stared at the black screen of her phone.
She didn't dare delay.
She grabbed her bag and rushed out.

Ever since she witnessed her mother being beaten last time.
She knew her mother was in constant danger.
If he dared to abuse her mother again.
She would not stand by and do nothing.

Sir, please drive faster!

Time passed.
Anna was frantic with worry.
She kept looking ahead.

The driver sighed.
Miss, this is as fast as I can go.
Any faster and we'll have an accident.

He glanced at her in the rearview mirror.
He shook his head helplessly.
He understood her urgency.
But safety was most important.

Anna checked her phone again.
She desperately wished for news that her mother was safe.
But there was nothing.

The car finally stopped.
Anna jumped out quickly.
She ran toward her house.
###Chapter 72

The wind howled in her ears.

Yet Anna Ross's heart beat even faster.

Stepping into the house.

Her tension finally eased slightly.

Vivian Lowell rose immediately at the sound.

She hurried forward and took her daughter's hand.

Joy radiated from her face.
"Anna, you're back."

She quickly noticed something was off about Anna.

Her body temperature was high, her breathing rapid.

Vivian couldn't help but scold.
"How did you get so exhausted?
Have some water first to calm down."

Anna was surprised to see her mother.

She didn't take the water glass.

Instead, she urgently pulled her mother aside for a careful check.
"Mom, are you okay?"

Vivian smiled gently.

She pressed Anna down onto the sofa.
"I'm fine, don't worry.
He didn't do anything to me."

Anna checked repeatedly.

Seeing her mother truly wasn't hurt.

She finally let out a long sigh of relief.

She took the water glass and drank deeply.

Vivian looked at her lovingly.
"Drink slowly, don't choke."

Anna didn't have time to respond.

She finished the entire glass quickly.

Just as she wiped her mouth to speak.

Howard Lowell approached the sofa.

He couldn't be bothered to look at Vivian.

He spoke coldly directly to Anna.
"I have something to discuss with you alone.
Come with me."

He turned and walked toward the study.

Anna bit her lip.

No matter how unwilling, she could only comply.

Vivian sensed her mood.

She patted her hand worriedly.
"Anna, I know you're resentful.
But right now, you must humor him."

Anna nodded obediently.
"I know, Mom, don't worry.
I understand priorities."

She rose and followed him into the study.

Before she could even stand still, a command came.
"Close the door."

Howard's icy voice reached her.

Anna obediently closed the door.

Howard leisurely sat in his office chair.
"What has Adrian Sinclair been up to lately?"

Hearing this question.

Anna's heart tightened.

Should she really tell him everything?

Seeing her strange expression and silence.

Howard's face instantly darkened.
"What? Don't care about your mother anymore?"

Anna glared at him hatefully.

But it only earned a scornful laugh.

She was too weak to protect her mother.

She closed her eyes and spoke coldly.
"He's been with another girl recently.
No need to worry about the engagement with the Valentine family."

"Another girl?"
Howard crossed his arms, scrutinizing her.

Seeing she didn't seem to be lying, he pressed further.
"Which family's daughter is she?"

He suspected Adrian had connected with another powerful family.

His look toward Anna grew even more disdainful.
"All this time, and you still haven't secured him."

Anna frowned.

She truly didn't know the identity.
She could only shake her head and say flatly.
"I don't know her background.
I only know her name is Sophia Roscente."
###Chapter 73

Howard Lowell’s face darkened instantly at the mention of Sophia Roscente’s name.

He shot to his feet, jabbing a finger toward Anna Ross.

“You’re utterly hopeless!”

His chest heaved with ragged breaths.

Anna was baffled by his outburst.

She couldn’t understand what she had done wrong.

“I followed your instructions to monitor Adrian Sinclair. I reported everything exactly as it happened.”

Howard let out a cold, angry laugh.

“Sophia Roscente isn’t Adrian’s girlfriend. She’s his cousin!”

Anna froze.

She suddenly remembered the Lowell family had two daughters.

Adrian’s mother was the eldest, and Sophia’s mother was the younger one.

No wonder Adrian never resisted Sophia’s affectionate gestures.

They were family all along.

She had misunderstood him…

The realization brought an unexpected sense of relief.

But she quickly shook her head.

She was just happy for Chloe Valentine.

Adrian hadn’t betrayed her feelings.

“I’ll let it slide this time. You’re not familiar with their family.”

Howard massaged his temples, his expression softening slightly.

“But the mission continues. You must keep a close watch on Adrian. No more mistakes.”

His voice turned icy.

“Otherwise, I can’t guarantee your mother’s safety.”

Anna’s fingers clenched tightly.

She suppressed the urge to flee with her mother.

“I understand.”

Howard nodded in satisfaction.

He propped his feet on the desk, his face grim.

“There’s some trouble at the branch office. I need to handle it.”

“Your task is to bring Adrian back to New York. By any means necessary.”

Anna looked up in shock.

“How is that possible?”

She couldn’t possibly influence Adrian’s decisions.

Howard overestimated her.

More importantly, her mother was still in San Francisco.

She couldn’t leave her side.

Howard’s eyes turned cold.

“You refuse?”

Anna forced herself to stay calm.

“It’s not that I refuse. It’s impossible. Adrian won’t listen to me.”

Howard sneered.

He turned and pulled a file from the bookshelf.

He slammed it heavily onto the desk.

Anna’s heart jumped at the sound.

“Take a good look at these documents.”

He settled back into his chair, watching her with a cold gaze.

“Then tell me your decision.”
###Chapter 74

Anna Ross walked to the desk.

She picked up the documents.

The papers trembled slightly between her fingers.

When she saw the contents.

Her vision went dark.

The black and white records were crystal clear.

Each entry was a transfer from Howard Lowell to her mother.

The smallest amount was three million.

The largest even exceeded ten million.

Anna gripped the edge of the desk.

Her fingertips turned white from the pressure.

She desperately flipped through each page.

The numbers were staggering.

So this was the "unavoidable circumstance" her mother mentioned.

Such an astronomical debt.

Howard watched coldly.

A mocking smile played on his lips.

"Seen enough?"

"All of this is what you and your mother owe me."

"Be obedient."

"Otherwise, if these evidences are sent out."

"Your mother will spend the rest of her life in prison."

Anna's heart sank to the bottom.

She had naively believed she could repay it.

Now it seemed like a complete joke.

Howard added leisurely.

"If you don't want her in jail."

"Do as I say."

"I'll keep these things safe."

"Quite a fair trade, isn't it?"

Fair.

Anna sneered inwardly.

Her freedom had never been in her own hands.

Bitterness welled up in her heart.

But now was not the time for sorrow.

She had to protect her mother.

Anna put down the papers.

Her voice was calm and steady.

"I agree."

"I hope you keep your promise."

Howard snorted lightly.

He put the documents back into the bag.

He wasn't worried about her resistance.

Controlling this mother and daughter was effortless for him.

Anna turned to leave.

"May I go now?"

Howard suddenly stopped her.

He studied her face.

"Your face is indeed beautiful."

"No wonder Adrian Sinclair is captivated."

Anna turned her face away.

She didn't want to hear such nonsense.

Howard stepped closer.

He lowered his voice.

"If you can be with Adrian Sinclair."

"I can wipe out all these debts."

Anna's expression froze.

"I'll remember that."

She walked around Howard and hurried downstairs.

Her mind was in turmoil.

Be with Adrian Sinclair.

Only he could say such a thing.

How Adrian treated her now.

She knew better than anyone.

There was no possibility between them anymore.
###Chapter 75

Uncle Nie quickly approached Adrian Sinclair.

He whispered a few words in a low voice.

Adrian's gaze turned icy cold.

His sharp eyes swept toward Cherry Lin like a blade.

Cherry was still weeping and confessing.

"The two children were right in front of me, but I couldn't stop it in time..."

"It's all my fault! When I saw those online attacks against Anna later, my heart broke with guilt."

Cherry spoke until her own eyes turned red.

Then she heard Adrian's cold voice. "Uncle Nie, see our guest out."

Cherry, lost in her self-pity, froze in shock.

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

See her out?

How could this be? She had acted so vulnerable and kind. Shouldn't they be comforting her?

Uncle Nie made a gesture with an expressionless face. "This way, please."

Cherry stood up uneasily.

She looked at Adrian pitifully, biting her lip. "Mr. Sinclair, did I say something wrong?"

So it was true. They got angry as soon as she mentioned failing to protect Anna.

They were blaming her.

They were the ones who made the principal fire her.

Grandma Sinclair's face was stern. "You didn't say anything wrong. We were wrong to let you in."

Before Cherry could react, Uncle Nie firmly escorted her out of the living room.

Anna looked confusedly at her uncle, then at her grandma.

What had happened?

She had just finished listening to Master's story about Mary Sue, and now Teacher Cherry was leaving?

She hadn't even caught the Playboy Ghost yet!

Master Ji floated mid-air. "Next time. Not here. It's bad energy."

The little girl instinctively waved. "Goodbye, Teacher Cherry..."

Merlin lifted Anna onto his shoulders. "Come on, Dad will take you to your room."

Anna was suddenly high up and let out a surprised "Ah!"

Then she laughed happily.

This was her first time riding a giant horse!

So high!

It felt like she could reach the chandelier. Could she touch the moon if they were outside?

Anna shouted excitedly, "Daddy, higher! Higher!"

Merlin gently bounced his shoulders.

Anna squealed with delight, even happier.

Grandma Sinclair worriedly cautioned, "Be careful! Don't drop her!"

Merlin was full of confidence. "It's fine. I could carry a plane and run. Carrying her is nothing. I won't drop her."

Grandma Sinclair watched the father-daughter pair speechlessly.

Anna excitedly listed, "I'll pick stars for Grandma, for Grandpa, for Uncle Adrian, Uncle Two, Uncle Five, Little Uncle... and for brothers and sisters..."

"Then for Daddy, for Little Five, for Grandpa Turtle..."

She named everyone in the family, even the pets.

Merlin's lips curved up.

He held her small hand and raised it high.

The father and daughter laughed and played their way upstairs.

Suddenly, there was a loud thud.

Anna covered her forehead. "Waaah! I hit the doorframe too!"

Merlin quickly checked. "How? I already bent down..."

Anna pouted. "Not low enough! Just a little bit lower!"

Merlin guiltily rubbed her forehead. "Mmm, Daddy's fault."

The Sinclair family didn't know whether to laugh or be angry.

This unreliable dad only knew how to mess things up for his kid!

Grandma Sinclair muttered as she hurried to get the first aid kit.

**

Cherry Lin stood outside the closed iron gate.

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

She whispered grievancely, "What did I even do wrong?"

She had genuinely come to apologize.

Why wouldn't the Sinclair family listen to her explanation...

Cherry felt both wronged and humiliated.

But mostly, she felt heartbroken.

Heartbroken that five excellent men didn't believe her.

An image appeared in her mind: In a princess's castle, five men who deeply loved her all left angrily because of a misunderstanding... The princess cried sadly, and a cherry blossom rain fell from the sky... The princess ran out and slipped...

Cherry blossom petals fell one after another, landing on her eyelashes that were like butterfly wings. The five knights hurried back, but the princess refused to open her eyes again. They were filled with regret...

Wuwu, so tragic. Cherry cried even harder, sobbing all the way home.

Zhou Xiao was waiting anxiously.

Seeing her return in tears, he immediately pulled her into his embrace.

"What's wrong? You didn't answer my calls!"

Cherry sobbed uncontrollably in his arms. "Brother Zhou Xiao... Did I really do something wrong? But I really didn't mean to..."

"Why did the principal fire me? Why won't the Sinclair family forgive me..."

Cherry cried loudly.

Zhou Xiao comforted her. "It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Be good, don't cry..."

Cherry cried for a while.

Then she suddenly saw her own tear-streaked face in the full-length mirror.

But Zhou Xiao, who was holding her, seemed so ordinary.

She used to think he was sunny and handsome, the best among her several boyfriends.

But after meeting Adrian and Merlin, Cherry felt he wasn't good enough for her.

Suddenly feeling bored, Cherry stopped crying.

An indescribable discomfort rose in her heart. A good girl like her should be comforted in the arms of someone like Adrian or Merlin.

Cherry pushed Zhou Xiao away abruptly and ran out.

Zhou Xiao stood frozen. "???"

"Little Cherry!" He hurriedly chased after her.

The hallway was already empty.

Zhou Xiao frantically pressed the elevator button, anxiously running downstairs.

After he left, the lights in the dark stairwell turned on.

A figure stood there...

It was Cherry.

She covered her mouth and whispered painfully, "I'm sorry, Brother Zhou Xiao. We can never be together again. Fate let us meet, but we cannot be together... Wuwu."

Heartbroken, Cherry... went to Yi Bin's house.

Yi Bin was both surprised and delighted. "Little Cherry, why are you here?"

Cherry thought she looked "haggard" as she glanced at Yi Bin.

She realized he was even less worthy of her.

She immediately burst into loud sobs.

But it was late.

She decided to finish crying tonight and leave tomorrow.

She and him were destined to have no future... Wuwu!

**

In Anna's room.

Grandma Sinclair held a towel wrapped with ice cubes against Anna's forehead.

Merlin reached out. "Let me do it."

It was unacceptable to let the elderly take care of the child so late...

Grandma Sinclair glared at him. "You be quiet!"

Merlin touched his nose and fell silent.

Anna obediently tilted her head back, letting Grandma apply the ice.

She said softly, "Grandma, I'm really okay!"

Grandma Sinclair: "You be quiet too!"

Father and daughter both fell silent at the same time.

Merlin coughed lightly and picked up a picture book by the bed. "Anna, Dad will tell you a story. What do you want to hear?"

Anna immediately raised her hand. "Daddy, I want to hear a brainless Mary Sue story!"

"The kind... where an aunt holds two uncles' hands and says she wants them both to be the daddies of her child."

Merlin: "???"

Grandma Sinclair: "??????"

An aunt... having a child with two men?!
###Chapter 76

"Mhm." A cool reply came from the other end of the line.

Anna Ross was surprised.

He didn't ask any further questions.

She didn't dare say more, afraid he might change his mind.

"I'll return to the company right after dropping her off."

The call ended.

She stared at her phone screen, a strange feeling stirring inside her.

The next day, Anna took a taxi to JFK Airport.

She looked around, searching for Mia Lawrence.

Suddenly, she noticed a man acting suspiciously behind Mia.

The man's hand was reaching toward Mia's backpack.

Anna's blood boiled.

How could this happen in broad daylight?

She rushed forward and grabbed the man.

She slapped him with all her strength.

The man's head snapped to the side.

A red mark appeared on his handsome face.

He stared at Anna in shock.

Mia turned around at the sound.

"Anna? What's wrong?"

Anna pointed at the man.

"He's a creep!"

The man quickly defended himself.

"My bag got tangled with her suitcase!"

Anna looked down.

Sure enough, their bag straps were twisted together.

Her face flushed bright red.

She frantically tried to untangle the straps.

"I'm so sorry. I misunderstood."

The man took a step back, his eyes wary.

"Make sure you see clearly before attacking next time."

He rubbed his cheek and walked away.

Anna stomped her foot in frustration.

"I'm such an idiot."

Mia patted her shoulder with a smile.

"You were just looking out for me."

Anna still felt terrible.

She decided to stay calmer in the future.

Mia checked the time.

"I need to head in now."

Anna quickly hugged her.

"Call me when you arrive."

Mia nodded firmly.

"Take good care of yourself."

They said their reluctant goodbyes.

Anna watched her disappear into the crowd.

She turned and hailed a taxi to Adrian Sinclair's company.
###Chapter 77

The thought of staying by Adrian Sinclair's side while also trying to persuade him to return to New York gave Anna Ross a headache.

The car stopped in front of the hotel.
Anna pushed the door open and hurried inside.
After the last incident, she didn't dare waste a single second.

As she entered the lobby, she saw Adrian speaking with a man.
They stood relaxed, chatting happily.
The man's back looked strangely familiar, but she couldn't place him.

She walked closer.
Adrian glanced up.
The man turned around simultaneously.

Their eyes met.
Both exclaimed in surprise.

"You!?"
"You?"

The man quickly covered his face and ducked behind Adrian, glaring at her. "What are you doing here?"
Alarm bells rang in his head—had this woman tracked him down just to hit him again?

Anna waved her hands hastily. "Don't misunderstand, I'm here for work!"
The man's expression clearly said, "Yeah, right."

Adrian's cold gaze swept over them. "You know each other?"
He turned to Anna, his eyes darkening. "Finished seeing your friend off? Back so soon?"

Before Anna could speak, the man exclaimed, "Adrian, you know this woman???"

His expression was overly dramatic.
Adrian gave him a cool look. "She's my executive assistant, Anna Ross."

"Executive assistant?"
The man raised an eyebrow, looking Anna over before grinning at Adrian. "Not bad, Adrian. Hiring such a feisty assistant now?"

Anna frowned.
Feisty? What kind of description was that?

A flicker of amusement passed through Adrian's eyes. "How do you know each other?"
He looked at Anna, his gaze meaningful.

Anna's scalp prickled.
Oh no, he's getting the wrong idea again.

"We don't!" the man said first. "But she slapped me out of nowhere this morning and called me a creep!"

Anna wished she could disappear on the spot.
Losing face like this in front of Adrian was social suicide.
She forced an apology. "I'm sorry, it was all a misunderstanding…"

Adrian's lips curved slightly, a faint smile playing on them.
The man waved a hand. "Forget it. I'm too much of a gentleman to fight with a lady. Let me introduce myself—Marcus Hill, Adrian's childhood friend."

Anna was secretly shocked.
So he was Adrian's friend!

The two resumed their conversation.
Anna tactfully stepped aside to wait.

After a moment, Marcus said pitifully, "I came to see you without even eating. Shouldn't you treat me to a proper meal?"

Adrian's gaze shifted to Anna on the sofa.
He turned and walked outside, gesturing for Marcus to follow.

Anna's heart lifted.
They were having a friends' meal—surely he'd let her go now?
She had just stood up to slip away when Adrian's cold voice cut through the air. "You're coming too."

###Chapter 78

Marcus Hill's gaze shifted, landing on Anna Ross.

A flicker of curiosity passed through his eyes.

What kind of Executive Assistant gets brought along for meals?

"Stop daydreaming."

Adrian Sinclair's voice was cold as he glanced at her.

Anna pressed her lips together and quietly followed.

She kept her eyes down, mentally cursing Adrian a thousand times over.

Humiliating her in front of another woman was bad enough.

Now he wouldn't even spare her in front of his friend.

The restaurant's lighting was soft.

A server guided them to a VIP private room.

Adrian and Marcus took their seats naturally.

Anna habitually stood to the side, a trace of self-mockery on her lips.

Marcus raised an eyebrow at her.

"Aren't you going to sit?"

Anna shook her head gently, not moving.

Marcus found this even more puzzling.

"Come here."

Adrian's voice held no warmth.

"Sit down and eat."

Anna was startled, hesitating before walking over.

She deliberately chose a seat further away from him.

Dishes arrived at the table one after another.

Marcus, already starving, began eating quickly.

Adrian picked up his utensils and glanced at Anna.

"Not eating?"

Anna looked up, meeting his gaze.

She hurriedly picked up her fork and knife, serving herself some food.

But her confusion only grew.

He wasn't giving her a hard time today.

The table fell into a temporary silence.

Adrian's phone suddenly rang.

He frowned and answered it.

"Grandpa."

Mr. Lowell's voice came through.

"Adrian, how are things with Chloe?"

"She called the other day saying she really likes you."

"It's fine." Adrian's tone was flat.

"Chloe is a good girl." The old man's voice sounded pleased.

Adrian didn't respond.

After a moment of silence, Mr. Lowell spoke again.

"Adrian, prepare to return to New York in the next couple of days."

Anna faintly heard the words "return to New York."

Her eyes lit up slightly.

"Understood, Grandpa." Adrian ended the call.

Marcus looked at him curiously.

"What's up?"

Adrian rubbed his thumb ring, his gaze sweeping over Anna.

"Grandpa wants me to go back to New York."

"Good idea." Marcus said between bites.

"You don't have any friends here anyway."

Anna remembered Howard Lowell's instructions and softly agreed.

"New York is definitely better than here."

Adrian turned his head to look at her.

"If I go back, will you come with me?"

As he asked, his fingers tightened slightly.

Anna's heart leapt with joy, but she kept her expression neutral.

"I'm your Executive Assistant. Of course I'll go with you."

This way she could complete Howard Lowell's task.

And she could see her best friend.
###Chapter 79

Adrian Sinclair didn't expect her to agree so readily.

Surprise flickered in his eyes.

Yet he felt an inexplicable sense of relief.

The previous gloom quietly dissipated.

His gaze turned to Anna Ross.

His voice remained flat. "Since you've decided to return to New York with me, wrap up your affairs in San Francisco these next few days."

"Don't cause a last-minute mess and create trouble for me."

Anna quickly nodded.

"Don't worry, I won't cause you any trouble."

She had finally completed Howard Lowell's task.

Her mother was temporarily safe.

Compared to the potential harm her mother might face, staying by Adrian's side seemed less frightening.

She even felt that Adrian seemed different from before.

Adrian watched her poorly concealed happy expression.

He paused slightly.

Did she actually want to stay by his side?

Anna looked up to get some food.

She directly met his deep gaze.

His intense stare made her flush.

She hurriedly lowered her head.

Adrian let out a very soft laugh.

It was so quiet it seemed like just a breath.

Marcus Hill watched their charged exchange.

He suddenly felt excessively like a third wheel.

He deliberately exclaimed dramatically. "Wow, since when did our Mr. Sinclair become so considerate?"

"Actually giving someone time to handle personal matters?"

"You were never like this before."

His eyes darted between them.

Anna nearly choked hearing the word "considerate."

She couldn't associate Adrian with gentleness at all.

Adrian shot him a cold glance.

Marcus immediately shut up.

He petulantly piled food onto his plate.

He grumbled inwardly.

So gentle with the girl.

So cold with his bro.

......

Anna felt like she was sitting on pins and needles.

Adrian's gaze kept falling on her.

She needed an excuse to get some air.

Noticing several dishes hadn't arrived yet.

She had an idea.

"You two keep eating. I'll go check on the remaining dishes."

"Mhm." Adrian glanced at the empty plates and didn't stop her.

Anna stood up and left.

She carefully closed the door behind her.

Marcus stared thoughtfully at the closed door.

He suddenly leaned in and asked. "Sinclair, be honest. What's your real relationship with that girl?"

Based on his understanding of Adrian, it definitely wasn't just an executive assistant.

Adrian glanced at him but didn't respond.

Marcus persisted. "Why so secretive? If you like her, I can help, bro."

He winked, looking like he knew exactly what was going on.

"Mind your own business." Adrian said leisurely. "Worry about yourself first. I heard your family is pushing marriage hard?"

"Ugh, don't remind me." Marcus's face immediately fell. He put down his fork and knife and slumped into his chair. "I came to San Francisco specifically to avoid this."

"My family forced an arranged marriage on me. But I don't want that kind of relationship."
###Chapter 80

Marcus Hill pulled a cigarette from the pack.

He lit it and took a deep drag.

He then offered the pack to Adrian Sinclair.

Adrian raised a hand to decline. "I quit."

His gaze rested calmly on Marcus's face. "So you came to San Francisco to escape an arranged marriage?"

Marcus awkwardly withdrew his hand and put the cigarette back.

He gave a self-mocking smile. "I don't like marriages that are decided for me."

"If possible, I'd rather meet the person I want to spend my life with on my own."

Even though he knew the hope was slim, he stubbornly believed in love.

A marriage of convenience was never the future he wanted.

Smoke curled between them.

Adrian's voice was low. "It's useless."

"For people like us, marriage is never our own decision."

"In the face of family interests, personal feelings mean nothing."

Marcus's fingers holding the cigarette paused. "What about you? Will you accept your family's arrangement?"

Adrian's eyes darkened, his emotions unreadable.

But Marcus caught a flash of loneliness in his eyes.

Remembering the phone call earlier, Marcus pressed further. "The arranged marriage your grandpa set up for you, is it that Miss Chloe from the phone? Will you marry her?"

Adrian didn't answer immediately.

He picked up his wine glass, swirled it gently, and took a sip before speaking slowly. "I think... I will marry the person I love."

The person he loves?

Marcus immediately perked up.

He instantly thought of Anna Ross.

A teasing smile spread across his face. "You're not talking about Anna Ross, are you?"

No wonder Adrian was so unusually attentive to that girl. So he had feelings for her.

"You just denied it earlier! If you like her, go for it!"

"And she is really beautiful. I haven't seen a girl that stunning in years. She suits you well."

Marcus was getting carried away, completely missing the sudden change in Adrian's expression.

Adrian shot him a cold glance, his gaze terrifyingly intense. "Can't all this food shut you up?"

"If you mention this again, I won't mind going back to New York to help finalize your marriage arrangements."

Marcus immediately fell silent.

He knew Adrian too well; his word was law.

If Adrian really got involved in his marriage plans, there would be no escape.

。。。。。。。。

Anna Ross walked out of the private room, her heart light with joy.

She no longer had to worry about Howard Lowell targeting her mother.

Moving to New York would also give her more freedom.

Lost in thought, she didn't notice the server approaching with a bowl of soup.

The server was also looking down, checking the table number, and didn't see her coming.

"Ah!"

Anna gasped in shock.

A searing pain shot through the back of her hand.

The scalding hot soup had spilled all over it.
###Chapter 81

The server turned with a pot of hot soup.

She didn't notice someone behind her.

Scalding broth splashed out instantly.

Anna Ross felt a sharp sting on the back of her hand.

The server's face turned pale.

She apologized repeatedly. "I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there."

She frantically searched for napkins.

Anna's hand was already red and swollen.

The soup wasn't at its hottest temperature.

But her skin still burned with a fierce pain.

Nearby diners turned to look.

The server looked like she was about to cry.

"Let me take you to the hospital?"

Anna shook her head. "It's fine."

She spoke softly to reassure her. "I wasn't paying attention either."

The server froze.

She hadn't expected such understanding.

Anna didn't want to embarrass her further.

She turned toward the restroom.

Footsteps hurried after her.

"Anna?"

Lucas Evans appeared in the hallway.

His gaze fell on her hand.

He tensed immediately. "What happened?"

Before she could answer.

He took her wrist.

He led her quickly to the restroom.

Anna glanced back over her shoulder.

Adrian Sinclair was still in the private room.

She instinctively pulled away.

"I can manage."

Her voice held a distinct coolness.

Lucas stopped walking.

Disappointment flickered in his eyes.

But he still followed behind her.

Keeping a distance of three steps.

Cold water ran over her skin.

The stinging sensation eased slightly.

The mirror reflected Lucas's figure.

He suddenly turned and left.

Anna breathed a small sigh of relief.

She thought he had finally gone.

The sound of running water masked approaching footsteps.

She looked down to check her injury.

The redness on her hand hadn't faded.

Hurried steps came from outside the door.

Lucas returned with a small pharmacy bag.

Worry filled his eyes.
###Chapter 82

The sound of running water stopped.

Anna Ross dried her hands and turned around.

Lucas Evans stood not far away.

He held a package of medicine and gauze.

His gaze was full of concern as he looked at her.

"Let me bandage that for you," he said, shaking the medical supplies slightly.

Anna paused.

She hadn't realized he went specifically to buy medicine.

A flicker of warmth touched her heart.

She nodded gently. "Alright. Thank you."

They walked to the sofa in the lounge area and sat down.

Lucas knelt before her.

He applied the medicine with gentle movements.

The cotton swab, soaked in antiseptic lotion, brushed over the burn.

Anna's fingertips trembled slightly.

"Does it hurt?" he asked, looking up.

"No," she shook her head.

Her eyes, however, darted around nervously.

She was afraid someone might see this.

The gauze was quickly and neatly applied.

Anna stood up immediately.

She maintained a distance of one step between them.

"Thank you, Lucas."

He gathered the medical supplies.

He offered a gentle smile. "How did you get so careless?"

"I bumped into a server earlier and got splashed with hot soup," she explained.

Her gaze flickered toward the hallway.

The floor had already been cleaned.

Lucas was about to speak.

Her phone suddenly rang.

Seeing the caller ID, Anna's expression shifted slightly.

It was Adrian Sinclair.

She answered the call quickly.

A low, displeased voice came from the other end. "The food is all served. Where are you, the one who was supposed to hurry them along?"

"I'll be right back," she responded hastily.

The call ended abruptly.

She looked at Lucas. "I have to go."

Her wrist was gently held.

Lucas's eyes were dark and unreadable.

He was silent for a moment before speaking. "Anna, he's just your boss. You don't need to be at his beck and call."

Anna lowered her gaze.

She looked at his hand holding hers.

A bitter smile touched her lips. "This is my job."

Lucas frowned deeply.

His voice was filled with heartache. "If you're unhappy, I can help you."
###Chapter 83

He stated it so bluntly.

Anna Ross was stunned.

She asked herself.

Could she really just leave like this?

The answer was no.

She shook her head gently.

Anna offered a faint smile. "No, Lucas."

"I'm doing fine as I am."

"You don't need to do these things for me."

"It's not worth it."

She wasn't oblivious.

She had sensed Lucas's feelings since their university days.

How could she not notice?

But her current situation was too messy.

How could she dare drag someone else into her troubles?

Lucas was rejected.

His expression faltered.

His voice turned hoarse. "But I can feel you're unhappy."

"Why force yourself to endure all this?"

He said those words.

But inwardly, he cursed himself.

His affection for Anna was no less than Adrian Sinclair's.

They had just met too late.

By then, Adrian was already by her side.

All his deeper feelings had to remain buried.

Now they had reunited.

He learned she was single.

He was overjoyed, thinking his chance had finally come.

Yet, she still turned him down.

......

Anna listened.

A wave of powerlessness washed over her.

If she didn't force herself to endure this,

her mother would suffer even greater harm.

She couldn't bear that.

She wouldn't allow it.

She composed herself.

She forced a light tone. "I'm doing quite well."

"That's just how being an Executive Assistant is. Not much freedom."

"But the pay is excellent."

"I'm not unwilling."

Lucas gave a self-mocking laugh.

Endless sorrow filled his eyes.

She had said that.

What more could he say?

Pushing further would be crossing a line.

He suppressed his emotions.

He slowly released her hand.

"You should head back now."

Anna felt his disappointment.

But what could she do?

They were just friends.

Besides gratitude,

she had nothing to give him.

She thanked him softly.

She turned and walked toward the private room.

Lucas stood rooted in place.

He watched her retreating figure wistfully.

He didn't move until she disappeared around the corner.

Then he lowered his head and left.

The warmth of her hand still lingered in his palm.

He smiled bitterly.

He stopped thinking about it.

Anna reached the private room door.

She steadied her emotions and pushed the door open.

Two pairs of eyes immediately turned toward her.

"Miss Ross, come eat quickly."

"The food has been served for a while."

"We've been waiting for you."

Marcus Hill broke the silence.

He rotated several good dishes to place them in front of her.

Anna quickly explained. "My apologies."

"I was held up by something outside."

Marcus didn't press further.

He wasn't anxious himself.

But he knew Adrian was.

That man had glanced at the door more than once.

His entire face was etched with worry.
###Chapter 84

Adrian Sinclair’s gaze swept over her bandaged hand.
His brow furrowed slightly.
“What happened to your hand?”

Anna Ross had just sat down.
His question made her instinctively hide her hand behind her back.
“It’s just a minor burn. It’s already been treated.”

He leaned forward abruptly.
His fingers closed around her wrist.
He pulled the bandage aside to examine the injury.

His pupils contracted at the sight of the red, swollen wound.
His tone grew colder.
“Clumsy. Can’t even serve a dish without getting hurt?”

The cold air stung the raw skin.
Anna bit her lip against the pain.
Her eyelashes fluttered down.
Her voice trembled softly.
“I wasn’t paying enough attention.”

Marcus Hill glimpsed the angry-looking burn.
He averted his eyes, unable to bear the sight.
Her fair skin made the wound appear even more severe.

Adrian released her hand with a dismissive flick.
His voice was laced with sarcasm.
“Did you injure yourself on purpose to skip work?”

Anna silently rewrapped the bandage.
Resentment churned inside her.
He had seen the wound clearly.
He had deliberately pulled the bandage off.
Now he was accusing her falsely.

She was about to defend herself when her phone vibrated.
A message from Adrian appeared.
It contained an address.

His voice was icy.
“Don’t delay our return to New York.
Go get your hand treated now.
This doctor is a friend of mine.”

He picked up his glass of red wine.
He didn’t look at her again.

Anna glanced at her phone.
She replied in a low voice, “Okay.”
She didn’t want her injury to affect her work either.
Even if he mocked her, she would accept it.

Marcus watched Adrian’s feigned indifference.
He couldn’t help interjecting.
“Don’t listen to his tough talk.
He’s obviously worried about you.
He just has a strange way of showing it.”

He turned to Adrian with a teasing smile.
“Your acting is terrible.
If you care about someone, just say it.
Who acts like this when they’re in love?”

Anna looked at Marcus nervously.
She feared he would anger Adrian.
She knew perfectly well.
Adrian didn’t care about her.
He only enjoyed tormenting her.

Adrian watched her forced smile.
An inexplicable irritation rose within him.
He loosened his tie impatiently.
His voice was cold.
“You believe whatever he says?
Don’t flatter yourself.”

Heat rushed to Anna’s cheeks.
Frustration tightened in her chest.
She had never thought that!

Marcus shook his head helplessly.
With the way Adrian communicated,
Even Cupid’s steel cable would snap.
###Chapter 85

"Don't be afraid."

Wen Sunan clenched his fists.

This time, he must protect Wen Xiaoning.

"The police are here, but it won't help."

"We didn't do anything wrong."

Before his words faded, several officers approached swiftly.

The leader directly flashed his badge, his gaze locking onto Wen Xiaoning.

"Miss Wen."

"You are suspected of intentionally harming Cheng Ru, and planning to lure Xu Tiancheng."

"The evidence is conclusive. Please cooperate and come with us for investigation."

Wen Sunan froze completely on the spot.

He snapped back to reality, quickly shielding Wen Xiaoning behind him.

"Are you mistaken?"

"The one who hurt people is Ling Yujin! The one bullying others is Xu Tiancheng!"

The officer's expression remained stern.

"We don't make wrongful arrests."

"The evidence chain is complete. The case is clear."

Wen Sunan's lips trembled.

He could tell the police must have solid evidence.

Wen Xiaoning's tears streamed down.

"I've been wrongfully accused!"

"You... you've all been bribed by Ling Yujin!"

Ling Yujin let out a scornful laugh.

"Bribe the police?"

"Your imagination is quite vivid."

He took a step forward, his presence overwhelming.

"Falsely accusing law enforcement adds to your charges."

Wen Xiaoning instantly fell silent.

Her face turned deathly pale.

The officers said no more.

They directly escorted her away.

Wen Sunan stood rooted to the spot.

He watched helplessly as Wen Xiaoning was taken away.

His fingers dug into his palms, his eyes bloodshot.

He suddenly turned and glared at Ling Yujin.

"You think wealth and power let you do whatever you want?"

"I don't acknowledge you as my brother! You're not worthy!"

Ling Yujin's gaze was indifferent.

"My wealth and power don't mean I abuse them."

"Nor does it mean I'll tolerate slander."

He coldly regarded Wen Sunan.

"Impulsive and emotional when things happen."

"Are you really our mother's son?"

A vein bulged on Wen Sunan's temple.

"Say that again!"

"It remains the same no matter how many times I say it."

Ling Yujin turned to leave.

Wen Sunan roared and charged forward.

His fist swung out fiercely—

But Ling Yujin easily intercepted it.

"Looking for another beating?"

"You're no match for me."

Wen Sunan's eyes were crimson.

"Ling Yujin—!"

"Stop!"

A woman's voice suddenly rang out from the end of the corridor.
###Chapter 86

His words were laced with venom.

Lucas Evans simply smiled faintly. "San Francisco is too small. We keep running into each other."

He nodded politely. "I have matters to attend to. I'll take my leave."

He didn't look at Anna Ross.
He knew if Adrian Sinclair noticed anything, she would only retreat further.

Anna was relieved there was no conflict this time.
She looked up and met Adrian's icy, warning gaze.
A shiver ran through her.

Marcus Hill broke the tension. "Let's not stand outside. Head back to the hotel first."
He rubbed his shoulder, complaining. "I just want to crash and sleep."
He got into the car and slumped into the passenger seat.

Anna had no choice but to sit in the backseat next to Adrian.
The entire ride was agonizing.
Adrian remained grim-faced, the atmosphere around him terrifyingly heavy.

The car finally stopped at the hotel entrance.
Anna practically fled the vehicle.
Adrian only gave her a lazy glance, saying nothing.

Marcus, caught between them, felt suffocated.
He waved his hand upon entering the hotel. "I won't disturb you. I'll get my own room."
He dashed off, leaving them alone.

Anna's anxiety grew.
Marcus's presence had eased the tension.
Now alone with Adrian, she feared he might lose control again.

Adrian ignored Marcus and headed straight for the elevator.
Anna followed silently.
The silence allowed her to relax slightly.

They reached the Presidential Suite door.
Adrian swiped the key card.
She hesitated, afraid to enter.

"Do I need to invite you in?" His cold eyes swept over her.
She lowered her head and entered.
The door slammed shut. The sound of the lock clicking made her heart race.

"Urging the food was just an excuse to see Lucas Evans?" He suddenly closed in, trapping her against the wall.
Anna was startled. She denied softly, "I wasn't meeting him."

Adrian sneered. "You're a terrible liar."
He grabbed her wrist and pinned her against the wall.
Anna grunted in pain. She tried to escape, but he held her firmly.

He leaned in and kissed her.
She clenched her teeth, but he forced them apart roughly.
Her eyes widened. She bit down hard.

The taste of blood spread in her mouth.
Adrian winced and let go, wiping his lip. "Learning to fight back now?"
He gripped her chin. "Name your price. How much to be with me?"

Anna bit her lip, her body trembling slightly.
###Chapter 87

A chill spread from her feet throughout her entire body.

She clenched her teeth.

She absolutely could not cry in front of him.

This demon did not deserve to see her vulnerability.

Adrian Sinclair’s movements halted.

An inexplicable tenderness stirred in his heart.

He raised his hand, intending to touch her cheek.

His fingertips hovered mid-air before slowly withdrawing.

Perhaps he had gone too far.

He took two steps back and took off his jacket.

The dark suit was casually tossed onto the sofa.

A cigarette case lay quietly on the coffee table.

He pulled one out and lit it.

The crimson glow flickered at his fingertips.

Amidst the swirling smoke, his gaze gradually grew distant.

In a daze, he saw the past again.

Her face was tilted up, smiling sweetly at him.

Those arguments and betrayals seemed never to have happened.

They were still the most intimate lovers.

The cigarette butt gradually burned down.

He reached out and stubbed it out in the ashtray.

He sank deep into the sofa back.

His long fingers massaged his aching temples.

Anna Ross gradually calmed her breathing.

Watching his lonely back, she felt somewhat dazed.

She quickly shook her head inwardly.

How could he possibly feel lonely?

Thinking of her mother's debt, she mustered her courage and approached.

Yet she didn't know how to begin.

Adrian’s cold voice broke the silence. "Just say what you want."

"Can... can I get a raise?" Her voice was as faint as a mosquito's hum.

He glanced at her sideways.

She hurried to explain. "Working with you is mentally and physically exhausting. A raise is reasonable, right?"

She immediately regretted her words.

Adrian watched her quietly.

After a long moment, the corner of his mouth lifted. "Fine."

Anna’s eyes lit up.

She hadn't expected him to agree so readily.

A sarcastic laugh suddenly rang out. "Did the money from selling the bag run out that quickly?"

He showed her a photo on his phone.

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

But she forced herself to appear calm. "Say whatever you want."

The expected mockery never came.

He actually deleted the photo right in front of her.

Anna stood frozen in place.

She didn't understand why his attitude had suddenly changed.

The phone was tossed carelessly back onto the coffee table.

He leaned lazily against the sofa. "It seems you're really short on money."

She remained silent, clenching her fingers.

"How much did that Sugar Daddy give you before?" He raised an eyebrow. "I'll double it."

"Be with me. I'll ensure you never want for anything."

His flippant words pierced her heart like needles.

Anna lowered her eyelids.

She uttered three words softly. "I don't need it."

This scar lay between them.

It was the bitter fruit she herself had sown.

There was nothing left to say.
###Chapter 88

A flicker of disappointment passed through Adrian Sinclair's eyes.

It was quickly concealed.

His sharp gaze locked onto her face.

His long fingers slowly unfolded.

His voice was low and clear.

"My words stand forever."

"You can come to me anytime you need."

.........

"You'll never see that day."

"Even if you offer me all the money in the world."

"I won't be with you."

Anna Ross composed herself.

She looked at him with calm detachment.

Cool and collected like a bystander.

Adrian's jaw tightened.

He watched her in silence.

He didn't understand.

If she was unwilling,

why had she agreed to return to New York with him?

Anna averted her gaze.

Her voice was icy.

"Since we're going to New York,"

"I should go pack now."

"I wouldn't want to waste your time."

With that, she pulled the door open.

She left without looking back.

The moment the door closed,

Adrian's tense expression finally relaxed.

He stared at the door.

A low laugh escaped him.

The sound echoed through the empty room.

He leaned back on the sofa.

Gazing at the ceiling.

He felt nothing but irony.

Even with all his wealth now,

she still refused to return to him.

Anna hurried out of the hotel.

Tears she had been holding back finally fell.

She leaned against a stone pillar.

Letting herself cry openly.

She didn't understand the point of this entanglement.

It was just mutual hurt.

She glanced back at the hotel.

She would leave him eventually.

It was better for both of them.

She returned home to pack.

She looked around her small apartment with reluctance.

Though she hadn't lived here long,

she cherished the freedom it represented.

Cramped as it was,

no one here could threaten her.

Reluctant or not, she had to go.

She had more important matters.

Finally, she closed the door softly.

Now she had to visit her mother.

She didn't know when she'd be back.

She took a taxi to Howard Lowell's residence.

Anna looked up.

She hoped she wouldn't run into Howard.

She really didn't want to see him.

The lobby was empty.

She set her luggage down and went upstairs.

Pushing open her mother's door,

she saw the familiar figure on the bed.

Anna called softly,

"Mom."

Vivian Lowell smiled at the sight of her daughter.

She sat up quickly.

"Anna, what brings you back?"

Anna lowered her head.

Her voice choked slightly.

"Mom, I'm leaving San Francisco."

"When did this happen?"

Vivian asked in surprise.

"It was just decided."

"I'm going with Adrian Sinclair."

Vivian immediately understood her daughter's situation.

She stroked Anna's hair lovingly.

"Take care of yourself over there."

Anna hugged her mother.

Fighting back tears, she urged,

"While I'm gone,"

"you must take good care of yourself."

Vivian closed her eyes.

Burying her reluctance deep inside.

But she couldn't ask her daughter to stay.
###Chapter 89

Anna Ross nestled in her mother's embrace for a long time.

She suddenly remembered Howard Lowell mentioning issues at the branch company.

Yet she hadn't heard any rumors about it.

She couldn't help feeling puzzled.

She asked softly, "Mom, do you know what's happening at the company?"

Vivian Lowell shook her head.

"He never tells me anything. Especially not company matters."

Her tone carried self-mockery.

Anna realized she had asked the wrong person.

Since the fake pregnancy incident, Howard had shown no affection for her mother.

He was guarded everywhere.

How would he share such things with her?

She sighed. "It's nothing. I was just asking casually. Don't dwell on it, Mom."

Vivian nodded, then worriedly said, "What about you going to New York alone? I'm really concerned about you being there by yourself."

Anna suppressed her emotions.

She smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry. Since Adrian Sinclair is taking me, he'll arrange everything."

She didn't even believe her own words.

Vivian gently touched her face.

"Take good care of yourself," she said tenderly.

Anna's nose tingled with emotion.

She obediently agreed. "Wait for me, Mom. I'll find a way to take you away. We'll live well together. No more depending on others."

She must repay the debt quickly.

Only then could she move forward without worries.

Vivian nodded.

Neither mother nor daughter knew when that day would come.

But having hope was better than having none.

They held each other a while longer.

Anna reluctantly said, "Mom, it's getting late. I should go. Staying longer might mean running into Howard."

Vivian paused, then forced a smile as she patted Anna's head.

"Be careful on the road. Remember to let me know you've arrived safely in New York."

Anna nodded.

She gently kissed her mother's cheek. "Don't worry. I will."

She stood up to leave.

Vivian wanted to see her out, but Anna stopped her.

Though reluctant, this was something she had to do.

In the taxi, she checked her phone.

Adrian hadn't messaged yet.

Was he still handling unfinished business?

She decided to return to her rented apartment first.

The lease was paid for a year.

She still had the right to use it.

Sitting on the sofa, she called Mia Lawrence.

The call was answered instantly. "Anna, missing me already?"

Hearing her friend's voice, Anna relaxed.

She laughed. "Yes, I miss you. How are things there?"

Mia said freely, "Quite good. I feel very free now."

Free.

When would she ever experience such freedom?

Anna said wistfully, "Mia, I'm coming to New York too."

"What? You're coming? That's great!"

"But it's for work. With Adrian Sinclair."

At this, she let out a long sigh.
###Chapter 90

Shaoling Mu stepped out of the bathroom.

Water droplets fell from the ends of his hair.

The hotel bathrobe hung loosely, tied around his waist.

A towel was casually draped over his neck.

Warm steam lingered around him.

His usual stern aura had softened slightly.

A lazy sensuality quietly emerged.

Nianmu's breath hitched.

Only four words remained in her mind.

Devilishly alluring.

Shaoling dried his hair with the towel.

He walked to the sofa and sat down.

He rested his arm lightly on the coffee table.

He signaled for her to apply the medicine.

Nianmu unscrewed the cap of the alcohol bottle.

She noticed the concentration label.

Her movements paused slightly.

"Medical alcohol might be a bit harsh."

"It's fine." Shaoling's voice was softened by the steam.

Low and husky.

Taotao sat cross-legged on the carpet.

He looked up and added.

"Daddy isn't afraid of pain."

Nianmu took a cotton swab and dipped it in alcohol.

She carefully cleaned around the wound.

Shaoling had deliberately avoided the injury while showering.

After the dried blood was wiped away.

The depth of the cut became visible.

She sighed softly.

"Any deeper and it would have needed stitches."

The alcohol touched his skin.

His brow didn't flinch.

He silently watched her movements.

Nianmu applied the medicine with a gentle touch.

Afraid of causing him pain.

After disinfecting.

She took a powder from her bag.

She sprinkled it evenly over the wound.

"What is this?" Shaoling asked.

"Homemade powder. It promotes healing. It's harmless." Nianmu explained.

She always carried these medical supplies with her.

Just in case.

"What else do you keep in your bag?" A hint of curiosity flashed in Shaoling's eyes.

Last time at the banquet, she had carried an antidote.

Now it was medicinal powder.

Nianmu carefully bandaged the wound with gauze.

Hearing his question.

Her long eyelashes lowered.

"Just daily necessities."

Taotao curiously played with her bag placed nearby.

He suddenly pulled off a small object.

"Sister, what is this?"

Nianmu turned to look.

Her pupils constricted sharply.

Taotao was holding a miniature tracker.

"Where did you find it?" Her voice tightened slightly.

"It was stuck on the outside of the bag." Taotao held up the tracker.

His face full of confusion.

Shaoling recognized the device immediately.

"Did those two men appear out of nowhere?"

Nianmu shook her head.

Her thoughts raced.

It felt strange.

The tracker must have been planted by those two male students during the chaos.

Otherwise, how could they have followed them so precisely to the hotel.

"I saw them at the school lecture today. They are students." She avoided the main point.

"Quite popular." Shaoling had already guessed most of it.

"The tracker is theirs."

"Yes." Nianmu finished bandaging.

She tied a neat knot.

She took the tracker from Taotao.

The device was small.

Its capabilities were unknown.

She had initially thought it was unrelated to Abel.

But now she had to be cautious.

She needed to analyze the tracker's origin quickly.

She stood up and picked up her backpack and paper bag.

"Mr. Mu, the wound is bandaged. Avoid getting it wet for the next two days. Remember to change the dressing. I'll leave the powder with you. I should go now."

Shaoling nodded.

He noticed her expression change when she saw the tracker.

An ordinary person might not recognize such a device.

But she identified it immediately.

Coupled with her earlier combat skills.

All clues pointed to one fact—

She was not simple.

Shuo Feng and Qing Yu's investigation.

Perhaps it needed to be restarted.

The reports never mentioned her knowledge of martial arts.

Nor her proficiency with tech products.

Taotao saw her preparing to leave.

He hurriedly scrambled up.

"Sister..."

Nianmu had already reached the door.

Hearing his voice, she turned back.

She offered an apologetic smile.

"Taotao, I have something to do tonight. Be good and rest, okay?"

"Okay..." The child's smile instantly faded.

He watched her longingly as she closed the door and left.

He turned and threw himself onto the sofa.

"Daddy, does sister hate me?"

"She doesn't hate you." Shaoling picked up the medicine bottle and examined it.

The guilt in her eyes earlier was clear.

"Then why doesn't she take me?" Taotao asked闷闷不乐地.

"She has important matters." Shaoling rubbed the glass bottle.

Nianmu's expression when she saw the tracker.

She clearly wanted to dismantle and study it.

He played with the colorless medicine bottle.

His gaze deepened.

Though he didn't know how many secrets she still hid.

What she had already revealed.

Was enough to prove her complexity.

Taotao sighed in frustration.

"Another night sleeping alone."

Shaoling paused slightly at his words.

He suddenly wondered.

Why was his son so attached to her?

Could it be that around her...

He could sleep exceptionally soundly?

...

Nianmu brought the tracker back.

She borrowed a set of precision tools from the front desk.

A moment later, a waiter delivered the toolbox.

"Ma'am, do you need a repair technician? We can arrange one."

"No need. I can handle it myself. Thank you." She politely declined and closed the door.

She placed the tracker on the desk.

A small red light blinked weakly.

Indicating it was still active.

Unable to find a switch.

She directly dismantled the outer shell.

The internal structure determined the tracking range.

The quality of the components reflected the cost.

This information was enough to determine—

Whether it came from Abel's hands.

Nianmu carefully inspected the components.

Her tense nerves gradually relaxed.

It was just a cheap product from a small workshop.

It would fail beyond a certain range.
###Chapter 91

Adrian Sinclair glanced at her.

He felt a hint of exasperation toward his troublesome cousin.

His voice was flat. "It's getting late. You should head back to your room."

Sophia Roscente checked her watch.

It was indeed very late.

She offered a sweet smile. "I'm heading back now, brothers."

"Don't stay up too late."

"Goodnight!"

She skipped out of the room.

Adrian rubbed his temples.

She acted like a child despite her age.

So irresponsible.

Marcus Hill watched the doorway.

He stood and walked to the refrigerator.

He pulled out two cans of beer.

He tossed one to Adrian.

Adrian caught it deftly.

The can made a crisp sound.

The aroma of beer filled the air.

They clinked their cans lightly.

Marcus took a sip.

He seemed thoughtful. "She's quite cute, your cousin."

"I've seen her twice before."

"Never really talked to her properly."

Adrian's expression darkened instantly.

His eyes turned deep and shadowed.

He stared intently at Marcus.

It felt like he was looking at an enemy.

The room temperature seemed to drop.

Marcus felt uneasy under his gaze.

He couldn't help asking, "Why are you looking at me like that?"

"It's kind of creepy."

Adrian's voice was low. "Don't get any ideas about her."

"Just take good care of her."

His tone carried a clear warning.

It sent a chill down Marcus's spine.

Marcus nearly choked.

He hadn't expected Adrian to be so protective.

He quickly assured him, "Don't worry."

"I came here for some peace and quiet."

"I'm not looking for trouble."

He found relationships too complicated.

He had no interest in a girlfriend right now.

So Sophia was perfectly safe.

Adrian's expression softened slightly.

They chatted about other things for a while.

Before they knew it, the beer was finished.

Marcus was slightly tipsy.

He waved a hand. "I'm heading back to sleep."

"You should rest early too."

The room fell quiet again.

Adrian set down his empty can.

He took out his phone and scrolled through his contacts.

He stopped at Anna Ross's name.

It was so late.

She was probably asleep.

He was about to send a message.

But an incoming call interrupted him.

It was his grandpa.

He answered the call.

Grandpa Lowell's voice was excited. "Chloe is also going to New York."

"Take her with you."

"Look after her on the way."

Adrian frowned deeply.

Displeasure flashed in his eyes.

But his grandpa had asked.

He couldn't refuse.

He replied softly, "Okay."

"Don't worry, Grandpa."

"I'll take good care of her."

Grandpa Lowell hung up, satisfied.

He said a car would come for them tomorrow.

He reminded Adrian to get some rest.

Adrian walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

His dark eyes gazed down at the street below.

Neon lights flickered.

Cars streamed like woven threads.

He turned and leaned against the glass.

He typed out a message to Anna.

He pressed send.

Anna was fast asleep.

The message alert jolted her awake.

Seeing Adrian's name, she gritted her teeth in frustration.

Why now of all times?

Right when she was about to fall asleep.

He was definitely doing this on purpose.
###Chapter 92

Anna stared at her phone screen and couldn't help but mutter a complaint under her breath.

But the message content made her bolt upright from her bed instantly.

"What? He wants me to pick up Chloe Valentine?"

Has Adrian lost his mind? That's his own fiancée. Instead of picking her up himself, he's ordering an outsider like her to do it.

......

Another message popped up.

He told her to pack her luggage and return to New York tomorrow.

It included Chloe's detailed address.

Anna felt her vision darken.

Adrian absolutely couldn't bear to see her have a single moment of peace.

She collapsed back onto her pillow with a bitter smile.

Who made her his Executive Assistant now.

She just got him to raise her salary. She couldn't refuse this task.

After a bit of self-consolation, she replied with a simple "Okay."

She put her phone down and tried to go back to sleep.

Early the next morning, Anna hailed a taxi with her luggage to pick up Chloe.

When she arrived at the destination, Chloe was already waiting with her suitcase.

A sweet smile was spread across her face.

But that smile froze the moment Anna stepped out of the car.

Chloe's face fell with disappointment when she saw who it was.

She rushed to the car and peered inside, searching for any sign of Adrian.

She found nothing.

She turned to Anna and asked unwillingly, "Where's Adrian? Why didn't he come?"

Anna felt helpless.

Heaven knows what whims Adrian was following.

She still explained gently, "Mr. Sinclair is busy with matters. He specifically instructed me to pick you up."

Hearing the word "busy," Chloe's expression softened slightly.

She got into the car with Anna.

Silence filled the journey.

Chloe glanced sideways at Anna.

A surge of astonishment rose within her.

Anna was indeed beautiful, fresh and elegant.

Even without makeup, she outshone Chloe's full glamour.

After watching for a long while, Chloe suddenly asked, "You and Adrian just met?"

Anna's heart tightened.

But her expression remained calm. "Yes, I applied for a job and happened to join the company."

Chloe nodded.

"What do you think of him? I noticed he treats you quite specially."

The question became increasingly pointed.

Anna felt like she was sitting on pins and needles.

To tell the truth, Adrian was a demon who tormented her.

But she could only smile. "Mr. Sinclair is very good to all his subordinates. I don't have much contact with him. I'm very busy with work every day."

Chloe didn't press further.

This answer secretly pleased her.

As long as she confirmed their relationship was ordinary, that was enough.
###Chapter 93

Seeing she wouldn't press further, Anna Ross finally relaxed her tense nerves.

She knew well of Chloe Valentine's obsession with Adrian Sinclair.

If it could set her mind at ease, then so be it.

Afraid Anna might grow suspicious, Chloe changed the subject with a smile. "What kind of work does an Executive Assistant usually handle?"

Anna paused briefly.

Was she still testing her?

After a moment of silence, she answered calmly. "Daily document processing, scheduling the boss's itinerary, and occasionally handling unexpected matters."

"I see. Thank you." Chloe smiled politely, then leaned back in her seat and fell silent.

Anna looked away and did not speak further.

She actually thought Chloe had a gentle personality, striking looks, and loved Adrian so deeply...

The car stopped in front of the hotel.

Adrian was already waiting outside.

Chloe's eyes lit up. She pushed the car door open and rushed toward him.

"Adrian!"

She threw her arms around him in a tight embrace.

Anna turned her face away and silently walked to the trunk to retrieve the luggage.

As she dragged the suitcase over to them, Adrian spoke indifferently. "Let's go."

Go?

Before Anna could process it, Chloe had already linked arms with Adrian and was heading toward a black Business Van.

The vehicle had sleek lines and an imposing presence, clearly very expensive.

"Are you daydreaming?"

Adrian's impatient voice urged her on.

She hurriedly dragged all the bags and followed.

There was too much luggage. She stumbled as she walked.

Adrian's brow furrowed slightly.

After storing the luggage, Anna opened the passenger door and got in.

The back seat was reserved for the intimate couple.

"Adrian, I'm so happy we can finally return to New York together!"

Chloe clung to his arm, pressing her whole body against him.

Adrian only gave a faint acknowledgment.

Chloe pouted playfully, unwilling to let it go. "I put on makeup specially today. Do you think this lipstick shade suits me?"

She puckered her lips and leaned closer to him.

Anna caught sight of this in the rearview mirror and quickly averted her eyes.

This small movement was noticed by Adrian.

He gazed deeply at her profile.

"Chloe, sit properly."

Adrian's voice was low and distant.

Chloe pouted in grievance but didn't dare to cause more trouble.

The quiet didn't last long before she complained in a sweet, whiny voice. "Adrian, I'm thirsty."

Adrian tapped the back of the front passenger seat. "Get some water."

Anna glanced at the bottled water right next to his hand.

It was within easy reach, yet he insisted on ordering her.

She silently took the water, unscrewed the cap, and handed it to Chloe.

Chloe's face darkened.

What she wanted was Adrian's attentiveness.

"Just leave it there," she said coldly, turning her head away without another word.

Peace finally returned to the car.

Just as Anna began to relax, a sudden retching sound came from the back seat.

She was startled.
###Chapter 94

Chloe Valentine’s face was pale as she clutched Adrian Sinclair’s sleeve.

Her voice trembled. “Adrian, I feel carsick.”

......

Adrian’s gaze fell on her face.

He spoke calmly. “Do you need to pull over and rest?”

“I think I’m going to be sick.”

She looked extremely unwell.

Adrian signaled the driver to pull over.

Chloe rushed out of the car and crouched by the roadside, dry heaving.

Anna Ross was also feeling nauseous.

Adrian’s voice came from behind her. “Go check on her.”

Anna: “......”

She wasn’t his Executive Assistant.

She felt more like a personal servant for the two of them.

She suppressed the bitterness in her heart.

She grabbed tissues and a bottle of water before getting out of the car.

She crouched down and gently patted Chloe’s back.

Anna told herself inwardly.

Just endure a little longer.

Everything will be better once we reach New York.

......

Marcus Hill felt incredibly bored.

He suddenly thought of Sophia Roscente.

He immediately dialed her number. “Keep me company for a while.”

Sophia responded cheerfully. “Since you’re bored, why not take me out somewhere fun?”

“Alright. Meet me in the lobby.”

He agreed without hesitation.

After a quick tidy-up, he went downstairs to find her.

Just as he was looking around.

A clear voice called out. “Marcus, over here!”

Marcus quickly walked over. “Where do you want to go?”

Sophia’s eyes lit up. “The amusement park!”

Marcus nodded.

It had been a long time since he visited an amusement park too.

They rode roller coasters and pendulum rides.

The thrilling rides made them scream with excitement.

After a whole day of fun.

They walked leisurely along the path.

Sophia hugged a bag of snacks.

She said with a smile. “I had so much fun today. Thank you!”

“I had fun too.” Marcus scratched his head.

Thanks to her.

He had a very enjoyable day.

Sophia blinked. “You’re much more fun than that ice block Adrian.”

“We should keep in touch often after returning to New York.”

Marcus was slightly surprised.

But he nodded in agreement.

He asked. “When are you returning to New York?”

“Not sure.”

Sophia stuck out her tongue. “I sneaked back to the country.”

“I’m definitely in big trouble when I go back.”

“Hahaha...”

Marcus couldn’t help but laugh.

He quickly regained his composure.

He suggested seriously. “Why not be honest with your family?”

“Maybe they will understand you.”

Sophia quickly shook her head.

Thinking of her mother’s stern expression.

She whispered. “Being honest would be the end of me!”

“I didn’t know there was something you were afraid of.” Marcus chuckled lightly.

He thought for a moment. “But I guess we’re in the same boat?”
###Chapter 95

Sophia Roscente stuffed a potato chip into her mouth.

She tilted her head to look at Marcus Hill beside her.

"Kindred spirits?"

She blinked, her face full of curiosity.

"How are we alike?"

Marcus Hill chuckled softly.

His gaze drifted into the distance.

"I ran away too."

He shrugged, a hint of helplessness in his tone.

"My family is forcing me to do something I don't want to do."

"I could only hide in San Francisco for some peace."

Sophia's eyes widened immediately.

"Really?"

She leaned in excitedly.

"I ran away too!"

"What was your reason?"

Marcus made a shushing gesture.

"Arranged marriage."

He lowered his voice.

"My family insists I marry someone I don't love."

"I had to escape."

"Don't you dare rat me out."

Sophia nodded solemnly.

"Don't worry!"

She handed him a bag of snacks.

"My lips are sealed!"

She sighed.

"Arranged marriage sounds terrifying."

"I would be absolutely miserable."

The streetlights stretched their shadows long.

Seeing her mood dip, Marcus quickly changed the subject.

"Hungry?"

He pointed ahead with a smile.

"Let me take you out for a proper meal."

Sophia brightened up instantly.

"Okay!"

Her eyes curved into crescents.

Her smile was as radiant as sunlight.

The restaurant was bathed in warm lighting.

They ordered a table full of dishes.

Sophia ate with great relish.

"This place is amazing!"

She praised between bites.

"We should come here often."

Marcus agreed.

"Anytime."

He waved his phone.

"Just call me when you want to eat."

He was bored alone anyway.

Having a lively little sister around was nice.

Sophia immediately stuck out her pinky.

"Pinky promise!"

Her eyes sparkled.

"No take-backs!"

Marcus found it a bit childish.

But he hooked his finger with hers anyway.

"No take-backs."

He couldn't help but laugh.

After they finished eating, Marcus checked the time.

"Time to head back."

He remembered Adrian Sinclair's warning.

He couldn't keep his cousin out too late.

Sophia nodded obediently.

"Let's go back to the hotel."

She picked up her bag and stood.

....

The night sky over New York was stained crimson by neon lights.

Anna Ross leaned against the car window.

She watched the bustling scene outside.

Skyscrapers stood tall.

Shopping malls were brightly lit.

Pedestrians hurried along.

A soft melody drifted from a tea house.

The entire city was a blend of hustle and romance.

This was New York.

The city of countless dreams.

Chloe Valentine suddenly let out a light laugh.

"Is this your first time in New York, Executive Assistant Ross?"

Her tone carried a hint of mockery.

Adrian Sinclair shot her a cold glance.

Anna silently withdrew her gaze.

The car window slowly rose.

It shut out the noise of the city outside.
###Chapter 96

Chloe Valentine felt a spark of anger at being ignored.

She turned to Adrian Sinclair, her voice softening.
"Adrian, let's have dinner together. I want to have dinner with you."

Anna Ross felt uncomfortable at the mention of dinner.
She just wanted to get away quickly and find Mia Lawrence.

"No, I have things to do. I'll take you back first." Adrian's tone was flat, offering no extra words.
The car came to a smooth stop. The driver spoke up. "Young Master, we're here."

The driver got out to retrieve Chloe's luggage.

Chloe saw it was the residence her parents had arranged.
She was unwilling to accept that Adrian was really just dropping her off.

"You go in first." Adrian looked tired.
Even though she was reluctant, Chloe could only agree obediently.
"Alright. But you must come see me later!"

Adrian didn't look at her, giving a faint "Mmm."
Before leaving, she shot Anna a fierce glare, her eyes full of jealousy.

After Chloe left, Anna breathed a sigh of relief.

Adrian's voice suddenly came from behind her.
"Do you have a place to stay?"

"Yes, I've arranged to stay with Mia." Anna answered immediately.
A key suddenly flew into her hand.
She turned around, confused.

Adrian's expression was blank.
"Go stay at the Bay Area."

The Bay Area?
Anna repeated the name silently. It sounded expensive.
She held the key out to return it.
"No, thank you. I really have a place to stay."

Adrian glanced coldly at the key but didn't take it.
"You're my Executive Assistant now. You came to New York with me. If something happens, it involves me. I don't want trouble."

He didn't give her a chance to argue, pushing the door open and getting out.
He instructed the driver. "Take her there."
"Yes, Young Master."
The driver immediately started the car.

Anna watched his figure standing in the night through the rearview mirror.
She gripped the key tightly, her heart stirring slightly, reminded of the past.

Her phone ringtone interrupted her thoughts. It was a call from Mia Lawrence.
She quickly answered. "Mia, I'm in New York."

"Great! Come find me at Hongkang Huafu directly."
Anna happily agreed and said to the driver, "Sir, please go to Hongkang Huafu."
"Okay."
The car arrived quickly.

Anna got out with her suitcase.
Mia rushed over and hugged her. "Anna! So happy to see you! Come on, let's get something to eat!"
"Okay!" Anna was rarely this happy.
The two walked into the restaurant laughing and talking.
###Chapter 97

The restaurant had few guests remaining.

A server warmly guided them to their seats.

"Please wait a moment, your dishes will arrive shortly."

The server thoughtfully brought a small plate of desserts.

This would help tide them over.

Anna Ross couldn't help but feel impressed.

New York truly was different from other cities.

Even the service was exceptionally thorough and attentive.

Mia Lawrence suddenly moved closer and sat beside her.

She gently poked Anna's arm.

"Anna, nothing happened on the way here, right?"

"Stop overthinking."
"It was just a regular trip."
"What could possibly happen between us?" Anna's cheeks felt slightly warm.
Her best friend's imagination always ran too wild.
She loved fantasizing about things that didn't exist.

Mia studied her with suspicion.
Anna suddenly remembered what happened earlier.
"But he gave me a key."
"It seems he arranged a place for me in the Bay Area, San Francisco."

Adrian Sinclair had been completely silent throughout the journey.
Did he plan all this in advance?
Anna's mind was in turmoil.
She understood Adrian less and less.

"Oh my god, really!?" Mia's eyes widened.
She then propped her chin on one hand, looking at Anna seriously.
"I think Adrian Sinclair definitely still has feelings for you."
"He acts mean on the surface, but secretly cares about you!"

Anna's expression froze.
She shook her head helplessly. "Stop guessing."
"It wasn't just the two of us on this trip."
"His fiancée, Chloe Valentine, came along too."

"What!? Fiancée!?"
Mia abruptly cut her off.
She took a moment to compose herself, drinking water to calm down.
Then she said indignantly, "He has a fiancée and still messes with you!"
"What a jerk!"

She wasn't satisfied.
She spat out in disgust.
"Men like that are the worst."
"Always wanting to have their cake and eat it too."
"He's clearly toying with you."
"You have to stay clear-headed."
"Don't be fooled by his looks and tricks!"

Seeing her furious expression, Anna didn't know whether to laugh or feel touched.
One second she was saying he treated her well.
Her mood swings were astonishingly fast.

Anna gently patted her hand.
"Don't worry."
"There's no possibility between us."
"I'm very clear-headed."

"No!"
"You can't stay by his side any longer."
"Familiarity breeds affection is no joke."
"Especially since you two were once lovers!" Mia tried to pull her away.
Anna quickly stopped her.
"Mia, listen to me."
"We only have a professional relationship now."
"Nothing else will happen."

Mia finally calmed down a little.
She looked at Anna with half belief and half doubt.
"Swear it!"

"Okay, I swear."

Mia finally felt reassured.
Just then, their dishes began arriving at the table.
The two ate quietly.

As they ate, Mia suddenly looked up.
"Anna, where did you say the apartment was again?"
###Chapter 98

Anna Ross froze for a moment.

She thought she had said something wrong.

She replayed Adrian Sinclair's words in her mind.

There was no mistake.

"Bay Area, San Francisco."

"Perfect!" Mia Lawrence's voice was muffled by the food in her mouth. "That's so close to where I live! Really close! I can take you home later!"

Anna felt a little dazed.

What a coincidence.

The apartment he arranged happened to be so near Mia's place?

After dinner.

The two walked side by side on their way home.

They chatted and laughed.

Anna glanced down at the house number on the key.

She inserted it into the lock.

Turned it.

The moment the door opened.

She stood completely stunned.

The room was exquisitely and elegantly decorated.

Every piece of furniture was provided.

She set down her suitcase.

Slowly stepped inside.

The kitchen.

The living room.

The bathroom.

The bedroom.

Every corner was decorated in her favorite style.

He had even prepared a study for her.

Anna walked in.

Her fingertips brushed over the bookshelf.

She pulled out a book.

It was one she had loved reading in the past.

Holding the book.

She seemed to see the Adrian Sinclair from before, who had cared for her so meticulously.

Back then, neither of them had much money.

But they still rented a small place off campus.

They decorated it together with care.

The space was small.

But it was full of warmth.

To pay the rent.

Adrian worked multiple part-time jobs outside of class.

The money he earned always went to little gifts for her.

Every time she came home after class.

The small surprises he prepared would move her to tears.

Then he would gently hold her in his arms.

And softly wipe away her tears.

The scene before her eyes gradually blurred.

Those memories felt so distant, like they happened in a past life.

In this life.

She no longer deserved such pure love and happiness.

Mia excitedly explored every room.

She bounced over to Anna.

"Rich people are something else. This is totally my dream home!"

She flopped heavily onto the bed.

"Anna, I'm sleeping over with you tonight!"

Anna shook off her tangled thoughts.

She smiled slightly.

"Okay. I'll definitely feel uneasy being new here. Having you with me will be much more comforting."

They settled in comfortably.

But Anna tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

The astronomical bill Howard Lowell had shown her.

Lingered in her mind.

A constant unease hung over her heart.

Mia noticed her restlessness.

She asked softly.

"What's wrong? Is something bothering you?"

The city remained bustling as ever.

Late at night, the sound of traffic and lively voices still came from outside the window.

But this room was exceptionally quiet.

Every sound was crystal clear.

Anna turned to face her.

After a moment's hesitation, she spoke.

"Mia, do you know of any jobs that pay well quickly and offer flexible hours?"

Mia was very surprised.

"What happened? Why are you suddenly asking about this?"

Anna had never been so urgent about making money before.

Mia couldn't help but worry.

Anna quickly explained.

"It's nothing. I just want to earn more money. To bring my mom to live with me sooner."
###Chapter 99

Mia Lawrence let out a sigh of relief.

She thought for a moment.

She suggested softly, "You have to work during the day, so you can only find a part-time job for the evenings."

Anna Ross's eyes lit up.

As long as there was a source of income, it would be worth it no matter how tired she got.

"It's fine, I can handle hard work."

The decision to leave San Francisco had filled her with courage.

Now she just wanted to save enough money quickly to take her mother away.

Mia hugged her, her heart aching.

"You earn money only to spend it on others. You work so hard, it hurts me to see it."

As Anna's best friend, she had witnessed the other's most difficult times.

She understood how hard-won this strength was.

But Anna smiled easily.

"It will get better eventually."

There were more opportunities in New York than in San Francisco.

She could work several jobs at the same time.

Being a little more tired didn't matter.

"I'll keep an eye out for part-time job leads for you. I'll let you know as soon as something suitable comes up." Mia rested her head on Anna's shoulder and gradually fell asleep.

Listening to her friend's even breathing, Anna felt warmth in her heart. It felt so good to have someone to confide in and rely on. Having such a friend was how she had managed to endure until now.

She still had work tomorrow, so she didn't dare stay up late. She gently pulled up the covers.

At the same time, in the most bustling area of New York.

A black Maybach stopped in front of a retro-style villa.

Adrian Sinclair stepped out of the car.

The butler hurried to greet him.

"Young Master, the old master has been waiting for you for a long time."

He looked toward the direction of the living room and walked over at a leisurely pace.

On the living room sofa sat a silver-haired old man.

Though advanced in years, he was energetic and had a powerful presence.

Adrian smiled.

"Grandpa."

Hearing his voice, Grandpa Frederick stood up.

He walked over with vigorous strides.

"You're finally here. Have you eaten?"

The two sat down on the sofa.

Adrian was uncharacteristically relaxed.

"I've eaten."

"With Chloe Valentine, right?" Grandpa Frederick smiled kindly. Adrian smiled without answering.

A servant brought fresh tea.

Grandpa Frederick took a sip.

"Chloe is a good girl. She specially came to New York with you." He paused. "Why not take this opportunity to set the engagement?"

"Let's wait a bit longer. I want to get to know her better." The words almost spilled out of Adrian's mouth. Whenever marriage was mentioned, he would always think of Anna's disappointed expression.

He drained his teacup, unwilling to dwell on it.

Seeing his refusal, Grandpa Frederick didn't insist.

"You've always had your own ideas. We'll do it your way."
###Chapter 100

His gaze was profound as he looked over.

"I know you're reluctant in your heart."

"But this marriage arrangement is entirely beneficial for you."

"Grandpa's intentions are for your own good. I hope you understand."

Grandpa Frederick had dominated the business world for decades.

He was deeply familiar with the survival rule of the strong preying on the weak.

For Adrian Sinclair to gain a firm foothold in this cutthroat circle.

An arranged marriage was an indispensable part.

Adrian's knuckles tightened slightly.

"Grandpa, I understand."

He didn't want to worry the old man.

But the things he desired.

He had always seized them through his own efforts.

Amid the curling tea fragrance.

Grandpa Frederick suddenly remembered something.

"How was the inspection of the San Francisco branch?"

A cold light flickered in Adrian's eyes.

He recalled those shocking accounts.

"There are many problems."

"Development has lagged."

"The accounts are unclear."

The last sentence carried implied meaning.

Grandpa Frederick sighed heavily.

That useless son of his.

Had ultimately disappointed him profoundly.

He patted his grandson's hand.

"You've done very well."

"This inspection didn't disappoint me."

Adrian looked at the old man's weary eyes.

His voice softened.

"Grandpa, you don't need to worry about these matters."

"I'm old, and my strength is failing me."

Grandpa Frederick waved his hand.

"Handle this matter strictly by the book."

"Don't worry about sparing my feelings."

Henry hurried forward to support him.

The old man hobbled up the stairs.

Adrian turned and walked into the study.

The lights flickered on abruptly.

He sat before the computer.

The screen's cold glow illuminated his deep-set features.

The sound of keyboard typing.

Was particularly clear in the silent night.

Early the next morning.

The sky was still dark.

A shrill ringtone shattered the tranquility.

Anna Ross turned over.

Wanting to continue sleeping.

But was awakened by the incessant incoming call.

Mia Lawrence mumbled drowsily.

"Anna, sleep a little longer..."

Then sank back into dreamland.

Anna grabbed her phone.

She knew who it was without looking.

Who else would be so urgently demanding this early.

Other than Adrian Sinclair.

A deep, magnetic voice came through.

"Get up. Time for work."

Anna silently screamed in frustration.

Work, work.

Always pushing her to work.

Even workhorses weren't driven this hard.

She resigned herself to getting up.

Tidied herself up at the fastest speed.

And hurried downstairs.
###Chapter 101

Anna hurried downstairs.

A black Mercedes-Benz waited at the entrance.

She pulled the car door open and slid inside.

Adrian Sinclair sat in the back seat.

She instinctively moved toward the front passenger seat.

His hand closed around her wrist.

"Drive."

His voice brooked no argument.

The car began moving slowly.

Only then did he release her.

A box of breakfast was handed to her.

Anna paused slightly.

"For me?"

She asked softly.

Adrian glanced at her.

"Do I look like I bought it for decoration?"

His tone held its usual mockery.

"Don't faint from hunger and delay work again."

She accepted the meal box.

Her fingertips brushed against the warm milk.

"Thank you."

She murmured quietly.

The scent of food filled the car.

He pretended to look out the window.

But his peripheral vision remained on her.

The company tower soared into the clouds.

Its glass facade reflected the morning light.

Far more impressive than the San Francisco branch.

"Mr. Sinclair."

A man in a gray suit approached.

He carried a thick stack of files.

"This is Noah Watson, my assistant."

Adrian gave a brief introduction.

Anna immediately nodded.

"Assistant Watson, pleased to meet you. I'm Executive Assistant Ross."

Noah responded politely.

He then turned to Adrian.

"The foreign cooperation documents are ready."

He pulled out the top folder.

The three walked side by side into the lobby.

Adrian reviewed the files.

Noah continued his report.

"The new quarter's jewelry design proposals also need your approval."

Anna followed silently.

Her high heels clicked against the marble floor.

Producing a crisp, clear sound.
###Chapter 102

Noah Watson briefed Adrian Sinclair on company affairs throughout the ride.

Substantial work had accumulated during Adrian's absence from New York.

Anna Ross listened quietly.

As a newcomer, she couldn't contribute to the conversation.

She simply felt somewhat out of place.

Noah finally concluded his report inside the elevator.

He reminded Adrian about a meeting in three minutes.

Adrian glanced at his wristwatch.

His eyes swept over Anna.

He instructed Noah to show the new hire around.

Noah immediately agreed.

He handed the documents to his boss.

The elevator doors opened.

Adrian strode out with his long legs.

The two of them remained behind.

Noah turned to Anna.

He politely asked her to follow him.

Anna quickly nodded.

The third-floor Creative Department buzzed with activity.

Noah explained the department's functions in detail.

Anna listened attentively.

She had worked in the Creative Department back in San Francisco.

But she kept that to herself.

They continued touring the company.

The vast space took considerable time to cover.

Noah smiled and said she'd become familiar with it gradually.

Anna responded with a faint smile.

She checked her phone while waiting for the elevator.

Noah alerted her that the elevator had arrived.

The doors opened, revealing two people stepping out.

Noah immediately bowed and greeted the Chairman.

Anna looked up.

Chloe Valentine was chatting cheerfully with the elderly man, holding his arm.

Chloe paused briefly upon seeing her.

Then she smiled and greeted her.

Frederick Lowell's gaze swept over Anna with scrutiny.

Chloe quickly introduced her as Adrian's Executive Assistant.

Her tone carried a hint of pride.

Anna finally understood the old man's identity.

Frederick merely gave her a passing glance.

He affectionately led Chloe away to continue the tour.

Anna stepped into the elevator.

She only hoped for peaceful days ahead.

Chloe glanced back once.

She spoke softly to the old man with a light laugh.

She mentioned how Anna had been inseparable from Adrian in San Francisco.
###Chapter 103

"Is that so?" The old man's gaze darkened slightly, but he didn't press further. He simply lifted his teacup and took a small sip. "Chloe, no matter how important work is, it can't compare to life itself."

A flicker of disappointment passed through Chloe Valentine's eyes, but she was quickly pleased by his words. She nodded obediently. "You're right, Grandpa."

She clenched her fingers tightly.
Anna Ross, no matter how much you try to get his attention, I'm the only one who will marry him in the end.
Only I deserve to stand by his side!

The old man lowered his eyes to drink his tea, a thoughtful glint flashing deep within them.
That girl... I feel like I've seen her somewhere before.

Elsewhere, Noah Watson finally finished showing Anna Ross around the company's layout.
They both stood at the end of the corridor and sighed in relief simultaneously.
Anna gently patted her chest and smiled lightly. "The company is so big. I would definitely get lost without a guide."
Noah shrugged helplessly. "Tell me about it! Last time I was rushing to a meeting, I got lost in the R&D department for ten whole minutes."
The tips of his ears turned red, clearly still embarrassed by this past mishap.

Anna found it amusing but kindly didn't point it out.
The elevator went straight to the top floor.
The gilded plaque of the CEO's office came into view. Anna paused. "My workstation... is here?"
Noah quickly explained. "Mr. Sinclair hasn't arranged a specific location for you yet. Please wait here temporarily."

He pushed the door open. A cold, grey and pure black interior design style greeted them.
A leather executive chair, a mahogany desk, dual computer screens emitting a cold glow.
An entire wall was filled with a bookshelf packed with hardcover classics. A black leather sofa sat beside the floor-to-ceiling window.
The only splash of life in this oppressive space was a giant monstera plant.

"Please have a seat, Miss Ross. I'll go fetch the documents." Noah hurried away.
Anna rubbed her sore calves and sank into the sofa.
This office was exactly like Adrian Sinclair himself—
Meticulous, icy, and impermeable.

Sudden laughter and conversation sounded outside the door.
The moment the door opened, three pairs of eyes met.
Old Mr. Lowell stood at the doorway leaning on his cane. Chloe Valentine held his arm, her smile freezing on her face.

Anna's heart sank.
Just what she was afraid of was happening.
She immediately stood up and bowed her head slightly. "Chairman, Miss Valentine. I'll excuse myself so you can talk."

Chloe watched her hurried retreat, a secret smile curling her lips.
Just as Anna's fingertips touched the door handle, an aged yet authoritative voice rang out from behind—
"Stop right there."

Anna's back stiffened.
Chloe's smile solidified on her face.
###Chapter 104

Grandpa Lowell approached slowly.

Chloe Valentine immediately reached out to support him.
Her movements were gentle, as if handling a priceless treasure.

"What is your name?"
The old man's gaze was sharp, scrutinizing her from head to toe.

Anna Ross felt her heart tighten.
She took a quiet breath and answered respectfully, "Chairman, my name is Anna Ross."
Her fingertips dug secretly into her palms, beading with fine, cold sweat.
She hoped the conversation would end right there.
She absolutely could not let him detect her past with Adrian Sinclair.

A sharp glint flashed through Chloe's eyes.
But it instantly transformed into a soft, charming smile as she stood obediently to the side.

Grandpa Lowell remained silent for a moment before waving his hand.
"You may go attend to your duties."
He turned and walked toward his office.

Anna felt as if she had received a pardon.
She quickly walked away.
The hallway was vast and quiet.
She familiarized herself with the surroundings alone, marveling at the company's grand scale.

Faint voices drifted over.
Following the sound, she accidentally wandered into the conference room area.
Through a crack in the door, she could see a meeting in progress.

Adrian Sinclair sat at the head of the table, his expression focused.
He flipped through documents, his profile sharp and severe.
Anna was momentarily stunned.
She had never seen him like this before.

She watched, captivated.
Completely unaware of the astonished gazes from everyone in the meeting room.

Adrian tapped his fingers lightly on the table.
He suddenly pushed the documents aside.
"Meeting adjourned."
He stood up and walked straight toward the door.

Anna turned around in a fluster.
But he quickly blocked her path.

"What are you doing here?"
His voice was low, laced with scrutiny.

She clenched the hem of her clothes, her heart pounding like a drum.
She couldn't possibly say she had fled here to avoid his grandfather.

A flicker of emotion passed through Adrian's eyes.
Could she have come specifically to find him?

But his expression quickly turned cold.
"If you don't know your way around, don't wander recklessly."
His tone was detached and distant.

Anna bit her lip.
"Miss Valentine and your grandfather are waiting for you in the office."
She kept her eyes fixed on the ground, refusing to look at him.
###Chapter 105

Adrian Sinclair halted his steps.

He hadn't expected this to be the reason she ran out.

An inexplicable anger surged within him.

His tone grew colder. "You came out just for this?"

He was genuinely annoyed.

Grandpa suddenly bringing someone to the company.

This complicated things.

Anna Ross lowered her gaze, speaking softly. "My presence is inappropriate."

She was merely an outsider.

She shouldn't interrupt their reunion.

Adrian's expression darkened further.

He despised her distant demeanor.

He wished to draw a clear line immediately.

Was she so eager to push him toward someone else?

"We'll discuss this inside."

He turned and walked toward the office.

Anna followed silently.

Employees along the way greeted Adrian.

But their eyes lingered on her a few seconds too long.

Anna felt a tightness in her chest.

Through the office glass window.

Chloe Valentine was chatting and laughing intimately with Grandpa Lowell.

The scene was warm and harmonious.

Anna hesitated. "You go in. I'll wait outside."

Adrian gave her a brief glance.

He entered alone.

Chloe's eyes lit up.

She called out sweetly, "Adrian!"

She quickly approached and linked her arm with his.

Like a couple deeply in love.

Grandpa Lowell smiled and nodded.

Quite pleased with their intimate posture.

Adrian tried to withdraw his arm.

But Chloe held on tighter.

Pressing herself against him.

He frowned slightly but ultimately didn't push her away.

"Grandpa, what brings you here so suddenly?"

"Adrian, Grandpa specially brought me to familiarize myself with the company." Chloe answered eagerly, pulling him to sit beside the old man. "I missed you so much."

Grandpa laughed. "Chloe wants to work at the company. Arrange a position for her."

Preferably one where she can be with you every day.

Chloe looked at him expectantly.

Eager to replace that Executive Assistant immediately.

Adrian's expression tightened. "There are many positions available. She can choose any."

"I want you to arrange it personally." Grandpa stated firmly. "The Executive Assistant role is most suitable. Let her learn by your side."

Chloe's heart raced.

If he agreed.

That Anna Ross would have to leave immediately.

Adrian's lips pressed into a thin line. "I already have an Executive Assistant."

"She can choose any other position."

Except this one.

Disappointment flashed in Chloe's eyes.

But she pretended to be understanding. "Grandpa, it's really alright."

The more obedient she acted.

The more it pained the old man.

"You mean that Anna Ross?" Grandpa's face darkened. "I met her today. Incompetent. Fire her immediately."
###Chapter 106

Adrian Sinclair tightened his fingers.

His tie loosened.

His voice was low. "Grandpa, I can't obey you on this matter."

Grandpa was stunned.

He set his teacdown heavily.

He stared at his grandson. "Is this the first time you've defied me, for that girl?"

Adrian remained silent.

His gaze swept over Chloe Valentine.

She was fiddling with her skirt, head bowed.

Grandpa slammed the table. "She must be fired today!"

Adrian picked up his water glass.

The temperature was just right.

He took a sip.

"Grandpa, you've met her?"

Grandpa snorted coldly. "I have. I don't like her."

Chloe moved closer to Grandpa.

Adrian's eyes turned cold.

He set down his glass.

"She's Uncle's stepdaughter."

Grandpa paused.

"Stepdaughter?"

Adrian nodded. "Uncle personally asked me to look after her."

Grandpa fell silent for a moment.

His fingers rubbed his cane.

Chloe bit her lip.

She spoke softly. "Grandpa, it's alright for me."

She looked at Adrian. "As long as I can stay in the company, any position is fine."

Grandpa immediately frowned. "No, she must be transferred!"

Adrian rubbed his temples.

"Fine."

He agreed readily.

A flash of joy appeared in Chloe's eyes.

She gently tugged Grandpa's sleeve. "Thank you, Grandpa."

Grandpa patted her hand. "Silly child, you've been wronged."

Adrian suddenly spoke. "The Creative Department is short-staffed."

Chloe's smile froze.

"You'd be perfect there."

His tone was calm.

Chloe's face turned pale.

The Creative Department was downstairs.

It was three whole floors away from the CEO's office.

She shook her head hurriedly. "I don't want to go to the Creative Department!"

Grandpa immediately agreed. "That's right, she can't go!"

Adrian stood up.

"It's settled."
###Chapter 107

Grandpa glared at Adrian Sinclair, coughing in anger.

"I told you to place Chloe by your side, and you sent her to the Creative Department!?"

Chloe's face stiffened.

She forced a smile and gently patted Grandpa's back.

"Grandpa, Adrian made a good arrangement."

She struggled to maintain a sweet, obedient smile.

Frederick saw right through her act.

He shot Adrian a reproachful look.

Chloe explained softly.

"Adrian said she's his cousin."

"They've worked together for so long. They must have good synergy."

"I can't just take someone else's job."

Adrian gave her a cool glance.

She certainly knew how to spin things.

Grandpa held Chloe's hand warmly.

"You're too understanding."

"You should be the one by Adrian's side."

Chloe cursed inwardly.

She couldn't rush this.

She smiled sweetly.

"I'll love any job Adrian gives me."

"Please don't give him a hard time, Grandpa."

Grandpa sighed.

If only his grandson were this obedient.

He looked at Adrian.

"Take good care of Chloe. Understood?"

Adrian smiled in agreement.

"I will."

Noah Watson returned just then.

Grandpa stopped him.

"Appoint Chloe as Director of the Creative Department."

Noah looked at Chloe in surprise.

Director right after joining?

He nodded respectfully.

"Yes, Chairman."

Chloe was displeased.

This wasn't the position she wanted.

Grandpa rose slowly.

"I'm getting old. Time to head back."

Adrian and Chloe supported him on either side.

Grandpa was very satisfied.

At the door, he turned back with instructions.

"Bring Chloe for Family Dinner tonight."

Adrian paused.

"Understood."

Chloe agreed happily.

"We'll be there on time!"

Grandpa left satisfied.

Adrian moved to escort him but was stopped.

"Henry is waiting for me downstairs."

Only the two of them remained in the office.

Adrian lounged lazily in his executive chair.

He looked down, absently stroking his platinum signet ring.

Chloe's inner voice screamed.

This man would be hers.
###Chapter 108

Adrian Sinclair's voice cut through the air, cold and sharp.

"You were there when Grandpa ran into Anna Ross today?"

Chloe Valentine's heart tightened.

She recalled the old man's words from earlier.

She quickly softened her tone to explain.

"Yes."

"We had just arrived at the company."

"We met at the elevator bank."

"We just exchanged a simple greeting."

Adrian lifted his gaze.

His sharp eyes locked onto her.

"Is that so."

"Did you introduce her to Grandpa?"

Chloe's heart sank.

Grandpa had made it clear he didn't like Anna.

Adrian must suspect she said something.

His presence was overwhelming.

She found it hard to even breathe.

But then she remembered.

She was his fiancée.

The sweet words might smooth things over.

"Adrian."

"It really was a coincidence."

"If you don't believe me, you can ask Noah."

A cold smirk flickered in Adrian's eyes.

He had asked if she had spoken out of turn in front of Grandpa.

Yet she kept avoiding the point.

Only emphasizing the chance meeting.

He saw right through her little game.

Watching her nervousness, Adrian suddenly curved his lips.

"No need to be so tense."

"I was just asking casually."

His demeanor was too relaxed.

Chloe felt a sense of controlled fear.

But as long as he didn't expose her, there was still room to maneuver.

She forced a sweet smile.

"I just like you too much."

"That's why I get nervous around you."

"They say it's a sign a girl is really smitten."

She walked to his desk.

Deliberately leaning forward.

Her V-neck dress was already low-cut.

The movement left little to the imagination.

Her voice grew even more delicate.

"Adrian."

"Don't you think I'm right?"

Adrian indifferently looked away.

His tone flat.

"She and I only have a professional relationship."

"Nothing more."

"I hope you can understand."

He stood and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

Turning his back to her.

He had dismissed the topic so lightly.

Chloe felt stifled.

But she could only play the understanding role.

"I know."

Understand?

His emphasis was clearly meant to protect Anna.

She wasn't a fool.

How could she not see it.

Adrian messaged for Anna Ross.

He gave instructions right in front of Chloe.

"Your new workstation."

"Will be right outside my office."

Anna sensed the subtly atmosphere.

But she didn't dare ask questions.

She immediately agreed.

"Understood, Mr. Sinclair."

She just wanted to obey quietly.

To avoid angering him.

Hearing this arrangement, Chloe's blood boiled.

He was placing her right outside his office.

So close to him.

While she was sent to the distant Creative Department.

Why?

She glared at Anna with resentment.

But as long as Anna remained in the company.

She would have plenty of chances to reclaim that position.

She walked up to Anna.

Extending her hand with a sweet smile.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

"From now on, we must work hard together."

"And share Adrian's burdens properly."
###Chapter 109

Anna Ross stared at the well-manicured hand.

Though she couldn't hear the conversation inside the office.

Chloe Valentine's oppressive aura was unmistakable.

Anna maintained a polite smile.

She returned the handshake lightly.

"I'll focus on my responsibilities."

Adrian Sinclair leaned against the floor-to-ceiling window.

His brow twitched almost imperceptibly.

His gaze drifted over her.

Chloe caught his glance.

Her perfectly made-up face tightened briefly.

She quickly resumed her gracious smile.

"Grandpa insisted on arranging my position personally."

"We'll be colleagues now."

She emphasized "Grandpa" pointedly.

Each syllable dripped with territorial claim.

Anna lowered her eyes.

These implications meant nothing to her.

Adrian abruptly interrupted.

"Time to get to work."

Chloe immediately latched onto his arm.

"Adrian."

"I don't know where the Creative Department is."

"Could you walk me there?"

She pressed herself against him.

Adrian frowned.

Out of respect for his grandfather, he didn't push her away.

He nodded agreement.

His eyes shifted past Chloe to Anna.

Anna quickly looked away.

Noah Watson entered at that moment.

Anna hurried over to discuss work details.

Noah glanced confusedly at the tense trio.

Adrian led Chloe away.

As they passed, Chloe shot Anna a triumphant look.

Noah handed over a stack of files.

"These are the prep materials for your tasks."

"Please review them first."

Anna was surprised.

"Thank you."

Noah gave brief instructions before leaving hastily.

Anna returned to her workstation.

It faced Adrian's office directly.

She could see people moving in the hallway.

But it didn't distract from reading documents.

She didn't even notice when Adrian returned.

He paused briefly at his door.

Then entered his office.

......

Quitting time arrived.

Colleagues left chatting and laughing.

Anna sighed at her computer screen.

She mentally chastised Adrian.

Her phone rang suddenly.

"Mia?"

"Anna, are you off work yet?"

Anna couldn't help complaining.

"I should be."

"But that taskmaster Adrian—"

The office door swung open.

Adrian stood there with a dark expression.

Anna's breath caught.

When had he returned?

Had he heard everything?

She wished she could vanish instantly.
###Chapter 110

Anna Ross quickly straightened her posture.

It was already after work hours.

Why couldn't she leave?

She cleared her throat and asked softly, "Um... when can I clock out?"

Adrian Sinclair noticed every little movement she made.

Weren't you quite bold when complaining about me earlier?

Now you're scared?

"You can leave now," he said indifferently.

He then turned and entered his office.

He didn't spare her another glance.

Anna stood frozen in place.

He was being unusually agreeable today?

She quickly remembered.

He was taking Chloe Valentine to see Grandpa later.

She, an outsider, naturally had no reason to tag along.

A strange pang of pain shot through her heart.

But being able to leave work was always good.

She quickly packed her things and left the company.

She took a taxi to where Mia Lawrence worked.

Mia had continued working in real estate sales after moving to New York.

She heard the pay was better here than in San Francisco.

Plus, she was about to get a promotion soon.

Anna stood outside the real estate office and made a call.

"Mia, I'm downstairs at your company."

"Are you off work yet?"

Mia ran out excitedly.

Anna smiled. "I'm in a good mood today."

"How about I treat you to dinner?"

"Great!" Mia linked arms with her.

"I'm starving!"

After they finished eating.

Mia suddenly remembered something.

"Anna, about that job you asked me to keep an eye out for."

"I found a few pretty good ones."

"Want to go check them out now?"

Anna nodded immediately.

"Let's go now."

She hadn't expected her friend to be so efficient.

They arrived at a bar called Moonlight Lounge.

Anna hesitated slightly.

But for the sake of earning money, she went in.

The music inside the bar was deafening.

The owner happened to be at the front desk.

His eyes lit up when he saw two pretty girls.

"Here to have fun or looking for work?"

Anna mustered her courage and spoke up.

"I'm here for a part-time job."

Mia added.

"We contacted earlier about the drink promotion position."

The owner instantly got excited.

"Of course!"

He clapped his hands.

Someone brought over a bunny girl costume.

Anna and Mia's eyes widened.

They grabbed each other's hands and ran out.

They only stopped after running quite a distance.

Catching her breath, Anna shook her head.

"I really can't do this one."

Mia was also still shaken.

"Let's look at some others."

They checked out a few more places.

None of them satisfied Anna.

"This is the last one."

Mia pointed at the bar in front of them.

"They need a resident singer here."

"You won awards for singing in college."

Anna smiled bitterly.

She did love singing.

She once dreamed of becoming a singer.

But because of her mother, she couldn't continue her studies.
###Chapter 111

"Let's go inside and check."

If this bar didn't work out, she would have to give up on finding a part-time job.

Dreamland Bar was far better than the previous places they had visited.

The owner was a woman in her thirties, sharp and efficient.

She warmly greeted them as they entered. "Welcome."

She looked at the two girls with slight surprise. "Are you here for the job?"

Mia Lawrence spoke first. "We spoke on the phone. My friend wants to apply for the performer position."

The owner understood and turned to Anna Ross. "Sing a few lines for me."

Anna chose a familiar song and softly sang a verse.

The owner's eyes lit up with admiration. She couldn't help but applaud. "Excellent!"

"Eight to eleven PM. Seven hundred dollars per day. Can you accept that?"

Anna and Mia exchanged glances, nodding in pleasant surprise.

"I can do it."

The owner said cheerfully, "You can start tomorrow or the day after. Just contact me then."

They exchanged contact information before leaving.

Mia went home first due to her period. Anna returned to her room alone.

She collapsed onto the bed. Images of Adrian Sinclair and Chloe Valentine dining together suddenly flooded her mind.

Their marriage seemed inevitable. They would probably wed soon.

She sat up abruptly.

The memory of Grandpa Lowell's affectionate demeanor toward Chloe that morning remained vivid.

Would Adrian come to love her that way too?

"Anna Ross, these thoughts are not for you."

She shook her head, grabbed her clothes, and walked into the bathroom.

Hot water cascaded down, gradually soothing her restless heart.

She was drying her hair, ready for bed, when her phone rang.

It was her mother, Vivian Lowell.

Anna realized she had forgotten to check in.

Her mother's concerned voice came through immediately. "Anna, are you doing alright over there?"

"Mom, I'm fine. Don't worry." Her nose tingled with emotion.

Vivian sighed in relief. "No news for so many days. I'm just glad you're safe."

Anna's voice choked up. "I'll work hard to earn money. I'll take you away from here someday."

Vivian responded gently. "I know. Get some rest now. You have work tomorrow."
###Chapter 112

"Alright, take good care of yourself at home."

Vivian Lowell's voice was gentle. "Mom is fine here at home. You're out there all alone. Tell me if anything happens."

Anna Ross felt her nose sting slightly.

She couldn't help but wish her mother could always be by her side, no matter where she went. How wonderful that would be.

But this wish would come true someday.

She suppressed her emotions and replied softly, "I will, Mom."

She waited quietly for the other end to hang up first.

Anna tossed her phone aside and lay down on the bed, ready to sleep.

The most important thing right now was to work hard and earn money.

Everything else, she shouldn't think about anymore.

Some things simply couldn't be changed just because she wanted them to.

Ding dong—

A message suddenly popped up on her phone.

[Adrian: Come pick me up.]

It was followed immediately by a location pin.

Anna stared at the screen, her chest tight with anger.

Did he get uncomfortable if he didn't torment her for a single day?

She really wanted to pretend she hadn't seen it.

Wait—wasn't he having dinner with Chloe Valentine? Why was he asking her to pick him up?

Had something happened?

After hesitating for a few seconds, she still got up, changed clothes, and called a car on her phone.

She quickly arrived at the restaurant Adrian had sent.

It had a classic design, elegant and tasteful, even more upscale than the last one.

Anna got out of the car and asked the driver to wait.

She was about to make a call when she spotted Adrian sitting on a bench near the entrance.

She hurried over.

Before she even got close, she caught a faint scent of alcohol.

"Why are you here alone?" she couldn't help asking.

Where were Grandpa Frederick and Chloe Valentine? How could they leave him here by himself?

Adrian looked up at her.

He stood, his tone carrying a hint of dissatisfaction. "You're too slow. Not afraid I'd freeze to death on the roadside?"

With that, he directly walked past her, pulled open the car door, and got into the taxi.

Anna stood frozen in place, gritting her teeth in anger.

It was already good enough that she came to pick him up, and he still complained?

She took a deep breath, telling herself not to get angry, and followed him into the car.

Adrian leaned back against the seat, eyes closed, looking exhausted.

Anna suddenly felt a strange pang of emotion.

He was the one who went to dinner with his fiancée, yet in the end, she was the one picking him up in the middle of the night.

She couldn't help muttering under her breath, "Has a driver but doesn't use him. Insists on making someone without a car come pick him up. Can bosses just be this willful?"

Her voice was very soft, but Adrian still heard it.

He lifted his eyelids slightly, giving her a glance, and explained flatly, "The driver went to take Chloe home."

Anna was startled.

She hadn't expected him to hear, and instantly felt flustered.

But what confused her more was, why didn't he take her home himself?

Sensing Adrian's gaze still resting on her, she quickly changed the subject. "It's getting late. I'll take you back first."

Only after saying it did she remember she had no idea where he lived.

She turned to look at him and asked hesitantly, "By the way, where do you live?"
###Chapter 113

Silence fell inside the car.

The driver secretly observed the two through the rearview mirror.

Adrian Sinclair suddenly spoke. "I want to see where you live." His deep eyes locked onto her, as if trying to pull her in.

Anna Ross's breath hitched.

Although his behavior had been proper since arriving in New York, nothing like before.

His unpredictable nature still made her fearful.

She reminded him softly. "Mr. Sinclair, it's very late."

"If you don't return soon, Grandpa will worry."

She didn't believe he would insist after bringing up his grandfather.

"He wouldn't worry about such a small matter." His breath brushed past her, carrying a faint scent of alcohol.

Anna glanced at him helplessly.

Sensing her tension, Adrian chuckled lowly.

His voice was deep and mesmerizing. "What's wrong?"

"Can't I even see the apartment I rented?"

Anna wanted to refute, but his words left her speechless.

She regretted it deeply. She never should have accepted the apartment he found.

Seeing her no longer refusing, Adrian instructed the driver. "To the Bay Area."

The driver breathed a sigh of relief and immediately started the car.

He had waited here too long, almost got desensitized.

Was it easy getting a fare in the middle of the night!

The residence wasn't far, and they arrived quickly.

Anna thanked the driver and got out.

Adrian surveyed the surrounding environment.

The security was good, which satisfied him.

This place was very suitable for her to live.

Anna watched him inspecting the area like it was work and couldn't help but purse her lips.

She stepped forward and opened the door. Before she could speak, Adrian had already slipped inside.

Anna: "......"

Even if he found the apartment, couldn't he be a little less casual?

At least he should ask her, the resident, for her opinion.

Forget it. He was always this authoritarian.

Closing the door, she followed him in.

Adrian scanned the interior, then sat down on the sofa.

He raised a hand to rub his temples.

Anna was a little curious.

He seemed to be in a bad mood tonight.

"Get me a glass of water." A muffled voice came from the sofa.

Although reluctant, Anna complied.

After he finished the water, Anna thought about hurrying him back.

She pretended to glance at the time in surprise. "It's so late. You should go back, Mr. Sinclair."

Adrian looked at her, not saying a word.

He remembered his grandfather brought him and Chloe Valentine together during dinner, and restless rose in his heart.

Anna felt a chill down her spine under his gaze and instinctively stepped back.

She never should have brought him back.

"Do you still like me?"
###Chapter 114

His words struck like lightning.

Anna Ross froze completely.

Why was he suddenly asking this?

Was he truly drunk?

She didn't want to answer.

But his gaze locked onto her, leaving no escape.

Anna lowered her eyes, her voice cold. "You already have a fiancée. Don't you find this question ridiculous?"

"Answer me." His voice was low, filled with pressure.

Seeing the unwillingness in his eyes, her heart ached sharply.

What right did she have to talk about likes or dislikes now?

"I stopped liking you a long time ago." She turned to flee.

The world spun.

She fell into a scorching embrace.

Adrian Sinclair's kiss descended.

It was an invasion laced with the scent of alcohol.

He bit her lip until it broke.

The taste of blood spread between their teeth.

A woman who only loved money.

How could she have any feelings for him?

Yet her taste was so intoxicating.

He was addicted from the first touch.

Anna's head felt heavy and muddled.

She didn't push him away.

Their body temperatures rose.

Breaths intertwined.

His hand slipped beneath her clothes.

Anna jolted back to awareness.

"No!" She grabbed his wrist.

The corners of her eyes reddened, making her look pitiful and vulnerable.

Adrian's eyes darkened further.

He gripped her wrist and kissed her again.

The kiss was urgent.

His hands roamed over her body.

Anna trembled, struggling.

It was useless.

Worse, her body was actually responding.

She cursed herself silently for being shameless.

He released her lips and carried her toward the bedroom.

Tears welled in Anna's eyes. "Adrian, you can't do this!"

She was like a lamb awaiting slaughter, powerless to resist.

He ignored her pleas.

His warm kisses trailed from her lips downward.

"Annie..." His voice was hoarse.

Anna froze.

He used to call her that.

His gaze softened, reminiscent of their university days.

She clawed his back fiercely. "Bastard!"

Surprise flickered in Adrian's eyes.

His movements became gentle.

...

The next day.

The alarm clock rang.

Anna opened her eyes wearily.

Memories of last night flooded her mind.

His scent still lingered in the room.

A faint sense of relief washed over her.

She had once promised her first time to him.

Now that promise was fulfilled.
###Chapter 115

Anna Ross turned her face away.

The man beside her was still asleep.

Morning light filtered through the curtains, falling on his sharply defined features.

It cast a soft, hazy glow.

Memories of last night crashed into her mind.

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

Clothes were scattered across the floor.

She bent down to pick them up.

She dressed herself, piece by piece.

She tried to move.

A sharp pain instantly shot through her entire body.

It felt like she had been run over.

Every bone screamed in protest.

Anna gripped the edge of the bed.

She gritted her teeth and steadied herself.

She shuffled slowly toward the bathroom.

In her mind, she had already cursed Adrian Sinclair a thousand times.

The mirror reflected a patchwork of marks.

They trailed from her collarbone down to her waist.

Her cheeks burned.

She turned on the faucet.

Cold water washed over her, trying to clear her chaotic thoughts.

Adrian Sinclair opened his eyes.

He lay still, gazing at the ceiling.

His eyes were deep and thoughtful.

A buzz broke the silence.

He got up and retrieved his suit jacket.

He pulled out his phone and answered.

His brow furrowed instantly.

"Understood."

"I'll be right there."

He ended the call.

He dressed quickly and efficiently.

He left in haste.

Anna stepped out of the bathroom.

The bedroom was empty.

She breathed a sigh of relief.

Yet, an inexplicable sense of loss lingered.

"Just focus on work for now," she whispered to herself.

The office was as busy as ever.

The elevator ascended slowly.

Her heart grew tighter with each floor.

Ding.

The doors opened.

Noah Watson walked toward her.

"Good morning, Executive Assistant Ross."

Anna forced a smile.

"Morning."

Her eyes unconsciously drifted toward the CEO's office.

Noah noticed her glance.

"Looking for Mr. Sinclair?"

"He's out today."

"He won't be coming to the office."

Anna shook her head.

"It's nothing."

She hurried back to her workstation.

All day.

That door remained firmly shut.

When it was time to leave, she packed her things and left.

She could just make it to the bar on time.

The owner greeted her warmly.

"Anna, you're here!"

"We have a full house tonight."

"Everyone's waiting for you to take the stage."
###Chapter 116

Anna Ross gave a slight nod and followed the manager into the noisy interior of the bar.

Dazzling lights swirled. The dance floor was packed with a surging crowd, cheers rising and falling.

The moment she stepped onto the stage, all eyes from below focused on her.

Someone whistled. Others raised their phones to record.

The song request list was quickly handed to her.

As the intro music flowed softly, the entire room gradually quieted down.

She parted her lips lightly and began to sing. "How many times does a butterfly blink its eyes..."

Her voice was clear and moving. The audience below instantly erupted into enthusiastic applause.

Mia Lawrence pushed her way to the front with effort, excitedly waving her arms.

She watched her radiant best friend on stage, a proud smile lifting her lips.

On the bar's second floor, the owner observed the bustling scene with satisfaction.

Tonight's customer flow was noticeably higher than usual. She nodded to herself in approval.

During the intermission, Anna checked the time.

The owner happened to walk over, beaming. "You performed wonderfully. I'm giving you a raise."

Anna thanked her with surprise and simultaneously requested to leave early.

The owner agreed readily.

The night was still young. The streets remained lively.

Mia linked arms with her, hopping excitedly. "A raise! That's amazing!"

Anna's eyes curved into happy crescents. She pulled her toward a roadside food truck.

The enticing aroma hit them. Both swallowed involuntarily.

Mia's eyes lit up as she excitedly picked ingredients. "I've been craving this! Today, I'm eating like there's no tomorrow!"

Anna held a plate, cooperating with her while smiling warmly. "Don't worry. There's plenty."

Just as they were happily selecting food, a male voice suddenly interrupted. "Isn't this Mr. Sinclair's executive assistant?"

They turned simultaneously. Anna was slightly taken aback.

Marcus Hill approached with a smile, his tone teasing. "I didn't expect him to actually bring you along." He glanced at the plate in her hand, raising an eyebrow. "You actually like this kind of food? Mind if I join?"

Mia immediately blocked the ingredients protectively. "Why should we let you join? Who are you?"

Just as Marcus was about to answer, a petite figure bounced out from behind him.

Sophia Roscente waved with a bright smile. "Miss Ross, do you remember me?"

Anna was somewhat surprised. She hadn't expected to run into them in New York.

Seeing her silence, Sophia主动 explained. "I'm Adrian Sinclair's cousin. You can ask him if you don't believe me."

Marcus nodded repeatedly in confirmation.

Anna smiled politely, but a trace of awkwardness stirred within her.

Marcus looked around deliberately and asked, "Where's Adrian? Working overtime again? He's such a workaholic."

Anna responded flatly, "I'm not sure. I didn't see him today."

Sophia immediately leaned in, her eyes sparkling. "How far have things progressed between you and my cousin?"

Anna's heart tightened. She quickly denied it. "I'm just his executive assistant. There's no other relationship."
###Chapter 117

"I don't believe that." Marcus Hill raised an eyebrow with a light laugh, his tone full of playful mockery. "Last time we met, you slapped me twice without any hesitation—such a feisty temper. Who else would dare to provoke you besides him?" He tilted his head, wearing an expression of someone enjoying the drama, a provoking smirk curling his lips.

Anna Ross couldn't be bothered to engage with him.
She had already apologized, yet he insisted on bringing it up repeatedly.
It wasn't intentional.
She didn't feel like explaining.

She just couldn't help wondering—where exactly had Adrian Sinclair gone? Even Marcus didn't know?
But it was better that he wasn't around.
She could clock out on time, without being ordered around by him.
Why bother thinking about him during such free days.

Anna shook her head, pushing all thoughts of him away.

It was then that Mia Lawrence finally processed the situation, pulling her aside and lowering her voice. "Is he the one from the airport... the one you slapped?"
Anna gave a slight nod.
Mia hesitated for a few seconds before whispering, "Then I take back what I said earlier... about that incident. We really were in the wrong."

Anna couldn't help but laugh.
She was the one who did the hitting, and she was the one who apologized, yet Mia was the one getting anxious first.

"Fine." She linked arms with her best friend. "Let's just let them join us."
Mia coughed lightly, turning to the two men. "Since you know Anna—you can join us for dinner, but keep the chatter to a minimum."

Marcus grinned brightly.
He had just arrived in New York, and dinner was already settled!

The four of them sat down to eat, the atmosphere relaxed.
After a simple celebration, Anna and Mia got up to leave.
But Marcus stopped them. "Leaving already?"

"Going home." Anna checked the time. "Work tomorrow."

Sophia Roscente's eyes suddenly lit up. She rushed over and clung to Anna's arm, her voice soft and pleading. "Sis... can I go home with you?"

Anna was taken aback, glancing at Marcus.
Didn't he bring her here?
Marcus shrugged with a smile. "It's not appropriate for a grown man like me to take her back, could lead to misunderstandings—just do a good deed and let her stay with you for one night?"

He didn't dare take this young lady home.
If his family saw, he'd never be able to clear his name.

Anna looked hesitantly at Sophia.
She didn't want to bring her back.
If Adrian found out, he might use it as an excuse to cause trouble.

She was about to refuse—
But Sophia seemed to see right through her. Her eyes reddened, her lips trembling, on the verge of tears.

"Sis... if you don't take me in, I'll have to sleep on the streets tonight."
Anna and Mia exchanged a look, both at a loss.

Seeing this, Sophia pressed her advantage.
She batted her big, round eyes, softening her voice into a coaxing whine. "I promise I'll be good! I'll do whatever you say!"

Anna looked at her pitiful, obedient expression and her heart softened.
It was so late; she couldn't really let a young girl end up homeless.

###Chapter 118

Anna Ross looked at Sophia Roscente's expectant face and finally softened.

Fine, what harm could there be in letting her stay for one night?

By blood, they were cousins.

It made sense to look out for each other.

"Then come back with us," she said softly.

Sophia immediately jumped up with a cheer.

Before leaving, she happily waved goodbye to Marcus Hill.

"See you!"

Marcus stood watching as the three of them walked away.

His shadow stretched long under the streetlight.

He stood there for a moment before turning to leave.

Now he had to go back and face his family.

The thought alone made him irritable.

......

After parting ways with Mia Lawrence, only Anna and Sophia remained on the road.

They walked in silence.

Sophia was worried that if she was too noisy, she might be left on the roadside.

So she was unusually quiet.

Sophia followed Anna home happily.

Seeing the clean and tidy apartment, she couldn't help but exclaim.

"Wow, this place looks so cozy!"

She changed into slippers and ran inside.

Anna smiled at her childish behavior.

It had been a long time since she had seen someone so pure.

Sophia was like a breath of fresh air, always laughing.

If only she could be that carefree too.

Anna felt a little dazed.

She used to be a girl who laughed often.

But life was unpredictable, and some things just wore away the beauty.

She changed her shoes and walked inside.

She took a drink from the fridge and handed it to Sophia.

"Your family must be in New York too. Why aren't you going back?"

She really couldn't understand why Sophia wanted to come here with her.

Sophia took the drink and sighed.

"It's not that I don't want to go back. I can't."

This was the first time Anna had seen her look so sad.

"Why not?"

"I ran away from abroad."

"My parents forced me to study overseas, but I hated it there."

"So after they sent me, I just came back on my own."

She smiled like a clever little fox.

But soon her expression turned gloomy again.

"Even though I came back, my mom is like a total dictator."

"She's super strict with me, so I absolutely can't let her know I'm back!"

Anna couldn't help but laugh at how she described her mother.

She liked Sophia's straightforward personality. It made things easy.

After resting for a while, Sophia looked at her curiously.

"But really, is there nothing going on between you and my cousin?"

"I always feel like there's more to it than meets the eye."

"Want to share?"

Anna immediately felt uneasy.

Mentioning Adrian Sinclair always made her tense.

She said calmly, "If we have any special relationship at all."

"It's that we're actually cousins too."

As she said this, her hands trembled slightly.

"What!?"

Sophia's eyes widened in shock.

She never expected them to be related.

Then she remembered her uncle talking about finding a wife.

She heard there was a stepdaughter.

So the person she thought her cousin liked was actually family.

Didn't that make her previous assumptions... wrong?

She quickly took a few gulps of her drink to calm down.
###Chapter 119

"It seems I'll have to change how I address you from now on." Sophia Roscente blinked, giving Anna Ross a playful look.

Anna hadn't expected her to say that and was slightly taken aback. "There's no need to change it. Just call me what you always have."

"How can that be okay?" Sophia shook her head with a serious expression. "I'm a good girl who knows the rules. If my family found out I was being disrespectful to you, I'd definitely get scolded!" Her eyes suddenly lit up as she affectionately linked arms with Anna. "How about I call you sister? I've always wanted to have an older sister!"

Anna was flustered by her sudden enthusiasm. But seeing the hopeful look in her eyes, she eventually gave a gentle nod.

She was just used to the quiet of being alone. Now, with a lively and energetic younger sister suddenly in her home, she couldn't quite adjust immediately.

Sophia leaned against the couch and suddenly moved closer. "Sister, are you really sure nothing happened between you and my cousin during your time here in New York?"

Anna's heart skipped a beat, and she almost held her breath. Had Sophia noticed something?

Fragments of last night flashed through her mind. Her cheeks warmed slightly, but she quickly suppressed her emotions. "No," she said calmly. "It was just normal work."

Sophia immediately deflated, her face falling. She had always thought these two were exceptionally well-suited. If they really got together, she would absolutely support it with both hands.

So what if they were distantly related? There was no blood connection. In her view, it wasn't a problem at all. Even if they decided to elope, she would support them without hesitation.

"By the way, I called my cousin several times today, but he didn't answer." Sophia pulled out her phone, showing a list of missed calls. "Do you know where he went?"

Anna looked at the red notifications, equally puzzled. "I'm not sure either. I didn't see him today, and he didn't tell me his plans. It might be an urgent matter. Don't worry too much."

Seeing that Anna didn't know the details either, Sophia simply turned off her phone and shrugged. "Forget it. He's always been this mysterious and unpredictable. I won't bother about him."

She looked around the small apartment, growing more satisfied with it. A sly smile spread across her face. "Sister, I want to keep living here. I really don't have anywhere else to go."

Anna was stunned. Live here with her?

New York was a huge city. Couldn't she find a place? Even if she truly had no options, wasn't her cousin still here?

Anna initially wanted to refuse. But then a thought occurred to her—if Sophia lived here, perhaps Adrian Sinclair wouldn't come over so freely.

"Alright," she agreed softly. "You can stay."

Sophia immediately cheered, feeling incredibly lucky to have gained such a beautiful and gentle older sister out of the blue.

After washing up, the two got into bed together. Anna was secretly relieved she had changed the sheets that morning. Otherwise, the situation would have been very awkward.

Sophia soon wrapped her arms around Anna like a plush toy and fell into a deep sleep. Anna could only smile helplessly.

The next morning, as Anna was getting ready for work, Sophia woke up groggily. Anna thought her movements had been too loud and disturbed her sleep.

But Sophia only mumbled drowsily, "Sister... bye..."

Then she fell back asleep.
###Chapter 120

Anna Ross smiled softly.

She gently closed the door.

Her best friend's antics warmed her heart.

Arriving at the office.

She clocked in as usual.

Her eyes drifted toward Adrian Sinclair's office.

The door remained firmly shut.

Her unease deepened.

She checked her phone.

No messages from him.

"Did something happen to him?" she murmured.

She looked up and spotted Noah Watson approaching.

"Mr. Watson!" she called out.

Noah stopped and turned.

"Can I help you, Ms. Ross?"

Anna glanced at the closed door.

"Have you seen Mr. Sinclair today?"

Noah maintained his polite smile.

"Mr. Sinclair is abroad on business."

Abroad?

The news surprised her.

But knowing he was safe brought relief.

This was better.

She wouldn't have to face him for a while.

Yet an inexplicable emptiness lingered.

Like a piece of her was missing.

Noah noticed her hesitation.

"He didn't tell you?"

Anna shook her head gently.

She was just his assistant.

He didn't owe her explanations.

"Noah, where's Adrian?"

An urgent voice interrupted.

Both turned.

Chloe Valentine approached swiftly.

Worry etched her features.

Noah gave a slight nod.

"Mr. Sinclair is overseas."

"Overseas? Why wasn't I informed?" Chloe frowned.

Her disbelief was evident.

Noah's smile remained steady.

"It was urgent. He only called to adjust his schedule."

"I don't have further details."

"You're welcome to contact him directly."

"Now if you'll excuse me."

He turned and left.

Anna's thoughts swirled.

Chloe focused on her.

"Adrian never leaves without telling me."

"Noah is lying!"

Anna recognized the probing.

She kept her tone polite.

"I don't know anything, Ms. Valentine."

"I just learned from Mr. Watson."

Disappointment flashed across Chloe's face.

She had hoped for insider information.

Her efforts were wasted.

She waved a dismissive hand.

"Whatever. Get back to work."

She walked away, hips swaying.

Anna returned to her desk.

With Adrian gone, she left on time.

After a quick meal, she headed to the bar.

The bar buzzed with energy tonight.

More patrons filled the space.

When she appeared.

The crowd erupted.

Chants of her name filled the air.
###Chapter 121
The bar owner stood on the second floor, surveying the packed venue below.
A grin stretched across his face.

He squinted at Anna Ross performing center stage.
The more he watched, the more convinced he became—she was heaven-sent luck.

His assistant approached with a glass, clicking his tongue appreciatively.
"This new performer we hired this year is phenomenal. You’ve got a sharp eye for talent."

The owner swirled his drink, smug.
"Of course. I knew she was special when I hired her. Since she joined, our revenue doubled. She's practically a walking money magnet."

"Absolutely remarkable," the assistant agreed before attending to other matters.

Onstage, Anna closed her eyes softly, lost in her own melody.
Gentle, soothing tunes were her preference—they let her dissolve completely into the music.

At the entrance, Lucas Evans was being dragged inside by two friends.

"You'll regret it if you skip tonight!" one friend gushed, gesturing excitedly.
"The new singer? Unreal. Sweet voice, even sweeter looks. Most stunning girl I've ever seen."

Lucas raised a skeptical brow.
"Sounds divine. Why don’t you ask her out?"

"Come on, a goddess like that’s out of our league! But if you're interested, we could introduce you."

"Pass." Lucas’s expression hardened instantly.
No one could compare to Anna in his heart.

His friends exchanged resigned headshakes, muttering about his stubbornness.

Inside, booming music hit them.
The friends eagerly pushed toward the front while Lucas settled into a booth with lackluster interest.

He’d just lifted his glass when a voice from the stage froze him mid-motion.

That voice…

Lucas’s head snapped up.
The drink nearly slipped from his hand as he recognized the figure onstage.

"Anna?" Shock and delight flooded him.
He never expected to see her in New York.

He hurried toward the stage, waving at her.
Anna spotted him, surprise flickering in her eyes before refocusing on her performance.

Understanding, Lucas nodded and stood quietly below the stage, listening.
His earlier mood vanished, replaced by radiant joy.

As Anna sang the final note, she hopped down lightly and joined him.

"Lucas." She greeted him with a smile.

He scrambled to offer his seat, eyes shining.
"Anna, your voice is incredible."

She gave a modest smile.
"Oh, it’s nothing special."

Lucas handed her a juice, his tone tender.
"I mean it. You’ve always been too humble."

Their shared laughter eased them into comfortable conversation.

"Anna, why are you performing here? Did you quit your job?" Lucas asked hopefully.

She shook her head gently.
"Not at all. It’s just a hobby. Singing after work helps me unwind."

Lifting her juice, she clinked glasses with him and drank it like a toast.
Alcohol wasn’t her forte—this was the safer choice.

###Chapter 122

Lucas’s fingers trembled slightly.

The red wine in his glass rippled.

He looked down at the dark red liquid, then threw his head back and drained the glass.

Anna Ross glanced at the clock on the wall. “I have to get on stage,” she said softly. “Enjoy yourself!”

Gathering her skirt, she hurried toward the stage, her hair brushing through the cool air.

The moment she disappeared, two friends immediately surrounded him.

“Nice one, Lucas! Where’d you meet such a pretty girl? You’ve been hiding her!”

The other winked. “Out with it. How long has this been going on?”

Lucas’s gaze remained fixed on the stage. His voice was hoarse. “We just know each other.”

“Tch, don’t play dumb. If you like her, go for it!” His friend nudged his shoulder. “I’ll go hold her up for you right now!”

He made as if to stand.

Lucas yanked him back down. “Drink,” he said tersely.

He tipped the bottle. The dark red liquid nearly overflowed the rim of the glass.

The two exchanged a look, then could only throw their heads back and drink.

Night fog drifted through the air.

Anna packed her bag and walked out from backstage.

Lucas was leaning against the doorframe, fragmented light glinting in his eyes. “Let me walk you home.”

She looked toward the empty street corner. Her best friend hadn’t shown up tonight.

“Okay,” she said, the corners of her eyes crinkling.

Moonlight soaked the quiet, long street.

Anna tilted her head to look at him. “Weren’t you originally in San Francisco?”

“The family business is in New York. I was there on a business trip before.” Lucas smiled. “What about you? Why did you come here?”

She stepped on a sycamore leaf. Her voice was light. “A work transfer. Adrian Sinclair returned to New York. I had to follow.”

That name was like a needle piercing Lucas’s heart.

He clenched his fingers, but still managed a smile. “If you ever need help, just find me anytime.”

Warm yellow lights glowed from the apartment building.

Anna stopped at the front steps. “Thank you for tonight.”

“Be careful on your way,” she said, waving before turning and disappearing into the hallway.

Lucas stood in place for a long time.

The wind tugged at his clothes, yet his chest felt burning hot.

When they parted in San Francisco, he thought it was goodbye forever.

It turned into a reunion.
###Chapter 123

A black Maybach sat silently in the night.

Its body almost merged with the darkness.

The two people who had just passed by didn't notice its presence at all.

Adrian Sinclair leaned against the seat with an expressionless face.

His gaze was icy cold as he watched everything happening outside the window.

The driver in the front seat was so nervous his palms were sweating.

Since that pair of figures appeared, the temperature inside the car had plummeted to freezing.

All the oppressive feeling came from the man in the back seat.

The driver stole a glance through the rearview mirror.

Mr. Sinclair had just returned to the country today and came straight here.

Unexpectedly, it was to secretly watch that girl.

Even more surprising was that she was accompanied by another man.

This was completely unlike Mr. Sinclair's usual style.

Adrian's gaze remained fixed on that residential building.

Only when a certain window lit up did he speak indifferently. "Drive."

The driver immediately started the engine.

The vehicle quickly drove away, leaving only the sound of wind behind.

Anna Ross collapsed tiredly onto the sofa.

She still felt somewhat guilty remembering Lucas Evans seeing her home.

Ever since that incident, every time she had contact with Lucas, it felt like she was doing something wrong.

It was all because of that control freak Adrian.

Fortunately, he wasn't in New York.

Otherwise, if he saw, it would cause a huge uproar again.

While feeling relieved, Anna also thought she wasn't being normal.

Why should she listen to him?

Making friends was her freedom.

What did it have to do with Adrian?

What was she even afraid of?

She felt like something was missing at home.

"Sophia?"

She hadn't seen Sophia Roscente since she returned.

The apartment wasn't that big.

It was impossible not to hear her come in.

Anna pushed open the bedroom door.

It was empty inside.

She immediately became anxious.

Where could a young girl go so late at night?

She hurriedly dialed the phone.

It rang for a long time before being answered.

"Where are you? Why aren't you home?"

Sophia's cheerful voice came through. "I'm out having fun.

You go to sleep first, sis. Don't wait for me." Then she hung up.

Anna stared at her phone in a daze.

Then it occurred to her that Sophia knew New York better than she did.

Someone that old wouldn't get lost.

After plugging in her phone to charge, she opened the refrigerator.

Aside from the fruit she bought with her best friend last time, it was completely empty.

She picked up an apple and took a bite.

It seemed she needed to find time to go shopping.

The daytime work plus exercise had been exhausting.

She almost fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.

She slept soundly through the night without any dreams.

When she woke up the next day, she instinctively looked beside her.

The bed was empty.

Sophia actually hadn't come back all night.

Didn't she say she had nowhere to go?

So where was she staying now?

Countless questions flooded Anna's mind.

She glanced at the time.

She decided to go to work first.

She would contact her later.
###Chapter 124

She finished washing up.

She quickly called a car.

She kept calling Sophia Roscente's number on the way.

No one answered.

Anxiety coiled around her heart like vines.

She arrived at the company.

She walked quickly to her workstation.

She looked up.

A familiar figure caught her eye.

Her heart skipped a beat.

It was him.

Adrian Sinclair walked from the other end of the hallway.

His gaze swept over her direction.

His eyes were as indifferent as ever.

Not a trace of emotion could be seen.

A sweet, coquettish voice suddenly rang out.

"Adrian!"

Chloe Valentine approached quickly in her high heels.

Her smile was bright and brilliant.

"Why didn't you tell me you were going abroad?"

"Did everything go well?"

Anna Ross's fingertips trembled slightly.

She always felt a chill whenever she heard that tone.

She wondered how Adrian could stand it.

Adrian remembered what he saw last night.

He glanced coldly at Anna.

Then he turned to Chloe.

His slender fingers lifted her chin.

A lazy smile curled his lips.

"At least you know how to care about me."

Chloe was instantly dazzled.

She held his arm and giggled.

"Of course."

"I am your fiancée, after all."

Adrian chuckled lowly.

He deliberately put his arm around Chloe's shoulder in front of Anna.

Chloe was overjoyed.

She didn't expect him to be so intimate right after returning.

It seemed she held a certain place in his heart.

The two walked toward the office together.

Anna lowered her eyes.

Her eyes ached with soreness.

She put down the documents and turned to leave.

The cool wind on the rooftop hit her face.

It dispersed the restlessness in her heart.

But her thoughts became even more chaotic.

She remembered everything with Adrian.

A sharp pain pierced her heart.

Inside the office.

Chloe was about to lean on Adrian's shoulder.

But he suddenly let go.

His tone was distant.

"This is the company."

"It's better to keep some distance."

He walked straight to his desk.

He turned on his computer and started working.

Chloe stood frozen in place.

Her fingertips still held the warmth from him.

It felt like what just happened was a dream.

She bit her lip.

Her eyes slightly reddened.

"Adrian..."

"Weren't we fine just a moment ago?"

Adrian focused on typing.

He didn't even look up.

"It's work hours."

"Time to focus on business."

He glanced up briefly.

"Go back to work first."

"We can talk after work if there's anything."

Chloe was unwilling but could only nod.

She gently closed the door and left.

The office returned to silence.

Adrian leaned back in his chair.

He thought for a moment, then suddenly stood up.

He pushed open the office door.

The Executive Assistant's seat was empty.

He frowned and took out his phone.

He dialed a number.

"It's work hours."

"Where are you?"
###Chapter 125

Anna Ross was surprised.

He had noticed her absence so quickly.

Though she didn't want to witness his intimate interactions with his fiancée.

Work couldn't be delayed.

She responded quietly, "Alright, I'll be right back."

After hanging up, she hurried back to her desk.

She had just settled into her seat.

When her office phone rang abruptly.

Anna assumed it was a work-related call.

But a deep male voice spoke instead, "Come to my office."

The line went dead immediately.

Her smile vanished instantly.

He really knew how to order her around.

Why hadn't he made it clear during their earlier call?

But she was his Executive Assistant now.

Professionalism was mandatory.

She knocked and entered the office.

Adrian Sinclair lounged lazily in his chair.

His slender fingers casually flipped through documents.

He stopped when she entered.

His gaze fixed directly on her.

Anna expected work instructions.

She initiated the conversation, "Mr. Sinclair, what do you need?"

She had been working tirelessly to familiarize herself with operations.

Even if he deliberately made things difficult, she could handle it.

"Nothing urgent."

A playful smile touched his lips.

"I just noticed that in my absence."

"You seem quite comfortable."

He stood and moved closer to her.

"Not only leaving on time."

"But also freely meeting whoever you wish."

Anna's temper flared instantly.

She stepped back, glaring at him.

"Of course I can't compare to you."

"Returning to a fiancée's devoted care."

She regretted the words as soon as they left her mouth.

Uncertain why she had spoken them.

Adrian watched her with deep intensity.

An unreadable emotion flickered in his eyes.

He looked down at her, eyebrow raised.

His tone was teasing, "Getting so worked up, Miss Ross."

"Could it be jealousy?"

"My fiancée's concern is natural."

"You seem overly invested."

Anna's cheeks burned.

She bit her lip, retorting, "Who's jealous!"

"You started this."

Adrian's lips curved slightly.

She really refused to admit defeat.

He studied her for a moment.

Then turned toward the floor-to-ceiling window.

Remembering that night.

He still hadn't given her an explanation.

Never expecting she had been inexperienced.

How should he interpret everything that happened before?

After a silent pause.

He spoke slowly, "About that night..."

"I will take responsibility."

Anna froze completely.

She had been trying hard to forget.

Yet he insisted on bringing it up.

She clenched her hands.

Struggling to remain calm, "That won't be necessary."

"I don't need your responsibility."
###Chapter 126

The office fell into dead silence.

Adrian Sinclair turned and closed the distance between them.

Dark fire churned in his eyes.

His slender fingers clamped down on her shoulders.

The force was enough to make her wince in pain.

"Is this how badly you want to cut ties with me?"

His voice was dangerously low.

Each word seemed to be forced through gritted teeth.

Anna Ross couldn't break free.

She could only close her eyes.

"Yes."

He let out a cold laugh.

His usually cool eyes were now filled with anger.

"Don't you want money?"

"I have plenty."

"Let me be your sugar daddy."

"I'll ensure you never want for anything."

"All you have to do is please me."

Anna's stomach churned.

So this was what he meant by taking responsibility.

It was just another way to humiliate her even more.

She gave a bitter smile.

"Do you think that's appropriate, Mr. Sinclair?"

"You have a fiancée."

"What would she think if she found out?"

"How would Grandpa Frederick view you?"

She thought this would make him back down.

Instead, he chuckled darkly.

"Do I care about any of that?"

"What others think is none of my concern."

He leaned in closer.

"Name your price."

"How much to be with me?"

Anna's fingertips turned cold.

He was completely unreasonable.

"I don't have time for these games."

She turned to leave.

But he yanked her back.

"Is it because of Lucas Evans?"

His eyes turned to ice.

"How much is he giving you?"

"I'll double it."

A sharp pain pierced Anna's heart.

He always knew how to use money to humiliate her.

"Adrian Sinclair."

"Not everyone is as shameless as you."

She viciously shook off his hand.

She stormed out without looking back, slamming the door behind her.
###Chapter 127

Anna Ross quickly walked out of the office and returned to her desk.

She glanced back.

The office door remained tightly shut.

He hadn't followed her out.

She breathed a sigh of relief.

This was the company.

He probably wouldn't do anything reckless.

She felt reassured.

But his words sat like a heavy stone in her heart.

It was deeply uncomfortable.

Anna picked up her phone.

Sophia Roscente hadn't called back.

There were no messages either.

She began to worry.

She decided to go find her after work.

Adrian Sinclair never came out.

Maybe he felt awkward too.

She shook her head.

Focusing on her work.

When her back and waist ached from sitting.

She glanced at the time.

It was already time to leave.

She looked toward the office door.

Hesitated for a moment.

Still, she didn't knock.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

It startled her.

It was the bar owner.

She hesitated before answering.

The owner's excited voice came through.
"Miss Ross, can you come in early today?"

Anna was confused.
"I thought we agreed on a fixed schedule?"

The owner laughed.
"You're just too popular."
"Customers are already here waiting for you."
"I had no choice but to call you."

Anna was her cash cow.

The bar was packed every night.

Money was practically rolling in.

She had struck gold.

Anna thought about it.

Going early might be fine.

She had nothing else to do anyway.

Earning a little extra money wouldn't hurt.

She agreed softly.
"Alright, I'll finish up here and come over."

The owner promised excitedly.
"Don't worry, work hard and I'll treat you right."
"Just remember to be on time."

After hanging up.

She still didn't dare to leave.

Even though Adrian hadn't said anything.

She felt she needed to tell him.

She waited for a long time.

No one came out of the office.

She didn't want to go in herself.

Just then, Noah Watson walked over carrying some documents.

Anna smiled and waved.

Noah asked.
"Is there something you need, Executive Assistant Ross?"

She spoke guiltily.
"Is Mr. Sinclair still in his office?"

Noah looked at her curiously.
"Mr. Sinclair left a long time ago."
"You didn't know?"
She sat right outside the office.
It was a bit strange she didn't know.

Anna was stunned.

She had been sitting here the whole time.

She didn't know when he had left.

Maybe he left while she was in the restroom.

Noah continued.
"If you need something, Executive Assistant Ross, you can tell me first."
###Chapter 128

Anna Ross picked up her bag and stood.

"I'm leaving for the day, Noah."

She quickly left the office.

Noah Watson stood still, holding a stack of files.

He pushed open the door to the CEO's office.

His phone suddenly rang.

He answered immediately.

Loud music blared from the other end.

"Noah, come to MILIT Restaurant."

"Bring Anna Ross with you."

Noah glanced at the empty Executive Assistant desk.

"Mr. Sinclair, Executive Assistant Ross has already left for the day."

"Should I call her back?"

There was a brief silence on the phone.

Adrian Sinclair's voice came through again.

"That won't be necessary."

"Just come yourself."

Noah set down the files.

He drove to the restaurant.

He remembered Adrian leaving in a hurry that afternoon.

He must have been meeting a client.

Only two people were in the private room.

Adrian sat at the head of the table.

Across from him was Mr. Han, from the partner company.

Noah greeted him warmly.

"Mr. Han, it's been a while."

"You're looking well."

Easton White laughed heartily.

He gave Adrian a thumbs up.

"Mr. Sinclair's assistant certainly knows how to talk."

Adrian gave a faint smile.

Easton White warmly invited him.

"We're all old friends here."

"Sit down and join us for a bite."

Noah sat down calmly.

Easton White raised his glass.

"A toast to our cooperation."

All three raised their glasses and clinked.

Adrian took a small sip.

Easton White began talking animatedly.

"Mr. Sinclair is so young."

"Yet already running the Lowell Group."

"Truly impressive."

Adrian smiled without speaking.

Noah chimed in at the right moment.

The atmosphere gradually warmed up.

After several rounds of drinks.

Easton White was still eager for more.

"Drinking here isn't lively enough."

"Shall we continue at a bar?"

Adrian lightly tapped the table with his fingertips.

He gave a slight nod.

The three stood up to leave.

Dreamland Bar.

Anna kept dialing the phone.

The line was always busy.

Her heart sank deeper and deeper.

Sophia Roscente was missing.

If something happened to her so soon after arriving.

Anna would never forgive herself.

Someone urged her from outside the door.

The owner pushed the door open.

"The customers are getting impatient."

"Why are you still here?"

Anna hung up the phone.

"Owner, I have an emergency."

"I can't perform tonight."

The owner looked troubled.

"Many customers came specifically for you."

"At least sing two songs before you go."
###Chapter 129

Anna Ross was frantic, but she didn't dare risk her job.

She could only agree. "I'll sing two songs, then I have to leave."

The boss nodded repeatedly, urging her to get on stage quickly.

The bar crowd had been eagerly awaiting her. He didn't want to miss this money-making opportunity.

Anna put away her phone and slowly walked onto the stage.

The moment she appeared, the audience erupted into deafening cheers.

The atmosphere instantly boiled over.

She glanced at the song list and chose two favorites.

The cheers grew louder and more intense.

This soon caught Noah Watson's attention.

He looked around curiously, wondering who could cause such a sensation.

Noah looked up at the stage and froze.

He never expected to see her performing here.

Sinclair Group paid excellent salaries. Why did she need a side job?

A young girl working so hard... Did she have some difficulties?

He leaned over and whispered to Adrian Sinclair, who was drinking. "Mr. Sinclair, that looks like Executive Assistant Ross on stage."

Just then, the singing began.

Adrian's hand, holding his glass, paused slightly.

He knew that voice all too well.

This song had once been their shared favorite.

In a daze, he realized it had been so long since he last heard her sing.

So long that he had almost forgotten her beautiful voice.

Back in college, she would often link arms with him and sing softly just for him.

He threw back the rest of his red wine, his gaze locked on the figure on stage.

Easton White was also captivated by the heavenly voice.

His eyes glazed over as he stared at the stage.

He couldn't help but marvel. "Beautiful. So beautiful!"

"I haven't seen such a stunning beauty in ages!"

He licked his lips lewdly, his greedy eyes following Anna's every move.

"If such a perfect specimen could belong to me..."

He let out a strange laugh, as if lost in a lurid fantasy.

Noah watched his eager - to - act appearance with disgust.

Adrian gave him a cold look.

He spoke slowly. "I'm afraid that's not a privilege you'll enjoy, Mr. Han."

Easton White, who had been about to stand up, paused.

He asked, confused. "What do you mean, Mr. Sinclair?"

Even as he said this, that graceful figure on stage kept tugging at his heartstrings.

He almost couldn't stop himself from rushing up and sweeping the beauty into his arms.

Adrian lightly swirled his glass.

Visible anger had already gathered in his eyes. "Because she's already taken."

"It would be... unwise for you to make any moves, Mr. Han."

Easton White immediately understood.

He forced a dry laugh. "Quite unwise indeed. Let's just keep drinking."

He saw clearly that the woman on stage had a special relationship with Adrian.

Future business dealings depended on Adrian's goodwill.

He couldn't ruin that over a woman.

Noah was secretly astonished.

Since when was she taken?

How did the CEO know?

He pondered for a moment but found no answer.

He simply stopped thinking about it.

Focusing on his own duties was enough.
###Chapter 130

Anna Ross stood at the center of the stage.

Thunderous applause erupted from the audience.

Cheers washed over her like waves.

Yet her mind was elsewhere.

Sophia Roscente's phone kept ringing unanswered.

Anna finished singing two songs.

She bowed hastily and left the stage.

She needed to find Sophia immediately.

Anna hurried through the crowd.

Lights flickered around her.

The music was deafening.

She looked down, searching for her phone.

She nearly collided with someone.

Anna fumbled to steady her phone.

Her breath caught when she looked up.

Adrian Sinclair stood before her.

His black suit was impeccably tailored.

It starkly contrasted with the bar's atmosphere.

His gaze locked heavily onto her.

"My executive assistant refuses my sugar arrangement."

"Turns out it's because of this wonderful job."

He deliberately emphasized the last three words.

Anna tightened her grip on her phone.

She knew he intended to humiliate her again.

But she had no time for games now.

"I enjoy this job very much."

"I can support myself."

"I don't need anyone's sugar arrangement."

She tried to step around him.

Adrian caught her wrist.

His grip was firm and unyielding.

Anna stopped moving.

She simply looked at him.

A rare flicker of emotion showed in his eyes.

"I had to leave suddenly that morning."

"It was an urgent matter."

"I wasn't deliberately avoiding you."

Anna paused slightly.

So he thought she cared about that.

She found it almost laughable.

"You're overthinking it, Mr. Sinclair."

"I didn't give it a second thought."

"Certainly not going to cling to you."

She pulled her hand free.

Adrian's expression darkened instantly.

Anna continued, "I have an emergency right now."

"Sophia is missing."

"Her phone keeps going to voicemail."

A cough escaped her.

Adrian stepped closer.

"Who's missing?"

His brows furrowed deeply.

"How do you know Sophia has disappeared?"
###Chapter 131

Anna Ross finally remembered Sophia Roscente's connection to Adrian Sinclair.

She had been so focused on worrying about Sophia's whereabouts.

She had completely forgotten about that.

"She came to New York. She's been staying with me."

"But she didn't come home last night. She isn't answering her phone."

"I was busy at work today and didn't have time to look for her."

Anna looked at him with deep concern.

"I haven't been able to reach her since I got off work."

Adrian's expression darkened instantly.

He grabbed her wrist and pulled her outside.

Anna hurried to keep up with his pace.

"Do you know any places she might go in New York?"

Adrian opened the car door and slid into the driver's seat.

She quickly got into the passenger seat.

His lips were pressed into a thin line, his expression stern.

Anna took out her phone and dialed Sophia's number again.

The receiver only emitted a busy signal.

Her small face crumpled with worry.

She glanced over and saw Adrian making a call.

His voice was icy. "Take people and search. You must find her."

Anna felt a slight sense of relief.

She remembered he had his own connections in New York.

More people searching would make it easier.

She just hoped Sophia was safe.

She tried calling one more time.

Still no answer.

Guilt washed over her.

She should have insisted Sophia come home last night.

"How did you get so close to her?" Adrian suddenly asked.

Anna hesitated for a moment.

"We ran into each other the last time she was in New York."

"We had a meal together. You weren't there then."

"She said she had nowhere to stay, so I took her in."

Adrian didn't ask any more questions.

The car stopped in front of a bar.

Anna followed him out of the car.

Having someone familiar with the area was better than her searching blindly.

The music inside the bar was deafening.

People were dancing wildly in the crowd.

They split up to search.

They scoured the entire bar but found nothing.

Adrian's expression grew increasingly grim.

They rushed to the next location.

They searched every place Sophia might possibly go.

Still, there was no sign of her.

Anna was filled with a sense of guilt.

Adrian spoke suddenly. "You should go home and check."

"Maybe she's already back."

Anna was taken aback.

That was actually a good idea.

If all else failed, they could only call the police.

She nodded and took a taxi home.

Adrian continued searching outside.

Anna rushed to her apartment building.

She ran upstairs.

She found the door slightly ajar.

She pushed it open.

A phone was ringing on the sofa.

The sound of running water came from the bathroom.

Had she really come back?
###Chapter 132

Anna Ross's heart finally settled after confirming Sophia Roscente's message on her phone.

She sent a safety text to Adrian Sinclair.

After finishing, she collapsed onto the sofa.

The earlier tension had left her mentally and physically drained.

Now she felt completely empty.

Sophia happened to come out after her shower.

She looked surprised to see Anna back.

"Anna, you're back?"

Anna looked up at her.

"Why didn't you answer any of my calls?"

"Well, because..."

Sophia bent down to pick up her phone.

Her expression looked guilty.

Just then.

The door burst open with a bang.

Adrian appeared urgently at the doorway.

The moment he saw Sophia.

His anger visibly surged.

"Sophia Roscente, you've got some nerve?"

His voice was icy.

He stepped toward them.

Anna immediately stood up.

Sophia quickly hid behind her.

Anna shook her head helplessly.

But since Sophia had already taken refuge.

She had to speak up bravely.

"Let's talk this through calmly!"

She tried her best to shield Sophia behind her.

Adrian glanced at her coldly.

"Step aside," he said frostily.

"I'm dealing with her today."

Sophia muttered discontentedly.

"I just missed some calls."

"Is that worth all this anger?"

She secretly tugged at Anna's sleeve.

"Why did you tell him?"

"You've really gotten me into trouble now."

Seeing her cousin's murderous glare.

Her heart pounded nervously.

"You didn't say I couldn't tell him when you came."

Anna sounded surprised.

She thought Adrian already knew about Sophia sneaking back.

Though unclear about their relationship.

Seeing Adrian's demeanor.

He must be very strict normally.

She worried she might have gotten Sophia into trouble.

Sophia was rendered speechless.

Pouting like an angry little pufferfish.

She hid behind Anna, too scared to come out.

Only peeking her head out slightly.

"Cousin, just this once."

"I won't do it again."

"Don't be so mean."

"Now you want to beg for mercy?"

"Do you have any idea how worried everyone was?"

He shot her a cold look.

"Perhaps I shouldn't let you stay any longer."

Hearing this.

Sophia immediately panicked.

She quickly sought help from Anna.

Her eyes pleading desperately.

Anna had no choice but to mediate bravely.

"Calm down."

"Let's discuss this properly."

"Have a seat first."

"I'll get you some water."

Though reluctant.

There was no other way at the moment.

Sophia immediately followed her.

She didn't dare stay alone with her devil cousin now.
###Chapter 133

"Stop."

Anna Ross was about to turn around when Adrian Sinclair's icy voice cut through the air.

His expression was dark, a chilling aura radiating from him that seemed to freeze the very atmosphere.

The three of them stood frozen in the living room.

Under the harsh lighting, the atmosphere was suffocatingly tense.

Adrian suddenly grabbed Sophia Roscente's wrist.

His narrow eyes swept toward Anna. "Come back with me." His tone brooked no argument, heavy with oppressive authority.

He began pulling Sophia toward the door.

Sophia panicked, frantically clutching at Anna's clothes, her eyes welling with tears. "Sis, please help me. I don't want to go with him…"

She looked like a frightened fawn, utterly pitiful.

Anna's heart softened, remembering Sophia's previous pleas.

She spoke with difficulty. "Mr. Sinclair, please give her another chance. Sophia knows she was wrong. Everyone makes mistakes. What matters is learning from them."

"Cousin, I promise I won't do it again!" Sophia nodded vigorously, her fingers gripping Anna tightly.

Adrian's gaze swept over Anna, the sharpness in his eyes softening slightly.

He was silent for a moment before releasing Sophia. His tone remained cold. "You can keep staying here. But don't cause any more trouble. Otherwise, I will personally send you back."

His menacing aura hadn't dissipated. His thin lips were pressed into a tight line, making it hard to look directly at him.

He glanced at Anna, worried her soft heart would be too lenient, unable to keep Sophia in check.

"Cousin, I swear I won't do it again!" Sophia assured him repeatedly, not forgetting to pull Anna in as a witness.

Adrian's gaze fixed on Anna.

Anna's heart raced. She steeled herself and spoke. "We should offer more trust. I will keep an eye on her."

After speaking, she bit her lower lip, annoyed at her own flustered state around him.

Adrian didn't press further. He just gave Sophia a warning look and turned to leave. "Remember your promise."

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief and stuck her tongue out at his retreating back.

Suddenly, Adrian turned around.

She yelped in fright and immediately retreated into her room.

"You. Walk me downstairs."

"What?"

Anna looked around. She was the only one left.

He wanted her to walk him down? The hallway was brightly lit. What was there to be afraid of?

Though confused, she silently followed.

The night was deep, the surroundings quiet. Only their footsteps echoed.

Anna followed half a step behind him, looking up at his broad back.

It looked inexplicably reassuring…
###Chapter 134

"Explain."

He stopped abruptly.

His low voice cut through the night.

Anna Ross was caught off guard.

She nearly collided with his straight back.

She retreated half a step.

Her heels clicked softly against the pavement.

"There's nothing to explain."

She lifted her gaze to meet his.

"The bar pays well."

"My time after work belongs to me."

Adrian Sinclair turned slowly.

Streetlights shattered into cold stars in his eyes.

Anna suddenly noticed—

His usually neat hair was slightly disheveled.

A few dark strands fell across his forehead.

Making his features appear even more profound.

He raised an eyebrow.

A faint curve touched his lips.

"Since my Executive Assistant enjoys watching so much."

"Perhaps you should skip the bar."

"Stay by my side."

"Let you look your fill."

Anna sharply turned her face away.

Her ears felt warm.

"Unnecessary."

"I will continue working at the bar."

"Please do not interfere with my freedom, Mr. Sinclair."

His eyes darkened.

"How much does the bar pay you?"

"I'll double it."

"Plus extra."

Anna clenched her fingers.

Nails digging into her palms.

"Thank you for your offer, Mr. Sinclair."

"But I prefer to earn my own living."

"Charity from others—"

"I cannot accept."

She turned toward the building.

Her skirt brushed against the cold steps.

Adrian reached out.

But only caught the night wind passing through.

He stood still.

Watching her figure disappear behind the iron door.

Warm yellow light turned on upstairs.

He slammed his fist against the steering wheel.

The engine growled was hoarsely.

Why did she have to be so stubborn?

How exactly has Howard Lowell been taking care of her?

Anna pushed the door open.

A figure flung itself into her arms.

Sophia Roscente clung to her like a frightened kitten.

Holding tightly to her waist.

"Sis!"

"If it weren't for you today—"

"I'd definitely have been beaten to a pulp!"

Anna sighed.

Gently patting her back.

"Don't ever do this again."

"Everyone was worried."

Sophia sniffled.

Nodding vigorously.

"I promise!"

"I'll come straight home from now on!"

Anna looked into her sparkling eyes.

Suddenly feeling exhausted.

By day, she was Adrian Sinclair's Executive Assistant.

By night, a bar server.

Now, also a guardian for a troubled girl.

She was truly too busy to even catch her breath.
###Chapter 135

Moonlight spilled like liquid silver, draping New York's most affluent neighborhood in serene quiet.

A black Maybach glided through the ornate iron gates.

Adrian Sinclair parked with practiced ease, his long fingers releasing the steering wheel.

He strode toward the main house, servants bowing in unison on either side.

Adrian gave a slight nod and moved through the foyer into the living room.

Grandpa stood before the massive aquarium, intently feeding the fish.

A faint smile touched Adrian's lips as he took a pinch of food from a servant's tray.

He stood beside his grandfather, gently scattering the flakes into the water.

Grandpa immediately frowned and stopped his hand. "That's enough."

"Any more and these precious fish will overeat."

He chuckled warmly, signaling for the servant to remove the tray.

Adrian laughed softly. "Grandpa, you didn't even give me a chance to impress you."

"You're the one who came home so late," Grandpa feigned sternness.

Adrian steadied the older man's arm, his voice gentle. "Company matters kept me."

"I would have returned to you sooner if possible."

Grandpa patted his hand affectionately. "You work too hard."

They walked slowly toward the sitting area, their figures a picture of harmony.

Nearby, several maids whispered among themselves.

"Mr. Sinclair is perfect. So capable and filial."

"I wonder who will be lucky enough to marry him?"

"It must be Miss Valentine. Grandpa mentions her often."

Someone suddenly hushed them nervously. "Stop talking!"

The two maids immediately lowered their heads, not daring to look up.

Adrian shot them a cold glance but ultimately held his tongue.

Grandpa settled onto the sofa, his expression turning serious. "I heard you went abroad recently?"

"Yes. A transnational project required negotiation." Adrian leaned back lazily.

"The initial talks took time, but we secured it successfully."

Grandpa nodded with satisfaction. "You always manage to surprise me."

He paused, his tone deepening. "But what concerns me most is your marriage."

"I'm getting old. My only wish is to see you settled."

Adrian sat up straight. "You're in excellent health. Don't say such things."

He deftly avoided the marriage topic, irritation flickering in his eyes.

Grandpa sighed. "Life is unpredictable. I've made my peace with that."

His voice held firm resolve. "I've decided you and Chloe should become engaged soon."

"This cannot be delayed any longer."

Adrian remained silent, his expression detached.

He didn't dislike Chloe Valentine, yet the thought of marriage filled him with inexplicable resistance.

An image of Anna Ross surfaced unbidden in his mind.

He tugged at his tie in frustration, his gaze darkening.
###Chapter 136

"Adrian, Chloe is truly a wonderful girl."

Grandpa set down his teacup, his gaze deep and thoughtful.

"Good family background, gentle personality, and quite lovely."

"She seems very well-matched with you."

"I believe she is worthy of joining our family."

His tone was gentle, yet every word carried undeniable weight.

What he still worried about most was his grandson's future.

Adrian Sinclair remained silent for a moment before speaking slowly. "Grandpa, the company is at a critical stage right now."

"I want to focus on my career first."

"Marriage... is not urgent."

Seeing his continued resistance, the old man shook his head helplessly.

"Adrian, be honest with me."

"Is your hesitation because of... Anna Ross?"

He hadn't thought much of it before.

But Chloe's words the other day had opened his eyes.

Coupled with Adrian's special attention to that girl, it was truly suspicious.

Even if she was Howard's stepdaughter, with no blood relation, it wouldn't be against morality.

Hearing that name, Adrian's eyes flickered for an instant.

Her stubborn face appeared before him.

Even if he forced money into her hands, she would never stay by his side.

He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, only cold indifference remained.

"It has nothing to do with her."

"This is my own decision."

"I hope you can respect that, Grandpa."

How shrewd Grandpa was; he could see through the evasion.

"Is that so?" He smiled faintly, his gaze sharp. "I'm not so sure."

The more he denied it, the more suspicious it seemed.

Adrian leaned back into the sofa, supporting his forehead with one hand, and fell silent.

"Adrian, that year in college, after your breakup..."

Grandpa took a sip of tea and spoke slowly.

"You were dispirited for a long time."

"You completely fell apart."

"Was it... because of this girl?"

Back then, he had been deeply worried, trying everything to no avail.

Fortunately, Adrian eventually pulled himself together.

But one thing had always puzzled him.

He had tried multiple times to persuade him to take over the company, but Adrian always refused.

After that heartbreak, however, he seemed like a different person.

He became a workaholic, not only taking on the heavy responsibility but also managing the company impeccably.

He thought the boy must have been greatly stimulated to change so drastically.

Adrian's expression darkened slightly, a faint curve forming at the corner of his lips.

"That's all in the past. I've long forgotten."

"Now she is just my Executive Assistant."

"And also Uncle's stepdaughter, my cousin."

"I couldn't possibly have any other thoughts about her."

"You." Grandpa shook his head with a light laugh.

"Others can't hide things from me, and you certainly can't either."

This child was usually calm and composed, unflappable.

Only when that girl was mentioned would a trace of elusive panic flicker in his eyes.

Grandpa let out a long sigh.

He never liked interfering in the younger generation's affairs.

But when it came to Adrian's marriage, he had to insist.
###Chapter 137

Adrian Sinclair stood in the center of the study.

Soft shadows fell across his sharply defined features under the light.

Grandpa sat in a mahogany chair.

His fingertips tapped lightly on the desk.

"Adrian, your grandpa isn't an inflexible man." His voice was low. "But whether she's someone you once liked or not, there's absolutely no possibility between you two."

He emphasized his words. "The only person you can marry is Chloe Valentine."

Adrian's expression remained calm, but a flicker of emotion passed through his eyes.

"Grandpa, this matter has nothing to do with her." His voice was steady. "Keeping her by my side is purely because of her outstanding work ability."

Grandpa stared at him, his gaze piercing.

"If that's the case, why are you so reluctant to set a wedding date with Chloe?"

Adrian's fingers tightened slightly.

"I just think it's too fast." He relaxed his fingers. "I'm not ready yet."

Grandpa suddenly broke into a violent coughing fit.

A servant hurriedly handed him pills and a glass of water.

"Sir, it's time for your medicine."

Adrian frowned deeply.

"Grandpa, are you feeling unwell?"

Grandpa waved his hand. After taking the pills, his breathing gradually steadied.

"Just a minor cold. It's nothing." He spoke slowly. "Adrian, your marriage to Chloe is beneficial for both the company and you."

He held his grandson's hand.

"But I hope even more that you can develop feelings for each other. Marriage shouldn't be entirely about exchanging benefits."

As for that Anna Ross, he disliked her from the first glance.

Moreover, her background was special.

He kept these thoughts to himself, not voicing them aloud.

"I understand, Grandpa." Adrian replied faintly.

Grandpa patted his shoulder and stood up with the servant's support before leaving.

"I hope you can understand your grandpa's good intentions."

The living room fell silent.

Adrian leaned back on the sofa, crossing his long legs.

The chandelier on the ceiling dazzled his eyes.

So many people said he treated Anna Ross differently.

Even he himself began to feel confused.

What exactly were his feelings for her?

Resentment, or an attachment that never disappeared?

He rubbed his temples irritably.

Regardless, he did not want to marry Chloe Valentine.

His phone screen lit up.

He scrolled through his chat history with Anna Ross.

A cold smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

He had never been able to let go of what happened back then.

Now, he should actually thank her for abandoning him.

"Anna Ross." His voice was hoarse. "What do you think of me now?"

"Achoo!"

Anna Ross rubbed her nose and continued organizing files.

Someone must be talking about her behind her back.

The bathroom door opened.

Sophia Roscente rushed out holding her phone.

"Sis, come quick! You're trending!"
###Chapter 138

Anna Ross put down her bag.

Sophia Roscente held her phone closer.

The screen showed a trending post in the bar scene.

The title was eye-catching: "New Resident Singing Goddess Stuns the Entire Crowd."

"Anna, you're famous!" Sophia waved her phone excitedly.

"Several bars want to poach you. Their offers keep getting higher."

Anna was stunned.

She never imagined her singing would attract attention.

If she had pursued music back then, would she be a professional singer now?

She shook her head with a light laugh.

"It was just filling in. They'll forget in a few days."

Sophia jumped onto the bed, sitting cross-legged.

"Don't underestimate yourself! When you're famous, your value doubles."

"Making money will be as easy as breathing."

Anna's eyes flickered.

If she could really earn enough, she could take her mother away from here.

They could escape all restraints.

She lay down, responding softly.

"I'll take your good words."

Sophia poked her shoulder teasingly.

"Didn't expect my sister to be a hidden money-minded girl~"

Anna didn't reply.

If not forced by life, who would want to run after money all day?

She closed her eyes, a trace of bitterness hidden at the corner of her mouth.

That night, she dreamed of standing center stage under brilliant lights.

The audience's applause roared like tidal waves.

Her mother sat in the front row, smiling and waving at her.

They moved into a new home filled with sunlight.

No tall buildings blocked the view outside the window.

Only a vast blue sky.

The alarm clock rang abruptly.

Anna sat up suddenly, the dream's warmth still lingering.

She hurriedly washed up and changed clothes.

Grabbing her bag, she rushed downstairs.

At the apartment entrance, Lucas Evans leaned against his car.

Morning light fell on his shoulders, making his smile especially gentle.

"Anna, let me drive you to work." He opened the passenger door naturally.

Anna instinctively glanced around.

The morning street was empty, only a few sparrows hopping onto branches.

She still felt uneasy, lowering her voice.

"Lucas, really, you don't have to do this..."

Lucas chuckled lightly.

"Don't worry. This is New York."

His gaze was firm.

"Adrian Sinclair can't touch me."

Anna gripped her bag strap tightly.

She wasn't afraid of Adrian targeting Lucas.

She only feared deeper entanglement.

Lucas had already leaned over to fasten her seatbelt.

The engine started.

He reminded her gently.

"If we don't leave now, the time clock won't wait for anyone."
###Chapter 139

Anna Ross glanced at her phone.

Her pupils contracted sharply.

She would be late if she didn't leave immediately.

Adrian Sinclair's cold face instantly surfaced in her mind.

The open car door felt like a trap.

She tightened her grip on her backpack strap.

Finally, she bent down and slid into the passenger seat.

A flicker of amusement crossed Lucas Evans' eyes.

He considerately closed the door for her.

As the engine started, he watched her tense profile in the rearview mirror.

An awkward silence filled the car.

Anna looked down, scrolling through her phone.

She pretended to handle work messages.

But her fingertips trembled slightly.

Lucas turned the steering wheel.

His gentle voice broke the silence.

"My company is nearby."

"It's on my way. Don't worry about it."

Anna forced a weak smile.

Her gaze swept over the passing scenery outside.

This route was completely opposite.

But she didn't point it out.

When the office building came into view, she immediately grabbed her seatbelt.

"Just stop here."

"I'll walk the rest of the way."

Lucas instead pressed the accelerator.

"The sun is too strong along this stretch."

"It's better if I take you to the entrance."

Anna bit her lower lip.

She silently prayed not to run into that person.

The moment the car stopped, she pushed the door open and jumped out.

While hastily thanking him, her peripheral vision caught a familiar figure.

Adrian Sinclair was emerging from the revolving door.

His tailored suit couldn't conceal his menacing aura.

He narrowed his eyes, assessing them.

His leather shoes clicked against the marble floor as he approached.

Anna froze in place.

She watched as his shadow fell over her.

Lucas suddenly stepped in front of her.

His voice carried a chill.

"What do you think you're doing?"

Adrian curled his lip contemptuously.

"I should be asking you that."

"Who gave you permission to touch what's mine?"

Anna pressed her throbbing temples.

She quickly stepped between the two men.

"Lucas, you should go."

"Thank you for today, really."

She grabbed Adrian's sleeve and dragged him toward the lobby.

Noah Watson followed silently, holding files.

The elevator doors closed.

She immediately released his sleeve.

"I'm just your Executive Assistant."

"My personal life is none of your business."

The metal walls reflected her red-rimmed eyes.

"This level of control is suffocating."
###Chapter 140

Adrian Sinclair's eyes darkened.

He stared intently at her.

Rage churned within him.

Before he could speak.

She was already rushing to deny any connection.

Noah Watson's documents suddenly slipped from his hands.

He bent down hurriedly to pick them up.

Adrian shot him a cold glance.

"Didn't eat?"

"Can't even hold papers properly."

Noah apologized repeatedly.

He quickly retreated to a corner.

Muttering about his bad luck.

Today was just not his day.

He had caught the boss in a terrible mood.

Adrian glanced at Anna Ross.

Her expression remained calm and unreadable.

His anger flared.

He motioned for Noah.

"Investigate Lucas Evans."

"Yes, Mr. Sinclair."

Noah turned to leave.

But was called back.

"Your reactions are slow."

"Dissatisfied with your job?"

Noah had no response.

The boss was venting his frustrations on him.

It was tough being an employee.

He looked toward Anna.

Hoping she would intervene.

Anna remained oblivious.

She was still upset herself.

She spoke sharply.

"Stop bullying people."

Noah closed his eyes.

This was worse.

He shouldn't have hoped.

The office tension thickened.

Chloe Valentine pushed the door open.

"Adrian, what are you all discussing?"

She walked over to Adrian's side.

Adrian gave her a indifferent look.

"Work matters."

Anna signaled to Noah.

Trying to slip away quietly.

But a cold voice stopped her.

"Stay where you are."

Anna glared at him.

But she stopped walking.

Chloe wrapped her arms around his neck.

Smiling sweetly.

"Adrian, my parents are in New York."

"They want to see you."

"Let's have dinner tonight."

Adrian removed her hands.

He walked behind his desk and sat down.

"I'm busy."

"No time."

His gaze swept over Anna.

Seeing her lack of reaction.

He felt a secret relief.

Chloe noticed his glance.

She felt annoyed.

But maintained her gentle demeanor.

"Adrian, I know it's difficult."

"But Grandpa said."

"You would definitely come."

She sighed softly.

Appearing very understanding.

"If you really can't make it."

"I'll explain to Grandpa."

Anger flashed in Adrian's eyes.

But he suppressed it quickly.

He looked up at her.

A slight smile touched his lips.

"It's just dinner."

"I'll go with you."

"No need to bother Grandpa."
###Chapter 141

Adrian gave a confirming nod.

A smug smile touched Chloe Valentine's lips.

She twirled a strand of her hair idly.

"Don't worry, Adrian," she said softly.

"I know how to handle Grandpa."

His distant demeanor still felt like a thorn in her heart.

Without Frederick Lowell's backing, he probably wouldn't even glance her way.

But it didn't matter.

Once they were married, everything of his would belong to her.

Anna Ross stood to the side.

A sharp, aching pain spread through her chest.

So they had already reached the stage of meeting the family.

The wedding must be soon.

She knew she had no right to ask.

Yet a suffocating feeling washed over her.

It was like a waterlogged sponge, blocking her airways.

"Mr. Sinclair, Director Valentine," she said, forcing professionalism.

"I have work to attend to."

"Please excuse me."

She practically fled the office.

Adrian's gaze followed her out.

His palm was damp with sweat.

He was actually nervous.

A self-mocking smile touched his lips.

He turned to Chloe.

His voice was cold. "Since dinner is settled."

"Return to your work."

Chloe bit her lip in frustration.

He wouldn't even pretend for her.

"Adrian, I just want to spend more time with you," she cooed, swaying closer.

He gave her a frosty look.

"It's business hours."

"Maintain professionalism."

She stopped, displeased.

Noah Watson averted his eyes, pretending to be invisible.

"Fine, I'll go work," she said, suppressing her anger.

"Remember to pick me up later."

Getting no response, she stormed out, slamming the door.

Anna was reviewing documents outside.

Chloe's anger flared.

But she quickly replaced it with a triumphant smile.

She deliberately raised her voice.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

"Adrian and I are getting married soon."

"Make sure you do your job properly during this time."

"Don't mess anything up."

Anna's hand stilled on the file.

She hadn't expected a direct challenge.

Closing the file, she looked up with a professional smile.

"Don't worry, Miss Valentine."

"I will perform my duties diligently."

"Congratulations to you both."

Chloe snorted at her calm demeanor.

She strode away in her high heels.

Anna watched her leave and sighed softly.

Her gaze drifted unconsciously toward the office.

They were really getting married.

But she was just an executive assistant.

These matters had nothing to do with her.

She buried herself in work.

Soon, Adrian summoned her.

She rose and entered his office.

A file was tossed in front of her.

His voice was devoid of warmth.

"The company has secured a major new project."

"Chloe is leading it."

"She specifically requested your assistance."
###Chapter 142

Anna Ross frowned deeply.

She picked up the document and glanced at it.

Her tone was cold. "I don't want to go. Can I refuse?"

She only wanted to focus on her own work.

She had no interest in participating in anything else.

Adrian Sinclair seemed to have expected this.

His expression remained unchanged.

He spoke slowly and deliberately. "No."

"Although you are my Executive Assistant,"

"these matters are crucial for the company's development."

"You have no valid reason to refuse."

He paused briefly.

Then he added, "You just joined the company."

"This is the time to prove yourself."

"Do well. Don't embarrass me."

After speaking, he lowered his head.

He continued handling the work on his desk.

Anna shot him an annoyed glare.

She turned to leave the office.

His voice suddenly came from behind her. "By the way,"

"do you know how to get to the Creative Department?"

Anna was speechless.

If she didn't even know that,

her time working here would have been wasted.

Was he treating her like a fool?

She ignored his question.

She went straight to her desk to get her things.

She headed directly to the Creative Department.

She wandered around the Creative Department for a while.

She couldn't see Chloe Valentine anywhere.

She wasn't familiar with this area.

She also didn't have her own workstation here.

She could only wait in the office.

"This proposal can be kept."

After waiting for some time,

conversation could be heard outside the door.

Anna looked up.

Chloe seemed to have just finished a meeting.

She showed a meaningful smile when she saw Anna.

She first dismissed the people around her.

She walked over with a smile. "Executive Assistant Ross."

"I thought Adrian wouldn't have the heart to let you come."

Hearing her prickly tone,

Anna felt uncomfortable.

But for the sake of work, she held back.

She asked softly, "What do you need me to do?"

She saw that there were plenty of people here.

She really couldn't understand why she specifically had to be called.

Especially using the excuse of being short-handed.

Chloe looked around.

She said with a smile, "Why don't you clean the office first?"

"Thank you."

After speaking, she sat down at her desk.

She started looking at her computer.

Anna glanced around.

The office was clearly already very clean.

And this was definitely not part of her job.

She immediately understood.

Chloe called her here just to humiliate her.

"Director Valentine,"

"This is not within my job scope."

"If there's no actual work,"

"I'll head back first."

She spoke without subservience or arrogance.

She prepared to leave.

Surprise flashed in Chloe's eyes.

She didn't expect Anna to have such backbone.

She was seething with hatred inside.

But she was afraid Anna would go back and complain.

She had to suppress her anger.

She stood up and grabbed Anna's arm.

Her tone softened. "Executive Assistant Ross,"

"I was too busy earlier and forgot."

"Please don't mind."

"How about this,"

"Help me verify the information in this proposal."

Anna also didn't want to cause trouble.

She nodded and agreed.

She sat down at another spot in the office.

She carefully verified the information.

When it was time to get off work,

Chloe didn't cause any more trouble.

She directly let Anna leave.

Anna stretched lazily.

Even though she had been very resistant before,

it seemed pretty good now.

She walked with light steps.

She had just left the Creative Department,

when she ran into Adrian Sinclair walking towards her.
###Chapter 143

Their eyes met.

Both froze in place.

The surrounding noise instantly faded.

Anna Ross quickly lowered her gaze.

He must be here to pick up Chloe Valentine for dinner.

She decided to ignore him and walk away silently.

She had only taken two steps when Adrian Sinclair called out to her.

"Adjusting well to your new position?" His voice was cold, his gaze sidelong.

Anna turned back, her tone defiant. "No need for your concern, Mr. Sinclair. I'm perfectly fine."

He was the one who forcibly transferred her here. His feigned concern was meaningless.

She finished speaking and tried to leave.

Her wrist was caught in a firm grip.

Adrian frowned slightly. "What's with the attitude?"

Anna struggled hard, but it was useless.

Her irritation grew.

A dull ache had settled in her chest ever since she heard about their engagement.

Seeing him only made it worse.

She looked up, meeting his eyes directly. Her voice was cool. "Please maintain your distance, Mr. Sinclair. This is the office. If Ms. Valentine sees, it could cause misunderstandings. You wouldn't want that affecting your relationship, would you?"

Adrian was taken aback.

Anna seized the chance to break free and walked away quickly.

He watched her retreating figure, pondering her words. A slow smile curved his lips.

Was she jealous?

"Adrian, what's so fascinating?" Chloe Valentine walked out, following his gaze but seeing nothing.

Adrian wiped the smile from his face. "Nothing. Just waiting for you. Let's go."

Chloe happily linked her arm with his.

They took a car to a private room in the restaurant.

Chloe's parents had been waiting for some time.

The round table was laden with exquisite dishes.

Seeing Adrian enter, the couple immediately stood up.

Harold Valentine smiled warmly. "Adrian, you're here. Please, have a seat."

Lydia Valentine smiled gracefully, every inch the sophisticated socialite.

Adrian gave a slight nod. "Uncle. Aunt."

Harold beamed, waiting for Adrian to sit before taking his own seat.

Chloe moved to lean happily against Adrian, but a look from her mother stopped her.

"I've long heard of the remarkable young Mr. Sinclair. Seeing you today, the reputation is well-deserved." Harold raised his glass in a toast.

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted. "You flatter me, Uncle."

He tipped his head back and drained his glass as a sign of respect.
###Chapter 144

Adrian Sinclair agreed without hesitation.

Lydia and Harold Valentine exchanged a satisfied glance.

Lydia softened her voice further. "Since this is a meeting between families, why didn't you invite your grandpa?"

She calculated silently. If the Sinclair elder was present, they could finalize the engagement tonight.

Adrian's lips curved into a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Grandpa hasn't been feeling well lately. He's resting at home."

He saw through her intention immediately. If his grandfather were here, this dinner would turn into an engagement party.

Harold sighed with regret, then smiled again. "No matter. We'll have plenty of opportunities to meet him later. Tonight is about getting to know you. Chloe talks about you constantly."

He looked at his daughter with affection.

Chloe's cheeks flushed pink. "Dad!"

Adrian gave a faint smile but didn't respond. He swirled the wine in his glass slowly.

Harold quickly urged everyone to start eating.

Meanwhile, the bar was bathed in dim, hazy light.

Anna Ross took the stage right on time.

The crowd below surged forward. The owner said most customers came specifically for her.

Many chanted her name. "Anna Ross! Anna Ross!"

She usually interacted with the audience. Tonight, an inexplicable restlessness gripped her.

The cheers felt like needles piercing her ears.

During her break, she retreated backstage alone to drink water.

The owner entered and studied her for a moment. "Anna, you seem off tonight. Is something bothering you?"

Anna set down her water bottle and shook her head. "I'm fine."

The owner frowned slightly. Anna was her star performer. Countless customers came just to see her.

Competitors were eyeing her greedily. She couldn't afford any problems.

She patted Anna's shoulder. "If you need help, just ask. I'll do what I can."

She added, "You've been performing exceptionally well lately. I'm giving you a raise."

Anna was surprised but thanked her softly. "Thank you. I'll get myself together."

The owner left, reassured.

Anna rubbed her temples. She didn't understand her own feelings.

Her mind was filled with images of Adrian meeting Chloe's parents.

How was it going for them right now?

She took a deep breath, forcing herself to stop overthinking.

After a few more sips of water, she returned to the stage.

A few more songs, and her shift would be over.
###Chapter 145
Anna Ross stepped onto the stage, the spotlight illuminating her face.

Cheers erupted from the audience in waves.

She took a deep breath, pushing aside distracting thoughts.

In the crowd, Lucas Evans held a bouquet, his gaze following her tenderly.

He lowered his head to adjust the flowers, a smile playing on his lips.

This bouquet was carefully selected, each bloom perfectly open.

Anna's clear, moving voice filled The Royal Lounge.

As her performance ended, she gave a slight bow and prepared to exit.

Lucas suddenly walked toward the stage with the flowers.

The bar fell silent instantly.

Every eye focused on them.

Anna froze, watching Lucas approach step by step.

"For you." Lucas extended the bouquet. "You sang beautifully."

Anna opened her mouth but no sound came out.

The audience began cheering, applause and whistles rising around them.

"Everyone's watching," Lucas murmured. "Save face for me."

Anna finally accepted the bouquet with a quiet "Thank you."

The bouquet felt heavy in her unsteady hands.

Lucas beamed, eyes brightened with joy.

Just then, Mia Lawrence arrived at the bar.

Her eyes widened in disbelief at the scene.

"Anna Ross!" she gasped involuntarily.

Anna's cheeks burned as she quickly pulled Lucas offstage.

The three moved backstage with Mia following closely.

"When did you two get together?" Mia asked bluntly.

Anna wished the ground would swallow her.

"Don't say nonsense," she whispered urgently.

Lucas simply smiled without explanation.

Anna hastily introduced them.

Mia studied Lucas while shaking his hand.

"Let me treat you to dinner," Lucas suggested.

Mia cheered immediately. "Perfect! I'm starving."

Anna followed them out of the bar helplessly.

At the restaurant, Mia chattered endlessly about office gossip.

Lucas listened quietly, smiling occasionally.

Anna picked at her food, her mind wandering elsewhere.

After dinner, Lucas insisted on driving them home.

In the car, Mia continued her excited chatter.

Anna gazed out the window, fingers unconsciously tracing the petals.

Night deepened as streetlights streamed past the window.
###Chapter 146

The car stopped slowly at the entrance of the residential area.

Anna Ross glanced at the bouquet on the passenger seat.

After a moment of hesitation, she reached out and picked it up.

Lucas Evans leaned over to unbuckle her seatbelt.

"Remember to close your windows tonight," he said gently.

She thanked him softly.

Then she pushed the door open and got out of the car.

Mia Lawrence was already waiting by the roadside.

She immediately rushed over, her eyes sparkling.

"Confess everything!" she demanded. "You two are definitely not just classmates!"

Anna walked ahead, holding the bouquet and looking down.

"Really, we're just classmates," she said, her voice tired. "At most, we're just good friends."

Mia clearly didn't believe her.

She chased after Anna, pressing for answers. "Would a regular classmate give you roses? Treat you to a fancy dinner? Drive you home personally?"

She lowered her voice. "I saw everything just now."

"The way he looks at you could drown someone in affection."

"He obviously likes you!"

Anna stopped walking.

How could she not understand all this?

But her life was a tangled mess right now.

Her mother was still waiting for her to earn money for their rescue.

Adrian Sinclair made things difficult for her at every turn.

She didn't even have a moment to catch her breath.

Let alone consider matters of the heart.

Besides.

She simply wasn't worthy of Lucas's affection.

It seemed she needed to keep her distance from now on.

It was the responsible thing to do for both of them.

She shook off these distracting thoughts.

Grabbing her best friend's hand, she said, "Stop guessing wildly."

"Right now, I just want to earn money and take Mom away from here."

Their figures gradually lengthened under the streetlights.

Mia pouted in complaint. "You're such a blockhead."

"A high-quality man like him isn't common."

"What if someone snatches him away one day?"

"You'll regret it when it's too late."

Anna's expression remained calm. "That would be even better."

"I'm in no state of mind to think about these things right now."

Her life was already complicated enough.

Mia touched her face. "I just want you to be happy."

"If you like him, don't let him slip away."

"I don't want to see you full of regrets in the future."

Anna listened silently to her best friend's words.

They finally reached the fork in the road.

Mia hugged her reluctantly.

Then she turned and walked toward her own apartment building.

Anna returned to her apartment alone.

Sophia Roscente was already asleep.

She had just put down her bag.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

The moment she saw the caller ID, her heart tightened sharply.

She quickly answered the call. "Mom?"

"What's wrong?"

Suppressed sobs came from the other end of the line.

Vivian Lowell's voice trembled. "Anna..."
###Chapter 147

Her mother's muffled sobs came through the phone.

Anna Ross's heart tightened.

Her fingertips turned white from gripping the phone.

Had Howard Lowell hit her again?

She took a deep breath.

Her voice trembled. "Mom, did he hurt you again?"

Silence lingered on the other end.

Sobs came in broken bursts.

Vivian Lowell choked out, "No... It's the San Francisco branch. It's under sudden investigation."

Anna relaxed slightly.

But then she frowned.

Trouble at the branch?

Adrian Sinclair had never mentioned this.

Vivian's voice was tearful. "Your father suspects Adrian did this... Anna, can you help him?"

Anna clenched the phone.

She had no desire to help that man.

But her mother was still in his grasp.

She had no choice.

"Put him on the phone."

Howard soon took the phone.

His voice was icy. "You heard? You must fix this for me."

Disgust flashed in Anna's eyes.

He always used her mother to threaten her.

"I can help you."

Her voice was calm. "But you must promise not to harm a single hair on my mother's head."

Howard paused.

He glanced at Vivian beside him.

He suddenly laughed. "Of course. I promise."

Vivian quickly interjected. "Anna, your father treats me very well. You must help us!"

Anna heard the anxiety in her mother's voice.

A sharp pain pierced her heart.

If Howard fell from power.

Those debts would crush them instantly.

She had no ability to repay them now.

"Mom, don't worry."

She agreed softly. "I will help him."
###Chapter 148

Howard Lowell smiled widely when she agreed.

He handed the phone back to Vivian Lowell and left the room.

Vivian held the phone, her fingers trembling slightly.

Her daughter had borne too much weight for her sake.

"Mom, it's getting late. You should rest." Anna Ross's worried voice came through the phone.

Though relieved her mother was safe for now, Anna's heart remained heavy.

She didn't know how to bring this up with Adrian Sinclair.

She wasn't confident she could persuade him to help.

Vivian offered a few gentle reminders before ending the call.

Anna let out a long sigh.

She wished she could be like an ostrich, burying her head in the sand when trouble came.

But reality never gave her a chance to escape.

No matter how difficult, she had to face each challenge one by one.

This was her fate.

She pulled up Adrian's number, her finger hovering over the call button.

She suddenly remembered the conversation she overheard during the day.

He was probably having dinner with Chloe Valentine right now.

She shouldn't disturb him.

Anna slowly put her phone down.

The branch company issue was internal corporate affairs.

Howard had never mentioned any details to her.

She didn't know what exactly went wrong.

But if headquarters was getting involved, it must be serious.

He must have done something he shouldn't have.

Thinking of this, she didn't want to help him anymore.

She was just an Executive Assistant. What right did she have to interfere?

The urge to retreat felt stronger than ever.

But reality always jolted her awake.

If she didn't help Howard, what would happen to her mother?

These thoughts tore at her nerves relentlessly.

Her head felt like it was about to explode.

Anna tossed her phone aside, deciding to take a shower to calm down.

Since it wasn't a good time to talk now, she would wait until work tomorrow to discuss it in person.

The hot water washed over her, easing her tense nerves slightly.

But when she lay in bed, sleep wouldn't come.

The thought of having to ask Adrian made her heart race.

She tossed and turned until dawn finally broke, managing only a fitful doze.

She woke up with dark circles under her eyes.

She applied layers of foundation, barely covering the traces.

She arrived early to wait at the company entrance.

As start time approached, there was still no sign of him.

Anna had no choice but to return to the office first.

Sitting at her desk, she worked restlessly.

Her palms were constantly damp with cold sweat.

After waiting a long time and still not seeing him, she couldn't help but go find Noah Watson.

"Noah, is Mr. Sinclair not coming to the office today?"

Noah glanced at her, slightly surprised.

"That's right. Mr. Sinclair has business to attend to today. He won't be in."
###Chapter 149

Anna Ross frowned.

Her fingers tapped the desk.

"Where did he go?"

Noah Watson stopped with files in his arms.

"Mr. Sinclair is on a sudden business trip."

Anna's heart sank.

"When will he be back?"

Her voice sounded urgent.

Noah shook his head. "The exact schedule isn't clear."

He studied her. "Is it something urgent?"

Anna pressed her lips together.

She didn't want to trouble anyone else.

"It's nothing."

She forced a smile. "I'll just wait for him."

Noah nodded and left.

Anna returned to her workstation.

She felt restless.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

She grabbed it immediately.

It was a message from Howard Lowell.

[How are things progressing?]

[Don't try anything.]

[I have your mother.]

Anna closed her eyes.

Her fingertips turned cold.

She took a deep breath.

Replied: [Working on it.]

The message was read.

No response came.

She bit her lip.

Found Adrian Sinclair's number.

Dialed it.

No one answered.

Tried again.

Still busy tone.

Anna gripped her phone.

Her knuckles turned white.

She sent a text.

[Need to speak with you urgently.]

[Please call back when you see this.]

Time passed.

No response.

She stared at the screen.

Anxiety deepened in her eyes.

Howard sent another message.

[Don't stall.]

[My patience is limited.]

Anna's fingers trembled.

Replied: [Already trying to reach him.]

[Don't hurt my mother.]

Message sent.

It vanished without a trace.

Meanwhile.

Adrian Sinclair sat in the meeting room.

Across from him were Grandpa Lowell and Mr. Valentine.

He looked calm.

A slight smile on his lips.

His phone was on silent in his pocket.

It vibrated again and again.

He remained completely unaware.
###Chapter 150

Last night, he had politely declined the Valentines, citing his grandfather's poor health.

This morning, the Valentines personally paid a visit.

This family was indeed not simple.

"Grandpa, we must return home today."

"We specifically asked Adrian to bring us to see you and say goodbye."

Harold Valentine beamed with delight, his words polite and considerate.

Grandpa laughed heartily, his voice robust.

"It just so happens I've been feeling a bit unwell these past two days."

"It's very thoughtful of you to make this special trip."

Harold immediately showed concern.

"Are you feeling better now? Health is the most important thing."

A glint of shrewdness flashed in his eyes.

He had thought Adrian's excuse last night was merely a brush-off.

He hadn't expected Grandpa to actually be ill.

"Much better. It's just a cold, nothing to worry about."

Grandpa's tone was calm.

A servant quietly approached, refilling the tea several times.

Chloe Valentine's gaze remained fixed on Adrian Sinclair.

Lydia Valentine observed her daughter's demeanor closely.

She knew her daughter was deeply in love with Adrian.

No matter what, she had to make this marriage happen.

Adrian ignored the intense stare.

He stood up calmly.

"Please excuse me. I need to use the restroom."

Everyone on the sofa smiled and watched him leave.

Chloe noticed the phone he had left on the coffee table.

It was vibrating insistently.

She glanced in the direction he had gone.

Unable to resist, she picked up the phone to check.

With just one look, her heart sank to the pit of her stomach.

Clutching the phone tightly, she stepped aside to answer it.

"Executive Assistant Ross, do you need something from Adrian?"

Her voice was sickeningly sweet.

Anna Ross felt a surge of joy when the call connected.

She was about to speak but was cut off by that familiar female voice.

She was momentarily speechless.

So he had skipped work today to be with Chloe Valentine.

Hearing her silence, Chloe curled her lips in contempt.

She feigned regret in her tone.

"You can tell me if there's something."

"He's busy right now. We're discussing our wedding plans."

She deliberately left things ambiguous, inviting speculation.

Anna understood immediately.

She said softly, "I see. It's nothing then."

"Congratulations to you both."

"I'll hang up now."

After the call ended, she sat alone for a long time.

Logically, she should be relieved to hear about his impending marriage.

This way, he would stop bothering her.

So why did she feel no happiness at all?

Instead, a faint, sharp pain pricked at her heart.

Chloe looked at the ended call and snorted disdainfully.

She quickly deleted all records of the incoming call.

After completing this, she returned the phone to its original spot.

No one would ever know.

Adrian happened to return from the restroom.

Lydia seized the opportunity, her face wreathed in smiles.

"I think we should formalize Adrian and Chloe's engagement first."

"To settle this matter and put our minds at ease."

She repeatedly shot meaningful glances at her husband.

Harold quickly agreed.

"Yes, they are so well-suited. I'm sure they both look forward to marrying soon."

Well-suited?

Adrian was utterly impressed by their ability to speak so freely.

Where exactly did they see him and Chloe Valentine being well-suited?

His gaze swept over Chloe, who was lost in her blissful fantasy.

Just as he was about to speak, Grandpa stopped him with a look.

"The two of them haven't known each other for very long."

"Marriage is a serious matter. It shouldn't be rushed."

"It's better to let their relationship develop naturally."

Grandpa said gravely.

Adrian was somewhat surprised.

His grandfather, who had always urged him to marry, would say such a thing now.
###Chapter 151

The Valentine parents were equally surprised.

Lydia Valentine glanced at her daughter with shifting eyes.

Chloe Valentine bit her lip hard, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Grandpa had always doted on her.

She could clearly feel that favoritism.

So why did he tactfully reject the marriage at this critical moment?

Even though her heart was in turmoil, she didn't dare show it.

She knew better than to offend the old man.

She quickly put on a gentle smile.

"Grandpa is right," she said softly. "I'm really not in a hurry right now."

"Adrian is very career-driven."

"I'm willing to wait until he's more settled before we consider marriage."

Grandpa nodded approvingly, thinking the girl knew her place.

Adrian Sinclair glanced at her sideways.

His deep, unfathomable eyes showed no emotion.

Chloe grew nervous under his gaze, afraid he might detect something.

Seeing this, the Valentine parents didn't press further.

The Valentine and Lowell families were old friends.

The marriage would happen eventually—it was only a matter of time.

"Then we'll wait a bit longer," Harold Valentine said cheerfully, smoothing things over.

"The children's happiness is what matters most."

"We elders fully support them."

Grandpa said no more, taking a sip of his tea.

"Since you're here, stay for a meal."

Harold gladly agreed.

Their return tickets were for evening, so there was plenty of time.

After the banquet, it was already late.

"Time together always passes so quickly," Mr. Valentine said with emotion. "We should be going now."

"Take care of your health, Grandpa."

Grandpa Lowell smiled kindly.

"Travel safely," he said, then turned to Adrian beside him. "See them off."

Adrian gave a slight nod.

Henry immediately stepped forward to support the old man.

In the car, Harold tried to make small talk, but Adrian showed little interest.

Arriving at the station, Mr. Valentine spoke solemnly.

"Adrian, Chloe is unfamiliar here in New York."

"Please look after her."

Adrian glanced at the figure not far away and responded indifferently, "I will."

Chloe was holding her mother's arm, saying reluctant goodbyes.

Lydia lowered her voice to advise, "Hurry and secure him. Nothing else matters."

Chloe shyly glanced at that tall, straight-backed figure.

"Don't worry, Mom," she said firmly. "He will be my husband."

Lydia nodded with satisfaction.

Harold checked the time.

"It's time to go in."

Chloe released her mother's arm and watched her parents pass through the ticket gate.

Adrian turned and walked away immediately.

Chloe hurried to catch up, afraid of being left behind.

Back in the car, she noticed Adrian checking his phone.

She felt secretly relieved that she had already deleted the call records.

He frowned slightly, his gaze fixed on a message from Anna Ross sent early that morning.

After a long moment, he spoke coldly.

"Stop the car."

The tires screeched against the pavement as the car jerked to a halt by the roadside.
###Chapter 152

Chloe Valentine looked at him with confusion. "Adrian, what's wrong?"

"Something urgent came up. I'll have the driver take you home." He gave a brief explanation and pushed the door open to get out.

She grabbed his wrist, her eyes reddening. "Can't you take me home first? What's so urgent..."

Adrian Sinclair's expression remained cold, but his voice softened slightly. "Don't be difficult. It's really important."

He pulled his hand away and closed the car door.

Chloe stared at the shut door, her nails digging deeply into her palms.

Adrian sped back to the company, only to find Anna Ross's workstation already empty.

He stood still, his heart tightening inexplicably.

If she really had something urgent to tell him...
If he missed it...

He didn't dare think further. Turning around, he rushed downstairs and headed straight to the bar where she performed.

The owner approached with an eager smile. "Sir, may I—"

"Is Anna Ross here?" He cut her off, his gaze urgently scanning the stage.

The owner understood. Another person looking for Anna Ross.

She shook her head regretfully. "Unfortunately, she took the day off. But if you'd like to see her, you can come back tomorrow..."

Before she could finish, the man had already turned and left, leaving behind a cold shadow.

The owner muttered, "Why is everyone in such a hurry lately..."

Adrian leaned against his car, dialing her number repeatedly.

No answer.

He clenched his phone, his knuckles turning white.

...

Anna Ross was walking slowly along the lake.

Her phone vibrated in her pocket, that name flashing across the screen.

Her fingers trembled, almost answering.

But Chloe's words from earlier echoed suddenly—
"He's going to marry me."

A sharp pain pierced her heart.
She closed her eyes, letting the ringtone sound again and again until it finally fell silent.

Passersby cast curious glances, but she remained oblivious.

Adrian stepped on the accelerator, his speed skyrocketing.
He let out a cold laugh, but anxiety churned in his eyes.

Was she always this good at tormenting him?

He parked the car outside her apartment building.
He was about to go upstairs when he ran into Anna returning home.

Both froze simultaneously.
Their eyes met.
The air suddenly solidified.
###Chapter 153

Why is he here?

The thought flashed through her mind.

Did he come here specifically to find her?

Anna Ross’s heart tightened, followed by an inexplicable flutter of excitement.

She couldn’t explain where this sudden joy came from.

Adrian Sinclair strode closer, his expression cold, anger simmering in his eyes.

He looked down at her, his voice icy. "Why didn't you answer my calls?"

An overwhelming pressure washed over her.

Anna instinctively felt afraid, worried he might lose his temper right there.

But then she remembered he hadn't answered her calls either. Anger instantly flared.

She met his gaze defiantly, her tone stiff. "I didn't hear it. My phone was on silent. It's not my fault."

His cold laugh cut through the quiet night.

It sent a chill down her spine.

His long fingers tapped lightly on his screen.

Her phone immediately rang from inside her bag.

The sound abruptly shattered the silence.

"Your lying skills are improving, Executive Assistant Ross." He suppressed his anger, his gaze sharp as a blade. "The phone wasn't on silent, was it?"

This woman was getting bolder.

Openly defying him.

She simply didn't take him seriously.

It seemed he had been too lenient with her lately.

Knowing she was in the wrong, Anna lowered her eyes, not daring to meet his gaze.

Didn't she even have the freedom to not answer a call?

Even though she was cursing his tyranny internally, she didn't dare show it on the surface.

Since their reunion, his excessive actions were still vivid in her memory.

She really didn't dare provoke this devil lightly.

"No explanation?" Adrian crossed his arms, his gaze intense.

Stung by his look, Anna decided to drop the pretense. "I just didn't want to answer. No reason!"

He was the one who didn't answer first.

He let Chloe Valentine say those things.

Why should she have to endure it?

Battling the sting in her eyes, she poured out everything she had held back all day. "Weren't you busy with your engagement? Too busy to even answer my call. How could I dare disturb you? I know my place."

"Also, my sincere congratulations to you and Miss Valentine."

After saying all this, she finally felt a little relief.

But the ache in her nose grew stronger.

The emotions she had suppressed all day were on the verge of overflowing.

She wasn't the one who did anything wrong.

Why did she have to bear all this?

Adrian hadn't expected her to harbor so much resentment. He was momentarily stunned.

After a moment of silence, he suddenly realized something.

How did she know his schedule?

And why did she say he didn't answer?

But he never saw any missed calls from her.

Had someone tampered with his phone?

His anger gradually subsided, and his expression softened.

He asked in a low voice, "What was so urgent today?"

It was unexpected that someone who usually avoided him would reach out主动.

This was truly surprising.

Anna stiffened, her breath catching.

The anger from moments ago faded, leaving only awkwardness.

But she knew very well she shouldn't dwell on this now.

Saving her mother was the top priority.
###Chapter 154

The San Francisco branch was suddenly under investigation.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she asked the question softly.

"Was it you?"

Adrian Sinclair's gaze paused, then he admitted frankly.

"It was me."

He stood with his hands in his pockets, his figure tall and straight.

"The branch is full of loopholes. If we don't investigate now, it will collapse sooner or later."

Anna Ross bit her lower lip.

A plea shimmered in her eyes.

"Can you stop?"

She remembered her mother's pale face.

Howard Lowell's threats hung over her heart like a blade.

Every argument was stained with the scent of blood.

Adrian's Adam's apple moved.

His voice was low and hoarse.

"What identity are you using to beg me?"

She froze.

Executive Assistant? Ex-girlfriend?

Both seemed ridiculous.

The light fell on his sharply defined face.

She turned her face away, hiding her embarrassment.

Her fingertips dug into her palms.

"What you said before..."

She took a deep breath.

"About me being your mistress. Is that offer still valid?"

His eyes darkened instantly.

"Always valid."

"I accept."

She closed her eyes, her voice trembling.

"On one condition—stop the investigation."

The air solidified.

He watched her in silence.

As if trying to see through her soul.

"Why?"

He finally spoke.

His voice carried an unbelievable coldness.

The person who would rather die than submit before.

Was now voluntarily stepping into a cage.

He couldn't understand her.
###Chapter 155

Anna Ross suppressed the shame churning inside her.
Her voice was cold and clear. "I want to help Howard Lowell. Please stop the investigation."

Her fingers clenched tightly.
Her nails dug deep into her palms.

The pain came, but she was already numb.

Adrian Sinclair let out a derisive laugh.
He shot her an incredulous glance. "For him? You'd go this far?" He turned his head away, his jawline tense.

Anna remained silent, her gaze unwavering.

"He's never been good to you," Adrian's voice was laced with suppressed anger. "Is it worth it?" He found it bitterly ironic. He had used every means to tempt her, and she never yielded. Yet now she was lowering her head for the man who hurt her.

How laughable.
Why was she doing this?

Seeing his slightly raised brow, Anna's heart trembled.
She just wanted to hide herself away, wrapped up tightly like a cocoon.
But she couldn't.

Once dignity is discarded, it can never be reclaimed.

"Does what you said still count?" Her eyes were dim, losing their luster in the night. "Or do you want to go back on your word?"

Adrian's voice rose. "Tell me, why?" Helping that kind of person was simply not worth it.

Why?
Anna was stunned. She didn't want to either, but she had no choice. "He's my stepfather. It's only right that I help him. I agree to be your mistress, as long as you let him go."

Adrian laughed at himself mockingly. "But I don't want that anymore." He fought back his anger, watching her degrade herself for that man. It made his chest feel tight and uncomfortable.

If it were someone else, would she do the same?

The surroundings were silent, with only the faint chirping of insects in the grass.
The two stood in a stalemate.
Anna loosened her clenched hands and stepped forward lightly.
She reached out and wrapped her arms around him.

"Please," her voice choked with sobs. "I'll do anything you want. Just please let him go."

Adrian frowned deeply, looking down at the pleading figure in his arms, his face dark.

He didn't react.
Anna closed her eyes, stood on her toes, and kissed his lips.
A tear slid down from the corner of her eye.
His lips were still cold.

These were things he had once forced upon her.
Now she was doing them主动ly. Would he agree?

Adrian's pupils constricted sharply.
He pushed her away forcefully.
Looking at the stranger before him, his heart ached with a sharp pain.
If it was only for Howard Lowell, she didn't need to go this far.

"Enough," he said coldly, and turned to leave.

Anna staggered from the push.
She couldn't let him leave.
This was her only chance.
###Chapter 156

"Don't go!"

Tears welled in her eyes as she wrapped her arms tightly around him from behind.

Her cheek pressed helplessly against his broad back.

Her voice choked with emotion. "I'm begging you. Just agree to this one thing for me. Please?"

"Begging me?"

Adrian Sinclair stood with his back to her, his expression unreadable.

"I said I don't need this."

He applied force with his hands, pushing her away.

Anna Ross staggered back, nearly losing her balance.

He instinctively started to turn and catch her.

But another figure was quicker to shield that slender form.

Lucas Evans steadied her, positioning himself between them.

Adrian slowly retracted his hand, left hanging in the air.

His gaze turned icy as he watched the two before him.

Lucas ensured she was secure before rounding on Adrian.

He shoved him back hard. "What gives you the right to treat her like this?"

"Just because you were together once, you think you can bully her however you want?"

Adrian's eyes grew colder. He remained silent.

He tried to check on Anna, but Lucas completely blocked his view.

Only then did he realize he had used too much force earlier.

Lucas ignored him, turning urgently to Anna. "Are you hurt?"

Thank goodness he had arrived in time.

He dreaded to think what might have happened otherwise.

Now he finally understood why she was so afraid of Adrian.

This man was utterly cold and heartless.

Lucas's heart ached for her. He silently vowed to protect her.

He would never give Adrian another chance to hurt her.

"Lucas, what are you doing here?" Anna regained her composure, looking at him in surprise.

She couldn't understand his sudden appearance.

Then she remembered Adrian was still there.

He had warned her against associating with Lucas.

Her heart pounded as she stepped back, deliberately creating distance.

But Lucas closed the gap. "Anna, I came specifically to see you."

"Good thing I did. Who knows what he might have done to you."

He glared daggers at Adrian.

He found the other man watching them with an impassive expression.

Beneath that calm gaze lay a depth of icy coldness.

It sent an inexplicable chill down Lucas's spine.

Anna met Adrian's gaze and flinched away as if shocked.

She spoke softly. "Lucas, it's late. You should go back."

"Anna, don't be afraid of him. I'm here. He won't dare do anything." Lucas shielded her behind him, guarding her like a precious treasure.

Anna sighed inwardly.

His intentions were good, but he didn't realize he was ruining her plan.

Right now, getting Adrian's agreement was all that mattered.

She had already sacrificed her dignity. Nothing else was important.

"Lucas, I said you don't need to stay here." Her voice turned cold as she deliberately stepped back to Adrian's side.

She refused to look at him again.

Lucas stared at her in confusion.

Her icy attitude instantly pushed him a thousand miles away.
###Chapter 157

Lucas Evans stared at her intently, his voice trembling.

"Anna, tell me the truth."

"Did he force you into this?"

"If you just say the word, I can help you!"

He refused to believe she would treat him this way.

It had to be Adrian Sinclair's doing, pulling strings from the shadows.

Lucas shot a furious glare at the man.

Anna Ross frowned.

She had made herself perfectly clear.

Why was he still refusing to leave?

This wasn't like the Lucas she knew.

What was he trying to prove?

She wasn't worth this kind of devotion.

Her life was already a complete mess.

She had no right to drag anyone else down with her.

Both men's eyes were fixed on her.

They were like two predators staring down their prey.

A single word from her would unleash a vicious fight.

"Lucas, no one is threatening me."

"No one is forcing me."

"I simply want you to leave."

"These are my honest feelings."

She couldn't bear to look at his expression.

But this situation needed to end.

Letting this conflict with Adrian continue would only hurt Lucas.

Adrian raised an eyebrow, a mocking smile playing on his lips.

She would truly do anything for that so-called stepfather.

Lucas was stunned for a moment, then his resolve hardened even further.

"I'm not leaving."

"I know you're saying these things to protect me."

"But this time, I want to be brave."

"Let me protect you."

"I can't stand to see him hurt you, not even a little bit."

He had seen the fear in her eyes, clear as day.

No matter how harsh her words were, he wouldn't abandon her.

He couldn't leave her here alone.

He had already missed too many chances in the past.

This time, he had to seize the opportunity.

He would protect the girl he loved with his own hands.

Adrian watched with his arms crossed, finding the drama increasingly entertaining.

"Lucas, how many times must I say it?"

"This has nothing to do with you."

"My problems are not your concern."

"Stop being so presumptuous, alright?"

Anna's face was pale.

Under the streetlights, her skin looked almost translucent.

Her cold, heartless expression pierced Lucas's heart.

His voice choked with emotion. "Anna..."

He just wanted to keep her safe.

Was she really going to deny him even that chance?

Anna gave him a cold glance. "You won't leave?"

"Then I will."

She grabbed Adrian's hand and turned to leave.

Her heart ached just as much.

She knew she was wronging Lucas.

But she had no other choice.

"Is he really that important to you?" Adrian's voice was low, laced with sarcasm.

"He's my stepfather."

"I have no choice."

"Hmph."

Adrian let out a cold laugh.

Stepfather?

Just a man with no blood relation.

Besides, that man had never treated her well.

Why go to such extremes for him?

They reached the car, and Anna released his hand.

Her voice was muffled. "Mr. Sinclair, let's discuss this somewhere else."

"You choose the place. Anywhere is fine."
###Chapter 158

Silence fell all around.

The air stood still for a moment.

He suddenly chuckled lowly. "Anywhere will do? You're that desperate to sell yourself out for him?"

He admitted he had selfish motives.

But seeing her like this.

He'd rather not have it.

"I don't accept the terms you just offered."

"I don't like things that are handed to me on a silver platter."

He gave her a deep look.

"You'd better think carefully about whether this is really worth it."

The black Mercedes sped away, leaving a cloud of dust.

Its taillights vanished into the night.

Worth it?

Anna Ross stared at the empty street.

Bitterness spread through her chest.

As long as it could save her mother.

To her, there was no question of worth.

It was simply something that had to be done.

But now, even this last hope was shattered.

She couldn't imagine how to face her mother.

Her legs suddenly went weak.

The world spun around her.

She could no longer hold on.

She collapsed heavily onto the cold ground.

The chill seeped through the fabric into her skin.

But she seemed to have lost all sensation.

"Anna!"

Lucas Evans rushed over quickly.

He reached out to help her up.

Anna pushed him away sharply.

"My business is none of your concern."

"Why do you always have to meddle?"

Lucas knelt before her.

His figure was as steadfast as a rock.

"I can't leave."

"I can't just stand by and watch you like this."

His voice trembled.

"I can't bear to."

Anna froze.

A tear silently slid from the corner of her eye.

What had she done to deserve this?

Why was he treating her this way?

"Lucas."

She took a deep breath.

"I know how you feel."

"But it's impossible for us."

"The me now is no longer the Anna from university."

"I'm not worth this."

"Stay away from me from now on."

She could offer him no response.

It was better to let him give up early.

Lucas smiled bitterly.

"Anna, my feelings for you were never less than Adrian Sinclair's."

"He just got there first."

"He took the person I cherished most."

"Even if I have all these feelings."

"I can only bury them in my heart."

The past played vividly in his mind.

He could no longer suppress the surging emotions.

He gripped her shoulders.

His gaze was almost pleading.

"Give me a chance, okay?"

"I don't care what you've become."

"I've always liked you."

"As long as it's you, anything is fine."

His grip on her shoulders was painfully tight.

Anna frowned slightly.

She hadn't expected Lucas to be this persistent.

But she truly couldn't respond.

She slowly stood up.

Freeing herself from his grasp.

"I said it's impossible."

"Don't look for me anymore."

She didn't dare to look at him.

Perhaps out of guilt.

Or perhaps afraid to see the cruelty of hurting someone who truly cared.

She was already covered in wounds.

She didn't deserve his pure feelings.

The night was silent.

Lucas watched her resolute retreating figure.

He suddenly laughed.

The smile was uglier than crying.

She had rejected him after all.

She always said she wasn't good enough.

But he never cared about that.

All he wanted was a chance.

But she wouldn't even grant him that small hope.
###Chapter 159

The commercial street teemed with crowds.

Neon lights flashed incessantly.

Their colorful glow illuminated the faces of passersby.

Adrian Sinclair drove at high speed.

The night etched his profile in sharp relief.

Light and shadow interplayed, defining his features.

He jerked the steering wheel.

The car turned sharply in the opposite direction.

It quickly left the bustling district behind.

The vehicle gradually merged into the darkness.

A screech of brakes pierced the silence.

The car came to a smooth stop by the river.

A cool breeze brushed against his face.

His gaze fell on the pack of cigarettes in the passenger seat.

He finally grabbed them and got out.

The river surface was calm and still.

The lighter flared to life.

The scent of tobacco quickly filled the air.

It made his eyes water and squint.

Yet his mind was unusually clear.

Images of Anna Ross's pleading face flooded his thoughts.

It was a level of humility he had never seen from her.

"Anna Ross."

"For someone insignificant."

"You'd throw away your dignity?"

He leaned against the railing, murmuring to himself.

A lighthouse beam swept across the water.

A sudden realization struck him.

This wasn't like her.

Unless she was truly desperate.

He immediately pulled out his phone.

He dialed Noah Watson's number.

"Look into something."

"Make sure no one notices."

He hung up and stared into the distance.

The neon lights continued to flash.

His phone vibrated incessantly again.

He frowned at the caller ID.

With a flick of his finger.

He tossed the phone back into the car.

The ringing persisted.

Chloe Valentine gripped her phone tightly.

The unanswered call fueled her anger.

"He must be with Anna Ross!"

She hurled the phone across the room.

She vented her fury by smashing nearby objects.

But her rage only grew hotter.

The thought of their intimacy tormented her.

She nearly ground her teeth to dust.

"This cannot continue!"

She retrieved her phone and made a call.

Her voice trembled with fake tears the moment it connected.

"Mom, Adrian is being stolen from me!"

Lydia Valentine hurried to comfort her.

"Calm down, tell me what happened."

Chloe's sense of injustice doubled.

"He's with his Executive Assistant all day."

"He won't even answer my calls now!"

A sharp glint flashed in Lydia's eyes.

"Don't panic, silly child."

"Staying calm is how you win."
###Chapter 160

Chloe Valentine stomped her foot in frustration.

But after calming down, she realized her mother's words made sense.

She bit her lip unwillingly. "Mom, what should I do to make him change his mind?"

Lydia Valentine sighed softly and took her daughter's hand. "You're usually so clever. Why are you being so dense now?"

"You need to keep Adrian Sinclair steady."

"As for that little Executive Assistant..." A shrewd glint flashed in her eyes. "Find a way to make her leave the company."

"If they never see each other, they won't have a chance to develop feelings."

"Right!" Chloe's eyes lit up, and a smile spread across her lips. "Mom, help me think of a plan. I don't want to see her for one more day!"

She admired her newly done crystal manicure.

But her gaze was as cold as ice.

Anna Ross, this time I will make sure you disappear from his sight forever.

Meanwhile, Anna Ross dragged her heavy feet back home.

She felt completely drained, even her emotions had gone numb.

Sophia Roscente was curled on the couch, eating snacks and watching a series.

Hearing the door open, she immediately jumped up. "You're back! Look at the snacks I bought. They're all your favorites!"

Anna glanced at the snack bags piled on the coffee table.

She just nodded faintly, showing no reaction.

Sophia noticed something was wrong and moved closer with concern. "What's wrong? You look upset."

They sat on the sofa together.

Anna leaned against the cushion like a lifeless doll, not moving at all.

Sophia immediately guessed the reason.

She puffed her cheeks indignantly. "Did my brother make you angry again? He has such low emotional intelligence. Don't take it to heart."

Anna was slightly stunned by her words.

Sophia handed her a bag of chips and lowered her voice mysteriously. "Let me tell you a secret."

"Don't be fooled by how cold he acts now. He was in a relationship during college."

She watched Anna's expression carefully before continuing. "After the breakup, he completely fell apart."

"It was like he couldn't live without that girl. He locked himself in his room all day. He wouldn't eat, drink, or speak."

Anna's fingers trembled.

She never realized she had hurt him so deeply back then.

It was her fault...

"How... how did he eventually move on?" she asked softly.

Sophia chuckled. "He never moved on! It became his biggest obsession."

She gave Anna a meaningful glance. "It takes the one who tied the knot to untie it. Probably only you can help him let go."

"What?" Anna looked up sharply.

What did that mean?

Did Sophia already know she was that person from his past?

But she had never revealed any clues.

How could Sophia know?

Sophia continued eating snacks nonchalantly, contrasting sharply with Anna's shocked expression.

"I've never been in a relationship, but I understand this much."

Anna clenched the corner of her clothes.

Finally, she asked the question swirling in her mind. "Did... did he tell you?"
###Chapter 161

Sophia Roscente blinked, crunching a potato chip in her mouth.

"He would never tell me. I figured it out myself."

"Figured it out?" Anna Ross clenched her fingers.

Was it really that obvious between them?

Sophia swallowed her snack, her voice crisp.

"The first time I saw you, something felt off. There was this strange vibe between you and my cousin."

She leaned closer to Anna, lowering her voice.

"Now I'm one hundred percent sure. You're his first love."

Anna lowered her gaze.

So it had been a test from the very beginning.

Sophia waved a finger.

"Don't space out. It's simple."

She suddenly turned serious.

"If you still like my cousin, you need to hurry."

Anna looked up.

Sophia spoke earnestly.

"His family arranged a marriage for him. I heard it's going well."

Anna shot to her feet.

Howard Lowell's threat echoed in her ears.

If Adrian Sinclair really married someone else...

She rushed into her room and grabbed her phone, dialing her mother.

The busy tone rang continuously.

Anna's heart beat faster and faster.

The call finally connected.

Anna spoke urgently.

"Mom, are you okay?"

Vivian Lowell's voice was gentle.

"Don't worry, I'm fine."

Anna sighed in relief.

Vivian asked softly.

"Anna, what's wrong? Are you doing alright in New York?"

Anna forced a smile.

"I miss you."

Vivian sighed.

"Mom misses you too. Any progress with the branch company?"

Anna's fingers tightened.

She remembered Adrian's cold profile.

"Don't worry, Mom." She heard her own voice say. "Mr. Sinclair has agreed to help."
###Chapter 162

She tried to sound calm, but her voice betrayed her unease.

Vivian Lowell noticed nothing amiss over the phone. She was simply delighted by the smooth progress. It seemed Adrian Sinclair did treat her daughter with special regard. This realization put Vivian's mind at ease.

"That's wonderful, Anna. Thank you for your hard work." Her mother's voice was filled with relief.

Anna Ross gripped her phone tightly. As long as her mother remained safe, any effort was worth it. As for the rejection, she believed she could try again.

After ending the call, she stared blankly at her phone screen. Her fingers hovered over the message box. She typed and deleted several drafts, but ultimately sent nothing.

She recalled his firm refusal yesterday. Her courage instantly evaporated. Perhaps she shouldn't invite further humiliation.

Finally, she deleted all the text and tossed her phone aside. Her eyelids grew heavy. She fell into a deep sleep without even pulling up the covers.

Sophia Roscente entered the room and found her curled up asleep by the bed. The phone screen was still lit, displaying the chat window with Adrian Sinclair.

"Still claiming you don't care..." Sophia chuckled softly and shook her head. She turned off the phone and carefully tucked Anna in.

The bedroom lights went out, leaving only moonlight streaming through the window.

The next morning, Anna was jolted awake by an urgent ringtone. Her mother's cheerful voice came through the receiver. "Anna, the branch company crisis is resolved! It's all thanks to you!"

Anna sat up instantly, all sleepiness gone. "Mom, say that again?"

"Everything is settled. It's truly wonderful." Vivian repeated, her tone light and happy.

Anna held the phone in a daze. She had just been rejected last night. Why was there a sudden turn of events? Who else could influence this matter besides him?

But why did he change his mind?

"I need to get to work. I'll contact you later." She hurriedly ended the call and threw off the covers. Morning light streamed through the curtains, illuminating the entire room.
###Chapter 163

Vivian sensed the urgency in her tone and ended the call without further questions.

Anna quickly got ready and hurried to the company.

She planned to find an opportunity to ask Adrian later.

As she entered the company lobby, a sharp voice called out from behind.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

She turned and saw Chloe Valentine smiling as she approached.

Anna instinctively wanted to avoid her, but remembering she now reported to Chloe, she stopped.

"Executive Assistant Ross, don't forget you're under my supervision now."

Chloe pressed the elevator button for the Creative Department.

She stood beside Anna with an air of superiority.

Anna offered a polite smile.

"I'm aware."

She could feel Chloe's hostility.

It was uncomfortable.

Even though she knew they were getting married soon, her position felt awkward.

Chloe gave her a dismissive glance and stepped into the elevator.

After yesterday's incident, she had fully declared Anna her enemy.

If not for Anna, Adrian would have married her already.

Anna felt her gaze but chose to ignore it.

She stood quietly in the corner.

They maintained a silent understanding.

Entering the office, Chloe tossed her bag onto the sofa.

She pointed at the mountain of documents on the desk.

"These need to be delivered to Manager Klein."

"Also, revise these files thoroughly."

"Review all submitted proposals and select the suitable ones."

She finished in one breath and leisurely sat in her chair.

Seeing Anna unmoved, she grew irritated.

"Why aren't you moving? There's also a presentation PPT that must be completed by this morning."

Anna looked at the assigned tasks and smirked inwardly.

This was clearly deliberate mistreatment.

She asked, "Am I doing all of this alone?"

Chloe lazily looked up. "Of course you are."

Anna didn't start working. Instead, she countered, "If I recall correctly, these should be the Director's responsibilities."

"Of course, if you're incapable, I can assist."

Someone happened to enter and overheard, glancing surprised at Chloe.

Chloe gritted her teeth in anger. This was an obvious jab at her incompetence.

But with others present, she had to concede. "Of course not. I'll handle these."

After finishing yesterday's tasks, Anna planned to find Adrian.

As she reached the Creative Department entrance, Howard's call came through.

Frowning, she walked to the stairwell to answer. "The branch company issue is resolved. What more do you want?"

She cautiously checked her surroundings, worried about being overheard.

Howard's scheming voice replied, "I know about that. You did well."

"But you seem to have forgotten another matter."

"I told you to sabotage Adrian and Miss Valentine's marriage, yet they're getting married soon."

Anna's expression tightened. She hadn't expected him to remember.

Helpless, she said, "Their marriage was arranged by Grandpa. Nothing I do will change that!"

Her fingers clenched, hoping Howard would drop it.
###Chapter 164

A cold threat came through the phone. "You dare to disobey me? You don't care about your mother's safety anymore?"

"You!" Anna Ross trembled with rage.

Howard Lowell chuckled triumphantly. "Don't think I haven't noticed. That young man is particularly taken with you. With a little effort on your part, he'll be completely wrapped around your finger!"

She knew exactly what he was after. He simply wanted to use her to control Adrian Sinclair.

"I can't do it," she said, her voice shaking. "What makes you so sure he feels differently about me? I suggest you abandon this idea now."

Howard exploded in fury. "Fine! Since you refuse to cooperate, don't blame me for what happens to your mother!"

"Don't touch my mom!" she cried out, her voice breaking. "I'll do it... I'll try my best."

"That's more like it. Remember your promise. Otherwise..." Howard ended the call with a cold laugh.

Anna leaned weakly against the wall. She would do anything to keep her mother safe.

She took a deep breath, steadied herself, and turned to leave the hallway.

She immediately collided with a solid chest.

Her head snapped up, meeting Adrian Sinclair's intense gaze.

"When did you get here?" Her voice was tight, afraid he might have overheard the call.

The air froze instantly. Even the sound of the wind seemed amplified.

Adrian studied her flustered expression. She looked so guilty. Had she been doing something behind his back?

Seeing his silence, Anna bit her lower lip gently. "Thank you for the branch company matter. Since you've kept your word, I will honor my promise as well."

Her cheeks flushed, though it was unclear if it was from embarrassment or fear.

"What promise?" He raised an eyebrow, leaning closer, taking in every subtle reaction.

She looked like a startled fawn, making him want to tease her.

He knew it might be a trap, yet he found himself willingly walking into it. He even felt the urge to touch her flushed cheek.

His eyes darkened. He hadn't originally planned to let the branch company off the hook. But seeing her helpless expression, he had softened.

Anna lifted her gaze and slowly moved closer. Her slender arms wrapped around his neck, her eyes shimmering with tenderness.

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. He narrowed his eyes dangerously. "I didn't expect such initiative from my Executive Assistant, Anna." He wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her into his embrace.

Anna trembled slightly but maintained a charming smile. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Chloe Valentine approaching from a distance.
###Chapter 165

Chloe Valentine scanned the area, searching for Adrian Sinclair.

She spotted the two of them standing together.

A throbbing pulse began at her temples.

Her teeth ground together audibly.

Her eyes locked onto Anna Ross with lethal intensity.

It felt as if she could tear her to pieces.

How dare she try to steal her man.

The audacity was unbelievable.

She nearly charged forward to rip that face apart.

But as she lifted her foot, her mother's warning echoed in her mind.

She couldn't act impulsively now.

It would only push Adrian further away.

A calculated glint flashed in her eyes.

She slowly halted her steps.

A new idea began to form.

There was no need to rush.

She had all the time in the world to play this game.

Chloe adjusted her expression.

A sweet smile returned to her face.

She approached with graceful steps.

Feigning surprise, she spoke.

"Adrian, what are you two doing here?"

Adrian's gaze flickered slightly.

He remained silent.

His grip on Anna's hand didn't loosen in the slightest.

Anna glared at him, furious.

She tried to pull away.

But it was useless.

He was absolutely doing this on purpose.

Chloe noticed their joined hands.

Disgust flashed in her eyes.

But she masked it quickly.

She skillfully maneuvered between them.

Her right hand subtly pushed Anna aside.

She positioned herself next to Adrian.

Deliberately creating a barrier between them.

Adrian casually slipped his hand back into his pocket.

His eyes still lingered on Anna.

His tone was calm.

"Executive Assistant Ross nearly fell just now. I steadied her."

Anna shot him an indignant look.

She was impressed by how effortlessly he lied.

Chloe caught that subtle expression.

She fought the urge to strangle the other woman.

She forced a dry laugh.

"Is that so? The company floors can be slippery. You should be more careful, Executive Assistant Ross."

Anna gave a slight nod.

"Thank you, Mr. Sinclair. I have work to attend to. I'll take my leave. Please continue your conversation."

She turned and walked away.

Internally relieved.

Her objective was achieved.

There was no need to stay any longer.

After she left, Chloe looked up to speak to Adrian.

But she found his gaze still following that retreating figure.

A sharp pain pierced her heart.

She forced a smile.

Maintaining her usual sweet demeanor.

She gently shook his arm, coquettishly.

"Adrian, I came here specifically to see you. Why won't you even look at me?"

Adrian finally looked down at her.

His tone was flat.

"There's a lot happening at the company. I don't have time."

Chloe gritted her teeth.

This was clearly an excuse.

She feigned hesitation, lowering her head.

"Adrian, there's something I'm not sure if I should mention. It's about Executive Assistant Ross."

"What is it?" he responded immediately.

Seeing his instant concern, her heart ached with bitterness.

But her voice was filled with feigned pity.

"It seems she's having a hard time financially. I heard she has to work at a bar every night. I'm not sure what exactly she does there, but it seems quite pitiful."

Noticing his darkening expression, she felt a secret thrill.

She sighed dramatically.

"But she is very pretty. She must be quite popular at the bar. Do you think... maybe she's already under some sort of sugar arrangement?"

She exaggeratedly covered her mouth.

Her eyes intently watched for any change in his expression.
###Chapter 166

The air froze instantly.

Chloe Valentine felt a surge of satisfaction.

He should despise Anna Ross completely now.

The man spoke abruptly. "Noah Watson called. An urgent meeting came up. I must leave."

Adrian Sinclair released her hand and walked away without looking back.

"Adrian!" Chloe stumbled, bracing herself against the wall to steady herself.

His figure had already vanished.

She stamped her foot in frustration.

Anna Ross must be expelled from the company.

She stormed back to her office and gulped down a glass of water.

Her gaze fell on the documents on her desk. A ruthless glint flashed in her eyes.

She snatched the file and smirked. "Since you're asking for trouble, don't blame me for being merciless."

Anna returned to her temporary workstation, feeling uneasy.

Did he see through her deliberate act earlier?

He was so perceptive. Had he already noticed?

She regretted her boldness.

Fortunately, he didn't press further.

Otherwise, escaping Chloe's scrutiny would have been harder.

Judging by his reaction, he probably hadn't overheard her conversation with Howard Lowell.

Smack!

Documents slammed onto her desk.

Chloe stood over her, arms crossed. "These are the project files. Contact the clients."

Anna jumped in surprise.

She picked up the documents. "You want me to contact them?"

Wasn't that the responsibility of the project lead?

"Yes, you handle it. I have more important matters. No time for this." Chloe examined her manicure, feigning nonchalance. "These are core documents. They must not be leaked. The consequences would be severe. Understood?"

Entrusting such crucial work to her?

Chloe was giving up a chance to claim credit?

Anna was reluctant, but they had already clashed before.

She was only here to assist. It was better not to push too hard.

She accepted the documents and replied calmly, "Alright. I'll handle it carefully."

Chloe raised an eyebrow in surprise.

No suspicion at all?

Perhaps she wasn't that clever after all.

Chloe scoffed lightly and patted Anna's shoulder. "Do well. You might get a promotion and raise if you succeed."

She covered her mouth and laughed.

Anna took it as a normal comment and didn't overthink it.

"Is there anything else, Director Valentine? It's work hours. I need to focus."

Chloe's expression stiffened.

Was she being dismissed?

Let her enjoy these few days.

Her suffering would come soon.

The thought alone was satisfying.

Chloe laughed heartily. "Nothing else. Get to work."

Watching her leave, Anna breathed a sigh of relief.
###Chapter 167

Anna Ross felt uneasy whenever she saw Chloe Valentine now.

It was guilt, really.

She didn't know how to face Chloe.

She just hoped all this would end soon.

Then she could take her mother and leave this place.

Anna shook her head firmly, forcing herself to focus.

She threw herself back into her work.

The office was a cacophony of keyboard clicks, phone rings, and murmured conversations.

She was unusually absorbed today.

She even lost track of time, forgetting it was the end of the workday.

A colleague from the next desk tapped her gently.

"Still here? Working overtime?"

Anna snapped back to reality.

She looked up at the clock. She was already half an hour late.

She smiled quickly. "No, I just lost track of time. Thanks."

The colleague waved dismissively. "No problem. Whoever loves overtime can stay. I'm out of here!"

"Bye."

Anna watched as her colleagues left one after another.

She quickly packed her things.

Her gaze fell on the documents on her desk.

She remembered Chloe's instructions from this morning.

She opened her drawer and carefully put them away.

Then she turned off the lights and left.

Just outside the company's main entrance.

She spotted Adrian Sinclair leaning against his car.

Anna's breath hitched.

Why was he here again?

She instinctively turned to take a detour.

But Adrian had already seen her.

"Anna Ross."

His voice was quiet, yet it carried an undeniable force.

Her feet froze on the spot.

She listened as his footsteps drew closer.

Adrian stepped directly in front of her.

His shadow completely enveloped her.

Anna had to look up.

She forced a smile. "Mr. Sinclair, is there something you need?"

She quickly added, "It's after work hours. I have some personal matters..."

She tried to sidestep him and slip away.

Adrian didn't move. He spoke calmly.

"Poor memory, Executive Assistant Ross? The branch company matter. The evidence is still with me."

She stiffened instantly.

Unable to take another step.

Anna slowly turned back to face him.

Her expression blank. "I haven't forgotten. What do you need, Mr. Sinclair?"

Adrian raised an eyebrow, studying her.

"Is that your attitude? Not very sincere."

He tapped his finger lightly, his gaze darkening.

Anna gritted her teeth secretly.

She forced another obedient smile.

"I understand. What would you like me to do, Mr. Sinclair?"

Adrian thought for a moment.

A slight smile touched his lips. "Have dinner with me."

Anna was stunned.

That was it?

But she immediately remembered she had to work at the bar tonight.

There simply wasn't enough time.
###Chapter 168

"I need to go to work at the bar now." Anna Ross looked up at him. "Why don't you come to the bar and wait for me to finish my shift? I'll go to dinner with you after."

Her gaze held a cautious hope.

If he insisted she go with him immediately, she truly wouldn't know how to respond.

Adrian Sinclair remained silent for a long time.

Her heart gradually sank. "Or you could head back first? I'll come find you right after my shift."

"No need." He finally spoke. "I'll go with you to the bar."

He turned to get the car.

Anna's eyes lit up. She quickly pulled open the passenger door and got in.

She hadn't expected him to agree so easily.

He seemed different from before.

The entrance to The Royal Lounge was brilliantly lit.

The owner recognized Adrian immediately. "Well, look who it is! Our honored guest! Anna is performing tonight. Let me show you in!"

She led the way with excessive eagerness.

Adrian followed with an expressionless face.

Anna was already on stage.

The crowd below cheered incessantly.

Someone excitedly commented, "She's finally here! I didn't see her yesterday. I was heartbroken!"

Another nodded vigorously. "I come every day just to see her! If only she could be my girlfriend!"

Adrian shot a cold glance at the two men.

The owner seated him at the best table before leaving.

He sat alone on the plush sofa.

Stage lights enveloped Anna, casting a hazy veil around her.

Watching that familiar face, the corner of his lips lifted slightly.

Everything seemed to have changed.

Yet everything felt exactly the same.

"Handsome, are you here alone?" A coquettish voice suddenly sounded.

A strong wave of perfume hit him.

Adrian frowned in disgust. "Get lost if you value your life."

The woman was frightened by his glare. She hurried away.

Anna happened to witness the entire exchange.

Her eyelashes fluttered. A secret flicker of joy stirred deep within her.

After her shift, she主动 took Adrian's arm. "Let's go. Dinner is on me."

Her smile made him falter for a second.

It felt like they were back in their university days.

Inside the restaurant, she ordered all his favorite dishes.

They waited in comfortable silence.

Adrian's eyes rested on her. "Does Howard Lowell have something on you?"

Anna looked up.

He continued. "I can't think of any other reason you'd sell yourself out like this."

"...No." She lowered her head, playing with her fork and knife. "It's just because we're family now."

He let out a light laugh. "I don't believe that."

Such a clumsy lie. Only she could say it with a straight face.
###Chapter 169

Anna Ross turned her face away.

"Believe what you want."

She clenched her fists.

Lying felt awful.

But she had no other choice.

Adrian Sinclair narrowed his eyes.

He didn't press further.

The server arrived with their food just then.

Anna let out a quiet sigh of relief.

She picked up her fork and knife.

As she glanced up, her movements froze.

Sophia Roscente?

And sitting right beside her was Marcus Hill.

Their posture was intimate.

Anna's heart skipped a beat.

She immediately looked at Adrian.

He was already following her line of sight.

"The food will get cold."

She quickly stood up, blocking his view.

She swiftly placed a piece of meat on his plate.

Adrian raised an eyebrow.

"What's this about, Executive Assistant Ross?"

He chuckled lightly.

He reached out to move her aside.

Anna inwardly groaned.

Her body was shifted away.

She could only close her eyes and pray.

The air suddenly grew tense.

Adrian's gaze turned icy cold.

He stared intently at the two.

Sophia was wiping Marcus's mouth.

Marcus was feeding her with a smile.

They were completely unaware.

Anna took a deep breath.

Those two were being far too conspicuous.

Adrian slammed his utensils down.

He stood up, ready to approach them.

Anna grabbed his arm.

"Don't be impulsive."

She said urgently.

"Maybe they're just having a normal meal."

He paused.

His fists clenched.

But he actually sat back down.

They both watched covertly.

Anna frowned.

She took out her phone to send a warning.

But then she saw Marcus pinch Sophia's cheek.

He leaned in, about to kiss her.

Adrian shot to his feet.

She hurried to stop him.

"Calm down!"

But he shoved her aside.

He strode over.

His expression dark.

How dare that pig mess with his precious cousin.

He was furious.

Marcus was about to kiss her.

Sophia shyly pushed him away.

"Not here..."

"People are watching..."
###Chapter 170

The moment she looked up and saw Adrian Sinclair, she was speechless.

Marcus Hill looked at her, puzzled, thinking she was just shy.
He smiled.
"A kiss on the cheek is normal."

He reached out to touch her, but Sophia Roscente pushed his hand away in a panic.
She stared ahead, flustered.
"C-Cousin, what are you doing here?"

Cousin?

Marcus froze, suddenly realizing what was happening.
He turned around sharply.
Adrian stood behind them, his presence intimidating, his eyes cold enough to kill.

He gasped.
"Adrian, let me explain!"

"Explain? You should." Adrian spoke through gritted teeth, suppressing his rage.
He sat down calmly, but everyone could feel the storm brewing.

Anna Ross arrived just then and sighed softly.
She stood to the side, hoping Marcus would survive this.

Sophia looked at her like a lifeline, her eyes pleading: Help me!

Marcus was completely stunned.
He never expected such bad luck—running into them just while having a meal.
He regretted choosing this restaurant.

As he remained silent, Adrian tapped the table impatiently.
His voice was low.
"Weren't you going to explain?"

"Adrian, well... we..." Marcus stammered.
Adrian's intensity was overwhelming.
Trying to flirt with his cousin right in front of him was a death wish.

Sophia took a deep breath and explained.
"Cousin, we were just having a meal together.
Back in San Francisco, you asked him to look after me.
This is my way of thanking him."

Seeing his cousin's naive expression, Adrian was furious.
He shot her a cold glare.
"Shut up!"

Sophia was frightened into silence.
She was truly afraid of her cousin.

"Marcus, you explain." Adrian turned his relentless gaze to the man hanging his head.

A bad feeling rose in Sophia's heart.
She quickly got up and went to Anna's side.
She whispered pleadingly, "Sis, please help me.
Say something!"

Only Anna could save them now.

Anna glanced hesitantly at the enraged Adrian.
She spoke slowly.
"They might really just be having a meal together.
Don't misunderstand."

"Yes, Cousin!" Sophia chimed in quickly.

Seeing Adrian show no reaction, Marcus gritted his teeth.
He decided to confess.
There was nothing wrong with dating.
He believed Adrian would understand.

Just as he was about to speak, Sophia covered his mouth and shook her head frantically.

Adrian's anger intensified.
He stared daggers at them.
"You'd better tell the truth!"

Sophia wanted to say more, but his warning glare silenced her.
Marcus pulled her hand away.
He cleared his throat and said firmly, "Sophia and I are together."
###Chapter 171

Silence fell.

The private room was dead quiet.

Sophia’s mind went blank.

She stared at Marcus Hill.

She couldn’t understand why he suddenly confessed.

He got to play the hero.

But what about her?

Adrian Sinclair slowly clapped.

His gaze was cold enough to freeze.

"Good friend."

"I asked you to look after her."

"Is this how you do it?"

He stood up and grabbed Marcus by the collar.

Marcus was lifted off his feet.

Anna Ross and Sophia were both stunned.

Neither knew how to react.

But Marcus showed no fear.

He only looked at Adrian with guilt.

"Adrian."

"I was wrong."

"But you can't control who you fall for."

"You should understand that."

He glanced meaningfully at Anna.

Adrian’s aura turned icy.

He stared coldly at Marcus.

"So that's why you hid it from me?"

He wanted to punch this guy.

Then throw him out of New York.

"I didn't mean to hide it."

"I just couldn't find the right time."

"Maybe it's better you found out."

Marcus actually sounded grievance.

Sophia saw things going south.

She rushed over and grabbed Adrian's arm.

"Cousin!"

"It's all my fault!"

"I told him not to tell you!"

"Be mad at me!"

She believed her cousin wouldn't really hurt her.

She could always sweet talk her way out.

Adrian let go.

He rubbed his temples.

His breathing was heavy.

He always treated her like a little sister.

He never thought she could cause so much trouble.

"You have the nerve to say that?"

"Sneaking back to the country is one thing."

"Now you're involved with my friend?"

He sighed无奈.

His lips pressed into a tight line.

"Wait till your mother finds out."

"See how you handle that!"

He almost shouted.

Sophia turned pale with fear.

Tears welled up in her eyes.

She looked at him pitifully.

"Cousin, I know I was wrong."

"Please don't tell my mom."

She rubbed her small hands together.

Like a kitten.

It was hard not to soften.

Anna felt sympathy for her.

But she also wanted to laugh.

This was Sophia's signature move.

No one could resist her when she coquetted.

It was too adorable.

She glanced at Adrian.

Sure enough.

His expression softened slightly.

But it was still gloomy and terrifying.

Adrian sat back down.

Sophia immediately went to massage his shoulders.

"Cousin."

"Think of how good I usually am."

"Please let me off this time."

"How many times have you said that?"

Sophia pouted.

"This time is different."

"If you don't want me to tell, confess to your mom yourself."

"She just called me two days ago."

"You don't want her to hear it from someone else, do you?"

Adrian gave her a sidelong glance.

His voice was cold.

Sophia nodded quickly.

"I'll confess!"

She smiled obediently.

Like a good child admitting fault.

Only she knew.

If she didn't agree.

This cold-blooded cousin would send her back immediately.

Then she would be in even bigger trouble.
###Chapter 172

Sophia Roscente felt quite pleased with herself.

But she forgot exactly who she was dealing with.

Adrian Sinclair saw right through her.

His voice turned icy. "I'll arrange for your mother to meet you."

"Time and place will be confirmed later."

"What!?" Sophia wailed.

The pillow in her hands dropped to the floor.

She plopped down next to Marcus Hill in a huff.

But one sharp look from Adrian made her jump up.

She quickly moved to sit beside Anna Ross instead.

The two men faced each other.

The air grew thick with tension.

Her plan had failed completely.

Sophia was fuming.

Suddenly, her eyes lit up.

She pulled Anna back a couple of steps.

Anna followed, confused.

Sophia leaned in and whispered urgently. "Sis, please save me."

"I'm too young and beautiful to die!"

Anna couldn't help but laugh at the dramatic phrase.

"You're laughing at me too?" Sophia pouted. "The world is so cruel!"

Anna gently patted her back. "Don't worry. It'll be fine."

"No, you have to help me, sis."

"Cousin listens to you the most!" Sophia clung to her hand like a lifeline.

Anna pressed her lips together, hesitant.

She could barely protect herself right now.

How could she possibly persuade Adrian?

Just then, both men stood up.

Sophia rushed over anxiously. "Where are you going?"

Marcus ruffled her hair. "Don't worry. We're just going outside to talk."

Adrian's gaze instantly frosted over.

Marcus quickly withdrew his hand.

He followed Adrian out.

Sophia looked desperately at Anna. "It's over."

"You don't think Cousin will hit him, do you?"

The thought of Adrian's methods made her shudder.

"They're good friends. They won't fight." Anna pulled her down to sit.

Sophia nodded blankly. "If they do, I hope Cousin goes easy on him."

A thought suddenly occurred to Anna.

She looked at Sophia curiously. "When did you two get together?"

"I live with you every day and didn't notice a thing!"

This was moving way too fast.

Last time they met, everything seemed normal.

How did they suddenly become a couple?
###Chapter 173

Sophia Roscente's cheeks flushed pink.

She looked down, fidgeting with the corner of her shirt.

"When feelings are right, you just end up together."

Her voice was soft and light, carrying the unique shyness of a young girl.

Anna Ross understood everything just by looking at her.

This girl had probably been involved with Marcus Hill for a while, only confessing now.

But children grow up. They always develop their own ideas.

"Alright, I won't tease you anymore." Anna smiled gently and walked over to sit on the sofa.

She had been standing and talking for too long. Her legs felt a bit numb.

Sophia pouted and scooted closer.

Her sister was so much easier to talk to.

Not like her cousin, always stern-faced and controlling.

Just thinking about Adrian Sinclair's cold demeanor made her angry.

She sat down next to Anna, grabbing her hand and shaking it.

"Sister, you have to put in a good word for me in front of my cousin."

"Best if you can make him stop meddling in my affairs. Otherwise, I'm really doomed!"

Anna shook her head helplessly.

This girl overestimated her influence.

"Sophia, it's not that I won't help you," she said softly.

"How could Adrian possibly listen to me? He meddles because he cares about you."

Her voice gradually trailed off towards the end.

There was a time when he had cherished her, holding her in the palm of his hand.

But now, things had changed. Everything was different, and nothing could go back to how it was.

Yet she had no regrets.

Even if given another chance, she would make the same choice.

"Sister, please help me!" Sophia pleaded earnestly, making a solemn promise.

"My cousin will definitely listen to you! As long as you speak, he will agree!"

Anna was amused by her.

The young girl had no idea about the history and grudges between them.

Seeing Anna's expression soften, Sophia pressed her advantage.

She put on a pitiful face.

"If my mom finds out about this, I'm dead. Sister, could you bear to see such a cute little treasure like me suffer?"

Anna couldn't help but laugh out loud.

Having this girl around certainly made life more lively.

But she was truly powerless to help.

In the past, perhaps she could have said a few words.

But now... she couldn't think of any reason why Adrian would listen to her.

。。。。。。。

Outside the restaurant.

Marcus Hill followed closely behind Adrian Sinclair, glancing back occasionally.

His friend was always cold and stern, but his anger now was especially intimidating.

Even Marcus felt a chill down his spine.

He really didn't know how Anna usually endured this cold severity.

Just thinking about it made his scalp prickle.

Lost in thought, Adrian suddenly stopped walking.

His sharp gaze swept over.

Marcus forced a dry laugh. "Adrian, between brothers, we don't need to be like this, right?"

If it really came to a fight, he definitely wouldn't fight back.

But remembering the intensity Adrian showed during workouts, his legs still felt weak.

Adrian's expression was cold and severe.

Seeing Marcus still grinning without any intention of giving a serious explanation, he let out a cold laugh.

"No one else is here now. Speak. What's going on?"

Marcus breathed a sigh of relief.

"I like Sophia. I was attracted to her back in San Francisco."

"I wanted to tell you earlier, but I never found the right opportunity."

He looked towards the lovely figure inside the restaurant, making a solemn promise.

"Adrian, I'm serious. I will treat her well. Otherwise, may I be struck by lightning!"

"Who asked you to swear?" Adrian interrupted impatiently.
###Chapter 174

No matter how he looked at it, Adrian felt like he'd gotten the short end of the stick.

His carefully protected little sister for all these years had been whisked away by his best friend.

Adrian couldn't help but click his tongue in disapproval, his brow furrowed. "What were you even thinking? That's my sister. How could you make a move on her?"

Marcus's ears burned with embarrassment. He had indeed developed feelings right under his friend's nose.

But thinking of the girl he loved, he mustered his courage. "I know I owe you an apology for this, but you share some blame too!"

Adrian shot him a cold glare.

"If you hadn't always asked me to look after her, we wouldn't have grown close over time."

"You!" Adrian was left speechless. It almost made sense, but it wasn't an excuse for Marcus to seize the opportunity.

Marcus quickly assured him, "Don't be angry. You know me better than anyone. I keep my word. I will treat her right."

Adrian glanced at him. Upon reflection, Marcus was indeed more reliable than some outsider.

Seeing how Sophia was utterly devoted to him made any further argument pointless.

His best friend becoming his brother-in-law gave him a headache just thinking about it.

He sighed, rubbing his forehead in resignation. "You'd better remember what you said. If you ever dare to hurt her, our friendship is over."

Seeing him relent, Marcus excitedly grabbed his hand. "You're the best, Adrian! I won't betray your trust!"

He thumped his chest in promise, grinning from ear to ear.

Adrian suppressed the urge to punch him, his voice cold. "Let go."

Two grown men pulling at each other was hardly appropriate.

Marcus immediately released his hand, still beaming. "Cousin, since we're family now, you'll put in a good word for me when I meet the parents, right?"

Cousin?

Adrian was stunned by his audacity. They weren't even at that stage yet.

"...Know your limits," he warned, his voice low.

Marcus, knowing not to push his luck, smiled and promised, "Don't worry, I know my boundaries. I won't overstep!"

Seeing his radiant smile, Adrian just wanted to roll his eyes. He couldn't be bothered to respond.

Through the glass, Sophia saw both men outside smiling. She poked Anna. "They seem to be getting along well. Let's go out and see!"

Anna smiled and nodded. Hand in hand, they walked outside.
###Chapter 175

Sophia Roscente hurried out the door.

Her anxious gaze immediately landed on Marcus Hill.

She instinctively moved to approach him.

But then she caught sight of Adrian Sinclair's stern profile.

Her step faltered, and she quietly withdrew.

Adrian's brow furrowed slightly.

A wave of helplessness washed over him.

He softened his tone. "Don't worry. I didn't lay a hand on him."

His cold eyes swept toward Marcus. "Remember your promise."

Sophia's eyes instantly lit up.

She looked at her cousin with delight. "You agreed?"

She happily linked her arm with Adrian's.

She pressed her cheek against his shoulder, cooing. "You're the best, cousin!"

Marcus stood to the side.

A flicker of jealousy passed through his eyes.

The girl had never been this affectionate with him.

Adrian clicked his tongue softly.

He pushed her head away. "Cut it out."

Sophia wasn't offended.

She smiled brightly and ran to Marcus's side.

She tightly grasped his hand.

Adrian watched his sister's radiant smile.

He felt suddenly dazed.

She looked genuinely happy.

He couldn't protect her forever.

It was better to let her pursue the life she wanted.

He turned around.

His eyes met Anna Ross's gaze.

Anna quickly wiped the smile from her face.

She looked away.

Sophia subtly shot her a look.

Anna understood.

She gently nudged the person beside her. "Let's not disturb them."

Adrian didn't respond.

Anna thought he disagreed.

She simply took his hand and pulled him aside.

Adrian looked down at their intertwined hands.

This was the second time she had initiated contact today.

A faint smile unconsciously touched his lips.

Anna suddenly stopped walking.

He quickly schooled his expression.

Anna panickily release his hand and apologized in a low voice. "I'm sorry."

She clutched the hem of his clothes in frustration.

She had been too rushed and forgot to maintain distance.

Adrian's voice was low. "Making decisions without me. Aren't you afraid I'll get angry?"

The night breeze brushed past, carrying his crisp scent.

Anna suppressed her pounding heart.

She explained softly, "I just thought—"

"Enough." He cut her off.

He walked straight toward the car door. "This ends here."

Anna stood still.

Her chest felt tight and suffocating.

He was always so unpredictable.

Maybe he found her flustered state amusing.

She took out her phone to call a ride.

The car window rolled down.

His impatient voice came through. "Get in the car."
###Chapter 176

Her fingers paused on the phone screen.

She finally canceled the ride-hailing order.

She opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.

As Anna Ross fastened her seatbelt, she glimpsed Adrian Sinclair's tense profile.

She knew further argument was pointless.

Silence filled the car.

She turned to watch the flowing nightscape outside.

Neon lights streaked long bands across the window.

If those things hadn't happened.

They would be very happy now.

Seeing others in pairs.

Always brought a fine, sharp pain to her heart.

But time would eventually heal everything.

The familiar outline of the residential area gradually came into view.

"Just stop here," Anna said softly.

The car pulled over smoothly.

She unbuckled her seatbelt. "Thank you for driving me back."

The sound of a car door opening came from behind.

Adrian stepped out with his long legs.

The streetlight stretched his shadow tall and slender.

It completely blocked her path.

"Aren't you going back?" she asked hesitantly.

He raised an eyebrow, studying her. "I'll walk you to your door."

His tone left no room for refusal.

Anna remembered the last unexpected incident.

Her fingertips tightened slightly.

But thinking Sophia Roscente could return anytime.

She felt somewhat reassured.

The elevator mirror reflected their figures standing side by side.

They reached the apartment door.

She turned, blocking the lock. "I'm here now."

Adrian leaned against the wall with a light laugh. "Aren't you going to invite me in for tea?"

She bit her lip and opened the door.

The moment she stepped into the foyer, she heard the lock click.

A man's炽热chest pressed against her from behind.

He pinned her against the cold door.

Her wrists were pulled above her head.

Breath smelling of alcohol brushed past her ear.

Anna looked up in panic. "What are you doing?"

"What lovers do," he whispered, biting her earlobe.

His bottomless eyes were darker than the night.

Unspoken exclamations were swallowed by hot kisses.

She struggled to turn her head away.

But he gripped her waist and pulled her back into his embrace.

"Don't move," he said, increasing pressure punitive.

Anna froze instantly.

Her long lashes trembled as she closed her eyes.

Letting him claim and conquer.

Familiar sensations made her gradually surrender.

Clumsy responses invited more intense demands.

Erratic breaths echoed through the living room.

He suddenly scooped her up horizontally.

Warm bedroom light outlined their ambiguous silhouettes.

She wrapped her arms around his neck, sinking into the mattress.

Shirt buttons popped off.

A cool palm caressed her trembling skin.

"Adrian..." Her voice choked with tears.

The man chuckled lowly, kissing her collarbone.

His fingertips trailed down her waistline.

He grasped her slender ankles and gently parted them.
###Chapter 177

"Anna, are you asleep? I wanted to say thank you..."

Sophia Roscente pushed the door open with a smile, then her eyes widened in shock.

She quickly covered her eyes.

"I'm sorry! I didn't see anything!"

Sophia turned and ran, rushing all the way back to her room.

She pounded her pillow in frustration.

Why did she have to walk in on that?

Of all things, her cousin's private moment.

This is bad.

He definitely won't let this go easily.

Sophia felt like crying.

The intimate atmosphere in the room was abruptly shattered.

Anna Ross pushed the person on top of her away and pulled the covers tightly around herself.

Her cheeks burned as she bit her lower lip hard.

She wished she could disappear into the floor.

Thankfully Sophia closed the door quickly.

Now it was just the two of them.

Adrian Sinclair adjusted his collar with a dark expression.

His cousin had perfect timing.

She showed up at the worst possible moment.

He cast a cold glance at the blanket-covered form on the bed.

"Stop hiding."

"Do you really think I'd do anything to you in front of her?"

Anna peeked out with half her face visible.

She immediately met his intense gaze.

She retreated back under the covers.

She didn't believe him.

This man was unpredictable. Who knew when he might suddenly go crazy?

Staying wrapped up was safest.

Footsteps suddenly approached.

Adrian had returned.

Anna shrank back in fear.

"What are you doing back!?"

Her voice trembled.

The man pulled the covers aside and dragged her forward.

His long fingers lifted her chin.

"If you agreed to be my mistress, stop trying to run away."

His voice was low, carrying an undeniable pressure.

Anna's heart pounded like a drum.

Even at a time like this, he was still thinking about that.

She lowered her lashes and whispered, "I understand."

Adrian released her, his expression softening slightly.

Anna quietly shifted toward the edge of the bed.

"You and Miss Valentine are getting married soon, right?"

"If she finds out about me, it probably wouldn't be appropriate."

Her voice was soft, carrying a bitterness she didn't even notice herself.

Adrian frowned.

"Who said anything about marriage?"

He studied her, curiosity in his eyes.

Anna looked up, meeting his gaze directly.

"That day I called you, Miss Valentine answered."

"She said you were discussing wedding plans."

"You let her answer on purpose, didn't you? To show me your marriage is approaching?"

The more she spoke, the more upset she felt. Her fingertips dug deeply into her palms.

Adrian paused for a moment.

Watching her jealous expression, he suddenly chuckled low.

So she could be jealous over him.
###Chapter 178

He sat on the edge of the bed.

The mattress dipped slightly.

Anna Ross immediately shifted away.

She deliberately created distance between them.

Her heart ached, but she wouldn't let him cross any boundaries.

Adrian Sinclair noticed her small movement.

His brows furrowed slightly.

But he was in a good mood and didn't mind her avoidance.

He watched her for a moment before speaking.

"I never planned to marry her."

"You don't need to overthink things."

Anna finally turned to look at him.

His eyes were sincere.

He didn't seem to be lying.

He always disdained lying.

So the wedding never existed.

Chloe Valentine had lied.

The gloom in her heart suddenly lifted.

A sliver of light broke through.

Adrian stood up to leave.

Anna followed him out of bed.

She intended to see him out.

In the living room, she glanced around.

She didn't see Sophia Roscente.

The bedroom door was tightly shut.

To avoid disturbing each other's routines, she had given Sophia her own room.

It now conveniently avoided awkwardness.

The earlier incident had left them both uncomfortable.

At the foyer, Adrian suddenly turned around.

She looked up, confused.

The corners of his lips lifted.

His eyes held a hint of amusement.

"If you have questions in the future, just ask me directly."

"Don't overthink things or get jealous on your own."

......

Before Anna could react, the door closed.

Only the cold door remained.

Her face flushed red to the tips of her ears.

She stomped her foot in frustration.

"Who's jealous! I'm not!"

She rushed to the sofa.

Her heart raced uncontrollably.

She felt like she was done for.

A few words had thrown her into disarray.

This was madness!

She opened the refrigerator.

She gulped down a bottle of cold water.

But thinking of his words, her heart still pounded.

He said he wouldn't marry Chloe Valentine.

Did he mean that?

The refrigerator door reflected her smiling face.

She hurriedly covered her mouth.

No, she wasn't happy.

It was just because she didn't have to deal with Howard Lowell anymore.

Yes, that had to be it!

She forced herself to calm down.

She sat back on the sofa.

The door next to her creaked open a crack.

A pair of large eyes cautiously peered out.

After confirming it was safe, Sophia slipped out.

Sophia suddenly sat down beside her.

Anna jumped in surprise.

"Is my cousin gone?"

Sophia ignored her startled reaction.

She asked cautiously.
###Chapter 179

Anna Ross nodded softly, her gaze evasive.

Sophia Roscente let out a long, deep breath.

She suddenly leaned in closer, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

"Someone once swore up and down that she didn't like my cousin."

She grinned like a cat that got the cream.

"And now you've reached this stage?"

Her fingertip gently poked Anna's slightly flushed cheek.

Anna opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

What existed between her and Adrian Sinclair was far from simple affection.

These complicated entanglements shouldn't taint this pure girl before her.

Sophia was currently enjoying the most beautiful love.

And herself?

A trace of bitterness rose in Anna's heart.

That purity had long since vanished.

"You've misunderstood."

She lowered her eyelids.

"Thank goodness you showed up when you did today."

She avoided the unanswerable question.

Even she couldn't see her own heart clearly.

"Thank me?"

Sophia suddenly covered her mouth.

Her eyes widened, as if she'd thought of something terrible.

"Don't tell me my cousin forced you!?"

Her face fell instantly.

"Oh no, oh no... He's definitely going to kill me!"

She pouted, twisting her fingers together.

"I never should have come back..."

"I never should have looked for you at that moment..."

"Not even locking the door... I'm so dead..."

Anna forced a weak smile.

Shouldn't she be the one who's troubled?

"Anna, you and he—"

Sophia tried to press further.

Anna gently cut her off.

"Sophia, it's very late."

She rubbed her temples.

"I'm tired. I'm going to rest now."

"You should get some sleep too."

The door closed softly.

Sophia stared at the shut door, finally falling quiet.

Anna leaned against the door, her heart still racing.

When Adrian had touched her earlier, she hadn't resisted.

She had even... lost herself in it.

What was wrong with her?

She grabbed her hair tightly, warning herself to stop thinking.

No matter how beautiful the surface seemed, the truth was already decided.

There was no possibility for them anymore.

A bitter smile touched her lips.

His scent still lingered on her skin.

She grabbed her pajamas and walked into the bathroom.

Hot water washed over her body, but it couldn't wash away her chaotic thoughts.

Exhaustion finally washed over her as she slipped into bed.

Dreams quietly descended.

The sunlight in the university classroom was warm.

She hugged her books, walking toward the door.

Adrian waited there, his smile gentle.

Classmates cast envious glances their way.

He naturally ruffled her hair.

He took her bag and held her hand.

"It got cold today."

He chided her softly.

"Why are you dressed so lightly?"

She pouted, feeling wronged.

"I didn't check the forecast..."

"I don't have any warm clothes."

Her icy hands were enveloped in his palms.

He took off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

"Let's go buy you some new ones."

He held her hand as they walked down the long, tree-lined path.

Her hands grew warm in his.

Ring ring...

Ring ring...
###Chapter 180

The alarm clock shattered the morning silence.

Anna Ross reached out and turned it off.

Why had she dreamed of those past events?

Perhaps she had been overthinking lately.

She rubbed her temples and got up to wash up.

When she arrived at the office, it was still empty.

She had just sat down when the sound of high heels approached from afar.

Chloe Valentine stopped at her desk and tapped the surface with her knuckles. "Executive Assistant Ross, come with me to meet the clients later."

Anna looked up at her. "I'm only temporarily assisting with this project. Client meetings are not within my responsibilities."

She remembered there was a dedicated team for this project.

A flicker of displeasure passed through Chloe's eyes, but she quickly suppressed it.

She curled her lips into a smile. "Have you forgotten? The core documents are still with you."

"You were responsible for the initial contact and preparation. You can't back out now."

She leaned in closer, lowering her voice. "If your absence causes problems with the cooperation, can you take that responsibility?"

Anna's heart tightened.

She had indeed forgotten about that.

Helpless, she could only nod. "I understand."

"Good. Wait for my notice." Chloe straightened up, satisfied, and walked away gracefully in her high heels.

Anna clenched her fists, feeling inexplicably uneasy.

She had never participated in client meetings before and was afraid of making mistakes.

That sense of foreboding grew stronger.

She had a feeling today would not be peaceful.

Chloe returned to her office, a smug smile curling her lips.

Just you wait, Anna Ross.

Today will be your end.

She took out her phone and dialed a number.

"Is everything arranged?"

After receiving an affirmative reply, a ruthless glint flashed in her eyes.

The show was about to begin.

She could barely contain her excitement.

Time passed so slowly.

Finally, it was time for the meeting.

Anna followed Chloe toward the conference room, accompanied by two other project team members.

She couldn't help but look around curiously.

She had heard this client was very important, and the company valued this cooperation highly.

Chloe shot her a sidelong glance and warned in a low voice, "Be smart later. Don't embarrass me."

Anna nodded solemnly.

She understood the importance of this cooperation.

The client arrived on time, but his expression was dark.

Chloe immediately stepped forward to greet him, but he raised his hand to stop her.

"Is this your company's sincerity?" the client demanded coldly.

Chloe was taken aback. "What do you mean?"

The client slammed a stack of documents on the table. "The core documents have been leaked, and you're still pretending to be clueless?"

Anna's face paled instantly. "That's impossible! We absolutely did not leak any documents!"
###Chapter 181

“No? Are you implying I’m making this up?”

His tone was icy, his gaze sharp as a blade, piercing straight through her.

The other two colleagues exchanged a look, then turned hesitant eyes toward Anna Ross.

She stood her ground, spine straight.
From the moment the documents were handed over until now, she had never let anyone else handle them.
She had not leaked a single word.
The problem must lie elsewhere.

She met his gaze directly, her voice clear. “I am certain there were no oversights in the steps I handled. There must be some misunderstanding.”

The man snorted derisively, his tone sarcastic. “So you’re flawless, and the problem is on our end? Is this your company’s professional attitude?”

Anna pressed her lips together and remained silent.
The clues were scattered, and she couldn’t piece them together yet.

Chloe Valentine suddenly stepped forward, a polite smile on her face. “Cooperation relies on goodwill. Why argue? Since Executive Assistant Ross says there wasn’t, perhaps we should investigate further.”

She glanced sideways at Anna, a faint trace of triumph flashing in the corner of her eye.

Anna was taken aback.
Chloe was speaking up for her?

Seeing this, the man’s tone softened slightly, though his expression remained displeased. “But the leak to our competitor is a fact! You’re playing games with our trust. How can we continue this partnership?”

“Leaked to a rival company!?” Chloe gasped, covering her mouth with her hand. She turned to Anna. “But you were the one in charge of the core documents the whole time…”

She frowned, hesitating, then suddenly gripped Anna’s shoulders, her tone turning severe. “Executive Assistant Ross, I’m not accusing you, but this is critical. You must provide an explanation!”

Every eye in the room instantly locked onto Anna.

A cold laugh echoed in Anna’s heart.
So the earlier intervention was just a setup for this ambush.

She brushed off Chloe’s hand, her expression calm and detached. “I’ll say it again. I know nothing about this.”

Chloe gritted her teeth in silent fury.
How could she still be so stubborn at a time like this?
Fine. The bigger the scene, the more certain it is you’ll take the fall.

The man chose that moment to snort coldly. “The documents were in your possession. You know nothing? Did they grow legs and walk away on their own?”

He crossed his arms, his posture arrogant.

Chloe also pressed in a low voice, “Executive Assistant Ross, are you truly completely in the dark?”

The looks from the other two colleagues were now filled with outright suspicion and contempt.
###Chapter 182

Anna Ross clenched her fingers.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

She met the scrutinizing gazes of everyone in the room.

Her voice was clear and firm.

"I don't know."

"I didn't do this."

The air in the conference room grew still.

Suspicion was written on every face.

Chloe Valentine let out a light laugh.

She tapped her fingertips on the table.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

"The project documents only passed through your hands and mine."

"Are you suggesting I was the one who leaked them?"

Anna's back straightened.

She looked at the representative from the partner company.

"May I ask how your company determined the source of the breach?"

The representative coldly opened a file.

"Our rival company released an identical proposal this morning."

"The timing coincides directly after you submitted the final version."

Chloe suddenly sighed.

She walked over to Anna.

Her tone was full of false pity.

"Anna."

"If you're having financial difficulties, you could have told me."

"Why resort to something like this…"

Anna's head snapped up.

Her gaze was sharp as a blade.

"Director Valentine."

"You were the one who handed the materials to me yesterday."

"You also provided the encrypted USB drive."

Chloe's expression faltered slightly.

But she quickly regained her composure.

"Are you accusing me of framing you?"

She turned to the partner company representative.

"Mr. Li, I recommend we launch an internal investigation immediately."

Mr. Li stood up.

His suit was impeccably tailored.

"We need an explanation within twenty-four hours."

"Otherwise, we will terminate our cooperation."

"And pursue legal action."

The conference room door swung open.

Lucas Evans walked in, bringing a chill with him.

His eyes swept across the room.

Finally, they landed on Anna's pale face.

"What's going on?"
###Chapter 183

Anna Ross looked toward the door.

A flicker of surprise passed through her eyes.

The man who had been negotiating quickly stood up.

He moved respectfully to the newcomer's side.

He reported the situation in a low voice.

His expression was troubled. "Mr. Evans, that's how the negotiation went. What do you think..."

Lucas Evans raised a hand to stop him.

The man immediately stepped aside.

Lucas's gaze turned to Anna.

A soft light shimmered in his eyes.

The corners of his mouth lifted slightly.

Anna remembered what she had said to him last time.

A pang of guilt stirred within her.

But it wasn't the right moment to show it.

She offered a faint smile in return.

So he was the client for this collaboration.

The man from before must be his assistant.

Chloe Valentine noticed their interaction.

She made a mental note of it.

She stood up to greet him. "Mr. Evans, my apologies. We've had an issue. Someone leaked the documents."

She deliberately glanced at Anna.

"I failed to manage my subordinate properly. I'm truly sorry."

Anna's fingers tightened slightly.

Lucas spoke up then. "I'm aware of the situation. But I don't believe she did it."

Chloe was stunned.

Anna was equally surprised.

She hadn't expected him to say that.

"But—"

"Do you have anything else to add?"

Chloe wanted to argue further.

Lucas cut her off coldly.

She could only shake her head.

She gritted her teeth in frustration.

She had hoped Lucas would reprimand Anna.

She wanted to pin all the blame on her.

All her scheming.

Had resulted only in a statement of trust.

Anna sent him a grateful look.

While it didn't prove her innocence.

It was enough to offer some comfort.

"Mr. Evans, I will get to the bottom of this. I'll give you a full account." She made a solemn promise.

Her mind raced, reviewing the events.

Where had things gone wrong?

She knew she hadn't done it.

Why was Chloe so certain it was her?

Anna wanted to leave.

The negotiation seemed impossible to continue.

She needed time to uncover the truth.

Hearing her call him 'Mr. Evans'.

Lucas felt a strange twinge.

It felt too distant and formal.

He preferred when she used his name.

Chloe stared at her with hatred.

She hadn't expected anyone to help at a time like this.

Did they know each other before?

Lucas stepped forward.

He took hold of the hand of the person trying to leave.

He said gently, "You don't owe me any account. I believe it wasn't you. You shouldn't bear the blame for a crime you didn't commit."

Gratitude turned into deep emotion.

Anna was momentarily at a loss for words.

This was a major project.

The losses would be immeasurable.

Even if he believed her.

She still had to find out the truth.

Hurried footsteps sounded outside the door.

The door was pushed open.

Adrian Sinclair's tall figure appeared in everyone's view.

His gaze instantly fell on the held hand.

A flash of displeasure crossed his eyes.

But he didn't show it.

Anna hadn't noticed yet.

She was wondering why he had suddenly arrived.

Chloe saw him enter.

She immediately put on a sweet smile.

She rushed to him coquettishly. "Adrian, what brings you here?"
###Chapter 184

This was going to be interesting.

As soon as Adrian Sinclair found out Anna Ross had leaked the project's confidential data, he would immediately fire her from the company.

But then, an even better idea occurred to her.

Adrian cast a cold glance at Chloe Valentine.
He deliberately stepped back. "I came to see how the negotiations were going."
His tone was calm, but his sharp gaze shot straight toward Anna.
The air around them instantly grew colder.

Only then did Anna realize.
Lucas was still holding her hand.
No wonder he had looked so dark since entering the room.

She quickly pulled her hand back.
She took half a step away.

When she looked up again, his expression had softened slightly.
She quietly let out a sigh of relief.

Chloe shot Anna a furious glare.
She was seething inside.
As long as this woman was around, Adrian's eyes never truly saw her.
He wouldn't spare her a single second.

She trembled with hatred.
Anna had to go.
She had to be driven out of the company, out of their world.

"Adrian, Executive Assistant Ross and Mr. Evans seem quite close."
Chloe looked at him with feigned innocence. "Bringing her along was the right choice. With her here, the cooperation talks should go smoothly, right?"

Anna felt sick listening.
This woman changed her expression faster than flipping a page.
She was clearly implying there was something improper between her and Lucas.

Would he believe it?
She couldn't help stealing a glance at Adrian.
Then she quickly lowered her head.

Adrian didn't respond to Chloe.
He walked directly over to Lucas.
The corner of his mouth lifted. "Mr. Evans, standing and talking must be tiring. Let's sit and discuss."
He gestured with his hand, subtly positioning himself between Lucas and Anna.

Lucas looked displeased, but could only smile and take a seat.
He tried to look back at Anna, but Adrian blocked his view completely.
He couldn't see even a shadow of her.

...
He suspected the man was doing it on purpose.
But he had no proof.

Adrian sat down beside him.
He interlaced his fingers on the table, his smile not reaching his eyes. "Mr. Evans, I hadn't planned on coming. But when I heard the partner was you, I came immediately."

Lucas: "...Thank you for your concern, Mr. Sinclair."
He probably wasn't here for the project at all.

"I will get to the bottom of the data breach."
Adrian's eyes suddenly turned cold, filled with a chilling intensity.

Chloe's heart trembled at the sight.
She rarely saw him angry.
She hadn't expected it to be so terrifying.

But then she thought, Anna was done for now.
She could barely suppress the smile tugging at her lips.

Seeing that no one was paying attention to her, Anna quietly moved toward the door.
She pushed it open and slipped out.

She bit her lower lip, her heart burning with anxiety.
She had to find evidence to prove her innocence, and fast.
Moreover, the look on Adrian's face, like he wanted to devour her, was truly frightening.
Staying away from Lucas was the wise choice.
###Chapter 185

The meeting room was sparsely populated.

Her actions had already been noticed by everyone.

Lucas Evans turned to look.

He found that she had already left.

He lost interest in continuing the conversation.

"Mr. Sinclair, let's end our discussion here for today."

"I'll take my leave now."

He shot Chloe Valentine a meaningful glance.

Then he withdrew his gaze.

His assistant quickly stepped forward.

They walked out together.

After taking just two steps,

a cold voice sounded from behind.

"Mr. Evans, I hope you remember."

"This is my territory."

"Please mind your boundaries the next time you visit."

"Keep your hands off my employees."

Adrian Sinclair's warning was clear and audible.

Each word carried a chilling coldness.

Lucas turned around.

He saw the man lounging lazily in his chair.

His expression was calm and indifferent.

As if the words just spoken had nothing to do with him.

Lucas understood the underlying meaning perfectly.

It was clearly referring to him grabbing Anna Ross's hand.

He suddenly curved his lips into a smile.

He deliberately rubbed his fingertips.

As if savoring something.

His tone was provocative.

"Mr. Sinclair, since I'm in charge of the project."

"And she is a member of the project team."

"We will inevitably meet frequently."

"This is unavoidable."

Adrian didn't turn around.

But his eyes grew colder.

The temperature around them plummeted.

Everyone present couldn't help but shiver.

Just as Lucas was about to leave,

that indifferent voice spoke again.

"That reminds me."

"I can remove her from the project team."

"The company has plenty of talent."

"Replacing her would be effortless."

He toyed with the pen in his hand.

His expression was terrifyingly dark.

Originally, he wanted her to perform well.

To show her abilities to Grandpa.

But now it seemed.

This decision was not wise.

It had given others an opportunity.

His knuckles tightened.

The pen made a faint cracking sound.

Watching him care so much about Anna Ross,

Chloe Valentine felt as if her heart was being torn apart.

Her eyes reddened.

Why?

Why did he still protect her at a time like this?

She would never allow it.

He could only be hers!

Chloe took a deep breath.

Forcing down the pain in her heart.

Anyway, Anna Ross would be gone soon.

She wasn't in a hurry.

She could take her time.

"Adrian, the data breach is a serious matter."

"Executive Assistant Ross is now the prime suspect."

"Replacing her before the investigation is complete."

"Wouldn't that be inappropriate?" She hesitated as she looked at him.

Although she feared his anger,

She didn't want to miss this opportunity.

She couldn't let her escape easily.

Adrian gave her a cold glance.

Lucas chuckled softly.

"It seems replacing her isn't that easy."

"Even if you want to."

"The person beside you doesn't seem to agree."

"I'll be visiting often from now on."

"It'll be a good chance to see the person I want to see."

He shrugged.

Then left with his assistant.

Adrian's jaw tightened.

He closed his eyes and opened them again.

The pen in his hand snapped and fell to the ground.

Chloe stumbled back in fear.

The man looked at her.

His gaze was sinister.

"What exactly is going on?"

"Adrian, I..." She lowered her head sadly.

Her hands clenched tightly.

As if it was difficult to speak.

Under Adrian's impatient gaze,

She finally spoke.

"Everything was prepared for the negotiation today."

"But the other party suddenly informed us of a data leak."

"The core documents have always been with Executive Assistant Ross."

"I suspect she was the one who did it."

Adrian frowned deeply.

Would she really do something like this?
###Chapter 186

Chloe Valentine watched his expression change without a trace of emotion, a flicker of triumph in her heart.

The earlier confrontation had clarified the situation for her.

Lucas Evans clearly had ulterior motives toward Anna Ross.

As long as Lucas continued to pursue Anna, she would have no opportunity to approach her fiancé.

Speaking up for Lucas earlier had been a brilliant move.

This game was becoming more interesting by the minute.

"You may leave." Adrian Sinclair did not look at her, his voice cold as ice.

He treated her as if she were an insignificant object.

Chloe's heart ached, but she suppressed her anger.

Maintaining control was key.

Removing Anna was only a matter of time.

"Adrian, I'll get back to work then. Call me if you need anything." She adopted a thoughtful and understanding demeanor, her gaze lingering on him with reluctance.

Soon, he would belong entirely to her.

Adrian merely acknowledged with a faint sound, not lifting his head.

Chloe turned away unwillingly, the two others following closely behind.

No one in the company dared to defy the CEO.

A single glance from him could send chills down anyone's spine.

Adrian sat alone for a moment, his brow furrowed.

He stood and returned to his office.

As soon as he sat down, he dialed the internal line.

"Noah, come to my office."

After hanging up, he tossed his phone onto the desk.

He picked up his coffee and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

He took a sip before setting it down again.

Gazing down at the bustling crowd below, he narrowed his eyes.

He refused to believe she would do such a thing.

If someone had set her up, he would find out who.

Daring to play games right under his nose took some nerve.

A knock sounded at the door.

Noah Watson entered quickly.

"Mr. Sinclair, what do you need?"

Adrian turned and sat back in his executive chair, his expression serious.

"Investigate the company's data breach."

"Understood." Noah accepted the order immediately.

Adrian waved him away.

Noah bowed slightly and left.

Passing Anna's empty workstation, he couldn't help but glance at it.

Anna sat at her desk, restless and distracted.

She knew she had been framed.

The mastermind behind it was obvious.

But where should she start investigating?

What troubled her more was that the client for this project was Lucas Evans.

They would have to see each other frequently from now on.

How should she handle that?
###Chapter 187

The most urgent matter was not personal grudges, but uncovering the truth behind the data breach.

Anna Ross clenched her fingers.
Chloe Valentine's behavior today had revealed too many flaws.
She was likely involved.
But there was no solid evidence yet.
And Chloe was currently the favorite in Grandpa's eyes.

She needed to find a breakthrough quickly.

Meanwhile.

Chloe Valentine returned to her office in her high heels, dark fire burning in her eyes.
Although most of her plan had succeeded, Adrian Sinclair's protection of Anna still stung.

She slammed the door shut.
Her nails dug deep into her palms.

Anna would leave the company eventually.
But before that, she couldn't let that fox have any chance to get close to Adrian again.

How could she tolerate some lowly woman taking everything that rightfully belonged to her?

Absolutely not!

Chloe glanced coldly out the window.
She suddenly remembered the way Lucas Evans looked at Anna.
That undisguised admiration might become a weapon in her hands.

If she could push them together, there would naturally be no room left for Anna beside Adrian.

That's it!

She curled her lips into a smile and walked straight to Anna's workstation.
Anna was focused on her work and didn't look up.

Chloe snorted disdainfully but suppressed her anger, putting on a mask of false kindness.
"Executive Assistant Ross, you seemed quite familiar with the client we met today?"
She pulled over a chair and sat down, blocking the way.

Anna glanced up, her gaze icy and indifferent.
"What does that have to do with you?"

Chloe cursed inwardly but maintained a gentle smile.
"I noticed he was quite taken with you. If you're willing, he might help you resolve this crisis."
She leaned in and lowered her voice.
"If the project goes smoothly, not only could you avoid blame, but the cooperation could also be saved."

Anna almost laughed.
Trading emotions for profit?
She had miscalculated.

"Miss Valentine, do you think this is a joke?" Anna asked expressionlessly.

Chloe raised an eyebrow.
"A joke?"
She had offered an olive branch, and this woman dared reject it.
Then don't blame her for being ruthless.

Anna suddenly stood up and stepped closer, her gaze sharp as a knife.
"Let me ask you something. Did you leak the confidential data?"
###Chapter 188

Chloe Valentine was forced to tilt her head up.

Anna Ross’s gaze was like an ice pick.

She tried to stand.

But Anna blocked her path first.

Damn it.

She was being overpowered.

Chloe clenched her fingers.

She forced an innocent expression. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"The documents were always in your possession."

"Who should be blamed now that this has happened?"

Colleagues around them turned to look.

Anna returned to her workstation.

Her voice was soft. "What you say doesn't matter."

"But you'd better hope I don't find any evidence."

Chloe suddenly smiled.

She leaned close to Anna's ear.

Her breath was cold. "You won't find it."

"You'll never find it."

Anna's fingers trembled slightly.

So it was her.

Chloe straightened up.

Her smile was bright. "Good luck."

The sound of high heels faded away.

Anna closed her eyes.

The challenge had been issued.

It would only get harder from here.

。。。。。。。

CEO's Office.

Noah Watson stood before the desk.

He hesitated. "Mr. Sinclair, we found something."

Adrian Sinclair looked up. "Speak."

"The data was indeed leaked from the Creative Department."

"It was sent from a specific computer."

Noah's tone was uncertain.

His eyes avoided direct contact.

Adrian frowned. "Who?"

"It was Executive Assistant Ross."

Noah handed over the records.

Black and white on paper.

Clear and glaring.

Adrian stared at the report.

His knuckles turned white.

"I don't believe it."

His voice was low.

Noah nodded. "I don't either."

"There must be some misunderstanding."

Adrian put the report away.

He locked it in a drawer.

"Keep this confidential."

"Suppress it for now."

Noah acknowledged and left.

Silence filled the office.

Adrian looked out the window.

His eyes were dark and unreadable.
###Chapter 189

Noah Watson acknowledged the order and withdrew.

Adrian Sinclair added coldly, "Tell Anna Ross to come up immediately."

"Understood."

As Noah closed the door, he caught a glimpse of his boss's grim expression and felt a chill.

The boss was in a foul mood today.

Was Anna about to bear the brunt of his anger?

Remembering Adrian's terrifying temper, Noah's back went cold.

Anna might be in serious trouble this time.

Anna sneezed twice in succession, her head feeling heavy and muddled.

Someone must be talking about her behind her back again.

She forced herself to focus and sort through the clues.

After Chloe Valentine handed over the documents, she had only been asked to contact the clients.

What exactly happened after that?

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

It was Noah calling.

Her heart skipped a beat.

Did the company already know?

"Anna, Mr. Sinclair wants you upstairs immediately."

She took a deep breath.

The inevitable had finally arrived.

"I'll be right there."

Hanging up, her fingertips turned cold.

Each step felt like walking on blades.

His summons at this time could only mean one thing: the data breach.

He wouldn't believe her either.

A soft knock sounded at the door.

"Enter."

She pushed the door open.

Adrian was focused on processing documents, not even looking up.

She clenched the hem of her clothes. "I didn't do it."

The sound of typing ceased abruptly.

He lifted his gaze, sharp as a blade.

"Come here."

His voice was piercingly cold.

She moved forward slowly.

Adrian pulled a file from his drawer and flung it onto the desk.

"See for yourself."

He leaned back in his chair, his gaze oppressive.

Anna picked up the papers, her pupils constricting sharply.

All the evidence pointed to her computer.

So Chloe had set her up from the very beginning.

Adrian glanced sideways with a cold sneer. "I thought you might be of some use."

"Turns out you can't even manage basic precautions."

"I really didn't!"

Her voice trembled.

It didn't matter if others didn't believe her.

But how could he hurt her like this?

A wave of grievance washed over her.

Even stronger than when she faced Chloe.

Adrian's fingers stilled slightly.

He realized his words had been too harsh.

But he didn't know how to take them back.
###Chapter 190

He stood and moved closer.

His voice was low. "If you insist on your innocence, you should provide evidence to prove it. Empty words won't convince anyone."

Anna Ross looked up abruptly.

Her gaze met his deep, unfathomable eyes.

He stared at her. "Go back and check your computer thoroughly. If someone tampered with it, there will be traces."

Her fingers curled slightly.

Was he actually giving her advice?

It seemed he had already investigated secretly.

Otherwise, he wouldn't be so certain.

This reminder came at the right time.

It gave direction to her chaotic thoughts.

She thought he would use this chance to fire her.

Instead, he chose to believe her.

A faint flutter stirred deep inside her.

She whispered softly, "Thank you."

Thank you for his trust.

And thank you for pointing the way.

"You're really quite foolish," he chuckled under his breath.

The distance was too close.

She heard every word clearly.

Anna wanted to argue.

But she remembered his help.

She swallowed her words.

The next moment.

His arm suddenly wrapped around her waist.

His warm palm pressed against her skin through the thin dress.

Anna's heart raced wildly.

She looked up at him like a startled deer.

The weather was hot.

She had already taken off her jacket.

Only a thin dress remained.

Now she could clearly feel his fingers lingering at her waist.

"You..." She tried to break free.

But he only held her tighter.

Adrian Sinclair cupped her chin with his other hand.

His breath brushed her cheek.

His gaze turned cold. "Stay away from Lucas Evans. Or I can't promise what I might do."

Anna was slightly stunned.

So it was still about Lucas.

Noticing her distraction, he tightened his grip.

He pressed his fingers into her slender waist.

Anna winced in pain and glared at him. "Have you lost your mind?"

But her expression only amused him.

"Just reminding you of your limits," he said with a slight smile. "Remember, you belong to me now."

Anna looked away.

She responded quietly, "I know my place. I won't cross the line."

He was so domineering and controlling.

Sometimes she wondered if he had traveled from ancient times.

"Good," he said, clearly satisfied.

But his hand did not let go.

Anna felt flustered.

Her cheeks burned crimson.

She tried to shy away.

Just as she felt utterly embarrassed, he finally released her.

He raised an eyebrow. "Withdraw from the project. I'll find a replacement."

Adrian sat back in his chair.

He waited calmly for her response.

But Anna hesitated.

She couldn't quit now.

The truth wasn't clear yet.

Leaving would only confirm the suspicion against her.

"The project isn't over yet," she said, lowering her eyes to the documents. "It's not the right time to withdraw."
###Chapter 191

"You don't want to quit?" The man's voice turned icy cold as he stood up and closed in on her, the atmosphere instantly growing heavy and oppressive.

Anna Ross hadn't expected such an intense reaction. She hurried to explain, "No, it's just that—"

Her words were cut off by his sharp interruption. "Enough! Ultimately, it's because Lucas Evans is the client for this collaboration, isn't it? That's why you're so reluctant to leave."

"You avoided participating in the project before by making all sorts of excuses. Now you're eagerly throwing yourself into it. Do you really think I can't see what's on your mind?" He let out a cold laugh, each word like an ice pick stabbing into her heart.

Anna's fingers trembled. She clenched the documents in her hand, the paper crumpling under her grip. So this was what he thought of her.

She lifted her head stubbornly, meeting his gaze. "You've misunderstood!" She was desperate to defend herself, but nervousness made her momentarily speechless.

Surprisingly, he fell into an unusual silence, waiting quietly for her to speak.

Anna steadied her breathing and spoke clearly. "I want to stay not because of Lucas Evans. It's because I've taken on this project, and I need to see it through to the end. I also need this kind of opportunity to develop my skills."

"Now that something has gone wrong with the project, if I suddenly quit, what will everyone think of me? I have to find out the truth."

...

Her words were met with a long, heavy silence.

After saying so much in one breath, the sudden quiet in the air felt deeply uncomfortable.

What was wrong with him today? Throwing a tantrum for no reason was one thing, but now he was interfering with her work too?

He was so difficult to deal with!

In her mind, Anna had already pinned him to the ground and rubbed it hundreds of times, but it still didn't feel satisfying. She wanted to grab his ears and yell at him even more.

Maybe that would be more effective.

The thought almost made her laugh out loud. She forced herself to hold it in, her expression twisting slightly.

Adrian Sinclair watched her rapidly changing expressions, his brow furrowing tightly. What was this woman thinking about now?

He rapped his knuckles sharply on the desk. Anna immediately composed herself.

"You can continue your investigation," he stated, his tone leaving no room for argument. "But you must hand over all liaison duties with Lucas Evans to someone else." The thought of her interacting with Lucas filled him with an inexplicable irritation.

Since when did anyone else get to covet what was his?

The temperature in the office seemed to plummet. Looking at the "iceberg" before her, Anna had no doubt that if she refused again, she would be torn to pieces in the next second.

Fine. Better to avoid trouble. It was wiser not to provoke him further.

Right now, she just wanted to focus on uncovering the truth peacefully. As for Lucas Evans, not seeing him was probably for the best. It would help curb his expectations.

"I agree. I won't be involved with this project anymore." Anna finished speaking and lowered her eyes. There was no point looking for any kindness in his expression anyway.

She suddenly thought of Chloe Valentine and hesitated, on the verge of speaking. But without any evidence, saying anything now would be pointless.

Seeing his continued silence, Anna ventured cautiously, "If there's nothing else, I'll head back now." She had just started to turn when her wrist was seized in a strong grip. A powerful force pulled her, and she was suddenly pinned against the edge of the desk.

Anna whirled around in alarm. His grip was so forceful she nearly fell back onto the desk, only managing to steady herself by bracing her hands against the surface just in time.
###Chapter 192

The desk dug into her painfully.

He pressed closer.

Trapping her completely in his arms.

What was he trying to do now?

Alarm bells rang in Anna Ross's mind.

This was the office.

Did he have no restraint at all?

Before she could speak.

Adrian Sinclair cupped the back of her head.

His scorching kiss descended heavily.

Her lips were instantly conquered.

He tangled with her.

Devouring her essence ravenously.

As if he wanted to consume her whole.

Anna struggled to breathe.

She raised her hands to push against his chest.

It was futile.

The kiss was too overpowering.

She felt like a leaf tossed in the wind.

Completely at his mercy.

Her consciousness began to blur.

Even the will to resist faded away.

Adrian watched her through half-lidded eyes.

His gaze darkened as it swept over her dazed expression.

The memory of Lucas Evans holding her hand surfaced.

Rage surged within him.

His actions grew more reckless.

Time lost all meaning.

The world narrowed to just the two of them.

Anna tilted her head back, accepting.

Her hair was mussed by his fingers.

Oxygen grew thin.

Her chest heaved violently.

Waves of dizziness washed over her.

Sensing her distress.

Adrian finally released her.

He stared at her swollen lips.

Satisfaction glinted in his eyes.

Anna gasped for air.

She had never appreciated it more.

He stroked her cheek.

His voice was husky. "You belong only to me."
Understand?

Belong only to him?
What a possessive declaration.

Her eyes, glistening with moisture, looked up at him.
Seeming to comprehend, yet not fully.

In the end, she nodded obediently.
As if under a spell.

Adrian stepped back, pleased.
A slight smile touched his lips. "Get back to work."

"Okay," she replied dazedly.
Her soul still felt firmly in his grasp.

He watched her leave.
A unexpected tenderness flickered in his eyes.
This feeling.
Was surprisingly good.

He sat back down at his computer, content.
A faint smile still played on his lips.

Voices outside the door startled Anna.
She hurried into the restroom.
Adjusting her disheveled collar.
Her fingertips brushed her burning cheeks.
His words echoed in her ears.

What kind of feelings did he truly have for her?

Now wasn't the time to dwell on it.
She quickly touched up her makeup.
Staring at her slightly swollen lips in the mirror.
She silently cursed him. Beast.

Fortunately, she had brought lipstick.
A little cover-up made it less noticeable.

Once composed.
She turned on the faucet to wash her hands.

Her phone on the vanity suddenly rang.
She dried her hands and picked it up.
Her brow instantly furrowed.
The caller ID read—
Lucas Evans.
###Chapter 193

Her phone screen lit up.

She stared at the name for a few seconds.

Her finger hovered over the answer button.

In the end, she pressed decline.

Now was not the time to talk.

She couldn't give him the response he wanted.

She couldn't drag him into this mess again.

She took a deep breath.

Composed herself.

Checked that her expression showed nothing unusual.

Then turned and walked out of the restroom.

Back at her desk.

Adrian Sinclair's words echoed in her ears.

She opened her computer.

Followed his instructions.

A line of deleted records appeared on the screen.

Her heart raced.

She opened the email.

Her vision darkened.

It was the leaked project documents.

Now she had solid evidence.

Someone had accessed her computer.

Who could it be?

The office was full of people.

Chloe Valentine wouldn't do it herself.

How could she find out who did it?

She quickly returned to the desktop.

Pretended to stare blankly at the screen.

Colleagues nearby were chatting.

"Did you hear what happened at the supermarket downstairs?"

"What? What happened?"

"The owner had a large sum of money stolen!"

"Oh my god, how did that happen?"

Anna Ross listened quietly.

"The owner didn't have surveillance cameras."

"Luckily, the company's cameras caught it."

"That's how they caught the thief."

She looked up suddenly.

Her eyes fell on the corner of the ceiling.

Surveillance cameras!

Why hadn't she thought of that?

She stood up immediately.

Headed straight for the security room.

The security guard glanced at her.

"Can I help you?"

"I'd like to check the surveillance footage."

The guard nodded and let her in.

Screens covered the wall, flickering.

She found the area for the Creative Department.

Scrolled back day by day.

Her eyes grew sore and tired.

But she found nothing.

She put down the mouse.

Thanked the guard.

Returned to her desk dejected.

Quitting time arrived.

Her phone rang suddenly in her bag.

It was a call from the bar owner.
###Chapter 194

Anna Ross stared at her phone screen, puzzled by the call from the bar owner.

Receiving a call at this hour was highly unusual.

She never missed work without reason, and her boss rarely contacted her outside working hours.

After a moment's hesitation, she answered. "Pamela, is everything alright?"

Having worked together for some time, she'd grown accustomed to calling the owner Pamela, finding it more natural and friendly.

An urgent voice came through the phone. "Anna, can you come to the bar right now? Someone is asking for you specifically."

"?"

Anna frowned slightly. Who would be looking for her at this time?

Her boss's tone sounded off. Was something wrong?

Her chest tightened with concern. "Alright, I'll be right there."

She grabbed her handbag and hurried out, only to collide with someone at the company entrance.

A sharp pain shot through her nose. She immediately lowered her head to apologize. "I'm so sorry! I wasn't watching where I was going!"

She tried to leave, but the person stopped her. "Anna Ross, you're just going to run off after bumping into me?"

That voice...

She froze. It was Adrian Sinclair!

Why did she keep running into him?

She forced a smile. "My apologies. I have an urgent matter to attend to."

Just as Adrian reached out to stop her, Chloe Valentine's voice called out from nearby. "Adrian!"

Anna quickened her pace without looking back, though she couldn't help wondering about their interaction.

Right now, the bar situation took priority.

When she arrived at the bar, the owner was waiting anxiously.

Pamela looked uneasy, her expression somewhat strange.

Anna glanced around but saw no one else. "Pamela, where is the person who wanted to see me?"

The owner took her hand, voice full of concern. "Anna, be honest with me. Are you planning to leave your job here?"

"Leave? I've never considered that." Anna looked completely bewildered.

Pamela finally relaxed, a smile appearing on her face. "That's good!"

Anna was currently the bar's main attraction. Losing her would be a significant blow.

Anna smiled slightly. "So, where is this person who asked for me?"

The owner didn't press further, simply pointing toward a corner of the bar.

A figure sat in the dim lighting.

Anna took a few steps closer. When she recognized who it was, she froze completely.

How could it be him!?

The man looked up, revealing a gentle smile. "Little Anna, it's been a long time."
###Chapter 195

Anna Ross froze for a moment.

This face was both familiar and strange.

The neighbor brother from the depths of her memory, the one who always secretly slipped her candies, had now reappeared before her in this manner.

The teardrop mole at the corner of his eye was still striking.

Julian Garnache waved his hand gently in front of her eyes.

A playful curve lifted the corner of his lips.

"Little Anna, have you forgotten your brother so soon?"

The tips of Anna's ears grew warm.

She shook her head in a flustered denial.

"It's just... very unexpected."

She sat down on the sofa beside him.

Her gaze still held a trace of disbelief.

Julian signaled a waiter over.

He thoughtfully ordered a glass of juice for her.

The glass refracted the dazzling bar lights.

Anna softly thanked him.

He had always been this considerate.

"I didn't expect to run into you in New York either," Julian said, raising his glass in a toast.

Their glasses met with a clear, crisp sound.

Anna pressed her lips together in a light smile.

Fate's arrangements were always full of surprises.

If not for Adrian Sinclair, she would never have set foot in this city.

"I heard you were doing very well abroad. Why did you suddenly return home?"

The music from the dance floor surged and receded loudly.

Occasional glances were cast toward the striking pair.

Julian set his glass down.

His fingertips tapped lightly on the table.

"Home just suits me better."

He glanced at her sideways.

"But you—why are you performing at a bar?"

Anna was taken aback.

"How did you know I work here?"

This was something no one should have known.

Julian suddenly laughed.

He reached out and ruffled her hair.

"You're quite the celebrity in New York's bar scene now."

Anna instinctively turned her head away.

He didn't seem to mind.

"You little ingrate. You used to chase after me calling me 'big brother' all the time."

Anna couldn't help retorting.

"That was all a long time ago."

She lowered her gaze to the ripples in her glass.

"I never thought my childhood dream would come true in this way."

A hint of self-mockery tinged her voice.

Julian's expression turned serious.

"I think it's wonderful."

He made an exaggerated cheering gesture.

It made her laugh aloud.

The atmosphere finally relaxed.

Julian suddenly leaned in closer.

"Would you consider coming to my place?"

Anna looked up, confused.

"What?"

"I opened a bar here in New York." A charming curve lifted the corner of his lips. "I'd like to invite you to perform there."
###Chapter 196

That beauty mark beneath his eye was particularly captivating.

It held a hint of alluring charm.

Anna Ross averted her gaze.

She finally understood why the bar owner had been so anxious.

He was afraid she would leave.

Facing Julian Garnache's expectant look, she offered an apologetic smile.

"Julian, thank you for the offer."

"But I'm quite content with my current job."

"I'm not looking for a change right now."

The bar owner had treated her well.

She couldn't betray that trust.

Julian gently patted her shoulder.

His tone remained gentle.

"That's alright. I respect your decision."

"My offer stands indefinitely."

"You're always welcome."

"Okay." Anna's eyes curved into happy crescents.

Being with him was always so easy and comfortable.

He was still that gentle, considerate boy next door.

She set down her glass.

"How about I treat you to dinner?"

"You always bought me snacks before."

"It's my turn now."

Julian stood up immediately.

Amusement sparkled in his eyes.

"Then let this big brother enjoy being spoiled by his little sister."

Anna got permission from the boss.

She followed him out of the bar.

"Wait here. I'll get the car." He headed towards the parking lot.

Anna stood waiting.

Soon, a sleek sports car pulled up in front of her.

She was inwardly impressed.

He had clearly been very successful over the years.

Compared to her own struggles, his life had been much smoother.

She got into the car.

She started searching for restaurant recommendations.

A light laugh came from beside her.

"I know a nice place."

Anna blushed and put her phone away.

"I'll follow your lead."

It seemed she needed to familiarize herself with the area soon.

At the restaurant, Julian chose a table.

He thoughtfully pulled out her chair.

He always acted like a warm older brother.

Anna was deeply touched.

Since childhood, he had always taken care of her like this.

In her heart, he was already family.

After ordering, they chatted while looking at the night view outside.

Julian brought up funny childhood stories.

He made her laugh until tears welled in her eyes.

The food arrived, smelling delicious.

Neither noticed the familiar figure sitting in the corner.

Chloe Valentine dabbed her mouth with a napkin.

Her voice was soft. "Adrian, I'm going to the restroom."

Adrian Sinclair gave a slight nod.

Chloe walked towards the restroom.

She unexpectedly spotted Anna.

A smirk played on her lips.

She approached slowly. "Executive Assistant Ross, what a coincidence."

Anna looked up at the sound.

Chloe expected to see Lucas Evans.

But she froze abruptly upon seeing the man across the table.
###Chapter 197

Julian Garnache looked up and saw Chloe Valentine.

His movements paused slightly.

He set down his fork and knife.

A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips.

"Miss Valentine, what a coincidence."

Anna Ross's gaze shifted between the two of them.

She gently placed her cup down.

"Do you know each other?"

Chloe's face instantly turned pale.

Her fingers unconsciously tightened on the hem of her dress.

"Long time no see."

She forced a smile.

"Please, continue your meal. I should go."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and hurried away.

Her retreating figure was clearly flustered.

Anna looked at Julian.

"Have you met before?"

She noticed Chloe's unusual reaction.

Julian calmly picked up some food with his utensils.

"We crossed paths a few times abroad."

He gave a light smile.

"I didn't expect to run into her here."

Anna nodded thoughtfully.

She couldn't shake the feeling that Chloe's reaction was off.

Chloe rushed into the restroom.

Icy water ran over her wrists.

The mirror reflected a panicked face.

She gripped the edge of the sink tightly.

Her knuckles turned white from the pressure.

Why was he back?

And with Anna Ross?

If he talked about those things...

Her engagement to Adrian Sinclair would be over.

She had to avoid him.

She absolutely couldn't let him have a chance to speak.

She carefully took a detour back to her seat.

Her eyes scanned the area warily.

She only relaxed slightly after confirming it was safe.

Adrian looked up at her.

"Are you feeling unwell?"

He noticed her unusual behavior.

Chloe shook her head hurriedly.

"It's nothing. I just remembered some unfinished work."

She offered a strained smile.

"Could we leave early?"

Adrian set down his napkin.

"Let's go."

He stood and picked up his jacket.

Chloe immediately followed.

She kept her head down deliberately.

Her steps were so hurried they were almost a jog.
###Chapter 198

Adrian Sinclair ignored her exaggerated display.

His steps were steady.

But his peripheral vision suddenly caught sight of Anna Ross.

And the man sitting opposite her.

His knuckles tightened instantly.

A faint cracking sound was heard.

Chloe Valentine's face paled.

She hurriedly grabbed his arm, trying to pull him outside.

His gaze remained firmly locked in that direction.

His eyes were dark and terrifying.

Chloe's throat tightened.

Right now, she just wanted to leave quickly.

Her hatred for Anna Ross deepened another level.

She shot a fierce glare toward that table.

If Anna hadn't appeared.

She should have been enjoying a romantic dinner with Adrian.

Everything was ruined.

She was secretly gritting her teeth.

Adrian suddenly shook off her hand.

Chloe felt a pang of panic.

She quickly put on a gentle expression.

"Adrian, can you take me home?"

She shyly reached for his hand.

But he raised his hand to avoid her.

He hailed a taxi.

"You go back first."

His face was calm.

But his tone carried a suppressed anger.

Chloe bit her lip.

She understood he was staying for Anna.

But she couldn't run into Julian Garnache.

After weighing her options, she had to leave first.

"Then I'm going back. You rest early."

"Hmm."

His response was cold.

Chloe got into the car unwillingly.

Adrian turned around.

He narrowed his eyes, staring intently at the two people chatting happily inside the restaurant.

His thin lips pressed into a tight line.

Anna's mouth felt dry from eating.

She took a sip of red wine.

Immediately frowned.

She wasn't good with alcohol.

Julian chuckled.

"If you can't drink, why didn't you say so? I'll get you some water."

"Thank you."

She took the water glass.

"I've hardly ever drunk alcohol."

Julian looked surprised.

"Aren't you working now? You must drink a little during social events."

Anna shook her head.

"If I really drink, I'll probably pass out after one glass."

"It's good for girls to drink less."

Julian's tone turned low.

"Some things happened to me abroad, and I ended up drinking."

He threw his head back and finished his drink.

His words struck a chord with Anna.

If not forced, who would want to do things they dislike?

Growing up means learning things you originally couldn't.

Her voice was muffled.

As memories flooded her mind.

A waiter carrying soup passed by.

He was bumped by someone else.

The hot soup was about to spill.

Julian quickly pulled her into his arms.

The waiter barely managed to steady the bowl.

Anna hurriedly stood up.

She took a napkin and wiped him.

"Are you burned?"

The waiter apologized repeatedly.

Julian just said it was fine.

He took the napkin and wiped himself.

"I'm sorry."

She looked at the stain, feeling guilty.

If not for her, he wouldn't have gotten dirty.

Julian gave a helpless smile.

"Silly girl, I'm fine. Protecting my little sister is what I should do. Let's eat first."

Outside the window.

That gaze was piercingly cold.
###Chapter 199

Dinner ended.

Anna Ross walked out of the restaurant side by side with Julian Garnache.

A long-lost, relaxed smile graced her face.

That smile froze completely the instant she saw Adrian Sinclair.

Her steps halted.

Shock and a delayed sense of fear washed over her.

Why was he here?

Judging by his posture, he had clearly been waiting for a long time.

Had he seen all of her interactions with Julian?

Her lips parted slightly, but no sound came out.

Her fear of him was already deeply ingrained in her bones.

Julian beside her noticed her unusual behavior and leaned in with concern. "Anna, what's wrong?"

Anna shook her head blankly.

Adrian had already started walking toward them.

His tall, straight figure stopped firmly in front of them.

He spoke first, his voice suppressing anger. "You said you had to work. Why are you here?"

His gaze swept over Julian, cold and terrifying.

Anna's heart tightened.

She was desperately afraid he would say something he shouldn't.

She hurriedly bid farewell to the confused Julian. "Julian, you should head back first."

Julian warily assessed the man with the powerful aura before him, worried. "Let me drive you home. It's not safe at night."

He reached out to take Anna's hand, but she quickly avoided it.

Anna waved her hands repeatedly. "No, it's fine. I can get back myself."

She grabbed Adrian's sleeve and demanded, "You take me home."

Julian frowned and blocked their path. "Who are you? Why should she go with you?"

Anna explained before Adrian could erupt. "He's my boss. He'll take me back. Don't worry."

Watching her defend the other man, Adrian's expression grew even darker.

A storm was brewing in his eyes.

Julian was still uneasy, but Anna was already pushing Adrian to leave.

She left Julian standing alone on the spot, utterly bewildered.

Anna pulled Adrian away.

She only let go of his hand after confirming Julian wouldn't follow.

She looked at the man with the unpleasant expression and said softly, "Take me home."

Adrian let out a cold scoff.

But he still started the car.

Watching the restaurant fade into the distance, Anna breathed a slight sigh of relief.

"You care a lot about that man?" Adrian's jaw was tight as he broke the silence in the car.

His gloomy expression showed his displeasure.

Anna frowned.

She knew he had misunderstood again.

She explained seriously, "He's like an older brother from our neighborhood when I was little. Our families were close. He's always treated me like a younger sister. I only see him as a brother."

She secretly observed his expression and added, "There's really nothing between us. He just returned from abroad and came to see me, so I treated him to dinner."

"Brother?" Adrian sneered, clearly not believing it. "What a lofty term. You seem to care more about him than you ever did about Lucas Evans."

Anna rolled her eyes inwardly.

Since when had she ever cared deeply about anyone?

She wanted to argue, but thinking of his obsessive mindset, she swallowed her words.
###Chapter 200

He wouldn't believe anything she said anyway.

Silence was better.

She turned her face toward the window, refusing to look at him.

Her silent acquiescence enraged Adrian Sinclair.

His gaze was icy.

"Hit a nerve?" he sneered, voice cold. "You really are a fickle woman."

Anna Ross felt a sharp pang in her chest.

She closed her eyes, suppressing the turmoil within.

"Do whatever you want," she replied flatly. "My conscience is clear."

Adrian's brow twitched slightly.

He said nothing more.

"Take me home," she said, clutching her clothes. "I have work tomorrow."

She added, "If I'm late, someone will definitely make a scene."

The man ignored her.

The car didn't slow down.

Panic rose in Anna's chest.

"Stop the car!" she insisted. "I'll get back myself."

"Stay with me tonight," he commanded.

Her fingers tightened.

The refusal stuck in her throat.

Suddenly, she remembered something.

"Sophia is still at home," she said urgently. "You can't just take me away in front of her, can you?"

The embarrassment from last time was still fresh.

She didn't want a repeat.

Adrian let out a low chuckle.

Neon lights flickered across his sharp profile.

"Who said anything about taking you home?" he asked, lips curving.

His eyes were dark and unreadable.

Anna froze.

The city lights reflected in his mesmerizing gaze.

She quickly looked away.

Since she couldn't escape, compliance was her only option.

At least it would keep her mother safe.

The hotel lobby was dazzlingly opulent.

It hurt her eyes.

The front desk clerk took the black card with deep respect.

Their expression changed instantly.

When handing over the key card, their eyes held pure envy for Anna.

She lowered her gaze.

A man like him commanded attention everywhere.

The elevator mirrors reflected his tall, elegant figure.

His eyes remained locked on her.

The air felt thin.

She clenched her fingers.

It was worth it for her mother.

Having chosen to yield, there was no turning back.
###Chapter 201

The observation elevator offered a panoramic view of the glittering city at night.

Skyscrapers shone with countless lights.

Neon signs reflected against the dark sky.

Anna Ross stared silently out the window.

A wave of emotion washed over her.

The world of the wealthy was truly different.

She hesitated outside the Presidential Suite.

Her feet refused to move.

A deep sense of shame welled up inside her.

"What are you standing there for?" Adrian Sinclair turned to look at her.

His heavy gaze settled on her.

Anna took a deep breath.

She pushed the door open and entered the room.

The moment the door closed.

He grabbed her hand.

She gasped softly.

He pulled her toward the sofa.

Adrian pushed her down into the cushions.

He leaned over her, his presence overwhelming.

His eyes were cold.

"Anna Ross."

"You have so many men around you."

"One after another."

"What are you trying to do?"

His oppressive aura felt suffocating.

As if he wanted to devour her whole.

Anna shook her head in panic.

"You've got it wrong."

"It's not like that."

He lost his patience.

He pinned her shoulders down.

With his other hand, he loosened his tie.

He kissed her fiercely.

Anna closed her eyes.

Her hands clenched into tight fists.

She did not resist.

Adrian kissed her with brutal force.

It felt more like a punishment.

His sharp nose bumped against hers.

He stole the breath from her lungs.

Her entire world was filled with his scent.

Anna gradually went limp.

Sinking deep into the soft sofa.

Adrian refused to let her go.

He tangled his fingers in her hair.

Cradling her dizzy head.

Forcing her to endure the kiss.

It was like being caught in a storm.

She was powerless against it.

Her lips grew numb.

As if they no longer belonged to her.

"Mmm..." She pushed weakly against him.

Struggling to breathe.

The man showed no intention of stopping.

He bit her lower lip.

Anna's mind grew foggy.

Her eyelids fluttered.

Oxygen grew scarce.

She felt herself suffocating.

What an embarrassing way to die...

Adrian finally released her.

She gasped for air immediately.

Her consciousness slowly returned.

Before she could recover.

Adrian gripped her wrist.

"I'll ask one more time."

"Who was that man?"

His tone brooked no argument.

Anger burned in his eyes.

Anna's heart ached.

He had no trust in her at all.

She gritted her teeth.

Answering calmly.

"I've already explained."

"That's the truth."

Adrian stared deep into her eyes.

As if trying to see through her soul.

He let out a cold snort.

"If it was just a normal relationship."

"Why did he take the hit for you?"

Anna whirled around.

Just as she suspected.

He had been watching the whole time.

But she had done nothing wrong.

Whether he believed her or not was up to him.

"If you don't believe me, fine."

"I have nothing more to say."

She held his gaze steadily.

Adrian's brow furrowed deeply.

His grip tightened.

His thin lips pressed into a hard line.

Displeasure radiated from him.

She wouldn't even bother to explain now?

How dare she be so defiant.
###Chapter 202

Anna Ross studied his face, her voice tentative. "Are you jealous?"

The air froze instantly.

She held her breath, waiting for his response.

Adrian Sinclair let out a derisive laugh, his eyes filled with mockery. "Jealous? You think you're worthy of that?"

His slender fingers lifted her chin. "I just hate it when someone touches what's mine."

A cold glint passed through his deep eyes, as if he were looking at a joke.

Anna's heart stung.

So in his eyes, she was nothing but an object.

Those unwarranted hopes now seemed utterly ridiculous.

She stood up and straightened her clothes, her voice distant. "I should go."

As soon as she took a step, a force pulled her back.

The world spun, and she was thrown heavily onto the bed.

Adrian leaned over her, his breath scorching. "Tonight, you're mine."

"Trying to run?" He gripped her wrists. "Not your decision."

Anna struggled futilely, her fists pounding against his chest without effect.

Her eyes reddened, voice trembling. "I don't want to be with you right now!"

He pinched her chin, his grip ruthless. "Don't forget your place."

All her grievances and unwillingness finally dissolved into silent surrender.

In this bewildering night, she could only cling tightly to the person before her.

Adrian felt her compliance and gradually softened his movements.

His kisses fell like gentle spring rain.

The moonlight hid behind clouds, leaving only the sound of intertwined breaths in the room.

Morning light filtered through the curtains.

When Anna woke, she found herself still encircled in his arms.

She quietly turned her head to study his sleeping face.

Stripped of his sharp edges, he actually looked somewhat docile.

Just as she was lost in thought, his eyes suddenly opened.

She panicked and tried to escape, but he pulled her back effortlessly.

His thumb stroked her cheek, his voice lazy. "You performed very well last night."

"Keep it up."

Anna blushed instantly to the tips of her ears.

Remembering the absurdity of the previous night, she turned her head away, refusing to acknowledge him.
###Chapter 203

Adrian Sinclair chuckled softly, deciding to stop teasing her.

Anna Ross breathed a sigh of relief and gave him a gentle push. "Turn around. I need to get dressed."

He smirked, his tone suggestive. "Why so shy? There's not an inch of you I haven't seen."

Anna fell silent.

Arguing was a waste of time.
She gathered her scattered clothes and slipped under the covers to dress quickly.

Adrian leaned against the headboard, watching her flustered movements with amusement.

Anna shot him a glare, but her eyes caught on his bare chest.

The defined lines of his abs came into view.
Her ears grew warm, and she quickly looked away.

"My Executive Assistant seems particularly fond of looking at me today," he murmured, his voice low and teasing.

Anna gathered her hair, jumped off the bed, grabbed her bag, and rushed out of the room.

Morning traffic flowed steadily on the streets.
She hailed a taxi, hurrying home to change for work.

Her key turned in the lock, and she stepped quietly into the living room.

Sophia Roscente's door suddenly opened.

Their eyes met.
Sophia blinked, a sly smile spreading across her face. "You never came home last night~"

Anna's scalp prickled.
Why did this girl always catch her?

She forced composure. "I worked late and stayed somewhere near the office."
Her eyes, however, drifted away involuntarily.

Sophia moved closer, studying her. "You weren't with my cousin, were you?"
She tilted her head, wearing an expression that saw right through everything.

Anna's cheeks burned. "Stop guessing."
She quickened her pace toward the bathroom, but Sophia blocked her way.

"You're guilty!" Sophia laughed like a little fox. "I was just suspicious before, but now I'm a hundred percent sure!"

Anna retreated into the bathroom helplessly.
As she was squeezing toothpaste, Sophia's smiling face suddenly appeared in the mirror.

"Are you two together now?" she asked, eyes shining with anticipation.
Anna's hand stilled, the toothbrush hovering in mid-air.
###Chapter 204

Their relationship was nothing more than physical entanglement.

Talking about being together was pure fantasy.

Mistress.
What an ironic word.

Yet she had still reached this point.
Standing beside him.
But they could never go back to how things were.

She thought she had prepared herself mentally.
So why did her heart still ache?

Was she still hoping for reconciliation?
She felt ridiculous.
Just as Adrian Sinclair had said.
She was only his mistress.

Since he had drawn a clear line.
She shouldn't indulge in wishful thinking.

She curled her lips in self-mockery.
Turning to look at the person beside her.
She raised an eyebrow and asked, "Instead of worrying about me."
"Maybe you should focus on yourself."
"How are things with Marcus Hill?"

No matter what.
She had to sort out her chaotic emotions.
There would be no future for them.

The person suddenly questioned froze.
Stopping their probing.

Sophia Roscente pouted.
Leaning back against the bathroom counter.
She muttered, "Come on."
"This is just mutual harm!"

Even though she was an adult.
Talking about her love life still made her shy.

Anna Ross finished brushing her teeth.
Then carefully washed her face.
She spoke only after drying off. "I'm just concerned about you."
"How is that mutual harm?"
Looking at her annoyed expression.
Anna really wanted to pinch her chubby cheeks.

"By the way."
"Didn't your cousin ask you to tell your mother about returning home?"
"You should find a chance to tell her yourself."
"Before he snitches on you."

Hearing this.
Sophia became even more discouraged.
Waving her hand dejectedly. "I know."
"I just haven't figured out how to bring it up."

The thought of her mother's stern expression made her shiver.
She hugged herself tightly.

Anna smiled.
Tidied up the bathroom counter and prepared to change clothes.
Sophia's phone suddenly rang.
Anna glanced over.

Sophia nearly jumped.
Her expression one of impending doom.
Pointing at the phone, she exclaimed, "It's my mom!"
"Oh no, oh no."
"My cousin must have told her."

She threw the phone aside.
Not wanting to answer.

Anna shook her head.
Picked up the incessantly ringing phone and handed it back.
Comforting her, "Don't worry too much."
"Maybe she just wants to check in."

Sophia hesitated while looking at the phone in her palm.
Encouraged, she finally found the courage to answer. "Hello, Mom......"

Anna tactfully left.
Giving them space for their conversation.

After a quick tidy-up, she prepared for work.
Passing Sophia's room, she noticed she was still on the phone.
After a moment's thought, she decided not to disturb.

Thinking about the unresolved trouble at the company weighed heavily on her.

The security footage hadn't shown a clear face last time.
The person had deliberately avoided the cameras.
It seemed she needed another approach.

She had just arrived at her workstation when she received notice.
The project was temporarily suspended.
The incident seemed to have significant impact.

She sighed and sat down.
Then she saw Chloe Valentine walking toward the office with a girl, laughing and talking.
###Chapter 205

A colleague tapped her shoulder.

She pointed not far away.

She lowered her voice.

"See that girl?"

"She's a new intern at the company."

"Not even probation period was over."

"Suddenly got promoted."

"What methods she used."

"I don't need to spell it out."

Anna Ross fell silent for a moment.

She turned her attention back to work.

Such things were common in the workplace.

Others had that ability.

Outsiders shouldn't judge.

She just wanted to investigate the data breach now.

Other matters were none of her business.

She focused on her computer screen.

Her peripheral vision caught a figure moving.

She didn't pay attention at first.

The shadow gradually approached.

She looked up.

It was the girl from earlier.

"Hello."

"My name is Chloe Lombardi."

"Just promoted from intern."

"We'll be colleagues from now on."

"Please guide me."

Chloe Lombardi greeted warmly.

Her eyes curved into crescents.

The colleague nearby moved away disdainfully.

Clearly looking down on her methods.

Anna smiled politely.

"Hello."

"Anna Ross."

Chloe Lombardi nodded with satisfaction.

"You seem older than me."

"I'll call you Sister Anna from now on."

"Okay." Anna responded softly.

Chloe Lombardi continued.

"My desk is in front of yours."

"I might bother you often."

"Hope you don't find me annoying."

Anna was slightly taken aback.

This girl was overly familiar.

She seemed easy to get along with.

But Anna felt something strange.

A sense of discomfort lingered.

Before she could speak.

The colleague cut in directly.

"She might not be older than you."

"You actually look older."

"How can you call her sister?"

Chloe Lombardi's face instantly darkened.

Anna signaled the colleague to stop.

She looked at Chloe Lombardi.

"We're all colleagues."

"No need for formalities."

Chloe Lombardi smiled slightly.

She turned and returned to her seat.

The colleague kept muttering.

"It's just the truth."

"Can't even let people say it."

Anna wanted to advise her to say less.

She suddenly found Chloe Lombardi's back familiar.

As if she had seen it somewhere before.

She tried hard to recall.

But couldn't remember no matter what.

Chloe Valentine walked over quickly.

She spoke directly.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

"Don't say I didn't warn you."

"The project is suspended because of you."

"Better solve the data breach quickly."

"Delaying the cooperation progress."

"Can you bear the responsibility?"

Anna withdrew her gaze.

She responded calmly.

"You don't need to worry about this."

"I will communicate with the client."

Chloe Lombardi turned curiously.

She greeted Chloe Valentine politely.

She asked with concern.

"What happened?"

"Can I help?"

Anna was somewhat surprised.

She was actually so enthusiastic.

But she couldn't help with this matter.

It was still a kind gesture.

She thanked softly.

"Thank you for your kindness."

"No need."

"This matter is very complicated."

She helplessly lowered her eyes.

Chloe Lombardi said regretfully.

"I see."

"Really sorry."

"Wanted to help you."
###Chapter 206

Chloe Valentine remained silent.

Her eyes held a hidden expectation.

A dismissive smile tugged at her lips.

"She wouldn't dare ask for help."

"The more people know."

"The more she'd be humiliated."

"Who would do something so foolish?"

Anna Ross keenly caught the mockery in Chloe Lombardi's eyes.

That fleeting smile vanished.

It was as quick as an illusion.

"I said I'll handle it."

Anna looked up.

Her voice was calm.

"Instead of mocking me here."

"Shouldn't you mind your own business?"

"Or are you just that free?"

Chloe Valentine's face instantly changed colors.

She flushed pale then red.

She stared at Anna in disbelief.

She hadn't expected such sharp words.

Still.

She was just a fish on the chopping block.

Not flopping for much longer.

Chloe shrugged.

She crossed her arms.

A cold smile played on her lips.

"Fine."

"Since you said so."

"I'll be waiting to see."

"Don't come crying when you fail."

"You'll have no one to blame."

She didn't bother hiding her schadenfreude.

She looked down with a light laugh.

Anna clenched the hem of her clothes.

She knew full well someone had tampered with her computer.

But she had no proof.

Right now, she had no way to defend herself.

She buried herself in work.

Ignoring the other woman.

Chloe found it boring.

She turned to leave.

Before going, she called out to Chloe Lombardi.

"Come to my office."

Chloe Lombardi stood up immediately.

"Okay."

Anna glanced over.

That retreating figure looked more and more familiar.

Wait.

Wasn't that the back from the surveillance footage?

She didn't dare jump to conclusions.

She decided to observe first.

From that moment on.

Her mind could no longer stay calm.

Her eyes locked on the direction of the office.

Waiting for the other to return.

Planning to find a way to fish for information.

A long time passed.

Chloe Lombardi finally returned.

Anna quickly lowered her head.

Pretending to be busy.

Once the other was seated.

She hesitated for a moment.

Then she called out.

"Chloe."

"I'm having some trouble with this spreadsheet."

"Could you take a look?"

Chloe Lombardi nodded cheerfully.

"Of course."

She walked over to Anna's side.

Moved the mouse.

Fixed the spreadsheet in a few clicks.

Anna feigned surprise.

"You're so good at this?"

"Thank you so much."

"No problem."

"Colleagues should help each other."

Chloe Lombardi was still smiling.

She handed the mouse back.

Anna took the mouse.

She looked down, thinking.

"By the way."

"You seem quite close with Director Valentine."

"Did you know each other before?"

Her palms were slightly sweaty.

She felt a little nervous.

Chloe Lombardi gave a brilliant smile.

She pulled over a chair and sat down.

"Director Valentine is actually very kind."

"When I started as an intern, I was just an invisible newbie."

"She gave me opportunities."

"She's helped me a lot."

"She's basically my benefactor."

Seeing the other was completely unguarded.

Anna felt slightly relieved.

She smiled.

"I see."

So it seemed.

The two were indeed familiar.

If her suspicion was correct.

This person was most likely the figure from the surveillance footage.
###Chapter 207

"Anna, if there's nothing else, I'll head back to work now." Chloe Lombardi smiled innocently, appearing like nothing more than a naive newcomer.

Anna Ross snapped out of her thoughts and thanked her once more.

As Chloe dragged her chair away, Anna noticed how her bent posture perfectly matched the figure in the surveillance footage.

A thought struck her. She decided to verify the evidence before reporting. She hurried to the security room, captured the crucial footage, and went straight to the CEO's office.

Adrian Sinclair had just finished a meeting. A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes when he saw her.

Anna immediately stated her purpose. "I have important information to report."

Adrian's gaze shifted slightly. He pushed the office door open. "Come in."

He casually took off his suit jacket and draped it over the chair back. Then he slowly rolled up his shirt sleeves.

When she remained silent, he raised an eyebrow. "Didn't you have something to say?"

Anna slid her phone across the desk toward him. "There's progress on the data breach. The new colleague in our department today—her silhouette is an exact match to the person in the surveillance footage."

She was about to add more details when Adrian already activated the intercom. He ordered Noah Watson to bring the person in immediately.

Anna was slightly surprised by his decisiveness.

Soon, Chloe was brought into the office. She swallowed nervously, her voice trembling. "Mr. Sinclair, you wanted to see me?"

Adrian tossed the phone in front of her. "Look for yourself. Is that you?"

Chloe's face instantly turned pale. Fine beads of sweat formed on her forehead.

Anna pointed to the surveillance image. "Even though you hid your face, your hair color gave you away. You're the only one in the entire office with dyed hair."

She added, "Your walking posture and the way you bend over are identical to the person in the footage."

Chloe's head snapped up. "You were testing me?"

Anna remained silent.

After a long pause, Chloe slumped in defeat. "I did it. Fire me."

Adrian's eyes turned icy cold. "As you wish. You won't find a place for yourself in New York ever again."

Chloe bit her lower lip hard, her lips turning white.

Anna pressed further. "Who put you up to this?"

"No one put me up to it." Chloe turned her face away. "Lucas's company rejected my application. Is it so strange that I wanted revenge?"

Anna frowned. This excuse was clearly prepared in advance.
###Chapter 208

Chloe Valentine's intentions were crystal clear.

Anna Ross walked up to Chloe Lombardi.

Her gaze was calm like still water.

"Director Valentine put you up to this, didn't she?"

Chloe Lombardi's face darkened instantly.

She glared fiercely at Anna.

Her voice was icy cold.

"No."

"I told you, this is my own revenge."

A flicker of anger passed through Adrian Sinclair's eyes.

He cut in sharply.

"Enough."

"I'm calling her over now."

Chloe Valentine pushed the door open.

The moment she entered, she shot Anna a cold, sharp look.

Then she immediately glued herself to Adrian's side.

Her voice turned sugary sweet.

"Adrian, you needed me?"

Chloe Lombardi's lips parted slightly.

She seemed to want to say something.

A single glance from Chloe Valentine silenced her.

Adrian looked at Anna.

"Ask whatever you need to ask. Now."

Anna suppressed her nervousness.

She looked directly at Chloe Valentine.

"The data breach has been investigated."

"It was done by this new colleague."

Chloe feigned surprise.

She turned to Chloe Lombardi.

"Why would you do such a thing?"

Chloe Lombardi hung her head low.

"I'm sorry. I've let you down."

A satisfied smile tugged at Chloe Valentine's lips.

She clung to Adrian's arm.

Her tone was full of false regret.

"To think we have someone like this in the company."

"She must be fired."

Anna pressed on calmly.

"Director Valentine, why did you approve her probation period early?"

Chloe Valentine toyed with her phone.

Completely unruffled.

"Of course it was because I recognized her talent."

"Any other questions?"

Anna clenched her jaw.

"Nothing else."

Adrian spoke up at the right moment.

"This matter ends here."

Anna said no more.

She understood his difficult position.

Chloe Valentine was, after all, his fiancée.

Chloe Lombardi was fired.

Chloe Valentine shot Anna a triumphant glance.

As if flaunting her privileged status.

Anna left quietly.

She ran into Lucas Evans on her way downstairs.

She intended to avoid him.

But he called out to her first.

"Anna, what a coincidence."

Anna stopped.

She decided to tell him the outcome.

"The data breach has been cleared up."

"It was done by a new employee."

She swallowed all her grievances.

Not mentioning Chloe Valentine at all.

Lucas's smile was as warm as sunlight.

"I always believed in you."

"I'm glad it's resolved."

She remained silent.

A thorn seemed lodged in her heart.

"Mr. Evans, what a coincidence."

"I need to speak with you."

They both looked up.

Adrian approached with one hand in his pocket.

His gaze fixed on her.

Lucas watched him warily.

"About what?"

"I'm reassigning this project's lead."

His tone was detached.

Lucas gave a cold laugh.

"I insist on working with her!"

"I said no!"

Adrian didn't back down an inch.

The atmosphere instantly turned tense and hostile.
###Chapter 209

Anna Ross was caught between the two men, trapped and helpless.

Whenever these two met, the air instantly crackled with tension.

Lucas Evans withdrew his gaze, focusing back on Anna. His tone was firm. "This project is critical. Changing personnel now will disrupt the timeline. I'm sure Mr. Sinclair wouldn't want the company's interests harmed?"

"You worry too much." Adrian Sinclair pulled Anna to his side, his movement leaving no room for refusal. "Such a minor loss means nothing to me."

She stood rigid, afraid to move. In that moment, she felt like an object being fought over, stripped of all autonomy.

Before Lucas could respond, Adrian toyed with a strand of her hair. His voice was lazy yet carried undeniable pressure. "Final warning. She will no longer handle this project. If you insist, consider our cooperation terminated."

Lucas clenched his fists, his eyes burning with fury at the hand touching her.

Seeing this, Anna stepped forward. She looked at Lucas. "Someone more suitable will take over the project. This is best for everyone."

She desperately wanted out of this conflict. Moreover, Adrian had explicitly warned her to stay away from Lucas. If anything else happened, he would not let it slide.

Adrian chuckled softly, pleased with her stance.

Lucas stared at her in disbelief, convinced she was being coerced. The instigator was clearly the arrogant man beside her.

"Anna, are you..." He tried to persuade her, but was interrupted by the hurried arrival of Chloe Valentine. She had seen the trio from afar and came to investigate.

Especially Anna, daring to openly cling to Adrian Sinclair. It was disgusting.

She forced a sweet smile, feigning innocence. "What are you all discussing? It seems quite lively."

She positioned herself next to Adrian, deliberately separating him from Anna. This gave Lucas an opening. He reached for Anna, but she swiftly avoided his grasp.

Adrian raised an eyebrow and顺势 gave an order. "Chloe, you will take over this project."

Though confused, Chloe, wanting to maintain her obedient image—especially in front of Anna—immediately agreed. "Of course. I'll do whatever you say."

Lucas started to object, but Anna stopped him with a look. He suppressed his displeasure and reluctantly agreed.

Looking down at her, he suddenly realized his persistence might only bring her harm.

"I have matters to attend to. See yourself out, Mr. Evans." Adrian glanced at them both before turning to leave. Chloe quickly followed, her steps light.

Lucas adjusted his mood, forcing a smile. "Anna, have dinner with me after work?"

She looked up and met Adrian's icy gaze from across the room. A shiver ran down her spine. His warning echoed in her mind, chilling her to the core.

Finally, she refused softly. "No, thank you. I have to go to my job at the bar. I should get going."

Lucas watched her hurried departure, his heart aching. But he wouldn't give up. For these feelings, he had to persevere.

Anna, one day you will understand my heart.

He stood there, watching until her figure disappeared around the corner, before leaving dejectedly.
###Chapter 210

The company was vast and bustling with activity.

Yet without her presence, everything felt hollow and dull.

Anna Ross was about to return to her workstation when her phone rang.

It was Adrian Sinclair, demanding she come to his office immediately.

"Return to your position as my Executive Assistant."

He lounged on the sofa, legs crossed, his posture relaxed.

Anna's fingers trembled slightly, resistance welling up inside her.

These days away from him had finally allowed her to leave on time and breathe the air of freedom.

Noticing her silence, Adrian's tone turned cold. "You're unwilling?"

"I'll move back right away." She forced a smile, suppressing her emotions.

He said nothing more, lowering his head to review documents.

As Anna turned to leave, her phone rang from her bag—her mother was calling.

She answered hastily, accidentally hitting the speakerphone button.

"Anna, Mom's in New York!"

"Really!?" Her face instantly lit up, her voice cheerful. "Wait for me, I'll come get you!"

The man beside her watched her profile.

That vivid smile actually made him dizzy.

He hadn't seen her so happy in such a long time.

She grabbed her phone and made to run, but he pulled her back.

"Let go. I need to pick up my mom." She frowned, struggling.

Adrian tightened his grip, his tone flat. "I'll go with you."

"Unnecessary." She tried to pull her hand away, but he held on tighter.

She suddenly remembered a night many years ago.

A young man had once held her fingers, kissing them, saying he could never hold them enough.

Now these same hands offered only a cold restraint.

He leaned in closer, his gaze sharp. "Your uncle might be with her. Can you handle that alone?"

She fell silent immediately.

He took advantage, pulling her toward the elevator without room for refusal.

The station was swarming with people.

They stood at the exit, drawing countless sidelong glances.

Whispers floated past, all about them being a "perfect match" and "easy on the eyes."

Anna turned her face away, her ears burning.

Adrian, however, remained completely unruffled, as if accustomed to such attention.

"Anna!" Vivian Lowell waved, dragging her suitcase.

Anna rushed over joyfully, but then she spotted Howard Lowell beside her mother.

He had indeed come.

Howard completely ignored her, his eyes going straight to Adrian behind her.

A calculating glint flashed in his eyes.
###Chapter 211

Adrian Sinclair's lips curved into a faint smile as he gave a slight nod.

Yet, a layer of frost gathered in his eyes.
This old fox had indeed followed them.

Howard Lowell quickly stepped forward, his smile ingratiating yet insincere.
"Adrian, I'm truly surprised. I didn't expect you to come pick us up personally. That's extremely thoughtful of you."

"You flatter me, Uncle."
His gaze swept past Anna Ross, meaningful.
"My cousin has been very dedicated working under me. As her superior, looking out for my subordinate is part of my duty."

Howard secretly clenched his fist.
These words clearly implied he wasn't the reason for this visit. It was a deliberate slight.

Anna paid no mind to their veiled exchange.
She linked arms with her mother and took the luggage.
"Mom, I'm so happy you're here. How have you been in San Francisco lately? Is your health good?"

Vivian Lowell's heart softened at her daughter's attentive manner.
"Silly child, Mom is perfectly fine. See? I'm full of energy."

Anna actually wanted to ask if Howard had been giving her mother trouble, but she swallowed the words.

Vivian, however, was secretly observing Adrian.
Though she knew about Howard's behind-the-scenes schemes, she hadn't expected the two to appear so familiar now.

Adrian noticed her gaze but didn't comment.
He turned to Howard.
"Uncle, Aunt, have you arranged accommodation for this trip? Or are you planning to return to Grandpa's estate?"

But the branch company was currently troubled.
He likely didn't have the nerve to go back.

Sure enough, Howard hesitated.
"Well... We won't be going back for now. We'll stay at a hotel for the next couple of days."

Adrian raised an eyebrow meaningfully.
Howard quickly changed the subject.
"It's getting late. Let's get going first."

Naturally, no one objected.
The group got into Adrian's car.
Howard took the passenger seat.
Anna and her mother settled into the back.

She nestled close to her mother, whispering private conversation.
The two in the front also chatted amiably—though it was mostly Howard forcing the conversation.

Somehow, the topic suddenly turned to Anna.
Howard maintained his insincere smile.
"Adrian, this girl Anna hasn't been causing you any trouble, has she?"

"If she makes any mistakes, please don't go easy on her because she's your cousin."
"Scold her as needed. That's how she'll improve."

Adrian met her eyes in the rearview mirror, his lips quirking playfully.
"Little cousin's professional skills are outstanding. I'm very satisfied."

Anna lowered her eyes and tightened her grip on her mother's hand.
She thought he would seize the chance to make things difficult.
Unexpectedly, his response was perfectly normal.

Howard was also taken aback.
He then gave a dry laugh.
"That's good. If she has any shortcomings, I hope you'll guide her more."

"Naturally."
Adrian focused on driving ahead, not looking at him.
"Uncle, Aunt, you haven't eaten yet, have you? Let me take you for a meal first."

Howard readily agreed.

The restaurant arrived quickly.
He had specifically reserved a private room.
When the door closed, the outside noise was completely shut out.

Adrian lazily leaned against the table, hands folded.
His posture was casual, yet it couldn't hide his sharp edge.
Anna sat beside her mother, directly across from him.
She occasionally met his deep gaze but always looked away first.
###Chapter 212

Howard Lowell observed everything with a hidden sense of satisfaction.

So there really was something going on between these two.

"Adrian, the branch office was suddenly investigated recently. Have you heard anything about it?" He feigned confusion, frowning slightly.

Adrian Sinclair paused briefly while picking up food with his fork and knife.

He didn't answer immediately.

They both knew the truth. There was no need to ask.

Since the other wanted to play dumb, he was happy to play along.

"I haven't heard anything either." He chewed his food slowly, his brow slightly furrowed. "I didn't expect something like this to happen. The branch office wasn't found to have any problems, was it?"

Howard's expression darkened instantly.

The instigator dared to ask such a question to his face. It was clearly meant to mock him.

"No, the investigation was halted midway." He downed a glass of wine, trying to suppress his anger.

Anna Ross kept her head down, eating quietly while inwardly marveling at their acting skills.

They were both pretending to be clueless.

But it seemed Adrian had made her stepfather eat humble pie again.

A strange sense of satisfaction rose in her heart, as if someone had avenged her.

Halfway through the meal, Adrian set down his utensils and elegantly pulled out a napkin.

"Aren't you going to see Grandpa while you're here? He often mentions you. He must miss you a lot."

His movements while wiping his mouth exuded an air of nobility. Anna couldn't help but admire it inwardly.

Howard forced a dry laugh. "I won't disturb his rest today. I'll visit him tomorrow."

The old man didn't miss him. He was clearly waiting to reprimand him.

He needed to speed up his plans. Otherwise, everything in the Lowell family would really fall into this guy's hands.

Seeing Adrian fall silent, he quickly changed the subject.

"Adrian, thank you for taking care of Anna here. Let me propose a toast to you."

Anna's heart tightened. She didn't understand why he had to drag her into this.

But now wasn't the time to say anything.

The man across from her, however, seemed intrigued.

He raised an eyebrow at her, a slight smile playing on his lips. "You're too kind, Uncle. Taking care of my cousin is only natural."

He deliberately drew out the last word. The ordinary term of address took on a different meaning coming from him.

Anna buried her head deeper, ignoring his deliberate provocation.

Vivian Lowell added more food to her plate.

She continued eating in silence.

Howard observed for a moment, feeling increasingly certain.

If this was really the case, things would be much easier going forward.

Adrian saw through his thoughts and smirked coldly.

He swirled his red wine glass leisurely. "Uncle, what brings you to New York so suddenly?"

Howard was momentarily speechless.

The air suddenly grew tense.

Vivian, afraid of giving anything away, smiled calmly. "It's nothing important. I just missed Anna and came to see her."

Anna stared at her mother, lost in thought.

She knew perfectly well their visit was far more complicated than that.
###Chapter 213

Howard Lowell quickly agreed. "Yes, we came specifically to see her." He then focused on his meal, deliberately avoiding further conversation, though his expression was grim.

Adrian Sinclair's gaze turned cold. He did not respond.

The dinner concluded in a tense atmosphere. The two of them escorted the elders to their hotel.

Anna Ross held her mother's arm tightly, her eyes slightly red. "Mom, I don't want to be apart from you."

She desperately wanted her mother to live with her, but Sophia Roscente was still in the apartment. There simply wasn't enough space.

"Silly child, Mom is right here in New York now. You can see me whenever you want." Vivian Lowell gently stroked her daughter's hair, her gaze soft and tender.

"But..." Anna still worried about her mother staying with Howard Lowell.

Adrian Sinclair noticed her rare display of vulnerability. A faint smile flickered in his eyes. "Cousin, it's getting late. They've had a long journey and should rest early."

The term of address made her pause. He hadn't called her that since they arrived in New York.

Vivian Lowell soothingly agreed. "Adrian is right. You should head back first. I'll contact you after I've unpacked."

Anna reluctantly let go. She had just moved to Adrian's side when Howard, who had been silent, suddenly spoke. "Anna, come here for a moment. Your father has something to say."

She closed her eyes, suppressing the disgust in her heart. Her gaze swept over her busy mother. Ultimately, she turned and walked back.

Adrian's brow furrowed instantly.

Howard feigned sudden realization and smiled. "Adrian, if you have matters to attend to, please go ahead."

Young people were still too inexperienced. What could they really do, no matter how sharp-tongued?

Adrian slowly turned the jade ring on his finger. He responded calmly, "Then I shall take my leave."

As he turned, his gaze lingered on her for a brief moment. The door closed softly behind him.

Once Adrian left, Howard immediately dropped his fake smile. He slumped onto the sofa, his voice cold. "What's the progress with Adrian Sinclair recently? Any changes regarding the engagement with the Valentine family's daughter?"

She remained standing, coldly staring at his balding head. "There is no possibility between us. I don't have the ability to win him over."

"As for the engagement, there's no news at all. It seems nothing is finalized yet."

The moment she finished speaking, he slammed the table angrily. "Useless! Can't even secure a man. What a waste of that pretty face!"

He had thought it was already settled. It seemed he had overestimated her.

The noise startled Vivian. She rushed to her daughter's side, fearing her husband might become violent.

Pulling her daughter to sit down, she softly urged, "Howard, let's talk properly. There's no need for anger."

Anna showed no fear. If her mother weren't under his control, she would never tolerate this!

Howard rubbed his temples and issued a sharp order. "No matter what, you must secure him. Ruin the Valentine family's engagement!"

Anna was about to retort when her mother subtly pressed her hand, shaking her head slightly.

They must not provoke him.
###Chapter 214

Anna was about to speak.

Adrian stepped forward, shielding her completely.

His tall frame stood protectively between them.

His gaze turned icy as he looked at Chloe.

"Say what you need to say, Ms. Valentine."

Chloe immediately swallowed her words.

She could never act arrogantly in Adrian's presence.

Pursing her lips, her eyes flickered over Anna behind him.

"Remember your promise to the Chairman."

With those words, she turned and walked away.

The click of her high heels faded into the distance.

Anna kept her eyes downcast.

She didn't ask about the meaning behind those words.

"Finished for the day? Let's go home."

Adrian's voice softened considerably.

Anna gave a slight nod.

Adrian drove himself today without calling his driver.

They stopped by the supermarket on their way home.

Picking up fresh vegetables and fruits.

Back at the Bay Area residence.

They prepared dinner together in the kitchen.

A simple meal of three dishes and soup.

During dinner, Anna hesitated for a long time.

Finally, she set down her fork and knife.

"Please take back my system access."

Adrian looked up at her.

"Why?"

"The partners won't trust me."

Her voice was quiet, filled with self-doubt.

After the recent data breach, anyone would be wary.

Adrian's expression turned serious.

"If I say you're capable, then you are."

Anna tried to say more.

But he cut her off.

"I'm the decision-maker here."

"I believe in your abilities."

"The company's interests come first."

"I would never jeopardize the business."

His tone was firm and left no room for argument.

Anna remained silent for a moment.

"But protecting me like this..."

"It puts too much pressure on me."

Adrian placed a piece of ribs in her bowl.

"Eat more."

"You'll need energy for the heavy workload ahead."

Anna stared at the food in her bowl.

Suddenly, she spoke softly.

"Please don't be so kind to me."

Her grip tightened on her utensils, knuckles turning white.

"I don't deserve it."

Adrian studied her for a long moment.

His voice deepened with tenderness.

"You have no idea."

"How much joy it brings me."

"To do these things for you."

Anna froze, a bittersweet ache spreading through her chest.

Adrian shook his head gently.

"There's no rush."

"We can take things slowly."

After dinner, Adrian received an urgent call.

An emergency situation required an immediate online meeting.

Anna returned to the study.

She opened her laptop to organize documents.

Her eyes accidentally caught the date in the screen's corner.

The 23rd.

She suddenly froze.

Her period was nearly a week late.

It was always regular before.

Frowning, she thought for a moment.

Finally, she sighed in resignation.

The recent stress had been overwhelming.

Even her body was sending warnings.

This couldn't continue.
###Chapter 215

Anna Ross hugged her mother gently.

Her voice was muffled.
"Mom, I'm heading back now. Please take care of yourself."

Vivian Lowell nodded.
She walked her to the door.
She didn't close it until she saw Anna step into the elevator.

The elevator doors slid shut.
The weight in Anna's chest grew heavier.
These burdens were crushing her.
If she could,
she would flee this place immediately.

She reached the hotel entrance.
Like a wilted flower,
she hung her head and pulled out her phone to call a ride.

A car horn sounded ahead.
She looked up.
Adrian Sinclair's car was idling in front of her.
He leaned lazily against the window.
"Get in. I'll drive you home."

The evening breeze brushed her cheeks.
Her eyes felt warm.
Had he been waiting here for her all this time?

So he hadn't left.
He had stayed here, waiting for her.

Seeing her distressed state,
Adrian's gaze shifted.
Irritation churned within him.
That old fox, Howard Lowell!
He clenched his fists,
veins bulging on the back of his hands.

Noting his dark expression,
Anna quickly composed herself and got in the car.
Now was not the time to anger him.

She stared out the window.
The scenery blurred past.
No matter how beautiful the city was,
it couldn't soothe her wretched mood.

No one considered her feelings.
No one asked if she was willing.
She felt like a bird trapped in a cage.
Those outside
only forced upon her what she didn't want.

She leaned slowly against the window.
She hoped the wind could blow away the suffocating pressure inside.

Adrian's eyes swept over her.
The evening wind lifted her long hair,
sending it dancing in the air.

Noticing her disheveled hair,
Anna casually gathered it up and tied it back.
It was just a simple motion,
but Adrian found himself captivated.

Yet the shadow clouding her face
continued to bother him.

He looked away.
He drove in silence.
He asked calmly,
"He deliberately sent me away earlier.
What did he say to you?"
Even he didn't notice
the obvious anger in his own voice.

Anna's heart trembled.
She felt the fear of being caught doing something wrong.
But then she thought,
he was so clever.
He must have already guessed.

Howard's intentions were so obvious.
If it weren't for something specific,
he wouldn't have sent Adrian away.

But talking to him now
made her feel flustered.
She struggled to find her voice.
"He...
just asked about daily life.
Nothing else."

Her voice held a tinge of bitterness.
Right now, she just wanted a quiet place.
She didn't want to say anything.

Adrian saw through her lie instantly.
It angered him.
He was angry she wouldn't tell him anything.

Before, no matter what happened,
she would always run to him.
If she felt wronged, she'd bury herself in his arms,
seeking his protection.

Now she was pushing him away.
This feeling
left him deeply unsettled.

If possible,
he wished she would rely on him a little.
Even just a little...

Right now,
it seemed he had no way to handle her.

Adrian looked ahead.
"Do you have some kind of leverage in his hands?"

Anna was startled again.
This time, she didn't turn around.
She didn't dare.
She was afraid he'd see her shame.
She only replied flatly,
"No.
This isn't some TV drama.
There isn't so much scheming.
You're overthinking it."
###Chapter 216

The man beside her let out a low scoff.

"You probably don't know this."

"This uncle of mine."

"Used to idle around."

"Squandering the family fortune every day."

Anna Ross turned to look at him.

She hadn't expected him to share these things.

Adrian Sinclair glanced at her sideways.

His gaze returned to the road ahead.

"Grandpa was very disappointed."

"He reprimanded him many times."

"Sending him to the San Francisco branch this time."

"Is to temper him."

"It's also giving him a chance."

His voice turned colder.

"But he doesn't strive to improve."

"All those shameful things he does behind the scenes."

"Leaving others to clean up his mess."

Disgust flashed in his eyes.

These matters could be set aside for now.

But if he truly dared to threaten her secretly.

He would not let it slide.

Anna stared at him blankly.

A strange feeling stirred within her.

This was the first time he had spoken so much.

And it was to complain about Howard Lowell.

In this moment.

She desperately wanted to glimpse his true thoughts.

Was he concerned about her?

"Why are you telling me this?"

"It would be better if I didn't know these things."

"He is still my elder, after all."

Her fingers twisted tightly together.

She didn't dare look up.

Anna's thoughts were in turmoil.

For someone as cold as him.

Sharing this was truly rare.

His deep voice reached her.

"I just want you to see his true character."

"The person you're going to such lengths to help."

"Is utterly unworthy."

She lowered her head even further.

Didn't she already know he was unworthy?

If it were simply about helping him.

She would never do these things.

But this wasn't about helping him.

It was about helping herself.

She had nothing left.

Her mother was her only concern.

For her mother's sake.

She had to do this.

No matter how unwilling she was.

"There's no question of worth."

"Since we're family."

"We should help each other."

Even she found it ridiculous.

Anna composed herself for a moment.

She sniffled softly.

Lifting her head, she gazed out the car window.

The city's nightscape was beautiful.

Without all these troubles.

She should be living happily.

But these beautiful things.

Had nothing to do with her.

Adrian watched her intently.

It was already so obvious.

Yet she still pretended nothing was wrong.

How foolish.

He tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

His voice was low.

"Don't forget I'm your superior."

"You're under my care."

"If you face any difficulties."

"You can always come to me."

If possible.

I could also become your support.

He glanced at her almost imperceptibly.

Quickly averting his gaze.

That simple sentence.

Echoed endlessly in her ears.

As if set on repeat.

She turned her head dazedly.

Looking at his calm profile.

Her heartbeat quickened unconsciously.

Did he mean.

He would help her?

This question.

Lingered in her mind for a long time.

She never dared to voice it.

Some questions.

Were better left unanswered.

Let her be greedy just this once.

For this rare warmth.
###Chapter 217

"Aren't you going to the bar tonight?" Adrian Sinclair's gaze swept over her.

Anna Ross replied softly, "I asked for time off when I left the station."

A delicate silence settled inside the car.

Neither spoke again.

The car stopped outside her apartment building.

She was about to thank him.

But she noticed he was staring intently in a certain direction.

She followed his line of sight.

Her breath caught.

Sophia Roscente and Marcus Hill.

They were locked in a tight embrace.

Anna held her breath.

Why did she keep running into them like this.

Adrian's expression was terrifyingly dark.

The sound of a seatbelt unbuckling echoed.

He was about to push the car door open.

His face was cold and frightening.

Instinctively, Anna grabbed his sleeve.

"Don't go down," she whispered, trying to dissuade him.

He truly couldn't tolerate it at all.

His cousin dating someone was like a crime to him.

No wonder Sophia was so afraid of him.

Meeting his icy stare.

Her heart trembled.

But she still held onto him firmly. "Since you agreed to it, why disturb them now?"

He settled back into the driver's seat.

He glanced at the embracing couple downstairs.

His expression softened slightly.

Anna released his sleeve.

She sat quietly.

Better to wait for them to leave before getting out.

After this incident.

She actually felt a bit more at ease.

Adrian was still watching them.

His voice was low. "I never expected them to be together."

"I've always treated her like my own sister."

"Every time I see something like this, it's hard to accept."

Anna remained silent.

The cousin he doted on.

Was taken by his own friend.

Anyone would find it difficult.

A soft sigh came from beside her.

He leaned back into his seat.

He closed his eyes.

Out of sight, out of mind.

But his furrowed brow.

Betrayed his displeasure.

Anna hesitated for a moment.

She spoke softly, "She has to grow up eventually."

"Sooner or later, she will date."

"You can't chase away every boy around her."

Adrian opened his eyes.

He looked at her.

Anna continued, "Compared to a stranger."

"Isn't someone you know well better?"

The corner of his brow twitched slightly.

A hint of a smile appeared in his eyes.

Anna looked down, puzzled.

He spoke in a low voice, "You're right."

"She should walk her own path."

"I can't be with her forever."
###Chapter 218

"Thank you." He gazed at her, his voice low and earnest.

Anna Ross was taken aback for a moment. She turned to meet his eyes. The corners of his lips lifted into a faint smile. A trace of elusive tenderness flickered deep within his profound gaze.

He was actually smiling at her.

Her heartbeat accelerated suddenly. Her vision seemed glued to his face. That face felt like it was slowly emerging from memories sealed away for years.

The atmosphere grew subtly suffocating. She almost had the illusion he would lean in to kiss her the next second. Flustered, she straightened up and turned toward the car window.

A brief silence fell inside the car.

The man's husky voice sounded again.

"Back then, was it really just about the money?" Adrian Sinclair stared at her intently. His gaze was sharp as a blade, as if trying to slice open her heart to find the answer.

That look was too scorching. Anna felt completely exposed.

Her heart pounded wildly, almost bursting out of her chest. Countless words clogged her throat, yet she couldn't utter a single one.

A thin mist blurred her vision. She tilted her head back, desperately suppressing the surging emotions.

This question was like a poisoned thorn. The slightest touch made it bleed profusely.

She didn't dare to respond.

A long, drawn-out silence spread through the car.

Adrian slowly leaned back into his seat. The last glimmer of light in his eyes extinguished. A self-mocking curve tugged at the corner of his mouth. What had he been expecting anyway.

"Get out." His voice was cold, laced with ice. The heavy night concealed the gloom in his eyes.

The tone was too frigid. Anna's heart felt violently torn. She bit her lower lip hard, refusing to let the gathered tears fall. Her body trembled uncontrollably.

"I..." She tried to speak, but the words stuck in her throat.

He glanced sideways, waiting for her explanation.

But Anna lowered her eyelids. She struggled to sound calm. "I'm sorry." No matter the myriad reasons, she was the one who had wronged him in the end.

She pushed the door open and got out. She didn't look back. She didn't hesitate. She walked straight into the night breeze. The cool wind brushed past the corners of her eyes. Teardrops fell silently, vanishing into the unseen darkness.

Adrian remained in place. He watched her retreating figure grow distant. He let out a heavy, turbid breath. He started the engine and drove away.

The car interior was deathly quiet. Only the flowing lights outside the window flashed past. Perhaps the night was too cold, or perhaps it was something else. A crimson hue gradually spread across his eyes.

Why did she never explain? It was like this three years ago. It was still like this now. Was her heart truly that hard?

If she just said one word. Just one. He would believe her without hesitation.

Was that so difficult?

He raised a hand to press against his lips. He struggled to suppress the grief threatening to breach its dam.

Amidst the traffic of the bustling city, his car slowly merged into the neon lights. Until it disappeared from sight.
###Chapter 219

Anna Ross walked for a while.

She couldn't help but look back.

The space behind her was empty.

That person was already gone.

Her heart felt like a heavy boulder was pressing on it.

The weight was immense.

She could barely breathe.

"Sis!"

Sophia Roscente's cheerful voice called out.

Anna hurriedly wiped her tears away.

She forced a smile.

Sophia ran up to her.

She was panting.

When she looked up, she noticed Anna's reddened eyes.

"What's wrong?"

Sophia's smile faded.

She examined Anna with concern.

Anna quickly shook her head.

"It's nothing."

"The wind was strong just now."

"Something got in my eye."

Sophia sighed in relief.

Then she grew tense again.

She glanced around nervously.

"My cousin didn't come, did he?"

She was worried about running into her cousin.

Even though he had said he wouldn't interfere.

She still felt her habitual fear.

Anna reassured her softly.

"He already left."

But her heart felt hollow.

Sophia immediately cheered up.

She linked arms with Anna and walked home.

Watching Sophia's lively figure.

Anna felt a pang of envy.

She wished she could be that carefree too.

They arrived home.

Sophia eagerly poured water.

She even offered to massage Anna's shoulders.

Anna stopped her.

"Go on."

"What is it this time?"

Sophia sat down with a grin.

"You always know me so well!"

She hesitated for a moment.

Then spoke in a low voice.

"Sis."

"Can you come with me to see my mom?"

Anna was stunned.

She almost choked on her water.

She coughed violently.

Sophia quickly handed her tissues.

Gently patting her back.
###Chapter 220

Anna Ross took a long moment to catch her breath.

The coughing fit had left her dizzy and disoriented.

She leaned back against the sofa, resting until she felt better.

"Sophia, I really want to help you."

"But it wouldn't be appropriate for me, an outsider, to join your meeting with your mother." Her voice was hoarse from coughing.

Sophia Roscente waved her hands urgently.

"No, it's fine!"

"My mother is very easygoing with people."

"You don't need to feel any pressure at all."

"She's only strict with me."

"This time I made a mistake."

"I'm truly too scared to face her alone."

"That's why I wanted you to come with me."

Her eyelashes fluttered slightly.

Casting faint shadows beneath her eyes.

Anna felt conflicted.

She had never met Sophia's mother before.

Showing up so suddenly would be rude.

Besides, when a mother and daughter talked.

Her presence would undoubtedly feel intrusive.

With that thought, she took the other's hand.

"Sophia, I have work tomorrow."

"I probably can't go."

Seeing her refusal.

Sophia pulled her hand back and wiped nonexistent tears.

She sighed pitifully.

"Sister, if you don't go with me."

"You might never see me again."

"Would you really let such a cute sister like me disappear?"

"Is it really that serious?" Anna frowned.

Though reluctant.

She began to waver.

If she were the one feeling nervous.

She would also want someone by her side.

Sophia cried even louder.

Rolling back and forth on the sofa.

"If it weren't serious, why would I beg you?"

"I think of you as my own sister."

"But you won't save me."

"My heart is breaking..."

Anna sighed helplessly.

She reached out and patted her.

"Alright, I'll go with you."

"Stop crying."

Those words worked like magic.

The person on the sofa instantly sat up.

Happily throwing herself into a hug.

"Sister, you're the best!"

"You're the greatest sister in the whole world!" She hugged her excitedly.

Almost planting a kiss on her.

Anna's eye twitched slightly.

She had a feeling she'd been tricked again.

Sophia held onto her tightly.

The two sat together watching TV for a while.

Anna suddenly remembered she hadn't asked for time off.

She returned to her room and picked up her phone.

She hesitated about calling.

Finally deciding to send a text instead.

Her fingers tapped out a few words.

She had just put down the phone to wash up.

When a message notification sounded immediately.

She opened it to look.

The other party had agreed without asking any questions.

Staring at the simple "Okay" on the chat screen.

She remained motionless for a long time.

Just gazing blankly at that word.

Earlier in the car.

The expectation in his eyes when he asked that question.

Later replaced by dim disappointment.

And loss.

She gripped her phone tightly.

Her nails making faint scratching sounds on the back.

It was like overturning a bottle filled with sorrow.

Her heart flooded with aching bitterness.

She had failed him.

But what good would telling the truth do?

The two of them.

Had long passed the point of no return.
###Chapter 221

Adrian Sinclair leaned against the headboard.

His phone screen glowed softly.

He had just finished showering.

Water droplets still dripped from his hair.

Seeing her message.

He replied immediately.

He didn't want to keep her waiting.

His robe hung loosely on his body.

The belt was tied in a casual knot.

Wet hair fell across his forehead.

Water trickled down his neck and into his collar.

He set his phone down.

And walked to the window.

The night sky was dotted with stars.

They reminded him of her eyes.

He recalled her resolute tone during their breakup.

That day, he saw her get into someone else's car.

But he knew.

Nothing had happened.

She left him.

There must be a reason.

But why wouldn't she tell him?

His thoughts were tangled.

He rubbed his temples.

A knock sounded at the door.

Adrian opened it.

Grandpa stood outside.

"Grandpa, you're still awake at this hour?"

Frederick Lowell glanced into the room.

"I wanted to talk with you."

Adrian helped his grandfather inside.

The old man patted his hand.

"I haven't been sleeping well these past few days."

"I heard you were back."

"So I came to see you."

Adrian closed the window.

The night breeze was chilly.

Grandpa had just recovered.

He couldn't catch a cold.

He poured a glass of warm water for his grandfather.

"Howard came to New York today."

Grandpa looked up in surprise.

"What did he come for?"

Mentioning Howard Lowell made the old man frown.

Other families had children who were ambitious.

His son only knew how to squander money.

He didn't even have a son.

He messed up the branch company.

Completely useless.

Adrian spoke calmly.

"He accompanied Vivian to see their daughter."

"It's been a long time since they met."

Grandpa stroked his beard.

"That girl named Anna Ross?"

Adrian lowered his head to drink water.

His hair covered his eyes.

He nodded slightly.

He didn't want to talk about her.

Grandpa was biased against her.

Fortunately, the old man didn't ask further.

He only sighed.

"Having a daughter is better than having nothing."

Not having a grandson.

Remained a regret.

At least he still had this grandson.

Grandpa's gaze was欣慰.

Adrian sneered inwardly.

That uncle.

Superficially friendly.

But probably hated him to the core.
###Chapter 222

His visit was far from innocent.

Though he claimed he was here to see Anna Ross.

Adrian Sinclair knew better.

He toyed with his phone idly.

"Grandpa, Uncle Howard will visit in the next couple of days."

The old man's expression soured.

But this was his son.

He couldn't avoid him forever.

"Alright. I understand."

"Adrian, you mentioned issues with the branch office last time."

"How did it go?" Grandpa's smile faded, turning serious.

Adrian's eyes darkened.

"Grandpa, the investigation into the branch has been halted."

The old man thought he was sparing his feelings.

"Adrian, I told you to proceed without hesitation."

"Don't worry about my reputation."

"Just handle it impartially."

"Those who make mistakes must face consequences."

"Otherwise, how will they learn?" His voice was firm and authoritative.

Adrian gave a slight nod.

His decision to stop wasn't for that reason.

If she hadn't begged him so desperately.

He would never have called off the investigation.

The memory of her abandoning her dignity.

Sent a wave of bitterness through him.
He wasn't even sure what he resented anymore.

Grandpa's low voice cut through his thoughts.

"Give serious consideration to the marriage with Chloe."

"The Valentines are pressing hard."

"They called again yesterday, hinting strongly about it."

Seeing his silence, Grandpa added.

"Chloe isn't a bad girl."

"Our families have been close for generations."

"Dragging this on isn't right."

Adrian's expression shifted almost imperceptibly.

"I understand, Grandpa."

"I will give it proper thought."

"And give you a satisfactory answer."

Grandpa finally relaxed.

"Hearing you say that puts my mind at ease."

He rose slowly and looked out the window.

Adrian moved to assist him, but was waved away.

"I can still move on my own."

"It's late. You've had a long day."

"Get some rest."

Adrian withdrew his hand helplessly.

He knew his grandfather's proud nature all too well.

As he left, Grandpa's gaze fell on the cigarette box.

He paused for a moment, but said nothing.

Then gently closed the door.

He remembered his grandson started smoking after that heartbreak.

He hadn't seen him smoke since taking over the company.

Was something troubling him again?

He sighed and turned away.

Young people's affairs were beyond his control now.

The room fell quiet again.

Adrian stretched his long legs, leaning back on the sofa.

He lit a cigarette.

The smoke rings dissipated slowly into the air.

The marriage with Chloe Valentine was the last thing he wanted to consider.

But refusing Grandpa was difficult.

He understood the old man's predicament.

Yet everything he desired.

He had never needed anyone's help to obtain.
###Chapter 223

The phone screen went dark.

No new notifications appeared.

The world fell into dead silence.

Why wouldn't she tell the truth?

Was there another secret hidden behind this?

Adrian Sinclair leaned back into the sofa.

He tilted his head, staring at the ceiling.

The cigarette between his fingers burned out.

He stubbed it out and walked toward the bed.

"I don't believe you're that kind of person." The words echoed in his mind.

Anna Ross tossed and turned all night.

Her chest felt heavy, as if blocked by a stone.

Strange dreams haunted her.

She barely fell asleep as daylight broke.

The alarm clock rang and was immediately silenced.

She pulled the blanket over her head.

Today was her day off.

Sleeping in felt like the greatest luxury.

She sank back into sleep, content.

"Whoosh—"

The curtains were yanked open.

Sophia Roscente's exaggerated voice exploded. "Sis, you're still sleeping! Did you forget what today is?"

Before Anna could cover her ears.

Sophia jumped onto the bed and threw back the covers. "Get up! The sun is shining on your butt!"

Anna opened her eyes, full of resentment.

Sophia took a step back, startled. "Were you stealing last night? Those dark circles are huge!"

Anna sat up with panda eyes.

"I had nightmares all night."

She leaned against the headboard, exhausted.

Sophia burst out laughing.

"Let me get you some water."

Only then did Anna feel her throat was dry.

Warm water soothed her throat.

Her mind cleared slightly.

"Sis, I didn't want to wake you..."

Sophia pouted, feeling guilty.

"But we have to go see my mom today..."

Anna smiled faintly.

"It's fine. I'll get ready and we'll go."

She stretched and walked into the bathroom.

Sophia paced back and forth like a shadow.

Anna felt dizzy trying to apply makeup. "Sophia, please sit down for a while."

Sophia bit her lip nervously and sat down.

She stared at the reflection in the mirror.

"I'm nervous. Moving around makes me feel better."

Anna finished applying her lipstick and glanced sideways.

"Let's go."

Sophia took a deep breath.

It was as if she were heading into battle.

Inside the taxi.

She gripped Anna's hand tightly.

Her nails left red marks.
###Chapter 224

"Sister, I think I'll wait a bit longer." Sophia Roscente clenched her fingers, her voice trembling. "I'm too scared to say it."

Anna Ross gently held her hand.

"Don't be afraid." Her voice was soft, yet carried strength. "Your mother disciplines you because she loves you. No one in this world cares more about you than she does."

She looked out the window.

Sunlight streamed through the car window, falling on Sophia's tense face.

"I'll be with you."

Sophia took a deep breath, as if making a firm decision.

She took out her phone and quickly dialed a number.

"Cousin." Her voice choked with tears. "I'm going to confess to my mom... Can you come?"

Anna's fingertips tightened slightly.

A low response came from the other end of the line.

She lowered her eyes, not catching the rest of the words.

Her heartbeat inexplicably quickened.

Sophia hung up the phone, her entire body relaxing.

"With Cousin here, my mom definitely won't dare to lay a hand on me." She smiled slyly, revealing two shallow dimples.

Anna hesitated to speak.

She remembered Adrian Sinclair's cold profile.

"Will he really help you?"

Sophia blinked.

"Probably?" She tilted her head uncertainly. "Anyway, having an extra person for courage is always good."

She leaned against Anna's shoulder like a spoiled child.

Outside the window, the scenery sped backward.

Anna recalled last night's brief encounter.

Her fingertips curled unconsciously.

"We're here." The driver reminded them.

The villa stood deep within the greenery.

Anna had heard of Sophia's mother.

A famous businesswoman in New York, decisive and efficient.

She was slightly lost in thought.

Such a life was once what she dreamed of.

"Let's go." Sophia took her hand.

A woman in a cheongsam sat in the living room.

Her back was straight, her demeanor graceful.

Sophia took a deep breath.

"Mom." Her voice sounded somewhat weak.

Cecilia Roscente turned at the sound.

Seeing her daughter, her brows suddenly furrowed.

"Sophia?" She stood up, her eyes full of astonishment. "Weren't you supposed to be abroad?"

Anna observed her quietly.

Elegant yet sharp.

Beautiful, but not easily approachable.

Footsteps sounded from behind.

All three turned their heads simultaneously.

Adrian Sinclair stood at the doorway.

His gaze swept past Anna, lingering briefly.

Anna looked away.

He also tacitly remained silent.

Cecilia's frown deepened.

"Adrian?" Her eyes moved between the two. "What on earth is going on?"
###Chapter 225

Sophia Roscente immediately hid behind Adrian Sinclair.

She pushed his back.

"Mom, you should ask my cousin," she said, her voice growing smaller.

She was panicking.

She could only hope her cousin would put in a good word for her.

Cecilia Roscente's face darkened instantly.

She pulled Sophia out.

"Ask your cousin? How would he know?" she demanded sharply. "Did you sneak back by yourself?"

Sophia looked like a frightened deer.

She glanced at Adrian for help.

"Cousin, say something!"

Adrian crossed his arms and remained silent.

Anna Ross's heart raced.

She couldn't figure out what he was thinking.

If he didn't step in to help,

Sophia would definitely be in trouble today.

Sophia secretly regretted her decision.

She shouldn't have counted on her cousin.

He was completely unreliable in critical moments.

Cecilia's gaze was piercing.

It made Sophia's scalp tingle.

"Mom, I actually—"

"Aunt, I brought her back," Adrian suddenly spoke.

Sophia immediately breathed a sigh of relief.

She secretly gave him a grateful fist bump.

Anna looked at him in surprise.

He actually lied for them.

This was completely unprecedented.

Cecilia's expression softened at once.

She showed a gentle smile.

"So that's how it is," she said warmly. "Don't just stand there. Come sit down."

Her gaze swept over Anna.

A flash of admiration passed through her eyes.

Sophia obediently followed.

Anna felt his gaze on her.

She pressed her lips together and quickly walked away.

Adrian sat down unhurriedly.

She instinctively moved aside.

He shot her a displeased look.

She pretended not to see it.

"Adrian, why did you suddenly bring her back?" Cecilia asked softly.

She doted on this nephew of hers.

It was just that her daughter always worried her.

She had been unwilling to go abroad from the start.

She even sulked and refused to contact anyone while overseas.

Now she suddenly returned.

It was inevitable that Cecilia would be somewhat angry.

She glanced at Sophia beside her.

Her daughter was happily eating fruit.

Clearly, she had already relaxed.

With her cousin vouching for her,

Her mother definitely wouldn't pursue the matter.

Adrian leaned back.

"I went to see her abroad last time," he said calmly. "I sat in on one of her classes."

"The teaching quality at that school is average," he continued. "It's better to bring her back to study domestically."

"It's inconvenient for her to be alone abroad," he said, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly. "It's better to take care of her back here."

He spoke as if it were the most natural thing.

As if he truly had his cousin's best interests at heart.
###Chapter 226

Sophia Roscente and Anna Ross looked up at him simultaneously, their eyes wide with surprise.

Anna immediately stood up to pour water for everyone, feeling a quiet relief that the crisis had been averted.

Cecilia Roscente pondered for a moment, then nodded slightly. "Adrian makes a good point." She turned to her daughter, her tone softening. "I'll let it go this time."

"You're the best, Mom!" Sophia threw herself into her mother's arms, grinning like a cat that got the cream.

Cecilia shook her head helplessly and tapped her daughter's forehead. "You must tell me everything immediately from now on. No more secrets."

Sophia nodded repeatedly, promising obediently, "I know I was wrong, Mom. I'll tell you everything from now on."

"Oh, and Mom, let me tell you about..." She leaned against her mother's shoulder and began sharing amusing stories from her life abroad.

Mother and daughter chatted animatedly. Anna silently finished her water, feeling increasingly restless. Just as she was about to pull out her phone, the person beside her leaned closer.

Warm breath brushed past her ear. "If you're bored, take a walk with me."

She looked up and met his deep, unreadable eyes. They were calm and gave nothing away.

She hadn't expected him to initiate conversation, especially since he'd been angry earlier.

Before she could respond, he stood up and walked away. Anna glanced at the engrossed mother and daughter and sighed softly.

She was indeed superfluous here. Some fresh air might do her good.

They walked out of the living room one after the other. The conversation on the sofa paused. Sophia took a bite of her apple and winked playfully. "Aren't you curious about who she is, Mom?"

Cecilia watched their retreating figures and took an elegant sip of tea. "She's very beautiful. Good demeanor too. I quite like her."

"Her relationship with my cousin is... special." Sophia gazed in the direction they had disappeared, a mysterious smile playing on her lips.

Oblivious to this conversation, Anna followed Adrian Sinclair through the hallway into the garden. He stopped before a cluster of roses, quietly admiring them.

Anna stood silently nearby. Remembering how he had deftly defused the situation earlier, she couldn't help but ask, "Sophia's mother seems to trust you implicitly. She didn't doubt your words at all."

Adrian turned and looked down, his voice low. "She and my mother were like sisters. They started the law firm together. It was their shared dream."

He gazed into the distance, his eyes dimming slightly. "After my mother passed, she was deeply affected. But family bonds don't change. So she believes me."

"Besides," he added casually, "I never lie."

Anna: . . . . . .

Then what were all those lies just now?
###Chapter 227

Anna Ross felt a surge of surprise.

She seemed to have missed too many things about him.

She took two steps forward.

Moving closer to him.

"Don't be too sad."

"Your mother wouldn't want to see you grieving." Her voice was almost inaudible.

She never heard about his mother's passing during university.

It must have happened after their breakup.

He lost both her and his mother during that time.

Anna's heart clenched violently.

The pain was almost suffocating.

She didn't dare look at him.

Unable to imagine how he survived those days.

Adrian Sinclair responded lightly.

"It's all in the past."

She looked up.

His profile carried a faint trace of melancholy.

He turned his head at that moment.

Their eyes met silently.

"Cousin!"

"Where did you two go?" Sophia Roscente's voice approached noisily.

She broke into a smile upon seeing them.

"So you're here."

"Come inside quickly. Mom is waiting."

She grabbed Anna's hand and pulled her back.

Anna glanced back and saw Adrian following them.

Only then did she relax.

Cecilia Roscente greeted them warmly in the living room.

"Good child, come sit here!" She pulled Anna onto the sofa.

She examined Anna's face with satisfaction.

"So pretty."

"You and Adrian make a perfect match."

Anna's cheeks burned.

She looked toward Sophia, who was snacking.

The other girl winked.

Indicating she had revealed everything.

Anna helplessly glanced at Adrian across from her.

Fortunately, his expression remained normal.

Cecilia patted her hand.

Then looked at Adrian.

"Come chat with me more often when you have time."

"It gets lonely by myself."

Adrian's eyes carried a smile.

He watched her leisurely.

Waiting for her response.

Anna paused briefly.

Not wanting to refuse the request.

She had to agree.

"Auntie, I will."

"I'll come visit with Sophia when we have time."

As soon as she finished speaking.

The man across from them raised an eyebrow.

His face showed displeasure.

His eyes clearly said.

You're twisting the meaning.

Sophia rested her chin on her hand thoughtfully.

Something felt increasingly wrong.

Mom clearly said Cousin should bring her.

How did it change so quickly?

Cecilia didn't say much more.

She only instructed.

"Everyone stays for dinner today."

"I'll go prepare now."

Adrian nodded calmly.

Anna naturally had no objections.

The three sat in the living room with own thoughts.

The room fell into silence.

Anna sat awkwardly.

She glanced at her cousin who was focused on her phone.

Hoping she would say something.

A faint sound reached her ears.

She looked up.

Finding the person across from her had leaned back on the sofa with closed eyes.

She relaxed slightly.

Soon the dinner table was set.

Cecilia ignored the other two.

She directly pulled Anna to sit beside her.

"Good child, eat quickly."

Behind them, Sophia exchanged an incredulous look with her cousin.

She couldn't believe her eyes.

In such a short time.

Mom was almost someone else's.

Adrian's lips curved slightly.

He sat down composedly.
###Chapter 228

Cecilia Roscente placed a piece of fish into Anna Ross's bowl.

She asked softly, "Anna, what do your parents do for a living? Are they also in New York now?"

The moment the words left her mouth.

The previously relaxed atmosphere at the dinner table instantly froze.

Anna Ross's fingers tightened slightly around her fork and knife.

She didn't know how to answer for a moment.

This identity remained her most painful and unspeakable secret.

Adrian Sinclair, sitting across from her, looked up.

His voice was calm as he interjected, "Aunt Cecilia, she's the daughter of Uncle Howard's remarried wife, the one I mentioned before."

"So... she's also your cousin?" Cecilia's expression changed abruptly.

Surprise and pity intertwined in her eyes.

She couldn't help but glance at Anna a few more times.

Such a beautiful and well-behaved girl.

It would have been so wonderful if she could be with Adrian.

Unfortunately, that seemed absolutely impossible now.

Anna lowered her head and silently ate her food.

But her utensils could no longer pick up any food.

Every bite felt difficult to swallow.

Cecilia was silent for a moment.

She then turned to Adrian. "I heard Grandpa arranged a marriage for you? Which family is the girl from?"

Although the question was directed at Adrian.

Her gaze still lingered on Anna.

Filled with an indescribable sense of regret.

Anna felt extremely uncomfortable.

She wished she could immediately escape this suffocating dinner table.

"I currently have no plans to marry." Adrian didn't even look up.

His tone was indifferent.

Anna looked up in surprise.

But she only saw his cold, hard profile.

He actually didn't mention Chloe Valentine at all.

If he wasn't willing to acknowledge her even in front of his aunt.

Perhaps he truly didn't want to get married.

This realization inexplicably eased her heart.

A faint sense of joy bubbled up.

Seeing that he didn't want to discuss it further, Cecilia stopped pressing.

The dinner table fell into silence again.

Sophia Roscente seized the moment to break the silence. "Mom, the food you made today is especially delicious!"

"If you like it, eat more." Cecilia smiled and served her more food.

The atmosphere finally eased a little.

After the meal.

Sophia leaned close to Anna and whispered, "Sis, I want to stay with Mom tonight."

Anna nodded gently. "Spend some quality time with your aunt."

She wished she could accompany her own mother like that.

Cecilia saw them to the door.

She carefully reminded them, "Be careful on the road."

She then smiled at Anna. "Anna, come visit again soon."

Anna obediently agreed.

She followed Adrian out the door, one after the other.

The air inside the car was stiflingly quiet.

She secretly glanced at him.

Hesitating to speak.

Her phone suddenly rang.

She saw the caller ID.

And answered softly, "Julian."
###Chapter 229

Hearing Julian Garnache's name, Adrian Sinclair frowned.

He turned his head to look at Anna Ross.

His expression instantly darkened.

A flicker of displeasure flashed in his eyes.

He slammed on the accelerator.

Anna was thrown back against her seat without warning.

She gasped and gripped the seatbelt tightly.

Cars outside the window blurred past.

Her heart pounded wildly in her chest.

It felt like a crash was imminent.

Yet he always skillfully avoided them.

She couldn't respond to the person on the phone.

She turned to look at Adrian Sinclair.

She was about to ask what his problem was.

Then she met his furious gaze.

He was staring at the phone clutched in her hand.

She froze.

Understanding dawned immediately.

Julian was still talking on the phone.

She spoke calmly, "Julian, I'm busy right now. I have to go."

The moment she pressed the end call button.

The car's speed returned to normal.

Anna was about to speak.

Her phone rang again.

Adrian glanced at the caller ID.

Anna's breath hitched.

Her heart raced with panic.

She was about to hang up.

A low voice came from beside her, "Answer it."
"He's so persistent. Wouldn't you disappoint him if you didn't answer?"

Anna answered the call helplessly.

Before her finger could touch the screen.

Adrian drawled lazily, "Put it on speaker."

She had no choice but to comply.

Julian's urgent voice came through immediately, "Anna, are you okay? I heard a noise. Are you in a car?"
Anna quickly explained, "I'm fine. I'm in a car. I just bumped my head."

A soft chuckle came from beside her.

She fell silent for a few seconds.

The voice on the phone sighed in relief, "That's good. Where are you? I want to see you. Do you have time?"
"No time!" she answered immediately.

The other end fell silent.

Anna added nervously, "I have to go back to work. I don't have time to meet."

She stole a glance beside her.

His expression was normal again.

The weight in her chest finally lifted.

Before she could relax.

Another voice came from the phone.

Julian laughed casually, "It's fine. I'll wait for you to finish work."
"How about this? I'll wait for you at the bar where you work. You won't have to rush."

Anna was caught in a dilemma.

She was trapped.

Adrian cleared his throat softly.

His eyes held a warning.

It felt like he would devour her whole if she agreed.

Perhaps due to the lack of response.

Julian's voice softened, "Anna, it's settled then. I'll wait for you."
Anna still wanted to refuse.

But he had already hung up.

He gave her no chance to reject him.

She looked at Adrian Sinclair.

She said helplessly, "You heard him. This isn't something I can solve just by refusing."
"Your Julian really can't live without you. It seems he likes you a lot," Adrian said darkly.
Anna held her ears in frustration.

He acted like every man in the world was trying to steal her from him.

Seeing her action.

Adrian frowned in displeasure.

But he couldn't do anything to her while driving.

"Where do you need to go? I'll take you," his tone returned to normal.
It was no longer as aggressive as before.
###Chapter 230

Anna Ross released her grip and answered softly, "Take me home. I took the day off."

A day off was rare. It was the perfect chance to catch up on sleep before her evening shift at the bar.

He drove in silence, taking her all the way to her doorstep.

The moment she stepped out of the car, it sped away.

She watched the taillights disappear, a wave of exhaustion washing over her.
He was always like this—hot and cold.

Back in her room, she collapsed onto the bed.
She had barely slept last night, and now the fatigue hit her hard.
She fell into a deep sleep and didn't wake until the sky was completely dark.

Hunger pangs stirred her. She got up to find something to eat.
Luckily, she had stocked up on snacks. She curled up on the couch, eating slowly.

After filling her stomach, she checked the time.
It was time to head to the bar.

She got ready and went downstairs, only to see a familiar Maybach parked outside.
Adrian Sinclair leaned against the car door, his figure starkly clear in the night.

Anna froze.
Hadn't he left hours ago?

"Get in. I'll take you to the bar." His tone was flat.
Anna couldn't help but retort, "But you already left earlier?"
Had he been waiting here the entire time she was asleep?
That was ridiculous!

Before she could finish, Adrian strode toward her.
He grabbed her wrist and practically shoved her into the passenger seat.

Furious at his high-handedness, Anna struggled to get out.
"You always do this! You never ask what I want!"

His fingers tightened, preventing her escape.
He looked down at her, anger simmering in his eyes.

"Are you so against me driving you because you're afraid I'll interrupt your dinner with Julian?"
His voice was icy.

Anna flinched and stopped resisting.
"Let go," she said petulantly. "I'll sit properly."

He released her, watching as she fastened her seatbelt before closing her door.
Anna glared at his back, muttering under her breath, "So childish!"
Her gaze could have drilled holes through him.

Adrian slid into the driver's seat, and she immediately looked away.
Silence filled the car. Neither spoke during the entire ride.

Anna thought of Howard Lowell's instructions, her mood growing heavier.
Even her expression betrayed her irritation.

"Are you angry?" Adrian glanced at her, suddenly wanting to smooth the frown from her brow.
She had been looking so troubled lately.

Anna snapped out of her thoughts and shook her head. "No."
He didn't press further. The silence lasted until they reached the bar.

After getting out, Adrian directly took her hand.
Anna instinctively tried to pull away, but he held on tightly.
He stared straight ahead, his tone casual. "Let's go. Your dear Julian must be waiting."
###Chapter 231

Anna Ross remained silent.

She let him pull her into the bar.

Julian Garnache was sitting at the bar counter, mixing drinks.

His slender fingers held the shaker.

His movements were skilled and fluid.

Anna quickly shook off Adrian Sinclair's hand.

Afraid of causing any misunderstanding.

Adrian's palm was suddenly empty.

His eyes darkened instantly.

Julian noticed her from the corner of his eye.

He immediately put down his tools.

He walked over with a smile.

He naturally put his arm around her shoulder.

"Anna, come try the drink I just made."

He led her toward the bar.

Completely ignoring the man beside her.

Adrian's gaze turned icy.

He stared intently at the hand on her shoulder.

Anna dodged away first.

Quickly stepping aside.

Julian was taken aback.

He looked at his empty arm.

Then at Anna, who was now two meters away.

He couldn't help but laugh.

"What's wrong? Such a big reaction."

"This isn't like you."

Anna took a deep breath.

Adrian's expression had been terrifying.

She had no doubt something would have happened the next second.

"Julian, I'm not really good with alcohol."

"Thank you for the offer."

She forced a smile.

But the corners of her mouth felt stiff.

Julian patted his forehead.

"Look at my memory."

"You mentioned it during dinner last time."

He shook his head regretfully.

Anna quickly said it was fine.

She didn't want to dwell on the topic.

Julian finally noticed Adrian.

He studied him carefully.

He felt somewhat familiar.

But couldn't place him right away.

Adrian grew impatient under his gaze.

His brow furrowed slightly.

His eyes grew colder.

Julian greeted him proactively.

"Hey, have we met before?"

Anna hurriedly explained.

"He's my boss."

"You saw him during dinner last time."

She secretly observed Adrian's expression.

Sure enough, he looked displeased again.

Julian suddenly understood.

Then he asked curiously.

"Aren't you working at the bar?"

"How did he become your boss?"

Anna answered softly.

"I only work here part-time at night."

"I'm his executive assistant during the day."

A hint of helplessness flashed in her eyes.

Adrian caught her expression.

He didn't understand why she had to be so stubborn.

She didn't need to work here at all.

Yet she showed no intention of stopping.

The music from the dance floor was deafening.

The crowd around them cheered.

But the three of them were lost in their own thoughts.

Out of place in the lively atmosphere.

Julian looked at her with concern.

The lively, smiling girl from his memories.

Now showed no trace of happiness.

She must be facing some difficulties.

But with Adrian present.

He swallowed his questions.

Anna clenched her fingers silently.

She just wanted to earn more money.

To pay off Howard Lowell's debt as soon as possible.

That way, she could truly be free.

No longer under anyone's control.
###Chapter 232

The bar owner rushed over urgently.

He grabbed Anna Ross by the arm.

"My dear girl, I finally found you!"

"It's time for your performance. Get on stage now."

"Whatever it is can wait until after you sing."

Anna was pulled forward.

She turned back to say something.

But she saw Adrian Sinclair and Julian Garnache staring each other down.

Her heart sank with panic.

In her rush, she shot Adrian a warning glance.

She signaled him not to cause trouble.

Adrian's lips curved into a slight smile.

He returned a meaningful look.

His eyes followed her as she left.

Anna inwardly groaned.

But she had no choice but to take the stage.

She settled onto the high stool.

Anxiously, she scanned the crowd below.

The place was packed with people.

There was no sign of the two men anywhere.

The audience began to cheer and clap.

She had to focus and start singing.

By the bar counter.

Adrian stepped forward casually.

"I heard you made a special cocktail?"

"Would I be lucky enough to try it?"

Julian pulled his gaze away from the stage.

"Since you're a friend of Anna's."

"You're certainly welcome."

He led Adrian to the bar.

He took out a fresh glass.

Poured in the amber-colored liquor.

Adrian accepted the glass.

He took a small sip.

Closed his eyes to savor the taste.

"The layers of flavor are complex."

"Quite memorable."

Julian downed his own drink in one go.

"Just something I threw together."

"Feel free to have another if you like."

Adrian swirled his glass thoughtfully.

"Another drink won't be necessary."

"But I do have some questions for you."

Julian raised an eyebrow.

"This is only our second meeting."

"What could you possibly want to ask?"

Adrian leaned lazily against the bar.

His gaze drifted toward the stage.

"You seem quite close with her?"

"She even calls you Julian."

Julian frowned.

He studied the imposing man before him.

"Is that really any of the bar owner's business?"

Adrian's expression remained neutral.

"Just curious."

"After all, I care about her deeply."

Julian relaxed slightly.

"Anna is a good girl."

"Your care for her shows you have good taste."

Adrian chuckled softly without responding.

On stage, Anna felt like she was sitting on pins and needles.

She finally sang the last line.

She hurried off the stage.

Searching everywhere for any sign of the two men.
###Chapter 233

She anxiously scanned the surroundings, but saw no sign of either man.

As she turned toward the bar's entrance, a familiar figure caught her eye near the counter.

She hurried over, her breath still uneven.

After a careful inspection, she felt relieved neither appeared injured.

It seemed the confrontation hadn't escalated yet.

"Anna, your performance tonight was extraordinary." Julian Garnache smiled and snapped his fingers.

A server immediately appeared carrying an enormous bouquet.

Vivid red roses nearly engulfed Anna Ross completely.

She stood frozen, unsure how to respond.

Adrian Sinclair's knuckles turned white, his drink trembling slightly.

The crowd around them gasped in awe.

"That bouquet is insane. Is he proposing?"

"So romantic. I'm dying of envy!"

"They look perfect together."

Adrian's icy gaze swept over them, and the chatter died instantly.

People quickly scattered.

Julian took the opportunity to pull Anna into a brief embrace.

As he released her, he shot Adrian a provocative look.

Anna finally understood.

Julian was deliberately provoking Adrian.

She quickly asked the server to move the flowers backstage.

The bouquet was far too conspicuous.

Especially with a man who seemed ready to explode at any moment standing nearby.

Julian ignored Adrian's dark expression.

He glanced at his wristwatch.

"Little Anna, let me drive you home."

"There are some things I'd like to discuss with you."

Adrian set his glass down and stood.

"No need to trouble you, Mr. Garnache."

"My Executive Assistant and I are heading the same way."

He emphasized the words "same way" deliberately.

Anna sighed inwardly.

Their residences were in completely opposite directions.

But no one could challenge his decision.

Julian's smile faded.

"Anna, if you'd prefer not to ride with him..."

"I can take you."

Adrian cut him off firmly.

"What do you say, Executive Assistant?"

He stepped closer, his presence radiating undeniable pressure.

Both men's eyes were fixed on her.

Anna took a soft breath.

She turned to Julian with an apologetic smile.

"Julian, my boss and I are indeed going the same direction."

"I won't trouble you further."

She knew exactly which choice to make.

She would bear Adrian's wrath alone.

She could never drag those important to her into this.
###Chapter 234

"Be careful on your way. Contact me anytime if something happens." Julian Garnache didn't try to stop her further, though his eyes couldn't hide his concern.

Anna Ross nodded gently and followed Adrian Sinclair out of the bar.

The air inside the car was stagnant.

Adrian stared straight ahead, his jawline tight.

His breathing was heavy, his knuckles white as he gripped the steering wheel.

Anna turned her face toward the window.

She knew he was angry.

Any explanation would only make things worse.

She bit her lip and remained silent.

"You are not allowed to sing at bars anymore." His voice was cold and hard, laced with suppressed fury.

Anna's fingers tightened.

"Impossible," she blurted out. "This is my job. I love singing. My part-time work doesn't affect my main job. You can't interfere."

A vein throbbed at Adrian's temple.

He gripped the steering wheel fiercely.

"Why must you be like this?" The words seemed forced through his teeth.

Anna lowered her gaze.

He would never understand her struggles.

The amount he could casually wave away was a sum she had to fight desperately to earn.

"I need to live. I need money," she said softly. "Please show some mercy, Mr. Sinclair."

Her eyelashes fluttered as she waited for his outburst.

The car came to an abrupt stop.

She looked up and realized they had arrived at her apartment building.

She quickly unbuckled her seatbelt and pushed the door open.

Her back was straight, her steps hurried.

Adrian watched her disappear into the building entrance.

That small, slender figure seemed as if it could be swallowed by the night at any moment.

What was the real reason she was working so desperately for money?

Was she truly that short on funds?

Anna rushed into her apartment and locked the door behind her.

She held her breath, listening for any sound outside.

Silence.

She let out a sigh of relief and collapsed onto the sofa.

The ceiling was blindingly white.

Her current life was exhausting, but it was full of hope.

Just the thought of escaping Howard Lowell's control made it all worth it.

She suddenly sat up.

That look in Adrian's eyes...

Would he target Julian Garnache?

He was capable of anything.

She grabbed her phone, then put it down again.

She hugged her knees and curled up on the sofa.

She understood him less and less.

Even though they were no longer lovers, he acted like a beast guarding its territory, closely watching every male around her.

That intense hostility was almost undisguised.

It was strange.

If not for the clear hatred in his eyes, she might have thought he still had feelings for her.
###Chapter 235

Anna Ross immediately shook her head.

That thought was too absurd.

She picked up her phone and opened Twitter.

She had just downloaded it a couple of days ago.

She wanted to check on the bloggers she used to follow.

She had always loved singing.

She used to follow a few indie singers.

After logging in, she noticed many bloggers had stopped updating.

She scrolled absently for a while.

It felt a bit boring.

She was about to click on an interesting trending topic.

The screen suddenly changed.

Vivian Lowell was calling.

Anna immediately sat up straight.

She answered after just two rings.

It was very quiet on the other end.

She softly said, "Mom."

Vivian's voice was warm and smiling. "Anna, are you off work? It's nothing important. I just suddenly missed you."

Anna's heart ached.

Her mother had been in New York for so long.

She had been staying in a hotel the entire time.

Anna couldn't visit her often either.

She walked to the window and opened it for some fresh air. "Mom, I took the day off today. I'm resting at home. Has he taken you out anywhere?"

The windowsill held a succulent bought by Sophia Roscente.

It was already lush and thriving.

She couldn't help but gently touch its leaves.

Vivian glanced toward the bathroom.

The sound of running water echoed.

She relaxed a little. "No, not really. We've been at the hotel these past two days. He meets friends occasionally and comes back very late. He doesn't have time for me."

Anna's hand stilled.

She looked out at the distant neon lights.

Her voice was firm. "Mom, once I save enough money, I will definitely take you away from here."

This marriage had been dead in name only for a long time.

Her mother was not happy.

"Anna, actually—"

"Who are you talking to?"

Howard Lowell's voice suddenly cut in.

It was full of malice.

Anna's fingers tightened sharply.

Vivian's voice was faint. "It's Anna."

A series of rustling noises followed.

It sounded like a struggle.

Soon, Howard snatched the phone. "Have you done what I told you to do?"

His voice was deafening.

Anna held the phone away from her ear in disgust. "Work has been busy recently. I haven't found the right opportunity to bring it up. But I will soon."

She had been threatened too many times.

She was surprisingly calm now.

It wasn't that there was no opportunity.

She just didn't dare to speak.

And she didn't know how to start.

Howard lit a cigarette.

He sneered. "Don't try any tricks. Do as you're told, or I'll make your life a living hell!"

The smoke made Vivian cough repeatedly.

The sound carried through the receiver.

Anna's heart clenched.

She responded coldly, "I know."

Howard shot a look of disgust at the woman beside him. "If you can't stand it, get out."

After Vivian left.

He suddenly let out a dark chuckle. "We're seeing the old man tomorrow. You come too. It's a good chance to introduce you."

See Grandpa Lowell?

Anna's fingers dug into the windowsill.

She gritted her teeth and agreed. "Fine."

Her agreement was quick.

But her heart was a mess of anxiety.

Tomorrow...

She could only hope everything would go smoothly.
###Chapter 236

The alarm clock rang, and Anna Ross woke with a splitting headache.

She mechanically got out of bed and washed up.

She applied light makeup in the mirror.

The reflection showed a pale face with dark circles under her eyes.

She sighed, picked up her bag, and left.

In the company elevator, Noah Watson was startled by her appearance.

"Ms. Ross, are you alright?"

Anna forced a weak smile. "I'm fine. Just didn't sleep well last night."

She touched her face. The foundation couldn't hide her exhaustion.

Files were piled high on her desk.

She sorted through them absentmindedly.

Her gaze kept drifting toward the CEO's office.

The door remained tightly shut.

Was he not in today?

Her phone vibrated. A message from her mother.

"Anna, we'll be at the Lowell Manor in half an hour."

Anna gripped her phone tightly, her knuckles turning white.

It was too late to request time off now.

She quickly handled the urgent tasks.

She grabbed her bag and rushed out.

A taxi stopped at the hotel entrance.

Howard Lowell checked his watch impatiently.

"What took you so long?" He coldly pulled the car door open.

Anna silently helped her mother into the back seat.

The car's air was thick with strong perfume.

Vivian Lowell held her hand worriedly. "Are you feeling unwell?"

Anna shook her head. "Just didn't sleep well last night."

A cold snort came from the front seat.

The iron gates of the manor slowly opened.

Anna took a deep breath and followed them into the living room.

Footsteps echoed from the spiral staircase.

Adrian Sinclair stood on the steps, his gaze fixed on her.

Anna's heart skipped a beat.

He walked closer slowly, a slight smile on his lips.

"My little cousin is here too?"

Her nails dug into her palms.

She forced a smile.
###Chapter 237

Howard Lowell put on a smile. "Adrian, Anna is my daughter. It's perfectly reasonable for me to bring her here."

A hypocritical curve hung on his lips, his eyes filled with disdain.

Adrian Sinclair nodded in understanding. His gaze swept over her face before settling on Howard. "Uncle, Grandpa is waiting in the living room. Please come in."

Howard straightened his suit. Vivian carefully smoothed his collar for him.

Only after ensuring everything was perfect did the three of them step inside.

Anna stayed close to her mother's side, deliberately ignoring the gaze burning into her back.

Adrian watched for a moment before slowly following.

The elder Lowell was taking his medication and paid no attention to the newcomers. Howard signaled for everyone to be quiet.

They all sat down silently to wait.

Adrian casually took a seat in a single armchair. His lips curved into a slight smile when his eyes met Anna's.

She immediately looked away.

With so many eyes present, how dare he be so blatant?

She glanced toward the elder. A servant was collecting the medicine bottle and water glass.

Howard immediately spoke up eagerly. "Dad, I came all the way from San Francisco to see you. How have you been feeling lately?"

The elder snorted coldly, keeping his eyes closed. "Can't you see for yourself?"

The atmosphere instantly froze. Howard forced an awkward laugh. "It's just some minor issues. Your constitution has always been very robust."

Anna lowered her eyes to hide her sarcasm.

Her usually arrogant stepfather was actually this obsequious in front of his own father.

It seemed the elder was truly deeply disappointed in this son, just as Adrian had said.

Howard took Vivian's hand to introduce them. "Dad, this is my wife, Vivian, and my daughter, Anna. We didn't have time to come back when we got married. We specifically came to see you today."

The elder glanced at them, his expression indifferent.

Vivian quickly greeted him with her daughter. "Dad." She gave her daughter a gentle push. "Anna, say hello to your grandfather."

Anna reluctantly spoke in a soft voice. "Grandfather."

The elder gave a slight nod and said nothing more.

She assumed he was just tired from his illness and didn't think much of it.

Howard made small talk with the elder. She couldn't contribute to the conversation.

Just as she was starting to feel bored, the light in front of her dimmed.

Adrian had somehow come to her side. He signaled for her to follow him.

Seeing her mother was engrossed in conversation, she quietly stood up.

They stopped at the staircase landing. He kept one hand in his pocket, his voice low. "What is his real purpose for coming this time?"

Her heart had been pounding over how to explain her absence from work. She looked up in surprise. He wasn't here to reprimand her for leaving without permission.
###Chapter 238

The person behind her remained silent.

He turned around.

He looked down at her with an intense gaze.

Anna Ross avoided his eyes.

His direct question caught her off guard.

She felt flustered.

She wasn't ready to discuss this with him.

"I don't know."

"Isn't he just visiting his father normally?"

She was lying.

She couldn't meet his eyes.

Her gaze drifted away.

Adrian Sinclair watched her subtle reactions.

He stepped closer.

His voice dropped to a low murmur.

"I know you're lying."

Anna bit her lip.

He already knew the answer before asking.

Someone as perceptive as him wouldn't be easily deceived.

"Tell me now."

"You can trust me."

"At least I'm more trustworthy than your so-called father."

Adrian spoke slowly.

His eyes scanned her face.

"Tell me everything you know."

"If you're in trouble."

"I'll help you."

His words were soft.

But they felt hypnotic to her ears.

Could she really tell him everything?

The words almost escaped her lips.

Anna clenched her fingers.

She glanced back toward the living room.

Two voices seemed to argue in her mind.

One urged her to tell the truth.

The other desperately held her back.

She looked up at him.

"Alright."

"I'll tell you."

A sharp glint flashed in his eyes.

He watched her intently.

"He wants to join the main company."

"This visit is probably to discuss it with Grandpa."

Anna pressed her lips together.

She fearfully grabbed his sleeve.

She whispered a plea.

"Can you not refuse him?"

"Let him join the main company, please?"

Adrian remained silent for a moment.

The air around him turned cold.

He answered with another question.

"If he joins the main company."

"Who will handle the mess he left in the branch?"

Anna had no response.

She slowly released his sleeve.

He turned and walked away.

Leaving her standing alone.

She stood there for a moment.

Then returned to her mother's side.

Howard Lowell rubbed his hands together.

He eagerly poured tea for the old man.

His voice full of expectation.

"Dad."

"There's something else I want to discuss."

The old man glanced at the tea.

But didn't touch it.

He simply asked.

"What is it?"

"Well."

"I've been in San Francisco for so long."

"It's hard to even see you."

"So I came back to discuss something."

"I want to stay in New York."

"To spend more time with you."

He adopted the respectful demeanor of a dutiful son.

But the old man didn't look pleased.

His expression darkened.

He coughed twice.

Then asked sternly.

"You want to return to New York?"

"Then tell me."

"How are things at the branch company?"

Howard's face instantly paled.

He signaled for Anna and her mother to leave.

Anna understood.

She took her mother's arm and excused themselves to the restroom.

After they left.

Howard moved closer to the old man.

Trying to soften his attitude.

"Dad."

"Things at the branch aren't that bad."

"Some people are just making a big deal out of nothing."

"Please don't worry about it."

After hearing this.

The old man felt a tightness in his chest.

It took him a moment to recover.

He looked at his son with disappointment.

He shouted angrily.

"I sent you to the branch to train you."

"But look at you."

"You've made a complete mess of things."
###Chapter 239

Howard Lowell trembled.

He felt deep fear toward his imposing father.

"Dad, the problems at the branch company weren't my fault."

"Do you know Charles Lowell? He was the one scheming behind the scenes."

"I've already fired him."

He put on a wounded expression, playing the role of an unjustly accused victim perfectly.

Grandpa's eyes darkened further.

He pointed at Howard, too angry to speak.

Finally, he turned to Henry standing nearby. "Go get Adrian."

"Yes, sir." Henry bowed and withdrew.

Howard's face instantly turned ashen.

He should have known—Adrian Sinclair was behind this again.

Grandpa shook his head helplessly at his disappointing son.

He picked up his teacup and took a silent sip.

Moments later, Adrian strode briskly into the living room.

"Grandpa, you wanted to see me?"

Grandpa immediately broke into a warm smile.

He waved him over. "Adrian, come sit."

"While you're here, explain the branch company situation to your uncle."

"Be thorough. I worry he might not understand otherwise."

The stark contrast in treatment made Howard see red.

Suddenly, he felt like an outsider in his own family.

But he was the biological son!

His eyes burned with fury as he glared at Adrian.

He wished he could crush him on the spot.

Adrian's lips curved slightly as he sat down calmly.

He took out his phone and pulled up all the evidence of the branch company's issues.

He slid the phone across the coffee table.

"Uncle, see for yourself."

Howard's face tightened as he picked up the phone under their dual gaze.

With every swipe, his heart grew colder.

He couldn't believe it—Adrian had uncovered everything so thoroughly in such a short time.

Every piece of evidence pointed directly at him.

"Now do you see how many stupid things you've done!?" Grandpa barked sharply.

He could barely stand to look at his useless son anymore.

Howard's heart sank. He slid off the couch.

He knelt at Grandpa's feet, face full of remorse.

"Dad, I know I was wrong."

"Please forgive me this time. Please?"

Adrian retrieved his phone and leaned back lazily into the sofa.

He watched the performance with cold eyes.

Grandpa looked down at his son with disappointment, closing his eyes in silence.

This reaction pushed Howard toward desperation.

His voice rose sharply. "Dad! I'm your real son!"

"You can't just abandon me, Dad!"

His shrill voice gave Grandpa a headache.

Grandpa opened his eyes, brows furrowed deeply. "Enough!"

"This matter requires further consideration."

Further consideration?

Howard slumped back onto the couch, defeated.

It should have been a simple decision. Now it needed consideration.

Was there still a chance for him?

No. He couldn't give up.

There had to be a way out.

Suddenly, he thought of something.

His head snapped up as he stared across at Adrian.

That daughter of his had been planted beside him for so long.

Wasn't it time she proved useful?
###Chapter 240

Howard Lowell looked at Adrian Sinclair with pleading eyes.

He moved closer.

"Adrian, help your uncle."

"Talk to your grandpa for me."

"I'm begging you."

Adrian's eyes turned cold.

He knew it was trouble from that one glance.

As expected, it was another plea for mercy.

He narrowed his eyes.

After a moment's thought, he turned to the old man.

"Grandpa, Uncle knows he was wrong."

"He won't do it again."

The old man glanced at his son.

Howard felt a secret thrill.

Though Adrian's words annoyed him.

They worked.

His move was correct.

"If I forgive too easily..."

"What will the branch office think?"

The old man still hesitated.

Howard looked at Adrian again.

The other man paused before continuing.

"The branch office situation can still be salvaged."

Surprise flashed in the old man's eyes.

His expression softened considerably.

"Really?"

"That's wonderful."

"Adrian, Grandpa wasn't wrong about you."

Adrian smiled faintly.

No extra emotion.

The old man looked at Howard.

"Stay for dinner today."

Howard nodded repeatedly.

But he felt very unwilling.

He was the one who got scolded.

Yet that guy came out looking better.

Anna Ross walked with her mother in the backyard.

A servant came to invite them to dinner.

Vivian Lowell smiled and pulled her along.

Everyone was already seated in the dining room.

The old man sat at the head of the table.

Adrian and Howard sat on either side.

Anna and her mother sat next to Howard.

Once everyone was present, the old man spoke.

"Let's eat."

No one spoke at the table.

Anna ate quietly.

The atmosphere was somewhat oppressive.

She looked up to get food and met Adrian's gaze.

She froze.

Howard suddenly spoke.

"Dad, Anna just arrived here."

"I hope you'll look after her."

Anna glanced at him in surprise.

He never said things like that.

Suddenly pushing her into the spotlight.

He definitely had an agenda.

The old man glanced at her.

His eyes clearly showed dislike.

Howard quickly signaled with his eyes.

Anna spoke obediently.

"Grandpa, I haven't visited you until now."

"Please forgive me."

"It's fine."

"There's nothing interesting about an old man like me."

Mr. Lowell responded.

He continued eating.

Clearly uninterested in her.

Anna lowered her eyes awkwardly.

She had expected this outcome.

Not liked from the first meeting.

Especially since she wasn't biologically related.

Adrian watched her quietly.

A trace of heartache appeared in his eyes.

He turned to the old man with a faint smile.

"Grandpa, Cousin is very outstanding."

"Her work abilities are also exceptional."

"That is undeniable."

Anna looked up, stunned.

Her heart fluttered slightly.
###Chapter 241

Grandpa's gaze returned to her.

Adrian Sinclair continued, "She's mentioned wanting to visit you before, but her schedule at the company has been too hectic."

"I'm finished. Please enjoy your meal." Grandpa set down his fork and knife.

Henry immediately stepped forward to assist him away from the table.

Adrian's words were cut short.

He frowned deeply, watching his grandfather's retreating figure.

When he turned back, his expression had returned to normal.

Howard Lowell glared at Anna Ross with clear distaste.

He studied her delicate features.

She was pretty and pleasant.

She should have charmed the elders.

Why did his father react so negatively?

There was even a hint of disgust.

Vivian Lowell looked at her daughter with concern, gently squeezing her hand.

Anna responded with a calm smile, reassuring her mother not to worry.

She had thought Grandpa merely disliked her.

Now it seemed he actively disapproved.

She didn't understand why a first meeting provoked such a reaction.

But she quickly decided it didn't matter.

They would leave Howard Lowell soon enough.

Then the Lowell family would be irrelevant.

Adrian watched her for a moment.

He then set down his own utensils.

He wiped his mouth and sat quietly, waiting.

Howard finished his meal quickly.

Anna had little appetite and only ate a few bites before stopping.

After the meal, Howard tried to approach Grandpa again.

Henry stopped him. "Sir is resting. Please do not disturb him."

Howard's face darkened with anger.

He was about to argue when Henry added, "Please don't make this difficult for me."

He was just the messenger.

This was ultimately Grandpa's decision.

If Grandpa refused to see him, going upstairs would achieve nothing.

Howard understood immediately.

"Let's go," he said coldly.

There was no point staying today.

Better to return home and wait for news.

As long as they remained in New York, there would be other opportunities.

Vivian was accustomed to such scenes.

She stood calmly, waiting.

Adrian emerged from the restroom and walked briskly toward them.

Anna took her mother's hand. "Mom, you should go back. I need to return to the office."

She had left work without permission.

She wondered how Adrian would react.

Howard turned back impatiently. "She has to work. Why are you holding her? Do you want to go with her?"

Nothing was going right.

Losing face to that young man was bad enough.

Even his stepdaughter failed to win Grandpa's favor.

Anger burned in his eyes.

Vivian reluctantly released her daughter's hand.

She followed Howard toward the car.

Adrian and Anna saw them off.

After the car drove away, Anna explained, "Leaving work today was my mistake. You can deduct it from my pay."

The man in front of her remained silent for a long time.

She looked up into the sunlight.

His brow was slightly raised. "When did I say I would blame you?"

Anna stared at him in confusion.

He wasn't angry?

Before she could respond, Adrian turned and walked away.

She paused for a moment.

The heavy pressure in her heart suddenly lifted.

A sense of relief washed over her.
###Chapter 242

Her earlier gloominess began to dissipate.

A smile unconsciously touched her lips.

She took out her phone, ready to call a ride back to the company.

A sharp horn suddenly blared from ahead.

Startled, her hand jerked.

She looked up.

Adrian Sinclair's car was parked right in front of her.

He rolled down the window, looking at her. "Get in."

"Aren't you going to the company?"

It all felt unreal, like a dream.

Anna Ross numbly pulled the car door open and got in.

The air inside the car grew still for a moment.

She finally couldn't hold back. "Earlier..."

"Why did you speak up for me?"

She waited, but no response came for a long time.

An inexplicable tightness filled her chest.

She turned to look out the window.

Adrian's low voice broke the silence. "No reason."

"You're the Executive Assistant I chose."

"You represent my judgment."

"Grandpa looking down on you is him questioning my ability."

"I was just defending myself."

Anna's tense heart suddenly relaxed.

Yet, a strange sense of loss washed over her.

Her throat felt choked, as if something was stuck there.

She really shouldn't have overthought it.

How could he genuinely help her?

She was just someone he utterly despised.

Adrian gazed at her profile.

He suddenly found himself speechless.

Had his answer hurt her?

But she never cared about what he said.

Why would she be upset over these few words?

Anna didn't speak again.

She leaned back against the seat and took out her phone.

She texted her mother to ask if she had gotten home.

Vivian Lowell sent back a photo.

Howard Lowell's furious profile was somewhat blurred.

It looked like it was taken secretly.

What happened?

He looked extremely upset.

Did today's discussion not go well?

Earlier, he had sent her and her mother away.

It was to discuss this matter.

It seemed the outcome wasn't satisfactory.

She gripped her phone tightly and asked softly, "His matter of going to the headquarters..."

"What did Grandpa say?"

Hearing her initiate conversation, Adrian's mood inexplicably improved.

He glanced at her. "Grandpa said he would consider it."

The thing she was worried about was resolved.

She shouldn't be sad anymore, right?

He couldn't help but look at her a few more times.

Anna was surprised by his candor.

Gratitude filled her heart.

She knew he must have put in a good word.

Otherwise, given Howard Lowell's actions.

Grandpa would never have agreed so easily.

She clenched her fingers and whispered, "Thank you."

"You must have pleaded for him earlier."

"Without you..."

"He couldn't have gotten his wish."

"Don't overthink it."

"You think I'd speak up for him?" He raised an eyebrow, his tone casual.

After a pause, he added, "The decision is in Grandpa's hands."

"He only said he would consider it."

"Whether it succeeds is still unknown."

"Prepare yourself mentally."

Anna was stunned.

In the bright light, she could clearly see his features.

Though he said it lightly.

She knew this was the truth.

She averted her gaze and looked back at her phone.

If this matter failed.

Howard Lowell would only intensify his torment of her mother.
###Chapter 243

Adrian Sinclair’s gaze swept over Anna Ross.

His voice was low. "Are you that eager for him to come to the headquarters?"

The car sped along.

He controlled the steering wheel with one hand.

His other hand rested casually by the window.

The gesture seemed lazy.

But his expression was grim.

A faint curve touched Anna’s lips.

"It’s his wish."

"It has nothing to do with me."

"I was just asking casually."

"I’m not worried."

If not for her mother.

Why would she be doing any of this.

Not worried.

Adrian repeated the words in his mind.

If not worry.

Then what was that concern on her face.

He didn’t respond.

Anna remembered his earlier promise.

She suppressed her emotions.

Her tone was calm. "I want to ask you for a favor."

A glance came from the left.

Urging her to continue.

She lowered her eyes.

Her expression strained but neutral.

"Could you put in a good word for him in front of Grandpa..."

She knew the request was excessive.

But she had no other choice.

Silence fell in the car.

Adrian’s face darkened.

He didn’t refuse.

But he didn’t agree either.

Her heart raced.

Regret washed over her.

He must dislike her even more now.

But could she back down?

No.

As long as her mother was safe.

It didn’t matter if he hated her.

"As long as you agree."

"I’ll do anything."

After speaking.

Anna quickly rolled down the window.

Cold air rushed in.

So humble.

Was she even herself anymore?

Adrian’s jaw tightened.

He remained silent.

Anna lacked the courage to speak again.

He sharply turned the steering wheel.

The car stopped steadily at the company entrance.

After a long wait.

He only said, "We’re here. Get out."

He exited the car swiftly.

Anna’s face burned.

Her earlier words filled her with shame.

There was no movement behind him.

Adrian turned to look inside the car.

She was pale.

She hurried out and followed him.

Anna walked quietly by his side.

Stealing glances at him occasionally.

Her heart was bleak.

He probably wouldn’t agree.

Employees greeted them along the way.

Anna kept her head down as she followed.

Near the elevator.

Someone approached from the side.

Chloe Valentine paused at the sight of them.

Then she smiled and stepped forward.

She held files.

As if she had just finished a meeting.

Chloe brushed past Anna.

She went directly to Adrian.

Reaching out to adjust his collar.

"Adrian, no matter how busy you are, you must take care of yourself."

"Your tie is crooked."

"Let me fix it for you."

She carefully adjusted his tie.

Her eyes shyly lowered.

After so many times.

She had discovered that when Anna was present.

Adrian never refused her closeness.

Adrian didn’t move.

Allowing her to adjust his tie.
###Chapter 244

She fumbled for a long time but couldn't fix it.

His brows furrowed slightly.

He was about to tell her to leave.

But she seemed to read his mind.

She released her hands voluntarily.

She reached out and brushed the dust off his shoulder.

She chuckled softly. "Someone as meticulous as you making such a mess."

"That's rare."

Anna Ross felt her eyes sting.

It was as uncomfortable as having sand in them.

She said quietly, "Mr. Sinclair, Director Valentine, please continue your conversation."

"I have unfinished work. I should go."

She almost ran away.

As the elevator doors closed.

She saw Chloe Valentine covering her mouth with a light laugh.

That smile was painfully bright.

He said he didn't want to marry Chloe.

Yet he never refused her intimate gestures.

Anna looked at her reflection in the elevator mirror.

She felt ridiculous.

She was just a tool for his revenge.

What more was she expecting?

Adrian Sinclair glanced at Chloe.

He didn't expose her little game.

He turned to leave.

Chloe grabbed his arm tightly.

She said seriously, "Don't be angry. I really have something to report."

Those actions earlier.

Were just to provoke Anna.

The goal had been achieved.

"What is it?" Adrian stared at her hand.

His gaze was displeased.

Chloe released her grip.

She suppressed the disappointment in her heart.

She forced a smile. "The matter with Lucas's company is resolved."

She blinked, waiting for praise.

Adrian only responded with a faint "Hmm."

Chloe persisted.

She handed him a document. "This just came back."

"It requires your signature. It's too important, so I came personally."

"Okay." Adrian pressed the elevator button.

Chloe happily followed him.

As long as she could stay with him for a while.

She was satisfied.

Anna came out of the restroom.

She ran into Noah Watson carrying a stack of files.

She quickly stepped forward to help.

Noah immediately stepped back. "Executive Assistant Ross, that's not necessary."

"I can manage."

These files were covered in dust.

He couldn't let a woman carry them.

Anna smiled casually. "It's fine."

"It's too heavy for one person."

She took half of the load.

Noah couldn't argue with her.

They walked together carrying the files.

Noah said apologetically, "This was supposed to be my job."

"It's alright. Colleagues should help each other."

Anna's tone was light.

She looked at Noah. "How is the cooperation with the Valentine Group going lately?"

Noah turned to her in surprise. "You don't know?"

"The company decided to terminate this collaboration."

"What!?" Anna's breath hitched.

This had to be Adrian's doing.

After putting away the files.

She rushed straight to Adrian's office.

Hearing permission to enter.

She pushed the door open.

Chloe was standing happily beside him, talking.

They were very close.

Seeing her enter.

They both looked up simultaneously.

Anna was furious.

She didn't care about anything else.

She demanded directly, "Why did you terminate the cooperation with Lucas?"
###Chapter 245

Adrian Sinclair’s gaze darkened, ignoring her question entirely.

Chloe Valentine seized the opportunity, stepping quickly to block Anna Ross. She raised her voice deliberately. "Executive Assistant Ross, is it appropriate for a subordinate to speak to her boss like that?"

She glanced at Adrian’s expression, emphasizing her words. "And what exactly is your relationship with Lucas Evans? Why are you so concerned about him?"

Anna looked away, her eyes settling on Adrian. His face was stormy. The name Lucas Evans was a trigger, always pushing him over the edge.

"Lucas and I are just friends. Please don’t read too much into it, Director Valentine." Her voice was calm, her expression unreadable.

Chloe was taken aback, ready to retaliate, but Anna spoke first. "Director Valentine, I need to speak with Mr. Sinclair privately. Please leave."

"You’re asking me to leave?" Chloe’s eyes widened in disbelief. She turned and clung to Adrian’s arm, whining. "Adrian, look how arrogant she is!"

He didn’t push her away. Anna thought, he’s definitely angry. He’ll side with Chloe.

Chloe smiled inwardly. Today was going perfectly.

She pretended to wipe her eyes, trying to make them red. She looked up at him, putting on a pitiful expression. He would surely feel sorry for her.

"Leave us now."

His cold words felt like a bucket of ice water dumped over her head. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go!

While she stood frozen, he rose and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, turning his back to her.

Chloe shot Anna a hateful glare, snatched her files, and stormed out, slamming the door.

Anna Ross, just you wait!

I’ll make you pay for today’s humiliation a hundred times over.

Silence returned to the office. One stood by the door, the other by the window, separated by a vast distance.

Anna remained where she was. Backlit by the sun, she could only see his tall, straight silhouette. She stubbornly waited for his answer.

After a long moment, the figure by the window spoke softly. "You said you had something to discuss. So let me ask you, in what capacity are you questioning me?"

He turned around, his thin lips parting. "As my mistress? Or as Lucas Evans’s girlfriend?"

Anna looked up at him. The sunlight outside was blinding, but it paled compared to the pain in her heart.

In his eyes, was she really that despicable?

Wasn’t he also getting close to other women?

A bitter ache rose in her throat, suffocating her. "I know you hate me. Direct your anger at me. Don’t involve innocent people."

She met his gaze without flinching.

Adrian stared at her stubborn expression, fury simmering in his dark eyes.

Is that what she thought of him?

Footsteps echoed. The next second, his hand closed around her wrist, gripping it tightly.

Anna looked up, meeting his angry eyes.
###Chapter 246

His lips pressed into a tight line.

Anger simmered in his eyes.

They stared at each other in silence.

The air grew thick and suffocating.

Adrian Sinclair raised a hand to rub his temples.

His knuckles were white from the pressure.

His voice was low and rough. "Anna Ross, many things... are not as simple as they appear."

He stopped mid-sentence.

He saw the clear resentment in her eyes.

The explanations died in his throat.

He abruptly released her hand.

A red mark was clearly visible around her wrist.

Anna looked down, gently rubbing the sore spot.

Her gaze drifted involuntarily toward the sofa.

Adrian sat down with his back to her.

He slammed the glass of water onto the coffee table.

The water sloshed violently.

It mirrored his unsettled emotions.

"Please," she said, her voice trembling. "Howard Lowell has done nothing wrong to you. Don't transfer your hatred for me onto him."

She bit her lower lip until it bled.

The metallic taste spread across her tongue.

She spoke bitterly. "The debt I owe you, I will repay it myself."

"Repay?" He let out a cold laugh. "With what? Your body?"

The glass was hurled onto the table.

It made a sharp, grating sound.

Anna's face turned pale.

Her fingers clutched tightly at the hem of her clothes.

Her knuckles turned white.

She had already dragged one person down.

She couldn't let another innocent person get hurt.

She would bear all the sin alone.

Since she was already deep in the mud.

What did she have to fear from eternal damnation.

Tears fell silently.

Leaving cold trails on her cheeks.

Adrian watched that single tear.

His heart felt as if it were being repeatedly pierced by a sharp blade.

The pain was numbing.

She was crying.

For another man.

When she had hurt him back then.

Had she felt even an ounce of reluctance?

Or in her heart.

Had he never been worth caring about?

He sharply turned his face away.

Unwilling to look at her any longer.

Anna opened her eyes.

Her gaze was empty. "As long as you don't hurt the people around me, I will do anything."

"Hah..." A cold smile twisted his lips.

Adrian leaned back into the sofa.

He raised a hand to cover his eyes.

The setting sun cast its light through the window.

The dim, golden rays fell upon him.

Adding a layer of loneliness.

Two people who had once loved each other deeply.

Had actually come to this.

He had thought she was trapped by circumstances.

But it was just his own wishful thinking.

She could go this far for someone else.

Had she ever considered that he would feel heartache too?

In her eyes.

What exactly did he, Adrian Sinclair, amount to?

If he didn't still hold power and influence.

She would probably still be like she was three years ago.

Not even sparing him a single glance.

His Adam's apple moved with difficulty.

A faint redness tinged the corners of his eyes.

He lowered his head.

A self-mocking smile tugged at his lips.

Anna stared at him in a daze.

Her fingers curled unconsciously.

Was he upset?

That always proud Adrian Sinclair.

Could actually show such an expression.

Looking at his lean profile.

If it were before.

She would have gone to hug him.

But now.

She had long lost the right to do so.

She forced herself to look away.

As if that could lessen the dull ache in her chest.

"Since you say so." Adrian suddenly looked up.

His face had returned to its usual coldness. "Then show me your sincerity."

He gave her a cold glance. "Remember that hotel? Go wait for me there tonight."

Without waiting for her response.

His voice, sharp as an ice pick, spoke again. "Get out if there's nothing else."
###Chapter 247

Anna Ross swallowed her words.

She quietly exited the office.

Dizziness washed over her outside the door.

How had things come to this?

Even if he hated her, he shouldn't have targeted those around her.

They had done nothing wrong.

Their only mistake was knowing her.

She leaned against the wall, stumbling unsteadily.

She rested at her desk for a long time before slowly recovering.

Adrian Sinclair gripped his cup tightly.

Veins bulged on the back of his hand.

The air around him turned icy cold.

His face darkened as he picked up his phone.

He dialed a number.

Noah Watson was organizing files.

He answered immediately upon seeing the caller. "What are your instructions, Mr. Sinclair?"

"Delay terminating the cooperation with Evans Corporation." His voice was soft but carried a biting chill.

Noah shuddered, guessing who had angered his boss again.

He didn't dare delay and responded immediately. "Yes, Mr. Sinclair."

Adrian threw his phone onto the desk.

He loosened his tie and leaned back on the sofa, closing his eyes.

He should have been ruthless.

But seeing her dejected expression still made his heart ache.

He let out a cold laugh.

He couldn't even understand himself anymore.

He looked toward the door.

They were only separated by a single door.

Yet it felt like an entire galaxy stood between them.

Anna stared angrily at her computer.

She typed then helplessly deleted.

She kept making mistakes after several attempts.

Her hands seemed out of control.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

She picked it up irritably.

It was a call from Mia Lawrence.

She answered. "What's up, Mia?"

Mia didn't notice her mood.

Her joyful voice came through. "Anna, I'm so happy today!"

"I just really missed you."

"I'll wait for you at the bar later."

"Let's have dinner together, okay?"

Anna tilted her head to hold the phone.

She typed frantically with busy hands. "Okay, I'll come straight after work."

Mia responded happily.

After hanging up, Anna took a deep breath.

She tried to stay calm.

She continued working.

She arrived at the bar after work.

Mia was already waiting.

She ran over excitedly upon seeing Anna.

She grabbed her hand. "Anna, let me tell you."

"I got promoted today!"

They sat down at the bar counter.

Mia knew she couldn't drink.

She ordered a drink for herself and started sipping.

Anna smiled understandingly.

She felt happy because her best friend was happy. "Congratulations, Mia."

She turned to the bartender. "Get me a drink."

Mia immediately stopped her. "Can't you drink?"

"Don't force yourself. I know you're happy for me."

"How can that be?"

"I'll just have a little." Anna smiled brightly.

She lightly clinked glasses and frowned after taking a sip.

Mia laughed. "Lightweight. Can't drink but still pushing yourself."

Anna sighed helplessly.

She really was a one-drink wonder.

"I'm in a good mood today."

"Dinner is on me." Mia took her glass away.

She wouldn't let her drink more.

Anna had no objections.

It was perfect for a proper celebration.

"I need to work first."

"We'll go after I finish singing."
###Chapter 248

"Yes, ma'am!" Mia Lawrence giggled and waved, watching her friend step onto the stage.

She lifted her glass and took a small sip, lost in her best friend's moving vocals.

Life was simply perfect.

Fine drinks, cherished friends, a soaring career—what more could she ask for?

。。。。。。。。

Anna Ross finished the last note.

Her phone began vibrating wildly the moment she stepped off the stage.

Her heart skipped a beat.

Fearing a message from Adrian Sinclair, she quickly pulled out her phone.

The screen lit up.

The sender was actually Julian Garnache.

She stared at the plea for help, her brow furrowing unconsciously.

Mia leaned over for a glance and immediately laughed. "Wow, our Anna is so popular! Who is this Julian? And what's this about saving the day?"

Anna clutched her phone, seeing his anxious tone.

She grabbed her friend's arm and headed for the exit. "He's an old neighbor from my childhood. He runs a bar in New York now."

Mia knew better than to pry and followed her out quickly.

They found the bar using the location pin and both gasped in unison.

Mia covered her mouth in shock. "Anna, this is nothing like the bars you usually perform at! This is like a palace!"

Though surprised, Anna found it made sense given Julian's family background. "Don't just stand there. Let's go in."

They had just stepped through the main entrance when Julian rushed to meet them.

His eyes lit up at the sight of Anna. "Little Anna, I knew you'd come to my rescue."

Anna was about to speak when she felt a sharp pain in her hand.

Mia was gripping it tightly, her eyes fixed on Julian, her face a picture of stunned admiration.

"Mia?" Anna whispered a reminder.

Mia snapped out of it. "I-I'm fine." But her gaze remained glued to Julian.

This look, this aura—he was exactly her type!

Mia's fingers trembled with excitement.

Julian checked his watch, urgency in his voice. "We're short on time. Come inside first."

Anna hurried on stage and began to sing.

The moment her voice filled the room, the entire bar's atmosphere ignited.

The audience erupted in wild cheers, whistles echoing throughout.

In a dimly lit booth, a pair of cold eyes locked fiercely onto the stage.

The gaze was so sharp it seemed ready to devour the performer alive.

"Mr. Sinclair, this drink was specially prepared for you." A man beside him urged him to drink, noticing his stare and offering a suggestive smile. "Interested in that girl? I can arrange an introduction."

Adrian Sinclair withdrew his gaze and lifted his glass casually. "Not necessary."

The man immediately fell silent.

Everyone knew this man's temper. He didn't dare provoke him.

The performance ended.

Anna spotted the two waiting below and walked over quickly.

Julian spread his arms wide to greet her. "Little Anna, you never fail to amaze."

Anna deftly avoided the hug.

He didn't seem bothered, just laughed and ruffled her hair. "As a thank you, let me treat you both to a late supper."

"No need..." Anna thought of Lucas Evans's warning, afraid of getting Julian involved.

Before she could finish her refusal, Mia eagerly accepted. "Sure!"
###Chapter 249

Mia Lawrence tightened her grip on Anna Ross’s wrist, refusing to let her break free.

Julian Garnache chuckled softly, warmth shimmering in his eyes. “Anna, your friend is quite amusing.”

His laughter made Mia’s ears burn crimson. Her heart raced wildly, her breathing turning uneven.

“Don’t just stand there. I’ve already booked a private room. It’s the perfect time to head over.” Julian put away his phone and gestured for them to follow.

Mia shoved her bag back into Anna’s arms, but her gaze remained fixed on Julian. A smile tugged persistently at her lips.

Anna was about to speak when she caught sight of a familiar figure approaching rapidly from the corner of her eye—Adrian Sinclair. Her entire body stiffened. Instinctively, she tried to retreat.

“Julian, I just remembered something urgent. I’m afraid I can’t make it for dinner today…” Her words tumbled out quickly as she turned to leave.

Before Julian could process her words, Anna had already taken several steps.

A heavy feeling settled in her chest. Why did she run into him everywhere? It was as if he had planted a tracker on her. There was no escape.

After just two seconds, she realized she couldn’t move. She glanced back and saw Mia clutching the hem of her shirt tightly.

“Mia, let go!” Her voice trembled with urgency. Adrian was already right in front of them.

Mia also noticed Adrian and froze, releasing her grip.

But it was too late. Adrian stopped three steps away. His cold gaze swept over Julian before finally locking onto Anna’s face. “What a coincidence. I keep running into you everywhere.”

Anna pressed her lips together, scoffing inwardly. Coincidence? This was nothing but a toxic relationship.

“Adrian Sinclair?” Julian stepped forward, shielding Anna behind him. His tone was guarded. “I remember you.”

After their last encounter, he had looked into this man. His background was complex, his influence substantial. No wonder Anna always looked like she’d seen a ghost whenever he appeared.

Seeing Julian’s protective stance, Adrian’s eyes darkened. A faint, mocking smile touched his lips. “I have some private matters to discuss with her. I need to take her with me now.”

He reached out and pulled Anna from behind Julian. She stumbled forward, keeping her head down, not daring to look at anyone. But her other hand was still held by Julian.

“Julian…” She looked up, her voice weak.

Julian tightened his grip on her wrist, glaring coldly at Adrian. “She’s a person, not an object for you to toss around.”

Trapped between the two men, Anna felt suffocated. Adrian had completely lost his patience. He stared down at her. “Your choice. Come with me, or stay?”

Mia charged forward angrily. “Adrian, who do you think you are to pressure her like this? Does having money make you special?”

Anna quickly grasped her arm, interrupting softly. “Stop arguing… I really do have matters to settle with him.”

She gently freed her hand from Julian’s grasp and forced a smile. “It’s fine. You two go ahead to dinner.”

“Anna!” Mia called out, her voice filled with concern.

Anna didn’t look back. She spoke quietly to the person behind her. “Let’s go.”

Seeing her distant demeanor, an inexplicable anger flared within Adrian. His expression icy, he followed her.

Julian frowned deeply, about to pursue them, but Mia grabbed his arm.

“Julian, don’t go.” She shook her head, lowering her voice. “Let them resolve it themselves. Anna knows what she’s doing.”
###Chapter 250

Mia Lawrence released his hand and retreated to the corner of the sofa, lost in thought.

Ultimately, matters between them were just that—their own. Outsiders would always remain outsiders.

Julian Garnache didn’t chase after her, as expected. He settled beside her and offered a glass. “Can you drink?”

She nodded, a mix of nerves and happiness bubbling within her, and slowly began to converse with him.

......

Adrian Sinclair gripped Anna Ross’s wrist tightly, pushing her toward the car.

She clung to the doorframe, her eyes reddening.

“Adrian Sinclair, what do you think you’re doing!?”

He paused, his gaze fierce. “Have you forgotten what you promised me this morning?”

Anna frowned. “I haven’t forgotten. But not today.”

He let out a cold laugh. “Of course not today. Otherwise, how would you keep Julian company?”

Adrian closed in, his hands clamping down on her shoulders.

The pain was suffocating. She couldn’t move.

Pinned against the car like a lifeless fish. “I told you, he’s just like a brother to me. What will it take for you to believe me!?”

Her emotions shattered. Tears streamed down her face.

Adrian gripped her chin, studying her tear-streaked cheeks. “Since when do brothers act that intimate?”

Anna’s heart sank inch by inch.

He wouldn’t even grant her that basic trust.

“Think whatever you want.” She shoved him away abruptly and tried to leave.

Adrian held her hand firmly, silent.

She sighed, stifling her sobs, her back turned to him. “I’m tired.”

His eyes narrowed, his expression turning icy.

Anna turned to face him, her demeanor numb. “Let’s go. To the hotel.”

If this was what it took to make him happy, she would accept it.

Adrian clenched his fist, feeling her slip further from his grasp.

After a long moment, he slowly released her hand and laughed mockingly. “Just go.”

Anna whispered her thanks and turned away without hesitation.

Julian Garnache and Mia Lawrence happened to step out just then. Happily, they pulled her away with them.

Adrian remained where he stood, watching her retreating figure, overwhelmed by a sense of powerlessness.

At the dining table, Julian looked at the despondent Anna and couldn’t resist asking, “Anna, Adrian Sinclair isn’t just your boss, is he?”

Mia held her hand tightly. She had cried the entire car ride here, her eyes still swollen.

“He’s my ex-boyfriend.” Anna bit her lip and lowered her head.
###Chapter 251

Julian Garnache was stunned for a moment.

Then it all clicked.

"I see now."

He finally understood the source of the hostility in the other man's gaze.

The questions that had plagued him suddenly had answers.

Anna Ross looked up at him. "Julian, why do you say that?"

Julian sighed softly.

A smile touched his lips. "I just had some questions earlier."

"Now that I've heard your answer, it makes sense."

"What is it?" Mia Lawrence was more anxious than anyone.

Anna also watched him.

She had never revealed her relationship with Adrian Sinclair to anyone.

Was their dynamic so obvious?

Could others see through it at a glance?

Julian rested his chin in his hands.

His eyes curved with amusement. "Isn't it simple?"

"I've only met him three times."

"But each time, I felt intense hostility."

He paused briefly.

"I never understood before."

"Now I finally get it."

"It seems he still has feelings for you."

Mia immediately agreed. "I think so too!"

"You've already broken up."

"Yet his possessiveness is so strong."

"If it's not lingering feelings,"

"then he must have some issues."

"Exactly."

"From a man's perspective…"

The two instantly reached a consensus.

They began talking over each other.

Anna felt a headache coming on.

She finally interrupted. "Stop."

"How could he still have feelings for me?"

Even if he did,

it wouldn't manifest like this.

Everything he did was purely for revenge.

Dishes began arriving at their table.

Julian specifically moved her childhood favorites closer to her.

"There's a saying: those involved are blinded,"

"while spectators see clearly."

"The way he looks at you is definitely not simple."

"You must feel it too."

His gaze…

Anna lowered her eyes.

Her long lashes cast shadows under the light.

His gaze was indeed misleading.

People always said eyes couldn't lie.

But his held only hatred for her.

Hatred that denied her any trust.

Hatred that hurt those around her.

Now she had to be cautious even with friends.

Since that day three years ago,

there was no possibility left between them.

Others might not understand,

but she couldn't afford any illusions.

She shouldn't even think about it.

Anna gripped her fork and knife tightly.

Her voice trembled slightly. "Julian."

"There's no future for us."

"Please don't joke about this anymore."

Seeing her distress, Julian dropped the subject.

"Alright."

"Since it upsets you,"

"we won't talk about it."

"Let's eat first."

Anna looked at the table full of delicious food.

But she had no appetite.

Even though she hadn't eaten since work,

she wasn't hungry at all.

Her emotions felt like they had filled her stomach.

Mia served her many dishes.

She couldn't help advising. "Anna."

"Don't say you're fine,"

"only to cry alone later."

"Even I can guess"

"you must have had reasons for leaving him back then."

"How could someone as smart as him not see it?"

"If you still like him,"

"explain everything clearly."

"Stop torturing each other."

Watching Anna's pain,

her heart felt like it was being cut.

No one knew better than her how much Anna loved Adrian Sinclair.

Seeing them like this now,

she truly didn't know what to do.
###Chapter 252

"Anna dumped him?" Julian's gaze shifted between the two women.

Anna Ross lowered her eyes, silent.

Her fingers unconsciously traced the rim of her glass.

Mia Lawrence set down her fork and knife. "They were together in college. Completely inseparable."

She glanced at her friend, her voice softening. "But then Anna suddenly ended it."

Anna forced a faint smile. "That's all in the past now."

Her fingers trembled slightly. "I... don't have the right to talk about any of that now."

Her mother was still in Howard Lowell's clutches.

She had long lost the freedom to choose.

Besides.

If he knew the truth, he would only despise her more.

It was better to leave completely.

To never see each other again.

"Are you in some kind of trouble lately?" Julian studied her intently. "Working all day, performing at the bar all night."

Mia opened her mouth to speak.

A sharp look from Anna stopped her.

"I just enjoy singing." Anna lifted her face, a light smile playing on her lips. "You know I've always dreamed of being on stage."

Mia sighed quietly.

Forced by circumstances.

Yet pretending everything was fine.

Julian's gaze softened. "You can come to me anytime you need help."

His voice was gentle. "Don't always try to bear everything alone."

Anna nodded slightly.

A warmth spread through her heart.

Mia suddenly raised her glass. "Julian, a toast to you!"

She drained her glass, eyes sparkling.

Julian smiled and finished his drink.

His tear mole looked particularly captivating under the light.

"Someone as wonderful as you..." Mia leaned closer. "...must have a girlfriend by now?"

Anna's movements stilled.

A hand gently squeezed hers under the table.

Julian set down his glass.

After a moment of silence, he suddenly laughed. "Still single, actually."
###Chapter 253

Mia Lawrence's heart raced with secret delight.

She suppressed her inner joy and replied calmly, "It's alright. You can't rush fate. The right person will come along eventually."

Her cheeks flushed with heat beyond her control.

She hastily lowered her head.

Julian Garnache noticed her unusual behavior and asked softly, "Mia, your face is so red. Are you feeling unwell?"

He made a move to stand and check on her.

Mia quickly waved her hands. "I'm really fine!"

She touched her warm cheeks, annoyed at her own lack of composure.

To cover her embarrassment, she picked up her wine glass.

"Maybe the alcohol is getting to me," she explained. "Plus the heating in here is quite strong. That's why my face is red."

She couldn't help laughing at herself.

So this was what having a crush felt like.

It made you nervous over their every word.

It made you rejoice over every tiny detail.

This entirely new experience left her both flustered and thrilled.

"Glad you're okay," Julian said, withdrawing his concerned gaze.

The table fell into a brief silence.

Anna Ross watched their exchange with a slight smile.

She knew her best friend better than anyone.

She had never seen Mia act like this before.

It seemed her feelings were genuine this time.

After dinner, Julian offered to drive them home.

Mia immediately held her forehead dramatically. "Anna, I feel so dizzy. I think I had too much to drink."

"I'll go get some hangover medicine," Anna said, turning to leave.

Mia grabbed her sleeve and gave her a meaningful look.

Julian rolled down the car window. "If you're not feeling well, sit in the front. The view might help."

"Thank you!" Mia quickly climbed into the passenger seat.

She urged, "Anna, get in! Don't just stand there."

Anna sat in the back seat, gazing out the window.

Her mind drifted to Adrian Sinclair.

She wondered if he had returned home yet.

The city glittered with bright lights and bustling crowds.

Yet it felt strangely empty to her.

Everything seemed as fleeting as a dream.

Even he felt like an illusion, ready to slip through her fingers at any moment.

The car came to a gentle stop.

Mia hopped out and playfully opened the door. "Your carriage has arrived, princess."

Anna chuckled and took her hand to step out.

She turned to the driver's seat. "Thank you for the ride, Julian. Drive safely."

Julian nodded warmly and drove away.

"Mia, be honest with me," Anna said, looking at her still-watching friend. "Do you have feelings for Julian?"

Mia admitted freely, "Yes, I like him. And I'm going to make him mine!"

She clenched her fist confidently, as if victory was assured.

The streetlights stretched their shadows long.

Anna burst out laughing. "Well, looks like miracles do happen!"
###Chapter 254

She smiled, her eyes curving into crescents. "Anna, you have to help me. It's rare for me to like someone this much."

"I don't want to get involved in this sort of thing. You should put in the effort yourself." Anna Ross pressed her lips together. She had never done anything like this growing up. She simply wasn't cut out for it.

Mia Lawrence fell silent for a moment. She ran over and grabbed Anna's hand. "You don't have any feelings for him, do you?"

"What nonsense are you thinking?" Anna gently tapped her forehead. "I've always seen him as an older brother. He only sees me as a little sister. You can relax."

Mia leaned against her shoulder affectionately. "That's good. Knowing that, I can pursue him without holding back."

They reached a fork in the road. Mia held onto her hand reluctantly. "By the way, Anna, since Sophia isn't around, come sleep at my place tonight. We haven't chatted in so long. I've missed you terribly."

Anna nodded. "Okay. I've missed you too."

Sophia had been staying with her recently. She really hadn't seen Mia in a long time. This was a rare opportunity, and she was happy about it.

It worked out perfectly that Sophia wasn't home. She didn't have to worry about anything.

She glanced toward the building where she lived. Then she followed Mia in the opposite direction. Her glance was too quick. She didn't notice the light shining from her apartment window.

Adrian Sinclair sat on the sofa. A key rested on the coffee table. He had specifically kept one for himself when he asked Noah to prepare the apartment.

He looked around the once simply decorated space. It had now completely transformed into a warm little nest. Every corner radiated the feeling of home.

This sensation made him relax. He leaned back on the sofa, lost in thought. His gaze fell on a photo on the nearby cabinet. He stood up and picked it up.

It was a picture of Anna and Vivian. In the photo, Anna was smiling, her eyes curved like crescent moons.

Adrian's fingers traced the photo. The corners of his mouth lifted unconsciously.

He had seen a smile like that before. It was truly beautiful. . . .

He put the photo down. His eyes moved to the tightly shut bedroom door. A slight frown touched his brow. Why wasn't she back yet? It was so late.

Anna was currently lying in bed with Mia. They had turned off the lights and were whispering secrets. They talked until the moon hung high in the sky before finally falling into a deep sleep.

Both of them had to get up early for work. The next morning, she headed straight back after getting up.

She was startled to see the man standing downstairs. She lightened her steps, hoping to sneak past him quietly.

Adrian spotted the sneaky figure out of the corner of his eye. He quickly stepped forward. "Why didn't you come home last night?"

Anna responded flatly. "You're overstepping. That's my own business. Besides, it's strange for you to be here this early."

Adrian's eyes drifted elsewhere. He cleared his throat softly. "I have urgent business with you."

He had slept on the sofa all night. His whole body felt uncomfortable now.

He looked down at her sleepy face. His voice softened. "Go get ready quickly. Then come to work with me. I'll wait for you."

Anna thought his expression seemed off. But she couldn't quite place why. She remained silent and walked around him upstairs.

Adrian watched her go up. His mood instantly improved. Judging by the direction she came from, she must have stayed at Mia's place last night.
###Chapter 255

Anna Ross rushed into the bathroom to wash up quickly.

Someone was waiting for her downstairs.

She hurriedly got ready and prepared to leave.

Passing through the living room, she noticed the sofa was messy.

Anna remembered she forgot to tidy up yesterday.

But there was no time for that now.

Adrian Sinclair told her to get in the car once she was downstairs.

She didn't refuse.

Because refusing would be pointless.

The car stopped at the company building.

As soon as Anna stepped out, she was blocked.

Adrian stood in front of her.

He spoke casually. "I haven't had breakfast."

"You need to join me."

Anna froze.

She couldn't help but ask. "Didn't you say it was urgent?"

"Now you want to have breakfast?"

Adrian glanced at her indifferently.

"Even urgent matters require breakfast."

"It's common sense."

He slipped one hand into his pocket and looked ahead.

"I'm your boss."

"I decide how busy we are."

Anna fell silent.

She really shouldn't have asked that question.

He always had his reasons.

Besides, she was a little hungry herself.

Having breakfast together wouldn't hurt.

Seeing her quiet, a smile flickered in Adrian's eyes.

"Made up your mind?"

"Coming along?"

Anna started walking ahead.

She reminded him. "You're the one who asked me to go."

Adrian chuckled and followed.

"I remember."

At the breakfast shop.

He ordered what she loved most in college.

The food arrived.

Anna felt a tightness in her chest.

She stared at the meal, lost in thought.

Adrian sat across from her.

He noticed she wasn't eating.

He raised an eyebrow. "Don't like it?"

"I'll ask the server to change it."

He started to raise his hand.

Anna quickly stopped him.

"Don't change it."

She lowered her head and took a bite.

Adrian watched her eat.

The breakfast tasted especially delicious.

Outside the glass door.

Chloe Valentine happened to pass by.

She saw the two having breakfast together.

Instantly, she was furious.

She had called many times last night.

Adrian hadn't answered any of them.

Now, so early in the morning.

They were having breakfast together.

Could it be...

Were they together last night?

Chloe took a deep breath.

She pushed the door open and entered the breakfast shop.

Her high heels clicked sharply.

She walked to the table with a sweet smile.

"Adrian, so early?"

Adrian looked up.

A flash of impatience crossed his eyes.

Chloe pretended not to notice.

She sat down beside him.

She turned to Anna.

"Executive Assistant Ross is here too."

"Perfect, I haven't had breakfast."

"Let's eat together."
###Chapter 256

Chloe Valentine signaled the waiter.

She ordered her favorite breakfast items.

She deliberately moved closer to Adrian Sinclair.

"Adrian, would you like to order something else?" she asked in a soft, sweet voice. "I can order for you."

Anna Ross kept her head down, quietly eating her breakfast.

She pretended not to hear anything.

"No, this is enough," Adrian replied flatly.

He shifted slightly away, maintaining his distance from her.

Disappointment flashed in Chloe's eyes.

When she turned to look at Anna, her gaze was filled with hatred.

She had clearly seen him smiling earlier.

Now he was so cold toward her.

It was all because of this woman!

She took a sip of water to steady her emotions.

"Anna, what kept you busy last night?" she asked, feigning concern.

Worried about displeasing the man beside her, she added, "Don't misunderstand. It's just concern between colleagues."

Anna inwardly scoffed.

The intention behind the question was too obvious.

She just wanted to find out if Anna had been with Adrian last night.

Calling it colleague concern was utterly unnecessary.

"I was with the most important person last night," she said calmly, eating her porridge. "Slept very well."

The most important person?

When had they become so intimate?

Chloe's mind went into chaos.

She wanted to tear the woman before her to pieces.

Throw her into the ocean to feed the fish.

She looked at Adrian.

Hoping he would deny it.

If he said it wasn't true, she would believe it was all Anna's lies.

But the man's silence confirmed they had been together last night.

It felt like plunging into an icy abyss.

It's over.

Her man was really being taken away.

She had to do something.

Anna staying here was a threat!

Breakfast ended.

Chloe proactively stood next to Adrian.

Anna consciously kept her distance.

Adrian's gaze swept over her.

He thought about how she had deliberately let Chloe misunderstand earlier.

He felt an inexplicable sense of pleasure.

So she cared about him too, didn't she?

Entering the company, Chloe slowed her pace.

She walked side by side with Anna.

"Anna Ross," she said in a low voice. "There's something I must make clear to you."

Anna acted as if she didn't hear.

She continued walking forward.

She knew it would inevitably be about Adrian.

"Adrian will be mine eventually," Chloe said. "He might be fascinated by you now, but he will ultimately marry me. For you, he's just playing around."

The man ahead was on a phone call.

Completely unaware of the turmoil behind him.

Seeing her ignored, Chloe grew even angrier.

"Listen," she said coldly. "I'm saying all this so you recognize your place. Don't overestimate yourself."

Anna let out a light laugh.

She retorted, "Miss Valentine, you know better than I do who's really being played."

Chloe's face changed dramatically.

She suppressed her anger and warned, "So what? I will still become his wife. And you are nothing. You'd better stay away from him on your own accord."
###Chapter 257

Anna Ross looked up at her.

She spoke after a moment, her tone flat.

"Are you so certain he will marry you?"

Chloe Valentine's face instantly darkened.

She grabbed Anna's wrist.

"What do you mean!?"

Her voice was shrill and piercing.

Adrian Sinclair turned at the sound.

Chloe quickly released her grip.

She stood frozen, not daring to move.

He only gave her a brief glance.

"I have a meeting. I'm leaving."

He turned and walked away without hesitation.

Chloe's expression immediately shifted.

She glared viciously at Anna.

"Don't think such words can scare me."

"Adrian will always be mine."

Anna had no desire to continue this.

She stepped past Chloe.

Her words drifted lightly behind her.

"Whether you become Mrs. Sinclair remains uncertain."

Chloe stood rooted to the spot.

She replayed those words over and over.

Suddenly, she lost control and screamed.

The sound echoed through the entire lobby.

Anna Ross!

I hate you!

The documents crumpled in her clenched fist.

Her chest heaved with violent breaths.

Passing employees cast sidelong glances.

She glared back fiercely.

Once she became Mrs. Sinclair.

She would fire every one of these gossiping onlookers first.

Anna returned to her workstation.

She let out a soft sigh.

Chloe probably never considered.

The marriage she obsessed over.

The other party had no intention of proposing.

A new email popped up on her computer.

She collected herself and began working.

During lunch break.

Anna stood by the window gazing into the distance.

Her eyes felt sore and tired.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

Howard Lowell's number flashed on the screen.

She frowned, not wanting to answer.

The call persisted, ringing incessantly.

Eventually, she pressed the answer button.

"What is it?"

Her voice was cold and distant.

Howard Lowell exhaled a cloud of smoke.

"Any news from the old man?"

His tone was uncharacteristically calm.

Anna lowered her gaze.

"No."

Her fingers tightened slightly.

Silence lingered on the other end for a moment.

Then, a low chuckle came through.

"No rush."

"With him speaking on our behalf."

"This matter is practically settled."

Amid the swirling smoke.

His laughter carried an air of absolute confidence.
###Chapter 258

Anna Ross froze in place, her heart almost stopping.

He really did speak up for her.

Howard Lowell's low voice came through the receiver again. "You've been doing well lately, but don't slack off. Keep working to ruin his engagement with the Valentine family. It's best if he becomes completely yours."

Completely his...

Anna silently repeated the words, a bitter smile touching her lips. Other things might have a way out, but this one was absolutely impossible.

She rubbed her sore shoulders and replied softly, "I'll do my best. In fact... I'm already finding ways to drive a wedge between their feelings."

Howard burst into loud laughter, making her eardrums ache. "Good! You really are my good daughter!"

Anna stared blankly at the desk. When did she learn to say one thing and mean another?

The simple, straightforward self she used to be seemed increasingly distant. Was this the price she had to pay for growing up?

Hearing her silence, Howard thought she was resisting. He put out his cigarette and sneered coldly. "As long as you can accomplish this, your mother's debts will be wiped clean."

"Really?" Anna almost dropped her phone.

This was the promise she had dreamed of. If it really came true, she could take her mother far away and completely escape this life of constant fear.

But doubt quickly arose in her. "You promise you won't go back on your word? As long as I ruin the engagement, you'll let my mother go?"

Howard laughed with confidence. "Why would I lie to you? As long as you obey, you'll naturally get your rewards."

Something she had hoped for for so long suddenly becoming reality felt unreal instead.

She took a deep breath and looked toward the office at the end of the hallway. Gritting her teeth, she said, "Fine, I'll stop Adrian Sinclair's marriage alliance with the Valentine family. You must keep your promise too."

As long as her mother could be free.

Adrian stood at the corner, hearing every word she said. His heart felt like it was being squeezed tightly, numb with pain.

So everything she did had a purpose. So she was working for Howard.

So she didn't like him at all, and it wasn't jealousy. It was all planned...

From beginning to end, it was all his own wishful thinking.

He stared at her back, his eyes slightly red. Resentment and despair churned in his chest.

Anna's legs were numb from standing. As soon as she turned around, she crashed into a pair of bottomless eyes. Her breath caught.

How long had he been here? Had he been standing here since she said she would ruin the engagement?

Anna stood rigid, unable to move.

Howard was still chattering on the other end of the line, but she couldn't hear a word. She hung up in a panic.

Adrian's lips curled into a mocking smile. He stepped closer. Anna retreated in alarm, but her waist hit the desk. There was no escape.

"Anna Ross, I heard everything just now." He stared at her intently, his jaw clenched. "So this morning, when you targeted Chloe Valentine, it wasn't because you liked me."
###Chapter 259

Anna Ross stood frozen in place.

When had she ever said she liked him?

But since he had already heard, she no longer bothered to hide it.

She raised a hand to press against his chest, stopping him from coming closer.

"Adrian Sinclair."

"Since you already know."

"I'll be direct."

"I stopped liking you a long time ago."

"From the day we broke up three years ago."

"I've had no feelings for you since then."

She forced down the ache in her heart, making herself meet his gaze.

Adrian continued to advance, his sorrowful eyes locked on her.

Anna tried to retreat, but he grabbed her wrist.

His grip was firm, and she winced in pain.

He pulled her close, leaning down to stare at her face.

"I don't believe you."

"You're lying to me."

"Aren't you?"

He pressed on with stubborn intensity.

Anna turned her face away, but he caught her chin and forced her to look back.

"Anna Ross."

"Tell me."

"Everything you just said was a lie."

A sharp pain shot through her jaw.

She closed her eyes and countered, "Is this really necessary?"

"You already know the answer."

They shouldn't have met again.

They shouldn't be entangled like this.

It was better for everyone this way.

Adrian's eyes reddened, a vein throbbing at his temple.

His voice trembled. "I don't believe it."

"It's all lies."

It sounded like both a mutter to himself and an accusation.

Anna lowered her gaze, feeling his hand shake slightly.

But she no longer had the right to turn back.

She pushed him away harshly and stepped back.

Her voice was icy. "Adrian Sinclair."

"Stop deceiving yourself."

"What you saw and heard."

"Was all real."

"This is who I am."

The words "I stopped liking you a long time ago" stuck in her throat, unspoken.

Her nails dug into her palm.

It hurt, but not nearly as much as the pain in her chest.

She pressed a hand over her heart.

Why did it hurt so much?

She had known all along it was impossible.

Yet she had still held onto hope.

Now it was time to wake up from the dream.

But she couldn't feel any sense of relief.

Adrian collected himself, his eyes fixed on her.

His voice was low and hoarse. "Anna Ross."

"Is Howard Lowell threatening you?"

"Tell me the truth."

He took two steps forward.

She immediately retreated.

"If he's threatening you."

"Tell me."

"I'll help you."

"I won't let him succeed again."

He stopped two meters away.

After all this, couldn't she just give in?

Anna looked at his desolate figure, her heart trembling with pain.

Don't be like this.

That brilliant, spirited young man shouldn't be brought down by someone like her.

Adrian Sinclair.

You deserve a better life.

Not one tangled up with me.
###Chapter 260

She sniffled softly.

When she looked up at him, her eyes were as still as calm water.

Her tone was so flat it betrayed no emotion.

"Adrian Sinclair, how old are you?"

"How can you be so childish?"

She paused for a moment before continuing.

"The reason I'm helping Howard Lowell, I've said it before."

"He and I are family."

"I'm helping him willingly."

She swallowed, forcing down the surging emotions.

"So, stop guessing."

"No one is threatening me."

"And I don't need your help."

Only after she finished speaking did she realize her voice was trembling.

Adrian listened in silence.

He seemed even calmer than before.

Anna Ross was surprised.

She had said so many harsh things.

Yet he hadn't lost his temper.

According to his usual temperament.

He should have dragged her out of the company by now.

Just as she was feeling puzzled, he suddenly spoke.

His voice was calm, his dark eyes locked on her.

"I'll give you one more chance."

"Tell me the truth."

"Otherwise, he can forget about entering the main company."

He saw right through her disguise.

Clearly flustered, yet stubbornly pretending to be calm.

Anna was so angry she was speechless.

He raised an eyebrow, as if he had succeeded.

"Choose."

"Confess, or let all the previous efforts go to waste?"

She lowered her gaze to the floor.

"I'm telling the truth."

"If you hate me, come at me."

"I don't care."

"But don't involve others."

"One thing at a time, you should understand that."

Adrian suddenly took a step forward.

He gripped her wrist, forcing her to meet his eyes.

"Anna Ross, the reason I'm saying all this—"

"You know why."

"Just tell me, and I'll help you no matter what."

There was actually a hint of compromise in his voice.

Anna was stunned.

They were so close, she could even hear his rapid heartbeat.

Was he nervous?

Her lips parted slightly, almost on the verge of blurting it out.

Adrian's eyes lit up, watching her intently.

As if the truth was just a second away.

But she hesitated.

Even if he said he would help—

What then?

Her mother was still in Howard Lowell's hands.

She knew exactly what kind of person Howard was.

If he got leverage, it would never end.

She couldn't drag Adrian into this.

Anna smiled faintly.

Her tone returned to its detached state.

"No matter what you say, my answer remains the same."

"No one is threatening me."

She broke free from his grip and coldly looked away.

His figure was still tall and broad.

But now, it seemed inexplicably lonely.

She looked out the window, her voice as light as a sigh.

"Also, his purpose for entering the company isn't simple."

"Be careful yourself."
###Chapter 261

Howard Lowell had always ordered him to sabotage Adrian Sinclair's marriage plans.

It was to make him lose the powerful support of the Valentine family.

Now he wanted to come to the main company.

Although she knew his true intentions.

But upon careful thought.

What he intended to do probably wasn't that simple.

The light in Adrian Sinclair's eyes, which had dimmed, was reignited.

Was she concerned about him?

"Do you not wish for me to marry Chloe Valentine?"

This was what he had been thinking all along.

Now it slipped out uncontrollably.

He was somewhat afraid to look at her.

Or rather, he was afraid to hear her answer.

He cared deeply.

He didn't want to hear her say no.

Anna Ross's fingers twitched slightly.

Yet she dared not look away.

She didn't know what she truly felt inside.

All along, she had attributed everything to her stepfather's orders.

But did she truly feel nothing?

That was impossible.

Hearing the news of his impending marriage.

Her heart truly ached.

This was something she shouldn't think about.

Nor should she do.

Anna Ross turned her head back.

Forcing a strong smile.

"Didn't you already overhear our conversation?"

"The reason I did these things was to help him."

"There is no other reason."

She had never found speaking to be so difficult before.

Adrian Sinclair lowered his gaze.

His dark hair fell over his forehead with the motion.

It looked somewhat disheveled.

It took a long moment before he lifted his head.

He moved his lips.

Smiling with a trace of bitterness.

His low, magnetic voice carried a hint of bitterness and helplessness.

"Did you truly do all these things."

"Without even the slightest bit of emotional willingness?"

Even just a little.

Was there really none?

Anna Ross looked at him like this.

Her heart felt uneasy.

It was like seeing him again on that day three years ago.

The pain in her heart nearly made her faint.

She struggled to stand by sheer willpower.

Looking seriously into his eyes.

She replied indifferently.

"No."

"Not even a little."

"So stop thinking about it."

"It's meaningless."

Anna Ross didn't dare to stay any longer.

She was afraid that if she stayed one more second, she would cry pitifully in front of him.

Adrian Sinclair stood frozen in place.

Staring blankly in the direction she had left.

He stood there silently for a very long time.

So long that he seemed like a statue placed there.

Suddenly.

He raised his hand to his forehead.

Letting out a self-mocking laugh.

But the sound was so cold it made one shiver.

His Adam's apple bobbed.

His eyes beneath his palm were bloodshot.

Anna Ross, oh Anna Ross.

You truly are a heartless person.

Even after I've gone this far.

You still refuse to give me even a sliver of hope.

So it turned out.

Everything she did was entirely due to Howard Lowell's arrangements.

Not the affection he had presumptuously believed in.

........

Anna Ross ran, clutching her chest.

Tears in her eyes had long blurred her vision.

She stumbled into the restroom.

Leaning against the wall, she could no longer hold back her soft sobs.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry....

It was like this three years ago.

And it's still like this now.

She had hurt the same person twice at different times.

Her pale hands tightly held herself.

Struggling to support her body against the wall to keep from sliding down.

Her lips had long been bitten devoid of color.

If someone were to enter now.

They would see her trembling body.

She desperately wanted to calm down.

But the tears were like a broken string.

No matter what she did, she couldn't hold them back.

Every time she thought of his lost eyes.

Her heart felt as if it were being wrung.

No amount of physical pain.

Could compare to half the pain in her heart.

Just hold on a little longer.

As soon as Howard Lowell releases her mother.

She will take her and leave immediately.

Never to disturb his life again.
###Chapter 262

Adrian Sinclair returned to his office.

He removed his suit jacket.

He sank into the sofa.

The office was silent.

He suddenly picked up his phone.

He dialed a number.

In the garden.

Grandpa Frederick was being pushed for a walk by Henry.

The phone ringtone broke the silence.

"It's Adrian."

Grandpa glanced at the screen.

He pressed the answer button.

"Grandpa."

Adrian's voice was low.

"Have you considered Uncle Howard coming to the main company?"

Grandpa's eyes flickered.

He exchanged a look with Henry.

Henry lowered his gaze without speaking.

"Why ask about this so suddenly?"

Grandpa squinted toward the flower beds.

His tone held curiosity.

Adrian chuckled lightly.

"I hope Uncle Howard can come."

He looked out the window.

A cold glint passed through his eyes.

He had to find out.

What secret existed between Anna Ross and Howard Lowell.

Grandpa was silent for a moment.

He finally sighed.

"You decide."

The call ended.

Grandpa shook his head with a sigh.

"What is that child really planning?"

Henry continued pushing the wheelchair forward.

"Young people have their own plans."

"The sunlight is nice today. You should walk more."

Grandpa smiled.

He said nothing more.

Anna Ross reapplied her lipstick.

She took a deep breath.

She returned to her workstation.

She lowered her head to handle documents.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Adrian approaching.

She immediately held her breath.

Adrian walked straight past.

He didn't look at her once.

Anna's heart sank.

An inexplicable pressure weighed on her.

Suddenly, Lucas Evans appeared.

He waved at her with a smile.

"Anna."

Anna was somewhat surprised.

"What are you doing here?"

"Discussing follow-up cooperation."

Lucas smiled warmly.

"The previous matter has been resolved."

As soon as the words fell.

Adrian walked out of his office again.

He tapped on her desk.

"Come with me to the conference room."

His voice was cold.

"Your participation is needed for the cooperation."
###Chapter 263

Anna Ross took a deep breath and reluctantly replied, "Understood."

He had been so angry just moments ago, and she thought his fury would last. Yet he returned to normal so quickly. She couldn't help but admire that.

Adrian Sinclair said nothing more. He turned and walked toward the conference room. His steps were sharp, his back cold and distant.

Lucas Evans stayed where he was. He waited until Adrian was far away before looking at Anna.

He asked softly, "How have you been lately? It's been a while since we last met."

Anna lowered her eyes, avoiding his gaze. "Same as always. Nothing special."

She stepped around him and continued forward.

Lucas kept pace with her, his tone gentle. "Autumn has arrived in New York. The mornings and evenings are chilly. Remember to dress warmly."

Anna gave a faint nod.

The wind indeed carried a cool edge, swirling a few dried leaves.

Lucas suddenly lowered his voice. "Is he forcing you again?"

Anna's face paled. She urgently signaled for him to be quiet.

She glanced toward the conference room and whispered, "I'm just here to work. No one is forcing me. You should worry about yourself."

Lucas reached out to grab her arm, but she hurried away.

He clenched his fist, determination flashing in his eyes. He would never let anyone pressure her again!

Inside the conference room.

Adrian Sinclair sat alone at the head of the table, his expression unreadable.

Anna and Lucas entered one after the other.

His cold gaze swept over them, irritation rising within him.

So defensive and prickly with him, yet so docile and obedient with others? Could she not see that man's intentions?

A file slammed onto the table with a sharp crack.

"Mr. Evans, if you're here to discuss cooperation, show some professionalism." He looked up, his gaze sharp. "Don't waste my time."

"Did it really take you that long to walk a short distance?" His words carried a hidden meaning as his eyes flicked toward Anna.

She froze in place, not daring to move. He was losing his mind again—he was the one who walked fast, yet he blamed them for being slow.

Lucas calmly took a seat, meeting his gaze. "My legs are my own. I decide my pace."

Adrian scoffed. "Then there's no need to discuss cooperation."

Anna held her breath. These two weren't here to do business. They were here to argue.

A headache was brewing.

"Perfect. I don't care about the cooperation anyway." Lucas looked up, his eyes fixed on the person behind Adrian. "I came today for one reason only: to take her away."
###Chapter 264

Anna Ross looked up at him.

Her thoughts were a tangled mess.

She couldn't understand why he would say something so impulsive.

Adrian Sinclair's lips curved into a faint smile.

It was as if he had heard the most absurd thing.

His words carried a hint of gritted teeth. "Mr. Evans, what makes you think I would agree to let you take her away?"

"Whether you agree or not, I am taking her. She won't have to suffer your torment and threats anymore." Lucas Evans raised his voice, his gaze shifting to Anna.

Adrian didn't look at her. He simply sat in silence.

Chloe Valentine glanced at his straight back.

She then looked at Lucas, her tone firm. "Mr. Evans, this joke isn't funny."

"Anna, I'm serious. I will take you away." Lucas grew anxious because of her reaction, almost standing up.

Adrian closed his eyes lightly.

He rested one hand on the back of the chair, leaning lazily against it.

He waited for them to finish speaking.

Anna felt a wave of powerlessness.

She wasn't worth him doing this. "I won't go with you. Please remember the cooperation matter."

She thought she had made herself clear.

But Lucas seemed completely unconcerned about the cooperation.

He just stared intently at her.

"Anna, don't you understand? None of this matters. I don't want to see you threatened and hurt by him anymore." He stood up, speaking solemnly. "Come with me. I'll take you away from here."

Adrian's eyes darkened instantly.

He curled his lips, his voice turning cold. "It seems Mr. Evans isn't here to discuss cooperation today."

His slender fingers flipped through the documents on the table.

The papers rustled under the gaze of both of them. "I was prepared to discuss cooperation properly today. But your mind seems entirely focused on my Executive Assistant. Our cooperation ends here."

Anna hurried forward a few steps, but didn't dare get too close.

She pressed her lips together. "Please calm down. I won't go with him. Cooperation isn't a joke. How can you cancel it so easily?"

Given his current status, if Lucas's cooperation with him was canceled, many would likely avoid Evans Corporation.

After all, no one wanted to offend someone like him.

"Executive Assistant Ross, you're just an Executive Assistant. Do you think your words can influence my decision?" Adrian was seething with anger.

He was angry that she always took the side of outsiders.

His heart ached as if pierced by countless needles.

A wave of irritable jealousy surged through him.

Anna was frantic, not knowing what to do.

Lucas, however, said carelessly, "Anna, don't beg him. What does it matter if we don't discuss this cooperation?"

"Lucas..." Anna sighed helplessly. "Why must you do this?"

Adrian stood up,恰好 blocking their line of sight.

His jaw was tight, his eyes frighteningly cold.

From this angle, Anna could see his rigid profile.

After a moment, he said lightly, "We have no relationship now. Mr. Evans, you may leave."

Lucas was unwilling, seeming like he was about to charge forward.

Anna quickly stepped forward.

She reminded him calmly. "Mr. Evans, our relationship hasn't reached that level. Please don't say anything about taking me away anymore. You should go."
###Chapter 265

Lucas's Adam's apple bobbed.
His eyes churned with unwillingness.

"Anna, I..." He tried to seize one last chance.

Anna Ross turned her face away.
Her voice was soft but firm.

"Mr. Evans, there's no point in dragging this out."
She dug her nails into her palm.
She forced herself to stay cold.

Adrian Sinclair stood by the window.
His back was like frozen steel.

Lucas stared at him intensely.
He finally gritted his teeth and turned away.

"I'll wait for you to contact me."
The door slammed shut.
The echo vibrated through the room.

Only their breaths remained in the office.
Anna relaxed her tense shoulders.

She met Adrian's gaze as he turned around.
He stepped closer.
His shadow enveloped her.

"The partnership is over."
His fingers tapped the desk.
His voice was low.

"The way he looks at you disgusts me."

Anna clenched the edge of her shirt.
"At least... don't blacklist him."
She looked up.
Pleasure filled her eyes.

Adrian suddenly leaned down.
He gripped her chin.

"Fine."
His thumb brushed the corner of her mouth.
His eyes darkened.

"On one condition."
"He disappears from your world completely."
###Chapter 266

Anna Ross's worried expression instantly brightened.

As long as he agreed.

Everything would be manageable.

As for Lucas Evans.

She had her own methods.

The meeting room door swung open.

A head peeked inside.

They both looked over simultaneously.

Chloe Valentine's eyes lit up upon seeing Adrian Sinclair.

She smiled and hurried in.

"Adrian."

"I just went to your office looking for you."

"Noah said you were discussing a collaboration."

"So I came over."

She stood beside him.

Her gaze completely fixed on him.

Not wanting to spare even a glance for Anna beside her.

Adrian Sinclair gave a slight nod.

He set down his water glass.

"Do you need something?"

"Of course."

"Something very important."

Chloe clasped her hands behind her back.

She leaned forward slightly.

Her smile grew even brighter.

Adrian shot her a brief glance.

Chloe turned to Anna.

Her expression instantly cooled.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

"Adrian and I have important matters to discuss."

"Having an outsider present is inconvenient."

"Please leave."

The term "outsider" made Adrian frown.

But Anna didn't seem to mind.

She responded calmly.

"Then I'll return to my work."

She had just taken a step.

Adrian's deep voice rang out.

"You don't need to leave."

"Stay right here."

"There's nothing you can't hear."

Anna retracted her step.

She looked at him, puzzled.

But he had already settled back into his chair.

As if he had said nothing at all.

Chloe's smile froze on her face.

But she quickly curved her lips again.

This outcome.

She had anticipated it.

Adrian was always different with that wretched woman.

"Since Adrian says so."

"You may stay."

Chloe shot her a cold look.

She turned and walked toward Adrian.

Anna ignored her hostility.

She just didn't understand Adrian's intention.

Watching his back.

Complex emotions surged in her heart.

Chloe stood beside him.

Suppressing her displeasure.

She spoke softly.

"Adrian."

"Regarding what was mentioned in the last meeting."

"We're almost ready on our end."

Adrian looked up.

"Is that so?"

Chloe lightly traced her fingers along his arm.

She smiled charmingly.

She breathed softly near his ear.

"Of course."

"I've been very dedicated."

She provocatively glanced behind her.

Seeing the change in the other's expression.

Her mood improved greatly.

Before Adrian could push her away.

She straightened up.

Producing a file from behind.

"This document needs to be delivered by someone reliable."

Fearing his suspicion.

She added.

"The other party requires it urgently."

"There's nothing I can do."

A flicker passed through Adrian's eyes.

His attention shifted to the file.

"Then you deliver it."

"I find you reliable."

A shadow flashed in Chloe's eyes.

It vanished in an instant.

"Adrian."

"I would go too."

"But I have to visit Grandpa tonight."

"I simply can't spare the time."

She looked at him regretfully.

Her gaze then turned to Anna.

She said with a smile.

"Why not have Executive Assistant Ross deliver it?"

"It's just delivering materials."

"Executive Assistant Ross should be able to handle that, right?"
###Chapter 267

Anna Ross immediately grew alert upon hearing she was to deliver documents.

She remembered the last incident clearly.

Adrian Sinclair reached for the file. "I'll go with her." He reviewed the documents and walked to her side.

His voice was low. "Stop daydreaming. Let's go."

Anna nodded and followed.

Chloe Valentine hadn't expected this. Jealousy burned behind her eyes.

He was defending another woman right in front of his fiancée. He wasn't considering her feelings at all.

"Adrian, you are not going!" She blocked their path, shooting a glare at Anna.

She pulled Adrian closer, her voice pleading. "I'm your fiancée. How can you visit Grandpa without me?"

Anna's heart constricted. She was merely an outsider.

She took the file. "I'll deliver it."

Adrian started to speak, but Chloe held him back. "I'm sure Executive Assistant Ross wants to contribute to the company."

Anna nodded in agreement and quickly left.

"Wait, I haven't given you the full address." Chloe called after her, checking her phone. "Hilton Hotel, Room 8808."

Anna didn't turn back. "Understood."

The door closed softly.

A smug smile spread across Chloe's face, half-hidden by her hair.

Adrian pulled his hand free. "Why the sudden urge to visit Grandpa?"

He had no desire to discuss the marriage.

Chloe picked up a glass. "Let me get you some water." She moved with eager energy.

Adrian sat down without a word.

She finished pouring the water, her cheeks flushing with shyness. "My parents asked me to check on Grandpa. They also wanted an update on the wedding preparations."

Blushing, she set the water glass down.

Adrian looked at the untouched glass. The Valentine family was getting impatient, as expected.

"We'll go after work." He stood and left the reception room.

Chloe stared at the full water glass, a bitter ache in her eyes.

It didn't matter if he didn't love her. She could endure anything, as long as she became Mrs. Sinclair.
###Chapter 268

Anna Ross had just set down the documents when her phone screen lit up.

She frowned slightly at the caller ID.

Pamela rarely contacted her at this hour.

After a moment's hesitation, she answered the call. "Pamela, what's up?"

The background noise was chaotic, and the bar owner's voice was rushed. "Anna, we have a big event at the bar tonight. We're short-staffed. Try to come in early if you can."

Anna glanced at her schedule. She had finished most of her work for the day.

She agreed readily. "Okay, Pamela. I'll be there early."

Pamela gave a few quick instructions before hanging up.

Anna placed her phone back on the desk. Her gaze fell on the document folder beside it.

She needed to deliver these files first.

She checked the time. There was still half an hour until the end of her workday.

She looked around. Adrian Sinclair's office was empty.

Noah Watson happened to walk by, holding a tablet. She quickly called out to him. "Noah."

He stopped. "Yes, Ms. Ross? What do you need?"

Anna explained briefly. "I need to leave early to deliver some documents. Mr. Sinclair is already aware."

Noah nodded. "I'll inform Mr. Sinclair."

After thanking him, Anna picked up the documents and her bag, heading quickly toward the elevator.

Her ride-sharing app showed a car was already waiting downstairs.

She got into the taxi and checked the destination address.

The driver noticed her checking her watch frequently in the rearview mirror. He reassured her, "I know this route well. We'll be there soon."

Anna thanked him quietly. She rolled down the window, letting the breeze ease her anxiety.

Upon arriving at the hotel lobby, she hesitated about going upstairs.

Chloe Valentine had specifically requested she deliver the documents. She wondered what Chloe was planning.

She checked the time again. She couldn't be late for the bar.

She approached the front desk, considering leaving the documents there.

But remembering Chloe's emphasis on their importance, she dismissed the idea.

Finally, she headed toward the elevator.

She found the room according to the number and knocked gently.

The door opened quickly. She handed over the files. "These are the documents Director Valentine requested."

The moment she looked up, she froze in place.

"Lucas? Why are you here?"
###Chapter 269

Lucas Evans paused, his gaze falling on the document she handed him.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "What's this?"

Anna Ross blurted out, "I'm here to deliver a file. Is this the right place?"

As soon as the words left her mouth, she realized something was wrong.

Adrian Sinclair had explicitly rejected the collaboration today. What was the purpose of this document then?

"No, there's no collaboration between our companies." Lucas frowned slightly, his eyes still fixed on the file in her hand.

Right now, it wasn't the file that concerned him. It was something else entirely.

"It's not?" Anna was confused.

She was certain she had the right room number.

She checked the doorplate again and suddenly understood.

This was room 8088. Chloe Valentine had said 8808.

Lucas watched her frustrated expression and asked softly, "Anna, are you alright?"

"I'm fine. I misread the room number. Sorry." Anna turned quickly, annoyed at her own carelessness.

Not only had she made a mistake, but she had also wasted time.

"Anna, wait!" Lucas hurried after her.

Anna looked back, her eyes questioning.

He maintained his gentle smile. "Would you like to come in for a moment?"

Realizing it might seem inappropriate, he added, "Don't misunderstand. I just thought we could talk."

She was single again, yet he rarely had the chance to spend time with her.

A bitter feeling rose in Lucas's heart.

He wouldn't easily let go of the girl he had loved for years.

Anna remembered he had lost the collaboration because of her today. Guilt washed over her.

"Lucas, I..." Her fingers tapped lightly on the hard cover of the file. She finally shook her head. "I won't come in. I have things to do after delivering this. Thank you for the offer."

She understood his feelings. That was exactly why she needed to keep her distance.

Besides, her shift at the bar was about to start. Any more delay and she would be late.

Lucas was silent for a moment, then smiled. "Then I'll walk with you to deliver the file."

He turned to close his door, ready to accompany her.

Anna quickly stopped him. "There's no need. The room is just ahead. I can go by myself."

Lucas was quiet for a beat. He didn't insist, speaking gently instead. "Can you come find me after you deliver it? There's something I want to say to you."

Anna looked down, considering. Her voice was soft. "Lucas, you know... I still have to go to work at the bar. I'm afraid..."
###Chapter 270

"I'll only say a few words. I won't keep you long." His gaze flickered, voice low. "I'll leave right after. I won't bother you again."

The hallway was silent.
She could even hear his rapid heartbeat.
He feigned calm, but his fingers trembled slightly.

Maybe this was for the best.
A clean break.
Then Adrian Sinclair would stop targeting him.

She stayed silent for a moment, then finally nodded. "Alright. I'll be there soon."

"I'll wait for you." A smile spread in Lucas Evans's eyes as he watched her turn away.

Anna Ross walked alone down the empty corridor.
Her footsteps echoed clearly.
She checked the room numbers carefully, not wanting to make another mistake.

After confirming it was correct, she knocked softly.
No response came from inside.
She knocked twice more.

A set of shuffling footsteps grew louder from within.
The door was pulled open.
An obese, greasy man appeared in the doorway.

The man's eyes lit up when he saw her.
He leered at her greedily, his gaze utterly repulsive.

Anna suppressed her disgust and held out the file. "Hello. I'm here to deliver documents."

The man glanced at the file and grinned. "No rush. Come in for a drink."
He reached out to grab her.

Anna dodged in panic, but he seized her arm.
She tried to scream, but he dragged her into the room.

She was thrown heavily to the floor.
The man rubbed his hands together as he advanced.
His face was fleshy, reeking of smoke and alcohol.

Anna gagged. "What are you doing? I'm just delivering documents!"
"Pretty thing, I just want you." He narrowed his eyes, fat bunching on his face.

She scrambled up to run.
The man grabbed her ankle and yanked hard.
She crashed to the floor again, her vision darkening.

Fear made her voice shake. "Please... let me go..."
He hauled her up and threw her onto the couch.

His heavy body pressed down.
His foul breath hit her ear. "Be good. Let big brother take care of you."

His hands touched her.
Anna retched violently, struggling desperately.

The man flew into a rage and slapped her across the face.
"Bitch! Don't be ungrateful!"
He tore at her clothes.

Her cheek burned, her ears rang.
She clutched her collar fiercely. "Get off! Don't touch me!"

Her nails scratched his face.
A line of blood appeared.
He choked her neck, his face twisted. "Move again and I'll kill you!"

Anna choked, struggling for air.
Tears blurred her vision.
Despair swallowed everything.

So disgusting.
It was truly disgusting.
###Chapter 271

A suffocating sensation washed over her like a tide.

Her vision blurred into darkness.

Her fingernails dug deep into her palms.

But it was nothing compared to the increasing pressure around her neck.

The man's sinister gaze locked onto her face.

He admired her gradually dilating pupils.

Only when her breathing grew so faint it nearly stopped did he finally release his grip, satisfied.

"Much more beautiful like this."

His rough fingers stroked her chin.

He let out a disgusting laugh.

His heavy body pressed down on her once more.

Anna Ross turned her head away with great difficulty.

Tears mixed with cold sweat soaked her collar.

She struggled with her last ounce of strength.

Her wrists were already covered in dark bruises.

Why her?

Why did she always have to endure this?

......

Lucas Evans checked his watch for the third time.

The minute hand had moved a full twenty minutes.

A sense of unease grew stronger within him.

He grabbed his jacket and rushed out of the room.

The front desk phone went unanswered.

He barged directly into the security room.

The pair of terrified eyes on the screen made his heart stop.

Room 8808's door was being pounded with thunderous force.

"Open up!"

Bloodshot veins appeared in his eyes.

He wished he could kick the door down.

Anna heard the familiar voice.

A desperate will to survive made her kick over a vase with all her might.

The sound of shattering glass exploded through the room.

The man pinning her down panicked.

The door crashed inward.

Lucas charged in like an enraged lion.

He punched the overweight man, sending him sprawling to the floor.

"You're asking for death!"

Every punch carried lethal intent.

He didn't stop until the man lay limp as a rag.

Then he turned and gathered the trembling woman into his arms.

His jacket enveloped her icy body.

He carefully wiped the tear stains from her face.

When he saw the red handprint, his fist slammed heavily onto the coffee table.

"I'm sorry..."

His voice was hoarse with emotion.

He wished he could have endured this in her place.

A phone ringtone cut through the tension.

Julian Garnache's anxious voice came through.

"Anna, where are you?"

She opened her mouth but no sound emerged.

Lucas took the phone and provided the address.

After hanging up, he gently held her hand.

"Don't be afraid."

His voice was so soft, as if afraid of startling her.

Anna curled up in the corner of the sofa.

Her long eyelashes trembled uncontrollably.

Those terrifying sensations lingered.

They followed her like a shadow.
###Chapter 272

Elsewhere.

Chloe Valentine glanced at her wristwatch.

A smug smile touched her lips.

The timing was perfect.

She reached for Adrian Sinclair's hand.

Turning to the old man, she offered a sweet smile.

"Grandpa, it's getting late. I should head back. I'll visit again soon."

Adrian looked down at her hand.

He withdrew his own without a word.

The old man beamed, his expression kindly.

"Good, good. I'm just happy you care." He smiled at his grandson. "Adrian, see Chloe home."

Adrian gave a slight nod.

He rose and led her out of the manor.

The car was unusually quiet.

Chloe's uncharacteristic silence was a relief.

They passed the Marriott Hotel.

Chloe spoke up suddenly.

"Adrian, Executive Assistant Ross came here to deliver documents. Let's go check."

"Unnecessary." Adrian didn't slow down.

Chloe tightened her grip on the seatbelt.

"Please, let's check. That client has a bad reputation. I'm worried she might be in trouble."

Adrian frowned.

He hit the brakes.

Chloe hid her delight.

She pushed the door open and hurried toward Room 8808.

The door was slightly ajar.

The room was a disaster.

Chloe felt a chill.

This was more extreme than she had planned.

Was Anna Ross even alive?

A sinister smile curled her lips.

She deliberately pulled Adrian inside.

A heavyset man emerged from the bathroom, cursing.

Seeing Chloe, his anger flared.

He snorted and collapsed onto the sofa.

Chloe's heart sank.

Something was wrong.

She frowned.

"Mr. Klein, where is the girl who delivered the documents?"

Why was he alone?

And why was he bruised and battered?

This wasn't right!

The man was even more furious.

"What a disgrace! Your company's people have no shame!"

Adrian's eyes turned icy.

He strode forward and grabbed the man's collar.

His jaw clenched.

"Where is the person who delivered the documents? What did you do to her?"

The man was intimidated by his presence.

He froze in fear.

His eyes flicked toward Chloe.

Suddenly, he found his courage.

"Mr. Sinclair, how would I dare touch your employee? You should ask what your people did!"

"What do you mean?" Adrian's voice was cold as steel.

His gaze was sharp.

"What do I mean?" The man pointed at his face.

"Your employee tried to seduce me, then had someone beat me up! I should be asking you!"

Seduce?

A vein throbbed at Adrian's temple.

He tightened his grip.

"Where is she?"

The man choked, gasping for air.

He frantically slapped at Adrian's hand.

"I... cough... I don't know..."

"Adrian!" Chloe called out fearfully.

She wanted to stop him but didn't dare.

Adrian released him with a shove.

He issued a sharp warning.

"You'd better hope she's unharmed."

He turned and rushed out of the room.

He ignored Chloe behind him.

Chloe glared at the man on the floor.

"Useless," she muttered.

She hurried after Adrian.

Adrian walked quickly, dialing his phone.

In his anxiety, a faint sound caught his attention.

He frowned at the door.

He raised his hand and knocked.
###Chapter 273

The door was pushed open.

Adrian Sinclair stood at the doorway, his expression dark.

He shoved Lucas Evans aside and charged into the room.

A figure was curled up on the sofa.

Anna Ross was startled and looked up.

Her face was deathly pale, devoid of any color.

Only her left cheek was swollen and red, a stark and painful contrast.

Adrian's heart clenched violently.

It felt like something sharp had pierced through it, the pain leaving him speechless.

Lucas stepped in front of him, his voice icy. "How dare you show your face here?"

His gaze was like a knife, cutting into Adrian. "Look what you've done! Why did you have to make her deliver the files?"

His fists were clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. "If I hadn't arrived just in time, she would have been finished!"

Adrian withdrew his gaze, his eyes cold. "My affairs are none of your concern."

"Adrian Sinclair!" Lucas roared, a vein throbbing at his temple.

He almost threw a punch, but a glance at Anna made him force himself to hold back.

Chloe Valentine rushed in, flustered.

Seeing the scene inside, she covered her mouth in shock. "Oh my god, what happened?"

Lucas sneered. "What happened? Don't you know best? Stop pretending to be innocent."

His eyes swept over them both, full of contempt.

Chloe trembled as she looked at Adrian, meeting his scrutinizing gaze.

She quickly lowered her head and hurried over to Anna.

Taking in Anna's disheveled state, Chloe inwardly cursed her for being useless.

She forced a concerned expression and reached out to pull Anna up. "Anna, I'm so sorry, I truly had no idea the client would be like this…"

Anna shifted away from her touch, remaining silent.

The truth was something this person knew all too well.

Chloe gritted her teeth, feeling that Anna was deliberately embarrassing her.

To maintain her image, she lowered her eyes, her voice choked. "If I had known this would happen, I would have come myself…"

Anna closed her eyes, pulling the coat tighter around herself.

Chloe suddenly grabbed Anna's hand and tried to bring it to her own face. "If you're angry, just hit me, I…"

"Enough!" Adrian cut in sharply.

Chloe flinched, freezing in place.

Adrian stepped forward.

Lucas immediately blocked him. "You think you can take her away? Absolutely not!"

He shielded Anna, his voice resolute. "I won't give you another chance to hurt her!"

His eyes burned with anger. "I used to think you were just cold, but I never imagined you could be this disgusting! For the sake of some lousy deal, you let her suffer like this. Are you even human?"

Adrian's face turned ashen, his eyes bloodshot.

He suddenly threw a punch, landing it hard on Lucas's face. "Her matters are none of your concern!"

Anna jumped up in alarm, rushing to steady the staggering Lucas.

The coat slipped off in the chaos.

Adrian's pupils constricted violently.

Her dress was torn, the fabric at her shoulder unable to hide the dark, bruised fingerprints.

His fists clenched until the veins on the back of his hands bulged.
###Chapter 274

Lucas Evans bent down to pick up his jacket.
He placed it back over her shoulders.

"I'm fine." His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed the metallic taste in his mouth.
Adrian Sinclair's punch had been brutal and precise, nearly shattering his jaw.

Anna Ross opened her mouth to speak.
Before any sound could escape, she was yanked into an embrace.

Adrian's arms locked around her, tight enough to hurt.
His icy gaze cut toward Lucas. "Stay away from her."

"If there's a next time, I won't hesitate to make you disappear."

Lucas let out a derisive laugh.
He reached for her hand. "She's her own person, not your property."

"What happens between us is none of your business."

Anna broke free from the embrace.
She stumbled backward.

"Thank you, Lucas." Her lashes lowered, voice barely a whisper. "But it's impossible."
"Please don't look for me again."

She turned and steadied herself against the wall.
She didn't dare look back.

The hallway lights stretched her shadow long and thin.
Each step crushed the light in Lucas's eyes.

He collapsed onto the sofa.
His hands covered his face.

Only suffocating silence remained in the room.

......

The night wind outside the hotel was biting.
As Anna descended the steps, she nearly collided with Julian Garnache.

"Anna!" He rushed forward to steady her wobbling frame. "You're so pale. Do you need a hospital?"

She shook her head, her eyelashes damp. "Julian, what are you doing here?"
"The bar owner said you'd disappeared. I was worried." He frowned, studying her. "Are you sure you're okay?"

Before she could answer, hurried footsteps sounded behind them.
Adrian emerged, reaching for her wrist. "I'll take you home."

Anna sidestepped his touch.
She looked at Julian. "Could you please take me back?"

Julian immediately guided her toward his car.
Adrian moved to block them, but Chloe Valentine grabbed his sleeve.

"Adrian, she doesn't want to go with you." Her voice trembled. "Don't force her."

Adrian shot her a cold glance.
Chloe released his arm as if burned.

When she looked up again, the black sedan had vanished into the night.

Chloe sighed softly. "Anna is certainly popular."
"One admirer just left, and another is already waiting."

She glanced at Adrian's tense profile from the corner of her eye.
Secret delight bloomed in her chest.

Then, a voice colder than ice shattered her moment.
"You'd better have an explanation for tonight." Adrian narrowed his eyes, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Cold sweat dampened Chloe's palms.
She forced a wounded expression. "I never expected things to turn out like this..."

"I'm so sorry, Adrian..."
###Chapter 275

"I will only say this once. Stay away from her." Adrian Sinclair's voice was icy, his eyes frosted over with cold fury. "Or I won't hesitate to show you no mercy."

Chloe Valentine had never seen him look so terrifying. His gaze seemed capable of devouring her whole.

She shrank back, shoulders hunching slightly, forcing a facade of calm. "Adrian, I truly don't understand what you're talking about. I was worried about what happened today too, but it really had nothing to do with me. I don't know how things turned out this way."

Adrian frowned, turning his side to her, and walked straight to his car.

He glanced up at the tall building. Someone dared to touch what was his. It seemed they found life in New York too comfortable.

Chloe bit her lip hard. She couldn't understand it. What was so special about that Anna Ross? Why did every man orbit around her!

If Lucas hadn't shown up and ruined everything, Adrian would have witnessed the entire spectacle firsthand today. What a pity...

And that Julian Garnache. How was he connected to her? They looked so intimate. Did he like her too?

It was infuriating. How did she deserve so much attention?

Just as Chloe was fuming, her face turning pale with anger, Adrian impatiently honked the horn. She hurried over and got into the car.

If it didn't work this time, there would be a next. She refused to believe Anna could always escape unscathed.

In the vast expanse of New York, the sunset was slowly sinking. Pale golden afterglow spread across the clouds, draping the entire city in a layer of gold. It was breathtakingly beautiful.

Anna leaned back in the passenger seat, turning to look at the scenery outside the window. Exhaustion was written all over her face.

In the past, she would have taken out her phone to capture this stunning moment. But now, she just felt tired. Utterly drained, both physically and mentally.

All she wanted right now was to go home, take a good shower, and wash away everything that happened today.

Julian glanced at her, concern etching his features. "Anna, are you sure you're alright? You don't look well."

Though he didn't know what happened upstairs, seeing her like this pained him. He always saw Anna as a younger sister.

Anna turned her head weakly, every movement sapping the last of her strength. Her chapped lips made her frown slightly, but she still whispered, "I'm fine. I just need to rest."

She looked down at the bruise on her wrist and silently covered it with her sleeve. The place on her face where she'd been hit still throbbed faintly. Thankfully, she'd bought some medicine at the pharmacy and applied it, which had provided some relief.

Julian knew her temperament and didn't press further. He nodded, changing the subject. "By the way, I saw Chloe Valentine with Adrian earlier. Do you know what their relationship is?"

"Chloe Valentine?" Anna didn't look up, her voice flat.

Julian's eyes flickered. He gave a light laugh. "Yeah."

Anna looked at him. After a moment of silence, a faint smile tugged at her lips. "They're probably getting married soon."

Even she was surprised by the strange feeling in her chest when she said those words. It was as if she was unwilling to acknowledge a certain truth, yet that was exactly what it was.

Julian seemed slightly taken aback but quickly returned to normal. He chuckled softly. "I should have guessed." She was always an ambitious woman.
###Chapter 276

Anna Ross tilted her head slightly.

The streetlight outlined her puzzled profile.

"Julian, what do you mean by that?"

Julian Garnache tapped his fingers lightly on the steering wheel.

"Nothing," he smiled faintly.

He ended the topic there.

Anna turned back around.

The night breeze brushed through her hair.

She didn't press further about that person.

Her phone vibrated inside her bag.

The screen lit up with a message from Mia Lawrence.

It also showed her chat history with Julian.

A smile touched Anna's lips.

She could see right through her best friend's poorly concealed feelings.

Her gaze shifted to the man in the driver's seat.

She hesitated to speak.

His true feelings were still unclear.

If he still had lingering attachments to Chloe Valentine,

where would that leave Mia?

Julian noticed her staring.

He glanced over warmly.

"What's wrong? Just say whatever's on your mind."

"Since when are you shy around me?"

Anna took a deep breath.

She asked softly, "What do you think of my best friend?"

She had considered being more direct.

But ultimately chose a gentler approach.

Matters of the heart couldn't be rushed.

"She's great," Julian kept his eyes on the road.

"Pretty and cheerful."

His tone was as casual as if he were discussing the weather.

Anna studied his profile.

"Then have you noticed,"

"that she acts differently around you?"

His phone screen suddenly lit up.

Mia's name flashed briefly.

Anna saw it clearly.

Julian picked up his phone while waiting at a red light.

The corner of his mouth lifted as he replied.

His fingertips tapped lightly on the screen.

Anna looked out at the traffic.

"You still haven't answered my question."

Julian put his phone back in his pocket.

His fingers unconsciously rubbed the steering wheel.

"That... I'm not really sure either."

"Green light!" He straightened up.

His focus returned to the road ahead.

A slight smile curved Anna's lips.

At least based on his reaction,

he probably had some feelings for Mia.

The car stopped at the entrance to her apartment complex.

Anna unbuckled her seatbelt.

"Julian, would you like to come up for a bit?"

"No," Julian shook his head.

"I have things to take care of at the bar."

He handed her the medicine.

"Remember to apply this. Contact me anytime if you need anything."

Anna nodded and said goodbye.

She watched the car drive away.

She looked down at the medicine bag in her hand.

Turning around, she almost bumped into someone behind her.

Before she could apologize,

she recognized the face.

"Sophia, when did you get here?"

Sophia Roscente quickly grabbed her arm.

"Just arrived a moment ago."

"What happened to your face?"

Anna raised her hand to touch her cheek.

"Just an allergy," she said lightly.

Thankfully, Lucas's jacket helped conceal it.

Sophia nodded.

But her gaze drifted into the distance.

"Sis,"

"who was that who just dropped you off?"
###Chapter 277

They walked quietly along the road.

Anna Ross glanced sideways at her companion's wary expression and responded calmly, "He's a friend. He just gave me a ride home since it was on his way."

A friend?

Sophia Roscente turned her head warily to look back. She was firmly on her cousin's side. She couldn't let another man get ahead.

Since her cousin wasn't here, she would have to be the protector.

Anna took out her keys to unlock the door. She looked puzzled at the silly grin on the other girl's face. "Sophia, what's wrong with you?"

She had been so serious just a moment ago. Now she was grinning foolishly. Her mood changed too quickly.

Sophia snapped out of her thoughts and stopped smiling. She followed Anna inside to change her shoes. "Sis, does my cousin know that guy?"

Anna's hand paused while placing the keys. She smiled bitterly. She set the keys on the console table and bent to remove her shoes. "He knows."

It was more than just knowing. He was openly hostile toward him.

"What was his reaction? His attitude? Wasn't he even a little bit nervous?" Sophia was so anxious she nearly jumped.

If her cousin lost such a wonderful girlfriend, she would be furious.

Anna picked up a water glass from the coffee table and took a drink. She was very thirsty. Only after her throat felt soothed did she set the glass down. She answered unhurriedly, "What reaction could he have? He just takes his resentment toward me out on other people."

She gazed out the window at the darkening sky. Her heart felt hollow.

Sophia didn't agree. She pulled Anna toward the sofa. "My cousin doesn't hate you. He's jealous. He acts like that because he likes you."

"So you shouldn't pay attention to other men from now on. Being with my cousin is what's best." She giggled. Her hands had just touched Anna's shoulders when she heard a pained hiss. She quickly let go.

Anna shifted away. She tried to hide the injuries on her body.

Sophia saw her pale face. She thought her words had made Anna angry. She hurried to explain, "Sis, I was just joking. Please don't be mad at me, okay?"

She looked at her own hands,不知所措. Tears nearly fell.

Cecilia Roscente always said she was careless and didn't know her own strength. She used to disagree. Now she had to admit it was true. If her favorite sister started hating her because of this, her heart would truly break.

Anna watched her rapidly changing expressions. She knew the girl was overthinking again. She gently patted her shoulder. "I'm not angry. It's just that there's no future for me and your cousin. Please don't say things like that anymore."

"Sis..." Sophia pouted pitifully.

Anna smiled and stood up. "I'm going to take a shower."

She entered the bathroom and took off her jacket to check her injuries. The strangulation marks on her neck had faded somewhat. But the scratches on her shoulders were still oozing a little blood. They had begun to scab.

She took off the torn dress and turned on the shower. Warm water streamed down. Her tense emotions finally relaxed a little.

She looked at the places that man had touched. A wave of nausea hit her. She scrubbed fiercely, as if she wanted to scrape off a layer of skin.
###Chapter 278

Thank goodness.

Thank goodness that man didn't succeed.

Otherwise, she didn't know how she would face the rest of her life.

Tears silently fell.

They mixed with the warm stream of water.

She tasted salt at the corner of her lips.

Steam filled the bathroom.

No one could see her vulnerability.

People came and went downstairs.

Their gazes were drawn to the man with exceptional presence.

Adrian Sinclair ignored all the attention.

He only stared at the lit window.

Finally, he suppressed the urge to go upstairs.

He turned and drove away.

Bar lights shimmered.

Julian Garnache mixed drinks behind the counter.

The aroma of alcohol attracted a crowd.

Someone marveled.

The boss's mixing skills are truly legendary.

Another agreed.

It's worth it just to have one drink.

Julian remained expressionless.

He focused on his movements.

Light and shadow outlined his profile.

Adding an air of mystery.

His phone screen suddenly lit up.

A message from an unknown number.

[Need to talk. Meet me outside.]

He frowned at the screen.

No location was shown.

Thinking it was a wrong number, he ignored it.

He handed the finished drink to a customer.

He took a small sip himself.

His skills were slightly off today.

His phone vibrated again.

It was especially noticeable in the dim light.

Someone reminded him to check it.

It was the same number.

He was about to block it.

The new message content made him pause.

He immediately called back.

No one answered.

He gripped his phone tightly.

His expression turned grave.

Someone was threatening to meet him using Anna Ross's safety.

Was it an enemy?

No matter what, he couldn't let her get hurt.

He replied agreeing to meet.

Early the next morning.

An alarm clock woke Anna Ross.

She got up and got ready for work.

She removed the medicated patch in the mirror.

After applying heat and medicine last night.

Her cheek had returned to normal.

As she reached the entryway to change shoes.

Her phone rang.

It was her mother calling.

Vivian Lowell's urgent voice came through immediately.

Anna, come to the hotel quickly.

I have something urgent to discuss.
###Chapter 279

Anna's fingers trembled.

She responded quickly. "Alright. I'll be right there."

After hanging up, she hurriedly put on her shoes.

She hailed a taxi and rushed to the hotel.

She didn't need to guess.

It had to be another problem caused by Howard.

That's why he was so eager to summon her.

Her mother was in his grasp.

She had become his most convenient tool.

She arrived at the hotel room door.

She knocked urgently.

The door opened quickly.

Vivian appeared behind it.

A gentle smile graced her face. "Anna, you're here. Come in. Your father has something to discuss."

She took Anna's hand and led her inside.

She brought her directly to Howard.

The man was sitting on the sofa, smoking.

Seeing her arrive, he motioned for her to sit down.

The thick smoke made Anna cough repeatedly.

She covered her mouth and nose. "Could you please not smoke? The smell is awful."

Vivian sat beside her.

She gently pressed Anna's hand.

She shook her head, signaling her not to say more.

Angering Howard would bring trouble for both of them.

Compared to their past life, this was already better.

Anna understood their situation.

She turned her head away and fell silent.

But Howard continued smoking quietly.

This made her increasingly uneasy.

This was likely the calm before the storm.

She watched as Howard stubbed out his cigarette.

She instinctively moved to protect her mother.

She spoke nervously. "I did my best with that matter. But the outcome was beyond my control."

If he attacked now, she would fight him with everything she had.

The room fell into brief silence.

After a moment, Howard suddenly burst into laughter.

He looked at her cheerfully. "This was a great success. The old man has agreed to let me into the headquarters."

"I should thank you. You did a beautiful job!"

Vivian gently held her hand.

She smiled softly. "Anna, you did very well this time."

Anna was still in shock.

She stared blankly at her mother.

Judging by their delighted expressions, it was probably true.

But...

She couldn't understand it.

Adrian's attitude before clearly showed he wouldn't help.

Especially since he had overheard that phone call.

What exactly happened?

As she was lost in thought, Howard stood up.

He sat down next to the mother and daughter.

He sat close to her.

A meaningful smile never left his face.

"Anna, be honest with me. Have you already won over that Adrian kid?" His eyes gleamed shrewdly. His smile was full of calculation.

She didn't answer immediately.

She just lowered her head.

Vivian gently patted her hand.

She said softly, "Anna, you two talk. I'll go wash some fruit."

She made to leave.

But Anna didn't want to let go.

She didn't want to be alone with Howard.

Yet Vivian still got up and left.

Only the two of them remained on the sofa.
###Chapter 280

Howard Lowell cleared his throat softly.

His gaze locked onto her.

"Don't be nervous. Just tell me the truth."

If this succeeded, his career would skyrocket.

The plan was flawless.

Anna Ross turned her face away.

She tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear.

Two quiet words escaped her lips. "No."

Disappointment flickered in Howard's eyes.

He quickly suppressed his suspicion.

Perhaps the girl was lying.

Otherwise, why would Adrian Sinclair speak up for him?

He lifted his teacup and took a slow sip.

Leaning back against the sofa, he relaxed. "It's fine."

"Just stay by his side."

Anna's fingers clenched abruptly. "But you promised—"

He cut her off mid-sentence.

Howard crossed his legs.

A deep, calculating look settled in his eyes. "Anna."

"It's time you grew up."

He watched her sideways. "Getting into the company is just the beginning."

"What comes next still depends on you."

Anna bit her lower lip hard.

She should have seen his true nature long ago.

Only profit mattered to him.

"I'm just an executive assistant."

She turned toward the window.

Her chest felt tight and aching. "I can't help with work matters."

Howard suddenly laughed. "Precisely because you're his assistant."

He leaned forward, closing the distance. "That's what makes you crucial."

Anna whipped her head around.

She met his dark, intense stare. "What exactly are you trying to achieve at headquarters?"

Howard stood and walked to the window.

He pressed his palm against the glass.

His eyes fixed fiercely on the scene below.

"Taking back what's rightfully mine."

His voice turned icy. "Seizing control of the company."

"Making Adrian Sinclair disappear."

His shoulders shook with silent laughter.

He seemed utterly confident of victory.

Anna's nails dug into the sofa cushions.

A cold dread spread through her body.

She had unknowingly become an accomplice.

She was pushing Adrian straight into a trap.

She covered her mouth.

Swallowing back the sob in her throat.

Howard paced back to stand before her.

A faint smile played on his lips. "I understand your difficulties."

He glanced around the room.

Lowering his voice, he whispered. "After everything is done."

"Those account books are yours to handle."

The offer was tempting enough.

He was certain she would agree.
###Chapter 281

Anna Ross's fingertips trembled slightly.

She knew exactly what the disappearance of the ledger meant.

The suffocating weight of debt would vanish into thin air.

Her mother would finally be free from his control.

Howard Lowell tapped the tabletop.

"Anna, have you made your decision?"

His voice carried an undeniable pressure.

The offer was indeed tempting.

Freedom was within reach.

But she clutched the hem of her clothes, remaining silent.

Adrian Sinclair's face flashed through her mind.

She couldn't harm him.

Howard narrowed his eyes.

He picked up his teacup and took a slow sip.

"You only get one chance."

"That money—you could work yourself to death for half a lifetime and still not pay it back."

Anna's heart constricted.

He was right.

That debt was a bottomless abyss.

Howard suddenly leaned forward.

"Or perhaps—" he drew out the words, "you've developed real feelings for him?"

"No!"

The denial burst from her lips.

She immediately turned her face away.

Her heart raced wildly.

Howard scoffed.

"Better not have."

"Remember, he is my enemy."

"Your only task is to use him."

The word "use" pierced her ears like needles.

Anna jerked her head up.

"I can't do it."

Howard's expression froze.

He clearly hadn't expected her refusal.

"Are you insane?" He grabbed her shoulder. "The ledger—"

Anna shook him off forcefully.

"I will repay the money."

"But don't expect me to help you hurt anyone else."

Howard's face darkened instantly.

He drummed his fingers on the table.

"I'll ask one last time."

"Do you agree or not?"

Anna stood straight and tall.

"My answer won't change."

Howard suddenly laughed.

He strolled leisurely to Vivian's bedroom door.

"What about your mother then?"

"Will you abandon her too?"

Anna's throat tightened.

Her mother was her weakness.

But this time, she couldn't give in.

"You promised," her voice trembled. "You said you'd let Mom go if I helped you get into the main company."

Howard played with his lighter.

"I did say that."

"But the condition was that you continue working for me."

Anna's nails dug into her palms.

She should have seen it sooner.

This man would never keep his word.

Vivian emerged carrying a fruit platter.

Sensing the tense atmosphere, she gently took her daughter's arm.

"Anna, what's wrong?"

Anna shook her head.

She forced a smile.

"It's nothing, Mom."

Some storms, she had to weather alone.
###Chapter 282

Howard Lowell slammed the table and stood up. "This is the daughter you raised! I've provided for her all these years for nothing. Now she won't even do this one thing for me!"

He collapsed onto the sofa in a rage. Grabbing a pear from the fruit bowl, he took an angry bite and turned his back to them.

Vivian Lowell flinched at the noise. She glanced nervously at her daughter. "Anna... could you please help your father? Just this once?"

A sharp pain pierced Anna Ross's heart.

"Mom, I already hurt him once before. I can't do it again."

Vivian took half a step back at her daughter's raised voice. Her fingers unconsciously twisted the fabric of her shirt.

Anna immediately regretted her outburst. She hurried to steady her mother. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have shouted."

Vivian forced a weak smile. "I understand this is difficult for you. But we truly have no other choice this time."

Howard snorted coldly without turning around. "If she refuses to help, you'll have to deal with the consequences yourself."

The pallor of her mother's face stabbed at Anna's heart. Her mother meant everything to her. She could never stand by and watch her suffer.

"Anna, if it's really too much, then I'll just—"

"Don't say it!" Anna cut her off urgently. "I'll do it."

"Really?"

They both turned to look at her with surprised hope.

Anna nodded slowly. She would pretend to agree for now. But she would never actually hurt Adrian Sinclair.

Howard's expression instantly brightened. He eagerly pulled them both to sit down. "See? That's my good girl. You should have been this sensible from the start."

A lump formed in Anna's throat. She sat for only a few moments before standing to leave.

"Anna, let me walk you out." Vivian took her daughter's arm, casting an anxious glance at her husband.

Howard was in too good a mood to object. He waved his permission.

"Anna, do you still feel guilty about breaking up with Adrian all those years ago?" Vivian asked softly as the elevator doors closed.

Anna pulled herself from her thoughts. She shook her head gently.

"Mom, that's all in the past now."

Vivian sighed. "I can tell you still care about him. If that's true, why not explain everything to him?"

Anna's gaze grew distant. Explain? She was the one who had pushed him away. What right did she have to ask for forgiveness now?

"Anna, if it weren't for that person... you two might have..." Vivian's voice choked with emotion, thick with regret.

Anna gently wiped her mother's tears. "Mom, our breakup just means we weren't meant to be. I've moved on."

"Anna..."

Vivian's tears fell freely now. If not for her own failed marriage, her daughter could have had a perfect life.

The empty elevator filled with the sound of suppressed sobs.

"Ding—"

The doors slid open. Harsh light flooded the compartment.

Anna blinked, then took her mother's arm. "Let's go."
###Chapter 283

Adrian Sinclair had witnessed that scene years ago.

Her mother's ex-husband had threatened Vivian to force her into leaving.

They had already broken up by then.

Yet Adrian stubbornly refused to let go.

But she had no choice.

To protect her mother, she had to sever their connection ruthlessly.

"Anna, are you crying?"

At the hotel entrance, Vivian Lowell searched through her bag for tissues.

Anna Ross reached up and touched her cheek.

Her fingertips came away wet.

A self-mocking smile tugged at her lips.

Anna Ross, you weren't the one who got hurt.

What right do you have to cry?

She wiped her tears hastily.

"Mom, I'm fine," she reassured softly. "You should head upstairs. I need to get going."

Vivian studied her daughter with concern, guilt clouding her eyes.

"Anna, I'm sorry. I've become a burden to you."

Seeing her mother on the verge of tears again, Anna quickly explained, "Mom, I've never once thought of you as a burden. Please don't say that."

Vivian gently cupped her daughter's face, tears glistening in her eyes.

Having such a daughter was a blessing she felt she didn't deserve.

"Mom, please go up. I really have to leave now." Anna checked the time, her voice anxious yet reluctant to leave her mother alone outside.

Knowing her daughter had commitments, Vivian offered a few more words of care before entering the hotel.

Anna watched until her mother disappeared inside before turning away.

She walked slowly along the sidewalk.

The street was congested with traffic, horns blaring intermittently.

But she heard none of it.

Her mind was in turmoil.

Adrian appeared cold and distant on the surface.

Yet he had been helping her secretly all along.

If Howard Lowell hadn't told her, she would never have known about his assistance.

Buzz...

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

Seeing Adrian's name on the caller ID, her heart fluttered nervously.

After a moment's hesitation, she answered.

"Thank you for helping me. I'll remember this kindness."

She spoke before he could utter a word.

Silence lingered on the other end.

Adrian held the steering wheel with one hand.

It took him a second to comprehend her meaning.

He raised an eyebrow, responding coolly, "It was just a casual mention. No need for thanks."

Anna stopped walking, unsure how to reply.

"Where are you right now?" Adrian asked suddenly.

She glanced around blankly.

Spotting a landmark, she answered softly, "I'm at New World Town Square."

"Stay there. I'll come get you."

He hung up before she could respond.

Anna put her phone back in her bag and found a shaded spot under a tree to wait.

Soon, Adrian's car pulled up in front of her.

"Get in." He rolled down the window, frowning slightly at her under the tree.

Anna opened the car door.

The back seat was piled high with items.

She hesitated, unsure what to do.

Adrian's voice came from the driver's seat. "Sit up front. The back isn't available."

Resigned, she closed the door and took the passenger seat.

As she settled in, Adrian suddenly leaned toward her.

Anna, who was fastening her seatbelt, flinched backward.

"What are you doing?" she asked warily, her eyes fixed on him.
###Chapter 284

Adrian Sinclair grabbed her wrist and pulled her back.

He reached out and gently removed the fallen leaf from her hair before releasing her.

Anna Ross realized she had made a fool of herself again and silently lowered her head to fasten her seatbelt.

The engine started.

Anna looked out the window, her unease growing stronger.

Should she tell him about today’s events?

Although Adrian had risen to prominence over the past two years, Howard Lowell was a cunning old fox. He might not be easy to defeat.

But what about her mother?

Anna leaned back in her seat, unaware of how pale she looked.

Adrian noticed her unusual behavior and casually asked, “Is something wrong?”

She nodded at first, then shook her head and sat up straight.

She was still debating whether to speak. She couldn’t reveal anything yet.

Adrian chuckled softly. She really couldn’t hide her thoughts. “I’m guessing it’s about your stepfather?”

“How did you know?” Anna turned to him in surprise.

Could he read minds? How easily he saw through her.

He glanced at her, his expression suggesting her intelligence was concerning. “It’s good to have a brain.”

……

Anna was speechless but didn’t dwell on it. His sharp tongue was nothing new.

During their university days, Adrian was famously sarcastic. No one dared provoke him unless they wanted humiliation and trouble.

Seeing her dazed look, Adrian frowned slightly. She shouldn’t be this slow.

Despite his thoughts, he explained, “You were just near their hotel. You came from there, didn’t you?”

Anna nodded quickly, lamenting her own foolishness. She had been so preoccupied that she hadn’t noticed. Now he would mock her again.

Adrian was pleased with her compliance but couldn’t ignore the worry in her eyes.

“What? He got what he wanted by joining the headquarters. Is he still giving you trouble?”

He suddenly accelerated.

Anna didn’t have time to answer. She gripped the seatbelt tightly, feeling as if she might fly out of her seat.

“Slow down!” She shot him a resentful glare.

Adrian eased off the accelerator.

Too shaken to release her grip, Anna stared straight ahead.

He glanced at her sideways, his tone indifferent. “You haven’t answered me.”

Answer you? Who did he think he was scaring with that sudden acceleration?

Anna glared at him but held back her words. Under his gaze, she simply shook her head. “……This isn’t your concern.”

If he lost what was his, she would be to blame.

The thought made her heart ache, bringing tears to her eyes.

Adrian felt displeased that she still wouldn’t be honest. He stiffened and fell silent.

After a moment of hesitation, Anna spoke softly. “But you should be careful around him at the company from now on.”

Torn between her mother and the person she owed, this was all she could do.

Adrian’s lips curled into a cold smile. So it was about his “wonderful” uncle. It seemed company life was about to get more interesting.
###Chapter 285

"Are you concerned about me?"

"Huh?"

Anna Ross was caught off guard by his question.

She quickly composed herself and replied calmly, "No, you misunderstood."

Adrian Sinclair chuckled softly. "Just asking. Don't take it seriously."

Anna fell silent. The car was unusually quiet, yet she felt restless.

Since their last argument, an indescribable distance had lingered between them.

"What's on your mind?" Adrian leaned back lazily against the seat.

Anna looked ahead. The red light had sixty seconds remaining.

She whispered, "Nothing."

She was still debating whether to reveal Howard Lowell's plan. Her mother's safety was paramount.

But she couldn't bear to hurt Adrian again.

"Still worried about my uncle joining the company?" Adrian glanced at the red light before turning his gaze to her.

Anna felt the air grow thin. She turned to look out the window.

She asked softly, "You're so capable. No one can really harm you, right?"

Adrian paused briefly, a self-mocking smile forming. "Who said that? Haven't you hurt me?"

......

Anna bit her lower lip and lowered her head.

She always carried guilt toward him. No matter how he treated her, she could endure it.

"I..." She looked up, meeting his deep, intense gaze.

Time seemed to freeze. Their eyes locked, burning with the same honesty and passion as before.

Anna was momentarily lost. She watched him lean closer, his handsome face magnifying before her. His warm breath brushed her cheek.

At the critical moment, she noticed the light turn green and hastily pointed ahead. "The light's green!"

She quickly averted her gaze, her heart racing.

That was close...

Adrian gave her a long look before driving through the intersection.

Anna pulled out her phone to distract herself, but found it unusually quiet.

He noticed her small movements. A faint smile touched Adrian's lips.

Anna regretted her decision. She shouldn't have let him pick her up. She put her phone away and turned back to the window.

New York's late autumn remained warm. The streets were crowded with people. She spotted a couple walking by—a girl holding a bouquet, smiling brightly as she clung to her boyfriend's arm.

Anna felt a pang. She had known such happiness once.

Back then, Adrian had used his part-time earnings to buy her first-ever bouquet. The flutter of joy from that moment remained vivid in her memory.

Adrian glanced sideways, catching her profile tinged with melancholy.
###Chapter 286

Adrian Sinclair was about to speak.

Anna Ross suddenly paled.

She quickly turned to block the car window.

Her fingers tightened slightly.

"I'm hungry."

"Let's go back to the company to eat."

She stared intently at him.

Adrian's gaze flickered.

He didn't ask further.

He pressed the accelerator to speed up.

Anna breathed a sigh of relief.

She glanced discreetly at the rearview mirror.

Her frown deepened.

Why were they together?

And acting so intimate.

"What were you looking at just now?"

Adrian's voice suddenly rang out.

Anna's fingers trembled.

She hurriedly changed the subject.

"The restaurant downstairs has new menu items."

"Let me treat you."

Adrian raised an eyebrow at her.

"Not short on money lately?"

Her heart ached.

She was short on money.

Very short.

The car came to a stop.

His assistant quickly came over to take over.

Adrian walked straight toward the restaurant.

"Aren't you going to treat me?"

He looked back at her.

Anna followed him.

She looked at the restaurant sign with dread.

Adrian stopped walking.

The server was about to speak.

He shook his head slightly.

The server understood and remained silent.

He led them to their seats.

Anna reached for the menu.

Adrian took it first.

"I'll order."

He flipped through the menu.

Anna looked down at her phone.

The balance was despairing.

She messaged Mia Lawrence.

There was no reply.

Adrian pushed the menu toward her.

"Do you want to add anything?"

Anna glanced at the prices.

She immediately gave up.

"This is enough."

Her voice sounded weak.

The server looked at Adrian.

He nodded in confirmation.

"It's a bit expensive."

"Are you sure you're okay?"

Adrian's eyes held a hint of amusement.

Anna forced herself to appear calm.

"Of course I'm okay."

The food arrived quickly.

She ate without tasting anything.

After the meal, she stood up to pay.

Adrian stopped her.

"Don't pay."

"Let's go back to the company."

He walked out of the restaurant.

The server bowed respectfully.

Anna stood frozen for a moment.

Then quickly followed him.
###Chapter 287

Adrian Sinclair had just stepped through the company's main entrance.

Noah Watson quickly approached him.

Anna Ross walked to her workstation alone.

Images from earlier kept flashing through her mind.

Julian Garnache and Chloe Valentine appeared in her thoughts, their figures overlapping.

How could they both be there at the same time?

Did they know each other before?

Inside the Light Words Café.

Chloe Valentine stirred her coffee gracefully.

She looked up at the man across from her, a smile curling her lips.

"It's been so many years. You've only grown more charming."

Julian Garnache took a sip of his coffee.

He leaned back lazily in his chair, his gaze indifferent.

"You haven't changed at all."

Chloe's smile froze instantly.

She quickly composed herself, pretending to be casual as she played with her hair.

"I know. I've always been captivating."

Julian chuckled softly but didn't respond.

Chloe set down her cup and leaned forward slightly.

"I remember you saying you would never return to the country."

Her eyes held a probing curiosity.

"Coming back so suddenly... it couldn't be because of me, could it?"

She lifted her chin, a hint of smugness in her tone.

"I told you long ago, it's over between us."

"I hope you can accept reality and stop clinging to the past."

Julian suddenly laughed out loud.

The sound was laced with clear mockery.

He placed his hands on the table, looking directly into her eyes.

"Miss Valentine, you're being rather presumptuous."

"I returned simply because I felt like visiting."

Chloe's expression shifted.

She struggled to maintain her smile.

Julian added calmly.

"If you hadn't insisted on meeting, I wouldn't even be here."

Chloe bit her lip.

She picked up her coffee and took a large gulp.

"That's for the best."

"I'm going to be the future Mrs. Sinclair soon."

"I don't want any unnecessary misunderstandings."

She deliberately adopted a haughty posture.

Hoping to see a look of disappointment on his face.

But Julian remained completely expressionless.

As if he hadn't heard her at all.

"Did you hear what I said?"

Chloe couldn't help pressing him.

Julian finally glanced up.

"I heard. So what?"

Chloe's face turned pale with anger.

She looked out the window to calm herself.

This was nothing like what she had imagined.

He should be burning with jealousy.

Why was he so calm?

Did he really not care anymore?

Chloe turned back, her tone hardening.

"Stay away from us from now on."

"I don't want Adrian to misunderstand."

Julian nodded and stood up.

"If there's nothing else, I'll be going."

Chloe quickly stopped him.

"Wait!"

She hadn't achieved her goal for today.

Julian sat back down.

Quietly waiting for her to continue.

Chloe took a deep breath.

"What is your relationship with Anna Ross?"

Julian's eyes turned cold instantly.

He narrowed his eyes, staring at her.

A dangerous aura radiated from him.

Chloe instinctively shrank back.

She quickly drank more coffee to hide her nervousness.

"Don't even think about targeting her."

"She's just like a little sister to me."

Julian gripped his coffee cup tightly.

His knuckles turned white from the pressure.

Chloe's heart sank heavily.

He had been so cold toward her.

But the moment Anna was mentioned, he became so tense.

The contrast was painfully obvious.
###Chapter 288

Why?

Why did Anna Ross have every man wrapped around her finger?

Chloe Valentine's chest heaved with rage.

Hatred threatened to spill from her eyes.

Julian Garnache knew her too well.

His voice was cold as ice. "If you dare touch her, don't blame me for turning ruthless."

Chloe suddenly burst into laughter.

The sound was sharp and piercing.

Patrons around them turned to look.

She didn't care at all.

"I'm so delicate. How could I ever hurt anyone?"

She lifted her coffee cup and took a small sip.

Her brow immediately furrowed.

This bitter coffee was once her favorite.

Now it was almost impossible to swallow.

She waved for the server.

Ordered a new cup.

Coffee was just like people.

If you didn't like it, you should replace it.

Julian glanced at her.

"You're really that hung up on Adrian Sinclair."

It wasn't a question.

It was a statement.

Chloe's smile remained.

"Yes. Absolutely obsessed."

"If anyone dares to steal him, I'll make their life a living hell."

Their eyes locked in a silent battle.

Neither willing to yield.

Julian's voice was low. "Leave Anna Ross alone."

Chloe's smile turned colder.

"If it's her, I'll only be more ruthless."

The new coffee arrived.

She took a sip.

Closed her eyes in satisfaction.

Replacing it was definitely better.

Julian's knuckles turned white.

"For the sake of our past, let her go."

Chloe acted like she'd heard the biggest joke.

"Are you begging me?"

A sharp pain stabbed her heart.

Why did everyone protect Anna Ross?

That bitch stole everything from her.

Her fiancé.

Her ex-boyfriend.

All revolving around her.

Julian took a deep breath.

"She's kindhearted. She wouldn't steal anyone from you."

Chloe slammed the table and stood up.

"She wouldn't? Hanging around Adrian all day, pretending to be pure!"

"Chloe Valentine!"

Julian's sharp voice cut her off.

His eyes were icy and terrifying.

Chloe was startled.

Then her anger flared even hotter.

She grabbed her purse.

Her voice was shrill. "You think I still care about you? Don't flatter yourself!"

She turned and rushed out of the café.

Leaving behind a room full of whispers.

Julian remained seated.

His brow deeply furrowed.

He would never let Anna Ross get hurt.
###Chapter 289

Mia Lawrence stood outside the coffee shop.

Her gaze was fixed on the man by the window through the glass.

Her steps halted, unable to move further.

Her companion nudged her arm gently. "Mia, what are you staring at?"

The companion followed her line of sight and immediately smiled. "No wonder you turned down everyone at the company who liked you. So this is your type."

Mia curved her lips upward.

She shoved the tour guide flag into her companion's hands. "Jingjing, please take the team to the hotel first. I'll catch up later."

Before the other could respond, she had already turned and rushed toward the coffee shop.

She paused at the entrance, quickly smoothing her dress and hair.

She checked her makeup was perfect before pushing the door open.

Julian Garnache was about to make a call when he noticed someone approaching from the corner of his eye.

He looked up, slightly startled.

"Julian, what a coincidence." Mia feigned surprise, naturally taking the seat opposite him.

Her eyes swept over the other coffee cup on the table. Her heart skipped a beat.

Julian put away his phone and smiled. "Just met a friend. What brings you here?"

Mia stared at the cup with a lipstick stain, her mind wandering. A man as dazzling as him probably never lacked admirers.

"Mia?" Julian waved his hand gently before her eyes.

She snapped back to reality, forcing a smile. "Company team-building. Didn't expect to run into you."

She gestured for the server and ordered a latte.

"I see." Julian had planned to leave but now had to sit back down. He ordered another Americano.

Mia stole glances at his smiling eyes, her heart pounding wildly.

She could almost hear her own heartbeat.

Her gaze was glued to him, unable to look away.

This man, from head to toe, perfectly matched her ideal type, captivating her completely.

Julian noticed her stare and touched his cheek. "Is there something on my face?"

"No." The words burst out of her. "You're just so handsome. I can't help but stare."

Julian raised an eyebrow.

She immediately regretted it. She wanted to maintain a ladylike image, but her true nature slipped out again.

She hurriedly tried to recover. "What I meant was, outstanding people always attract attention..."

She wished she could bite her tongue off. Normally she was carefree, but why did she have to embarrass herself in front of her crush?

"You're adorable." Julian chuckled softly.

Mia froze. The men at the company always said they preferred gentle types. No one had ever called her adorable.

The server arrived with their coffee, interrupting her thoughts.
###Chapter 290

Julian Garnache's words made her ears burn.

Mia Lawrence tried to speak several times.

But swallowed her words silently.

Julian Garnache watched her flushed cheeks.

His eyes twinkled with deeper amusement.

"Anna often mentions you."

"She says you're a wonderful girl."

"It seems she was right."

Mia's head snapped up.

The man was elegantly sipping his coffee.

Her heart leaped with joy.

Anna Ross said she couldn't help.

But she had been putting in a good word for her all along.

"Oh no!"

Mia suddenly exclaimed.

She frantically bent down to search through her handbag.

Julian leaned forward with concern.

"What's wrong?"

She pulled out her phone.

Her fingers quickly swiped the screen.

"Anna sent me a message this morning."

"I was too busy to reply then."

"She must be worried sick!"

A message from her best friend about borrowing money popped up in the chat.

Mia's face instantly changed.

Anna Ross never asked to borrow money.

Something big must have happened.

She immediately dialed the number.

Julian's brow furrowed tightly.

His gaze closely followed her movements.

The call connected quickly.

"Anna! Are you okay?"

"I was too busy to check my phone this morning!"

Mia's voice rose anxiously.

Causing nearby customers to glance over.

Anna Ross paused for a moment.

Then chuckled softly.

"It's fine now."

"I was short on money this morning."

"But it's all sorted."

Mia let out a long sigh of relief.

She casually transferred the money over.

"Really, it's not necessary."

Anna's tone was gentle but firm.

"I'm busy right now."

"Let's talk after work."

The refund notification sound chimed.

Mia shook her head helplessly.

She knew her friend's stubborn nature.

After a few words of advice, she hung up.

"How is Anna?"

Julian immediately pressed.

"She's fine."

Mia smiled brightly.

"Don't worry, Julian."

Julian's tense shoulders finally relaxed.

He had almost thought Chloe Valentine was causing trouble again.

"Mia! Hurry up!"

A colleague rushed into the Starbucks.

"The manager has asked for you three times!"

Mia reluctantly looked across the table.

"Julian, I have to go back."

Julian stood up and nodded.

"Let's talk again next time."

Mia's eyes suddenly lit up.

She took half a step closer and asked,

"A new movie is coming out next week."

"Would you like to see it together, Julian?"

Her colleague's eyes widened.

This girl was never this forward with men.

Julian was slightly taken aback.

Then he smiled.

"I'm always free."

Mia was so happy she nearly jumped.

"It's a date!"

"I'll message you the details!"

Her colleague dragged her away forcefully.

Julian watched her skipping retreating figure.

He couldn't help but chuckle softly.

Such a straightforward and adorable girl.

It had been a long time since he met someone like her.
###Chapter 291

Julian Garnache watched the figure disappear around the street corner.

He took out his phone and dialed a number.

Anna Ross had just finished verifying the final report.

Her phone vibrated on the desk.

She glanced at the caller ID and answered.

"Julian?"

She saved the report and stood up to get water.

Julian Garnache stood outside the Starbucks.

His voice was low. "Anna, be more careful from now on."

"Especially with those around you."

Anna set down her water glass.

"Why bring this up suddenly?"

She walked to the window. "I'm doing fine."

Julian gazed at the traffic.

"Always be cautious."

His tone was grave. "You never know where danger might hide."

Anna was about to speak.

The sound of high heels clicking against the floor echoed from the hallway.

Clear and urgent.

"I have to go."

She ended the call and looked toward the approaching figure.

Chloe Valentine approached in her stilettos.

She lifted her chin. "Where is Adrian?"

Anna averted her gaze.

"He's in a meeting."

Chloe let out a light laugh.

"No lingering trauma from last time, I hope?"

She deliberately lowered her voice. "That man had a prior record."

Anna's fingers tightened.

So that incident was premeditated.

Chloe feigned regret.

"It's my fault for forgetting to warn you."

She took a step closer. "I'm truly sorry."

Anna responded coldly.

"No need for your concern, Miss Valentine."

She turned to leave.

Chloe suddenly noticed a figure in the distance.

She grabbed Anna's wrist and threw herself to the floor.

"Executive Assistant Ross, why did you push me?"

Her voice trembled with fake tears. "I just wanted to apologize..."

Anna stood frozen.

She hadn't even touched her.

Adrian Sinclair approached quickly.

Chloe immediately began sobbing. "Adrian, don't blame Executive Assistant Ross..."

She struggled to stand, pretending to be in great pain.

Several executives emerged from the conference room.

Chloe secretly smiled.

She leaned against Adrian's shoulder.

"It's all my fault..."

Her voice was weak and full of false grievance.
###Chapter 292

The group stopped right in front of them.

They had originally intended to greet Adrian Sinclair.

But seeing something happening here.

They paused to watch.

Anna Ross curled her lip.

"Miss Valentine."

"Don't you think your little self-directed drama."

"Is a bit too childish?"

She had thought Chloe simply disliked her.

Now it seemed.

It was more than just dislike.

Chloe would seize every opportunity to target her in various situations.

But these methods were truly clumsy.

Chloe didn't care about that.

As long as she could make Adrian despise Anna.

She was willing to use any means.

Whispers began among the onlookers.

Someone claimed they had seen Chloe fall to the ground.

Allegedly pushed by this woman named Ross.

The statement shifted the atmosphere.

Their gazes toward Anna instantly changed.

Filled with disgust and contempt.

Chloe felt a secret triumph.

She had only intended to put on a show for Adrian.

The effect was better than expected.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

"I don't blame you."

"You don't need to feel too guilty."

She added a few well-timed words.

Undoubtedly escalating the tension.

Others regarded Anna with even greater scorn.

Anna was furious and wanted to refute.

But her hand was gently held by the person beside her.

She turned to look at Adrian Sinclair.

Was he silently choosing to protect his fiancée?

All eyes were fixed on Adrian.

Chloe was overjoyed.

It seemed her fiancé had good judgment.

He must absolutely detest Anna now.

"Go to the car and get something for me."

"It's in the trunk."

Adrian's voice was soft.

But everyone present heard it clearly.

Anna froze.

He offered no explanation.

Instead, he asked her to fetch something?

Seeing her hesitation.

Adrian urged in a low voice.

"Leave this to me."

"You go first."

Anna nodded.

She had no choice but to turn and leave.

"Hey?"

Chloe不甘心地 tried to stop her.

But Adrian stepped in and held her back instead.

His gaze swept over the murmuring crowd.

His expression darkened.

"Gentlemen."

"Our business discussion is concluded."

"Is there anything else?"

The group immediately fell silent.

Exchanging uneasy glances.

The eldest among them forced a dry laugh.

"Nothing else."

"We just wanted to say goodbye before leaving."

The others quickly nodded in agreement.

Afraid that any delay might bring trouble.

Adrian gave a slight nod.

He called Noah Watson to escort them out.

Their faces paled instantly.

They waved their hands hurriedly.

"No need, no need."

"We can see ourselves out."

"Please don't trouble yourself."

Watching them scurry away.

Adrian slowly turned to the woman beside him.

Chloe bit her lip.

She couldn't bear to let Anna off so easily.

Especially since Adrian had clearly been protecting her.

"Adrian."

"Don't worry."

"I'm fine."

She twisted her fingers.

Putting on a show of grievance but endurance.

Adrian let out a light laugh.

He lifted his chin.

His voice was hoarse as he asked.

"Are you really fine?"
###Chapter 293

Chloe Valentine's fingers trembled slightly.

Her voice softened further. "Adrian, I'm really fine now."

She reached out to touch his sleeve.

Adrian Sinclair sidestepped her touch.

The air grew still.

Cold mockery flickered in his eyes. "I always believed you were kind."

Chloe's heart plummeted.

It felt like something tightly held had suddenly slipped away.

"I... I am, of course." She forced a smile, her voice unsteady.

Had he discovered something?

No, impossible.

Adrian stepped closer, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Chloe had never seen him like this. She retreated in fear.

Her back pressed against the cold wall.

The elevator doors opened.

Anna Ross stepped out holding files.

She looked up and saw Adrian pinning Chloe against the wall.

Her heart skipped a beat.

She turned and hurried down the opposite hallway.

Against the wall, Chloe looked up at his stern face.

Fear slowly turned into shyness.

She hooked his tie, her fingers twisting around the silk.

Her red lips curved slightly. "Adrian, I'll become whatever you like."

"Just look at me, okay?"

Adrian frowned and stepped back.

His tie slipped from her fingers.

He watched her in silence, his eyes distant.

Chloe's nose tingled with unshed tears.

She maintained her smile. "I understand... I'll always be kind."

A kindness only you will see.

"There's no need to come up here unless necessary." He turned and left without looking back.

Chloe's smile shattered.

She grabbed her handbag and slammed it onto the floor.

Her chest heaved violently.

Anna Ross, you deserve to die!

The wind was strong on the rooftop.

Anna rubbed her chilled nose.

Distant buildings blurred into gray-blue shadows.

The scene from earlier replayed in her mind.

She gave a wry smile.

Just because he doesn't want to marry now doesn't mean never.

Love can grow over time. It's not impossible.

"Executive Assistant Ross?"

Noah Watson approached holding a can of soda.

He smiled and shook it gently. "Rare to find someone else who likes this spot."

He leaned against the railing and handed her an iced coffee.

They stood side by side, gazing at the city skyline.

"I found it by chance," Anna said softly. "The view is good here. It's quiet."

Noah glanced at her. "Feeling down?"

Before she could answer, he smiled again. "I come here to clear my head when I'm tired. The wind blows all worries away."

Anna looked down, tracing the cold surface of the can.

"Yes," she whispered. "Some words... are only for the wind to hear."
###Chapter 294

Noah Watson’s eyes flickered with surprise.
“If something’s troubling you, Anna, you can tell me.”
“It might be presumptuous to say this, but after working together for so long, I consider you a true friend.”

Anna Ross didn’t know how to respond.
She offered a faint smile.
“Thank you.”

Her gaze drifted to the restaurant downstairs.
Remembering the morning’s events, she asked casually, “Have you ever been to that restaurant downstairs, Noah?”

Noah glanced down and shook his head with a smile.
“No. It’s part of Sinclair Group’s holdings.”
“I usually eat at the employee cafeteria.”

Anna froze for a moment.
No wonder she hadn’t needed to pay during breakfast—it was his family’s business.

“Do you want to eat there, Anna?” Noah’s tone held genuine surprise.

She quickly waved her hand.
“Just curious.”
Checking the time, she stood up.
“It’s getting late. I should return to my desk.”

Noah nodded and bid her farewell.

When she returned to her workstation, Chloe Valentine was gone.
But that tall, imposing figure remained standing nearby.

Recalling their earlier confrontation, Anna approached with an expressionless face.
She handed him the documents, her voice cool.
“What you asked for.”

Adrian Sinclair raised an eyebrow, amused by her sharp tone.
“Are you upset that I didn’t defend you earlier?” He stepped closer, his shadow enveloping her.

Anna retreated half a step, her face tense.
“Why would I be upset? She’s your fiancée. It’s natural for you to believe her.”
She shoved the documents into his arms and deftly returned to her seat.
“If there’s nothing else, Mr. Sinclair, I need to work.”

Adrian stood silently, not leaving.
He hadn’t misheard—was she actually jealous?

“I knew it wasn’t your fault earlier.” His voice came from beside her, calm yet startling.

She had just regained her composure, but his words shook her again.

Adrian watched her slender back, his gaze deepening.
Seeing her fragile shoulders, a sudden ache pierced his heart.

Before Anna could speak, Adrian moved in front of her.
His expression softened.
“Don’t dwell on it…”
“What I mean is, don’t let someone like that upset you.”
His eyes flickered as he held back further concern.

Anna stared at him in stunned silence.
She was surprised by his trust, and even more by his concern.
He should… hate her.

“Mr. Sinclair, here’s the quarterly report you requested.”
Noah’s voice interrupted abruptly.
Anna snapped back to reality and lowered her head quickly.
“Understood. I’ll get back to work.”

Adrian glanced at Noah and led him into the office.
Before turning away, he gave her a deep, lingering look.

Howard Lowell would be arriving at the company soon.
When that time came, he would uncover—exactly what she was hiding.
###Chapter 295

Anna Ross's fingers hovered over the keyboard, her thoughts already drifting far away.

They had met again after breaking up.
He hated her to the bone.
He kept her by his side, tormenting her with every means possible.
She could endure all of that.
But why did he occasionally show tenderness?

Her heart was in turmoil.

Finally, the workday ended. Anna headed straight to the bar.

The owner greeted her warmly as soon as she saw her.
The two were now close. The owner pulled her aside, chatting incessantly.
Anna maintained a polite smile throughout.

Every word from the owner was filled with gratitude and praise.
Since Anna started performing, the bar's business had been booming.
Now, it was packed every night.

"Look at all these new customers. They all say they came specifically to hear you sing." The owner's cheeks flushed with excitement.

Anna smiled faintly, putting away her belongings. "I'll sing well."

She was equally grateful to the owner.
If not for the opportunity given to her, she wouldn't be able to sing on stage.
Let alone receive such generous pay.

Tonight's crowd was especially enthusiastic.
Many sang along throughout the entire performance, creating a lively atmosphere.

The joyous mood dispelled the gloom in her heart.
Stepping off the stage, she felt much lighter.

"Anna."

A strong smell of alcohol hit her.
Anna turned and met Lucas Evans's dazed eyes. "Lucas?"

Lucas stared at her with a foolish smile, completely drunk.
He laughed for a moment, then raised a bottle to drink again.

"Stop drinking!" Anna quickly snatched the bottle away, raising her voice to try and sober him up.

The music from the dance floor was deafening.
She wasn't sure if he could hear her.

Her wrist was suddenly grabbed with force.
Anna winced in pain.

Before she could react, she was pulled toward a sofa.
Lucas patted the spot beside him groggily. "Anna, sit here."

The pungent smell of alcohol made her uncomfortable.
Anna sat down as asked. "Why are you drinking so much? Did you come alone?"

The Lucas she remembered was always gentle and refined, rarely so disheveled.

Lucas had somehow gotten another bottle. He squinted, looking around. "Just me."

He tilted his head back and drank again.

Anna tried to stop him, but he dodged her.
He leaned back on the sofa drunkenly, mumbling, "Anna, I've been waiting for you. You look so beautiful when you sing."

He had been waiting here all along?

Anna was stunned.
How long had he been here?

Lucas turned to gaze at her, suddenly laughing to himself.
Still laughing, he leaned closer, his tone almost pleading. "Don't avoid me, okay?"

"Lucas..." Only now did Anna see the bloodshot veins in his eyes.
It was shocking.
She hesitated, wanting to speak.

"Shh." Lucas pressed his index finger to his lips, shaking his head gently. "Don't speak. Listen to me. I have so much to tell you."

Watching him drink incessantly, Anna felt a pang of sorrow.
She couldn't bear to watch, but there was nothing she could do.

Soon, the bottle was empty.
Lucas frowned, shaking the empty bottle, then waved for a server.
Another bottle was brought to the table.
###Chapter 296

"Anna, why won't you even look at me?"

He tilted his head back, gulping down the strong liquor, his entire body sinking deep into the sofa.

From their university days until now, his feelings for her had never been any less than Adrian Sinclair's. He thought he would finally get his chance, yet she remained completely blind to his existence.

"Lucas, you're drunk." Anna Ross stood up, reaching to take the bottle from his hand.

Lucas suddenly grabbed her wrist, pulling her with force. The world spun. In the next moment, she was pinned firmly beneath him.

Anna's pupils contracted sharply. She struggled fiercely. "Lucas, what are you doing?!"

It was as if he couldn't hear her. His fingers gently lifted her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. This close—he had only ever dared to dream of such proximity.

Anna's entire body went rigid. Her eyes were filled with terror, yet she couldn't move.

"Anna, that day at the hotel... I was going to confess to you. But you ran away." His voice was soft as he gently brushed a strand of hair from her face, his eyelashes lowered.

Anna closed her eyes, turning her head away from his touch.

Lucas paused. He buried his face in the crook of her neck, his voice muffled. "Anna, I've liked you since university. Can't you give me one chance?"

Anna's mind went blank. Suddenly, the image of Adrian Sinclair flashed before her eyes.

She shook her head hard, trying to dispel that man's outline.

"Lucas, I—" Her words were cut short as his weight suddenly grew heavier against her. The sound of even breathing reached her ears. She pushed at the person on top of her. He was already fast asleep.

She managed to wriggle out from under Lucas. Gazing at the man sleeping soundly on the sofa, she whispered softly, "I'm sorry."

She didn't want to like anyone anymore. She certainly didn't deserve to be liked by anyone else. He deserved a better girl.

Now came the difficult part. She didn't know any of Lucas's friends. She didn't know anyone around here either. How was she supposed to get him home?

Anna thought for a moment. She reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his phone. She tried to turn it on, but it required a passcode.

She was silent for a long while. She tried to rouse the man on the sofa. She called his name several times. Lucas showed no reaction.

Anna sighed in frustration. She continued trying to unlock the phone. Cracking someone else's phone felt nearly impossible.

"Excuse me, are you Miss Ross?"

Anna looked up. A slightly plump man stood before her, smiling. "I'm here to take the young master home." The man gestured toward the person on the sofa.

Understanding dawned on Anna. She quickly handed over the phone and stepped aside.

The man helped Lucas to his feet, bid her farewell, and left.

Watching their retreating figures, Anna finally let out a long, deep breath.

The bar owner, Pamela, finally approached. She placed a hand on Anna's shoulder. "Anna, that young man is quite nice. He came here because he's pursuing you, right?"

It seemed things hadn't gone very well. Pamela blinked. "I think you should consider giving him a chance. These days, finding someone who genuinely likes you is truly rare."

Anna smiled bitterly and shook her head. After a moment of silence, she said quietly, "Pamela, I don't like him. I can't lead him on."

Besides, even though she and Adrian were separated now, she still wasn't ready to accept anyone new.
###Chapter 297

Anna arrived home to find Sophia already fast asleep.

The entire city had fallen into silence.

Her gaze landed on the table.

Several finance books were scattered in a messy pile.

She picked one up casually.

The pages showed clear signs of being read.

A slight smile touched her lips.

She never expected the usually lively and playful Sophia.

To be interested in something as dry as finance.

She carefully organized the books.

After washing up, she slipped into bed.

Sleep came quickly.

She slept peacefully through the night.

The next morning.

Anna had just reached the company entrance.

She saw Howard waiting there.

He was clearly there specifically for her.

Howard offered a fake smile the moment he saw her.

He quickly stepped forward and pulled her aside.

He glanced around.

Lowering his voice, he said, "Remember what I told you."

"Just cooperate nicely with me."

"I won't treat you and your mother badly."

Anna's stomach churned with disgust.

For his own selfish gains.

He wanted her to hurt someone else.

Colleagues began passing by.

Anna didn't want to engage.

She was about to give a response.

When she suddenly felt someone approach from behind.

She turned around.

Adrian stood there silently.

His expression was calm and unreadable.

Howard's face instantly darkened.

He cursed inwardly.

His conversation was interrupted before he could finish.

But he was new here.

It wasn't appropriate to make a scene.

He forced a smile and stepped around Anna.

Greeting Adrian, "Adrian."

"Didn't expect to run into you so soon."

"Working together from now on."

"Truly a pleasure."

Adrian's lips curved slightly.

His voice was light. "My little cousin talks about it every day."

"Saying she wanted her uncle to come to headquarters."

"She's probably the happiest one right now."

His gaze settled on Anna.

Holding an elusive depth.

Anna was taken aback.

She nodded awkwardly.

Unsure of what to say.

The moment their eyes met.

She quickly looked away.

She couldn't decipher his intention.

Was he暗示 her.

Or saying it for Howard's benefit.

Howard felt a secret thrill.

His plan seemed to be working.

As long as Anna could secure Adrian.

The Sinclair Group would eventually be his.

Noah approached quickly at that moment.

Handing documents to Adrian.

Adrian glanced through them before passing them to Howard.

"These are your position arrangements."

"Take a careful look, Uncle."

"I must excuse myself now."

Howard eagerly took the documents.

His eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Adrian gave him a cold glance.

Turning to the distracted girl beside him.

"Time for work."

Anna snapped back to reality.

Ignoring Howard any further.

She followed the two into the company.

As an executive assistant.

Following her superior was only natural.

After the three left.

Howard hummed a tune as he opened the documents.

His anticipation instantly turned to disappointment.

He nearly cursed out loud.

The legitimate heir of the Lowell family.

Was only a mere team leader!?
###Chapter 298

Howard Lowell spat on the ground with venom.

He directed all his hatred toward Adrian Sinclair.

If not for this outsider meddling, he should be the one in control of the Lowell empire now.

He looked up at the towering corporate skyscraper.

A cold smile twisted his lips.

Soon, all of this would fall into his grasp.

The company was buzzing with rumors.

Everyone was talking about the chairman's only son taking a sudden position.

Chloe Valentine heard the news.

She had never met Howard Lowell.

But since he was Lowell blood, winning his support could secure her marriage to Adrian Sinclair.

......

Anna Ross had just returned to her desk after delivering documents.

Before she could sit down, Howard called.

After hanging up, she leaned against her desk, frowning.

He just joined the company and already demanded a meeting.

Was he making his move so soon?

She hesitated for a long time, remaining seated.

Another call came, urging her to come.

Anna had no choice but to go.

Howard slammed a stack of files in front of her.

He was so angry he could barely speak.

"What is he thinking? Assigning me some petty little role like this!"

Anna stepped back, startled by his rage.

She opened the file and saw the words "Team Leader."

Now she understood his fury.

It seemed Adrian had taken precautions.

"Perhaps this was Grandpa's decision?" She glanced at the file and placed it back on the desk.

Howard was leaning painfully against the window frame.

Her words made him pause.

He muttered to himself, "Right. Why didn't I think of that?"

Since the branch company incident, the old man's trust in him had plummeted.

Even though he was allowed into headquarters, a high position was unlikely.

Anna continued, "I've been watching Adrian. He had no time to interfere with these arrangements."

She wasn't sure of the truth.

But at least Howard's threat to Adrian was temporarily reduced.

Howard straightened up.

He stared out the window, lost in thought.

Suddenly, he smirked.

"You're right. In that case, I'll endure it for now."

The Lowell empire would belong to him eventually.

Anna didn't want to stay any longer.

She turned to leave.

Howard quickly blocked her path.

He grinned triumphantly.

"You did well this time. Keep a close eye on him."

"Don't let him marry Miss Valentine."

"Remember, it's best if he becomes completely devoted to you."

He grew more excited, as if his grand plans were within reach.

Anna suppressed her disgust.

She didn't respond and walked away.

After work, she went to her usual job at the bar.

Business had been exceptionally busy lately.

Her popularity had soared, gaining a large fan base.

Some even affectionately called her "Diva."

Anna gradually realized that only on stage could she forget all her troubles.

This job brought her more joy than she expected.

"Anna, can you work overtime tonight?"

Just as she was about to leave, the owner stopped her with an apologetic look.

"An important client came specifically to hear you sing."

"Could you perform two more songs?"
###Chapter 299

Anna Ross looked toward the noisy booth area and gave a slight nod.

Going home meant being alone anyway. Might as well sing a few more songs and earn some extra money.

The final song ended. The bar owner, beaming, grabbed her arm. He shoved a thick stack of cash into her palm. "That VIP guest praised your singing. He specifically requested you next time. This is an extra tip."

Anna clutched the heavy wad of cash. Her fingertips trembled slightly. This amount equaled several days of her regular pay.

She packed her bag and hurried out of the bar. The night was deep. She had work tomorrow and couldn't afford to be late.

Fortunately, her apartment wasn't far.

The street was deserted. Streetlights stretched her lonely shadow.

Anna looked down at her phone. A cold raindrop hit the screen without warning. Then, the downpour began.

She frantically protected her phone and sprinted toward her apartment building. She should have checked the weather forecast.

The rain completely soaked her thin jacket. The night wind blew, chilling her to the bone.

The apartment door was slightly ajar. She pushed it open.

"Sis! You're drenched!" Sophia Roscente dropped her book and rushed over. She spotted the umbrella by the entrance and stamped her foot in frustration.

"It started raining suddenly. I didn't have an umbrella." Anna's voice was nasal. She sneezed twice in quick succession.

Sophia grabbed a towel and wrapped it around her. "Why didn't you call me to bring an umbrella? What if you catch a cold?"

Before she finished, Anna sneezed again.

Sophia immediately pushed her toward the bathroom. "Take a hot shower, now! I'll find the cold medicine!"

Anna didn't dare delay. She quickly showered in hot water.

She slept restlessly that night. Her head felt heavy. Her entire body was cold.

Anna tried to open her eyes. Her eyelids were too heavy to lift.

"Sis? Are you still asleep?"

Through the haze, she heard persistent knocking. She wanted to answer, but no sound came out.

Sophia got no response. She saw the shoes by the door and her heart clenched. She pushed the door open.

The figure on the bed was curled up, face flushed. Sophia called her name twice.

Anna forced her eyes open. The sunlight made her dizzy.

"Sophia... what time is it?" Her voice was terribly hoarse. The taste of blood lingered in her throat.

Sophia touched her forehead and jerked her hand back in shock. "You're burning up!"

It had to be a fever from getting caught in the rain last night.

Anna struggled to sit up. There was an important meeting today. She absolutely could not miss it.

"Sophia, I'm fine..." She just stood up when everything went black. She collapsed heavily to the floor.

"Sis!"
###Chapter 300

Anna Ross's cheeks were flushed with an unnatural fever.

Her breathing grew rapid and shallow.

Sophia Roscente frantically scrolled through her phone contacts.

She thought of someone who could help.

The call was disconnected immediately after dialing.

Sophia stamped her foot in frustration.

She quickly typed out a text message and sent it.

Her phone vibrated instantly.

The person called back.

Sophia pursed her lips.

He hadn't answered her call earlier.

Now he was in a hurry.

Adrian Sinclair's voice was laced with urgency.

"What's wrong with her?"

The sound of an engine starting came through the receiver.

Sophia looked down at the person in her arms.

"Hurry, something's wrong with Anna," she urged.

The call ended.

Sophia fetched a damp towel and placed it on Anna's forehead.

The doorbell rang suddenly.

Sophia had just opened the door.

A figure brushed past her swiftly.

Anna was already scooped up into his arms.

The entire sequence happened with startling speed.

Sophia stood frozen for a moment.

Then a relieved smile touched her lips.

It seemed her cousin truly cared about her.

Adrian carried her quickly to his car.

He pressed a hand to her forehead.

The heat was alarming.

Anna murmured something in her delirium.

Adrian leaned closer to listen.

"Sorry..."

His brow furrowed with concern.

He drove straight to the hospital.

Anna's eyes fluttered open.

The first thing she saw was Adrian's back.

She was fully awake in an instant.

She tried to sit up but tugged on the IV line.

A sharp pain shot through the back of her hand.

She winced involuntarily.

Adrian turned at the sound.

He saw she was awake.

"Does it hurt?"

He arranged the takeout containers.

He handed her a fork and knife.

"How are you here?" Anna asked softly.

"Sophia told me you fainted."

She accepted the utensils.

She began eating quietly.

Adrian watched her in silence.

His tone held a note of reproach.

"You can't even take care of yourself properly."

Anna's cheeks flushed pink.

She focused on her meal without looking up.

The hospital room door opened.

Sophia and Marcus Hill entered together.

Seeing Adrian, Sophia immediately dropped Marcus's arm.

She hurried to the bedside.

She pressed a hand to Anna's forehead.

She breathed a sigh of relief.

"Are you feeling better, Anna?"

"Your forehead was so hot this morning."

Anna smiled weakly.

She hadn't expected to get so sick from getting caught in the rain.

Marcus walked over to Adrian.

He slung an arm over his friend's shoulder teasingly.

"Rare to see you skipping work hours."

"Seems someone is quite special."
###Chapter 301

Anna Ross’s hand paused slightly as she held her fork and knife.

Three pairs of eyes landed on her simultaneously.

Sophia Roscente secretly gave Marcus Hill a thumbs-up.

He truly was her cousin’s best friend.

He actually dared to say such things.

Adrian Sinclair remained silent.

The air instantly grew still.

Anna’s cheeks flushed with heat.

It was clearly just a joke.

Yet she couldn't help but anticipate his answer.

After a long while.

Adrian finally shifted his gaze.

His eyes settled on Marcus’s face.

“Keep talking nonsense.”

“And I won’t hesitate to interfere with you and Sophia.”

Marcus immediately raised his hands in surrender.

“Don’t!”

“Sophia and I are serious.”

“You promised not to interfere with us.”

Sophia grew anxious too.

“Cousin, you can’t go back on your word!”

She was thoroughly enjoying this relationship.

If it got ruined.

She would definitely never let him hear the end of it!

The two of them closed in on him from both sides.

The noise gave Adrian a headache.

“Quiet!”

The room fell silent instantly.

Adrian looked at Anna.

He spoke softly.

“Eat first.”

Anna lowered her head and continued eating.

He really didn’t care about her.

She pretended nothing was wrong on the surface.

But her heart ached with bitterness.

Anna Ross.

What were you still hoping for?

She put down the food container.

And leaned back against the headboard.

Marcus pulled Sophia aside.

He lowered his voice.

“Adrian is just being stubborn.”

“I figured it out a long time ago.”

Sophia whispered in agreement.

“This morning, I just mentioned that Anna fainted.”

“He rushed over immediately.”

They exchanged a knowing smile.

Adrian shot them a cold glance.

They immediately fell silent.

Sophia sat on the other side of the hospital bed.

Facing Adrian.

She hesitated for a moment.

Then spoke softly.

“Cousin.”

“There’s something I want to discuss with you.”

Adrian didn’t speak.

Which she took as silent permission.

Sophia felt a little nervous.

She glanced at Marcus.

Receiving an encouraging look.

She mustered her courage.

“I want to study at Stanford University.”

Her voice grew quieter.

Almost inaudible.

Anna silently repeated the name.

Stanford was located in this city.

Its Finance program was top-tier.

Countless people fought desperately to get in.

A true Ivy League school.

Ordinary people simply couldn’t afford it.

Adrian refused coldly.

“No.”

“You know Aunt won’t agree to you studying Finance.”

Sophia’s face fell instantly.

“I’ve grown up now.”

“I have the right to choose what I love.”

Since childhood.

She had always been obedient.

Doing whatever her family told her to.

Even studying abroad was forced upon her.

Now that she had finally returned.

She still couldn’t pursue the life she wanted.

What was the point of living then?

Marcus looked at her with concern.

The young woman had finally mustered her courage.

He hoped this wouldn’t crush it completely.
###Chapter 302

But the truth was, he had overthought it.

Sophia Roscente had already thrown herself into Anna Ross's arms.

She sobbed pitifully. "Sis, you tell me."

"How can my cousin be so domineering?"

"He won't let me study what I love!"

Anna staggered back slightly from the impact.

Though accustomed to her energy, it was still a bit overwhelming.

Adrian Sinclair's expression was stern.

He stated firmly, "It's no use saying anything."

"I won't agree."

Sophia cried even louder.

She shook Anna's arm. "Sis, please say something for me."

Marcus Hill also looked over with a pleading gaze.

Anna felt worn down.

She reluctantly spoke up. "Can't you make an exception?"

Adrian hadn't expected her to intervene.

He stared at her, momentarily stunned.

Anna pressed on, steeling herself. "Sophia has been reading finance books constantly."

"She genuinely loves finance."

"Since it's her dream, you shouldn't stand in her way."

Her voice softened. "I once had something I loved deeply too."

"But I never got the chance to pursue it."

Some opportunities are simply beyond reach.

So when the chance arises, one should chase their dreams.

Don't let life be filled with regrets.

Adrian felt a pang in his heart.

He remembered her abandoned singing dream.

Sophia saw the opening.

She clung to Anna, wailing. "Waaah, we're so pitiful…"

Adrian rubbed his temples.

He said gravely, "I can agree to you studying finance."

"But you have to tell Mother yourself."

Why had he agreed?

Seeing her distressed expression, he actually felt reluctant.

Sophia immediately looked at Anna with admiration.

In that moment, Anna was her savior.

Anna avoided her intense gaze.

She hadn't expected Adrian to actually agree.

Sophia walked over to Adrian.

She gave him a light hug. "Cousin, thank you."

"I know you mean well."

"But I've grown up. I want to pursue my own goals."

She glanced at the person on the bed, then at those around her.

She smiled. "Besides, I have so many people who love and care for me."

It was the first time she had spoken to him so seriously.

As if she had matured overnight.

Marcus ruffled her hair.

He pulled her into his embrace.

He said to Adrian solemnly, "Don't worry, I'm here too."

His family background might not match the Lowell's prominence.

But what he could offer the girl he loved would be no less than what the Lowell family could provide.

Children's playful laughter drifted in from outside the window.

The joyful sounds floated into the room.

Adrian suddenly felt a sense of relief.

His beloved little cousin had grown up.

She had become sensible and independent.

Forget it. Some people and things couldn't be controlled forever.

Let her be.
###Chapter 303

Sophia Roscente felt a surge of happiness unlike any she had ever known.

She silently vowed to hold onto this hard-won warmth.

Buzz buzz buzz—

Her phone's vibration shattered the cozy atmosphere.

Sophia frantically searched through her handbag.

It was a call from her mother.

She gasped suddenly. "Oh no! Mom asked me to come home and keep her company today. I completely forgot!"

She hurriedly grabbed Marcus Hill's hand. "We have to go, now."

The door closed softly behind them.

The room fell into a silence broken only by the sound of their breathing.

Anna Ross averted her gaze, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt.

Silence stretched between them.

She finally spoke in a soft voice. "Don't you need to return to the office?"

Adrian Sinclair stood by the window.

Sunlight cast his tall, straight silhouette onto the floor.

"I'll leave once I know you're home safely." His voice was calm and even.

Anna looked up at him.

Three years had polished him into a more mature and steady man.

The boy he once was had long since transformed into a compelling man.

His features were still handsome, but now carried a deeper intensity.

After the IV drip finished, Adrian insisted on driving her home.

The moment the car stopped, his phone rang urgently.

There was an emergency at the company requiring his immediate attention.

He frowned, ending the call. "I have to go."

Anna stood outside her building, watching the car disappear.

She watched until the black sedan vanished around the corner.

It wasn't that no one had shown interest in her these past three years.

But her heart had already been claimed by that one person.

There was simply no room for anyone else.

Back in her apartment, she saw a message from the bar owner.

The bar was closed for the night.

She put her phone down and walked into the bedroom.

From the very bottom of a pile of books, she pulled out a photo album.

The cover read, "As Wished By The Mountains And Rivers."

Her fingertips gently traced the gold-embossed letters.

The album was filled with sweet memories.

Every photo captured a moment of past happiness.

Now, only she remained to cherish them.

Tears blurred her vision.

She wiped them away hurriedly, but they only fell faster.

She had never dared to open this album after their breakup.

She was terrified of completely falling apart.

Her phone rang suddenly.

She took a deep breath and answered.

"Anna, can you have dinner with me tonight?" Mia Lawrence's voice was full of anticipation.

Anna tried to keep her voice steady. "Actually, I have the night off."

But her choked voice betrayed her.

Mia noticed immediately. "Have you been crying?"

The sound of rustling papers came through the phone.

Anna explained softly. "It's just a bit of a cold."

Mia became instantly concerned. "You're sick? Why didn't you tell me? I'm coming over right now!"

"Don't," Anna said quickly. "I already went to the hospital."

She thought of her friend's strict attendance policy after her promotion.

Mia was skeptical. "Who went with you to the hospital?"

Anna lowered her eyes, her voice almost a whisper.

"Adrian Sinclair."
###Chapter 304

Mia Lawrence froze in place.

This was completely unexpected.

She often saw Adrian Sinclair around Anna Ross.

But she never expected him to be so helpful.

After a moment of silence.

She hesitated before speaking. "Anna, does Adrian still like you?"

Anna quickly shook her head.

Her voice rose a few pitches. "No, nothing like that. Don't make wild guesses!"

Mia raised an eyebrow.

She knew her best friend's mind all too well.

The more she explained, the more it proved there was an issue.

"Alright, alright. As long as you're fine."

"We'll talk in detail tonight."

Anna agreed.

After the other party hung up.

She put away the photo album.

She lay on the bed, intending to take a short nap.

Evening.

The two met at the restaurant.

As soon as they met, Mia pulled her over excitedly. "I have good news!"

"Julian agreed to go see a movie with me!"

Anna could feel her overflowing joy.

She couldn't help but smile. "That's great."

"You must seize this opportunity."

Mia pulled out a chair for her.

She said with a grin, "Of course."

"That's exactly why I asked you out!"

"Huh?"

Anna was confused.

How could going out with her help?

Mia leaned closer.

Her face was full of longing for the future. "To make a plan, of course."

"You know I've never pursued anyone before."

"This is my first time."

"It's hard not to be nervous."

Anna couldn't help but laugh. "That's true."

"It's always been others chasing you."

Mia had a cheerful personality.

She was exceptionally good-looking.

She'd never lacked suitors since her student days.

But she never liked any of them.

It seemed she truly liked Julian Garnache.

The waiter served the food.

Both of them ignored the meal.

They focused on talking.

Mia took out a notepad and urged, "Tell me quickly."

"What does Julian usually like to do?"

"I'll write it down now."

"So I can cater to his preferences later."

Anna frowned slightly.

This stumped her.

She thought for a long while before speaking. "I'm not too sure about that."

"But I know he likes mixing drinks."

"And he especially loves playing the piano."

Mia wrote it down one by one.

Though it was just two simple sentences.

There was a lot she needed to prepare later!

"Sorry, Mia."

"I know too little."

Anna felt somewhat guilty.

"Should I help you ask?"

"No!"

Mia put away her phone.

She said happily, "It would be too obvious if you asked."

"What if he notices?"

As she spoke.

She handed the utensils to Anna.

The two prepared to eat.

This information alone was precious to her.

She never knew the person she liked could play the piano.

It made her even more infatuated!

Anna looked at her best friend's joyful expression.

She couldn't help but tease, "If it weren't for Julian."

"You probably wouldn't have asked me out, right!"

"You really abandon your friends for love."

Mia immediately piled a lot of food onto her plate.

She stated her feelings, "You can't say that."

"In my heart."

"No matter how much I like him, he can only be second."

"You will always be first."

Anna felt warm inside.

Good friends were truly the spice of life.

"Eat up."

"This restaurant tastes great."

Mia pushed the dishes she found delicious in front of her.

Anna happily took a bite.

She just looked up, wanting to praise the taste.

But she saw Julian walking in with a girl.
###Chapter 305

"Anna, what are you staring at over there?"

Mia Lawrence followed her gaze.

Anna Ross tried to stop her, but it was too late.

The smile slowly faded from Mia's face, replaced by shock and bitterness.

"Mia..." Anna opened her mouth, but words failed her.

Mia watched quietly for a moment before looking away, her eyes fixed on the table.

After a few seconds of silence, she forced a dry smile. "It's fine. Liking him is my own business. He's free to have dinner with anyone."

But her heart ached as if squeezed tightly.

Watching him pull out a chair for that girl with gentle care, sharing soft laughter, made her breath tremble.

Anna frowned as she looked toward their table.

The girl had an innocent appearance with bright, sparkling eyes, smiling up at Julian Garnache.

Mia buried herself in her food, eating quickly as if to suppress her emotions.

"Don't do this, Mia." Anna couldn't bear to watch and stood up to intervene.

Mia grabbed her arm, snatched her bag, and hurried outside.

They ran straight into Julian as he stood up.

"Anna? Mia? You're here too?"

His voice remained gentle, his smile unchanged.

Normally, this would make Mia's heart race.

But now she just turned away without a word.

Julian noticed something was wrong. "What's the matter? Did something happen?"

Before Anna could speak, Mia cut in. "It's nothing. We're done eating. We're leaving."

She lacked the courage to look back, pulling Anna away quickly.

Julian watched their hurried departure, his gaze deepening.

Mia fought back tears as she called a ride.

Since meeting him, she had always been the one to initiate contact.

He would reply, but never reached out first.

Yet every message from him still made her day.

Anna was worried. "I'll stay with you tonight."

Mia shook her head. "Anna, I want a drink. I called your ride. You should go home."

"I'm not leaving you alone." Anna held her tightly.

Mia managed a smile and patted her hand. "Don't worry. I'll just have two drinks and go home myself."

Anna watched the traffic, her heart heavy.

Mia was alone in New York with no one else to rely on but her.

She couldn't leave her at a time like this.

She gripped Mia's hand firmly. "I'll drink with you."

Mia paused for a moment before hugging her tightly.

At least she still had her.

The car stopped in front of a bar.

The driver gave them a slightly disdainful look.

They ignored him and walked straight inside.

Mia ordered a bunch of drinks and settled into a booth, downing them quickly.

"Anna, take me home when I'm drunk."

Anna nodded, watching her drink one bottle after another.
###Chapter 306

The bitterness of a one-sided crush is a lonely burden.

If love isn't a mutual journey, it's best to guard your heart.

She unconsciously picked up her glass and took a sip.

The harsh liquid burned her throat, making her wince.

"Two lovely ladies drinking alone is no fun. Let us keep you company?"

Several men with sleazy grins approached.

They crowded onto the sofa without invitation, their eyes roaming over the two women.

Anna Ross shifted away, pressing closer to Mia Lawrence in the corner.

Seeing them retreat, the men laughed more boldly.

"Don't shy away. We'll make sure you get home safe when you're drunk."

One man took the opportunity to reach out and stroke Anna's cheek.

Mia's eyes turned icy.

In a flash, she grabbed a bottle and smashed it over his head.

"Don't you dare touch her."

She spat the words with contempt, grabbing Anna's hand and bolting for the exit.

The struck man clutched his bleeding forehead, roaring with rage.

"After them! Don't let them get away!"

He cursed violently as his companions gave chase.

Anna glanced back as they ran, her heart sinking at the sight of the pursuing crowd.

Escape seemed unlikely tonight.

Mia desperately waved at passing cars, but none stopped.

Noticing a dark alley, Anna pulled her friend into its shadows.

Their pursuers arrived, furious at losing sight of them.

One kicked a nearby tree in frustration.

Anna's heart hammered against her ribs as she peered out from the alley.

"Search the area! They can't have gone far!"

The bleeding man caught up, scanning the surroundings with a vicious glare.

"Check every alley. I want them found!"

His lackeys fanned out to search.

A chill ran down Anna's spine.

She picked up a loose stone, ready to fight.

Footsteps drew closer, each one syncing with her frantic heartbeat.

Mia shielded Anna, her gaze fixed on the alley's entrance.

A figure suddenly appeared before them.

After a stunned moment, he laughed triumphantly.

"Over here! I found them!"

Anna looked behind them. There was no escape.

"Run! Why aren't you running?" The men advanced to grab them. Anna tightened her grip on the stone.

"What's going on here?" A cold, sharp voice cut through the tension.

Anna looked up. Her heart stopped.

Lucas Evans held up his phone, waving it at the thugs.

"I've already called the police. Leave now unless you want a trip to the station."

The men paled. Their shady records made them fear the law.

"You'll pay for this!"

They spat the threat before retreating, defeated.
###Chapter 307

Anna Ross gently brushed the dust off her clothes.

Lucas Evans reached out to steady her.

She avoided his hand.

She leaned against the wall to regain her balance.

Then she helped Mia Lawrence up.

Lucas's hand hung in the air.

He slowly withdrew it.

The driver who had followed them frowned deeply.

The driver remembered what had just happened.

Lucas had rushed over without regard for his own safety.

Yet she responded with cold indifference.

The driver's eyes darkened.

Anna didn't notice.

She thanked Lucas.

Then she turned to leave.

Lucas quickly caught up.

"Anna, let me drive you both home."

His voice held a pleading tone.

Anna paused for a moment.

"That won't be necessary."

Her voice was soft.

But distant.

Mia suddenly gave her a push.

"My head is spinning."

She blinked at Lucas.

"We could really use a ride."

Lucas immediately told the driver to bring the car around.

The driver reluctantly complied.

Anna shot her friend an exasperated look.

Mia stuck out her tongue.

She pulled Anna firmly toward the car.

Silence filled the vehicle.

Only Mia's breathing could be heard.

Lucas watched Anna through the rearview mirror.

She happened to look up at that moment.

They both averted their eyes simultaneously.

Lucas broke the silence.

"That time at the bar..."

He hesitated slightly.

"I had too much to drink. I didn't say anything inappropriate, did I?"

Anna's expression remained calm.

"You fell asleep as soon as you saw me."

She brushed it off lightly.

Lucas smiled.

His gaze returned to the road ahead.

The driver tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

His expression grew increasingly displeased.

The car stopped outside their apartment building.

Lucas watched them leave.

His eyes were gentle.

The driver finally couldn't hold back.

"Young master, is she really worth it?"

His voice held confusion.

Lucas simply smiled.

He signaled for the driver to continue.

Some people.

Once they capture your heart.

You can never let them go.

。。。。。。。

Anna had just arrived at the office.

When she received an urgent notification.

An important client was visiting today.

Adrian Sinclair had instructed her to organize the documents.

Everything had to be completed before two o'clock.

She looked at the piles of numbers.

She couldn't help but massage her temples.

Last night, Mia had held her while crying about her troubles.

They had talked until dawn before finally sleeping.

Now her whole body felt heavy and groggy.

Noah Watson approached with some documents.

"We're both required to attend the meeting."

He quickly briefed her on the key points.

Anna took a deep breath.

She buried herself in her work.
###Chapter 308

Chloe Valentine walked in slowly, holding Grandpa Frederick's arm.

Noah Watson immediately greeted them respectfully.

Anna Ross gave a slight nod in acknowledgment.

The old man's gaze swept over her, his expression cold.

He allowed Chloe to support him as they moved toward the office.

Chloe glanced back at Anna.

Her eyes held clear triumph.

Anna lowered her gaze and continued working.

She was long accustomed to such cold treatment.

She focused on completing her tasks.

Finally, she finished all her work just before two o'clock.

Grandpa Frederick attended this meeting personally.

Chloe naturally followed by his side.

"Adrian, let Chloe stay with you."

The old man took both their hands and placed them together.

"She can assist if anything comes up."

Adrian Sinclair frowned slightly.

He quickly withdrew his hand.

"Understood, Grandpa."

Chloe's face stiffened instantly.

She hesitated before retracting her hand.

She shot an awkward look at the old man.

"Let's go."

Adrian walked to Anna's side.

He took the documents from her hands and began reviewing them.

Chloe glared at the two with resentment.

Grandpa gently held her hand.

"Don't mind him. You're the only one I recognize as my future granddaughter-in-law."

Chloe's eyes reddened.

She nodded obediently.

Hatred for Anna surged within her.

She would never easily let go of this woman who dared to seduce the man she loved.

Inside the conference room.

The client had been waiting for some time.

They stood up immediately upon seeing the group enter.

Anna looked up.

The other party had only brought two assistants.

The person in charge showed a flicker of surprise upon seeing her.

Though brief, she caught it clearly.

Did he know her?

Adrian happened to witness this moment.

His expression darkened instantly.

Grandpa and Chloe entered afterward.

The partner was flattered to see the Chairman in person.

They hurriedly offered warm greetings. "Chairman, it's been too long!"

Grandpa smiled and exchanged pleasantries.

Anna silently glanced at the client's information.

Leon Castillo.

She was certain she didn't know this person.

After the pleasantries, the meeting officially began.

Anna sat beside Adrian.

She was responsible for note-taking and handing over documents.

Chloe's gaze remained fixed on the two.

Her eyes seemed ready to spit fire.

"What is this?"

Leon Castillo's expression suddenly changed drastically.

He pushed the proposal toward Adrian.

"Your proposal has issues."

Adrian took the proposal and carefully reviewed it.

His frown deepened.

Leon looked at Grandpa with regret.

"Chairman, I truly wish to cooperate."

"But this set of data clearly plagiarizes another company."

Plagiarism?

Anna's heart skipped a beat.

Who would dare do such a thing?

Grandpa coughed violently in anger.

Chloe's eyes flickered.

She hurried forward to pour water and gently patted the old man's back.

Adrian slammed the proposal on the table.

He looked coldly at Chloe.

"I recall this was your responsibility."

All eyes instantly focused on her.

Chloe looked panicked.

"I... I don't know what happened."
###Chapter 309

Adrian Sinclair's expression was cold and severe.

An intimidating aura radiated from him.

Chloe Valentine noticed his displeasure.

She immediately turned to Grandpa Lowell.

Tears welled in her eyes.

She looked pitiful and vulnerable.

"Chairman, I truly had no idea."

"Perhaps it was a mistake by someone under me."

Adrian's voice was icy and sharp.

"Are you certain it was just your subordinate's error?"

Chloe stared at him, stunned.

He had never looked at her with such eyes before.

He was genuinely furious this time.

Grandpa Lowell suddenly spoke.

"Adrian, it's just a minor issue."

"There's no need to be so angry."

Anna Ross's eyes flickered slightly.

Grandpa's obvious favoritism toward Chloe was clear.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have defended her publicly.

Adrian didn't want to contradict his grandfather.

But his expression grew even darker.

Leon Castillo stated that the cooperation could only be terminated.

His gaze turned toward Anna.

His earlier displeasure seemed to fade somewhat.

It was replaced with a look of appreciation.

Anna was puzzled.

She had never met Leon Castillo before.

Why was he looking at her that way?

She didn't notice.

The man beside her had a terrifyingly gloomy look in his eyes.

"Please wait."

"The cooperation can still continue."

Anna suddenly remembered the data research she had done at the branch office.

She had just reviewed the materials this morning.

This was a project she had previously helped prepare.

Although several months had passed.

The data was still usable.

Skeptical looks were cast her way.

Clearly, no one believed her.

Adrian studied her for a moment.

He said in a deep voice, "Don't force yourself."

"It's fine if this project is scrapped."

He didn't want her to take risks in front of everyone.

Especially with his grandfather present.

Grandpa Lowell snorted coldly.

"Some people are being too unrealistic."

The harsh words stung Anna.

She only wanted to do her best to salvage the situation.

Chloe was first taken aback.

Then she secretly felt pleased.

Anna wanted to seize the opportunity to show off.

But she wouldn't even get the chance.

Chloe almost laughed aloud.

Her earlier tension had completely vanished.

But Leon suddenly spoke.

"She doesn't seem to be lying."

"Since there's a chance to save the cooperation."

"Why not let her try?"

He leaned forward.

His eyes fixed on Adrian across the table.

Adrian remained silent for a long time.

Finally, he made a decision.

"You can give it a try."

"But how confident are you?"

He raised his eyes.

His gaze was even more profound than before.

Anna gripped the edge of the document folder tightly.

She nodded with determination.

Chloe sneered from the side.

She wanted to see how Anna would handle this.

She couldn't wait to see her humiliated.

Grandpa Lowell looked grave.

His scrutinizing gaze fell on Anna.

Under everyone's watchful eyes.

Adrian stepped aside.

Anna calmly took a seat.

She switched the computer screen.

She took out her phone.

And quickly began to work.
###Chapter 310

Adrian Sinclair looked down at the figure focused on her work.

The tension in his brow gradually eased.

The knot in his chest finally loosened.

She didn't seem to be lying.

Anna Ross projected the new data onto the large screen.

She turned to Leon Castillo, a confident smile gracing her lips. "Mr. Castillo, please take a look."

All eyes focused on the screen.

It was the crucial data the project desperately needed.

Leon Castillo stared for a moment, then burst into hearty laughter.

He couldn't help but applaud. "Excellent! This is exactly the result I wanted!"

He looked at Adrian Sinclair with appreciation. "Mr. Sinclair, your subordinate is remarkably capable."

Adrian's lips curved slightly as he nodded in acknowledgment.

Chloe Valentine stood frozen in place.

This was impossible.

The data was only stored in the Creative Department.

How could she have completed it in such a short time?

The cooperation was successfully finalized.

The project would officially launch next month.

This meant the Lowell Corporation would reach new heights.

Grandpa couldn't help but glance at the screen a few more times.

This girl truly had talent.

His grandson had not misjudged her.

"Chairman, Mr. Sinclair, I wish us a pleasant cooperation."

Leon Castillo signed the contract and handed it to Adrian Sinclair.

The gloom in Adrian's eyes completely dissipated.

He took the pen from Noah Watson and signed with a swift stroke.

Noah cast a look of admiration toward Anna Ross.

This cooperation was critically important.

If not for her turning the tide.

The company would likely have sunk into another two weeks of low pressure.

After all, their Mr. Sinclair would fairly torment every employee.

Noah was instructed to see Leon Castillo and his party off.

Upon parting, Leon specifically walked up to Anna Ross.

He offered a meaningful smile. "Miss Ross, we will meet again."

Anna was slightly taken aback.

By the time she collected herself, he had already walked away.

"Adrian, come to the office."

Grandpa slowly rose.

Chloe moved forward to support him, but he gently pushed her away.

"Chloe, I need to speak with Adrian alone."

His tone was affectionate, yet carried an undeniable firmness.

A sense of loss washed over Chloe.

Grandpa had never rejected her like this before.

Though displeased, she dared not defy him.

After all, her marriage to Adrian relied on Grandpa's support.

"I'll wait for you outside," she said with a compliant smile.

Grandpa said no more and turned to leave.

The smile instantly vanished from her face.

As Adrian passed by Anna, he suddenly leaned in close.

His warm breath brushed her ear. "You certainly have no shortage of men around you."

His voice was low. "Wait for me after work."

Anna looked up in surprise, nearly brushing his lips.

The proximity left her momentarily speechless.

Chloe stared intently at their intimate posture.

Her nails dug deeply into her palms.

She was about to speak when Adrian turned and left the conference room.

Anna's cheeks flushed.

She wanted to explain, but he clearly gave her no opportunity.
###Chapter 311
Anna Ross smoothed the edges of the scattered documents.
She meticulously straightened each paper's crease.

"Impressive as always, Executive Assistant Ross." Chloe Valentine leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. "Adrian often praises your competence."
Her high heels clicked sharply against the floor.
She paced across the empty conference room.

Anna gathered the files and turned to leave.

"What did he say to you just now?" Chloe closed the distance, gripping Anna’s wrist.
Her nails dug into Anna’s skin.

Anna pulled free. "Ask him yourself, Miss Valentine."
She walked toward the exit without looking back.

Chloe stood rigid.
Her nails pressed deep crescents into her own palm.
How dare a mere assistant disrespect her?
This problem needed elimination. Fast.

The hallway echoed with emptiness.
Anna’s footsteps rang unnervingly loud.

Raised voices spilled from the CEO’s office.
Adrian Sinclair’s tone vibrated with suppressed fury.

The door jerked open.
Grandpa Frederick emerged, face thunderous.
Their eyes met.
His gaze held undisguised contempt.

Anna forced a smile.
He snorted and stormed off.

She exhaled slowly.
Gathered her things to leave.

Adrian waited at the reception desk.
"I’ve got all the time in the world," he drawled, leaning against the wall.

Anna deliberately slowed her movements.
He watched, patience unyielding.

"Need me to carry you again?" He closed the distance abruptly.
His fingers tilted her chin up.

She slapped his hand away. "I can walk!"

"Isn’t this what you wanted?" His voice carried deliberately.
Colleagues glanced their way.

Adrian locked an arm around her shoulders, steering her toward the elevator.
Anna struggled futilely.

The elevator filled with departing staff.
Sideways glances flickered between them.
Anna shrank into the corner, cheeks flushed crimson.

###Chapter 312

Adrian Sinclair didn't stop her.

The elevator halted.

The others quickly said their goodbyes.

Adrian pulled Anna Ross from the corner.

He dragged her outside.

They reached the car.

He shoved her into the passenger seat.

"What do you want?"

Anna tried to escape.

He held her down.

The man leaned in close.

His lips brushed her cheek.

"Come with me after work."

"What do you think I want?"

Anna's heart raced.

She wiped the sensation from her face.

He's insane.

He fastened his seatbelt.

Slammed the car door.

The vehicle moved.

It finally stopped before a villa.

Anna scanned the surroundings.

She didn't recognize this place.

"Where is this?"

"My home," he replied flatly.

He stepped out.

His home?

Anna remained frozen.

She couldn't decipher his intentions.

Adrian urged her.

"Get out."

Seeing her hesitation, he leaned by the window.

"Need me to carry you?"

Anna immediately exited the car.

She walked ahead quickly.

Adrian always acted so arrogantly.

He constantly opposed her.

"Why bring me to your home?"

"I'm alone here."

"Don't be nervous," he glanced at her.

He walked ahead.

Anna's gaze flickered.

She resisted entering through that door.

After a moment's hesitation, she followed him inside.

Just past the entrance, Adrian pinned her against the wall.

He pressed close to her ear.

"What's your relationship with Leon Castillo?"

He nibbled her earlobe.

Anna shuddered violently.

She pushed him away forcefully.

"I don't know him."

"Stop imagining things that don't exist."

Adrian licked his lips.

A slight smile touched the corners of his mouth.

"Is that so?"

"Then why did you meet him?"

"He told me."

"If you have questions, ask him."

Anna glared at him angrily.

This man was too stubborn.

He demanded explanations.

Yet he never believed her.

Adrian fell silent.

He walked to the coat rack.

Removed his jacket.

"What are you doing?"

"Don't do anything reckless!" Anna retreated to the sofa.

His home was spacious.

Minimally decorated.

It felt stark.

The man chuckled softly.

He rolled up his sleeves.

Walked into the kitchen.

His voice carried from a distance.

"I'm hungry."

"Come help."

Anna gritted her teeth and glared.

She set her things down.

Reluctantly followed him into the kitchen.

Adrian retrieved vegetables from the refrigerator.

"I rarely come back here."

"Usually stay at Grandpa's."

"Not much food at home."

"Any dishes you're good at making?"

Anna froze.

Memories of their rented apartment days surfaced.

They used to cook together.

She only helped wash vegetables.

He never let her overexert herself.
###Chapter 313

"My cooking is average, but I can help wash the vegetables."

Anna Ross walked into the kitchen.

It was as cold and sparse as the living room.

Only the most basic cookware was present.

There were no extra decorations.

Such a monotonous space.

It truly didn't feel like a home.

She thought silently, taking the vegetables from his hands.

The sound of running water instantly filled the kitchen.

Anna carefully washed the ingredients.

The vegetables didn't look very fresh.

They seemed to have been stored for a long time.

Adrian Sinclair stood quietly behind her, watching.

Then he took the washed vegetables and began chopping.

He prepared all the ingredients with practiced ease.

He turned on the stove, poured oil, and began to stir-fry.

Anna was about to leave the kitchen.

Suddenly, she smelled an intense saltiness.

She quickly turned and rushed over.

"That's too much salt!"

She grabbed the spatula from his hand.

Rapidly stirring the food in the pan.

"You should go wait outside."

She couldn't help but frown.

He used to be so good at cooking.

How had he regressed this much?

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted slightly.

He picked up an apple and took a bite.

"Then I'll step out."

He turned and walked out of the kitchen.

His footsteps were light.

Half an hour later.

Three dishes and a soup were placed on the dining table.

Anna took off her apron.

She served two bowls of rice.

It had been a long time since she last cooked.

She wasn't sure if the taste was right.

Adrian approached with red wine and glasses.

His gaze swept over the dishes on the table.

"It looks very good."

His voice was calm.

But his slightly trembling fingers betrayed his emotions.

It had been so long since they had eaten a meal like this together.

He uncorked the wine bottle.

Casually glancing at the girl across from him.

A faint smile graced her face.

Adrian paused slightly.

Anna happened to look up.

He immediately averted his gaze.

Elegantly filling both glasses.

"I can't drink."

Anna saw the glass being pushed toward her.

She instinctively shrank back.

Last time, even a little made her feel unwell.

This much would definitely get her drunk.

Adrian raised an eyebrow with a light laugh.

"This wine has a very low alcohol content."

Anna cautiously took a small sip.

The sweet, refreshing taste was relaxing.

She couldn't help but take another taste.

Adrian chuckled softly.

"Don't drink too quickly."

He handed her the fork and knife.

"Have some food first."

Anna's cheeks felt warm.

She lowered her head to taste her own cooking.

Since moving into Howard Lowell's house.

She hadn't cooked at all.

The flavor was still acceptable.

She secretly observed Adrian.

He ate without changing expression.

His movements were graceful and composed.

Noticing her gaze.

He set down his utensils.

"I argued with Grandpa today."

He swirled his wine glass.

"Too ashamed to go back."

The red wine shimmered under the light.

"Consider this overtime."

He tilted his head back and took a sip.

His Adam's apple bobbed gently.

Anna hurriedly looked down.

Her heart beat faster for some reason.

"Why did you argue?"

She asked quietly.

She knew about today's events.

It seemed serious.
###Chapter 314

Adrian Sinclair set down his wine glass.

He watched her through narrowed eyes.

A moment of silence passed.

His voice was low. "He demanded I fire you."

"I refused."

His words were quiet.

Anna Ross's heart trembled.

She had clearly accomplished something today.

Yet Grandpa wanted her gone.

Did he despise her that much?

She had done nothing wrong.

Yet she was inexplicably hated.

Anna gripped her fork and knife tightly.

She lifted her glass and took a large gulp.

She choked from drinking too fast.

Violent coughs brought tears to her eyes.

Adrian's expression darkened slightly.

He passed her a napkin.

He said nothing.

Anna kept her head down, eating.

She was only at the company to earn money.

No matter what others said.

As long as she did nothing wrong.

The company had no reason to let her go.

"You don't need to be afraid."

"I won't let you go."

Adrian's tone was unreadable.

It sounded like comfort, yet also a promise.

She couldn't tell.

And she didn't want to.

His future could only be with Chloe Valentine.

That was what Grandpa wanted to see.

It had nothing to do with her.

Anna responded quietly, "Of course I'm not afraid."

"I haven't done anything wrong."

"Why should I leave the company?"

She fought back the sting in her nose.

Lifting her head, she met his gaze.

Adrian was slightly taken aback.

He had only seen this stubborn side of her during university.

Back then, she debated him with full confidence.

The world seemed to contain only the two of them.

Neither emerged victorious.

Neither would yield to the other.

They debated again later.

The result remained unchanged.

He clenched his jaw.

Lifting his glass, he drained it in one go.

Anna refused to lose.

She tilted her head back and finished hers as well.

A smile touched Adrian's lips.

He refilled both glasses.

They finished the entire bottle without realizing.

Anna was already feeling dizzy.

She leaned back in her chair, eyelids drooping.

She watched him open a new bottle of red wine.

She quickly waved her hand.

Mumbling a refusal, she said, "No more."

"I can't drink anymore."

Adrian lifted his gaze.

He saw her slumped weakly in the chair.

Like a little kitten.

Two flushed spots on her cheeks resembled red apples.

He wanted to take a bite.

The thought surfaced abruptly.

The next second, he picked up his glass and walked around the table.

"You know?"

"The way you look right now makes people want to tease you."

Adrian's large hand caressed her cheek.

His thumb gently stroked her skin.

Though dizzy, Anna heard his words clearly.

Her heart felt like it was lifted by the wind.

Beating rapidly.

She looked up at him.

The angle tugged at the man's heart.

Adrian's throat tightened.

He cursed under his breath.

He took a sip of red wine before leaning down.

One hand cupped her chin.

His lips covered hers.

"Mmm......"

Anna was forced to tilt her head back.

Realizing what he was doing.

Her eyes widened in shock.

It was too late to push him away.

She was forced to swallow the wine he poured into her mouth.

Adrian released her.

His gaze dropped to the red trickle at the corner of her mouth.

He reached out to wipe it away.

"You freak!"

Anna avoided his hand.

Intense humiliation made her heart ache.
###Chapter 315

Adrian Sinclair yanked the fleeing figure back into his arms.

A dangerous curve lifted the corner of his mouth. "I can get even crazier. Want to see?"

Anna Ross gasped as he threw her over his shoulder.

She pounded her fists against his back. "Let me go! I want to go home!"

He ignored her struggles and carried her straight to the bedroom.

Her heart sank.

Before she could react, she was tossed onto the soft bed.

His bedroom was shockingly spacious. The bed was large enough to fit four people.

Adrian knelt on the edge of the mattress with one knee.

His long fingers slowly undid the buttons of his shirt.

His toned chest peeked through the parting fabric.

Her gaze involuntarily dropped to his firm abdominal lines.

"Ah!" Her face flushed instantly.

She turned her head away in panic. "Adrian Sinclair, snap out of it!"

She tried to escape, but he caught her ankle.

The world spun as he pinned her firmly beneath him.

Anna held her breath, staring at him in a daze.

His fallen strands of hair brushed against her cheek.

His familiar, cool scent enveloped her completely.

"I am perfectly sober." He bit her reddened ear tip.

One hand restrained her wrists.

The other roamed freely. "Tell me. Why did you break up?"

She closed her eyes. The alcohol made her body temperature rise steadily.

She finally realized how strong the红酒's aftereffect was.

"Don't you already know?" She mumbled through bitten lips.

The air froze instantly.

The light in Adrian's eyes dimmed.

He kissed her lips with fierce intensity.

The taste of blood spread between their teeth.

Anna winced in pain but couldn't break free.

In the darkness, he stared at her pale little face.

After all this time, she still refused to tell him the truth.

Was she so desperate to cut ties with him?

Since she didn't want to stay, he would leave his mark himself.

He would make every inch of her skin remember his scent.

His gaze grew more ferocious.

He left countless bite marks on her body.

The marks bloomed like red roses, striking and bewitching.

Tears of pain welled in Anna's eyes.

She trembled lightly beneath him.

What was this?

She was just his secret mistress.

These boundary-crossing actions betrayed another girl every second.

She should have pulled away.

Yet she kept losing herself in his embrace.

"Fine. Don't talk." He took her hand and guided it around his waist. "I have plenty of ways to make you talk."

Anna tilted her face up dizzily.

As if enchanted, she held him tightly.

Buzz—

The sudden vibration of a phone broke the silence.

Anna jolted back to awareness. She looked toward the floor. "Your phone..."

"Ignore it." The man frowned displeased.

He increased the pressure of his hands.
###Chapter 316

Anna Ross bit her lip.

A wave of heat surged from deep within, threatening to consume her.

The phone rang insistently.

It pierced her consciousness like a needle.

She pushed Adrian Sinclair away abruptly.

Wrapping herself tightly in the blanket, her voice trembled.
"Your phone."

Adrian froze.

Unfaded desire churned in his eyes.

He ran a hand through his hair in frustration.

His well-defined chest rose and fell under the light.

He got out of bed and picked up his clothes.

Anna quickly looked away, her ears burning.

"Speak," he answered, his voice cold and deep.

Chloe Valentine's sobs came through the receiver.
"Adrian... can you come get me?"

Anna's nails dug into her palms.

She held her breath.

Adrian glanced at the figure curled up on the bed.

He deftly buttoned his shirt.
"Get home yourself."

Chloe stared at her distorted reflection in the car window.

Her voice choked with tears.
"Grandpa said you should look after me..."

"We'll be family soon."
Her nails dug into the leather seat.

A flash of anger crossed Adrian's eyes.

Finally, he said was hoarsely,
"Location."

The moment the call ended, he grabbed his coat and headed for the door.

The door slammed shut.

Anna lifted her head from the blankets.

Only cold, empty air remained in the room.

She slowly dressed.

She smoothed the bedsheet.

As if that could erase all traces.

Neon lights flashed outside the taxi window.

She watched the blurry lights.

Her heart felt torn open.

The apartment was terrifyingly empty.

Sophia wasn't home.

Even her breath echoed.

Hot water streamed over her skin.

Yet she felt increasingly cold.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

That name flashed on the screen.

She took a deep breath and answered.

"Anna..."
The voice was urgent.
"You have to help me this time."
###Chapter 317

Anna Ross felt utterly drained.

But her mother was still in his grasp.

She had no choice but to endure it.

Howard Lowell glanced at the person beside him.

There was only silence from the other end of the line.

His anger burned hotter.

"It seems I've been too lenient with you."

"You're becoming more disobedient by the day."

His阴沉 voice traveled through the receiver.

Anna couldn't suppress a shudder.

"Don't touch my mother."

"Tell me what you want."

Hearing her surrender, Howard's expression softened slightly.

But then he thought of his embarrassment position at the company.

The fire in his heart roared back to life.

"Tell Adrian Sinclair to give me a promotion."

"A higher position."

Anna was speechless.

"I'm not all-powerful."

"Getting you into headquarters was difficult enough."

"Why can't you ever be satisfied?"

She forgot human greed is endless.

A taste only makes one crave more.

Howard let out a cruel laugh.

"Have you forgotten what I said?"

"The Lowell Group should have been mine."

"I will take it all back."

Adrian Sinclair is just an outsider.

He has no right to what is rightfully mine.

The company bears the Lowell name.

Not Sinclair.

Listening to his voice, a chill ran down Anna's spine.

She had seen firsthand how he treated her mother.

If Adrian ever fell into his hands...

The consequences didn't bear thinking about.

After a moment of silence, she responded quietly.

"I'll try to think of something."

"But I can't promise he'll agree."

Howard brought the phone closer to his lips.

He chuckled darkly.

"Don't worry."

"As long as you ask."

"He will definitely agree."

He'd already heard the boy argued with the old man for Anna's sake.

This daughter was now his most powerful weapon.

Once a person has a weakness, it's exposed for enemies to exploit.

Anna didn't want to talk anymore.

She gave a noncommittal reply and hung up.

Howard tossed the phone onto the bed triumphantly.

Vivian Lowell happened to come out with a basket of clean laundry.

He called out to stop her.

"Darling."

"Come here."

"I have something to tell you."

Vivian looked at his insincere smile.

She paused.

Finally, she set the clothes down and walked over.

"Look at this bustling city."

"Don't you want to stay here forever?"
Howard wrapped an arm around her waist.

Together, they looked down at the lively streets below.

Vivian wasn't used to this sudden intimacy.

But her heart stirred nonetheless.

When they first got together, he had spoiled her rotten.

Though no longer young, they acted like passionate lovers.

Yet even then, he only saw her as his mistress.

He never intended to marry her.

It was only after she faked a pregnancy that he happily announced their relationship.

He took it upon himself to marry her.

When the truth came out, he grew cold and distant.

Verbal abuse turned physical.

Seeing her distraction, Howard felt displeased.

But then he reconsidered.

Her daughter was still useful.

For now, he needed to keep her stable.

"Darling."

"I was wrong before."

"I was angry because you deceived me."

"But my feelings for you never changed."
He pulled her into an embrace.

He spoke with feigned affection.

Vivian's heart fluttered.

She looked up at him.

"What's gotten into you today?"

Howard just held her tighter.

His finger gently pressed against her lips.

"I just suddenly realized."

"I truly love you."

"Once I reclaim the Lowell Group."

"I'll give you the very best the world has to offer."
###Chapter 318

“We will have a daughter of our own someday.”

“Our family of three will live the happiest life.”

Vivian Lowell was deeply moved by the beautiful future he painted.

If her daughter could have a stable and happy life, she would have no regrets.

“Darling, I believe you.” She nestled gently against his chest, listening to his steady heartbeat.

Howard Lowell curled his lips into a triumphant smile.

His gaze drifted into the distance.

The Lowell Group would ultimately belong only to the Lowell family!

Anna Ross worked busily at her desk all morning.

She realized Adrian Sinclair hadn’t shown up at the company today.

She organized her files and headed to the cafeteria for lunch.

The cafeteria food was average, but it was affordable.

It helped her save a considerable amount of money.

While waiting in line, a conversation between two girls behind her caught her attention.

“I heard Mr. Sinclair and Director Valentine didn’t come to the company today.”

“Do you think they’re engaged?” one girl whispered softly.

Anna unconsciously held her breath, listening carefully.

The other girl glanced around mysteriously before replying.

“Maybe they’re already together in private.”

“They just haven’t made it public yet.”

“Sigh, when will I ever meet a man as exceptional as Mr. Sinclair…”

Their words reached Anna’s ears clearly.

A faint ache prickled in her heart.

She had never deeply considered it before.

Although he said he didn’t want to get married, those words might have just been casual remarks.

Then, the two continued talking.

“I heard someone saw Mr. Sinclair picking up Director Valentine from the company late last night.”

“And Mr. Sinclair suppressed the issue with the proposal this time.”

“It seems their relationship is very strong.”

Anna didn’t want to hear anymore.

She quickly got her food and found a quiet corner to eat.

She didn’t understand why she felt this way.

Hearing news about him made her restless.

She was just an ex-girlfriend.

A presence that couldn’t see the light.

She finished her lunch quickly.

She numbed her thoughts with work.

After work, she proactively went to apologize to her boss.

“Pamela, something came up suddenly last night, and I couldn’t make it.”

“I promise it won’t happen again.”

Surprisingly, her boss wasn’t angry.

Instead, she seemed very pleased.

“Anna, it’s alright.”

“I have good news for you.”

“That mysterious guest is here again.”

“Make sure to perform well tonight.” She pointed in a certain direction.

Anna followed her gaze.

A man wearing a hat nodded in her direction.

Under her boss’s expectant gaze, she stepped onto the stage.

For some reason, she found herself unconsciously paying attention to that mysterious guest in the audience.

Who was he?

He seemed to recognize her.
###Chapter 319

Anna Ross finished her last song.

Her gaze drifted to the seat where the mysterious man usually sat.

But the seat was already empty.

Only a thick stack of cash remained.

She collected the money.

The cold touch of the bills brushed her fingertips.

Suspicion grew heavier in her heart.

She tossed and turned all night.

In her dreams, a dark shadow chased her relentlessly.

It forced her to the edge of a cliff.

A pair of icy hands suddenly pushed her into the abyss.

Anna woke up in a cold sweat.

Morning light filtered through the gaps in the curtains.

She clutched her pounding chest.

Only after confirming she was safe did she slowly breathe.

Seven o'clock sharp.

She arrived at the company early.

Noah Watson placed a stack of files on her desk.

"Mr. Sinclair is not in today."

"Just organize these documents simply."

Anna took the files.

Her eyes unconsciously drifted toward the closed general manager's office.

Her phone screen suddenly lit up.

Julian Garnache's call flashed urgently.

She answered and heard his anxious voice.

"Anna, Mia is missing!"

Anna shot to her feet.

Files scattered across the floor.

"Since when?"

"She's been unreachable since yesterday."

"We were supposed to watch a movie together, but she never showed."

"Her phone is off this morning."

Anna hung up immediately.

She quickly dialed Mia Lawrence's number.

The cold tone of a powered-off phone echoed in her ear.

She grabbed her bag and rushed out of the company.

The taxi sped through the streets.

Her nails dug deeply into her palms.

Mia had no relatives in this city.

If something happened, no one would be there for her.

Arriving at the real estate sales center.

The front desk was crowded with consulting clients.

Anna scanned the entire hall.

But she never saw that familiar figure.

"Looking for a property?"

A salesperson in a suit approached.

He held property brochures in his hand.

Anna waved hurriedly.

"I'm looking for Mia Lawrence."

"Did she come to work today?"

The salesperson paused.

"She asked for leave three days ago."

Leave?

Anna's heart sank.

She didn't even tell me about taking leave.

Could she really be upset over relationship issues?

She turned and ran out the glass door.

She bumped into Julian Garnache, who had rushed over.

He had jumped out of his car without even closing the window.

"Anna! Mia, she..."

"She seemed very off last time at the restaurant."

They exchanged a look.

Both rushed toward the parking lot elevator.
###Chapter 320

Anna Ross's gaze darkened slightly.

She shook her head gently.

"It's nothing."

She went straight upstairs to find her best friend's apartment.

Standing before the door, she raised her hand to knock.

No one answered.

"Mia, are you home?" Anna called out, raising her voice.

The room remained silent.

Anxiety and worry instantly gripped her heart.

She dialed the phone again.

No one picked up on the other end.

Julian Garnache followed her up and saw her crouched by the wall.

His heart ached as he helped her up, brushing the dust from her clothes.

"Anna, are you keeping something from me?"

Anna bit her lip and looked up.

"Julian, do you have a girlfriend?"

She paused.

"Or someone you like?"

Julian frowned, his face filled with confusion.

"Why are you suddenly asking this, Anna?"

"Actually, Mia—"

A phone ringtone cut through the air abruptly.

Seeing the caller ID, Anna nearly jumped.

She answered the call immediately.

"Mia, where are you?" Her voice choked with emotion.

"I couldn't find you at the company or at home!"

Julian took a step closer, trying to hear the conversation.

Mia Lawrence's cheerful voice came through.

"Don't worry, Anna. I had some family matters to attend to in San Francisco."

She said lightly, "I'm already on my way back to New York."

Both of them breathed a sigh of relief at the same time.

Anna headed downstairs while asking, "Where are you now? I'll come pick you up."

Before she finished speaking, they met at the staircase landing.

"Mia, you scared me to death!" Anna rushed over and hugged her tightly.

Mia was knocked back a step, quickly grabbing the handrail.

"Are you trying to push me down the stairs?"

She felt the trembling in her arms.

Anna's shoulders shook slightly, her tears soaking Mia's clothes.

"I was going crazy with worry on my way here."

Her voice was choked with sobs.

"You have to tell me in advance if something comes up. I'll worry about you."

Mia was stunned, whispering an apology.

"I'm sorry, Anna. It won't happen again."

She looked up and saw Julian coming down the stairs.

The smile on her face gradually faded.

Julian noticed her coldness.

He hesitated, then offered a smile.

"Mia."

Mia only gave a polite nod.

"Sorry for making you worry."

She took Anna's hand and turned to go upstairs.

As she passed Julian, she acted as if she didn't see him.

Meanwhile, at Sinclair Group.

Chloe Valentine walked to Anna's workstation.

She found the seat empty.

After waiting for a moment, she went straight to the surveillance room.

When she pulled up the surveillance footage, a triumphant smile curled her lips.

Anna had indeed left her post during work hours.

This violated Sinclair Group's strict regulations.

A cold glint flashed in Chloe's eyes.

Anna Ross, you won't escape this time.
###Chapter 321

Anna Ross and Mia Lawrence returned to their apartment.

Julian Garnache made sure they were safe before rushing back to the bar.

"Mia, you clearly have feelings for Julian. Why won't you tell him?" Anna looked toward the door, her voice hesitant.

She had almost spoken up for her friend.

But that phone call had interrupted them.

Mia set down her luggage and shook her head gently. "If he has someone else in his heart, why should I embarrass myself?"

"This trip home made me realize something. I need to focus on living my life well from now on. Don't worry about me."

She handed over a paper box.

Anna took it and realized it was a specialty dessert from San Francisco.

Her friend still remembered her favorite pastry.

Anna reached out and hugged Mia tightly.

"Mia, I'll always be here for you."

Mia stiffened for a moment before returning the embrace.

She couldn't handle emotional scenes and quickly changed the subject. "Worry about yourself first. Adrian Sinclair or Lucas Evans? Who will you choose?"

Anna was instantly speechless.

She didn't want to choose either of them.

But the words stuck in her throat, unable to be spoken.

She sat silently on the edge of the bed.

"Anna, stop avoiding this. Just tell Adrian the truth about what happened back then. You clearly still care about him—"

"Mia!"

Anna cut her off urgently.

"He has a fiancée now. I just want to earn enough money to take my mother away."

She wouldn't stay in this city any longer.

Mia smiled bitterly. "We really are a pair of troubled sisters."

Her phone suddenly rang.

Anna saw the caller ID and realized she should have been at the office long ago.

"Oh no!" She grabbed her bag and rushed out the door. "Mia, I have to go! I'll explain later!"

Before Mia could react, the door slammed shut.

Anna answered the phone.

Noah Watson's anxious voice came through. "Where are you? Get back here now!"

"I'm on my way!" She urged the driver incoherently. "Sir, can you go any faster?"

The driver glanced helplessly into the rearview mirror. "It's completely gridlocked up ahead. We'll have to wait."

Anna looked up.

The line of cars stretched endlessly ahead.

She was finished.

If she got caught sneaking out during work hours...

Grandpa was already watching her closely.

Getting caught this time would definitely get her fired from the company.

The road remained clogged for half an hour before finally clearing.

She sprinted back to the company where Noah was waiting at the entrance.

"The Chairman is here. Be careful."

Adrian wasn't around.

No one could help her now.
###Chapter 322

Anna Ross’s heart tightened.

Why would Grandpa Lowell suddenly appear at the company?

And at this exact moment.

She pressed her lips together and responded softly, "Okay, I'm coming now."

Noah Watson glanced anxiously upstairs and lowered his voice. "Why did you leave your post suddenly? Today is crucial."

He remembered repeatedly reminding her not to leave without permission during work hours.

She was always careful. How could she make such a mistake?

Anna lowered her gaze. "There was an emergency. I didn't have time to ask for leave."

She paused, her voice very quiet. "I'll accept any punishment."

Noah hesitated.

This time, it probably wouldn't be just a simple punishment.

He silently led her to the conference room door and waited outside.

Anna pushed the door open.

Grandpa Lowell sat at the head of the table, his face dark with anger.

Chloe Valentine stood beside him, triumph shining in her eyes.

"Anna Ross?" The old man gave her a cold glance.

Anna nodded.

It was Chloe's doing again, as expected.

Grandpa slammed his hand on the table. "Company rules clearly state no unauthorized absence during work hours."

His tone was severe. "You know the consequences."

He thought of his disappointing son and grew more determined to remove this girl.

Chloe spoke softly. "Grandpa, Executive Assistant Ross has helped Adrian a lot..."

She feigned concern. "Adrian values her highly. Perhaps we can be lenient?"

Anna gave her a cool glance.

The other woman's schadenfreude was almost overflowing.

Grandpa became even angrier. "Rules are rules!"

He stated firmly, "Go pack your things now."

Anna did not look up.

She could feel the two pairs of disgusted eyes on her.

Chloe pretended to step forward and take her hand. "Executive Assistant Ross, I really want to help you..."

Anna withdrew her hand and coldly stepped back half a step. "No need for your concern, Miss Valentine."

Grandpa grew more displeased seeing her attitude.

Just then, the conference room door suddenly swung open.

Howard Lowell walked in reluctantly.

Under his father's furious gaze, he stood beside Anna.

"Dad, what did Anna do wrong?" He spoke while giving Anna a meaningful look.

Chloe's heart tightened.

What if Grandpa softened?

She couldn't let all her efforts go to waste now.

Grandpa snorted coldly. "Ask her yourself."

He was merciless. "Take her away from the company after you're done."

Howard's heart sank.

His father was unusually resolute this time.

Chloe secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

It seemed she didn't need to do anything more.
###Chapter 323

Howard Lowell gently tugged at Anna Ross's sleeve.

He whispered a reproach.

"Anna."

"Just admit your mistake."

"Grandpa will forgive you."

The old man cut in coldly.

"No explanations needed."

"Let her leave."

He stood up to depart.

Chloe Valentine shot a triumphant glance at Anna.

She hurried forward to support him.

The door suddenly swung open.

Adrian Sinclair stepped inside.

The air instantly froze.

"Grandpa."

"What brings you to the company?"

His gaze swept over Anna.

He helped the old man sit back down.

Grandpa looked displeased.

"Someone here made a mistake."

"I came to handle it for you."

Chloe lowered her head silently.

Adrian saw through it at once.

"Grandpa."

"You entrusted the company to me."

"How to handle matters..."

"Should be my decision."

His breathing was slightly rushed.

He seemed to have hurried over.

Anna's fingertips tightened.

She worried her absence would be exposed.

Chloe sensed trouble.

He was actually defending her.

She suddenly feigned grievance.

"Grandpa."

"It's my fault for meddling."

"Please punish me instead."

Grandpa patted her hand.

"Good child."

"The one who should be punished is the wrongdoer."

Anna started to speak.

But Adrian's look stopped her.

Adrian chuckled lightly.

"Since Grandpa mentioned mistakes..."

"It reminds me of the proposal incident."

He tapped his fingers lightly on the desk.

Chloe's heart leaped in fear.

Howard watched coldly from the sidelines.

Secretly pleased.

Anna was stunned.

He was confronting Grandpa for her.

Grandpa choked with anger.

"You..."

Adrian's gaze turned icy.

"Director Valentine."

"The proposal was your responsibility."

Chloe panicked.

"Adrian."

"Let me explain."

Grandpa rose abruptly.

"Adrian."

"What are you doing?"

Adrian stood firm.

"I'm punishing the wrongdoer."

"If you're dissatisfied, Grandpa..."

"I will no longer manage the company."

Howard's eyes gleamed.

Grandpa swayed slightly.

Chloe quickly steadied him.

"Adrian."

"Don't upset Grandpa."

Emotion flickered in Adrian's eyes.

He finally suppressed it.

Grandpa waved his hand with a sigh.

"Enough."

"I won't force you."

"Manage the company well."
###Chapter 324

Grandpa...

Chloe Valentine was on the verge of tears.

The failure of her plan was hard to accept.

What shocked her even more was the extent of Adrian Sinclair's concern for Anna Ross.

He was willing to abandon the company for this woman.

This completely exceeded her expectations.

Grandpa Frederick cast a deep glance at Anna.

He finally turned away helplessly.

Howard Lowell quickly followed, his face full of regret.

The conference room fell silent.

Anna looked up.

Adrian was leaning back with his eyes closed, massaging his temples.

He looked exhausted.

Questions swirled in her mind.

Hadn't the proposal issue already been resolved?

"Thank you," she said softly.

She turned and poured a glass of water.

"I planned to take the day off, but you weren't in the office."

She placed the water in front of him and stood quietly nearby.

Adrian glanced at the glass.

He picked it up and took a sip.

"Tell me in advance next time. Don't be so impulsive."

He set the glass down and stood to leave.

His expression remained dark.

Anna stood frozen in place for a long time.

Her mind was in turmoil.

He had confronted Grandpa for her.

Would this affect his future?

He had finally stabilized his position.

He shouldn't face more turmoil because of her.

......

Anna lowered her head and walked out of the conference room.

Suddenly, a shadow fell over her.

Howard stood with his arms crossed, blocking her path.

"Anna, you continue to surprise me. Adrian actually listens to you."

Anna frowned.

"I took a risk to help you today. Don't you think you should repay me?" Howard lowered his voice, his eyes darting behind him.

"Thank you. I'll remember it," Anna said softly.

"Just remember it? There's an opportunity to repay me right now. Tell Adrian to transfer me to a position with access to core projects." He spread his arms, his smile cold, as if he wanted to take control of the entire company.

Anna stood frozen, speechless.

Around the corner, a pair of dark eyes watched everything.

Then they silently disappeared.

Anna returned to her workstation feeling dejected.

The office door happened to close at that moment.

She glanced at it curiously, then lowered her head and continued working.

Chloe stormed into the office and slammed the door shut.

She swept everything off the desk onto the floor.

"I was so close! I was so close to getting that bitch out of here!"

She stomped on the documents on the floor.

She pulled out her phone and made a call.

"Mom, you have to help me," she sobbed as soon as the call connected. "Someone is trying to steal my man!"

Lydia Valentine put down her mahjong tiles.

A sharp glint flashed in her eyes.

"Explain everything slowly. What happened?"
###Chapter 325

The temperature in New York dropped sharply.

Every morning felt like a battle for Anna Ross.

The air outside her blanket was bitingly cold.

She wished she could stay curled up in her warm bed forever.

How wonderful it would be to earn money without going to work.

This thought had crossed her mind countless times.

But fantasies remained fantasies.

She still had to go to work.

The company was exceptionally busy at the end of the year.

Anna had barely sat down when she answered over a dozen calls.

Before she could even put the receiver down.

The phone rang again.

She glanced at the name on the screen.

It was Sophia Roscente.

It was unexpected for her to call at this hour.

"Sophia, what's up?"

She asked softly while checking spreadsheet data.

A cheerful laugh came from the other end.

"Sis, come to my place after work!"

Anna's fingers paused over the keyboard.

"I have my bar performance tonight."

"Let's hang out another day."

"No, no, no!"

Sophia's tone was firm.

"Mom specifically asked for you to come."

"Today is her birthday."

Cecilia Roscente's gentle voice sounded in the background.

"Anna, you must come."

"I'll have Adrian pick you up."

Adrian Sinclair picking her up?

Anna's scalp prickled instantly.

She was about to refuse.

But the call had already ended.

Looking at the darkened screen.

She sighed softly.

It seemed she had no choice but to go.

She needed to quickly prepare a gift.

As soon as the bell sounded.

Anna rushed straight to the Shopping Mall.

This was her first time selecting a gift for Cecilia.

She felt a bit uncertain.

She lingered at the jewelry counter for a long time.

But couldn't find a suitable style.

"Need any help?"

A shop assistant approached with a smile.

"I want to choose a gift for an elder."

"Something simple and elegant would be best."

The assistant's eyes lit up.

"We just received some new designs."

"Let me show them to you."

Anna nodded and waited.

Suddenly, someone tapped her shoulder.

Turning around, she saw Julian Garnache's bright smile.

"It really is you, Anna."

He naturally ruffled her hair.

"Looking at necklaces?"

"Let me get it for you."

Anna helplessly smoothed her bangs.

She always told him not to mess with her hair.

He never listened.

Her gaze shifted.

She noticed the girl standing next to Julian.

Her breath hitched slightly.

It was the girl she had seen at the restaurant.

Julian followed her gaze.

He introduced with a smile.

"Anna, this is my sister."

The girl smiled sweetly.

"Hi, sis. I'm Natalie Garnache."

"We met when we were kids."

"I thought you were so pretty back then."

"You're even more beautiful now."
###Chapter 326

Anna Ross's eyes widened in shock.

She finally noticed the teardrop mole at the corner of the girl's eye.

It was identical to Julian Garnache's.

Memories instantly flooded back.

She had indeed met this girl during her childhood.

But Natalie Garnache had moved abroad with her parents too early.

Anna had nearly forgotten.

She forced a smile.

"So it's Natalie."

"It really has been a long time."

"I almost didn't recognize you."

A bitter feeling rose in her heart.

She and her best friend had mistaken this girl for Julian's girlfriend.

They had been upset for nothing.

It was all just a misunderstanding.

Why did these things always happen to her?

Natalie Garnache affectionately linked arms with her.

She lowered her voice and asked, "Sis."

"My brother has been back in the country for so long."

"Has he gotten a girlfriend yet?"

"Natalie." Julian Garnache shot her a stern look.

Natalie wasn't intimidated at all.

Instead, she became even more persistent.

"Brother, you're not getting any younger."

"If you don't get a girlfriend soon, you'll become a sugar daddy."

"Don't come crying to me when no one wants you then."

She stuck out her tongue playfully.

Anna couldn't help but laugh.

Julian Garnache's face darkened instantly.

He grabbed his sister and moved her aside.

"You're so immature."

"No sense of respect."

"You're much more sensible, little sister." He massaged his temples in frustration.

Clearly, his sister's antics were giving him a headache.

Anna chuckled softly.

"She's quite adorable, though."

"She's just concerned about you."

The store clerk brought out several necklaces.

She arranged them neatly in front of Anna.

"Based on your request," she said considerately.

"I selected these."

"Please see if any meet your satisfaction."

Anna examined them carefully.

These were clearly much nicer than the ones in the display case.

Julian Garnache watched for a moment.

He asked curiously, "Buying for yourself?"

"No."

"It's a gift for someone."

Anna's eyes immediately landed on a blue star necklace.

Her eyes lit up.

She picked it up for a closer look.

"I'll take this one."

"Please wrap it for me."

The clerk was delighted.

She took it away for packaging with excellent service.

Though simple in design, this piece was the most expensive among the selection.

Julian Garnache pinched her cheek again.

He teased, "For whom?"

"I've never seen you buy gifts for anyone before."

Anna swatted his hand away.

She beamed brightly.

"Just because I didn't before doesn't mean I won't now."

"Hmm."

"The little one has grown up."

"When will you give your big brother a gift too?" Julian found teasing this sister most enjoyable.

Watching her scrunch up her face was utterly adorable.

Anna snorted lightly.

She ignored him after that.

Someone secretly photographed all of this.

Neither of them noticed.

After obtaining the necklace, Anna headed to the bar.

She planned to sing a couple of songs before leaving.

That way, the boss wouldn't have anything to say.

Just as she prepared to go on stage, her phone rang incessantly.

The caller ID showed Adrian Sinclair's name.

Her hand trembled slightly.

She answered eventually.

"I'm outside the bar where you work."

"You have one minute to come out."

The man's commanding tone annoyed her.

But since he was here, he would undoubtedly use any means to take her away.

Helpless, she had to agree.

The bar owner didn't object.

He simply allowed her to leave.
###Chapter 327

Anna Ross stepped out of the company's main entrance.

Adrian Sinclair was already standing by his car.

He reached out and opened the passenger door.

Anna hesitated for a moment.

She bent down and got in.

The car drove smoothly.

She looked out the window.

Suddenly, she realized the route was wrong.

"This isn't the way to Sophia's house."

She turned to look at the driver's seat.

Adrian held the steering wheel with one hand.

His gaze swept over her professional attire.

"You're wearing that to a birthday party?"

Anna looked down at herself.

White blouse, black trousers.

It really wasn't appropriate.

"I think it's fine…"

She defended herself quietly.

Adrian said nothing more.

He focused on driving.

Half an hour later.

The car stopped in front of a high-end boutique.

Anna looked at the gorgeous gowns in the window.

She instinctively touched her wallet.

She had already overspent on the gift today.

Buying a gown was simply too much.

She stood rooted to the spot, refusing to move.

Adrian directly grasped her wrist.

He led her into the store.

Anna struggled but failed.

She could only follow him inside.

A sales associate greeted them warmly.

The store was filled with beautiful gowns.

Adrian's eyes scanned the display racks.

They stopped on a white mermaid gown.

"Get that one."

The associate quickly retrieved the gown.

She smiled at Anna. "Your husband has excellent taste."

Anna quickly shook her head.

"He's not—"

Before she could finish.

The gown was pushed into her arms.

"Go try it on."

Adrian's tone was cold.

Anna carried the gown into the fitting room.

The dress was exquisitely tailored.

It fit her perfectly.

She pushed open the fitting room door.

Adrian was waiting on the sofa.

He looked up at the sound.

His gaze instantly deepened.

Anna walked to the mirror.

Her reflection was elegant and captivating.

Adrian stood and approached.

He stopped behind her.

Their eyes met in the mirror.

"It suits you."

He said in a low voice.
###Chapter 328

Anna Ross lowered her head in silence.

The boutique was brilliantly lit, making her cheeks feel warm.

Adrian Sinclair's voice sounded beside her. "Aunt Cecilia is hosting a party tonight. All the guests will be dressed formally. You don't need to feel out of place."

When she looked up, he was already walking toward a sales assistant, speaking in low tones.

Anna glanced at the price tag. Her fingers trembled slightly.

The cost of this gown equaled several months of her salary. Yet it would only be worn once. It felt excessively extravagant.

The sales assistant approached with a smile, gesturing for her to follow. "This way, please. We will do your hair and makeup."

Anna hesitated, looking back.

Adrian lounged lazily on the sofa. He raised an eyebrow, signaling for her to relax.

The makeup artist applied light cosmetics. Her curls were swept up into an elegant chignon.

When she stepped out of the fitting room again, Adrian's gaze deepened instantly. He seemed rooted to the spot.

The sales assistant couldn't help but exclaim, "You look absolutely stunning."

The tips of Anna's ears turned pink.

Adrian strode over and pulled her into his arms. "Time to go." His breath brushed against her hair.

"Wait, the payment—" Anna said urgently.

The sales assistant smiled. "This gentleman has already taken care of it."

Silence filled the car.

He leaned over to fasten her seatbelt. His shirt sleeve brushed against her arm.

Anna shrank toward the window. She heard the dull thud of his door closing.

The villa was ablaze with lights.

Sophia Roscente fluttered over like a joyful butterfly. She circled Anna with repeated exclamations. "Sis, you look like a fairy descended from heaven!"

She gestured dramatically, her eyes sparkling.

Adrian walked past with his hands in his pockets. He tossed out a comment. "I picked the dress." His tone held a trace of concealed pride.

Sophia immediately covered her mouth to suppress a giggle. She winked at Anna.

The banquet hall was filled with socialites.

Silk gowns and glittering jewels reflected the light. The ladies' laughter rang out like silver bells.

Anna quietly clenched her fist. Without him, she would have been completely lost.

Cecilia Roscente made her way through the crowd. Her eyes lit up when they landed on Anna. "Anna, you are breathtakingly beautiful tonight."

She warmly linked arms with Anna.

Anna looked up and met an intense gaze.

Adrian stood under the crystal chandelier, swirling his glass. His eyes enveloped her like a net.

Sophia whispered into her mother's ear. Cecilia burst into laughter. "So that's how it is."
###Chapter 329

Anna Ross didn't want them to continue discussing this topic.

She took out the prepared gift.

"Auntie, it was a bit rushed, so I didn't prepare anything expensive."

"I hope you don't mind."

She handed the gift box to Cecilia Roscente.

This exquisite little box was specially chosen by her.

Cecilia exchanged a smile with her daughter.

Joy radiated from her face.

"I'm just happy you thought of me."

The gift box was gently opened.

Surprise flashed in Cecilia's eyes.

This necklace was more unique than others she had received.

It suited her taste perfectly.

She couldn't help but glance at Anna a few more times.

Her fondness for this girl grew stronger.

Seeing the satisfied expression, Anna felt slightly relieved.

"Anna, thank you. I really like it."

Cecilia put away the gift.

She took Sophia Roscente and Anna's hands, leading them inside.

Anna maintained her smile.

She wasn't quite accustomed to such intimate gestures.

She had just taken a drink from Sophia when she heard a delicate female voice.

There was no need to guess—it was Chloe Valentine.

"Adrian~ You're finally here."

Adrian Sinclair slightly frowned.

He had wanted to speak with them for a moment.

But Chloe had already approached.

Anna moved to stand beside Sophia.

She turned her face away to avoid the line of sight.

Chloe deliberately adjusted her one-shoulder gown.

She immediately pressed close to Adrian upon arrival.

Her smile was sweet and charming.

She glanced at Anna beside them.

Jealousy flickered in her eyes.

Anna's outfit was too dazzling.

It almost overshadowed her own presence.

She soon pouted again.

Hugging Adrian's arm, she cooed.

"Adrian, why are you so late?"

"Grandpa and I have been waiting for you forever."

Cecilia cleared her throat lightly.

Sophia quickly interjected.

"Miss Valentine, you're not engaged yet."

"Isn't this a bit inappropriate in public?"

Chloe was momentarily speechless.

She didn't dare say more in front of elders.

She could only awkwardly let go.

Adrian remained expressionless and silent.

But his gaze inadvertently drifted toward the figure in white.

Chloe was burning with jealousy.

Yet she could only force herself to endure it.

Cecilia shook her head slightly.

She had been looking forward to meeting this future niece-in-law.

But today's encounter left her somewhat disappointed.

For some reason, she just couldn't bring herself to like her.

She really didn't know what the old man saw in her.

Just then, the old man walked over.

Chloe acted as if she had seen a lifesaver.

She eagerly went to greet him.

Cecilia also stepped forward to support her father.

She smiled and asked.

"Dad, how are you feeling?"

"Should Sophia accompany you upstairs to rest?"

"No need." The old man chuckled.

"I may be old, but I still want to enjoy the lively atmosphere."

His eyes swept over the mingling crowd.

Adrian turned to look.

When he turned back, the space beside him was empty.

Sophia was pulling Anna around the food area.

She held a plate of small cakes.

She fed a spoonful to Anna.

"Sis, this cake is absolutely amazing."

"Want to try it?"

Anna took a small taste.

A refreshing flavor instantly spread.

Though it was cake, it wasn't cloying at all.

She ate with great relish.

One spoonful after another.

A smile curled at the corners of her mouth.

Adrian absently swirled his red wine.

He watched this scene, unconsciously lost himself in thought.

Chloe saw this.

Her face turned green with anger.

Guests continued to stream into the hall.

Cecilia was busy entertaining everyone.
###Chapter 330

Adrian Sinclair's gaze swept across the room.

His fingers tightened slightly.

His eyes darkened.

Lucas Evans.

Why was he here.

Lucas was speaking with Cecilia Roscente.

"My friend had an urgent matter."

"He asked me to attend on his behalf."

He offered a gift.

His manner was humble.

Cecilia accepted it with a smile.

She guided him inside.

Adrian snorted softly.

So he was just a substitute.

Lucas scanned the room.

His eyes suddenly fixed on one spot.

He walked over quickly.

His voice filled with surprise.

"Anna."

He called out.

Anna Ross turned at the sound.

Lucas caught his breath.

Her appearance tonight was different.

She was breathtakingly beautiful.

Anna set down her cake.

She rose to greet him.

"Lucas."

She gave a slight nod.

"I'm here for a friend."

"It's wonderful to see you."

Lucas's gaze fell on her lips.

He chuckled softly.

He took out a handkerchief and offered it.

Before Anna could react.

Sophia Roscente stepped forward with a tissue.

She gently wiped Anna's mouth.

"Thank you."

Anna gave Lucas an apologetic smile.

Lucas put away his handkerchief.

A flicker of disappointment crossed his eyes.

"It's fine."

Chloe Valentine watched everything.

She leaned close to Grandpa.

She whispered in his ear.

"Grandpa, that's Lucas Evans."

"He and Executive Assistant Ross are quite close."

Grandpa glanced over.

His expression turned displeased.

"As long as she stays away from Adrian."

"Let her be."

Chloe smiled slightly.

She felt pleased.

The event continued.

Lucas remained by Anna's side.

He found topics to discuss even when words failed him.

Sophia watched them closely.

She feared her cousin's fiancée might be stolen.

Adrian felt a surge of irritation.

He thought she would avoid him.

Yet she was engaged in conversation.

He picked up a wine glass.

He prepared to approach.

"Adrian."

Grandpa's voice suddenly rang out.

It carried undeniable authority.

Adrian halted his steps.

His gaze sharpened as it landed on that shadow.

Grandpa began coughing violently.

Adrian's brow furrowed deeply.

He immediately turned back.

"Grandpa."

Chloe's voice trembled.

Her eyes reddened.

Adrian steadied Grandpa's shoulders.

His expression was grave.

Only when the coughing subsided did he relax slightly.

Chloe wiped the corner of her eye.

She spoke softly.

"Adrian."

"Stay by Grandpa's side."

"His health can't handle any more stress..."

Adrian gave her a cool glance.

He remained silent.

Chloe looked into the distance.

A cold smile touched her lips.

After tonight.

Adrian would belong to her alone.
###Chapter 331

Lucas's words pulled Anna back to her university days.

Memories flooded her mind like a rising tide.

Each recollection brought fresh pain.

The ache in her chest deepened with every thought.

"Sis, look over there." Sophia gently touched her arm, pointing toward a crowd. "That looks like my uncle."

Anna followed her gaze.

Howard Lowell stood at the center of the gathering.

Her mother, Vivian, stood beside him.

She pressed her lips together and hurried toward her mother.

Sophia followed closely behind.

She made a face at Lucas as they passed.

She understood perfectly.

This man had designs on her future sister-in-law.

She would never allow it.

Anna approached her mother and called out softly, "Mom."

Vivian turned, surprise flashing in her eyes. "Anna? What are you doing here?"

She didn't recall her daughter knowing Cecilia.

Sophia bounced over with a sweet smile. "Hello, Auntie! Sis is a guest invited by me and my mom."

Vivian paused briefly.

Howard stepped in to explain. "This is Cecilia's daughter."

Cecilia approached gracefully.

Her gaze lingered on Vivian's face.

The mother and daughter did share a striking resemblance.

Anna had inherited all of her mother's beauty.

"This is my sister, Cecilia Roscente." Howard made the introduction.

Vivian nodded politely.

They exchanged brief pleasantries.

Howard gave Vivian a meaningful look.

Understanding, Vivian took Anna aside.

Sophia tried to follow but was gently held back by Cecilia.

Anna handed her mother a glass of juice. They stood together in a quiet corner.

"Mom, did you want to talk to me about something?"

Vivian set down her glass and grasped her daughter's hands tightly.

"Anna, Mom needs to ask you to help your father this time."

Anna froze.

Her mother had never made such a request before.

She held her mother's hands and asked urgently, "Did he hit you again? Or threaten you?"

Vivian shook her head.

"No. Mom just wants our family to live well together. Helping him is helping me."

Anna looked at her mother in disbelief.

Had she forgotten all the past pain?

"Mom..." She frowned, unsure how to respond.

A trace of sorrow flashed in Vivian's eyes.

"Anna, you know Mom hasn't had an easy life. Deceived and abandoned by a man, raising you alone."

"Then finally meeting someone who made my heart flutter, only to be burdened with debt. Now I can finally feel some warmth, and I want to cherish it."

Anna's heart ached sharply.

"Mom, I'll do it." She couldn't bear to see her mother sad and agreed temporarily.

She knew Howard's character too well.

He would never treat her mother sincerely.

For now, she had to stabilize the situation.

Then find an opportunity to take her mother away.

Vivian wiped the tears from her eyes and smiled again.
###Chapter 332

They returned to the main hall.

Anna Ross glanced around, feeling something was missing.

Lucas Evans approached quickly and handed her a glass of juice.

She took the glass, temporarily setting aside her earlier confusion.

Upstairs, in the study.

Grandpa sat upright on the mahogany sofa.

His sharp gaze swept over the two people opposite him.

"Adrian, I called you up here to remind you."

"Chloe is your fiancée."

"You should spend more time with her."

Adrian Sinclair played idly with his jade ring.

He responded indifferently, "I understand, Grandpa."

Grandpa frowned deeply.

He slammed his palm heavily on the armrest of the sofa.

"I've given you so much time."

"Your performance has disappointed me greatly."

Adrian slowly raised his eyes.

Chloe Valentine secretly observed his expression.

The corners of her eyes were slightly red, but she felt a surge of triumph inside.

Grandpa let out a long sigh.

His tone became grave. "I will arrange to meet Chloe's parents as soon as possible."

"Let's settle your engagement first."

"This way, you can also focus your mind."

"Grandpa, I've said I want to focus on my career first."

Adrian's expression was calm, but his tone left no room for argument.

Chloe's perfectly made-up face instantly changed color.

Her fingers tightened abruptly.

With a snap, her meticulously manicured crystal nail broke.

This excuse again!

He always dodged whenever marriage was mentioned.

She could wait before, but she couldn't wait any longer.

She absolutely couldn't let anyone else take him away.

Especially that worthless woman.

Chloe suppressed her anger forcefully.

She put on a sweet smile. "Adrian, it's just an engagement for now."

"It won't affect your work."

"I can even help you manage company affairs."

He needed to solidify his position now.

With the Valentine family's support, he would be unstoppable.

Grandpa nodded approvingly.

This future granddaughter-in-law certainly knew what was important.

Adrian's brow furrowed slightly before quickly smoothing out.

His deep eyes looked at her. "We will get married eventually."

"Why are you in such a hurry, Chloe?"

Chloe's heartbeat suddenly accelerated.

She was mesmerized by his gaze.

For a moment, she forgot what she was going to say next.

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted slightly.

He stood up and walked straight to the door.

His movements were fluid and effortless.

Grandpa shook his head helplessly.

This grandson was too clever.

Sometimes that wasn't a good thing.

......

Downstairs in the banquet hall.

Anna accidentally bumped into a table corner.

A patch of skin was immediately scraped off her calf.

Lucas hurriedly found a Band-Aid.

He considerately knelt down to tend to her wound.

This scene happened to catch the eye of the man coming downstairs.

Adrian's gaze turned cold, and he was about to step forward.

But he was pulled back by Chloe, who had rushed over.

He withdrew his gaze without showing any emotion.

Chloe gripped his arm tightly.

She had almost forgotten what Grandpa had instructed.

She glanced downstairs and bit her lip lightly. "Adrian, I need to talk to you."

Just at that moment.

Anna looked up.

Chloe had a sudden idea and leaned into the man's arms.

From downstairs, they appeared to be intimately embracing.

Anna's fingertips trembled slightly.

Without regard for Lucas still being there, she turned and hurried away.

Lucas put down what he was holding and quickly chased after her.

He looked back but saw nothing.

Yet her reaction clearly indicated she had seen something.

Adrian had already pushed the person in his arms away.

His tone was cold. "Say what you need to say."

"There's no need for this."
###Chapter 333

Chloe Valentine's heart felt pierced by needles.

She was his future wife.

She was the one he should love.

She cast a cold glance downstairs.

Jealousy coiled around her heart like a venomous snake.

A brilliant plan formed in her mind.

"Adrian, I really need to talk to you."

"But I'm afraid you'll be upset if I tell you."

She furrowed her brows slightly, her fingers gently tracing the back of his hand.

Adrian Sinclair suppressed his impatience.

He subtly created distance between them.

His voice was cold. "If there's nothing important, I'm going back downstairs."

Chloe quickly grabbed his arm.

She couldn't miss this opportunity.

She could ruin Anna Ross and keep him by her side.

Adrian turned around.

His icy gaze fell on her hand.

He was in a terrible mood, and everything annoyed him.

Chloe was frightened by his expression.

She immediately released his arm.

"What exactly do you want to say?" Adrian frowned deeply.

His displeasure was written all over his face.

"Grandpa is still upstairs. You should spend more time with him."

Chloe's expression instantly stiffened.

She had no desire to entertain that old man.

If not for the marriage, she wouldn't go near him.

Once married, her first act would be to send him away.

Preferably, make him disappear sooner.

But she couldn't show her true feelings now.

Chloe deliberately glanced downstairs several times.

She pretended to be checking something.

Adrian followed her gaze.

Two familiar figures were leaving one after another.

Lucas Evans's hand almost reached for hers.

A smirk tugged at Chloe's lips.

She quickly concealed it.

"Adrian, please don't be angry when I tell you."

Adrian's breathing grew heavy.

He faced her, his voice low. "Speak."

Chloe felt secretly pleased.

She was already halfway to success.

"I've seen Miss Ross being very intimate with Lucas before."

"She even told her friends that Lucas was worth entrusting her life to."

Chloe paused here.

She lifted her innocent eyes to look at him.

Adrian's expression grew increasingly dark.

His eyes turned icy. He gritted his teeth and asked, "And what else?"

Chloe lowered her head.

She couldn't help but smile triumphantly.

She took out her phone, opened the photo album, and handed it to him.

"While shopping today, I saw her with another man."

"They looked very much in love."

The next second, Adrian snatched the phone from her.

He stared at the photo in disbelief.

A tall man was affectionately ruffling the girl's hair.

Both were laughing happily.

Adrian's eyes instantly reddened.

His fingers tightened, veins bulging.

Under the light, his expression turned ferocious.

Good. Just perfect.

She never wanted to explain why they broke up.

It was because she had already found someone else.

Adrian suddenly let out a scornful laugh.

He felt like a complete joke.

Always orbiting around her.

In her heart, he was probably just an annoying presence.
###Chapter 334

Chloe Valentine secretly rejoiced as her plan succeeded.

But watching him so distraught over someone else, a sour bitterness welled up in her heart.

"Adrian, don't be like this," she soothed softly. "Miss Ross is beautiful and accomplished. It's normal for her to have suitors. I'm genuinely happy she found true love."

Adrian Sinclair's hands gripped the stair railing, his knuckles white.

His handsome face was covered in a frosty chill, a storm of fury swirling in his eyes.

"Shut up!" he suddenly roared, his voice hoarse and terrifying.

The railing creaked under his grip, as if it might snap at any second.

Chloe flinched, her lips trembling, too afraid to make another sound.

Adrian reached for a drink. Seizing the opportunity, Chloe said gently, "Let me help you."

She hurried to the table. While he was looking downstairs, she quickly pulled a small packet of powder from her clutch and shook it into the red wine.

She swirled the glass lightly with her fingertips, and the powder dissolved without a sound.

She picked up both glasses and walked over gracefully, her dress swaying, her figure elegant.

"Have a drink," she said, curving her lips into a soft, charming smile.

Adrian glanced indifferently, took the glass, and clinked it with hers.

But the image of those two embracing flashed repeatedly in his mind, stabbing at his heart.

He only took a sip before putting the glass down and rushing downstairs.

Chloe panicked, lifting her dress to stumble after him.

Her high heels clicked urgently against the floor.

Under the pavilion, Anna Ross was looking up at the moon.

The cold moonlight fell on her shoulders, outlining her slender back, making her appear even more solitary than the moon itself.

Lucas Evans felt a surge of warmth and impulsively embraced her from behind.

The moment his arms wrapped around her waist, she froze completely.

Adrian happened to chase out and witnessed the scene, his steps halting abruptly.

Chloe, unable to stop in time, crashed heavily into his back, pain blinding her vision.

She endured the pain and looked up to see Adrian slowly turn around, tilting his head back to drain the remaining wine in his glass.

His Adam's apple bobbed, the lines of his profile sharp and cold as a blade.

Chloe followed his gaze. Lucas was standing opposite Anna, seemingly whispering to her.

A meaningful smile curved her red lips as she turned to chase after that tall, retreating figure.

With Lucas being such a helpful assist, he had saved her a lot of effort.

A sudden night wind blew outside the pavilion.

Anna broke free from the embrace, anger still flickering in her eyes.

She had never expected the gentle and refined Lucas to be so abrupt, so strange it chilled her heart.

Lucas looked full of remorse, apologizing repeatedly. "Anna, I'm sorry, I just couldn't control my emotions for a moment..."

"Lucas," she interrupted coldly. "I understand your feelings, but I can't reciprocate. I'm not worth your affection. Let's not see each other again."

He stood frozen, his pupils trembling slightly.

"You'll meet someone better," she said, stepping back two paces before turning to leave decisively.

The hem of her dress swept over the stone steps, stirring a few scattered leaves.

Lucas stood alone in place, watching her retreating figure, a bitter smile tugging at his lips.

Inside the hall, the music and revelry continued, the noise grating on his ears.

He turned silently and disappeared into the thick night.

If not for her, this banquet had held no meaning for him from the start.
###Chapter 335

The night was as dark as ink.

Yet the entire city remained brilliantly lit.

As if it would never sleep.

Adrian Sinclair leaned back on the sofa.

Something was churning violently in his chest.

It felt like it was about to burst out.

His entire body was unusually feverish.

He groaned.

Loosened his tie.

Undid the top button of his black shirt.

But the restlessness did not subside at all.

Frowning, Adrian stood up.

He walked straight to the bathroom.

The door was suddenly pushed open.

A figure in white slipped inside.

He leaned against the wall, squinting.

But his vision was completely blurred.

"Adrian, what's wrong?"

A soft hand lightly touched his wrist.

It sent a shiver through him.

A familiar fragrance.

A pure white dress.

Was it her?

Adrian let her support him.

His gaze locked onto her face.

"Weren't you with Lucas Evans?"

His voice was low and hoarse from restraint.

Chloe Valentine secretly bit her lip.

He was still thinking about that woman at a time like this.

But she had deliberately changed into a white dress.

Used the same perfume as Anna Ross.

The drug had already taken effect.

She didn't mind becoming his woman as a substitute.

"Adrian, you've had too much to drink."

She said softly.

Her fingers already reaching for his collar.

Deliberately brushing against his exposed skin.

Adrian closed his eyes, fighting the turmoil inside.

Chloe unbuttoned his shirt one button at a time.

She intentionally breathed warm air onto his chest.

Just as she touched the last button.

A strong, large hand suddenly grabbed hers.

Her face changed instantly.

Had she been discovered?

Adrian leaned down and gripped her waist.

With a slight force, he pressed her into the bed.

Chloe's heart pounded like a drum.

Her cheeks flushed unconsciously.

Yet she still gazed expectantly at the man above her.

This perfect man.

Was finally going to be hers.

She smiled and lifted her head for a kiss.

But the man pressed her down firmly.

He whispered close to her ear.

"Do you think imitating her will make you become her?"

Chloe's pupils constricted violently.

She didn't dare meet his eyes anymore.

How did he see through it?

Was the drug not strong enough?

A long time passed.

The man on top of her showed no further movement.

She cautiously glanced sideways.

Adrian had unknowingly fallen into a deep sleep beside her.

"Adrian?"

Chloe called out softly twice.

Only even breathing answered her.

Furious, she clenched the bedsheet.

She was so close.

Just a little more and she would have succeeded.

Tears slid from the corners of her eyes.

She gently pushed the man away.

Sitting alone by the bed in a daze.

What exactly was wrong with her, Chloe Valentine?

Moreover, she was his fiancée.

Yet he wouldn't even touch her?

Adrian Sinclair.

You are truly heartless.

Can you really not see my sincerity after all this time?

The night breeze gently brushed the window curtains.

The pure white curtains fluttered incessantly.

The next morning.

Sophia Roscente walked out of the room with Cecilia Roscente.

She yawned and complained.

"Mom, sister left way too early last night."

"I looked for her for a long time."

Cecilia chuckled lightly.

"Perhaps she had something urgent."

"Aren't you going to see her today?"

Sophia nodded.

"Yes."

"I've missed her so much."

"These days since returning."
###Chapter 336

Cecilia Roscente shook her head helplessly, her eyes filled with affection.

She took her daughter's hand, preparing to go downstairs.

The hallway was quiet, with only the sound of their footsteps.

Sophia Roscente suddenly stopped, tilting her head to listen.

A faint, familiar sound came from the next room.

She looked at the closed door, her brow slightly furrowed.

"Mom, is someone staying in this room?"

Cecilia also stopped, glancing at the door.

"It should be empty." As soon as she spoke, she heard the noise too.

Mother and daughter exchanged a look. Sophia stepped forward to investigate.

The door was unlocked. It opened with a gentle push.

The moment it opened, she regretted it.

Chloe Valentine frantically grabbed the sheets to cover herself.

Tears welled in her eyes, making her look pitiful.

Adrian Sinclair stood by the bed, his expression darkening instantly.

Cecilia entered the room. Her smile froze immediately.

Chloe hurried to explain, "Auntie, please don't misunderstand..."

"Adrian was drunk last night. Nothing happened between us."

Sophia let out a sharp cry, turned, and ran.

She couldn't accept what she was seeing.

She had always hoped her cousin would end up with Anna Ross.

But now, everything was ruined.

Cecilia gave the bed a cold glance before turning to leave.

The door closed, restoring silence to the room.

Adrian looked at Chloe, his gaze icy.

"What happened last night..."

Chloe tightened the sheets around herself, her voice soft. "Adrian, I was willing."

"I don't blame you." She lowered her head, exposing her slender neck.

The man's eyes darkened. He remained silent for a long time.

"I see," he said flatly.

Chloe bit her lip and looked up, but Adrian was already rising.

He picked up his clothes and walked straight into the bathroom.

A smile touched Chloe's lips.

She gently touched the bruises she had pinched into her own skin.

It hurt, but it was worth it.

。。。。。。。

Anna Ross was almost late, rushing into the company just in time.

Right after clocking in, she ran into Adrian Sinclair.

They both froze.

She hesitated about whether to greet him.

He already walked past her, his face cold.

Anna stood there, stunned, remembering the image of him holding Chloe last night.

She shook her head, refusing to dwell on it.

She turned and walked in the opposite direction.

This was how it should be between them.

After work, she took a taxi directly to the bar.

The bar was especially lively tonight. Everyone's face was lit with smiles.

Except for her. Her heart felt heavy, suffocated by an invisible weight.

In a noisy corner of the bar, Adrian drank one glass after another.

His gaze was locked on the figure on stage.

Perhaps this was fate. Struggling against it was useless.

The table was littered with empty bottles.

Adrian set down the last bottle, clenching his fists.

He took one final look at the stage, then silently stood and left.

Anna couldn't finish her song.

She left the stage early and briefly explained to the boss.

The understanding boss let her leave work ahead of schedule.

Anna walked alone on the street.

She thought about running into Adrian at the company during the day.

He always left without expression, unwilling to say a single word to her.
###Chapter 337

Anna Ross walked for a long time against the night wind.

Only when the cold breeze had dissipated some of the heaviness in her heart did she turn and head toward home.

As soon as she reached the building's entrance, she noticed light seeping through the crack under the door.

She paused mid-step.

A wave of confusion washed over her.

At this hour, no one should be home.

Could it be a burglar?

She dismissed the thought immediately.

What burglar would be so brazen as to turn on the lights?

She pushed the door open gently.

Her heartbeat quickened involuntarily.

The door hinges made a faint creaking sound.

The scene in the living room left her frozen in place.

Sophia Roscente was curled up on the sofa.

Her shoulders trembled slightly.

She clutched a tissue in her hand.

Tear stains still glistened on her cheeks.

Seeing Anna return, she lifted her red, swollen eyes.

Tears began to fall uncontrollably again.

"Sis... you're finally back."

Her voice was thick with congestion, punctuated by sobs.

She looked utterly heartbroken.

Anna quickly set down her bag.

She changed into slippers and walked over to her.

Gently, she wrapped an arm around Sophia's shoulders.

"Sophia."

"What's wrong?"

"Who hurt you?"

She took a tissue and carefully wiped away her tears.

"Whatever it is, you can tell me," she soothed softly.

"Don't keep it bottled up inside."

Sophia buried herself in Anna's embrace.

Tears soaked through Anna's blouse.

"I'm so sorry, sis..." she mumbled, her voice muffled.

Anna was taken aback.

"What happened?" she asked, puzzled.

"Why are you saying that?"

She patted Sophia's back gently, trying to calm her.

"You're always welcome here."

"There's no need to apologize."

Sophia just shook her head.

Her tears fell even harder.

But she refused to say another word.

Anna didn't press further.

She simply stayed with her quietly.

Only when Sophia's sobs gradually subsided did Anna get up to pour a glass of warm water.

Sophia's eyes were swollen like walnuts.

She looked especially pitiful.

Anna sighed.

She went to the bathroom and filled a basin with warm water.

She soaked a towel and gently placed it over Sophia's eyes.

The warm steam soothed her dry, tired skin.

"Sis," Sophia asked softly, "what kind of person do you think my cousin is?"

Anna's movements stilled.

Her gaze drifted toward the window.

The night was deep and starless.

Silence stretched between them.

It lasted so long that Sophia thought she wouldn't get an answer.

Just as she was about to speak again, Anna replied tonelessly, "To me, he's just my boss."

"Nothing more needs to be said."

Sophia bit her lower lip.

Her nails dug deeply into her palms.

A sour ache spread through her chest.

Anna removed the now-cool towel.

She carried the basin into the bathroom.

The sound of running water filled the room.

By the time Anna finished her shower, Sophia had fallen asleep on the sofa.

A teardrop still clung to the corner of her eye.

Anna quietly covered her with a blanket.

She returned to her bedroom alone.

But sleep eluded her as she lay in bed.

She stared at the ceiling.

Her mind was a tangled mess.

She knew she shouldn't feel this way.

Yet she couldn't control her own heart.

......

Early the next morning, Anna was awakened by the chime of her phone.
###Chapter 338

She was a light sleeper.

The slightest sound could wake her.

Anna Ross rubbed her eyes.

She reached under her pillow for her phone.

The screen lit up.

She was instantly wide awake.

Anna got up immediately.

She got ready in record time.

She headed straight to the company.

Upon arrival, she didn't even catch her breath.

She knocked directly on the office door.

A deep voice came from inside.

"Come in."

She pushed the door open.

Adrian Sinclair was bent over some files.

His slender fingers flew across the keyboard.

He didn't even look up at her.

She stood there for a moment.

Finally, she spoke.

"Did you transfer Director Lowell?"

The man behind the desk responded indifferently.

He didn't even lift his eyelids.

Anna's heart tightened.

"Do you know what he'll do after this?"

Adrian finally looked up.

His gaze was distant, as if she were a stranger.

"This is none of your concern."

"Weren't you always hoping he'd come to headquarters?"

He leaned back in his chair.

He crossed his hands on the desk.

Cold.

Distant.

Anna felt her concern was unnecessary.

She forced a bitter smile.

"I see."

"I won't disturb you anymore."

She turned to leave.

A cold voice stopped her.

"Wait."

Steady footsteps approached.

They stopped right behind her.

Anna's back stiffened.

She waited for him to continue.

Adrian's voice was clear and cold.

"You'll work under him from now on."

"There's no need to stay on my team."

Her eyelashes fluttered slightly.

His voice sounded again.

"Also."

"You are no longer my mistress."

"You're free."

"You can be with whoever you like."

Adrian's fingers twitched almost imperceptibly.

His brow furrowed slightly.

Anna was speechless.

She just stood there.

Adrian stared at her slender back.

He clenched his fists, suppressing his turbulent emotions.

He had already done those things.

He didn't deserve to stand by her side anymore.

Besides.

Her heart already belonged to someone else.

Since that was the case.

This time, he would let go completely.

"If there's nothing else."

"Go pack your things."

He finished hoarsely.

He returned to his seat and didn't look at her again.

Anna didn't linger.

She left directly.

As she exited, she nearly collided with Chloe Valentine.

Chloe was beaming as she entered.

They almost bumped into each other.

Chloe gave her a once-over.

She sniffed lightly.

She turned to the man at the desk.

She waved a cake box in her hand.

"Adrian."

"I just bought this cake."

"I brought it especially for you."

As she passed Anna, she deliberately bumped her shoulder hard.

She hummed a cheerful tune under her breath.
###Chapter 339

Anna Ross walked quickly out of the office.

Adrian Sinclair stared at the figure moving outside the door.

He watched for a long time.

So long that Chloe Valentine had already opened the cake and placed it before him.

She called his name several times.

He didn't respond.

Chloe felt a surge of irritation.

She raised her voice. "Adrian, what are you thinking about?"

Adrian snapped back to attention.

He glanced down at the gaudy cake on the desk.

His eyes were cold.

After a long pause.

He turned away.

He said flatly, "I don't like sweets. You have it."

Chloe wanted to say more.

But the man's attention had already returned to his computer.

He was busy working.

He didn't speak to her again.

"Alright, I'll let you work then."

She added unwillingly.

"I'll come find you later."

Adrian didn't respond.

Maybe he didn't hear.

Or maybe he was ignoring her on purpose.

He just stared at the screen.

His fingers tapped across the keyboard.

Chloe suppressed her impatience.

She didn't want to anger him.

She had no choice but to take the cake and leave.

Just outside the office door.

She saw Anna packing her things.

Chloe was in a bad mood.

She needed an outlet for her frustration.

She walked to the trash can.

She threw the cake inside.

Then she approached Anna.

She sneered, "Where are you going, Executive Assistant Ross?"

"Didn't Adrian say he wouldn't let you leave?"

Anna ignored her.

She kept her head down, packing her things.

Finally.

She glanced at the employee ID card in the drawer.

She gently closed the drawer.

Chloe felt like she had punched cotton.

It made her even more upset.

Her eyes shifted.

She leaned against the desk and lowered her voice.

"Executive Assistant Ross, don't go too far."

"Remember to come to our engagement party."

Anna finally looked up.

She stared at Chloe in a daze.

Chloe flashed a victorious smile.

She turned and walked away quickly.

Anna looked toward the closed office door.

A wave of sadness washed over her.

So he was getting married.

No wonder he said those things earlier.

It made sense.

He was always going to marry someone else.

It was just a matter of time.

Hadn't she always known this?

So why did her heart hurt so much?

Anna carried her meager belongings to the HR Department.

Howard Lowell excitedly pulled her into his office.

He looked around the spacious room.

His face beamed with delight.

"Anna, see this?"

"This is where I'll achieve my ambitions step by step."

"I'll turn the entire Lowell Group into mine."

Anna wasn't interested.

She simply said, "Oh."

Howard finally noticed the things in her hands.

A bad feeling rose within him.

He lowered his voice and asked, "Did you get fired?"

Anna shook her head.

She said softly, "Is there anything else you need to say?"

"If not, I'm going to put my things away."

"Wait." Howard stopped her.

He studied her for a moment.

Then he asked, "You're going to work under me now?"

Anna nodded.

Howard took a deep breath.

He walked around her toward the floor-to-ceiling window.

He stared outside for a long time.

Finally, he asked, "Was this Adrian's idea?"

"Does he already know something?"

He seemed to be asking Anna.

But it also sounded like he was talking to himself.
###Chapter 340

Howard Lowell clicked his tongue in disapproval.

He quickly dismissed that thought.

Anna Ross must have done something wrong.

That was why Adrian Sinclair had thrown her out.

Anger flared in his eyes.

He strode over to Anna.

"Did he kick you out?"

Anna's voice was soft.

Softer than a passing breeze.

"Perhaps."

Howard slapped his thigh in frustration.

He glared at her with exasperation.

"You're still useful by his side!"

"How could you just let him throw you out?"

He had to find a way to fix this.

Anna didn't want to explain.

She gathered her things and went to find her workstation.

The moment the end-of-day bell chimed.

Her best friend's call came through.

Anna answered the phone.

Lively noise poured from the other end.

It sounded like a group gathering.

Mia Lawrence's voice chirped through.

"Anna, come join us!"

"It's so much fun over here."

Anna shook her head helplessly.

"I still have work."

"And my shift at the bar later."

"No time for outings."

Mia brushed it off.

"We're still setting up."

"Just come after your performance."

"I have good news for you."

Someone called for Mia in the background.

Before Anna could refuse.

Mia rushed her words.

"Anna, it's settled then!"

"Gotta go now."

"Come straight over."

The call ended.

Anna sighed.

She glanced at the documents on her desk.

She had seen the mysterious man at the bar again today.

He left early after her performance again.

It felt intentional, like he was avoiding her.

Anna checked the time.

Her friend's location pin arrived.

After a moment's hesitation, she hailed a cab.

A cold wind whipped through the air.

She tightened her coat.

The temperature difference between day and night was stark.

As unpredictable as human hearts.

Anna arrived at the destination.

A large crowd had already gathered.

Clearly a company event.

She turned to leave.

A voice called out to her.

"Anna, you made it?"

Anna looked back.

Lucas Evans stood among the crowd.

Smiling at her.

Mia rushed over and grabbed her arm.

"Don't be shy."

"I said I'd bring a friend."

"Everyone's really friendly."

Others chimed in enthusiastically.

"Mia's friend is our friend."

"Make yourself at home."

"Mia, since when do you have such a beautiful friend?"

"You never introduced us."

"Come sit over here."

"We saved you a spot."

Anna was surrounded by their warmth.

She suppressed her urge to leave.

Letting Mia pull her along.

She felt confused.

Why was Lucas here?

Wasn't this a company gathering?

Mia guided her.

"Anna, sit right here."

Her seat was right next to Lucas's.

Anna wanted to move.

But Mia already pressed her down into the chair.
###Chapter 341

Everyone immediately started teasing.

Someone shouted, "Mia Lawrence, why don't you let her sit with us?"

Mia Lawrence shot them a look.

These men could fool around at the office all they wanted.

But acting like this in front of her friends was too much.

It was truly annoying.

"They're friends. What's wrong with sitting together?" She raised an eyebrow at the person beside her.

The others fell silent and focused on their food.

Anna Ross felt awkward.

She had just told him they shouldn't meet again.

Yet here they were, sitting together.

It felt incredibly uncomfortable.

Lucas Evans, however, seemed perfectly at ease.

He picked up some food and placed it in her bowl. "Anna, have something to eat first."

Anna wanted to refuse.

But the food was already in her bowl.

With so many people watching, she couldn't just move it out.

More teasing erupted. "Since when do 'just friends' serve each other food?"
"Tsk tsk, this doesn't seem simple at all!"

Almost everyone present was male.

The noise was overwhelming, and Anna couldn't get a word in.

She stiffly thanked Lucas.

Mia Lawrence yelled, "What's wrong with you all? Can't you even eat quietly?" She turned and smiled at Anna. "Just ignore them."

Anna could only offer a weak smile.

The others, chastised, didn't dare to joke further.

After eating for a while, someone suggested, "It's rare for us to have a dinner like this, and Mr. Evans is here. Let's play a game!"

Someone else immediately agreed. "Sure! What should we play?"

The person who suggested it stood up and walked to the other side.

Everyone waited.

A moment later, he came running back with something.

Anna saw it was a deck of playing cards.

He opened the deck and shuffled it. "Let's play Truth or Dare. The person with the highest card wins and can ask anyone a question."

"Great, I'm ready." Someone rubbed their hands together eagerly.

Anna paused, then shook her head. "You all play. I'll sit this one out."

She wasn't close with these people.

Playing such a game felt too sudden.

The person across from her immediately objected. "We're all having fun together. It'd be boring for you to just sit there. Join us."

"I..." Anna tried to refuse again.
She really didn't like these kinds of games.

Just as she felt cornered, Lucas spoke up. "If she doesn't want to play, don't force her."

Mia Lawrence gave him an appraising look.
Just for that, her impression of him improved.

Lucas was their company's business partner.
Since he had spoken, the teasers couldn't insist further.

Anna felt grateful.
She lowered her head and continued eating.
The others happily started their game.

Mia Lawrence kept drinking, one glass after another.
Soon, she was leaning drunkenly on Anna's shoulder.
Mia hugged her bottle and mumbled, "Anna, liking someone is so painful."

Anna thought about the situation with Julian Garnache.
She put down her fork and knife, wanting to clarify things.
But Mia had already slid off her shoulder.
She was now passed out, snoring on the table.
###Chapter 342

Anna Ross tried to help Mia Lawrence up.

She nearly stumbled from the weight.

Lucas Evans rose and approached.

"Let me help you."

His voice was soft.

Anna didn't refuse.

They said goodbye to the others.

Together, they helped Mia into the car.

Silence filled the vehicle.

Anna gazed out the window.

Lucas glanced at her occasionally.

He knew her mind was elsewhere.

Yet he couldn't control his gaze.

Even if their eyes only met briefly.

A murmur came from the back seat.

Mia smacked her lips and fell asleep again.

Anna turned and met Lucas's eyes.

She quickly looked away.

"Anna."

Lucas tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

"I heard you transferred departments?"

Anna's fingers tensed.

"How did you know?"

"A friend works at Lowell Corp."

His tone was calm.

"We happened to discuss it."

"Yes. I'm in HR now."

Her response was flat.

The transfer was already decided.

She only cared about earning money.

Previously trapped near Adrian Sinclair.

Now she felt more at ease.

But that faint bitterness in her heart.

Even she couldn't explain it.

"Then... does he still trouble you?"

Lucas's voice tightened.

Anna shook her head.

Adrian had already let go.

There were no more threats.

Light sparked in Lucas's eyes.

But a trace of doubt remained.

The car stopped at the community entrance.

Anna moved to help Mia alone.

But Lucas was already out and circling the car.

"You can't manage alone."

He reached out to support Mia.

Anna had no choice but to assist.

Under the shadow of a streetlight.

A black Maybach sat silently parked.

Adrian Sinclair's knuckles were white.

His gaze was cold as night.

She finally got what she wanted.

But he had lost even the right to approach.

The cigarette tip glowed briefly.

The engine hummed low.

The car drove away quietly.

Early the next morning.

Anna had just sat down.

Howard Lowell rushed over.

His sharp eyes signaled.

He wanted her to follow him into the office.

Anna didn't want to move.

But she knew he wouldn't give up.
###Chapter 343

Anna Ross followed Howard Lowell into the office.

Howard sighed heavily.
He picked up the teacup from his desk and gulped down several mouthfuls.
He remained silent the entire time.

Anna grew restless waiting.
“What did you want to see me about?” she finally asked.

“You have the nerve to ask?” Howard slammed the cup onto the desk.
He turned and glared at her, his finger nearly jabbing her face.

His furious expression startled her.
She couldn't understand what she had done to anger him.

Howard continued to rage.
“My people say Adrian Sinclair has been getting very close to Miss Valentine recently.”
“What exactly have you accomplished with the task I gave you?”

He had thought his plan was progressing smoothly.
This sudden development caught him completely off guard.

Anna lowered her gaze.
So it was about this.

“This has nothing to do with me,” she said coldly, as if it were someone else's problem.

Howard trembled with anger.
He pointed at her and roared, “What kind of attitude is that?”
“Have you forgotten your mother is still in my hands?”
“Do you not care about her anymore?”

“You!” Anna was speechless with fury, but powerless to refute him.
“I'm not his Executive Assistant anymore.”
“There's nothing I can do even if I wanted to.”

She didn't notice the faint trace of resentment in her own voice.

Howard flew into a rage.
He slammed his hand on the desk.
“Useless!”
“You can't even handle such a simple thing.”
“What a waste of that pretty face!”

“Uncle, what did you say?”

Adrian Sinclair pushed the door open and walked in.
Howard's face instantly paled.
He realized he had forgotten to close the door earlier.

“This...” Had everything he just said been overheard?

Damn it.
If all those words were heard, this kid would definitely be on guard against him from now on.

Seeing Adrian enter, Anna immediately fell silent.
She retreated to a corner, standing with her head bowed.

Adrian's peripheral vision caught her slender figure.
A strange emotion stirred in his heart.

He turned to Howard, his tone neutral.
“I came to ask if you've adjusted to the work here, Uncle.”
“Are you satisfied with it?”

Howard's heart tightened.
He hesitated before answering.
“It's very good.”
“I quite enjoy my current work.”
“You've been very thoughtful, Adrian.”

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted slightly.
He clasped his hands behind his back and walked to the window.
Sunlight streamed through the glass, illuminating Anna's calm profile.
He found himself momentarily captivated.

Cold sweat broke out on Howard's forehead.
Adrian just stood there, not speaking or moving.
Had he discovered something?

Anna couldn't stand it any longer.
She found an excuse to leave.
“I'll let you two talk.”
“I should get back to work.”
She glanced at the figure by the window and quietly exited the office.

Back at her desk, she stared blankly at a pile of枯燥 data.
Lately, her mind wandered easily.
She felt an emptiness in her heart.

The office door opened.
Adrian walked out.
His peripheral vision caught that familiar figure.
His steps faltered slightly.
###Chapter 344

Normally, he would have strode forward briskly.

But now, his steps were heavy.

Each step felt like trudging through mud.

Anna Ross remained unaware of the gaze from afar.

When she looked up, Adrian Sinclair's figure had already vanished.

After work, Anna headed to the bar as usual.

She had just entered when the owner pulled her into a corner.

Anna looked somewhat bewildered.

The owner glanced toward the booth area.

She lowered her voice. "Anna, you've worked here for so long. How have I treated you?"

Anna paused for a moment.

She answered sincerely. "Pamela, you've always taken good care of me. I like it here too."

Upon hearing this, the owner breathed a sigh of relief.

She patted her chest.

"Pamela, is someone looking for me again?" Anna recalled the incident with Julian Garnache.

The owner sighed. "That mysterious guest is here again. He specifically asked to see you."

"This time, he didn't cover his face. He seems like a big shot."

Anna followed her gaze.

A man in a tailored suit sat in the booth.

His profile looked somewhat familiar.

It was only when she got closer that she recognized him as Leon Castillo.

A former business partner of the Lowell Corporation.

Leon stood up with a smile.

He greeted her like a gentleman. "Miss Ross, it's been a long time."

Anna responded politely.

But her mind was full of questions.

"Please, have a seat, Miss Ross." Leon offered her a drink.

Anna accepted it with thanks.

But she did not drink.

"Mr. Castillo, is there something you need?" she asked directly.

Aside from their meeting at the company, they had no other connection.

Leon smiled.

He took a sip of his drink before speaking. "I admire you, Miss Ross."

Anna's expression shifted slightly.

Leon quickly explained. "Don't misunderstand. I admire your talent."

"I come to this bar often. Your singing truly moves me."

He looked toward the stage.

He continued. "This stage is too small."

"With your ability, you deserve a much bigger platform."

Anna took a small sip of her drink.

Her gaze fell on the noisy stage.

"Who can predict the future?" she said softly.

"Perhaps stepping onto a big stage would only lead to disappointment."

Leon's smile faltered slightly.

After a moment of silence, he spoke earnestly. "True talent will always shine."

"You already radiate brilliance. Don't you want to soar even higher?"
###Chapter 345

Anna Ross was caught off guard by his sudden enthusiasm.

They had only met once before.

His words felt strangely abrupt.

Leon Castillo took a sip of his drink.

He rested his hands casually on his knees.

"Don't be surprised, Miss Ross." His tone remained calm. "I know we only met once at the Lowell Corporation conference room."

Anna looked down and sipped her drink.

Her fingers absently traced the rim of her glass.

Howard Lowell reached into his suit jacket.

He produced a refined business card.

"This is my card." His voice was steady. "Besides being president of Lowell Group, I also run an entertainment company."

He gently slid the card toward her.

Anna glanced down at it.

SJ Entertainment.

Specializing in singer development.

Their newcomers had been gaining significant attention lately.

Leon studied her expression.

"What are your thoughts, Miss Ross?" He asked directly. "I'm interested in signing you. It depends on your decision."

Anna fell silent.

A childhood dream suddenly felt within reach.

Memories of past competition failures surfaced.

The opportunity was right here.

Yet she hesitated.

After a long pause.

She looked up with an apologetic smile.

"I'm sorry." Her voice was soft but firm. "I'm not considering signing with any company. Thank you for your offer."

She slowly pushed the card back.

Leon was visibly surprised.

SJ was usually highly sought after.

Being rejected outright was unexpected.

"Won't you reconsider, Miss Ross?" He tried to persuade her. "This is truly a rare opportunity."

With her talent, some polishing would make her shine brightly.

Anna shook her head gently.

"I might not adapt well to that lifestyle." She said calmly. "So I've never considered it."

Over the years, her passion had faded.

Her current life felt secure.

Besides, she didn't plan to stay here long.

Leon's eyes showed regret.

He didn't push further.

"What a pity." He sighed. "But the offer remains open for you."

He pushed the card toward her again.

This time, Anna didn't refuse.

She carefully placed it in her bag.

After Leon left, the bar owner hurried over.

She glanced toward the door and lowered her voice.

"What did he say to you?"

Anna smiled slightly.

"He wanted to sign me to his company."

The owner immediately looked concerned.

"What did you tell him?"

Anna finished her drink.

"I'll always stay here." Her tone was resolute. "Don't worry, Pamela."

Pamela breathed a sigh of relief.

As Anna prepared to go on stage, her phone rang.

Mia Lawrence's name flashed on the screen.

She stepped outside to take the call.

Mia's voice sounded muffled.

"Anna, I'm sorry about that night. I had too much to drink."

Anna suddenly remembered something important.

"Mia, actually Julian—" She explained urgently. "The girl we saw that night was his sister."

Mia had been upset about this for so long.

It was all a huge misunderstanding.
###Chapter 346

The phone line was eerily silent.

Anna Ross called out softly, "Mia? Are you still there?"

Had the shock been too much for her friend?

"Ahhh—I'm done for! Completely done!"

A sharp scream suddenly exploded through the speaker.

Anna's eardrums stung. She quickly pulled the phone away from her ear.

Mia Lawrence was hopping with anxiety.

She grabbed her phone in regret.

The screen lit up.

Julian Garnache's chat window was filled with unread messages.

Her tears streamed down instantly.

"Anna, I'm totally finished, wuwuwu…" Mia's voice came through, choked with sobs.

Anna's heart tightened. "What exactly happened? Don't panic, explain slowly."

Mia sniffled. "Julian sent me so many messages. I didn't reply to a single one… He must be furious now."

If only she had known that girl was just his cousin. She would never have given him the silent treatment out of spite.

Anna was about to speak.

Mia suddenly cut her off. "No! I have to go find him and explain right now!"

The call ended abruptly.

Anna looked at the darkened screen and shook her head helplessly.

Her friend was always so impulsive. It was truly worrying.

Anna pushed open her apartment door.

Sophia Roscente was busy organizing her belongings.

Seeing Anna return, she called out while holding a stack of books, "You're back, sis?"

Anna acknowledged and set down her bag. "Are you moving out?"

Sophia carried the books into her room and came over with a smile. "Just packing my luggage early. I have to go back to school soon."

"So soon?" Anna was surprised.

Sophia nodded, flipping through her textbook. "There's actually still some time, but I'm afraid I'll be too busy having fun to pack later."

She hadn't brought much luggage when she arrived, but she had bought quite a few books.

A tinge of reluctance stirred in Anna's heart.

Sophia noticed her mood. Her sister had seemed unhappy lately. Was it because of her cousin?

"Don't worry, sis. Even when I'm at school, I'll come back to stay often." Sophia took her hand, giving a sincere promise.

Anna smiled. "Okay, you're always welcome."

They chatted for a few more minutes before Anna went to wash up.

Work had been relatively light recently.

Anna found things manageable under Howard Lowell.

But her colleagues often asked for her help.

Sure enough, the colleague beside her asked her to help retrieve some materials.

They went to the supply room.

After the person in charge finished counting the items, Anna was about to carry things away when she was stopped.

"Could you please deliver this document to the Creative Department for me?"

A stack of papers was shoved into her hands. Before she could answer, the person clutched their stomach and rushed toward the restroom.

Anna had no choice but to put down the items and head to the Creative Department.

Just as she reached the doorway, she overheard passing employees discussing something.

Her steps halted.
###Chapter 347
Two women stood whispering in the break room.
One lowered her voice mysteriously.
"Did you hear? Mr. Sinclair and Director Valentine are getting engaged."

The other woman covered her mouth in surprise.
"When did this happen? I had no idea."

"It should be soon. That's what I heard."
"They've kept it so quiet. I never noticed anything at work."

Her companion immediately countered.
"Didn't she get promoted so quickly because of that?"
"Remember when her proposal had errors? No consequences..."

"Shh, be careful. Someone might hear."

......

Anna Ross’s footsteps suddenly halted.
Her legs felt like lead weights.
Slowly, she pressed a hand against her chest.
A sharp pain pierced through her.

He was truly getting engaged.
It shouldn’t concern her.
Yet why did her heart ache so much?

Chloe Valentine approached from the other end of the hallway.
She paused briefly upon seeing Anna.
Then, she offered a triumphant smile.
Gracefully, she walked up to her.

"Executive Assistant Ross, can I help you?" Her tone was light.
Unmistakable joy radiated from her face.

Anna forced a thin smile.
She handed over the documents she carried.
"Just delivering these files."

Chloe took the papers.
Her fingertips brushed lightly over the pages.
As Anna turned to leave,
Chloe gently caught her sleeve.

"Executive Assistant Ross, I almost forgot to mention."
"Adrian and I are getting engaged."
"You must attend the celebration."

Anna’s body trembled faintly.
Though rumors had reached her,
hearing it directly
stabbed her heart with fresh pain.

She clenched her fingers.
Struggling to maintain her smile,
she whispered, "Of course."

Chloe watched her strained expression with satisfaction.
Leaning close, she murmured in Anna’s ear,
"Every part of me belongs to him now."
"You should stay away."

Anna froze as if struck by lightning.
For a moment, she stood paralyzed.
So this was why he’d been so distant.

With immense effort, she curved her lips.
"Congratulations to you both."
As she turned, tears blurred her vision.
She refused to wipe them away.

After all these years,
he was always meant for someone else.
This was inevitable...

Head down, Anna hurried forward—
and collided with a solid chest.
As she looked up,
a single tear escaped down her cheek.

Adrian Sinclair looked down at her.
His sharp gaze caught the tear’s trail.
His expression tightened instantly.

"Forgive me," she murmured, stepping back.
She tried to slip past, but he held her arm.

Pale-faced, she turned away.
Adrian’s eyes flickered toward Chloe.
His voice deepened. "What’s wrong?"

Chloe gritted her teeth silently.
She rushed forward, linking her arm through his.
"Adrian, what brings you here?"

###Chapter 348

He did not respond to her.

His gaze remained fixed on someone else.

The person she was clinging to so tightly.

The person who drove her insane with jealousy.

Countless eyes turned toward them.

Whispers began to circulate.

Some pointed fingers in her direction.

Anna Ross's cheeks burned.

She pulled her hand back forcefully.

"I'm fine," she murmured. "I should get back to work."

She turned and walked away.

Her steps quickened.

Soon, she was nearly running to escape the scene.

As if a bottomless abyss yawned behind her.

Adrian Sinclair withdrew his gaze.

He turned a cold stare toward the person beside him.

Chloe Valentine's heart skipped a beat.

She instinctively released his arm.

His eyes held clear anger.

Her chest heaved with emotion.

"Adrian," she demanded, her voice trembling. "Do you doubt me?"

He let out a cold scoff.

Shaking off her hand, he walked away without another word.

Chloe suddenly laughed.

The sound was bitter and hollow.

She had gone to such extremes.

Yet in his heart, she still couldn't compare to Anna Ross.

It seemed waiting was no longer an option.

......

Anna arrived at the rooftop.

She was surprised to find Noah Watson there as well.

"Executive Assistant Ross," he greeted with a smile. "What a coincidence."

The wind tugged at their clothes.

Anna walked to the railing.

The cool breeze made her eyes feel dry.

Noah offered her a drink.

"Here," he said.

She accepted it quietly. "Thank you."

"What brings you up here, Assistant Watson?"

Noah sighed.

"Just needed some air. Things have been hectic lately."

Anna sipped her drink in silence.

Her own mind had been troubled recently.

Now she finally understood why.

Yet she felt utterly superfluous.

Noah studied her carefully.

His brow suddenly furrowed.

"Executive Assistant Ross," he said slowly. "I feel like I've seen you somewhere before."

"Aren't we colleagues?" Anna found it amusing.

"No, that's not what I mean." He looked at her intently. "You seemed familiar from our first meeting."

Anna shook her head.

"You must be mistaken." She had been living in San Francisco before this.

Noah suddenly snapped his fingers.

"I remember now!" he exclaimed.

"I saw your photo in Mr. Sinclair's office!"

Anna froze.

She said nothing.

Noah continued.

"That photo was taken on a rooftop too."

"The person in it was smiling brightly."

"Quite different from how you look now."

He had often seen his boss staring at that photo.

But it was always quickly put away.

After a moment of silence, Anna spoke softly.

"It must be Miss Valentine, right?"

"They're getting engaged soon."

Noah shook his head firmly.

"I'm certain it wasn't Miss Valentine."
###Chapter 349

Anna Ross leaned against the railing, her gaze sweeping over the bustling crowd below.

"A man like him must never lack for admirers."

Noah Watson turned and leaned back against the railing, shaking his head.
"Don't be fooled by Mr. Sinclair's commanding presence now. When he first joined the company, no one respected him."
He pointed downward.
"Everyone said he was parachuted in thanks to the Chairman's connections. Some even tried to force him out together."

Anna stiffened slightly, her fingers tightening unconsciously.

Noah continued, "Later, he went abroad alone and secured that nearly impossible deal. Only then did the old guard finally fall silent."
"After that, he steadily strengthened the business. No one dared say another word against him."

Anna looked down.
That sounded exactly like him—crushing all doubts with undeniable results.

Her phone suddenly vibrated in the distance.
Seeing the name on the screen, she nearly dropped it.

Noah glanced over. "Is something wrong?"

She shook her head. "It's nothing. I need to take this."

The ringing persisted stubbornly, as if it would never end.

She walked a few steps away, lowering her voice. "What is it?"

Adrian Sinclair's voice came through the receiver, laced with fatigue. "Where are you?"

The sound hit her eardrums, and a sudden ache tightened her chest.
"Handling personal matters. Does Mr. Sinclair need to oversee that too?"

Even she could hear the sharpness in her own words.

Adrian rubbed his temples. "Bring me some documents."
His computer screen glowed as he added, "The files for the new hires. I need them now."

Anna gripped her phone, finally yielding. "Understood."

His voice pressed. "Did you hear me?"

She gave a quiet affirmation, hanging up before hurriedly saying goodbye to Noah.

In front of the HR Department filing cabinets, she quickly assembled a thick stack of documents.
The printer hummed, the pages still warm to the touch.

From the second floor to the fourth, the elevator's ascent made her dizzy.
There was a time when she had run this route countless times a day.

Before she could knock, a voice from inside called, "Come in."

Pushing the door open, she found Adrian resting on the sofa with his eyes closed.
Hearing the movement, he slowly opened them.

Anna avoided his gaze, placing the documents on the edge of his desk.
She turned to leave.

"Wait." His voice was calm but firm.

She halted, her knuckles turning white.
"What else do you require, Mr. Sinclair?"
###Chapter 350

Adrian Sinclair's eyes turned cold.

He stood and closed the distance behind her, his voice low. "Are you adjusting well to working downstairs?"

Anna Ross's heart jumped. Her fingers curled slightly. "It's fine. It's more relaxed than upstairs. No need for your concern, Mr. Sinclair."

Adrian's fist clenched. His gaze locked onto her stubborn back as if trying to see right through her.

The air grew still for a moment. Anna turned to leave.

"Are you with Lucas Evans?" The words burst out. He immediately pressed his lips together in annoyance.

Anna frowned, finding him utterly unreasonable.

She turned back coldly, meeting his eyes. "Who I'm with is none of your business. You, however, Mr. Sinclair, are reportedly about to get engaged. Perhaps you should spend more time with your fiancée and less time concerning yourself with trivial matters."

"Who said that?"

Rage flashed in Adrian's eyes. He grabbed her wrist. "Who told you I'm getting engaged? And how do you explain you and Lucas!"

Anna winced in pain and struggled, but his grip only tightened. They stood in a silent standoff, neither willing to yield.

A sharp pain shot through her wrist. Anna finally raised her voice. "Are you insane? Do I need to report my relationships to you?"

A dark shadow crossed Adrian's gaze. He suddenly cupped her face and kissed her fiercely.

How dare she say it was none of his business? Every time he saw her with someone else, it felt like his heart was being crushed.

Right now, he didn't want to think. He just wanted to devour this disobedient prey.

Anna's eyes widened in shock. She pushed against him with all her strength, but it was useless.

Her heartbeat spiraled out of control. A strange thrill washed over her, threatening to consume her.

His hair brushed against her cheek, the faint tickle a ghost of the past. But everything had changed.

Footsteps echoed faintly outside the door. Anna mustered all her force and shoved him away.

Adrian stumbled back two steps, his breathing ragged.

Anna scrubbed at her lips, her eyes reddening. "What was that? You have someone else. Why are you still bothering me?"

A slight tremble hid in her voice.

Adrian froze, regret flickering in his eyes. He opened his mouth but remained silent.

"A man in your position can have any woman he wants, Mr. Sinclair. Please treat your fiancée well. Stop纠缠 with me."

Anna wiped the corner of her mouth. She pulled the door open and left without looking back. Someone happened to be passing by outside.

Adrian stood alone in the room. The setting sun stretched his shadow long and solitary.
###Chapter 351

Howard Lowell saw Anna Ross standing at the door.
He immediately rushed forward and grabbed her arm.

"Anna, hurry to the hospital."

His voice was urgent, but his eyes drifted behind her.

Anna's heart tightened.
"The hospital? Who's at the hospital?"

"Your mother had an accident. She's at New York-Presbyterian Hospital." Howard lowered his voice, his fingers tightening slightly.

Anna's face instantly turned pale.

She pushed Howard away and ran toward the elevator without looking back.

Her phone vibrated in her palm, but she didn't bother to call a car.

Her high heels clicked against the floor in a chaotic rhythm.

Tears blurred her vision.

She raised a hand to wipe them away, but her steps suddenly faltered.

Her toe hit an obstacle, and she lost her balance.

Anna gasped as she pitched forward.

Her hands flailed in the air, grasping at nothing.

The ground rushed toward her.

She closed her eyes, waiting for the impact.

A pair of hands caught her steadily.

Adrian Sinclair pulled her back into his arms, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Not watching where you're going?"

Anna broke free from his embrace and offered a hurried thanks.

She tried to run again, but he caught her wrist.

"Let me go!" Her voice trembled with urgency. "My mom is at the hospital. I have to go now!"

Adrian silently pulled her toward the private elevator.

Anna struggled, her heels scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.

"I said I don't need your help!"

The elevator doors closed.

Adrian pressed the button for the lower level.

"I'll drive you."

Three words, leaving no room for refusal.

Anna froze.

She looked at his tense profile in the elevator mirror and suddenly fell silent.

Ding—

The elevator reached the underground garage.

Adrian led her toward a black sports car.

He practically shoved Anna into the passenger seat.

The door slammed shut.

She bit her lip and glared at him.

Adrian started the engine, and the car roared out of the garage.

The scenery outside the window flew past in a blur.

Anna gripped the seatbelt, her knuckles turning white.

The hospital sign came into view.

As soon as the car stopped, she reached for the seatbelt release.

Adrian placed his hand over hers.

"Don't panic."

His voice was low, carrying a strangely calming power.

Anna paused.

The sports car came to a smooth stop at the emergency entrance.
###Chapter 352

He drove at an extreme speed.

Her stomach churned violently.

That sharp turn moments ago.

She nearly vomited in the car.

She pressed a hand to her chest.

She shot him a displeased glare.

He acted as if he didn't see it.

Anna Ross couldn't be bothered to argue.

The moment the car stopped, she rushed into the hospital.

At the information desk.

Her voice was urgent.

"Which room is Vivian Lowell in, please?"

The nurse looked down to check.

"Please wait a moment."

Anna anxiously scanned the area.

People hurried through the corridors.

Emergency forms exchanged hands.

Pale faces were everywhere.

Hospitals were always like this.

Oppressively suffocating.

A crisp, clean scent suddenly drew near.

A tall figure stopped beside her.

She knew who it was without turning around.

She frowned at him.

"What are you doing here?"

Adrian Sinclair turned his face.

His thin lips parted.

"Visiting my aunt."

"Is there a problem?"

She was momentarily speechless.

Unable to refute him.

The nurse looked up.

"Vivian Lowell is in Room 306."

Anna turned and walked away immediately.

Adrian followed silently behind.

The moment they left.

The information desk erupted.

The nurse who had been looking down clutched her face excitedly.

"Oh my god, he's so handsome."

"Totally my ideal type."

Another nurse stood up to look.

"A high-quality man like that."

"Why isn't he mine?"

The nurse checking the records smiled.

"Stop dreaming."

"Didn't you see he was with his girlfriend?"

"They're so beautiful and well-matched."

"It's beyond our envy."

Everyone deflated instantly.

"Yeah."

"Better to focus on work. That's reality."

The elevator doors opened.

Anna pressed the button for the third floor.

Adrian quickly stepped in.

Afraid of being shut out.

His hurried manner.

Amused her.

Since he said he was visiting his aunt.

She said nothing more.

The elevator stopped on other floors.

People continuously poured in.

The small space quickly became overcrowded.

Anna shrank into the corner.

But the gap was immediately filled.

Her slender frame was squeezed uncomfortably.

The medicinal smell from patients.

Made her dizzy.

Thinking they would arrive soon.

She gritted her teeth and endured it.

The person beside her suddenly turned.

His arm braced against the wall near her shoulder.

Enveloping her in his embrace.

His presence surrounded her.

No one could get close anymore.

Before she could react.

There was a sudden push from the front.

Adrian lurched forward unexpectedly.

His entire body pressed against hers.
###Chapter 353

Anna Ross looked up and met his deep gaze.

Her heart skipped a beat.

She quickly averted her eyes.

The small space he created suddenly felt oppressive.

Anna instinctively moved backward.

Her back pressed against the cold wall.

Adrian Sinclair's crisp scent enveloped her completely.

She kept her eyes down, not daring to move.

The elevator only went to the third floor.

Yet the ride felt unbearably long and suffocating.

His warm breath was so close.

Anna's cheeks and ears burned with heat.

What flustered her more was his intense gaze fixed on the top of her head.

It felt as if he was about to set her entire being on fire.

Ding—

The elevator doors finally opened.

Anna felt like she had been granted a reprieve and stepped forward.

A hurried passerby suddenly rushed out from the side.

She nearly stumbled.

Adrian frowned and quickly reached out to steady her.

But she didn't seem to notice.

Adrian silently withdrew his hand.

He waited for the crowd to disperse before walking out slowly.

Anna had already rushed toward the hospital room.

She pushed the door open and saw her mother's pale face.

She hurried to the bedside.

Vivian Lowell looked up at the sound.

Seeing her daughter, she was momentarily stunned.

She tried to sit up, supporting herself.

Anna quickly pressed her mother down.

She whispered softly, "Don't get up. Just lie down and rest."

Vivian's gaze shifted.

She looked toward Adrian, who had followed them in.

Her eyes no longer held the resistance they once had.

Since Howard Lowell's words last time, many of her inner conflicts had resolved.

"Adrian, you're here," she greeted him主动.

Adrian nodded slightly.

He quietly took a seat nearby.

Anna kept her head down the entire time.

It was as if he didn't exist at all.

Her eyes reddened as she looked at her mother's weary appearance.

Her voice was choked with emotion. "Mom, how did you get so sick? What exactly happened?"

Had she been too focused on work and neglected her mother's health?

Guilt and sadness washed over her.

It almost overwhelmed her.

Vivian smiled gently. "It's just a hypertension-induced fainting spell. It's nothing serious. Don't worry."

She raised her hand that wasn't receiving IV fluids.

She gently stroked her daughter's cheek.

Anna leaned into her mother's palm affectionately.

After the accident occurred in the family, she hadn't felt such warmth in a long time.

Those carefree days felt like a lifetime ago.

"Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't take good care of you. I didn't even know you were sick," she said, her voice hoarse.

Her eyes grew hot.

Her only wish now was to repay the debts as soon as possible.

To take her mother far away from all this.

To stay together forever.

Just as Vivian was about to speak, Adrian suddenly stood up and left.

She watched the closed door thoughtfully.

The room fell quiet.

Vivian asked softly, "Anna, are you two together?"

Anna was stunned.

She shook her head vigorously. "No, Mom. He and Miss Valentine are about to get engaged. They…"

The words "they've already been intimate" stuck in her throat.

It hurt too much to say.
###Chapter 354

Anna Ross set down the water glass gently.
Her fingertips trembled slightly.

"There is nothing between us."
"I will handle things with Father."
Her voice was soft, yet each word was clear.

These words should have been spoken long ago.
But now they felt heavy as lead.

What was wrong with her?
She shouldn't be having these emotional fluctuations.

Anna rubbed her temples.
Perhaps she was just too tired lately.
Her thoughts were a mess.

She needed some quiet time to herself.

The hospital room fell into silence.

Vivian Lowell should have felt relieved.
Instead, an inexplicable weight settled in her heart.

She had actually hoped her daughter could help her husband.
She had opposed her daughter's relationship with Adrian Sinclair because of that forbidden connection.

But now...

"Anna, what exactly is going on?"
She was referring to Adrian's engagement with Chloe Valentine.
It hadn't been like this before.

Anna smiled faintly.
"They were always going to get engaged."

She suddenly realized something.
She looked up at her mother.
"Mom, you weren't like this before."

Vivian was momentarily speechless.
Her eyes darted away.

"I was just asking casually."
"Nothing more."

Anna didn't press further.
She picked up the fruit knife and began peeling an apple.

The hospital door opened again.

Adrian walked in carrying food containers.
The aroma of the meal instantly filled the room.

"Time to eat."
"It's dinner time."
He efficiently set up the small table.
He arranged the food containers one by one.

Anna silently adjusted the hospital bed to a higher position.

"Thank you, dear."
Vivian's voice was weak.
Her face remained pale.

Adrian's lips curved slightly.
He handed another meal to Anna.

She hesitated for a moment.
Then she accepted it.

The food was plentiful.
Even in containers, the fragrance was undeniable.

Vivian watched her daughter eat hungrily.
She couldn't help but chuckle softly.
"You silly child."
"Did you even ask if your cousin has eaten?"

The word "cousin" almost made Anna choke.
What kind of cousins were they?

Memories of the past flooded her mind.
The tips of her ears grew warm.

Vivian turned to Adrian.
"Dear, why don't you join us?"

Adrian's gaze remained fixed on Anna.
He finally turned his head slightly.
"I've already eaten."
"Please, go ahead."

Anna served her mother some food.
She finished her meal quickly.
Then she stood up to fetch water.

Vivian sighed softly.
She continued eating in silence.

"You've seen what you came to see, Mr. Sinclair."
"Can you leave now?"
Anna handed the water glass to him.
Her eyes only met his for a fleeting moment.
###Chapter 355

Adrian Sinclair’s fingers tightened, his knuckles turning white.

His jaw was clenched tight.

She had somehow heard about his engagement.

Ever since then.

She looked at him as if he were something filthy.

Avoiding him.

Refusing to even glance his way.

"Anna!" Vivian Lowell’s voice rose.

She had never seen her daughter act so rudely.

Usually so gentle.

How could she ask someone to leave?

Anna Ross lowered her gaze.

Silent.

The hospital room suddenly fell quiet.

Footsteps echoed杂乱ly in the hallway.

Doctors and family members spoke in hushed tones.

Busyness filled every corner.

Adrian’s eyes lingered on her for a moment.

He finally spoke calmly.

"Get some rest."

"I’ll take my leave."

He gave a slight nod to Vivian.

Just as he turned to go.

His phone vibrated.

The screen lit up.

The caller ID flashed before his eyes.

He frowned.

It was Grandpa.

The entire Lowell family was at the manor today.

This call.

Was most likely at their urging.

Adrian glanced to the side.

He didn’t answer.

Holding his phone, he walked out.

As the door closed.

Anna caught a faint word.

"Engagement."

So.

They were getting engaged.

She forced a smile.

It felt bitter.

She placed the peeled apple on a plate.

Then stood to wash her hands.

The water ran loudly.

A doctor entered for rounds.

Anna turned off the water.

Quietly stood by the wall.

The results were fine.

Just needed more care.

Her worried heart finally settled.

After seeing the doctor out.

She cleared the meal containers.

Brought a small stool to sit by the bed.

"Anna," Vivian said softly.

"Go back to work."

"I’ll be fine here."

She didn’t want to hold her daughter back.

She knew how hard Anna worked.

And as her mother.

She could give nothing.

Unless Howard Lowell kept his word.

There might be hope for the future.

Anna shook her head.

"I took time off."

"I’ll stay with you."

Vivian didn’t press further.

Leaning back into her pillow.

The door opened again.

Howard Lowell entered with a food bag.

"Brought some food."

"Haven’t eaten, have you?"

"We already did," Vivian answered.

"Adrian just brought some."

Howard raised an eyebrow.

Not surprised.

He placed the bag on the table.

His eyes turned to Anna.

Barely glancing at the patient.

"Anna."

"Step outside."

"Need to talk to you."

Anna didn’t look back.

Suppressing her impatience.

"Can’t you say it here?"

It was always threats.

Forcing her to do things.

She didn’t want to hear it.

Even less to comply.

Howard’s face darkened.

His gaze shifted to the hospital bed.

Fixing on Vivian.
###Chapter 356

Vivian immediately understood.

She gently patted her daughter's hand.

She spoke softly. "Anna, your father says he has something important to discuss with you."

"Please go out and hear what he has to say."

Anna's expression shifted slightly.

Her mother seemed unusually compliant with Howard lately.

Was it because of that vague promise of "warmth"?

She could ignore anyone else's demands.

But she could never go against her mother's wishes.

To avoid worrying her mother, she nodded in agreement.

"Alright. I'll be back soon."

Under her mother's concerned gaze, she stood and walked toward Howard.

She followed him out of the hospital room.

The hallway was busy with people.

She didn't stop until they reached a quiet corner.

"Get straight to the point."

"If it's the same old talk, don't bother."

"I can't do anything right now."

Anna's tone was sharp and defensive.

Howard was taken aback at first.

Then a sinister smile spread across his face.

"Don't be so quick to refuse."

"Take a look at this first."

He handed her a stack of documents.

Anna recognized them with just a glance.

They were the damning account books.

"What does this mean?" She took them and flipped through quickly.

She realized this was only half of them.

The rest were clearly still in his possession.

Howard shoved his hands into his pockets.

He whistled casually while looking out the window.

"Anna, I genuinely want to cooperate."

"Just keep helping me."

"All these account books will be yours to handle."

The offer was too tempting to resist.

Her fingers tightened around the edges of the books.

If she could get all of them, she could take her mother away soon.

Seeing her hesitation, Howard pressed his advantage.

"I promise I'll keep my word."

"You already have part of it in your hands."

"Anna, you must help me stop Adrian and Chloe's engagement!"

His expression grew visibly panicked at the end.

Anna was confused.

This marriage alliance shouldn't affect his interests.

"But he doesn't want anything to do with me now."

She shoved the account books back into his hands.

Since he wanted to get engaged, why should she bother?

She turned to leave.

Howard's face darkened instantly.

His expression turned terrifyingly grim.

"Stop right there!"

His shout echoed through the hallway.

Anna had no choice but to halt.

Howard slowly tapped the account books.

His voice was icy cold.

"I tried asking nicely."

"Do you really think I won't touch your mother?"

A chill ran down Anna's spine.

She thought she was breaking free from his control.

Now she realized it was all an illusion.

Howard let out a cold, mocking laugh.

"Cooperating is better for everyone."

"Otherwise…"

He made a threatening gesture.

"Who knows what might happen to your mother."

"I can't make any guarantees.
###Chapter 357

Anna Ross instinctively stepped back.

She forced herself to halt.

Her gaze collided directly with Howard Lowell.

Her heart sank heavily.

Her expression instantly turned cold.

Her voice was laced with suppressed anger. "You promised not to touch my mother."

"Now you're going back on your word?"

She wanted to slap herself.

How could she have ever trusted someone like him.

She turned to leave.

She never wanted to help him again in this lifetime.

Howard Lowell immediately panicked.

He rushed over and grabbed her arm.

"Anna, you have to help me."

"These ledgers are yours once I give them to you."

"I swear I will never interfere again!"

The surroundings fell into dead silence.

Distant,muffled voices could be faintly heard.

Anna stared at the stack of ledgers.

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

These things were far too important to her.

"There's one more thing I haven't told you."

Howard lowered his voice.

"Your mother's illness could trigger other symptoms."

"Without sufficient funds for treatment..."

He deliberately paused.

Anna's breath hitched.

She didn't dare to think further.

Howard seized the chance to shove the ledgers into her hands.

"You definitely can't come up with that much money."

"But I can."

"How about we make a deal?"

A heavy weight pressed on Anna's chest.

Anger was completely replaced by anxiety.

If something happened to her mother...

She couldn't even bear to imagine it.

Howard gave her no time to think.

"I already have a plan."

"You just need to cooperate with me."

Anna looked up blankly.

Her voice was hoarse. "What do I need to do?"

"I'll tell you when the time comes."

A flash of excitement gleamed in Howard's eyes.

His hands clenched and then relaxed.

Anna silently took the ledgers.

She turned and walked away expressionlessly.

Her mother was already asleep when she returned to the hospital room.

She sat by the bed, gazing at her mother's pale face.

A sharp pain pierced her heart.

Her mother had been the only one by her side since childhood.

She supported her studies and sacrificed everything for her.

Yet now, there was so little she could do in return.

"Mom, I think I'm becoming a bad person."

Anna whispered softly.

Her eyes fell upon the ledgers.

Tears slid down silently.

Leaving dark, damp stains on the paper.

The empty hospital room offered no response.

She didn't know what to do.

。。。。。。

It was almost time to leave work when Anna returned to the company.

She tidied her desk briefly before heading to the bar.

The weather was growing colder, but the bar remained lively.

Her salary had also increased significantly.

"Anna!"

She had just finished singing and stepped off the stage when she heard a familiar call.

Mia Lawrence was waving vigorously from below.

Someone else stood beside her.

It was only when she got closer that she recognized Julian Garnache.

Her best friend's eyes were curved into happy crescents.

"Anna, you were amazing today!"

Mia glanced behind her.

Several guys were still loudly calling her name.
###Chapter 358

Julian Garnache also stood up.

His gaze was gentle as he looked at Anna Ross.

"Anna has truly become more and more outstanding."

"Not only is she beautiful, but her work abilities are so strong."

"She has gained the affection of so many fans."

They smiled at each other.

Their eyes were full of recognition and pride for Anna.

Anna gave a light smile.

She simply felt that everyone was being too enthusiastic.

Suddenly, a slightly unnatural voice interrupted.

"Anna! I'm your fan, can I take a photo with you?"

The three of them turned to look.

A short, stocky boy with dark skin was excitedly running over.

His face was covered in freckles.

When he smiled, he revealed a set of yellow teeth.

He held his phone up high.

Mia Lawrence shuddered.

She immediately pulled Anna behind her.

She reached out to stop him.

"No. Who are you? Why should we let you take a photo with Anna just like that?"

The boy's expression froze.

He glanced at the person behind her.

He tried hard to squeeze out a smile.

"I am her loyal fan."

He turned to Anna.

His voice suddenly became soft.

"Can I? I used to have no hope in life."

"But after hearing your songs, I found the courage to live again."

"You gave me a purpose."

"I am willing to do anything for you."

"You are my goddess!"

He became more emotional as he spoke.

His eyes were fixed intently on Anna.

It seemed somewhat frightening.

Mia Lawrence saw his strange state.

She cursed under her breath.

She quickly pulled Anna and Julian away.

Anna looked back.

The boy stood there helplessly.

He covered his face painfully with both hands.

After a while, he let go.

He stared at his own hands and shook his head repeatedly.

Not far away, people were pointing and laughing at him.

They mocked him for a toad lusting after a swan's flesh.

Anna felt a bit不忍.

She whispered to Mia.

"Mia, aren't we being too harsh? He just wanted a photo."

It wasn't a difficult request.

Taking one photo could satisfy him.

But Mia shook her head.

"No. You're not a celebrity."

"Why should you casually take photos with people?"

"Besides, do you know what he might do with your photo?"

Anna was stunned.

She really hadn't thought that far.

Julian also added.

"Such obsessive people are dangerous."

"It's better if you don't pay attention to them."

Anna still wanted to say something.

But when she turned, she saw Mia looking at Julian with admiration.

It was as if he had spoken some great truth.

She helplessly sighed.

Love truly makes people blind.

But how did the two of them make up?

Anna pulled Mia aside.

She leaned close to her ear and asked quietly.

"Quick, tell me. How did you two make up?"

Mia glanced at Julian.

She lowered her voice.

"I took the initiative to find him."

"There was a misunderstanding before."

"He sent messages, but I didn't reply."

"So are you two together now?" Anna was somewhat surprised.

The speed was too fast.

Mia almost laughed.

Her cheeks turned red.

"Not yet."

"I'm just staying by his side as a friend for now."

"As for the rest... let it happen naturally."

Anna couldn't help but laugh.

Mia was already pulling her back.

She didn't forget to whisper a reminder.

"Don't talk about this anymore."

"It would be so awkward if he heard."
###Chapter 359

Anna Ross shook her head gently and remained silent.

Julian Garnache took the two women out for dinner, then drove them home.

After saying goodbye to Mia Lawrence, Anna walked toward the apartment building.

As soon as she stepped into the stairwell, a figure rushed down toward her.

Anna staggered back from the impact, nearly tumbling down the steps.

She quickly grabbed the handrail to steady herself.

The person who had bumped into her was a middle-aged woman. Her bags and packages were scattered across the floor.

"How do you walk? Are you blind?" The woman planted her hands on her hips and pointed accusingly.

Rubbing her dizzy head, Anna realized she was in trouble.

This woman was clearly not going to be reasonable.

"You were the one running too fast and bumping into me."

She glanced at the items that had rolled down the stairs. Some were already broken.

The woman's eyes widened. Her voice rose sharply. "Such a pretty girl, but so rude! Everyone, come see this injustice!"

She plopped down on the steps, settling in as if she wouldn't leave until the matter was resolved.

Anna found it ridiculous that she had encountered this kind of situation.

"Ma'am, you were the one who bumped into me."

A few residents opened their doors to watch the commotion.

Seeing the audience, the woman began wiping fake tears. Her wails grew louder. "The young bullying the elderly! Is there no justice left?"

The crowd murmured among themselves.

"Young people these days have no manners. How were they raised?"

"If she bumped into someone, just apologize. Why shift blame?"

"Look at all her things knocked over. She's not even helping pick them up."

The accusations multiplied, threatening to swallow her whole.

The woman shot her a smug glance.

Anna looked at the pointing fingers, understanding the feeling of being unable to defend herself.

"Little girl, just pick these up for me, and I'll let it go." The woman nudged the scattered items with her foot.

Anna stood her ground without moving.

Someone shouted impatiently, "She's compromising! Hurry up and pick them up!"

Suppressing her anger, Anna calmly retorted, "Why should I pick them up when I didn't knock them over?"

Her words instantly ignited the crowd's emotions.

The woman led the shouting. "What kind of child is this? A motherless brat!"
###Chapter 360

Whispers rose around them.

Each word pierced her ears like a needle.

Anna Ross's fingers clenched until they turned white.

She gripped the nearby railing to steady herself.

"Say that again?" Her voice trembled almost imperceptibly.

The middle-aged woman snorted with contempt.

She deliberately raised her voice. "I said you were raised without a mother!"

"Where are your manners? Isn't that the truth?"

Anna's hand shot up.

The wind from her slap brushed the woman's cheek.

But it stopped just short of making contact.

The woman flinched in surprise.

Then a smug expression spread across her face. "Too scared to hit me?"

"Go on, do it!"

A sharp slap echoed through the carriage.

Everyone froze.

Anna stared blankly at Lucas Evans, who had suddenly appeared.

The woman clutched her cheek and shrieked. "How dare you hit me!"

Lucas stepped in front of Anna, shielding her.

His gaze was cold as ice. "Hitting you would dirty my hand."

"But someone like you deserves to be taught a lesson."

The woman immediately began wailing. "Someone judge this fairly!"

"They bumped into me and then hit me!"

The crowd around them stirred into agitation.

Anna tugged at Lucas's sleeve. "I'm sorry..."

"I've dragged you into this."

Lucas shook his head gently. "She is the one at fault."

"Not you."

The woman opened her mouth to retort.

Hurried footsteps approached from a distance.

An assistant pushed through the crowd, holding a tablet.

Lucas took the tablet.

The screen lit up.

A collective gasp rippled through the surrounding crowd.

The video clearly recorded everything.

The truth was revealed.

The crowd's allegiance instantly shifted.

The woman's face turned deathly pale.

She fled in panic under a barrage of accusations.
###Chapter 361

The middle-aged woman’s face turned pale.
Her body swayed unsteadily.

Anna Ross glanced past her and walked straight ahead.
She was no saint.
If others treated her poorly, she wouldn’t offer them kindness in return.

Lucas Evans handed the tablet to his assistant.
He gave a few quiet instructions.
Then he quickened his pace to catch up with her.

"Anna."
That retreating figure made his heart race.
No matter how many times he saw her, it was always the same.

Anna turned at the sound of his voice.
She hadn’t wanted to see him.
How did he know which floor she lived on?

"Lucas, did you need something?" She stood by the door, her fingers resting on the handle.
The earlier commotion still echoed in her mind.
Those vile words were unbearably harsh.
Her mood was thoroughly ruined.

Lucas took two steps forward.
He noticed her hesitant hand.
It made him both bitter and amused.
Did he really seem like such a villain?

He raised his hand slightly. "I just helped you out."
"Won’t you invite me in for a glass of water?"

Anna paused.
He was right.
Sophia Roscente was still home. He probably wouldn’t dare try anything.
She smiled. "Of course."

The door opened.
She called out for Sophia Roscente.
There was no response.

Anna bent to change her shoes.
She fetched a new pair of slippers for Lucas.

"Your place is quite spacious." Lucas glanced around before settling on the sofa.
Anna handed him a glass of water. "It’s enough for living."
Her heart skipped a beat.
This apartment had been prepared by that person.
She was ultimately living in someone else’s space.

Lucas noticed her distraction.
He set down the water glass and pulled something from his jacket.

Anna sat across from him, absently scrolling through her phone.
Her gaze was empty.

"Anna, a gift from my business trip." Lucas slid a small box toward her.
Anna looked up.
A sapphire necklace lay quietly inside the box.
Its brilliance was dazzling.

"It’s beautiful!"
She studied it for a moment longer.
This very necklace had appeared in auction news just days ago.
The Australia event.
A mysterious buyer had acquired it for a sky-high price.
So it was him.

It was too valuable.
She couldn’t accept it.
She had no right to.

"Thank you, but I can’t accept this." She pushed the box back.
Lucas’s smile stiffened.
How could she not be worthy?
In his heart, she deserved the finest things in the world.

He leaned forward, his voice urgent. "I brought this specifically for you."
"I just thought it would suit you."
"Please, don’t feel any pressure."
###Chapter 362

Lucas Evans set down his teacup.

He had just learned about Adrian Sinclair's upcoming engagement.

If the news was true, Anna Ross should be able to completely escape the shadows.

He looked at her, his gaze gentle.

Anna's fingertips trembled slightly.

She pushed the velvet box back toward him.

"This necklace is too valuable. It's not practical for me to wear during work."

Her voice was soft, yet left no room for argument.

Lucas's fingers tightened.

The edge of the box dug painfully into his palm.

He forced a smile. "It's alright. We can discuss it when you need it."

The air grew still.

Outside the window, night deepened. Neon lights swept across the curtains.

Anna stared down at the tablecloth's pattern.

Lucas absently traced the rim of his teacup.

A phone vibration shattered the silence.

Anna immediately grabbed her phone.

She didn't even check the caller ID. "Hello?"

Loud music blasted from the other end.

Sophia Roscente's tearful voice came through. "Anna, I'm at Glamour Bar... Can you come get me?"

The background noise was chaotic.

Anna shot to her feet.

She snatched her coat in a hurry.

"Stay right where you are. I'm on my way."

She shoved her feet into her shoes and rushed out.

Lucas quickly followed.

"Let me drive you. It's not safe to get a cab at night."

He held the door open and signaled the driver to start the engine.

Anna hesitated for a second.

The bar district was notorious. Having a car would be safer.

She murmured her thanks and slid into the back seat.

The driver glanced at them through the rearview mirror.

He silently adjusted the GPS. "To Glamour Bar?"

Anna nodded. "Please hurry."

The tires rolled over the damp streets.

Neon signs flowed like a river across the car windows.

Lucas secretly watched her profile.

She clutched her phone tightly, her knuckles turning white.

Outside Glamour Bar.

Sophia hung up the phone and sighed.

She turned and pushed open the private room door.

Adrian Sinclair was slumped on the sofa.

An empty whiskey bottle lay overturned beside his hand.

Marcus Hill tried to grab the bottle. "Stop drinking!"

Adrian brushed his hand away.

Sophia knelt down to look at him.

"If you don't want to marry Chloe Valentine, why not talk to Grandpa and make it clear?"

Her voice choked with tears.

Adrian tilted his head back and took another swig.

Amber liquid trailed down his jawline.

He laughed hoarsely. "Make it clear?"

His eyes were bloodshot.
###Chapter 363

Marcus Hill grabbed Adrian Sinclair’s wrist.

He snatched the wine glass away.

"Stop drinking," he said in a low voice. "Do you want to ruin your stomach?"

Adrian’s eyes were bloodshot.

He shook off Marcus’s hand and stumbled toward the bottle.

"None of your business."

Sophia Roscente stamped her foot in frustration.

She grabbed the bottle and slammed it on the table.

"Adrian! Who are you trying to impress by drowning yourself like this?"

"If you can’t let her go, then go after her!"

Adrian suddenly laughed.

The sound was harsh and grating.

He covered his eyes with his hand, his shoulders trembling slightly.

"Go after her?"

"How can I?"

He opened his eyes, revealing red veins.

"That morning when I woke up..."

"I saw her lying beside me."

"Do you know how I felt?"

Marcus frowned.

Sophia looked away.

Adrian took another gulp of wine.

The liquid dripped down his jaw and into his collar.

"I tried to hate her."

"I tried to humiliate her."

"But the more I did..."

"The more I couldn’t forget."

His voice grew softer.

It almost became a whisper.

"I’m so useless..."

Sophia suddenly pulled out her phone.

"I already called her."

Marcus looked up sharply.

"You called Anna Ross?"

Adrian froze.

He instinctively straightened his collar.

His eyes darted around nervously.

"No..."

"She can’t see me like this..."

He struggled to stand.

But he staggered from the alcohol.

A woman in a red dress approached.

A strong perfume filled the air.

"Handsome, drinking alone is boring."

"Let me join you?"

Adrian was about to push her away.

Then he saw a familiar figure at the door.

He paused.

In the next second, he wrapped his arm around the woman’s waist.

He buried his face in her neck.

A self-mocking smile touched his lips.
###Chapter 364

A flash of delight lit the woman's eyes.

She reached out to touch him.

Her wrist was seized abruptly.

The grip was so tight it hurt.

She struggled slightly.

He didn't budge.

A low warning sounded in her ear. "Don't move."

She froze instantly.

Sophia Roscente and Marcus Hill exchanged a look.

Shock was written all over their faces.

Adrian Sinclair never let women get this close.

Yet today was an exception?

Anna Ross pushed through the crowded room.

Lucas Evans stayed protectively by her side.

She finally spotted Sophia in the booth.

And Marcus Hill beside her.

"Sophia, come back with me."

Anna's steps halted.

Her gaze landed on Marcus.

"You're not alone?"

Sophia scrambled to her feet.

She forced a laugh, blocking the view behind her.

"Anna, he just got here..."

Marcus nodded in agreement.

Anna narrowed her eyes.

She pointed toward the figure in the shadows.

"Then who is that?"

The silhouette felt strangely familiar.

Sophia's scalp prickled with dread.

"Don't know him. Just some drunk."

Anna frowned, studying the figure.

The more she looked, the more alarmed she became.

The woman shifted her weight, her legs unsteady.

Adrian lost his balance and collapsed.

The scene fell into dead silence.

"I'm sorry!" The woman broke free and fled.

Marcus covered his eyes.

It's over.

Lucas got a clear look at the man's face.

His eyes darkened with sudden understanding.

So that's how it is.

Anna bit her lip hard.

She completely understood it was a setup.

"Sophia, you lied to me?"

Sophia looked on the verge of tears.

"Anna, please let me explain..."

Her eyes darted to Lucas.

Her heart sank like a stone.

Everything was ruined now.
###Chapter 365

Anna Ross curled her lip. "You went through all that trouble to get me back, just for this?"

To watch him surrounded by women?

"No, sis, let me explain—" Sophia Roscente rushed after her, but Anna had already turned away.

She only glanced at Adrian Sinclair, her gaze icy cold.

Sophia stomped her foot and charged forward, trying to grab her and make things right.

Everything was ruined now.

Only three people remained in the room.

Lucas Evans glanced sideways at Adrian, a mocking smile on his lips. "Adrian, it's been a few days. Your taste in women... truly becomes more eye-opening by the day."

Though the words were aimed at Adrian, Marcus Hill was the first to explode.

He shot to his feet. "What's that supposed to mean?"

His friend might be a player, but that didn't give an outsider the right to criticize.

Adrian leaned lazily against the sofa, lifting his eyelids slightly to look at Lucas.

"Need I spell it out?" Lucas sneered. "You used to bully Anna because you were her boss. Now she's finally free."

"Lucas, watch your mouth!"

Marcus clenched his fist, ready to throw a punch, but Adrian raised a hand to stop him.

He stared at Lucas. "Are you two together now?"

Lucas scoffed coldly. "None of your concern. It's only a matter of time. Aren't you getting engaged? It's not appropriate for you to meddle too much."

He won the verbal battle, but his heart felt uncomfortably tight.

After a few moments of silence, Lucas spat out, "Stay away from her."

He turned and left.

This was his best chance. He wouldn't let go.

Adrian's face darkened instantly.

The word "engagement" felt like a needle piercing his heart.

No. He had to go out. At the very least, he had to say something!

"Adrian, where are you going!" Marcus couldn't stop him as Adrian stumbled out the door.

Marcus grabbed his jacket and chased after him.

Adrian had just reached the entrance when his steps froze.

Anna was getting into Lucas's car.

The engine started. The taillights disappeared into the night.

His eyes reddened, a throbbing pain erupting at his temples.

He leaned his head back against the wall, but the agony didn't lessen in the slightest.

He raised a hand to press against his temple, his knuckles turning white.

"Adrian!" Marcus arrived and supported him.

Sophia followed, looking at her dejected cousin with a mix of anger and helplessness. "Cousin, I specifically tricked her into coming. Did you have to put on that show? Did making her misunderstand you feel good?"

She had wanted to help him. Now she was caught in the middle.

She was exhausted.

Adrian remained silent, his brow tightly furrowed, his face pale as paper.
###Chapter 366

Marcus Hill couldn't bear it any longer and tugged at Sophia Roscente's sleeve.
"Stop talking. He's already hurting enough."

Sophia pressed her lips together and swallowed her words.
She meant well for her cousin, but seeing him like this, further words felt pointless.

"Quiet. Take me home." Adrian Sinclair's voice was hoarse.

His Adam's apple bobbed.
The strong liquor burned his throat like swallowed embers.

Marcus handed his jacket to Sophia.
He alone supported the man leaning against the wall, straining to help him into the back seat.

Just as he got him settled, a phone ringtone cut sharply through the silence.

Sophia had no desire to answer it.
But the ringing persisted, one call after another.
Annoyed, she fished out the phone and tossed it directly into the back seat.

Chloe Valentine's sickly sweet voice instantly filled the car.
"Adrian, are you done working? Come to Grandpa's for dinner. I'm here with him now."

Sophia shuddered, rubbing her arms.

Adrian lay sprawled in the back seat, his forearm draped over his eyes, breathing heavily.
"No. Busy. You eat."

The line went dead silent.
Chloe gripped her phone, nails digging viciously into the leather seat.

She forced down her rage, her voice still cloying.
"Still working this late? You should take care of your health."

Adrian frowned in irritation.
"Hanging up." He tossed the phone aside, and it slid under the seat.

Chloe called his name several times, only to be met with the dial tone.
Her chest heaved with anger. "Liar! He's definitely with that bitch!"

She wasn't actually at the manor; it was just a pretext to test him.
Henry had clearly said Adrian left long ago.

It seemed her mother needed to come sooner.
Once they were married, let's see how Anna Ross could cling to him then!

........

Sophia exchanged a look with Marcus, who was driving.
They fell into a silence.

"Take me to my apartment. Not the Lowell residence." Adrian managed to slur out before slipping into unconsciousness.

Marcus acknowledged the instruction.
He turned the steering wheel, heading down another road.

They reached the apartment deep in the night.
Marcus helped the man into bed.
Sophia brought warm water and gently wiped his face.

"Second time," Marcus sighed, sitting on the edge of the bed.
"Seeing him wrecked like this over someone with the last name Ross."

Love truly made people lose their minds.

Sophia paused her movements.
"What if... our families objected to us? What would you do?"

They had kept their relationship hidden from both sets of parents since it began.
Every meeting felt like a secret affair.

Watching her cousin suffer for love, she couldn't help but wonder—would her boy fight for her just as desperately?
###Chapter 367

Marcus Hill was momentarily stunned.

He hadn't expected her to ask that question so suddenly.

For a moment, he didn't know how to respond.

Sophia Roscente suddenly raised her hand to stop him.

"Don't say anything."

"I don't want to hear it."

"We'll talk about the future later."

Deep down, she was terrified.

She feared he would retreat when faced with difficulties.

She feared he would no longer choose her steadfastly.

Even though she really liked him now.

If he couldn't give her what she wanted.

She would leave without hesitation.

Marcus helplessly rubbed his forehead.

He hadn't said anything yet.

Watching her flushed face from nervousness.

He couldn't help but smile slightly.

"Sophia."

"I promise you."

"Marcus Hill will only love you in this lifetime."

"No matter what difficulties we face."

"I will stand firmly by your side."

He never fell for someone easily.

Nor did he make promises lightly.

But this time, he was serious.

He truly wanted to cherish the person before him.

Sophia's face turned even redder.

Remembering what he had said in front of her cousin.

She felt her cheeks burning.

"Oh my."

"Stop talking."

"I get it, okay?"

She threw the face towel into the basin.

Picking up the basin, she fled the room as if escaping.

Marcus watched her hurried retreating figure.

His smile deepened.

He walked to the window and looked out at the scenery.

His gaze was gentle yet firm.

A moment later.

Sophia suddenly rushed back in a hurry.

"Stay here and watch over my brother."

"I need to go back for a bit."

Marcus raised an eyebrow at her.

"What are you going back for?"

They finally had a chance to be alone.

He really didn't want her to leave.

Sophia had already grabbed her bag.

"I just remembered we have surveillance at home."

"I want to see what really happened that day."

She knew her cousin's personality well.

He wasn't the type to lose control after drinking.

So she had to get to the bottom of it.

Marcus was about to offer to take her back.

But she had already run off.

The next day.

Anna Ross rubbed her sore shoulders.

Work was exceptionally busy today.

It took all morning to barely finish everything.

Now she could finally rest for a while.

She picked up her water cup to get some water.

A colleague suddenly called out to her.

"Anna."

"Someone's here to see you!"

Anna turned toward the voice.

To her surprise, the visitor was none other than.

Chloe Valentine.

The other woman stood at the entrance with her arms crossed.

When she saw Anna approaching, she coldly commanded.

"Come with me."

"I have questions for you."

Anna frowned slightly.

But she followed her out nonetheless.

Chloe led her to the stairwell.

It was very quiet there.

Everyone took the elevator now.

Few people used the stairs.

"Was Adrian with you last night?"

Chloe asked without turning around, her back to Anna.

A puzzled expression appeared on Anna's face.

"Miss Valentine."

"He's your fiancé."

"Shouldn't you know where he is?"

"Why are you asking me such a question?"

Chloe's face darkened with anger at her words.

She nearly gritted her teeth.

Suppressing her fury.

She forced a fake smile and turned around.

"Of course I know that."

"But I have to be cautious."

"To prevent certain shameless people from getting close to him behind my back."

Anna's originally gentle eyes filled with anger.

"Miss Valentine."

"You're truly pathetic."

"You can't control your own man."

"Yet you come here to vent your madness on me."

"I have work to do."

"I won't keep you company."

With that, she turned to leave.

Not wanting to waste any more time on such nonsense.

Chloe was furious.

She wouldn't let her leave so easily.

She grabbed Anna's wrist.

"Stop right there."
###Chapter 368

Anna Ross felt her wrist tighten, forced to stop.

The person behind her stepped in front, sharp eyes scanning her pale face. "Stay away from him. We're getting engaged soon."

"You wouldn't want people talking behind your back, would you? If I see you near him again, you'll face the consequences." Chloe Valentine's voice lowered, laced with an undisguised threat.

Anna shook off her hand calmly, meeting her gaze. "I think you're mistaken. I'm not the one who needs to keep my distance."

"You!" Chloe's fingertips trembled with anger, a sharp pain piercing her heart.

Adrian Sinclair treated this woman differently—she had sensed it from their first meeting. This threat needed to be eliminated quickly.

As Anna turned to leave, Chloe suddenly burst into tears. "Miss Ross, if you have any grievances, take them out on me. Why take it out on Adrian? It was my fault for accidentally mentioning you and Lucas..."

Anna froze for a moment, then caught sight of a familiar figure at the end of the hallway.

Her heart tightened abruptly.

Chloe had already run toward the man, clinging intimately to his arm. Adrian stood still, his gaze heavy and unreadable.

Only he knew the storm raging inside him. From the moment he saw her, countless questions swirled in his mind.

Was she really with Lucas? Was she with him at the bar last night? The thought felt like an invisible hand squeezing his chest, suffocating him with pain.

Anna lowered her eyes and walked past them in silence.

"Stop." Adrian's voice was cold as ice.

She pretended not to hear and continued walking. He quickly caught up, blocking her path. Left behind, Chloe dug her nails deep into her palms, eyes blazing with fury.

Anna frowned and looked up. "It's work hours. I have things to do."

"I'll compensate you for the time." Adrian stared at her distant expression, his throat moving slightly, voice tense.

After a brief silence, his tone softened slightly. "I'm getting engaged. Don't you have anything to say?"

Or do you just not care?

He watched her deep eyes closely, searching for any flicker of emotion.

Anna's face paled instantly, her fingertips trembling slightly. So he stopped her just to say this.

She forced down the bitterness in her chest, keeping her voice steady. "I forgot to congratulate you. Happy engagement."

The last trace of light in Adrian's eyes vanished.

As expected, it had always been his one-sided desire to keep her by his side. She never cared.

"Go," he said, stepping aside, his voice detached.
###Chapter 369

Anna Ross did not look back.

She walked quickly away from the corridor.

She would pretend she never saw them.

She never heard those words.

Overthinking would only hurt her more.

Adrian Sinclair stood where he was.

His gaze was cold and heavy.

Chloe Valentine reached out to link her arm through his.

"Adrian, where were you last night?"

"I waited for you all night."

She blinked her eyes.

Feigning innocence and hurt.

Adrian pulled his arm back.

"I had business last night."

"I need to handle some work now."

He turned and walked away.

Chloe did not follow.

Her nails dug into her palms.

The engagement was approaching.

She had to endure this.

The position of Mrs. Sinclair would be hers alone.

Anna worked late.

The work in the Executive Assistant department was more exhausting than she imagined.

She checked the time.

She hurried to the bar.

The bar was unusually quiet.

The lights were off.

It was completely dark.

"Closed today?"

She fumbled for the light switch.

Her finger just touched it.

The lights suddenly blazed on.

"Happy Birthday!"

Mia Lawrence and Julian Garnache rushed out.

One held a cake.

The other carried a bouquet of flowers.

Many people surged out behind them.

The boss.

Colleagues.

Friends.

All smiling as they handed her gifts.

The gifts piled up like a small mountain.

Anna's eyes grew warm.

She had forgotten her own birthday.

"Don't cry, Anna!"

Mia pulled her to sit down.

"Today is for happiness!"

Everyone gathered around.

Offering their congratulations all at once.

Anna wiped her tears away.

She hugged her best friend tightly.

"Thank you all..."

Julian handed her a tissue.

"It was Mia's idea."

"She said you've been feeling down lately."

Anna held her even tighter.

Her best friend understood her best.

Lucas Evans walked from behind the crowd.

Holding an exquisite gift box.

"Anna, happy birthday."

He smiled as he offered the gift.

Anna looked at the box.

Remembering the last time she had refused him.
###Chapter 370

Anna Ross was still hesitating.

Lucas Evans bent down and took her hand.

A gift was pressed into her palm.

"Anna, a birthday gift."

His voice was very soft.

"You accepted theirs."

"Not accepting mine would be rude."

Anna snapped back to reality.

She thanked him quietly.

She clutched the gift tightly.

Mia Lawrence jumped onto the stage.

She grabbed the microphone and shouted.

"The birthday party starts now!"

Cheers instantly erupted.

The cake was wheeled out.

Anna picked up the knife.

Everyone received a slice.

Lucas suddenly moved closer.

His fingertip was coated with frosting.

He gently dabbed it on her cheek.

Anna froze.

She looked down at the cake in her hand.

She scooped up a bit of frosting.

She swiped it back at him.

The frosting landed right on the tip of his nose.

It looked rather silly.

Someone laughed.

Soon, laughter filled the room.

Mia walked over.

"You two are really…"

She didn't finish her sentence.

She noticed Julian Garnache in the corner.

He was quietly eating his cake.

An idea sparked in her mind.

She took a piece of cake and crept closer.

She circled behind him.

While he was distracted.

She smeared frosting on his cheek.

Julian frowned and turned around.

He grabbed her wrist firmly.

Mia gasped.

She lost her balance.

Pulled by his force.

She tumbled straight into his arms.

It was the first time she was this close to the person she liked.

Her face flushed instantly.

Her heart raced nervously.

Her fingers clutched at her clothes.

She was speechless.

Julian realized it was her.

He immediately let go.

"Mia?"

"Sorry."

He stood up and grabbed a tissue to wipe his face.

Mia was still dazed.

She took a few seconds to apologize.

"Julian, I'm sorry."

"Are you mad?"

She suddenly regretted it.

She was afraid he disliked such behavior.

Julian smiled.

"It's fine."

"I just wasn't paying attention. It startled me."

Mia became even more flustered.

She didn't dare say another word.

"Mia, come play a game."

Anna waved her over.

Mia glanced at Julian.

She ran over and joined them.

Anna was having fun with them.

A faint smile graced her face.

It was much better than her previous expressionless state.

Mia sat down next to her.

But her gaze drifted back to Julian.

He sat alone in the corner.

Aside from those few words earlier.

He hadn't spoken again.

He seemed preoccupied.

She sighed softly.

She had sensed his unhappiness earlier.

"You lost! Drink!"

The crowd suddenly erupted.

A drink was pushed toward Anna.

Lucas reached out and stopped it.

"I'll drink for her."

"Anna doesn't drink. Please understand."

He threw his head back and finished it.

Anna pressed her lips together.

After a moment's hesitation, she spoke.

"Lucas, thank you."

"But I can handle it myself."

She didn't drink.

But she disliked owing favors even more.

Lucas's eyes dimmed briefly.

Then he smiled again.

"It's nothing."

"I have a high tolerance."

"Just leave it to me."
###Chapter 371

Anna Ross set down her glass and withdrew from the game.

Mia Lawrence pulled her aside for a private talk.

"Anna, do you think Julian actually likes me?" Mia sipped her drink, her gaze drifting across the room.

Julian Garnache sat alone on the sofa, staring at his phone with a deep frown.

Anna picked up a bottle and took a swig. It went down the wrong way, making her cough.

She caught her breath. "Should I go ask him for you?"

Mia quickly grabbed her arm. "Don't!"

Anna gave a light laugh. "You're just afraid to know the answer, aren't you?"

Mia lowered her head and took another drink.

Julian was always kind to her, but it felt more like how an older brother treats his little sister.

They drank in silence together.

Anna was soon drunk.

She clutched Mia's hand. "Mia, when Adrian and I broke up, it felt like my heart was torn in two."

Mia's eyes were bleary with alcohol. "Why did you break up?"

Anna mumbled, "Because..."

She slumped over the table, fast asleep.

Mia shook her. "Anna, do you still have feelings for Adrian?"

Anna muttered something incoherent.

Mia leaned in closer to listen, but only caught the word "like."

She sighed and laid her head down on the table, falling asleep as well.

...

Anna woke up in the early hours of the morning.

Her head was pounding.

The sky outside the window was still dim.

She got up to use the restroom.

She nearly tripped while passing through the living room.

She turned on the light and her heart nearly stopped.

Someone was asleep on the sofa.

It was Lucas Evans.

Why was Lucas in her apartment?
###Chapter 372

Anna Ross opened her eyes.

Her head throbbed painfully.

She tried to recall last night's events.

Her memory stopped right before the drinking.

What happened after that.

She had no impression at all.

She got up and walked toward Sophia Roscente's room.

The door was slightly ajar.

It was empty inside.

The living room lights were on.

Lucas Evans lay on the sofa.

The light woke him.

He sat up squinting.

"Anna, you're awake?"

He found his glasses and put them on.

His gaze behind the lenses seemed evasive.

Anna stood where she was.

"What happened last night?"

Her voice was hoarse from sleep.

Lucas rubbed his temples.

"You and your best friend got drunk."

"Her friend took her home."

"So I brought you back."

He paused for a moment.

His tone turned cautious.

"Are you mad at me?"

"I just wanted to help."

Anna shook her head.

"It's not your fault."

"I drank too much."

She regretted it privately.

Her alcohol tolerance was poor.

Yet she had insisted on pushing her limits.

Lucas remembered last night's scene.

In her drunken haze.

She kept calling that name.

Adrian Sinclair.

I'm sorry.

Each word felt like a needle piercing his heart.

He clenched his fingers.

His nails dug into his palms.

"Anna."

He looked up suddenly.

"My friend opened a coffee shop."

"He invited me to try the new menu."

"Will you come with me?"

Anna instinctively refused.

"I don't really like coffee."

She averted her gaze.

Unable to meet his eyes.

Lucas didn't give up.

"They have other drinks too."

"All of them taste great."

"You should give it a try."

Anna tried to decline again.

"Lucas, I..."

He interrupted her.

"It's settled then."

Lucas picked up his jacket.

"I'll pick you up later."

He turned and left.

His retreating figure looked resolute.

Anna sat alone in the living room.

Her headache grew worse.

She had clearly refused.

But he was always this stubborn.

She couldn't give him what he wanted.

Once everything was over.

She would take her mother and leave.

After a quick wash.

She took a short nap.

Then got up for work.

Just as she reached the company entrance.

She ran into Adrian Sinclair.

She lowered her head to avoid him.

But then she saw Chloe Valentine behind him.

Chloe smiled brightly.

She quickly walked up to Anna.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

Her voice was sickly sweet.

"Adrian and I are getting engaged today."

She linked arms with Adrian.

The gesture was intimate.

Anna stood frozen in place.

As if turned to ice.

Her expression solidified.

A flash of triumph shone in Chloe's eyes.

"You're Adrian's cousin."

"Would you like to join us?"

Her smile widened.

The air seemed to stand still.

Adrian watched her silently.

His gaze was deep and unreadable.

A long time passed.

Anna finally regained her senses.

She forced a stiff smile.

"No, thank you."

She said softly.

"I have to work."
###Chapter 373

A shrewd glint flashed in Chloe Valentine's eyes.

Her fingers tightened, pulling Adrian Sinclair's arm closer.

"Grandpa and Adrian won't mind."

She leaned in closer, her smile bright as the morning sun.

Adrian remained expressionless.

He stood still, his gaze locked intensely on Anna Ross.

Anna bit her lower lip.

Her chest felt tight and suffocating.

"No need."

She lowered her head, avoiding his stare. "I'm heading back to the office."

As she turned away, her eyes stung unbearably.

Adrian watched her disappear behind the glass doors.

His eyes gradually turned cold.

"What a pity." Chloe pouted. "I'll have to call her cousin from now on."

Her finger traced circles on his sleeve. "But she doesn't seem to like me."

Adrian withdrew his arm.

"Let's go."

His voice betrayed no emotion.

She didn't even try to stop him.

How ridiculous.

He had actually expected something.

Anna hurried into the elevator.

Tears hit the floor.

She wiped them away.

Why should she feel sad?

She didn't even have the right to speak up.

HR Department office.

Howard Lowell waved her inside.

The door clicked shut.

"The engagement party is today." He lowered his voice. "The plan remains unchanged."

Anna's fingers trembled.

"I'll tell him you're seriously ill." Howard narrowed his eyes. "He'll definitely come see you."

"Do everything you can to keep him there."

"He must not attend that engagement party!"

Anna's nails dug into her palms.

"He might not come."

Her voice sounded weak.

Howard snorted. "I have my ways."

"Just focus on keeping him occupied."

Anna looked down.

The marble floor reflected her pale face.

Like a trapped animal.

Nowhere to run.

"Fine." She agreed hoarsely.

Howard grinned widely.

He slapped her shoulder heavily.

"Don't worry." He said insincerely. "I'll treat your mother better from now on."

"Our family will be reunited."

Anna forced a smile.

Reunited?

Just another form of exploitation.

She clenched her clothes.

She had to get her mother out.

As soon as possible.
###Chapter 374

At the top floor of Wanning Group.

Lucas Evans leaned back in his leather chair, fingertips lightly tapping the desk.

The office door opened.

A man in a black trench coat entered and placed a file folder on the desk.

"Mr. Evans, the items you requested."

Lucas turned around, a slight smile curling at the corner of his lips.

This detective, codenamed K, was someone he had worked with long-term.

K had extensive connections throughout New York and was extremely well-informed.

He pulled the documents from the folder and carefully reviewed them.

"Thank you for your hard work. Your payment will be processed as usual."

K gave a slight bow. "You're too kind, Mr. Evans. It's my honor to be of service to you."

Lucas waved his hand and pressed the intercom.

"Accounting, transfer the funds to Mr. K."

He always kept business and personal matters separate, and never shortchanged those who performed well.

K tactfully withdrew.

The office returned to silence.

Lucas turned page after page of the investigation report, his frown deepening.

He had long noticed Anna Ross's fear of Adrian Sinclair and had specifically looked into her family situation.

When he saw the documents detailing Howard Lowell's domestic abuse against Vivian Lowell, he clenched the papers tightly.

So that was it.

No wonder she always seemed so fragile, so cautious.

Lucas walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, looking down at the entire city.

If he could help her escape the Lowell family's control, would she choose him?

He decided to find an opportunity to test her feelings.

Anna Ross sat in the taxi, sneezing several times in a row.

Her phone kept vibrating.

She opened the message. It was a photo sent by her mother.

In the photo, Vivian Lowell was holding Howard Lowell's arm, smiling radiantly.

Howard was also smiling, which was rare for him.

Yet Anna found that smile particularly grating.

She turned off her phone, her chest feeling tight.

They must have gone to the engagement party.

Thinking of Adrian Sinclair, her heart ached faintly.

He had clearly said he wouldn't get engaged.

But now everything was settled.

"Miss, are you alright?" The female driver, seeing her pale face in the rearview mirror, asked with concern.
###Chapter 375

Anna Ross shook her head gently.

"It's fine. Just get me to my destination."

The driver glanced at her through the rearview mirror.

"Young people these days never take care of themselves."

"They always tough it out when something's wrong."

"This can't go on."

Anna lowered her gaze.

There was nothing physically wrong with her.

It was her heart that ached.

Physical pain could be treated.

But how does one heal a wounded heart?

She fell silent.

Turning her head, she looked out the window.

Winter arrived abruptly in New York.

The trees had long shed their leaves.

Only barren branches reached toward the sky.

The bleak scenery was inevitably melancholic.

Fortunately, the city's dense buildings softened this desolation.

Arriving home, she collapsed on the sofa, lost in thought.

Her phone was unusually quiet.

The usual noisy notification chimes had fallen completely silent.

Anna set her phone down.

She stared blankly at the ceiling.

They should be holding the engagement ceremony right now.

Would he be smiling with particular happiness?

As she thought, tears unconsciously slid down her cheeks.

He once said he would only love her.

Only marry her.

Only be good to her.

Now those promises were like fallen leaves scattered by the wind.

Anna sat up.

She wiped away her tears.

She didn't understand why she kept thinking about these things.

Glancing at the moving clock on the wall, she finally made a decision.

She walked into the bedroom and changed her clothes.

Picking up her bag, she prepared to go out.

She didn't want to help Howard Lowell anymore.

Since that person had found happiness, she shouldn't interfere.

She put on her shoes and was about to open the door when her phone suddenly chimed.

Anna's heart skipped a beat.

She uncontrollably picked up her phone.

She didn't know what she was expecting.

Her heart sank again when she saw the messages.

One was from Lucas Evans.

Reminding her to get ready.

He was coming to pick her up soon.

The other was from Howard Lowell.

Saying he had already started his move.

She must stall Adrian Sinclair.

He couldn't attend the engagement party.

Anna bit her lip.

She tapped on Lucas's message to reply.

After finishing, she put on her shoes and pushed the door open.

Days grew shorter after winter began.

It was already dark outside.

The motion-sensor light happened to be broken.

The hallway was pitch black.

She took out her phone to use as a flashlight.

Suddenly, something fell to the ground behind her.

"Who's there?" She spun around.

She couldn't see anything in the darkness.

But the sound was unmistakable.

It was like someone rummaging through things.

Accidentally knocking other items over.

She held her breath, listening intently.

But there was no further sound around her.

Anna shook her head.

She thought she was being too sensitive.

Residents in this building returned late.

There really weren't many people around at this time.

She turned on her flashlight.

The light dispelled the darkness.

She instinctively shone it toward where the sound had come from.

It was still empty. No one was there.
###Chapter 376

Anna Ross steadied herself.

She continued down the stairs.

A faint sound came from behind her.

She turned instinctively.

A damp cloth clamped over her mouth and nose.

A pungent chemical smell invaded her nostrils.

Anna struggled fiercely.

No sound escaped her throat.

"Move again, and this knife will draw blood." A cold blade pressed against her neck.

It stung slightly.

She froze instantly.

The man dragged her back into the hallway.

They stopped at her apartment door.

"Open it." His voice was a low, threatening rasp.

Anna fumbled for her keys.

Her fingers brushed against her phone.

Maybe she could find a chance to call for help.

"No tricks." The man snatched her phone away.

He shoved the keys into her hand. "Open it. Now."

The knife tip pressed harder.

Anna gritted her teeth.

She took the keys.

She deliberately fumbled with the lock.

She needed to buy time.

The man lost patience.

He grabbed the keys and jammed them into the lock.

The lock turned with a sharp click.

Anna gripped the doorframe tightly.

She tried to scream for help.

The man covered her mouth forcefully.

He shoved her into the apartment.

The door slammed shut behind them.

"Scared?" A cold laugh hissed near her ear. "This is just the beginning."

Anna suddenly froze.

The voice sounded strangely familiar.

She tried to look up at him.

But a mask and a low cap hid his face completely.

The man dragged her roughly further inside.

"You think you're so high and mighty?" His laugh twisted. "Tonight, you'll learn what it feels like to be trampled."

Anna glanced at the mirror on the wall.

Her pupils contracted sharply.

This wasn't a robbery.
###Chapter 377

"Who are you? I've never seen you before!"

Anna Ross's mind was a chaotic mess.

She couldn't understand what the man was saying at all.

When had she ever looked down on anyone?

The man didn't waste any more words.

He shoved her violently onto the sofa.

His entire body pressed down on her instantly.

Anna struggled to get up, but was forced back onto the couch with brutal force.

"Help!" She twisted her body desperately, trying to push him away.

He easily restrained her.

His hands began tearing roughly at her collar.

Disgusting!

Her stomach churned.

Her legs kicked wildly, but it was useless.

The difference in strength between men and women was just too great.

Why?

Why did these things always happen to her?

Last time was the same.

And now this...

"Goddess, you smell so good." His lewd voice whispered close to her ear, making her nauseous.

"Let me go. I don't know you. Why are you doing this?" Anna kicked and fought frantically.

Her collar was already torn open.

Cold air rushed in, making her shiver.

The man seemed not to hear.

His greedy eyes roamed over her body.

His rough hands groped freely.

"This skin is amazing. Absolutely perfect."

His actions grew more aggressive.

He lowered his head, trying to kiss her.

Anna screamed and swung her hand.

A sharp slap landed on his face.

In her despair, she put all her strength into that blow.

His mask fell off.

In her panic, Anna finally saw his face clearly.

Pimpled skin.

Thick lips.

It was the same man from the bar who had wanted a photo with Mia Lawrence, but was rejected!

Anna shielded her body, shrinking back.

"Please let me go," she begged, her voice trembling. "I really didn't do anything."

"Let you go? Dream on! You made me lose face at the bar last time. What did I do wrong?" The man suddenly flew into a rage.

A twisted smile appeared on his face.

He reached out to tear at her pants.

Tears streamed from Anna's eyes.

She grabbed whatever was nearby and threw it at him.

He dodged easily.

A provocative smile appeared on his face.

"Keep throwing things. The more you resist, the more excited I get. Hahaha..."

His eyes turned vicious.

He grabbed her shoulders, pinning her hands down.

He leaned in, trying to force a kiss.

"No! This is too disgusting." Anna struggled backward, her spine pressed tightly against the sofa.

"Anna Ross! Are you in there?" A knocking sound suddenly came from the door.

Anna grasped at this lifeline.

" I'm here! Help—" she shouted at the top of her lungs.

The man quickly covered her mouth.

The second half of her cry for help was muffled.

A cold glint flashed.

A dagger pressed against her neck.

Adrian Sinclair heard the noise inside, his brow furrowed.

Noticing the sudden silence behind the door, he took out his keys.

He had asked his executive assistant to arrange the room and kept a spare key for himself.

The sound of the lock turning echoed.

Hope ignited in Anna's heart.

The man's eyes turned gloomy.

He yanked her up.

The dagger remained pressed against her neck.

"Tell the person outside to get lost!" he hissed through gritted teeth.

Damn it!

He had been staking out this place for so long.

Anna clearly lived alone.

At most, she had a female roommate.

Where did this man suddenly come from?
###Chapter 378

Anna's heart hammered against her ribs.

Her throat was dry and tight.

A cold blade pressed against her neck.

"Hurry up!" The man increased the pressure, the edge biting into her skin.

A sharp pain made her hold her breath.

The door suddenly swung open.

Adrian Sinclair stood in the doorway.

His gaze swept the room, turning icy cold.

Anna froze. Why was it him?

She had clearly contacted Lucas.

"Back off if you don't want her dead! Let me go!" The man holding her trembled.

Adrian let out a cold laugh. "Do it. Take her life now."

"Adrian!" Anna stared at him in disbelief.

Did he truly not care if she lived or died?

Adrian stepped closer. "If you kill her, I will make you wish you were dead."

His eyes darkened. "I've been needing someone to practice on lately."

The man dragged Anna backward. "Stop bluffing!"

Adrian advanced step by step. "Once you walk through that door, you're not leaving."

Madness flashed in the man's eyes. "Then we all die together!"

The blade pressed down hard.

Anna cried out in pain. She bent her head and sank her teeth into his wrist.

Adrian's pupils contracted. Seeing blood well from her neck, he exploded into motion.

The man yelped and released her, cursing.

Before he could finish, a fist sent him flying.

Anna's legs gave way. She collapsed, but Adrian caught her.

Blood flowed steadily from the wound. His face darkened as he quickly wrapped his jacket around her.

"Hang on. We're going to the hospital." His voice was low.

Before she could speak, he swept her into his arms.

The movement tugged at her injury, drawing a soft gasp of pain.

"Serves you right." He shot her a glance and strode out.
###Chapter 379

Anna Ross was about to speak when a wave of intense dizziness struck her.

Her vision darkened, forcing her to close her eyes and steady herself.

When she opened them again, her eyes widened in terror.

"Behind you!" she screamed, her voice breaking.

The man was charging toward them, a knife raised high, his face twisted with malice.

Just as the blade was about to descend, Adrian Sinclair swiftly pulled her into his arms and sidestepped.

A sharp tearing sound echoed through the air, and the man collapsed to the floor.

Anna frantically turned to check on Adrian.

A long, deep gash ran down his arm.

His custom-tailored suit was slashed open, and his white shirt was instantly stained crimson with blood.

"You're hurt!" Anna reached out urgently, trying to staunch the bleeding.

He merely said, "It's nothing," his voice flat.

The man on the ground struggled to get up.

The doorway was now crowded with people, and several security guards rushed in, pinning him firmly to the floor.

His face pressed against the ground, the man still hurled vicious insults at her.

"You gold-digging bitch, you'll get what's coming to—ah!"

His words were cut short by a sharp cry of pain.

Adrian's foot came down hard on his head, crushing him back against the floor.

"Say one more word," Adrian's voice was ice, "and I'll make you regret it right now."

With that, he scooped her into his arms and turned to leave.

Anna stared blankly at his cold, stern profile.

"Anna!" Lucas Evans arrived in a hurry, just in time to see the girl he loved being carried in another man's arms.

Confusion and jealousy twisted inside him.

Adrian walked straight past him, not even sparing him a glance.

Rage burned within Lucas.

Weren't they together already?

Is this how he took care of her?

Letting her face such danger.

If he had been even a moment later, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

One of Anna's arms wrapped around his shoulder, the other pressed against her still-bleeding neck.

Blood loss made her head spin, but she was acutely aware of the situation.

"Adrian, put me down. Today is your engagement party. I don't want to ruin it because of me," she whispered, her voice faint and weak.

Adrian's arms tightened around her abruptly, his knuckles turning white with strain.

Each step he took was heavy with suppressed fury.

"Shut up if you want to live."

How dare she?

How dare she say such a thing at a time like this?

He wanted to crack open her skull and see what was really going on inside.

Anna didn't dare speak another word, letting him carry her to the car in silence.

Throughout the drive to the hospital, her gaze remained fixed on his injured arm.

"I'm sorry. If it weren't for me..." If not for her, he would be at his engagement party right now, not in this miserable state.

Adrian's lips were pressed into a thin line, as if he were holding back his emotions with great effort.

After a long silence, he finally spoke, his tone cold. "Your dear father called me here on purpose, didn't he? Just to make me miss my own engagement party?"

Anna froze as if struck by lightning.

He knew everything.

Now he must think she's a shameless, wicked woman.

"But he said you weren't feeling well. So why was I met with this scene instead? Did you hire an actor to make it more convincing?"

He glanced at her dismissively, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

Just as cold and distant as when they had first reunited.
###Chapter 380

Anna Ross blurted out, "I didn't!"

How could she ever joke about her own life? She never intended to ruin his engagement.

Adrian Sinclair's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Since I'm already here, drop the act. And what's the deal with that boyfriend of yours? Can't even take care of you properly? Useless."

"?"

Anna froze for a moment before realizing he meant Lucas Evans. But she wasn't even with Lucas.

"Let me out. I can go to the hospital myself. You can still make it back to the engagement party." She turned to look out the window.

Adrian didn't stop. Instead, he slammed on the accelerator. The car surged forward, its speed climbing as if fueled by his rage.

Hearing the words "engagement party" filled him with a restless irritation.

The sudden acceleration made Anna grip the door handle tightly. The car weaved through traffic, narrowly avoiding collisions several times. Her heart pounded in her chest.

What is he so crazy about now!?

The car soon screeched to a halt outside the hospital.

She shot an angry glare at the man beside her and pushed the door open to get out. But at that moment, her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the ground.

Before losing consciousness, she saw doctors and nurses running toward her.

. . . . . .

When Anna woke again, many people were gathered around her bed. Even before opening her eyes, she sensed trouble.

Sure enough, the first thing she heard upon opening them was Chloe Valentine's voice. "Executive Assistant Ross, you're finally awake. We've been waiting so long. Everyone was so worried about you."

Chloe was seething. During yesterday's engagement party, Adrian had defiantly left despite Grandpa Frederick's objections, lying about urgent company business.

He hadn't returned all night, completely ruining the engagement party. If she hadn't had people watching him, she wouldn't have known he'd run off to see this scheming woman!

Anna looked over. Adrian sat by the bed, exhaustion etched on his face. The injury on his hand was bandaged, but traces of blood still seeped through.

"Since she's awake, Adrian, it's time you came back with us." The old man cast a dismissive glance at the bed, his eyes full of disgust.

Anna knew he utterly despised her now. He was only holding back his outburst to maintain his dignity as the family patriarch.

Adrian rubbed his temples. "You all go back first."

"No. Adrian, if you're staying, then I'm staying here with you." Chloe immediately pulled up a chair and sat down, making it clear she wouldn't leave without him today.

She would never give them a chance to be alone. She wasn't that foolish.

The old man snorted coldly. "Adrian, what exactly are you trying to do!?" He spoke too hastily, erupting into a fit of coughing. Adrian turned back, his face filled with concern.
###Chapter 381

Grandpa Lowell coughed violently, his chest heaving.

Adrian Sinclair rushed forward to support the elderly man.

"Grandpa, are you alright?"

Chloe Valentine moved closer, pretending to pat his back while deliberately covering Adrian's hand with her own.

Adrian immediately withdrew his hand.

Chloe's expression darkened instantly.

Grandpa finally stopped coughing and tightly clasped their hands together.

"Adrian, Chloe, my greatest wish is to see you two married."

"This old body won't last much longer..."

He began coughing again.

Anna Ross looked away.

Those intertwined hands stabbed at her eyes painfully.

She knew Grandpa was doing this deliberately for her to see.

Chloe seized the opportunity to flip her wrist, firmly grasping Adrian's hand.

"Don't worry, Grandpa, we'll be fine."

She cast a cold glance toward the hospital bed before flashing a sweet smile.

"Adrian, the engagement party isn't over yet. Let's go back."

Adrian looked toward the hospital bed.

Anna had turned her head away, appearing completely indifferent.

His breath caught as he suppressed his emotions.

"Chloe, my hand is injured. The engagement party might—"

"Are you backing out?" Chloe's tears instantly fell. "I've waited so long."

Her cheeks flushed, looking pitiful and vulnerable.

Grandpa immediately felt hurt, pulling forcefully at Adrian.

"You must get engaged today!"

Chloe lowered her head to hide her triumphant smile.

Grandpa used all his strength to drag him.

Blood seeped through Adrian's sleeve, his face pale.

"Wait!"

Sophia Roscente burst into the hospital room holding her phone.

Everyone froze.

Anna looked up.

Sophia stopped before the hospital bed, glaring at Chloe with disgust.

Chloe's expression stiffened.

Rage nearly overwhelmed her reason.

If not for the Lowell family, she would have torn this girl's face apart long ago!

"Sophia, what mischief are you up to now?" Grandpa narrowed his eyes.

Though eager for the engagement, his granddaughter was also dear to him.

Sophia lit up her phone screen.

"You'll understand after watching this."

She stepped back so Anna could also see the video content.

The moment the footage began playing, Chloe became restless.

Her temples throbbed.

How did she get this?

If Adrian found out...

"Adrian, I'm not feeling well. I want to go back first." She frantically searched for an excuse to escape.

Adrian grabbed her wrist, staring grimly at the video.

Anna covered her mouth.

Unable to believe Chloe would do such a thing.

She actually drugged him.

Sophia spoke at the perfect moment: "Fortunately, I discovered there was surveillance at home."

"Otherwise, cousin would have been wrongly accused."

"Nothing happened between you that night."

She pointed at the video.

Chloe had entered the room for only a few minutes before storming out angrily.

Time passed.

She didn't return to the room until six in the morning.
###Chapter 382

The scene shifted.

Sophia Roscente and her mother pushed the door open and entered.

Chloe Valentine's pupils constricted violently.

Her eyes widened almost to the point of splitting.

Tears welled up, swirling in her gaze.

She looked helplessly toward Grandpa.

Adrian Sinclair's cold gaze swept over her.

His thin lips parted slightly. "Explain."

Chloe trembled from head to toe.

Her lips turned pale.

Explain?

The evidence was right before their eyes.

What explanation could there possibly be?

Anna Ross averted her gaze.

She sighed inwardly.

The Valentine heiress would do such a thing.

All for a man.

Grandpa's expression darkened.

His voice was cold. "I told Chloe to do it."

Adrian stiffened.

He looked at his grandfather in disbelief.

Would Grandpa really do that?

Or was he just protecting Chloe?

"My boy, your grandfather is old."

"My only wish is to see you settle down."

Grandpa pulled Chloe closer to his side.

He patted her hand reassuringly. "I've waited far too long."

Chloe snapped out of her panic.

Secret delight bloomed in her heart.

Not only was Grandpa not blaming her, he was covering for her.

A flicker of guilt passed through Adrian's eyes.

His brow furrowed tightly. "Grandpa, I understand."

"But I need time."

Grandpa let out a long sigh.

He finally relented. "The engagement will be postponed for now."

"I'll give you time."

"But remember this."

"The only person you can marry is Chloe."

He patted the back of Chloe's hand.

A silent signal for her to relax.

Chloe forcefully suppressed her dissatisfaction.

To marry Adrian Sinclair, she could wait.

Since Grandpa had provided a way out, she would naturally take it.

"Grandpa, I was too impatient."

She raised a bright, dazzling smile.

But shadows lurked deep within her eyes. "I'm willing to wait for him."

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted slightly.

A faint, almost mocking smile. "Good."

"Then wait properly."

She was the first to ever dare scheme against him.

"Adrian, that's enough."

Grandpa shot him a warning glance.

He then looked at Sophia. "Sophia, let this matter end here."

Sophia had achieved her goal.

She couldn't be bothered to stir up more trouble.

She casually deleted the video.

Grandpa took one last look at the person on the bed.

He shook his head.

He left, taking Chloe with him.
###Chapter 383

Sophia Roscente hurried to the bedside.

She leaned down and asked softly, "Anna, are you okay?"

"I was only gone for one night. How did you get hurt?"

Her gaze fell on the bandage wrapped around Anna Ross's neck.

She couldn't help but gasp.

Anna was still lost in her earlier shock.

She didn't hear the question at all.

Just then, Adrian Sinclair turned around.

Sophia blinked, realizing she probably shouldn't be here.

"Um, I'll let you two talk. I'm going to buy something."

She stuck out her tongue and quickly ran out of the room.

She carefully closed the door behind her.

Adrian watched for a moment.

He walked slowly to the bed and sat down.

The atmosphere between them became subtly and suffocating.

Neither knew how to break the silence.

Anna pressed a hand to her aching chest.

A sour emotion churned inside her, threatening to consume her.

What was wrong with her?

Hearing their engagement was postponed actually made her feel relieved.

She must be really sick.

Adrian's eyes fixed on the wound on her neck.

His blood pressure spiked instantly.

"Is this how Lucas Evans takes care of you?"

"Your judgment in people is this poor now?"

He didn't know why the thought of her liking such a waste infuriated him.

He wanted to drag that guy over and punch him hard.

Outside the door, Lucas Evans had just finished handling the troublemakers.

He happened to arrive at the room and heard their conversation.

He stopped abruptly.

Anna didn't understand why he was angry.

She looked up at him. "What's your problem? What does this have to do with Lucas?"

She couldn't take it anymore.

This man kept bringing up Lucas over and over, as if he owed him something.

Adrian crossed his long legs and leaned back.

He sneered sarcastically. "Isn't he your boyfriend?"

"He can't even take care of his own girlfriend. What's wrong with me saying a few words?"

"Are you心疼 for him?"

"Who said he's my boyfriend!" Anna was so angry she almost jumped out of bed.

Every conversation with him exhausted her mentally and physically.

Adrian froze for a moment.

Something flickered in his eyes.

Anna simply turned away.

She said, "I'm in a lot of pain right now."

"I don't have time to argue about this dull thing with you."

"Mr. Sinclair should hurry back and accompany your Fiancée."

By the end, she couldn't help sounding angry.

Even she couldn't explain where this emotion came from.

Adrian's eyes slightly lifted at the corners.

A smile gradually appeared on his lips.

Was she Jealous?

"Didn't you like that Lucas Evans the most?"

"Why hasn't he come to see you yet? It seems he doesn't care about you."

He had already noticed the figure moving outside the door.

He just didn't understand why the person didn't come in.

Since that was the case, he didn't mind adding fuel to the fire.

Anna couldn't take it anymore.

She sat up, enduring the pain, and pointed at the door. "Get out!"

"I don't want to hear you say anymore... Mmm."

Her eyes widened in disbelief at the handsome face suddenly close to hers.

Adrian closed his eyes, cupped the back of her head, and sealed her protests with his lips.

He pulled back slightly.

Anna wiped her lips hard and scolded, "Adrian Sinclair, you asshole!"

Before she could finish, he lowered his head again.

He completely seized her slightly parted lips.

Anna was too shocked to speak.

This was a hospital.

People were coming and going outside.

What if someone saw them...
###Chapter 384

Anna Ross caught a glimpse of a figure moving outside the door.

The silhouette felt strangely familiar.

Her chest tightened. Her jaw clenched instinctively.

Adrian Sinclair let out a low hum.

His fingers pressed gently against her cheeks, applying slight pressure.

Her lips parted involuntarily.

His breath swept in, overwhelming and all-encompassing.

Tears welled in the corners of her eyes.

The hand that should have pushed him away instead slowly rose to his shoulder.

This kiss had been too long in coming.

She found herself craving it.

When she saw the video during the day, shock was not her only reaction.

More than that, there was an irrepressible joy.

She knew she shouldn't feel this way.

But her heart had already stopped listening to reason.

Her fingers lightly wrapped around his neck.

Adrian carefully avoided her injury, bending down to meet her.

Outside the door.

Lucas Evans leaned against the cold wall.

The scene he witnessed when he pushed the door open had frozen him in place.

She almost noticed him.

He lowered his head with a bitter smile.

Had he arrived too late after all?

His fist clenched, then relaxed.

Self-mockery filled his eyes.

He had just sent people to deal with the thugs harassing her.

He rushed over, only to walk in on this.

The hospital room door suddenly opened.

Adrian stepped out, a faint smile touching his eyes.

His brow lifted slightly when he saw Lucas. "Aren't you going in, Mr. Evans?"

Lucas's jaw tightened. He forced composure and entered the room.

Adrian moved aside, the curve of his lips deepening.

It was time to make his exit.

Anna was not surprised to see who entered.

She softly invited him to sit.

"Anna, does it still hurt?" Lucas's fingers tightened. "I was delayed by an accident on the road. I'm late."

If he hadn't been tied up with that dispute.

He would never have given Adrian this opportunity.

Anna shook her head. "It's fine. Thank you."

Lucas's back stiffened. "Why are you thanking me?"

He had failed to prevent anything.

This gratitude cut like a knife.

Her smile faded. "Lucas, you're a good man."

"But don't waste your time on me."

He was silent for a moment, then suddenly laughed. "You're overthinking it."

"Right now, I'm just caring for you as a friend."

"You won't even let me be your friend, will you?"

Seeing her hesitant look, he shrugged and added, "My family has set up quite a few blind dates for me."

"I might be off the market soon."

"You really don't need to feel pressured."
###Chapter 385

Anna Ross breathed a sigh of relief, a faint smile touching her lips.
"That's good. I thought—"

"Don't overthink it," Lucas Evans cut her off quickly, his tone deliberately soft.
"Are you hungry? I can get you something to eat."

He was afraid she would ask him to leave the next second.
He couldn't control his own feelings.
The affection he felt years ago had never faded.
Since their reunion, it had only grown more intense, overwhelming him like a tidal wave.

Anna was indeed hungry.
But—

"No, thank you," she said, turning her face away, her voice dropping slightly.
"Adrian Sinclair... he already went to get some."

He had let her go earlier and went straight downstairs to buy breakfast.
If he returned and found Lucas here, she couldn't imagine the scene that would follow.

Lucas's eyes dimmed, his fingers tightening slightly.
"You two... made up?"

Even after all these years apart, that man's gaze still held possessiveness when he looked at her.
If there were no lingering feelings, why would he be so wary of anyone getting close to her?

Anna shook her head quickly, though a faint shadow of sadness flickered in her eyes.
"No. Doesn't he already have a fiancée?"

As the words left her mouth, she froze.
The bitterness hidden in that statement startled even herself.
She clenched the sheets and fell silent.

Lucas felt a sharp pang in his heart.
He suddenly realized Anna's attitude toward Adrian had already subtly changed.
The fear from before had dissipated, replaced by something far more complex.
He clenched his fist, feeling as if something was slipping through his fingers.

Outside the window, the sky was gray and overcast, thick clouds swallowing the sunlight completely.
Anna disliked this oppressive atmosphere and was about to get up to close the curtains when the hospital room door opened.

Vivian Lowell and Howard Lowell walked in one after the other.
"Anna! How did you get hurt like this?" Vivian tossed her bag aside and rushed to the bedside, her hands trembling as she checked her daughter's injuries.

Howard had claimed she was faking illness just to keep Adrian tied down.
But her pale complexion and the bandaged wounds showed no sign of pretense.
Vivian's eyes reddened, her voice choked with emotion.
"You said it wasn't serious? You're in the hospital!"

Anna forced a weak smile, trying to reassure her softly.
"Really, it's nothing, Mom. Don't worry."

But Vivian pressed further.
"What exactly happened? Was someone trying to—"

Anna's fingers twitched.
The terror from last night rushed back.
If Adrian hadn't arrived in time...
She didn't dare think about it, only gripping her mother's hand tightly.
"It's over now."

Vivian finally noticed Lucas standing nearby and asked hesitantly, "And this is...?"

Howard shot a cold glance his way.
He had noticed this unfamiliar man the moment they entered.
Whoever he was, if he dared to interfere with the plan, Howard wouldn't hesitate to remove him.

Lucas took a step forward, nodding politely.
"Hello, ma'am. I'm Lucas Evans, Anna's university classmate and friend."
###Chapter 386

Howard Lowell snorted coldly.

This guy was definitely more than just a friend.

"If you're friends, why didn't we know about it?" Howard's tone was aggressive.

Anna Ross found it ridiculous.

He was never close to her.

It was perfectly normal for him not to know her friends.

Lucas Evans smiled. "Yuan Yuan and I haven't seen each other much since college. It's normal you wouldn't know."

Howard's lips curved faintly. He said nothing more.

Anna ignored him and turned to chat with Vivian Lowell.

Vivian had been in good spirits lately.

The pallor on her face was gone, replaced by a healthy glow.

She seemed to be doing well overall.

Anna couldn't help but wonder if Howard was actually treating her mother right.

She glanced at the man and dismissed the thought.

He had hurt them so deeply before.

Adrian Sinclair returned with breakfast.

His gaze turned cold when he saw Howard.

He gave them a slight nod.

Anna caught the look.

Howard had ruined his engagement party yesterday.

He must still be holding a grudge.

"Xiao Chuan, thank goodness you were there last night. Who knows what would have happened to Anna otherwise." Howard made a show of reaching out to clap his shoulder.

His smile was broad but insincere.

Adrian walked past Lucas with the breakfast.

He went straight to the bedside and handed it to her.

"Eat something first."

Vivian moved aside on her own, standing next to Howard.

Anna took the breakfast and began eating with her head down.

She was indeed hungry.

"Yuan Yuan, do you want some water? I'll get it for you." Lucas was completely blocked by Adrian and couldn't see the person on the bed.

The instigator stood with his arms crossed, looking perfectly at ease.

Anna looked up but couldn't see him.

"No need. She's my subordinate. Fetching water isn't your concern." Adrian refused first and stepped forward to pour a cup of water.

"...Thank you." Anna's eye twitched slightly. She took the water but didn't drink it.

She wasn't thirsty.

Neither of them gave her a chance to refuse.

Howard watched for a moment, clearly sensing the tension.

He laughed it off. "Xiao Chuan is very thoughtful, Anna. You should thank your cousin properly. Take him out for a meal when you have time, understand?"

Before Anna could speak, Adrian responded first.

"No need for formalities, Uncle. If she really wants to thank me, she can put more effort into her work at the company."

Howard's face instantly stiffened.

His eyes fixed intently on Adrian.

Had he been discovered?

But he quickly dismissed the thought.

Impossible.

He was always very careful at the company.

No one could have found out.
###Chapter 387

Howard Lowell's eyes shifted slightly.

He offered an ingratiating smile. "Of course. I wouldn't want to let you down after all your effort, Adrian." He was referring to the job transfer.

Adrian Sinclair leaned back lazily against the hospital bed.

His tone was detached. "Actually, it was Grandpa's idea. Thank him if you want. You should visit him more often."

Howard was stunned.

The old man had been thoroughly disappointed in him. Why would he suddenly entrust him with such an important position? It was highly unusual.

He needed to sound out the old man's intentions as soon as possible.

Had his years of effort finally been recognized? Could corporate power finally be within his grasp? Howard grew more excited the longer he thought about it.

Anna Ross was equally surprised.

She had assumed it was Adrian's doing. She never expected it to be the old man's directive.

Adrian watched his expression closely.

He had merely mentioned it offhand. His real curiosity was about what this uncle of his actually wanted.

And Anna. What secret was she hiding?

Anna ate her breakfast quietly.

She appeared focused, but she absorbed every word of their conversation.

A brief silence fell over the room.

All three were lost in their own thoughts.

Vivian Lowell seemed about to say something.

Howard grabbed her arm firmly.

He lowered his voice. "Let's give them some space. We should go."

He glanced at the irritating Lucas Evans nearby.

Remembering he still needed Anna's help, he suppressed his displeasure.

Howard turned to the hospital bed.

He forced a smile. "Anna, rest well. I'm taking your mother home now."

Seeing his eagerness to leave, Anna understood completely.

Even now, he still hoped to use her to get closer to Adrian.

Vivian called out from a distance. "Sweetheart, stay in bed and rest. I'll visit again when I have time."

Anna's heart ached with reluctance.

Last time she was hospitalized, she couldn't spend much time with her mother. Now they were parting hurriedly again.

But she knew Howard would never let her mother stay alone.

She offered a bright smile. "Don't worry, Mom. I'll visit you as soon as I'm better."

Vivian seemed slightly reassured.

Howard turned to Adrian.

His smile was obsequious. "Adrian, please take good care of Anna."

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted slightly.

He gave a faint nod.

As they left, Vivian looked back repeatedly.

She was ultimately dragged away by Howard.

For the sake of their future, she had to endure the pain of leaving her daughter behind.

The door closed.

Adrian looked down at the figure by the bed.

He suddenly chuckled. "Executive Assistant Ross, don't you find this room a bit stuffy?"

Anna had intended to ignore him.

Hearing this, she glanced at him. The room was clearly cool. This man really was abnormal.

She replied offhandedly, "If you're hot, open a window yourself."
###Chapter 388

She furrowed her brows.

The stinging pain in her neck made her uncomfortable.

Adrian Sinclair's expression shifted slightly.

Seeing her complexion improve, he remained silent.

"Lucas, you should go back now. I'm fine here." Anna Ross offered a faint smile.

Lucas Evans nodded gently. "Alright. I had something to discuss with you, but since someone else is here, we can talk another time."

He deliberately glanced toward the man beside him.

As expected, Adrian's brow instantly furrowed tightly.

A cold gaze shot directly toward them.

Anna's heart clenched.

She feared they might come to blows like before.

Yet Lucas rose calmly.

The moment he turned, frost gathered in his eyes.

No matter how hard he tried, he could never measure up to Adrian Sinclair.

The door opened and closed.

It was like the gathering and parting of people.

Only the two of them remained in the hospital room.

Adrian sat back down by the bed.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "Were you scared?"

Anna choked, coughing several times.

She set down the meal box and wiped her mouth. "What would I be scared of?"

"Scared I would harm him." Adrian's voice turned cold abruptly.

He walked to the window and looked down at the empty lawn below.

Anna sighed helplessly. "I don't have feelings for anyone. Stop projecting your assumptions onto me."

Why did he stubbornly believe her heart belonged to Lucas?

Adrian stood silently.

His back was shrouded in shadow, difficult to read.

She watched him.

Suddenly, she remembered that night.

The image of him embracing Chloe Valentine on the terrace flashed in her mind.

Lost in thought, he suddenly turned and approached.

"There's something I need to discuss with you."

His fingertips tapped lightly on the bed railing.

It produced a rhythmic, soft sound.

Anna lowered her gaze. "What is there to discuss between us?"

Adrian didn't get angry.

He only asked suddenly, "Were you angry about transferring you to the HR Department?"

She nearly laughed. "I was thrilled. A quieter place suits me perfectly."

Though she initially felt some resentment, it wasn't bad to keep an eye on Howard Lowell this way.

A inexplicable anger surged within Adrian.

She always easily stirred his emotions like this.

Was leaving his side so joyful?

He finally replied calmly, "Hmm. As long as you're happy."

Anna looked up at him.

Since their reunion, he had been unpredictable.

Often angry for no reason.
###Chapter 389

Forget it.

She didn't want to probe his thoughts anyway. He could think whatever he wanted.

Anna Ross didn't wish to speak with him any longer.

She slowly lay back down, intending to sleep.

But she accidentally brushed against her injury.

A soft gasp of pain escaped her lips.

Adrian Sinclair lowered his arm.

He strode over quickly to support her.

His expression was dark as he gently helped her lie back on the bed.

"How can someone be so clumsy?"

He couldn't resist adding a cold, mocking remark.

"......"

Anna had no energy to retort.

She simply closed her eyes and ignored him.

No one would think he was mute if he stayed quiet. Why did he always have to add such comments?

Adrian looked down at the person on the bed.

He schooled his expression.

In a low voice, he asked, "I'm short-handed right now."

"How about you come back and work for me?"

He finished with a light cough, his gaze shifting away.

Anna peeked out from under the covers.

Seeing his proud and aloof demeanor, she almost laughed.

"If you're short-handed, why didn't you say so earlier?"

"I could have asked your uncle to hire more new people."

"Also, you could have Miss Valentine assist you. Wouldn't that work?"

"You!"

Adrian paused.

He leaned forward, looking down at the person on the bed.

A slight smile touched his lips.

"Miss Valentine? I couldn't bear to see her work hard."

"So I'd still prefer if you came."

Anna's expression shifted.

She pressed her lips together.

"Right. Of course."

What did he mean?

He couldn't bear to see Miss Valentine work hard, but he was fine with her working herself to the bone?

The smile on Adrian's face lingered.

For some reason, he was in a very good mood now.

Much better than before.

Anna said nothing more.

She lay still in bed, gradually growing drowsy.

Adrian sat by her bedside, keeping her company.

He didn't leave.

He stayed with her the entire morning.

Faint sunlight streamed through the window.

It felt warm and comforting on her skin.

Anna felt very comfortable and was nearly asleep.

However, a sudden phone ringtone shattered the room's tranquility.

It also chased away her sleepiness.

She opened her eyes, listening for his movements.

Seeing the person sleeping soundly on the bed, Adrian frowned slightly.

He immediately picked up his phone and silenced the ring.

He was about to toss the phone aside.

But upon seeing the caller ID, he answered it.

Anna was still worried she might overhear something she shouldn't.

Adrian was already walking out with his phone.

His footsteps were light.

The door closed softly, as if he was afraid of waking her.

Anna turned her head, looking at the closed door.

Now she could hear the beat of her own heart.

She had thought that after everything that happened, she would hate him.

She thought she wouldn't want to see him again.

But after meeting him, she didn't seem to resist as much as she imagined.

Could it be that she was developing feelings she shouldn't?

Anna was startled by her own thoughts.

She blinked at the ceiling.

But he already had a girlfriend.

What was she thinking?

Was she going to become the kind of person she despised the most?

No matter what, she could not break someone else's relationship.

"What are you thinking about so deeply?"

"I thought you were asleep."

Adrian pushed the door open and came in.

He saw her frowning, occasionally pinching herself in a comical manner.
###Chapter 390

Anna Ross was startled.

She turned to look at the doorway.

Adrian Sinclair stood there.

His gaze swept over her indifferently.

"I thought you left?"

She lowered her head guiltily.

Her fingers unconsciously twisted the corner of the bedsheet.

Adrian stepped inside.

"Just took a phone call."

His voice gave nothing away.

"Were you that eager for me to leave?"

Anna was speechless.

Her cheeks warmed slightly.

Thankfully, he hadn't witnessed her earlier actions.

That would have been mortifying.

"I'm heading back to the office soon."

He adjusted his cuff.

His tone remained flat.

"I've already asked Sophia to come keep you company."

Anna paused.

She hadn't expected him to arrange this.

"There's no need to trouble Sophia."

She spoke softly.

"I'll be fine on my own."

Adrian didn't respond.

The doctor entered just then.

He turned and exchanged a few quiet words with the physician.

Then he left the room.

The doctor carefully examined her injuries.

He asked a few questions.

By the time the doctor left, familiar voices echoed from the hallway.

"Mom, slow down!"

Sophia Roscente carried numerous bags, panting heavily.

"There's no way Anna can eat all this right now."

Cecilia Roscente freed a hand to gently pat her daughter.

"Mind your tone with me."

Her voice held a chiding affection.

Sophia rubbed her head, feigning injury.

"You always play favorites."

Despite her words, her eyes sparkled with amusement.

Cecilia shook her head helplessly.

She pushed the hospital room door open.

Her expression immediately softened with concern upon seeing Anna.

"Anna, are you feeling any better?"

Anna tried to sit up.

Cecilia gently pressed her back down.

"Just rest."

She tenderly straightened the bedsheet.

"Don't stand on ceremony with me."

Sophia set down the packages and approached.

She pouted playfully.

"You never fuss over me, Mom."

Her eyes twinkled with mischief.

Anna looked at the room filled with gifts.

Warmth flooded her heart.

It was just a minor injury.

Yet so many people cared.

Cecilia turned to her daughter.

Her eyes held a gentle smile.

"Sophia."
###Chapter 391

Sophia Roscente immediately sat back down beside her, well-behaved.

She playfully winked at Anna Ross.

Anna couldn't help but chuckle softly.

Sophia was like a little princess from a fairy tale.

She was always carefree and protected.

Cecilia Roscente studied Anna's slightly pale face.

She sighed with heartache. "Anna, Adrian he..."

Sophia had already told her everything.

Anna probably knew it all.

But Cecilia didn't know what she was thinking now.

Anna guessed what she wanted to ask.

But she didn't want to talk about Adrian Sinclair right now.

She changed the subject. "Is Sophia starting school soon?"

"When exactly are you leaving? I want to see you off."

Sophia's eyes immediately lit up.

She happily grabbed Anna's hand. "In one week!"

"You're really coming to see me off, sis?"

"Of course. I'll definitely be there." Anna gently patted her hand.

She secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

The topic was finally diverted.

Once school was mentioned, Sophia chattered excitedly.

Cecilia couldn't get a word in.

She had no choice but to listen quietly.

Later, she joined the conversation too.

The three of them chatted from the bright afternoon sun until the dusk glow faded.

On the other side.

Chloe Valentine threw herself into her mother's arms.

She cried like a delicate flower drenched in rain. "Mom, I hate Anna Ross!"

Mrs. Valentine saw her precious daughter wronged.

She instantly burned with anger.

But she suppressed her emotions first.

Comforting her daughter was more important.

She helped Chloe up.

She gently wiped away her tear stains with a tissue. "Don't cry, Chloe."

"Your father and I have your back."

She couldn't bear to lay a finger on her daughter since childhood.

How could she tolerate her being wronged like this outside?

Chloe sobbed. "Mom, that bitch Anna Ross seduces Adrian all day long!"

"She even ruined our engagement party!"

That night should have been her happiest moment.

Her family came on purpose.

All her friends and relatives were there.

Everything was ruined by Anna.

She hated her.

She wished she were dead!

Mrs. Valentine understood her daughter's feelings.

The more she understood, the more her heart ached.

She was there that night too.

Adrian suddenly said he had urgent business and left before the ceremony.

He never returned.

She thought it was some important matter.

Turns out it was for a woman!

"Sweetie, I know you're sad."

"Tell me, do you still want to marry Adrian Sinclair?" She gently stroked her daughter's hair.

Her eyes were soft.

Chloe was stunned.

Then she said firmly, "Of course I do!"

"This is what I've always dreamed of!"

How could she not want to marry him?

Even if she died, she would persist to the end.

Otherwise, how would her friends mock her?

Mrs. Valentine sighed.

She originally thought if her daughter didn't like him anymore, she would出面 withdraw from the engagement.

But since her daughter insisted, they would have to take matters into their own hands.

Chloe didn't understand. "Mom, why did you ask that?"

"Do you also think I'm not good enough for Adrian?"
###Chapter 392

"Chloe, in my eyes, you are the best girl in the world."

Mrs. Valentine gripped her daughter's hand, her gaze intense.

"Not just Adrian Sinclair, you deserve a man a hundred times better than him."

Chloe's vanity swelled, finally bringing a smile to her face.

"Mom, don't worry." She squeezed her mother's hand back, fingers trembling slightly.

"My hatred is for Anna Ross. As for the marriage with Adrian—I will never back down."

She clenched her jaw, her eyes clouded with darkness.

Anna was just an insignificant obstacle. A light crush would reduce her to dust.

A shrewd glint flashed in Mrs. Valentine's eyes. Adrian was the most sought-after marriage prospect in New York.

Securing this union would allow the Valentines to dominate the city's high society unchallenged.

She picked up a handful of sunflower seeds, cracking them slowly.

"Chloe, you need to learn how I handled your father back in the day." She spat out a shell, smiling faintly.

"A man's heart must be firmly in your grasp."

Chloe frowned. She had tried. But every time she got close, Adrian found an excuse to avoid her.

She couldn't even touch the hem of his shirt. The thought made her massage her temples in frustration.

"Mom, what should I do then?"

Mrs. Valentine set down the seeds, brushing the crumbs from her hands.

"Come here." She lowered her voice, a sly smile curling her lips.

Chloe leaned in. As she listened, her smile widened.

Adrian Sinclair. He was destined to be hers.

......

Lowell Group Headquarters.

Adrian stared darkly at the rejected proposal. Noah Watson stood nearby, barely breathing.

The mood of this stern taskmaster was clearly at its worst. No one dared to disturb him now.

After a long silence, Adrian finally set down the file and leaned heavily into his leather chair.

He closed his eyes, pressing his fingers against his temples.

This was the second rejection. The multinational project was crucial for the Lowell Group.

It seemed he would have to fly out personally.

"Noah." He opened his eyes suddenly and walked toward the coffee machine. "Any movement from Howard Lowell recently?"

Black coffee burned his throat, its bitterness spreading. He frowned slightly.

"He's been quiet, following all the rules at work." Noah reported respectfully. "But he's been meeting with one person frequently."

"Oh?" Adrian scoffed. "Who?"

He had already stationed people to watch Howard's every move. Nothing escaped his notice.

But he was more interested in the secret between Howard and Anna Ross. What was it?

Noah pulled up a photo on his phone and handed it over. "This person."

Adrian glanced at the screen, a smirk tugging at his lips. "As expected." Who else would Howard turn to?
###Chapter 393

Noah Watson looked at the man strategizing before him.

A chill ran down his spine.

If he ever became this man's enemy, he stood no chance.

Adrian Sinclair returned to work despite his injury.

He waved his hand dismissively.

"Get back to work. Keep monitoring the situation."

Noah acknowledged the order and left the office.

He headed toward the printer.

As he departed, Chloe Valentine appeared at the end of the hallway.

She paused outside the door and pulled out a compact mirror.

Her eyes were slightly swollen in the reflection.

She pressed her lips together in frustration.

She regretted crying so intensely earlier.

After touching up her makeup, she gently pushed the office door open.

Adrian was about to check his wound but withdrew his hand at the sound.

His gaze turned cold when he saw who it was.

Chloe tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear.

She approached him slowly.

"Adrian, are you busy right now?" she asked softly.

"What is it?" He glanced up briefly before returning to his documents.

An awkward tension had lingered between them since the incident.

He had no desire to look at her any longer than necessary.

Chloe felt nervous but remembered her mother's advice.

To marry this man, she needed to stabilize their relationship first.

"I came to apologize." Her eyes welled up as she bit her lip. "I was too impulsive last time. I acted foolishly."

"Can you forgive me?"

Adrian let out a derisive snort and leaned back in his chair.

He stared at the ceiling and exhaled deeply.

What difference did forgiveness make?

Nothing had happened anyway.

Even without forgiveness, what could change?

Grandpa's stance remained firm.

"Didn't Grandpa say it was his idea?" Adrian stood and walked to the bookshelf.

He pulled out a file.

Chloe watched his shadow, both captivated and afraid.

This man was too dazzling.

His talent and appearance were utterly captivating.

Yet he always treated others with ice-cold detachment.

If he truly decided to pursue the matter, she would be powerless.

"Adrian, I know I was wrong." She looked at him hopefully. "Let me treat you to dinner to make up for it?"

Adrian checked through documents in silence.

Chloe quickly took out her phone.

She showed him a pre-made dining guide.

"MILIT Restaurant launched a new menu. It has excellent reviews." She forced a smile. "Shall we try it?"

Adrian finally looked up, his expression indifferent.

"It depends. I'll go if I'm free."

He sat back down and began annotating files.

Chloe gazed at the man so close yet so distant.

He was within reach, yet an invisible barrier stood between them.
###Chapter 394

She lowered her gaze.

She tried to appear obedient.

"Alright, I'll come find you after work."

She never received the response she wanted.

Adrian Sinclair didn't look up.

He remained focused on his work.

Chloe Valentine bit her lip and stood still.

She glanced at him unwillingly several times.

Finally, she had no choice but to turn and leave.

She secretly made up her mind.

She would come back after work and wait.

She couldn't allow any mistakes.

In the hospital room.

Anna Ross slowly got up.

She supported herself against the wall as she walked toward the restroom.

Sophia Roscente and Cecilia Roscente had urgent matters.

They left the hospital early.

The empty room held only her.

The sky darkened outside.

She returned from the restroom.

She stood quietly by the window, gazing at the night sky.

Waking up to an empty room felt like being abandoned by the whole world.

Fortunately, the pain in her neck had subsided.

She leaned against the windowsill, lost in thought.

She didn't notice the movement behind her.

Adrian Sinclair stood at the doorway.

He watched her slender shadow.

Three years had passed, but she hadn't changed at all.

A cool breeze blew in.

Anna shivered and closed the window.

Turning around, she met his intense gaze.

She froze for a moment.

He had clearly been watching her for some time.

"When did you get here?"

Why hadn't she heard him?

Adrian lifted a food container.

He placed the dishes on the table one by one.

"Just now. You were too focused to notice."

His voice was still calm.

But it no longer felt cold or hurtful.

Anna walked over slowly.

She sat down on the edge of the bed.

She stared blankly at the steaming food.

He was the one taking care of her now.

He was the one staying by her side.

"Stop daydreaming."

"You need to eat to recover quickly."

He handed her a fork and knife, his tone neutral.

She took the utensils.

She picked up some food and ate slowly.

Her eyes suddenly felt moist.

Her mother was controlled by Howard Lowell.

Even her company had become a luxury.

Her best friend had returned to San Francisco due to family matters.

Adrian sat not far away.

He noticed the tears glistening in her eyes.

His brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.

Why was she alone in the room?

He took out his phone and called Sophia Roscente.

He learned that Marcus Hill had an emergency.

She promised to return and apologize later.

Adrian rubbed his temples.

He put his phone back in his pocket.

"Mr. Evans, the meeting isn't over yet!"

"Why are you in such a hurry to get to the hospital?"

Hurried footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Lucas Evans walked quickly ahead.

His assistant followed breathlessly, carrying a food container.

The assistant couldn't understand the rush.

Why hurry so much for a hospital visit?

Lucas suddenly stopped outside a room.

His expression froze.

The assistant peered inside—

A man and a woman were in the room together.
###Chapter 395

Lucas Evans stood at the hospital room door.

He watched the two figures standing side by side inside.

His footsteps halted.

In the end, he did not push the door open.

He was too late once again.

A self-mocking smile tugged at Lucas's lips.

He turned and walked away without a word.

His assistant hurried after him.

"Mr. Evans," the assistant called out anxiously. "What should we do with these specially prepared meals?"

"Throw them away," Lucas replied coldly without looking back.

The assistant looked down at the exquisite food containers.

He couldn't help but feel it was a shame.

These were custom-ordered from a top-tier restaurant.

It seemed such a waste to discard them.

Perhaps he could ask if he could keep them for himself.

......

After two days of rest at the hospital, Anna Ross was finally discharged.

The fresh outdoor air lifted her spirits.

At least she was no longer confined to that stifling hospital room.

She raised her hand to hail a taxi.

A crisp car horn sounded beside her.

Looking up, she recognized the familiar black Maybach.

Adrian Sinclair sat inside.

He wore gold-rimmed glasses today.

His entire demeanor seemed different from usual.

Less sharp and intimidating.

More refined and gentle.

"Get in," he said flatly.

Anna didn't hesitate.

She opened the door and slid into the passenger seat.

She knew very well.

Even if she refused, he would force her into the car.

But why had he specifically come to pick her up?

Just recently he had been ice-cold toward her.

Acting as if he wanted her completely out of his sight.

Adrian glanced at her.

He started the engine. "Don't misunderstand. I'm just taking you back to work."

Anna nearly bit her tongue.

Of course she had thought too much.

There was no way he had good intentions.

"Don't worry. I wasn't thinking anything," she replied evenly.

She turned to look out the window.

A faint smile flickered in Adrian's eyes.

Her reaction was rather amusing.

The car drove smoothly.

But Anna's thoughts wandered far away.

After the engagement turmoil, she wondered what tasks Howard Lowell would assign her back at the company.

Since her transfer to the HR Department, things had been unusually quiet from Howard's side.

But this silence made her uneasy.

She felt undercurrents brewing beneath the surface.

Adrian glanced at her occasionally.

He spoke suddenly. "Where do you want to go now?"

"Aren't we going to the company?" Anna asked, confused.

He had just said he was taking her to work.

Why change his mind now?

Adrian tapped his fingers on the steering wheel.

His tone was calm. "Take the day off."

"Tomorrow, we're going abroad together."

"What!?" Anna was completely stunned.

What did he mean by suddenly going abroad?

The man took a moment to look at her.

His gaze was probing. "Are you surprised, Executive Assistant Ross?"

Did she think he was going to do something to her?

Anna gripped the seatbelt tightly.

She tried to calm her racing heart.

She needed answers first. "What's the purpose of going abroad? I'm perfectly fine here in New York. I have no plans to leave right now."

This decision was too sudden.

Everything about it felt suspicious.

Adrian studied her for a moment longer.

The corner of his mouth twitched.

He finally couldn't hold back a low chuckle.

It was as if he had heard something incredibly amusing.

Anna looked at him, puzzled.

She didn't understand what was so funny.

Was what she said really that humorous?
###Chapter 396

Adrian Sinclair laughed at her changing expression.
"You didn't think I was taking you to elope, did you?"

"Don't flatter yourself!" Anna Ross's ears burned.
She turned away, refusing to look at him.

Adrian's playful mood faded.
His tone turned serious.
"This trip is for a Cross-border cooperation case."
"The project is vital to the company's future strategy."

Anna felt slightly relieved, but still confused.
"There are many capable people at the company. Why choose me?"

His fingers tapped lightly on the steering wheel.
"You're my Executive Assistant. It's only natural you come along."

Anna remembered their past disagreements.
She reminded him calmly, "Someone specifically said I wasn't his assistant anymore."

Adrian's eyes darkened. His voice turned firm.
"I'm the boss. What I say goes."

Anna didn't argue further. She turned to look out the window.

The car came to a stop. As she moved to exit, Adrian stopped her.
"Get some proper rest. I'll send the documents later."
"I'll pick you up tomorrow morning."

Anna closed the car door gently.
She watched the car drive away.

Back home, she packed a simple suitcase.
Then she collapsed into bed.

She hadn't slept well at all during her hospital stay.

The ringing phone woke her in the evening.

Mia Lawrence's anxious voice came through.
"Anna! I heard you were injured and hospitalized!?"

Anna rubbed her eyes and sat up.
"I'm already discharged. Don't worry."

A knock sounded at her door immediately after.

Mia rushed in and began inspecting her.
Her eyes welled up at the sight of the bandage on Anna's neck.

"How did this happen!?" Her voice trembled.

Anna patted her hand reassuringly.
"It's fine. They used the best medicine. It won't scar."

Mia clenched her fists.
"Tell me. Who did this to you?"

Anna lowered her gaze.
She spoke softly.
"It was an accident."
###Chapter 397

Mia Lawrence widened her eyes, poking Anna Ross's shoulder in frustration.

"You're hurt this badly and still hiding it from me?"

"Tell me, how did this happen?"

Anna sighed softly, pulling her into the living room.

"It really doesn't hurt anymore. Please stop asking."

They sank into the sofa, snack bags rustling.

Mia glanced around the room and suddenly made a surprised sound.

"Where's your little cousin?"

"Last time I visited, it was quite lively here."

Anna tore open a bread wrapper, her gaze sweeping across the TV screen.

"She went back to her mom's place. She hasn't been back these past few days."

Mia nodded vaguely while chewing on potato chips.

She suddenly put down her snack, her expression darkening.

"This time when I came back... my parents had a huge fight."

"It was really bad."

She always escaped to San Francisco, partly to avoid blind dates, partly to escape the arguments.

Anna's hand holding the remote paused.

"Try to talk some sense into them."

She didn't continue.

She hadn't even met her own father. What could she say?

Mia slumped back into the cushions, waving a hand.

"Can't be bothered. Talking more just makes it worse."
She suddenly turned over, her eyes lighting up.

"Oh right! Anna, you have to help me!"

Anna blinked in confusion.

"Help with what?"

Mia leaned close to her ear, lowering her voice to a whisper.

—

At the same moment, strobe lights flashed wildly in the photography studio.

Sophia Roscente struck a pose, then suddenly sneezed twice in a row.

The instant she rubbed her nose, Marcus Hill snapped a picture with a mischievous grin.

"Haha, Sophia, look at this!"
He held up his phone, shaking with laughter.

Sophia snatched the phone and instantly bristled.

"What kind of awful photo is this!"
The picture showed her scrunching her face while rubbing her nose, looking ridiculously ugly.

Marcus dodged her punches, grinning as he protected his phone.

"It's adorable. I'm setting it as my wallpaper to look at every day."

"You wouldn't dare!" Sophia lunged to grab the phone.
"I sent you so many beautiful photos, and you choose to use this one instead!"

"Delete it! Now! Immediately!"
###Chapter 398

Marcus Hill laughed as he dodged her attempt to grab the phone.

He placed a hand on top of her head.

She jumped up and down but still couldn't reach it.

He found her increasingly adorable the more he watched.

His fondness for her grew with each passing moment.

Sophia Roscente couldn't snatch the phone back.

She stamped her foot in frustration.

Her lips formed a pout.

She crossed her arms and turned away.

"Hmph, do whatever you want. I'm ignoring you now."

Marcus immediately grew concerned.

He put his phone away and went to soothe her.

"Sophia, don't be angry."

"I wasn't making fun of you."

"That photo is genuinely cute."

He took her hand in his.

Holding it tightly in his palm.

As if cradling something precious.

His gaze was incredibly tender.

Sophia felt her face grow warm under his stare.

She turned her head slightly away.

"What's so cute about it?"

"You were definitely laughing at me."

She had sneaked out today for their date.

Hoping to take some beautiful pictures.

Now he had ruined everything.

Marcus remained gentle.

He cupped her face in his hands.

And softly kissed her forehead.

"Really, I'm not lying."

"Your photo is especially adorable."

Sophia's almond-shaped eyes widened.

It took her a moment to process what happened.

Had he just kissed her?

This was their first intimate contact since they started dating.

Her heart fluttered like a startled deer.

Pounding so hard it almost hurt.

Marcus felt nervous too.

Worried the young girl might be upset.

They had never been this intimate before.

He feared he had been too forward.

"Um, Marcus."

"I want some cotton candy."

Sophia pointed toward a nearby stall.

Keeping her head down to hide her expression.

Marcus raised an eyebrow.

"Alright, I'll get it for you."

He smiled and ruffled her hair.

Then jogged off to buy the cotton candy.

Sophia stood there with a flushed face.

She shifted her position slightly.

Her fingers touched her forehead.

The warm sensation of his kiss still lingered.

So this was what a kiss felt like.

How magical.

She found herself liking it.

Without realizing.

The corners of her mouth lifted slightly.

Forming a sweet curve.

A gentle breeze swept by.

Lifting her smooth long hair.

It floated softly in the wind.

Like a beautiful painting.

Marcus glanced back unintentionally.

And saw this scene.

He couldn't suppress the joy in his heart.

A wide grin spread across his face.

He liked her even more than he had imagined.

When they first got together.

Sophia had always been cautious.

But now something seemed different.

Soon enough.

Marcus returned holding an enormous cotton candy.

He presented it to her.

Sophia's eyes widened in surprise.

The cotton candy was several times larger than her head.

She doubted she could finish it all.

Watching her accept the candy with a dazed expression.

Warmed Marcus's heart.

He wanted to kiss her again.

But feared moving too fast might scare the young girl.

He suppressed his restless emotions.

Sophia took a small bite of the cotton candy.

So sweet.

Even the air seemed infused with sugar.

"Sophia."

"Shall I take you to play over there?"

Marcus turned her shoulders.

Pointing toward the Pendulum Ride in the amusement park.

She had taken him on it during their first date.

He had been terrified back then.

And even embarrassed himself.

This time he wanted to make a different impression.
###Chapter 399

On their first date, she dragged him onto a roller coaster.
He had turned pale with fear.
He even vomited in public.
This time, he was determined to redeem himself.

"Great!" Sophia Roscente jumped with excitement.
She laughed, grabbing his hand and pulling him toward the ride.
Marcus Hill interlaced his fingers tightly with hers.
He led the way forward.

But he soon regretted it.
Though he tried hard not to show it.
His greenish complexion gave him away.
Sophia studied his tense profile for a moment.
She couldn't help but laugh. "Marcus, your expression is hilarious right now."
"Just throw up if you need to."
She had noticed earlier on the roller coaster.
He was gripping the safety bar so tightly.
His knuckles had turned white.

Marcus waved his hand dismissively.
He pulled her quickly into a nearby Starbucks.
It seemed his usual physical training wasn't enough.
He would need to double his practice sessions when he got back.

。。。。。。

Late at night.
Anna Ross received a file from Adrian Sinclair.
She stared at the dense document.
It made her head spin.
He was definitely doing this on purpose.
Choosing this exact time to torment her.

Early the next morning.
Her phone rang sharply.
Anna jolted awake from her sleep.
She nearly threw her phone when she saw the caller ID.
"What is it?" She pulled the blankets tighter, not wanting to engage.

Adrian leaned against his car.
He looked up toward her window.
His voice came through the receiver. "Did you forget about the business trip today?"
He glanced at his watch. "The flight takes off in one hour."

What!?
Anna sat up abruptly.
All sleepiness vanished instantly.
She had completely forgotten about it.
She hadn't even packed her luggage yet.

The call had already ended.
She scrambled out of bed to wash up.
She haphazardly threw some clothes into her suitcase.
She nearly tripped while rushing downstairs.

The black Maybach was parked by the roadside.
She pulled the car door open, breathing heavily.
Adrian eyed her disheveled hair.
The corner of his mouth lifted. "You're not slow, at least."

"......"
Anna fastened her seatbelt before retorting. "Such an early flight."
"You never told me the specific time."
"Of course I woke up according to my normal schedule."
She glared at him as the engine started. "Besides, why did you insist on bringing me?"
"Wouldn't things be simpler if you took someone else?"

Adrian turned the steering wheel lightly.
Amusement flickered in his eyes. "I felt like it."
"Since when do you get a say?"

Anna was left speechless.
She simply lowered her head to play with her phone.
Ignoring this unreasonable man.
The car finally fell silent.
Only the steady hum of the engine remained.
###Chapter 400

Anna Ross's phone screen kept lighting up.

She stared at the flashing name.

Her finger hovered over the answer button.

Finally, she swiped to mute it.

Adrian Sinclair glanced sideways at the caller ID.

The name Lucas Evans stabbed into his vision.

The corner of his mouth lifted into a cold curve.

"Checking up on you this early?"
"He certainly keeps a close watch."

Anna silently put her phone away.

She didn't respond.

Lucas set down the unanswered phone.

It was tossed into the corner of the sofa.

He walked to the window.

Morning light streamed through the glass onto his face.

A strange emptiness settled in his heart.

It felt like something important was slipping away.

He couldn't grasp it.

The only person he could think of was her.

But the call remained unanswered.

Maybe she was still asleep.

Yet a sense of unease lingered.

He grabbed his jacket and went downstairs.

He decided to wait outside her apartment.

He would drive her to work himself.

At the airport terminal.

Anna reached for the duffel bag.

Adrian turned sideways to avoid her.

"Check the tickets first."
His tone brooked no argument.
"Don't waste time."

She withdrew her hand.

Silently following him.

The VIP lane was clear and unobstructed.

After boarding, a flight attendant softly reminded them the flight was about to take off.

Anna looked down, wanting to text her mother.

Her phone was suddenly snatched away.

Adrian powered it off and shoved it back into her bag.

"What are you doing?"
She couldn't help raising her voice.

He adjusted his seatback.

Closing his eyes as if dozing.
"The plane is about to take off."
"Whatever it is, we'll talk after landing."
He paused, then added another jab.
"Are you that afraid he'll worry?"

Anna glared at him.

Just then, his phone rang.

The screen lit up with the name Chloe Valentine.

She immediately reached over and grabbed it.

Swiftly powering it off.
"The plane is taking off now."
"No calls."

Adrian raised an eyebrow, looking at her.

Amusement flickered in his eyes.
"Not letting me take her call?"
"Jealous?"

Anna turned her face away.

Muttering under her breath.
"Narcissist."

The roar of the engines drowned out her words.

The plane shot into the clouds.
###Chapter 401

The flight was rather dull.

Anna Ross flipped through a magazine to pass the time.

She gradually grew drowsy.

She leaned back in her seat and drifted into a hazy sleep.

She woke again as the plane touched down.

Adrian Sinclair was retrieving their luggage.

Seeing her awake, he urged, "Time to go."

Anna glanced around.

They were the only two left in the cabin.

After disembarking,

a vehicle was already waiting outside.

It was a black business van.

Two men in black suits and sunglasses stood beside it.

They immediately approached to greet Adrian.

Adrian was accustomed to this.

Anna, however, was inwardly astonished.

The world of the wealthy was truly different.

Once inside the van,

the men in black conversed with Adrian in a foreign language.

Though not a language major, Anna could understand.

It seemed a very important person wished to see Adrian.

They earnestly requested his presence.

Adrian indicated he would consider it.

But he had urgent matters to attend to first.

The men in black immediately made a call to report this.

"Are you hungry?" Adrian suddenly turned and asked her.

Anna, caught listening to the conversation, was momentarily startled.

After a pause, she replied, "No."

Adrian handed her a file.

"Project documents."

"Review them quickly."

"We're heading straight to the negotiation."

Anna took the file, somewhat surprised.

She hadn't expected work to start right after landing.

Upon second thought, it made sense.

Successful people were naturally busier than most.

She lowered her head and studied the documents seriously.

She said nothing more.

The van soon reached its destination.

A man in black respectfully offered a key card.

"Mr. Sinclair."

"Our Boss has prepared a hotel suite for you."

"You may proceed directly to check-in."

Adrian glanced at the key card.

He casually placed it in his bag.

"Please convey my thanks."

While he didn't lack such things,

there was no need to refuse the gesture.

The man in black bowed and retreated.

The vehicle drove away.

Anna watched the entire exchange, curious.

Who exactly was this "Boss"?

To show Adrian such respect?

Adrian turned and noticed her distraction.

He cleared his throat lightly. "Focus."

"Prepare for the meeting."

Anna pressed her lips together helplessly.

She had already reviewed the documents last night.

She remembered the contents well enough.

This was just a refresher.

She quietly followed Adrian.

They entered a tall office building.

It was slightly less impressive than the Lowell Corporation.

Anna grew even more curious.

What kind of project required Adrian's personal attention?

A secretary greeted them immediately upon entry.

She was a woman with smoky eye makeup.

Her skin was tanned, but her features were delicate.

"You must be Mr. Sinclair?"

"This way, please."

The woman looked at Adrian with obvious admiration.

Adrian gave a slight nod.

He strode purposefully into the conference room.

Anna hurried after him.

As she passed the woman,

she received a similarly surprised look.

Anna instinctively touched her face.

Was there something on it?
###Chapter 402

Anna Ross noticed many eyes on her and Adrian Sinclair as they walked.

She could faintly hear people whispering around them.

"They look so perfect together."

"Yes, they seem like a couple."

Anna's cheeks warmed slightly.

Though the comments were quiet, she heard every word clearly.

Adrian must have heard them too.

The Executive Assistant led the way.

She looked up at the man's back ahead of him.

His steps were calm, his demeanor composed.

It was as if he hadn't heard a thing.

The Executive Assistant stopped and gestured politely.

Adrian glanced back at her.

He signaled for her to enter with him.

Anna stepped into the conference room.

It was filled with people.

After a brief exchange with the person in charge, Adrian took his seat.

She stood quietly by his side.

She had researched this person in charge last night.

There was very little information online.

But the industries he managed aligned perfectly with the Lowell Group's new project.

The Lowell Group clearly wanted to secure this collaboration.

It would accelerate the development of their new venture.

The meeting lasted the entire afternoon.

Anna's back ached from standing.

She finally understood why this project was so difficult to advance.

Even Adrian seemed to be struggling.

They walked out of the conference room.

Anna couldn't help but rub her sore legs.

The long hours of standing had exhausted her.

Though she only handed out documents, her feet could no longer support her.

She looked down.

Her high heels had rubbed her heels raw and red.

Every step sent a sharp pain through her.

Adrian suddenly stopped.

He took a card from his bag.

Anna recognized it as an elegant suite card.

"Go back to the hotel first."

"Your foreign language skills are good. You shouldn't get lost."

Adrian's gaze rested on her face.

Anna silently took the suite card.

She nodded.

Adrian turned and left.

Without another word.

She looked at the suite card.

After searching for the hotel's location, she hailed a taxi.

Arriving at the hotel lobby, she prepared to return to her room.

But several enthusiastic foreign girls pulled her aside.

They excitedly asked to take photos with her.

Anna felt a bit helpless.

But they were very strong.

She had no choice but to pose for a few pictures.

The girls were extremely lively.

They expressed how happy they were to meet her.

Anna realized that to them, she was also a foreigner.

After the photos, they finally released her.

Gritting her teeth against the pain in her feet, she headed toward the elevator.

A waiter carrying red wine approached from the opposite direction.

She deliberately moved aside to avoid a collision.

But someone nearby accidentally bumped into the waiter.

The red wine instantly spilled onto the floor.

Glass shattered, and wine splattered everywhere.

Anna couldn't dodge in time.

Her white skirt was stained with large patches of red.

The waiter panicked, apologizing repeatedly.

"I'm so sorry! I'm truly sorry!"

He looked at the mess on the floor, his eyes filled with fear.

Anna waved her hand gently.

"It's alright. Don't blame yourself."

Fortunately, she had brought spare clothes.

She could change once she went upstairs.

But this waiter would likely face punishment.
###Chapter 403

Red wine spread into a damp, cold stain on her skirt.

The sticky sensation clung tightly to her skin.

Anna Ross frowned and lifted the hem of her dress.

She decided to return to her room to change first.

The elevator mirror reflected her slightly pale face.

As the metal doors slid open and shut, she cast one last glance toward the corner of the lobby.

The waiter was hanging his head, being reprimanded.

His shoulders slumped in a defeated curve.

The sensor-activated door to the Presidential Suite slid open silently.

A waterfall of warm golden light poured out.

The crystal chandelier refracted scattered spots of light.

The carpet softly swallowed the sound of her footsteps.

She pushed open the carved door to the walk-in closet.

Her fingertips had just touched the zipper.

A door hinge creaked suddenly behind her.

Adrian Sinclair stood at the entrance, holding a paper bag.

His gaze felt tangible against her bare back.

Anna spun around abruptly.

Flustered, she grabbed a shirt to cover herself.

"Get out!"

The tips of her ears burned bright red.

Her voice trembled uncontrollably.

Instead, he closed the door behind him.

The paper bag was placed on the console table.

"If it had been someone else who came in,"

His voice was low and cold.

"What were you going to do?"

Anna bit her lip and reached for her dress.

The sound of fabric rustling was unusually clear in the silence.

He suddenly took two steps forward.

He picked up the jacket that had slipped to the floor and handed it to her.

"The medicine is in the bag."

He turned, stirring a slight current of air.

"Remember to disinfect the broken skin on your ankle."

The lock clicked shut.

Anna stared blankly at the brown paper bag.

Next to the antiseptic lotion lay a box of Band-Aids.

The edges were printed with faint cherry blossom patterns.

She curled up on the velvet stool applying the medicine.

She hissed lightly as the cotton swab touched the wound.

The sound of keyboard typing came from outside the door.

It was intermittent but comforting.

When she pushed the door open,

Adrian was frowning at his computer screen.

His fingers slid quickly across the touchpad.

"The medicine works well."

Her voice was as light as a feather.

"Thank you."

He pressed the enter key.

The blue light from the screen illuminated his profile.

"Remember to lock the door next time."
###Chapter 404

"Come help me if you're done."

Adrian Sinclair didn't look up, his gaze still fixed on the computer screen.

Anna Ross hesitated for a moment, thinking it would be good to help, and walked over.

Adrian patted the sofa beside him, signaling her to sit.

The sofa was spacious, but the spot he indicated was wedged between him and the armrest, leaving little space.

Sitting there would inevitably mean being pressed close against him.

"What do you need me to do?" She hesitated briefly before circling to the other side and sitting down a bit farther from him.

Adrian noticed her subtle maneuver but said nothing, simply moving the computer closer to her.

Anna shifted away uncomfortably.

He reached out to stop her. "Review this proposal."

He crossed his long legs and draped his arm along the back of the sofa, almost encircling her shoulders.

Anna glanced sideways; his fingers were mere inches from her shoulder.

Adrian noticed her prolonged stillness and asked softly, "Executive Assistant Ross, we're discussing work. What's on your mind?"

He leaned in closer, his presence suddenly enveloping her.

Anna shook her head hurriedly. "Nothing. I'm looking at the proposal."

She forced a smile and lowered her head to look at the computer screen.

What she saw left her stunned.

The proposal was brilliant, every step flawless.

If the partner rejected it, they simply had no vision.

She became so absorbed that she didn't notice Adrian quietly moving closer.

She was dressed softly today, in a light blue cardigan over a white lace camisole dress that accentuated her lovely figure.

White suited her exceptionally well, making her already delicate features even more captivating.

After reviewing the proposal, Anna found it impeccable.

She turned to report her thoughts but found herself meeting his deep, intense eyes up close.

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted, his breath warm. "You look beautiful today."

Anna immediately flustered, her cheeks turning crimson. "You... you're insane."

He asked her to review the proposal, yet he was doing this?

How utterly shameless!

Seeing her flustered and trying to retreat, Adrian's eyes sparkled with deeper amusement.

He straightened up and pointed to the computer. "Well? Does it need any revisions?"

Anna was impressed by how quickly he switched topics, but work was important. She composed herself and said seriously, "It's already perfect."

She was just a lowly executive assistant. How could her opinion matter?

But Adrian raised an eyebrow. "Then it's settled."

Anna still felt uneasy. "Maybe you should have someone else take a look?"
###Chapter 405

Adrian Sinclair closed his laptop.

He stood and placed it on the sofa.

“That won’t be necessary.”

“Come have dinner with me now.”

Anna Ross was indeed hungry.

She didn’t protest.

She followed quietly behind him.

The hallway was wide and silent.

She had been too rushed to notice earlier.

Now she saw the hotel was designed in classic Western European style.

Every detail spoke of refined luxury.

A black luxury car waited downstairs.

Adrian opened the car door for her.

“Get in.”

Anna paused slightly.

He had done this before.

But this time felt entirely different.

It surprised her.

Adrian’s gaze darkened.

“If you don’t get in,”

“do you plan to let me starve while waiting?”

Anna quickly slipped into the car.

Adrian closed the door.

He walked around to the driver’s seat and started the engine.

Foreign cityscapes flashed past the window.

Anna watched quietly.

The scenery here was beautiful.

If this weren’t a business trip,

she would love to explore properly.

Maybe bring her mother here someday.

Living here wouldn’t be bad either.

Her thoughts wandered aimlessly.

The winter sun felt warm.

She reached out to feel its warmth.

Light streamed through her fingers.

Warm and comforting.

Adrian glanced at her.

He subtly slowed the car’s speed.

Anna took out her phone.

Lucas Evans was calling.

She hesitated for a moment.

Then answered.

“Anna, where are you?”

“You’re not answering your phone.”

“No one’s home.”

“I couldn’t find you at the office either.”

“I’ve been worried sick.”

Lucas’s voice was urgent.

Filled with clear anxiety.

He had searched everywhere today.

But found no trace of her.

Anna’s heart tightened.

She hadn’t expected him to care this much.

But she couldn’t return his feelings.

“Lucas, I’m fine.”

“Tell me where you are.”

“I’ll come right now.”

Lucas’s voice choked up.

His eyes were bloodshot.

He was terrified.

Afraid she would disappear like three years ago.

Vanishing without a trace.

It would destroy him.

Anna looked beside her.

Her eyes met Adrian’s gaze.

She quickly turned her face away.
###Chapter 406

"What were you going to say?"

"Why do you keep looking at me?"

He deliberately raised his voice.

The sound pierced Lucas Evans' ears.

His spirit shuddered.

Something inside him crumbled completely.

So she was with him.

That's why she didn't answer the phone.

Where did they go?

Anna Ross fell silent for a moment.

Her voice was very soft. "Lucas, I'm on a business trip."

"I might not be back for a while."

"Please focus on your own matters for now."

Lucas stood frozen at the company entrance.

Like a statue.

Passersby glanced at him curiously.

The wind blew past.

Only then did he snap out of it.

His voice strained. "I understand."

"Take care of yourself."

"Call me anytime if you need anything."

"If—"

"Executive Assistant Ross."

"I'll have them order food."

"Is there anything you'd like to eat?"

Adrian Sinclair deliberately interrupted.

His presence was undeniable.

Anna shot him a glare.

She responded hurriedly. "I'm busy right now."

"I have to go."

The call ended.

Lucas listened to the dial tone.

His tense expression finally shattered.

They were actually together.

Even if it was a business trip.

He still found it hard to accept.

Lucas pressed his fingers to his forehead with a bitter smile.

He put away his phone and turned to leave.

Chloe Valentine had just exited the company.

She saw Lucas's desolate shadow.

Hatred surged in her heart.

What right did Anna have?

To attract so much affection?

But then she reconsidered.

Lucas might be useful.

She put on a sweet smile.

She quickened her pace to catch up. "Mr. Evans."

Lucas turned around.

He watched her jog toward him.

Her smile was sugary sweet.

Completely different from usual.

Chloe came to a stop.

She looked up at him. "Did you come to the company for something, Mr. Evans?"

Lucas slid his hands into his pockets.

He glanced at the company entrance.

He raised an eyebrow. "I came to see someone."

"Do you need something, Miss Valentine?"

"We don't really know each other."

He had no fondness for this woman.

He wanted no further interaction.

Chloe let out a light laugh.

She folded her arms and paced slowly. "You came to see Executive Assistant Ross, didn't you?"

She looked him over.

Taking in his pained expression.

"What a pity."

"She's on a business trip with Adrian."

"She didn't tell you at all, did she."

Lucas's fingers tightened.

A tremor passed through his brow.

"She didn't tell me."

"But your fiancé is on a business trip."

"Why didn't he take you?"

Chloe's smile froze.

She couldn't help rolling her eyes.

"Trying to drive a wedge?"

She scoffed.

"Don't think I don't know."

"You have feelings for Anna Ross."

"But you mean nothing to her."

"You can't even successfully pursue someone."

"How pathetic."

Lucas felt a sharp pain in his chest.

He pointed at her, speechless.
###Chapter 407

He had loved her for so long.

Yet now, she kept him at a distance.

He truly was a failure.

"You're right. That's exactly who I am." He let out a cold laugh. "But aren't you the same? You adore Adrian Sinclair, yet he doesn't even glance your way."

Chloe Valentine nearly screamed.

She bit her lip hard, struggling to control her expression.

"He will be mine eventually. If you truly care for Anna Ross, you'd better keep a close eye on her. I will stop at nothing to get what I want."

She shot him a look of utter disdain.

Grabbing her purse, she strode away quickly in her high heels.

Staying any longer would have driven her insane.

Lucas Evans watched her retreating figure.

Her words echoed relentlessly in his mind.

Was he really that incompetent?

Unable to hold onto the person he loved.

Letting others take her away so easily.

What should he do?

......

Anna Ross and Adrian Sinclair arrived at the restaurant.

She glanced up at the sign—Tarot.

A restaurant with a royal aesthetic.

It clearly cost a fortune.

Adrian parked the car and walked over.

A waiter approached, bowing respectfully.

"Mr. Sinclair, Mr. Mark Anderson is already waiting inside. Please allow me to show you the way."

The waiter gestured for them to enter.

Adrian stepped inside.

Anna followed quietly behind.

They were led to a private room.

It was spacious and luxurious.

At the far end of the long table sat a man with Western features.

His eyes were a pale blue.

His skin was fair.

He had deep-set eyes and a tall, straight nose.

What a refined man, Anna thought to herself.

Mark rose from his chair.

He smiled as he approached them.

"Hello, Mr. Sinclair. It's been a while."

Adrian offered a faint smile.

Anna observed quietly.

The man was handsome.

But he still paled in comparison to Adrian.

Mark's gaze shifted from Adrian's face.

It settled on Anna's.

His light blue eyes flickered.

A look of profound surprise appeared.

"Wow, who is this beautiful lady?" He looked directly at Adrian. "Mr. Sinclair, is this your new girlfriend?"

Adrian remained silent.

He pulled out a chair and sat down.

Mark raised an eyebrow, his eyes still on Anna.

Since she wasn't this man's girlfriend.

He could openly express his admiration.

"Beautiful lady, would you care to join me for dinner?" He moved closer, his arm beginning to encircle her waist.

Anna disliked such forwardness.

She stepped back, responding in a foreign language. "I'm sorry, I need to use the restroom."

Not daring to delay, she hurried away.

A waiter immediately stepped forward to guide her.

Adrian's eyes shifted slightly, glancing back.

Mark watched her graceful figure with deep interest.

A wide smile spread across his face.

It had been a long time since he encountered such a captivating woman.

She had genuinely piqued his interest.

"Mr. Sinclair, what is that girl's name? She's truly stunning." He stroked his chin, dragging a chair closer to sit down.

Hearing his frivolous tone, Adrian's expression darkened.

But he quickly composed himself, responding coolly. "She's not someone easily won over. I suggest you abandon that thought."
###Chapter 408

Mark Anderson was notorious in their circle as a playboy.

He had played the field for years, never failing to win over any girl he set his sights on.

A confident smile curled at his lips. "Don't worry, I have plenty of methods."

Adrian Sinclair irritably pressed his tongue against his cheek.

He set his glass down heavily. "Did you ask me here today just to say this?"

He glanced impatiently toward the back again.

How long did it take to use the restroom?

Mark immediately dropped his playful demeanor, turning serious. "Mr. Sinclair, you understand my intentions clearly."

"This favor, I must ask for your assistance."

He raised his glass of red wine in a gesture.

Adrian rested one hand on the table, lazily raising an eyebrow. "You mean that matter?"

Mark nodded, idly swirling his glass.

Now wealthy and powerful, his only remaining concern was expanding into the Asian market.

The business was getting tougher.

If Adrian agreed to help, everything would fall into place.

Adrian gave a light laugh, sipping his wine. "It's possible. But it depends on my mood."

"If I'm in a good mood, I might actually help you."

Mark was overjoyed, draining his glass in one gulp.

Even this slight concession was a major breakthrough.

Everyone knew this man never gave an inch.

He was about to propose another toast when he noticed Adrian repeatedly glancing toward the entrance.

A subtle anxiety was etched between his brows.

A thought occurred to Mark—the stunning girl from earlier.

He signaled a waiter. "Where is the young lady from before?"

The waiter looked around. "I escorted her to the restroom and returned. Should I check on her?"

"No need." Adrian suddenly stood up and strode directly out.

The two men exchanged puzzled looks.

Was he going to look for her himself?

Mark grew even more confused.

He had explicitly denied any relationship earlier, so why this concern now?

He quickly followed. It was best to show some tact.

Adrian walked briskly toward the restrooms.

Faint cries for help reached his ears, making his heart sink.

A sense of foreboding washed over him.

He immediately broke into a run.

Mark had just caught up, still catching his breath, when he saw the other man sprinting ahead.

He sighed in resignation and continued the chase.

Adrian rushed toward the source of the sound, clearly hearing Anna Ross's cries for help.

Without hesitation, he kicked open the stall door.

Inside, Anna was pinned to the floor by a unshaven man.

His filthy hands roamed over her body, accompanied by vile, disgusting words.

Seeing who had arrived, Anna's tears instantly overflowed.

"Get your filthy hands off her!" Adrian's eyes blazed with fury.

He delivered a powerful kick to the man.

The man screamed in pain, collapsing to the floor.
###Chapter 409

Anna Ross immediately stood up and quickly moved behind him.

Her head was bowed, her fingers still trembling.

Adrian Sinclair's brow was deeply furrowed, his gaze terrifyingly cold.

Mark Anderson ran up, panting heavily, and gasped at the scene.

This was utter lawlessness!

Committing such an act openly in broad daylight!

The man on the ground struggled to get up, cursing foully.

Adrian's eyes darkened, his hand rising to act.

Mark quickly stopped him.

"Let me handle this."

"I guarantee you'll be satisfied."

"You take her away first."

He stared coldly at the man on the ground.

Daring to cause trouble on his turf.

And offending the very person he needed assistance from.

Truly seeking his own demise.

Adrian's expression was tense as he took Anna's hand and turned to leave.

Anna felt unsettled the entire way.

She had always known public safety abroad wasn't great.

But she never expected something like this to happen to her.

When that burly man forcibly dragged her into the alley earlier.

She had been truly terrified.

So filthy.

So disgusting.

Why did these things always happen to her?

"Let's go in for a drink."

Adrian noticed her pale complexion and pointed to a tea house by the road.

Anna nodded softly.

She desperately needed some quiet.

After they were seated, the server brought two cups of hot tea.

The calm and soothing atmosphere gradually helped her relax.

Adrian watched the person silently drinking tea across from him.

"When something like that happens, why don't you call for help?"

"Or call me?"

If he hadn't noticed something was wrong and gone to investigate.

The consequences would have been unthinkable.

His expression darkened again.

His fingers clenched tightly around the teacup.

As if he wanted to crush it.

Even that couldn't quell the fury in his heart.

Anna set down her teacup and explained softly.

"He covered my mouth."

"I couldn't make a sound."

That man was powerfully built.

She had no strength to resist.

Adrian's face grew colder.

He picked up his teacup and took a sip.

His phone suddenly chimed with a notification.

He glanced at it.

In the video, the man was already beaten to within an inch of his life.

Only then did his expression soften slightly.

Anna stole a glance at him, not daring to speak again.

She felt like she was really having a streak of bad luck lately.

She seemed to encounter every unfortunate event possible.

They sat in the tea house for a long time.

Only when her complexion improved did Adrian take her to leave.

This tea house had a prime location.

Right outside was a spacious town square.

The square was currently bustling with a large crowd, extremely lively.

It seemed some event was taking place.

Anna almost stepped forward.

It had been so long since she had relaxed.

But the next moment, she withdrew her foot and suppressed her smile.

She had almost forgotten.

She was here on a business trip.

"Want to go?" Adrian glanced at her briefly, his gaze shifting to the colorful stalls in the square.

Anna shook her head.

"There's still work to do."

"Rest tonight." Adrian directly took her hand and led her toward the square.

Anna wanted to say something.

But she was captivated by the exciting performances on both sides.

She quickly forgot her original concerns.

It was truly beautiful and lively here.

The clown performance made everyone laugh heartily.

The showgirls' dance drew cheers and applause.

The cheers rose and fell in waves.
###Chapter 410

The crowd bustled.

Couples walked by hand in hand.

Passersby offered friendly smiles.

"Pretty lady, would you like some flowers?" An elderly white woman approached, holding a bouquet.

The pink camellias in her hands were exquisitely vibrant.

Anna Ross quickly shook her head.

"No, thank you."

The woman turned to Adrian Sinclair.

"Sir, buy some flowers for your girlfriend."

"Camellias symbolize admiration and perfection."

Adrian gazed at the bouquet.

He took out his phone to pay.

The woman beamed with delight.

The flowers were pushed into Anna's hands.

"May you have lasting happiness."

"What a perfect match."

Anna froze.

The bouquet felt scorching in her grasp.

She hurried to explain.

"We're not—"

Adrian pulled her away.

His pace was swift.

They were far away in moments.

He released her hand.

The flowers remained in her arms.

"Don't just stand there."

He suddenly flashed a smile.

"Let's go have some fun."

He led her through the crowd.

They finally stopped before a row of claw machines.

Anna was speechless.

She thought he was being childish.

But she didn't dare say it aloud.

Adrian exchanged cash for tokens.

He gave half to her.

Then began operating the machine himself.

A crowd gradually gathered around.

All eyes were on him.

Anna felt uncomfortable.

Cheers suddenly erupted.

He successfully grabbed a plush toy.

It was adorably shaped.

The toy landed in her arms.

He continued feeding tokens into the machine.

Anna pressed her lips together, suppressing a laugh.

His black suit and the claw machine.

Created a strange contrast.

Like an adult riding a children's rocking horse.

She couldn't help laughing aloud.

Adrian approached her again.

Handing over a new prize.

Three.

Four.

Five.

The plush toys piled up.

She couldn't hold them all.

She had to place them on a nearby table.

He still didn't stop.

As if naturally skilled at everything.

"So amazing!"

"I've never seen a man so good at this!"

"He's so handsome!"

"Is that beautiful girl his girlfriend?"

"So envious…"

Whispers rose around them.

Adrian suddenly pulled her close.

Placing her before the machine.

"I've grabbed so many."

"Now it's your turn."

His tone was light.

But Anna's entire body stiffened.
###Chapter 411

"I'm done playing. You play by yourself." She struggled to get up, but he forcefully pressed her back into the seat.

Adrian Sinclair placed a game token into her palm, raising an eyebrow. "If you don't play today, you won't get another chance later."

The surrounding crowd erupted in cheers, speaking languages she couldn't understand.

She didn't see what was so fascinating about this game that it warranted such a large crowd stopping to watch.

Anna Ross stared at the cold coin in her palm, and bad memories flooded back. She had once been obsessed with claw machines but never succeeded.

She remembered being mercilessly mocked by a friend once. Since then, she had refused to ever try again.

"I'd rather—"

Before she could finish her refusal, Adrian suddenly grasped her hand and inserted the token into the machine. He guided her hand to the joystick, his warm palm covering the back of her hand.

"Relax. It's just a game." His deep voice came from behind her.

Anna saw in the machine's reflection that he was leaning over behind her, his tall frame completely enveloping her. His hand tightly wrapped around hers, warmth spreading from her hand to her heart.

She instinctively tried to pull her hand away, but he held it even tighter. He guided her to move the joystick, accurately stopping it above a brown bear plush toy.

"Press it." His voice was much gentler than usual.

As if bewitched, Anna pressed the button. The claw descended steadily, hooking the bear plush. Adrian gave her hand a slight shake, and the toy smoothly dropped into the chute.

"!"

Anna's eyes widened in disbelief at the successfully grabbed plush toy. This was the first time in her life she had ever won a stuffed animal from a claw machine.

She happily withdrew her hand, bent down, picked up the bear, and hugged it tightly. She finally managed to grab a toy!

In her excitement, she didn't notice how radiant her smile was. Adrian watched her smile, the corners of his lips lifting slightly.

He hadn't seen such a genuine smile on her face in a long time.

"Adr—" Anna smiled, looking at the pile of plush toys on the table, but stopped abruptly.

Had she almost used such an intimate name for him?

"Hmm?" Adrian raised an eyebrow. A gust of wind had just blown past, and he only saw her lips move.

Anna's cheeks flushed. She quickly corrected herself. "I meant, let's give these toys to everyone."

There were too many plushies. She couldn't possibly take them all.

Adrian nodded and announced in a foreign language that the toys were free for the taking. The crowd cheered and surged forward, frantically grabbing the plush toys.

Anna didn't have time to dodge and was nearly knocked over by the crowd. Adrian swiftly pulled her into his arms, shielding her as he pushed through the crowd.
###Chapter 412

The setting sun cast golden light across the land.

Anna Ross leaned against his chest.

Their hearts beat close together.

His heartbeat was strong and steady.

Hers was equally rapid.

The two rhythms intertwined.

They echoed clearly in the twilight.

Night deepened.

The temperature dropped suddenly.

Anna sneezed uncontrollably.

Her nose turned red from the cold.

"Cold?" Adrian Sinclair looked down at her.

Anna hugged her arms tightly.

She had only worn a thin sweater during the day.

Now she shivered all over.

Adrian glanced around.

There were no shops nearby.

He took off his coat.

He draped it gently over her shoulders.

The coat still carried his warmth.

Anna paused for a moment.

"You're wearing so little."

"You'll catch a cold."

She tried to remove the coat and return it.

Adrian held her wrist.

His gaze was calm.

"If you get sick,"

"it will affect your work."

"Then I'll have to pay your medical bills."

Anna had no response.

The earlier tenderness was clearly an illusion.

He readjusted the coat on her shoulders.

He led her toward the parking area.

The car's heater was turned on.

Anna took off the coat.

She noticed his lips were pale.

His complexion didn't look good either.

"Are you feeling unwell?" she asked anxiously.

Adrian leaned back in his seat.

He closed his eyes to rest.

He didn't respond.

"Let's go to the hospital," she suggested worriedly.

"No need."

He started the car.

He drove toward the hotel.

Throughout the journey,

Anna kept glancing at him.

His complexion didn't improve.

If he really got sick because of her,

she would feel guilty.

They arrived at the hotel.

Adrian got out with his coat.

His steps seemed unsteady.

Anna quickly followed.

She supported his arm.

"Let me help you upstairs."

He paused slightly.

He didn't refuse.

Inside the elevator,

he leaned against the wall.

He remained silent.

Anna wanted to check his forehead.

But she feared causing misunderstanding.

Her phone suddenly rang.

It was a message from Mia Lawrence.

"Anna, where are you?"
###Chapter 413

"I'm on a business trip out of town. Is something wrong?"

Anna Ross steadied the swaying figure beside her, her focus entirely on him.

The line went quiet for a moment. Mia Lawrence's voice softened. "Anna, I think Julian went abroad."

She stared at her phone screen. The messages stopped at the one she sent last night, with no reply since. They had been chatting excitedly just the day before, but it all went silent after yesterday evening.

Anna pressed the phone between her shoulder and ear, using both hands to support the sliding man beside her. "Don't worry. I'll help you find out after I finish here."

Adrian Sinclair looked lean, but his weight was substantial as he leaned against her. Anna gritted her teeth, refusing to let him collapse.

Mia was about to agree when she heard a stifled groan from the other end of the line. It sounded off.

"Anna, are you really on a business trip?" Her tone was suspicious.

Anna closed her eyes. Adrian had nearly fallen, and she had instinctively wrapped an arm around his waist. He had let out a low moan.

Of course, Mia heard everything.

When Anna didn't respond, Mia pressed further. "Well, Anna Ross! Telling me you're on a business trip? What are you really up to?"

She never had any men around before. Now there was a man's voice? Highly unusual!

"I—"

"Anna, are you dating!?"

Anna couldn't get a word in. She sighed helplessly. "No, I'm just—"

"Cold. So cold." Adrian suddenly shivered, his face growing paler.

The sound made Mia even more convinced. She grew excited. "Look at you, full of surprises! When are you bringing him to meet me?"

Anna tried to explain, but Adrian tilted sideways, threatening to fall again. She had to hang up and use both hands to steady him.

Her palm touched his forehead. The scorching heat made her heart clench. How could he have such a high fever!

The elevator finally reached their floor. She struggled to help him out. Their room was on the right side of the hallway, still some distance away.

Anna supported the much taller man, inching forward step by step. From behind, she looked like a tiny hamster dragging food several times her size.

"You..." Adrian forced his eyes open, looking at the small but stubborn figure beside him.

Anna glared at him. "A grown man, getting this sick from a little wind?" She pressed her lips together, muttering under her breath, "And so heavy."

As for what he was about to say? If it was thanks, she'd rather not hear it. It would make her cringe.

Adrian rubbed his temples, his brows furrowed from the throbbing pain. Anna helped him open the door, barely managing to drag him inside.

By the time she got him onto the bed, she was breathless and exhausted, collapsing beside him to catch her breath.

Adrian draped an arm over his eyes, blinking hard to clear his vision. He shouldn't have had that drink at the restaurant. Now his head was splitting.

Anna recovered slightly and got up to search for the first aid kit. She rummaged through every drawer and cabinet but couldn't find a single box of medicine.
###Chapter 414

"I need to buy medicine," she murmured to herself, glancing back at the figure in the bed.

It seemed like the first time she had ever seen him sick. He rarely fell ill before. Had his health deteriorated because he was too busy now?

She shook her head, dismissing the thought. She grabbed a thick coat and threw it on, preparing to head out.

Just as Anna Ross's hand touched the doorknob, the doorbell rang.

Who could it be at this hour?

She opened the door. Mark Anderson stood outside, grinning.

"Well, hello there, beautiful!" His eyes lit up, his voice rising.

His playful, cheeky demeanor made Anna uncomfortable. But since he was Adrian Sinclair's friend, she nodded politely.

Mark peered into the room. "Mind if I come in?"

Anna stepped aside. "Mr. Sinclair has a cold. He's still resting."

"What? He's sick!?" Mark's overly pale face scrunched up in surprise. His eyes widened as if he'd heard shocking news.

Anna gave a quiet affirmation. "I need to go buy medicine. Excuse me."

They were here for a project. If Adrian couldn't participate because of her, he would surely resent her even more.

She didn't want to owe him anything. She especially didn't want him to dislike her.

Mark raised an eyebrow and clicked his tongue. "Ah, when will a pretty girl ever worry about me like that?"

He strode into the room, heading straight for Adrian's bedroom. Seeing the man in bed, he shook his head repeatedly.

"Mr. Sinclair, how did you catch a cold so quickly?" He sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the man.

Adrian tugged the blanket higher. His eyes remained closed. His voice was low. "Why are you here?"

"Business. Can't I visit?" Mark studied Adrian's impossibly handsome face, baffled that such cold words came from him.

But he was more curious about something else.

Leaning in like a gossiping busybody, Mark asked, "Come on, tell me. What's your relationship with that pretty girl? You like her, don't you?"

If it wasn't liking her, he couldn't understand Adrian's genuine, heartfelt concern!

Adrian gave a soft, dismissive snort. "If you still want my help, stop asking pointless questions."

Mark brushed off the threat. He scoffed. "I told you, if she's not yours, I'm making a move."

She was so beautiful. If he didn't like her, plenty of others would.

Adrian finally opened his eyes. His gaze was dark, smoldering like hidden flames.

Mark continued chattering. "I'm serious. Give me a straight answer."

Displeasure flickered in Adrian's eyes. His voice turned cold and heavy. "You're not her type."
###Chapter 415

Mark's expression froze instantly.

He looked blankly at Adrian Sinclair.

"Wait, how do you know I'm not her type?"

"What if she likes someone like me?"

He glanced down at himself.

Tall and well-built.

Handsome face.

Fashionable style.

So many girls here had shown interest in him.

He hadn't been interested in any of them.

"She has a boyfriend." Adrian stared at the ceiling.

His voice was low.

"Stop fantasizing."

"Don't think about getting anything from her."

Each word felt like a needle piercing Mark's heart.

He dramatically clutched his chest.

"Why didn't you say so earlier?"

"I thought she was single."

It was rare for him to feel this way.

And she was already taken.

Anna Ross returned with the medicine.

She overheard the conversation and paused beside the sofa.

Since when did she have a boyfriend?

Mark pulled out his phone and showed a photo.

He held it in front of Adrian.

"Satisfied with how we handled it?"

Adrian glanced at the photo.

His eyes turned icy.

"Daring to cause trouble on your turf."

"Seems your influence isn't that strong."

The thought of that man's filthy hands touching Anna made him furious.

He wanted to break those hands.

Mark looked at the photo, then at Adrian.

"The guy's already beaten to a pulp."

"You're still not satisfied?"

The person in the photo was bloody and unrecognizable.

Even Mark found it disturbing.

Suddenly, Mark realized something.

He put away his phone and smirked.

"Mr. Sinclair, is her boyfriend you?"

It was just a touch.

But Adrian's look was murderous.

Too obvious.

Adrian gave him a cold glance.

Neither denying nor confirming.

Anna tightened her grip on the medicine bag.

Her palms were sweaty.

She didn't understand why she felt nervous.

The question was meaningless.

Yet she wanted to know the answer.

She and he were already over.

Maybe she caught a chill earlier.

Her brain must be frozen.

She hesitated and didn't go in.

She would wait until Mark left.

Otherwise, it would be too awkward.

She sat on the sofa and called Julian Garnache.

The call connected quickly.

"Anna, why are you calling suddenly?"

Hearing his voice, she realized how long it had been.

"Nothing, just wanted to ask."

"What has Mia been up to lately?"

She nearly bit her tongue.

What a stupid question.

Julian was silent for a moment.

She could imagine his expression.

She tried to recover.

"I mean, I'm on a business trip."

"Aren't you in New York, Julian?"

"No, I went back to my hometown." Julian put down his wine bottle.

He gazed at the distant sky.

Anna was stunned.

He hadn't been home in years.

Why did he suddenly go back?
###Chapter 416

She suddenly realized the date.

Her lips parted.

After a moment of silence, she asked softly, "Julian, did you go visit your mom?"

"Yeah." Julian Garnache's voice was low.

Anna Ross heard the sadness in his tone and comforted him gently. "Don't be too upset. Your mom—"

"Anna, I need some time alone. I'll find you later." He cut her off, his gaze fixed on the photo on the tombstone. His eyes were red.

Anna understood his heavy heart. She ended the call. His hometown was remote. She worried about his safety alone there.

A message from Mia Lawrence popped up on her screen.

"Anna, did you reach Julian? He's not answering calls or texts. I'm so worried!"

An idea sparked. She quickly typed a reply and sent it. She included a detailed address.

She let out a long breath. She had done all she could. The rest was up to her friend.

....

Julian leaned against the cold tombstone. Memories of his parents flooded his mind. Tears fell silently. "Mom, are you happy now?"

He asked the empty air. Only the rustle of wind through branches answered.

He smiled bitterly. "Right. You can't answer me now. Just like you never could back then."

He picked up a beer beside him. He drank it all in one go. He sat quietly, looking at the green cemetery. Time flew. Everything changed. Only this place seemed frozen in the past.

He stayed at the cemetery all day. He didn't leave until night completely enveloped the earth.

Suddenly, he noticed a figure moving in the distance. It flickered in and out of view. This cemetery had no caretaker. Who would come here so late?

Julian's throat tightened. Occasional bird calls echoed through the cemetery. They sounded especially sharp in the night. He wanted to walk down. But his feet felt too heavy to lift.

The shadow drew closer. It was less vague now. He turned on his flashlight and shone it forward.

It looked like a person. A woman?

"Julian! I finally found you!" Mia Lawrence brushed dirt off her clothes. She called out to him joyfully and hurried over.

Julian's eyes widened in disbelief. It was Mia!

How did she find this place?

Mia reached him, panting. "Julian, I'm exhausted."

"Mia, why are you here?" Julian was utterly surprised. A girl coming to a cemetery at night was worrying enough. But this was his hometown!

Mia paused. She thought hard for a moment before speaking softly. "I... I came to find you, of course."

She had been shocked when she received the address from Anna. She hadn't wanted to disturb him. But thinking of him alone, she couldn't rest easy. So she rushed over.
###Chapter 417

Julian Garnache snapped out of his shock.

He looked down at her clothes, covered in dirt.

He frowned slightly.

Mia Lawrence wished she could disappear into the ground.

She had run too frantically.

She had fallen several times along the way.

Now he had seen her in this utterly disheveled state.

Annoyance washed over her.

"Julian, I accidentally got dirty," she stammered.

She could never admit she had fallen.

It was too humiliating.

Julian Garnache recalled the figure on the mountain path earlier.

Flickering in and out of view.

Stumbling along.

He understood immediately.

But he didn't say it out loud.

He glanced around.

The sky was growing dark.

The mountain breeze carried a slight chill.

"Come back with me first to change your clothes," he said softly.

Mia Lawrence hadn't processed it yet.

Her hand was suddenly held by his.

Her entire body stiffened.

A jolt like electricity surged through her.

She followed him down the mountain in a daze.

The path was rugged.

But he walked steadily.

Bird songs echoed through the valley.

Normally, she would have been scared by now.

But now her mind was completely filled with the person in front of her.

She looked down at their joined hands.

His fingers were long and pale.

Warm and strong.

This wasn't a dream.

He was really holding her hand.

Mia Lawrence suddenly felt it was all worth it.

Even if life was terrible.

This moment was beautiful enough.

They reached the foot of the mountain.

Julian Garnache let go to open the car door.

Mia was still lost in the sensation of the touch.

Her heart was pounding wildly.

"Why did you come here?" he asked, pulling the car door open.

He turned to look at her.

His gaze was probing.

Mia panicked.

"I... I was worried about you," she blurted out.

She regretted it the moment the words left her mouth.

What kind of reason was that?

Julian Garnache paused.

He turned fully to face her.

"What?" His eyes sharpened.

Mia felt sweat bead on her palms.

A sudden idea flashed in her mind.

"It was Anna!" she explained hurriedly.

"Anna is on a business trip."

"She was worried about you."

"So she asked me to check on you."

She secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

This reason should be flawless.

But when she looked up.

She met Julian Garnache's deep, penetrating gaze.

He looked at her quietly.

As if he could see right through everything.

Mia's heart tightened.

Had he figured it out?

Just as she was about to break under the pressure.

Julian Garnache suddenly smiled.

It was as gentle as a spring breeze.

"Thank you, Mia," he said.

He reached out and ruffled her hair.

"You've had a long day."

Mia froze completely on the spot.

He touched her head.

Was this real?

What kind of lucky day was this?

She floated into the passenger seat in a daze.

She giggled the entire way.

It wasn't until the car stopped in front of a villa that she snapped back to reality.

Julian Garnache unbuckled his seatbelt.

He glanced at her.

"Mia, are you okay?" he asked with concern.

"You've been smiling the whole way."

Mia hurriedly covered her face.

She turned to look out the window.

"The wind blew on me," she fibbed.

"My face is a little stiff."

"I'm just doing some relaxation exercises."

Her ears burned a bright, hot red.
###Chapter 418

Mia Lawrence nearly bit her tongue.
What a foolish thing she had just said.
How could she come up with such an excuse?

Julian Garnache laughed out loud.
He pushed the car door open and stepped out.
He walked around to the passenger side and opened the door for her.
"It's windy outside."
"Let's go inside first."

"Go inside?" Mia repeated.
Her cheeks felt slightly warm.

Julian pointed to a white villa not far away.
"Yes."
"This is my home."

Mia followed his gaze.
Her heartbeat suddenly quickened.
This was where he grew up.
Maybe she could catch a glimpse of his past.

Inside, Julian searched for a moment.
He took a few old clothes from the wardrobe.
"Only Mrs. Watson comes to clean occasionally."
"There aren't many clothes."
"These will have to do for now."

"It's fine!"
Mia grabbed the clothes.
She turned and hurried into the guest room.

She eagerly buried her face in the clothes.
A faint scent of soap mixed with his unique fragrance.
It smelled wonderful.

Mia couldn't help but laugh.
"Happiness comes so suddenly!"
She pulled out her phone and sent a message to Anna Ross.
A string of heart and thank you emojis.

At that moment, Anna was sitting by the bed.
She held a cup of cold medicine.
She silently complained to herself.
It was just a cold.
Did he really need to be fed medicine?

"You're not happy?" Adrian Sinclair watched her.
His expression had softened considerably.

Anna shook her head.
She brought the medicine spoon to his lips.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.
Mia's text popped up.
The screen was full of cheers and hearts.

Anna couldn't help but smile.
It seemed things were going well over there.

Adrian's eyes darkened.
He suddenly reached out and gripped her shoulder.
He pulled her down onto the bed.
He lowered his head and kissed her lips.

"Mmm..." Anna's eyes widened.
Her heart raced wildly.
A slight ache accompanied it.

Was he crazy?

She raised her hands to push him away.
But he had already released her.
It was just a light touch.
Fleeting and ambiguous.

Anna's cheeks burned.
This kind of ambiguity made her heart flutter even more.
She pressed her lips together and tried to sit up.

"Do you hate this?"

His deep voice came from behind her.
Anna froze.

Did she hate it?
She pressed a hand to her chest.
Her racing heart had already given the answer.

Adrian stared intently at her back.
The veins on the back of his hands stood out.
Like a child waiting for candy.
Humble and longing.
###Chapter 419

"Get some rest." Anna Ross spoke softly, then turned to leave.

An arm suddenly wrapped around her waist.

She was pulled back against a burning chest.

Her breath caught.

The sound of his heartbeat was deafening, pounding against her eardrums.

His chin rested on her shoulder, his hair brushing against her neck.

A tingling sensation spread through her entire body.

The dim yellow light cast their intertwined shadows on the floor.

It was like a silent movie.

Memories suddenly flooded back to their university days.

He always loved holding her from behind, saying no one could take her away like this.

Back then, his laughter was clear and bright, his eyes full of light.

Plop.

A tear fell onto the back of his hand.

The scalding wetness quickly turned cold.

"Mr. Sinclair, please let go." Her voice trembled. "You have a fiancée."

Tears poured out uncontrollably.

It turned out her heart could still ache.

All these years, she had desperately suppressed her feelings, thinking she had long grown numb.

But some marks could not be erased by time.

Like a first love.

Like him.

Adrian Sinclair turned her around, his thumb gently wiping her cheek.

But the more he wiped, the more tears fell.

He sighed. "Don't cry."

Those words were like a key, unlocking her final defenses.

She pushed him away violently. "Pitying me?"

Her voice was so sharp it sounded unfamiliar even to herself.

He froze in place, his hand still suspended in mid-air.

A flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes.

Anna wiped her tears haphazardly and looked directly at him. "Mr. Sinclair, this shouldn't happen between us."

"Please have some self-respect."

She rushed out of the room. The moment she closed the door, she completely broke down.

Tears soaked the pillowcase.

Why was he the one who hated her, yet also the one who kept entangling?

Clearly, everything was beyond repair.

He had a bright future, a fiancée from a suitable family.

All she wanted was to escape this nightmare with her mother.

Anna Ross, don't be foolish anymore.

She curled up by the bed, closing her sore eyes.

Next room.

Adrian Sinclair stood still, staring at the empty doorway with a self-mocking smile.

What was he doing?

He was supposed to hate her.

But his emotions were already out of control.

His phone vibrated on the bed.

The screen lit up with "Grandpa."

He frowned and answered.

"Adrian, Chloe says you're not answering her calls again?" The old man's voice was displeased. "Where are you now?"
###Chapter 420

Grandpa's slightly impatient voice came through the phone.

Adrian Sinclair's face showed no expression.

Only a faint trace of disgust flickered in his deep eyes.

He stood up and walked to the window.

He lit a cigarette.

"Grandpa, I'm on a business trip. I'll return tomorrow."

White smoke curled before his eyes.

He narrowed his eyes slightly.

Frederick Lowell breathed a sigh of relief.

"That child Chloe truly likes you."

"Don't disappoint her."

"I won't allow it."

True feelings?

Adrian let out a cold scoff.

If she truly liked him,

she wouldn't have drugged him.

She wouldn't have repeatedly hurt that person.

He turned and leaned against the window.

"Understood, Grandpa."

"It's late. You should rest early."

Grandpa sighed.

A few coughs followed.

Henry's concerned questions were faintly audible.

Grandpa waved his hand.

He continued into the phone.

"Adrian, come to the house when you return."

"Bring Chloe along for a family dinner."

Adrian acknowledged.

He ended the call.

The phone rang again.

It was Chloe Valentine calling.

He glanced at it.

He declined the call directly.

Chloe listened to the busy tone.

Her face contorted.

She bit her thumbnail hard.

Her entire body trembled.

Adrian Sinclair, answer the phone!

She screamed internally.

She barely stopped herself from shouting aloud.

He hadn't answered his phone all day.

It was like he had vanished from the earth.

She kept calling relentlessly.

No one ever picked up.

Chloe finally lost control.

She slammed her phone onto the floor.

She let out a sharp scream.

Then she suddenly remembered something.

She picked up the phone and called Anna Ross.

This time, it finally connected.

She spoke urgently.

"Executive Assistant Anna, are you with Adrian!?"

She could almost imagine it.

Anna shamelessly snuggling in his arms at this very moment.

The thought made her want to grab a knife and kill.

Anna was silent for a moment.

"You are his fiancée."

"Shouldn't you know his whereabouts better than I do?"

"Ah! Don't say such hypocritical things!"

"Only the two of you were absent from the company today."

"It must be you seducing him, right?"

Chloe grabbed her hair.

Her eyes reddened.

Anna felt helpless.

She seduced him?

"Miss Valentine, are you mistaken?"

She pressed a towel to her swollen eyes.

She looked at her disheveled self in the mirror.

Chloe was convinced she had stolen Adrian away.

She paced anxiously around her room.

"Tell me where you are."

"I'm going to find him myself!"

Anna glanced down at her phone.

She ended the call directly.

The phone rang again.

She set it to silent.

She turned and walked into the bathroom.

She was too tired.

No one should disturb her.

Chloe stared at the ended call.

Her teeth chattered with rage.

Perfect.

Both of them were treating her this way.
###Chapter 421

Her phone rang abruptly.

Chloe Valentine's eyes lit up.

She grabbed it quickly.

Her smile froze when the screen lit up.

It wasn't Adrian Sinclair.

It was Grandpa.

She took a deep breath and answered.

Her voice instantly turned sweet and obedient.

"Grandpa, why are you still up?"

His kind voice came through.

"Chloe, your parents are arriving in New York tomorrow."

"Don't go to the company. Bring them directly to the manor."

"Adrian will join later."

Chloe's heart raced.

She agreed immediately.

"Of course, Grandpa. I'll be there on time."

The call ended.

A victorious smile curled her lips.

At the manor.

Grandpa set down the phone with a heavy sigh.

Henry stepped forward quietly.

He adjusted the blanket over Grandpa's lap.

"Don't worry too much."

"Young people have their own fate."

Grandpa shook his head.

"Adrian is different with Anna Ross."

"I can see it."

Henry asked softly.

"Why do you think so?"

Grandpa's gaze turned to the fish tank.

The fish swam happily.

Two small fish chased and played together.

He suddenly remembered something.

"Did you find anything on that girl I asked about?"

Henry responded respectfully.

"Not much information."

"But she attended the same university as the young master."

Grandpa's eyes narrowed.

He seemed thoughtful.

"I see..."

"We'll discuss it when Adrian returns."

He motioned for Henry to wheel him upstairs.

The night grew deeper.

Elsewhere.

Mia Lawrence finally emerged from the room after much hesitation.

She wore Julian Garnache's shirt.

It was oversized, like a sack.

The sleeves covered her hands completely.

The hem almost reached her knees.

Julian couldn't help but laugh.

Mia's cheeks flushed pink.

She muttered softly.

"Is it that bad?"

It looked fine when she checked the mirror earlier.

Julian stopped laughing.

He looked at her seriously.

"No."

"It's beautiful."

"It suits you perfectly."
###Chapter 422

Mia Lawrence walked over and sat on the opposite sofa.

She chose to believe him.

Whatever he said.

She trusted him unconditionally.

"Are you hungry?" Julian Garnache looked at her.

Mia shook her head gently.

"I ate something before coming."

. . . . . .

After a moment of silence, Julian spoke again.

"I'm a bit hungry."

"I'm making instant noodles."

"Do you want some too?"

Mia felt their conversation was a bit stiff.

The atmosphere was subtly.

She didn't know how to respond.

She had just said she wasn't hungry.

But now she wanted to keep him company.

She was caught in a dilemma.

Julian noticed her hesitation.

He chuckled softly.

"Eating alone is no fun."

"Keep me company."

"Okay!" Mia agreed immediately.

Afraid he might change his mind.

Julian smiled.

He stood up and walked into the kitchen.

Soon, the aroma of instant noodles filled the air.

Mia felt a bit dazed.

It had been a long time since she had instant noodles.

It actually smelled incredibly appealing.

She stood up and looked around the room.

It felt like a dream.

She was actually in the place where Julian grew up.

Small decorations hung on the walls.

The bookshelf was filled with trophies.

She walked closer for a better look.

They were all first-place awards from piano competitions.

"So impressive," Mia murmured softly.

She had only heard Anna Ross mention he loved playing the piano.

She never knew he was this outstanding.

He had won so many honors.

"Time to eat," Julian called out gently.

She turned around.

He was carrying two steaming bowls of instant noodles.

Julian set the bowls down.

He looked slightly apologetic.

"There aren't many ingredients at home."

"We'll have to make do."

Mia put down the trophy and walked over.

"Instant noodles are great."

"I haven't had them in ages."

She sat down and took a whiff.

"Smells amazing."

"Let's eat."

Without waiting for his response, she picked up her fork and knife and started eating.

Julian glanced at her and began eating as well.

He hadn't eaten all day.

He was starving.

Mia appeared calm on the surface.

But inside, she was thrilled.

Having dinner with the person she liked.

How wonderful.

But she noticed.

Julian had a faint trace of worry between his brows.

"Julian."

"Can you tell me about Anna's childhood?" Mia put down her utensils.

She took a sip of mineral water.

Julian froze.

He stopped eating.

He looked up at her.

Mia smiled.

"I want to know her embarrassing childhood stories."

"So I can tease her later."

Actually, she wanted to change the subject.

To cheer him up.

Julian put down his utensils.

He folded his hands.

"Anna's childhood."

"Was actually not very good."
###Chapter 423

Mia Lawrence's smile instantly froze on her face.

Julian Garnache kept scrolling through his phone.
After a long while, he finally handed it to her.
"This is a photo of Anna when she was little."
"You probably haven't seen it before?"

Mia gently shook her head.
Her heart ached sharply the moment she took the phone.
The little girl in the photo was thin and frail.
There wasn't a trace of a smile on her face.
A faint sadness hid in the depths of her eyes.

"Anna has always kept her feelings to herself since childhood."
"She rarely talked to others."
Julian Garnache ate his instant noodles unhurriedly.
He even drank the last bit of broth clean.

Mia didn't know what to say for a moment.
She remembered what Anna Ross had said.
She had never seen her father since birth.
Mia had grown up with both parents.
She could never truly understand that feeling.

At such a young age.
She should have been innocent and carefree.

"I often invited her to come over and play back then."
"The little girl always refused."
Julian Garnache started laughing to himself.
As if remembering something amusing.
"We only started talking because of an accident later."

Mia put down the phone.
She rested her chin on her hand and listened quietly.

Julian Garnache took a sip of water.
He suddenly felt the desire to talk.
"She loved candy most when she was little."
"She always pulled on me asking for sweets."
"Later, she slowly became willing to get close to me......"

That night.
Mia heard many unfamiliar stories from the past.
About her closest friend.
She unknowingly fell into a deep sleep.

Early the next morning.
Mia opened her eyes to see a simple room.
The gray sheets carried a masculine scent.
She suddenly remembered what happened last night.
She almost jumped out of bed.

She had actually fallen asleep just like that.
Who carried her to the bed?
Could it have been Julian Garnache?
Thinking of this, her entire body grew hot.
She felt like a thoroughly cooked shrimp.

Mia glanced at the time.
It was still early.
She decided to do something.

She dialed Anna Ross's number.
Anna Ross was being woken up by Adrian Sinclair.
She was busy preparing to go to the company for a project meeting.
She didn't notice the incoming call.

Mia waited for a while before hanging up.
She originally wanted to ask her friend about Julian Garnache's preferences.
Now she had to figure out what to buy on her own.

She gently pushed the door open.
No one was outside.
He should still be asleep.
She walked out quietly on tiptoe.

After looking around, she found there were no large supermarkets nearby.
She randomly bought some groceries and returned.
Pushing the door open, she saw Julian Garnache sitting on the sofa.

"Julian, you're awake?"
She changed into slippers and walked in carrying the groceries.

Julian Garnache had just woken up not long ago.
His hair was somewhat messy.
It inexplicably gave him a more languid momentum.
"Mia, what did you go out for?"

Mia held up the groceries in her hand.
"I went to buy some food."
"I'll cook later."
She put the groceries in the refrigerator.
She picked out a few items and walked into the kitchen.

Julian Garnache watched her retreating figure.
His expression was somewhat dazed.
After a moment of silence, he walked towards the bathroom.

It had been a long time since he last felt this way.
The feeling of someone cooking for him and waiting for him.
###Chapter 424

Anna Ross unlocked her phone screen in the afternoon.

Sunlight slanted through the car window, falling on her weary fingertips.

She was so exhausted that even her breath felt heavy.

The negotiation had been unusually difficult.

The other party refused to yield, their words sharp and unrelenting.

Four hours of back-and-forth had nearly drained her completely.

Fortunately, the contract was finally signed.

She replied to Mia Lawrence's message and looked out the car window.

Adrian Sinclair walked ahead, his posture straight but betraying a subtle weariness.

Today's negotiation had clearly been targeted at him.

Since their abrupt conversation last night, he had not spoken to her again.

His silence felt like an invisible wall between them.

Adrian opened the car door and slid into the driver's seat.

Anna quietly got into the back.

The car headed toward an upscale restaurant in the city, where Mark Anderson was already waiting at the private room entrance.

"You're finally here," Mark greeted with a smile, his eyes shifting between them. "Leaving tonight? I'll miss you both."

Anna glanced at the dining table.

Elegant porcelain plates were filled with exquisite dishes. Candlelight flickered, creating a solemn atmosphere.

The client's high regard for Adrian was evident.

Adrian took his seat without a word.

Mark noticed Anna and pulled out a chair for her. "Please sit, beautiful lady."

Anna thanked him softly.

Only three of them remained in the private room. The air was so quiet that the gentle clink of silverware against plates could be heard.

"Mr. Sinclair, have you considered that matter?" Mark got straight to the point.

Adrian cut his steak slowly, fatigue evident in his eyes.

Anna lowered her gaze.

He had barely slept last night and had negotiated while sick today.

After the cold medicine wore off, his condition had clearly worsened.

"I'll approve the documents," Adrian said, his voice calm and steady.

Mark immediately stood up, raising his glass with a laugh. "Excellent! You're truly my savior!"

He downed his drink, excitement flushing his cheeks.

Anna blinked in confusion and continued eating quietly.

She didn't notice Adrian's gaze drifting toward her several times.

His mind was in turmoil.

The impulsive words from last night still echoed in his ears.

Was it the medication, or was it his true desire?

He couldn't tell.

When Anna reached for a napkin, she accidentally met his eyes.

Both froze for a moment before quickly looking away.

Mark keenly caught this scene and broke the silence with a smile, saying, "Beautiful lady, would you like to visit the iconic attractions here? I can be your guide."

Anna shook her head.

All she wanted was to return to the hotel and sink into a soft pillow.

"Next time," she declined softly, maintaining a polite smile.
###Chapter 425

Mark said nothing more, quietly finishing his meal.

After dinner, Mark personally escorted them to the door.

He suddenly raised his hand, signaling them to wait.

A server approached, holding an exquisite gift box.

Mark handed the box to Adrian Sinclair. "A small token. There will be more surprises next time you visit."

Adrian glanced at it and immediately passed it into Anna Ross's arms.

She froze. "This is for you..."

"It's for both of you." Mark winked. "Open it later, in private."

Anna accepted the box, her fingertips tingling with warmth.

They hurried back to the hotel to collect their luggage and headed straight for the airport.

She didn't understand his rush to return home, but their business trip was officially over.

The airport was a chaotic sea of people, a roaring tide of noise.

Anna stayed close behind Adrian, afraid of being swept away by the crowd.

Then, her peripheral vision caught a familiar silhouette.

Her breath hitched.

Her heart clenched violently. Her fingers turned icy cold in an instant.

A fear from years ago, like a venomous snake, slithered out and coiled tightly around her throat.

She grabbed Adrian's hand abruptly.

Her nails dug into his skin without her realizing.

Adrian frowned, turning back to see her face deathly pale, her entire body trembling.

She was desperately trying to shrink behind him, like a terrified young animal.

"What's wrong?" he asked, his voice low.

Anna bit her lip hard, her gaze unfocused.

That man was looking in their direction—

A buzzing filled her head. She yanked Adrian's arm and broke into a frantic run.

Adrian stumbled, forced to push through the crowd with her.

The wheels of their luggage screeched against the floor.

He had never been in such a disheveled state, but he had no choice but to keep pace with her.

Anna didn't stop until they reached the security checkpoint.

She looked back, confirming no one was following them, and finally let out a shaky breath.

She looked up and met Adrian's deep, unreadable gaze.

The boarding announcement echoed behind them.

She released his hand as if electrocuted and fled into the security line.
###Chapter 426

Adrian Sinclair tilted his head slightly.

His gaze settled on Anna Ross.

He found her utterly perplexing in this moment.

Her sudden action earlier.

What did it mean?

His hand still hung in the air.

Frozen in the position where she had held it.

His fingers twitched slightly.

Slowly curling into a fist.

The warmth of her touch still lingered in his palm.

Fleeting yet palpable.

On the plane.

Anna sat by the window.

Her thoughts were a tangled mess.

Memories long buried.

Resurfaced violently because of the man she encountered today.

But they were not pleasant memories.

She wished to forget them forever.

Never to recall them again.

"What's really going on with you today?"

Adrian sat down beside her.

Unable to hold back his questions any longer.

She was acting far too strange today.

The way she had been earlier.

It was clear she was avoiding someone.

Who could it be?

Another one of her admirers, perhaps?

The thought made his chest feel tight.

As if blocked by a heavy stone.

Irritation simmered within him.

Craving an outlet.

Anna shook her head gently.

She remained silent.

And did not look at him.

That man had vanished years ago.

He had vowed never to disturb her or her mother again.

Now, suddenly, they had crossed paths.

Would he seek out her mother?

Anna's worry grew heavier.

She wanted to contact her mother immediately.

But remembered she had turned off her phone before boarding.

She would have to wait until they landed.

Adrian watched her intently.

She was clearly unsettled.

As if something terrifying was closing in.

He cleared his throat softly.

"What are you thinking about?" he asked in a low voice.

Anna finally turned to look at him.

In that moment.

She felt the world was far too small.

Why did fate keep bringing old faces back into her life?

That man today.

And him.

A self-mocking smile touched her lips.

"Nothing."

Perhaps.

A peaceful life was never meant for her.

Adrian wanted to press further.

But she had already closed her eyes.

He fell silent.

His emotions churning because of her distant attitude.

His instincts told him.

Something had happened today.

Otherwise, she wouldn't be acting so unusual.

How many secrets are you keeping from me?

How did you spend all those years without me?

Adrian leaned back in his seat.

His eyes remained fixed on the woman beside him.

His mind raced with countless thoughts.

The flight was smooth.

Lulling everyone into drowsiness.

As the sun began to set.

The plane descended gradually.

Anna gathered her luggage.

Following behind Adrian as usual.

They had just reached the exit.

When a bright, cheerful figure dashed into view.

Chloe Valentine ran over joyfully.

She immediately linked arms with Adrian.

Effortlessly inserting herself between them.

"Adrian.

You must be tired from your business trip.

I've made reservations at a restaurant.

Let's go welcome you back properly."

She beamed, natural and radiant.

Like a girlfriend greeting her returning boyfriend.

Anna walked slightly apart.

Feeling like an unnecessary third wheel.

She stayed near the edge.

Trying her best not to intrude on their space.

Adrian glanced at her discreetly.

The worry etched between her brows.

It refused to leave his mind.

She always did this.

Unknowingly tugging at his heart.
###Chapter 427

Adrian Sinclair glanced sideways.

The arm tightly entwined with his made him uncomfortable.

He tried to pull his arm away.

"Chloe, it's too crowded."

Chloe Valentine only held on tighter.

She pouted playfully.

"I want to walk like this."

"We're engaged, after all."

Her gaze swept the surroundings.

It finally settled on Anna Ross.

Though jealous she could join the business trip.

Now it was her standing by his side.

Anna could only watch from the sidelines.

Served her right.

Displeasure flickered in Adrian's eyes.

"Chloe."

He tried to free his hand again.

Chloe clung like adhesive tape.

She had seen through his intention long ago.

Swallowing her embarrassment, she held on tighter.

"Adrian, my parents are here too."

"We're having dinner together at home later."

Anna's heart trembled.

She had almost forgotten.

If not for that last accident.

They would have been officially engaged by now.

Meeting parents was perfectly normal.

Adrian's gaze swept past her.

He looked toward where Chloe pointed.

Mr. and Mrs. Valentine were indeed waiting at the entrance.

Seeing them, the Valentines approached with beaming smiles.

Mrs. Valentine warmly took Adrian's other hand.

She patted it gently.

"Adrian, you're finally back."

"Chloe kept talking about missing you these past two days."

"My ears are about to grow calluses."

She gave her daughter a mock scolding look.

Chloe shyly pressed closer to Adrian.

"Mom, stop it."

"Adrian is right here."

Mrs. Valentine laughed.

"But it's true."

Her eyes suddenly turned to Anna.

As if just noticing her presence.

Anna happened to look up.

Meeting that contemptuous gaze.

Mr. Valentine also stepped forward to greet them.

"Adrian, long time no see."

He smiled warmly.

Adrian responded with a faint curve of his lips.

Chloe never loosened her grip.

She seized the chance to suggest.

"Adrian, I made a restaurant reservation."

But she immediately added.

"Grandpa also invited us for dinner."

"You decide."

She smiled sweetly.

Her hand didn't relax at all.

Adrian fell silent for a moment.

Mrs. Valentine lightly tapped her daughter's forehead.

"Of course we go to Grandpa's."

"The old man has been waiting forever."

She deliberately squeezed closer.

Pushing the two even nearer.

She glanced at Anna.

Purposely raising her voice.

"Adrian, is this your subordinate?"

She asked Adrian superficially.

But her eyes fixed on Anna darkly.

All attention instantly focused on her.

Anna sensed the hostility.

Knowing she was superfluous.

She spoke up proactively.

"Mr. Sinclair, I'll take my leave now."

She gave a slight nod.

Picked up her luggage and turned to leave.

Not wanting to linger at the airport.

Afraid of encountering that person again.

She unconsciously quickened her pace.
###Chapter 428

Adrian Sinclair’s gaze cut through the crowd.

A slender figure moved alone through the packed sea of people.

His heart tightened inexplicably.

His eyes remained fixed on the distant figure.

Chloe Valentine took it all in.

She exchanged a look with her parents, resentment flashing in her eyes.

But she quickly resumed her gentle demeanor.

“Adrian?”

She called to him softly.

There was no response.

Chloe took a deep breath.

She forced down her irritation.

“Grandpa has been waiting a long time,” she reminded him gently.
“We should go back now.”

Mr. Valentine stepped forward and patted Adrian’s shoulder.

He led the way forward.
“Let’s not keep the old man waiting.”

Adrian finally looked away.

He followed in silence.

Not a word was spoken the entire way.

Chloe attempted conversation.

He only gave brief, distant replies.

Mrs. Valentine observed their interaction.

She finally understood her daughter’s frustration.

But this marriage alliance could not be lost.

Countless people would kill for a chance to enter the Lowell family.

They had this opportunity only through the old man’s favor.

They had to seize it firmly.

The motorcade entered the Lowell Manor.

The old man was already waiting at the entrance, beaming.

“Grandpa!”

Chloe rushed over the moment she stepped out of the car.

She threw herself affectionately into the old man’s arms.

Grandpa laughed heartily.

He loved nothing more than seeing his grandson with her.

The scene was as warm as if they were real grandfather and granddaughter.

Adrian watched quietly.

But Anna Ross’s face appeared in his mind.

She had never received a single smile from Grandpa here.

The Valentines approached with gifts.

They handed them to Henry, who passed them to the servants.

Mrs. Valentine watched her daughter being doted on.

Her heart swelled with pride.

But she pretended to scold her.
“You’re a grown woman. Where are your manners?”

Chloe nuzzled against Grandpa, cooing.
“I just love Grandpa so much.”

Grandpa patted her back and laughed.
“Grandpa loves Chloe most too.”

Chloe lifted her chin triumphantly.

She glanced at her mother boastfully.

Mrs. Valentine shook her head indulgently.

Mr. Valentine stepped forward to exchange pleasantries with Grandpa.

Chloe took the chance to step back.

She reached for Adrian’s hand.

She thought he wouldn’t refuse in front of the elders.

But Adrian turned aside.

He neatly avoided her touch.

Chloe’s hand hung frozen in the air.

After a long moment, she slowly lowered it.

“Adrian, let’s go inside,” she said, forcing a smile.
“You must be tired.”

Adrian looked down at her.

Her attitude irritated him inexplicably.

This was his home.

Yet she acted like the lady of the house.

Chloe blushed under his gaze.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” she murmured coyly.
###Chapter 429

Adrian Sinclair's gaze swept past Chloe Valentine.

He walked directly into the living room.

The air froze for a moment.

Lydia Valentine immediately smiled to ease the tension. "Chloe is just too eager."

"Don't stand at the door. Come in and sit." Grandpa gave a slight nod to Henry.

Chloe pressed her lips together tightly.

She hated Adrian's cold demeanor the most.

He used to smile at her before.

But now...

She clenched her fingers, suppressing her dissatisfaction.

Everyone gradually entered the room.

Henry arranged for the servants to serve tea and snacks.

Harold Valentine took a sip of tea. His eyes lit up. "This tea has an elegant aroma with a long, sweet aftertaste."

"I've tasted many famous teas, but this quality is exceptional."

He took several more sips, savoring the flavor.

Grandpa stroked his beard and smiled. "Adrian brought this Da Hong Pao back from Wuyi Mountain recently."

"I love it too."

Adrian leaned back on the sofa.

His fingertips lightly tapped the armrest.

His eyes were downcast, revealing no emotion.

But Chloe noticed his distraction.

Lydia spoke up at the right moment. "Adrian is so filial. He always thinks of Grandpa."

They both looked at Adrian.

But he seemed unaware. His gaze was fixed outside the window.

The Valentines exchanged a glance.

They knew perfectly well.

The last incident had completely angered Adrian.

A man like him could only be worn down slowly.

Lydia secretly pinched her daughter, signaling her to stay calm.

Adrian suddenly stood up.

"Excuse me."

He gave a slight nod to everyone and turned to go upstairs.

Chloe instinctively wanted to follow.

Lydia grabbed her arm and shook her head gently.

Chloe bit her lip and sat back down. Her nails dug into her palms.

Lydia put down her teacup with a gentle smile. "Grandpa, you see how sincere Chloe is toward Adrian."

"The engagement party didn't happen last time. What do you think..."

She trailed off, carefully observing Grandpa's expression.

Grandpa was talking with Harold. He paused at her words.

He set down his teacup, frowning slightly.

This was indeed difficult.

They had already upset Adrian last time. Bringing it up again now...

The living room fell silent.

Lydia's face gradually paled.

In the past, Grandpa never hesitated when discussing the marriage.

"Mom."

Chloe suddenly spoke, her voice soft. "Adrian has been busy with company matters lately. You've seen it."

"I don't want to distract him with marriage plans."

Her eyes reddened slightly, glistening with tears. "I want to wait until he's finished. Until the day he willingly marries me."

Lydia hugged her daughter.

She suddenly remembered the figure at the airport. Anger flared in her heart.

"Chloe is sensible." Grandpa sighed softly. "You young people should spend more time together."

He had thought that after all this time, some feelings would have developed between them.

But now it seemed...

Chloe nodded obediently. But her gaze drifted toward the staircase.

Why wasn't he coming back down?

Her parents were right here.
###Chapter 430

Adrian Sinclair closed the door.

He leaned against it.

His mind was filled with the image of Anna Ross trembling.

Her eyes, always so stubborn.

Now brimming with pure terror.

What could frighten her so deeply?

He took out his phone.

He dialed her number.

Anna Ross sat in the taxi.

Her phone screen glowed.

Her mother had just called.

Said she bought a new house.

Wanted her to come see it.

She was looking down, checking the address.

An incoming call suddenly popped up, startling her.

It was his name.

She hesitated for a moment.

Then answered.

"Are you home?"

His voice came through the receiver.

She paused, slightly surprised.

He cared about something so trivial?

Anna shook her head.

Dismissing those unnecessary thoughts.

She answered softly.

"Yes."

"Is there something you need, Mr. Sinclair?"

Silence fell on the other end.

She could hear his faint breathing.

After a long while, he spoke again.

"Do you have to call me that?"

His voice held suppressed emotion.

Mr. Sinclair.

It rolled off her tongue so easily.

Anna frowned.

Her tone remained calm.

"What else?"

"Should I call you Mr. Sinclair?"

"Or something else?"

He was her superior.

Of course she had to address him properly.

Adrian closed his eyes.

His knuckles pressed against his temples.

He finally chose to relent.

"Forget it."

"What happened at the airport today?"

He had to ask.

Anna cut him off.

"I said it was nothing."

"Why do you always press for details?"

Couldn't she have her own secrets?

Did he have to know everything?

Adrian stared at his phone.

The screen dimmed.

Then lit up again.

He was certain of one thing.

She found him annoying.

Anger flared within him.

He called specifically to check on her.

And she showed no appreciation.

He hung up directly.

Anna looked at the blackened screen.

She sighed softly.

He was truly an enigmatic man.

She glanced at the navigation.

Almost there.

She said to the driver, "Sir, you can stop here."

She paid and got out.

An ordinary residential complex stood before her.

She stood still for a moment, lost in thought.

Then entered Building 116.

Pressed the elevator button.

Her mother said she lived in 706.

A high floor.

The elevator was necessary.

Climbing the stairs would be exhausting.

She stood outside unit 706.

Pressed the doorbell.

The door opened quickly.

Vivian Lowell saw it was her.

A smile immediately spread across her face.

"Anna, you came so fast?"

"Come in, come in."

Anna smiled sweetly.

Handed her bag to her mother.

"I came as soon as you called."

She looked around the new home.

Not very spacious.

Not comparable to the San Francisco villa.

But much better than a hotel.

Vivian's smile was especially radiant.

"Anna, come sit."

"Let me get you some fruit."

Vivian took her hand.

Led her to the living room sofa.

Anna thought about helping.

But obediently sat down instead.

A sports game played on the TV.

Probably left on by Howard Lowell.

She knew her mother didn't enjoy watching these.
###Chapter 431

Anna Ross sat for a moment.

She stood up to get something for her mother.

As she passed the restroom, she heard hushed voices inside.

"Lao Wang, I thought about what you mentioned yesterday all night. It's definitely feasible."

"But Adrian Sinclair is sharp. Would he notice if we do this?"

Howard Lowell's voice came through the door.

Anna immediately stopped walking.

She instinctively covered her mouth.

She couldn't hear the response on the other end of the phone.

Howard suddenly laughed.

"You're right! Let's discuss the details in person later."

"Someone's home today. I have to go."

Hearing footsteps approaching, Anna quickly slipped into the kitchen.

Vivian Lowell was washing fruit.

She looked surprised to see her daughter. "Anna? I thought I told you to wait in the living room."

But Anna seemed distracted.

Who was the "Lao Wang" Howard mentioned?

What were they planning to do to Adrian?

"Anna?" Vivian waved a hand in front of her face.

Anna snapped back to attention.

She took the fruit from her mother and helped wash it.

"Nothing. I was just wondering why you suddenly bought a house."

"Your father said staying in a hotel was inconvenient. He specifically bought this place."

"It's not big, but it's very comfortable." Vivian smiled happily.

Anna paused.

Howard actually considered these things.

It seemed he planned to stay in New York long-term.

"What are you two talking about?" Howard walked into the kitchen smiling.

His tone was unusually gentle.

Vivian brought out a fruit platter. "Our daughter helped wash the fruit. Come try some."

The scene resembled a happy family of three.

But Anna didn't believe it.

She had suffered too much.

She no longer trusted appearances easily.

Howard noticed her standing still.

He reached out to pull her. "Anna, your mother is calling you."

Anna sidestepped his hand. "I know."

She quickly walked out of the kitchen.

She sat down beside her mother.

Howard followed and sat opposite them.

"Anna, what do you think of this house?"

He ate a grape and gestured around the room.

Anna responded flatly, "It's nice."

Vivian peeled a pear and handed it to her. "Anna, do you want to move back home?"

Anna immediately shook her head. "No, Mom. My current place is close to the company. It's very convenient."

She had finally escaped his control.

She would never come back.

Vivian was startled by her decisiveness.

Then she smiled. "Okay. Mom just misses you too much."
###Chapter 432

"Mom." Anna's voice was soft, laced with guilt.

Since arriving in New York, work had consumed nearly all her energy.

She had spent far too little time with her mother.

Howard studied her for a moment, then suddenly clapped his hands with a smile.

"Alright then, Anna stays tonight."

"Have a good talk with your mother."

"You can come to the company with me tomorrow morning."

He smiled on the surface, but his mind was busy calculating.

Anna Ross was a pawn he still needed to keep in his hand.

But he couldn't push too hard right now.

Vivian's eyes lit up, and she immediately stood.

"Then I'll start preparing dinner right now."

She tied on her apron and walked briskly into the kitchen.

Anna had initially wanted to refuse.

But seeing the hopeful look in her mother's eyes, she swallowed her words.

Spending more time with her mother would be good.

Howard suddenly leaned in, lowering his voice.

"Anna, how are things with Adrian Sinclair lately?"

He rubbed his hands together, his eyes sharp and calculating.

Anna frowned slightly.

"No progress."

Her tone was flat, revealing no emotion.

Howard's expression darkened.

"You did well last time."

"Just put in a bit more effort. Securing him shouldn't be difficult."

He recalled the results of his last probe.

Adrian did care about this girl.

It seemed this move wasn't wrong.

Anna rubbed her temples.

"I was genuinely injured last time."

Her voice carried weariness.

Howard was taken aback.

He had assumed it was a calculated act.

He hadn't expected it to be real.

He immediately switched to a concerned expression.

"Are you alright now?"

His gaze swept over her neck. The marks had already faded.

Anna turned her face away.

"It's healed."

This false concern sickened her.

Howard's eyes flickered.

"Anna, about what we discussed last time..."

"You must help me."

Anna frowned.

"I'm not by his side right now."

"I can't help you."

Vivian happened to come out carrying dishes.

Hearing the conversation, her steps faltered.

Howard shot her a meaningful look.

Vivian set down the plates and sat beside her daughter.

Howard seized the opportunity to stand and leave.

He cast a significant glance their way before departing.

Vivian was silent for a moment before speaking softly.

"Annie, please just help him."

She reached out to take her daughter's hand.

Anna snatched her hand back sharply.

"Mom!"

She couldn't believe her mother would say such a thing.

Vivian lowered her head.

Her voice was almost inaudible.

"Do it for me."

"Okay?"
###Chapter 433

Anna Ross stood frozen in place, her gaze fixed on her mother's face.

Vivian Lowell withdrew her hand, her eyes dropping to the floor. "Anna, I know you've suffered so much because of me. But everything I do is for your own good!"

"Every time I see other mothers and daughters sharing such warmth, my heart aches. Their daughters can stay by their sides, but my daughter has to work so hard out in the world. It breaks my heart."

Anna's fingers trembled slightly. She never thought it was hard. As long as she could protect her mother, everything was worth it.

Even working late into the night, even scrimping and saving. As long as she could save enough money, she could take her mother far away from all this.

But she could never bring herself to hurt someone else. Especially not him, the one she had already hurt once.

"Mom, I'm willing to do anything else, but this..."

She swallowed her words of refusal. She couldn't bear to see the disappointment in her mother's eyes.

Vivian suddenly grabbed her hands, a burning intensity in her eyes. "Anna, your father said you just need to keep an eye on Adrian Sinclair. That's all! No harm will come to anyone!"

Seeing the desperate hope in her mother's eyes, Anna finally relented. "Alright, I'll do it." But she silently vowed to herself that she would never betray her conscience.

She needed to raise the money quickly and get her mother out of this mess.

Vivian wept with joy, pulling her daughter into a tight embrace. Outside the door, Howard Lowell smirked coldly.

The Lowell empire would soon be in his grasp.

......

The night was deep as Anna returned to work at the bar. After two days away, she found herself strangely missing the stage.

"Anna, you're finally back! The customers have been driving me crazy these past two days!" Pamela gestured dramatically, pulling up surveillance footage as proof.

On the screen, customers were clamoring for her to perform. Anna sighed, rubbing her temples. She hadn't realized she was this popular.

"Pamela, I'll sing a few extra songs tonight to make up for it." She set her things down and quickly made her way to the stage.

Pamela beamed, feeling like her prayers had been answered this year. She had truly found a treasure.

The customers erupted into cheers as Anna took the stage, whistles filling the air like at a concert.

The regular singer reluctantly stepped aside. As she passed Anna, she suddenly stopped. "Hello, Miss Ross. I'm Niki."

Anna paused, not recalling this person at the bar before. Still, she smiled politely. "Hello, Niki. Do I know you?"
###Chapter 434

She paused in surprise.

This was clearly their first meeting.

Yet the girl had called her by name with perfect accuracy.

Niki suddenly laughed.

Her eyes curved into crescents when she smiled.

Like two delicate moon slices.

But her makeup was overly heavy.

It nearly obscured her naturally delicate features.

"You're quite famous around here."

"Who wouldn't know you?"

Anna Ross felt a flush of embarrassment.

She lowered her head and pressed her lips together.

"Not at all."

"Don't be modest."

"Get on stage now."

"The audience can hardly wait."

Niki glanced toward the crowd.

They were chanting Anna's name in unison.

Showing no regret over her own departure.

Niki quickly descended from the stage.

She leaned against the bar and ordered a drink.

Her fingertips tapped lightly against the glass.

Was she really so inferior to Anna Ross?

Anna pushed aside her thoughts.

She focused completely on her performance.

Cheers washed over her like tidal waves.

At the bar's entrance.

Chloe Valentine entered with Adrian Sinclair on her arm.

"Adrian, a friend mentioned this place has a hugely popular performer."

"Supposedly incredibly beautiful."

"Shall we listen for a while?"

She checked the bar's name.

A subtle smile touched her lips.

She had already discovered Anna worked here.

What kind of clean person would work in such a place?

Today, she would make Adrian see Anna's true nature.

Adrian gave the bar's sign a brief glance.

He followed her inside.

His grandfather had insisted he spend time with Chloe.

He had little interest initially.

But hearing the bar's name changed his mind.

It had been too long since he last heard her sing.

Upon entering.

A wave of enthusiastic cheers greeted them.

The entire crowd was shouting Anna Ross's name.

Chloe froze.

This was nothing like the chaotic scene she had imagined.

It resembled a small concert instead.

She looked toward the stage.

Anna sat on a high stool singing.

A white spotlight illuminated her profile.

Her heartfelt performance was utterly captivating.

Even Chloe felt unexpectedly drawn in.

This completely derailed her plan.

She quickly turned to look beside her.

Adrian was fixed on the stage.

His gaze intense and profound.

Chloe's jealousy ignited instantly.

She couldn't let him keep watching.

"Adrian, my feet are tired."

"Shall we sit over there?"

She pointed toward a corner booth.

Feigning discomfort, she rubbed her ankle.

Adrian's lips curved slightly.

He motioned for her to go ahead.

But she kept hold of his arm.

Pulling him firmly toward the seats.

He suppressed his impatience.

Following her to sit down.

Chloe immediately ordered numerous drinks.

Covering the entire table.

"I have to drive later."

"You ordered so much."

"Do you plan to drink it all yourself?"
###Chapter 435

Chloe Valentine was startled by his sudden question.

She did have ulterior motives for ordering so much alcohol.

But she couldn't let him see through her.

"Adrian, it's fine."

"You rarely come out with me."

"Just a little drink."

"We can always call the driver later."

She smiled while pouring the wine.

She handed the glass to him.

Adrian Sinclair frowned.

His gaze shifted to the stage.

He had to admit.

She looked captivating while singing.

She poured genuine emotion into her performance.

That's why she shone so brightly.

As he kept thinking.

A faint smile unconsciously appeared on his lips.

Chloe caught that smile instantly.

She glared resentfully at the person on stage.

Almost biting her lip in frustration.

This was simply handing victory to someone else!

She never should have brought him here.

But he never liked going out.

Backing out now would only anger him.

Just as she fumed.

A familiar figure entered through the door.

She looked closer.

It was Lucas Evans.

Chloe glanced at him.

Then back at the stage.

A plan suddenly formed in her mind.

She put down her glass.

Leaned close to Adrian's ear.

"Adrian, wait for me."

"I'm going to the restroom."

Adrian gave an absent-minded hum.

Seemingly indifferent to her whereabouts.

Chloe suppressed her anger.

Stood up and melted into the crowd.

Lucas saw the figure on stage.

His anxious heart finally settled.

During his nap, he had a nightmare.

He dreamed she kept drifting away.

No matter how he reached out.

He couldn't grasp her.

His heart ached terribly in that moment.

So much it made him sweat all over.

After waking, he wanted to message her.

But feared she wouldn't answer.

So he came straight to the bar.

He knew she would be here.

"Mr. Evans, I didn't expect to see you at a bar?"

Chloe had already reached his side.

Following his gaze.

He was watching Anna Ross.

She almost laughed at the sight.

What was wrong with these men?

Each one bewitched by her.

Lucas showed no reaction.

As if he hadn't heard her.

He simply watched the stage quietly.

As if it held his entire world.

Chloe's expression shifted.

She spoke again.

"Mr. Evans, Executive Assistant Ross won't finish for a while."

"Shall we sit and talk?"

Lucas finally looked down at her.

He walked to the sofa and sat.

"What did you want to say, Miss Valentine?"

"Aren't we a bit unfamiliar for that?"

A server passed by.

He took a glass of wine.

Drank it unhurriedly.

Chloe watched for a few seconds.

Smiled and walked over to sit.

She had to admit Lucas was handsome.

Though not quite as striking as Adrian.

Still far superior to most men.

"Mr. Evans, unfamiliarity can change with time."

"Talking more will make us familiar."

Chloe sat close to him.

Picked up her glass and took a small sip.

She normally avoided people who liked Anna Ross.

But he still had use for her now.

She didn't mind playing along for a while.
###Chapter 436

Lucas Evans let out a cold laugh, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "Aren't you Adrian Sinclair's fiancée?"

"It wouldn't end well if he found out you're cozying up to another man behind his back."

His gaze swept over her.

Chloe Valentine instinctively looked toward Adrian.

But his attention was completely fixed on Anna Ross. He hadn't even noticed who she was talking to.

This fueled her hatred even more.

Anna Ross was like a siren, luring men's souls away.

"Adrian wouldn't mind. He loves spoiling me and gives me absolute freedom."

"Most importantly, he never loses his temper with me."

Chloe gently set down her glass and elegantly tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear.

Lucas scoffed loudly. "But what I've heard tells a different story."

"It seems Adrian Sinclair doesn't really care about you at all."

Chloe froze instantly, her face turning ashen.

Lucas took a pleased sip of his drink. "Miss Valentine, instead of wasting time with me, you should focus more on keeping an eye on your man."

"Otherwise, the day someone steals him away, you'll be crying too late."

He swirled his glass and downed the contents in one go.

Chloe stared blankly at the man before her.

This Lucas Evans was usually gentle and refined, but now he seemed unfathomable.

She set her glass down and remained silent for a moment before speaking. "Mr. Evans, why do you harbor such hostility toward me?"

She couldn't recall ever offending him, yet his words were laced with barbs, clearly showing his dislike.

Lucas lazily turned his head, his eyes filled with disdain. "Do you really think I don't know about all those things you did to Anna?"

"I'm only holding back for her sake."

Those things!?

Chloe's heart shuddered. How could he possibly know?

Unless that bitch Anna Ross told him!

"Mr. Evans, how could I ever harm her? I've always considered her a good friend. Your words are too hurtful."

She forced a smile.

Lucas suddenly stood up, giving her a cold glance. "I wouldn't say such things if I didn't know."

"You better behave. Otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite."

Chloe stood frozen in place, watching his retreating back in disbelief.

How ridiculous. He actually dared to threaten her?

But she would not obey.

As long as Anna Ross dared to cling to Adrian, she had a hundred ways to get rid of her.

Just then, Anna finished her song and stepped off the stage.

Chloe hurried back to Adrian's side, afraid he would go looking for that bitch if she let her guard down for even a second.

Adrian glanced at the time and frowned slightly. "You were gone for over half an hour?"

Chloe suppressed the panic in her heart and offered a sweet smile. "My mother called. We talked for a while."
###Chapter 437

Adrian Sinclair's gaze lingered on her briefly before shifting away.

Chloe Valentine glanced into the distance. Lucas Evans had already approached Anna Ross. They were speaking in low tones.

Her eyes darted subtly. She feigned surprise. "Adrian, look over there. Executive Assistant Ross and Lucas are here too. Did they come together?"

Adrian followed her line of sight. Chloe was pleased to see the subtle shift in his expression.

She felt a secret thrill. Now he would finally see their unusual connection.

"What does it have to do with me?" Adrian's voice was cold. He turned his attention back to the bustling dance floor.

Chloe was stunned. Shouldn't he be angry? His reaction was completely unexpected.

Anna finished gathering her things. Lucas remained close behind her.

"Lucas, you really don't need to see me home. I can manage," she said with resignation.

Lucas offered a gentle smile. "Anna, I came to find you for an important reason. Please don't refuse me."

Anna paused. She ultimately did not protest again.

After retrieving their items, Lucas followed her out. Adrian was already waiting by the entrance. Seeing them approach, he immediately turned away.

He didn't know why he did it. Yet he couldn't stop himself from watching her interaction with Lucas.

Once they exited, he quietly followed.

Lucas walked beside Anna. His gaze never left her. He thought time would fade his feelings. Instead, his affection had only grown deeper.

"Anna, if I could take you away from here, would you come with me?" The words escaped him before he could stop them.

Anna stopped walking. She looked at him, puzzled.

Lucas pressed his lips together. "You're staying here because of your mother, aren't you?"

Anna's heart jolted. "What do you mean?"

Had he been investigating her? How else would he know?

Not far away, an intense gaze was fixed on the pair.

Lucas's expression shifted slightly. He quickly regained his composure. He took her hand. "Anna, I just care about you too much. I tried to stop liking you. I can't."

His voice cracked with emotion. Anna pulled her hand back. She created distance. "Lucas, I've told you I don't feel that way. Please stop investing your emotions in me. It's not worth it."

"This is my private matter. Please don't inquire further. And don't say things like this again. Or we can't even be friends."

She was unusually calm. From the start, she had been clear she wouldn't return his feelings. She knew she didn't deserve it.

Besides, affection could never be forced.
###Chapter 438

She only hoped Lucas would understand this issue.

After saying this, Anna Ross turned to leave.

Lucas Evans grabbed her wrist.

He was silent for a moment, his voice low. "You won't give me a chance because of Adrian Sinclair, right? You've reunited with him and rekindled your old flame?"

Anna's heart jolted. She shook off his hand forcefully. "Lucas, this has nothing to do with anyone else. I don't like you. I can't return your feelings. Please stop wasting your time on me."

A sudden chill ran down her spine.

It felt like a pair of eyes were watching her intently from the shadows.

Lucas's eyes instantly brightened when he heard it wasn't because of Adrian.

So he still had a chance.

He didn't believe in the idea of never liking someone.

As long as he persisted, he could win her over one day.

"Anna, I was too impulsive just now. I said things I shouldn't have. Please don't be angry." His attitude suddenly softened as he apologized in a humble tone.

Anna frowned, confused by his erratic behavior. "Lucas, did you hear what I said?"

She had clearly stated she would never like him.

She hoped he would stop pestering her.

Lucas nodded repeatedly, his smile unusually sincere. "I heard everything. I'll listen to you and behave."

Anna felt a creeping dread.

He seemed like a complete obsessive right now.

One wrong step could lead to a disastrous fall.

She steadied herself, her voice calm. "Since you understand, I'm going home now. You should head back early too."

She pushed his hand away again.

Lucas's expression shifted. He tried to reach for her once more.

"Don't follow me. I want to be alone." Anna stopped him before he could move.

Lucas froze in place like a withered plant.

He looked as if a strong wind could knock him over.

Adrian's eyes turned cold. He was about to step forward.

Chloe Valentine suddenly rushed out from the side. She clung tightly to his arm, whining tearfully. "Adrian, why did you come out here? While you were gone, several strange men tried to hit on me. I was so scared."

Adrian was forced to stop.

He could only watch the slender figure walk further away, eventually disappearing into the darkness.

His gaze darkened as he looked down at the person beside him. "Chloe, if you were scared, you shouldn't have brought me here in the first place."

Chloe's heart trembled.

Had he figured something out?

She looked up and saw Lucas standing there alone.

Where was Anna? Why was he by himself?

According to her plan, Adrian should have witnessed an intimate scene between the two.

That way, he would stop thinking about Anna.

Last time, if it weren't for Sophia Roscente interfering, they would already be engaged.

"Adrian, I just wanted to help you relax. I want to go home now. Can you take me back?" She was unwilling, but since Anna was gone, there was no reason to stay.

Adrian raised his hand, signaling for her to let go.
###Chapter 439

Chloe Valentine bit her lip until it turned white.

Her fingertips were pale from clenching too hard.

She released her hand, eyes filled with resentment.

Adrian Sinclair turned to drive.

He dropped Chloe off at her home and headed straight back to his villa.

Her parents were still in New York.

He didn't want to return to his grandfather's place.

Going back would only mean endless nagging.

He dialed his grandfather.

The old man's voice was displeased. "Adrian, why aren't you back? I told you to bring Chloe along."

Adrian bent over, rubbing his temples.

"Grandpa, I've said I don't want to get married."

"Nothing has changed."

Their initial meeting was forced upon him.

If not for his grandfather's hospitalization, he would never have gone.

Silence lingered on the other end.

His grandfather sighed. "Adrian, I know you're unwilling."

"But all of this is for your own good."

Adrian pulled out a cigarette and placed it between his lips.

"I have the ability to stand on my own."

"I don't need a marriage to secure my position."

He eventually put the cigarette down.

His grandfather suddenly started coughing.

"Adrian, this matter is not up for discussion."

"Unless you no longer care about this old bones."

Adrian's voice turned grim. "Grandpa!"

He could give up everything.

But he would never harm his grandfather.

His mother's final words still echoed in his ears.

The old man chuckled lightly. "In life, can everything truly go your way?"

Adrian lit the cigarette.

The flame flickered, smoke blurring his features.

He once told Marcus Hill he would never agree to an arranged marriage.

Yet now, he was the one trapped.

......

Anna Ross returned home.

The lights were on. Sophia Roscente was back.

Sophia was curled on the sofa, playing on her laptop.

She cheered upon seeing Anna enter. "Did you miss me, sis?"

Anna bent down to change her shoes.

"Sophia, I'm exhausted."

"I'm going to rest now. You should sleep early too."

Sophia was stunned.

She still had things to say.

Her intuition told her something was wrong.

She messaged her cousin, but received no reply.

Sophia sighed.

The adult world was so difficult to understand.

She needed to ask Marcus Hill for information.

The next day, Anna went to work listlessly.

During her lunch break, Noah Watson suddenly approached.

Anna was surprised.

They hadn't seen each other much since she left her executive assistant position.

"Assistant Watson, is something the matter?"
###Chapter 440

Noah Watson stood by her workstation with a professional smile.

"Mr. Sinclair wants you in his office now."

Anna Ross paused, her fingers stilling.

She really didn't want to go.
She couldn't guess what he intended to do this time.

Noah noticed her hesitation and softened his tone.
"Please, Anna."
"If you don't go, he'll take it out on me again."

He recalled his boss's cold expression and shivered.

Anna clenched her fist.
Noah had always been decent to her.
She couldn't bring herself to refuse.
"Alright. I'm going."

Noah sighed in relief and hurried away.

Anna stared at her lunch tray, her appetite gone.
He could have called.
He sent someone instead.
Clearly, he wanted to deny her any chance to refuse.

She set down her fork and knife and headed for the executive elevator.

The office door was slightly ajar.
She knocked.

"Come in."
His voice was lazy.

She pushed the door open.
He was lounging in his executive chair.
The glow from his phone screen reflected in his eyes.
He looked completely at ease.

"What did you need?"
She remained by the door, her tone cold.
"I have a lot of work to finish."

Adrian Sinclair set his phone down and rose slowly.
He walked toward her, step by step.
"Starting today, you're reinstated as my Executive Assistant."

Anna's breath caught.
"You were the one who dismissed me. Now you want me back?"
"Do you enjoy being so capricious?"

His eyes darkened as he leaned back against the desk.
"What I say goes here."
"You will obey."

Anna bit her lower lip.
He always knew how to pressure her.

Adrian chuckled softly.
"From now on, you come when I call."
"Every time you're late, it's a pay deduction."

She wanted to curse.
"Why are you doing this to me?"

"Who says I'm doing anything?"
He suddenly wrapped an arm around her waist.
He pulled her sharply against his chest.

Anna struggled to push him away.
He only held her tighter.

Adrian bent close to her ear.
"Is this what you hate?"
"Or... do you hate this more?"

"You're despicable!"
She trembled with anger.

He didn't move, his fingers brushing through her hair.
"Calling you my Assistant is despicable?"
"Will you accept it or not?"
###Chapter 441

Anna Ross leaned back.

She tried to create distance between them.

"What do you want!?"

Adrian Sinclair's lips curved slightly.

His gaze fell on her profile, outlined by sunlight.

"Be my Executive Assistant. I've made myself clear."

He lounged lazily against the desk.

He clearly had no intention of letting her go easily.

Anna pushed him.

The man instead stepped half a pace closer.

His warm breath brushed past her ear.

Shadows moved beyond the office glass walls.

Her heart raced suddenly.

She feared someone might witness this intimate scene.

"Fine, I agree," she finally conceded, defeated.

Her voice was laced with resignation.

Adrian released his grip.

As he turned, a flicker of amusement shone in his eyes.

"You should have agreed sooner."

He deliberately lowered his voice.

"Did you refuse just now because you wanted this?"

Anna was silent for a moment.

She forced out four words.

"You're insane."

Adrian, unusually, wasn't angry.

Instead, he seemed in a good mood as he offered her a water glass.

She pushed it away.

"You'll remain in the HR Department," he added to her retreating back.

"But your duties as my Executive Assistant continue."

Anna didn't break stride.

She pulled the door open and left directly.

In the hallway, she pressed a hand to her wildly beating heart.

She wondered if she was ill.

Otherwise, why did she lose control every time she saw him?

Howard Lowell's figure suddenly appeared around a corner.

Anna immediately ducked into the emergency stairwell.

She would rather climb several flights of stairs.

She wanted no interaction with him whatsoever.

She suddenly remembered that phone call.

She should have warned Adrian to be careful.

But the timing was wrong now.

She would have to find another opportunity.

Before leaving work, Mia Lawrence called.

Her voice was chirpy, asking to go shopping.

Anna was somewhat surprised.

She had just returned from a long trip and wasn't even tired.

But she agreed to meet on time anyway.

She waited for her friend to clock out downstairs.

"Anna, wait two more minutes!" Mia called from the end of the line.

She made a heart gesture.

Anna smiled and nodded.

She walked to the lounge area and checked her phone.

A red dot indicated unread messages in her social feed.

Julian Garnache had posted a rare update.

A photo showed a table full of home-cooked dishes.

The caption read, "Long-awaited warmth."

She was smiling slightly when someone tapped her shoulder lightly.

Mia leaned in to look at the screen.

"What's got you so happy?"
###Chapter 442

She leaned in to look, but her face instantly flushed red.

Anna Ross immediately sensed something was off and asked with a smile, "Mia, what's really going on between you and Julian now?"

"Don't guess wildly. There's nothing between us." Mia Lawrence denied it verbally, but her fingers swiftly opened her phone.

She had actually missed his social media update. This was absolutely unforgivable.

She quickly liked that post. She wanted to leave a comment but feared Anna might see it, so she held back.

Anna was about to tease her further when Mia urgently covered her mouth and pulled her forward. "You promised to go shopping with me today! No more talking about this!"

"Alright, alright, I won't say anything. Please let go first." Anna shook her head helplessly. She was genuinely happy for her best friend.

The two walked toward the mall, laughing and joking.

Just after getting out of the car, Mia's phone suddenly vibrated. Seeing the message, she covered her mouth in surprise.

Anna moved closer and asked, "What's wrong?"

Mia was too excited to speak and simply handed her the phone. Anna understood everything the moment she saw the message content.

"You two are moving this fast?" She pretended to be angry and glared at her friend. "You actually kept it from me."

Mia was equally surprised. She never expected Julian Garnache to offer to come over himself. She suddenly touched her face nervously. "Anna, maybe we shouldn't let him come. I didn't even put on makeup today…"

Anna couldn't help but laugh. "You're beautiful. You look great even without makeup."

"Really?" Mia still wasn't reassured. She ran to a mirror to check her reflection again and again. "Maybe I should go buy a new outfit first?"

Anna held her back. "Really, it's not necessary. You look perfect just like this."

Mia finally felt slightly more at ease, then suddenly thought of something else. "Then I'll go buy some coffee. He can have some when he arrives." With that, she rushed into the coffee shop.

Anna watched her best friend's busy figure and followed her inside with a resigned sigh.

So this is what it feels like to like someone—it truly makes you tread carefully.

The two sat in the coffee shop for a while before Julian arrived right on time.

"Julian, over here!" Mia quickly waved.

Julian walked over and naturally ruffled Anna's hair. "You heartless girl. If I don't reach out, you never remember to visit me."

Anna swatted his hand away in protest. "How many times do I have to say it? I've grown up now!"
###Chapter 443

Julian Garnache withdrew his hand.

The corners of his lips lifted slightly.

"Anna is too adorable."

"I couldn't help myself."

Anna Ross shot him a glance.

She lowered her head and sipped her coffee.

Julian turned to Mia Lawrence.

He handed her a small bag.

"Mia, you left this in my car."

Mia's cheeks flushed pink.

She remembered that social media post.

Her heart skipped a beat.

"Thank you, Julian."

Julian laughed warmly.

"No need to be polite."

He casually picked up his coffee cup.

After a small taste, his eyes brightened.

"Anna, did you buy this?"

Mia's fingers tightened slightly.

She explained quietly.

"I bought it…"

"Do you not like this flavor?"

Julian shook his head with a soft laugh.

"I love it."

"This is my usual order."

Mia secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

She quietly memorized the flavor.

Julian glanced at his watch.

"Weren't we going shopping?"

"My treat today."

Mia's eyes lit up.

She grabbed Anna's hand.

They exchanged smiles.

They quickly walked toward the shopping mall.

Julian shook his head helplessly.

He picked up his coffee and followed.

The clothing store had soft lighting.

A sales associate approached with a smile.

"Would you like me to show you our new arrivals?"

Mia waved her hand.

"We'll just browse ourselves."

The associate politely stepped back.

Mia picked up a floral dress.

"Anna, this would suit you."

"I'm buying it for you."

Anna quickly refused.

"I can't wear it now."

"The weather is getting colder."

Mia insisted on buying it.

"I got a promotion and raise."

"I must buy my best friend clothes."

Anna felt warmth in her heart.

Julian spoke up quietly.

"Ladies."

"Did you forget about me?"

Mia immediately straightened up, becoming proper.

Anna was about to laugh at her.

A clear voice called out from nearby.

"Sis!"

Sophia Roscente ran over cheerfully.

Marcus Hill followed behind her.

His hands were full of shopping bags.

A resigned smile was on his face.

Sophia linked arms with Anna.

"If I knew you were shopping too."

"I wouldn't have brought him."

She turned and made a face at Marcus.
###Chapter 444

Marcus Hill held numerous shopping bags, wanting to scratch his head in frustration.

"Seriously, I'm carrying everything, and you're the one complaining?"

Since when was that fair?

Sophia Roscente stuck her tongue out at him, then turned her attention to the unfamiliar man nearby.

"Sis, who's this?"

Anna Ross quickly introduced him. "This is my friend."

Julian Garnache smiled warmly. "Hello, I'm Julian, Anna's brother."

Sophia's eyes lit up instantly. "If you're her brother, then you're my brother too! Hi, brother!"

Julian was pleasantly surprised. Her lively, sweet demeanor reminded him of his own sister.

Marcus immediately protested. "You never call me brother no matter how much I ask! But you call him that so easily?"

Why didn't he get that treatment?

Sophia ignored him, linking arms with Anna. "Sis, you guys keep shopping. I need to use the restroom."

"Okay." Anna watched her skip away, a soft laugh escaping her lips.

The girl was like a little sparrow, chattering happily wherever she went—a veritable ray of sunshine.

Mia Lawrence moved closer. "Anna, your cousin is adorable. I envy her carefree spirit."

Anna noticed Marcus looking smug nearby, as if saying, See how charming my girlfriend is?

The two men found a place to sit and rest while the women continued browsing.

Mia tried on several outfits, all of which Anna thought looked great on her.

Overwhelmed by choices, Anna decided to take a short break.

As she turned, she collided with a solid chest.

Her forehead throbbed with pain. She covered it, quickly apologizing. "I'm so sorry."

The person remained silent.

When she looked up and saw who it was, she froze instantly.

Pointing at the man towering over her, she stammered, "Y-you... what are you doing here?"

Adrian Sinclair raised an eyebrow, his gaze settling on her reddened forehead. "Why can't I be here?"

He leaned in closer. Anna hastily stepped back. "This is a public mall! Don't do anything reckless!"

A playful smile touched Adrian's lips. "What's going through your mind? Did you think I was going to do something to you?"

He reached out and plucked a tiny piece of lint from her hair.

"......"

Anna swallowed hard, straightening her posture. "You could have just told me. I could have done it myself."

Did he have to stand so close?

Adrian straightened up, studying her with amusement.

The mall's warm lighting cast a soft glow, making her flushed cheeks look especially captivating.

Anna lowered her head, her fingers twisting together unconsciously.

"Cousin, what are you doing here?" Sophia's clear voice suddenly cut through the tension, shattering the quiet moment.
###Chapter 445

Sophia Roscente bounded over, lively as a little rabbit.

Anna Ross cast a questioning look, as if asking how he got here.
She blinked, shaking her head gently to show she didn't know either.

Marcus Hill saw his good friend appear and immediately teared up, rushing over.
He practically tried to hang his entire body on him.
"Adrian, you came at the perfect time. Help me carry some of this."

He passed over the heavy shopping bags, gazing at him pleadingly, hoping for rescue.

Adrian Sinclair merely glanced at them briefly before looking away.

Marcus immediately realized he was doing it on purpose.
He had no intention of helping.
"Fine. So our usual brotherhood is fake, huh? You won't even help with this?"

He was so angry he felt dizzy.
He really wanted to throw this leisurely spectator to the ground, pick him up, and repeat it a hundred times to vent his anger.

"Marcus Hill, what do you mean? Are you saying I tired you out?" Sophia stamped her foot and charged forward to grab his ear.

Marcus quickly begged for mercy, hiding behind Adrian like a frightened puppy with innocent eyes.

Sophia rolled up her sleeves, glaring furiously at the person over there.
But because her cousin was present, she didn't dare go over.
She could only run to Anna's side and complain, "Sister, he's bullying me. You have to help me!"

Before she could even speak, Marcus couldn't help but retort, "Hey, hey, hey. Get your story straight. Who's bullying who right now? There are so many people watching."

"Whatever. Adrian, you have to give me justice!" He said, shrinking further behind Adrian.

Adrian swept a glance at the person behind him.
Receiving the plea for help, he cleared his throat softly, unsure what to say.

Meanwhile, Sophia also shook Anna's arm, pouting and acting spoiled.
"Sister, he's so smug. Can you bear to see me being bullied?"

"......"

Anna only felt sweat beading on her forehead.
She covered her face, speechless.

Across from them, Mia Lawrence and Julian Garnache watched this scene and immediately found a place to sit.
They sipped their coffee with an expression of watching a show.

This scene was simply too entertaining.

Mia bit her straw, sighing inwardly that Adrian looked best when he stood by her best friend's side.
Though Lucas wasn't bad either, she recently felt he was somewhat gloomy.

Adrian gazed at the person before him, his emotions in turmoil.

He had to admit, ever since the last engagement incident, it was becoming increasingly difficult to control his emotions.
Especially when facing her.

Sophia's eyes darted around.
She pulled Anna forward.
"Hmph, Marcus. This young lady is going shopping today. I don't want to waste time with you."

Anna was suddenly pulled along.
She looked back at Mia.
The other party smiled, indicating it was fine.
Then everyone else followed.

Julian glanced over this way before leaving, not saying much.

Marcus finally stepped out from behind him and sighed.
"Ah, Anna and Julian get along quite well. They even came out shopping together."

His response was met with silence.
The other party seemed unmoved, just staring expressionlessly at the group walking ahead.
###Chapter 446

Marcus Hill cleared his throat.

He leaned closer to Adrian Sinclair's ear.

"What do girls want when they drag men out shopping?"

Adrian gave him a sidelong glance.

Marcus shook the shopping bags in his hand.

"They want help carrying things."

He grinned and handed the bags over.

"Perfect timing."

"Your chance to impress."

Adrian looked away.

"That's you."

He started walking forward.

Marcus stood frozen for a moment.

He shook his head helplessly.

The figure ahead was already distant.

He hurried to catch up.

"Wait for me!"

He muttered complaints.

"So heartless."

Sophia Roscente linked arms with Anna Ross.

They entered the cosmetics section.

A dazzling array of products came into view.

Sophia's eyes instantly lit up.

"It's been so long since I went shopping."

"I want to buy everything!"

Anna smiled faintly.

She hadn't shopped in a long time either.

Every day was just about earning money.

She never properly rewarded herself.

Thinking about it, it did seem rather dull.

She glanced at the price tags.

The numbers were startling.

She turned to look elsewhere.

Mia Lawrence was laughing with Julian Garnache.

She didn't want to interrupt.

She browsed alone.

Sophia suddenly appeared.

"Sis, this would suit you."

She held up a lipstick.

Anna shook her head gently.

"I just bought one recently."

Sophia examined the lipstick repeatedly.

She thought the color was perfect.

A sales assistant approached at just the right moment.

"This is the last one."

"It's a popular shade."

Sophia gasped.

"Only one left?"

She looked at Anna.

The other still refused.

She bit her lip.

She decided to buy it first.

Footsteps sounded behind them.

Sophia's eyes brightened.

She waved and called out.

"Cousin, over here!"

Anna's heart skipped a beat.

She looked up.

Adrian walked over slowly.

The sales assistants all glanced his way.

They whispered about his appearance.

Sophia raised an eyebrow smugly.

She walked up to Adrian.

She put her hands behind her back playfully.

"It's rare for you to come out, Cousin."

"You should buy some gifts, right?"

Adrian's gaze fell on Anna.

He scanned the store.

He spoke calmly.

"Pick anything."

"I'll pay."
###Chapter 447

The salesgirl couldn't help but gasp. "Oh my! He's not just handsome, but also incredibly generous. What a perfect boyfriend!"

Sophia Roscente hopped excitedly and handed him the lipstick. "Here, I picked this for my sister. You can pay for it."

Seeing Adrian Sinclair didn't react, she shoved the lipstick into his hand and dashed back to Marcus Hill.

Anna Ross froze, meeting Adrian's intense gaze. Her fingers tightened slightly. "We don't need to buy this. I'll just put it back."

She took a few steps forward to retrieve the lipstick. Sophia could be willful, but she couldn't.

Adrian raised his hand, holding the lipstick high. Anna stopped in her tracks, quietly watching him.

"Wrap it up." Adrian glanced at the salesgirl who had been watching the scene.

The salesgirl quickly took the lipstick with respect, promising to package it carefully.

Adrian lowered his hand, his eyes fixed on her. "Who said I didn't want to buy it? If one isn't enough, I can buy the entire store for you."

Anna frowned. Every eye in the store was on them, filled with envy.

Mia Lawrence noticed the commotion and rushed over, grabbing her friend's hand. "Adrian, only buying for Anna? That's so偏心!"

"Mia." Anna looked at her in surprise.

Mia secretly squeezed her hand, signaling her to stay quiet.

Adrian glanced at Julian Garnache not far away, a slight smile touching his lips. "Pick whatever you want." He pulled a Black Card from his leather card holder and handed it to Anna. "Use it as you like."

Anna felt dizzy, unable to help but steal a few more glances at him. Was something off about him today?

Sophia was so excited she nearly jumped, internally praising her cousin for doing so well. This was how to outshine other men!

Marcus saw through her little scheme and watched the drama unfold.

Mia stared at the Black Card, her eyes wide. It represented more money than most people earn in a lifetime, and he just handed it over so casually?

Since he agreed, it would be a waste not to spend it. Mia reached out to take it.

Anna immediately pulled her back, speaking calmly to the man. "Thank you, but it's not necessary."

"Huh?" Mia didn't finish before Anna dragged her away.

She looked back at the Black Card, inwardly mourning the missed opportunity!

Sophia sighed. This wasn't how she imagined the scene would go.

The two walked over to Julian Garnache. Mia was still heartbroken over the Black Card.

Adrian watched them, his expression darkening. Was she refusing his money because another man was present?

He took back the card. The salesgirl returned with the packaged lipstick, looking confused when she saw the girl was gone.

"Sir, this lipstick..."

"Give it to me." Adrian took the lipstick, holding it tightly. He turned to pay.

Seeing her cousin wasn't completely clueless, Sophia felt relieved and continued shopping.

The group spent a little more time at the mall. Anna only bought one item—a gift for her mother. She realized she hadn't gotten her mom anything, so she chose a piece of clothing.
###Chapter 448

Anna Ross scanned the code to pay.

She reached for the shopping bag the clerk held.

Two hands extended toward her at the same time.

Adrian Sinclair and Julian Garnache's hands collided.

An invisible tension instantly filled the air.

"Give it to me," Julian said to the clerk.

The clerk froze, at a loss.

Both customers had overpowering presence.

She didn't dare offend either.

Adrian curled his lips.

"Must you compete over such trivial matters, Mr. Garnache?"

Julian remained unfazed.

"Aren't you doing the same, Mr. Sinclair?"

Anna massaged her temples in frustration.

She was about to reach for it herself.

Mia Lawrence suddenly tugged Julian's arm.

"Julian, my bags are so heavy."

She pouted and shook her shopping bags.

Julian immediately took her things.

Adrian smoothly picked up Anna's bag.

He shot Julian a triumphant look.

Julian couldn't be bothered to argue.

He turned to help Mia organize her items.

Anna wanted to retrieve her belongings.

But Adrian was already striding ahead.

Marcus Hill stared at his retreating back in disbelief.

Who was it that said carrying bags was beneath him earlier?

Now he seemed quite comfortable holding them.

Sophia Roscente poked Marcus.

"Stop daydreaming. Keep up."

She secretly gave her cousin a thumbs up.

His moves today were impressive.

Marcus found himself left behind again.

He sighed helplessly.

These people clearly valued romance over friendship.

Evening had fallen by the time they finished shopping.

Anna checked the time.

It was time for her bar shift.

Mia guiltily held her back.

"My manager suddenly called me back for overtime."

"I can't go to the bar with you."

Anna patted her hand.

"It's fine. I'll just take a cab."

She turned to Julian.

"Julian, could you please give Mia a ride?"

Julian frowned slightly.

"What about you?"

Adrian stepped between them.

"I'll take her."

Before Anna could refuse.

He already ushered her into the passenger seat.

The black Maybach sped away.

Mia watched the taillights disappear, lost in thought.

Adrian clearly still had feelings for her best friend.

Then what was the deal with his fiancée?

Julian opened the car door.

Mia got into the vehicle.

He suddenly spoke while fastening his seatbelt.

"Mia, what exactly is the relationship between Adrian Sinclair and Anna Ross?"
###Chapter 449

Mia Lawrence set down her phone.
She leaned back into her seat, exhausted.

She sighed softly.
"Adrian Sinclair still can't let go of Anna."

That was hardly surprising.
Her best friend was both beautiful and brilliant.
What man could easily forget her?

Julian Garnache started the car in silence.
They drove into the night.

On another road.
Anna Ross sat stiffly.

The air inside the car was stagnant.
She regretted her decision.

She should have insisted on taking a taxi.
Adrian watched the road ahead.

His fingers tapped lightly on the steering wheel.
He spoke abruptly.

"Are you and Julian that close?"
Anna frowned.

She had explained this countless times.
He always held hostility toward the men around her.

She couldn't help retorting.
"He's like a brother to me. What exactly do you want?"

Adrian fell silent for a moment.
The car slowed slightly.

His voice was low.
"I saw you go to him willingly earlier."

Anna turned her face away.
She looked out the window.

The trees were bare.
A cold wind whipped up dead leaves.

New York winters usually brought snow.
She felt a sudden flicker of anticipation.

Her phone vibrated, shattering the silence.
It was a message from Howard Lowell.

He was asking about her whereabouts.
Anna stared at the screen, her fingertips turning cold.

Adrian glimpsed the contact name.
His eyes turned frosty.

Anna put her phone away.
She spoke softly, offering a warning.

"Be careful around anyone named Wang at the company lately."
She paused, then added more.

"I overheard them plotting something."
Saying it aloud lifted a weight off her shoulders.

Adrian's lips curled into a cold smile.
Just as he thought.

He had sensed that person was trouble for a while.
He glanced at her.

"If you're worried about me, why not work with me directly?"

The car gradually slowed.
He tapped the steering wheel lightly.

His gaze was sharp.
"Howard Lowell is insignificant. Helping him is worse than helping me."

A red light illuminated.
The car came to a complete stop.

He turned to her.
His voice was deep and persuasive.

"I can give you far more than he ever could."
Anna clenched her fingers tightly.

Her mother was still under Howard's control.
She had no other choice.

She refused quietly.
"You're clever enough. You don't need my help."

Besides, he had the Valentine family backing him.
Adrian's eyes darkened.

She would rather be used than stand by his side?
The light turned green.

He pressed the accelerator.
The car merged back into the traffic flow.
###Chapter 450

Anna Ross sensed the man beside her suddenly turn cold.

She instinctively pulled her coat tighter.

The car stopped in front of the bar.

Anna murmured her thanks.

She unfastened her seatbelt to get out.

"Wait."

Adrian Sinclair's low voice cut through the silence.

He held out the newly purchased lipstick.

"For you."

The interior was dimly lit.

His eyes were deep and dark as night.

Anna watched quietly.

She shook her head in refusal.

"Keep it for Miss Valentine."

She turned to leave.

The car door suddenly swung open.

Adrian strode to stand before her.

He uncapped the lipstick.

Before Anna could react.

He tilted her chin up.

The lipstick glided softly over her lips.

Anna struggled to pull away.

The color smudged at the corner of her mouth.

"Don't move."

Adrian's gaze darkened.

He brushed his thumb over the smudge.

His touch was gentle and focused.

Anna felt a moment of dizziness.

She seemed to see the boy from before.

But the distance was too close now.

She frantically pushed his hand away.

Her heart raced wildly.

She didn't dare look back.

"You've used this lipstick."

"It can only be yours now."

Adrian's voice held a hint of laughter.

The lipstick was offered to her once more.

Anna silently accepted it.

She walked into the bar without looking back.

Adrian watched her leave.

A slight smile touched his lips.

He looked down at the red stain on his fingertip.

An inexplicable pleasure filled him.

A scream suddenly echoed through the villa.

Chloe Valentine stared furiously at her phone.

She trembled with rage.

Adrian had refused to have dinner with her.

It was to see Anna.

He even went shopping with her.

Personally applied her lipstick.

He never did these things for her.

He wouldn't even touch her.

It was all Anna's fault.

Without her, everything would be different.

Chloe's nails dug deep into the sofa.

She found Lucas Evans's photo.

A cold smile suddenly appeared.

Perhaps this person could be used.

If Anna were ruined.

Would Adrian still like her?

He would only find her disgusting.

Chloe stood up.

She dialed Lucas's number.

Fortunately, she had saved it before.

The call was quickly answered.

"Mr. Evans."

"Are you free to meet?"
###Chapter 451

The line was silent for a moment.

Lucas Evans's voice finally returned.

"Miss Valentine, if you have something to say, say it over the phone."

"There's no need to meet."

Chloe Valentine chuckled softly.

Her fingertips tapped lightly on the desk.

"Don't be so quick to refuse, Mr. Evans."

"What I have to say concerns Anna Ross."

"Are you sure you don't want to hear it?"

Lucas's breath hitched slightly.

A faint static noise came through the receiver.

He tightened his grip on the phone.

"When shall we meet?"

A smile curled at the corner of Chloe's lips.

"Tomorrow."

"I'll text you the location."

The call ended.

Lucas stood before the bathroom mirror.

Water droplets fell from his hair.

The man in the mirror had a dark, unreadable gaze.

Hearing that name still made him lose control.

In the darkness,

he recalled a scene from their university days.

Under the cherry blossom tree,

a young woman walked past, holding a book.

He clutched a love letter in his hand,

only to watch her walk toward someone else.

All these years,

he had always been one step too late.

The next afternoon,

Lucas pushed open the door to the coffee shop.

A wind chime tinkled softly.

Chloe sat by the window,

waving with a smile.

"You're very punctual, Mr. Evans."

She slid a cup of coffee toward him.

"Try it."

Lucas didn't touch it.

"Get straight to the point."

Chloe raised an eyebrow.

"In such a hurry?"

"It seems only Anna Ross can capture your attention."

Seeing him about to leave,

she finally spoke.

"I can help you."

"I can help you get Anna Ross."

Lucas's steps halted.

He sat back down opposite her.

His gaze was sharp.

"What do you mean?"
###Chapter 452

Lucas Evans's heart gave a violent jolt.

He stared at the person before him, the corner of his eye twitching slightly. "Miss Valentine, what do you mean by all this?"

Being with Anna Ross—he had never dared to entertain such a fantasy. At least for now, he couldn't bear to see her upset.

Chloe Valentine had seen right through him.
His tightly clenched hand around the coffee cup betrayed every emotion.

She took a delicate sip of her coffee, a light laugh escaping her. "Mr. Evans, this is no way to pursue a woman. Who would want someone so hesitant and slow?"

"You like Anna Ross, don't you? But you can't just wait for feelings to appear. If your heart is already moved, what's wrong with using some means to make her yours?"

Each word hit Lucas like a stone.
They hammered against his nerves, making them tremble.

"Did you say all this just to give me advice?" He forced composure, looking into the distance, but his Adam's apple bobbed silently.

Chloe's lips curved into a smile. "I simply can't stand watching. You've liked her for so long. Shouldn't there be some resolution?"

She leaned in, her voice dropping. "After all this time, even a stone would have warmed. But her? Completely unmoved. Don't you want to... do something about it?"

"What are you implying!" Lucas shot to his feet, his gaze sharp. "I'm warning you, don't target her. Otherwise, I won't be polite."

He turned to leave.

Chloe stood up as well, calling out to his retreating back. "I'm just like you. I want the person I love. Let's cooperate. I can make your wish come true."

Such a tempting offer. She didn't believe he would remain unmoved.

Lucas's steps only paused for a moment.
He didn't look back. He left directly.

Chloe sat back down, leisurely finishing the rest of her coffee.
Couldn't he understand even this little flexibility?
The process doesn't matter. Only the result counts.
So stubborn.

。。。。。。

Anna Ross had just stepped out of the company when she ran into Sophia Roscente waiting outside the main entrance.

"Sis!" Sophia beamed, linking arms with her. "Mom wants you to come home for dinner tonight!"

Anna checked the time.
She had worked late today. Going for dinner now would make her late for her shift at the bar.

"Sophia, please thank your mom for me, but I still have to get to work," she said apologetically.

Sophia pouted, her eyes darting playfully. "How about this... you come back with me for dinner first. After we eat, we'll drive you over. I promise you won't be late!"

Seeing Anna's hesitation, she shook her arm, pleading. "Sis~ Mom talks about you every day. She said if I don't bring you back today, I'm not allowed home. You wouldn't want me to get scolded, would you?"

"I..." Anna was momentarily speechless.

Just then, a black Maybach pulled up silently by the curb.
The window rolled down, revealing Adrian Sinclair's cold profile. His gaze swept over them.

Anna immediately looked at Sophia.
Sure enough, this girl was behind it again.

Sophia stuck out her tongue playfully.
Mom had given a strict order: both of them had to be brought back.
She didn't dare disobey.

"Sis, get in the car," she said, opening the rear door and blinking. "Let's not keep Mom waiting!"
###Chapter 453

Anna Ross had no other choice.

She followed Sophia Roscente into the car.

The car drove all the way back to the Sinclair Manor.

As soon as they got out of the car, Sophia excitedly grabbed her hand and pulled her inside.

She completely ignored Adrian Sinclair behind them.

"Anna, did you know?"

"Today, my mom cooked everything herself."

"She specifically bought so many dishes you love."

Sophia chattered nonstop.

Her tone was full of excitement.

While they were talking, they had already entered the living room.

Cecilia Roscente had been waiting on the sofa for a long time.

"Anna and Adrian are here."

"Come quickly, let's eat."

Cecilia put down the book in her hands and stood up to greet them.

A gentle smile graced her face.

Anna felt overwhelmingly flattered.

Cecilia's enthusiasm left her at a loss.

At that moment, Sophia spread her arms to hug her mother.

But Cecilia bypassed her completely.

She took Anna's hand instead.

"Anna."

"We didn't get to chat properly at the last birthday party."

"You must stay longer today."

Anna was flustered by this sudden warmth.

She could only manage a strained smile.

"Mom!"

"Why aren't you paying any attention to me?"

Sophia pouted, pretending to be angry.

But a mischievous glint shone in her eyes.

She sneakily glanced at her cousin, who was being ignored.

The corners of her mouth twitched upward.

"Cousin."

"Why do you think Mom likes Anna so much?"

She leaned closer to Adrian and whispered.

Adrian gave her a cool glance.

"Does liking someone need a reason?"

Sophia dramatically covered her mouth.

Her eyes widened in surprise.

Her iceberg of a cousin actually said something like that.

It was truly unbelievable.

On the other side, Cecilia had already led Anna to the dining table.

She kept serving her food and filling her bowl with soup.

The food in her bowl piled up like a small mountain.

Anna quickly picked up her bowl to thank her.
"Aunt Cecilia, this is really enough."
"You should eat too."

She looked at the overflowing bowl with some helplessness.
Cecilia's enthusiasm was simply too much to handle.

Adrian watched the restrained young woman across from him.
The corners of his lips lifted unconsciously.
She was so sharp-tongued when arguing with him.
Now she was as docile as a kitten.

Cecilia happened to look up.
She caught the gentle look in her nephew's eyes.
Her heart swelled with relief.
It had been a long time since he smiled like that.
Not since that breakup and his mother's passing.

"Adrian."
"Take good care of Anna at the company."
Cecilia suddenly got up to fetch drinks.
Leaving behind these meaningful words.

Anna almost choked on her food.
She looked up and directly met Adrian's deep gaze.
That really made her cough.

Cecilia hurriedly handed her a drink.
Gently patting her back.
"Eat slowly."
"No one is rushing you."

Anna took several sips of the drink before she recovered.

"Executive Assistant Ross."
"What were you thinking about so deeply just now?"
Adrian ate his meal unhurriedly.
But his eyes held a teasing glint as they swept over her.

Instantly, all eyes at the table were on her.

Anna was stunned for a moment.
She forced a smile.
"Nothing."
"I just ate too quickly."
###Chapter 454

She ate quietly with her head down.

She picked up a piece of vegetable with her fork and put it in her mouth.

The food was delicious.

But she found it hard to swallow.

When she looked up to get more food, she stole a glance at him.

A smile lingered at the corner of his mouth.

He seemed to be in a good mood these past two days.

After the meal, Sophia invited everyone to relax in the living room.

Anna Ross sat down on the sofa.

She picked up an apple and took a bite.

The crisp sound was especially clear in the quiet living room.

Adrian Sinclair sat across from her.

He took out his phone, seemingly replying to messages.

The screen's light reflected in his deep eyes.

His fingers moved quickly across the screen.

Sophia observed the two of them.

They could have sat together.

Yet they chose to sit opposite each other.

How would their relationship ever progress like this?

She was just about to say something.

Footsteps suddenly sounded at the entrance.

Anna and she turned to look at the same time.

Grandpa and Henry appeared in the living room.

Their eyes met.

The air instantly froze.

Sophia hurried forward to support the old man.

"Grandpa, why didn't you tell us you were coming?"

Grandpa's gaze fell on Anna.

His eyes held obvious displeasure.

There was even a hint of disgust.

Anna nodded slightly in greeting.

She knew the other party didn't like her.

She didn't want to invite trouble.

Grandpa sat down next to Adrian.

He heaved a heavy sigh.

Adrian spoke up first.

"Grandpa, why did you come over?"

Grandpa retorted.

"Can't I come?"

Sophia shrank her shoulders.

She tried to make herself less noticeable.

Grandpa continued his questioning.

"Weren't you supposed to accompany Chloe out?"

"How could you leave her alone?"

"I heard you went shopping instead."

The living room fell dead silent.

Anna recalled the scene at the mall.

A sense of unease rose within her.

Adrian responded calmly.

"I said I don't want to marry her."

"There's no need to cultivate feelings."

Grandpa became agitated instantly.

"Your marriage partner can only be Chloe!"

He started coughing violently.

Henry hurriedly handed him some pills.

Adrian didn't dare refute anymore.

Worry was written all over his face.

Anna felt she was superfluous.

She stood up, preparing to leave.

She walked into the kitchen to say goodbye to Cecilia Roscente.

Cecilia greatly regret.

"There's still so much we haven't had time to talk about."

Anna made an excuse about something coming up suddenly.

Cecilia didn't insist on her staying.

She gently exhort.

"When you're in New York, think of us as family."

"Come visit often."
###Chapter 455

Anna Ross nodded gently.

She replied softly, "Don't worry, Auntie. I will. I'll visit again when I have the chance."

Cecilia Roscente gazed at the gentle, lovely girl before her.

The more she looked, the more fondness grew in her heart.

If possible, she sincerely wished her nephew could spend his life with such a wonderful woman.

Anna had just reached the door.

She found the old man waiting quietly by the entrance, though she didn't know how long he had been there.

"Good day, Chairman," she greeted politely.

She was about to leave.

He raised his hand, blocking her path.

Just as she felt puzzled, the old man spoke in a low voice. "I know you were Adrian's first love."

Anna's heart tightened.

Her hand, hanging at her side, clenched quietly.

Had the old man investigated her, or had someone told him?

Various speculations flashed through her mind.

The old man continued, "I heard you were the one who left him back then."

"He was utterly despondent during that time."

"He was like a walking corpse."

These words were like fine, sharp needles.

They pierced her heart, one after another.

Anna frowned tightly.

She struggled to suppress the surging pain within.

Those past events, she had never forgotten.

Her own pain had never been any less.

"I don't care about the past."

"But now, no matter who Adrian chooses, it absolutely cannot be you."

"I hope you will consciously keep your distance." The old man's words were clear.

His exhaled breath formed white puffs in the cold air, dissipating quickly.

Anna was silent for a moment.

When she looked up again, her eyes held a distant coolness. "Chairman, I work at Lowell Group solely to make a living."

"I have no other inappropriate intentions."

She paused.

Her fingertips dug deeply into her palm.

She added, "Moreover, I sincerely wish Mr. Sinclair and Miss Valentine all the best."

"I hope they have a long and happy life together."

"I have matters to attend to. I must take my leave."

She lowered her head and quickly descended the steps.

The old man watched her retreating figure.

He let out a long sigh.

He could tell she was a good girl.

But this action was necessary.

Adrian absolutely must not be with her.

Not far away, a tall figure stood silently.

Sophia Roscente watched her cousin's lonely silhouette.

A faint ache spread in her chest.

If she had known this would happen, she wouldn't have followed.

Hearing these words must be painful for him.

But why was Grandpa acting this way?

Sophia fell into thought.

Anna hadn't done anything outrageous.

This was the first time she had seen her grandfather treat someone like this.

......

Anna felt exceptionally tired today.

She had returned from the bar late last night.

Her department had suddenly demanded she submit a report.

She had no choice but to stay up late working on it.

She kept checking her phone for the ride-hailing progress.

For some reason, it was particularly hard to get a car today.

Her ride request had been active for nearly twenty minutes with no drivers accepting.

Anna grew anxious.

Finally, a driver accepted the request.

But it was a shared ride.

After a moment's hesitation, she decided having a car was better than being late.

Otherwise, her salary would be docked again.

Soon, a car pulled over slowly.

Without paying much attention, she opened the door and got in.

She recited the last four digits of her phone number.
###Chapter 456

Anna Ross initially noticed nothing unusual.

But the gaze beside her grew increasingly intense.

She finally couldn't help but look up.

She froze instantly.

"Well, if it isn't our Anna."

The man looked her over with a sleazy grin.

His eyes roamed over her body.

A wave of nausea churned in Anna's stomach.

She suppressed her panic.

"We're not acquainted," she stated coldly.

The man before her was Vincent Lombardi.

Her mother's ex-husband.

The man who had buried them under a mountain of debt.

Anna felt fate was cruelly mocking her.

Their airport encounter had been unexpected enough.

She never imagined they'd meet again.

Had she known, she would have chosen any other transport.

Vincent burst into loud laughter.

"You used to call me 'Daddy' so easily."

He deliberately brought up her mother.

"How's that gullible mother of yours doing now?"

Anna immediately went on high alert.

"I'm warning you."

"We have nothing to do with you anymore."

Surprise flickered in Vincent's eyes.

It was quickly replaced by an amused smirk.

"Don't be so sure."

"Maybe your mother misses me."

He spoke slowly, deliberately.

"Since I'm free now."

"I don't mind paying her a visit."

A chill ran down Anna's spine.

Was history about to repeat itself?

"You're despicable!"

She turned sharply to the driver. "Stop the car, please!"

The driver glanced worriedly in the rearview mirror.

"Miss, regulations forbid unscheduled stops."

Anna fumbled with her phone.

"I'll just change my destination then."

"You can't modify it now," the driver reminded her.

"We're almost at the terminal."

Anna had no choice but to give up.

She turned to stare out the window.

Trying to block out his disgusting stare.

Vincent, however, was relentless.

"I saw you at the airport last time."

"You were with some wealthy man."

"Are you married already?"

Anna's heart clenched.

He had seen everything.

"None of your business."

Her voice was icy.

The man pressed further.

"I was your father, after all."

"Shut up!"

Anna snapped sharply.

The vehicle finally came to a stop.

"Miss, we've arrived."

She grabbed her bag, ready to flee.

But a hand suddenly clamped around her wrist.
###Chapter 457

Anna Ross felt intense disgust toward Vincent Lombardi.

His sudden pull made her skin crawl.

"Let go! I'll call the police for harassment!"

The man grinned shamelessly, completely unfazed.

"I suddenly want to see your mother."

A chill ran down Anna's spine. She struggled desperately to break free.

The driver watched through the rearview mirror, confused.

With one hand trapped, she fumbled for the door release with the other.

Escape was her top priority.

Nearby, Noah Watson walked while reporting last month's performance to Adrian Sinclair.

His peripheral vision caught the shaking car. He inwardly sighed.

Some people had no shame these days.

He shook his head. None of his business. Employees should mind their own work.

Adrian was about to pass by when a familiar profile caught his eye.

It looked like her.

Noah pulled out a new folder to speak, but his boss vanished.

He looked up, stunned.

His boss was striding toward that shaking car.

Noah gaped. Since when was his boss into this?

Inside the car, Anna flailed wildly.

Suddenly, the restraining force vanished.

Vincent Lombardi howled in pain, clutching his scalp.

"Who dares pull my hair!?"

"Who are you calling 'old man'?"

Adrian yanked him out of the car and slammed him onto the pavement.

He glared down coldly.

It was that man from back then.

His eyes darkened instantly. The air around him turned icy.

Vincent rubbed his throbbing scalp, squinting to see.

"Oh! I recognize you—Anna's lover!"

He clicked his tongue, looking Adrian up and down. "Well dressed, aren't we?"

Anna rushed out of the car, shouting sharply, "Shut up! We have nothing to do with you!"

The man laughed shamelessly. "Don't be so cold…"

Before he finished, a piercing scream erupted.

Vincent curled on the ground, clutching his stomach, rolling in agony. Cold sweat poured down his face.

Adrian retracted his leg and made a brief phone call.

He then grabbed the stunned Anna and marched toward the company.

Noah jogged over, gasping at the man writhing like a shrimp on the ground.

His boss had struck ruthlessly.

He’d kicked a living person without hesitation.

Another mess for them to clean up.

Anna was dragged forcibly, stumbling to keep up with his pace.

"Let go! Where are you taking me?"

Her foot twisted. Furious, she tried to shake off his grip.

He held on tighter.

Looking up, she saw his tense jawline.

Was he angry?

But why?

The elevator doors closed.

Adrian released her abruptly.

Anna looked down, rubbing her reddened wrist.

The next second, he cupped her face and kissed her fiercely.

"Mmph!" Her eyes widened. She clenched her fists, pounding his chest.
###Chapter 458

Is he insane?

This is the company elevator.

Anyone could walk in at any moment.

Her heart raced in panic.

She desperately tried to push him away.

But the man didn't budge an inch.

Instead, he intensified his biting.

He finally broke through her defenses.

His presence stormed through her senses like a hurricane.

Anna Ross's legs went weak.

She leaned against him helplessly.

Sensing her change, his movements softened.

He savored her sweetness meticulously.

His hands released their grip on her arms.

Instead, they cradled the back of her head.

Anna felt like she was floating on clouds.

She moved with his rhythm.

When a blush spread across her entire body, Adrian Sinclair finally released her.

Her eyes fluttered open dazedly.

They shimmered with deep emotion like autumn waters.

Adrian's gaze darkened.

He cursed under his breath and leaned in to kiss her again.

Ding—

The elevator stopped.

He had to halt his actions.

Anna snapped back to reality instantly.

She frantically pushed the man in front of her away.

What had she just been doing?

She should have rejected him.

Yet she had been easily seduced by that faint hint of tenderness.

Grandpa's words echoed in her ears.

Her eyes turned cold and clear again.

She quickly stepped out of the elevator.

Adrian clenched his jaw.

Memories from three years ago flooded his mind.

That Sugar Daddy had appeared again.

And he was pulling and tugging at her.

Even if nothing was between them.

That man's presence alone was suspicious.

He immediately called Noah Watson.

"Mr. Sinclair, the man got away."

"He probably feared we would catch him."

Noah's voice trembled.

He awaited Adrian's fury.

Adrian straightened his collar.

He stepped out of the elevator.

His gaze turned sharp upon hearing the report.

"Send someone to bring him back."

"I have questions for him."

Noah agreed repeatedly.

This mistake was his failure.

Fortunately, Mr. Sinclair didn't erupt.

This time, he must redeem himself.

Anna sat at her workstation.

Her mind was unsettled.

Her thoughts were filled with the morning's events.

What was she doing?

Before, it was unavoidable.

Now it should be over.

Why did this happen with him again?

And she didn't seem to dislike it.

Anna felt she was sick.

She needed to find time to see a doctor.

She glanced at the calendar.

Then slumped onto the desk helplessly.

She sent a message to Mia Lawrence.

Deciding to ask her to analyze her mental state when possible.

Mia was showing a client a property.

She was swamped with work.

"Mr. Klein, look at this one."

"Great location, convenient transportation."

"I highly recommend this set." She introduced carefully.

But the client was distracted.

His lecherous gaze swept over her chest.

"I want a more intuitive understanding of its advantages."

"What should I do?"

Mia hadn't noticed yet.

She maintained her smile.

"If you purchase this property."

"You'll gradually discover more benefits."
###Chapter 459

The man nodded thoughtfully.

"I see."

"Can you show me the property now?"

Mia Lawrence glanced at her watch.

She had two more scheduled clients today.

Her schedule was completely packed.

She offered an apologetic smile.

"I'm sorry."

"My schedule is fully booked today."

"Mr. Klein, would tomorrow work for you?"

The man's face darkened instantly.

"No!"

"Aren't you here to serve clients?"

"What's wrong with wanting to see a property now?"

He raised his voice sharply.

Everyone in the sales office turned to look.

Mia's cheeks burned.

She lowered her voice to explain.

"I'm not trying to brush you off."

"I genuinely can't accommodate you today."

Those clients booked appointments in advance.

Canceling on them would damage her credibility.

The man became fully enraged.

He shot to his feet.

"Is this your service attitude?"

"Buying or not is just my decision!"

He couldn't understand.

Why would a salesperson refuse him.

Mia felt bewildered.

This person was being completely unreasonable.

She had explained everything clearly.

Yet he insisted on causing trouble.

"Mr. Klein, you misunderstand—"

Her words were cut off rudely.

The man turned and shouted.

"Where's the manager?"

"Get your manager out here!"

"I'm filing a complaint against you today!"

His finger nearly jabbed into Mia's forehead.

His attitude was extremely arrogant.

Mia rolled her eyes inwardly.

This guy wasn't serious about buying.

He was just here to pick a fight.

But she had dealt with plenty of difficult clients.

Smack!

She slammed the contract on the table.

Grabbed the man's wrist and twisted it behind his back.

He immediately grimaced in pain.

"If you want to buy, then buy properly."

"I already said I'll show you tomorrow."

"Why are you making a scene here?"

"You're just looking for trouble!"

She wasn't someone who could be pushed around.

Sweat beaded on the man's forehead from pain.

He hadn't expected this girl to be so strong.

He felt both regret and embarrassment.

The staring eyes made him lose face.

"Are you crazy?!"

"Get the manager here now!"

"What good will calling the manager do?"

Mia was about to continue arguing.

The manager had already heard the commotion and rushed over.

He was startled by the situation.

Quickly stepped forward to separate them.

The manager knew Mia's temper well.

Wiping cold sweat, he tried to smooth things over.

"Miss Lawrence, please say less."

"Go attend to your other tasks."

"Let me handle this."

The man tried to persist.

But the manager skillfully blocked him.

Mia glared at the man.

Snatched the contract and turned to leave.

Dealing with these psychos every day.

She'd develop breast nodules from anger sooner or later.

She ducked into the nearby Starbucks.

Ordered an iced Americano.

Took a long gulp.

Her mood finally settled slightly.

Her phone buzzed with consecutive messages.

Both her best friend and Julian Garnache had sent greetings.

She opened Julian's chat.

He had sent a photo of a newly mixed cocktail.

Inviting her to come taste it when she had time.

Mia stared at the photo absently.

A smile unconsciously curled her lips.

She replied to Julian first.

Then messaged her best friend.

Agreed to meet once she got through this busy period.
###Chapter 460

Anna Ross watched her phone screen go dark.

Her fingers lingered on the cool metal casing for a moment.

She placed the phone in her bag and took a deep breath.

Noah Watson was doing well now.

She should be happy for him.

Those baseless worries and wild thoughts were better left behind.

She picked up her pen again, focusing on the files covering her desk.

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting scattered spots of light across the paper.

Just then, a shadow fell over her desk.

Anna looked up, her eyes widening in surprise.

It was Lucas Evans standing before her.

"Lucas?" She was caught off guard. "What are you doing here?"

A gentle smile touched Lucas's lips as his gaze swept over her cluttered desk.

"I'm here for a meeting. Thought I'd stop by and see you." His voice was soft. "You seem busy?"

Anna instinctively touched her earlobe.

Curious glances from colleagues surrounded them, accompanied by faint whispers.

She offered an uncomfortable smile. "It's alright. Not too busy. Are you here about a project?"

She guessed it might be related to their previous collaboration.

Lucas's eyes lit up with hopeful anticipation.

"If you're not too busy, would you like to grab a coffee?"

Anna intended to refuse, but seeing the plea in his eyes, her resolve softened.

She checked the time. Only a few minutes remained until the end of her shift.

"Alright." She nodded. "Let me just pack up."

Lucas's expression immediately relaxed into a delighted smile.

"Great. I'll get the car and wait for you at the entrance."

He turned and left, his steps light and quick.

Anna watched him go and sighed softly.

If only they could just be simple friends.

She shook her head, dismissing the thought, and began gathering her things.

The end-of-day chime sounded just as she finished.

She had only taken a few steps when she nearly collided with Adrian Sinclair.

"In such a hurry to leave?" He raised an eyebrow, noting her rushed pace.

Anna was momentarily speechless.

It had been much easier since she was no longer directly under his supervision.

The feeling of leaving on time was truly liberating.

She glanced at him, her tone flat. "Of course I'm eager to leave. It's my time now. You can't stop me, can you?"

This workaholic had exploited her enough in the past.

Now that she reported primarily to HR, he had no authority over her.

Adrian took a step forward, a faint, mocking smile playing on his lips.

"Guess again." He said slowly. "You're coming with me somewhere right now."

Anna was too angry to speak.

The departing crowd cast curious glances their way, but no one dared linger under Adrian's usual imposing presence.

She was about to argue when Adrian turned and started walking away.

He glanced back at her, his expression brooking no argument.

"What are you waiting for?"
###Chapter 461

Anna Ross pressed her lips together and quickened her pace to follow.

The car door closed.

Adrian Sinclair started the engine, merging into traffic.

She sat in the passenger seat, looking down to fasten her seatbelt when she suddenly remembered Lucas was still waiting.

The car happened to pass right in front of Lucas.

Their eyes met briefly.

Anna's heart tightened, and she quickly spoke up, "Stop the car!"

She had actually forgotten Lucas was still waiting for her there.

Adrian ignored her, his fingers resting on the steering wheel as he lightly pressed the accelerator instead.

He had also caught a glimpse of that figure.

Anna turned to look back.

Lucas's figure grew increasingly distant, gradually shrinking into a tiny dot.

She took out her phone and typed an apology.

The message sent successfully, but her guilt did not lessen.

"Were you that eager to see him?" The man beside her kept his eyes on the road, his tone unreadable.

Anna remained silent.

Outside the window, the neon lights of the commercial street flashed, and traffic flowed endlessly.

She just hadn't wanted to waste his time.

The car finally stopped in front of a restaurant.

Anna frowned. "You specifically brought me here to eat? There must be plenty of people who'd want to have dinner with you. Why exactly—"

"I'm hungry." He cut her off, closing his car door. "Don't forget, your working hours are determined by me."

Anna swallowed the rest of her words and pushed the door open to get out.

The restaurant was mostly filled with intimate couples.

She followed behind him, taking a deep breath.

This person clearly hated her, yet he insisted on keeping her by his side. It was truly baffling.

After they were seated, he finished ordering and handed the menu to her.

Anna shook her head to decline.

Adrian took the menu back, his gaze steady. "I didn't ask you here today just for a meal. Have you really given no more thought to my last proposal?"

Anna lowered her eyes, staring at the wood grain on the table without responding.

Of course, she could have other choices. But who could guarantee that wouldn't just be another trap?

"No, thank you. Things are fine as they are now." She refused softly.

Adrian tapped his fingers lightly on the table. "Why? I know you're being coerced. If you need—"

"If I what? What exactly do you know?" Anna's emotions suddenly flared, her voice trembling.

She didn't want this kind of life either. She didn't want to live every day under the threat against her mother.

But she had no other choice.

Some things were easy to say, but no one could truly understand her torment.

Adrian's expression faltered slightly, and his gaze toward her became more complex.

Anna came back to her senses, realizing they were still in the restaurant.

"I'm not eating anymore. Enjoy your meal." She stood up and quickly walked away.

The cold wind hit her face, making her shiver all over.

This city was bustling and noisy, yet she only felt an icy chill right through to her bones.
###Chapter 462

Anna Ross picked up her phone.

The screen was blank.

Lucas Evans hadn't replied.

He was angry.

Inside the restaurant.

Adrian Sinclair stared out the window.

Her figure had disappeared.

His fingers tightened.

She hated him this much.

She would rather be threatened.

Than accept him.

But why did she warn him to be careful.

The server brought the food.

Adrian didn't touch it.

He paid and left.

He took out his phone.

"Noah Watson."

"Do something for me."

His voice was icy.

His uncle was getting restless.

It was time to make him sweat.

........

The bar lights were hazy.

Lucas sank into the couch.

Empty bottles covered the table.

His eyes were vacant.

A woman passed by.

Her clothes were revealing.

Seeing him drinking alone.

She curled her lips.

She sat beside him.

Her fingers climbed his shoulder.

She leaned her head against his chest.

Lifting her eyes to him.

"Handsome."

"Drinking alone is so boring."

"Let me keep you company."

Lucas paused.

Staring at her heavily made-up face.

He hallucinated.

He touched her cheek.

"Anna."

"Is that you?"

He couldn't believe it.

She had actually come.

The woman froze.

Lucas suddenly hugged her.

His arms tightened.

She almost suffocated.

"Anna."

"Seeing you leave with him."

"Shattered my heart."

"It hurts so much."

"Why?"

"You promised me first."

His voice was slurred.

Full of alcohol.

The woman struggled.

But thinking of spending the night.

She patted his back.

Purposely softening her tone.

"So I'm here now."

"No more drinking."

"Let me take you home."

Lucas was dazed.

He followed her.

In a blur.

The woman's hands undid his buttons.

He wanted to stop it.

But finally gave up.

........

The next day.

Lucas's head throbbed with pain.

He closed his eyes to ease it.

Then sensed something wrong.

He turned his head.

Saw the woman beside him.

Instantly froze.

His world collapsed.

What had he done.

The woman woke up.

Seeing he was still handsome.

She smiled with satisfaction.

Reached out to pull him.

"Handsome."

"Did you sleep well last night?"

"Get out."

"Don't touch me."

Lucas slapped her hand away.

As if touching garbage.

The woman didn't care.

Sat up to put on her clothes.

Whether he looked or not.

She spoke to herself.

"You weren't like this last night."

Lucas was provoked.

He shouted loudly.

"Shut up!"

"Forget what happened last night!"
###Chapter 463

The woman froze.

She had thought he was gentle and refined, not the type to get angry.

But now, a violent aura radiated from him, as if he wanted to tear her apart.

She swallowed hard, forcing a casual tone. "You seemed to enjoy it last night too. Why act like a blushing virgin now?"

She swayed her hips and walked away.

Lucas Evans scanned the room, disgusted.

His fist slammed into the wall.

Damn it! What had he done!?

Anna Ross...

How could he face the woman he longed for after this?

She would think he was utterly disgusting.

No. Impossible.

He wasn't that kind of man.

Last night must have been a nightmare.

This could still be fixed!

Lucas frantically searched around until he found his phone.

His face twisted as he scrolled through his contacts. He hesitated, then dialed.

"Mr. Evans? Why are you calling me?" Chloe Valentine's voice held surprise.

Lucas gritted his teeth, leaning against the headboard. "Miss Valentine, about that matter we discussed... I agree to cooperate."

Silence filled the line.

His heart sank.

Had she changed her mind?

Chloe's excited voice came through. "Really? That's wonderful!"

Lucas looked down at his disheveled state. He remembered Anna standing beside Adrian Sinclair.

His fingers clenched tightly.

He couldn't go on like this.

He wanted the girl he loved.

What was wrong with that?

"When do we start? The sooner the better. Now, if possible." He was impatient to hold her in his arms.

Chloe sounded puzzled.

Why had he changed his mind so suddenly after refusing so firmly?

But it didn't matter.

As long as he helped her achieve her goal, he was a useful pawn.

"Don't be impatient, Mr. Evans. This requires careful planning. I'll devise a strategy and inform you." Her voice was cheerful.

Finally, she could get rid of that seductress.

Lucas's gaze turned sharp. "Don't make me wait too long."

He had loved Adrian Sinclair for so many years. Now it was his turn.

After getting her promise, he walked into the bathroom.

Hot water poured down. He pushed his wet hair back.

He watched the water flow across the floor as steam filled the room.

No matter what methods he used.

As long as he got her, it wouldn't be a failure.

......

"Achoo!"

Anna Ross rubbed her nose and hugged the hot water bottle tighter.
###Chapter 464

The temperature in New York dropped suddenly.

On her way home from the bar at night.

The cold wind was biting.

When she woke up this morning.

She felt a throbbing headache.

Fortunately, she didn't catch a cold.

Otherwise, she would have to ask for leave again.

"Anna, come here."

Howard Lowell appeared out of nowhere.

He knocked on her desk.

Anna Ross looked up.

Her expression darkened immediately upon seeing him.

Since their last meeting.

He rarely sought her out at the company.

His sudden appearance now.

Could not mean anything good.

She set down the file in her hand.

Followed him to the end of the hallway.

Colleagues were all busy working.

The hallway was empty and unusually quiet.

Howard lit a cigarette.

The smoke made her cough lightly.

He showed no consideration.

Continued blowing smoke rings.

"Anna, have you heard about that matter?"

Anna waved the smoke away.

Frowned and asked, "What matter?"

She had been swamped with trivial matters lately.

Had no time to pay attention to anything else.

Howard's brows furrowed deeply.

He turned to face her.

"My dear nephew."

"Fired Manager Patrick in this morning's meeting."

What?

Anna froze in place.

A look of surprise crossed her face.

She had no idea about this.

"It was a last-minute decision this morning."

"My nephew is really showing his power now."

Howard stubbed out his cigarette.

Spoke through gritted teeth.

The pleading look in Manager Patrick's eyes as he was dragged away.

Was still vivid in his memory.

All his original plans were ruined.

Adrian Sinclair always ruined his schemes.

Though surprised.

Anna felt a secret sense of relief.

She didn't know what Howard was plotting.

But that man's departure was always a good thing.

Howard studied her.

"You've been close to him recently."

"Why didn't you inform me beforehand?"

He asked her to keep an eye on him.

Was this how she did it?

The thought enraged him.

He wanted to take it out on Vivian again.

Hitting that foolish woman.

Always brought him the most satisfaction.

Anna's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

She responded calmly, "I didn't know."

Howard snorted coldly.

"Forget it."

"Keep a close watch on him from now on."

"Where he goes."

"What he does."

"Report everything."

He pressed his hand against the windowsill.

His gaze icy.

Anna was silent for a moment.

Her voice cool and clear.

"I'm rarely by his side these days."

He interrupted immediately.

"I want you to win him over."

"Don't forget I still have the account book."

"I can take it back anytime I'm in a bad mood."

Howard turned and left.

Anna looked out the window.

A light drizzle was falling.

Wetting the glass.

Sometimes she wished she could return to childhood.

Innocent and ignorant.

Not having to face all this with clear eyes.

Chloe Valentine approached carrying a paper bag.

Seeing her lost in thought alone.

She immediately walked over.

"Executive Assistant Ross, waiting for someone?"
###Chapter 465

Anna Ross turned around.

Her gaze fell on the bag in the other woman's hand.

It seemed to contain food.

After just one glance, she looked away.

Her tone was calm.

"I was just taking a walk."

Chloe Valentine's eyes narrowed slightly.

She was half-convinced by the explanation.

But she didn't press further.

She shook the bag in her hand.

"Adrian suddenly said he wanted sushi."

"I went out specially to get it."

Anna's eyelashes fluttered faintly.

But her expression remained neutral.

She offered a faint smile.

She remembered Grandpa Lowell's words.

She really should keep her distance.

She shouldn't disturb other people's lives.

Chloe glanced at her.

A cold laugh echoed in her heart.

"I'm going up now."

"Adrian must be waiting."

She made a playful goodbye gesture.

Her high heels clicked against the floor with a crisp sound.

Anna was silent for a moment.

She turned and returned to her workstation.

How should she handle Howard Lowell's situation?

Chloe paused at the corner.

She watched Anna leave.

Then she carried the bag back the way she came.

After work, she went directly to the Lowell manor.

The most important thing now was to please the old man.

As long as Grandpa insisted, Adrian Sinclair couldn't refuse.

She could slowly implement her plans.

Upon arriving at the door, she noticed the house seemed to have guests.

She took two steps forward.

She gestured to a servant.

"You, come here."

The Lowell servants all knew her.

They understood her importance to the old man.

Their attitude was especially respectful.

A servant hurried over.

She asked in a low voice, "Are there guests today?"

It was usually very quiet at this time.

Besides Grandpa and the servants, there was basically no one else.

The servant glanced inside.

She lowered her voice.

"There was trouble at the company."

"The master is very angry."

"Miss Cecilia is here to talk with him."

Chloe frowned.

Miss Cecilia should be Cecilia Roscente.

They had met at the last birthday banquet.

The other woman had not been friendly toward her.

She thought for a moment.

Then she walked into the living room anyway.

So what if Cecilia didn't like her?

She was destined to be the young mistress of the Lowell family.

Why should she retreat?

Entering the living room, the conversation stopped because of her.

Grandpa frowned.

But when he saw it was her, his expression relaxed.

A kindly smile appeared.

"Chloe, you're here."

"Come, sit down."

He waved her over.

It was like seeing his most beloved granddaughter.

But Cecilia stopped speaking.

She drank her tea expressionlessly.

Chloe responded and sat down.

Seeing the other's coldness, she took the initiative to greet her.

"Auntie."

"Long time no see."

"You look younger than ever."

Grandpa put down his teacup.

He laughed heartily.

"Chloe, you really know how to talk."

"Your aunt must be very happy inside."

Chloe felt secretly pleased.

She was about to speak again.

But Cecilia suddenly spoke.

"Dad."

"She and Adrian aren't married yet."

"Should she really be calling me auntie?"
###Chapter 466

Anna pressed her lips together tightly.

Last night's events were too shameful to speak of.

She got out of the car at the research institute's entrance.

Adrian had to go handle matters at the medical administration building.

They went their separate ways.

Anna hurried upstairs and went straight to the coffee room.

She needed caffeine to clear her foggy mind.

"You look terrible." A gentle male voice came from behind her, filled with concern.

Anna forced a weak smile. "It's nothing. I just didn't sleep well last night."

Noah studied her intently. "Because of him?"

Anna paused for a moment before realizing who he meant.

Family shame should not be aired in public.

It made her feel even more humiliated.

"The live stream last night was mentally draining."

Noah raised an eyebrow. "You do live streams?"

Anna nodded softly. There was no reason to hide it.

"Can I watch?"

"Of course."

She sent him the live stream room number.

"Cultivating one's mind through live streams is a good thing."

Hearing his sincere tone, Anna smiled.

"I hope more young people will pay attention to traditional culture instead of blindly chasing foreign trends."

Noah was filled with respect. He decided he would definitely go support her that evening.

"So that's why you were in such a hurry to get back before. It was for the live stream."

Anna took a sip of coffee. Her spirits lifted slightly, but the exhaustion in her heart remained.

Noah left temporarily.

Before the research meeting began, he returned with a box of herbal tonic.

"The doctor prescribed this. American ginseng won't cause irritation. Drink two vials. Don't stay up late anymore. It damages your energy."

Anna's face brightened. "Professor Watson, you study traditional medicine too?"

Noah's eyes softened, warmed by her smile.

"I know a little. Not nearly as much as you."

Anna let out a light laugh.

Vivian walked in just as they were chatting happily.

A flicker of displeasure crossed her well-maintained face.

She used to think this talented researcher was brilliant.

But now, the more she saw him, the more she disliked him.

The man was everywhere!

Vivian approached with a folder in her arms. "Miss Ross, I'd like to discuss a few research questions with you."

She looked at Noah, hinting for him to give up his seat.

Under everyone's gaze, Noah stood up.

He moved to sit on Anna's left side.

Vivian was speechless.

What a clever solution!

The research progress was slow.

But after two days of rest, someone proposed a new approach.

Through collective brainstorming, the research finally moved forward.

As work was ending, Anna received a message from Grandpa.

[Anna, if you're free, let's meet at the quiet tea house.]
###Chapter 467

Tara Johnson held Leo Wilson's hand tightly.

She looked directly at Yvonne Johnson.

"This matter cannot just be dropped."

"Grace must apologize to Leo."

Yvonne Johnson frowned.

"Grace is barely over a year old."

"She can't even speak properly yet."

"How can she apologize?"

"It's just a notebook."

"Buy Leo a new one."

Leo Wilson wiped his tears.

"You can't buy it..."

"Chestnut General signed it."

Yvonne Johnson looked confused.

"Chestnut General?"

"What is that?"

Tara Johnson cut her off.

"That was Leo's most treasured notebook."

"Now Grace ripped it apart."

"You must make Grace apologize."

"Otherwise, I'm taking Leo and moving out right now."

Yvonne Johnson thought she was overreacting.

"Is it really that serious?"

"Over a notebook?"

Tara Johnson's gaze was firm.

Since arriving in New Zealand.

She never felt Yvonne Johnson's care.

Yvonne Johnson only had eyes for Grace.

And for Ella Warren far away.

She didn't want her son to feel wronged.

Just like she did as a child.

"We never should have come to you."

Tara Johnson pulled Leo Wilson up.

"We're moving out now."

Yvonne Johnson found her unreasonable.

"Over such a small thing."

"You're moving out?"

"Where will you go?"

Tara Johnson gave a cold laugh.

"You always favor Grace."

"Then it's Ella Warren."

"I'm always last in your heart."

Yvonne Johnson stamped her foot in anger.

"Who did you inherit this temper from?"

"I already apologized, isn't that enough?"

Tara Johnson's eyes reddened.

"You just don't understand."

"When you divorced back then."

"Neither of you chose me."

"Now I don't want Leo to feel that way."

Yvonne Johnson sighed helplessly.

She turned to Leo Wilson.

"Grandma apologizes for Grace."

"Is that okay?"

Tara Johnson didn't answer.

She led her son back to their room.

That night.

Yvonne Johnson put Grace to bed early.

Tara Johnson took out some glue.

She carefully pieced the torn signature back together.

Leo Wilson looked up with his small face.

"Grandma doesn't like me."

"She never smiles at me."

Tara Johnson patted his head.

"How could that be?"

"Leo is so adorable."

Leo Wilson's eyes welled up with tears.

"Mom."

"Do you think I'm embarrassing?"

"Is that why you won't let me call you Mom?"

Tara Johnson froze.

She quickly hugged her son.

"Mom has never thought you were embarrassing."

"Mom is afraid of losing you."

Leo Wilson sobbed.

"Really?"

Tara Johnson kissed his forehead.

"You are my most precious treasure."

"Mom will always love you."

She explained softly.

"It's like a magic spell."

"As long as we don't tell anyone you're Mom's son."

"We can be together forever."

Leo Wilson nodded, not fully understanding.

He fell asleep in his mother's warm embrace.

Tara Johnson continued repairing the signature.

She worked until late into the night.

Early the next morning.

Yvonne Johnson made breakfast.

Tara Johnson spoke in a flat tone.

"I'm going grocery shopping."

"Please watch Leo."

Yvonne Johnson frowned.

"Still angry?"

"I'll buy him a new notebook today."

Tara Johnson didn't respond.

Before leaving, she placed the repaired notebook by her son's bedside.

At the supermarket.

Tara Johnson bought many things.

Beef for her son.

Caviar for Yvonne Johnson.

She also bought diapers for Grace.

At checkout, she suddenly spaced out.

Remembering what Li Jingcheng once said.

"If I spend too much on myself."

"There will be less for you."

Now there was no one beside her.

Returning home, she heard Yvonne Johnson scolding Leo Wilson.

"Your accent is terrible."

"Don't corrupt Grace's speech."

Leo Wilson replied softly.

"Grandma, I won't."

Tara Johnson pushed the door open.

Her son ran over怯生生ly.

"Mom."

Tara Johnson looked coldly at Yvonne Johnson.

"What did Leo do now?"

Yvonne Johnson justified herself.

"He can't distinguish between 'n' and 'l' sounds."

"Grace is learning to talk now."

"He can't influence her incorrectly."

Tara Johnson took a deep breath.

She put down the grocery bags.

"I'm taking Leo and moving out now."

"We won't affect your daughter anymore."

She turned and started packing.

Her movements were swift and decisive.

Yvonne Johnson tried to explain.

"I'm doing this for his own good."

"Education must start young."

Tara Johnson interrupted her.

"I am his mother."

"I will handle his education."

"You don't need to interfere."

She pointed at the grocery bags on the floor.

"I bought all your favorite things."

"But you never consider what we like."

Yvonne Johnson defended herself.

"You are both my treasures."

"How could I not love you?"

Tara Johnson zipped up the suitcase.

"I'll continue sending your company dividends as usual."

"Contact me online if needed."

"We won't be staying here anymore."

Her decision was resolute.

This time, she would not look back.
###Chapter 468

Noah Watson nodded in acknowledgment.

He turned to leave.

Adrian Sinclair spoke abruptly. "Send Anna Ross in."

"Understood."

Noah stepped out of the office.

He couldn't resist glancing back.

His boss's expression was terrifyingly dark.

Was he about to make an example of his Executive Assistant?

Noah recalled Adrian's rage.

A chill ran down his spine.

Things looked grim for Anna.

Anna Ross sneezed twice.

Her head felt heavy.

Someone must be talking about her again.

She stared at the leaked contract documents.

Chloe Valentine had only asked her to contact the client.

She hadn't handled anything beyond that.

Where did it all go wrong?

Her phone vibrated.

Noah's name flashed on the screen.

Her heart skipped a beat.

Did the company already know?

Her fingers trembled as she answered. "Anna speaking."

"Mr. Sinclair wants you in his office. Now." The words stole her breath.

It was happening.

"I'll be right there." She ended the call.

She took a deep breath.

Her palms were damp with sweat.

He was summoning her about the breach.

He wouldn't believe her either.

She stood before his office door.

She knocked softly.

"Enter." His low voice filtered through.

She pushed the door open.

Adrian was focused on his files.

He didn't even look up.

Anna clenched the fabric of her clothes. "I didn't do it."

The typing stopped abruptly.

His gaze lifted, cold and piercing. "Come here."

His tone held suppressed anger.

She approached slowly.

Adrian opened a drawer.

He flung a document onto the desk. "Explain this."

She picked up the paper.

Her eyes widened in shock.

All the evidence pointed to her computer.

Chloe had set her up perfectly.

Adrian leaned back in his chair.

His eyes were sharp as blades. "I thought you were capable."

"Apparently, I was wrong."

"It wasn't me!" Her voice broke.

Others could doubt her.

But his accusation cut deepest.

A wave of hurt washed over her.

Worse than anything Chloe had ever caused.

Tears threatened to spill.

Adrian's brow furrowed slightly.

He knew he had been too harsh.

But he didn't know how to take it back.
###Chapter 469

"Anna, what's wrong? Who was that?" Sophia tilted her head, noticing her staring blankly at the phone. She leaned in closer.

Anna Ross swiped her finger across the screen, ending the call. "Just work. I'm tired. Didn't feel like answering."

Sophia pressed her lips together, pulling out her own phone. She opened WeChat, hesitated for a few seconds, then locked the screen again.

Why should she be the one to apologize first? He was the one who ignored her. This time, he needed to learn his lesson.

Both lost in their own thoughts, the phone on the sofa rang again. Anna massaged her temples and answered under Sophia's watchful gaze.

"What is it?" Her tone was cold. He wouldn't bother her after work hours, would he?

The voice on the other end sounded urgent. "Where's Sophia?"

Anna glanced across the room. "At home."

"Got it." The call ended abruptly, leaving her frowning at the phone.

She couldn't be bothered to overthink it. She tossed the phone back onto the sofa.

Sophia lay sprawled on the couch, listless and drained.

Anna sighed. No amount of advice would help a couple's argument. They had to work it out themselves.

"Don't overthink it. Maybe he's searching everywhere for you right now." She didn't know Marcus Hill well, but she could see how much he cared for Sophia.

The doorbell suddenly rang.

Anna glanced at the figure collapsed on the sofa and resigned herself to answering the door.

The moment it opened, Marcus rushed in frantically. "My祖宗! Finally found you!"

Anna stood frozen. Sophia bolted upright and pushed him away irritably. "Who asked you to look for me!? Weren't you on a blind date!?"

Marcus wrapped his arms around her. "I didn't go! I was lying!"

Anna breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed the misunderstanding would be cleared up today.

"Aren't you going to let me in?" A deep voice came from the doorway. Anna flinched, only now noticing Adrian Sinclair standing outside.

She stepped aside. Adrian's eyes swept over her before he entered the room.

Anna gently closed the door.

The two on the sofa were still tangled up. Sophia glared at Marcus, fuming.

"Take your argument outside." Adrian lifted his gaze lazily, his tone dripping with impatience.

Anna quietly sat to the side, deciding to remain silent.

Sophia immediately bristled. "This is my and Anna's home! If anyone should leave, it's you two!"

After her outburst, her courage faltered. She shrunk behind Marcus, muttering under her breath.

Adrian snorted coldly. "You're the one who chose him."

Marcus jumped up. "Adrian! What's that supposed to mean? What terrible thing did I do?"

Adrian glanced at him but said nothing more.
###Chapter 470

Sophia Roscente immediately pouted.

"I didn't say anything."

Marcus Hill held her hand tightly.

Seizing the moment her tears stopped, he hurried to explain.

"Sophia, you blocked me."

"I couldn't call you. You didn't reply to my messages."

"I was really scared."

Sophia looked up at him.

Her lips parted slightly, but no words came out.

"My family did arrange a blind date."

"But I refused."

"I told them I have a girlfriend." Marcus spoke with sincerity.

Sophia's gaze softened.

Her voice was gentle. "Really?"

Marcus chuckled affectionately.

He gently pinched her cheek.

"Of course it's true."

"I'll take you home to meet them when the time is right."

"Ah! No!" Sophia covered her face.

The tips of her ears turned pink with embarrassment.

"Why not?"

"You're the only one I'll ever love."

"And the only one I'll ever marry."

Marcus pulled her into his arms.

Completely ignoring the two other people sitting nearby.

The room's atmosphere grew subtly.

Anna Ross reached for the book she had been reading earlier.

She found it half trapped under Adrian Sinclair.

She quietly withdrew her hand.

Looking up, she met his gaze.

Her face flushed crimson instantly.

She stammered, "Um, I, I wanted that book."

She pointed at the book under him, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

Adrian glanced down.

He pulled the book out and handed it to her.

"Thank you." She took it quickly.

She turned and moved away, not daring to look at him.

"......" Adrian watched her flustered retreat.

The corner of his mouth lifted involuntarily.

Sophia leaned against her boyfriend.

Watching the pair, she suddenly found her own boyfriend less interesting.

Watching her cousin and Anna was far more exciting.

"Anna, I'm hungry." She rubbed her stomach.

She blinked her big eyes at Anna.

Anna felt flustered under her gaze.

She glanced at the man beside Sophia. "Maybe you should go downstairs to eat?"

Sophia immediately pinched Marcus.

Understanding her hint, he spoke through the pain. "Sophia's still upset. Maybe we could eat here?"

Anna sighed and went to check the kitchen.

Fortunately, there were some vegetables and pasta.

They could make do with noodles. She was hungry too.

She took out the ingredients and tied on an apron.

"Need any help?" Adrian leaned against the doorframe.

His tall figure completely blocked the doorway.

Anna didn't want to be alone with him.

Just as she was about to refuse, he walked in and picked up some eggs.

Outside the kitchen, the other two watched him enter, covering their mouths to stifle giggles.

Anna felt the air in the kitchen grow thin.

Her movements became clumsy. She struggled to chop the vegetables.

With a clatter, a tomato rolled away.

She winced and put down the knife. Blood dripped from her finger.

"Why are you so careless?" Adrian put down the bowl.

He took her hand to examine it, his frown deepening.

Anna tried to pull her hand back. "It's, it's nothing. Just a small cut."

He looked at her with blame.

He led her out of the kitchen. "Where are the Band-Aids?"
###Chapter 471

Anna Ross paused.

The Band-Aids at home were all used up.

She had forgotten to buy more.

The two on the sofa looked over.

They asked with concern.

Adrian Sinclair’s gaze swept across the sofa.

His eyes were cold.

It seemed to say: If you hadn’t insisted on eating, she wouldn’t have gotten hurt.

Sophia Roscente shrank back.

She walked over, her face full of apology.

“Anna, you should go buy some medicine.”

“I’ll handle the cooking.”

Marcus Hill nodded.

He picked up an apron and tied it on.

Adrian didn’t speak.

He pulled her outside.

The hallway was quiet.

Their footsteps intermingled.

One set was urgent.

The other was flustered.

Anna’s wrist ached.

She said softly, “It’s really not necessary.”

“Stopping the bleeding is enough.”

It was just a small cut.

No need for special treatment.

The man in front remained silent.

They soon reached the pharmacy.

Adrian bought antiseptic and Band-Aids.

Anna sat on a bench to wait.

She watched him walk toward her against the light.

His features were deep and distinct.

It made her dizzy.

Adrian sat down.

He took out an antiseptic swab.

Reached for her hand.

“Give me your hand.”

Anna glanced at the cut.

The bleeding had stopped.

She hesitated, then extended her hand.

The moment they touched, she wanted to pull back.

But he held her firmly.

He lowered his head to apply the medicine.

Careful and focused.

Anna turned her face away.

Suppressing the strange feeling in her heart.

The Band-Aid was soon applied.

She withdrew her hand.

Her fingertips curled slightly.

A light rain began to fall.

The wind blew.

Raindrops slanted inward.

Bringing a chill.

Adrian noticed her shivering.

He took off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

Warmth enveloped her.

Anna looked up.

He wore only a shirt and vest.

Thin and lean.

She immediately grew uneasy.

He had caught a cold last time.

He couldn’t dress so lightly again.

“I’m not cold.”

“You wear it.”

She handed the jacket back.

Adrian gazed into her worried eyes.

He didn’t take it.

“Last time was from catching a chill earlier.”

“It’s fine this time.”

Anna was surprised.

He had seen right through her.

The jacket remained held in midair.

A young couple passed by.

Seeing them wanted to give the jacket to each other, the girl laughed lightly.

“Miss, your boyfriend is so sweet.”

And so handsome.

The girl stole a few more glances at Adrian.

Her boyfriend instantly grew jealous.

He took off his own jacket and wrapped it around her.

Dragged her away forcefully.

“I’ll deal with you later.”

Playful arguing echoed from the roadside.

Fading into the distance.

Anna didn’t get a chance to explain.

They were already gone.

“Seeing them.”

“Reminds me of us in the past.”

Adrian’s voice was low.

His breath melted into the air.

Anna’s heart tightened.

It felt suspended.

They had been even more affectionate back then.

Others had admired their closeness.
###Chapter 472

Adrian Sinclair's gaze settled on her.

She happened to look down.

Loose strands of hair obscured her profile.

He watched for a moment.

Reaching out, he gently brushed her hair aside.

Anna Ross jolted back as if electrified.

"Sophia and the others should have the noodles ready by now."

"Let's go back and eat."

She had only taken a few steps.

A delighted voice called out from behind.

"Adrian! What are you doing here?"

It was Chloe Valentine's voice.

Sure enough.

The figure rushed straight into Adrian Sinclair's arms.

"Adrian, what a coincidence."

"Could you take me home?"

Adrian frowned slightly.

His gaze shifted toward her.

Anna immediately averted her face.

He would probably take her home.

But that had nothing to do with her.

She was about to leave.

Chloe stopped her.

"Executive Assistant Ross, I didn't expect you to be here too."

"I didn't notice you earlier. My apologies."

Anna took half a step back.

She forced a response.

"It's fine. I just came down to buy something."

She looked down.

Noticing she was still wearing his jacket.

Chloe's eyes turned icy cold.

She had seen it all.

Watched him tenderly apply the Band-Aid for her.

That expression had never been directed at her.

Anna Ross was special.

Adrian approached.

He handed her the medicine bag.

"You should head back first."

"I won't be going up."

Anna took the bag.

The bottle of antiseptic lotion felt unusually heavy.

She was silent for a moment.

Then nodded gently.

"Alright."

"Drive safely."

She didn't look at them again.

Turning, she went straight upstairs.

Adrian glanced at the person beside him.

His tone was flat.

"Let's go. I'll take you home."

Chloe felt deeply uncomfortable.

The time he spent with her was pitifully scarce.

Yet he was willing to spare time for this woman.

But she had to endure it.

As long as she remained patient.

Everything in the Lowell family would eventually be hers.

Including this man.

"Adrian, wait for me!"

She raised an eyebrow disdainfully.

Quickening her pace to catch up.

Anna returned home.

She walked to the window.

His car was already gone.

She had forgotten to return his jacket.

She lowered her eyes.

Taking off the jacket.

"Sis, why are you alone?"

"Where's our cousin?"

Sophia Roscente peeked out curiously.

Anna pressed her lips together.

"He went back."

Marcus Hill emerged from the kitchen carrying bowls of noodles.

He was nearly shocked speechless.

"What!?"

"He actually left me here!"

"I need to have a serious talk with him!"

He pulled out his phone to make a call.

Anna glanced at the noodles.

Her earlier hunger had completely vanished.

"You two eat."

"I'm going to freshen up first."

Sophia noticed her subdued mood.

Wondering what had just happened.

She patted the person beside her.

Taking his phone from him.
###Chapter 473

The call connected.

Sophia Roscente frowned deeply.

She lowered her voice to a sharp whisper.

"Cousin, did you upset Anna? She seems really upset."

Silence filled the other end.

Only the noise of moving vehicles.

A woman's voice faintly mixed in.

Sophia felt a twinge of suspicion.

She glanced toward the bathroom.

Was Anna's low mood because her cousin left with another woman?

Who could that woman be?

She took a bite of noodles.

Her eyes questioned the person beside her.

Getting no response, she pressed further.

"Is someone there with you?"

Before Adrian Sinclair could speak, a familiar female voice answered first.

"Sophia, it's me."

Sophia froze.

Her appetite vanished instantly.

No wonder the voice sounded familiar earlier.

It was her, putting on airs.

Adrian's cold voice cut in.

"End the call."

The line went dead abruptly.

Sophia tossed her phone aside.

She sighed helplessly.

"Their relationship is so complicated. I really think Cousin likes Anna."

Marcus Hill was eating noodles.

He nearly choked hearing this.

Sophia handed him a glass of water.

He took a few sips before recovering.

"I think so too. But he's too stubborn. He never says how he feels. How would the other person know?"

"Did you know Anna is his ex-girlfriend? His first love, actually." Sophia lowered her voice, leaning close to his ear.

She still remembered clearly how heartbroken her cousin looked back then.

She thought he had moved on.

But seeing her again, he's still caught in the same feelings.

Anna Ross is so wonderful.

Even she can't help but like her.

Her cousin falling for her again is completely natural.

"I had a feeling. All these years, besides her, Adrian has never been special to anyone." Marcus finished his noodles, even drinking up the broth.

Sophia rested her chin on her hand.

She genuinely hoped they would reconcile.

Marcus chuckled and shook his head.

"Feelings are something they have to work out themselves."

"You worrying won't help." Sophia thought it over.

She felt he made sense.

But she still wanted to do something.

Anna came out of the bathroom.

Seeing the two still eating, she went straight to the bedroom.

She saw the jacket.

She folded it neatly.

Placed it in a bag.

The next day, she brought it to the company.

Ready to return it to its owner.

Anna went upstairs with the item.

She searched the office but found no one.

Just as she wondered where he was, she ran into Noah Watson.

He was on the phone, walking hurriedly.

His expression was grave, his steps rushed.

Something major seemed to have happened.

Noah noticed Anna.

He ended the call briefly and stopped.

"Executive Assistant Ross, here for Mr. Sinclair?"

Anna looked at the item in her hand.

She asked softly about his whereabouts.

"Is he not in the office?"

Noah's expression was heavy.

He paused before responding.

"There's an emergency at the company. Mr. Sinclair is in an urgent meeting."

"It should be ending soon. You can wait here."
###Chapter 474

Anna Ross’s heart sank.

She had known nothing about this.

“What happened?” she blurted out, her voice laced with an urgency she hadn't meant to reveal.

Noah Watson frowned and sighed. “It's Patrick Murphy, the manager we fired. He's spreading false information online.”

A commotion suddenly erupted from downstairs.

Noah, as if expecting it, quickly said goodbye and slipped into the elevator.

Anna hurried to the window.

A crowd had gathered below, swarming with media reporters.

A middle-aged woman stood among them, holding a sign.

She was too far away to hear, but the woman's agitated gestures were clear as she shouted toward the building.

Her phone rang.

Mia Lawrence’s frantic voice came through. “Anna, have you seen the news? Your company is trending!”

“What news?” Anna asked, already searching on her phone.

A headline about Sinclair Group's scandal flashed on screen.

“Sinclair Group abuses industry dominance, fires employee without cause. Disgraceful behavior.”

Anna couldn't believe her eyes.

It was complete nonsense.

She was about to speak when she noticed Howard Lowell approaching.

Her intuition told her he was behind this.

“Mia, I have to go. I’ll call you back.”

She hung up and walked straight toward Howard.

He was on the phone, a smug smile on his face.

He ended the call when he saw her.

“Did you do this?” Anna pointed at her phone, her voice icy.

Howard glanced at it and smiled with satisfaction. “This has nothing to do with me.”

Anna stared at him, searching for any hint of deception.

Seeing her disbelief, Howard patted her shoulder. “Anna, you're on my side. You should be helping me, not doubting me.”

Anna frowned and shook off his hand. “I was just asking. This affects the entire Sinclair Group. You're part of the company too. Aren't you worried?”

“Why should I be?” Howard clasped his hands behind his back and chuckled. “Adrian Sinclair is the one who will suffer the most. He never should have been involved with the company. It's time for him to get out.”

Anna found his smile repulsive.

Adrian was his own nephew, yet he could say such things.

Then again, he would stop at nothing to achieve his goals.

She had seen his true nature when he harmed her mother.

She should never have expected anything from him.

Seeing her silence, Howard’s smile faded. His tone turned threatening. “You better behave. Remember what you promised.”

Anna said nothing.

Her mother was still in his grasp. She had no choice but to submit.
###Chapter 475

Footsteps interrupted their conversation.

Adrian Sinclair had just finished his meeting.
He looked tired.
Several executives followed behind him.

Everyone stopped when they saw them.
Chloe Valentine lingered at the back.
She gave Anna Ross a friendly smile.

Adrian's gaze swept over them.
It finally settled on Howard Lowell.
Howard felt uncomfortable under his stare.
He forced a smile.

"Just finished your meeting?"
"You must be tired."
He reached out to pat Adrian's shoulder.
Adrian sidestepped to avoid it.

His hand hung in the air.
The atmosphere turned awkward.
Howard withdrew his hand awkwardly.
He shoved it into his pocket.

Adrian loosened his tie.
He gave Howard a cool glance.
"Don't you have anything better to do?"
"Still hanging around here?"

Anna's heart skipped a beat.
His attitude was too direct.
Chloe felt relieved.
She was glad she hadn't spoken earlier.

Howard's expression darkened.
He suppressed his anger and smiled.
"I'm just concerned about you."
"I heard Grandpa knows about it too."

Anna found his words unpleasant.
They sounded caring but were actually sarcastic.
She secretly observed Adrian.
His face remained expressionless.

Howard grew more pleased with himself.
"Don't be too arrogant, young man."
"Who knows what will happen next?"

Adrian smirked coldly.
"You should worry about yourself first."
"The branch company matter isn't over yet."

Howard's pupils contracted slightly.
Adrian took a step closer.
He lowered his voice.
"Are you close with Manager Patrick?"
"Should I continue investigating?"

Howard's face instantly changed.
He forced an ugly smile.
"I was just reminding you."
"Of course, you don't need my advice."

Adrian stopped looking at him.
He turned his gaze to Anna.
"Were you looking for me?"

Anna was slightly startled.
She remembered Lucas's message.
She quickly handed over the clothes.
"Your coat."
"I forgot to return it to you last night."

He looked down at the neatly folded clothes.
His eyes flickered.
He was about to reach for it.
Chloe took it first.

"How polite of you, Executive Assistant Ross."
"Let me handle such small matters."
She held the clothes and smiled.
"There was no need to come all this way yourself."
###Chapter 476

Anna Ross forced a smile. "Alright. I'll head out now."

She looked up and met Adrian Sinclair's gaze directly.

Adrian's fingers twitched slightly, but he did not reach out.

Howard Lowell suddenly spoke. "Anna, aren't you going to say anything to your cousin?"

If she just left like this, wouldn't she be giving these two the chance to be alone?

She clearly wasn't taking his instructions seriously at all!

Anna stopped walking. She turned and saw Chloe Valentine clinging to Adrian's arm, shooting her a provocative look.

She was silent for a moment before speaking softly. "I have work to attend to."

Howard's face darkened. He glared at her with immense disappointment.

He exchanged a brief farewell with Adrian, then quickly caught up to Anna. He grabbed her wrist firmly. "Come with me!"

Adrian watched the figure being dragged away. The veins on the back of his hand bulged. His expression was terrifyingly dark.

Chloe observed his reaction, her heart aching sharply.

Even when she stood right beside him, did his eyes always only follow that woman?

Since the last incident, she had been treading carefully around him. Yet, he still didn't seem to see her.

"Adrian, I can ask my parents for help," she said. She still had leverage. Only she could assist him professionally.

Besides, she had the grandfather's favor. That was her winning ticket!

Adrian didn't even glance at her. "Unnecessary. This matter won't cause any real waves," he stated coldly.

He wanted to see what else that person could possibly try.

Howard pulled Anna into a corner, his face grim. "Is this how you always act around him?"

Anna turned her face away, unwilling to answer.

"It seems I've been too lenient with you. You're completely disregarding my words!" Howard snapped harshly.

Anna stopped walking, her nose stinging. "What thing you told me to do have I not done?"

If it weren't for him, she wouldn't have to witness all this. She could have stayed far away from that person, away from all these troubles. Instead, she had to watch him with someone else.

Howard snorted coldly. "It's not enough! I told you to sabotage their relationship. But from the looks of it, they're doing just fine!"

He moved closer to Anna, speaking through gritted teeth. "Will you only be satisfied once their wedding announcement comes out!?"

Anna bit her lower lip, remaining silent. Had she not done enough?

Howard glanced downstairs, his voice turning vicious. "Keep a close eye on them. Don't allow them any time alone. He must not gain the Valentine family's backing!"

Otherwise, all his plans would be ruined!

He didn't just want Adrian out of the Lowell Corporation. He wanted him to lose everything!
###Chapter 477

Anna Ross responded softly.

She turned her head away, avoiding his gaze.

Howard Lowell studied her suspiciously for a moment.

He rubbed his hands together and left.

She stood there for a while longer.

Then she decided to return to her office.

As she walked, she calculated her savings.

Was it enough to pay off the debt?

Could it support her after she left?

It was still far from enough.

She would have to work desperately hard.

If she could get more night shifts at the bar, her income would increase.

She would talk to the bar owner about overtime later.

Lost in thought, she kept her eyes down.

She didn't notice the figure leaning against the elevator, clearly waiting for her.

She looked up and met Adrian Sinclair's intense gaze.

Her breath caught.

She instinctively tried to go around him.

He spoke first. "Did he threaten you again?"

Her heart skipped a beat.

Her fingernails dug into her palms.

She kept her back to him, spine rigid.

Her voice was very quiet. "No. You're overthinking it."

"Really?" Adrian stepped closer.

He studied her lowered profile, his voice deepening. "Are you willing to be controlled by him for life?"

Anna was silent for a moment.

Her tone grew even flatter. "It's nothing like that. Please stay out of it."

Her distance was like that toward a stranger.

Adrian felt a sting in his chest.

He turned and blocked her path. "I can help you break free from him completely."

"You never have to suffer like this again."

He had said this much. Surely she would relent now.

Anna looked up and met his eyes directly. "There is no control or suffering."

"I can handle my own affairs. You don't need to trouble yourself."

The person targeting her was really after him.

He should worry about his own safety.

She wasn't worth his effort.

She didn't want to become his burden.

"You are..." Adrian suppressed his frustration, his voice cold. "Ridiculously stubborn."

If she just nodded, everything could be resolved.

But she refused.

Anna pressed her lips together. "Yes. I am that stubborn."

"Please stop interfering in my matters. I won't cooperate with you."

She was about to turn away.

Suddenly, noise erupted from downstairs.

A crowd was clamoring to see Adrian Sinclair, demanding answers.

Anna glanced back at him.

His expression had darkened.

His eyes swept over her face before he strode into the elevator.

She hesitated for a second.

Then she quickly followed him into the elevator.

The downstairs was chaotic and crowded.

The moment Adrian appeared, the crowd surged forward.

A reporter shoved a microphone almost into his face. "Mr. Sinclair, were these layoffs compliant?"

"Is Lowell Group under suspicion of terminating employees' contracts without good reason? Please respond directly!"
###Chapter 478

The crowd surged forward like a frenzied tide.

Everyone pushed to get to the front.

Anna Ross was nearly trampled.

She stumbled backward.

A hand swiftly caught her wrist.

Adrian Sinclair steadied her.

Her heart pounded violently.

The air buzzed with chaotic shouts and camera shutters.

She withdrew her hand and murmured her thanks.

Their eyes met briefly.

As Anna turned, she noticed a woman.

The woman was twisting the cap off a water bottle.

Her eyes burned with hostility.

Anna immediately grew alert.

The woman suddenly charged forward.

Her gaze fixed intently on Adrian.

She raised the bottle high.

Swinging it toward his face.

Anna rushed forward without hesitation.

A sharp slap echoed.

The bottle hit the ground.

Cold water drenched Anna completely.

Everyone froze.

The woman who threw the bottle stood rigid.

A cold wind blew.

Anna shivered violently.

She pushed back her soaked hair.

A coat was draped over her shoulders.

She looked up into Adrian's eyes.

Surprise and concern filled his gaze.

Reporters snapped photos frantically.

"Adrian Sinclair, how dare you fire long-term employees!"

A shrill female voice pierced the air.

Anna recognized the troublemaker.

The family member of Patrick Murphy.

The crowd stirred restlessly.

Anna glanced at Adrian.

Anger ignited in his eyes.

He turned to face the crowd.

A cold smile curled his lips.

"You want an explanation? I'll give you one."

Noah Watson promptly handed him a file.

Adrian held the documents up for all to see.

"This is the explanation you demanded."

Noah passed the file to the woman.

Everyone held their breath.

The woman's expression shifted from rage to shock.

Others sensed the change.

Their faces paled.

"Impossible! This must be fake!"

The woman threw the file to the ground.

Reporters crowded around to examine it.

Gasps of astonishment rippled through them.

Adrian spoke slowly, his voice icy.

"These are Patrick Murphy's 'accomplishments.'"

"I intended only to dismiss him."

"But you insisted on pushing further."

He glared coldly at the woman.

"You shouldn't have thrown that bottle."

"Especially not at the wrong person."

The woman's face turned ashen.

Regret flooded her eyes.
###Chapter 479

Adrian Sinclair raised his hand in signal.

Noah Watson quickly stepped forward.

"Mr. Sinclair, your instructions."

"Call the police."

"Continue until I am satisfied."

Adrian shot a cold glance at the troublemaker.

The air around him dropped sharply.

A chilling cold pierced through.

Noah scanned the woman.

He shook his head inwardly.

Of all the things to do.

She chose to seek her own destruction.

She truly reaped what she sowed.

"No! That's not what happened!"

The woman finally panicked.

She still wanted to argue.

But he gave her no more chances.

Anna Ross hadn't regained her senses.

When he pulled her by the hand.

The wind whistled past her ears.

All she heard was their hurried footsteps.

Along the way.

Adrian made a call.

He asked Noah to bring a change of clothes.

She looked down at herself.

It wasn't too bad.

A quick wipe would suffice.

"No need for new clothes."

"I can handle it when I get back."

The winter wind was biting outside.

But it was relatively warm indoors.

Adrian ignored her words.

He pulled her straight toward his office.

Not far away.

Chloe Valentine rushed over.

She saw their clasped hands.

And froze instantly on the spot.

"Adrian!"

"Where are you going!?"

The distance wasn't great.

But Adrian acted as if he hadn't heard.

He didn't look back.

He continued pulling her forward.

Anna wanted to remind him.

But he swiftly guided her into the elevator.

The elevator doors closed.

Sealing them inside.

In the confined space.

Only their mingled breaths remained.

After a long silence.

He spoke in a low voice.

"Why did you step in front of me earlier?"

"She was aiming for me."

Anna looked into the mirror.

She saw her own disheveled reflection.

She bit her lip.

Her voice was light.

"No particular reason."

"I just didn't want to see that kind of scene."

She didn't know why either.

It was just instinct not to let him be publicly humiliated.

Adrian studied her for a moment.

He suddenly remembered the past.

She had also protected him without regard for herself back then.

She couldn't bear to see him suffer the slightest grievance.

In those days, she often said.

He was the most important person.

Besides her mother.

He had been deeply moved then.

He secretly vowed to treat her well for a lifetime.

And never let her down.

Adrian's eyes darkened slightly.

He concealed his thoughts.

He said softly.

"Don't do that again next time."

Anna looked up at him.

She didn't respond.

They reached the office.

Adrian fetched a towel.

He was about to help her dry her hair.

But she turned away to avoid him.

He examined her face.

His hand hung in midair.

Anna blinked.

Her tone was calm.

"I can do it myself."

"No need to trouble you."

She must have been insane.

To let him do such a thing.

Adrian paused.

He actually withdrew his hand.

He handed her the towel.

"Can you see well enough on your own?"

Anna was somewhat surprised.

She took the towel.

"I can manage."

"Thank you."

She walked to the window.

She undid her hair.

And gently dried it with the towel.

Adrian sat on the sofa.

He quietly watched her back.

He watched for a long time.
###Chapter 480

She had shielded him earlier.
He hadn't expected that.

Anna Ross dried her hair with a towel.
The water stopped dripping.
She handed the towel back to him.
"I should go now."

The wet clothes clung uncomfortably to her skin.
She didn't want to stay any longer.
Being alone with him made her uneasy.

"Wait." He started to speak.
The office door was knocked.
Both looked toward the entrance.
Adrian Sinclair glanced at her.
"Come in."

Noah Watson entered with a paper bag.
"Miss Ross, here are fresh clothes."
"It's cold. Change so you don't catch a chill."

Anna remembered the phone call now.
Adrian had asked Noah to buy clothes.
She hesitated, not taking the bag.

"Change here."
"We'll step out."
Adrian said calmly.
He motioned for Noah to leave with him.

Anna picked up the clothes from the sofa.
A white knit sweater.
A camel-colored coat.
They were thoughtfully coordinated.

Footsteps faded outside the door.
She moved behind the bookshelf.
Quickly changed out of the wet clothes.
The new outfit fit surprisingly well.
Noah had a good eye.

She packed the wet clothes into the bag.
Planning to take them home to wash.
Just as she reached for the door.
It was pushed open from outside.

It wasn't Adrian who entered.
It was Chloe Valentine and Grandpa Frederick.
Adrian followed behind them.

Anna wanted to greet them.
The old man spoke first.
"Miss Ross, I've made myself clear."
"You should understand."

Anna's heart tightened.
"Chairman, I was just leaving."

She walked toward the door.
Adrian grabbed her hand.
"Why are you leaving?"
"What did Grandpa say to you?"

"Let me go." She struggled.
His grip was firm.

Chloe watched them.
Her eyes nearly spat fire.
She stepped forward and pulled Adrian away.
"Adrian, Miss Ross has things to do."
"Grandpa needs to speak with you."

Anna freed her hand.
Left without looking back.

Here, she felt like an outsider.
Out of place.
The old man's words echoed in her ears.

Adrian stared at the direction she left.
Veins bulged on the back of his hand.
"Grandpa, what did you say to her?"

He couldn't stay calm.
The thought of her being wronged.
Made his heart churn.

The old man sat down.
"Adrian, I only want what's best for you."
"I hope you understand."

"She hasn't done anything wrong." His voice was icy.

Grandpa Frederick looked at him in disbelief.
Though his face showed no emotion.
He knew his grandson was angry.
This was the first time he had spoken to him like this over a woman.
###Chapter 481

Anna Ross felt a sudden tightness in her chest.

Why would Grandpa suddenly appear at the company?

This was too much of a coincidence.

She gave a slight nod.

"Where are they?"

Her voice sounded a bit dry.

Noah Watson pointed upstairs.

"The conference room."

He lowered his voice.

"What's going on with you today?"

"Leaving your post during work hours is a serious offense."

He remembered reminding her many times before.

Anna pressed her lips together.

"It was an emergency."

"I didn't have time to request leave."

"I'll accept any punishment."

Noah hesitated.

This time, a simple punishment might not be enough.

He silently led her to the conference room door.

He remained outside to wait.

Anna pushed the door open.

Grandpa sat at the head of the table with a dark expression.

Chloe Valentine stood beside him.

A look of triumph was evident in her eyes.

"Anna Ross?"

Grandpa's gaze swept over her.

His tone was icy.

Anna gave a slight nod.

It seemed Chloe had brought Grandpa here.

Grandpa tapped his cane heavily.

"Company policy states no unauthorized absences during work hours."

"You're a smart girl."

"You should know the consequences."

He sighed.

Thinking of his disappointing son.

For his grandson to come to his senses.

This girl had to go.

Chloe spoke softly.

"Grandpa."

"Executive Assistant Ross is usually very diligent."

"Adrian values her highly."

"Perhaps we can be lenient?"

She shot Anna a look.

Her eyes were full of schadenfreude.

Grandpa became even angrier.

"Rules are rules!"

"No exceptions!"

"Go pack your things now."

Anna kept her head down.

But she could feel two pairs of hostile eyes on her.

Chloe approached with feigned concern.

She tried to take Anna's hand.

"Executive Assistant Ross."

"I really want to help you."

"But..."

Anna avoided her touch.

"No need for your concern, Miss Valentine."

Grandpa watched this exchange.

His frown deepened.

This girl was utterly ungrateful.

The conference room door suddenly swung open.

Howard Lowell entered with trepidation.

Under his father's furious gaze.

He moved to stand beside Anna.

"Dad."

"What did Anna do wrong?"

He spoke while giving Anna a meaningful look.

Chloe felt a pang of anxiety.

What if Grandpa softened?

She needed to do something more.

Grandpa snorted coldly.

"Ask her yourself."

"Then take her out of the company."

Howard's heart sank.

His father's attitude was unusually firm this time.

Chloe breathed an inward sigh of relief.

It seemed no further action was needed.
###Chapter 482

The days grew shorter as dusk fell earlier.

She never felt there were enough hours in the day.

She had to get to the bar quickly after work.

She gathered her things swiftly, preparing to leave the office.

Just outside the main entrance, she ran into Lucas Evans heading straight toward her.

"Anna, finished for the day?"

"Lucas?" She paused briefly, her gaze instinctively shifting away.

She thought he wouldn't come after their last conversation.

What was he doing here today?

Lucas noticed her avoidance and scratched his head awkwardly. "I came specifically to give you something."

Confusion flickered in Anna Ross's eyes.

She didn't recall asking him to bring anything.

He turned and retrieved a book from his car.

"That signed copy by Rowling you wanted back in the day. I brought it back specially from my trip abroad."

The book was exquisitely packaged.

Anna's expression grew distant for a moment.

That was from their university days.

She had been obsessed with the author's simple yet powerful prose back then.

Those sentences always brought hope and comfort.

But now, she didn't reach out to take it.

"Lucas, thank you for the thought."

"But I don't care for that anymore."

"You should give it to someone more suitable."

She was no longer the girl who could be easily healed by words.

After everything she'd been through, only cold, hard cash could bring her peace.

Lucas's hand hung suspended in the air.

The wind rustled the pages, as if something fragile had quietly shattered.

He was silent for a moment before slowly withdrawing his hand, forcing a smile. "I'll keep it for myself, then."

"Actually, I quite like it too."

Despite his efforts to hide it, a slight tremor in his voice betrayed his true feelings.

Anna didn't linger. She turned and hailed a taxi.

Through the rearview mirror, she saw Lucas still standing rigidly in place.

Like a lonely, barren tree in the cold wind.

She averted her eyes, looking out at the flowing cityscape beyond the window.

Not far away, Adrian Sinclair watched the entire scene unfold.

The gloom on his face instantly vanished.

Noah Watson stared in surprise at his boss's sudden change in demeanor.

One moment he was icy cold, the next he seemed bathed in spring warmth.

He couldn't fathom what caused such an instant transformation.

Adrian pulled the car door open and settled into the back seat.

He tapped the window lightly with his finger. Noah immediately stepped forward, awaiting instructions.

"I'm rather tired today. You drive."

He leaned back against the seat and closed his eyes.

Noah quickly took the driver's seat.

He started the engine but then hesitated.

The man in the back had his eyes closed. Noah didn't dare disturb him.

But how could he drive without knowing the destination?

As he wrestled with this, Adrian suddenly opened his eyes.

Their gazes met. Noah hurriedly looked away.

"Mr. Sinclair, where are we heading now?"

Adrian frowned slightly. "What's on the schedule for today?"

Noah quickly checked his phone. "The main appointments for today are concluded."

"But the client you scheduled to meet yesterday is still waiting."

Adrian was silent for a moment.

His fingers tapped rhythmically against the seat.

"See the client first."

"Then proceed directly to the bar."

Noah acknowledged respectfully.

But inwardly, he wondered—

What business did they have at a bar?
###Chapter 483

He cautiously glanced at the rearview mirror.

The boss was resting with his eyes closed.

He didn't dare ask any more questions.

The night was deep.

Pedestrians hurried along.

The cold wind cut to the bone.

People pulled their collars tight.

Wishing they could hide entirely inside their coats.

But inside the bar, it was lively and warm.

The music was deafening.

Figures swayed on the dance floor.

The cold air was shut out completely.

Mia Lawrence sat alone in a corner.

Her gaze fixed on the stage.

Her best friend was singing on stage.

Light enveloped her.

Everyone only saw her radiant glow.

Only Mia knew the weight she carried.

Last time she was drunk.

Anna Ross revealed too many worries.

Those long-suppressed secrets.

Made Mia's heart ache.

She hated being powerless to share the burden.

All these years.

Anna had carried everything alone.

Thinking of this.

Mia's eyes grew warm.

She tilted her head back and downed a strong drink.

Her throat burned with a fiery pain.

She smiled bitterly.

Bad moods and alcohol really don't mix.

"Drinking alone?"

Julian Garnache offered her a tissue.

He sat down beside her.

Mia hurriedly wiped the corner of her mouth.

She straightened her disheveled hair and collar.

She didn't want him to see her in such a state.

"Julian, you got here so fast?"

On the phone, he said he'd be delayed.

Julian looked toward the stage.

The corner of his mouth lifted.

"I wanted to see you both sooner."

"Is that not allowed?"

Mia froze.

She stared at him blankly.

Wondering if she'd heard wrong.

Did he just say he wanted to see her?

Julian felt uncomfortable under her gaze.

He touched his cheek.

"Is there something on my face?"

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"N-no! Nothing!"

Mia flustered and turned her face away.

She wanted to drink to hide her embarrassment.

But she raised an empty glass.

Julian chuckled softly.

He signaled a server.

He got her a fruit cocktail.

"Try this."

"Lower alcohol."

"You have work tomorrow."

Mia took the glass.

She took a small sip.

Her eyes immediately lit up.

"Delicious!"

She took two more sips.

Completely in love with the flavor.

Julian also picked up his glass.

His gaze turned to the stage.

"Anna's shift is almost over, right?"

Today he had no mind to run his bar.

He left the work to his staff.

He rushed over here.

"Yeah."

Mia looked toward the stage.

Dance floor lights swept over her friend's profile.

"Waiting for her to finish."

"Taking her for some good food."

"Been too busy lately."

"Haven't had time to spend with her."

Julian was silent for a moment.

Finally, he asked the question on his mind.

"Isn't Anna working at Lowell Corp?"

"Why does she still work at the bar?"

Lowell Corp pays well.

It's what many people dream of.

She shouldn't need the money.

Mia lowered her head.

Remembering her friend's complicated, tangled life.

She sighed silently.

On the other side of the bar.

Noah Watson followed his boss step by step.

Watching the reveling young people around them.

He quietly inhaled.

Youth is wonderful.

They can indulge freely.
###Chapter 484

Adrian Sinclair's gaze cut through the noisy crowd, landing directly on the center of the stage.

Under the stage lights, Anna Ross was intently playing the piano.

Noah Watson whispered a reminder. "Mr. Sinclair, this way, please."

Adrian seemed not to hear, his vision locked on the stage.

Noah followed his gaze, his eyes widening instantly.

"Why is Executive Assistant Ross here?"

He immediately understood the boss's purpose for this trip.

Adrian finally withdrew his gaze and sat down in a corner booth.

He had just picked up the drink menu when the conversation from the next table drifted into his ears.

Mia Lawrence drunkenly raised her glass. "Julian, if Anna weren't in debt, she would never work herself this hard!"

Julian Garnache looked grave. "Has she always been like this?"

Mia shook her head. "She was so happy in college. Everything changed after she broke up with Adrian Sinclair."

Julian pressed further. "Why did they break up?"

Noah choked hearing his boss's name.

"Sir, they're talking about you."

Adrian showed no reaction. He seemed frozen solid.

His expression was terrifyingly dark.

Noah didn't dare say another word.

The next table fell silent.

After a long pause, Mia gave a light laugh. "Her? She's just a fool. Misunderstood for so many years and never once explained."

Julian waited quietly for her to continue.

A faint cracking sound came from the glass in Adrian's hand.
###Chapter 485

Mia Lawrence pressed a hand to her heavy forehead.

A stern face swam into her blurred vision.

She jolted awake.

"What are you doing here!?"

Adrian Sinclair shook off Noah Watson's restraining hand.

He clamped his fingers around Mia's wrist.

His voice was low and dark. "Tell me."

"Why did she break up with me back then?"

Julian Garnache stumbled from the force of being shoved aside.

He looked toward Noah.

Noah gave a bitter smile and shook his head.

There was no stopping the CEO's sudden outburst.

Julian moved to intervene.

But Mia raised a hand to stop him.

"Julian, don't."

"I've wanted to say this for a long time."

Julian frowned and sat back down.

His hands clenched secretly.

If Adrian dared to get violent, he would step in immediately.

Noah stood by nervously.

The CEO's gaze was terrifying.

It was like he wanted to tear his prey apart.

Mia pushed her glass away.

She patted the empty space on the couch.

"Care to sit, Mr. Sinclair?"

Adrian turned his face away.

His eyes fixed on the stage.

"No."

The singing flowed melodiously.

But to him, it sounded harsh.

The truth was right before him.

Yet his heart tightened instead.

Mia let out a scornful laugh.

"Fine."

"Stand there and listen."

"Hear how wrong you were."

She took a deep breath.

Anna Ross had made her promise to keep it secret.

But she couldn't hold back any longer.

Mia grabbed the bottle and took a swig.

The alcohol burned her throat.

Courage surged through her.

"Anna broke up with you."

"To protect you!"

Adrian gripped her shoulders tightly.

"What did you say?"

Mia gasped in pain.

Julian started to rise.

But Noah pulled him back, shaking his head.

Mia stared straight at Adrian.

"You had no idea."

"Her mother was tricked into debt back then."

"That man found out you had money."

"He wanted to use her to threaten you into paying."

Adrian's fingers trembled.

He released her.

Mia rubbed her sore shoulders.

Her voice choked. "So she had to break up."

"She took her mother and hid far away."

"All because she was afraid of dragging you down."

All these years, Anna had rejected every suitor.

It wasn't that she didn't want to love.

Her heart simply had no room for anyone else.

Adrian took half a step back.

His heart felt like it had been struck.

So he had hated the wrong person.

And he had hurt her so deeply.

He lifted his gaze toward the stage.

Anna was slowly descending.

The light outlined her pure profile.

So beautiful.

Yet he had destroyed her love with his own hands.
###Chapter 486

His eyes churned with bottomless guilt.

A bloody hue slowly encroached the whites of his eyes.

The moment Anna Ross turned her head, he spun around and bolted through the crowd.

The bar was packed with people.

He bumped into several drunkards in the shoving crowd, drawing a chorus of curses.

He seemed not to hear, focused only on rushing outside.

Anna followed the commotion with her gaze.

She only caught a glimpse of a figure fleeing in panic.

It felt strangely familiar.

It reminded her intensely of someone she knew.

She frowned, thinking.

But she couldn't recall who it was.

She was about to go find Mia Lawrence when someone suddenly collided with her head-on.

A dull pain throbbed at her temple.

Clutching her head, she apologized repeatedly. "I'm so sorry!"

Noah Watson rubbed his sore shoulder, ready to snap.

He looked down and froze. "Executive Assistant Ross?"

"Noah?" Anna was equally surprised. "What are you doing here?"

Noah had no time to explain.

He looked anxiously toward the door. "I'll explain later. I have to find Mr. Sinclair!"

He hurried out after him.

Anna rubbed her forehead.

She walked quickly toward the booth.

Mia sat there with her head down, her expression unusually somber.

Anna looked at Julian Garnache.

He just shook his head helplessly.

She asked softly, "Mia, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"

Mia suddenly hugged her.

Her voice was choked with tears. "Anna, I might have done something that will make you angry."

Anna gave a weak laugh. "I could never be angry with you, no matter what you do."

Mia bit her lip. "I just... told Adrian Sinclair the truth about your breakup."

Anna's face instantly lost all color.

She steadied herself against the table. "What did you say?"

"I could tell you still like him," Mia said urgently, grasping her hands. "Since you both still have feelings for each other, why not clear up the misunderstanding?"

Anna stared blankly ahead.

Her voice was so faint it was almost inaudible. "No... why did you tell him..."
###Chapter 487

She had chosen silence for so long, just to protect her mother's final dignity.

She never wanted anyone to see the scars of her past.

But now, everything was spiraling out of control.

Mia Lawrence couldn't understand her stubbornness.

She shook Anna's arm forcefully.

"Anna, wake up! Why are we torturing ourselves like this?"

"Is being misunderstood really that enjoyable?"

"Anna," Julian Garnache intervened, seeing both women were emotional.

He pulled Mia away gently.

"Calm down first."

Mia looked at her best friend, tears silently streaming down her face.

"Anna, I just want you to be happy."

"I hope you can always be joyful."

Anna Ross didn't respond.

She turned and walked away expressionlessly.

"Anna!" Mia tried to chase after her.

A sharp pain suddenly pierced her chest.

She had to stop, fine beads of cold sweat forming on her forehead.

Julian was caught in a dilemma.

His usually composed face showed rare panic.

He held her tightly.

"Mia, are you okay?"

Mia lifted her pale face.

"Julian, don't worry about me."

"Go after Anna."

Julian hesitated for a moment.

But he didn't let go of her.

"I'll take you to the hospital first."

Mia was slightly stunned.

Every time they met, she could feel he came for her besties.

But now, he was willing to stay for her?

Julian gave a faint smile.

He supported her as they walked out.

Outside the bar.

Noah Watson watched Adrian Sinclair's unprecedented expression.

His heart was in his throat.

"Mr. Sinclair, let's go back and talk."

The outdoor wind was bitterly cold.

Standing in the wind was not wise.

He rubbed his icy hands, inwardly shocked.

No wonder these two always had a subtly气场 at the company.

Turns out they were exes.

Knowing such a secret, would he be fired directly?

Adrian leaned against the railing.

His hair was tousled by the wind, but he remained motionless.

Like a statue carved from stone.

After a long time, he spoke faintly.

"Assistant Watson, you go back first."

He lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.

But it felt tasteless.

Noah was torn.

"Mr. Sinclair, it's late, you here..."

"I'm fine. Take a taxi back." Adrian interrupted before he could finish.

Adrian handed him the fare, then turned and drove away.

Noah stared at the cash in his hand and sighed helplessly.

Love is a difficult pass to cross.

The ancients truly did not deceive.

But the company would probably be shrouded in low pressure next.

He had to mentally prepare himself in advance!

......

"Sis, you're back!"

Sophia Roscente was immersed in a hand-woven rose.

Seeing Anna enter, she hurriedly hid what she was holding.

Anna glanced at her listlessly.

"Sophia, I'm going to rest."

Without waiting for a response, the door closed.

Sophia looked at the closed door.

She took out the hidden weaving materials again.

For some reason, she felt Anna had been unusually down these past two days.

Maybe it's that time of the month?

She would definitely be happy once she finished weaving this rose for her!
###Chapter 488

Sophia Roscente hummed a cheerful tune.

Anna Ross listened to the singing drifting from outside her door.

She slowly sat down on the edge of her bed.

She picked up the photo frame on her nightstand.

It was a picture of her and her mother.

Her fingertips gently traced her mother's cold cheek in the photograph.

"Mom."

Tears slid silently down her face.

During the days her mother was deceived, the neighbors whispered behind their backs.

They said she deserved it for not knowing her place, for chasing after a man.

Those harsh words pierced her heart like needles.

She could only cover her ears and pretend not to hear.

Now, she finally had some peace.

But with the past resurfacing, how long could this tranquility last?

The debt, the misunderstandings—she could bear them alone.

But now, the person she least wanted to know the truth would eventually see their past disgrace.

She cried for a long time.

Her phone suddenly rang.

Seeing it was her mother calling, she hesitated to answer.

The ringtone persisted for a while before finally falling silent.

She leaned against the headboard, lost in thought.

She took out her phone and found Adrian Sinclair's number.

After much hesitation, she still didn't call.

At this point, she just wanted to leave.

To take her mother and run far away!

Taking a deep breath, she decided to go to the company tomorrow to hand in her resignation.

The night breeze rustled the curtains.

In the gaps where the curtains fluttered, neon lights flickered outside the window.

Early the next morning, Anna arrived at the company early with her resignation letter.

The morning fog hadn't dispersed yet, and her hair was damp with fine droplets.

She stopped to gently brush them off.

"Morning, Anna. You're here so early today?" a clear female voice called out.

Anna looked up. It was Xiao Ying, her colleague from the next cubicle.

"You're early too," she replied with a smile, tightening her grip on the envelope in her bag.

Xiao Ying sighed and walked into the building alongside her. "There's been so much work lately. If I don't come early, I'll never finish. I still want to get off on time for my date!"

Anna curved her lips slightly but didn't respond.

Xiao Ying pressed the elevator button and glanced at her. "Where do you go after work, Anna? You must be going on dates with your boyfriend, right?"

Without waiting for an answer, she added, "You're so pretty. Your boyfriend must be really handsome. When will you bring him around to meet us?"

Her gossiping demeanor reminded Anna so much of Mia Lawrence.

Anna pursed her lips awkwardly. "I don't have a boyfriend."

"No way!?" Xiao Ying's eyes widened in shock.

Ding—

The elevator doors opened.

Afraid Xiao Ying would press further, Anna quickly made an excuse. "Xiao Ying, you go ahead. I forgot something!"

Without waiting for a response, she turned and hurried away.

She decided to go up later.

Anna sat down in the lounge area and took out her resignation letter.

She had thought she would stay here for a long time.

"Anna?"

A voice suddenly came from behind her.

She hurriedly tried to put the letter away, but a hand reached out and snatched it first.

Howard Lowell took the envelope, his brows furrowed tightly.

Anger simmered on his face. "You're resigning?"
###Chapter 489

"My affairs are none of your concern." Anna Ross shot him a cold glance.

She pulled a bank card from her bag and handed it to him. "This is all my savings. I'll pay you back the rest as soon as I can."

A sudden storm erupted outside. Raindrops hammered against the windowpane. She looked out at the gloomy sky, feeling suffocated by its oppressive weight.

Howard Lowell stared at the card for a long moment. A cold laugh escaped him. "Anna, are you mistaken? Do you really think you get to decide whether you stay or go?"

Her heart clenched. He showed her his phone, displaying the chat history with her mother. Those piercing words stabbed into her heart like knives.

How desperate and terrified must her mother have been to beg like that?

Howard put his phone away, watching her with an amused smirk. "Anna, we had an agreement. You need to help me through this difficult time."

Anna frowned tightly. In the end, she said nothing more.

"Let's end this discussion here. Don't let me see such pointless antics again." Howard tore the bank card in half and tossed it into the trash. "Have dinner at your mother's tonight. She says she misses you."

He gave her a dismissive glance, whistling as he strode away.

The world seemed to spin. Anna grabbed the sofa to steady herself.

Since she couldn't escape, how could she possibly face all this?

She didn't know how she made it back to her desk. She sat in a daze for a long time, unable to focus on work. Finally, she went to ask Howard for time off.

He clearly didn't want to approve it. But he feared she might actually quit. He eventually agreed.

Anna packed a few books she often read and took a taxi home.

The house was a bit messy. She couldn't help but start tidying up. Since she had these two days off, she could clean and then stay with her mother for a few days.

She could bring the clothes she bought last time too.

She slept fitfully all afternoon. When she woke up, it was already dark. The room was unlit. A wave of loneliness washed over her, making it hard to breathe.

Anna got up and washed her face. She realized her phone had died. She must have forgotten to charge it.

As soon as she plugged in the charger, notifications chimed repeatedly. Her mother had called several times. There was also a call from Noah Watson.

She hesitated for a moment, then called her mother back first.

"Mom, my phone died." Anna bit into a piece of bread while putting on her jacket to go out.

Vivian Lowell sounded relieved. Her voice was warm and loving. "I'm just glad you're okay. I called yesterday too, but you didn't answer. I was so worried."

Her mother was always like this, always putting her child first.

Anna opened the wardrobe and took out the new clothes she bought last time. The thick fabric felt warm to the touch. Mom definitely wouldn't feel cold in these. A slight smile touched her lips. "Mom, I'm coming over now. You have to make me something delicious."

"Of course, of course. Please be careful on your way." Vivian's voice was full of joy.
###Chapter 490

It had been quite some time since they last met.

Anna Ross picked up her shopping bag to leave when something slipped out of her purse.

It was the lipstick Adrian Sinclair had given her.

She had tossed it into her bag last time and forgotten to take it out.

She bent down to pick it up, staring at the exquisite gift box.

She remembered the expression on his face when he shoved the present into her hands.

Stubborn, with a touch of awkwardness.

Vivian Lowell heard her prolonged silence and asked softly, "Anna, is everything alright?"

"Everything's fine, Mom. My ride is here. I have to go." Anna placed the gift box on the entryway console.

She ended the call and glanced out the window again.

The rain showed no sign of letting up.

Without an umbrella, she would be drenched the moment she stepped out of the car.

She turned back and grabbed an umbrella.

Noticing Noah Watson's missed call on her phone, she immediately called back.

The moment the call connected, a panicked voice came through. "Executive Assistant Ross, you finally called back! I think Mr. Sinclair is missing!"

Anna's heart clenched.

She thought he was joking and forced herself to sound calm. "Stop joking. How could a grown man like Adrian Sinclair just disappear?"

Noah was so flustered he could barely speak coherently, raising his voice. "I'm not lying! I thought he had business and didn't come to the company this morning."

"But when I called later, no one answered!"

"You know he always informs me when he's traveling or going out, so I can adjust his meeting schedule. But today, there was no message at all!" Noah was practically spinning with anxiety.

He began to blame himself. He shouldn't have let him stay alone that night. He should have stayed with him no matter what.

Before he could finish, the call was disconnected.

Noah anxiously thought for a moment, then grabbed his jacket and rushed to the company.

Anna hung her clothes back in the wardrobe.

Without caring about anything else, she repeatedly called Adrian's number.

No one answered.

She gradually began to panic.

She then contacted Sophia Roscente, hoping to get information through Marcus Hill.

Weren't they good friends? Maybe he knew something.

But it was as if everyone had agreed not to answer her calls.

Anna tightened her grip on the umbrella and hurried downstairs.

She decided to go to the company first. Perhaps he had already returned.

When she arrived at the company, she ran into Noah, who was rushing downstairs.

Noah seemed to understand why she was there and shook his head with a grim expression.

Anna was still catching her breath.

Seeing that Noah had a car, she immediately said, "Assistant Watson, please drive."

"Okay." The other party didn't dare delay and quickly ran to the driver's seat.

Anna got into the car, fastening her seatbelt as she asked, "Does the Lowell family know about this?"

Noah sighed. "Probably not. Actually, Mr. Sinclair was in a very strange mood that night. I'm mainly worried he might do something reckless."

He glanced at the person beside him, swallowing back many questions.

Anna vaguely guessed the reason, a sense of unease rising within her. "Do you know the places he often goes to when he's in a bad mood?"

"Well..." Noah scratched his head in thought, then suddenly his eyes lit up. "I know! Let's hurry there and check!"
###Chapter 491

They rushed to The Royal Lounge where Anna Ross worked.

It was still empty.

They had searched every possible location.

There was still no sign of him.

Noah Watson slammed on the brakes.

The red light ahead glared brightly.

He glanced irritably at his phone.

The dial screen once again showed the call went unanswered.

Noah rubbed his temples. "Maybe... we should go see the Chairman?"

He was reluctant, but they were out of options.

Calling the police would alert the media.

News of the Lowell family heir's disappearance must not get out.

Anna was about to speak.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

It was a call from her mother, Vivian Lowell.

"Anna, where are you? What's taking so long?" Vivian's voice was laced with worry.

Walking alone on a rainy night was always unsettling.

Anna's fingers tightened.

She explained softly, "Mom, something came up last minute. I can't make it tonight."

"Please eat without me. Don't wait."

The light turned green.

Noah started the car again.

Vivian pressed, "Are you still out?"

Anna quickly found an excuse. "Mia asked me to pick her up. I have to go, Mom."

The moment the call ended, Noah suddenly made a U-turn.

He headed straight for the Lowell Manor.

Anna recognized the route.

She didn't want to face Grandpa Lowell.

But now, there was no other choice.

The Lowell Manor was brightly lit.

Noah saw her hesitation. "Want to wait outside?"

Anna shook her head. "Let's go in together."

A sliver of hope remained in her heart.

Perhaps he was home.

They walked around the screen.

They unexpectedly ran into Chloe Valentine.

Her eyes were red and swollen. She had clearly been crying.

Their eyes met.

Chloe abruptly turned her head away.

"Executive Assistant Ross! You must know where Adrian is!" Chloe suddenly lunged at her.

Her makeup was a mess. "He's always clinging to you! Tell me!"

Anna stood frozen.

She couldn't react for a moment.

Grandpa Lowell closed his eyes. "Noah, are you here for Adrian too?"

Noah nodded. "Chairman, you already know?"

"The phone is off. He's not home... He's vanished into thin air!" Chloe collapsed onto the floor.

Her voice was completely broken.

Noah stood silently with his arms crossed.

If the Chairman got involved, they might have news soon.

Grandpa Lowell adjusted his glasses.

His gaze swept toward Anna. "You have no clues either?"

Anna's fingers trembled slightly. "No."

"Liar! He went to find you!" Chloe suddenly grabbed her collar.

Her nails nearly dug into the fabric.

Her eyes were terrifyingly wild.
###Chapter 492

Niamh Ethelred was busy in the kitchen with Rowan.

They were preparing to make cookies.

Mrs.Melford was cleaning the living room.

The landline phone in the villa suddenly rang.

Mrs.Melford was a bit puzzled.

Everyone had a mobile phone now.

This phone had practically become a decoration.

She had worked here for so long.

This was the first time she had heard it ring.

"Hello, Sinclair residence," Mrs.Melford answered the phone.

"Is Niamh Ethelred there?" Adrian Sinclair's voice came from the other end.

Mrs.Melford was taken aback.

"Sir? You're looking for Ms. Ethelred?"

"Is she at the villa?" Adrian asked.

"Yes, Ms. Ethelred is in the kitchen, making cookies with the young miss. Should I call her for you?" Mrs.Melford inquired carefully.

"No need. It's fine that she's there." Adrian hung up after saying this.

Mrs.Melford put down the phone, feeling somewhat confused.

The sir had specifically called.

But only to confirm if Ms. Ethelred was here.

She took out her phone and glanced at it.

She realized it had been switched to airplane mode at some point.

She remembered her grandson had played with her phone yesterday.

He must have pressed something by mistake.

"That could have caused trouble," Mrs.Melford muttered softly.

Niamh Ethelred peeked out from the kitchen.

"Mrs.Melford, what's wrong?"

"Nothing, sir just called and asked if you were here," Mrs.Melford explained.

Niamh Ethelred's cheeks flushed slightly.

She thought of Rowan's words again.

"Did he say anything else?"

"He hung up after knowing you were here," Mrs.Melford said.

Niamh Ethelred was lost in thought.

Was he looking for her?

Or just confirming her whereabouts?

She shook her head and stopped overthinking it.

"Mrs.Melford, where is the icing sugar?"

"I'll get it for you." Mrs.Melford walked into the kitchen.

She took a new pack of icing sugar from the cabinet.

Rowan's small hands were covered in flour.

Mrs.Melford smiled and encouraged her.

"You can do it, young miss."

"I'll treat you to cookies later," Rowan said sweetly.

Niamh Ethelred measured the icing sugar.

She added it to the butter and mixed it well.

Rowan watched intently.

Half an hour later.

A tempting aroma wafted from the oven.

Rowan brought out the baked cookies.

"Mrs.Melford, try some quickly."

Mrs.Melford washed her hands and picked up a piece.

"It's delicious!"

"Big sister made them. I only helped," Rowan said shyly.

"You helped too," Niamh Ethelred said with a smile.

She put on her scarf and overcoat.

Rowan looked up.

"Where are you going, big sister?"

"To pick up Jason and Todd from school." Niamh Ethelred patted her head.

"Be good at home."

Rowan nodded obediently.

"I will."

Niamh Ethelred left.

Forty minutes later.

She returned with the two boys.

Todd smelled the aroma as soon as he entered.

His eyes lit up.

"Big sister, did you make cookies?"

"Rowan and I made them together. They're in the kitchen. Go have some," Niamh Ethelred said with a smile.

Todd cheered and ran toward the kitchen.

But Jason remained standing where he was.

Niamh Ethelred found it strange.

"Aren't you going to have some cookies?"

"Little brother will save some for me," Jason said calmly.

Niamh Ethelred patted his head.

"Go have some, but don't eat too many. You won't have room for dinner later."

Jason frowned slightly.

"Big sister, if little brother eats like this, will he become fat?"

Niamh Ethelred couldn't help but laugh.

"No, neither of you gains weight easily."

"I'm still worried," Jason said seriously.

"Then go remind him to eat less." Niamh Ethelred took his hand and walked toward the kitchen.

Todd was happily eating.

He waved when he saw them.

"Brother, the cookies are delicious. Come try them!"

Jason walked over.

"How many have you eaten already?"
###Chapter 493

Something wasn't right.

He had just seen Vincent Lombardi at the company the other day.

How did Adrian manage to capture him now?

Vincent glanced around.

The dim surroundings sent chills down his spine.

Adrian shot him a cold look.

A flicker of menace flashed in his eyes.

"Thanks to you, that's no longer the case." His voice was low.

The man fell silent for a moment.

Then he burst into laughter.

"So that's how it is. But you've already broken up."

"What right do you have to capture me? This is illegal!"

He had once run with gangs.

He had seen it all.

He wasn't afraid now.

"Illegal?" Adrian sneered.

His expression grew darker.

"A rat like you dares to say that?"

The rain continued outside.

Cold wind blew through the broken wall.

Vincent shivered.

He swallowed hard.

The arrogance faded from his eyes.

"You brought me here just for this?"

"Are you Vincent Lombardi? What did you do to them three years ago?"

Adrian set down the photo.

He slowly returned to his chair.

Rage burned in his eyes.

The man laughed recklessly.

"Who remembers things from three years ago? Don't be ridiculous. Let me go now!"

He taunted the figure before him.

His swollen eyes could barely open.

"Don't think I won't sue you!"

As soon as the words left his mouth.

Another kick landed.

Adrian watched coldly as the man writhed in pain.

"I'll give you one more chance. Speak properly." He delivered another punch.

Vincent's face contorted in agony.

He could no longer laugh.

"Stop! I'll talk!"

Adrian halted.

He crouched beside him.

"You took that woman away back then. Why?"

The man on the ground tried to touch his wounds.

But his bound hands and feet prevented movement.

"Why else? She didn't want me to find you."

He spat on the ground.

"I just asked her to help pay my debts. What's wrong with that?"

That woman was so stubborn.

She had a boyfriend with connections but refused to use them.

Now she had nothing.

"What do you mean?" Adrian asked through gritted teeth.

The thought of her facing such a person alone.

While he had misunderstood her.

Felt like a thousand knives stabbing his heart.

This pain was nothing compared to what she had endured.

Vincent, frightened by the beating, shrunk back.

"I owed money back then. Her mother liked me and was willing to help pay."

"But they had no money. I was about to leave. Then I found out she had a boyfriend."

"I asked her to get some money from him. She refused."

Rage nearly erupted from Adrian's eyes.

He clenched his fists.

His emotions were in turmoil.

Their breakup was because she was protecting him.

That strong, independent woman.

Bore the heavy burden alone.

While he had said such hurtful things.

"Then one day, I went to your school to find you. She discovered me and dragged me away at all costs."

Vincent looked at him curiously.

"You're so curious. You didn't hurt her because of this, did you?"

Before he could finish.

Another punch landed on his swollen face.
###Chapter 494

The man howled in pain, his face contorted.

"Didn't you tell me to talk? Why are you hitting me!?"

Adrian Sinclair looked down at him with cold eyes.

His voice held no warmth.

"Do I need a reason to hit you?"

If it weren't for this man, things between him and her wouldn't have turned out this way.

Vincent Lombardi tried to call for help.

He glanced around but only saw the broken walls of the abandoned warehouse.

This place was desolate and remote.

No one would hear his voice.

Adrian walked toward the entrance.

Two men in black immediately bowed respectfully.

"Take him to the police station."

The men acknowledged the order.

Vincent panicked completely.

He struggled and shouted, "What right do you have to send me to the police station!?"

Adrian paused his steps.

He glanced back at the disheveled man on the ground.

"All the evidence of what you've done has been handed over to the police."

"You'll soon get the punishment you deserve."

"No, don't—"

The man's screams were ignored mercilessly.

Only the sound of rain outside continued to patter.

Adrian stepped into the rain.

He let the cold rainwater soak through his clothes.

But it couldn't extinguish the surging guilt in his heart.

It was so late.

What was she doing?

He wanted to see her.

But the guilt in his heart held him back.

He had hurt her so deeply before.

Would she ever forgive him?

Rainwater slid down his hair.

Adrian stood in the rain, pain and regret intertwining.

He couldn't imagine how much that girl he loved had endured alone to protect him.

It was better not to disturb her.

......

Meanwhile, Anna Ross dragged her tired body back to the apartment.

Sophia Roscente was already home.

She was excitedly organizing shopping bags.

"Hey, you're back? I missed your call earlier."

"I brought you a gift specially."

She smiled and handed over a carefully wrapped gift box.

Anna looked at those gifts, feeling utterly exhausted.

"Sophia."

"What's wrong?"

Sophia noticed her low spirits and gradually restrained her smile.

Anna couldn't bear to worry her.

In the end, she forced a slight smile.

"It's nothing."

Sophia pulled her to sit on the sofa.

She excitedly shared the fun things from today.

But Anna was distracted.

She responded a few times before getting up and returning to her room.

She picked up her phone.

She dialed that familiar number again.

The receiver still only had the cold prompt tone.

Where had he gone?

Lying in bed, Anna couldn't help but let her thoughts wander.

Was he hiding because he found out about the past?

This night, she tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

She thought she would hear from him the next day.

But her phone remained silent.

During breakfast, she also had no appetite.

She ate a few bites before putting down her utensils.

She went straight to her mother's place.
###Chapter 495

Anna Ross glanced around the room.

She felt like someone was missing.

Lucas Evans hurried over to find her.

She quickly pushed the thought from her mind.

Upstairs.

Grandpa sat upright on the sofa.

His gaze shifted between the two people opposite him.

"Adrian."

He spoke in a low voice.

"Chloe is your fiancée."

"You should spend more time nurturing your relationship with her."

Adrian Sinclair toyed with the ring on his finger.

He nodded casually.

"I understand, Grandpa."

The old man's expression darkened.

His wrinkled hand slapped heavily on the sofa.

"I've given you so much time."

"Your performance has been very disappointing."

Adrian finally lifted his eyes.

Chloe Valentine glanced at him subtly.

The corners of her eyes were slightly red.

But secretly, she felt pleased.

Grandpa sighed.

"I will arrange a meeting with Chloe's parents."

"We'll finalize your engagement as soon as possible."

"This will help you settle down."

"Grandpa."

Adrian's expression remained unchanged.

"I've said it before."

"I want to focus on stabilizing my career first."

Chloe's delicate face instantly paled.

Her fingers tightened abruptly.

Her red crystal nail snapped with a sharp sound.

The same excuse again.

Every time marriage was mentioned.

He used the same reason to evade.

Before, she could tolerate it.

Now, she didn't want to wait any longer.

She would never allow anyone to take him away.

Especially that woman who was inferior to her in every way.

Chloe suppressed her displeasure.

She revealed a sweet smile.

"Adrian."

"Let's get engaged first."

"It won't affect your work."

"I can even help you."

He had just gained a foothold.

With the Valentine family's support.

His career would surely reach new heights.

Grandpa nodded with satisfaction.

He had chosen the right granddaughter-in-law.

Adrian frowned slightly.

His dark eyes fixed on her.

"We will get married eventually."

"Chloe, why rush now?"

Chloe's heartbeat quickened.

Captivated by his deep gaze.

She momentarily forgot what to say.

Adrian's lips curved slightly.

He stood up and left.

His movements were clean and decisive.

Grandpa shook his head and sighed.

His grandson was perfect in every way.

Except he was too shrewd.

......

Downstairs.

Anna accidentally bumped into the corner of a table.

The skin on her calf was scraped.

Lucas found a Band-Aid.

He carefully knelt down and applied it for her.

This scene was caught by the man descending the stairs.

His gaze turned sharp.

He was about to step forward.

But was pulled back by Chloe, who had rushed over.

Adrian withdrew his gaze expressionlessly.

Chloe tightly held his hand.

Fortunately, Grandpa had reminded her.

She hadn't forgotten the important matter.

She glanced downward.

Gently biting her lip.

"Adrian."

"I have something to tell you."

Anna happened to look up at that moment.

Chloe had an idea.

She leaned forward.

Resting her face against the man's shoulder.

From downstairs.

They appeared to be intimately embracing.

Anna's heart trembled.

Without regard for Lucas still being there.

She turned and quickly walked away.

Lucas put down the items and chased after her.

He looked back.

But found nothing.

Yet her reaction just now.

Clearly indicated she had seen something.

Adrian pushed the person in his arms away.

His tone was indifferent.

"Say what you have to say."

"There's no need for this."
###Chapter 496

Her phone vibrated.

Mia Lawrence’s name flashed on the caller ID.

Anna Ross answered the call.

"Anna!" Mia’s voice trembled. "Julian got into a fight at the bar! I can’t hold him back!"

The background was chaotic.
The sound of shattering glass.
Men shouting angrily.
It all blended into a noisy mess.

Anna gripped her phone tightly.
She glanced back over her shoulder.
Vivian Lowell was cooking in the kitchen.
The range hood hummed loudly.
Howard Lowell was sunk into the sofa.
The screen’s glow lit up half of his face.

She turned away, avoiding his line of sight.
She lowered her voice. "Send me the exact location. Keep him calm. Don’t call the police."

Mia sniffled. "Hurry… they’re grabbing weapons!"

The call ended abruptly.

Anna’s fingertips felt cold.
She turned and walked into the kitchen.
Vivian was just dishing out braised pork ribs.
Seeing her enter, she quickly waved her hand. "Get out. The smoke is heavy."

"Mom," Anna interrupted her. "My friend has an emergency. I have to go."

The spatula clattered against the pan.
Vivian froze. "But dinner is almost ready…"

"I’ll eat next time." Anna hugged her.
She caught the scent of cooking oil on her collar. "Just save some for me."

Vivian’s eyes dimmed slightly.
She stole a glance toward the living room.
Howard was still staring at his phone.
A faint, almost mocking smile played on his lips.

She quickly shoved a warm steamed bun into her daughter’s hand. "Eat this on the way. Be careful."

Anna nodded.
She changed her shoes and left.
The motion-activated light in the hallway flickered on and off.

The rain was falling harder.
A taxi splashed through a puddle and stopped in front of her.

Anna pulled the door open and gave the bar’s address.
The driver grumbled. "That place is pretty rough."

Her phone vibrated again.
Noah Watson was calling.

"Did you find him?" Anna stared at the raindrops tracing paths down the window.

Noah was silent for two seconds. "I’ve checked all his usual spots. His phone is still off."

The windshield wipers swept back and forth.
The street blurred into a smear of neon lights.

Anna clenched the steamed bun.
The steam dampened her palm.
###Chapter 497

Anna Ross gripped her phone tightly.

Her knuckles turned white.

She forced down the anxiety in her heart.

"Noah, keep trying to reach him. I have an emergency right now."

"Okay, I'll notify you immediately if I get any news," Noah Watson replied.

The call ended.

Anna urged the driver to go faster.

Raindrops hammered against the car window.

The outside world blurred.

She had no time to care.

The situation at the bar was unclear.

She had to get there as soon as possible.

The car stopped.

Anna rushed into the bar.

She immediately spotted Julian Garnache entangled in the crowd.

Several men were ganging up on him.

Mia Lawrence stood to the side.

Her face was pale.

She pushed through the crowd and grabbed her best friend.

"Mia, what's going on?"

Mia's clothes were disheveled.

Her face was full of anxiety.

Seeing Anna was like seeing a savior.

"Anna, please make them stop!"

Julian was hit with a chair by a blond man.

A dull thud echoed.

He nimbly dodged the follow-up attacks.

But he was clearly at a disadvantage.

"Julian, stop fighting!" Anna shouted.

He seemed not to hear.

He continued to brawl with the men.

Mia pinched her arm anxiously.

"We can't call the police! Julian will be arrested!"

She regretted coming here.

She regretted causing this trouble.

Anna had no time to ask more questions.

She saw Julian constantly retreating.

Behind him were overturned chairs and broken glass.

He was about to step on them.

"Watch out behind you!" she cried out.

Her body reacted first.

She reached out to pull him.

Julian looked over.

His expression changed abruptly.

Before Anna could react.

A loud crash came from above.

Excruciating pain hit her.

Warm liquid trickled down her forehead.

Blood blurred her vision.

"Anna!" Mia screamed, catching her.

The man who hit her stood frozen.

He stared at the broken bottle in his hand.

He was at a loss.

The scene fell silent instantly.

Julian rushed over and held her.

"Anna, are you okay?"

He glared at the man.

His fists clenched.

Anna used her last strength to hold him back.

"Don't go..."

Everything went black.

She lost consciousness.

Julian held her tightly.

His voice trembled.

"Why are you so foolish..."

Mia glared at the man.

He stammered.

"It... it wasn't me..."

The bottle fell to the floor.

He turned and ran.

"Stop!" Mia tried to chase him.

Julian called her back.

"Take Anna to the hospital first!"

He picked Anna up.

He rushed out of the bar.
###Chapter 498

Mia Lawrence frowned deeply.

Her gaze swept over the men who had just attacked.

Julian Garnache's words snapped her back to reality.

She nodded quickly. "Yes, to the hospital first."

The attackers stood frozen.

They had only intended to teach Julian a lesson.

They never expected their man would actually use a knife.

If this was investigated...

They exchanged terrified glances, cold sweat dripping.

Julian carried Anna Ross out of the private room.

Mia rushed ahead and pulled the car door open.

He carefully placed her in the back seat.

The engine roared as the car sped into the rainy night.

The air inside the car grew heavy.

Mia dug her nails into her palms.

She kept glancing back at the pale face in the rear.

Her eyes filled with deep regret.

"Julian, this is all my fault."

She bit her lower lip.

Her lips turned deathly pale.

Julian gripped the steering wheel tightly.

His eyes remained fixed on the rain ahead.

"Don't blame yourself. Anna will be okay."

He was the one to blame.

He was the one who insisted on attending this dinner.

The tires splashed through puddles.

Hospital neon lights glowed through the misty rain.

Medical staff rushed forward with a stretcher.

They hurried the injured woman into the emergency room.

The doctor's frown deepened as he examined the wound.

"The wound isn't too deep."

"Family, please wait outside."

"We need to clean and suture it immediately."

Mia watched the hospital bed with anguish.

Julian gently guided her out of the room.

The corridor buzzed with activity.

Faces flashed by, some joyful, some worried.

Mia suddenly raised her hand to slap herself.

Julian caught her wrist firmly.

"Mia!"

His voice held a hint of anger.

"Julian, if it weren't for me..."

"Anna wouldn't have taken that knife for me."

Her voice choked with emotion.

Her heart felt like it was being torn apart.

Julian softened his tone.

He gently stroked her reddened hand.

"Defending yourself wasn't wrong."

"The blame lies with those scum."

The corridor lights reflected in his eyes.

His gentleness made her heart tremble.

Mia looked up into his gaze.

Tears welled in her eyes.

"Julian, thank you."

Thank you for stepping in.

Thank you for this kindness.

Her fingers tentatively reached for his waist.

She rested her forehead against his shirt.

She could hear his rapid heartbeat beneath the fabric.

Would these arms become her sanctuary?

Their heartbeats intertwined in the silence.

She gathered courage and moved closer.

He simply looked down, watching.

Allowing the distance between them to shrink.

"Family of Anna Ross!"

The hospital door swung open.

The doctor's voice shattered the moment.

They sprang apart instantly.

Mia scrambled to her feet.

"Doctor, how is she?"

The doctor removed his mask.

"The wound has been treated."

"She needs to stay for observation tonight."

"The patient hasn't woken up yet."

"She's receiving antibiotics through an IV."
###Chapter 499

"Doctor, thank you so much." Mia Lawrence's anxious heart finally settled.

Julian Garnache quickly followed to the hospital room door.

Before leaving, the doctor carefully explained the key points of care.

Mia worried she might forget, immediately pulling out her phone to note each point down.

The room was silent.

Anna Ross lay on the hospital bed with her eyes closed, her pale face heartbreaking.

Mia gently sat by the bedside.

She held her friend's cold hand, her voice choked. "Anna, it's all my fault. I got you hurt again."

There was no response from the bed.

A phone suddenly rang, the screen flashing "Noah Watson."

Mia assumed it was a work call and muted it directly.

Not long after, the phone vibrated again.

Julian softly reminded her, "Answer it. It might be important."

Mia reluctantly answered. "Hello, I'm a friend of Anna Ross. She's unavailable right now."

There was a brief silence on the other end, seeming surprised.

Noah's hesitant voice came through. "I'll contact her tomorrow then."

"If it's urgent, you can tell me. I'll relay the message." Mia glanced at the bed and added, "She's currently hospitalized. Please ask the company for understanding."

"Hospitalized!?" Noah's voice suddenly rose. "Why is she suddenly in the hospital?"

Mia responded calmly. "Yes. What did you need from her?"

Noah hesitated. "Nothing urgent. Please let her rest well."

After hanging up, Mia felt slightly relieved.

It seemed her colleague was quite considerate.

Julian sat on a chair by the wall, making a call.

His brows were furrowed, his expression serious.

Mia secretly admired his handsome profile.

After last night's events, her heart raced whenever she saw him now.

Julian suddenly turned.

Their eyes met briefly before quickly looking away.

Mia pressed a hand to her chest.

Her heart felt like it was about to leap out.

They kept vigil at the hospital the entire night.

When Anna woke, she found Mia asleep with her head resting on the bedside.

Julian on the other side immediately stirred awake. "Anna, you're awake?"

Anna softly hummed in response, not wanting to wake her friend.

She tried to move her numb right hand, and Mia immediately woke up.

"Anna, you're finally awake!" Mia exclaimed joyfully, grasping her hand.

Anna nodded, a dull pain throbbing at her temple.

Seeing their concerned expressions, she leaned back against the pillows.

Mia suddenly lowered her head. "I'm sorry. I got you hurt again."

Anna suppressed the pain and managed a weak smile. "It's just a minor injury. It's nothing."

She patted her friend's hand and turned to Julian. "Julian, what exactly happened last night? Why were you in a fight?"

Julian ran a hand through his hair in frustration.

Mia spoke up first. "It's not his fault. I went to a bar to meet a friend and some creeps started getting handsy..."

"Mia, are you okay?"
###Chapter 500

Anna Ross's heart tightened.

She immediately grabbed Mia Lawrence's hand.

Her gaze anxiously scanned the other girl's entire body.

"Are you hurt?"

Mia's eyes instantly reddened.

She hugged Anna tightly.

Her voice was choked with emotion.

"Anna... You're injured this badly yourself."

"Yet you're only worried about me."

Anna gently patted her back.

A faint curve touched the corner of her mouth.

"It's really nothing."

"It doesn't hurt anymore."

Julian Garnache silently handed them two glasses of warm water.

Cold fury still simmered in the depths of his eyes.

"Men have been sent to catch those guys."

"They won't get away."

He was always calm and controlled.

But last night, he lost control.

The moment he saw Anna being pushed down.

Rage burned through his reason.

His fists moved faster than his thoughts.

Anna took the glass.

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

The chaos of last night still swirled in her mind.

The hospital room door suddenly swung open.

Noah Watson rushed in, breathless.

His eyes immediately landed on the bandage on Anna's head.

His face instantly paled.

"How bad is it?"

Anna shook her head.

"What are you doing here?"

He should have been at the company at this hour.

Noah took a deep breath.

His gaze swept over the three people in the room.

His tone became hesitant.

"Mr. Sinclair contacted me just now."

"I was about to call and tell you."

"I heard you were in the hospital..."

He paused.

His brow furrowed tightly.

"What exactly happened?"

Anna's fingertips clenched sharply.

The water in her glass swayed gently.

She lifted her eyes.

Her voice was very soft.

"Where is he?"

Noah avoided her gaze.

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"Mr. Sinclair only sent a message."

"He told me to keep a close watch on the company."

"And also..."

"And what else?" Anna pressed.

Noah was silent for a long time.

Finally, he spoke with difficulty.

"He might... not be coming back."

The room fell abruptly silent.

Mia gasped in shock.

"What do you mean, not coming back?"

Anna tried to sit up.

But a sharp pain in her head made her gasp.

"Why?"

Her voice trembled.

"Where did he go?"

Noah just shook his head.

His eyes were full of complexity.

Mia suddenly understood.

"Is it because he misunderstood you?"

"Does he feel too ashamed to face you?"

Anna stood frozen in place.

Her heart felt as if gripped by an invisible hand.

Those past events were long over.

Why was he still holding onto them?

Noah spoke in a low, comforting tone.

"Ms. Ross, focus on recovering first."

"When Mr. Sinclair figures things out."

"He will naturally return."

Anna forced a smile.

Her nails dug deeply into her palms.

"Okay."

But her mind was in turmoil.

Where on earth could he have gone?

The sunlight outside the window was faint.

Not like the overcast rain of the past few days.

The light, though weak, was bright enough.

It dispelled the oppression of the previous days.

Anna suddenly lifted her head.

A faint glimmer flashed in her eyes.

She remembered a place.
