###Chapter 1

Serenity Villas, the Johnson family

Emily Johnson clutched a stack of property transfer documents as she approached her sister and mother.

Just as she reached her sister Bianca Johnson's bedroom door, she noticed it was slightly ajar.

She was about to push it open.

Inside,she heard Bianca's voice.

"Mom, my illness is acting up again. I'm terrified that one day I'll fall asleep and never wake up. I can't bear to leave my kids,my husband,and especially you and the family..."

Bianca,pale and trembling, clutched their mother Cleo's hand as she lay on the bed.

Cleo's elegant face was filled with sorrow.

She gently patted Bianca's hand. "Don't worry, we still have Emily, don't we?"

"But will she be willing?" Bianca hesitated. "What if others find out..."

"She has no choice. If it weren't for the umbilical cord blood, she wouldn't even be here. Besides, we brought her back for your health," Cleo reassured,her eyes firm. "You know we are on your side; everyone agrees. She has heart disease and won't live long anyway. It's better to make use of her."

Make use of her! Emily felt her blood run cold. So,it wasn't love that made them search for her when she was kidnapped and went missing. It was her bone marrow they wanted. Before she was twelve, she was a wandering beggar, found rummaging through trash before they brought her back. Her tattered, dirty clothes clashed with the opulence of the Johnson family's mansion. She felt inferior and sensitive, but their words, "We never gave up looking for you," filled her heart with hope and a desire to belong.

So,she worked hard for this family, for each member, losing herself in the process.

When the Johnson family business faced trouble, she stayed up night after night, creating plans to solve thecrisis, which led to her heart disease.

When her older brother Aiden Johnson was framed and nearly killed, she risked her life and agreed to the enemy's terms to save him.

She hacked into and cleared her second brother Chase Johnson's website to save his reputation in the entertainment industry.

She tested medicine on herself to save their poisoned father, Eli Johnson.

She climbed a cliff to gather rare herbs to improve Cleo's health.

For her other family members, she gave her all, ending up battered and bruised.


As for Bianca, in the years since her return, her poor healt meant that any grievance she felt was always Emily's fault. Anything Bianca wanted,even Emily's most precious belongings, was handed over to her, no questions asked.

Even though her umbilical cord blood saved Bianca, and her boyfriend was deceived by Bianca's frail appearance, Emily forgave her, considering Bianca's weak health.

But what did she get in return?Her lifelong desire for love, her humble pursuit, all turned out to be in vain.
Her lifelong desire for love, her humble pursuit, all turned out to be in vain. She trembled in pain. The inheritance documents slipped from her hands, scattering on the floor.She painfully bent down to pick them up. "Who's there?"

Cleo got up to check the noise.

Emily didn't want Cleo to see the documents.

She'd rather donate her inheritance than give it to them.

None of them deserved it!

Emily hastily gathered the papers, but one slipped to the doorway.

As she reached for it, Cleo stepped out and accidentally stepped on her hand.


Pain!

But it was not as painful as her heart.

"Emily, why are you eavesdropping? What's this?" Cleo lifted her foot,noticing the documents. She frowned. "What are these?"

The first thing Cleo did upon seeing Emily was to accuse and question her.

No concern,no worry.

Emily had come to terms with the fact that Cleo didn't love her.

But it still hurt deeply.

Cleo probably wished she would die soon.

Otherwise,why would she hide her illness?

Emily had felt unwell before and went to the hospital. Cleo had taken the test resuIts and told her it was nothing, just needed rest.

In reality,she had been diagnosed with heart disease. Today, the doctor had shaken his head at the new results: "If you had started treatment earlier, surgery could have extended your life by several years."

She thought it was a missed diagnosis, her fate. But no, Cleo had hidden it for the bone marrow transplant.

As Cleo lifted her foot, Emily ignored the pain and instinctively grabbed the documents.


This action aroused Cleo's suspicion.

"Tell me, what are these? Did you steal important documents from Eli's study?" Cleo's fierce gaze looked at her not as a daughter, but as an enemy.

She didn't notice Emily's pale face.

Emily bit her lip, holding back the pain, and coldly said,"No,you can check the surveillance!"


Without waiting for Cleo's reaction, she turned and ran downstairs.

"If it's not, then why are you running? Did you hear my conversation with Bianca? Then you should know, your life exists because of Bianca.You don't have long to live anyway, so donating your bone marrow to Bianca is the right thing to do, isn't it?" Cleo shouted as she chased after her.

If she had a choice.

She would rather not have been born into this family.

Emily smiled bitterly.

Hearing such heartless and shameless words, she felt dazed.

In her daze, she stumbled.

She missed a step and fell down the stairs. Cleo hurried after her, muttering, "Emily, are you okay? You have to be okay,or how will we do the bone marrow transplant..." Her arm was yanked painfully. Emily frowned and opened her eyes, meeting Eli's angry gaze, and the disapproving looks of Aiden and Chase, and the disappointment in Cleo's eyes. This was her "good" mother. No, she was Bianca's good mother, not hers. Her birth was never blessed. She instinctively covered her heart. Maybe she really shouldn't exist in this world. Emily coughed up blood, staining the scattered documents red.

Her heart ached, her bones felt broken, and every joint hurt.

Her consciousness was fading.

She knew she wouldn't survive.

Good!

Death would free her from these hypocritical, heartless relatives.

But even in death, she didn't want to die in this heartless place.

So,despite her broken, twisted limbs, she dragged herself,leaving a trail of blood,out of the villa.


"Why are you so stubborn? Even if you're dying, shouldn't you think about saving Bianca first, to earn some good karma..."

Emily closed her eyes in despair.

The pouring rain washed away the blood and dirt from her body.

It seemed to cleanse a path for her rebirth...


···

"Emily, hurry and apologize to Bianca. If you hadn't conspired with outsiders to bully her, would her old illness have flared up? How can you sleep at night?"

Emily was jolted awake by a loud shout. No pain!

So,no heart disease!

She looked around.

The cluttered room filled with Bianca's art supplies, the room she lived in before she turned eighteen.

Had she been reborn?

With that question in mind, she tried to understand her situation.

Seeing the crowd gathered around her right now, ready to accuse her,brought back memories for Emily.

It was her senior year of high school when Bianca had a panic attack after being startled by someone at school. Emily had tried to help her, but ended up falling into a lake and came back with a high fever.

If anyone had cared about her even a little, they would have noticed the flush on her face from the fever.


"What are you staring at? How can you sleep at a time like this? Get out of bed,you heartless thing!" Eli snapped, ready to drag her out of bed.

Emily's body was weak, and she tumbled to the floor, knocking over an easel wih a painting on it. It was a sunflower painting Bianca had recently finished and left to dry.

"Bianca's painting... Those cost her days of her hard work! Emily, did you do that on purpose? You1 really are a piece of trash with no manners," her brother Finn Johnson, who was just a year older than Bianca and very close to her, glared at Emily. Emily smirked coldly. Bianca's so-called hard work was just a few strokes and some coloring. Most of the painting was done by Emily, which was why Bianca didn't mind Emily staying in her private studio. They had put Emily in the studio because they were afraid Bianca would get too emotional and have another attack if she saw her. Emily didn't bother to argue. Her head hurt more and more, and she stayed silent. There was no point in trying to wake someone who was pretending to be asleep or change the mind of someone who was biased.

"Say something! Are you mute now? You weren't mute when you were bullying Bianca and conspiring with those people at school!" Her other brother, Hayden Johnson, frowned and pulled Emily in front of them to face their anger.

Emily looked up expressionlessly. "What should I say? That it wasn't me?Or that I saw that person laughing and talking with Bianca, and she was the one who invited him?"

She gave a mocking smile. In her past life,she had explained that she hadn't hurt Bianca and had actually tried to help her. But they didn't believe her. They were convinced that the school bully was there because of her; otherwise, how would he know Bianca's whereabouts?

Since explanations were useless, she didn't waste her breath.

Eli slapped her hard, making her head snap to the side. Her face swelled instantly,with a clear handprint.

"You little brat, how can you be so vicious at such a young age? Not only did you scare Bianca into getting sick, but youalso tried to ruin her reputation," Eli yelled.

Everyone except Chase looked at Emily with disdain, showing no sympathy for her injuries.

Emily was deeply disappointed but stubbornly held her head high,refusing to be the submissive, people-pleasing girl she used to be.  Emily pushed Cleo's hand away forcefully and stepped back.
 "You're angry, but why hit Emily?" Cleo finally spoke up after Eli's outburst, lightly tapping his arm in disapproval. She then turned to Emily,"Why are you so stubborn? Bianca got sick because of you. You know she's been frail since birth, and the whole family takes care of her. You should apologize to her. She's kind and will forgive you." Emily wondered how she had been so foolish before, actually feeling grateful to Bianca. They had only found her because her bone marrow was useful. As for the student spot, she didn't care. Bianca wouldn't be able to handle it anyway. Most of Bianca's paintings were Emily's work. She had saved John, but she hadn't wanted to be his student. She was too busy helping the Johnson family with their company crisis and trying to please everyone. Emily feIt a wave of nausea at Cleo's fake kindness. In her past life,Cleo had always pretended to be a good person, giving her hope whenever she was hurt by her family, making her give up her own dignity to please everyone. Maybe because she thought Emily was going to die, she finally showed her true colors in the end. She had only agreed because James Smith wanted to fulfill his grandmother Uma's wish to be John's student, and she had negotiated for him to be included. Cleo stumbled,looking hurt.

Aiden, who had been silent, spoke sternly, "Emily, you've gone too far.
Today,you must sincerely apologize."

Emily's face was cold. "So that's what you want. Why beat around the bush? Just say it."

"Emily, why are you so sharp-tongued now?" Cleo looked at her with a hurt expression.

"If you won't say it, then get out!" Emily ignored them and lay back down.

"The opportunity to be Mr. Williams' student, give it to Bianca. You saved Mr. Williams, so even without this chance, he would teach you if you wanted," Eli said, trying to sound reasonable.

Hayden agreed, "You don't have Bianca's talent for painting. It's better to give her the opportunity."

"Fine!" Emily agreed quickly, surprising everyone.

"You're not planning something, are you?" Finn asked suspiciously.

Everyone thought Emily's quick agreement was suspicious.

Hayden warned, "Emily, don't scheme against Bianca. She's kind-hearted,and it's because of her that you were found. Be grateful. Once you give up the spot, don't think about taking it back." "If you want the spot, take it. But if Bianca wants anything else, just say it," Emily said coldly.


"Who taught you to talk like this? This is your compensation for what you did to Bianca. Don't act like you're so wronged," Eli scolded.

"Is that all? Then you can leave!" Emily ordered them out.

Her head was pounding, and she felt like it would explode if she heard another word from them.

"You..."

Eli was furious at being dismissed by the neglected Emily.

"Emily, Bianca is still in the hospital alone. We're going to see her. Reflect on your actions. We care about you and want you to do better," Cleo said,pulling Eli away and giving Emily another seemingly kind lecture.

They all left, leaving behind a "Take care of yourself."

The door closed,shutting out the outside world and separating her from them completely.


Emily struggled to sit up. Her head was spinning, and her forehead was burning. She needed to get to the hospital. If she burned up and became brain-damaged, it would waste her second chance at life.

Just then, the door opened again.

Emily frowned, annoyed. "What now? Can't you leave me alone?"
Rebirth: Top Star Actress
###Chapter 2
 It was only then that Finn noticed her face was unusually red.For once, his conscience seemed to kick in, and he took a step forward,reaching out with concern, "What's wrong with you? Why is your face so red?" Just then, his phone rang. "Emily,what's with the attitude?"

The person who had returned was none other than Finn,who had left earlier but had come back.


At this moment, he was holding his phone and, upon hearing Emily's words,instinctively scolded her.

Perhaps remembering his purpose, he quickly softened his expression.

"Emily, Bianca's got a good heart. If she knew everyone was pressuring you to give up your spot as John's student, she'd be devastated. She might even get sick over it. You should record an apology video and say it's a gift to Bianca."

Finn finished speaking, looking at Emily with hopeful eyes.

In her past life, Finn had been led astray by bad friends and gotten into drugs. Emily had stayed by his side, enduring his abuse and never giving up on him despite being covered in bruises. And now, he had the nerve to say something so shameless.

She must have been blind.

"Get out!"

She thought her heart had turned to stone, but it still ached with pain at this moment.


Furious,she wobbled as she climbed out of bed and pointed at Finn,cursing him loudly. Seeing the number, he immediately withdrew his hand, which had been reaching to check her temperature, and spoke with a gentleness Emily had never experienced, "Bianca, you're awake? How are you feeling?"

"Finn, I'm fine. I just missed you..."

"Wait for me,I'll be right there."

Finn responded immediately.

After hanging up, he hurried to leave, completely forgetting about Emily's condition.


Before leaving, he didn't forget to remind her, "I'll give you some time to think about it. This video will show that you're truly remorseful."

Emily couldn't care less about Finn's words.

She didn't even know how she ended up at the hospital.

Before losing consciousness, she vaguely heard a nurse's voice, "Why was she sent to the hospital so late? She already has such a high fever. Where are the patient's family members? This is so irresponsible. If she had come any later, she could have suffered brain damage."

Finally,she completely fell into darkness.

Emily was awakened by a loud noise.

She opened her eyes to see a tall figure standing by her bed.

The window was half-open.

Emily shook her head, the pain mostly gone. She blinked again. The person was still there. Confirming she wasn't hallucinating from the fever, she realized she was in a hospital room. "Don't make a sound. I'll leave in a few minutes." The person seemed to notice she was awake, leaned closer, and warned her in a low voice.

His presence was so imposing.

Even though his tone was almost conversational, it sounded like a warning to Emily.

As he leaned closer, she smelled blood on him and saw his face clearly.

"Mr.Smith!"

In her past life, she had once seen Daniel Smith from a distance while with James.

He had a cold, commanding presence, almost unforgettable at first glance.

Although he was only a few years older than James, his status was much higher.

If James, who had been brought back to the Smith family, was the most powerful person Emily could interact with, then Daniel was like a god,untouchable.


He was the head of the Smith family, a family not only wealthy and influential but also powerful.

James was just a distant relative of the Smith family, yet he could dominate Emerald City. How much more powerful was the head of the family?

In her past life,she had only seen him once before hearing of his death shortly after. She had lamented his untimely death, thinking it was a pity for such a talented person. The air around him instantly turned icy. If his enemies found him here, they might assume she was an ally. Could it be because of this incident? Emily's mind raced, and she quickly pulled back the covers. "Why don't you hide here? They wouldn't suspect you'd hide in my bed." Suppressing her curiosity, she thought it was pointless to dwell on it since they wouldn't cross paths again. "You know me." Daniel's cold eyes and confident tone were unmistakable. Emily sensed danger.

She swallowed, suppressing her fear, "My name is Emily Johnson. I had the honor of seeing you from afar with James. Don't worry,I won't tell anyone you were here today."

The head of the Smith family, injured and hiding in a hospital room, must be involved in something complicated.

She had been reborn and wanted to live well this time, so she needed to stay safe.

She mentioned seeing him once.

Daniel's brows furrowed slightly, as if trying to recall.

The Johnson family?

With James?

He remembered seeing Bianca with James.

He had heard she was a frail, often sick girl. It seemed true.

She was hospitalized again.

"Alright."

Daniel responded calmly.

Outside, there were sounds of hurried footsteps.

Daniel's eyes sharpened.
###Chapter 3

As soon as she said it, she wanted to slap herself.

What was she saying?

Would he think she was trying to seduce him and then kill her?

"No, I didn't mean that, I..."

Before she could explain, Daniel had already slipped under the covers.

Seeing him accept her suggestion, Emily quickly opened the window to air out the blood smnell.

Then she hurried back to bed and covered herself.

Next to her, Daniel had a faint, pleasant woody scent. Emily instinctively took a deep breath.

Realizing what she did, she quickly composed herself.

Hopefully, Daniel didn't notice.

Just then, the door to the room opened.

Several men with sharp eyes scanned the room.

Emily immediately put on a confused expression and looked at them.

"Who are you?"

The men, finding nothing unusual, said coldly, "Sorry, wrong room." They closed the door and left.Bianca smiled sweetly, as if the world favored her. Emily heard them checking other rooms outside. In contrast, Emily's empty room felt incredibly ironic. Daniel got up from the bed. Emily saw his blood-soaked shirt and frowned, Suddenly, James's sharp gaze turned towards Emily's room. "Should I call a doctor to bandage your wound?"

"No need."

Daniel refused in a deep voice.

He then tossed a jade pendant to Emily, "I owe you this once."

He opened the window and leaped out, leaving the room.

His woody scent faded with the wind, as if he had never been there.

But the cool touch of the jade pendant proved he had been there.

"One favor,huh?"

A promise from the head of the Smith family was significant.

Emily smiled, pleasantly surprised.

Was this a stroke of luck from her rebirth? Could she change her tragic fate?

Voices came from the hallway again.

Emily's heart skipped a beat. Were those men coming back?

But Daniel was gone,so she had nothing to fear.

Thinking this, Emily got out of bed and peeked through the door.

She saw Bianca being carefully escorted out of the hospital by the Johnson family and James. "James, what are you staring at?" Bianca asked softly, her voice barely audible.


James's intense gaze softened immediately. "Nothing, I must be imagining things. Thought I saw Emily."

Hayden chimed in, "James, you gotta be mistaken. Emily's at home, fast asleep. No way she's here at the hospital."

Emily wasn't surprised by Hayden's sarcastic tone.

Bianca said something, and Hayden and James instantly started fussing over her.


The three of them moved further away until they were out of Emily's sight.A dull ache settled in Emily's heart.

So,James had started noticing Bianca this early on.

She composed herself and went to check out of the hospital.

"Isn't this Emily, the one the Johnson family founad in the trash? I remember Bianca was picked up by her family. Are you just arriving, or did your family forget youat the hospital?"

The speaker was Sophia Brown, the daughter of the Brown family.

Being a cherished daughter herself, the social circle naturally liked to compare her with Bianca.

She didn't like Bianca and looked down on Emily, who was picked up from the trash. Her words were not kind; she was trying to provoke Emily into causing trouble for Bianca. Emily chose to ignore her and walked past her. "Hey, Sophia's talking to you! Just like a beggar, no manners at all." Sophia's sidekick blocked Emily, mocking her. Emily was forced to stop, her gaze cold as she looked at Sophia.

Sophia was taken aback.

How could a weak, self-conscious beggar have such a commanding presence now?

She must be pretending.

Sophia raised her head proudly and stared at Emily, "Don't glare at me like that. You should be glaring at those people who harassed Bianca.Aren't you her sidekick, always defending her?"

"Do you have evidence?"

A dark light flashed in Emily's eyes as she suddenly spoke.
###Chapter 4

"What?" The change in topic was too fast, and Sophia didn't react immediately, her eyes showing a clear stupidity.

Emily patiently turned back, "If you don't have evidence, then it's slander against Bianca's reputation!"

"I, of course, have! Wait, isn't your main concern that you should be avenging Bianca against those who harassed her?"

Sophia frowned, not understanding what Emily was trying to do.

Whenever it involved Bianca, Emily was always the first to defend her.

What's going on this time?

"Good, as long as you have evidence."

A fleeting smile appeared on Emily's lips, quickly disappearing,as she murmured.

Sophia didn't quite catch what she said.

Half an hour later.

Sophia sat in the police station with a sullen face, next to Emily.

Emily had reported that someone threatened Bianca and pushed her into the water, attempting murder.

And Sophia was the witness.

She had claimed to have evidence, after all.

Emily knew there was no evidence. Since she couldn't prove it herself, she let the police handle it.

If those people were actually hired by Bianca, then Bianca might need to The officer frowned,surprised by a father's words about his own daughter.

She sternly explained the situation, insisting Eli bring Bianca to the station.

After hanging up, she couldn't help but glance at Emily,feeling pity as she spoke to her colleague, "What kind of father is this? His daughter almost went crazy from illness, just got discharged, and is standing up for her sister. Instead of caring, he tells her to die."

Emily didn't know the details of the call, but given Eli's cold attitude towards her, she didn't expect anything good.

However, since Bianca was involved, she knew they would all come.

Sure enough, within twenty mninutes, Eli, Bianca, and other members of the Johnson family, including James, arrived at the police station in a large group.

Sophia saw Bianca being surrounded and mocked Emily, "Just like trash,always despised. Look at Bianca, so valued!"

Emily wasn't surprised, her face calm.

"Emily...!"

Eli walked in first,immediately spotting Emily.

But no one expected Eli's first action to be slapping Emily.

Right in front of the police.

Sophia,though she mocked Emily for being unloved, was shocked by Eli's extreme disdain. "I wondered why you gave up the spot so easily. Turns out you were planning something bad, and you dared to involve Bianca. Do you know she just started to recover? How can you be so malicious?" "Mr. Johnson, please calm down. Thisis the police station, and this isn't Emily's fault." "Who asked you to call the police?" Eli didn't even know the details but immediately condemned Emily. Bianca panicked, momentarily forgetting to act, and shouted angrily. The female officer quickly intervened, standing in front of Emily,defending her.

Emily,having been reborn, was no longer burdened by the Johnson family's lack of affection. She hadn't shed a tear.

Unexpectedly, the first person to defend her was a police officer she had only met once.

Her eyes suddenly became moist.

"Dad, you didn't even ask, how can you assume I'm malicious? Am I really your daughter? Did you keep searching for me because you loved me?"

Emily stepped closer, her eyes red as she questioned.

Eli's eyes flashed with guilt, then he felt challenged by Emily's defiance,coldly snorting, "Do I need to ask? Bianca has always been good to you,yet you caused her illness, and now you have invoIved her again. If that's not malicious,what is?"

Bianca quickly stepped forward, trying to hold Emily's hand, but Emily avoided her.


Bianca was stunned, immediately showing a sad expression, "Emily, don't blame Dad. He's worried about you and me. We came home and didn't find you. Then we got a call saying you were at the police station. Dad was just concerned."

"So, it's my fault?" Emily stepped closer, whispering in Bianca's ear, "But I did it for you. Those people dared to harass you, and with Ms. Brown as a witness, I reported it to the police."
###Chapter 5

Bianca's shout grabbed everyone's attention.

She realized her mistake a second too late, her face going pale.

But she was a pro at acting, and tears instantly filled her eyes. "Emily, are you trying to ruin my reputation and drive me to despair?"

She swayed like she was about to faint.

James,standing right next to her, quickly caught her, glaringat Emily.

"Emily, you know Bianca's health isn't great. How could you upset her like this?"


This was the first time Emily had spoken to him face-to-face since her rebirth.


She hadn't expected his first words to be an accusation.

At this moment, he was still her fiancé.

If pleasing the Johnson family was her desperate longing for familial love,then James was the only ray of hope during her days of scavenging for food and fighting off stray dogs.

Back then, James hadn't been taken back by the Smith family yet. He lived a tough life with Uma, but even so, he would save food for her and help fend off those who bullied her.


They were like two wounded animals, comforting each other and licking each other's wounds. They had promised each other that no matter what, they would always protect each other and never let go of each other's hands. Later, they each returned to their own families. He started treating Bianca well,explaining that since Bianca was favored in her family, if he teated her well, her family would also treat Emily better.

She had never doubted his sinacerity back then.

But people's hearts change, and promises, though true, can also change.

"If I remember right, you're Emily's fiancé. But now, you are defending Bianca and questioning Emily; that's quite a sight to see."

Sophia couldn't help but stir the pot.

James's expression shifted slightly, but he ignored Sophia and looked at Emily instead.

"Emily, you know I'm doing this for yourown good. Be a good girl and apologize to Bianca!"

James spoke gently, but his tone was firm.

Emily shook her head. "I did nothing wrong, so I won't apologize."

"Damn it, you hurt Bianca and still refuse to change!" Eli cursed angrily.

Even the female police officer couldn't stand it anymore. Despite the talk of Bianca's frail health, Bianca looked well-proportioned and had smooth skin,not at all weak.


On the contrary,Emily, standing nearby, was thin and pale, with a sickly complexion.

She interrupted Eli's scolding and explained the whole case. "We understand your concern for Bianca, but Emily was thrown into the water by those people while trying to help Bianca. She almost got sick and lost her mind, yet she still wanted to protect Bianca by reporting to the police. She deserves praise. You shouldn't be biased; show some concern for Emily,too." The Johnson family members were surprised and felt guilty upon hearing this. Upon hearing that Bianca's reputation was almost damaged, Bianca couldn't handle the stress. Her body trembled, her face went pale, and her breathing became rapid. Emily almost lost her mind? "Bianca, don't worry. As long as those people don't want to go to jail, they Finn couldn't help but mutter, "How were we supposed to know she was sick? She didn't say anything. If we had known, we wouldn't have ignored her."

The others nodded in agreement.

Emily knew that no matter what the truth was, the result would always be her fault.

As for concern, even now that the truth was out, there was still none.

As for the fate of those who threatened her.

Contrary to her expectations, Bianca said they were still young and that convicting them would ruin their lives. She was kind-hearted and wanted to give them a chance to change, deciding to let them go.

But she forgot that Emily almost lost her mind.

However, the Johnson family wouldn't give Emily a chance to object.

The matter was resolved, and Emily was "escorted" out of the police station by Eli.

In the car, Eli's voice was cold. "Do you still think you're in the right? Do you realize you almost ruined Bianca's reputation?"

Emily looked at Eli calmly. "So, Dad, you think that if Bianca is harassed or bullied, I should just ignore it in the future, right? I'll remember that."

"Don't twist my words!" Eli snapped, momentarily at a loss for a comeback. won't say anything. Your reputation is intact."

James held her gently, trying to comfort her.

Bianca looked up at James with wide, pitiful eyes. "Really? You won't think less of me because of this, will you?"

James playfully tapped her nose. "Of course not. You're the best."

Their intimate actions were accepted by the Johnson family, who even smiled and nodded, pleased to see it.

Only she, in her previous life, was completely kept in the dark at this time.

Emily looked at the two of them mockingly.

Bianca seemed to realize her mistake and hurriedly got out of James's arms,explaining anxiously, "Emily, don't misunderstand. I was just too upset.I
know you meant well, but you didn't grow up in the Johnson family,so you might not understand that a woman's reputation is more important than her life!"

Was she calling her uneducated and shameless?

In her previous life, when Emily dealt with various men for the Johnson family's business, they never thought a woman's reputation was important.

It was clear that they didn't care because they didn't love her.

In this day and age,judging women like this was outdated.

After all, if the woman wasn't at fault.

"Emily, you did make a mistake. Apologize to Bianca!" James said sternly,his tone harsher than before.

His attitude towards Bianca was completely different.

Emily looked at James's face, still the same face, but now so unfamiliar. The James who protected her and loved her was lost the year he met Bianca.


"James, do you remember that you are my fiancé?" Emily said, not with affection,but stating a fact.

James frowned slightly.

He thought she was becoming more unreasonable, acting out of jealousy.

"Emily, if you continue to be so unreasonable, you know that my fiancée might not be you!"

His tone was cold,almost like a threat.

It was as if he were saying something he had wanted to say for a long time.

Emily's nails dug into her flesh, but her face remained calm.

She glanced at Bianca. "If not me, then who? Bianca?"

"Emily, if you don't want to apologize, that's fine. I never blamed you. Don't say that. There's nothing between James and me right now."

Her words were "right now."

So,the future was uncertain.

The Johnson family's love and everything good should belong to her.

Emily wasn't worthy of someone like James, who had both a good family background and looks.

James also disapproved. "Emily, even Bianca is being generous and not holding a grudge. Why are you still being unreasonable?"

His eyes turned sharp. "If you continue to be so out of line, I will..."

Emily's fingers trembled. She knew what he was about to say, but she was ready to cut ties and face him directly. "What will you do? Break off the engagement?"

In this new life, if anyone were going to say it,it would be her.

She would end the engagement.

She didn't want him anymore!
###Chapter 6

"Emily, do you even know what you're saying?"

James couldn't believe the words "break off the engagement" had slipped so easily from her lips. His face darkened as he questioned her.

Emily remained indifferent. "I..."

"Emily..." Bianca interrupted urgently before Emily could finish.

A fleeting look of joy crossed Bianca's eyes, but she continued to speak with concern. "Emily, you can't be impulsive. Don't let a disagreement between you and me push you to say something rash. Apologize to James.He cares about you so much; he'll forgive you for saying something in the heat of the moment."


Bianca then tugged on James's sleeve. "James, Emily only said that out of jealousy. It's partly my fault. Can you forgive her and stick to the engagement?"

Compared to Emily's cold demeanor, Bianca appeared kinder and more understanding.

Why couldn't Emily learn to be more like Bianca?

But this gave him an out.

"Fine, for your sake, I won't hold it against her."

He nodded,his gaze softening.

But when he looked at Emily, his eyes turned icy. "Emily, as long as you apologize,I won't break up with you."

James still thought she was just speaking out of anger, not realizing her resolve.

"An apology is out of the question," Emily said firmly. "How can you be so ungrateful and stubborn?" Hayden snapped. "Look at yourself, then look at Bianca. If you could be even a fraction as sensible as Bianca, we wouldn't have this chaos."


"Exactly, Emily. We're giving you a chance to apologize because Bianca is kind and generous. Anyone else would have kicked you out by now, but we're tolerating you for Bianca's sake," Finn chimed in.

Emily laughed coldly inside.

Even though the truth had come out, and she wasn't the one who hurt Bianca, but helped her, she was still seen as the villain because Bianca felt her reputation was at risk.

Once a heart is biased, there's no straightening it.

Finn turned to James. "James, I think Emily is doing this on purpose. She probably thinks you won't really break up with her, so she's acting fearless.If you agree to break up, I bet she'll back down immediately."

James's eyes flickered as he looked deeply at Emily.

"James, don't..." Bianca started to say, as if trying to persuade him.

Seeing Bianca's selflessness made James even more resolute. "Since you're so ungrateful, I'll break up with you when we get back."

Emily's fingers curled slightly.

Even though she had decided and was mentally prepared, a wave of pain still washed over her.

Eli's heart sank at the mention of a breakup, and he was about to speak.

But Emily raised her eyes and suddenly said, "Wait!"James's eyes flashed with a hint of triumph, thinking: Of course,she couldn't bear to break up. "What's the matter? Regretting it now?" he sneered. Eli also breathed a sigh of relief.

Hayden scoffed. "I knew it. This is just a ploy to use Bianca's kindness to speak for her. How could someone as shameless as her be serious? James,you should stick to the breakup and not give her a chance to back out."

James's face turned cold, clearly agreeing with Hayden.

Emily laughed coldly. "James, you and Bianca love making people apologize. You're a perfect match. I couldn't be happier to let you be together.Why would I regret it?"

"Then what do you want to say?" James asked, his face darkening.

Emily pulled out a necklace she had always kept close. It was cheap, but precious because of who gave it to her. Now, she threw it at James without hesitation.


"To avoid any delays, let's break up now. This is the token you gave me. I'm returning it. Give me back the ring I gave you,and we can end this engagement right here and now."


James instinctively caught the necklace, feeling a strange sense of loss, as if something precious had slipped away.

But thinking about the token he gave her, which she so heartlessly returned, made him furious.

How dare she!

James felt his blood boil. "Fine, fine, fine. Someone as unreasonable and complicated as you doesn't deserve to marry me. We'll break up. I don't have the ring with me today, but I'll have it sent to you as soon as I get back to the Smith Villa."


Emily thought for a moment, then nodded. "Alright. I trust the Smith family to keep their word." She suddenly smiled and raised her phone. "Of course, I'm not worried.I recorded everything." "You... you're something else!"

James couldn't believe she didn't trust him and even recorded their conversation.

When did she become so cunning and calculating?

At that moment, she felt like a stranger to him.

Eli,seeing James truly angry, feared he might take it out on the Johnson family. He couldn't hold back any longer and scolded, "What nonsense are you spouting? James's choice to be engaged to you is a blessing. You don't appreciate it and still cause trouble?"

Emily looked at Eli, who always prioritized benefits, and bluntly revealed his thoughts.

"Don't worry. Even though I'm breaking off the engagement,Bianca can take my place. Isn't that what you wanted?"

"Emily..." Bianca's eyes filled with tears, her voice choked. "I didn't realize you misunderstood me so deeply. I got close to James because of you."

Bianca glanced at James, as if making a huge sacrifice. "To ease your worries, I'll avoid James from now on, as long as you don't hold a grudge against me or the Johnson family and don't make James sad."

What a clever move.

James's expression changed slightly.

He quickly held Bianca's hand. "It's not your fault. You don't have to do that."


He looked coldly at Emily. "If there's no trust, there's no point in this engagement."

He said it without hesitation, his gaze icy.

Emily thought, maybe he had wanted to say this for a long time. "Indeed, a fiancé like you is not a blessing," she said with a cold smile.James's face darkened.

The air in the car seemed to freeze.

Eli was furious.

He knew if she stayed any longer, she'd only anger James more. He decided to show his stance and help James vent.

"Driver, stop the car," Eli ordered. Then he turned to Emily coldly.′′YOu′ve grown bold, haven't you? Get out and reflect on your actions!"
###Chapter 7

James remained silent, clearly agreeing.

Even though it was pouring outside.

Bianca lowered her eyes, a hint of triumph flashing, but to others, she seemed still immersed in sadness. Hayden and Finn naturally comforted her.


Emily didn't show a hint of weakness.

As soon as the car door automatically opened, she got out without looking back.


Seeing her defiant stance, Eli tried to calm James down, "James, Emily's just spoiled by us. Plus, she grew up without proper guidance, picking up some bad habits from her time scavenging. Think of this as a way to temper her. Maybe she'll learn to behave."

"Alright."

James's eyes darkened at the mention of scavenging.

Wasn't she always the one who knew how to please people?

If she came back now to apologize, he might forgive her for old times' sake.

Emily had no idea what he was thinking.

Even if she did, she wouldn't turn back.

She walked into the misty rain.

The torrential downpour created a barrier of water, separating her from him into two different worlds. The car slowly drove away. One car,followed by another.

It was Cleo and Aiden's car.

Because Cleo wasn't feeling well and had rushed to the police station out of worry, they had taken a smaller car instead of the usual limo.

Their car brushed past Emily, splashing water all over her.

Emily didn't care and kept walking.

The car then reversed.

Soon, Aiden, holding an umbrella, accompanied Cleo to stand in front of Emily.

"Emily, how could you be so foolish? You can't just call off your engagement with James. If James doesn't want you anymore, with your background of scavenging, who else would take you?" Cleo's words seemed earnest, as if she genuinely cared.

Under the umbrella stood Cleo, dressed in luxury and with impeccable makeup.

Outside the umbrella was the drenched and frail Emily.

The contrast was stark.

Emily looked up, seeing Cleo through the rain. Memories of Cleo's coldness and eagerness for her bone marrow before her death flashed in her mind.

"Mom,you think my scavenging background is shameful, but James being my fiancé can save face for you, right? How can I compare to your precious Bianca!"

Because Bianca was the one Cleo cherished and who could bring her honor.

Compared to Emily, who had nothing and even had the stain of scavenging, Bianca was naturally the favored one.

After living a life of confusion, she finally saw things clearly.

"Why won't you listen? And how can you compare yourself to Bianca?
You need to know your place," Cleo said, slightly angry.

In her past life, Emily had been too timid and never truly resisted.

So,Cleo had always appeared kind and gentle.

Now, her true feelings were exposed.

She looked down upon her.

Aiden also tried to persuade, "We know what happened in the car. Emily,you need to grow up. Go back and apologize. I'll talk to James and Bianca,and we'll let this go."

"Impossible!"

Emily said firmly, "You should leave!"

This Aiden, whom she had risked her life to save in her past life, had agreed without hesitation to Cleo's proposal to use her bone marrow, even knowing it could threaten her life.

After speaking,she walked in the opposite direction from their car.

Step by step, she distanced herself from them.

As if she were leaving their lives for good.

Aiden and Cleo, seeing no point in staying, quickly left in their car.

At that moment, from a low-key luxury car across the street, a chiseled face saw Emily in the rain and frowned.

"Wait!" he said in a deep voice, suddenly instructing the driver. The car screeched to a halt.

From the driver's seat, a similarly handsome but more roguish face turned back, "Daniel, you just got your injury treated. Why are you making me stop so urgently? Did you spot the person who ambushed you today?"

Daniel didn't respond.

His deep gaze was fixed on the drenched Emily by the roadside.

Was it her?

Wasn't she still sick? And now in the rain.

Daniel wasabout to speak when another car stopped beside Emmily.

The window rolled down, revealing a bright but slightly haughty face.

"Hey, get in! I'm feeling generous today and will give you a ride," Sophia said, surprised to see Emily, who had just left with the Johnson family,now drenched and alone by the roadside.

Honestly,seeing how the Johnson family treated Emily at the police station,she felt a bit of sympathy.

So,she decided to be kind for once.

"Alright!"

Emily, whom Sophia expected to stubbornly refuse and waste her breath,surprised her by getting in without a word.

"Stay away from me. You're getting me wet. Hurry up and dry off," Sophia said, scooting away and tossing a large towel to Emily.
 
Emily took the towel and dried herself. Sophia couldn't help but mock, "Were you kicked out of the car? I told you,Bianca isn't a good person. She pretends to care about you, but in the end,everyone despises you. How about we team up?" Emily paused, looking at Sophia's scheming eyes.

Though not particularly smart,she wasn't bad-hearted.

Even in her past life, when Emily defended Bianca, Sophia never looked down on or bullied her like the other girls.

In this life, Sophia was even extending an olive branch.

"Team up? No thanks. I don't want to be a pawn in your fight with Bianca,
"Emily declined.

Sophia, annoyed at being rejected, glared at Emily,about to speak.

"But," Emily continued, "I can offer you an opportunity."

"What do you mean?" Sophia asked, confused by the mysterioustone.
###Chapter 8

Emily smiled mysteriously, her tone oddly convincing, "Trust me. I'll call you tomorrow. Come with me to a place."

The opportunity to become John's student, which Eli had mentioned at the police station, was something Bianca clearly knew about and coveted.

Bianca wanted it, so Emily decided to give it to the person Bianca least wanted to have it-Sophia.

"Alright, I doubt you'd dare trick me," Sophia said, feeling inexplicably convinced by Emily's gaze.

"Please take me to Amber District, Maple Avenue. Thanks!" Emily requested,not surprised at all.

The place she mentioned was the home she and James once shared.

To be precise, it was the old house where James and Uma had lived. James had taken her in, and Uma had known and brought her home.

So,it was the place she considered home.

She had secretly bought the house back after earning some money.

That night, for the first time since her rebirth, she slept peacefully.

At dawn, she was awakened by a call from the Johnson family.

"Emily, you're a girl. How could you stay out all night? And don't forget,you promised to take Bianca to Mr. Williams. Did you forget?" Eli's loud,accusing voice came through the phone.

He seemed to forget that he was the one who kicked her out of the car,leaving her to fend for herself in the pouring rain. Now, he had the nerve to question why she stayed out all night! "Don't worry, I won't forget. Once I setup a time with Mr. Williams, I'll let you know," Emily said, her lips curling into a mocking smile.

She wasn't exactly lying to them. She would mention it to John,but with Bianca's level of skill in painting, there was no way John would take her on as a studenat. She'd just be setting herself up for humiliation.

"Good, don't forget. And make it quick. Bianca's time is valuable," Eli reminded her.


Emily hung up the phone, scoffing. Bianca hadn't even become John's student yet, and they were already putting on airs.

She got up to wash up. Even if the Johnson family hadn't mentioned it,she would still call John. She decided to call him right away. "John, I'm not going to be your student anymore, but..."

"What? I must be hearing things. You said you're coming to be my student,right?" John interrupted, clearly excited.

He had heard her, but he didn't want to accept it, so he pretended not to understand.


Emily sighed and patiently explained, "I'm not going to be your student,but I can introduce you to a very talented one."

She had seen Sophia's paintings and knew she had some talent. It was just that she had lost to the painting Emily had helped Bianca with.

"Emily, are you messing with me? You promised, and now you're backing out. I'm heartbroken, I might get sick again..." John started to whine.

Emily knew John genuinely liked her, appreciated her character, and admired her talent. She explained everything truthfully.

"She wants to be mystudent? Dream on. Bring her here, and I'll see if she has any talent worth that spot!"

"Alright!" Emily felt a warmth in her heart, her worries dissipating,making her feel alive and vibrant. After hanging up, she messaged Sophia and Bianca, asking them to meet at John's house. She would go too; she couldn't miss this show.

The summer heat couldn't overshadow the lush trees lining the road.Maybe she was finally moving past the shadows of her previous life. She looked at the trees outside the window, feeling a surge of vitality.

Emily's mood lightened, but her peace was interrupted by another phone call. It was James, with his unique ringtone. She had been so busy since her rebirth that she forgot to change it.
###Chapter 9

"Speak," Emily's tone was cold and distant.

James was taken aback, feeling a sharp pain in his chest. But remembering the news from the Johnson family, he softened.

"Emily, I just found out you gave your chance to be John's student to Bianca as an apology. Whydidn't you tell me sooner? I wouldn't have been mad and talked about breaking off the engagement. Let's forget about it this time, but don't do it again."

No apology. When had he started talking to her with sucha condescending tone? She hadn't noticed in her previous life.

"I did nothing wrong. What apology are you talking about?" Emily replied coldly.

James frowned. What was going on? He had given her an out, and she was still acting this way. Eli was right; he had spoiled her too much.

"I thought you had changed, but you still don't see your mistakes! Bianca needs that spot to restore her damaged reputation."

"With you and the Johnson family backing her, those people must have been silenced. Why are you still talking about damaged reputation?" Emily retorted.


"This is your fault. If you hadn't involved Sophia and others, Bianca's reputation wouldn't be at risk. Do you think someone like Sophia canbe silenced?"


James blamed Emily, forgetting she was defending her own name. She had suffered too, but he had only cared about Bianca.

"Anyway, you should give the spot to Bianca. It's crucial for her. Don't worry, I'll get you a gift as a reward!" James still thought he could buy her off with trinkets.

Emily's heart no longer ached. Her tone was icy,"If it's so important, why don't you give her your spot?"

"What?"

James was either too shocked or genuinely didn't understand, so he asked again.

"Nothing. I have things to do. Goodbye."

James would soon understand. If he liked being generous with others'things, she'd let him experience it firsthand.

She hung up, removed his special ringtone, pinned messages, and blocked him. Surprisingly, she fet no sadness, only relief. The pain had been left in her previous life.

She got ready and took a cab to John's house, a beautiful villa, every frame a stunning picture, fitting John's aesthetic.

When Emily arrived, Sophia was waiting at the door, looking nervous. "I...I can really meet John? This is the opportunity you promised? I'll protect you from now on, don't worry."

"No need!" Emily replied. In this new life,she would be the boss.

Sophia was about to get angry, but Emily reminded her, "Did you bring your paintings?"

"Of course!" Sophia wouldn't miss the chancefor John's guidance.

Emily could see that Sophia genuinely loved painting. This recommendation was worth it. The security guard recognized Emily. John had instructed them to treat her like a VIP. Emily and Sophia were quickly led to John. Emily handed Sophia's paintings to John and stepped out to take a call, giving them space. "Emily, I heard you signed up for the medical competition. You should just be given the award. Why compete? Consider being a judge and give the newcomers a chance."

"Alright, I'll give them a chance," Emily said with a smile.

She agreed so easily. The caller, a renowned doctor, was delighted,showing no age-related condescension.

"And about withdrawing from the competition?"

"I'll withdraw," Emily replied firmly.

"Emily, what do you mean by 'withdraw'?" A clear, delicate voice interrupted.Bianca had arrived with the Johnson family and James.

James,claiming he had nothing to do with Bianca, was acting very close to her.


They all thought Emily had given up her chance to become John's student to Bianca, but little did they know that Emily had already given the opportunity to Sophia!
###Chapter 10

"Emily, you haven't said anything about dropping out. What competition are you talking about? I didn't even know you signed up foranything,"Bianca asked, sounding worried.

She seemed genuinely concerned about Emily.

But only Emily knew what Bianca was really thinking.

She was probably worried that Emily might join some competition she didn't know about and suddenly outshine her.

"It's nothing, just a medical competition. But I've already decided to drop out," Emily replied, shrugging it off.

"Why'd you even think about entering that competition? Is it because Bianca signed up too? I've told you, you don't need to compete with Bianca in everything. She's so talented, it's normal if you can't keep up!"James said, clearly aware that Bianca had signed up for the competition.

He even knew why she signed up.

Because she said she wanted to help him.

If she won the top prize in this competition, she would have the chance to study under a renowned doctor, and then possibly become the family doctor, constantly monitoring the health of Daniel, the head of the Smith family.

Rumor had it that Daniel suffered from a strange illness, falling seriously ill at the beginning of each month, with drastic changes in personality, and even rumors of bloodthirstiness.


If she recommended James, he might become the true head of the Smith family.

Such a terrifying illness, she was willing to risk her own safety for him.

"James, don't say that about Emily. Maybe she just wants to gain some "Mr. Williams, I'm sorry. My family was just worried that Emily's participation in the medical competition would be embarrassing, since she only learned a bit from a country doctor. We didn't mean to disturb you.I apologize on behalf of my family," Bianca said,looking understanding and responsible.

James glared at Emily, displeased.

He had been learning painting from John for a while,and John had always been kind to him. He believed he had earned John's favor, so he stepped forward to speak.

"Mr. Williams, Bianca is the kindest person, and she truly has a talent for painting. You should take a look. I think you wouldn't want to miss out on such a good student."

Prompted by James, Bianca presented her most satisfying painting.

It was an exceptionally clean and healing piece, making one feel as if they were in a fairy tale world.

John took the painting with a cold face, initially intending to glance at it and then dismiss it, but he was immediately impressed by the artwork.
###Chapter 11

Seeing John's reaction, the Johnson family was thrilled.

Bianca relaxed, smiling and exchanging a glance with James.

James nodded at her,reassuring her that everything was fine.

At that moment, it seemed certain that they would become John's students.

Emily seemed forgotten.

A flash of sarcasm passed through Emily's eyes.

Bianca dared to blatantly present her work as her own, confident that
Emily had no evidence.

Unfortunately, Bianca didn't know that in her previous life, Emily had a habit of leaving hidden symbols in her paintings.

John was clearly aware of this.

As everyone was immersed in the joy of impending success,John carefully closed the painting.

His expression changed in an instant, coldly saying, "With this level of skill,you think you deserve to be my student? Do you think I'm collecting trash?"


Bianca's face turned extremely ugly, the immense humiliation almost causing her to lose control and question angrily.

She dug her nails into her palms to steady herself.

Her eyes were red, her body shaking, and she was almost fainting from the shock. She glanced at Emily, seeing her looking kindly at Sophia. In the past, Emily would have been most at odds with Sophia to defend her.  Naturally, someone stepped up to defend her. "Mr. Williams, you were clearly impressed by the painting. Why would you say such humiliating words to Bianca? Did Emily say something to slander Bianca? Although she saved you, she can be narrow-minded and jealous of Bianca, so those things aren't true," Eli quickly spoke up,directly belittling Emily in front of outsiders for Bianca's sake.

He even reached out to grab Emily, "You need to tell Mr. Williams that you voluntarily gave up the spot. Why would Mr. Williams misunderstand Bianca?"


Emily had anticipated Eli's desperate actions and moved behind John,avoiding his hand.

James looked at Emily with disappointment, furrowing his brows and stepping forward.

"Mr. Williams, I've seen Bianca's painting too. You taught me to feel the painting, understand its soul, and connect with it. This painting achieves all that. It's clearly a good painting,why would you deny it?"

James didn't understand.

It must be Emily using her life-saving favor to deceive John.

Bianca's painting was nothing short of exceptional.

"You people are shameless. Are you trying to force my mentor to accept Bianca as a student? John has nothing to do with her,why should he indulge her?!" Sophia, who had just been guided by John and was inside comprehending the essence, quickly came out to defend upon hearing the commotion.

"What are you doing here?" Bianca couldn't help but  blurt out upon seeing Sophia. Bianca's eyes flickered, a cold light flashing.

James caught the key point, "What did you call Mr. Williams? Mentor?
When did you become Mr. Williams' student?"

Sophia proudly raised her head, "Just now!"

James immediately recalled Emily's words from this morning and understood.


So,Emily had given the spot to Sophia and then called Bianca over to make a fool of her?


"Is that it? You never intended to give the spot to Bianca, did you?" James questioned.

Eli immediately became agitated, about to hit Emily, "You ungrateful person, the Johnson family raised you for nothing."

"Stop your nonsense, or you are out!" John stood in front of Emily,preventing Eli from succeeding.

He coldly reprimanded.

Eli,for Bianca's sake, held back and urgently said to John,"Mr.Williams,I don't believe you can't see the skill in this painting. I've seen Sophia's work,and it definitely doesn't compare to Bianca's. They say you're the most principled, but it seems that's not entirely true. This is too unfair!"

"Unfair? Then let Mr. Williams set the topic, and Bianca and Sophia can paint on the spot. That will show if the master is fair and just," Emily suddenly suggested.

After all, John's reputation couldn't be tarnished because of her. "Fine!" Eli and James responded simultaneously. They directly blocked Bianca's path.
###Chapter 12

"Sophia,you got this, right?" Emily asked, her eyes locked on Sophia.

Sophia had just seen that painting. Honestly, she felt outclassed.

But there was something about Emily's confidence that made her believe in herself. She would follow Emily's advice to the word.

"Yeah, I got this. I'm not afraid of a challenge," Sophia replied,standing tall.

After all, John had praised her work before,hadn't he?

Emily smirked and turned to Bianca. "You always brag about your talent.
Sophia's ready to compete. What about you? Scared? Or maybe that
painting John had wasn't really yours?"

Bianca clenched her teeth in anger.

Emily knew exactly what was going on with that painting.

Emily had changed. She used to be so meek; a few scoldings from their parents would make her back down.

Now, she didn't even listen to James.

"Emily, what nonsense are you spouting in front of John? Of course,that painting is Bianca's. We all saw her in the home studio, painting all day long,"Eli snapped.

James, however, kept his eyes on the painting, looking uncertain.

Bianca was extremely nervous.  Even if the family found out the truth, she believed she could smooth things over.
 
But she was not sure when it came to James. The painting wasn't Bianca's, and she had been wondering how Bianca He had a childhood bond with Emily, and she feared he might soften...

Bianca looked at James with tearful eyes. "James, it's really my painting.You don't doubt me, too, do you?"

James met Bianca's gaze.

Her beautiful face was paired with those watery, enchanting eyes.

Only someone with such pure eyes could create such a healing and beautiful painting.

He nodded firmly. "Of course, I believe you."

Emily's heart tightened involuntarily at James's words.

He didn't believe her.

But he turned to Bianca with unconditional trust.

He was no longer the James who used to protect her.

"Are we competing or not? If not, just admit defeat and stop wasting my time," John, known for his bad temper, said bluntly.

Bianca clenched her fists, showing no fear on her face. "Of course, I..."

Suddenly, her face turned pale, and she seemed to have trouble breathing,her whole body going limp as she collapsed to the ground.

"Bianca!" The Johnson family and James shouted in unison, panicking. She suddenly blocked James's path. "Move!" James didn't expect Emily to block his way. She really didn't care about Bianca's safety. would avoid the competition.

It turned out to be the same old trick.

But for the Johnson family and James,it worked.

"What's going on? Fainting at the mention of a competition? If she's that weak, Mr. Williams, I don't think she's fit to be your student. She can't handle the pressure, right?" Sophia said loudly, deliberately looking closer.

"Ms. Brown, watch your words. Even if you lack sympathy, you shouldn't kick someone when they're down," Eli said coldly, glaring at Sophia.

Sophia,facing the head of the Johnson family, decided not to push her luck and fell silent.


"James,quickly, take Bianca to the car. She might be having an episode,"Eli urged James.

James, with a stern face, picked up the frail Bianca, looking at Emily with more displeasure.

Before leaving, James shot Emily a cold look. "Are you happy now? If something happens to her, can you take responsibility? Bianca is so kind.Why do you have to be so confrontational with her? You weren't like this before."

'You were not like this before either!'

Emily thought to herself.

But she didn't say it out loud, knowing it was pointless.
 
Take responsibility? How had her thoughts become so malicious?

James's face was cold, full of anger. "If you don't move, don't blame me for being rude. The engagement will be off for good."

He had already returned the token,yet he still thought she was just bluffing about breaking off the engagement.

Emily sneered, suddenly holding a few thin, sharp needles.

Then she slowly approached Bianca in James's arms.

"What are you doing?" Eli demanded urgently.

"Taking responsibility!" Emily chuckled, but the smile didn't reach her eyes. "I happen to know a bit of medicine. I can treat Bianca's condition."

James dodged Emily's needles, holding Bianca protectively.

Eli was even more agitated, and if the situation were different, he might have hit Emily.

"Are you trying to kill Bianca? You only know a bit of medicine and dare to say you can treat her? Even experts can't cure her. Do you think you're better than them? You're simply malicious. Get out of the way!"

Emily gave Eli a cold look.

Her gaze fell on James's face. "Are you sure you don't want me to treat her?Don't say I didn't take responsibility later."

James's eyes grew deeper and more complex.

"I don't need you to treat her!" James said coldly, then added, "I'll have someone return the ring to you." With that, he left quickly with Bianca, leaving only a heartless back. Eli glared at Emily, leaving a harsh remark. "A daughter with such a malicious heart, I'd rather not have had you. You don't deserve to be part of the Johnson family."

"What kind of people are they!" Sophia scoffed at Eli's retreating figure.

She had grown up pampered and had never imagined that Emily, who had been so hard to find, would be treated like this by the Johnson family.She couldn't help but feel sympathy and pity for Emily.

After cursing Eli, she couldn't help but ask Emily, "Are you sure you're the Johnson family's daughter?"

She shut her mouth after asking.

Compared to Bianca's looks, Emily took after Cleo, even more striking and elegant.

Emily didn't dwell on Sophia's question but looked at John. "John, thank you for today. Are you almost out of that medicine? I'll bring you another bottle soon."

The Johnson family only knew she had saved John.

They thought she might have just called for help or supported him.

But they didn't know Emily had saved John with needles. If she hadn't treated him in time, John would have died.

"Even if you don't want to be my student, I already consider you one. No need to thank me. And..."


John paused, then continued, "That James isn't a good person. You're better off without him. I'll introduce you to some fine young men with good character. And James can forget about learning from me again." "Okay!" Emily knew John meant well and didn't refuse. Of course, she didn't take the matchmaking seriously. She agreed with the last part. John saw Emily's response and knew she was truly over James.

After Sophia volunteered to take Emily home, he had his assistant call James to inform him of the situation.
###Chapter 13

"Just ask whatever you wanna ask already. You're staring at me so much it's making me nervous."

Emily hopped into Sophia's car, and they took off.

During the ride, Sophia kept glancing at Emily, like she had something to say but couldn't bring herself to do it.

Emily finally had enough and broke the silence.

Sophia had a million questions swirling in her head.

"What kind of medicine? It's not that miracle stuff my grandpa and everyone ese are raving about, the one that's supposed to make you young again, is it? Do you really have it? So, the rumor was that Mr.Williams was saved by some genius doctor, was that you?"

Everyone knew John had a close call and was saved by a top-notch doctor.

Sophia couldn't picture Emily as that genius doctor.

In her mind, a brilliant doctor wore a white coat and looked super professional.

Emily smirked, her confidence shining through, "Why do you think you got to be John's student?"

Sophia's view of Emily shifted in that moment.

There was admiration, gratitude, and a mix of emotions she couldn't quite pin down.

"How can you be so nice? I even thought about using you to deal with Bianca back then." She felt a bit guilty. 'So many questions.' Emily appreciated Sophia's honesty, and her smile grew, "I know."
Although she had helped Sophia, their relationship wasn't close enough for her to answer so many questions. Sophia felt a wave of relief. Since Emily knew and still chose to help her, it must be true friendship.

It seemed Emily genuinely liked her.

Sophia was good at moving on and not dwelling on internal conflicts.

She switched topics, "How did you come up with using a silver needle to scare Bianca? I swear, I saw her finger twitch. If you had really gone through with it, she might not have been able to keep up the act."

Sophia felt a bit regretful.

Emily sneered, "Keep going? She wishes! After all, I can actually treat her!"

Sophia was stunned. She knew Emily was skilled, but Bianca's illness had been around for twenty years, and many famous doctors had tried to help.

Doctors can't treat themselves, and in her past life, Emily had poured all her energy into helping the Johnson Group, researching new medicines,and treating the Johnson family, neglecting her own health.

As for Bianca, before her illness truly relapsed, she had been faking it,always keeping Emily at a distance, so Emily couldn't help her condition in advance.


Maybe it was Bianca's own doing.

People should avoid bad omens, but she loved to pretend to be sick,always talking about her poor health. How could she possibly be well?

"Then,how did you know she would faint and have a silver needle ready?"Sophia continued to ask.

Emily frowned. Sophia, however, filled in the blanks herself and suddenly remembered the painting, "That painting wasn't really done by Bianca, was it? Who's the real artist?"

Emily was speechless.

She remained silent, not responding.

Sophia assumed the artist didn't want to be known. Although she felt a bit disappointed that she couldn't meet the artist, as the painting was truly impressive and she wanted to admire it, she respected the artist's choice.

She felt that she and Emily were friends now, close friends.

She couldn't help but worry for Emily, "The Johnson family is blind. You shouldn't go back. After what happened today, you'll probably be bullied if you do. I have an empty villa; why don't you stay there for now?"

She even thought that with Bianca's personality, having suffered such a big loss, she definitely wouldn't let Emily off the hook.

Otherwise,how could the rumors about Emily bullying Bianca have spread?

It was clearly Bianca using the Johnson family to bully Emily.

She voiced her thoughts.

Emily knew Bianca wouldn't let it go.

But now, she wasn't the same insecure person who only knew how to please and never fought back.

Sophia's words reminded her that she needed a more private and spacious environment to research new medicines.
###Chapter 14

In her past life, she had given all her research to the Johnson Group.

In this life, she wanted to start her own business and have more control.

However,after buying that old house, she had invested all her remnaining money into new medicine production and didn't have much left to buy a new house.


She was planning to make do with the old house for now,then sell some software she programmed later to consider buying a new house.

Unexpectedly, business came knocking on her door.

Emily's phone rang for the first time, and seeing it was an unknown number, she hung up directly.

Later, as she was getting out of the car to head home, she received a call from Aaron Hill, a friend she met while picking up trash,who was now the head of her new medicine project.

"What's up?"

Emily was worried there might be an issue with the new medicine production and asked urgently.

"Emily, there's a business deal. Are you interested? The price is really high,so I wanted to ask you."

Aaron hadn't planned to take the deal for Emily.

He knew she was busy researching new medicine lately. But she hadn't expected it to be like this. But the price was so high that he couldn't help but be tempted on her behalf. And so soon. Emily's eyes lit up, her voice becoming cheerful, "What kind of deal? Tell me more." What surprised her was that Daniel, who had looked pale from blood loss last time, now looked even worse, his face devoid of vitality. ′′Apatient has a strange illness that flares up once a month. This time,it flared up after just half a month. Somehow, they found out a bit about our new medicine's formula, and it seems to help their condition. They guessed I know a doctor like you. The offer is one million dollars,which is really high!"

Of course, Aaron hadn't agreed immediately.

The higher the price, the wealthier the client.

And the more difficult the illness.

"Don't worry, I also said, first,you can remain anonymous; second, there's no guarantee of a cure, but half the payment is still required;third,the decision to treat is yours."

Aaron had considered everything for Emily.

"You really get me. Okay, let's check out the patient's condition first.Set up a time."

Emily was very satisfied with Aaron's approach, showing he genuinely cared for her.

Aaron agreed immediately.

The other party was eager and scheduled the earliest possible time for treatment.

When Emily saw the patient, she was momentarily stunned.

She had imagined meeting him again, perhaps in a scenario where she needed his help. His sharply defined face had become gaunt in just a few days.

The woody scent on him was stronger, but it wasn't as pure as before, now mixed with a cheap perfume smell.

Because of this, Emily's expression changed slightly, her eyes becoming sharp.

"Doctor, can you treat him?"

The man next to Daniel, Charles Green, had a roguish face that was now full of seriousness.


Although he couldn't see Emily's face, her change in demeanor and sharp gaze made him nervous, and he spoke up quickly.

Emily shook her head.

"Aren't you a doctor? How can you say you can't treat him? What kind of doctor are you?"

Seeing Emily shake her head, Charles thought there was no hope and angrily reached out to grab Emily's clothes to question her.

He even suspected she was a scammer.

Covering her face and hiding her identity, he was desperate and grasping at straws.

The next moment, Emily had a silver needle in her hand and jabbed it into his hand.

He cried out in pain, his hand dropping limply, completely powerless. Emily spoke coldly, "If you try to touch me again, it won't be just your hand. I haven't finished speaking. Why are you in such a hurry?" As she spoke, she diagnosed Daniel and confirmed her suspicion, "He's not sick,he's poisoned!" Charles knew how many women were eager to get close to Daniel,so his first reaction to Emily's actions was to think she was taking advantage of him.

If his hands weren't incapacitated, he might have already intervened. "Guards, arrest this fake doctor! And you, stop immediately,or you'll face cIgnoring Charles's suspicionas, Emily leaned in closer to examine the extent and nature of the wound's infection. Charles frowned,"How will you treat him? Can you guarantee a cure?Otherwise, I suspect you're a frauld." In her focus, she didn't notice the jade pendant Daniel had given her as a token of his promise slipping from her neck. Emily frowned. onsequences you can't handle!"

Charles shouted for help, his voice filled with threats as he saw Emily getting even closer.

"Shut up!" Emily, having been reborn, wouldn't tolerate any injustice.

With a swift motion, she silenced Charles with a silver needle.

Charles opened his mouth but found he couldn't make a sound. Unable to remove the silver needle, he could only glare at Emily with fierce eyes.

Emily pressed on Daniel's wound, causing a slight bleed. The blood wasn't bright red but had a dark hue.

The poison seemed to have penetrated deep into his system.

She was so focused on her examination that she didn't notice Daniel slowly opening his eyes.

His vision was blurry at first, but the familiar jade pendant swinging before him gradually came into focus.

Finally,he looked up and saw those calm, clear eyes.

Emily finished her examination, stood up, and calmly removed the silver needle from Charles's face.


Ignoring his murderous glare, she spoke indifferently,′′Do you want treatment or not? Think carefully before you answer. My fees are high,and if you refuse, the fifty million dollars won't be refunded."

She mentioned fifty million dollars as if it were just five dollars. In her past life, she was constantly doubted.

Now, facing such skepticism again, she turned cold and was about to leave,"If you believe, I'll treat. If not, I won't. In that case, I..."

"Do it!"

A deep, hoarse voice came from the bed, magnetic and authoritative.

It drew the attention of Emily, Charles, and the guards Charles had called in.

"You're awake? Then you decide."

Emily's tone softened.

Given that he hadn't killed her to silence her that day and had even given her a promise, she had more patience and leniency for him.

"Do it. I trust you."

Daniel spoke again, his voice weak but his deep eyes unwavering.

She was the girl from the hospital that day. If she wanted to harm him,she wouldn't need to be so roundabout.


That day, she had a much better opportunity.

However, the fact that the Johnson family's daughter was a doctor was indeed surprising!

Emily didn't expect him to be so unguarded with her. But she didn't dwell on it. Treating a patient who cooperates was always the best approach. Charles frowned and couldn't help but ask, "Are you sure you can cure him?" Emily replied, "I'll give it my best shot." "Do you know who you're dealing with? How can you just try? If you're not confident..."


"Charles, shut up! Listen to the doctor," Daniel interrupted, stopping Charles's continued questioning.

Emily smirked slightly. Having such a cooperative patient was a pleasure for any doctor.

She glanced at Charles.

Before starting the acupuncture, she softened a bit, considering his genuine concern for his friend, and said, "Eighty percent chance."

"I mean,full recovery!"

She paused deliberately before adding.

Charles was incredulous, then overjoyed, "Are you serious?"

This illness had tormented Daniel for years. If it could be cured,even a billion dollars would be worth it, let alone following her lead in the future.

Emily didn't know Charles's thoughts. Otherwise, she might have found it an appealing proposal.

Instead of answering Charles, Emily pulled open Daniel's shirt and swiftly and accurately placed silver needles around the wound.

Charles knew that interrupting a doctor during treatment was taboo.

Now that she had started,he could only wait quietly for the results.

As Emily placed the last needle, Daniel bit his lip to stifle a groan. But his brows relaxed. He could clearly feel the suffocating weight of the illness easing. He felt noticeably lighter. This made his deep gaze linger on Emily, who was focused on her treatment.


Through the mask, knowing her serene and ethereal appearance,he couldn't help but imagine her face with that same focused and calm expression.

"Hang in there!"

Emily warned as she finished the last needle.

She then used a silver needle to prick Daniel's finger and placed a glass container from her medical kit under it.

Blood dripped from the cut.

Charles leaned in closer,frowning.

The blood wasn't red but a deep black with a hint of blue.

He was now certain it was poison.

As the small bottle filled, the blood gradually turned red.

Emily pressed a needle at a specific point, and the bleeding stopped almost instantly.

If Charles had any doubts before,he was now slowly convinced that Emily was indeed a doctor.

Emily quickly wrote a prescription.

"Gather these herbs and give them to me. I'll prepare the medicine for him.After detoxification, with proper care, he should be as healthy as any other person." If this were true, it would be a joyous occasion for Daniel. Charles took the prescription, his hands trembling with excitement. However, seeing the required herbs, he showed some concern, "Everything else is fine, but Celestial Ginseng and Golden Saffron Essence are... How long can Daniel wait?"

Emily recalled where she could find these herbs in her past life, her eyes flickering.


She suggested, "I can temporarily suppress the poison for three months. Of course, I can also procure the herbs, but that will be an additional cost."

Charles opened his mouth, wanting to curse her for being so greedy.

But a knock on the door interrupted, "Mr. Green, Mr. Smith's daily medication has arrived. Should I bring it in now?"

"Bring it in," Charles decided to continue with the medication that had been providing relief.

However, as the butler opened the bottle to give Daniel the medicine,Emily suddenly knocked it to the ground.

Before the butler and Charles could react in anger, she put on gloves from her medical kit and picked up the medicine.

"Is there something wrong with the medicine?" Charles asked, his eyes flashing with uncertainty.
###Chapter 16 Let The Evidence Do The Talking


Emily had no clue what was going on.


The news on the forum spread across campus like wildfire.


She was busy working on a small programming project to sell.



In fact, some computer science students had already figured out who she was.



They even dug up old photos of her rummaging through trash bins in ragged clothes.



People were buzzing about it.



Some were sympathetic or skeptical.



[Just two photos don't prove anything.] [Emily seems pretty pitiful. She's not usually this aggressive. She must have been pushed to the edge. Maybe we should wait and see if there's more to the story.]



But most of the opinions were overwhelmingly negative.



Even those who tried to be fair were attacked.



[People who are pitiful must have done something hateful. If you're defending Emily, maybe you've done the same thing. Birds of a feather.]



[Bianca is so gentle. There's no way she could have pushed Emily to the edge. I think Emily is just taking advantage.]



[We must stand against campus violence. People like her belong in the trash.]



[Poor Bianca. Look at how helpless she looks. How could Emily dare to do this?] [Boycott Emily. I hope the school sees her evil deeds and expels her.]



When Emily arrived at the classroom, the atmosphere had already shifted.



But she was so sleep-deprived from working all night that she didn't notice anything unusual.



Until...



She found an empty seat and was about to put her book down when someone quickly placed a pen there. "This seat's taken."



Emily didn't think much of it and looked for another spot.



Just as she was about to sit down, someone put a leg on the chair. "I hurt my leg. The doctor said I need to keep it elevated."



Emily saw an empty spot in the middle of a row and asked a classmate to move. The person looked her up and down and sneered,"We have a lot of stuff to put here. Find another seat."



If the first few incidents were coincidences, this time, Emily couldn't ignore the hostility.



She frowned, her gaze cold as she looked at the people who had spoken. Her voice was calm but loud enough for everyone to hear,commanding attention.



"What do you mean by this? Are you targeting me?"



Her tone was firm and intimidating.



Some people, feeling guilty, averted their eyes.



After all, they believed she was a bully and didn't want to get involved.



But there were also those who weren't afraid of trouble or genuinely liked Bianca and wanted to stand up for her, "Some people are really shameless. After doing such things,she still has the nerve to come to class."



One person spoke up, and others quickly agreed.



"Exactly. I'm afraid that if we say the wrong thing, we'll be bullied too."



"Emily, we're talking about you. If you have any sense, leave the classroom, leave our major, and leave this school."



"People like you, who like to deal with trash, should go back to the trash bin and stop causing trouble for everyone. And don't even think about bullying Bianca."



Emily vaguely understood, Bianca must have done something to make these people think she was bullying her.



Bianca was good at hiding behind others, letting them fight for her while she remained innocent and untainted. "Shut up!"



Emily's voice was calm but powerful.



The room fell silent.



"If you're going to accuse me, at least have some evidence. Who's going to tell me what's going on?"



Emily's cold gaze swept over everyone.



"You hurt Bianca, and now you're pretending to be innocent. How shameless!" someone sneered.



Most people glared at Emily with malice, convinced she was just putting on an act.



No one directly answered her.



Finally, Emily's phone buzzed with a message. It was from Oscar,a
quiet, studious boy in her class.



Emily opened the campus forum and quickly scanned the comments.



Almost everyone was cursing her.



No one had checked the facts, and those who questioned the story were also attacked.



Emily didn't believe this was happening without someone orchestrating it.



She had experienced online harassment in her past life and knew the patterns well.



She looked at the expressions on everyone's faces.



After a year of being classmates, they were so cold to her. Bianca had played a significant role in this. Fine!



She had planned to enjoy her campus life after being reborn.



Now, she felt it was a waste of time.



She had already learned all this in her past life. It was time to consider changing her major.



"You people, making judgments without checking the facts. If you ever become part of the management team, it will be a disaster for those who report to you. Think about that."



For those who were already biased, explanations without evidence were useless.



Emily didn't plan to waste more words on them, She would find evidence and deal with the person behind this.



"Emily, Emily..." She had just stepped out of the classroom when someone almost ran into her.



"Sorry, sorry, please let... Emily!" The person was in a hurry,apologized without looking up, and then tried to rush into the classroom.



When the person saw Emily, she stopped.



Emily recognized her.



She had seen her with Sophia several times.



Her name was Katya.


"What do you want?" Emily asked calmly.


"Sophia is in trouble. She's fighting with someone. They were saying bad things about you. You need to come quickly. I can't stop her!"
Katya came from a less privileged background than Sophia and was always by her side, somewhat timid and indecisive.



She came to Emily because she had heard Sophia mention Emily several times, always with praise and even a hint of admiration.



So she thought Emily might be able to calm Sophia down.


There were several people involved, including some from the sports academy. Sophia was at a disadvantage.



Emily frowned.



"Lead the way!"


She guessed that Sophia had seen the forum and became angry when people spoke negatively about her.


Before this, Emily had only seen Sophia as a good business partner.

But on the way to where Sophia was, her feelings began to change.



Maybe Sophia could be a friend.


"Say that again, and I'll knock your teeth out!"



When Emily and Katya arrived, they heard Sophia shouting.



She was standing with her hands on her hips, yelling at a muscular guy.



Sophia was full of energy.



"Hahaha, with your delicate looks, I could knock you out with one punch." The guy laughed arrogantly.



"Sophia, I understand you're defending Emily, but don't provoke Byron Reyes. He has a short temper and might really hit you."



Bianca was speaking, protected by Hayden, Het words seemed to be advising Sophia, but they were actually provoking Byron.



"Bianca, you're too kind. She's bullying you, and you still
sympathize with her. Anyone who sides with Emily is no good and deserves to be taught a lesson!"



Hayden comforted Bianca lovingly.



They were so engrossed in their act that they didn't notice Emily and Katya approaching.
###Chapter 17 Waiting to Be Sold and Have Your Kidney Harvested
"Hayden, you can't say that. This all started because of me. Sophia's actions are the result of her being deceived," Bianca shook her head.



She anxiously called out to Byron, "Byron, Emily's been through a lot. She was jealous of the love and care I got from our parents and brothers, which made her act out. I get it, and I don't mind. Please don't go after her friend Sophia; she was tricked, too."



"Cut your crap. Jealous of you? What's there to be jealous of, other than your ugly face? You deserved to be hit, and I only regret not hitting you harder."



Sophia was furious at Bianca's twisted words and started cursing.



This only made Byron angrier.


He reached out and grabbed Sophia by the collar. His eyes were bloodshot, like an enraged leopard.



"You bullied Bianca, too. Perfect, I'll deal with you now and then handle Emily later," Byron's eyes were fierce.



Sophia sensed the danger and swallowed hard, but she stubbornly said."Let go of me! Do you know who I am? I'm the daughter of the Brown family. If you dare touch me today, you'll regret it."



Byron sneered, "The Brown family? Do you think the Reyes family is afraid of you?"



Sophia had never met Byron before. He was the illegitimate son of the Reyes family, brought back after the original heir was left disabled in a car accident. Most people assumed Byron would be the next heir.



Sophia's face changed.



Byron was pleased with her reaction and raised his fist to strike Sophia's face. "Stop!"


Emily arrived and saw Byron about to ruin Sophia's face. She shouted coldly.



Byron's hand paused in mid-air.



Bianca's eyes flashed.



At this critical moment, Emily couldn't be allowed to interfere.



If Sophia's face were ruined, Emily would be the one responsible.Sophia might not blame Emily immediately, but over time,her twisted psyche could turn her against Emily.


"Emily, it's dangerous! Don't go over there!" Bianca shouted urgently.



Byron heard Emily's arrival and didn't stop his fist, aiming for Sophia. After dealing with Sophia, he would handle Emily to vent Bianca's anger.



"Sophia..."



Katya arrived a moment later, saw the scene, and screamed in fear,covering her face to avoid witnessing the tragedy.



Bianca secretly smirked, her eyes filled with uncontrollable glee.



The next moment, a painful scream echoed.



But it wasn't Sophia's.



It was Byron's rough voice.



Everyone present was shocked.



Bianca's smirk froze, and Hayden's eyes widened in disbelief at the scene. Emily had effortlessly caught Byron's fist, her expression eerily calm.



Byron's fist was immobilized in her hand, unable to move.



As for Sophia, she had closed her eyes in despair, feeling regret for the first time. But the expected pain never came. Instead, she felt dizzy and found herself pulled behind Emily.



Sophia, feeling like she had narrowly escaped death, opened her eyes to see Emily holding Byron's fist as if itwere an ant.



Emily's ferce gaze and perfect profile were stunning.



"Emily, you saved me! I thought I was going to be disfigured."Sophia suddenly turned into a fawning puppy, rubbing against Emily's arm.



Emily wasn't used to such close contact, having never experienced it before. She felt uneasy and pushed Sophia towards Katya.



"Let go of me, you crazy woman!" Byron couldn't believe Emily's strength and felt an intense pain, as if his bones were breaking.



The fact that Emily and Sophia were talking as if he wasn't there made him feel humiliated in front of his followers and Bianca. He glared at them, furious.



He gritted his teeth and tried to break free from Emily's grip, but it was futile.



Bianca frowned.



She couldn't believe Emily had the strength to hold Byron. Maybe Byron was just pretending because he found Emily attractive.



No way. Even if she didn't like Byron, she wouldn't let Emily have him.



"Emily, blame me if you want, but don't anger Byron. He's only misunderstanding you because of me. If you have any grievances,take them out on me," Bianca said anxiously, trying to intervene. Hayden held her back each time, "Don't go. You're weak and might get hurt by Emily. Let me handle this."



He comforted Bianca and then stepped forward,coldly commanding, "Emily, let go. Don't think that just because you're strong from scavenging, you can take on Byron. He's just playing with you."



Others chimed in.



"Hey, Emily, let go. Byron is just being kind to you.Don't think you're really capable."


"Byron, don't be gentle with her. She's just trying to seduce you,but your heart belongs to Bianca."



These people were used to bullying female classmates with Byron,spewing vulgarities effortlessly.



Emily's eyes narrowed. Hayden continued, "Emily, how long are you going to keep this up?Do you know who this is? He's the future heir of the Reyes Group.
Angering him will affect our Johnson Group. You bullied Bianca,
and Byron is defending her. You deserve this. Take the beating and learn your lesson!"



This was her brother.



In her past life, she risked everything for him, even nearly Iosing her life.



And what did she get in return?



He was grateful to Bianca for worrying about him, while she lay injured and alone, accused of faking her illness.



By now, Hayden was already being set up.



Emily's cold smile appeared, "Instead of worrying about Bianca,you should take care of yourself. Or enjoy your last moments." After all, if she hadn't saved him, he would have been tricked into going abroad and losing a kidney.



"How dare you curse me!"



"Emily, you can hate me, but how can you curse Hayden?" Bianca cried, looking like she was about to faint



Byron's heart ached seeing this.



He gritted his teeth and pulled hard.



Emily's eyes flashed with a strange smile.



She suddenly let go.



Byron,having used all his strength, stumbled and fell to the ground.


 
"Byron!" Chaos ensued.



Sophia couldn't help but laugh, looking at Emily with admiration



Katya was equally shocked.



"Let's go!" Emily didn't want to waste time and called Sophia and Katya to leave.



"Emily, you're dead meat! You won't make it out of this grove alive today!" Byron, humiliated. blocked their path with murderous intent.



His followers, realizing what happened, joined him in blocking the three girls.
###Chapter 18 Torturing Byron, Easy Peasy


"Really? You sure you wanna stop us now?" Emily's smile was cold and unyielding.



Sophia admired Emily's courage, but the odds were against them.and the other side had the numbers...



She reached out and tugged at Emily's sleeve, as if to remind her.



But Emily ignored her completely.



Instead, she nodded at Katya



Katya immediately understood and nodded back.



Sophia was speechless.



What were they doing? Byron seemed to have forgotten his recent embarrassment, thinking it was just Emily catching him off guard and being a bit stronger.



Now, hearing Emily's words, he laughed, a bloodthirsty glint in his eyes. "I'm not just gonna stop you; I'm gonna make sure you don't leave here in one píece."



Bianca was anxious. "Emily, apologize to Byron quickly. Whatever grudge you have, you can take it out on me later..."



"Bianca, don't bother. Let this be a lesson for her arrogance!"shouted two others, trying to make their presence known.



Emily didn't even glance at them.



Byron waved his hand. "Everyone, get her! Teach this Emily a lesson!"



"Yes!" Byron's lackeys charged forward.



As for Byron, he thought dealing with a few girls didn't require his
personal involvement.



He stood back to enjoy the show.



However, cries of pain echoed one after another.



In almost an instant, the group was all on the ground, groaning in pain.



Byron's expression turned serious, his attitude becoming more earnest.



"Alright, I didn't expect you to have some skills. Now I'll give you a proper welcome!" Byron gritted his teeth, his eyes darkening as he swung a punch at Emily.



"Emily, watch out!" Sophia was extremely nervous.



She could tell Emily was quite capable. But Byron seemed to have some combat training.



No one believed Emily could win.



Sophia even nudged Katya, urging her to call for help.



But strangely, Katya just stared intently, not moving an inch.



"Fuck! My hand... my foot... It'sbroken! You bitch, you hurt me! I won't let you get away with this!"



In almost an instant, Byron's screams filled the air, his threats mingled with cries of pain.



Emily's foot was planted firmly on Byron's chest.



"Shut up!" Emily warned disdainfully, applying a bit more pressure with her foot. Byron actually shut his mouth. Bianca and Hayden were both stunned.



Emily dusted off her hands after the fight and turned to the equally stunned Sophia and Katya. "Let's go!"



She had other matters to attend to.



And she needed to catch up on some sleep.



Sophia and Katya,realizing what had happened, quickly followed her lead.



"Emily, you're amazing. Where are you headed? I'l have the driver take you."



Sophia smiled happily



Emily thought for a moment. She was indeed tired, so she agreed.



When Emily mentioned Serenity Grove, Sophia was initially surprised.


"Is that your house?" For some reason, she felt it must be EmiIy's.



The more she got to know Emily, the more she realized how impressive she was.



After the initial surprise, Sophia thought it made sense for someone as capable as Emily to own such a house.



Just.a few days ago, it seemed like she was living in a rundown place, and now she had a mansion. Her ability to make money was astonishing.



Before Emily could answer her question, Sophia suddenly grabbed Emily's hand, her eyes shining. "Emily, from now on, I'm sticking with you. You have to protect me."



Suddenly, she had a new admirer.



Emily found it quíte nice. Despite the danger earlier, Sophia had been scared to death but hadn't thought of abandoning her. She wasa friend worth having.



Emily thought for a moment and nodded. "We'll see how you do."



That was a hopeful sign.



Sophia immediately saluted. "I'll do my best, Emily. Just watch."



Soon, the car arrived at the mansion's gate.



Emily scanned her face,and the car was allowed to drive in.



This indirectly confirmed her ownership of the place.



Katya had been quiet the whole time, but she was secretly amazed.



When they reached the mansion's entrance, Emily got out of the car and said to Katya, "Remember to send me you know what!" Then she coolly walked into the house.



Sophia,still in the car, started "interrogating" Katya about what secrets she had with Emily.



Back home, Emily first checked the IP addresses of those who had slandered her on the forum, saved the information, and then slept until the next day.



The next day, the principal's office called.



Emily was puzzled. She hadn't even prepared her transfer materials yet. The principal couldn't be calling about that, right?



Could it be Byron's family?



She certainly dlidn't think it was Byron himself. He was probably bedridden by now.



"Mr. Principal, you wanted to see me?" Emily knocked politely and entered.



As soon as she stepped in, a large hand grabbed her impatiently.


The principal stepped aside, giving them space to handle the matter.



After all, theJohnson family had donated a building to the school,and Emily was still considered part of the Johnson family. The principal naturally gave them face.



"You're not staying in the dorms or returning to the Johnson Villa.
Where are you staying at night?" The person gripping her hand started with an aggressive question.



Emily saw it was the upright and elegant Aiden and was momentarily surprised.



She quickly composed herself and shook off Aiden's hand.



"Is this why you came to see me? I've been away from home for days, and now you care? Isn't it a bit late?" Emily retorted sarcastically.



If Cleo was like poison wrapped in honey, Aiden was a more complex figure in her heart.



He was dutiful and seemed fair most of the time.



And it was he who had personally driven her back and taken her to the hospital, preventing her fromn freezing to death that winter.



She should be grateful to him.



But in her past life, when she was sick and needed to donate bone marrow to Bianca, the Johnson family was under Aiden's control.



So,it was he who made the decision.



He played a significant role in pushing her into the abyss.



Aiden was momentarily speechless, his face showing a hint of guilt. But he quickly masked it with the purpose of his visit.



"So, you're holding a grudge against the family, deliberately staying out and provoking Byron!" Aiden frowned, accusing her.



Emily's face turned cold.



Whenever it involved Bianca, they didn't even bother to ask for the full story. It was always her fault.



"So,you're here to point fingers! Who told you this, Hayden or Bianca?"



Her expression was icy. ′′Let me guess, Bianca must have said, 'It's all my fault. If it weren't for me, Emily wouldn't have acted out or angered Byron. If I could, I'd apologize to Byron on Emily's behalf.but I'm afraid the Reyes family wouldn't accept it."



Aiden's brow twitched.



Emily had hit the nail on the head. If she knew how much Bianca was troubled and worried for her.why did she still act this way?



Hayden said Emily had changed, becoming more malicious and uncontrollable.



Aiden didn't believe it at first.



But now he could see that Emily was no longer the obedient girl she used to be.



If Emily knew this, she would probably curse Hayden with all she could.



Just because she didn't follow their wishes and act like a puppet,they thought she was disobedient.



It only showed that the Johnson family was full of control freaks.


"Since you know, I won't waste words. You're coming with me to the Reyes Villa to apologize to Byron. I'll do my best to speak on your behalf. The Reyes family might go easy on you for my sake."
Aiden said, reaching out to grab Emily's hand again.
###Chapter 19 You Don't Have Any Evidence,But I Do
Emily not only dodged Aiden's hand but also slapped it away with her own.



The sting made him instinctively pull his hand back.



"Aiden, if you keep trying to get handsy, don't blame me for not holding back. I've been dealing with the street since I was a kid, so I've got plenty of strength!" Emily warned, her voice icy.



It was still the same thin face from before.



But now, Aiden saw nothing but unfamiliarity in her expression.



Could it be because of the misunderstanding from the last time Bianca was bullied, and she got upset?



Aiden frowned and softened his tone, "Emily, don't be stubborn. I'm doing this for your own good. You know we have a partnership with the Reyes family. If they come after us, we need to give them an explanation. If you admit your mistake, they won't be too harsh."



"And if you don't apologize now, the Reyes family might call the police. Do you really want to ruin yourself over this?"



"Call the police?" Emily raised an eyebrow."Let them do that then!



She would welcome it.



Even if they didn't call the police, she would.



Aiden was furious at Emily's stubbornness.



It seemed the Johnson family's kindness and protection over the years had made her arrogant.



Hayden was right; she needed to face some hardships to see reality



"If you won't listen, you'll regret it later." When that time came, even if she begged him for help, he wouldn't easily agree.


Aiden opened the door to leave, only to come face-to-face with a uniformed officer.


As the heir to the Johnson family business, he quickly regained his composure after a moment of surprise.


"Who is Emily? We have a case of assault and need you to come with us to the station for investigation," the officer said,showing his badge.


Aiden looked at Emily with a complex expression. "If you regret it now, I can still help you..."


"I'm Emily. Let's go!" Emily didn't wait for Aiden to finish. She calmly nodded to the officer and walked out first.


Her composed demeanor made it seem like she was going to receive an award. Aiden's face darkened.



He watched Emily's back with a cold smile. She probably didn't realize that with the Reyes family's lawvyer involved, she might end up spending some time in jail.



As she was "taken away" by the police from school,someone secretly took photos, adding new material to the already buzzing campus forum. The news spread from one department to the entire university and beyond.


Even though the principal wanted to keep things quiet,hearing that the Reyes family was involved, he knew his efforts would be in vain.



He could only try to control the forum's discussions and prevent students from spreading the news further.



Emily, unfazed,followed the officers to the station.


Byron's biological mother, Sabrina, was so agitated upon seeing Emily that she tried to rush at her."You wretch! How dare you hit Byron? He's bedridden because of you! Why don't you just die? No wonder you were abandoned,you trash..."



Sabrina hurled insults at her.



Aiden, who had followed them, heard Sabrina's words.



Emily was still part of the Johnson family, so Sabrina's insults were indirectly aimed at them, too.



Eli was away on a business trip and was unaware of this yet



Aiden,swallowing his pride, quickly tried to calm Sabrina down."Mrs. Reyes, please calm down. Don't worry, we'll cover Byron's medical expenses, and we won't protect Emily for her mistakes."



Sabrina's anger was one thing, but her outburst was also a test of the Johnson family's reaction.



"Emily, you think you're so tough? Now you can face the consequences of your actions!" Hayden sneered, standing next to Bianca.



Bianca looked at Emily with concern. "Emily, before the case is finalized,you should apologize and seek Byron's forgiveness. Maybe they'll go easy on you. Otherwise, what will you do if you end up in jail?" She sounded like a caring sister.



Hayden, standing nearby, added, "Bianca, youI're too kind. She bullied you, and you're still thinking about her. She deserves this!"



Aiden, with a stern face, lowered his voice and reminded Emily."Now do you understand my intentions? You should listen to us;we're all trying to help you!"



Emily sneered, "You all are such good family members. The charges aren't even confirmed, and you're already making me confess, afraid the Reyes family won't have enough evidence!"



Sabrina's face darkened. "What, you think you can deny it? Growing up in the streets, you've learned to be a rogue, but it won't help you here. You dared to hit Byron; I'll make sure you rot in jail." Emily laughed coldly. "Do you have any evidence? Just accusing me of hitting Byron doesn't make it true."



She remembered that there were no cameras in the small grove.



That's why Byron had taken Sophia there to bully her.



"You think there's no surveillance, but Byron's injuries are real.Hayden is a witness, and so are many other students. They all saw you hit him."



Sabrina wasn't speaking without reason; she had consulted with their lawyer and wouldn't be easily swayed by Emily.



Emily's cold gaze shifted to Bianca and Hayden.



Aiden hadn't expected Hayden to testify against her.



But maybe he was considering the partnership between the two families and wanted to stand up for Bianca, who had lost her spot.
Of course, Aiden didn't agree with it. No matter how wrong Emily was, it should have been handled within the family. Taking it outside would only disgrace the Johnson family.



Hayden met Emily's gaze and snorted, "What are you looking at?I'm telling the truth. And I'm the witness, so why are you glaring at Bianca?"



Emily cursed silently. 'Fool.'



Bianca had sold him out, and he was still backing her up!



She looked back at the smug Sabrina.



"Hayden has a grudge against me, so his testimony might not be valid. Did he mention who started it? If he lies, that's perjury."



Emily confidently smirked, her lips curling coldly. "Even if I hit Byron, it was self-defense."



"Self-defense? You call it self-defense when Byron can't even get out of bed?" Sabrina screeched.



Byron's father, Isaac Reyes, also had a stern face, but he didn't look at Emily.



To him, Emily was just a woman with no significance



So he spoke directly to Aiden, "It seems Emily doesn't realize her mistake. I can't overlook this for the sake of our partnership. We'll proceed according to the law."



"Fine, Mr.Reyes, let's follow the law. If Byron is faking his injuries,that's a false accusation, and I can countersue. So, I suggest you take him to the hospital for an injury assessment."



"Emily, stop talking and don't make things worse!" Aiden thought Emily didn't understand the severity of the assessment and scolded her.



"Emily,you're quite bold. Fine, we'll have the hospital do a thorough assessment!" Isaac said, fuming as he and Sabrina prepared to leave. Emily suddenly pulled a USB drive from her bag and said,′′Mr.
Reyes, I almost forgot. You might not have footage from the grove,but I do!"
###Chapter 20 Reversal: Now It's Her Turn


"How could you possibly have evidence?"



Sabrina's eyes widened with panic. She knew exactly who Byron was.



Quickly, she composed herself, mocking Emily while reaching out to snatch the USB drive from her hand.



Emily was prepared for this, dodging Sabrina's grasp and handing the USB drive to the nearby female police officer.



"This is the truth, caught on video."


As long as the content was in her favor, it was enough.


Hayden pointed at Emily, his face cold, shouting,"When did you record this? When did you become so sneaky?" Emily sneered, "If recording a video to protect myself is sneaky,
then what do you call plotting against me, bullying my friends,and even faking evidence?"


"Emily, how can you say that to Hayden? We tried to persuade you at the time. If you had evidence, why didn't you present it earlier?"



Bianca spoke with a hurt expression.



In the end, it was always her fault.



Emily couldn't be bothered to argue with Bianca.



She turned to the female police officer and said, "The video on the USB drive shows that Byron was the one who started trouble with my friend. I tried to leave with my friend, but they stopped us.We fought back and injured them. It should be considered self-defense.right?"



The female police officer nodded,′′Once we review the video, we'll have a conclusion. The law won't wrong an innocent person." Emily nodded. She had met this police officer before; she was a decent cop.



Seeing Emily so confident, Sabrina couldn't help but worry.



She argued, "Even if Byron didn't intend to hurt you, he's the one lying in a hospital bed now, while you're unscathed. That's excessive self-defense!"



Excessive self-defense could still lead to charges



Aiden felt relieved hearing Emily had evidence; at least the Johnson family's reputation was intact, and they had leverage to negotiate with Isaac. But Sabrina's reminder made his heart sink again.



Aiden walked over to Emily, lowering his voice,"Mrs. Reyes has a point. You should listen to me and try to sit down with the Reyes family to discuss this."



Emily knew he didn't believe her. "Byron is fine, so it can't be excessive self-defense," Emily said fearlessly.



Bianca noticed Aiden and Emily whispering, her eyes flashing.



Could Aiden still be caring about Emily?



She tugged on Hayden's sleeve, softly saying, "Hayden, what should we do? Even though Emily has evidence, Byron is seriously injured.It's clearly excessive self-defense. If she presents the evidence,it might anger the Reyes family even more. Maybe you should try to persuade Emily; she probably won't listen to me."



Hayden snorted, "She deserves it for not listening."



He even mocked Emily harshly,"Emily, I'm kindly warning you,withdraw the evidence now, or you'll face even harsher punishment."



"Save your fake kindness; I don't need it!" Emily retorted coldly. Hayden's face turned red with anger, "Aiden, you see, she doesn't appreciate it and is so arrogant. You shouldn't help her anymore."



He glared at Emily, seemingly anticipating her fate



The female police officer needed time to verify the video's authenticity.



While waiting, Emily's phone rang.



It was Aaron calling.



"Hello..."



"Emily, the patient you treated called. They said there's an issue after the herbal bath and want you to check it out. Are you available?"



Emily glanced at the female police officer, who seemed to have confirmed the video's authenticity. "I'm at the police station right now. so I can't make it. Tell them I'll come by later."



"The video is authentic, and it does show self-defense. However,we still need Byron's injury report. If his injuries are severe and the Reyes family insists on pressing charges for excessive self-defense,it could be a problem for you. I suggest you try to negotiate with them."



The female police officer knew the Reyes family's inffuence,especially since they had hired a lawyer. Seeing Emily's family not backing her up, and considering her young age, the officer was trying to help.



Emily appreciated the officer's kindness. She smiled and thanked her, "Thank you, but I won't compromise."



Emily added, "I was protecting myself. Byron's injuries are superficial; he's just pretending to be sick. You should have the injury report soon, right?"



She had seen Isaac take a call earlier, looking unusually grim. The Reyes family might be considering leaving. Emily spoke confidently. The female police officer felt Emily was naive and wanted to say more. But Isaac suddenly addressed Aiden, "Aiden, for the sake of our families' cooperation, we can let this go. But since your family injured Byron, she must apologize to him personally and get his forgiveness for this to be over."



Aiden was surprised by Isaac's sudden change of heart. But his tone was that of an elder speaking to a younger person, indicating a genuine desire to negotiate. Resolving this peacefully was best for the Johnson family.



He immediately smiled and agreed,′′Of course, Mr. Isaac Reyes.Even if you hadn't mentioned it, I would have made sure Emily apologized to Mr. Byron Reyes personally."



Aiden quickly pulled Emily over, "Say thank you to Mr. Reyes and promise to apologize to Mr. Byron Reyes later."



Bianca was shocked by this turn of events. She couldn't understand why the Reyes family suddenly relented. How could they let Emily escape punishment?



She urgently advised, "Emily, this is a good opportunity. You should thank Mr. Reyes for his generosity and agree on the term."



Isaac looked at Emily with a superior gaze, as if she were a nobody.Sabrina snorted, challenging Emily with her eyes. Everyone seemed to be pressuring her.



Emily suddenly laughed, "What, now everyone wants to decide for me? Too bad, I'm an adult and can make my own decisions. I'm not the obedient Emily I used to be."



"Emily, you're getting bolder. You think you're grown up and tough now, huh? Or have you been pretending all along?" Hayden sneered.



Aiden frowned, wanting to persuade her further. But Emily turned to the female police officer,′′Iwant to report that Byron and his men assaulted me and my friend, with Bianca and Hayden as accomplices."



"You dare report this? I'll kill you!" Sabrina, enraged,lunged at Emily. Isaac, maintaining decorum at the police station, quickly restrained Sabrina. His face was terrifyingly dark as he coldly addressed Aiden."Your Johnson family raised a fine daughter. Let's see what she can do to us."



Isaac handed the matter to the lawyer, "Handle the rest." He then left with Sabrina, without a glance at Aiden and the others.



Aiden didn't expect Emily to say that. Furious, he slapped Emily hard,"Emily, youI've disappointed me. I was considering your well-being."



The female police officer hadn't reacted before the slap landed.Emily's head was knocked to the side, blood trickling from her mouth. Clearly, Aiden had used considerable force.
###Chapter 21 He Helped, But Helped the Wrong Person
"This slap is for you, for taking me in during winter and not letting me freeze to death on the roadside."



Emily's voice was icy.



Aiden felt a pang of regret after hitting her.



But seeing Emily's indifferent expression, his heart tightened inexplicably.



His face grew even colder. "Fine, since you say that, you owe me your life. Drop the police report."



Emily shook her head.



Aiden frowned.
 Hayden shouted, "Emily, you ungrateful brat! We never stopped looking for you, and Bianca's been worrying herself sick over you.And this is how you repay her and us? We should've Iet you freeze to death out there."



His words were venomous.



Bianca tugged on Hayden's arm. "Hayden, Emily might be speaking out of anger. Don't say things like this."



She turned to Emily with a magnanimous expression. "Emily, if you want to blame someone, blame me. Pleasedon't be mad at Hayden,and don't call the cops on him. I'll take the punishment."



Despite her words, a cold glint flashed in her eyes.



She had no intention of taking the fall for Hayden.


She prided herself on being perfect and couldn't afford to be tainted by Emily's accusations. "No. if you have a problem, come at me. Bianca's health is poor. Do you really want to harm her?"



Predictably, Hayden, the fool, thought Bianca was sacrificing herself for him and immediately jumped in to defend her.



Emily,having lived through this once before, saw through it all.



She gave a cold smile and said seriously,"NoJone of you is getting away!"



At that moment, Bianca and Hayden felt a chill run down their spines.



Aiden's face darkened, ready to say something.



Just then, a man in a suit carrying a briefcase walked in.



"Excuse me, which one of you is Ms. Johnson?" 'The newcomer looked like a professional, his gaze sharp and his demeanor calm.



Emily frowned but didn't step forward immediately.



Bianca hesitated, unsure whether to step forward.



Hayden stood protectively in front of Bianca, coldly questioning the man,"Who are you? What do you want wwith Ms. Johnson?"



Aiden also watched the man warily, naturally moving to stand in front of Bianca.



They always assumed Bianca was the only one who could be addressed as Ms. Johnson and protected her.



Emily was always the one ignored.Emily felt a pang of self-pity Her heart still hurt a little.



"I'm a lawyer sent by Mr. Smith. I heard Ms. Johnson was having trouble at the police station and came to help. Which one of you is Ms. Johnson?"



The man showwed his business card.



This was the police station, and no one would dare impersonate someone sent by the Smith family.



They immediately believed him.



Bianca's heart leaped with joy. Could it be that James had found out?



Hayden and Aiden had the same thought.



Hayden patted Bianca's shoulder, reassuring and happy. "Looks like James sent his man. Bianca, you don't need to worry. Everything wwill be fine. And next time, don't try to shield me, okay?" Bianca nodded, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Hayden, I couldn't just watch you suffer. I'll remember next time."



She stepped forward confidently. "Hello, I'm Bianca. I'll leave it to you."



Aiden looked coldly at Emily. "Now that Bianca's lawyer is here,if you insist on filing a report, don't ever say we're family again. Let's assume that I never brought you back."



Emily dug her nails into her palm.



She had expected the Johnson family to call a lawyer, but she hadn't thought James would find out so quickly and personally target her for Bianca's sake.



She knew Bianca wouldn't face any real punishment. With a lawyer and no substantial evidence, and since she hadn't suffered any real harm, Bianca would get off scot-free.



She was doing this just to disgust Bianca and Hayden.Bianca had always been a thorn in her side.



"I couldn't care less!" Emily replied coldly, showing no regret.



Aiden's face darkened, and he left with Bianca and Hayden.



"Emily, are you okay?"



Shortly after Aiden and the others left, Sophia arrived at the police station with a lawyer.



Emily borrowed Sophia's lawyer.



The rest would be a battle between the lawyers.



′′T7'm fine. Let's go. I'll pay the lawyer's fee," Emily said.



Sophia looked hurt."We're friends, aren't we? Don't be so formal.He'll do his best." Emily waited for the outcome.



But the result was disappointing.



The Smith family's lawyer was indeed formidable. Though he sympathized with Emily after learning the details, he had to protect his client's interests.



In the end, Bianca and Hayden faced no punishment



Emily's mood was visibly low when she went to check on Daniel.



Even through the mask, Daniel could sense her gloom.



"How is he?" Charles asked nervously.



Emily didn't respond, focusing on diagnosing Daniel, checking his pulse on both hands, his complexion, and his tongue.



"You said he was unwell? Tell me the symptoms." Emily's voice was distant and cold.



Charles,sensing Emily's strange mood, was unusually polite.
"Doctor, he was in pain during the herbal bath. The water turned black. I'm worried..."



"That's normal. I mentioned during the consultation that he would be detoxing. Pain is expected. Next time, don't waste my time unless it's necessary!" Emily said bluntly.



Last time, Emily's attitude wasn't warm, but it wasn't as cold as this time.



Charles frowned.



Daniel, worried Charles might upset Emily, spoke in a cool, magnetic voice. "Sorry, my friend was overly concerned. I feel much better...Your skills are indeed remarkable!"



He almost caled her by her real name. Daniel's eyes were deep, thinking about the lawyer he had sent



This all started when Charles called Aaron, worried about Daniel's condition.



Aaron revealed Emily was dealing with something at the police station.



Daniel,knowing Emily's identity, sent a lawyer directly



The lawyer hadn't reported back yet, but Emily had come here first.



"Continue the herbal baths. As for my skills, if I take on a case, I can cure the patient, as long as you people cooperate! And..."
Emily's gaze fell on Charles. "Don't cause unnecessary trouble!"



Charles knew she was referring to him and stayed silent.



Emily packed her medical kit, ready to leave. Her phone rang. Seeing the number, her face darkened.



"Mr. Johnson, what is it?" She lowered her voice, changing her tone.



On the other end, Eli, just back from a business trip and furious about Emily's actions, called her. Her first words nearly made him explode.



"You ungrateful brat, I'm your father! What did you call me?"



Eli's voice was loud, piercing through the phone, heard by Charles and Daniel.



Emily walked out, her voice icy.′′Ifyou're calling to scold me, I'm hanging up!"
###Chapter 22 He Grabs Her Weak Spot,Shameless
"You..." Eli almost lost it, ready to start cursing.



But remembering his goal, he held back and said in a deep voice,"I heard you haven't been home for two nights. Now that I'm back from my business trip, you need to come home right now."



Even if he wanted to discipline her, he had to get her back first.



Emily knew exactly what Eli was up to.



Her tone was icy, "Since you know I don't live at the Johnson Villa anymore,why do you think I'd listen to you and go back there?"



She had long been disappointed with the Johnson family



If she were miserable, those who made her miserable wouldn't have it easy either. Eli was almost furious.


Bianca, standing beside him, kept trying to calm him down.



Looking at the sensible Bianca and then thinking of Emily, he felt even more disappointed.



"I recently got some news. I heard that the person who took you in years ago has a grandson in an orphanage. If you want to know more,you have to come home today."



Eli was puzzled by Emily's sudden change in behavior. He suspected that her previous obedience was just an act. He wanted to investigate her past to see if she had any connections that could affect the Johnson family.



He found out that when Emily was about seven or eight, she was taken in by a homeless man who collected trash for a year. Fuarther investigation revealed that the man had a grandson in an orphanage.



Emily had experienced the harshness of life at a young age,which made her yearn for warmth even more.



The love she had shown the Johnson family was because she had once received it herself.



It was a rare period of warmth in her childhood.



"Fine, I'll 'come back!" Emily thought of the kind Elijah,and her cold heart softened a bit. She agreed to Eli's demand.



"You have half an hour. Hurry back!"



Eli got the confirmation he wanted, but instead of feeling happy,he felt uneasy.



Why did it seem like Emily valued a homeless man more than her own family?



What an ungrateful person! Emily hung up the phone, her face dark as she drove back.



Charles, watching Emily leave, was shocked.



"The doctor always acts so high and mighty with us, but who knew she had a father like that? It seems no one has it easy in this world," Charles shook his head, full of emotion.



Daniel glanced at Charles.



Charles immediately understood.



"This time, it was my fault. I was just worried and anxious. When you have high hopes, you don't want to be disappointed. Daniel, I hope you're doing well."



The two were good friends, having grown up together, sharing a deep bond.


He had a stepmother, and then even his biological father would act like a stepfather. He was almost killed by his stepmother back then. Despite Daniel's seemingly indifferent nature, he was a loyal friend.



If it hadn't been for Daniel's intervention, which changed his fate and led his grandfather to take over his upbringing, he might not have grown up well.



Daniel looked at him deeply, his voice hoarse, "Don't let it happen again."



′′Ipromise!" Charles immediately beamed.



But Daniel frowned, his face serious.



If he remembered correctly, the Johnson family's daughter was supposed to be frail and much loved by her family.



Could the rumors be wrong? Did Eli not truly care for this daughter?



But he wasn't surprised by this guess In their circle, some genuinely loved their children,but many prioritized interests. Daughters were often groomed for future alliances. The Johnson family's daughter had been frail since childhood, making it more difficult for her family to benefit from her marriage. Eli's indifference was understandable.



Still, Daniel felt a moment of unease.



He called his assistant,"Look into the relationship between the Johnson family's daughter and the rest of the family."



This wasn't a secret.



But Daniel had never paid attention to such matters, so he didn't know.



If it weren't for his photographic memory, he wouldn't even know who Bianca was



The assistant quickly sent over the information. Daniel read it, his long fingers trembling slightly as he held the documents.



He hadn't known that the Johnson family had not one, but two daughters.



One was Bianca, the other was Emily.



From Eli's attitude, the doctor must be Emily.



But.the Emily in the documents seemed like a completely different person from the one he knew.



His fingers tapped on Emily's name, his eyes deepening, like they held an endless vortex, mysterious and profound.



Daniel felt utterly speechless.



He might have made a rookie mistake. Thinking of this, Daniel picked up his phone, about to call his lawyer.



But the lawyer called first.



"Mr. Smith, everything has been handled..."



The lawyer briefly reported the situation and the final outcome to Daniel.



Daniel,usually composed and indifferent, rarely showed such a conflicted expression.



At this moment, his brows were furrowed, looking somewhat troubled, with a hint of frustration at the corners of his mouth.



Not only had he not helped, but he seemed to have made things worse.



But judging by Emily's recent behavior, she didn't seem to hold it against him. Was it because she was too magnanimous, or did she not know the lawyer was his?



Suppressing his emotions, he asked the lawyer for more details.



The lawyer, sensing the tension even over the phone, answered carefully, afraid of making any mistakes.



"This matter ends here. If anyone asks any question, either keep silent or respond, 'I was sent by Mr. Smith.' Don't saya word more.understand?"



Daniel's words were more of a threat than a question



The lawyer didn't understand why Daniel was so insistent.



But he knew Daniel had his reasons and immediately agreed,"Understood, Mr. Smith."



And so, this became a perfect misunderstanding between Emily and Daniel. She assumed James was standing up for Bianca, making her even more disappointed in him.



At this moment, she was already standing at the entrance of the Johnson Villa.



The butler, seeing her return, was delighted but quickly hid his emotions, saying, "Ms. Emily Johnson, you're back. Everyone's waiting for you."



The butler had never treated her poorly despite the Johnson family's disdain for her. Emily was grateful and nodded warmly,"Thank you, Gabriel. I'll go in now."



She calmly walked up the steps and into the living room.



Inside, Eli and the others, having heard her arrival, wore serious expressions, the atmosphere tense.



The only one unaffected seemed to be Bianca. She was still sweetly comforting Eli, "Dad, Emily misunderstood my relationship with James and has always been jealous of the love you and Mom have for me. Please don't be too harsh on her, okay?"



Eli's stern face softened immediately at Bianca's words. "Alright alright, you're too kind. As long as she admits her mistakes and changes, I won't make things difficult for her."



Emily walked in just in time to hear this.



She laughed mockingly,′′Idid nothing wrong, so what is there to change?"
###Chapter 23 The Johnson Family, I Don't Need It Anymore
"You actually came back. I thought you were determined to die out there!"



Eli had promised himself he'd stay calm. but the second he saw Emily,hecouldn't help but lose it.



It wasn't entirely Emily's fault.



Emily had a way of pushing his buttons, even when she wasn't trying.



Emily strolled in, her words sharp enough to rile anyone up. "Sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm still kicking."



"You..."



"Dad,you promised you'd stay calm!" Bianca jumped in, her innocent eyes pleading with Eli. fll took a deep breath. trying to keep his anger in check.



Cleo stood up right away, her vofce gentle as she tried to mediate."Emily, don't blame your father. He's just worried about you. Your reputation was already bad. and now you've ticked off the Reyes family. It's only gonna get worse. And you should know.ever if you've been away for years. that our families' businesses depend on cooperation. We can't afford to offend them."



Emily looked at Cleo's hypocritical face.



She remembered the cold, heartless words Cleo had said to her in her past life,right before she died.



The memory of that bone-chilling coldness made her shiver.



"You all know exactly how my reputation got trashed!" Emily shot back sarcastically.



"Of course, it's because you were always causing trouble and targeting Bianca. That's why your reputation is what it is. Now what? Are you blaming Bianca and everyone else now?" Hayden snapped, his anger flaring as he saw Bianca's sad face.



Emily couldn't be bothered to respond to Hayden.


After all, he was as good as dead to her.


Emily looked coldly at Eli. "Just get to the point.



She was here to find out about Elijah's grandson.


Eli was displeased with Emily's indifference and commanded, "You messed up big time. You're gonna take the gifts we've prepared and go apologize to Byron at the Reyes Villa. Unless he forgives you, the Johnson family will disown you!"



He even added a threat.


In the past, he didn't even need to say such things. A look of disappointment or anger from him was enough to make Emily,desperate for family affection, immediately cave. But this time, Eli was going to be disappointed.



"Apologize? Not happening. I am sure you know the truth and that I did nothing wrong!" Emily said coldly.



"If you don't apologize, then get out of the Johnson family. I don't want a daughter like you," Eli said harshly, determined to scare Emily into submission.



Bianca tried to play the good cop. "Emily, no, please apologize to Dad. He's justangry. Promise to apologize to Byron!"



Emily suddenly looked at Bianca and spoke softly, "Wouldn't it suit you perfectly if I left the Johnson family? Why are you still keeping this up?"



"Emily,how can you think that of me? I..."



Bianca looked heartbroken, as if she was about to faint from the shock. "Bianca..." The Johnson family members immediately surrounded her, offering comfort and concern.



Cleo glared at Emily, her eyes cold and filled with hatred.



Emily clenched her fists, her face expressionless.



This was Cleo's true nature.



She had never wanted Emily to be born. If it weren't for the need for umbilical cord blood, she wouldn't have had Emily, and she had nearly died giving birth to her!



Now, just a few truthful words, and Bianca's act of being sick made Cleo resent her.



Cleo suddenly stepped forward and slapped Emily across the face.



Emily could have dodged. But she didn't.



She had already repaid Cleo with her life in her past life. This slap was just to sever the last bit of familial bond in this life.



"This slap is to repay the blood ties. I don't need the Johnson family anymore!" Emily said firmly.



Cleo met Emily's gaze.


She felt an inexplicable tremor in her heart.



She was her mother; how could Emily say such heartless words?


Bianca was indeed more considerate.



Eli sneered, "Repay? Can you ever repay enough? Let's not even talk about the danger of giving birth to you. Just think about everything the Johnson family has provided for you. If you have any backbone,repay all of that first, then talk about leaving the Johnson family." Emily met Eli's gaze without a hint of guilt."What has the Johnson family really given me over the years, Father? Can you list it out? If you can, I'll repay it."



"Fine, let's list it out. Every child in the Johnson family gets a monthly allowance of ten thousand dollars until they turn eighteen..."



"I didn't get that!" Emily interrupted Eli.



She knew Bianca got that money, and even more.



When Emily returned to the Johnson family, Aiden was already an adult, and Bianca received several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars in pocket money each month. Then it was Chase,Hayden,Finn...



But not her.



She didn't care about their money, only about family affection.
Having a safe haven was enough for her, so she never complained.
But later. even her tuition and other expenses were never covered.
She earned it all through scholarships and competitions.



Otherwise, how could she have so many skills?



"How could you not get it? Don't lie," Eli sneered.



He turned to Cleo. "Did you transfer Emily's allowance? Show the transfer records, and let's see how she denies it."



Cleo's eyes flickered. "I thought you gave it to her. I didn't transfer anything."



Eli's confident expression faltered. He looked at Aiden, then at Hayden..



They both shook their heads.



Eli was about to ask the accountant, but Emily spoke first. "You don't need to ask. There was nothing. Not even my tuition or activity fees were covered. I earned it all through scholarships and competitions. As for the place I lived, a small studio, do you want to charge me for that, too? If so,I don't mind calculating the Tosses I incurred for Bianca...""Emily, don't drag Bianca into this. Even if you didn't get the money, you still grew up in the Johnson Villa, not starving or freezing outside," Aiden interrupted.worried about Bianca's health.


Emily didn't want to argue with these people.



She said coldly, "Are you sure you won't tell me about Elijah's grandson?"



"You think you can get that information without apologizing?Dream on! Didn't you say you don't need the Johnson family? Then leave now. Without our protection, let's see how the Reyes family deals with you. Don't come crying back later!"



Eli was furious, his words harsh.


"Fine! But the one who will regret it won't be me!" Emily's cold.gaze swept over everyone present. She took one last look at the Johnson Villa and walked away decisively.



Her final words were not a threat, but a warning.



Eli snorted, not taking Emily's words seriously.



But shortly after Emily left, Isaac and Sabrina arrived at the Johnson Villa, carrying Byron.



Isaac spoke as soon as he arrived, "Eli, Byron is in this state now.
You need to give us an explanation. Where's Emily? Bring her out!"
###Chapter 24 The Scene of Meeting Again, Too Awkward
Emily had just gotten home when her phone rang. It was Eli.



"Emily, what the hell did you do to Byron? He's in serious pain, but the hospital can't find anything wrong. You need to come back and fix this. It's a good chance to fix the situation. Don't blow it."



The Reyes family had come knocking sooner than she thought.



But she knew Eli would milk the situation, knowing the Reyes family would do anything for Byron.



Whatever he stood to gain, it had nothing to do with her.



He still kept up his arrogant attitude with her.


 
"I told you, I'm not the one who's gonna regret this!" Emily hung up and blocked his number.



To stop other Johnson family members from calling, she blackisted them,too.



After that, she hacked into Eli's phone to check his recent contacts related to the orphanage.



Eli probably thought she didn't have the skills, so he didn't bother hiding his communications. She quickly found out which orphanage the child was in.



She called the orphanage director, pretending to be Eli, and soon got the child's basic info.



After a good night's sleep, Emily headed to the orphanage the next day.



When the director brought out Elijah's grandson, Emily's cold heart softened, and her eyes welled up at the familiar face. The kid was supposed to be six but looked more like four or five.



He was thin and had some bruises.



Emily knew that in a place like this, he might have been bullied by other kids.



"Liam, how about you come with me?" Emily had decided to adopt Liam, so she gently asked for his opinion.



She was found by the Johnson family when she was almost thirteen.



Elijah had passed away shortly after she returned to the Johnson Villa, and Liam had been sent to the orphanage not long after Elijah's death.



The director said that because Liam was sick, almost no one wanted to adopt him.



The director looked at Emily with concern,′′It′Sgreat if you want to adopt Liam, but you're only eighteen, which doesn't meet the adoption criteria. Maybe you could get your family to help with the process, and then you could adopt Liam."



The director was a kind person, hoping Liam would find a loving home.



Seeing Emily's expression when she looked at Liam, he believed Liam wouldn't suffer if he went with her.



Emily frowned.



Asking Eli and Cleo for help with the process was out of the question.



Even if they were willing, she wouldn't risk it.



Liam could become a pawn for them to manipulate her.


 
But... Seeing Liam's hopeful eyes, Emily couldn't ignore Elijah's descendant.



She repaid kindness with kindness and returned harm with harm.



"Mr. Director, how about this? I'll find a way to meet the adoption requirements. In the meantime, if anyone wants to adopt Liam,could you call me first?"



Emily feared Eli might cause trouble. The Johnson Group's chairman had significant influence, and she worried the director might not withstand the pressure.



The director saw Emily's genuine desire to adopt Liam and nodded."Sure."



Emily pulled Liam over and gave him a quick check-up, her brows furrowing.



She knew Liam's health was poor, but it was worse than she expected. The director said he was on medication, but it was clearly not the right treatment. He looked okay on the outside, but his condition was deteriorating internally.



Emily thought for a moment and decided to leave the orphanage to get the right medicine, making pills for Liam to take daily.



When she said goodbye to Liam, he suddenly grabbed her clothes.



"Liam, be'good. I don't want to leave you either, but I need to complete the adoption process. Can youI wait for me for a few days?" Emily said patiently.



Liam nodded, then shook his head.



Emily frowned, "You nodded to agree, but why did you shake your head?"



She realized he hadn't spoken a word since she met him.



But her check-up didn't reveal any throat issues. Could it be psychological? Emily's thoughts grew more complex.



Liam seemed anxious and dragged her to the backyard.



Then, Emily saw Liam bring out a trembling, emaciated puppy.



He looked at her with pleading eyes.



At the same time, the puppy looked at Emily with the same pitiful eyes.



Emily's heart softened. They reminded her of herself back then.



"Do you want me to take care of it?" Emily asked gently.



Liam nodded immediately.



So Emily left the orphanage with a puppy in her arms.


 
The puppy seemed to sense Emily's kindness and stoppedtrembling.


Back at Serenity Grove, she put the puppy down at the door.



She remembered hearing that a newly adopted puppy should learn to recognize its home, not wander off, and not make a mess. It should wipe itsbutt on the grass at the door.



Maybe because she had been reborn, she believed in these superstitions a bit.



So she followed through.



She picked a leaf from the door, held the puppy, and symbolically wiped its butt with the leaf.



It was at this moment that Emily met Daniel again.



Hearing a cough, she looked up and met his deep eyes. His eyes were like whirlpools, easy to get lost in.



"Mr. Smith, what a coincidence. You look well. The medicine..." She almost said it, but quickly realized she wasn't wearing a mask. To him, she was just the person he met at the hospital



She almost blew her cover.



Daniel knew what she was about to say, but didn't expose her.



He felt he had caused trouble at the police station and wanted to make amends, so he ended up here.



But Emily's current situation...



"Yes, thanks to your help, I'm recovering well!" Daniel said,covering his mouth with a fist to hide his smile.



Emily saw his restrained smile and felt less embarrassed. Though his presence was hard to ignore, she felt more composed than at their first meeting.



"Mr. Smith, you might not know, but this unique method makes the puppy obedient and protective!" She said, quickly wiping the puppy's butt before picking it up to open the door.



Thinking about Daniel at the door, she considered inviting him in."Mr.Smith,would you like to come in?"



Daniel frowned.



Was she so unguarded with strangers?



Knowing she had just moved in and had no servants, he thought it was inappropriate to visit.



Seeing she wasn't affected by the Johnson family, he felt relieved and said;′′NO, thank you. I'll visit another time."



Emily thought he was being polite. Their meeting here was just a coincidence, so she didn't insist.



She took the puppy inside and ordered a dog bed and food online.



After finishing everything,she called Aaron,′′Ineed to pick up some medicine from the pharmacy. Can you prepare these ingredients for me?′′



"Sure!"



Emily made arrangements and drove to the pharmacy.



When she arrived, she saw a crowd at the pharmacy door.



Emily frowned and hurried over, hearing the crowd's discussions.

###Chapter 25 If She Treated The Patient, Then It's Fine
"Where's the doctor on duty? This person just fainted. We shouldn't move her around too much; it might make things worse."



"Since her collapse in the pharmacy. she probably knew she wasn't feeling well. She doesn't look very old... I hope it's not serious."



Emily's instincts kicked in as soon as she heard there was a patient.She pushed through the crowd to get inside.



"Excuse me, I'm a doctor!"



As soon as Emily shouted, people instinctively made way for her.



Emily quickly knelt down to examine the patient.



At first glance, she recognized the person lying on the ground Was Wer aunr.



In her previou's lfe, knowing she wasn't favored in the Johnson family, basically all the other relatives avoided her.



But this aunt, despite her own difficult life. always tried to help Emily when Emily frst returned to the Johnson family.even though she was struggling financially herself. Even when she bad no money herself,she found ways to give Emily some.



However, this kind-hearted aunt was bullied by her husbands family, and her husband had a young mistress.



The mistress even schemed to marry the son of Emily's aunt, and when he refused, he was falsely accused of rape and sent to prison.Emily's aunt ran around begging for help for her son, while her daughter was kidnapped by the mistress.



Her aunt went mad searching for her daughter and eventually died in a car accident.



In her previous life, around this time, her aunt had come to ask Eliatid the cihers for help. but Eitily didn't know the specifics.



tomily Wad pose retarned home whert her aunt was leaving.When Emily asked her aune ff she needed help, she just shook her head arid said ie was nothing. In the end. Emily gave her aunt the little money she had. and the next time she heard about her aunt. it was news of her death.



Emily checked her aunt and found she had low blood sugar.



She quickly administered two injections without anyone noticing.



Soon,her aunt should wake up-



The only tricky part was the injuries on her aunt's body.



"Someone, help move her to the back room and give her some glucose. She's having a low blood sugar episode!" Emily called out to the pharmacy staff.



Upon hearing it was low blood sugar, the staff, who knew Emily, quickly helped move her aunt to the back.



The onlookers, seeing the patient being taken to the back, started to question Emily's ability.



"Hey, are you sure she has low blood sugar? She looked pretty bad.You'd better not make things worse."



"Yeah,you don't look very old. What kind of medical skills could you have? You probably jst know a bit about medicine and common illnesses, and now you're claiming to be a doctor!"



"Emily, what are you doing here?"



Just as people were questioning Emily's medical skills, a few girls walked in.



Among them was Bianca, always the center of attention.



The one speaking was Lily, who was always by Bianca's side. Bianca also heard the discussions around her, but she didn't know the person being questioned was Emily.



Her eyes flashed, and she quickly said, "Emíly, I know you mean well, but this is too reckless. You should call an ambulance. You only learned a bit about medicine, you don't have a medical license,how can you dare to treat someone?"



"You don't have a medical license, and you dare to treat someone,you're practically trying to kill them. People likeyou who pretend to know what they're doing should be reported to the police."



Lily said, pulling out her phone to call the police.



Those who had already questioned Emily now started to criticize her.



"This is just irresponsible, it's too much."



"Exactly, call 911 immediately." "Young lady, you have no sense of responsibility; you just want to show off, but you should know your place."



Bianca quickly added, "Everyone, calm down. Emily didn't mean any harm; she's just young and didn't think it through. I've already called 911, and I know a bit about medicine too. I'm about to participate in the upcoming medical competition. Let me check on the patient and see if I can help."



People were skeptical about Bianca's medical knowledge, as she wasn't much older than Emily. But hearing she was participating in a medical competition, they thought her skills must be decent. The criticism lessened.



Lily and Bianca took the opportunity to head to the back room. The crowd also wanted to go in and see. Emily quickly blocked their way. Bianca clearly wanted to set her up, and even if she found out her aunt was fine, Bianca would still try to smear her reputation.



"Emily, this is a matter of life and death. Even if you're upset with me, can you put personal grievances aside?" Bianca said urgently.



Lily also reached out to push Emily, "Emily, move aside. Bianca is trying to help you. If you really harm someone, you won't be able to pay for it with your life!"


"I thought this young lady had a good heart, but now it seems she's just trying to show off. Maybe there are cameras around? Her sister is trying to save someone, and she's blocking the way!"



"Young lady, this is a matter of life and death.If you don't move,you'll be legally responsible."



"Emily, move aside!" Bianca said, stomping her foot anxiously.



"Hold on! You all are just listening to their one-sided story. You can see I don't get along with them, so how can you be sure they're telling the truth?" Emily said, sarcastically glancing at the two.


"Emily, not long ago, youI beat someone to the hospital just because they were close to me. Now you're ignoring a patient to spite me."



Bianca gritted her teeth, deliberately smearing Emily's reputation. A person who beat someone to the hospital, how could they save someone? Thecrowd's attitude towards Emily changed. Bianca saw the change and quíckly said, "For the patient's sake, I can't let you continue. Everyone, help me move her aside, and III check on the patient."



The crowd, influenced by Bianca, started to move towards Emily.



"What's going on? Dr. Ryan, the doctor on duty, is here."



The pharmacy had a renowned doctor, known to the locals. He was a retired doctor from Evergreen Hospital, and people even came from afar to see him. Hearing Dr. Floyd Ryanwas back,everyone stopped.



Bianca knew about Floyd. She came here intending to visit him,hoping to impress him with her medical talent. She quickly approached him, "Dr. Ryan, hello, I'm Bianca from Celestial University."



Then she quickly explained the situation to Floyd,′′I′m worried Emily is being reckless. This is a matter of life and death. Now that you're here, could you please check on the patient?" Everyone agreed with Bianca. They thought she was genuinely concerned about the patient.



Floyd listened to Bianca and thought someone was being reckless.He snorted, "This is absurd! Are you also a Johnson?"



'The same surname as a renowned doctor.



Bianca didn't understand why Floyd used "also," but she thought he remembered her name.



"Yes, Dr. Ryan, I'm Bianca Johnson!" She suppressed her excitement and reported her name.



Floyd nodded and prepared to check on the patient.


"Dr. Ryan!" At that moment, Emily locked eyes with Floyd, who was walking towards the back room. She nodded calmly in greeting



Floyd was stunned. Then he was surprised, almost called out Emily's name. But under Emily's gaze, he stopped and asked,"Did you treat the patient?"



"Dr. Ryan, it was her. She only knows a bit about medicine and dared to treat the patient. She doesn't have a medical license;she's just showing off."



Floyd glared coldly at Lily. Then he looked at Emily and smiled. "If you treated the patient, I don't need to check. The patient is fine!"



Everyone was stunned. The air seemed to freeze. Bianca's smile stiffened, and she blurted out, "Dr. Ryan, are you sure?"
###Chapter 26 She Is a Professional


"Watch your words. You're a doctor too, right? You should know better than to judge someone by appearances. Just because you don't have the skills doesn't mean others don't!"



Floyd shot back, defending Emily without hesitation.



He hadn't really noticed Bianca's demeanor before, but now he saw her sharp, calculating eyes. She seemed cold and preoccupied.



Bianca regretted losing her cool and letting Floyd hear her outburst.



She quickly tried to backtrack,′′Dr. Ryan, you got me wrong. That's not what I meant. Emily's my sister, and I've never seen her study medicine. She only mentioned learning a bit from a random doctor.so I was just surprised and confused!"



If there was a mistake, it was Emily's fault for keeping secrets.



She looked at Floyd with a pitiful expression. Usually, this tactic worked well.



But Floyd, who had seen countless people and could read faces, saw right through her.



He looked stern, "You, as her sister, dont care about her and even doubt her? You don't seem like sisters, more like enemies! Your sister is just being modest, don't you understand?"



After scolding Bianca, he turned to Emily with a kind smile, "Emily what was the patient's condition? Was it a tough case?"



Emily shook her head, "The patient's condition was a bit complicated. I handled the hypoglycemia, but there are other minor issues that need medication."



The injuries on her aunt were from domestic violence. With memories from her past life, she couldn't reveal this to outsiders.



In her previous life, she was too busy to notice, and her aunt hid it to avoid burdening her. By the time she visited, her aunt had already passed away. Even though she avenged her in her past life, she hoped to ensure her aunt and her children were well in this life, not just holding her aunt's ashes.



"I think you're just not skilled enough. that's why you're saying this.Hypoglycemia can be treated with some sugar water. It shouldn't take this long, and the patient hasn't moved. If you can't treat her,you should wait for Dr. Ryan. It's not good to overstep your bounds."



Lily, who didn't study medicine, wasn't afraid of angering Floyd.



So,she said what Bianca couldn't.



Floyd, though old, had sharp, bright eyes. He was about to speak when...



"Emily..."



A pharmacy employee helped Emily's aunt, Violette,out.She looked much better. Some of the onlookers who hadn't left saw her walking out fine and started praising Emily's medical skills.



"Violette!"



The first to speak wasn't Emily. Bianca rushed over to hold Violette's hand, showing concern, "Violette, why didIn't you come to our house when you arrived in Silverlight City? And you were unwell, Emily knew about it, but you hid it from me. Is it because I'm weak, so you didn't want to worry me? Violette, now that you have Emily, are you neglecting me?"



Bianca's tone was almost playful.



She subtly hinted that Emily could treat Violette so accurately because she already knew her condition,



Lily chimed in,′′Iknew it. How impressive could she be? Turns out they know each other. Dr. Ryan, don't be fooled by her tricks. They might have staged this while you were away!"



Floyd frowned. Bianca's eyes flashed with a smile.



She had heard that Floyd couldn't tolerate deceit. Seeing him frown,he probably felt manipulated.



She wanted to see how Emily would win Floyd's favor now.



"No, I didn't even know I fainted. Emily didn't know I was here either. She's really good!" Violette defended Emily, sensing Lily's mockery.



Violette's anxious explanations only made things worse.



Emily patted Violette's shoulder reassuringly, "Violette, it's okay.Don't mind what she says."



Then she glared coldly at Lily,′′Idon't need to prove my medical skills to you. You better shut up, or I might not be able to hold back from hitting you!"



"You..." Lily felt a sudden fear and couldn't say another word. Bianca quickly stepped ín front of Lily, "Emily, Lily was just concerned for everyone. This is a pharmacy. and it should be a professional doctor treating patients. If you break the rules,who will dare to come here in the future?"



"Who said Emily isn't a professional?" Floyd finally spoke up for Emily, "She works here. Treating patients is her job."


He winked at Emily.



Usually, Emily didn't treat patients often. If he could get her to work here, even once a month, he could learn a lot.



Emily used to focus solely on the Johnson family, solving their problems. She didn't have the time to accept his offer.



Seeing Floyd's intentions, she smiled wryly, "Yes, I work here now."



This was her indirect agreement to Floyd's request.


Floyd laughed heartily, "With your help, my job will be much easier."



Floyd's admiration for Emily was clear to Bianca. She feared Emily might soon become Floyd's student.



Jealouas and furious, she wanted to say something.



But Floyd spoke first, "What are you doing here if you're not a patient? Leave. The pharmacy doesn't welcome troublemakers. Go,go,go!"



He directly ordered them out.



Bianca felt humiliated but had to maintain a polite facade, "Dr.Ryan,we won't disturb you any longer. May I consult you on medical matters another time?"



Floyd waved her off,′′Don't you have a teacher? Why come to me?Are you saying you're better than your teacher?"



′′NO,o, no... I just thought if my teacher is busy..." Bianca's face turned pale.



She needed her teacher's guidance and couldn't afford to offend him.



Floyd snorted, "Are you saying I'm not busy? I'm much busier than your teacher!"



Bianca was once again rebuked by Floyd.



She.didn't dare say another word, fearing more mistakes.



Finally, she turned to Violette, "Violette, you're not well. Why not come to the Johnson Villa to rest?"



"Violette, you can stay with me!" Emily didn't want Violette to go to the Johnson Villa and be humiliated. She guessed Violette needed Eli's help



Violette patted Emily's hand reassuringly,′′Iknow about your situation. Don't worry, I'll talk to your parents and get some answers for you."



She then looked at Bianca, her expression cold, "Let's go together."



She had noticed Bianca's subtle jabs at Emily.



It had been a while since they last met, and she didn't realize how much Bianca had changed until now.



Maybe the problem lay with Eli and Cleo.



Emily's eyes reddened.



Violette was thinking of her.



It was okay. Now that she had the ability, she could help Violette when needed.



Emily didn't stop Violette from going to the Johnson Villa,watching as Bianca led her away.
 "Emily,you promised to come here for consultations!" Floyd quickly reminded het.



He was afraid that she might change her mind.


Emily smiled, "Don't worry, I won't go back on my word."



"Dr. Ryan; I have a prescription that needs your expertise!" A bold voice called from the door.



Emily looked at the newcomer,"It's you?"
###Chapter 27 The Cliché


"Do you know me?"



Emily's sudden question made the newcomer look puzzIed.


"No, I don't. I thought you wwere someone else!"



Emily quickly corrected herself.



Charles wasn't too surprised. In fact, the corner of his mouth curled up in a barely noticeable sneer.



A man with his background and looks hadI plenty of women wanting to know him.



All sorts of tricks!



He was too lazy to give any attention to such a cliché pick-up line.
Emily noticed Charles's disdainful glance.



She knew he misunderstood, but didn't bother to explain,
awkwardly touching her nose



She wasn't wearing her mask now, and she wasn't in her doctor persona, so her earlier words did seem abrupt.



Her eyes swept over the prescription Charles handed over,immediately meeting his sharp gaze.



'Who is this woman?



'Could she be related to the woman Daniel dealt with? Is she here to gather information?



"Dr. Ryan, please take a closer look at this in private," Charles reminded, his eyes warily fixed on Emily.



Floyd,who was from Emerald City and had once examined Daniel,recognized the prescription as Daniel's as soon as Charles handed it
 to him.



He had heard someone could treat Daniel and was curious about the prescription.



Floyd quickly took the prescription to examine it, not avoiding Emily,and didn't catch Charles's hint.



"Brilliant! This prescription is very beneficial for the patient's condition. If I'm not mistaken, is there something else to assist it?"



Floyd's eyes lit up at the sight of a good prescription.



Only such a pure-hearted doctor could reach a certain level of expertise.



Charles felt relieved hearing Floyd's words. It seemed the prescription could indeed treat Daniel.



"Yes, but the person said it requires acupuncture sessions and some rare herbs. Besides asking you to check the prescription, I also wanted to see if you have those herbs."



Charles and his people always had backup plans


Although Emily had said she could help find the herbs, he still had others looking, just in case.



It seemed the required herbs were quite rare



Floyd asked for the names of the herbs, bout wasn't sure if he had them on hand.



′′I2'm missing two of the herbs you mentioned. You must have asked around; these two are hard to find," Floyd said honestly.



He thought for a moment and handed the prescription to Emily.


He didn't even give Charles a chance to react.



"Emily, can you deduce the patient's condition from the prescription and see if the two herbs can be substituted?"



Floyd was doing this for Daniel's sake.



Emily took the prescription.


Seeing the handwriting, she was speechless.



So it was herprescription, and Charles didn't trust it.



Emily looked at Charles with a half-smile,′′Iyou don't trust it,
don't treat him. He only has three months left to live anyway!"



For a moment, her eyes seemed to overlap with those of the masked doctor.



Even her words were so infuriating.



But that doctor was truly skilled. This girl in front of him looked barely of age. She might not even understand the prescription, yet she dared to speak so boldly.



Floyd, being old, had developed a soft spot. How could he show the prescription to such a little girl?



Moreover,criticizing him was one thing, but saying such things about Daniel was unacceptable!



Charles's face turned cold as he snatched the prescription from Emily's hand. "You have no skills and dare to speak so boldly. This prescription was written by a very skilled doctor, which is beyond your understanding. Dr. Ryan, this is inappropriate!"



His last sentence was directed at Floyd, his face showing displeasure.



If it weren't for the respect he had for Floyd, his tone would have been harsher.


 
Floyd felt a bit embarrassed.He had been thinking of Daniel's well-being,but the prescription indeed shouldn't have been...



"Sorry, I was out of line," Floyd apologized directly, not being a stubborn old man.



Charles didn't hold a grudge.



Since the prescription was fine, he bid farewell, but not before asking Floyd to keep an eye out for the two herbs.



Of course, before leaving, he didn't forget to give Emily a hard glare.



Back home, Charles couldn't help but complain to Daniel.



"You wouldn't believe how rude that woman was. She even cursed you. If it were the old me, I would have taught her a lesson!"



Charles huffed. His temper had mellowed, and this wasn't Emerald City.



He was also trying to accumulate good karma for Daniel, hoping he would recover soon.



Daniel raised an eyebrow, waiting for Charles to finish his rant, then spoke calmly."So, you're arguing with a barely adult girl."



Mentioning the girl, Emily's face flashed in his mind.



"Does that girl know Floyd?"



For Floyd to show her the prescription, her medical skills must be decent. Could it be a coincidence?



Charles slapped his forehead,′′Iwas so mad I forgot to ask her name. Floyd called her Emily. But it doesn't matter. I suspect she's with the woman you dealt with last time, so I had someone follow her immediately!"



"Call them off!" Daniel's voice suddenly rose, brooking no argument.



"What?" Charles didn't understand.



Daniel rubbed his temples, feeling a bit helpless.



He already owed her once, and now, by coincidence, he met her again.



Daniel's eyes were deep and unreadable."Call your people off. Don't provoke her again, and show respect if you see her."



Charles finally understood.



He looked at Daniel suspiciously, even with a hint of surprise, "You know that woman? Who is she? It's the first time I've seen you care about a girl. Though she's a bit skinny, she's indeed beautiful. She'll be a real beauty when she grows up."



As soon as he finished speaking, he met Daniel's cold gaze. He felt a chill.



Charles was even more surprised.



What kind of skills did Emily have to make Daniel care so much?



He quickly made a zipping motion with his mouth,""Iwon't mention it again!"



Daniel finally withdrew his gaze.



He looked at the time and said in a deep voice, "You should go."



Charles was speechless.



It was the first time Daniel had directly asked him to leave.



But facing Daniel's gaze, he had no choice but to comply.



Daniel didn't explain. Emily had a dog at home now and hadn't hired a housekeeper yet.She was probably coming back around this time.



Since she had just argued with Charles, he didn't want them to run into each other.



It wouldn't be good if he got caught in the crossfire.



"Mr. Smith, here's the dog you asked for," the butler said, bringing in a young Border Collie.



The Border Collie, usually smart and obedient, trembled as soon as it reached Daniel's feet, perhaps intimidated by his strong presence.



The butler felt a bit awkward, "Maybe the dog isn't used to it yet.It'll get better as it grows."



Daniel's expression remained indifferent



"Okay," he said, showing no sign of liking the dog. But then he picked up a dog care manual and started reading.



The butler was speechless.



Why did he feel a bit scared?



This poisoning seemed to have affected Daniel's mind.
###Chapter 28 You Don't Smell Like a Dog


As Daniel had predicted, after buying the medicine, Emily returned to Serenity Grove.



She didn't know much about taking care of a dog. so she looked it up online.



Dogs needed to be walked.



After finishing some materials for her major change and some published papers, she took the dog out for a walk.



Then...


"Hey, fancy seeing you here!"



It was Daniel speaking.


He seemed to be in better spirits, less cold and more approachable. Emily's gaze fell on the dog he was holding, which seemed to be trembling.



"Yeah, what a coincidence. Are you walking your dog too? Did you just get it?" Emily nodded, but her question was unexpected.



Daniel seemed momentarily flustered under her gaze.



He tightened his grip on the leash and asked, "How did you figure that out?"



He didn't deny it, and he didn't confirm it either..



"I have a keen sense of smell, and you don't smell like a dog.



"Well..."



Daniel coughed lightly. He almost choked. Emily realized her words sounded like an ínsult.



"Sorry, I meant..."


"No need to explain, Ms. Johnson, I get it!" Daniel's expression was calm, but there seemed to be a hint of amusement in his deep eyes.



He didn't seem angry.



Emily nodded, "That's great. As long as you understand. But you should return the dog or find someone else to take care of it. Your health isn't suitable for keeping a dog."



Daniel was speechless.



For the first time, he almost couldn't control his expression.



He lowered his eyes, suppressing his emotions.



The atmosphere seemed to become awkward. Emily thought he was sad.



It seemed he really liked dogs. No wonder he greeted her the first time he saw her walking a dog.


After all, this was the mysterious and enigmatic Daniel.



Just as Emily was thinking about how to comfort him.



Daniel suddenly looked up at her, "This dog is very important to me. I want to see it often. Could you help me take care of it?"



What?



Luckily, the butler didn't hear Daniel's words.


Otherwise, he would be utterly confused.



It was just a dog bought from the market. How did it suddenly become so important? He had taken care of Daniel for so many years and never knew he was a dog lover!



Emily was a bit conflicted, "Mr. Smith, I just adopted a dog myself and don't know much about taking care of dogs. If I don't do a good job, it might not be appropriate. Besides, I'm quite busy."



The dog she adopted was meant for Liam to take care of when he came back.



Daniel's deep eyes seemed to darken.



It made Emily feel guilty for refusing.



Ridiculous!



This was Daniel. How could he have such an expression?



It must be her imagination. But then Daniel said in a deep voice, "Don't worry about that. I'TI arrange for a professional dog caretaker to help, who can also take care of your dlog. I just want to see Cloudy often." Cloudy was the name of Daniel's dog.



"Besides, if you don't have time, the person I arrange can make up for that!" Daniel added.



Emily thought about it.



It seemed like a good idea.



At least it was responsible for the dog she adopted, Biscuit.



No wonder Daniel's dog had such a good name. Unlike her, she named her dog so casually.



Maybe,just like her, growing up like a weed, she had grown up.



After they reached an agreement, Emily took Biscuit back home. Daniel watched her and Biscuit's backs, his eyes dark and unreadable.



The veins on the back of his hand became more prominent.


After she got home, she received a call from Violette.



She had blocked Eli's number.



So only Violette could reach her.



As soon as the call connected, Eli's voice came through, "Why haven't you come back yet? Did you mess with Bianca today? You're so thoughtless. Get back here and apologize to Bianca. If she gets sick, I won't forgive you."



Emily frowned, about to retort.



But then she heard Violette's voice, "Eli, Emily is your daughter too.How can you talk to her like that? I was there, and Emily didn't bully Bianca. Even if you care about Bianca, you shouldn't be so biased."



Violette then quickly said to Emily, "Emily,don't listen to your dad.He's just being unreasonable. You don't need to come back. Fll leave the Johnson Villa after I finish here, and I'll contact you then."



She had originally thought of persuading Eli to treat Emily better and have Emily come back to get along with the family.



After all, family grudges should not last overnight.



Seeing Eli's attitude now, she understood why Emily preferred to stay away. It broke her heart.



She even thought of arranging for Emily to live with her daughter,Sofia Moore,once her own matters were settled.



"Dad, it's my fault, not Emily's. I was anxious and said something inappropriate, which upset Floyd. Emily didn't bully me or say anything harsh to Floyd." Bianca's voice was hoarse from crying as she hurriedly explained.



But the more she did. the more it made the family feel sorry for her.



Eli's tone towards Violette was cold and forceful, "Violette, you're here to ask for my help, right? I thought you came to lecture me.Bianca is our treasure. If you want our help, be good to Bianca,not defending that ungrateful Emily."



"Eli!" Violette's face turned very unpleasant.



Her health was already poor, and Eli's words made her feel even weaker.



Emily had been missing for so many years, surviving by scavenging and begging. It was hard enough to find her, only to be treated unfairly by her family. If Violette didn't care for Emily,she would be truly pítiful and helpless.



Violette clenched her fists but remained resolute, "Eli, I'm asking for your help. If you can help me out of sibling love, I'll be grateful forever. But this has nothing to do with Emily. If you're going to be so biased, you might as well let me take care of her!"



"Violette, you misunderstand. Dad cares about Emily, too.Your words make it seem like we can't accept Emily. It's all because of me. My poor health makes everyone overprotective. I'll apologize to Emily and bring her back. It's better than you taking her away and making our parents look bad!"



Bianca cried pitifully, her body swaying.



But she still cared about the family's reputation.



Eli felt more satisfied and protective of Bianca, which made him even more displeased with Emily.



He snorted coldly. "If you keep defending Emily, don't expect me to help you!"



Violette's face turned very unpleasant, her eyes red, but she stubbornly held her ground. "Violette, if they won't help you. I will!"



Emily hadn't hung up the phone and had heard the entire conversation on her way to the Johnson Villa.



Her heart was full.



When she entered the house, she heard Eli's threatening words.



He was Violette's brother, fully aware of how important this was to her,yet he still forced her to comply with his wishes.



How dominant!



However, Emily's response was equally bold



Violette hurriedly stepped forward, tryingto push Emily out,"Didn't I tell you not to come? Are you stupid? Go, I'll handle my own matters." Since you're here, apologize quickly. Don't leave!"



Hayden immediately blocked Emily's way, speaking harshly.


Eli agreed with Hayden, glaring coldly at Emily, "Come here and kneel to apologize to Bianca, or I'll break your legs!"
###Chapter 29 She Loves All Her Children,Except Emily
Violette's face flushed with anger as soon as she heard those words.



She stepped in front of Emily, "You wanna touch Emily.you deal with me first!"



Even though she wasn't super close to Eli, they were still family.Hayden was younger, and causing a scene would only mess up the Johnson family's reputation.



Eli's face stayed cold, "Move aside, or I won't even think about helping you."



Violette stood her ground, her neck stiff with defiance, refusing to budge.



Bianca's eyes flickered as she stepped forward and took Violette's hand,′′Violette, aren't you making things hard for my dad and Hayden? Emily's your niece, but aren't we your family too?" As she spoke, she tried to pull Violette away.



Violette tried to break free, but as soon as she moved, Bianca put on a pained expression.



Violette felt torn. She cared deeply for Emily,but she also didn't want to hurt Bianca, so she stopped struggling.



"Bianca, please talk to your dad and Hayden. Emily is your sister after all..."



"Violette, I've tried, but Emily might not listen to me," Bianca said,looking troubled, twisting Violette's words and shifting the blame onto Emily.



Emily wasn't surprised by Bianca's actions.



She glared coldly at Hayden, "Are you gonna make a move or not?If not, I'm taking Violette with me."



"Stubborn fool, you asked for this. Don't blame us for being ruthless!"



Hayden couldn't believe that even without Violette's protection.Emily still dared to be so defiant.



Hayden exchanged a glance with Eli. who nodded.



"No!"



Bianca shouted just as Hayden was about to strike.



Violette took advantage of Bianca's momentary distraction to try to rush forward, but Eli blocked her.



It was too late for her to save anyone.



Just when everyone thought Emily was about to get hurt, a cry of pain echoed through the room. It was Hayden.



Everyone turned to see Hayden clutching his leg, writhing in pain on the floor.



"Hayden..."



"Hayden!"



Bianca and Cleo, who had just come downstairs, rushed over in concern.



Eli remained calm, immediately calling for the butler to fetch the family doctor.



His sharp gaze turned to Emily, feeling both unfamiliar and out of control.



"When did you learn to fight?"



He hadn't even seen Emily make a move, yet Hayden was already on the ground. Such speed wasn't something an untrained person could achieve. Emily feigned innocence, "What are you talking about? I don't understand. I was just defending myself. You know, I grew up scavenging for food, sometimes having to fight off others, so I picked up a bit of strength."



Of course, she wouldn't admit it.



In her past life, after being thrown into a lake by thugs while trying to save Bianca, she had vowed to learn self-defense so she could protect herself and truly help Bianca.



Now,these skills had become her means of self-preservation, and it was ironic that she had to use them against the Johnson family.



It was truly ironic that the ones who hurt her the most were the Johnsons.



"You're lying. You expect me to believe you didn't train in combat?How else could you take down Hayden?" Eli scoffed, not believing her.



As they spoke, no one expected Cleo to suddenly step forward and slap Emily across the face.



"How dare you! That was Hayden! How could you be so vicious? I used to think you learned some tricks for self-defense,but now I see you're rotten to the core."



Cleo shouted at Emily, her voice trembling with emotion.



Emily's expression remained cold as she stared back at Cleo,her heart churning with emotions.



She had shown motherly love to Bianca, Hayden, and perhaps any other child, but never to her.



"Yeah, rotten to the core," Emily muttered sarcastically.



The Johnson family was rotten to the core, and she should never have had any expectations.



Violette saw the sadness in Emily's eyes and pushed Eli aside. She stood in front of Emily, facing Cleo coldly, "If it weren't for your favoritism, Emily wouldn't be like this. And her being kidnapped and having to survive out there, isn't that your fault? How dare you blame her? Hayden was the one who threatened to break her leg first."



Cleo's face turned pale at Violette's words



Ignoring Cleo, Violette grabbed Emily's hand, "If they don't care about you, I do. Come on, let's go home."



Eli sneered, "Your family can barely take care of themselves. Do you think they can take care of her? If your family finds out you didn't get my help because of her, what do you think will happen?"



Emily's eyes turned icy as she looked at Eli.


He was hinting at something, and Emily understood.



So, he knew about the abuse Violette suffered at the Moores, yet he did nothing in her past life, allowing Violetteher to endure everything. "What are you glaring at? Violette is suffering because of you!" Eli mocked.



Violette,however,comforted Emily,′′It7's not your fault."



Emily squeezed Violette's hand, "Violette, do you trust me?"



Without hesitation, Violette nodded.



Emily felt a bit of the pain inflicted by the Johnson family ease with Violette's unconditional trust.



She stood tall, looking at Eli and the others, "Are you going to stop us? If not, we're leaving."



Eli motioned for the butler to call security, but Cleo suddenly shouted, "Let her go! I want to see how she survives without the Johnson family, and how she plans to help Violette."



Without a moment's hesitation, Emily pulled Violette away. Eli kicked over a nearby trash can in anger, "This is infuriating!"



His authority as the head of the family had been shattered,and he was livid.



Bianca quickly tried to calm him down, "Dad, Emily is just being stubborn. Don't let it affect your health. Without the Johnson family's support, she won't be able to help Violette. She'll regret it soon enough."



Eli looked at the sensible Bianca, feeling a bit calmer, "Without the Johnson family, she'd still be scavenging for food. She has no money.I was too angry to think straight. She'll come crawling back. No one is to give her any money, understood?"



Hayden,who had just been treated by the family doctor,was seething with hatred for Emily.



"Who would give her money? I can't wait to see her beg. Then I'll make her pay."



He laughed maniacally, not realizing that he had been the one to threaten Emily first. She had only defended herself and hadn't even used full force, or he would have been crippled.



The Johnson family seemed to have forgotten about Byron's mysterious pain.



Eli remembered something else, "Bianca,you promised the Johnson Group's design plans. When will you give them to me? We have a chance to collaborate with the Green Group, and the designs are crucial."



Bianca's eyes flashed with panic.



She had no design skills. She had always relied on Emily for designs, but now that Emily no longer lived at the Johnson Villa where would she get new designs?
###Chapter 30 Rather Destroy It Than Let Bianca Have It
"What's up?" Eli noticed Bianca's unusual expression and asked.concerned.



Bianca quickly composed herself and apologized, "Sorry, Dad. I almost forgot. There's a design competition coming up, and I've been so focused on preparing for it. Don't worry. I'II get back to it right away."



She remembered that Emily had a sketchbook with some design ideas and drafts. If she could find something new, she could present it to Eli. If not, she could always buy some designs from talented but financially struggling individuals



Eli's eyes lit up at the mention of the design competition. Winning it would certainly boost their reputation.



If Bianca won, it would add more titles to her name, which would be great for future collaborations and price negotiations. "Very well. Make sure to prepare well for the competition. As for the Green Group, A few drafts are enough for now. I'll throw you a celebration party when you win."



Just then, Aiden walked in, looking travel-worn."What celebration party?" he asked, curious.



He handed Bianca a gift. "I found this set of Ms. Sinclair's latest work at an auction in the neighboring state. Do you like it?"



Bianca's face lit up as she accepted the gift. She had recently discussed with her friends how everyone wanted Elise's new diamond necklace set. Now she had it, and they would be so envious. Elise's work was rare and highly coveted.



"Thank you, Aiden. I love it," she said, holding the box with care."Dad was just joking. I haven't even competed yet, and he's already planning a party. It's a lot of pressure."



Aiden smiled warmly and patted her head. "I believe in you,Bianca. You're so talented; you'll definitely win first place." Hayden chimed in, "Of course, Bianca is the smartest and most capable. Unlike Emily, who only knows how to cause trouble and doesn't focus on her studies."



He took the opportunity to badmouth Emily.



Cleo,still upset, didn't want to hear anything about Emily. "Stop talking about her. We should never have taken her back."



Cleo regretted bringing Emily back. If they had just given her some financial support, she might have agreed to donate bone marrow without any issues. Cleo forgot that Emily resembled her the most among the children, and people would have noticed over timne.



Aiden found it hard to reconcile the harsh image Hayden painted with the Emily he remembered, who always tried to please him.



"Since Mom doesn't want to talk about it, let's drop it. By the way Bianca..." Aiden had another important matter to discuss. "Remember the AI project I mentioned last time? You had some great insights. Could you join our research team? We're stuck at a bottleneck and really need your help."



Bianca had been very helpful before, and the team suggested she join them.



Bianca felt uneasy. The ideas she shared with Aiden were actually things she overheard from Emily. She didn't want Aiden to find out and overshadow her.



"I'm sorry, Aiden. You know I have to help Dad with the designs and prepare for the competition. I really don't have time," she said apologetically.



Aiden looked disappointed but understood."HIow about this? When you have some free time, come by the office, and we can chat. Your insights could still help us."



Bianca pretended to think it over.′′I7m not feeling well today, but I know someone who's a computer genius. He's the top student in our school's computer science program and a professor's favorite. Some of my ideas came from him. He could help your team," Aiden was grateful. "Thank you. Bianca. Please introduce us."



Bianca felt relieved. She excused herself, claiming she wasn't feeling well, and went upstairs. Instead of going to her room,she headed to the studio where Emily's sketchbook was likely kept.



During her search, she called Hugo Graves, a computer science student, and after their conversation, Hugo was so grateful that he vowed to protect her.



"Found it!" Bianca exclaimed, pulling Emily's sketchbook from under a makeshift pillow. She discarded the pillow and examined the sketches. She was lucky; there were two designs she hadn't used yet.



Meanwhile, Emily, on her way back, suddenly remembered the sketchbook. "How could I forget?" she muttered, frustrated. In her past life, all her designs had been claimed by Bianca, making her famous. This time, she had better ideas, but those sketches were still her hard work. She'd rather destroy them than let Bianca have them.



"Emily,what's wrong? Why are you hitting your head?" Violette
asked, concerned.



Emily smiled. "It's nothing. Just thinking about how some things are wasted on a dog."



Violette was surprised. "You fed a dog? Where are you staying? If it's a stray, bring it to my place."



Violette's family of five lived in a three-bedroom house. and it was already cramped with Emily staying there. But Violette didn't want Emily to feel unwanted.



Emily smiled."Not righat now. You should come stay at my place for a few days to recover. Violette..."



Her expression turned serious. "Your injuries, they're from your husband, aren't they?"
###Chapter 31 There Might Be More to The Debt Issue


Violette's eyes flashed with panic and embarrassment.

She instinctively tugged at her sleeve, trying to cover the bruises on her arm.

"Emily, no, I fell by accident. He didn't hit me," Violette said, her voice trembling.

She seemed to forget that Emily was a doctor. The difference between being hit and falling was obvious.


Maybe she thought Emily's medical skills weren't that good, and she just happened to know about her low blood sugar.


Emily didn't push Violette to admit the truth, maybe thinking it would be too embarrassing to talk about domestic violence in front of her younger relative


"Emily, I think I should go back. Can you drop me off at a bus stop?" Violette said hesitantly after a moment of silence.


"Violette, are you in such a hurry to go back because you need to borrow money from someone else? If that's the case, I can help you!" Emily offered.


In her previous life, Emily had investigated Violette's situation after her death and found out that Violette had come to the Johnson Villa for help because of money. Unfortunately, at that time, the Johnson family was collaborating with the Green family, and Emily was busy with Aiden's AI research, even living at the company,so she missed the chance to help.


Violette needed the money for her husband, Isaiah.

Isaiah had secretly taken out a high-interest loan. The lender threatened Isaiah, saying that if he didn't repay the money, they would come to collect the debt personally.


They also said that if Isaiah couldn't repay, he would go to jail.The risk of a lawsuit or even jail time freaked them out.


This was why Violette was so anxious.


In her previous life, Violette didn't get the money, and somehow, Isaiah managed to repay it and lived a carefree life with another woman.


"No, where would you get the money? I'll figure it out myself. You don't need to. worry," Violette said,thinking about the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed and instinctively believing Emily couldn't possibly have that much.


She feared Emily might try to help her even if she didn't have the money, making sacrifices for her sake.

"Violette, have you ever doubted?"

"Doubted what?"


"Isaiah, how did he get that money? What did he do with it? If it were gambling, aren't you afraid it's.a bottomless pit that will harm not only you but also Sofia and Atticus?"


Gamblers are the most dangerous.

And hard to change!


"No, it can't be! He just partnered with someone in business and lost money!"

Violette's face turned pale, but she still didn't want to believe it. Emily was just giving Violette a heads-up, hoping she would think clearly and divorce Isaiah when the time came.


So she didn't rush to convince Violette.


In the meantime, Emily's car arrived at the entrance of Serenity Grove.

The guard saluted and let them pass automatically.

Violette was puzzled about why Emily had come here.

It wasn't until Emily led Violette into her own villa, where Biscuit greeted her with a wagging tail, that Violette realized Emily must be the owner of the villa.


"Emily, is this your house? Or did your fiancé give it to you?" Violette hesitated but asked.
b
"I bought it myself," Emily said confidently with a smile.′′SO, Violette, I am capable. If you need money, I can help,but it might take a few days."


Violette was shocked and speechless.

But after a few days...

She thought about the menacing debt collectors and couldn't help but worry.


"If you're worried about Atticus and Sofia being afected, let them stay with me temporarily. As for Isaiah,no matter the reason, he borrowed money behind your back, and he needs to face the consequences to avoid making the same mistake again!"


Emily's eyes flashed coldly.

Helping him repay the debt? Not a chance!

He dared to hit Violette; she had to find a way to deal with him.


Violette was eventually persuaded.

The simple-hearted Violette felt uneasy staying in thevilla without doing anything.

So,unable to sit still,Violette busied herself with cleaning and cooking.

Emily didn't stop her, thinking it might help Violette feel more at ease.

Violette discovered another dog, a Border Collie, cowering in the corner, seemingly timid and unfamiliar.

"Emily, why do you have two dogs?" Violette asked, not to pry but worried Emily might be too busy.

Emily opened her mouth to explain, but the doorbell rang.


She frowned.

She hadn't told anyone she moved here, so who could it be?


When she opened the door, she was met with a pair of deep, mysterious eyes.

Her face showed a flash of surprise.

"Mr. Smith, what brings you here?" Emily's voice softened instinctively in front of Daniel's imposing presence.

Daniel was slightly different from his usual self.

Visiting someone uninvited naturally required a gentler demeanor. He thought he looked friendly, "I brought some dog food and a professional dog caretaker."

As he spoke, he stepped aside, revealing the professional behind him holding a large bag of dog food.

Emily remembered the matter at hand.

Dogs reflect their owners!

Biscuit could be as causualas she was.


Daniel's dog, however, lived a life of luxury incomparable to hers.

"Sorry, I've been so busy I forgot."


She was about to ask about his health.


The words circled in her mouth, but she remembered she wasn't a doctor at the mnoment and swallowed them back.


She stepped aside, inviting them in.

Cloudy,who had been hiding in the shadows, heard Daniel's voice and ran out, shedding its previous gloom.

"Emily, the dog ran out..." Violette, already wondering why the dog seemed so afraid, worried it might be sick, chased after it, and saw Daniel.


A stranger!


With such a strong presence.

Violette was scared but couldn't help but scrutinize him. After all.Emily was so young.

This man was suddenly visiting, so she had to worry about Emily.


"Violette, this is Mr. Smith. He lives nearby and came to see his dog, Cloudy. He can't keep a dog due to his health, so Cloudy is staying with me. The person next to him is a professional dog caretaker."


Emily saw Violette's nervousness. She herself felt Daniel's strong presence, so she didn't blame Violette for her reaction.


She quickly explained.

Then she introduced Violette to Daniel.


"Mr.Smith!"

Violette's eyes widened.


She had heard of Daniel, since she was also one of the Johnson family.


He was James's uncle, so maybe they were familiar?

Or perhaps James knew Emily lived near Daniel and asked him to look after her.


"Please call me Daniel," Daniel greeted warmly, lowering his stance.


He placed himself in the position of a younger person.

Violette was taken aback.

Daniel was known for his ruthless efficiency. Even though Daniel was polite, Violette remained tense.


Fortunately, Daniel seemed to just check on the dog and left.


The professional caretaker stayed behind.


Violette relaxed and pulled Emily aside, "Emily, when did you get so close to Mr. Smith? Did James ask him to look after you?"


Emily hesitated but decided to tell the truth,′′Violette, it has nothing to do with James. I met Mr. Smith by chance. James and I are no longer engaged."
###Chapter 32 The James From Past Was Gone


"What?" Violette was stunned.


She'd only heard that Emily had been mistreated at the Johnson Villa and had moved out. She had no clue the engagement was off.


As for James, he hadn't reached out to Emily in the past few days. The Smith family had been dealing with some drama, keeping him busy. Plus, he wanted to give Emily some space, hoping she'd calm down, realize her mistake, and apologize to him.


Instead of hearing from Emily, he got a call from Bianca.


"James,sorry to bother you. I'd like to know if Emily's been with you these past few days?" Bianca's voice sounded shaky, like she'd been crying.


Mentioning Emily, James's expression turned icy. But hearing Bianca's distress, his coldness melted into concern.


"What did she do now? And Bianca, what's wrong? Did someone mess with you? Was it Emily?" James's first thought was that Emily had done something wrong. How else could someone as sweet as Bianca be upset?


Bianca quickly denied it.′′NO,James, Emily didn't bully me. I'm just worried about her. She seems to have misunderstood me deeply. Because of me, she broke Hayden's leg and had a falling out with or dad, storming off in anger. I don't know where she went. I thought she might come to you."


James's expression shifted. If Emily had run away a few days ago, she might've gone to the house filled with their memories. But that house had burned down. Where could she go? A young woman, out all night! Just the thought of it made James's face darken.


He didn't mention that Emily hadn't contacted him, but his voice clearly carried displeasure. "I can't believe she hurt Hayden. How has she become so terrible?"


Honestly, James found it hard to believe Emily would do such a thing. He knew how much Emily cared about the Johnson family. She had hardly experienced familial love growing up and yearned for it deeply.


Bianca noticed James's defense of Emily, a cold glint flashing in her eyes. It seemed James still had feelings for Emily. She immediately apologized, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to speak ill of Emily. If I hadn't seen it myself,I wouldn't believe it either. Maybe it's all my fault.


"This afternoon, she claimed she knew medicine and started treating people recklessly. Iwas worried she might get into trouble and triedto advise her. She misunderstood me and got so angry that she took it out on Hayden and the others."


"So, James, I want to ask you for help. Can you persuade Emily not to be mad at the family? If she doesn't like me, I'm willing to stay away from the house, as long as she comes back, apologizes to her parents, and returns to the Johnson Villa. I'll be fine."


Bianca's retreating strategy made James feel incredibly sympathetic. "Bianca, how could this be your fault? It's her narrow-mindedness. You were only trying to help her. With her limited medical skills, treating people could be harmful."


James didn't doubt Bianca's words at all. He even thought she was too kind. Emily was simply being unreasonable. She had learned a little and dared to treat people.


"Don't worry, I'll make sure she apologizes to you and Hayden personally," Jamnes promised solemnly.


Bianca got the reaction she wanted. She continued, "James, can I make a request? I want to go with you to see Emily. I don't know where she went after leaving the Johnson Villa. I'm really worried about her and want to persuade her to come back."


"Alright, once I find her, I'll take you to bring her home," James agreed after some thought. Bianca's lips curled into a satisfied smile. "Okay, I'll wait for you."

After checking on Bianca's well-being, James hung up and immediately dialed Emily's number.


Emily was in her study, organizing materials for her transfer tomorrow. Without looking at the caller ID, she answered the phone.


"Emily, where are you right now? A young woman out all night, what does that look like? And Bianca was only worried you might harm someone with your limited medical skills. You didn't appreciate her concern and even blamed her, taking it out on the Johnson family. You should know, our engagement was because you were part of the Johnson family. Otherwise, with your past of scavenging, you wouldn't be worthy of being engaged to me."


As soon as the call connected, James's scolding came through.


Once,she had been forced to scavenge to survive. James had only pitied her. Now, it had become something he used to attack her.


The James who had defended her had changed, without her knowing when.


Emily responded coldly, "You're just listening to Bianca's side of-the story, aren't you? Since' you believe her,don't bother me anymore."

"Emily!" James's face darkened. "You're being unreasonable. The engagement involves both families, but if you continue like this, I'll tell my family to cut ties with the Johnson family. Then you'll have no way out."

'She must know that the families have joint projects and interests, which is why she dared to be so reckless.Yes, that must be it! Even after returning the engagement tokens, she is not worried.'

"Those interests benefit the Johrison family, not me. And since we returned the engagement tokens, we have no relationship anymore. Don't contact me again. We have nothing to do with each other."
###Chapter 32 The James From Past Was Gone
James was living in his own world, unable to understand her words. Emily hung up, blocked his number, and moved on without hesitation.


James heard the busy tone. This was the umpteenth time she had dared to hang up on him. She had never done this before! It seemed she was really angry this time. She hadn't mentioned her whereabouts!


James thought about it. If she was foolish enough to be easily deceived, he was just concerned for her. He decided to call her again.


The first time he called, he heard a mechanical voice. He thought she was genuinely on another call. But after a while, he called again and still heard the mechanical voice. James realized she had blocked him!


'Emily, you really have some nerve!'


James's face darkened, his eyes filled with anger. He immediately called his assistant. "Find out where Emily is staying,right now!"


The assistant sensed the coldness in James's voice and quickly responded, "Yes, sir!"


After hanging up, the assistant immediately arranged for an investigation.

Meanwhile, Emily was unaware of the commotion, but it did alert Daniel.

"Mr. Smith, someone is looking into Ms. Johnson," Daniel's assistant, Miguel Jimenez, reported promptly.


Especially since Emily's apartment had been sold through Daniel's company, James's assistant's investigation triggered Daniel's security system.


"Who exactly?" Daniel's expression remained calm, but his aura turned icy.


Miguel knew this was a sign of Daniel's anger. "It's James," Miguel replied truthfully. Daniel's brows furrowed slightly, his voice cold and detached. "He's too idle. Give him something to do.
Assign him the resort project."


"Yes, sir." Miguel responded calmly, though he felt a shiver inside. It wasn't that Daniel was generously giving James a project. The resort project was good, but it had many pitfalls. Without sufficient skill, it would be a total disaster.
###Chapter 33 I'll Handle It My Way
Emily wasn't swayed by James.


She also didn't know that Daniel had quietly taken care of some trouble for her.


After finishing her paperwork, she didn't forget her main task.


She dialed a long-forgotten number.


The last time she contacted him was actually in her previous life.


Back then, shehad begged him for help to save Hayden, who was being sold overseas.


Because of her medical skills, she had helped him before, but due to his complex and dangerous background,she avoided getting involved with him unless absolutely necessary.


But this man, when she was in danger abroad and Hayden had abandoned her to save himself,risked his life to rescue her.


Although she didn't blame Hayden-she had told him to run, and in his tortured state, he would have only been a burden if he stayed-she was still grateful to Knox Green, the true head of the Green family, for his timely help.


"Mr. Green, it has been a long time."


Emily didn't seek out Daniel; she felthis promise was too significant to use lightly.


Knox's voice was cheerful and clear, "Emily, I owe you, not the other way around. I thought you'd never speak to me again in this lifetime!" The familiar words and voice pulled Emily back to her past life. She felt a bit guiltytowards him.

For her. he had a long scar on his handsome face.

He had even laughed at the time, "This is a badge of honor. Whenever you see this scar, remember you owe me!"


"Why call and not speak? Did I scare you?" Knox's voice was playful, but there was a hint of concern.


"No, I told you, you owe me. I'm calling to collect. I need your help to investigate someone named Rhett Moore. I heard he recently got into debt with loan sharks. I want to know how much he owes, how he got into debt, and who he's been in contact with lately."


Emily didn't hold back,stating her request directly.

"This is a small matter. I'll arrange i. Since you're asking for my help, you must not be afraid of me anymore. How about we have dinner together?"


Emily just wanted to get this favor done and clear their debt, not wanting him to fall into the same troubles as in her past life.


She was about to refuse.

But Knox continued, "Emily, if you don't agree, I won't help, and you'll still owe me!"

His tone was playful.


Emily thought for a moment,'′′Fne,you arrange it. Just let me know in advance; I'm quite busy."


Knox's face, previously hidden in the shadows, brightened with joy. "Great, I'll be in touch!" He was referring to both the investigation and their dinner plan.

Emily hung up, took a shower, and fell asleep.

She slept soundly.

Now, James's news hardly affected her mood.

The next morning.

When she got up, Violette had already prepared breakfast


"Violette, I need to go to school later. Don't go back to Rhett's place for now. Call Atticus and invite them to stay here for a couple of days. I'll handle this matter soon, okay?"


Emily gave instructions to Violette after breakfast, before leaving the villa.

"Okay!" Violette met Emily's gaze.

Despite her young and slender face, she exuded the same aura that Daniel had yesterday

Violette instinctively agreed.

Satisfied, Emily headed to school.

She went straight to the professor she wanted to see about switching to the physics department.

Professor Kurt Lowe was the top professor in the physics department.

He naturally refused.

Though he admired her courage to approach him directly, courage alone wasn't enough. "No way. You're a design major. What a joke, thinking you can switch to physics?" Kurt thought Emily was out of her mind.


Emily had chosen design becausé of Bianca. Her family wanted her to look after Bianca,who was in poor health, and she had agreed to please them.


"Mr. Lowe, I'm not joking."

"You say you're not, but you're an art major wanting to switch to physics after a year. You wouldn't keep up with the pace. You don't understand, and I don't blame you. Go back to where you came from!" Kurt waved her off, surprisingly without losing his temper.

Everyone knew he had a bad temper, especially about professional matters.

Emily didn't leave in shame. She took out her recent research proposal and a paper she had published in her past life, placing them in front of Kurt. "What about these? Would you consider accepting me then?"


She hadn't even conducted experiments for the paper; she knew the data and theories were valid from her past life.


Kurt initially didn't takeit seriously, planning to criticize her and make her give up.

But as he read, he sat up straight, eyes wide, repeatedly tapping the table. "Good, very good.Why didn't I think of this? With a mind like yours, why did you choose that major? What a waste of a year. But it's not too late..."


Kurt's praise flowed freely.

The transfer was settled.


Emily had approached Kurt for this reason. He held many patents, and the school valued him. If he approved the transfer, the paperwork would be a breeze. Sure enough. Kurt didn't need her to say more. He rushed to the principal's office, "I'll get your transfer done immediately. We'll start your research right away..."


Kurt hurried off.

Emily. left in the empty office, decided to visit her current advisor.


On her way, many people gave her strange looks.

She overheard whispers.

"She hasn't been to school for days. I thought she wouldn't dare come back. Why is she here?"

"Is the stuff on the forum true? The school hasn't said anything about it?"


Emily had expected this. The school hadIn't addressed the rumors, but she remained unaffected and went straight to her advisor.


"Ms. Chambers, what is the school planning to do about the rumors on the forum?"


Emily got straight to the point.

Her advisor, Lavinia Chambers, was a middle-aged woman.

Recently, she had been in a bad mood due to family business issues.

Emily's question irritated her further.


She responded coldly, "This has caused a lotof trouble. You 'should reflect on why, even without evidence,
you were accused. To minimize the impact, we're handling it quietly. You'd better behave."

Emily frowned, "I did nothing wrong. You haven't investigated, so why say that? I want you to find out who framed me. If you don't. I'll handle it myself, my way!"

"Are you threatening me?" Lavinia's face turned cold, glaring at Emily.
###Chapter 34 Her Conditions


"That's kinda harsh, don't you think? A teacher's supposed to look out for their students, right?" Emily said with a smile, locking eyes with Lavinia.


Lavinia felt a lump in her throat, a flash of humiliation crossing her face. She thought Emily was trying to provoke her. Despite Emily being part of the Johnson family, she wasn't particularly favored, and Lavinia had no intention of coddling her.


"Yeah, protecting students is part of my job, but only if they deserve it. The stuff people are saying about you online is pretty clear. I haven't held it against you, yet you dare to challenge me? Do you think I'm a pushover?" Lavinia sneered.


These comments had been confirmed by Bianca herself, so they couldn't be false. If it weren't for Bianca constantly defending and explaining on Emily's behalf, Emily would have been reported by other students and punished by the school long ago.


Emily's smile faded, her demeanor turning cold and firm. She raised her eyes slightly and said in a chilly tone, "Ms. Chambers, what do you mean by 'undeniable'? Where's the evidence? If you can provide evidence,I'll accept any punishment, even expulsion. But..."

She stepped closer to Lavinia, her powerful presence causing Lavinia to step back instinctively.

"Do you have evidence? If not, don't make baseless accusations. As a teacher,you should set a better example."


Lavinia backed into the táble behind her, realizing she had been intimidated by a student. Her face darkened."Even without evidence, it's still your fault. Bianca begged everyone not to hold it against you, which indirectly admits you did it. Your.own family acknowledged it; what more evidence do you need?"


Lavinia's disdain was evident. Emily had been too naive before, unable to play the victim or explain herself, leading to misunderstandings and everyone believing Bianca's words.


Emily. tired of arguing with someone biased against her, directly presented photos and a USB drive as evidence, placing them in front of Lavinia.


"But I have evidence proving my innocence! These are the proofs I've collected. If you still insist on your views despite the evidence, then I must say, a teacher like you is misleading students and should quit teaching."


"You!" Lavinia's face turned ugly with anger. She grabbed the photos and quickly flipped through them, then inserted the USB drive into her computer to check the contents. After reviewing them, a look of surprise flashed in her eyes. She hadn't expected Emily to be so innocent.


However,Lavinia's perception of Emily didn't improve due to her attitude. She said indifferently, "Since you have evidence, why didn't you present it earlier? I've seen it now, and although it's not your fault, you should avoid getting involved in such matters in the future. It isn't good for your reputation. Also, you need to get along with your classmates. If you can't handle relationships in school, how will you manage in the real world?"


Lavinia considered herself a good teacher, always offering life advice, even now. Emily remained cold,knowing that getting along with others depended on their worth. Having lived through a lot,she understood that absolute power eliminates difficult relationships.


Ignoring Lavinia's advice, Emily said, "So, are you going to handle the online issue now?"

"What?" Lavinia frowned, feeling that Emily hadn't listened to her advice at all, her attitude growing colder."Since it's not your fault, I'll ask the admin to take down the post. That's it."


"Is that all?"

"What more do you want?" Lavinia asked, annoyed by Emily's persistence. Emily met Lavinia's sharp gaze. "It's simple. The post was made by Ronnie Ford from the Computer Science Department. He spread false rumors and led the online harassment against me. I want a public apology from him and disciplinary action."


Lavinia knew her husband's company was looking to collaborate with Ronnie's professor, Glenn Cole, Ronnie was a prominent figure in the Computer Science department. Glenn's prized student. Asking Glenn to discipline Ronnie would jeopardize the collaboration.


"No way!" Lavinia rejected outright. "I can ask him to apologize privately, but disciplinary action is too much.You weren't harmed, and a disciplinary record could ruin his future. Don't be so narrow-minded."


Emily's gaze remained cold. "I wasn't harmed because I endured it. That's no excuse for him to escape punishment. If you can't be fair. I'll report this to the school administration myself."


Emily collected the photos and USB drive before Lavinia could react. Lavinia's expression hardened,refusing to back down. Emily turned to leave, but Lavinia blocked her path.


"Stop! You can't go!" Lavinia threatened, "Emily, don't be stubborn. Follow my solution, or you'll regret it.You need my approval for your graduation. If you don't listen, be prepared not to graduate!"


Emily's face turned icy. She smiled faintly at Lavinia, "Thanks for the reminder. I'll transfer' to another department. Then you won't be able to block my graduation."


Lavinia thought Emily was bluffing. She laughed, "You think transferring is that easy? It requires my approval. If I tell the other department you're not a good student, who would accept you?"


Lavinia felt triumphant, believing she controlled Emily's fate. Emily remained calm, smiling, "No need to worry. I've already found a professor wvilling to take me."


Lavinia frowned, doubting Emily's claim. She mocked, "You talk big. Which professor would take you?"

Emily didn't hesitate, dialing Kurt's number in front of Lavinia, asking him to come over. Lavinia watched,
expecting Emily to fail. But as Emily madde the call. Lavinia felt a twinge of panic, though she quickly calmed down, thinking Emily was bluffing.


She vaguely heard Emily mention "Mr. Lowe," wondering who that was. Lavinia didn't consider the Physics department, so she was puzzled.

"I'll see if you can really call someone," Lavinia said, watching Emily with a smirk.

Meanwhile, Emily's presence at school caught the attention of Lily, who immediately informed Bianca.
###Chapter 35 Yeah! I hit you!


"Bianca, can you believe Emily had the guts to come back to school? I thought she'd hide out for a few days and then be too scared to show her face."


Lily shook Bianca's shoulder, mocking Emily.


Bianca frowned, looking worried. "Lily, don't talk about Emily like that. Maybe she realized her mistake and found the courage to come back. I'm relieved. She's been fighting with our family and hasn't been home for days. We couldn't reach her, and I've been really worried."


Lily sighed. "Bianca, after everything she's done to you, how can you still be so kind and care about her?"

"She's my sister. Blood ties can't be severed," Bianca said with a helpless smile.

"But she's really not worth it. And, I didn't finish yet-she's back at school, but the teacher called her straight to the office. I heard she's arguing with the teacher. Honestly, trash like her should be sent to the dump,not school. Being in the same school with her lowers our standards!"


Lily fumed.

Bianca's eyes flashed, but she said, "How could this happen? I need to check on her. I can't let Emily say something she can't take back."


Without waiting for Lily's response, Bianca hurried to the teacher's office.

"Bianca, wait up!" Lily called out, trying to catch up.


She knew how unreasonable Emily could be and didn't want Bianca, who was kind-hearted but not in the best of health, to get upset. She decided to find Ronnie. She knew Ronnie liked Bianca and would definitely help if he knew Bianca was being mistreated.


Lily turned and ran towards the boys' dormitory.


Taking advantage of Lily not catching up, Bianca flashed a sinister smile and quickly dialed a number. After a brief conversation, she hung up and rushed to the teacher's office.


Her anxious demeanor immediately drew attention and speculation. Some couldn't help but follow her.

"Ms. Chambers, I'm here to apologize on Emily's behalf. If she said anything inappropriate,please consider her young age and don't hold it against her."


Bianca feltthe tension in the room as soon as she entered, secretly pleased. She immediately apologized and then turned to Emily, "Emily, this is our teacher. You should respect them and not argue. Hurry, apologize to the teacher."


Emily was surprised to see Bianca. She hadn't expected Bianca to come and immediately blame her without understanding the situation. She felt disgusted as Bianca touched her hand and instinctively shook it off.


Bianca fell to the ground, looking fragile.


"Bianca!" Ronnie, who had rushed over after hearing from Lily that Emily was bullying Bianca, saw Emily push Bianca and hurried to help her up, "Bianca, are you okay?"


Bianca shook her head. "Ronnie, I'm fine. It's not Emily's fault."


Ronnie felt even more protective of her. Even now, she was defending Emily. "Bianca, you're too kind. Some people don't deserve it. Look at her-does she show any gratitude or remorse?"


"Bianca, kindness should have some edge!" Ronnie said, both affectionate and frustrated. His gentle demeanor turned fierce as he looked at Emily. "Emily, why can't you learn from Bianca? Even a fraction of her goodness would prevent you from doing such vile things. It's hard to believe you're sisters.You're so malicious. Apologize to Bianca now."


Emily studied Ronnie. "So, you're Ronnie?"

He was one of Bianca's admirers. Even after Bianca married James in her past life, some couldn't forget her.Emily had heard that several men got drunk on Bianca's wedding night,calling her name.


Ronnie knew his appeal. He felt disgusted as Emily stared at him. He didn't like malicious women like her."Yeah, that's mne. So what? You're not even worth a strand of Bianca's hair. Normally, I wouldn't waste my time on you!" Ronnie sneered.


He was one of Bianca's admirers, but wasn't considered because of his average family background. In their social circle, he was at the bottom. His only assets were his good looks and a bit of talent in computers,but just a bit.


Emily wasn't impressed. "I haven't sought you out, but here you1 are. Perfect!" Emily said coolly.

Ronnie frowned, and Bianca was puzzled. What did Emily mnean?

Lily couldn't help but scoff. "Emily, are you jealous of how well Ronnie treats Bianca? Did you secretly look him up, hoping to meet him? Trash like you, picked from the dump, Ronnie would be disgusted to even glance at you."


Emily's gaze silenced Lily. "Hanging out with Bianca too long has fried your brain?" Emily mocked.

As Lily realized she'd been insulted and was about to retort, Emily turned to Lavinia. "Ms. Chambers, while my teacher isn't here yet, the culprit is. You still have a chance to decide."

"Emily, how can you talk to Ms. Chambers like that? It sounds like a threat. Who have you been hanging out with these days? Your words are always sharp. Even if you're mad at me, I have to say something." Bianca scolded, then quickly apologized to Lavinia. "Ms. Chambers, Emily's been fighting with her family and hasn't been home. She's probably been misled by bad influences. Please don't hold it against her. I'll make sure she changes her ways."


Even now, she hadn't given up on Emily. To everyone, Bianca seemed like a pure, kind girl.


Ronnie's eyes burned with admiration for her. He turned to Emily. "You're so vile. No wonder you've been corrupted by outsiders. If it weren't for Bianca, you'd have been expelled long ago. Apologize to Bianca and promise to obey her from now on."


As soon as Ronnie finished speaking, a powerful slap landed on his face, shocking everyone.

Ronnie, realizing what had happened, gritted his teeth. "How dare you hit me!"


Emily replied, "Yeah! I hit you! I haven't even settled the score for the rumors you spread. How dare you lie so easily?"
###Chapter 36 Still Arguing


"Dammit..." Ronnie muttered angrily.

He held back when he noticed Bianca was still there.

Bianca was hoping Emily and Ronnie would start a fight. After all, Ronnie had plenty of women who secretly admired him. Plus, he was Glenn's prized student, and Bianca knew. Glenn was fiercely protective. If Emily offended Ronnie, it was like offending Glenn.


"Ronnie, are you okay? I'm sorry, it's my fault. If you want to blame someone, blame me!" Bianca anxiously tried to check where Ronnie had been hit.


She reached out to touch Ronnie's face but quickly pulled her hand back, realizing it was inappropriate. She hurriedly apologized.


Ronnie's anger dissipated immediately because of Bianca's words. He sighed softly, "It's not your fault. How could I ever blame you?"


Bianca looked deeply moved, her eyes filled with tears as she turned to Emily. "'Emily, how could you just hit someone like that? If you're angry, take it out on me. Ronnie was only trying to help me... I'm sorry, I didn't realize you hated me so much that you'd take it out on the people around me."


Emily sneered coldly, "You're right. You are the real culprit. So, are you admitting that the posts about me at school were orchestrated by Ronnie under your orders?"


A flash of panic crossed Bianca's eyes, but she quickly started crying. "What posts? What does Ronnie have to do with them? Are you really going to pin all these baseless accusations on him?"


Emily's eyes were icy as she suddenly pulled out several photos and flung them at Bianca. "Still denying it?" "Watch out!"

Ronnie thought Emily was going to hit Bianca and rushed over to shield her.

The photos grazed Ronnie's face,leaving a long scratch.

"Ronnie, your face!" Bianca exclaimed in shock when she saw the injury.


"Emily, what are you doing? Attacking someone at school!" Lavinia was alarmed when she saw Ronnie's injury. It happened right in her office. If Ronnie went back to the computer science department with that face,Glenn would surely blame her.


Emily's cold gaze was like winter frost as she looked at Lavinia. "I respect you as a teacher, which is why I've tolerated you repeatedly. Don't push your luck. Don't tell me you didn't see that he ran into the photos himself."


Lavinia was embarrassed by Emily's words. "You... you.., you..." She pointed at Emily's face, her eyes filled with venom. "Today, I'll teach you how to respect your elders!"


She raised her hand to slap Emily.


Bianca's pupils contracted, but a hint of excitement flashed in her eyes.


Ronnie's face remained cold, showing no sympathy.

Only Lily picked up the photos from the ground and began examining them. The more she looked, the more her brows furrowed, and her expression kept changing. But everyone else wastoo preoccupied to notice.


"Stop right there! Let's see who dares to bully my student." A commanding voice rang out from the doorway.

Kurt entered, followed by two others. "Mr.Owens!"


Lavinia wasn't very familiar with Kurt, but she couldn't afford not to recognize Bobby's face. Her attention immediately shifted to Bobby behind Kurt.


Lavinia quickly withdrew her hand and greeted them with a trembling voice.

"You were about to hit my student, weren't you?" Kurt questioned Lavinia coldly.


Emily was taken aback. She hadn't even joined the physics department yet, so when did she become his student?


Kurt winked and smiled at Emily. "From the moment you gave me those papers and research topics, you became my student."


Lavinia finally recognized Kurt. Her mind raced, and she realized Kurt's identity. Combining his words with Emily's phone call, Lavinia was shocked. Emily had actually managed to bring Kurt from the physics department.


But wasn't Kurt supposed to be eccentric, only valuing research and genius students? How did he take a liking to Emily?


"Kurt, you misunderstood. Emily is just too unruly. Are you really agreeing to let her transfer to your department?" Lavinia quickly suppressed her doubts and explained, "Emily has poor character. I don't know what methods she used to get your approval to transfer, but I still want to advise you to reconsider."


Kurt frowned. He didn't immediately question Emily. Instead, he defended her, "Are you saying I can't recognize talent? I find Emily smart and focused, not at all like the person you describe. Are you all bullying her,ganging up on her?"

Bianca, who also knew Kurt, was horrified by his and Emily's words. How could Emily successfully transfer to the physics department? She might be somewhat clever, but how could she gain Kurt's favor? Bianca felt something slipping out of her control, making her uneasy.


She quickly stepped forward to explain, "Mr. Lowe, you misunderstood. No one is bullying Emily. We're all concerned for her, trying to advise her not to skip classes and stay out late. We're worried about her, but she seems to reject our advice, which has led to some conflicts."


She skillfully shifted the blame onto Emily.


Ronnie chimed in, "Mr. Lowe, Emily is malicious. She even schemes against her own sister. Your research data is crucial. I think you shouldn't accept a student like her."


To add weight to his argument, he said, "There are posts on the school website about her malicious behavior..."


"Ronnie, stop talking."

Lavinia knew Emily had evidence and quickly intervened. She then addressed Kurt, "You heard it yourself.It's not me making things difficult for her. She has a bad nature, and everyone has a poor impression of her.It must be her fault."


Kurt frowned.

Emily clenched her fists but didn't speak immediately. She was observing Kurt's attitude.

Sure enough, he didn't disappoint her. He didn't immediately doubt her but asked, "What do you have to say?"


"If I tell the truth, will you stand up for me?" Emily deliberately asked.


Kurt's expression relaxed upon hearing this. He knew she must be innocent; otherwise, she wouldn't say that.

He smiled and turned to Bobby, "With Mr. Owens here, if you're right, you'll get justice. Right, Bobby?" Few people knew Bobby was actually his nephew. Even if Bobby weren't his nephew, given Kurt's patents and academic achievements, Bobby would still support him.


Bobby, whether willingly or not, had to respond authoriatively, "Speak freely. I won't favor anyone."
###Chapter 37 Prostitute?


"Mr. Owens, thank you. I feel a lot better. Someone posted some nasty stuff abouf me on the schooI forum.Even though it was anonymous, I tracked the IP address. With the timing and the details they had, it wasn't hard to figure out who it was."


Emily handed her phone to Bobby,showing him the post.

Kurt,just as anxious, leaned in to get a better look.

"This is insane! Who would do something like this to ruin a girl's reputation? Don't they get that this could mess up someone's future life?" Kurt exclaimed, realizing the post was about Emily.


He couldn't stand the thought of such a bright and talented student being driven to despair or worse,potentially losing a future physicist to such baseless slander.

"Here's the proof to clear my name."


Emily pulled out some photos and played a video on her laptop for Bobby and Kurt. The footage showed the people who had wronged her confessing and apologizing.

"How is this possible?"

Ronnie, the culprit, turned pale when Emily mentioned the post. He had been confident because Bianca had assured him it was foolproof.


But seeing the video, his first reaction was denial.

"You must have forced them to.give false confessions!" Ronnie insisted, still believing he was justified in posting what he did. Emily smirked at Ronnie. "Why are you so eager to accuse me again? Feeling guilty because you know you posted it?"


All eyes turned to Ronnie, filled with suspicion, surprise, and disappointment-none with admiration.

Bianca clenched her fists, glancing at Emily. How did she manage to gather all this evidence? Who could have helped her?


Ronnie instinctively wanted to deny it. "Of course not! Stop falsely accusing me!"


Bianca,sensing the tension, quickly intervened. "Emily, even if you had a disagreement with Ronnie, it's not right to accuse him like this. It harms our unity as classmates."


She turned to Bobby,speaking respectfully. "Mr. Owens, Emily might have acted impulsively because of the post. I apologize on her behalf. As her sister, I want justice for her, but I also hope the school can remove the post to minimize its impact and protect the school's reputation."


"I suggest we hold a seminar to discuss such issues."

Bianca aimed to divert attention and showcase her leadership qualities to Bobby.


Lavinia nodded approvingly. "Mr. Owens, Bianca's suggestion is excellent. She's always been a thoughtful and capable student. Let's entrust this matter to her."

Bianca felt a surge of excitement but kept her cool. "Ms. Chambers, I can try, but it'll need some planning."

Ronnie, trying to stay positive, added, "You're so capable, Bianca. I know you can pull it off."


Despite his anxiety about Bobby finding out about the post, Ronnie thought it was worth it for Bianca to shine.


However, Lily,usually Bianca's shadow,stayed silent. "Awareness is important, but let's not lose focus. Emily is the victim here. Ronnie, did you post it or not?Own up to it," Kurt demanded, sticking to logic and refusing to be sidetracked.


Bianca and Ronnie's faces darkened.

Curious students had gathered outside the office,eavesdropping.

Ronnie, feeling the pressure, wanted to deny it, but Kurt pressed on. "Be honest in front of Mr. Owens. If you lie, he can trace the IP address. The computer science department has plenty of talented grads who can help."

Kurt's words were a clear threat.

Ronnie's face grew more strained. Under Bobby's intense gaze, he finally admitted, "Yeah, I posted it. But she brought it on herself, acting like the Johnson family owed her and bullying Bianca."

He admitted his fault but tried to shift the blame to Emily.

Before Kurt could respond, Emily coldly challenged, "You claim I bullied her? Name the incidents and provide evidence. Otherwise, I could accuse you of soliciting prostitutes off-campus!"

"You're lying! What is your evidence? I did no such thing, Mr. Owens!" Ronnie protested, his face turning pale.

"See,you know better than to make baseless accusations. So, do you have any evidence?" Emily retorted with a smirk.

Ronnie opened his mouth but couldn't produce any evidence. He couldn't even admit that his accusations were based on Bianca's insinuations.

On second thought, Biaca did not actually use the exact words that Emily bullied her. He basically jumped to a conclusion with only her words. "No. I have no evidence." Ronnie admitted, lowering his head. "I'm sorry. It was my fault."

The surrounding students were shocked by Ronnie's confession.


"Why would Ronnie do this? Accusing a girl without evidence is cruel. What grudge does he have against her?"


"Better stay away from people like him. Who knows what he might say behind your back?"

"So,Emily was innocent all along?"

"Seems like it. She showed some evidence earlier," someone who had seen Emily's proof explained.

Some students who used to follow the wave and insult Emily now felt ashamed.


Bobby remained stern, looking at Emily. "Emily, now that the truth is out, what do you want to happen next?"


Ronnie clenched his fists, waiting for the verdict.

Lavinia, sensing Bobby's authority, didn't dare interrupt but shot Emily warning glances, urging her to be careful with her words.
###Chapter 38 Emily Is Targeted


"Ronnie needs to apologize to me in front of the whole school and face disciplinary action."

Emily's conditions were firm.

She didn't think she was being unreasonable at all.

Bianca frowned, trying to seem generous. "Emily, isn't that a bit much? Ronnie just messed up in the heat of the moment. You weren't really hurt, so why not let it slide this time? Just have him apologize and call it a day. If he gets disciplined, it could mess up his future. He's so talented; he should be the pride of the school."


She was speaking with the school's best interest in mind.

She couldn't believe Bobby would side with Emily.

If Emily disagreed, it would show she was narrow-minded.

This would only highlight Bianca's sense of fairness.


Of course, if Emily agreed, Ronnie would be grateful to Bianca, not Emily, which would mae Bianca more important in Ronnie's eyes.


"Alright!"

Emily smiled lightly, but there was someting unsettling about her smile.

Bianca didn't expect her to agree so quickly withouit even considering it. She was momentarily surprised but quickly rejoiced. "That's great! Emily, why don't you shake hands with Ronnie..."


"I agree, but you wvill take the punishment on Ronnie's behalf. How about that?" Bianca's smile froze on her face.


If she agreed, her academic record would be tarnished forever.


If she didn't agree, Ronnie might resent her over time.

Bianca's mind raced. "If you two can reconcile, I'm willing to do it. But I'm afraid this matter won't stay hidden, after all..."


She glanced at the students outside the door, as if to say, "Too many people know the truth."


Emily scoffed, cutting off Bianca's insincere words.′′Iyou can't do it, then stop wasting time. Ronnie,look at the person you're defending!"


"Ronnie, that's not what I meant..." Bianca hurriedly tried to grab Ronnie's hand.
;
He trembled slightly and stepped back, avoiding Bianca's hand.


"Mr. Owens, is myrequest acceptable?" Emily turned to Bobby, not wanting to waste more time with Bianca.


Kurt shot Bobby a warning glance.


Reminding him to be careful with his words.


Bobby was amused. Did they think he was that incompetent?

"Yes, that's the proper way to handle it. I'm sorry you had to go through this. The school will compensate you accordingly." Bobby nodded.


Emily nodded, not refusing. At that moment, her phone rang. Emily saw the caller ID and was surprised. She quickly answered the cafl.

"Mr. Smith, what can I do for you?"

Outside the school gate, in a parked Maybach, Daniel crossed his long legs, his cold face softeníng slightly as the call connected.

"Biscuit and Cloudy are sick and need to go to the hospital. I'm near your school for some business. Violette said you're at school. Do you want to go to the hospital together?"

His deep voice came through the phone.

"Sure, I'll be right there!"


Emily thought of how much Liam trusted her with Biscuit and couldn't let anything happen to them.She quickly agreed.


She hung up the phone and said goodbye to Bobby and Kurt.

She left the matter of transferring departments to Kurt.

Kurt had no objections.

Bobby had many things to handle, and he left after dealing with the situation.

Before leaving, Emily didn't spare Ronnie and Bianca another glance,

Ronnie would receive his punishment from Bobby.

Proud as he was, he had never experienced anything like this before.

He was visibly shaken, feeling disoriented. Bianca, on the other hand, thought she heard Emily mention Daniel on the phone.

No.it couldn't be Daniel!

She must have misheard.

Emily, a timid fool, couldn't possibly know someone like him.

Emily was unaware of Bianca's inner turmoil.

It was indeed Daniel.

If he was almost here, she couldn't keep him waiting.

"...Sorry,Emily!"

Emily had just left the office when she was almost bumped into by someone rushing towards her.

The person quickly apologized, anad upon realizing it was Emily, she didn't leave in a hurry.

She even checked Emily from head to toe to make sure she was okay before breathing a sigh of relief. "I heard you had a fight with Ms. Chambers and that Bianca and Ronnie were in the office too. I don't know the details, but anything involving Bianca is usually bad news. I'm glad you're okay."


"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for checking on me!"

Emily knew Sophia was a good person, but her immediate concern upon hearing it might involve her made Emily feel a bit strange.


"No need to be formal. Where are you headed? How about I treat you to lunch to calm your nerves? I have something to tell you." Sophia waved her hand, not caring at all, and looked at Emily expectantly.


Emily had something to do, so she had to decline. "Sorry, maybe another time. I have some things to take care of."


"Alright then!" Sophia looked a bt disappointed.


Seeing Sophia still following her, Emily asked, "You mentioned you had something to tell me. WVhat is it? If you don't mind, you can keep it brief."


Implying she didn't want a long conversation.


Sophia's already bright face lit up with joy. "Actually, I wanted to thank you. My mentor has been guiding me in painting these past few days, and I've made great progress. Mr. Williams recommended that I participate in the 'Canvas of Dreams' art exhibition."


Emily remembered the exhibition from her past life.


It was indeed an exhibition for newcomers, but all the participants were verytalented.


Sophia's participation meant she had reached a certain level of skill.


"Congratulations! It's notbecause of me; it's your talent that got you there." Emily didn't take credit.


Sophia felt warm inside hearing Emily's affirmation.


She then remembered something, and her expression turned serious.′′Ithink I saw Bianca's name on the list.But Bianca steals other people's work, which means she has no real talent. How could she participate?"


"Maybe it's someone with the same name, or I misread it."


Since it was just a quick glance, Sophia became less confident and could only guess. Emily knew Bianca well. She wouldn't miss such an opportunity to gain fame.

So,Sophia probably didn't misread it.

Emily's eyes darkened, and she asked, "Do you know who the organizer is this time?"

"I do. It's someone named Louis Cox." Sophia, being passionate about painting, had heard of many famous artists.


But Louis was a painting enthusiast who didn't actually paint.

Emily raised an eyebrow.

What a coincidence.


Because he was a painting enthusiast, he often visited John. When she was asked to take on a student. he happened to be there and became curious about her skills.


He then became her fan after she painted a piece for him.


Since her rebirth, she hadn't contacted him.

"Alright, you don't need to see me off. Go take care of youar business. I'll contact you another day and introduce you to an old friend!"


Emily suddenly noticed someone peeking at her from the school gate. When she looked over, the person quickly hid.


Clearly, they were there for her. Emily paused and spoke to Sophia.


Sophia didn't doubt her and nodded. After saying goodbye to Emily, she turned and walked towards the teaching building.
###Chapter 39 It Was Never Her Intention to Make Things Difficult

 
"Emily, hold up a sec!"

Emily saw Sophia leave and was about to head straight towards the person lurking in the shadows.

Suddenly,someone called out to her, panting heavily.

Emily recognized the voice, her expression turning icy, and kept walking without acknowledging it.


The person quickly stepped in front of Emily, blocking her path. "You heard me, why won't you stop?"

As she spoke, she stomped her foot, almost like she was throwing a tantrum.

Emily frowned, her eyes narrowing as she looked at her, as if to say, "Are you out of your mind?"

What's wrong with her? Acting cute to the person she didn't get along with?

"Emily,I'm sorry!"

Lily understood Emily's look, her face turning red with slight embarrassment.

But she bit her lip and mustered the courage to say it.

Emily's frown deepened,becoming more alert. "What kind of trick are you and Bianca planning now?Pretending to be nice to me and then stabbing me in the back?"


Lily's expression froze.

She hadn't expected her attempt at reconciliation to be misunderstood in this way. She was also pampered at home, and now she was being misunderstood even after admitting her mistake.

Lily's expression turned colder, and she huffed, "I don't have as many schemes as you. I came to apologize for misunderstanding you about Bianca's near accident last time."


Emily crossed her arms, looking at her leisurely. "I remember you were yelling at me in the office just now.
This sudden change makes me suspicious, doesn't it?"

Lily was momentarily speechless.


She pursed her lips and sincerely apologized, "I just saw the photos and videos and realized I misunderstood you. It was my mistake, and I apologize. But that doesn't mean you weren't wrong for bullying Bianca before.
Bianca is kind-hearted. If you just got along with her, you could be the best of friends."

Emily had always thought of Lily as Bianca's most loyal follower, and since she disliked Bianca, she also disliked Lily.


She hadn't expected Lily to have some sincerity.

It seemed like she was just another fool deceived by Bianca.


"I accept your apology. And for the record, it's never been me trying to make things difficult for her. That line won't work on me."


Emily said, then walked past Lily and left.

"...What does that mean?"


Lily was momentarily confused.

She reached out, wanting to stop Emily and ask for clarification. "Lily,why did you run off alone? Who were you talking to just now?" Bianca, realizing something was off with Lily, hurriedly chased after her with a bad feeling.


But she only saw Lily standing there, staring into the distance.


The figure walking away seemed to be Emily.

She quickly approached and grabbed Lily, asking.


"I just found out I misunderstood Emily, so I thought I should apologize and persuade her to get along with you."


Lily didn't hide anything and replied honestly.


Bianca's heart sank.

Lily, who had always disliked Emily, was starting to change her mind over one incident. This couldn't be happening.


Bianca's eyes reddened, feeling guilty."It's all my fault for being unwell these days and not knowing about the online stuff. By the time I found out and wanted to explain, it was too late. Emily probably thinks I did it and hates me even more."


Lily thought for a moment but didn't follow Bianca's lead. Instead, she advised, "Don't be sad. Maybe Emily didn't think that much. She probably isn't that petty. Maybe we misunderstood her. She accepted my apology just now."


"And when I suggested she get along with you, guess what she said? She said, 'It's never been me trying to make things difficult for her. I should be advising you."


"What does that mean? So, you think I'm the one making things difficult for her?" Bianca's face turned cold, unable to control her outburst.

She had always been gentle and soft-spoken.

This cold and hostile demeanor was something Lily had never seen before.

"I-I didn't mean that. Bianca, I just thought maybe you're too sensitive and misunderstood her hostility towards you."


Lily was scared, her voice trembling.

She even instinctively distanced herself from Bianca.


Bianca had been facing setbacks today, something she had never experienced before.

She wasn't naturally good-tempered, so she couldn't control her emotions and revealed her true feelings.


"Sorry, I was just afraid you'd think I'm a bad person. You know you're the friend I care about the most,and I'm scared of losing you, so I got so worked up."


Bianca quickly explained.


Lily,having been friends with her since childhood, immediately believed her.


She was deeply moved, seeing Bianca on the verge of tears, and hugged her, patting her back to comfort her.
"I know. I just want you two to get along so you don't have to be sad and sick every time."


"Thank you for understanding, Lily!" Bianca hugged her, her voice choked with emotion.


But her eyes, hidden from Lily's view, were cold and calculating.

Emily was becoming harder to deal with. What had happened to her recently?


Bianca thought of the phone call Emily made to Daniel. No matter what, she had to go and see for herself.

She hid her dark thoughts and released Lily.

Then she said. "Lily, wait for me. I'll go talkto Emily and let her know I genuinely want to get along."

"Okay, I'll wait for you!" Lily agreed without much thought.

Bianca let go of Lily and hurried to catch up with Emily.

Emily was almost at the hiding spot when her phone rang


"Mr. Smith, are you here?"

"I'm already at the school gate, by the roadside."

Daniel had seen Emily and thought she hadn't noticed his car, so he called to remind her.

As he spoke, he gave the driver a look.


The driver understood and rolled down the window.

Emily heard the call and turned to look at the roadside.

She saw a Maybach with its hazard lights on, signaling her.

The window rolled down.

Emily and Daniel locked eyes from a distance. His eyes were deep and dark, and when their gazes met, it felt like he was drawing her in completely.


Daniel!


Mysterious and intimidating.


Emily thought of the danger lurking nearby.


Daniel meant well, but she didn't want to put him in danger.


She stepped forward but didn't open the car door. Instead, she leaned on the window and looked at Daniel inside.


Her face, hidden in the shadows, added to the mystery.


"Mr. Smith, I'm sorry. Something came up, and I might be late. Could you give me an address, and I'11 come over later?"


Emily apologized.


Daniel's face, hidden in the shadows, was hard to read.


"Alright."


After a long pause.

Just when Emily thought he might be angry about her delay, she heard his concise reply.


Emily breathed a sigh of relief.

"See you later, Mr. Smith!" Emily waved and stepped back, turning to walk away.


At that moment, Bianca had already caught up.


She was about to call out to Emily, but saw her talking to someone in the Maybach and then turning to leave.

As Emily moved aside. the window slowly rolled up, and Bianca saw the cold, distant face inside.


Bianca's pupils contracted, her eyes widening.


How could it be him?
###Chapter 40 The Person I Don't Dare to Dream About, Why Does She Deserve It?
"Mr.Smith!"


Bianca whispered, still in disbelief.

She had once seen him from afar while tailing James. Even though it was a fleeting glimpse, she had been both awestruck and intimdated. She knew her own background and health issues, and someone like him was way out of her league. So, she had never entertained any unrealistic fantasies.


But now, seeing Emily actually talking to him...

No,it had to be a coincidence. Emily must have brazenly approached him. And look, Emily didn't get in the car and was sent away,right?


Bianca reassured herself with these thoughts. She watched Emily leave with a sullen expression, debating whether to approach and dig for information.


Then she noticed someone lurking around the corner where Emily was heading. Bianca's gloominess faded,replaced by a manic smile. She almost forgot about the call she had made earlier.


'Emily, you think you're so clever? Let's see how you handle this.'

"Come out!"


Emily had already walked up to the person watching her and spoke calmly.


"Iknew you'd notice us," said the leader, wearing a plain white T-shirt that didn't draw attention. As he stepped out, the others positioned themselves to block any escape routes for Emily. "Yeah, I noticed you. So let's cut to the chase, who sent you?" Emily asked in a steady voice.

The man chuckled, "I'll tell you, but only if you cooperate and come with us to that alley for some photos."He pointed to a narrow, deserted alley nearby, which was actually a dead end.

Emily showed no fear and replied calmly, "Alright, let's go."


The man, surprised by her compliance, didn't use force and led her to the alley. Soon, they reached the end of it.


Emily stopped walking. The men exchanged glances, some finding angles, others pulling out their phones.


"Take off your clothes," the man ordered with a smirk.

Emily's expression turned icy, "I never agreed to that."

The man, taken aback by her sudden defiance, scowled, "You don't have a choice."


His tone carried a threat, and he signaled his men to grab her. Emily's smile widened, but it didn't reach her eyes, "Is that so? I'll return those words to you."


The man frowned, not understanding her meaning. He thought she might be crazy. But soon, he realized what she meant.


Suddenly, he and his men couldn't move. Their limbs felt weak, and they collapsed to the ground.

"What did you do?" the man asked, terrified, looking at Emily. They hadn't seen her do anything, yet they were paralyzed.


Emily didn't want to make things too hard for them. "When I got close to you, I accidentally used a little drug. It's colorless and tasteless. Right now, it just makes you feel weak. In a bit, you'll feel normal again,but tonight, it'll feel like your bodies are being eaten by thousands of ants. Eventually, you'll develop sores, and your bodies will rot away. Don't bother going to a hospital; they won't find anything. I made sure of that."


The man's face turned pale with fear, and his followers began to panic, clearly terrified of dying.


"What do you want?" the man asked after a moment of internal struggle.


"That's simple. Take me to the person who sent you. I assume they want to use these photos to manipulate me. Otherwise, I'll meet them myself."

The man was surprised by Emily's intelligence.


Everything was under her control. Emily had a good idea of who was behind this.


"We can take you to him. We were supposed to bring you after taking the photos anyway. But can you give us the antidote first?" the man asked cautiously.


"Sure," Emily said without hesitation, "You can move now."


The men found they could move again. The man eyed her warily, "Aren't you afraid we'll harm you again?"

Emily smiled confidently, "You can try. Let's see if you're faster than me at using the drug."


The man shuddered, not daring to take the risk. As Emily followed them out of the alley, she didn't notice Daniel's car returning.


"Mr. Smith, should I follow them?" York, Daniel's driver and bodyguard, asked worriedly. As Daniel's driver and top bodyguard, a few regular men couldn't be his match. Also, he had noticed Daniel's growing interest in Emily over the past few days.


Daniel, rubbing his fingers, was about to get out of the car himself. York quickly stopped him, "Mr. Smith,you can't. The doctor said you shouldn't exert yourself to avoid the poison spreading." Emily had used acupuncture to contain the poison in Daniel's body, preventing it from spreading. She had given strict instructions.

Daniel frowned,"Move."


His calm voice was like the calm before a storm, compelling York to obey. Just as York was about to step aside. Daniel turned back and got into the car.


York was puzzled by Daniel's sudden change of mind. Daniel coldly instructed, "Gef in the car and follow them."


York got in, glancing at the alley. He saw Emily walking out unharmed, with the men who had surrounded her now acting strangely, as if they feared her.


"Interesting," Daniel murmured, a smile playing on his lips. York didn't catch his words but saw Daniel smiling through the rearview mirror.


"Mr. Smith, it looks like those men are afraid of Ms. Johnson," York remarked.


Daniel knew Emily wouldn't be easily controlled. "Good observation," he said.

York felt sort of weird when he heard Daniel's praise.

Then, Daniel reminded him again, "Keep your distance. She might notcie us."


York was puzzled. 'Who would notice? Ms. Johnson? Seriously?

But he didn't dare to question Daniel, so he focused on following the car, keeping a safe distance.


Soon, they arrived at Fortune Tower. Emily, seeing the building, confirmed her suspicion. It was the Reyes family. "Call Mr. Reyes and tell him I'm here to see him," she instructed.

The title of this book is"Prison of Fate" You can search for it in the search bar to find it!)
###Chapter 41 Seeing Such a "Good Show", She Was Too Calm
"Hello, Mr. Reyes, we got the person you asked for downstairs. Should I bring them up now?"


The man,hearing Emily's instructions, didn't dare to hesitate and immediately dialed Isaac's number.

Isaac frowned, "Why'd you bring them here without checking in first?"

The man replied nervously, "Sorry, Mr. Reyes, but this person has a really bad temper."

He wasn't exactly lying.

Emily was probably a proud and fiery person by nature.


After speaking, he sneaked a glance at Emily. Seeing no change in her expression, he breathed a sigh of relief.

"Alright, alright, bring them up. Take them to the waiting room first."


Isaac replied impatiently.


After hanging up, he arranged for his assistant to greet them and allowed the man in the T-shirt to bring Emily upstairs directly.


Isaac was confident that Emily had likely been forced to take compromising photos, so she wouldn't dare to speak out.

The man, having received confirmation, immediately informed Emily.


Emily then got out of the car and walked straight into Fortune Tower.


The man hurried to follow, leaving his entourage waiting in the car downstairs. This was his way of ensuring that if anything happened, they would stiIl have a chance to escape.


Thanks to Isaac's assistant, they encountered no obstacles.


Emily reached the sixteenth floor and, as soon as she stepped out of the elevator, she began to act uncontrollably.


When the assistant led her towards the waiting room, she headed straight for the CEO's office.


"Hey, miss, the waiting room is this way. Mr. Reyes is currently busy and needs you to wait... Hey, slow down!" The assistant didn't expect Emily to move so quickly.


Before he could finish his reminder, Emily had already walked several feet away, almost reaching Isaac's office.


When Emily's hand was on the door handle, the assistant's face turned pale with fear.

Isaac was "very busy" at the moment, and any interruption could spell trouble for him.


"Stop!" The assistant shouted urgently.


Instantly, everyone in the CEO's office froze and looked in his direction.


Despite this, Emily's actions didn't stop.


The assistant's face turned even paler as he turned to the man, "Who is this girl? How could you let her act so recklessly here? Make her stop immediately."


The man could only shrug helplessly and continue following Emily.

Soon,he understood why the assistant was so panicked. "Get out! Who let you in?"


As the office door opened, a woman with a bare upper body was sitting in the lap of a middle-aged man.

The man's shirt was half-open.

It was clear what was happening here.

The woman screamed in shock at the sudden intrusion, quickly got up from Isaac's lap, grabbed her clothes.and turned her back to Emily and the others to get dressed.


Isaac, almost losing his composure due to the interruption, angrily cursed without caring who had entered.

Emily, unfazed, calmly walked in and found a seat. "I heard Mr. Reyes wanted to see me? Are you planning to talk to me dressed like that?"


Her tone was casual, with a hint of indifference.

There was no trace of shyness.


Isaac knew of Emily, but he had always heard she was a timid, insecure, and foolish girl picked up from the streets.


Seeing her now, he realized the rumors might be false.


Isaac glared at the assistant who had entered after Emily, then began to put on his clothes.

The woman, now dressed, hurriedly left the room under Issaac's order without looking at anyone.


Isaac turned to his assistant, "Dax, get out and close the door!"

Isaac cleared the room, then leaned back in his chair, hands on the armrests, lazily observing Emily. "You've certainly surprised me. You should know why I wanted to see you, right?"

Isaac's eyes flashed with anger as he thought of Byron's excruciating pain.

Initially, he thought Byron was faking it to force him to deal with Emily.

But after several days of Byron writhing in pain, visibly losing weight, and his cheekbones protruding, he believed Byron was truly suffering.


He had no idea what Emily had done, and even doctors couldn't figure it out.

"Of course! I know what you want, Mr. Reyes, but it seems you don't know what I want." Emily replied sweetly, with a smile.


Isaac felt a twinge of fear.
S
Something was off about Emily's attitude. Any other girl in her situation would be panicking.

Isaac shot a sharp look at the man, silently asking what was going on.


"You don't need to glare at him. If Mr. Reyes wants to talk business, why make it so complicated? I don't appreciate your methods. So,the upcoming negotiations might cost you."


Emily answered Isaac's unspoken question.

Isaac understood.

The photos hadn't worked, and now she had come to confront him directly.


He cursed the man for being useless, unable to handle one girl despite having a team of skilled fighters.

Isaac's expression hardened, and he sat up straight, abandoning his previous laziness. He picked up a pen from the desk, seemingly playing with it.

"What did you do to Byron? Tell me your terms as longas you make him recover, and I'll meet them. He's my only son, set to inherit the Reyes Group. I'll fulfill any reasonable condition."


Isaac's tone softened, becoming unusually agreeable.


The change was so sudden that the man beside him noticed and glanced at him twice.

Emily chuckled innocently, "Mr. Reyes, I don't understand what you're saying. I heard Byron wasn't well,and since you have a partnership with the Johnson family, I thought I'd offer my medical expertise. As for terms,it's just the medical fee."


She glanced at the pen in Isaac's hand.

It wasn't an ordinary pen, bout a recording device.


Issaac seemed to be playing with the pen, but he was actually recording everything.


Though it seemed casual, Emily had seen it before in her past life. She noticed the brief flash of red light.

She wouldn't fall for it easily.


If she had agreed to Isaac's terms and if she didn't treat Byron today, she could be accused of multiple crimes.


Isaac,seeing she wasn't falling for it, grew angry.


He slammed his hand on the desk, glaring at Emily, "You tricked my men into not taking your photos.I'll call that a smart move. But you are stupid enough to show your face here, in our territory. If you don't treat Byron today, you won't make it out of the Reyes Group!"
###Chapter 42 In Her Pocket
"Really? Well, let's see if you can stop me."

Emily stood up, showing no sign of panic, and even dared to throw out a challenge. "Mr. Reyes, I hope you won't regret this."


With that, she turned to leave.


"Stop her!"

Isaac ordered his men.

The men were too scared to move, feeling extremely uneasy.

Isaac should have known better. If he didn't dare to touch her, she must have some extraordinary skills.

Why was Isaac still so impulsive?

"Mr. Reyes, maybe you should calm down and have a proper talk with Ms. Johnson!"

"Get lost, you traitor." Isaac kicked the man over and dialed Dax and security.

Soon,people arrived.

Emily raised her phone. "If you try to stop me, I'll call the police."

Seeing his men blocking the office door, Isaac wasn't afraid anymore. He sneered, "I've had the signal blocked.Do you think your call will go through?"

He finished speaking and looked at Emily, waiting to see fear on her face. But Emily just smiled. "Really? Then your signal blocker is pretty useless."


She pressed the emergency call button and put it on speaker.

Soon,the call connected.

"Hang up! Hang up!"

Isaac's face changed. He couldn't understand how she did it.


"Now, can we talk properly? Or should I remind you that you might start feeling weak and unable to stand?"

She didn't need to say it.

As soon as she did, Isaac actually felt it.

At first, he told himself it was just psychological.

But soon, his hands started trembling, followed by his legs.

He stumbled and fell into a chair.

"What did you do? Poison? Do you realize this could land you in jail?" Isaac was still struggling, but his face was pale, clearly unsure.


"You tried to capture me and take photos. I'm not afraid. Besides, they won't find anything."

The man saw Isaac realizing Emily's danger and desperately winked at him.

Surprisingly, Isaac understood.

He slumped on the sofa. "Alright, name your terms." Emily was prepared.

She opened her phone and sent the documents and contract she had ready to Isaac.

Isaac wasn't even shocked that she knew his private email. He opened and read them.


"No way. Byron isn't worth that much. I could just abandon Byron. I'm not too old to train a new heir."


Isaac didn't want to compromise.

Emily hadn't expected to threaten him with only poison from the very beginning.

She was just stating facts.′′For your information, while your age doesn't affect fertility, your health does. If any of your mistresses claim to be pregnant, get a paternity test."

Having seen her silent drugging, Isaac strangely believed her.

Emily gave Isaac time to think.

"I can give you shares, half of Byron's shares, as medical expenses. But why do you want to lead the Johnson Group project?"


Could it be she wanted to prove to the Johnson family she was capable?

No matter how strong she was, she was still a girl longing for love.

If Byron could charm her...

Isaac's eyes gleamed.

"That's none of your business! If you agree, print the documents and contract, sign them, and I'll go treat Byron immediately." Emily didn't care what Isaac was planning, as long as it didn't affect her interests.

But her patience was limited, and it showed on her face. "You have five minutes to decide,"


Isaac was furious.


In the end, he had to compromise and then called his assistant in. "Print these documents and the contract and bring them in."


"Yes, sir!" Dax expected a fierce fight.


But the office was suddenly quiet.

When called in, it was surprisingly peaceful.


He was shocked, suppressing his curiosity, and quickly printed the documents.

"Now, can you make me feel normal again?" Isaac's hands were still trembling.


Emily approached,pressed a spot on his neck, and flicked her fingers.


Isaac smelled a faint fragrance and instinctively took a deep breath.

His hands quickly returned to normal.


Having witnessed her mysterious skills, Isaac's attitude softened.


"Sit and wait. Once the contract is signed, you'll come with me to the Reyes Villa to treat Byron!" Isaac said.


Emily didn't respond immediately, but asked, "Mr. Reyes, how did you know I went to the school? Did Bianca tell you?" Isaac's eyes flickered. "Your father couldn't reach you, so I had others keep an eye out. I heard you were good to Bianca, so I thought I could get clues from her. It worked."


Emily was amused by Isaac's shamelessness.

He wanted to see her and Bianca fight.

But he didn't need to bother.

Bianca wouldn't stop causing trouble.

She and Bianca were destined to be at odds.

In this life, she would slowly destroy everything Bianca prided herself on. The more Bianca feared something.the more she would do it.


Soon,the assistant brought the documents.

Both parties quickly signed the contract.

Dax couldn't stop glancing at Emily.

He had seen the harsh terms of the contract and wondered what Emily did to make Isaac agree.

But no matter how long he looked, he wouldn't find the answer.

"Let's go treat Byron!" Isaac said eagerly.

Emily nodded and got up to leave.
 Seeing the caller, he instinctively straightened up and answered with a respectful smile, "What can E do for you?"


Emily paused.


She turned to see Isaac's obsequious demeanor.


Her eyes flashed with curiosity. Who was on the other end?


Someone who could make Isaac act like this.

"Yes,yes, I'll come down to greet you. No need, I'll have someone let you in."


Isaac wiped nonexistent sweat from his forehead, nodded, and hung up.


He immediately called the internal line.


Then he had Dax quickly tidy the office while he fixed his clothes and hair.


After all that, he hurried out, seemingly to greet someone.


As he passed Emily, he remembered her.

"Emily, I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait a bit. You can wait in the lounge."


He couldn't focus on Emily now, so he quickly left for the elevator.


Emily didn't go to the lounge but followed him to the elevator out of curiosity.


Just as she arrived, the elevator doors opened.

Emily looked up and saw Daniel's sharp,handsome face.
Just then, Isaac's phone rang. Her heart skipped a beat!


What was he doing here?
###Chapter 43

"Dammit..." Ronnie muttered angrily.

He held back when he noticed Bianca was still there.

Bianca was hoping Emily and Ronnie would start a fight.After all, Ronnie had plenty of women who secretly admired him. Plus, he was Glenn's prized student, and Bianca knew Glenn was fiercely protective. If Emily offended Ronnie, it was like offending Glenn.

"Ronnie, are you okay? I'm sorry, it's my fault. If you want to blame someone, blame me!" Bianca anxiously tried to check where Ronnie had been hit.

She reached out to touch Ronnie's face but quickly pulled her hand back, realizing it was inappropriate.She hurriedly apologized.

Ronnie's anger dissipated immediately because of Bianca's words. He sighed softly, "It's not your fault.How could I ever blame you?"
Bianca looked deeply moved, her eyes filled with tears as she turned to Emily. "Emily, how could you just hit someone like that? If you're angry, take it out on me.Ronnie was only trying to help me... I'm sorry, I didn't realize you hated me so much that you'd take it out on the people around me." Emily sneered coldly, "You're right. You are the real culprit. So, are you admitting that the posts about me at school were orchestrated by Ronnie under your orders?"

A flash of panic crossed Bianca's eyes, but she quickly starte d crying. "What posts? What does Ronnie have to do with them? Are you really going to pin all these baseless accusations on him?"

Emily's eyes were icy as she suddenly pulled out several photos and flung them at Bianca. "Still denying it?"

"Watch out!"

Ronnie thought Emily was going to hit Bianca and rushed over to shield her.

The photos grazed Ronnie's face, leaving a long scratch.

"Ronnie, your face!" Bianca exclaimed in shock when she saw the injury.

"Emily, what are you doing? Attacking someone at school!"Lavinia was alarmed when she saw Ronnie's injury. It happened right in her office. If Ronnie went back to the computer science department with that face, Glenn would surely blame her.

Emily's cold gaze was like winter frost as she looked at Lavinia. "I respect you as a teacher, which is why I've tolerated you repeatedly. Don't push your luck. Don't tell me you didn't see that he ran into the photos himself."

Lavinia was embarrassed by Emily's words."You...you... you..." She pointed at Emily's face, her eyes filled with venom. "Today, I'll teach you how to respect your elders!"

She raised her hand to slap Emily.

Bianca's pupils contracted, but a hint of excitement flashed in her eyes. Ronnie's face remained cold, showing no sympathy.

Only Lily picked up the photos from the ground and began examining them. The more she looked, the more her brows furrowved, and her expression kept changing.But everyone else was too preoccupied to notice.

"Stop right there! Let's see who dares to bully my student."A commanding voice rang out from the doorway.

Kurt entered,followed by two others.

"Mr.Owens!"

Lavinia wasn't very familiar with Kurt, but she couldn't afford not to recognize Bobby's face. Her attention immediately shifted to Bobby behind Kurt.

Lavinia quickly withdrew her hand and greeted them with a trembling voice.

"You were about to hit my student, weren't you?" Kurt questioned Lavinia coldly.

Emily was taken aback. She hadn't even joined the physics department yet, so when did she become his student?

Kurt winked and smiled at Emily.′′F1rom the moment you gave me those papers and research topics, you became my student."

Lavinia finally recognized Kurt. Her mind raced, and she realized Kurt's identity. Combining his words with Emily's phone call, Lavinia was shocked. Emily had actually managed to bring Kurt from the physics department.

But wasn't Kurt supposed to be eccentric, only valuing research and genius students? How did he take a liking to Emily?

"Kurt, you misunderstood. Emily is just too unruly. Are you really agreeing to let her transfer to your department?"Lavinia quickly suppressed her doubts and explained,"Emily has poor character. I don't know what methods she used to get your approval to transfer, but I still want to advise you to reconsider."

Kurt frowned. He didn't immnediately question Emily.Instead, he defended her, "Are you saying I can't recognize talent? I find Emily smart and focused, not at all like the person you describe. Are you all bullying her,ganging up on her?"

Bianca, who also knew Kurt, was horrified by his and Emily's words. How could Emily successfully transfer to the physics department? She might be somewhat clever,but how could she gain Kurt's favor? Bianca felt something slipping out of her control, making her uneasy.

She quickly stepped forward to explain, "Mr. Lowe, you misunderstood. No one is bullying Emily. We're all concerned for her, trying to advise her not to skip classes and stay out late. We're worried about her, but she seems to reject our advice, which has led to some conflicts."

She skillfully shifted the blame onto Emily.

Ronnie chimed in, "Mr. Lowe, Emily is malicious.She even schemes against her own sister. Your research data is crucial. I think you shouldn't accept a student like her."

To add weight to his argument, he said, "There are posts on the school website about her malicious behavior..."

"Ronnie, stop talking."

Lavinia knew Emily had evidence and quickly intervened.She then addressed Kurt, "You heard it yourself. It's not me makingthings difficult for her. She has a bad nature,and everyone has a poor impression of her. It must be her fault."

Kurt frowned. Emily clenched her fists but didn't speak immediately.She was observing Kurt's attitude.Sure enough, he didn't disappoint her. He didn't immediately doubt her but asked, "What do you have to say?" "If I tell the truth, will you stand up for me?" Emily deliberately asked.

Kurt's expression relaxed upon hearing this. He knew she must be innocent; otherwise, she wouldn't say that.

He smiled and turned to Bobby, "With Mr. Owens here, if you're right, you'll get justice. Right, Bobby?"

Few people knew Bobby was actually his nephew. Even if Bobby weren't his nephew, given Kurt's patents and academic achievements, Bobby would still support him.

Bobby, whether willingly or not, had to respond authoritatively, "Speak freely. I won't favor anyone."
###Chapter 44
"Mr. Owens, thank you. I feel a lot better. Someoneposted some nasty stuff about me on the school forum.Even though it was anonymous, I tracked the IP address.With the timing and the details they had, it wasn't hard tofigure out who it was."
Emily handed her phone to Bobby, showing him the post
Kurt, just as anxious, leaned in to get a better look
"This is insane! Who would do something like this to ruina girl's reputation? Don't they get that this could mess upsomeone's future life?" Kurt exclaimed, realizing the postwas about Emily.
He couldn't stand the thought of such a bright andtalented student being driven to despair or worse.potentially losing a future physicist to such baselessslander.
"Here's the proof to clear my name.
Emily pulled out some photos and plaved a video on herlaptop for Bobby and Kurt. The footage showed thepeople who had wronged her confessing and apologizing
"How is this possible?'
Ronnie, the culprit, turned pale when Emily mentionedthe post. He had been confident because Bianca had assured him it was foolproof.
But seeing the video, his first reaction was denial.
You must have forced them to give false confessions!"Ronnie insisted, still believing he was justified in postingwhat he did.
Emily smirked at Ronnie. "Why are you so eager toaccuse me again? Feeling guilty because you know youposted it?"
All eyes turned to Ronnie, filled with suspicion, surpriseand disappointment-none with admiration.
Bianca c瑝棋塘enched her fists, glancing at Emily. How did shemanage to gather all this evidence? Who could havehelp羯Ⓚ迟韋彧险d騍闸 カ頎葭枱吿考琓蕪咲撤r?
Ronnie instinctively wanted to deny it, "Of course not!Stop falsely accusing me!"
Bianca, sensing the tension, quickly intervened. "Emily.even if you had a disagreement with Ronnie, it's not rightto accuse him like this. It harms our unity as classmates.
She turned to Bobby,speaking respectfully."Mr.OwensEmily might have acted impulsively because of the post. Iapologize on her behalf. As her sister,I want iustice forher, but I also hope the school can remove the post tominimize its impact and protect the school's reputation.
"I suggest we hold a seminar to discuss such issues Bianca aimed to divert attention and showcase herleadership qualities to Bobby.
Lavinia nodded approvingly."Mr.Owens, Bianca'ssuggestion is excellent. She's always been a thoughtful andcapable student. Let's entrust this matter to her.
Bianca felt a surge of excitement but kept her cool. "Ms.
Chambers, I can try, but it'll need some planning.
R釵暇艺涕芭滞影氣誼哺ăđ牍闆綫绿ie髏抑所 ︶礞鞨贗珝狁¹田ing to stay positive, added, "You're so capable,Bianca.I know you can pull it off."
Despite his anxiety about Bobby finding out about thepost, Ronnie thought it was worth it for Bianca to shine.
However,Lily,usually Bianca's shadow, staved silent
Awareness is important, but let's not lose focus. Emily isthe victim here. Ronnie, did you post it or not? Own up toit," Kurt demanded, sticking to logic and refusing to besidetracked.
Bianca and Ronnie's faces darkened
Curび劳ious students had gathered outside the office.
eavesdropping.
Ronnie,feeling the pressure, wanted to deny it. but Kurtpressed on."Be honest in front of Mr. Owens. If you lie.he can trace the IP address. The computer sciencedepartment has plenty of talented grads who can help Kurt's words were a clear threat.
Ronnie's face grew more strained. Under Bobby's intensegaze, he finally admitted, "Yeah, I posted it. But shebrought it on herself, acting like the lohnson family owedher and bullying Bianca.
He admitted his fault but tried to shift the blame to Emily
Before Kurt could respond, Emily coldly challenged, "Youclaim I bullied her? Name the incidents and provideevi苽响雾e瑨媂錕禪≧豎馥鶩仈狗a犍进Otherwise,I could accuse you of solicitingprostitutes off-campus!"
"You're lying! What is your evidence? I did no such thing.
Mr.Owens!" Ronnie protested, his face turning pale.
'See, you know better than to make baseless accusations.So, do you have any evidence?" Emily retorted with asmi髟鹺矢颼猥伙顧
Ronnie opened his mouth but couldn't produce anyevidence. He couldn't even admit that his accusationswere based on Bianca's insinuations.
On second thought, Biaca did not actually use the exactwords th餡at Emily bullied her. He basically jumped to aconclusion with only her words
'No.I have no evidence." Ronnie admitted, lowering hishead. "I'm sorry. It was my fault."
The surrounding students were shocked by Ronnie's confession.
"Why would Ronnie do this? Accusing a girl withoutevidence is cruel. What grudge does he have against her?
'Better stay away from people like him. Who knows whathe might say behind your back?"
'So, Emily was innocent all along?
Seems like it.She showed some evidence earlier.
someone who had seen Emily's proof explained.
Some students who used to follow the wave and insultEmily now felt ashamed.
Bobby remained stern, looking at Emily."Emily, now thatthe truth is out, what do you want to happen next?"
Ronnie clenched his fists, waiting for the verdict.
Lavinia,sensing Bobby's authority, didn't dare interruptbut shot Emily warning glances, urging her to be carefulwith her words.
###Chapter 45
"Ronnie needs to apologize to me in front of the wholeschool and face disciplinary action.
Emily's conditions were firm.
She didn't think she was being unreasonable at all.
Bianca frowned,trying to seem generous."Emily. isn'tthat a bit much? Ronnie iust messed up in the heat of themoment. You weren't really hurt, so why not let it slidethis time? Just have him apologize and call it a day. If hegets disciplined, it could mess up his future. He's sotalented; he should be the pride of the school.'
She was speaking with the school's best interest in mind
She couldn't believe Bobby would side with Emily
If Emily disagreed, it would show she was narrow-minded.
This would only highlight Bianca's sense of fairness.
Of course, if Emily agreed, Ronnie would be grateful toBianca, not Emily, which would make Bianca moreimportant in Ronnie's eyes.
"Alright!"
Emily smiled lightly, but there was something unsettlingabout her smile. Bianca didn't expect her to agree so quickly without evenconsidering it. She was momentarily surprised but quicklrejoiced."That's great! Emily, why don't you shake handswith Ronnie...
"I agree, but you will take the punishment on Ronnie'sbehalf. How about that?"
Bianca旉崋s菘∥祆蘧smile froze on her face.
If she agreed, her academic record would be tarnishedforever.
If she didn't agree, Ronnie might resent her over time.
Bianca's mind raced."If you two can reconcile, I'm willingto do it. But I'm afraid this matter won't stay hidden.after all..."
She glanced at the students outside the door, as if to say,Too many people know the truth."
Emily scoffed, cutting off Bianca's insincere words. "Ifyou can't do it, then stop wasting time. Ronnie, look at theperson you're defending!
"Ronnie, that's not what I meant..." Bianca hurriedly triedto grab Ronnie's hand.
He trembled slightly and stepped back, avoiding Bianca'shand.
"Mr. Owens, is my request acceptable?" Emily turned to 鰱垸看obby,not wanting to waste more time with Bianca
Kurt shot Bobby a warning glance.
Reminding him to be careful with his words.
Bobby was amused. Did they think he was thatincompetent?
"Yes, that's the proper way to handle it. I'm sorry youhad to go through this. The school will compensate youaccordingly." Bobby nodded.
Emily nodded, not refusing.
At that moment, her phone rang.
Emily saw the caller ID and was surprised. She quicklyanswered the call.
"Mr. Smith, what can I do for you?
Outside the school gate, in a parked Maybach, Danielcrossed his long legs, his cold face softening slightly as thecall connected.
"Biscuit and Cloudy are sick and need to go to thehospital. I'm near your school for some business. Violettesaid you're at school. Do you want to go to the hospitaltogether?"
His deep voice came through the phone. 'Sure, I'll be right there!'
Emily thought of how much Liam trusted her withBiscuit and couldn't let anything happen to them. Shequickly agreed.
She hung up the phone and said goodbye to Bobby andKurt.
She left the matter of transferring departments to Kurt.
Kurt had no obiections.
Bobby had many things to handle, and he left afterdealing with the situation.
Before leaving, Emily didn't spare Ronnie and Biancaanother glance.
Ronnie would receive his punishment from Bobby.
Proud as he was, he had never experienced anything likethis before.
He was visibly shaken, feeling disoriented.
Bianca,on the other hand,thought she heard Emilymention Daniel on the phone.
No, it couldn't be Daniel!
She must have misheard. Emily, a timid fool, couldn't possibly know someone likehim.
###Chapter 46
Emily was unaware of Bianca's inner turmoil.
It was indeed Daniel.
If he was almost here, she couldn't keep him waiting.
"...Sorry, Emily!"
Emily had just left the office when she was almost bumped into bysomeone rushing towards her.
The person quickly apologized, and upon realizing it was Emily, she didnt leave in a hurry.
She even checked Emily from head to toe to make sure she was okaybefore breathing a sigh of relief. "I heard you had a fight with Ms.Chambers and that Bianca and Ronnie were in the office too. I don't knowthe details, but anything involving Bianca is usually bad news. I'm gladyou're okay."
"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for checking on me!
Emily knew Sophia was a good person, but her immediate concern uponhearing it might involve her made Emily feel a bit strange.
"No need to be formal. Where are you headed? How about I treat you tolunch to calm your nerves? I have something to tell you.'
Sophia waved her hand, not caring at all, and looked at Emily expectantly
Emily knew Sophia was a good person, but her immediate concern uponhearing it might involve her made Emily feel a bit strange.
"No need to be formal. Where are you headed? How about I treat you tolunch to calm your nerves? I have something to tell you.'
Sophia waved her hand, not caring at all, and looked at Emily expectantly
Emily had something to do, so she had to decline. "Sorry, maybe another time I have some things to take care of."
'Alright then!" Sophia looked a bit disappointed.
Seeing Sophia still following her, Emily asked, "You mentioned you hadsomething to tell me. What is it? If you don't mind, you can keep it brief.
Implying she didn't want a long conversation.
Sophia's already bright face lit up with joy. "Actually, I wanted to thankyou. My mentor has been guiding me in painting these past few days, andI've made great progress. Mr, Williams recommended that I participate inthe Canvas of Dreams art exhibition.
Emily remembered the exhibition from her past life.
It was indeed an exhibition for newcomers, but all the participants werevery talented.
Sophia's participation meant she had reached a certain level of skill.
"Congratulations! It's not because of me; it's your talent that got you there.
Emily didn't take credit.
Sophia felt warm inside hearing Emily's affirmation
She then remembered something, and her expression turned serious. "Ithink I saw Bianca's name on the list. But Bianca steals other people'swork, which means she has no real talent. How could she participate?"
"Maybe it's someone with the same name, or I misread it."
Since it was just a quick glance, Sophia became less confident and couldonly guess.
Emily knew Bianca well. She wouldn't miss such an opportunity to gainfame.
So, Sophia probably didn't misread it.
Emily's eyes darkened, and she asked, "Do you know who the organizer isthis time?"
"I do. It's someone named Louis Cox." Sophia, being passionate aboutpainting, had heard of many famous artists.
But Louis was a painting enthusiast who didn't actually paint. Emily raised an eyebrow.
What a coincidence.
Because he was a painting enthusiast, he often visited John. When she wasasked to take on a student, he happened to be there and became curiousabout her skills.
He then became her fan after she painted a piece for him.
Since her rebirth, she hadn't contacted him.
'Alright, you don't need to see me off. Go take care of your business. I'llcontact you another day and introduce you to an old friend!"
Emily suddenly noticed someone peeking at her from the school gate.
When she looked over, the person quickly hid.
Clearly, they were there for her. Emily paused and spoke to Sophia
Sophia didn't doubt her and nodded. After saying goodbye to Emily, sheturned and walked towards the teaching building.
###Chapter 47
"Emily, hold up a sec!'
Emily saw Sophia leave and was about to head straight towards theperson lurking in the shadows.
Suddenly someone called out to her, panting heavily.
Emily recognized the voice, her expression turning icy, and kept walking with out acknowledging it.
The person quickly stepped in front of Emily, blocking her path. "Youheard me, why won't you stop?"
As she spoke, she stomped her foot, almost like she was throwing atantrum.
Emily frowned, her eyes narrowing as she looked at her, as if to say, "Areyou out of your mind?"
What's wrong with her? Acting cute to the person she didn't get alongwith?’
"Emily, I'm sorry!
Lily understood Emily's look, her face turning red with slightembarrassment.
But she bit her lip and mustered the courage to say it.
Emily's frown deepened, becoming more alert. "What kind of trick are youand Bianca planning now? Pretending to be nice to me and then stabbingme in the back?"
Lily's expression froze.
She hadn't expected her attempt at reconciliation to be misunderstood inthis way
She was also pampered at home, and now she was being misunderstoodeven after admitting her mistake.
Lily's expression turned colder, and she huffed, "I don't have as manyschemes as you.I came to apologize for misunderstanding you aboutBianca's near accident last time.
Emily crossed her arms, looking at her leisurely. "I remember you wereyelling at me in the office just now. This sudden change makes mesuspicious, doesn't it?"
Lily was momentarily speechless
She pursed her lips and sincerely apologized, " just saw the photos andvideos and realized I misunderstood you. It was my mistake, and Iapologize. But that doesn't mean you weren't wrong for bullying Biancabefore, Bianca is kind-hearted, If you just got along with her, you could bethe best of friends."
Emily had always thought of Lily as Bianca's most loyal follower, andsince she disliked Bianca, she also disliked Lily.
She hadn't expected Lily to have some sincerity,
It seemed like she was iust another fool deceived by Bianca.
"I accept your apology. And for the record, it's never been me trying tomake things difficult for her. That line won't work on me.'
Emily said, then walked past Lily and left."...What does that mean?"
Lily was momentarily confused.
She reached out, wanting to stop Emily and ask for clarification.
"Lily, why did you run off alone? Who were you talking to just now?"Bianca, realizing something was off with Lily, hurriedly chased after herwith a bad feeling. Bu勧斯 she only saw Lily standing there, staring into the distance.
The figure walking away seemed to be Emily.
She quickly approached and grabbed Lily, asking.
"I just found out I misunderstood Emily, so I thought l should apologizeand persuade her to get along with you."
Lily didn't hide anything and replied honestly.
Bianca's īheart sank.
Lily, who had always disliked Emily, was starting to change her mind overone incident. This couldn't be happening.
Bianca's eyes reddened, feeling guilty. "It's all my fault for being unwellthese days and not knowing about the online stuff. By the time I foundout and wanted to explain, it was too late. Emily probably thinks I did itand hates me even more.'
Lily thought for a moment but didn't follow Bianca's lead. Instead, sheadvised, "Don't be sad. Maybe Emily didn't think that much. She probablyisn't that petty. Maybe we misunderstood her. She accepted my apologyjust now."
"And when I suggested she get along with you, guess what she said? Shesaid, 'It's never been me trying to make things difficult for her. l should beadvising you."
"What does that mean? So, you think I'm the one making things difficultfor her?"
Bianca's face turned cold, unable to control her outburst.
She had always been gentle and soft-spoken.
This cold and hostile demeanor was something Lily had never seen before.
"[-I didn't mean that. Bianca, I just thought maybe you're too sensitive
and misunderstood her hostility towards you.'
Lily was scared, her voice trembling.
She even instinctively distanced herself from Bianca.
Bianca had been facing setbacks today, something she had neverexperienced before.
She wasn't naturally good-tempered, so she couldn't control her emotionsand revealed her true feelings.
'Sorry, I was just afraid you'd think I'm a bad person. You know you'rethe friend I care about the most, and I'm scared of losing you, so I got soworked up.'
Bianca quickly explained.
Lily, having been friends with her since childhood, immediately believed her.
She was deeply moved, seeing Bianca on the verge of tears, and huggedher, patting her back to comfort her. "I know. I just want you two to getalong so you don't have to be sad and sick every time."
"Thank you for understanding, Lily!" Bianca hugged her, her voice chokedwith emotion.
But her eyes, hidden from Lily's view, were cold and calculating.
Emily was becoming harder to deal with.
What had happened to her recently?
Bianca thought of the phone call Emily made to Daniel. No matter what.
she had to go and see for herself.
She hid her dark thoughts and released Lily.
Then she said, "Lily, wait for me. I'l go talk to Emily and let her know I genuinely want to get along.
"Okay, I'll wait for you!" Lily agreed without much thought.
Bianca let go of Lily and hurried to catch up with Emily.
Emily was almost at the hiding spot when her phone rang.
'Mr. Smith, are you here?"I'm already at the school gate, by the roadside."
Daniel had seen Emily and thought she hadn't noticed his car, so he calledto remind her.
As he spoke, he gave the driver a look
The driver understood and rolled down the window.
Emily heard the call and turned to look at the roadside.
She saw a Maybach with its hazard lights on, signaling her.
The window rolled down.
Emily and Daniel locked eyes from a distance.
His eyes were deep and dark, and when their gazes met, it felt like he wasdrawing her in completely.
Daniel!
Mysterious and intimidating.
Emily thought of the danger lurking nearby.
Daniel meant well, but she didn't want to put him in danger.
She stepped forward but didn't open the car door. Instead, she leaned onthe window and looked at Daniel inside.
Her face, hidden in the shadows, added to the mystery.
"Mr. Smith, I'm sorry. Something came up, and I might be late. Could yougive me an address, and I'll come over later?"
Emily apologized.
Daniel's face, hidden in the shadows, was hard to read.
"Alright."
After a long pause.
Just when Emily thought he might be angry about her delay, she heard hisconcise reply.
Emily breathed a sigh of relief.
'See you later, Mr. Smith!"
Emily waved and stepped back, turning to walk away.
At that moment, Bianca had already caught up
She was about to call out to Emily, but saw her talking to someone in theMaybach and then turning to leave.
As Emily moved aside, the window slowly rolled up, and Bianca saw thecold, distant face inside.
Bianca's pupils contracted, her eyes widening.
How could it be him?
###Chapter 48
"Mr. Smith!'
Bianca whispered, still in disbelief.
She had once seen him from afar while tailing Tames. Eventhough it was a fleeting glimpse, she had been both awestruckand intimidated. She knew her own background and healthissues, and someone like him was way out of her league. So,she had never entertained any unrealistic fantasies.
But now,seeing Emily actually talking to him..
No,it had to be a coincidence. Emily must have brazenlyapproached him. And look, Emily didn't get in the car andwas sent away, right?
Bianca rassured herself with these thoughts. She watchedEmily leave with a sullen expression, debating whether toapproach and dig for information.
Then she noticed someone lurking around the corner whereEmily was heading. Bianca's gloominess faded, replaced by :manic smile. She almost forgot about the call she had madeearlier.
Emily, you think you're so clever? Let's see how you handlethis.?
"Come out!"
Emily had already walked up to the person watching her andspoke calmly.
"I knew you'd notice us," said the leader, wearing a plain whiteT-shirt that didn't draw attention. As he stepped out, theothers positioned themselves to block any escape routes forEmily.
"Yeah, I noticed you. So let's cut to the chase, who sent you?
Emily asked in a steady voice.
The man chuckled, "I’ll tell you, but only if you cooperate andcome with us to that alley for some photos." He pointed to anarrow, deserted alley nearby, which was actually a dead end
Emily showed no fear and replied calmly, "Alright, let's go.
The man, surprised by her compliance, didn't use force and ledher to the alley. Soon, they reached the end of it.
Emily stopped walking. The men exchanged glances, somefinding angles, others pulling out their phones.
"Take off your clothes," the man ordered with a smirk
Emily's expression turned icy, "I never agreed to that.
The man, taken aback by her sudden defiance, scowled,"Youdon't have a choice."
His tone carried a threat, and he signaled his men to grab her.
Emily's smile widened, but it didn't reach her eyes, "Is that so?
I'II return those words to you.
The man rowned, not understanding her meaning. He thoughtshe might be crazy. But soon, he realized what she meant.
Suddenly, he and his men couldn't move. Their limbs felt weak
and they collapsed to the ground.
"What did you do?" the man asked, terrified, looking at EmilyThey hadn't seen her do anything, yet they were paralyzed.
Emily didn't want to make things too hard for them. "When lgot close to you, I accidentally used a little drug. It's colorlessand tasteless. Right now, it just makes you feel weak. In a bit.you’ll feel normal again, but tonight, it'll feel like your bodiesare being eaten by thousands of ants. Eventually, you'lldevelop sores, and your bodies will rot away. Don't bothergoing to a hospital; they won't find anything. I made sure ofthat.'
The man's face turned pale with fear, and his followers beganto panic, clearly terrified of dying.
'What do you want?" the man asked after a moment of
internal struggle. "That's simple. Take me to the person who sent you. l assumethey want to use these photos to manipulate me. Otherwise. lmeet them myself.'
The man was surprised by Emily's intelligence
Everything was under her control. Emily had a good idea ofwho was behind this.
'We can take you to him. We were supposed to bring you afteltaking the photos anyway. But can you give us the antidotefirst?" the man asked cautiously.
Sure," Emily said without hesitation, "You can move now.
The men found they could move again. The man eyed herwarily, "A紇諼en't you afraid we'll harm you again?"
Emily smiled confidently, "You can try. Let's see if you're fastelthan me at using the drug.'
The man shuddered, not daring to take the risk. As Emilyfollowed them out of the alley, she didn't notice Daniel's carreturning.
"Mr.Smith, should I follow them?" York, Daniel's driver andbodyguard,asked worriedly. As Daniel's driver and topbodyguard, a few regular men couldn't be his match. Also, hehad noticed Daniel's growing interest in Emily over the pastfew days.
Daniel, rubbing his fingers, was about to get out of the carhimself. York quickly stopped him, "Mr. Smith, you can't. Thedoctor said you shouldn't exert yourself to avoid the poisonspreading.
Emily had used acupuncture to contain the poison in Danielsbody, preventing it from spreading. She had given strict
inStuctions. Daniel frowned, "Move."
His calm voice was like the calm before a storm, compellingYork to obey.Just as York was about to step aside, Danielturned back and got into the car.
York wauzzled by Daniel's sudden change of mind. Danielcoldly instructed, "Get in the car and follow them."
York got in, glancing at the alley. He saw Emily walking out
u證衣双中harmed, with the men who had surrounded her now actingstrangely, as if they feared her.
Interesting," Daniel murmured, a smile playing on his lipsYork didn't catch his words but saw Daniel smiling through
the rearview mirror.
"Mr. Smith, it looks like those men are afraid of Ms. Johnson,York remarked.
Daniel knew Emily wouldn't be easily controlled."Goodobservation." he said.
York felt sort of weird when he heard Daniel's praise
Then, Daniel reminded him again, "Keep your distance. Shemight notcie us."
York was puzzled. "Who would notice? Ms. Johnson? Seriously?
But he didn't dare to question Daniel, so he focused onfollowing the car, keeping a safe distance.
Soon, they arrived at Fortune Tower. Emily, seeing the buildingconfirmed her suspicion. It was the Reyes family.
"Call Mr. Reves and tell him I'm here to see him." sheinstructed.

###Chapter 49
"Hello, Mr. Reyes, we got the person you asked for downstairs.
Should I bring them up now?
The man, hearing Emily's instructions, didn't dare to hesitateand immediately dialed Isaac's number.
Isaac frowned, "Why'd you bring them here without checkingin first?"
The man replied nervously, "Sorry, Mr. Reyes, but this personhas a really bad temper.
He wasn'texactly lying.
Emily was probably a proud and fiery person by nature.
After speaking, he sneaked a glance at Emily. Seeing no changein her expression, he breathed a sigh of relief.
"Alright, alright, bring them up. Take them to the waitingroom first."
Isaac replied impatiently.
After hanging up, he arranged for his assistant to greet themand allowed the man in the T-shirt to bring Emily upstairsdirectly.
Isaac was confident that Emily had likely been forced to takecompromising photos, so she wouldn't dare to speak out.
The man, having received confirmation, immediately informedEmily
Emily then got out of the car and walked straight into FortuneTower.
The man hurried to follow, leaving his entourage waiting in thecar downstairs. This was his way of ensuring that if anythinghappened, they would still have a chance to escape.
Thanks to Isaac's assistant, they encountered no obstacles.
Emily reached the sixteenth floor and, as soon as she steppedout of the elevator, she began to act uncontrollably.
When the assistant led her towards the waiting room, sheheaded straight for the CEO's office.
"Hey, miss, the waiting room is this way. Mr. Reyes is currentlybusy and needs you to wait... Hey, slow down!" The assistantdidn't expect Emily to move so quickly.
Before he could finish his reminder, Emily had already walkedseveral feet away,almost reaching Isaac's office.
When Emily's hand was on the door handle, the assistant'sface turned pale with fear.
Isaac was "very busy" at the moment, and any interruptioncould spell trouble for him.
"Stop!" The assistant shouted urgently.
Instantly, everyone in the CEO's office froze and looked in hisdirection.
Despite this, Emily's actions didn't stop.
The assistant's face turned even paler as he turned to the man.'Who is this girl? How could you let her act so recklessly here'Make her stop immediately."
The man could only shrug helplessly and continue followingEmily.
Soon, he understood why the assistant was so panicked.
'Get out! Who let you in?"
As the office door opened, a woman with a bare upper bodywas sitting in the lap of a middle-aged man.
The man's shirt was half-open
It was clear what was happening here
The woman screamed in shock at the sudden intrusion. quicklgot up from Isaac's lap, grabbed her clothes, and turned herback to Emily and the others to get dressed.
Isaac, almost losing his composure due to the interruption,angrily cursed without caring who had entered.
Emily, unfazed, calmly walked in and found a seat. "l heardMr. Reves wanted to see me? Are you planning to talk to medressed like that?'
Her tone was casual, with a hint of indifference.
There was no trace of shyness.
Isaac knew of Emily, but he had always heard she was a timid.
insecure, and foolish girl picked up from the streets
Seeing her now, he realized the rumors might be false.
Isaac glared at the assistant who had entered after Emily, thenbegan to put on his clothes.
The woman, now dressed, hurriedly left the room under Issaacs order without looking at anyone.
I saac turned to his assistant, "Dax, get out and close the door!
Isaac cleared the room, then leaned back in his chair, hands onthe armrests, lazily observing Emily.
You've certainly surprised me. You should know why Iwanted to see you, right?"
Isaac's eyes flashed with anger as he thought of Byron'sexcruciating pain.
Initially, he thought Byron was faking it to force him to dealwith Emily.
But after several days of Byron writhing in pain, visibly losingweight, and his cheekbones protruding, he believed Byron wastruly suffering.
He had no idea what Emily had done, and even doctors couldnt figure it out.
"Of course! I know what you want, Mr. Reyes, but it seemsyou don't know what I want." Emily replied sweetly, with asmile.
Isaac felt a twinge of fear.
Something was off about Emily's attitude. Any other girl in hersituation would be panicking.
Isaac shot a sharp look at the man, silently asking what wasgoing on.
'You don't need to glare at him. If Mr. Reves wants to talkbusiness, why make it so complicated? I don't appreciate yourmethods.So,the upcoming negotiations might cost you.
Emily answered Isaac's unspoken question.
Isaac understood.
The photos hadn't worked, and now she had come to confronthim directly.
He cursed the man for being useless, unable to handle one girldespite having a team of skilled fighters.
Isaac's expression hardened, and he sat up straight.
abandoning his previous laziness.
He picked up a pen from the desk, seemingly playing with it.
"What did you do to Byron? Tell me your terms as long asyou make him recover, and I'll meet them. He's my only sonset to inherit the Reyes Group. I'll fulfill any reasonable
condition.
Isaac's tone softened, becoming unusually agreeable.
The change was so sudden that the man beside him noticedand glanced at him twice.
Emily chuckled innocently,"Mr. Reyes, I don't understandwhat you're saying.I heard Byron wasn't well, and since youhave a partnership with the Johnson family, I thought I'd offermy medical expertise. As for terms, it's just the medical fee."
She glanced at the pen in Isaac's hand.
It wasn't an ordinary pen but a recording device
Issaac seemed to be playing with the pen, but he was actuallyrecording everything.
Though it seemed casual, Emily had seen it before in her pastlife. She noticed the brief flash of red light.
She wouldn't fall for it easily.
If she had agreed to lsaac's terms and if she didn't treat Byrontoday, she could be accused of multiple crimes
Isaac, seeing she wasn't falling for it, grew angry
He slammed his hand on the desk, glaring at Emily, "Youtricked my men into not taking your photos. I'll call that asmart move. But you are stupid enough to show your face herein our territory. If you don't treat Byron today, you won'tmake it out of the Reyes Group!'
###Chapter 50
"Really? Well, let's see if you can stop me."
Emily stood up, showing no sign of panic, and even dared tothrow out a challenge. "Mr. Reyes, I hope you won't regret this
With that, she turned to leave.
"Stop her!"
Isaac ordered his men.
The men were too scared to move, feeling extremely uneasy.
Isaac should have known better, If he didn't dare to touch her.
she must have some extraordinary skills.
Why was Isaac still so impulsive?
'Mr. Reyes, maybe you should calm down and have a propertalk with Ms. Johnson!"
"Get lost, you traitor." Isaac kicked the man over and dialedDax and security.
Soon, people arrived.
Emily raised her phone. "If you try to stop me, I'l call thepolice."
Seeing his men blocking the office door, Isaac wasn't afraicanymore. He sneered,"I've had the signal blocked. Do youthink your call will go through?" He finished speaking and looked at Emily, waiting to see fearon her face.
But Emily just smiled. "Really? Then your signal blocker ispretty useless.
She pressed the emergency call button and put it on speaker.
Soon, the call connected.
"Hang up! Hang up!"
Isaac's face changed. He couldn't understand how she did it.
'Now, can we talk properly? Or should I remind you that youmight start feeling weak and unable to stand?"
She didn't need to say it.
As soon as she did, Isaac actually felt it.
At first, he told himself it was just psychological
But soon, his hands started trembling, followed by his legs
He stumbled and fell into a chair.
'What did you do? Poison? Do you realize this could land youin jail?" Isaac was still struggling, but his face was pale, clearlyunsure.
"You tried to capture me and take photos. I'm not afraid.
Besides, they won't find anything.
The man saw Isaac realizing Emily's danger and desperately
winked at him.
Surprisingly, Isaac understood.
He slumped on the sofa."Alright, name your terms.
Emily was prepared.
She opened her phone and sent the documents and contractshe had ready to saac.
Isaac wasn't even shocked that she knew his private email. Heopened and read them.
'No way. Byron isn't worth that much. I could iust abandonByron. I'm not too old to train a new heir.'
Isaac didn't want to compromise.
Emily hadn't expected to threaten him with only poison fromthe very beginning.
She was just stating facts. "For your information, while yourage doesn't affect fertility, your health does. If any of yourmistresses claim to be pregnant, get a paternity test.
Having seen her silent drugging, Isaac strangely believed her
Emily gave lsaac time to think.
"I can give you shares, half of Byron's shares, as medicalexpenses. But why do you want to lead the Johnson Groupproject?"
Could it be she wanted to prove to the Johnson family she was capable?
No matter how strong she was, she was still a girl longing forlove.
If Byron could charm her...
lsaac's eyes gleamed.
"That's none of your business! If you agree, print thedocuments and contract, sign them, and Il go treat Byronimmediately."
Emily didn't care what Isaac was planning, as long as it didn'taffect her interests.
But her patience was limited, and it showed on her face. "Youhave five minutes to decide."
Isaac was furious.
In the end, he had to compromise and then called his assistantin痈 "Print these documents and the contract and bring them in.
'Yes, sir!" Dax expected a fierce fight.
But the office was suddenly quiet.
When called in, it was surprisingly peaceful.
He was shocked, suppressing his curiosity, and quickly printedthe documents.
'Now, can you make me feel normal again?" Isaac's handswere still trembling.
Emily approached, pressed a spot on his neck, and flicked herfingers.
Isaac smelled a faint fragrance and instinctively took a deepbreath.
His hands quickly returned to normal.
Having witnessed her mysterious skills, Isaac's attitude softened.
Sit and wait. Once the contract is signed, you'l come with meto the Reves Villa to treat Byron!" Isaac said.
Emily didn't respond immediately, but asked, "Mr. Reyes, howdid you know I went to the school? Did Bianca tell you?"
Isaac's eves flickered."Your father couldn't reach you. so I hadothers keep an eye out. I heard you were good to Bianca. so Ithought I could get clues from her. It worked."
Emily was amused by Isaac's shamelessness
He wanted to see her and Bianca fight.
But he didn't need to bother
Bianca wouldn't stop causing trouble
She and Bianca were destined to be at odds.
In this life, she would slowly destroy everything Bianca pridedherself on. The more Bianca feared something, the more shewould do it.
Soon,the assistant brought the documents. Both parties quickly signed the contract.
Dax couldn't stop glancing at Emily.
He had seen the harsh terms of the contract and wonderedwhat Emily did to make Isaac agree.
But no matter how long he looked, he wouldn't find theanswer.
'Let's go treat Byron!" Isaac said eagerly
Emily nodded and got up to leave.
Just then, lsaac's phone rang.
Seeing the caller,he instinctively straightened up and answeredwith a respectful smile, "What can I do for you?"
Emily paused.
She turned to see Isaac's obsequious demeanor.
Her eyes flashed with curiosity. Who was on the other end?
Someone who could make Isaac act like this.
'Yes, yes, I'll come down to greet you. No need, Ill havesomeone let you in.
Isaac wiped nonexistent sweat from his forehead, nodded. andhung up.
He immediately called the internal line Then he had Dax quickly tidy the office while he fixed hisclothes and hair.
After all that, he hurried out, seemingly to greet someone
As he passed Emily, he remembered her.
"Emily, I'm sorry, but you'l have to wait a bit. You can wait inthe lounge."
He couldn't focus on Emily now, so he quickly left for theelevator.
Emily didn't go to the lounge but followed him to the elevatorout of curiosity.
Just as she arrived, the elevator doors opened.
Emily looked up and saw Daniel's sharp, handsome face
Her heart skipped a beat!
What was he doing here?
###Chapter 51
"Mr. Smith, it's an honor to have you here at theReyes Group!"
Isaac bowed enthusiastically, not feeling theslightest bit embarrassed about his subservientbehavior.Probably because this was Daniel. themost powerful man in Emerald City.
Daniel nodded slightly, his gaze falling on EmilyMs. Johnson, is this what you are up to? What acoincidence.IfI knew I should come over withyou."
His tone was casual and familiar
Isaac was taken aback. The way Daniel spokemade it sound like he had an appointment earlierwith Emily. Wasn't Emily the daughter theypicked up from the trash heap? Clumsy andinsecure, how could she know Daniel? A womanvalued by Daniel couldn't possibly be foolish andtimid.Byron stood up for Bianca, but was Biancareally that innocent?
Isaac's thoughts raced, and he smiled."So. Ms.Johnson and Mr. Smith had an appointment. Myapologies for interrupting your business, Mr. Smith He lightly slapped his own mouth, showing sincereregret. "Mr. Smith, did you come here specificallyfor Ms. Johnson?" he probed further.
Initially, he reluctantly signed the share transfercontract, but now he had realized that it was agood thing he did. If he had clashed with Emilyand she had Daniel backing her, Daniel's angercould cost him the entire Reyes Group. Now thatshe's a shareholder of the Reyes Group, she wouldcertainly want the company to thrive. Thisessentially meant the Reyes Group had aconnection to Daniel
Daniel's gaze swept over Isaac, who immediatelyfelt an invisible pressure. He shivered and realizedhe had overstepped. Someone like Daniel, hiswhereabouts and thoughts were not for someone ofIsaac's status to inquire about.
Emily's heart skipped a beat upon hearing Isaac'squestion. She instinctively looked at Daniel.meeting his deep, vortex-like eyes, as if they werepulling her in. Impossible! She hurriedly lookedaway, feeling that her thoughts were too self-indulgent and absurd.
dizzy during the few minutes of conversation, andhe signed the contract.
"Let's go!" A few minutes later, Daniel walked outcalmly and nodded to Emily. Behind him, theReyes Group's president followed like an assistant
"Okay!" Emily took a half step back, followingDaniel.
Daniel's expression remained calm, but his browtwγ hedslightly. His pace naturally slowed, givingEmily a chance to catch up and walk beside him.This subtle action went unnoticed by Emily. butIsaac,following behind, noticed. Indeed, Danieltreated Emily differently.
Isaac couldn't help but secretly observe Emily'sappearance. How could she be so lucky? Despiteher somewhat youthful face, her beauty wasundeniable. If not for her slight immaturity andthinness, her looks would have already made her atopic in social circles. No wonder Daniel
recognized her potential so early
He personally pressed the elevator button, sendingthe two off with a smile."Mr. Smith, Ms. lohnson.take care."
"Wait!" Emily suddenly spoke as the elevatordoors were about to close.
"Ms. ohnson, any instructions?" Isaac's attitudewas worlds apart from when he first met EmilyEmily naturally understood it was because ofDaniel's presence. This was good; her entry intothe Reyes Group would likely be smoother.
About Byron, I'll come by later...
'No rush, no rush. He deserves to suffer for hisfoolishness.Come tomorrow if youre free. No. callme tomorrow, and I'll send a driver to pick you up
Isaac's flattery was obvious, but he didn't mind. Heeven enjoyed it.
Emily raised an eyebrow."Alright!'
As soon as she finished speaking, the elevatordoors closed. The atmosphere suddenly becametense.
Emily thought for a moment and said,"Mr. Smiththank you.
Daniel's six-foot height made the 5.5-foot Emilyappear even more petite.
"Thank me for what?" He slightly turned and
looked down, making them even closer, as if Emilywas enveloped in his embrace from York's
perspective. The height difference made Emily's
heart race. She lowered her gaze, trying not to lookinto his eves.His gaze was too deep,almosthypnotic,making her thoughts uncontrollable.
Because of you, Mr. Reyes's attitude towards mehas changed significantly. My entry into the ReyesGroup will be much smoother," Emily answeredhonestly.
Daniel raised an eyebrow, a bit surprised. He hadworried she might suffer, but it seemed he hadunderestimated her abilities. In a short time, shenot only protected herself well but also gained
considerable benefits.
"Helping you is my honor," Daniel said calmly
Emily was stunned. His tone was the same asusual. But why did these words feel so warm,making her ears turn red? No wonder so manypeople wanted to be Daniel's wife. He possessedtop-tier looks, power, and was a gentleman withimpeccable manners. He didn't even ask how shesecured the job from Isaac.
In the confined space of the elevator, the silencemade the atmosphere tense. York felt the mostuncomfortable. He thought he shouldn't be in theelevator but should be waiting in the car.
Fortunately,the elevator finally arrived
he car was parked by the roadside downstairs
Despite Daniel's calm demeanor, his long legs
moved quickly when he got out, giving York adeeper understanding.Daniel treated Emilydifferently. York quickly opened the car door
As soon as Daniel got in, his face darkened. "Don'tget in."
At that moment, Emily had one foot in the car.She paused at Daniel's words. Her ears picked upthe faint sound.
'Mr. Smith, get out!"
Emily's face changed, and she reached out,grabbing Daniel's hand, pulling him towards herwith all her strength.
###Chapter 52
'Get down!" Emily shouted sharply as she yankedDaniel to the ground.
Daniel didn't hesitate, he knew she meant business
He grabbed Emily and rolled on the ground,following her lead.
The next moment, the parked Maybach exploded.
Flames nearly engulfed them.
The massive shockwave left Emily's head spinning
She was briefly unconscious but quickly came to.
She felt a heavy weight on her body andimmediately realized it was Daniel.
"Mr.Smith, Ms. lohnson, are you okay?
York was a pro.
Just as he was about to start the car, he heard thesound of gasoline dripping.
He didn't have time to save the people in the backseat; he could only protect himself by rolling on the ground.
Before the fire reached him, he heard Emilysshout, "Get down," and held onto a glimmer ofhope.
It seemed they had also heard the sound ofleaking fuel.
So, after escaping danger, he ignored the pain fromthe burns on his back and started shouting andsearching.
"York, we're over here.
Emily was relieved to hear York's voice.
York was glad to hear from Emily, but he couldn'thelp but worry when he didn't hear from Daniel.
Following Emily's voice, he quickly found them.
Daniel lay unconscious, pressing heavily on Emily.
showing no signs of movement.
York suppressed his panic and hurriedly helpedDaniel up.
"Ms. Johnson, are you okay?" York asked,concerned about Emily. Emily's head was still spinning from the
shockwave,but she wasn't injured thanks to Daniel
s protection.
He had shielded her, even covering her head withhis hand to prevent injury during the roll.
"I'm fine.Ouickly,lay Mr.Smith down over there.
I need to check him.
Emily shook her head, her gaze complex as shelooked at the unconscious Daniel.
York carefully carried Daniel away from the fireand laid him down on the roadside.
Fortunately, Emily was wearing a T-shirt and longpants today, with her silver needles in her pocket.
She always carried them with her.
Now they could be put to use.
Emily first checked Daniel's pulse.
As she did, her expression grew darker
Poisoned again?
How could this be? Emily had warned Daniel about the dangeraround him.
He should have taken care of it.
But now there was a new poison
Maybe because of the medicinal bath, it hadn't
affected him.
But the explosion had injured him, causing thepoison to spread uncontrollably.
Emily took out her silver needles.
"Ms. Johnson!
York was surprised to see her medical skills andthe silver needles she carried.
His expression changed.
For a moment, he wondered if Emily hadorchestrated all this.
The explosion!
The silver needles she carried.
Then she could gain Daniel's trust.
Emily spoke urgently to York, "Daniel's body hasbeen poisoned again. The explosion damaged hisbody's defense mechanism.I need to stop the
poison from spreading. Please trust me and don't
stop me."
York hesitated.
More and more people were gathering around
Such a big fire on the roadside had caused a trafficlam.
Pedestrians couldn't help but watch
Many had already taken out their phones to recordthe event.
"What's going on? That's a luxury car. How did itcatch fire? Can the people inside survive?"
"Look, are those the people rescued from the car?
Someone spotted Emily and Daniel.
Emily's face was smudged, making herunrecognizable.
But Daniels handsome face was clear in thecamera.
"That face is perfect. He must be the car owner. Ihope he's okay!"
Most people were kind-hearted and hoped for thebest.
Seeing such a face, they couldn't help but pray forhis safety.
Some had already posted the video online, and itwas quickly gaining attention.
Emily had no time to worry about this. She wasanxious and spoke urgently again,"York,mstarting!"
York's stern face showed the coldness of someonewho had seen blood.
Being Daniel's driver and personal assistant, hewas likely also a bodyguard.
Such a person must be very skilled
Emily might not be able to take him on.
So she spoke again, seeking his approval.
She tightened her grip on the silver needles, readyto act if he didn't agree, to incapacitate him.
York clenched his fists, still hesitating
He couldn't gamble with Daniel's life.
If Daniel were to die, the Smith family would be inturmoil, affecting many companies and employees
But Daniel had a sharp eye.
He admired Emily, so she shouldn't be a badperson.
Just as York made up his mind to agree, Daniel'seyelashes fluttered, and he struggled to open hisheavy eyelids.
"Do it... I trust you...
Daniel managed to say, then coughed up blood.
Emily's expression changed.
York's hesitation was no longer an issue
She didn't even need to remove his clothes.
The silver needles flew, piercing the special spotson Daniel's body accurately.
York watched Emily's movements with a tense and complex expresslon.
Seeing the silver needles dance in Emily's hands.
York was surprised.
Wasn't Emily just an eighteen-year-old girl? Howdid she have such skills? Her medical expertiseseemed impressive.
"Look, what's that girl doing? Are those silverneedles?"
Someone pointed at Emily's actions, curious
Everyone watched Emily's flying silver needles.
intrigued.
The video that had gone viral was updated with asecond clip.
Does anyone know what this girl is doing withthe silver needles? Can she really save him?
The video quickly gained more views.
Bianca was about to go home and complain toAiden about Ronnie's incident, hoping Aiden'scompany wouldn't employ such a person, whichcould potentially affect the company. She was about to call when a news notificationpopped up on her phone.
She accidentally clicked on it.
Emily's face was smudged, her hair disheveledand her clothes damaged.
Bianca didn't recognize her and didn't believeEmily had any real medical skills.
The flying silver needles indicated a skilled person.
But what shocked her was the face lying on theground.
"Mr. Smith!" She couldn't help but shout.
She quickly dialed James's number.
"ames, check the news. Mr.Smith is in trouble.Illsend you the link."
###Chapter 53
The VIP suite in the hospital.
'What are you doing here?"
After Bianca sent Tames the link and he watched it,she suggested that they should come to thehospital. She was determined to meet the truehead of the Smith family before anyone else
arrived.
But as soon as they entered the room, they sawEmily standing by the bed.
'I come here as I please. What's it to you, bitch?
Emily had just finished giving Daniel an injectionand accompanying the ambulance to the hospital.Now that Daniel was out of danger and transferredto the VIP suite, she encountered these two idiots.
Emily was exhausted and irritated, so her tone wasnaturally harsh.
"Emily, how can you be so rude and say suchthings!"
Bianca hadn't even said anything, just showed apitiful expression, and James immediately jumped in to scold Emily.
They hadn't connected Emily with the girl in thevideo who saved Daniel. On one hand, they didn'tbelieve she had such medical skills, On the otherhand,Emily had changed into clothes that Yorkhad prepared at some point.
'I'll speak whatever I want. If you don't like it, dont provoke me!" Emily replied coldly.
You're simply unreasonable and hopeless! If youkeep this up, it's clear you're not fit to marry me!
James was still living in his own world. He stillbelieved Emily couldn't possibly give up on himso he dared to criticize her so arrogantly.
Emily was almost amused by his self-importance.
Who cares about marrying you? Have youforgotten that we've already broken off theengagement?"
She reminded him seriously.
Tames frowned and then sneered, "You're iustfooling yourself. Or maybe...
His gaze fell on Daniel lying in bed. Daniel was someone he could only look up to. Thinking thatEmily might be trying to curry favor with Daniel,his face turned icy.
His words became particularly sinister. "Are youtrying to ingratiate yourself with Daniel to gain hisapproval, so you're acting so recklessly?'
Bianca was still puzzled. How could Emilysuddenly be here? For a moment, she couldn't helpbut wonder if Emily was the girl in the video.Tames's words brought her back to reality.
She quickly said, "Emily, it's one thing to messaround usually, but there's a line. Mr. Smith isn'tsomeone you can mess with. If you anger him.even our family won't be able to help you,
understand?"
ames mocked, "Daniel isn't like Bianca and me,who tolerate you for your own good. If you angerDaniel, you'll disappear!"
He wanted to instill fear in Emily so she wouldrestrain herself.
"I've already left the Tohnson family. I havenothing to do with Bianca or you, my ex-fiancé.Save your fake kindness and stop meddling in my aff甪萌撰ir櫊惠竄戊嚨纳应
Emily was clearly impatient.
'Emily, your words really hurt us. Our familyfound you in the trash and took you in. Howcould we truly abandon you? Stop causing troubleand apologize to ames. Even he can't tolerate yourantics forever.
Bianca's eyes filled with tears, and she started tosway as if she might faint.
"Bianca, don't hurt yourself over someone who isnt worth it." James quickly supported Bianca andcomforted her.
Then he turned to Emily, his tone cold, "If youwant to self-destruct, don't drag Bianca down withyou!"
'Shut up!" Emily snapped, noticing the person inbed frown. Such a peaceful face shouldn't bedisturbed."If you want to argue, do it outside. Dont disturb the patient, or I won't be polite.
Her eyes were sharp with warning.
Emily,I think you should be the one to leave.You're just angry because l exposed your intentions and now you want to kick us out. Do you evenrealize your status? You have no right to giveorders here!"
James felt a strange emotion from Emily's piercinggaze, but suppressed it and retorted.
'How annoying!
At that moment,a clear,magnetic voice sounded
Everyone turned to the owner of the voice.
Daniel, thank goodness you're awake!
James immediately dropped his cold demeanorand smiled, trying to ingratiate himself.
Bianca knew Daniel was stunning, but when heopened his eyes, he was even more breathtakingmaking her heart race. She tried to suppress herfeelings and smiled sweetly at him, "Mr. Smith, mso glad you're awake.ames and I saw the newsand were very worried,so we came to see youright away.
Daniel looked at Bianca and frowned. Under herexpectant gaze, he slowly spoke, "Who are you?"
Emily couldn't help but laugh. She had considered Daniel's attitude. Given that Bianca was James'sfavorite and Daniel's own demeanor, he shouldtreat her kindly. But she never expected his firstwords to be like this.
Bianca's smile froze,and Emily's laughter madeher tremble with shame.
"What are you laughing at? Gloating?
James glared at Emily.
Then he quickly explained,"Daniel, this is Bianca.the daughter of the lohnson family. She's verykind and was the one who told me about youraccident."
ames was somewhat afraid of Daniel, but seeingBianca upset, he couldn't help but stand up for her
Emily's eyes darkened. James wasn't incapable ofdefending someone, he just didn't defend heranymore,Bianca hadn't even suffered much.vet herushed to protect her.
Daniel's expression remained indifferent, his voicecold,"You think you're impressive, coming here toshow off."
Clearly, Bianca's status meant nothing to him. Tames heard Daniel's coldness and quickly said,Daniel, I didn't..."
Daniel didn't want to hear his nonsense andinterrupted, "If I'm not mistaken, you should be onyour way to handle a project out of town. Are youvery free?"
'Daniel, I was iust worried about you. I'll leaveright after checking on you.
Tames was drenched in cold sweat, his back chilledand he hurriedly explained.
Bianca was also shocked.It seemed like Danielwas speaking up for Emily. That wouldn't do! IfEmily had Daniel's support, she'd be morepowerful than Bianca.Despite the embarrassment.she quickly said,"Mr. Smith, you misunderstood.ames was only worried that Emily might haveulterior motives in approaching you. Just now.when we came in, we saw her hand reaching foryou; that is why James was so angry.
"What? Are you teaching me how to handle things?
Daniel's eyes flashed coldly as he asked. He didn't care about the truth. But when shementioned Emily touching his face, Daniel's eyesflickered, and he glanced at Emily.
###Chapter 54
"I... I...No, I am not!
Bianca's face went ghostly white, tremblinguncontrollably. This time, it wasn't an act. She'dheard the stories about Daniel's ruthless nature. Noone who crossed him ever came out unscathed
ames noticed Bianca seemed on the brink of arelapse from her old illness. He didn't dare stayany longer and risk angering Daniel. Seizing themoment, he said, "Daniel, I'm sorry, but it lookslike Bianca's old illness is flaring up. I need to gether to a doctor right away. We won't bother youanymore. Take care.
With that, he supported Bianca and hurried out ofthe room like they were fleeing from a demon.
Emily watched them leave in such a pitiful stateand couldn't help but laugh heartily.
"Having fun?" Daniel's voice was low and casualHe leaned back naturally, a stark contrast to hisusual serious demeanor. His deep, soulful eyeswere captivating without him even realizing it
Emily's heart raced. She had almost forgotten Daniel was there in her moment of triumph.Suppressing her excitement, she smiled, "Not bad.But Mr. Smith, you must have found it amusingtoo.
"It's not a joke! At your age, you should laughfreely and without restraint." Daniel said ascasually as if he were talking about the weather.
Emily almost teared up. It seemed he had noticedhow burdened and devoid of self she had beenliving. In her past life, she had been. In this life.because of the pain from her past, even though sheno longer lived for others, she still lived heavily.
What was it like to live freely? She had never
experienced it. But his words reminded her. Sinceshe was living for herself, she should live morefreely. In this life,she was only eighteen!
Daniel, thank you!" At this moment, sheaddressed Daniel as a kindred spirit and gave hima genuine smile.
Daniel was taken aback. Then, the corners of hislips lifted slightly. Indeed, she was a perceptivegirl who understood his words.
'You saved me again. Shouldn't I be thanking you Emily?" He smiled and looked into Emily's eyes.
Both of them couldn't help but laugh.
"Daniel, are you okay? When I saw the news abouyour accident, I was scared to death. I rushed overas fast as I could..." Charles came running in, hisvoice preceding him.
'S谥hit..." He swallowed the curse under Daniel'swarning gaze. Charles was reacting this waybecause he had iust walked in and saw Danielsmiling. And at a girl, no less. He even wonderedif he had entered the wrong room. Rubbing hiseyes, he confirmed it was Daniel, so he almost letout a curse.
He looked Emily up and down. Indeed, she wasquite pretty. And she seemed even more beautifulthan the last time he saw her. But she was so
young!
"Hey, Ms. Johnson. How did you end up in thesame car as Daniel? Does this mean you've beenthrough thick and thin together? Any thoughts onthat?" Charles smiled, probing.
Emily frowned. Did he think she was trying toseduce Daniel? She suppressed all her emotionsand said calmly,"Mr.Green, you misunderstand The reason Mr. Smith and I were together is thatboth our dogs were sick.We were planning to takethem to the vet together.
Charles was about to ask when Daniel got a dog.Then he remembered. So, Daniel was using thedog to get closer to Emily. Impressive! He couldn’help but blurt out, "So, Daniel, you iust bought adog, and it's already sick?"
Bought a dog?" Emily looked at Daniel inconfusion.
If she remembered correctly, Daniel had said thedog was a stray and looked pitiful.
###Chapter 55
Charles heard Emily's puzzled question. FeelingDaniels icy gaze, he realized he had probably saidsomething wrong. He quickly shut up.
Daniel's fingers unconsciously rubbed together, buthis face showed no guilt as he explained, "I boughtit. I had seen it as a stray before. When I saw itbeing sold by a dog dealer, I felt sorry for it andhad my butler buy it.
Charles was speechless. Since when had Danielbecome so compassionate? He didn't believe it. ButEmily bought his story. She nodded, "Mr. Smith.you're so kind-hearted.'
Charles almost couldn't hold back his laughterFortunately,Emily's phone rang. It was Sofiacalling. Emily had a bad feeling and quicklyanswered.
"Hello...
There was no response from Sofia on the other end.
But soon, there was a commotion.
"Violette, hurry up, bring the money. What? Areyou trying to run away and take my son and daughter with you?'
"I'm telling you, either you bring the money today.
or I'll take my son away.
Let go of my son, you bastard.
"What? After a few days out, you think you'vefound someone better and want to abandon me?
There were sounds of a struggle on the other endIt was Rhett and Violette's voices. Mixed in wereAtticus and Sofia, trying to protect Violette.
Emily guessed that Violette had called Atticus andSofia over, but somehow Rhett had found out andfollowed them.Seeing Violette living in a villa, hewas forcing her to give him money.
"...You slut, you found a man outside, and I didn'tcare. Now I ask for money, and you dare disobeyme? I'll beat you to death!"
"Dad, let go of Mom...
"Get lost. You dare block me? You slut, and youuseless son. This is the kind of son and daughteryou raised.Watch me teach you all a lesson, so you know who's in charge in this house. Rhett's voice was particularly arrogant on the otherend. The next moment, there was a scream fromSofia. Then the call was abruptly cut off.
Emily's face darkened.
'Is something wrong?" Daniel noticed Emily'sexpression and asked in a serious tone.
Emily hid her emotions and said goodbye, "It'snothing, just a small family issue. You rest well. Ineed to go handle it."
"Do you need help?" Charles, catching Daniel's hintstood up and asked with concern.
'No need!" As Emily said this, she was already atthe door. Her figure quickly disappeared.
She called the property management as she wentdownstairs."There's someone causing trouble atmy house.Go over and control the situation.Il bethere soon.
The property management staff immediatelyagreed.Emily was about to put her phone away. Ahand suddenly reached out and snatched her
phone.
Emily frowned.Instinctively,she struck out. "...Ouch, ouch... Emily, let go of my hand...
Emily, what are you doing? Let go of Bianca!
Emily hadn't expected these two to still be hereThey were deliberately waiting for her. Hearingames's words, she didn't immediately let go ofBianca.Instead, she tightened her grip, makingBianca cry out in pain, and slowly retrieved herphone from Bianca's hand. Then she gave a hardpush.
"Bianca, are you okay?" Bianca stumbled, andJames quickly caught her, asking with concern.
"ames, I'm fine. I didn't mean to take Emily'sphone.I was just afraid she had something againstme and wouldn't listen to me, so I thought ofdoing this."
Bianca hurriedly explained. Tears kept falling, andshe cried uncontrollably. Her tears also movedames. He glared at Emily with cold eyes,Apologize, or don't blame me for being rude.'
###Chapter 56
"Don't even think about it! Get lost! I got importantstuff to do right now, and you better not get in myway, or I won't be so nice!'
Emily's eyes blazed with fury.
Tames had never seen such a look in Emily's eyesbefore.
He was so shocked that he took a step back,
Bianca, with tears in her eyes, quickly stepped infront of ames. "Emily, how can you talk to Jameslike that? Tust because he cares about you doesn'tmean you can bully him! If you have a problem.take it out on me!"
She closed her eyes and stuck out her necklooking like she was ready to face death.
Emily sneered coldly.
James immediately pulled Bianca behind him, as ifafraid Emily might hurt her.
He raised his hand.
"Emily!"
With the sound of a slap, Tames's voice was filledwith anger.
"Emily, how could you hit James? What'shappened to you? James, are you okay?"
"Keep talking nonsense, and it won't just be oneslap!
Emily had already slapped him and was shakingher hand. She had no time to deal with the two ofthem.
If she hadn't anticipated James's move and slappedhim first, she would have been the one getting hit.
In fact, she should have slapped him in their pastlife.
Someone she once relied on had almost hit her foranother woman.
It was truly pathetic.
Bianca was so shocked by Emily's hostility thatshe fell silent.
Emily didn't look at them again. She hailed a caband quickly left.
In the cab, she dialed Knox's number with a sternexpression.
"Mr. Green, any updates on what I asked you toinvestigate last time?"
It shouldn't be taking this long. She knew Knox'scapabilities and influence.
Emily, you only call me when you needsomething...
'Cut the crap. What's the status?"
'Alright, I'll send it to you right away!
He just wanted her to call him first. But Emily'stemper had grown sharper, like a kitten ready toshow its claws at any moment.
That was good, at least she wouldn't be bullied
"Thanks! Ill treat you to dinner sometime," Emilysaid sincerely.
The person on the other end, who had beensulking,immediately brightened up.
His eyes narrowed with affection, as if he wasready to send his love through the phone line.
"That's more like it! Need any help? Your uncle isreally a piece of work."
Knox's eyes flashed with anger
Scum like that was a waste of air
"Not for now. If I need help, I won't hesitate to ask
"Alright then!" Knox sounded a bit disappointedHe paused and then said, "I’ll give you a contact.He specializes in this kind of thing. Just call himdirectly.
"Got it!"
Emily hung up and immediately received theinformation and phone number from Knox.
She quickly scanned the details
When she saw the debt amount listed as $500,000.
her eyes filled with anger.
$500,000,but he had told Violette it was $1.000.000.
He had been scheming against Violette, taking allthe benefits while pushing Violette,Atticus, and Sofia into despair.
Unbelievable!
Her anger was so intense that the cab driverseeing her through the rearview mirror.almostslammed on the brakes in fear
Meanwhile, at Serenity Grove.
Rhett was being pinned to the ground by severalsecurity guards.
"Let me go! I'm hitting my own wife. What rightdo you have to hold me down? Ill call the copsand expose you all for being useless security!'
Even while being restrained, Rhett continued toshout obscenities.
"Have you all slept with my Violette? Is that whyyou re treating me like this?"
"You idiots, she's a loose woman who doesn't careabout you. See that mansion over there? That's herlover's place. He's probably some old geezer. She'snot loyal, and she's trying to take my kids. Wouldyou stand for that?"
The men holding him down were furious at his s岂伩昽洞ander and wanted to beat him up.
Some had already kicked him a few times
But hearing his words, some started to believe him
They felt a sense of male solidarity and fell silent,even feeling some sympathy.
After all, for a man,this was a huge humiliation.
he commotion naturaly drew attention.
Some people, hearing Rhett's words, began to lookdown on Violette.
'I knew it. Why else would he be so angry? Turnsout she cheated. She looks okay, but she's so
skinny, and her skin is bad. Would the owner ofthat house even be interested in her?"
'Maybe it really is an old man.
"Who knows who owns that house?
The gossipers were mostly people with nothingbetter to do.
Those who could afford houses here had goodbackgrounds. I瀘详她浒富i鮨縭鹐鹂枸 w鯗怪e覡Ⅻ鍾ren't for the noise, they wouldn't be socurious.
Living here long enough, they formed acommunity, so they speculated if they knew theowner.
Violette was being slandered by Rhett in front of somany people.Especially since Atticus wanted tobecome a public servant, if this got out, it coulda贵懸微瓣殫未菏踹ect his future exams...
"Rhett, I didn't! You're lying! The real problem isyou. You asked me to borrow money, but it wasn'tfor a failed business, was it? Where did the moneygo? I didn't see a single penny."
Violette, usually gentle, wasn't good at arguing.
Even in anger, she couldn't say anything too harsh
But she remembered Emily's words. If she didn'tstand up for herself, her children would suffer.
For her children, she couldn't accept this slander.
She tried to stay calm and clearly state the truth
"You liar! You said you borrowed money for meWhere is it? You can't show it, can you? And didn't you say you borrowed from Eli? Eli doesn't livehere. Why are you here? Everyone, look at her.She may have bad skin, but she's actually prettyand knows how to sweet-talk people.
'If she comes around here, keep an eye on yourmen."
Rhett was truly shameless.
He used such tactics to incite hostility against her
"Dad, how can you slander Mom like this? She'sdone everything for this family and for you. Andthis house doesn't belong to any man. It's...
'Atticus!" Violette didn't want Atticus to reveal itwas Emily's house, to avoid causing her trouble.
To Rhett, this looked like Violette was guilty andwas stopping Atticus from telling the truth.
See,she won't let my son speak. You cheater!worked so hard for this family, and this is howyou repay me? ll kill you!"
Rhett suddenly broke free from the guards andswung his fist at Violette's head. "Mom!"
Atticus and Violette realized what was happeningtoo late and screamed in despair.
Scumbag! How dare you touch her!'
Emily arrived just in time to see this
She rushed forward and kicked Rhett away
He hit the ground hard and couldn't get up.
###Chapter 57
'You piece of trash..."
Rhett tried to get up several times but failedglaring viciously as he cursed.
Emily stepped forward and stomped on his back.
causing him to scream in pain.
Say one more word, and I'll end you!" Emily'stone sounded more than serious.
This threat finally silenced Rhett.
"Emily, why are you back?"
Violette didn't want Emily to get involved. Rhettwas a lowlife, and she herself was already a lostcause. If he bullied her, so be it. But Emily wasyoung and had a bright future ahead. If she gotentangled with someone like Rhett, her life wouldbe miserable.
Emily gently patted Violette's hand, reassuring her."Don't worry, I'll handle this."
She first glanced at the onlookers, then fixed hergaze back on Rhett. "The house behind us is mine,not some man's
Rhett was full of it. This Rhett gambled away ahuge sum and is forcing Violette to borrow moneyor else he won't pay back, which would affect
Atticus's chances of becoming a civil servant.
Emily was both clearing Violette's name andexposing Rhett's vices.
Gambling anyone with a brain knew what thatmeant.
"A bad man, how dare he show up here?"
"Didn't expect this woman to dress so plainly, yether niece is so capable. If she's so capable, why lether aunt live so poorly?"
'Money doesn't grow on trees, especially with abottomless pit of an uncle. Women need to beindependent."
Some people spoke up for Emily, and othersscrutinized her closely. They hadn't seen such aneighbor before;she must have iust moved in.Buying a house in this neighborhood wasn't justabout having money.
Emily wasn't aware of this, but smart people were already speculating and deciding not to provokeher until they knew her background.
Emily had achieved her goal.
"You're just an eighteen-year-old girl, where wouldyou get the money to buy this house? Who wouldbelieve that? You must be in cahoots to scam me..I don't believe it!"
Rhett's cunning eyes darted around as heimmediately retorted.
But as soon as he started spewing filth, Emilypressed down harder with her foot.
He grimaced in pain but refused to give up. "Ormaybe it's not Violette who latched onto a man.but you. You do have some looks, but at such ayoung age, you're already learning bad things. Justike Violette, you're a slut! Ouch, you're hurting me!Be careful, or I'll call the cops on you!
Rhett, in pain, threatened her
'Tell him, am I the owner?"
Emily addressed the security and the arrivingproperty manager calmly. The property manager had a good impression ofEmily. A particularly beautiful eighteen-year-oldViolette had caught Daniel's eye, and he had soldher the house, even instructing the propertymanagement to take special care of her
The property manager stepped forward respectfully."Ms. Tohnson, of course, you are the owner of thishouse.
Rhett was stunned. Emily was indeed the owner othe villa.
Could it be that the lohnson family bought it forher?
Wasn't she supposed to be disliked by her family?
None of that mattered now. Since Emily hadmoney to buy a house, she must have money togive him.
Seeing how she respected Violette, she wouldprobably give him money.
Rhett immediately changed his tone. "Emily, we'refamily.I misunderstood Violette, that's why I gotso angry. It's because I care about Violette, youknow?"
Emily remained silent, wanting to see what Rhettwould say next.
Violette knew Rhett too well and quickly spoke upDon't even think about targeting Emily. She doesnt have money for you.Come back with me, and well figure something else out.
Rhett snorted, "Shut up. I'm talking, not you.Emily, don't listen to Violette. She's just a womanwith limited knowledge.I'm trying to pay off thedebt quickly to avoid being blacklisted, whichwould affect Atticus's chances of becoming a civilservant. Help me out, and I'll remember yourkindness!
He was used to being arrogant.
Even now, he instinctively treated Violette poorly
He didn't realize that Emily's willingness to helphim depended on Violette.
As for Atticus, she cared about him, too.
But her main concern was Violette
Emily sneered,"With your attitude towardsViolette, you still expect me to help you? Dream on,As for Atticus, becoming a civil servant is a good Emily reminded him, "Put it on speaker.
Rhett wanted to argue but was intimidated byEmily's cold, commanding gaze.
He reluctantly put it on speaker
'Rhett, come back quickly! The debt collectors arehere,smashing everything. The house is going tobe gone. Where's Violette? Didn't she go out toborrow money? Why hasn't she brought it back?Eli has money, but why can't she get it? Is shedoing this on purpose?'
The voice on the other end was old but sharp andbitter, first crying for help, then cursing.
It was none other than Rhett's mother,Fallon
Emily's brows furrowed, her eyes growing darker,
Fallon's immediate insults showed that this was aregular occurrence for Violette.
Scumbag, tell Rhett to pay up, stop talkingnonsense. If you can borrow money, you should beable to pay it back.
Then came the sounds of smashing, followed by afierce warning. "I'm telling Rhett to get the money. It's just that Ican't get that much money right now. Stopsmashing things, those are worth money too...
Fallon screamed in fear.
It seemed the debt collectors had smashed almosteverything and were losing patience, grabbing thephone.
'Rhett, if you don't pay up, I'll break your armsand legs. Don't think you can escape. You've heardof my reputation. I'll find you wherever you go...
"Mr.Palmer, yes, yes, I never thought of runningaway.I just don't have that much money rightnow.Can you give me more time?  Rhett. a cowardimmediately groveled upon hearing Dean Palmer'syoice.
'Stop fooling me.I've given you extensions. Thistime, no more. Prepare yourself-pay up or loseyour limbs."
Dean wasn't in the mood for negotiations,
threatening him.
Rhett's face changed. His eyes darted around,landing on Violette and Sofia. He spoke again, "Mr. Palmer, I really can't get thatmuch money. How about I offer my wife anddaughter as collateral? My wife may be older, butshe's still attractive. And my daughter looks likeher, turning eighteen soon...
###Chapter 58
'Rhett, you jerk! How dare you!
Violette, who had always been gentle and
submissive, couldn't hold back any longer after
hearing Rhett's words. Her eyes blazed with furyand she charged at Rhett, delivering a hard slap
across his face.
Rhett was stunned by the slap.
If he hadn't been on the phone, he would havestarted yelling at Violette again.
Rhett quickly apologized to the person on theother end of the call, "Mr. Palmer, sorry about that.My wife and kids are right here with me. Youwant to come here...
Emily suddenly reached out and snatched thephone from Rhett's hand."Dean Palmer, right?
Dean paused, hearing the soft, melodic voice of ayoung woman.
"Yeah! Who are you, young lady? Are you Rhett'sdaughter?"
Such a pleasant voice made him feel a shiver down
his spine.
A woman like this to settle the debt? Not a badidea.
His tone softened considerably.
Emily spoke calmly, "I'm not, but I can makedecisions. How much does he owe you?"
"Five hundred thousand dollars! No, it's been aday, so now it's five hundred and fifty thousanddollars. Are you planning to pay off Rhett's debt?
Dean was genuinely curious about the woman onthe other end of the call; her tone was quite bold
Could she really have the money to pay up?
He was intrigued.
However, he didn't realize that his words causedViolette, Atticus, and Sofia to all turn pale.
You... you lied to me... You said it was a milliondollars!I suggested selling the house, and you saidit wouldn't be enough... How could you do this?"
The house they lived in was only worth a fewhundred thousand dollars. Violette's original plan was to sel the house and borrow the rest if needed
But Rhett had refused, saying it wouldn't beenough anyway, and it was better to borrow moremoney to avoid the family ending up homeless.
Moreover,he owed five hundred thousand dollarsbut claimed it was a million. What was he
planning to do with the extra five hundred
thousand?
Rhett's eyes darted around guiltily, but he stilltв样ie箏蔟d to defend himself, "It's because of the interestI was afraid the money wouldn't be enough, andyou would waste time. Look, it's only been a day,and the debt has increased by fifty thousanddollars.
"You jerk! How dare you say that? Do you thinkyou can handle loan sharks? What else are youhiding from me?"
Once, Violette had shared sweet moments withRhett.
She was beautiful, gentle, and had a wealthybrother.
But at some point, Rhett started to change. One day, after drinking, he couldn't control himself andhit her when she tried to care for him
Emily wasn't asking Rhett to pay off his debt. Shewanted Violette to see his true colors and gatherthe courage to divorce him.
She continued speaking to Dean on the phone.Please wait there. We'll be right over."
Dean raised an eyebrow, eager to meet the peopleon the other end.
"Alright, I'm in a good mood today. I'll wait foryou," Dean said with a smile.
Emily hung up the phone and released her footfrom Rhett's.
"Rhett, let's go to your house!"
'No, Emily, we can't go. You... you shouldn't get媂《nvolved. I’ll go back with Rhett!"
Violette hurriedly tried to persuade Emily,
'Stop talking nonsense!" Rhett got up from theground, hesitating whether to run, but hearingViolette's words, he immediately retorted. He quickly grabbed Sofia, "Come on, let's go backtogether."
With Violette by Emily's side, he was somewhatafraid of her.
But by holding Sofia, Violette would surely followhim back.
"Dad, let go of me!" Sofia had heard Rhett's plan tosell her and struggled.
Violette wanted to save sofia.
###Chapter 59


"Sophia,Eli actually followed you here. Is there a back door in this building? Maybe you can sneak out that way?" Sophia frowned,surprised Eli had managed to track Emily down after failing to find her in the art department. She quickly suggested a plan.



"Leave? That's not gonna work. Knowing him, he's probably got someone watching the back door too, just waiting to catch me."Emily's smile was cold and mocking.



Sophia felt a pang of sympathy. "Then what should we do? Maybe you can hide in the lab. Even if he comes upstairs, he won't have the authority to enter. We can wait him out. I don't believe Eli will abandon his company just to wait for you."



It was a desperate plan, but Emily didn't want to waste her time on him. After all, she had a second chance at life, and her time was now more valuable than ever.



"No need for all that trouble. I have a way to make him leave quickly." Emily said, pulling out her phone and dialing a number. "Hello, Ms. Johnson. Are you coming to treat Byron?" The voice on the other end was eager and excited.



"Yes, I should be there this afternoon. But I need Mr. Reyes to help me with something first."


"Emily, you don't need to be so formal with me. Just tell me what you need, and I'll do my best to help." Isaac responded promptly.



"Eli is causing trouble at my school. I'm in class and don't want him to disrupt me."



Isaac shook his head at Eli's behavior. He thought to himself that with such a clueless leader, the Johnson Group's future didn't look promising. He decided he would need to distance himself from them after this project.



"Alright, that's easy. Leave it to me. I'll wait for you at home."



Isaac assured her, reminding her to come by for Byron's treatment.Emily didn't mind his reminder and hung up after a brief acknowledgment. "Emily, come down here! Mr. Johnson is here to see you. Don't be ungrateful. If you don't come down, we'll have to come up and get you ourselves." The voice from downstairs was cold and demanding.amplified by a loudspeaker that echoed through the building,clearly intended to disrupt the lab work.



Kurt,who had been working nearby, came out with a stern expression. He immediately approached Emily.



Sophia, knowing that Kurt was Emily's current mentor, quickly defended her. "Mr. Lowe, please don't blame Emily. She was lost and just recently found by the Johnson family, but they haven't treated her we11. Her father is downstairs, causing a scene to force her down. This isn't how a loving father behaves."



Kurt, moved by Sophia's defense of Emily, nodded. "Don't worry,I won't misunderstand her. You must be Emily's friend. Good job."



He then turned to Emily with a kind and protective look. "You've been through a lot. You don't need to go downstairs. I'll handle this.
Emily tried to stop him, but Kurt, being the fiery person he was,
didn't wait for her response and hurried downstairs.


Sophia,seeing Kurt's affection for Emily, was happy for her. "It's great that Mr. Lowe, your mentor, is so supportive. Without Bianca around to bother you, your future should be much smoother."



Emily smiled faintly but said nothing. Knowing Bianca's nature,she doubted the trouble was over.


Downstairs, Eli was still shouting, "Emily..."


"What's all this shouting about? Do you know where you are? This is a school. You're disrupting my students' work.Do you know how much damage a single mistake can cause?" Kurt's voice was sharp as he confronted Eli.


Eli recognized Kurt immediately. As a businessman, he knew Kurt held valuable patents and had always wanted to collaborate with him. He gestured for his bodyguards to stand down and addressed Kurt politely, "Mr. Lowe, I apologize. I'm just trying to deal with a disobedient daughter. I understand your concerns. I'll have my men go upstairs to get her quickly to minimize the disruption." Normally. a father disciplining his child wouldn't be something a teacher would interfere with. Eli thought he was being reasonable and expected Kurt to back down.



But Kurt's response was cold. "I dare anyone to try. This is a restricted area. If your daughter is disobedient, maybe you should reflect on your own actions. Has she been mistreated? Bullied? She has a talent that deserves better. As a father, you should be ashamed of yourself for bringing such a scene here. Do you want me to record this and show the world how you treat your daughter?"



Kurt pulled out his phone, ready to record. He had recently learned about the power of social media from his students and was prepared to use it.



Eli quickly covered his face, his earlier politeness replaced by a dark expression. "Mr. Lowe, Emily has been troublesome even before we brought her back to the Johnson family. She always bullied Bianca and kept things from me. I had no idea what she was doing at school."



"Do you believe that?" Kurt scoffed, recalling Bianca's calculating demeanor. "You're just biased and foolish. Emily has been through enough. If it weren't for her talent, we would have lost a brilliant mind. She's dedicated to her research. How could she be a bad person?"



Just then, Erik and several other students arrived. Erik, wanting to make amends, stepped forward. "Mr. Johnson, you must be mistaken. Emily is a diligent student and has never bullied anyone.She even helps her classmates."



"That's right. Thinking back, Emily has never done anything to deserve such a bad reputation. Most of the negative things said about her were because of Bianca's complaints."



The students' support for Emily was clear, and their perception of Bianca began to change.
###Chapter 60 Now You Have Learned to Deceive and Swindle
"You... you used to be classmates with Emily." Kurt snapped when he saw someone defending Emily.



"Yeah, Mr. Lowe," Erik nodded.



Kurt sneered at Eli, "You heard that, right? Emily's not being difficult. She's at a crucial point in her experiment. If you really want to be a good dad, don't bother her now. Leave immediately! Or else, don't blame me for calling security and making you a trending topic: 'Dad shows favoritism, blames daughter, and brings bodyguards to school to catch her!”"



Eli faced Kurt's threat head-on.



With so many classmates having a positive impression of Emily,he knew that continuing to argue wouldn't help him take Emily away today. Just then, Eli's phone rang.


It was Isaac calling.


"Hey, Isaac... Okay, I'll be right there," he responded urgently,realizing it was a company matter.


After hanging up, he took a deep look at everyone present, waved his hand, and quickly left with his bodyguards.



"They're gone, they're gone!”



Sophia had been watching from the window. Seeing Eli leave, she exclaimed excitedly.


Emily had already finished filling in the data and writing some theoretical knowledge. Hearing Sophia's words, she packed up her things and stood up, "Let's go too!"



"Okay," Sophia followed, feeling like she couldn't keep up with Emily's thinking.
When Emily reached downstairs, Kurt was about to go up. She handed him the documents, "This should be enough for everyone for a while. I have some things to attend to in the next few days so that I won't be coming to the lab."



Kurt couldn't help but quickly scan the documents as soon as he received them, and he became excited.


"Great, I'll call you if there are any issues." His mind was already on the experiment, eager to verify the data and theories in the lab.


Emily nodded, and Kurt quickly left with the documents.



Erik and his group saw that Emily didn't even want to see her own father, Eli. They thought about finding another opportunity to apologize to her and were about to leave.



But then they saw her coming downstairs.


Erik and his group hurried forward. "Emily, we sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding about you on the campus forum. Please forgive us for our biased beliefs." "Emily, we're sorry."


Everyone else also bowed and apologized sincerely.


At that moment, Bianca, hiding in the corner and watching everything, glared at Emily with hatred.



She was momentarily stunned.


When did Emily start looking so good?



The old Emily was insecure, skinny, and timid, with no presence at all.



Now,she was radiating confidence and had grown more beautiful,almost overshadowing Bianca.



Bianca's eyes grew darker.


No way, all the glory, praise, and attention should belong to her. Emily, someone found in a trash heap, was only fit to be her tool.



As she thought about it, her chest tightened, and she couldn't help but press her hand to it, breathing heavily.



Unbeknownst to her, Emily's sharp senses detected Bianca's hostile gaze.



Emily's piercing eyes shot towards Bianca's hiding spot, catching a glimpse of a corner of her dress.



Recognizing the color and material, Emily immediately knew it was Bianca.



Emily's eyes flashed with determination.



She then regained her composure and looked at Erik and the others,"Is the campus forum incident the only mistake you made?"



Her words made some of them lower their heads in guilt. In the past,because of Bianca, they had looked down on Emily and even mocked her several times.



It wasn't as severe as the forum incident, but it had driven Emily to change her major.



"Emily,we might have misunderstood you in the past and thought you were bullying Bianca. We didn't verify the facts, and that was wrong. We'll remember this lesson and won't make similar mistakes again.We're sorry!"



Someone stepped forward and sincerely apologized,mentioning Bianca.



Others also realized that their negative impression of Emily stemmed from Bianca.



Most of those who got into Celestial University weren't foolish and quickly understood the root of the problem.



They apologized to Emily again. Sophia wanted to retort, but Emily stopped her.


Emily's expression was indifferent, "If apologies were enough,we wouldn't need the police. Forgiveness is something I can't offer.We won't be in the same class anymore, so you can leave."



The suffering and humiliation she endured were partly their fauIt.



Living a second life, she wanted to follow her heart and be a little selfish. If she didn't want to forgive, she wouldn't.



After all, she had achieved her goal.



Bianca must be furious after hearing these words.


But the corner of the dress was no longer visible, and Emily didn't care if she had left.



She walked past Erik and the others, leaving with Sophia. Emily received a call from Floyd.



"Are you free now? I have a patient with a special condition. Can you come over?"



On the other end of the line, the highly respected Floyd spoke to Emily with kindness and caution.



Emily thought for a moment, realizing she had no other urgent matters, "Okay, I'll come over now."



"Great, I'll be waiting for you," Floyd said, sounding as happy as a child.



After hanging up, Emily saw Sophia still following her.



She remnembered her promise to Sophia and said, "Before your competition, I promised to take you to meet someone, but I need to return from Emberfall City first."



"What are you going to Emberfall City for?" Sophia asked curiously.
She didn't press Emily about who she would meet.


But Sophia believed that whoever Emily introduced her to would likely be someone important.


"I have some matters to attend to, but I can't tell you yet. Are you busy right now? If not, I might need your help with something."



"Emily, whatever you need, I'm here for you," Sophia immediately offered.



Emily nodded and took out a bottle of medicine from her bag,"need you to go to the orphanage and give this medicine to the director. It's for Liam's congenital condition."



Sophia was surprised that Emily had the energy to help people at the orphanage.



Being kind-hearted herself, she quickly agreed, "Don't worry, Emily.I'll take care of it." Emily felt reassured.


After parting ways with Sophia, she took a cab to Floyd's place.



As soon as Emily arrived at the pharmacy, an employee recognized her and led her to the back room.



"Emily, come quickly," Floyd said, leading her into the room.



As soon as Emily entered, she locked eyes with the person standing opposite her.



"What are you doing here?" the person asked, their face darkening.



Floyd frowned,displeased with the person's reaction. He stood up for Emily, "This is the doctor I told you about,Emily."



"Her?" The man laughed coldly, looking at Emily with disdain,"You've stooped so low as to resort to trickery now?"
###Chapter 61 Words Spoken in Anger Are the Most Genuine
"Chase, do you know her?" A wwoman lay on the hospital bed, her eyes dark and sunken, her body frail and thin.



Despite her condition, her bone structure and features revealed she was a beauty.



At this moment, hearing Chase's words, she struggled to lift her gaze and looked at Emily, asking.



"Of course, I know her. She's not some amazing doctor, just a daughter we found in the trash heap." Chase's cold expression immediately softened upon hearing Aurora Rivera's voice, and he patiently explained.



After explaining, he turned to Emily,′′Iknew you were restless, but I didn't expect you to turn out like this. I came back this time to teach you a lesson. You're coming home with me." His tone left no room for refusal.



In the past, Emily would have immediately apologized and obediently followed.



But now, Emily had no intention of complying



Her gaze was more focused on the weak person on the bed.



'So, this is the person Chase likes?



In her previous life, she didn't know about Aurora's existence at first. When her friend fell in love with Chase at first sight, she begged Emily to help.



Emily agreed to set them up.



If Chase had outright rejected her friend, it would have been fine.


 
But he accepted her friend's affection, even married her, only to become cold and abusive when Aurora returned.


1By the time Emily saved Hayden and returned to the country,her friend had already left in heartbreak and despair.



When Chase regretted it and wanted to win her back, it was too late.



She hadn't expected Chase and Aurora to repeat their history so soon.



If the problem was solely with Chase, if he was the one pursuing Aurora, Emily wouldn't blame Aurora.



But Aurora initially looked down on Chase for being a minor celebrity. Later, when Chase became a Best Actor and his identity as a member of the Johnson family was revealed, Aurora knew Chase had a wife but still maintained an ambiguous, flirtatious attitude towards him. That was her fault.



Thinking of this, Emily's expression grew even colder. "Chase, you should leave. I think Emily doesn't like me very much.She probably knows you're here to see me, so she pretended to be a doctor to try to kill me," Aurora said coldly, sensing Emily's displeasure.



Chase's gaze shot towards Emily.



He saw Emily looking coldly at Aurora, and his face darkened.



He stepped forward and forcefully grabbed Emily, "Who taught you to look at people like that? Apologize to Aurora right now, and then go back to the Johnson Villa and wait for me. You'd better listen,or don't blame me for being harsh when I get back."



Chase threatened coldly.



But as soon as his hand grabbed her wrist, Emily twisted his arm behind his back.


"...Emily, what are you doing? Let go of me, are you crazy?" Chase gritted his teeth, sweat forming on his forehead from the pain. Aurora was startled by Emily's sudden action but quickly regained her composure.



Pretending to be concerned, she said, "You don't need to show off for me. Chase being here is just a coincidence. If you don't want us to have any interaction, take him away. Whether I live or die has nothing to do with him. Take him away."



She turned to Floyd, "Mr. Ryan, we trusted your medical skills.Even if you can't treat me, you shouldn't introduce such a young girl. You heard Chase admit she doesn't know anything about medicine. This is fraud! It's risking lives! We're done here, Vida, let's go."



She decisively instructed her assistant, Vida.



"Yes, Ms. Rivera, I'll help youa!" Vida quickly stepped forward to assist her.



"Emily, let go of me!" Chase struggled, trying to break free from Emily. Emily suddenly released him, causing him to stumble.



His agent caught him just in time, preventing him from hitting the wall.



Freed, Chase hurried to catch up with Aurora.



"Aurora, don't go. This is all Emily's fault. I'll make sure she gets punished. Don't worry, if Mr. Ryan can't help, I'll find a way to cure you."



Chase's usual cold demeanor was replaced by the image of a cluamsy boy chasing his beloved.



Emily watched the scene unfold.



Aurora played hard to get, stepping back to avoid Chase's hand,her tone softening, "I appreciate your kindness. I know my condition well. Let's leave it to fate. I'll go now. Thank you for today."


 
She bit her lip and tried to walk out. Wait!"



Floyd, who had been silent, called out to Aurora.



Though Floyd couldn't cure Aurora, he was a respected figure in the medical field, surrounded by experts. Aurora couldn't afford to be rude.



Aurora, pale and frail, asked, "Mr. Ryan, is there something else?"



Floyd snorted,"Idon't mind you questioning my skills. I can't cure your illness, and I understand your resentment. But you shouldn't doubt Emily's abilities. Apologize, now!"



Aurora and Chase's faces changed.


Aurora's nails dug into Vida's flesh, but she refused to apologize,"Mr. Ryan, I don't know how she's deceived you, but I trust Chase.She doesn't know anything about medicine. I won't apologize."



"You..." Floyd was about to speak. Emily stepped forward.



She sneered at Aurora, "I don't want an insincere apology. But you'd better find a good doctor soon, or your body will start to rot."



"Emily, you're so vicious. How dare you curse Aurora? You need a lesson..."



Chase,furious,raised his hand to slap Emily.



Emily, now quick to react, wouldn't stand there and take it.



She struck first, slapping Chase.



"You dare hit me? Are you crazy?" Chase looked at Emily in disbelief.



As a celebrity, he always took care of his skin. Emily's slap instantly made his face swell. Feeling the pain, he tried to hit Emily, "I'll teach you a lesson today."



He thought the slap was an accident, that he hadn't reacted in time.


Emily dodged and took out her phone, recording his angry,disheveled state.



"What are you doing? You trash heap reject...


Chase,furious, spat out hurtful words.


Emily froze.


'They say a man's words in anger reveal his true thoughts.'



It turned out he never truly respected her. His previous kindness was just a facade.



Lost in thought, Emily didn't dodge Chase's slap, which landed on
her face.
###Chapter 62 Hands Hurt from Hitting


"Do you have a death wish?"



Emily's face was ice-cold.



She raised her hand and slapped him again.



"This one's for the slap you just gave me."



"Emily,you..."



Before he couald finish, Emily slapped him again. "This one's for betraying my genuine care and help."



"You..."



Emily continued with another slap. "This one's for your blindness and heartlessness. We're done. From now on, we're just strangers!"
After finishing. Emily shook her hand. "How shameless!"



Her hand hurt a bit.



Chase was stunned by the series of slaps.



When he finally reacted, he was furious, almost lunging at her.



This happened right in front of the person he liked. How could he allow this?



Emily didn't hold back either. She kicked Chase away and then waved her phone at Chase's manager.′′Ijust recorded Chase's embarrassing state. If I add a headline: 'Chase beats his own sister for another woman, look at him now. Who would still want to be his fan? Do you think this would trend?"



Chase's public image was that of a single man. If it were just revealed that he had a woman he loved, fans might not react too strongly. But if they found out he beat his sister for a woman, cold and heartless, it would be over for him, Chase's manager wasn't as impulsive and foolish as Chase;otherwise.Chase wouldn't have reached his current status.



He had witnessed Emily's kindness to Chase. Hearing Emily's words, he nodded to her.



He forcefully dragged Chase away.



"Emily, you just wait. This isn't over. Delete those photos, or Il have the Johnson family kick you out completely."



Chase dared to threaten even as he was being dragged away.



Emily dug her ear, not caring.



Floyd, on the other hand, felt a bit embarrassed. "Emily, I'm sorry.I didn't know these people were so ungrateful. And that man, he's your brother? Does your family treat you poorly?”



Although Emily's medical skills were far superior to his, he still saw her as a junior due to her age. Seeing her words and Chase's attitude, Floyd felt guilty and concerned.



Emily no longer felt hurt.



She replied indifferently, "Mr. Ryan, you don't need to feel guilty.I stopped caring a long time ago. As for the treatment, it's their loss.not ours."



Floyd thought that since Emily was here today, she might as well see patients.



But before he could speak, Emily's phone rang.



"Hello!" Seeing it was Sophia calling, Emily answered.


"Emily, something's wrong. Guess who I ran into? Eli. I heard he's here to adopt Liam, Why would he want to adopt Liam?"



Sophia,upon seeing Eli, immediately felt alarmed, sensing his scheming nature. And how coincidental that Liam was someone Emily knew.



Could it be that Eli found out and wanted to use this to control Emily?


Sophia's imagination was quite vivid, and she was almost right.



"I'll be right there. Please stall him, don't let the adoption process go through quickly."



Emily hung up and received a call from the orphanage director,saying someone wanted to adopt Liam, without specifying it was Eli.



But she already knew. She asked the director to wait for her, saying she'd be there soon.



Emily immediately called Aaron, asking him to prepare all the adoption paperwork and have a couple ready to go to the orphanage, while she quickly hailed a cab. But when you're in a hurry, cabs are always hard to find.


Emily's usually calm face showed rare signs of anxiety.



"Need a ride? Hop in!"



A sleek Maybach pulled up beside Emily, and the window rolled down to reveal Daniel's cool and aloof face.



′′Isit on the way? I'm heading to the orphanage on Willow Street,"Emily asked after a moment's thought.



"Yeah, it's on the way," Daniel replied in his deep voice


Emily felt a surge of relief. "Great, thanks a lot."



She got into the car without hesitation.


York, the driver, couldn't help but glance at Daniel through the rearview mirror. They were supposed to head north,while Willow
Street was south-completely opposite directions. But he didn't dare say anything and quickly met Daniel's intense gaze.York
immediately looked away and focused on driving



The car fell into an awkward silence.



Feeling grateful for the help, Emily wanted to repay the favor somehow. She tentatively spoke, "Mr. Smith, the doctor treating you has informed mne. I'll be responsible for your dietary safety at home.Are you going home for dinner tonight? W/hat would you like to eat? I'll make sure it's nutritious and safe while catering to your preferences."



Daniel, hearing her calmly use a fake identity, almost laughed. His lips curved slightly. "Yeah, I'll be home for dinner. I'm not picky,you decide."



"Alright!"



Emily awkwardly wondered if she should say more.


Daniel spoke again, "You're heading to the orphanage. Is there something urgent?"


After asking, he politely apologized, "Sorry, I might be overstepping.If it's inconvenient..."



"It's not inconvenient. Before I returned to the Johnson family, I met a kind old man while picking up trash. He's no longer here, but his grandson is in the orphanage, with poor health. I want to bring him home."



Reborn, Emily was vengeful but maintained her core values,repaying kindness. This was taught by Elijah, the old man who collected recyclables. He sowed good deeds and reaped good results.



Daniel's deep eyes flashed with a hint of light. She kept breaking people's perceptions of her, yet she wasn't annoying. On the contrary,she had a strong personal charm.



"From what I know,you don't meet the adoption criteria. Do you need my help?" Daniel asked calmly.



Emily gratefully glanced at him, surprised that Daniel considered this and even offered help. Who said Daniel was ruthless and unfeeling? He was clearly kind and gentle.



"Thank you, but no need. I've considered this issue and have a plan." Emily declined his offer.



The car smoothly arrived at the orphanage entrance.



"Mr. Smith, thank you. I'll make something delicious tonight to thank you. You need rest, no need to get out." Emily quickly got out, waving goodbye.



Daniel's brows furrowed slightly. He maintained his usual indifferent demeanor and didn't get out. As he was about to roll up the window, York parked the car a bit further.



Another car arrived.


Emily quickly approached the car. Daniel paused his action, seeing a young man with a gentle smile leading a couple out. Emily greeted the young man naturally and relaxedly, a familiarity and ease Daniel had never seen. Daniel's face darkened: Who is this person? When did she have such a young man around her? After all, his investigation didn't reveal this.
###Chapter 63 Threatening with Children


"Emily, meet the family I've arranged to adopt Liam," Aaron introdluced the couple standing beside him to Emily.



Emily nodded at the couple. "Thanks for your help."



"Don't worry, Ms. Johnson. We'll take good care of everything," the couple assured her.



Emily smiled at Aaron. "Time's tight. Let's get moving."



With that, Emily and Aaron walked ahead, the couple following closely behind.



What Emily didn't know was that Eli was using his influence to pressure the director into agreeing to the adoption.



Sophia was indeed trying to buy time. But as a young woman who didn't meet the adoption crítería,she was outmatched in every way-numbers, authority, and conditions.


"Mr. Johnson, instead of adopting another kid, why don't you treat your own daughter better? If you can't even be good to your own blood, how can anyone believe you'll be good to Liam? Just Iet him go," Sophia said sarcastically, throwing caution to the wind.



The Brown family was powerful, but the Johnson family was equally formidable, especially with the backing of the Smith family, making them even more influential.



"Sophia, I know you don't get along with Bianca, and I've never held it against you. But now you're interfering with my business and speaking to me like this? I'll have a word with your father about your upbringing," Eli said sternly, assuming the role of an elder scolding a junior.



Sophia was disgusted by Eli's attitude.



She didn't want to waste words with him and focused on getting Liam away. Ignoring Eli, she hurried to Liam's side and tried to pull him towards her.



But the bodyguard, following Eli's orders, didn't let go.



Sophia tugged a bit harder, but the bodyguard's grip tightened,causing Liam pain. Unfamiliar with both Sophia and Eli,Liam was scared and in pain, and he started crying.



Sophia's heart softened, and she had to let go.



Eli remained indifferent. "Director, you see, this girl is just causing trouble. She's barely an adult herself and doesn't respect her elders.I'm clearly the better choice to adopt this child,don't you think?"



"If you agree, I'll make another donation to the orphanage. But if you don't, I doubt this place will stay open for long," Eli threatened.



The director's face darkened, realizing Eli wasn't a kind person.
This didn't bode well for Liam, but the director had to consider the other children,too. Just as the director was about to reluctantly agree, he said,"Fine,Mr. Johnson, please take good care of the child. If you ever decide you don't want Liam, bring him back rather than let him suffer."


Eli, impatient from the start, was in no mood to waste more time.He had been summoned by Isaac earlier, only to be dismissed without any real reason, clearly a ploy to annoy him. He suspected it was Emily's doing, and he wanted to use Liam to threaten her.



"Alright, I get it. Director, just get the paperwork done so I can take him," Eli said irritably.



"No, you can't!" Sophia blocked the way, arms outstretched.


Eli looked at Sophia coldly, "Your dad's not here, so I'll teach you a lesson. You, pull her away."


He signaled the bodyguards to act,


"Let go of me... Help! They're bullying a girl!" Sophia shouted,flailing her arms to keep them at bay. "Stop!"



Just as Sophia was about to be overpowered, Emily arrived just in time.



She shouted, and before anyone could react, she grabbed one of the bodyguards' wrists, making him release his grip in pain.



Emily quickly pulled Sophia behind her and faced Eli with a cold stare.



"Perfect timing. You've become even more of a disgrace, siding with Sophia. You know she doesn't get along with Bianca. It's clear that you've been bullying Bianca all along. You're hopeless," Eli snarled,his face dark with anger.



Emily was numb to his accusations. Her eyes fell on the crying Liam,held by the bodyguard.


"You're no better, bullying a three-year-old. Let Liam go, or you'll regret it," Emily said, her voice icy and fearless. "You dare threaten me? Grab her!" Eli ordered, laughing in anger.



This time, he witnessed Emily's strength firsthand.



The bodyguards barely approached her before they were on the ground after just a few moves.



"Adoption isn't a fight. I have a family here ready to adopt Liam.You won't take him," Emily said, stepping aside to reveal the couple behind her.



She turned to the director. "Ihave a qualified couple ready to adopt.Can you process the paperwork? We have all the necessary documents."



"And if I refuse? I don't care who you brought. You're not taking him from me!" Eli blocked Liam, preventing Emily from getting close.


 
Emily's eyes narrowed dangerously. Aaron, who had been ready to support Emily, saw her expression and sympathetically stepped back, leaving the stage to her.


"Is that so? Then watch the Johnson Group's stock plummet," Emily said with a cold smile. Before Eli could react, she turned to Sophia."Record this. Title it: [Johnson Group's CEO brings bodyguards to orphanage to snatch a child, threatens his own daughter. Is it moral decay or ulterior motives?]"



She looked at Eli with a mocking smile. "How's that for a headline,Mr.Johnson? If it's not enough, I can come up with countless more."



"Dammit!" Eli was furious but didn't act impulsively.



He signaled the bodyguard.



The bodyguard's hand, which had been holding Liam's arm,suddenly moved to his neck.



"Emily... help... I can't breathe..." Liam's face turned red, struggling for air. Eli coldly said, "If you come with me to apologize to the Reyes family, I won't harm this child. Otherwise, no one leaves here today.This sickly child might just suffocate to death."
###Chapter 64 Keep Talking, and You Won't Need to Talk anymore
"Alright!"



"What?"



"I said, 'Alright.' I'll go with you to the Reyes Villa!"



Emily's sudden agreement left Eli momentarily stunned.



Emily repeated herself, her eyes cold as ice, "Now, can you let go of Liam?"



Eli shot Emily a cold glance and signaled to the bodyguards.



Liam was released, gasping and coughing, tears streaming down his face. His small frame made the scene even more heart-wrenching.



Eli,seemingly afraid that Emily might change her mind, didn't fully release Liam from the bodyguards' grip.


"You're still too green to fight me. Let's go!" Eli sneered, ready to drag Liam out.



He knew Emily cared about Liam, so he wasn't worried she wouldn't follow.



"Hold on!"



Aaron frowned,blocking Eli's path. "Mr. Johnson, if you let go of Liam,I can..."



"Aaron!" Emily cut him off, knowing what he was about to say.



She'd rather lose those benefits than give in to Eli.



Her face was calm, but her eyes were resolute.


Aaron understood her meaning but was still worried. "But if you go with him, he's clearly going to humiliate you."


"Exactly, Emily, you can't go. El is a complete scumbag. Who knows what he'll do to you at the Reyes Villa!" Sophia echoed, her concern evident.



Eli's gaze shifted to Aaron's face.



"Who are you?"



He recalled Bianca saying that Emily must have been influenced by some unsavory characters to become so rebellious.



His tone was icy, his eyes scrutinizing Aaron with hostility.



Aaron looked decent enough, not like the thug Eli had imagined.



However,some people are adept at concealing their true nature.



"Who he is has nothing to do with you. Aren't we leaving? Stop wasting time, let's go!"


Emily didn't like the way Eli was looking at her friend, so she stepped in front of Aaron, her voice cold.



To Eli, this protective stance meant Emily cared about Aaron.



Eli was furious. "Is this the reason you've been causing trouble at home and with James? Because of this man? Is he the one secretly encouraging you?"



"You're so ignorant. He can't compare to James in any way. Break it off with him immediately. When we get back, you're moving back to the Johnson Villa."



Eli's words insulted both Emily and Aaron.



Aaron felt grateful for Emily's defense but was fed up with Eli's endless tirade.



He knew how poorly Emily wwas treated at the Johnson Villa and had long been dissatisfied with Eli. If not for Emily, he would have taken action against the Johnson Group already.



Recently, he noticed Emily waking up to the reality of her situation and was planning his move when Eli walked right into it.



"Take your finger away, or even if you're Emily's father, I won't be polite."



His presence made the air around them drop a few degrees, his voice chilling.



Despite his usual good-natured demeanor with Emily, Aaron was not someone to be trifled with.



The Hill family was well-respected, though not wealthy. Aaron was the only one in the family to go into business, which had caused some disapproval. He wasn't allowed to use the Hill family name,so few knew he was one of them.



Emily didn't want Aaron to get involved. She tugged at his hand. Then she turned to Eli,"11you don't want to go, just give Liam to me. I have other things to do."


Eli hadn't expected some random person to dare challenge him.



But the Reyes family matter was urgent. He'd have someone look into Aaron later.



"Let's go!"



Eli motioned for Emily to follow.



Sophia,stilI worried, wanted to come along. Emily leaned in and whispered, "Stay here and help me finalize Liam's adoption papers."



"You mean... alright, I promise to get it done."



Sophia's eyes lit up.



This meant Emily had a plan and would come back from the Reyes Villa unscathed.



She had great faith in Emily. If Emily said it, it must be true.



Emily didn't explain further. She turned to Aaron, "Once the papers are done, please make sure my friend Sophia gets home safely."



Aaron was still worried.



Emily smiled confidently,"Dco you think I'm someone who would let myself be taken advantage of?"



Her smile widened, but it was cold."For those who try to play me,I always collect interest!"



Aaron shivered.



Eli had no idea he was provoking the wrong person. He knew Emily was ready to act. So he didn't insist on following.



"Get in the car!"



As Emily walked out, Eli waited by the car, indicating she should ride with him.



Emily hesitated.



Eli spoke,"I need to talk to you about James. I thought you were just.confused, but now I see you're rotten to the core. If James knew you were involved with such people, do you think he'd still want to be with you?"



"So what?"



Emily knew this accusation was probably another one of Bianca's fabrications.



It was laughable that her own father, Eli, didn't defend her but immediately believed Bianca's lies. He even thought she was an embarrassment. "What's with your attitude? No wonder James is getting more impatient with you. I don't think your engagement will last. I suggested to James that he should find a new fiancée. Your sister Bianca is so much more outstanding and sensible, a perfect match for James. He's already agreed."



Eli lied.



James had refused, but Eli thought that, given Emily's troublesome and unclean nature, it was better to pair Bianca with James.



James didn't reject Bianca, probably only hesitating because of Emily.



With this in mind, Eli continued, "Since you've decided to break off the engagement with James, do it cleanly and stop bothering him."



Emily dug her nails into her palm to keep her emotions in check.
So, the Johnson family had been planning for Bianca to be with James all along.



James was truly hypocritical, being with Bianca while pretending to be devoted to her.



Emily felt nothing but disgust.



So dirty, so disgusting!



How could she have been so foolish in her past life?



"What's wrong with you? Are you pregnant? Whose child is it?James hasn't been with you recently, so it can't be his!"



Eli's face darkened. "How could you be so shameless? After the Reyes family matter is settled, we will go to the hospital. If you're really pregnant, we'll get rid of it!"
###Chapter 65 Wanting to See Her Being Humiliated
"Not pregnant! Disappointed?"That was her dad.



What kind of father, when his daughter is feeling sick and throwing up,would first accuse her of being pregnant with another man's child instead of showing concern for her health?



"What are you talking about? I'm your father, and I'm just worried about you!"



Emily sneered, "With your kind of concern, I can hardly bear it. A real father wouldn't suspect his daughter of being promiscuous when she's feeling unwell!"



"It's because you've been staying out all night and hanging out with shady people!" Eli retorted, though he was momentarily taken aback.



Emily couldn't be bothered to respond. She didn't even want to share a car with him and was about to call for a ride.



Just then, a tall figure walked straight towards her.



Emily looked over and saw a Maybach not far behind him, her eyes widening in surprise.



She thought Daniel would have left by now, but his car was still there.



This meant he was still in the car.



"Ms. Johnson, are you in trouble? Mr. Smith hasn't left yet and asked me to invite you to join him in the car for a ride," York said respectfully.



Emily didn't fully believe York's words.



It wasn't that Daniel just happened to be there; he probably stayed to make sure she was okay. Whether it was because she had helped him at the hospital or because he needed her to monitor his daily meals, the fact that he was willing to wait for her made Emily grateful.



Maybe Daniel was a soft-hearted person beneath his cold exterior.



"Alright."



Emily nodded and was about to follow York to the car.



Eli's face darkened, "What are you doing? Hanging out with more shady people..."



"Mr. Johnson, watch your words!"


Before Eli could finish, York,who had already walked away,suddenly stopped and turned back with a menacing glare.



He was someone who had seen real bloodshed, and his presence exuded a chilling aura, Eli was so frightened that he shut his mouth.


After regaining his composure, he felt a bit embarrassed and more curious about who could have such a formidable subordinate.



Thinking of this, Eli couldn't help but follow, wanting to see who was in the car.



He initially thought it was someone Aaron had taught, but now it seemed more likely to be someone else.



Of course, Emily, as a member of the Johnson family,was shamelessly flirting with one man after another outside.



The car door opened.


Emily saw the person inside, his entire body hidden in the shadows.



As the door opened, light spilled in, highlighting his sharp features,making it hard to look away. Even though she had seen himmany times, Emily's heart still raced.



She steadied her heartbeat and got into the car.


Eli had caught up and craned his neck to look inside.



Emily sensed his gaze and instinctively used her body to block Eli's view.



"Move aside, I want to see who you're hiding..."



Before Eli could finish, someone grabbed him by the collar and tossed him aside.



Fortunately, the bodyguard who had followed caught him in time,preventing him from hitting the ground.



"Three strikes and you're out. Keep talking, and you won't need to talk anymore," York said coldly, his voice dripping with menace. "Do you know who I am? How dare you treat me like this! Emily get out of the car, or do you not care about Liam anymore?"


Eli stood up, furious, trying to use his status to intimidate York.



York sneered, "I don't care who you are. There won't be a next time."



York remained unfazed, giving Eli a cold glance before getting into the car and starting the engine.



Emily slightly opened the car window and said indifferently, "With Liam in your hands, are you stiIl worried I might run away? I'll follow."



Eli's face darkened, but he didn't continue to argue with Emily.



He returned to his car and instructed the driver to head to the Reyes Villa.




Seeing this, Emily turned to Daniel with an apologetic look,′′Mr. Smith, I'm sorry you got dragged into this and were insulted because of me."



"You weren't the one insulting me, and you're also a victim. Why would I blame you?" Daniel replied calmly, looking at her.



Emily thought to herself that such a reasonable and clear-sighted Daniel was nothing like the rumors. She decided that when she got home,she would make him a nice meal as a gesture of thanks.



However, she had a question.



"Mr. Smith, didn't you have something to do? Waiting for me and taking me to the Reyes Villa, won't it delay your work?" Emily asked,feeling a bit embarrassed.



Daniel absentmindedly played with the jade ring on his thumb,his eyes deep and distant, "I wasn't waiting for you on purpose. I fell asleep in the car. It's just a coincidence.I've arranged for someone else to handle my work, so it won't be delayed."



Oh,she thought. She almost let herself believe he was waiting for her on purpose.


The car fell into silence again. But this time, there wasn't the usual oppressive feeling when she was alone with him. Emily decided to close her eyes and rest.



Outside, tall trees blocked most of the sunlight, and the leaves filtered the light into patches that fell on her long eyelashes. Daniel turned his head, watching her eyelashes flutter. Her smooth face had gained some softness, showing a youthful blush and charm. A few strands of hair rebelliously fell out of place.



Daniel raised his hand. But he hesitated, his eyes growing darker,his Adam's apple bobbing. In the end, he withdrew his hand. The atmosphere was filled with a subtle, warm tension.



Meanwhile,Eli was having a hard time in his car. Liam, sitting in the unfamiliar car with the unfamiliar Eli, who was at odds with Emily, was scared and couldn't stop crying.



Eli couldn't take it anymore and snapped, "Shut up!" Liam was so frightened that he stopped crying immediately,but shrank back in his seat. Eli frowned. He hadn't even done anything to the kid. Maybe it was better not to adopt him after all.



Just then, Bianca called.



"Dad, where are you? I was discussing the design draft with my teacher, and when I looked for you,you were gone."



She had already signed up for the design competition and called to check on him to maintain her good daughter image.



Eli's mood brightened. Even though Emily was troublesome, having a daughter like Bianca was a comfort.



"I'm on my way to the Reyes Villa with Emily. This time, no matter what, she has to apologize to Byron. Only by getting his forgiveness can we ensure our families' cooperation."



Eli didn't hide anything from Bianca, "Bianca, you're right. Emily has been led astray by bad influences. I need to find out who these men are and get rid of them." Bianca was taken aback. She had just been guessing, but it turned out to be true. This explained why Emily had changed so quickly.But the fact that Emily was seeing other men without her knowledge meant she needed to keep a closer eye on her.



"Dad,will the Reyes family make things difficult for Emily? Perhaps I should pay a visit to the Reyes Villa. Byron has a good impression of me, and I might be able to persuade him to go easy on Emily,"



Bianca seemed genuinely concerned for Emily. This made Eli even more pleased. A daughter like Bianca was the pride of the Johnson family.



"If it doesn't interfere with your work, then come. Emily is so ungrateful. She doesn't appreciate having a sister like you who cares so much about her."



Eli couldn't help but complain about Emily again. Bianca comforted him a bit more before hanging up. She then called for a ride straight to the Reyes Villa. She couldn't miss Emily's apology to Byron!
###Chapter 66 Helping to Ask for Benefits


The Reyes Villa.


"Mr. Smith, you don't have to wait for me. I might be a while. Plus, you need to go back and get some rest."


Emily spoke up before getting out of the car, hoping to avoid another incident like the one at the orphanage.


'Is she worried about me?'

Daniel met Emily's sincere gaze and held back a smile. "Alright."


Emily took a moment in the car.


Eli, like a cat sniffing out fish, approached again, eager to catch a glimpse of Daniel.


Emily smirked.


Not giving him the chance,

She quickly got out, shut the door, and had York drive away immediately.


Eli was left eating dust.


Emily was in a great mood and couldn't help but laugh


"You jerk!"


Eli was furious.

Emily shook her head playfully, raising her eyebrows in delight. "Emily, this is the Reyes Villa. How can you act so recklessly and make Dad this angry? You should apologize to him right away!"


Bianca arrived just then, scolding disapprovingly.

Emily glanced at her sideways. "Why are you everywhere?"


"How can you talk to Bianca like that? She's only trying to help you. She has a good relationship with Byron and thought she could help calm the Reyes family down. You're so ungrateful!"


Eli couldn't help but scold.

Emily rolled her eyes. "I don't need it!"

"You..."

"Alright, Dad, I don't mind. Don't scold Emily anymore. After all, we're at the Reyes Villa."


Bianca tried to mediate graciously.

Eli saw the Reyes family butler coming out and suppressed his anger, refraining from scolding further.

Eli had been here before, so the butler recognized him and went inside to announce their arrival.

Soon, the butler opened the door and led them in.

In the past, Isaac would have come out to greet them. Now, knowing Emily and Eli didn't get along, he didn't bother pretending.


So, he didn't come out to greet them.

Eli noticed the difference and was quite displeased. All because of Emily.

He couldn't help but glare at Emily again.

Once inside.

Isaac, who had been sitting, lit up when he saw Emily behind Eli and excitedly got up to greet her.

To Eli, it seemed Isaac was excited to see Bianca.


Bianca thought the same.

She proudly stepped forward, smiling. "Mr. Reyes, we're sorry about last time, so we brought Emly to apologize in person today."


Isaac's path to Emily was, blocked by Bianca stepping forward.


He glanced at Emily, puzzled by Bianca's words.


Emily mouthed silently,"My identity, keep it secret!"

Isaac immediately understood Emily's meaning.


He looked back at Bianca and nodded. "Really?I thought the Johnson family would pretend nothing happened!"


Bianca stiffened at Isaac's sarcastic words.


But she quickly adjusted.

Isaac's tone was a result of his anger. Eli quickly pulled Emily forward. "What are you standing there for? Apologize to Mr.Reyes!"

He smiled at Isaac. "Isaac, Emily was thoughtless. She's here to apologize in person. Please forgive her. If you want to punish her, I won't object."

Isaac could tell Eli didn't care about Emily at all.

Emily seemed to have really behaved since entering the Reyes Villa.

Eli told her to apologize, and she obediently stepped forward.


"Mr. Reyes, I'm from the Johnson family. My dad brought me to apologize in person.Sorry for the trouble."

Emily apologized obediently.

But Eli and Bianca frowned.

Something felt off.

They soon realized what it was.

Isaac understood Emily's intention.

"A father's failure to teach is his fault. Eli, you need to discipline your daughter better," he said.

Eli thought Isaac was softening and quickly nodded with a smile. "Yes, yes, don't worry. I'll make sure to educate her properly."

Bianca added, "Mr. Reyes, it's my fault for not guiding my sister well. I'll make sure to keep her in line."

Isaac nodded. "Good. Since Emily is from the Johnson family, there should be compensation for her mistake,right?" Eli's heart sank.

He had been tricked.

Isaac wasn't as easygoing as he seemed. He was waiting for this.

But Eli couldn't refuse now.

"Of course, Isaac. Whatever you need, just say it. We won't delay any compensation."

Eli suppressed his resentment and smiled.


But he was thinking that Emily had caused such a loss for the Johnson Group. She was only useful for an advantageous marriage.


James would go to Bianca, so he'd find another beneficial match for Emily.


Emily had no idea Eli was planning to sell her out.

"Alright, I think our current project should have an additional five percent, don't you?"

Isaac smiled.

Five percent was too high.

Eli hesitated, and after some back-and-forth, they settled on three percent.

Bianca,though not well-versed in business, understood the basic numbers.

She took the opportunity to lecture Emily. "Emily, because of your thoughtlessness, the Johnson Group will lose at least millions of dollars. And Dad, for your sake, agreed to such a big concession. Don't say he's biased. Stop messing around and come home,okay?" Home, to continue being her shadow?

Emily's expressiona remained indifferent. "If Dad could resolve it this way,why wait until now?"

It was because this loss was insignificant to the Johnson Group.

Bianca looked at Emily with feigned heartbreak. "Emily, why are you still so thoughtless? And do you think this is over? You still need to apologize to Byron and get his forgiveness for this to be truly resolved."


Emily intended to see Byron.

But Bianca was eager to see her humiliated.

"Mr. Reyes, how is Byron? Emily wants to apologize to him in person. Should I take her upstairs?"

Eli,having lost out, was in a foul mood.

He didn't expect Bianca to make this request.

He looked at her, puzzled and annoyed, whispering, "Isn't it over? Why bring this up?"

Bianca replied, "Dad, you don't think Mr. Reyes is done, do you? He cares about Byron. We need to show the right attitude. And it's rare for Emily to cooperate and come to the Reyes Villa."


Eli was convinced and agreed. "Let Emily apologize to your son in person. It might help Byron recover faster."


Isaac glanced at Emily, who nodded. He then agreed."Alright."

He led them to Byron's room.

"What happened?" Bianca exclaimed upon seeing the person in bed!
###Chapter 67 Subduing Byron


"Get out!"


Byron lay on the bed, looking like a shadow of his former self. His eyes were hollow, and his cheeks were so sunken he was almost unrecognizable.


Hearing the commotion, he glanced at the newcomer with a dark look in his eyes.

Even Bianca, standing right in front of him, couldn't stir any interest. His irritation made his words sharp and cutting.


The pain was coming back.

He even wanted to die.

After shouting, he looked away, but out of the corner of his eye, he saw someone. He couldn't believe it and looked again.


Emily gave him a calm look.

The moment their eyes met, Byron almost burst into tears.

"You,you,you..."

He struggled to get up and crawl to Emily.

But his body, tormented by illness, had no strength to move.


To Eli and Bianca, it looked like Byron was still holding a grudge against Emily, which was why he was so agitated upon seeing her. Bianca suppressed a smile and pretended to be kind as she went to help Byron. "Byron, don't get worked up.Emily is here to apologize to you today. Please, for the sake of our families' long-standing relationship.forgive her for her mistake."


"Ap-apologize? Dad.Dad..."

Byron was on the verge of tears, trying to push Bianca away.

It was because of her that he had targeted Emily.

He couldn't get close to her, or he wouldn't know how he might die.

But he hadn't rested well for days, and his mind was a bit slow. The more he wanted to express something.the more his agitation made it hard to speak.

"Don't worry, I understand!" Isaac knew why Byron was so agitated.

These past few days, Byron had spent most of his time in pain, unable to eat or rest properly. They had consulted every doctor, all of whom said he wasn't sick.

But he was still in agony.

At first, Isaac thouight Byron was faking it, but as time went on, Byron's voice became hoarse from shouting,he couldn't eat, and he writhed in pain on the bed every day. Byron didn't have the acting skills to fake this,so Isaac finally believed him.


Bianca also noticed something unusual about Byron. She thought that if she could use her medical skills to help him, he would become her most loyal follower.


"Mr.Reyes, what's wrong with Byron? I know a bit about medicine. Why don't I take a look?" Bianca said confidently. Eli's eyes flashed with understanding, immediately grasping Bianca's intention.


He suggested to Isaac, "Why not let Bianca take a look? She's not only an art school graduate but also a top student in medical school, about to compete in a medical competition."


Mentioning Bianca's credentials, Eli proudly raised his head.

Isaac also realized that the Johnson family probably didn't know Emily had medical skills, and quite advanced ones at that.

Isaac looked at Byron. "Do you want Bianca to take a look at you?"

Byron, agitated, shouted, "No, no, no, I don't want her!"

"Alright, alright! Don't get worked up!"

Isaac shook his head at Eli. "You see how itis."

Bianca felt a bit disappointed and embarrassed by Byron's outburst.

But if he treated her this way, he would likely be even worse to Emily.

"Emily, hurry up and apologize to Byron. Calm him down. Look at what you've done to him. Don't you feel any guilt?" Bianca pulled Emily over and urged her.

Emily shook off Bianca's hand, brushing her arm as if she were getting rid of trash.

Then she spoke to Byron, "I'm not great at apologizing in front of a crowd. Can Bianca and Eli leave? You don't mind, do you?"


Byron,having heard from Isaac that Emily had agreed to treat him, immediately understood her meaning. He nodded eagerly. "No. I don't mind at all!"

"Dad, make them leave, please!" Byron turned to Isaac urgently.

"Eli,Bianca,please."

Isaac spoke as he ushered them out, not giving them a chance to argue.

Now,only Emily and Byron were left in the room.


Whether it was hope or something else, Byron, who had been weak moments ago, suddenly found some strength.


He rolled off the bed and knelt before Emily, grabbing her legs and sobbing, "I know I was wrong. Please,treat me. I was wrong. I won't do it again."


Byron, once so arrogant, now groveled like a puppy.

"Let go, you're filthy!" Emily kicked him lightly, and Byron rolled away.

But without Emily's confirmation, he didn't dare get up and crawled back to kneel again.

This time, he didn't dare touch Emily's legs, afraid of angering her.

"Alright, get up. I'll treat you now."

Emily didn't make things difficult for Byron. She had the means to make him suffer without a solution once,and she could do it again.


So,even if she cured him, she wasn't worried about him disobeying.

Byron was so relieved he almost fainted. He looked at Emily with hopeful eyes. Emily took out some acupuncture needles and swiftly inserted them into several points on Byron's body with precision.


Byron didn't dare move.

Her skill with the needles made him think of a true medical expert. He felt nothing but awe.

The effect was immediate.


He felt a warm sensation spreading through his body.


Byron closed his eyes in comfort.


Emily couldn't bear to look.


This guy wasn't very bright, but he had a big heart, and he wasn't even worried about her doing something to him.


Ten minutes later, Emily removed the needles.

"All done!"


Emily spoke calmly.


Byron's eyes widened, and he moved his body. Though still weak, he felt much stronger than before.


He looked at Emily, his eyes welling up with tears again.


"Stop!" Emily glared at Byron. "I can't stand people crying. If you were a girl, I might feel some pity,but you're a man, and I'll just want to kick you."

Byron,who was on the verge of tears, froze. He sincerely knelt before Emily. "Ms. Johnson, from now on, you're my leader. I was blind before. Whatever you need, just say the word, and I'll do it."


"Good, learn from your mistakes. Get up. Your first task is to stop bullying the weak. Apologize to those you've wronged and make amends."


Emily. considering taking Byron as a follower, needed to set him straight.

"Yes, Ms. Johnson, I'll do it tomorrow."

"No rush. Take a few days to recover." Emily thought of something and took out a small box, tossing it to Byron.


"Consider it a gift for becoming my follower. It's for your recovery."

"Thank you, Ms. Johnson!" Byron was moved.


The scent from the box made him feel rejuvenated.

He wished he could go back and beat up his past self for provoking someone so powerful.

He carefully put the box away, then smiled obsequiously. "Ms. Johnson, since I'm your follower now, how about I take you1 somewhere fun?"


Emily raised an eyebrow. "Somewhere fun? Like where?"
###Chapter 68 Without Hesitation


"Dad, don't you think Mr. Reyes's attitude towards Emily is kinda weird? And Byron's reaction was off, too."


Bianca,sitting in the living room sipping tea, felt something was off as she replayed the scene in her mind.
She leaned in closer to Eli and spoke in a hushed tone.


Eli frowned slightly. "What are you getting at?"


He had sensed something was off, too, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.


"Dad, don't think I'm overthinking this, but Mr. Reyes didn't seem to dislike Emily as much as I thought he would. And Byron seemed kinda scared of her. Could it be that Mr. Reyes actually likes Emily? That would explain Byron's reaction..."


"Cut it out!"

Eli interrupted Bianca before she could finish. It was the first time he had scolded her so harshly."Isaac may appreciate beauty, but he's not stupid. Otherwise, how do you think the Reyes Group has gotten this far?"


"Stop saying things like this, especially since you're a girl. Discussing your elders and your sister in this manner could harm your reputation if it becomes public. Do you understand?"


As he spoke, Eli glanced around nervously, worried that Isaac, who had stepped out to take a call, might overhear.


Bianca felt a bit uncomfortable being scolded, but she wasn't entirely unreasonable. She quickly nodded obediently."Iget it. I was just worried thatEmily might be going down the wrong path, and I got carried away."


She hoped Eli was concerned about her reputation and not starting to defend Emily. Bianca lowered her eyes, hiding the cold glint in them.

Just then. Emily opened the door, followed closely by Byron.


"Byron, are you feeling better? That's great! I knew you were just troubled. We should have had Emily come over to apologize sooner. A troubled heart needs a heartfelt remedy."


Bianca thought Byron, who was usually spoiled and unreasonable, was faking his illness convincingly.She believed she had figured it out and subtly blamed Emily for not apologizing sooner.


If Byron was indeed faking it and had made himself this ill, he must resent Emily deeply.

Unfortunately,she was wrong.


Byron was furious at Bianca's insinuations, worried that Emily might misunderstand.

He scoffed, "Isn't it your fault? You always play the victim, crying and hinting that Emily bullied you. How could I confront Emily without reason? Tell me,exactly how did Emily bully you? Give me specific examples!"


Byron's mind cleared up. If Emily were as powerful as she seemed, she wouldn't need pettý tricks to make someone's life miserable.


Emily raised an eyebrow, surprised at Byron's sudden clarity.

"Really, Bianca? So you've been slandering me behind my back? Tell me, how exactly did I bully you? No wonder people dislike me wherever I go. It's all thanks to you, Bianca!"

Emily looked at Bianca with a knowing smile, as if she could see right through her.

Eli was also taken aback. Byron had no reason to lie, but he had always believed Emily bullied Bianca.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have disliked Emily so much. "Byron, I didn't. You've misunderstood. I've never said Emily bullied me. I just felt sorry for her because of her past."


Bianca's eyes reddened, tears welling up as she looked pitifully at Byron. In the past, this would have softened his heart, but now he felt nothing but irritation.


A woman should be like Emily, someone worth his attention.

Thinking back, Byron realized that those he had "bullied" had all supposedly "bullied" Bianca.

The more he thought about it, the more he felt something was off. He needed to investigate further to ensure he wasn't being played.

"Keep pretending. You think I'll fall for it again? You're not welcome here.Leave."


"Byron, you're still recovering. I don't blame you for misunderstanding me. I'll leave, but don't get upset and harm your health."

Bianca dug her nails into her palms to hide her anger. What had Emily done to make Byron change his attitude? Had she seduced him while they were alone? No wonder Emily had kicked her and Eli out.


This bitch had learned to seduce men. Bianca would have to be more cautious around her in the future.


"Dad, since Byron is better, we can leave now," Bianca urged Eli.

She then turned to Emily, "Emily, areyou staying with Byron or coming with us?"


She said this deliberately, hoping to sow doubt in Eli's mind about Emily's intentions.


Eli's eyes narrowed, scrutinizing Emily. But instead of scolding her, he smiled and said, "Isaac, it seems the kids have made up. Let Emily stay and keep Byron company. It might help him recover faster." He had been considering potential alliances, and Byron seemed like a good choice. The three percent project loss today could be recouped if Emily were to marry into the Reyes family.


Isaac, ever shrewd. saw through Eli's intentions. But he didn't dare overreach.


Byron, eager to keep Emily around, spoke up first. "Sure, Emily can stay. I'll take good care of her."

He had noticed Emily's interest in racing and wanted to impress her with his skills.


Eli interpreted this as Byron liking Emily and laughed heartily, ready to leave with Bianca.


"Wait!"


Byron called out, almost forgetting something important.


Eli turned back, puzzled.,"Byron, is there something else? If it's about Emily, she's all yours to arrange."


Emily's eyes flashed with anger. Her father was so quick to give her away. Luckily, she no longer had any expectations from him, or it would have broken her heart. 
###Chapter 69 She Wants to Stay, but I Hate It


"Mr.Johnson is so generous, why not leave Bianca here?"

Byron wasn't dumb. He caught on to Eli's intentions right away.

Feeling a wave of sympathy for Emily, he decided to speak up.

Eli's face darkened instantly. "Byron, you really know how to joke."


Bianca was about to agree. She wanted to see what Emily would do if she stayed. Was she really going to keep trying to seduce Byron?

Seeing Eli's expression and response, Bianca finally understood.

She started to feel nervous.

Byron saw through Eli and Bianca's expressions and said, "Of course, I'm joking. Even if she wanted to stay,
I wouldn't want her. Who's she trying to disgust?"

Then he got to the point. "I heard you brought a kid with you. Coincidentally, I don't have a little brother.
Why not let him stay at my place and keep me company?"

Eli frowned.

He suspected it was Emily's idea.

But seeing Emnily's changing expression, he realized it wasn't.

He had originally adopted Liam because of Emily. Now that she had apologized, he didn't have the energy to really adopt him. Byron seemed to understand his thoughts. "How about this? Give me the kid, and I'll give you a one percent share of the project. What do you think, Mr. Johnson?"

He specifically asked Isaac, who had called back, "Dad,you don't mind, right?"

Isaac didn't believe it was Byron's sudden idea. He had been bedridden and didn't know what was happening outside. It must have been Emily's idea.


"This small matter,you decide!"


Eli had no objections and had Liam stay.

Then he left with Bianca.

"Liam, come here. Leave with me and live with me from now on, okay?"


Liam had been taken to meet one stranger after another, in unfamiliar places, and wwas very scared.

When Emily called him, he immediately ran to her and nodded, "I want to stay with Emily!"

"Mr. Reyes, Byron, I'll be leaving now."


Emily finished her business and planned to leave with Liam.

Byron was reluctant. "Ms. Johnson, weren't you going to stay? I'll miss you..."


"Shut up, that's disgusting. I just didn't want to leave with those two. Don't forget you promised to take me out.Call me before the competition."


She was short on money.


She hadn't forgotten that around this time in her previous life, Aiden had been working on an,AI project. In her previous life, with her help. the project made a fortune once it launched.


In this life, without her, the progress would be slower. She needed to get the project done before then.

"Ms. Johnson, don't worry!"


Emily nodded and reminded Isaac, "Mr. Reyes, don't forget the three-seven split of those two percent."


She and Isaac had secretly agreed on the split through hand gestures in front of Eli and Bianca.


Isaac chuckled, "Don't worry, I won't forget. Those two percent are all yours."

"No,I may need the money, but I have principles. We agreed on a three-seven split."


Emily left with Liam. The area outside the Reyes Villa was empty.

Fortunately,Daniel had already left.


Byron arranged for a driver to take them back.

In the car, Emaily called Sophia to check on the adoption paperwork and confirmed it was done.


She also spoke to the orphanage director,"Director, I've taken Liam with me. I'll take good care of him and bring him back to visit the orphanage from time to time. Liam, say hello to the director."


"Hello,Director!"

Liam's voice was young and sweet.

The director, who truly loved the children, sounded choked up with emotion, genuinely happy for Liam."Good, that's good. Liam, be good at Emily's home." After returning. Emily first took Liam to her place.

Violette,Sofia, and her cousin Atticus were there so that Liam wouldn't be lonely.

Today, the sick puppies had been brought back. Biscuit and Cloudy,now healthy, were much more active.Liam liked them a lot and soon started playing with them.


Emily explained Liam's background and her adoption to Violette and the others.

"From now on, he's part of the family. Violette, treat him like a nephew. But I'll need your help with taking care of him."


Violette,knowing Emily had been briefly adopted by a scrap collector named Elijah, felt a surge of sympathy and gratitude.


"Emily, don't worry. I'll treat him like my own child." Violette looked tenderly at Liam playing outside with Biscuit.


Then she asked what Emily wanted to eat, offering to cook for her.

"No need,Violette. I need to visit Mr. Smith next door. Don't worry about dinner for me."

Emily hadn't forgotten her main task.

She wrote down the ingredients she needed for tonight and went to the neighboring villa.

"Ms. Johnson, you're here. Come in!"


York immediately opened the door and welcomed Emily.

Daniel, even when sick, had many things that required his attention.
He was lounging on the sofa in a casual T-shirt. listening to several men in suits respectfully report something to him.


Despite his relaxed posture, his powerful presence drew all eyes to him.

Daniel didn't seem to notice Emily's arrival.

He lifted his eyelids slightly, his gaze intense and commanding. "That's all for today. I want to see a new plan tomorrow!" The men visibly relaxed and quickly agreed.

They gathered their documents and left swiftly, as if chased by a beast.

Emily was surprised. Was Daniel really that intimidating?

Could he scare these executives so much, or was it that she had become bolder since her rebirth?


She shook off the thought.

"You're here."

Daniel's long lashes cast shadows over his eyes, making them look even more mysterious.


He spoke calmly, not surprised by her arrival.

"Yes,I need to check the surroundings, including your room and study. Is that okay?"

These were private and personal spaces, but they were also places where problems could be overlooked. Daniel's fingers curled slightly, but his face remained calm. "Of course."


Only York knew that Daniel disliked others entering his private spaces.

Emily might really become Daniel's future wife.


But he remembered the female doctor. Daniel had let her into his bathroom and even had a moment of intimacy,asking York to prepare clothes for her.

Daniel, who had previously avoided women, now had two female friends.

Could Daniel like both women at the same time?


If Daniel knew York's thoughts, he would have shown him how terrifying his real anger could be.

"I'll go upstairs to check."

Emily nodded. As long as there were no objections, it was fine.

Just as she entered his room to inspect, James arrived.


"Daniel, I'm here to apologize for my mother. She was deceived and didn't really intend to use the Smnith family's name for those actions!"


James bowed respectfully.


He had just returned from a business trip and learned that his mother had been caught using the Smith family's name to raise funds for a business, only for her partner to run off with the money.


Daniel sat naturally on the sofa, legs crossed. Hearing James, he lifted his eyelids slightly, his powerful presence enough to intimidate James. "Apology accepted. Don't let it happen again. You can leave now!" His light words made James freeze.


"Mr. Smith, I've checked upstairs. Everything's fine..."


Emily came down and spoke to the people below.


Her familiar voice made James look up in shock. "What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 70 He Stands Up for Her


"What does it matter to you where I am?"

Emily recognized the person approaching and couldn't help but frown.

0
What a small world!'

'Running into him here, of all places. Damn it!'


She wasn't afraid of James, but she found him incredibly annoying now.

James's first reaction was to think Emily was trying to use Daniel to pressure him into marriage.

James's face immediately turned cold. "Emily, how long are you going to keep this up? I used to let it slide because you were young and naive, but now you're comnpletely out of line. You actually went to Daniel?Apologize to him right now and come with me."


He hurried forward, trying to drag Emily down from the second floor.


Emily knew the upstairs was Daniel's private space and didn't want James to break Daniel's rules because of her.


Before James could reach her, she quickly came downstairs.

To James, this meant she still cared about him.

Otherwise, why would she care about his feelings?

He reached out to grab Emily. "Come on, let's go. This isn't a place you can just wander into." Emily slapped James's hand away in disgust and walked over to Daniel. "Mr. Smith, everything upstairs is fine. Now, I need to check your pulse. If everything's good. York can start preparing the ingredients."


She handed York a list of ingredients she had prepared.

"Alright."
0
Daniel responded calmly and extended his wrist.

His long fingers and strong wrist showed he had a lot of strength.


Emily ignored James and sat next to Daniel, her delicate hand reaching to check his pulse.

"Emily, since when do you know medicine? Stop messing around..."


James's eyes flashed with surprise,followed by worry.

He thought Emily had lost her mind.

To go this far for herself.

Who was Daniel?

A ruthless, cold-hearted man.

He never knew Emily had any real medical skills, just some basic knowledge from a doctor. If she messed up Daniel's treatment, her fate would be worse than death.


He instinctively reached out to grab Emily's hand.

"Step aside!" The next moment, Daniel's icy glare shot towards him.


A simple phrase, but it made James's face turn pale, and he didn't dare move.


The atmosphere became eerily quiet.

Emily focused on her task, her long lašhes fluttering like fans.

James had never seen Emily so dedicated to something, and he was momentarily stunned.


Actually, it wasn't that he had never seen it; his attention had shifted to Emily without him realizing it.


His intense gaze caught Daniel's atention.


"Nothing serious, just follow the doctor's orders."


After a moment.

Emily released Daniel's wrist and gave her instructions.

James snapped out of his daze and quickly said to Daniel, "Daniel, Emily only learned a bit of medicine from a country doctor. She can't really treat you. Don't let her fool you."


Emily frowned.


Before she could speak, Daniel lifted his eyes, his gaze enough to intimidate. "Are you saying I'm too stupid to know better?"


"That's not what I meant. I just don't want you to let your guard down because she's my fiancée and get tricked."


"You're not that important!" Daniel's simple words were enough to cut deep. James's expression froze.


Emily almost couldn't hold back her laughter.


But it was clear to everyone that she was pleased.

James's face, already red with embarrassment, turned even redder as Emily laughed at him.


He glared at Emily with anger.


Emily glared back, unafraid, and deliberately reminded him,"Let me remind you, ex-fiancée."


James couldn't believe Emily would mention their breakup in front of Daniel. For a moment, he panicked.


Could she really mean it?


No,she loved him too much, saw him as her only support. She couldn't really want to break up.

This had to be a tactic.


"Emily, some things, if you say them too many times, they might actually come true. Then you won't be able to take them back."


James sneered.


Emily was clearly losing patience, "Do you not understand English? We broke up. It's not a joke. Stop deluding yourself!"


"And move, I need to cook."


She didn't want to waste any more words on him. James sneered at the idea of her cooking. Did she think she could impress Daniel with that?


"Don't embarrass yourself. Daniel has had the best of everything. He doesn't need you to cook for him.Come say goodbye to Daniel, and let's go!"


James stood his ground.


Emily looked at Daniel, shrugging helplessly. "Mr. Smith, as you can see, if this continues, tonight's dinner might not happen."


"James!"


Daniel's voice was stern as he called out James's name.

James instinctively straightened up, lookcing like a scolded child.′′Daniel, I'm sorry. I just know Emily too well, so I wanted to stop her. I..."


"My guest, and you think you can interfere!" Daniel's face turned cold.

James didn't dare respond.


Daniel wasn't done. "If you keep this up, your family's business might not be yours to inherit. And who taught you to cling to an ex-fiancée? Should I call your father?"


"No... Daniel, I'm sorry!"


James's face turned pale.

Before he was brought into the Smith family, there was an adopted son.


This adopted son was quite capable. Although his father valued bloodline, he valued the business and profits more. If his father knew Daniel despised him, he might hand the power back to the adopted son.


"Then I won't keep you any longer." Daniel's dismissal was blunt.


"Yes, Daniel, take care. I'll leave now."


James acted like a scolded puppy.


But before he left, he gave Emily a deep look when Daniel wasn't watching.


Emily ignored him.

After he left, Emily thanked Daniel. "Mr. Smith, thank you for standing up for me."


Daniel replied calmly,"No need to thank me. I was just teaching him a lesson for being so rude.

Emily thought of how he had scolded James for being ill-mannered and smiled. "He really is."


York came in with the new ingredients.


Emily took them to the kitchen.


Some dishes required simmering for a while so that it would take some time.


In the kitchen, Emily worked methodically.

In the living room, Daniel relaxed on the sofa with a newspaper.


He glanced at Emily's slender figure, the light casting a glow on her.


Peaceful times. Daniel thought of the phrase.

A smile tugged at his lips, and he relaxed even more.


Meanwhile, outside the villa, James's face was a dark shade.


He got intohis car but didn't drive off immediately.


After a moment, he couldn't resist dialing a number.


On the other end, Bianca saw the familiar number and smiled smugly.


See,as long as she wanted, even James would be hers.
###Chapter 71 She is Sad, Lost the Former James


"James,are you back in Silverlight City? I've missed you these past few days!"

Bianca's voice was sweet and gentle, or at least she thought so.


James's expression softened at the sound of her voice, especially after hearing Emily's coldtone earlier.

"Yeah, I'm back. Sorry, I've been so busy lately and didn't get a chance to call you," James apologized.

Bianca's smile widened. "James, I get it. You've got a lot going on. I wouldn't hold that aganst you."

Seeing that she wasn't upset, James got to the point. "Bianca, how good is Emily at medicine?"


Bianca's smile faltered.


She had been confident that James called because he missed her, but it turned out he was asking about Emily.

Emily, that persistent shadow. Would she only disappear from James's mind if she vanished completely?

Bianca suppressed her anger and pretended to be troubled. "Emily might be better than some country doctors. James, there's something I haven't had a chance to tell you. Emily is currently assisting Floyd. Last time, Lily and I passed by and saw Floyd vouching for her as she treated Violette's low blood sugar.

"She might think her skills are good because of that, and always wants to treat people. I know Emily is smnart,but medical skills don't improve overnight. I'm worried she might harm someone, so I tried to advise her.


"But you know, Emily doesn't like me and thinks I'm jealous, so she doesn't listen to me. James, did you see Emily treating someone again?".

She painted herself as a concerned sister while making Emily seem unreasonable and stubborn. The comparison naturally made Bianca look better, especially since James had just witnessed Emily's disobedience.


"Yeah, I saw her at Daniel's house. She insisted on treating him, and Daniel believed her. It's ridiculous.She's become so arrogant and stubborn."


James couldn't help but complain.


Bianca became alert.


Every time she contacted or was with James, he mentioned Emily, even if it was ina negative context.

This meant Emily still held a place in his heart.

This was not good.


She needed everyone to ignore and forget Emily.

Bianca's eyes flashed coldly as she pretended to defend Emily. "James, don't be too upset. Maybe Mr. Smith trusted her because of Floyd. Actually, there's something I haven't told you. My dad saw Emily with some guys today, and not just one. He suspects they are influencing her negatively and has started investigating."


"I knew it! She used to listen to me, but now she's rebellious. Those shady people must be corrupting her. I'll find out who they are and deal with them!"


James said fiercely.

Bianca's voice immediately became hoarse and choked. "James, do you think I'm being a tattletale? I didn't mean to speak ill of Emily. I'm just so worried. Even if you misunderstand me, I'll still tell you."


"Bianca, you're so kind. I'm grateful you told me why Emily has changed. How could I blame you? You're just sensitive and overthink, which isn't good for your health. Don't worry, I always trust you." James comforted her patiently.

Bianca didn't completely relax.

"Okay!" Bianca responded obediently, hesitated, and then said, "James, I'm going to Emberfall City tomorrow for a medical competition. I'm nervous and worried I won't do well and help you.
0
I don't want my family to worry, so I thought of you. Could you come and support me?"

Afraid her request was too much, she quickly added, "Forget it, I shouldn't ask this of you. If Emily finds out,she'll misunderstand. I'm sorry, just pretend I didn't say anything."


James hesitated, feeling it was inappropriate.


But Bianca's understanding nature made him feel tender and soft-hearted. "If Emily gets upset over this, it's her being petty. You have every right to ask. I have some things to handle, but I'll come find you later."


Bianca's smile turned triumphant. "Okay, I'll send you my location. See you soon, James!"


"Alright!"


James agreed and hung up.

His gaze was fixed on the villa's entrance.


As time passed, he checked the time repeatedly, his brows furrowing more and more until they were almost knotted. Finally, the door opened.


Emily appeared at the entrance.

James saw she was alone. She walked along the road, and James felt a secret joy.

It seemed Daniel didn't value Emily that much. Otherwise, he would have sent a driver for her instead of letting her walk and possibly take a cab.


Unbeknownst to him. Emily lived in the neighboring villa, heading towards the gate.
0
James got out of the car and followed her.

Emily suddenly stopped.

She sensed someone following her, her brows furrowing, her hand tightening, her eyes alert and sharp.

"Emily, stop. I need to talk to you..."


James saw her quicken her pace and hurried to catch up, reaching out to grab her.

As soon as he spoke, Emily's fist flew out.


A fist mark appeared on James's eye, and he clutched the spot in pain, shouting angrily at Emily,"How dare you!"


Emily's fist had already landed when she heard James's voice, too late to pull back.

She didn't regret it.

She was surprised he had the patience to wait for her so long.


Emily felt no guilt or remorse, looking coldly at James, clutching his eye. "You were sneaking around following me. I told you we're done. We have no relationship anymore. When will you stop bothering me?"


"Emily, stop saying nonsense. How can we have no relationship? Do you forget the hard times we went
through together?"
"You forget! Those days are long gone, like that old house that burned down. Do you understand? We've changed, and there's no going back!"
Emily retorted coldly.
Her eyes reddened, not for the current James, but for the past James who had protected her.
'Love had come, but love changes.'
Time remains, but the person is no longer the same!
James saw her red eyes and felt an inexplicable panic. His anger deflated like a punctured balloon.
He hurried to explain, "No, we can go back. The house is still there. I restored it, replaced everything that burned."
Emily's eyes flashed with a strange smile.'′′SO,o,you went into that house and repaired it?"
###Chapter 72 This Trick of Hers is Really Mean


"Emily, seriously. just stop messing up, we..."

"Hello. I need to report a break-in. Someone's trespassed and wrecked my place!"
0
Emily didn't let James finish. She whipped out her phone and dialed 911.

James's face darkened at her words. "Emily, what the hell are you doing?”

That was all that he could do-nothing but words.

"Shut up!"


Annoyed by his interruption, Emily suddenly jabbed him with a silver needle, making him lose his voice temporarily.
 
After giving the dispatcher her home address and James's location, she ended the call.

James felt the sharp sting and tried to speak, but no words came out. He stared at Emily in disbelief,instinctively reaching to touch the spot where she had jabbed him, silently questioning what she had done.


Emily warned him, "That needle hit a pressure point. Don't touch it, or you might end up paralyzed. And that would be tough to fix, especially since you think I'm not skilled enough."


James didn't dare move, his eyes burning with anger, looking like they might explode.


Emily then removed the needle. "There! You made me do it. Couldn't you just stay quiet while I made the call?"


James's expression was complex, his eyes cold ashe looked at her. "I didn't expect you to use the skills you learned from Floyd on me. You're really ruthless!"


Emily shrugged helplessly. "It's not my fault. You act like you don't understand plain English!"


"I think you're losing it right now. I'm not gonna argue with you and make it worse!" James said, preparing to leave.
0
"Hold on, you heard me. I called the cops. You can't leave just yet!"


"And what if I insist on leaving?"

James's voice was cold and firm.


At that moment, the previously closed villa door opened again.

York appeared. "Ms. Johnson, is there anything I can help you with?"


It was perfectly timed-almost too perfect.


James's face turned ugly.


It was clearly intentional.


And it was Daniel's direct order.


James had overestimated himself.


With Daniel's status, the security was top-notch. He had been waiting near the door, fully aware of the situation. York had reported it to him. Daniel had instructed to keep an eye on things, wanting to see what James would do.

When Emily made the call, Daniel had watched the scene unfold on the monitor, laughing softly, "Interesting!York.go help her out."


Thus. York's timely appearance.
0
Emily's smile deepened at York's arrival. "Please keep an eye on James until the police get here."


"And this, please hand it over to the police."

Emily handed York a recording of James admitting he had entered her house.


"Emily, you're shameless!" James shouted, trembling with anger.


Emily ignored him and said to York, "Thank you."


She then walked past James without looking at him.


If it were someone else, James might have dared to force his way out.


But this was York, Daniel's trusted aide, representing Daniel's authority and reputation.


Seeing Emily's unyielding back, James felt defeated, squatting down in frustration.


York sighed softly.


He secretly gave Emily a thumbs-up, admiring her.


After returning, Emily chatted with Violette for a while.


Then she went to her room to wash up. Lying in bed after washing up. Emily noticed the marked date on her calendar, remembering she was soon to participate in the Emberfall City medical competition. She had almost forgotten about it.


Just then. her phone rang.

It was Daniel calling.


Emily sat up straight. her attitude respectful. "Mr. Smith, is there something you need?"

Could it be that his health had taken a turn?


Someone like him wouldn't call her without a reason.


"James has been taken to the police station."


Daniel's cool voice came through the phone, magnetic and alluring.


Emily immediately thanked him. "Mr. Smith, I'm sorry if I caused any trouble for,the Smith family."


She had acted out of frustration, wanting James to realize his actions were misguided.


But now she realized Daniel was also part of the Smith family, and his priority was to protect the family's interests.


Daniel's lips curled into a lazy smile. "Isn't it a bit late to ask that now? He doesn't pose a threat to the Smith family. Letting him face some consequences is necessary."


He didn't blame her; instead, he supported her actions.


Emily felt grateful.


"By the way, Mr. Smith, I'm going to Emberfall City tomorrow for a competition, so I won't be able to prepare your medicinal meals."


Emily thought it would be better to offer him more detox pills and health remedies after the competition,rather than just thanking him.


So she changed the subject.
0
Daniel's eyes darkened briefly before returning to their calm state."Alright."

"Then, Mr. Smith, have a good night. Sleep well!"

Emily was pleased he wasn't angry, and sweetly wished him goodnight.

Daniel's"goodnight" lingered in his throat but didn't come out.


But the smile on his lips was hard to suppress.

"York!"


When York entered, Daniel had already composed himself, returning to his usual indifferent demeanor.

"Mr.Smith!"


"Check what competitions are happening in Emberfall City these days," Daniel said in a deep voice.


As an assistant and bodyguard, York had some knowledge of it.


The competition was actually funded by the Smith family in order to find new medical talent for Daniel.


"There's a medical competition for new talent, funded by the Smith family. I'll check if there's anything else."

York reported truthfully.A medical competition?

That fit Emily's profile.


"Check i Emily's name is on the participant list. If not, see if she's listed in any other competitions." Daniel said,tapping his fingers on the desk.
0
York quickly opened his laptop and started searching.


York was a jack-of-all-trades. including computer skills.


He quicly checked the participant list but didn't find Emily's name. He was about to speak, "Mr. Smith,there's no..."


Before he finished, he noticed Emily's name in the judges' section..


He frowned slightly.
 
Daniel's eyes darkened. "What is it?"

"Emily's name isn't on the participant list, but there's an Emily listed as a judge. I think it's unlikely Ms.Johnson would be a judge. It's probably someone with the same name. I'll check other competitions."

York didn't know Emily was the doctor treating Daniel, so his assumption was reasonable.


Daniel's eyes held a deeper meaning. "No need to check other competitions. Since it's for me, I'll go take a look!"


York understood immediately. Daniel believed the judge was indeed Emily.


He didn't question Daniel's decision and quickly notified the competition organizers.
###Chapter 73 Using Schemes to Trick Him

"Hey!"

Bianca was anxiously waiting for James.

After what felt like forever, James finally called. She picked up in a hurry, "James, are you here yet?"

James was sitting in the police station, feeling completely at a loss for words.


After a long pause, long enough for Bianca to sense something wås wrong, she furrowed her brow and cautiously said, "James,if you're busy, don't worry about me. It's okay if you can't make it."


James felt a bit of relief. His voice was raspy as he spoke, "Sorry,I'm at the police station right now. I need you to come and get me out, and bring a lawyer. I don't want anyone else to know about this, just you and the lawyer. Can you do that,Bianca?"


Bianca was stunned. She never expected this. She had a hunch it might have something to do with Emily. But the fact that he called her and no one else showed he trusted her to some extent.


From James' voice, she could tell he was feeling defeated and vulnerable. This was a critical moment for her to step in.
Bianca's heart softened, and she quickly reassured him, "James don't worry. I won't tell anyone. I'll contact the lawyer right away and come get you."

"Thank you, Bianca. You're always so understanding," James said gratefully.

Bianca was now certain this had something to do with Emily.Otherwise, he wouldn't have compared her to Emily like that.Thinking about how James had promised to come to her but ended up dealing with something related to Emily, a flash of resentment crossed her eyes. She clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her palms, but she didn't seem to notice the pain. Her expression grew more determined, as if she had made a decision.


She quickly contacted the lawyer and headed to the police station.


An hour later, Bianca picked up James, and they got into the car to head back. Her heart felt cold. She had been so worried about James these past few days, and yet he still had the energy to deal with that old house.

James is such a fool! What was there to miss about that place?How could she not compare to Emily, who only knew how to live a hard life?

Bianca's face was gentle and considerate. "James, what Emily
did was wrong. She probably just wanted to get your attention in an extreme way. I'll talk to her later. For now, let's just let it cool down.okay?"

James leaned back in his seat, rubbing his forehead, too tired to respond.

Bianca's cool fingers gently touched his forehead. The cool sensation made James open his eyes and meet Bianca's sympathetic gaze. He was about to sit up straight.

Bianca smiled warmly. "James, I know you're feeling troubled and have a headache. Don't move, let me massage it for you."

The cool touch and gentle massage indeed eased his headache.James relaxed again, his frustration dissipating.

"If only Emily had a fraction of your gentleness, we wouldn't be in this mess," James murmured. It wasn't like the old days when they had to fight like wild animals just to survive.

Bianca's hands paused for a moment, then continued. She spoke softly, "James, don't say that in front of Emily.She has her own personality. If she hears it, she'll probably hate me even more. By the way, I figured you wouldn't want to go home tonight, so I booked a hotel suite for you to relax."

James thought Bianca was incredibly thoughtful. He didn't refuse her kindness.
Soon, they arrived at the hotel. Bianca personally got the room key and escorted him to the room. After James took a shower.Bianca knocked on his door again.

James. wrapped in a bathrobe with wet hair,opened the door.

Bianca held up a bottle of wine and gestured to the room service cart and waiter behind her. She smiled at him, "James, I thought you might need this. Can I come in?"

James' heart warmed at her smile. He couldn't help but let her in.


Bianca stayed with James, drinking. Already in a bad mood,and with Bianca encouraging him to drink, James soon got drunk.


Bianca, who looked somewhat like Emily, blurred in his vision.He grabbed her hand, accusing, "Emily, you weren't like this before. Why have you changed? Can't you learn from Bianca?You're not the same Emily who used to live on the street. Why can't you change those habits? You're embarrassing yourself and me!"


Bianca's eyes flashed. She hadn't expected James to think this way.

Tears welled up in her eyes. "James, you're hurting me."

James immediately let go. "I'm sorry, Emily. I didn't mean to."
Bianca quickly grabbed his hand again. "James. I don't blame you. Don't go!"

She leaned into his arms, her soft body pressing against him.Drunk. James felt his body heat up. Their breaths mingled.


The next morning, James was awakened by a scream. He opened his eyes to see Bianca's bare skin. He quickly turned his head and closed his eyes. "I'm sorry..."

Seeing his reaction, Bianca realized he didn't remember what had happened last night. She quickly got out of bed and dressed.


The rustling sounds helped James piece together what had happened. His face turned pale as he realized they had slept together. Memories of the night before started to surface.

James looked grim. He had mistaken Bianca for Emily. What would Emily think if she found out?

Lost in his thoughts, James didn't notice the flash of resentment in Bianca's eyes. The room was soon filled with the sound of her sobbing.

James was at a loss. "Bianca, I'm sorry. I was a jerk, drinking like that..."


"James, don't say anything. I understand. I'm sorry, I just couldn't control myself. It was my first time... I don't blame
you. I understand what you mean. Don't worry. once we leave this room. we'll pretend nothing happened. I won't let Emily know."


Bianca wiped her tears, but they kept falling. Her acting skills were so exceptional that she could have won an Oscar. The more she cried. the more guilty James felt. But he still had feelings for Emily, making him even more conflicted. He tried to comfort her. "Bianca, thank you for understanding. I'll make it up to you. I won't let anyone know. You're still a good girl."

Bianca,crying. lowered her head. She knew James didn't want to take responsibility for it. Her eyes flashed coldly. But having him in her grasp meant he would be even more under her control.


She played the victim, "James, I don't want anything. I have to go to a competition."

She grabbed her bag and ran out. But after last night's ordeal.she stumbled and almost fell.
###Chapter 74 Narcissism is a Disease, It Needs Treatment

"Bianca!" James pulled her into his arms, his voice full of concern. "What's going on?"


Bianca leaned against his chest, a calculating glint in her eyes.


"James. I'm okay. I was just really tired last night," she said, her cheeks flushing a deep red, like a sunset.

Her soft words carried a hint of ambiguity.


James's mind drifted back to the previous night's intimacy. Seeing her blushing face, he felt his throat go dry.


At his age, full of youthful vigor. Emily had always refused any premarital intimacy, making Bianca the first woman he had been with.

James's gaze deepened.

But considering Bianca's condition, he suppressed his thoughts.


Bianca could sense the change in James's body, the heat of his skin, and his heavy breathing, all of which indicated his desire.

A smile flickered in her eyes.


Having achieved her goal, she struggled to stand up, only to almost fall again. After a few attempts, she finally managed to stand, giving him a weak smile. "James, I'm sorry for worrying you again. I need to catch a flight to Emberfall City. Don't worry, I won't let this... interfere with important matters!"
She tried to walk out with determination.

Though James hadn't promised to take responsibility for her, his eyes were filled with growing affection and tenderness. He grabbed her wrist and then lifted her into his arms.


"You're too weak. I'll take you to Emberfall City!"

"But I..."


"I promised you. Don't refuse! Even if I can't give you a commitment, at least let me do something to make up for it!"


James spoke heavily.

Bianca met his determined gaze and softened, nodding. "Okay."

And so, James carried her to the car.

They returned to the Johnson Villa to grab some clothes before heading to the airport for Emberfall City.


The Johnson family had been busy these days. Eli was occupied with a company design project, Aiden was overwhelmed with AI matters,and Hayden was under the impression that he was negotiating a major project with a friend, who was currently planning a trip to Zephyria.


Finn was likely participating in some competition again.

Chase, who was supposed to be back, was busy taking Aurora to Emberfall City for medical treatment.

So,only Cleo was at home.

Cleo watched as Bianca and James returned to grab their things,looking at
them with a satisfied expression. Before Bianca left, she gave a special reminder, "James needs gentle companionship. Be understanding. unlike Emily. Men prefer gentle, girly women."


The implication was that Emily wasn't like a typical girl.

"Mom. I understand," Bianca said shyly, lowering her head.


Coincidentally, when they got off the plane, they checked into the same Azure Palace Hotel where Emily was staying.


Unexpectedly, they ran into Emily at the elevator as she was heading out to meet Aaron.


"Emily, what are you doing here?" Bianca asked in surprise.

James, who was supporting Bianca, instinctively pulled his hand back when he saw Emily.


Emily wasn't surprised to see them.

"I can be wherever I want. Is that a problem for you?"

She had noticed their intertwined hands, feeling a pang of sadness.

Had they already gotten together so soon?

Their auras were too obvious, filled with each other's presence.

And...

Emily glanced at Bianca's neck.


Bianca. perhaps intentionally, adjusted her collar to reveal the red marks on her neck more clearly.
"Emily. I didn't memn it like that. I mas just surprised. I thought yon knew we were coming to Emberfall (in and came heTe heatsc yon caTe about us, right?" Bianca shook her head. looking anxious to explain


James, who had felt quilty towards Emily, now saw her shatp words towards Bianca. and the gentle Bianca was on the verge of tears. He frowned. displeased. 'Emily. can't you speak nicely? Do vou have to taik like that? Don't pretend you don't care. You knew we were coming and followed us here. If you want me to value you. you should listen to what i have to say. I wouldn't get mad at you every time I see you.

What a narcissist!

He actually thought she came to Emberfall City for him.

Emily felt a wave of sarcasm.


Just then, she saw Aaron entering the hotel and didn't want to waste time with the self-absorbed pair.


"Narcissism is a disease. If you're sick. get treated. Don't disgust me!"

With that. she brushed past James and hurried towards Aaron.


Aaron had come because a pharmaceutical company wanted to collaborate with them. Hearing that Emily was in Emberfall City. he insisted on meeting her.


He was there to take Emily to the meeting.

"You..,"

"James, look!"

James,ignored by Emily, was naturally angry.
Bianca quickly grabbed James and pointed at Aaron, who was now greeting Emily with a relaxed smile.


James's face turned dark.


How long had it been since Emily smiled at him like that?

Now she was smiling like that at a man he didn't even know.


So. this was why she had been acting up lately. because of another man?

Without a word. Jamnes wanted to chase after them.


Bianca knew what he intended to do.

She stumbled, leaning softly into James's arms.

"Bianca..."


James's thoughts were pulled back, and he asked worriedly, "Are you feeling unwell again?"


"It's nothing. I probably didn't rest well, and the two-hour flight made me tired." Bianca said gently, shaking her head. She even offered, "James, you don't have to worry about me. If you want to chase after Emily,go ahead.She's young and might get deceived."


"If she gets deceived, it'sher own fault. She's been so disobedient lately. If something happens, let it be a lesson for her!"


James,feeling guilty about last night with Bianca, said this deliberately.


Bianca wanted to say more, but James was already firmly supporting her to go upstairs and rest.
However, even while taking care of Bianca, James's mind was elsewhere.

Bianca noticed this, her eyes turning cold.


James's brow furrowed tightly, as if he could crush a mosquito, but he couldn't just leave Bianca behind.


At that moment, his phone rang.

It was his assistant,Jace.

"Mr. Smith. Harold Rogers is in Emberfall City. He's here for a new pharmaceutical investment and will be participating in the upcoming medical competition."


Harold was the biggest investor in the pharmaceutical industry. His personal involvement demonstrated his strong commitment to this project.


James's Ascend Global Group needed such an investor for their transformation. This was an opportunity he couldn't miss.


He also wanted to prove himself to his father, Kade Smith, especially after his mother, Quiana, had made a huge mistake. He needed to outshine the adopted son, Jett Smith.


"Send me the address and his information."


After giving instructions, James found an excuse to tell Bianca, "Bianca,you rest well. I have to go out for a bit."
###Chapter 75 Misunderstanding, Beginning to Go Crazy

"Alright, James, you go ahead. I'll be fine on my own."

Bianca had to play the part of the understanding girlfriend, so she couldn't keep him from leaving.


Even though she vaguely heard something about an important person on the phone, her suspicious nature made her think that James was just using this as an excuse to meet up with Emily, staging a scene with Jace for her benefit.


"Okay, I'll be back later to keep you company!"

James nodded in satisfaction, thinking how considerate she was. If only Emily were this understanding, he wouldn't have to scold her every time they met.


With that, James left immediately.

What he didn't know was that as soon as he left, Bianca, who had been lying weakly in bed, suddenly became full of energy and quickly followed James'car.


James was driving to the address Jace had given him, unaware that Emily and Aaron were about to meet with Harold.


Harold was highly impressed with Aaron's rapid rise. In a short time,Aaron's company had expanded significantly, gaining nationwide recognition with its chain stores. The word-of-mouth about the effective medicines from Vanguard Innovations Group, under Aaron's name, was spreading fast.
However. Harold knew more than most. He knew Aaron wasn't the real boss; there was a mysterious figure behind him. To his surpríse, Aaron had admitted there was indeed a more powerful boss behind him and that this person was willing to meet Harold.


When Harold saw Emily, he was taken aback. Harold, nearly thirty, was at the peak of his charm, a blend of maturity and youth. His mixed heritage gave him particularly deep-set eyes.


Looking at Emily, he couldn't hide his admiration and surprise. "Ms.Johnson, I've heard so much about you. It's a pleasure to finally meet you."


Emily took it as mere politeness. After all, Harold had quite a reputation with women. But she was willing to work with him because, despite his reputation, he was a reliable business partner.

"Mr. Rogers, the pleasure is mine."

Emily smiled and shook his hand before they both sat down. The waitstaff.already prepared, began serving the dishes.


Once the table was set, they started discussing business over drinks.

"I've heard that Vanguard Innovations Group recently launched a new drug. I'd like to secure the exclusive distribution rights forit."


Harold got straight to the point. Of course, he had other interests as well.

Emily smiled deeply. "Mr. Rogers, I actually have another business proposition for you."


She had just developed new software. Although she wasn't worried about selling it, she thought Harold's investment would be beneficial. In the future, having good products on hand would enable more collaboration.
Plus, only an investor of Harold's caliber could potentially challenge the Johnson Group.


Harold raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

Emily glanced at Aaron, who immediately prepared the documents. Emily handed them to Harold and then demonstrated the program model on her phone.


"Although it's in the early stages, the prospects are promising. I can guarantee that within a year, the program will perform even better than it does now and will be ready for the market."


She could make such a promise because she had already developed it in her previous life. If she could have produced it out of thin air, she would have shortened the timeline even more.


Harold, with his insight and foresight, had already been eyeing this project.
Now, it was as if Emily had handed him a golden opportunity.

After watching the demonstration, he was thoroughly impressed.

"Ms. Johnson, who is this engineer? I must meet this genius!"

Harold was excited.

Emily smiled but remained silent, her pride evident. Aaron explained with a smile, "Mr. Rogers, is it possible that this genius is Ms. Johnson herself?We trust you, which is why we're telling you this."


Harold, though skeptical, didn't show it. His smile deepened, and he became even more enthusiastic towards Emily. He then asked some highly technical questions.
Emily answered fluently, even proposing more advanced ideas and using terms Harold didn't know, dispelling his doubts.


"Ms. Johnson, I thought you were impressive for developing Vanguard Innovations Group, but I underestimated you. You're a genius in every way."


Harold's praise was genuine.

The subsequent negotiations went smoothly and quickly. Harold saw Emily as a treasure, eager for more surprises from her, and was willing to make concessions. Emily, in turn, offered some new products without charging him.


Once the contracts were signed and exchanged, Harold poured a drink for Emily.


"Ms. Johnson, here's to a successful partnership."

Emily raised her glass. "To a successful partnership."

She sti1l thought of herself as her past self. This was her first time drinking as an adult in this life, so she misjudged the strength and choked on the drink, her eyes watering.


The alcohol-induced blush and her teary eyes made her look like she had been forced to drink too much. Harold, seeing her choke, patted her back to help.


This scene was exactly what James saw when he walked in.

From his perspective, it looked like Emily was being forced to drink, and Harold was taking advantage of her.
"Let go of het!"

lames moved so quickly that no one had time to react. Jace hadn't followed so that no one could stop him. He reached Harold and grabbed his collar, landing a punch.


"James, let go! What are you doing?"

Harold was knocked to the ground. Emily rushed to pull James away.

James, in his frenzy, was as strong as a bull. For the first time. Emily couldn't pull him off.


James threw another punch. "You bastard! You think you can touch my woman?"


Emily realized he had misunderstood.


"James, who said I'm your woman? If you want to act crazy, do it outside.Let go of Mr. Rogers!"


Emily's eyes flashed with anger, and a silver needle appeared in her hand.


James, feeling guilty for truly betraying Emily, was desperate to prove she was his. His impulsiveness was driven by a need to make amends.


Hearing Emily defend Harold only fueled his rage. "Emily, have you fallen so low? Your family isn't here,so I'll teach you a lesson."


He didn't care that he was hitting Harold. He raised his fist again.

"Enough!"

Emily's needle struck, numbing James' arm and stopping his punch,
He looked at her in disbelief. "I'm trying to help you,and you defend this man?"
###Chapter 76 Already Rotten

"Do I need your help? Why do you always have to be so self-centered?"

Emily was speechless. almost rolling her eyes in disbelief.

James's face darkened, his gaze fixed on Harold. "So. is it him you like. or the guy next to him, or maybe both?"


Before he could finish, a fistlanded hard on his face.

James's face swelled up instantly.

Aaron grabbed James by the collar, ready to punch him again.

"I've had enough of you. I've been wanting to punch you for a long time.How can someone like you be Emily's fiancé? I've never seen a fiancé who would accuse his fiancée of such things. You're trash!"


Aaron's anger grew, and his fist was raised high again.

James couldn't move his hands, so he couldn't fight back.

Seeing Aaron's fist about to come down again, Emily intervened.

"Aaron, don't dirty your hands on him!"

Emily stopped Aaron, not out of concern for James, but because she didn't want someone as gentle as Aaron to get his hands dirty because of James.After all, Harold was right there, and they would be working together more in the future. She didn't want to ruin Aaron's image in Harold's eyes.


Aaron looked a bit aggrieved but obediently let go of James when he met Emily's gaze.
Aaron might have misunderstood. but for someone as narcissistic as James.
it only made things worse.

"Emily, you do care about me. If that's the case, why are you doing all this? Just to get my attention?"


James seemed lost in his own world. talking to himself.

Harold.having listened to the conversation. guessed the nature of James and Emily's relationship. But James seemed blind and ungrateful.having Emily but not cherishing her. and even slandering such an outstanding woman.


"Ms. Johnson, aren't you going to introduce this gentleman? Your fiancé?"

Harold had a gossipy look on his face. Despite being punched by James.
he didn't seem to hold it against Emily. After all, he was an innocent
bystander.

Emily looked apologetically at Mr. Rogers. "Mr. Rogers, I'm sorry you had to see this. He is my fiancé, well, ex-fiancé. We've called off the engagement."


"Emily, I didn't agree to that. Who said we called off the engagement?"

James started to act shamelessly, thinking Emily was trying to appear single in front of Harold to get his attention.


Wait a minute!

James suddenly realized something. Could this Harold be the investor he was looking for?


His eyes flickered with regret. He had acted impulsively. It was all Emily's
fault. If she hadn't been so willful. he wouldn't have done this.


Unlike his previous aggressive demeanor towards Mr. Rogers. James now tried to smile as friendly as possible.


"Mr. Rogers. I apologize. I misunderstood your actions earlier, which made me act impulsively. It wasn't intentional."


James was good at shifting blame.

Harold looked at James with a half-smile. guessing that James had probably recognized his identity. He had seen many people like James.who trampled on the weak and flattered the strong, and it didn't make him any more likable.


"Is that so? I don't mind. A man can take a punch. But Ms. Johnson,such a delicate beauty, being misunderstood by her own fiancé, or rather, ex-fiancé,must be quite hurtful."


Harold's words, calling Emily a beauty, made James's suppressed anger rise again. He clenched his fists and directed his anger at Aaron.


"Emily, you claim to be innocent, but your friend here punched me out of nowhere. As a man, I know what men think. Why do you think he's so nice to you? Besides your young body, what else do you have?"


This time, it was Emily who slapped James hard.


"Do you think everyone is as vile as you? My friend and I are meeting Mr.Rogers to discuss business. How dare you judge us with your filthy mind!"


Emily had initially planned to ignore James. In her past life, she had been betrayed but didn't seek revenge out of childhood sentiment. In this life,she had stepped aside to let him be, without any intention of revenge.
But James had changed,constantly provoking her.

"Good job. Emily! You shouldn't be soft-hearted with such a bad man!"Aaron cheered,seeing Emily slap James. thinking she was finally ready to move on.


James, humiliated in front of Harold. glared at Aaron and said to Harold."Mr. Rogers, you see how they are ganging up on me. As a man,how could I not be angry seeing my fiancée like this? She only said we broke up out of spite."


Harold chuckled. "Is it appropriate to explain this to an outsider like me?By the way. Ms. Johnson, who is this gentleman?"


James frowned. unsure of Harold's intentions.


Emily sensed Harold's mischief. James's sudden change in attitude towards Harold was likely because he recognized Harold's identity and wanted to curry favor for future cooperation.


So, she deliberately said. "This gentleman is the newly found heir of Ascend Global Group."


James was dissatisfied with Emily's introduction. What did she mean by'newly found? If Harold asked more, would she tell him that he used to live in the slums? That was a past he didn't want to mention, a source of shame. Emily, who had shared those hard timnes with him, was now exposing his scars in front of others.


"Shut up!"

James couldn't control his anger anymore and shouted coldly.

He was eager to save face in front of Harold.
"Mr. Rogers, don't listen to her. She's just angry and saying these things. I'm now the manager at Ascend Global Group, overseeing the business. I hope we can work together in the future."


James smiled as he spoke.

Aaron wouldn't let Jamnes have this opportunity.


He sneered,"Mr. Rogers, don't be fooled by this bad man. Emily broke off the engagement, not just because of a quarrel. He repeatedly hurt Emily because of another woman. Who would dare to work with such a liar?"


"Aaron, do you think you're any better? Emily is foolish, helping you count money even after you sold her out!" James retorted.


"What are you talking about? When did I ever sell out Emily? Which eye of yours saw that?"


Aaron was so angry at James's words that he burst out laughing. He coldly questioned him.


"Didn't you? Look at this place. She's just turned 18, and you brought her here to drink. If that's not selling her out, what is?"

"James,you bastard!"


Emily couldn't hold back anymore. She pulled out a silver needle from James's arm and stabbed it into his pain point.


James's scream echoed through the slightly open door, reaching Bianca,who was eavesdropping outsde.
###Chapter 77 The Phone Call Came at a Very I nconvenient Time

"What's up with Mr.Smith?"


Harold hadn't noticed the silver needle in Emily's hand. Having spent most of his life abroad, he wasn't familiar with the power of acupuncture needles.


So.he thought James had suddenly gone mad.

Emily calmly put away the needle, a wicked smile playing on her lips. "Oh.nothing much, just a little mental breakdown."

James's face was contorted in pain, unable to form a coherent sentence.


Emily glanced at him coldly before turning to Harold. "Mr. Rogers, why don't we move somewhere else to continue our discussion? I have a new project that I think you'll find really interesting."

Initially, she hadn't planned to target James.

But now, she had changed her mind.


She and Bianca had been at each other's throats for a long time. With James siding with Bianca, they were destined to be enemies in this lifetime.


To weaken Bianca's support, James's inheritance rights had to be taken out of the equation.


Harold had seen the content of Emily's first two projects and was amazed.


Now,hearing her speak with such confidence, he believed she truly had something impressive.
His deep-set eyes sparkled with interest, and he responded enthusiastically.
"Of course. I'd be delighted to work more closely with Ms. Johnson."

Emily nodded.

The three of them ignored James and walked out.

Bianca, hearing the commotion, quickly ran away.

As Emily stepped out, she caught a glimpse of a pink dress disappearing around the corner.


Her eyes flashed with coldness.

James and Bianca were inseparable,always together.

Emily didn't bother chasing Bianca. The three of them left.


Bianca was panting heavily, feeling for a moment that Emily had spotted her.


Once she calmed her breathing, she frowned.

Why was she hiding? Even if Emily saw her,so what?

Bianca felt a bit annoyed. Ever since she fell into the water last time,Emily had become different, more imposing. Bianca found herself unconsciously fearing her.


But now wasn't the time to dwell on that. Bianca wanted to check on James.


She peeked into the room.

James, his face twisted in pain, finally managed to pull himself together
and turned to leave.

Bianca saw the slap mark on his face and was surprised.

But she didn't feel any pity.

She was resentful. James had claimed he had something important to do.
and this was it? Coming to see Emily?

What was it about Emily that he couldn't let go of?


She didn't show herself to James. She couldn't let him know she was following him. and she was also a bit resentful. Let him suffer a bit.

Bianca went downstairs and got into her car. When James cameout and
got into his car, she followed at a distance.

Even with a bruised face, James didn't settle down.

As soon as he got home, he called his assistant,Jace.

"Find out Emily's recent schedule and who she's been meeting."

Emily was right under his nose, yet she had managed to connect with
Aaron and Harold.

Aaron's identity must be significant; otherwise, Mr. Rogers wouldn't have
given him face.

The more he thought about it, the darker James's expression became.


It felt like something he had always controlled was slipping away, and it made him very unhappy.

Jace could sense James's displeasure even over the phone and didn't dare
question him. immediately agreeing to investigate.

After hanging up. James was still unsatisfied.

He went to the front desk and asked for Emily's room information.


Since Emily's accommodation was arranged by Daniel. the hotel didn't respond immediately. but secretly called York to report the situation.

York immediately informed Daniel.

"Mr. Smith. James wants to find out Ms. Song's room number. The hotel called to ask if they should tell him."


Daniel's eyes flashed with coldness.


"Since when does the hotel casually disclose guest information? Haven't they memorized the employee rules?"

The message was clear. York relayed Daniel's exact words to the hotel.

The hotel manager. understanding Daniel's intent. firmly responded. "Sorry.
Mr. Smith, we can't disclose guest information."

James waited for a while, only to receive this response.

He laughed angrily.


The movement pulled at his facial injury, worsening his mood. He snapped, "Fine, very well! You're the manager here, right? It seems this position isn't suitable for you."


He stormed off, leaving the staff sweating nervously. They couldn't help but look at the manager. "What now? Are you really going to get fired? If the Smith family wants youI gone, it'll be hard to find another job!"
The manager wasn't worried.

James's status was high, but it depended on who he was compared to.Compared to Daniel, it was like a commoner versus a CEO.

As long as he followed Daniel's orders, not only would he keep his job,but he might even get promoted!


Thinking this, the manager smiled, even a bit mischievously. "Send some medicine to Mr. Smith. I noticed his face was still swollen."


He was curious. James's injury appeared to be the result of a fight. Who dared to hit him? Could it be the girl named Emily?


When the medicine was delivered to James, he was still fuming and threw it out.

"Get lost! It's too late to try and please me now!"

The commotion was loud. Bianca thought it was the right time.


She couldn't really abandon James, so when the hotel staff brought the medicine, she took it and knocked on James's door.


"Before I lose my temper, leave me alone. Get lost..."


"James, it's me. Who made you so angry? Seeing your face,my heart aches!No matter how mad you are, you can't neglect your health. Can I come in and help you with the medicine?"


Bianca's voice was humble, her expression pitiful.

James knew he had just taken out his anger on her. His anger subsided a bit.
He softened his expression and let her in.

Alone in a room, applying medicine, an intimate and suggestive act.

With James needing an outlet for his anger, their gazes locked. and before they knew it, they were on the bed.


In the heat of the moment, an urgent phone call interrupted them.

Frustrated and unsatisfied, James's face darkened.

Seeing the caller ID, he still answered.


Jace was perceptive and wouldn't call without a good reason.

James answered, "This better be important."
###Chapter 78 My Prince

"It's about Ms. Johnson!"


Jace heard the raspy, menacing voice. He figured he had interrupted James at a bad time.


He wiped imaginary sweat from his forehead and braced himself.


James's face turned cold, his interest vanishing instantly. He got out of bed and went to his study to take the call.


Bianca, frustrated and unsatisfied, watched James leave without a second thought,nearly grinding her teeth in anger.

She had heard Emily's name.

Her anger towards Emily was reaching its peak.


That wretch! If she had known Emily would turn out like this, she would have taken measures to get rid of her as soon as she returned.


In the study.

James's face was stern. "Speak."


"Ms. Johnson's information seems to be encrypted. There's even a highly skilled tech expert involved. During my investigation, my computer got hacked. Luckily, they only wanted to teach me a lesson and formatted one of my files."


Jace was still a bit shaken as he spoke.


His computer contained another very important bid document with confidential data.
James naturally thought of this, his brows furrowing.

"Then hire a private investigator. Don't get involved yourself!" James was still unwilling to give up.


Jace was helpless. He had been working with James for a long time and knew Emily was James's fiancée. He also knew how James treated Emily.

Now he was suddenly concerned. Where was this concern before?

But Jace could only think this to himself. He wouldn't dare say it to James's face unless he wanted to lose his job. James was known for being petty and vengeful.


However, someone took this opportunity to curry favor with Emily.


Terry Perez: [Boss, someone was investigating you. I gave them a little warning. It was James's assistant.]


Emily: [Good job. Actually, I have something I need you to look into.]

Emily hadn't expected James to be still so persistent, even sending Jace to investigate her.


Of course, she agreed with Winter's approach. Jace was just an employee;as long as it wasn't excessive, she wouldn't bother with it.

As for Terry, he was ranked second on the dark web.


The first was naturally her. Terry had challenged her once, but after she toyed with him, he insisted on becoming her follower.


In her previous life, she was focused on the Johnson family and had no interest in followers.
In this life, she wanted to strengthen herself and needed people to help her with these tasks.


Besides, Terry seemed quite reliable.

Terry: [Boss,you finally treat me as your follower. That's great.]


This meant Emily now considered him one of her own, and he might even get a chance to meet her.


Emily: [Help me find out the auction times for Golden Saffron Essence and Celestial Ginseng, including the organizers and participant list,and obtain an invitation for me.]


In her previous life, she had heard about these herbs being auctioned but didn't know the specifics.


Terry agreed readily.

After arranging everything, Emily also asked Terry to help her with AI programming.


No one was more suitable than Terry. She was too busy and might not have the time.


Since she wanted to confront the Johnson family, she needed to tackle them one by one.


She had to develop AI technology before Aiden.


Emily finished her arrangements and received a call from her friend Wren Kelly.

Wren was Chase's wife in her previous life.
Wren told her she was participating in the medical competition.


Emily wasn't sure if Wren had participated in her previous life. She owed Wren a lot and planned to meet her to make amends by teaching her medical knowledge.


The next day.

Emily arrived at the venue and met Wren.


Wren's face was full of youthful glow, her dimples making her look both beautiful and adorable when she smiled.


When Emily mentioned teaching her medical skills. Wren was so excited she almost squealed. "That's awesome!"

"Shh!" Emily reminded her to keep it down.

Not many people knew about Emily's medical prowess, but Wren did.They had met on a mountain where Wren witnessed Emily's life-saving skills.


Wren immediately made a zipping motion with her mouth.

But their commotion caught Bianca's attention.

She glanced over and saw Emily's profile. "No way, it can't be her."

Bianca shook her head, immediately dismissing the thought.

James looked at her, puzzled. "What's up?"

Because they had been intimate again last night, he had come along today,considering her condition. Seeing her reaction, he thought she might be unwell.
Bianca wanted to shake her head. "It's nothing. I must have been mistaken."


"Emily!" James followed her gaze and saw Emily turning her head. He almost spat out her name through gritted teeth.


Bianca didn't have time to stop him as he rushed over to Emily.

He grabbed her. "How did you get in here? This place isn't for someone who only knows a few herbs from the countryside. Come with me!"


This time, he had caught her and intended to question her about her recent activities.


James was accompanied by his assistant, Milo, who had been assigned by the event organizer, considering James's status in the Smith family.


Emily suddenly grabbed and twisted his hand in return.

"Emily, Emily, let go! How can you treat James like this? He's only concerned for you. You didn't register for the competition. How did you sneak in? This won't do,let go of James and leave!"

Bianca stepped forward to help but retreated under Emily's cold gaze.resorting to verbal accusations.


Their commotion drew the attention of those around them.


Bianca felt emboldened and continued, "Emily, this place values rules. You can't break them and make things difficult for James. Also, since you don't have a spot, who helped you sneak in?"


"Emily, I didn't expect you to fall so low. Even if I have to use force, I'm taking you away. Someone, take her away!"
James waved his hand, acting with authority.

Emily's hand held a silver needle, her eyes alert.

If anyone approached, she wouldn't hesitate.

"Stop, I dare anyone to try!"

At that moment, a commanding voice rang out.

The crowd instinctively parted.


Emily looked up and met a pair of deep eyes. He was backlit,walking towards her.


It reminded her of the saying: My prince will appear to protect me just in time.


Though she could handle it herself, being defended felt nice.

But she quickly shook off those distracting thoughts.
###Chapter 79 She Can Only Be His Woman

"Who are you? This is Mr. Smith's order. And what do you think you are doing?" Milo was determined to follow his superior's instructions and protect James.

So,at this moment. he was fiercely defending James.


"Are you in cahoots with this woman? Perfect, we couldn't find her accomplice. Guards, take them both!" Milo waved his hand, and security guards immediately rushed over.

Daniel's gaze was deep as he looked at James, his smile cold and mocking.
"James, you sure have some nerve. I'm standing right here. Do you dare to arrest me?"


"Daniel, that's not what I meant!"

James wouldn't dare take on such a charge and quickly denied it.

He turned his icy gaze to Milo, all traces of gentleness gone. "Are you blind? How dare you speak to Daniel like that?"


Because James had called out Daniel's name, everyone present was shocked.


"Is this the mysterious Mr. Smith? I can't believe I'm seeing him in person."


Someone couldn't help but whisper in astonishment.

Even though Milo had never met Daniel, he had heard of his reputation.

The mysterious, ruthless, and decisive Daniel was standing right in front
of him.

And he had just reprimanded Daniel.

Thinking of this, Milo's face turned pale, and he trembled all over. "Mr.Daniel Smith, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply you were in cahoots with this lady. I was just following orders from Mr. James Smith. They say ignorance is no excuse, and I realize my mistake now. Please don't hold it against me!"


James hadn't expected Milo to pin all the blame on him,and his face darkened.


"Shut up! You're just a lowly assistant. How dare you speak to me like that? You can forget about staying here any longer."

Daniel snorted coldly. "Your arrogance is growing. When did you learn to shirk responsibility? And who gave you the authority to come here and boss people around without knowing the situation?"

He even began to inch closer to James.

James was so intimidated by his presence that he couldIn't move.

"I'm the organizer, not you!"

James's face was extremely unpleasant, almost causing him to collapse.

Bianca could see that Daniel was protecting Emily.


She mnust have used Floyd to get close to Daniel and then badmouthed James.


"Mr. Smith, you misunderstood. James came here because he was worried about me. He thought he could help with the competition, and then he
discovered someone who shouldn't be here. He was just trying to uphold the rules of the competition."


Bianca stepped forward. suppressing her fear, and explained calmly.

James gave Bianca a grateful look.

Her words gave James the confidence he needed. "Daniel. I'm not here to show off. Emily broke the rules. She didn't register but somehow managed to get here."


"Today, besides the competition, there are many patients, and there's a free clinic. If she pretends to know what she's doing and makes a mistake,it could harm someone. That's why I'm so angry."


He was good at twisting the truth, making Emily seem worthless in front of everyone.


This was the same James who had promised to protect her for the rest of her life.


James immediately pressured Emily, "Didn't you just admit you don't have a competition slot? Now, in front of Daniel, say it! And if you lie,there's surveillance."


Emily smiled and admitted, "I don't have a competition slot, but so what?"

"Daniel, you heard her. She admitted..."

"Because I'm not a contestant; I'm a judge!"


"Impossible, Emily! You're lying. Mr. Smith won't protect a liar!" Bianca's first reaction was disbelief.

James naturally wouldn't believe it either.
Ever since he got closer to Bianca, he stopped trusting Emily.

"Emily. I've ignored your lies in the past, but you should have limits. This is a serious event, and you lie so casually. You'll face social death in this circle and never practice medicine again."

People around looked at Emily with suspicion.

Some supported Bianca and sneered.

But some believed in Emily's sincerity.


Everyone whispered, especially the contestants, worried that if Emily was telling the truth. it might affect their scores.

"Short-sighted!"


Daniel spoke calmly, but his voice was icy. "Emily's medical skills are exceptional. Having her as a judge is an honor for this competition."

This was a public endorsement for Emily.

Daniel personally endorsed her.


No one present dared to question her further. They looked at Emily with admiration and respect.

A judge so young, her skills and talent must be extraordinary.


The contestants, all passionate about medicine, naturally wanted to get to know such a talented person.


At this moment, the host reminded everyone that the competition was about to start, and the participants should take their places.
Emily took out her judge's badge from her bag and put it on.

Bianca's pupils contracted.

Emily did it on purpose.

Absolutely.

"Emily, you had the judge's badge all along. Why didn't you show it? You wanted to embarrass James, didn't you? Your intentions are too malicious.How can someone like you be a judge? How can people trust you?"

Bianca clenched her fists and spoke deliberately.

James's face was also very unpleasant.

If Daniel weren't here, he would have questioned her the same way, but he had to restrain himself to avoid Daniel's displeasure.

Fortunately, Bianca stepped forward to question her.

Emily glanced mockingly at James, who didn't dare to ask her directly.

She mouthed a word silently: Coward!


Then she smiled and said, "Whether I show it or not is my choice. I'm here as a judge, not to be interrogated by you. And do you really think that if I showed my badge, you would believe me?"


Emily's smile widened. "You would probably question its authenticity,accuse me of getting a fake badge through connections."

After speaking, Emily ignored them.

She turned to Daniel and smiled, "Mr. Smith, could we talk privately?"
Daniel smiled back, "Of course!"

He made a gentlemanly gesture, and they walked side by side towards the lounge.

James stared intently at their backs.


The gentle breeze lifted Emily's long hair. making her slender figure even more elegant. Standing next to Daniel, he felt for a moment that they were a perfect match.


No!

Emily was his fiancée, his woman.

Daniel couldn't possibly be genuinely interested in Emily.

James shook off his thoughts.

"James,James..."

Beside him, Bianca called out several times, pulling him back to reality. "What,what is it?"
###Chapter 80 Ophelia

"James, Mr. Smith's just been temporarily fooled. You gotta pull yourself together and not fall for her tricks. What we need to do now is enter this competition and become Daniel's therapist. That way, I'll have a chance to show everyone Emily's true colors."

Bianca looked at James with encouragement.

She couldn't get close to Daniel, so why should Emily?

If she could make everyone despise Emily before, she could do it again and make Daniel hate her, too.


James frowned,sensing something was off.

Bianca seemed unusually hostile towards Emily today.

Was it because of him?

Or had she always been like this?

James suddenly looked at Bianca with a puzzled expression. "Bianca, do you actually have a thing for Emily?"

"James, what are you talking about? Do you think I was too harsh on her?I only said those things because of what she's been up to lately. I was just upset and worried."

Bianca's heart raced, but she tried to stay calm as she replied.

James's face remained troubled. "Sorry, I spoke too quickly. Anyway.Emily is my fiancée. Let's drop this for now and focus on the competition."

With that, he walked off in the direction Emily had gone.
Bianca watched James's retreating figure, her eyes filled with hidden anger and madness. "Emily is your fiancée, but what am 1?"

At this point. James could only be hers.

Meanwhile,Emily had followed Daniel to the lounge.

Emily spoke firmly, "Sit down, let me check you out first!"

York and Leroy Hamilton, the organizer of the medical competition,happened to witness this scene.

York had noticed Daniel's different attitude towards Emily and was slowly warming up to their interaction.

But Leroy gasped. He had just learned about the situation on his way over,and despite the short distance, he was drenched in sweat.

He hadn't expected to be so shocked upon arrival.

"Mr.Smith..."

He was contemplating whether to say something when Emily shot him a sharp look and gestured for silence.

When Emily was treating someone, her entire demeanor changed.

It felt like only she and Daniel existed in the world.

Moments later, she finished her diagnosis.

"I told you not to overwork yourself, yet you flew here despite the turbulence. You're completely ignoring medical advice. If this keeps up.no one will be able to save you."
Emily frowned, thinking about the extra time and resources she would need to spend. She decided she wouldn't take on such patients in the future.


Daniel seemed unfazed by her stern attitude and spoke calmly, "When did you tell me that?"


Emily suddenly remembered she had said it while acting as a doctor.

But she lied without hesitation, "Since I'm the recommended doctor,she naturally told me these things. Besides, with your poisoning and weakened body. you should be resting. Mr. Smith,following medical advice is the quickest way to recover."


She almost blurted out her disdain for medical advice, but stopped herself.remembering who she was talking to.

Fortunately, there was no major issue at the moment.

Daniel appeared casual, but it seemed more like he was explaining why he was there.


"This competition is hosted by the Smith Group. The best participant will have the opportunity to care for me, to prevent any poisoning incidents."

Emily nodded.


She suddenly understood why Bianca was so determined to participate in this competition.


In her previous life, it seemed that after this competition, Bianca's resources visibly improved.

Otherwise, it might not have been so easy for her to marry James later on.
"But..."

Just as Emily nodded in understanding and was about to stop reprimanding. Daniel's tone shifted.


Emily frowned and looked up, meeting Daniel's deep. vortex-like eyes that seemed to draw her in.


"With a master like Ms. Johnson, there's no need!"

Daniel's smile widened. his eyes full of admiration.

Being looked at by such eyes. even Emily's heart couldn't help but race.

She quickly looked away and stood up, "The competition is starting.I'll go take my place as a judge."

"Alright!"

Daniel didn't stop her from leaving.

But as he watched her slightly hurried steps,his smile grew.

Emily felt the gaze behind her, and her back seemed to heat up.

Her steps became flustered, and she almost bumped into James at the door.

"Emily!"

James stopped her.

Emily frowned, "What do you want to say? Isn't my attitude clear enough?
Or do you think the injury on your face doesn't hurt? Do you want me to hurt you again?"

Her gaze fell on James's face,full of threat.
James instinctively covered his face, sensing Emily's mocking look. He let go and tried to speak in a calm voice.


"Sorry, I didn't know you were a judge. You never told me, your fiancé.that you had medical skills. My questioning was out of concern for you. I underestimated you. Since you have a talent, focus on it. Stop fixating on Bianca. She's excellent and doesn't hinder you."


So he came to speak on behalf of Bianca!

He probably truly loved Bianca.


His feelings for her were just childhood memories of shared hardships.Human nature tended to prefer indulging in the present good days over remembering past struggles.


"You should tell that to Bianca. I've never tried to overshadow her. She keeps targeting me, so don't blame me for retaliating."


Emily retorted.

James frowned, finding Emily unreasonable. Despite his words, she still blamed Bianca.


"Just coexist peacefully. Today, don't target Bianca. She's prepared for this competition for a long time!"


Emily chuckled.

This was James's true intention.


"Are you afraid I'll be an unfair judge? Why beat around the bush? As long as she doesn't do anything wrong, I won't target her. She's not worth my effort!"
Emily said, pushing past James to leave.

James suddenly called out. "Emily, when we return, let's talk! I've never truly wanted to cancel our engagement!"


Emily paused but didn't turn back.

Now, it wasn't about him not wanting her; it was about her not wanting him.


She didn't need a man like him.

Emily took her seat at the judge's table, and the competition began.


Bianca glanced at Emily. meeting her smiling gaze. Her hand trembled as she picked up the herbs, a flash of panic coursing through her.

She hoped Emily wouldn't play any tricks on her.

Bianca refocused on the herbs.

Hundreds of herbs, and Bianca was initially confident.

She started quickly and accurately identifying the herbs, but as time passed,it became increasingly difficult.

However, the difficulty was high.

Bianca believedd other contestants felt the same.


After identifying all the herbs, the ranking was based on accuracy and the number of herbs identified.


The first place was a tie between two contestants.

Wren was in second place.
Bianca noticed a girl with a delicate appearance next to her, who seemed calm and in control.


This girl might be a strong competitor.

Emily also noticed the girl. named Ophelia Blake.


"Emily,how should we award extra points? Should we give the same score or what?"


Beside her was Joe Watson, one of the medical experts who had invited her to be a judge.
###Chapter 81| Can Cripple You Right Now

"Alright, let's settle this with a tiebreaker!"

Emily spoke with calm confidence, as if it were no big dea1. "We'll use a medicinal herb. Not only do you have to identify it, but you also need to explain its general effects."

This added a layer of difficulty compared to the previous challenges.

Bianca feIlt like Emily was doing this on purpose.

So, when she found out it was Emily's idea, she immediately protested, "You're targeting me! I don't accept this!"

Emily didn't even glance at Bianca but turned to Ophelia. "What about you? Any objections?"

Ophelia shook her head. "I'm good with it."

Bianca's face twisted with frustration. "Of course, she would say that to avoid offending you. I'm the only one standing up to you."

"Alright then, Ophelía gets first place, and you get second," Emily declared decisively.


Joe agreed, and the other judges had no objections.


Bianca felt humiliated. "You say you're not targeting me, but why am I second?"


Emily smirked and explained to the puzzled onlookers, "Since it's a tiebreaker, it needs to be more challenging. Otherwise, if it were still a tie,it would waste everyone's time. Besides, if you only know the names of
the herbs but not their properties, there's no point in continuing the competition. Practicing medicine isn't just about rote memorization."

Emily's reasoning was sound and logical.

Everyone present, all knowledgeable in medicine, nodded in agreement.

"That's settled then. If you have any objections, it means you lack confidence. In that case, there's no need to compete," Joe added.


Despite her reluctance, Bianca had no choice but to agree to the tiebreaker.


At first, Bianca managed to keep up, but as the difficulty increased.requiring not only knowledge of the herb's properties but also its dosage in prescriptions, she started to falter.

In the end, Bianca lost to Ophelia and took second place.

According to the rules, first place earned fifty points, and second place earned forty-five points.


Bianca glared at Emily, but she had to swallow her frustration.

Outside,Daniel, who had watched the entire process, smiled even more.


James had also been watching. He stormed into the break room, clearly angry, but held back his temper once inside.


Hesitating...

"What do you want to say?" Daniel looked up at James calmly.


Even though Daniel was sitting, his authoritative presence made James lower his head.
"Daniel, Emily's blatanit targeting of Bianca is unfair and damages her reputation."

"50?"

"I was thinking we should replace her as a judge."

Daniel's cold gaze pierced James. "I thought you were just inexperienced and clumsy, but now I see you're not just young, you're foolish! Emily's explanation was convincing to everyone. If you can't see that, maybe Jett is better suited to manage Ascend Global Group."

Daniel didn't bother hiding his thoughts.

James's face turned pale.

"Daniel, I heard Emily's explanation. But after her recent conflict with Bianca,people will question the fairness of the competition. Someone needs to oversee this, and I'm willing to take on the responsibility. If there's any more conflict. I can intervene immediately."

Daniel rubbed his forehead, silent for a moment, then said, "Fine, I'll give you one more chance to show me your fairness."

James was thrilled.

He quickly thanked Daniel and called Leroy, taking over his position as overseer.


After he left, York couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Smith, James clearly has personal motives. Why did you agree to his request?"

Daniel smirked. "Let's see if he values this opportunity."

York understood the coldness in Daniel's words and felt sorry for James.
If James acted fairly, he might still have a chance to inherit Ascend Global Group. But if he continued to target Emily. this might be his last chance.

James didn't realize the gravity of the situation.

Bianca, having lost the first round. glared at Emily with eyes full of venom.

But when she saw James approaching, she quickly changed her expression to one of grievance, her eyes welling up with tears, making her look pitiful.

James felt sorry for Bianca and gave her a comforting look.

Bianca understood and immediately smiled.

She even shot a provocative glance at Emily, as if to say, "Let's see how you can trouble me now."


Emily followed Bianca's gaze and saw James. She sighed and rubbed her forehead.


'Why won't he just leave me alone?'

"Emily, what's wrong? Want me to check on you?" Joe, who treated Emily like a treasure, asked with concern.


He seemed to forget that Emily was a skilled doctor herself.

"Nothing,just some clowns trying to bother me."

Emily said indifferently.

After all, in the face of absolute strength, everything eIse was meaningless.

The second round was about making medicine.

Bianca took first place.
Ophelia came in second.

Wren was third.

Bianca thought Emily didn't dare trouble her because James was there.

Since James could be there, it showed that Daniel. despite appearing to support Emily, ultimately gave power to James.

After the second round, there was a break.

Bianca deliberately blocked Emily's path, taunting. "Emily, do you think becoming a judge through some means can trouble me? Impossible. With James here, you can't trouble me. If you go too far, you'll lose your position as a judge. And if I spread the word, you might even lose your reputation as a doctor."

Bianca was confident.

She was good at manipulating public opinion.

Emily frowned but didn't even look at Bianca.

"Move."

Her eyes were following Ophelia.

Bianca's eyes flashed. Seeing James approaching, she said loudly,"Emily,I want to make peace with you. Do you look down on me because you're a judge? Why are you targeting me?"

Emily was clearly impatient. "Move."

She even reached out to push Bianca.
But before she could touch her. Bianca pretended to fall back, saying."Emily. even if you're targeting me. you shouldn't hurt me. I really want to compete fairly."

She acted like she was about to fall.

James's face changed. and he rushed over.


But Emily was faster. She grabbed Bianca by the collar and pulled her back,coldly threatening. "If you want to compete smoothly.behave yourself. Otherwise, I can make sure you can't use your hands. Try me if you don't believe it."


Her tone was so menacing that Bianca was genuinely scared and didn't dare move.


Emily let go of Bianca's collar and quickly walked past her, catching up with Ophelia.
###Chapter 82 Do Not Trust Her

"Bianca. are you okay? Did Emily do anything to you again?"

Bianca stumbled after being shoved by Emily.


James appeared out of nowhere. catching her just in time and asking with concern.


Bianca saw it was him, her eyes slightly red. but she bit her lip, trying to appear strong. "No. my sister didn't mean to push me. She must have had something urgent!"


James sneered. "She doesn't know anyone here. She just sweet-talked my uncle into being a judge. What urgent matter could she possibly have? Don't worry, once the competition is over, I'll make sure she goes back and stops causingtrouble."


"What?" Bianca was startled but quickly hid her thoughts. "That would be great. I was worried Emily would keep causing problems."

Half an hour later, Emily returned.

Her serious expression had softened. and she seemed relaxed.

But if you looked closely, you could see a deep intensity in her eyes.

The next round of the competition began.


It was a practical test wwhere participants had to diagnose and treat patients,with judges scoring their performance.


The competition started.

Emily was responsible for scoring Ophelia's group.
Ophelia didn't seem like a novice; she was more like an experienced doctor.quick and accurate in diagnosing patients.


Emily, adhering to principles of fairness and justice.gave Ophelia the score she deserved, even though she had doubts about her.


Just then, a commotion broke out nearby.

Initially. Emily didn't pay attention.


But she heard a familiar name, "Your name is Wren. right? A newbie like you isn't qualified to treat my friend. I demand a replacement!"


Hearing Wren's name and that familiar voice. Emily,having finished her task,stood up and walked over.


"Mr. Johnson, since you agreed to participate in this treatment, please cooperate.Besides, how do you know I can't treat your friend? Don't judge a book by its cover!"


Wren spoke calmly,trying to use a gentle tone.

She clearly knew Chase.


Chase's face tightened, staring directly at Wren. "You know me? Are you one of my fans who followed me here? That makes it even less likely I'll let you treat my friend. Someone, I want a replacement!"

Emily remembered that Wren was a fan of Chase.


Although it was a coincidence, she revealed Chase's identity. A big star like Chase would naturally think along those lines.


"Even if I were your fan, that doesn't mean I'm incompetent in my field.And for the record1. I'm not your fan anymore!"
Wren knew Chase from the screen. but seeing him in person, his unreasonable and self-important attitude disgusted her.


This made Chase even angrier.

He called for the staff. "Get me a replacement. I came here for a renowned doctor. I don't trust this person's skills. What if she messes up my friend's treatment?"


Chase lowered his voice to avoid being recognized, signaling the nearby staff.


Emily couldn't stand it anymore and stepped forward. "This is a competition. You should have known who would be treating your friend before you came. Why are you causing a scene now?"


Chase saw Emily and frowned. "Why are you here? Are you defending her? Are you two in cahoots?"


His gaze dropped to Emily's judge badge. "You, a judge? Give me a break.Doesn't the Smith Group host this event? How did they end up with judges like you? This is just a publicity stunt. I was hoping to find a skilled doctor for Aurora, but it seems like a scam!"


Chase was livid.

He had come for a top-notch doctor.

But given his status, he couldn't meet the doctor directly, so he thought this competition was his chance.


He never expected Emily to be a judge, making him suspect he was being deceived.
Seeing Aurora weakly leaning against him. he felt sorry for her and got even angrier.


"I'm outta here. You guys are too much. Don't blame me for exposing your scam later."


Emily couldn't believe how foolish Chase was. As a public figure. even if today's incident weren't recorded. people would remember and spread it online.ruining his reputation.


Moreover. Chase knew this event was hosted by the Smith Group. Was he not afraid of offending them?


Or did he think he could act recklessly because Bianca was close to James?


"Chase, your friend needs immediate acupuncture. Her condition is deteriorating." Wren noticed Aurora's state and warned.


She reached out to help Aurora sit down.


Chase thought she was exaggerating. "Get away. I said I don't trust you.Either bring a skilled doctor to treat my friend, or don't blame me for speaking out."


He warned the staff, refusing to listen to anyone.


The staff,looking worried, quickly went to find someone.

The commotion drew the attention of Bianca and James.


Bianca's eyes flashed.

She was struggling with the diagnosis of her current patient.

Hearing familiar voices, she quickly said. "James. I think I hear Chase. It
sounds like there's trouble over there."

She looked anxious. craning her neck to see what was happening.

Just then, a staff member came to report the situation to James.


James. worried that Emily might be in trouble because of Bianca,heard about the commotion and the comments made. His face darkened.and he hurried out with the staff.


Bianca quickly followed.

Seeing Chase in the middle of the crowd. Bianca couldn't help but call out."Chase!"


James also recognized Chase. frowning in displeasure.

Why was Chase here.causing trouble?

"What's going on?"

James approached, asking the staff beside him.

The staff explained the situation objectively.


James couIdn't believe Chase was so unreasonable. He recalled how Chase had repeatedly criticized Emily, wondering if Chase was the one being rude all along.


Bianca listened intently.


Seeing James's obvious displeasure, she cursed Chase inwardly. Even if he was upset, he shouldn't cause trouble at an event hosted by the Smith Group.
If he wanted a doctor,he could have asked James later.

"Chase. if you don't want Wren to treat your friend. how about I do it?"


Bianca thought her suggestion was perfect. She could avoid treating her uncertain paient and calm Chase down.

"You? Are you sure?" Chase, wanting to be cautious. began to doubt Bianca.


Bianca's expression froze.

Emily almost laughed out loud.

Wren was right; Aurora's condition was critical and could worsen at any moment.

Bianca suppressed her displeasuare. "Chase,you know my skills,right?Trust me! I can see that this lady's complexion isn't good, and her breathing is rapid. Let me treat her. Based on her symptoms, I have a good idea of what's wrong."
###Chapter 83 She Is Wrong

"Alright. let's get Aurora checked out. quick!"


Chase gently helped Aurora sit down and urged Bianca to start the diagnosis.


He noticed Emily smiling and frowned. "Seriously. what's your problem?How can you be a judge and not see she's in pain? And you're over there smiling?"


Emily's expression turned icy.

She felt wrongly accused.

This guy was really something. If she wanted to laugh, she would laugh.


Emily shot back, "What's it to you if I laugh? If you want to switch,go ahead.but you'll regret it."


"What are you implying? Are you cursing someone? What kind of judge are you? Bianca, I trust you. Go ahead and treat her!"


Chase, now provoked, lost any hesitation. He firmly instructed Bianca to proceed.


Bianca nodded.


Emily turned to James, "Since you're in charge, if we switch now,how will the scores be calculated?"


James was surprised that Emily was still concerned about the scores at this moment. He felt a bit disappointed and said, "We'll score based on the new person. Treating illnesses is random anyway!"
Emily knew Aurora's condition.

She also knew Bianca's medical skills. She wasn't in a hurry and calmly said. "Im afraid things might not go as you wish."


James thought Emily was just being contrary and didn't understand her true meaning.


Because of Chase's commotion, a lot of people gathered around to watch.


After diagnosing. Bianca gave the results and even shot a challenging look at Emily. as if to say: See, I can treat her.


Emily heard the diagnosis and couldn't help but scoff internally.

With this level of skill, she had indeed overestimated Bianca.


She had initially thought the problem would arise during treatment, but it turned out there was an issue right from the diagnosis.

She didn't say anything and just watched Bianca's treatment.


"Bianca, since you've diagnosed it, does that mean you can treat it?" Chase saw Bianca's confidence and was instantly delighted, eagerly asking.


Bianca nodded, "I'll start with acupuncture and pair it with the medicine I prescribed. It should relieve her symptoms quickly."


Bianca then took out her silver needles.

She had seen Emily use them once and thought Emily only knew a little.But she couldn't let Emily surpass her, so she had recently learned from her teacher, and now was the perfect time to use it.

Just as Bianca was about to start the acupuncture.
Aurora's body began to tremble.

Chase thought she was afraid of the long needles and comforted her."Aurora, don't be scared!"


He turned to Bianca and specifically instructed. "Bianca, Aurora is afraid of needles.be gentle."


Bianca nodded. "Chase. don't worry. Aurora will be fine soon."

As she spoke. she inserted the needles one by one.


Just as she was about to insert the third needle. Emily frowned.considering whether to speak up.


Wren spoke first. "Stop. Bianca, right? This needle is wrong,you can't continue!"


Bianca frowned, immediately displeased. She remembered this person chatting and laughing with Emily earlier, truly annoying.


She didn't immediately refute Wren but looked at James, "James, isn't this a competition? She's interfering with my treatment, whose score will this count for?"


James sternly looked at Wren and reminded him, "Do not interfere with others'treatment."


Wren met James's warning gaze and reluctantly fell silent.

Emily gave Wren a reassuring look, silently saying: You're right!

Wren felt reassured.

She instantly understood Emily's meaning.
If Bianca's needle was wrong, the patient would suffer. and they might need her help later.


Wren quieted down but kept a close eye on Emily's treatment.

As Bianca inserted the needle. Chase grew anxious. "Aurora. how do you feel?"


Aurora felt a slight improvement. "It seems a bit better..."

But as soon as she spoke. her body went from slight trembling to violent shaking. Then,she coughed up a mouthful of blood.


Chase's smile froze, his expression changing drastically. "Aurora, what's wrong?"


Aurora couldn't answer. only trembling more violently.

Chase shouted angrily at Bianca, "Bianca, what's going on? You said you could treat her! Why is she like this? Do something!"


Bianca was also frightened by the sudden turn of events, "I...I don't know!I followed my teacher's instructions; how could it be wrong?"

The onlookers were shocked.

Someone with some medical knowledge couldn't help but say, "This step of the acupuncture was wrong! That contestant just said it, that step will only worsen the condition."


He was referring to Wren.

Once one person spoke, others chimed in.

"I think not only was the step wrong, but the diagnosis was also wrong.I
observed the patient's condition, and it seems this Bianca made a mistake during the diagnosis."

As the discussions grew louder. Aurora's condition became clearer.

Bianca heard it too.

Hearing she had already been wrong since the diagnosis, her face turned very ugly. Now. thinking of a remedy, she had no idea.


Bianca could only tremble and grab James, "James. I followed my teacher's instructions, how could it be wrong? What do we do?"


Aurora's condition was clearly critical. If she failed to treat her, it would be bad enough. but if she made it worse, her reputation would be ruined, and she might face legal consequences.


Chase angrily said, "You said you were skilled and confident! Think of something! Asking James, who doesn't know medicine, is useless!"

Chase was both angry and anxious.feeling helpless.

Chase seemed to think of something and urgently looked at Wren, pulling her over, "You said Bianca was wrong, so you must know how to treat her.Hurry up!"


Wren clenched her fists but didn't move, instead looking at Emily.

Emily gave her a reassuring look.

Aurora was having an episode, but it was within her control.

So she didn't let Wren rush; otherwise, with Bianca's personality,she might twist the truth and claim her method was right, just not fully effective yet.
James saw Emily and Wren's eye contact.

He frowned and said to Wren. "This is a matter of life and death; please treat her first."


"Wait!"


Emily stopped him, "How will the scores be calculated? If Wren treats her successfully, whose score will it count for?"

Bianca's expression stiffened.

James' face darkened. "At this moment, you're still thinking about scores?Treating the patient is more important."


Emily fearlessly met his gaze, "I warned you earlier, and you didn't think about life and death then! If Wren takes over, as long as the patient follows her instructions, she can ensure the symptoms are controlled and won't worsen. But the credit will go to Wren. As for Bianca..."


She gave Bianca a deep look, "I think what she did is even worse than doing nothing!"


"Emily, even if you dislike me, you shouldn't target me so blatantly. What did I do to offend you..."


Bianca was desperate, tearfullyaccusing.

Emily made a shushing gesture, "Shut up, if you delay any longer, the patient's condition will be your fault!"
###Chapter 84 She Said She Is the Student of That Particularly Skilled Doctor?

Bianca bit her lip and stayed silent, not daring to say more.

"We'll go over the points later. As long as Wren treats her right, the points are hers!" James said through clenched teeth.


Emily nodded at Wren. "Go ahead."

James was proud, but he wasn't afraid to stand by his words in front of'everyone.


Wren stepped forward and began by pressing a few acupuncture points on Aurora.


Aurora, who had been trembling, gradually calmed down.

Chase,seeing this, was already convinced of Wren's medical skills.

When Wren started using needles, he no longer resisted.


By the time Wren finished, Aurora had stopped trembling,and her complexion visibly improved.


Chase's face lit up with joy. As Wren removed the needles, he quickly asked, "Aurora, do you feel any better? Take your time and feel it out."

He was worried about a repeat of Bianca's earlier situation.


Aurora took a moment to assess her condition and then nodded. "I feel different, more relaxed than ever before. Thank you, doctor!"

She spoke gently and looked beautiful, making it easy for people to like
her.

She also apologized on Chase's behalf to Wren. "I'm sorry. Chase was just worried and didn't mean to target you. Please don't hold it against him."


Wren had learned from her teacher and had seen various patients and their families in the hospital. Sometimes, her teacher would let her diagnose patients.


Some families dlisliked her because she was young and didn't want her to treat them.


Wren didn't mind. "It's okay, I don't mind. Take the medicine home, and it will help alleviate your condition. But I'm sorry. I can't cure you completely."


Chase's face changed. "You can't cure her completely? Then who can?Since you know what her illness is, have you seen or heard of someone who can cure her?"


Wren's gaze inastinctively turned to Emily.


But Emily didn't respond, possibly not wanting to get involved,so Wren didn't say anything.


She only said, "If you find that particularly skilled doctor, they can cure her."


"I came here for that doctor. I heard she was participating in this competition, so I brought Aurora to try our luck," Chase said,feeling frustrated.


Then he seemed to think of something and turned to James. "James, since you're the organizer, you should know, right?"
James didn't know.

But he could find out later.

Bianca quickly grabbed James's arm and whispered. "James, since that particularly skilled doctor is here, you can find out, right? I really love practising medicine and want to help you in the future. Can you help me?"


James softened at Bianca's pleading look.

Especially after Emily's aggressive behavior earlier, he couldn't let himself be embarrassed.


"Alright, what do you want me to do?"

James thought it was just agreeing to Chase's request to find the skilled doctor.


But Bianca spoke up, "Chase, I'm sorry, I was inexperienced earlier.Actually, that particularly skilled doctor is my teacher. I've only been learning for a short time, so I made a mistake. I'll ask my teacher to treat Aurora and make up for my mistake."


Chase eyed Bianca skeptically. "You really know that particularly skilled doctor?"


Wren glanced at Emily and then at Bianca, itching to expose her lie.

Emily chuckled. "So that particularly skiled doctor is your teacher, huh?
With a student like you, that doctor must be pulling their hair out!"

Wren was taken aback to learn that Bianca was Emily's sster.

But Bianca and Chase clearly had a cold attitude towards Emily, unaware of her identity.
Bianca seemed fragile but had a knack for lying.

Wren couldn't help but say. "Since Bianca is that doctor's student. it should be easy. Just ask her to bring the doctor here."

Bianca wanted to tear Wren apart for speaking out.

Chase listened to Wren. "Bianca, call your teacher and ask them to help Aurora."


Bianca's expression stiffened.

But she was quick to lie. "Those skilled doctors have strange tempers. I'II find him later and ask him to treat your friend. Wren said the condition is temporarily controlled.right?"

Chase wanted to say more.

Aurora pulled Chase's hand. "Let's listen to Bianca."

She lowered her eyes, hiding a glint.

She could tell Bianca wasn't entirely truthful.

But since Bianca agreed, she must be able to find the doctor. As long as she could be treated, it was fine.


Bianca and James had a close relationship, so it was best not to offend them.


Emily was impressed by Aurora's quick reaction.

She wasn't a fool.

No wonder Aurora had manipulated Chase into divorcing Wren in the past.
But Bianca's lie was too big this time.

The matter was resolved.

Chase took Aurora to the hotel to rest, temporarily ignoring Emily.

Bianca hurried to find the skilled doctor, dragging James along.

James asked the host and assistant to handle the aftermath and went with Bianca to contact Joe.


James understood that Bianca wanted to make people forget her mistake and gain respect as the doctor's student.


James asked the staff, but no one knew who the skilled doctor was.

Finally,he heard Joe might know, so he took Bianca to find him.

Joe was a top expert in the country.

But because of the Smith family. James was confident Joe would help.

"Are you leaving? Do you have any more of those pills you gave me last time?" Joe was humbly asking Emily for more pills.


He had used the last ones and couldn't analyze the ingredients.

Emily smiled. "I don't have any more, but I can give you the recipe."

Top recipes were priceless.

Emily's willingness to share impressed Joe. "You have talent and ethics.
Your future is bright!"

"Joe!"
At that moment. James and Bianca arrived.

They saw Joe standing with Emily, nodding kindly at her.

Bianca panicked,thinking Emily was trying to sabotage her.

She quickly said, "Emily, you may have gotten this judge position by pleasing Mr. Smith, but being a doctor requires skill and talent. Trying to please Mr. Watson won't work. He's too upright to fall for it!"
###Chapter 85 Enjoy Watching Two People Make Fools of Themselves

"Mr. Watson, I'm sorry about the scene. Emily's always been competitive with me, so her methods can be a bit... extreme. But I trust you won't be easily fooled by her," Bianca said, turning to Joe.

Joe's face remained stern. Bianca probably thought she had it all figured out,assuming Emily would soon be ostracized from the medical community.


But Joe scoffed. "Who do you think you are? Do I need you to teach me anything? And do you even know who she is? She is..."


"Mr. WVatson!" Emily quickly interrupted, stopping Joe from revealing her identity.


Instead, she looked at the two with a half-smile. "Why all the chatter? You came to see Joe just tocomplain about me?"

Bianca was taken aback. Right, she almost forgot the main reason they were here. She'd deal with Emily later. But she didn't want Emily to know théir true intentions, so she coldly said, "Emily, this isn't your concern.You should focus more on learning basic medical skills. You don't want to end up harming others and yourself due to incompetence."


After saying that, she quickly covered her mouth, pretending to regret her harsh words, "Sorry, Emily. I only said that because I'm genuinely worried about you."

She then turned to James, pulling his wrist, "James, what we're about to discuss isn't suitable for Emily to hear. It wouldn't be too much to ask her to leave,right?"
James knew the upcoming conversation wasn't for Emily's ears. to prevent her from getting any wrong ideas. So. James sternly said to Emily. "Emily.you should leave for now. I'll come find you once we're done here. and we can have a proper talk. And don't blame Bianca; she's right. If you truly want to learn medicine, you should start from the basics and not always look for shortcuts."


"This is outrageous! Who do you think you are? If anyone should leave.it's you!" Joe was furious.


Emily quickly tried to calm Joe down, "Look at you, getting all worked up at your age. If they want me to leave. I'll leave. If anyone needs me.just call."


Joe was surprised by Emily's calm demeanor this time. When Bianca and James weren't looking. Emily winked at Joe. Joe caught on to her hidden message. His expression softened, "Alright. I'll listen to you. There's no need to get angry with irrelevant people. If you want to leave, then go."

Emily nodded. She indeed had something to do, so she didn't linger.Bianca,pretending to be kind, offered to wait outside and give Emily a ride home. Emily didn't even look back, ignoring her completely.

Seeing the closeness between Emily and Joe, Bianca felt uneasy. Could it be that Emily had already won Joe over? She quickly said, "Mr. Watson,please don't misunderstand. We're not targeting Emily. She's my sister,and as her older sister, I naturally want the best for her. You might not know her well enough yet."

As Joe was about to retort angrily, Bianca quickly pulled James forward."Mr. Watson, this is James, the current head of the Smith family."

James, having returned to the Smith family, was used to being treated with
respect. Even in front of Joe, he maintained a haughty attituide. Bianca's introduction only made him more arrogant. He slightly raised his head."Mr.Watson!"


Joe could sense James's arrogance. Clearly. James underestimated Joe's status.


Someone like Joe. who remained composed even in front of someone like Daniel, had his own pride.


"If you have something to say. get to the point. I'm very busy." Joe said.his tone cold and distant.


"Mr. Watson, we need your help to introduce us to a very skilled doctor.Rest assured. if you help us, we will show our gratitude," Bianca hinted.implying a reward.

She assumed Joe, still participating as a judge in competitions,was looking to earn more money. With their clear offer, she believed he would be tempted.


Looking for Emily? Joe thought of the recently departed Emily. Bianca,being her sister, didn't even know the skilled doctor was right beside her.He finally understood Emily's earlier hint about someone looking for her.


Joe's anger and frustration turned into a meaningful smile. "You want to meet her? If you're so capable, why come to me? What makes you think I'll tell you?"


Bianca's hopeful expression froze.


James's face darkened, his already bad mood now boiling over. "Mr.Watson, I know you hold a high position in the medical field, but the Smith family doesn't necessarily need you. We came to you for a quicker
solution. If you're unwilling to cooperate. I won't ask again. But Mr.Watson,getting good medicinal herbs in the future might not be soeasy."


This was a blatant threat.


If Emily saw this, she'd be shocked. How foolish was James to speak to Joe like that? Had he been in a high position for so long that he had forgotten what respect was? He was digging his own grave. and no one could save him.


Bianca didn't see any issue with James's "assertiveness." She felt her choice was right. She even added, "Mr. Watson, if I were you. I wouldn't jeopardize my own interests for someone irrelevant. And rest assured. if you tell us and arrange a meeting with that doctor, both the Johnson Group and the Smith Group will do their best to meet your needs for any medicinal herbs."


She knew how much a good doctor valued medicinal herbs. By leveraging both the Johnson and Smith Groups. she believed Joe would be tempted.


Of course. Bianca wasn't foolish. Once she found the skilled doctor,she'd find a way to become their student, gradually elevating her status. Even Joe would have to respect her then.


Joe thought. "People like this don't deserve to practice medicine."


If they wanted to meet, fine! After all, Emily had given the go-ahead. Joe,who loved a good show, was curious to see their reaction when they realized the doctor they sought was Emily.


"If you're so insistent on meeting her, fine. I'll call her," Joe said aftera moment.


Bianca's face lit up. She knew Joe would be tempted. With money and
power, anything was possible! This only strengthened her resolve to climb higher.

"Thank you, Mr. Watson."


Joe dialed Emily's number. Emily had just met with Daniel when her phone rang. Seeing it was Joe, she knew what it was about. After apologizing to Daniel, she answered the call.

"Joe,what's up?"


Emily's voice, though slightly distorted over the phone.reached Bianca and James. But they didn't recognize it as Emily's. Perhaps, deep down.they never considered Emily could be the skilled doctor they sought. After all, they never truly respected her.
###Chapter 86 Fool

"Hey, so, there are these two people. Bianca and James, who wanna see you. They said it's important, but I didn't wanna decide for you, so f came to ask." Joe said with a grin.


Emily smirked. "Oh, them? Did they bribe you enough to get in?"

She was clearly teasing.

Bianca's face fell.

She had expected a tough doctor to be either an eccentric old man or someone distant, but she hadn't expected someone younger with a playful attitude.


Joe chuckled, "Yeah, they promised to hook me up with all the medicinal herbs I need."


Emily played along, "Not bad. Are they serious, or are they just blowing smoke?"


Joe, always up for a joke, turned to Bianca and James, "So, are you guys for real, or are you trying to pull one over on me?"


"Of course we're serious! Joe, you must be kidding. The Johnson Group and the Smith Group wouldn't lie about this!" Bianca quickly replied.
York,standing nearby.was stunned.

What was happening?

Weren't James and Bianca always giving Emily a hard time?

Why were they now seeking her out, using the names of the Johnson Group and the Smith Group?


Emily had turned things around so fast!

In such a short time,she had flipped the script.

Emily hung up the phone and noticed York staring at her curiously.


She replayed the conversation in her mind, making sure she hadn't given anything away.


"York!" Daniel's voice came from behind, sounding ominous.

York shivered.


He had been staring at Emily without blinking, and now he felt the intense hostility from behind.


York quickly shrank back.


Emily stepped forward, "Mr. Smith, I need to discuss something important with you."


"Is it about me? Ms. Johnson, you are very considerate."

Daniel's powerful aura softened, and he appeared calm and relaxed.


Emily nodded, "Yes, I just discovered that one of the contestants,named Ophelia, might be problematic. I detected a particular medicinal scent on
her that matches one of the poisons you were exposed to."

"This competition is hosted by the Smith Group, and I fear she might be targeting you. I wanted to warn you. If nothing goes wrong,she will likely win first place."


Emily shared her suspicions based on what she knew.

York, listening nearby, immediately became serious and alert.


Daniel's expression remained unreadable. "Thank you for the warning. Ms.Johnson. This is very important."


Emily waved it off nonchalantly.

Daniel, always decisive, didn't even bother to verify her claim. He immediately ordered York, "Have someone keep a close watch on Ophelia.
Don't act yet; let's see who she's working with."


His eyes flashed with a momentary burst of killing intent, which he quickly suppressed.


He turned back to Emily and said, "Ms. Johnson, you've been a great help again. It's almost dinner time. Would you do me the honor of joining me for dinner?"


His gaze was calm yet intense, focused solely on her.

Emily found herself momentarily speechless.


Fortunately, she regained her composure just in time, finding a ready excuse, "Mr. Smith, I'd love to, but as you heard, Bianca and James are looking for me. I might not have thetime."


Daniel wasn't upset by her refusal. He even pondered for a moment before
replying, "That's simple. Have them meet you at the restaurant. Since they need your help. making them wait a bit won't hurt."


Only someone of his stature could speak of Bianca and James as if they were disobedient children, showing no regard for their feelings.


Emily's eyes lit up. Of course! She had been too lenient. She should make them wait.


After finishing her conversation with Daniel, Emily nodded and prepared to leave. "Mr. Smith, I'll head to the competition venue to judge today's top three."


"Alright, I'll wait for you at the entrance when you're done," Daniel replied respectfully.


As soon as Emily left the room, Daniel's previously gentle demeanor vanished, replaced by a commanding and intimidating presence. "Keep a close watch on Ophelia and see who she interacts with," Daniel ordered coldly.


York hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Smith, the person who poisoned you is highly skilled. If Ophelia is connected to them, why not just disqualify her from the competition? Even placing her second or third would be safer.
1

If Ophelia won first place, she would work for the Smith Group,giving her access to Daniel.


Daniel's eyes were deep and cold. "If she's truly working with the poisoner.they'll have more plans if this one fails. It's better to 'grant her wish.'
With the enemy in the open and us in the shadows, we'll maintain control.
1
York understood the logic but was still concerned, "But your health is the priority. I'm worried..."


"With Emily around, there's no need to worry." Daniel's voice was low and magnetic. and when he said Emily's name, it carried a hint of tenderness.


Fortunately. Emily wasn't there to hear it, or she might have felt a shiver down her spine.


York opened his mouth but didn't dare question Daniel further. He just thought that love could make people blind. Daniel seemed to have an almost blind faith in Emily's medical skills.


Emily,unaware of York's doubts about her abilities, arrived at the competition venue and discussed with the judges to finalize the rankings.


When the host announced the results, Bianca, despite knowing the outcome, couldn't help but feel a bit resentful. So, when Emily was congratulating Wren, Bianca couldn't resist stepping forward to accuse her.


"Emily, what did you do to get all the judges to cooperate with you and give Wren second place? Why?"


Bianca also tried to sow discord between Wren and Emily. "Wren, do you really think Emily is your friend?If she were, why didn't she get you first place? Don't be fooled by her."


Wren,being smart and straightforward, immediately saw through Bianca's intentions. Before Emily could respond, Wren retorted,"What are you talking about? You say Emily can decide the rankings, but then you say she didn't give me first place. Ophelia has nothing to do with her. If she had that power, why wouldn't she give me first place? Don't you see how
ridiculous you sound?"

"Of course. it's because she didn't want to make it too obvious," Bianca grasped at a flimsy excuse.


Emily suddenly leaned in close to her, "Bianca, you're really dense. If there were any foul play,whose reputation and interests would be damaged first? Obviously, the Smith family!"
###Chapter 87 In the Name of the Smith Group Does Daniel Know?

"1 didn't say anything, I was just trying to help!" Bianca stepped back.instinctively defending herself.

Her words were weak and unconvincing.

Emily enjoyed watching Bianca's moment of panic.

If Daniel heard this...

No one knew if Daniel would get angry. After all, the rumors said he was ruthless and merciless.


Emily's phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID and quickly answered.

"The competition should be over by now, right? Is something holding you up?"


Daniel's smooth voice came through the phone.

It was easy for him to find out what was happening, so Emily wasn't surprised by his question.


She remembered he said he'd wait for her at the entrance. He might already be outside. Feeling a bit guilty, Emily replied, "Sorry,I'll be out in a minute."


After hanging up, Emily didn't spare Bianca another glance. She quickly greeted Wren and hurried out.

Bianca frowned. Who was Emily in such a rush to meet?
Could it be the man behind her success in becoming a judge this time? He must be an older man. If she could catch Emily meeting this old man.she could use it to her advantage later.


With this thought. Bianca hurriedly chased after her.

In her haste, she almost collided with James.

James rubbed his chest where he was hit and steadied Bianca, who was about to fall. "Bianca, what's wrong?"


Bianca regained her balance and quickly said, "Nothing. I just saw Emily leaving in a hurry and was worried something might be wrong. I wanted to catch up and check. James, let go of me."

She was so anxious that she didn't give James a chance to react,pushing him aside and rushing out.


But because of this delay, by the time Bianca got outside, she saw the car door closing.


She caught a glimpse of Emily's profile, the corner of a suit, and a prominent nose. but couldn't see Daniel's handsome face clearly.


Frustrated. Bianca stomped her foot, and she couldn't help but blame James in her heart.


If he hadn't stopped her, she might have caught Emily in an embarrassing situation with the old man.


"How is that possible?"

James had followed her out.

He saw the back of the departing Maybach and instinctively took a couple
of steps forward. mumbling to himself.

"What do you mean? Is there anything wrong? James, do you recognize the car owner? Could Emily really be hooking up with some old man just to make me look bad? That's so foolish!"


Bianca looked disappointed.

James shook his head. "I don't recognize it. I must have been mistaken."

He wouldn't admit that Emily had gotten into Daniel's car.


She was just a woman who picked up trash. Even if Floyd had managed to get her in front of Daniel, someone like Daniel wouldn't give her special treatment, let alone drive her away.

Bianca felt a bit regretful.


Since she couldn't catch up with Emily, she'd have to find another opportunity. She remembered another important matter.


Chase had called her again, asking if she had contacted the highly skilled doctor. Clearly, he didn't trust her lie from before.


"James, let's not worry about Emily for now. How much longer do we havre to wait for that doctor? Should we ask Mr. Watson for the address and go there early?"


Bianca felt uneasy and couldn't help but suggest.

James felt he had already lowered himself enough for this doctor, who still acted high and mighty.


Now she wanted him to wait even longer. He was unwilling, and his tone showed his frustration. "Bianca, I think you shouldn't have lied about that.
Even if you had to lie at the time. Chase is your brother. He spoils you. If you tell him the truth now. he should understand."


Bianca panicked.

James was blaming her.

She bit her lip and lowered her eyes, looking pitiful. "I'm sorry,James.I was being selfish. I just didn't want to disappoint Chase and Aurora,especially since Chase seems to really like Aurora. I'm sorry for making things difficult for you. It's my fault. I'll go tell Chase the truth. If he blames me. I can handle it."


Her voice was choked with emotion, and she looked like she was about to cry, her body swaying as if she couldn't bear the blow.


James instinctively supported her. "Sorry, I was too harsh. I'm not blaming you! You're so kind, I can't bear to let you break your promise to Chase.
Let's go contact Mr. Watson and go early."

Unfortunately.

Joe,following Emily's instructions, wouldn't let them go early.


However, he didn't give them a specific time, so they couldn't go out to eat and had to wait, ordering takeout instead.


James, used to gourmet food, was annoyed by the takeout. Finally,they got the message that the doctor would see them.


They drove to the location as soon as they got the address.

It was a café across from where Emily had just eaten.

Emily didn't want to trouble Daniel, so she suggested, "Mr. Smith, I have
someone to meet. I don't want to waste your time. Why don't you go back.and Ill take a cab later?"


Daniel didn't respond directly, asking instead. "Where are you staying?"

Emily confidently gave the name of her hotel.

Daniel nodded. "Let's go. It's on the way. I have no plans today, so I'll wait for you. and we can go back together."


Emily felt a bit embarrassed and wanted to refuse, but Daniel walked to the café across the street without waiting for her response.


His silent assertiveness left no room for refusal.

Emily had no choice but to follow.


Daniel seemed to understand her thoughts. Once upstairs, he didn't sit at the same table but had someone arrange a quiet corner for him to wait.


Emily felt that this side of Daniel was both safe and considerate.

No wonder so many women wanted to marry him.

She had just sat down when Bianca and James arrived in a hurry.

Emily saw them as soon as they entered and started looking around. Her smile grew wider.

Soon, the waiter led them to Emily's table.


Emily deliberately held the menu in front of her face, so they didn't see her at first.


"Hello. we're Bianca and James, recommended by Mr. Watson. Nice to
meet you!"

Bianca put on what she thought was a sweet and charming smile. greeting politely.


James also restrained his displeasure and spoke calmly, "Hello, I'm James from the Smith Group."


"Does Mr. Smith know you're using the Smith Group's name?" Emily slowly lowered the menu, smiling mockingly.


Bianca and James's expressions were a colorful mix of surprise and embarrassment.


They were momentarily speechless, stunned by Emily's words.
###Chapter 88 Are You an Idiot?

"How could it be you? Where's the doctor? Are you pretending to be the doctor? Emily, 1 used to think you just didn't like me, but now I see you ve learned to impersonate others. Stop messing around and tell me. where s the doctor?" Bianca snapped. her voice urgent.

James's face darkened as well. "Emily, don't push it. My patience has limits. Tell me, where did you send the doctor?"


Emily chuckled softly.′′Iit possible that I am the amazing doctor you're talking about?"


Bianca laughed as if she'd heard the funniest joke. "Emily, having dreams is good, but delusions are not. I'm not mocking you, but this is clearly impossible. Don't lie just to impress James!"

"James, even though I usually defend Emily, I think she needs a serious lesson this time. You can't just pretend to be a doctor. What if the real doctor finds out?" Bianca's righteous tone was unmistakable, though she was clearly up to no good. She always had her own twisted logic.


James's frown deepened. "Emily, do you realize what you've done? Where did you find out about this amazing doctor? Did you get this information from Mr. Watson?" Mentioning this, his frown grew tighter, finding the idea absurd. How could someone like Joe trust Emily so easily?


"Did you bribe Mr. Watson to play along with your act? I..." Bianca quickly covered her mouth, as if she had hit the nail on the head but shouldn't have said it out loud.


Emily wasn't surprised or angry at their attempts to belittle her. But Bianca had no right to drag Joe into this.
Before Emily could respond. James actually believed Bianca's insinuations.He grabbed Emily's arm, his face full of disappointment.


"Emily,how could you be so shameless? Even when you were scavenging.you never sold yourself out. Look at what you've become!" His words were harsh, as if he had already judged her guilty.

Emily rolled her eyes, exasperated. She shook off James's hand forcefully.


"Are you an idiot? If you want to verify my identity, it shouldn't be hard since you're in charge of this competition!"


"And when did you become so arrogant? Mr. Watson's reputation is not something you can tarnish. Do you think someone with his ethics and character would fake something like this?"


Bianca quickly jumped in, her tone dripping with sarcasm."Maybe Mr.Watson did it as a favor for Mr. Smith or Floyd. Emily, if you have such means. I have to admire you."


Emily almost laughed at Bianca's malicious speculation. She stood up,her presence commanding despite being shorter than James.


"So, you agree with Bianca? If so, you're an idiot. Do you really think I could get Mr. Smith, Floyd, and Mr. Watson to play along just to embarrass Bianca? You're giving yourself too much credit!" Emily's words were sharp and to the point. James knew the weight of these names.Bianca was excellent, but not enough to justify the time these people wasted.


James's thoughts wavered, and his gaze towards Emily began to change.Bianca noticed James's shift in attitude and felt a pang of worry.


Emily's presence here already confirmed her identity as the amazing doctor.
But Bianca couldn't accept it. How had Emily become such a skilled doctor right under her nose?

Even if Emily was impressive. Bianca could still sway James's opinion.

Bianca quickly changed her tone, smiling. "Emily, if what you say is true,that's wonderful. Could you treat Aurora? A doctor's duty is to save lives.You wouldn't refuse, right? Especially with your skills?"


She was trying to put Emily on amoral high ground.

Emily wasn't buying it. "Sure,I'll help. But since you're so moral, agree to my condition, and I'll treat her for free. How about that?"


Bianca didn't expect Emily to be so clever, turning the tables on her. She nearly ground her teeth in frustration.


"Emily, what are you saying? If you agree to treat Aurora, I'd even be willing to die. But I believe you're not the type to force someone,right?"


Bianca's quick response seemed to agree, but set a trap. If Emily made an unreasonable demand, she'd appear heartless.


James frowned slightly. "Emily, you can make a request, and I'll try to fulfill it. Even if it means not breaking off the engagement. Just stop targeting Bianca."


Emily couldn't help but clap sarcastically, making James's expression stiffen.


"What a devoted man, not standing up for me at all. Do you think I'd be interested in someone like that?" Emily looked at James with disdain.


Then she turned to Bianca.'′′Mycondition is simple. Admit all the bad
things you've done to frame me over the years, and I'll treat Aurora."

Bianca's eyes turned cold but quickly returned to normal. In the next second,tears welled up in her eyes.


"Emily, are you doing all this just to falsely accuse me? If you go back to being the obedient girl who listened to James, I'll admit to everything."

"Emily. those things are in the past. Bianca hasn't held them against you.Why can't you let go and stop making unreasonable demands?" James disapproved.


Emily sneered. "It's easy for you to say when you're not the one suffering.James, you never truly believed in me."

"I thought Bianca had some feelings for Chase and would help out of love.But it seems I was wrong."


Emily directly asked them to leave.

"I,I admit..."

Bianca bit her lip, looking like she was making a difficult decision,about to agree.


But before she could finish, her breathing became rapid, her face pale, and she swayed as if about to faint.


"Bianca, are you okay?"

James quickly supported Bianca, who leaned into his arms,pretending to faint.


Emily watched, unimpressed, as Bianca's eyes moved under her closed lids.
"Faking illness now? How convenient."


"Enough. Emily. How can you be so heartless? We don't need to beg you!"James scolded Emily,then hurriedly carried Bianca out.
###Chapter 89 Find Someone to Impersonate E mily

"All set?"

Daniel walked over as the crowd thinned out, his voice deep but gentle.

Emily wasn't surprised by the outcome. Watching James leave without a second thought, carrying Bianca, left her feeling a bit down.


When she looked up and saw Daniel's concerned, deep-set eyes, she suddenly felt at ease.


She smiled lightly, "Yeah, it's all taken care of. Thanks for your patience.Mr. Smith. Let's head back."


Daniel didn't push Emily for details. Since she had handled it. he wouldn't pry.


Emily thought Daniel wasn't as cold and ruthless as the rumors suggested.He wasn't overly domineering either.


Just as she had told James, if he wanted to find out who the highly skilled doctor was, he could. As the organizer of the competition, James had the means.


So naturally, Daniel could find out even more easily.

Emily hadn't gone out of her way to hide her identity.

But even so, Daniel hadn't investigated her, which she appreciated.

Back home, Emily began working on her designs for the upcoming competition.
The preliminary round was fast approaching.

Emily furrowed her brows, contemplating what to draw.

Inspiration struck her mind like lightning, and she quickly captured it. her hand moving as if guided by a higher power.


Soon. a stunning design appeared on the paper.

As Emily finished and was about to set down her pen, she thought of her past life.


Back then, she liked to quickly jot down her ideas in a notebook.

When she moved out of the Johnson Villa in a hurry,she had left that notebook in her studio.


She had heard that Bianca was also participating in this design competition. Given Bianca's skill level, she had no chance of winning.

So the only way...

Emily's eyes darkened as she guessed what Bianca might do.

'If that's the case!

Emily's lips curled into a mysterious smile. She picked up her pen again,grabbed a new sheet of paper, and recalled the unused ideas from her notebook.


Soon,two more design sketches emerged.

Emily looked at the new designs, her expression complex.

There was satisfaction, but also regret.
In the end, it all turned into a confident glow.

She set down her pen, opened her long-unused email, and uploaded the photos of the two sketches to a familiar yet distant email address.

Just as she was about to get up and rest.

an email reply came in quickly, as if thesender had been eagerly waiting for her contact.


[L: Q. I thought I'd never see your work again in this lifetime. It's amazing to receive your designs. With your talent, how could you just retire like that?]


[L: Q. does sending these designs mean you're making a comeback?]

Emily hadn't expected L to be so enthusiastic after all this time.

L was a truly pure artist, even more so than Emily herself. Despite her talent, Emily had always respected L.


After some thought, Emily decided to reply immediately. Otherwise, L probably wouldn't sleep well tonight.


[Q: Yes, I've decided to return. But I have some conditions.]

[L: Name them.]


[Q: I want you to release new products based on these designs as soon as possible and announce my comeback widely.]


Lon Ramos felt a surge of anxiety at Emily's request.

Could Emily be in some kind of trouble? Is that why she's in such a hurry?
Having long awaited Emily's return, Lon was determined to help her.ensuring more excellent works would follow.

If Emily wanted to make a grand return, he would amplify it.

[L: Q, don't worry. I'll handle it. I'll make sure the whole world knows you re back. This will be a celebration in our industry.]


Emily thanked Lon.

She stood by the window, her gaze drifting into the distance.

Bianca,get ready for what's coming.

At that moment, Bianca was lying in a hospital bed, insisting on being discharged. but a sudden unease gripped her.

It felt like something bad was about to happen.

"Bianca, you should let the doctors check you thoroughly. You've been fainting too often lately. Don't take your health lightly. Please, listen to me."James pleaded gently, as if afraid of startling the frai1 Bianca.


Bianca shook her head, "James, but Chase is waiting. It's my body's fault for being so weak. I shouldn't have hesitated for my pitiful pride. For Chase's happiness, I would even beg Emily on my knees."


She continued. "We don't even know who that amazing doctor is. If the public doesn't know, how could they suspect Emily in the first place?"


James, struck by her words, suddenly had an idea.

He gripped Bianca's shoulders tightly, "Bianca, you're right. If no one knows who that amazing doctor is, it doesn't have to be Emily. If that new contestant could help Chase's friend, there must be an even better doctor
out there."

"So, don't worry. We can find a great doctor, ask them to take you as a student, and then you can treat Chase's friend yourself. If you succeed, the credit will be yours and your mentor's. What do you think?"


This was exactly what Bianca had intended.

But to maintain her image of kindness and purity, she pretended to disagree, shaking her head.


"James, I'm touched that you'd do this for me. Emily has a fiancé like you,yet she doesn't appreciate it. But this doesn't seem right. What if Emily finds out and causes trouble? I don't want to drag you into this."

Bianca's words pulled James's heart back to her.

He gently patted her head, comforting her.

When he mentioned Emily, his expression darkened. "Words alone aren't enough. Even if Emily claims to be that amazing doctor, no one will believe her just because she says so. Don't forget her reputation."

"And with me here, no one will question this. As for Emily, I want her to realize that without me, she's nothing. When she sees the truth, she'll come back and apologize,begging to reconcile."


Bianca's nails dug into her palms.

Her eyes flashed coldly.

Emily...Even now, James still thought about getting back with her.

What did Emily have that she didn't?
But when she looked at James again, she hid all her darkness, her eyes welling up with emotion, "James, you're the best. I'll listen to you."

Soon,James found the perfect mentor for Bianca.


Chase quickly heard the news that Bianca had learned how to treat Aurora's illness.


Unable to keep it to himself, Chase called Emily to boast. "Emily, that
amazing doctor is Bianca's mentor. Bianca has learned how to treat Aurora.Unlike you,who are ungrateful. The Johnson family raised you for so many years, and you haven't done anything for them. Don't ever say you'
re my sister again."
###Chapter 90 Kept as a Mistress and Became the Third Party

"Who are you talking about?"

Emily was puzzled. She didn't recall ever taking Bianca as a student. If Chase wasn't lying, then Bianca must be. Given how much Chase valued Aurora, it was unlikely he'd lie about something like this.


So, Bianca must be the one lying. And James was probably in on it, too.

Emily wanted to know who dared to impersonate her.

"What? Jealous? Trying to steal Bianca's teacher? Don't even think about it.I'm not stupid enough to tell you who it is. I'm here to warn you-stop hurting Bianca, or don't blame me for ignoring our family ties."


Chase spoke coldly.

Emily snapped, "Idiot! You're the only one who believes Bianca. Just wait and see. Don't come begging me when you regret it!"


She understood now. Bianca must have found someone to impersonate her,and Chase believed it without question.


Aurora's illness wasn't that hard to treat. There were plenty of skilled people out there who could cure her, but Aurora was also poisoned. Only Emily could cure that.


She hung up the phone without another word, waiting for Chase to regret his actions.


Bianca probably didn't expect Chase to be so foolish. Upon hearing that someone could help Aurora, he couldn't wait to show off to Emily.
Chase didn't expect Emily to be so dismissive. She dared to hang up on him and even curse Aurora. He was so angry that he almost smashed his phone.

Emily hung up, smirking. Chase still had time to worry about Aurora,but if she remembered correctly, around this time in her previous life, rumors about him would start spreading online.


She didn't need to do anything herself. If she ignored it. Chase would be ruined.


She didn't care about her reputation, but if someone were using her name,she wouldn't stand by.


Chase didn't need to say anything. Aurora would know who Bianca's teacher was.


Emily quickly found Aurora's private number through her computer and called her.


"Hello,who is this?"


Aurora's voice was sweet and gentle; no wonder Chase liked her for so long.


Emily had no grudge against Aurora in this life. As long as Aurora didn't target her, she wouldn't target Aurora.


So, she spoke kindly, "Ms. Rivera, I heard you found a highly skilled doctor. Could you tell me who it is?"


Aurora frowned. She had just learned about the doctor herself. How did this person know?
If they knew. why ask her?

"Who are you? Who told you this?"

"Ms. Rivera, who do you think told me? And since I know your private number, do you think it's a coincidence I know this?"


Emily's ambiguous words confused Aurora. She thought carefully.

Could it be one of Chase's friends?

"Are you one of Chase's friends? If so. why not ask him directly instead of me?"


Aurora was cautious, not revealing anything immediately.

Emily lowered her voice and mentioned a place and a name.

"Ms. Rivera, I don't mean you any harm. I just want to know the doctor's name or see a photo. If you don't tell me. I might not be so kind."


Emily used her past life's kcnowledge, mentioning a man who had kept Aurora and the house he bought her.


Aurora was scared. She had a single persona online, and the man who kept her was married. If this got out, her career would be destroyed.


Aurora's face turned pale at the mention of the place and name. Her weak body almost fainted.


She dug her nails into her skin to stay conscious.

"I heard the doctor is Brad Thornton. Bianca and Mr. Smith found him.Why do you want to know?"
Aurora couldn't refuse, but she was puzzled that someone who could uncover her secrets couldn't find this.


Emily spoke calmly. "That's not your concern. But if I were you, I'd rely less on men and more on friends. Find another reliable doctor."


"Thank you, I understand. I told you Brad's name. You won't tell anyone what you said,right?"


Aurora didn't trust Bianca but trusted James, so she didn't mind Emily's words, focusing on her reputation.

"I'm not interested in your private life. Don't worry, I won't say anything."

Emily hung up and quickly searched for "Brad." If he was posing as a skilled doctor, he must have some medical skills, or he'd be exposed.


With James involved, using the Smith family name. Brad would likely cooperate.


Following this lead, Emily soon found Brad's identity. He had a connection to Floyd, being his classmate, but was expelled for certain reasons.


Floyd came to SilverLight City partly because of Brad. Emily decided to settle old scores for Floyd.


No wonder Brad was easily persuaded by Bianca and James. People are driven by profit.

Emily packaged the information and sent it to Aaron.

She called Aaron, "I sent you some information. Find someone to watch him. Let me know who he's treating, and I'll meet him personally."
Aaron quickly checked the email.

"What happened. Emily? Did he offend you,or are you helping Floyd?"

Emily was kind-hearted, but she'd consult Floyd before helping with his private matters.

"He offended me."


Emily briefly explained how Bianca and James found someone to impersonate her.


"Someone dared to impersonate you? Brad must be bold or stupid. Don't worry,I'll make sure he stops."

Aaron assured her.
###Chapter 91 Emily Definitely Appeared for You

"Hey. if we find anything. I'll let you know. How are you planning to handle him and the others?" Aaron asked, genuinely curious about Emily's approach.


From the moment Aaron met Emily, he knew she was not someone to mess with. She was fierce. like a wolf with sharp fangs.


"It depends on how much he's gained from this. I'll make him pay back double. As for the people behind him. I'll just call the cops," Emily replied.her eyes cold and her demeanor deadly serious.


If York saw this, he'd probably be shocked. Emily's aura was strikingly similar to Daniel's.


Aaron was pleased to see Emily no longer enduring humiliation and showing her true strength. "Don't worry, leave it to me," he assured her.Then he mentioned Harold, "Mr. Rogers has called several times since he left, wanting to invite you to dinner and discuss newprojects."

Hárold must have consulted with some knowledgeable engineers and become even more impressed and curious about Emily, hence the persistent calls.

"There will be opportunities if this collaboration goes well," Emily said.Her impression of Harold was influenced by memories from her past life,so she didn't rush into multiple projects at once. A period of adjustment was necessary.

"Got it," Aaron said, hanging up the phone.
Emily noticed two missed calls from an unfamiliar number. She wasn't planning to respond until a message came through.

Byron: |Ms. Johnson, I mentioned taking you to see a race. There's one tomorrow. Would you honor me with your presence?]


Byron's message was humble, showing he was genuinely scared last time.Fear had made him humble.


Emily didn't play hard to get. She wanted to see the race and, having taken Byron under her wing, she needed to act like a leader.


Emily:[Time and place?]

Byron, having called twice while she was on the phone, wondered if Emily had blocked his number. Despite not giving her his number,he feared she had the means to get it. Nervously, he sent the message and waited anxiously.


When he saw her reply, he was overjoyed. His followers would have thought he was crazy if they saw his reaction.


Byron: [Tomorrow at 10 AM. I can't let you go alone. May I pick you up at 9:30?]


Byron's eagerness to please was evident. Emily was satisfied.

Emily:[Okay!]

Ending the conversation, Emily felt a rush of excitement. It had been three years since her last race. In her past life,she raced to raise money for her family, but later, helping the Johnson family left her no time for racing.


In this life, she had only participated in one major race, gaining fame
before disappearing. Her legend still lingered.

Emily decided to see how things went tomorrow. If the opportunity arose.she might race again. She logged into her long-dormant Twitter account and posted: #QS: Rising from the ashes, the king returns!#

Bold and confident, Emily felt great after posting. Ignoring the Johnson family's opinions, she could live freely.


Her followers quickly noticed the post, including Charles.

"Am I seeing things? It's real!" Charles had witnessed Emily's legendary race.He admired two racers: Daniel and QS. Daniel had retired after one legendary race, but Charles had shared Emily's race with him, sparking Daniel's curiosity.


"Daniel, there's a race tomorrow. QS might be competing. I have to go.I know you're not interested, so I'll head out. Need to be well-rested for tomorrow," Charles said excitedly, not noticing Daniel's gaze.

As Charles reached the door. Daniel spoke, "Pick me up tomorrow."

Charles stopped, stunned. "Daniel, are you okay? Did a monster possess you?" He couldn't believe Daniel, who had retired, wanted to watch a race.


Charles didn't know Daniel had retired partly because he was done and partly because the Smith family needed him. Daniel's calm but powerful words left no room for argument.


"Fine, I'll pick you up. But why the sudden interest? Do you like QS too?"Charles asked, sensing a warning in Daniel's tone.

Emily, unaware of Charles' theatrics, had no plans to race tomorrow. She intended to wait for a major international event. But fate had other plans.
The next day. at 10 AM. Byron drove her to the race, where she unexpectedly ran into Bianca.


"Emily, what are you doing here?" Bianca, noticing James' recent coldness.had followed him to the race. Seeing Emily, she assumed it was another ploy to get close to James.


"James, isn't it a coincidence to see Emily here? She doesn't even know about racing." Bianca said, trying to steer the conversation.
###Chapter 92 Doing So Much Just to Get You Attention

"Emily. I didn't expect you to follow me here. Have you finally realized your mistake?"


James nodded in agreement with Bianca, thinking Emily had come to the racetrack just for him. After all. Emily had never been to such a place before. so how could she have found it otherwise?


Emily acted like she hadn't heard their conversation and said directly,"Excuse me, you're blocking the way. Can you move?"


She spoke and then tried to walk past them toward the distance.

"Emily,James was only upset with you because of your past behavior. He's still your fiancé. Since you've come all this way, just apologize and make up with him," Bianca lectured.


James raised an eyebrow, looking down at Emily with a smug expression.waiting for her to apologize.


"Who said I came here for him? Can you stop being so full of yourselves?"Emily rolled her eyes at them and continued walking.


James's face darkened. He instinctively reached out to grab Emily. "Emily,since you followed me here, why are you still pretending? This time,I'll be generous and won't call off the engagement, considering our past. Just stay by my side, and we'll talk after the race."


Emily sidestepped to avoid James's hand, but someone else was quicker-a hand slapped James's away.
"What are you doing? Get your dirty hands off her! Ms. Johnson isn't someone you can touch so casually." Byron, who had been chatting with some racing buddies and was delayed, arrived just in time to see the scene.Without even looking at James's face, he defended Emily and slapped James's hand away.


Byron quickly approached and checked on Emily. "Ms. Johnson, are you okay? Don't worry. I'll handle this."


He then turned to James, ready to unleash his anger, but when he saw James's face, he paused and then smiled lazily. "Well, if it isn't Mr. Smith.Didn't you see that Ms. Johnson doesn't want to talk to you? Why are you still pushing it? You need to respect women, you know? Besides..."


He deliberately glanced at Bianca with a suggestive smile. "You already have another lady friend, don't you? Just focus on her."


Byron couldn't understand why he had once thought Bianca was great.Emily had been right; he must have been blind. Bianca's pretentiousness was now clear to him, and he found Emily's straightforwardness and boldness much more appealing.


Bianca sensed Byron's disdain and was furious. She almost ground her molars to dust. Byron had once been her admirer, but because of Emily,his attitude had changed drastically. She couldn't understand what Emily had done or said to him.


"Byron, what a coincidence you're here too. Don't misunderstand; it's not James trying to trouble Emily. Emily came here specifically for James,but she's shy and embarrassed, which is why you saw what you did," Bianca explained,tilting her head to show her best side and speaking in what she thought was a gentle and reasonable tone.
"Nonsense!" Byron spoat, clearly disgusted by her words. "Who said Ms.Johnson came for Mr. Smith? I personally invited her here. You must be mistaken. I have a race soon, and I want Ms. Johnson to see me in action.so I won't waste time talking to you."


Byron turned to Emily, his expression softening instantly. "Ms. Johnson.sorry for being late. Let's go. I'll show you my car first, and then you can ride shotgun and experience it before the race."

Emily was increasingly pleased with Byron's attitude. She nodded, "Sure!"

"Emily!" James couldn't believe Emily was really leaving. She wasn't here for him? He couldn't accept it, especially seeing her with Byron, whom he considered a lowlife. Emily must have been led astray by such people.


"Are you really going to stick wwith these shady characters? This is my last warning. If you don't come to your senses, I'll publicly call off the engagement. No one will treat you well because you're my fiancée anymore!"


Emily was infuriated by his words and stopped in her tracks. Bianca's eyes narrowed. hoping Emily would leave so she could become James's wife.


James sneered inwardly. Emily must be reluctant to give up her status as his fiancée.


Emily laughed coldly. "Treated well as your fiancée? You mean being pushed into the water, locked in the bathroom, or thrown down the stairs?I can't take any more of that 'kindness.' Go ahead and announce the breakup!"

"What? Ms. Johnson, you've been through that? That's outrageous! Who
dared to bully you? Tell me, and I'll make sure they pay!" Byron was puzzled. Emily was so strong; how could she tolerate such treatment? It must be the power of love. James, as her fiancé, hadn't protected her.so it was his fault.

Byron glared at James. "Mr. Smith, if you can't protect your woman,you should let her go. From now on. Ms. Johnson has nothing to do with you.I'll take care of her!"


Byron then escorted Emily away.

James was left stunned by Emily's words. Had she really suffered so much without him knowing? Why hadn't she ever told him? All he had heard was that Emily was jealous of Bianca and constantly schemed against her.Bianca had always pitied Emily and indulged her.


"Bianca, is what Emily said true?" James asked urgently, his brow furrowed.


Bianca was startled by his sudden anger. Her heart sank, but she forced tears and said helplessly, "James, I don't know! Emily never told me. She's not one to be weak or tolerant. Maybe she said that to make you feel sorry for her?"


James frowned, but he was still somewhat swayed.

Bianca continued, "If Emily lied to make you feel sorry, it means she still cares about you, right? That's good. It means you can reconcile with her.No matter what she does, it's because she loves you. Just coax her, and she'Il become obedient again."


James frowned, contemplating Bianca's words.

At that moment, the broadcast announced the start of the first race, calling
the participants to their positions.
###Chapter 93 James Replaces Him in the Conpetition

"Ms. Johnson, please!"


With a bit of time left for the contestants to prepare. Byron quickly gestured for Emily to join him in the car.


Emily's eyes were locked on Byron's driver's seat, her gaze intense. "Get out."


"What?"

Byron was momentarily confused. "What?"

He had a bewildered look on his face.


One of the sidekicks chimed in. "Mr. Reyes, I think Ms. Johnson wants to sit in the driver's seat, maybe she wants to feel your steering wheel!"


Colt tentatively suggested.

Emily gave Colt an approving glance. "That's right!"


Encouraged by Emily's look, Colt eagerly moved forward to pull the stunned Byron out of the car.


Byron shot Colt a glare but obediently got out of the car.


"Ms. Johnson, you can touch it, but don't mess around. If you're interested in learning, I can find a chance to teach you. If you want to feel the thrill of speed,you can sit in the passenger seat and still experience it."

Byron explained as he helped Emily into the car.
As soon as Emily touched the steering wheel. her whole demtano changed. Her eyes became sharp, and every move she made on the wheel was filled with excitement, as if her fighting spirit was boiling over.

"Byron, this time, I'm definitely going to beat you."

At that moment, Finn walked over with a few of his followers.


It was clear that the first race was a showdown between Finn and Byron.


Seeing Byron standing by the car, seemingly dawdling, Finn couldn't help.but mock him.


He glanced disdainfully at the person in the driver's seat and sneered,"Bringing a woman to the race? How do you expectto win... Emily, is that you?"


Finn was taken aback when he recognized Emily in the car.

He hadn't been involved in family matters recently because he had just returned from a few races abroad. He hadn't expected the usually obedient Emily to show up at such an event.


"How did you get mixed up with Byron?" Finn was unaware of the trouble Byron had faced at Emily's hands.


Of course, in his eyes, Byron was nothing special.


Byron frowned. "Hey, Finn, what do you mean by that? Am I that bad?Watch your words. If you make my leader dislike me, don't blame me for getting angry!"


"Leader? Who?"

Finn was stilI confused about who Byron was referring to.
Byron pulled Emily closer, "See? This is my leader. Remember to be polite to Ms. Johnson."


At that moment. Bianca and James also arrived.


James wasn't participating in this race, but Bianca had heard that Finn was racing and came to support him.


She had also heard Byron's name announced, so she wasn't surprised to see Emily here.


"Finn, I knew you'd be here. Good luck."


Bianca cheerfully ran over and linked arms with Finn,giving Emily a challenging look.


"Finn, Emily came with Byron. She probably hasn't been here before and wants to see what it's like. But when you and Byron race. I wonder who Emily will cheer for?"


Bianca's words were meant to put Emily in a difficult position, forcing her to choose sides and inevitably offend someone.


Finn sneered. "Who cares about her support? The Johnson family doesn't need someone so ungrateful."


Byron laughed.


Finn frowned at Byron. "What's so funny? You don't know Emily.Whoever she's with is doomed. She's a troublemaker. Do you think you've struck gold?"


"Shut up!"

Byron was furious. "Ms. Johnson will obviously cheer for me. You're just
bitter because you can't have her. Say one more bad word about Ms.Johnson, and you'll regret it."

"Emily. Byron and Finn are fighting over you. You should say something.Or do you enjoy this kind of attention? That's not a good mindset."

Bianca urged.

"Shut up!" Byron defended Emily, glaring at Bianca. "If it weren't for you.we wouldn't be arguing!"


"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I just don't want Finn and Byron to be upset.Friendship comes first, competition second. This conflict might affect the race."


Bianca tried to sound noble.

Finn immediately said. "You can defend Emily all you want, but why take it out on Bianca? She's just trying to help."

He sneered at Emily. "Emily, seeing Byron wrapped around your finger and misunderstanding Bianca, are you proud of yourself?"

"First race drivers, five minutes to get ready..."

The announcement interrupted them.

Finn glared at Emily. "We'll settle this later!"

He pulled Bianca away.

James suddenly spoke up. "Finn, let me race for you!"

Everyone turned to look at him.
James was a top racer among his peers. though not quite at QS's level. His participation would be like cheating.

He couldn't bear the sight of Emily with Byron, even if it meant pushing her further away.


Bianca was surprised but didn't object, seeing an opportunity to embarrass Emily and Byron.


Finn was about to agree when Colt protested. "Mr. Smith, this isn't fair.Switching racers last minute, especially targeting Mr. Reyes."

Colt saw James's participation as an unfair advantage.

But Finn, seeing Colt's reaction, was even more convinced.

"Alright, James, here you go. show Byron who's boss. Let's see if he dares to be cocky around us again."


Finn laughed.

James raised an eyebrow. "What? Scared? I thought you were tougher than this. If you can't handle it, just forfeit."


Byron clenched his fists, veins bulging.

He was about to speak when Emily cut in.

"Alright!"
###Chapter 94 Change the Competition Rules,Do you Dare?

"Emily、you really should've asked Byron first. This isn't a game,and if you don't get it. you shouldn't just answer for him!" Bianca almost couldn't hold back her laughter. Emily was so naive. She must think this is just a casual competition with no real consequences.


Byron was about to agree anyway. Since Emily answered for him,he wouldn't let Bianca mock her. "Ms. Johnson and I are on the samne page. I was gonna answer, and she did it for me. What's it to you? I just can't stand how you always pretend to be helpfual but end up making decisions for others. Bianca, you're the last person wwho should be talking."


Byron's retort left Bianca's face pale. Her eyes reddened, on the verge of tears. "I'm sorry. James. Finn. I shouldn't have spoken out of turn. Even though Emily doesn't like me. I can't help but think of our family ties."


"It's not your fault, you don't need to apologize!" Finn quickly interjected,looking at Emily. "Since you answered for Byron, why not raise the stakes a bit? Byron. you don't mind, do you?"


"No way! Mr. Smith is bound to lose. Why should we raise the stakes?"Colt protested.worried.


Byron hesitated for a moment. Finn smirked. "If you know you're gonna lose, why not just admit defeat? Then I won't mention any stakes."


Emily's gaze fixed on James.′′Fnn suggested raising the stakes. What do you think?"


James was surprised Emily would ask that. He thought she was calm because she didn't know his skills. She probably didn't even know the
rules of racing, so she dared to ask him. He wanted to show her just how much better he was than Byron.


"If it's a race, there should be stakes!" James said firmly.


Bianca's palms were sweaty. She quickly thought about suggesting a stake that would benefit her if they won. She was sure Byron would lose. "James.if we're talking stakes, how about 5% of the Reyes Group's shares?"


James considered it. "Alright!" He looked at Byron, or rather, at Emily beside him. Emily didn't seek Byron's approval. "Regular races are boring.Let's make it more challenging."


Everyone's eyes turned to Emily, as if asking, "Do you know what you're saying?" They all thought she was speaking out of ignorance. Emily continued. "How about a team race? I'll ride shotgun with Byron. As for you,James? Will Bianca join you, or will Finn take her place?"


She wanted to force Bianca into the race. Bianca's face turned even paler.If she refused, she'd be admitting she was scared,giving Emily a reason to mock her in the future. Bianca didn't want that. She grabbed James's hand.pretending to be brave. "James, I'll race with you. I'm not afraid."

Finn was worried. "No, I'll go. Bianca, your health..."


"Finn, with Jamnes., I won't be afraid. My body can handle that," Bianca insisted.


Emily chuckled coldly. "Bianca says she's fine. Her illness seems to come and go as she pleases. Since it's settled, James, could you let the organizers know to change the rules?"


James had to use the Smith family's name, as he always did. Emily was putting him in a position where he had to do it. Since he requested the
change, he couldn't refuse Emily's condition. "Fine. I'll go. Wait here!"

James's face was dark, as he was not pleased about replacing Finn. Emily watched him make the call, satisfied. Finn was furious. "Emily, you're truly vile. Raised outside, you've forgotten your roots, always bullying Bianca. Do you think this will make the family love you? No way! You won't surpass Bianca. You're only here because she needs you."


"What do you mean? If Bianca doesn't let Ms. Johnson live,she can't?Such a family isn't worth it. Ms. Johnson, come to the Reyes family.You'll be the only princess there!" Byron snapped.


He was spoiled but not inherently bad. His words touched Emily.So,she was born because Bianca needed her umbilical cord blood. And she was brought back because Bianca might need a bone marrow transplant. Finn knew from the start.


Emily's eyes turned icy as she looked at Finn. "You finally told the truth!You all knew why I was brought back, including Bianca, who pretended to love me. You're the hypocrites! Finn, I've already cut ties with the Johnson family,so your lectures don't work on me."


Finn was shocked. He didn't know this. He looked at Bianca, who shook her head with tears in her eyes."Finn, we never meantto drive Emily away. We just wanted her to reflect. We didn't expect herto take it to the extreme."


"You blame us for your coldness. I want to see how you'll marry into the Smith family without the Johnson family's support. It seems James doesn't care much for you either!" Finn spat out angrily.

At that moment, James finished his call, but the announcement didn't come immediately. He stood at a distance, frowning, unwilling to
acknowledge that his influence was insufficient. The organizers said they needed to consult their boss.


Meanwhile, in the lounge, Charles and Daniel were watching the monitors.Charles was anxious. "Daniel, look at all the contestants. Which one has QS's aura? Could it be one of them? Wait. Ms. Johnson is there, and so is James, but it doesn't look pleasant."


Daniel wasn't interested in searching for QS before the race. He believed he could instantly recognize her driving skills.. So. he waited patiently. Until Charles mentioned Emily. Daniel's eyes snapped open. locking onto her.


Just then. there was a knock on the lounge door. A middle-aged man hurried in. "Mr. Daniel Smith. Mr. Charles Green. Mr. James Green called to request a rule change for the race."
###Chapter 95 Emily Has Grown Up

"Change the rules? Is that a joke to himn? Well. what's his plan?"

Charles glanced away from the video, raising an eyebrow with interest.

Daniel stayed quiet but didn't stop Charles from asking.

The middle-aged man understood Daniel's intent; he wanted to know the details,too.


So. he explained the specifics of the rule changes Emily had proposed.

Daniel's first thought was that it had to be Emily's idea!

"Agree to it!" He said firmly.

"Got it. I'll pass the message right away."

The middle-aged man respectfully left after receiving the order.

The room was once again just the two of them.

Charles raised an eyebrow, "Daniel, I didn't know you could be so lenient with a junior. You must think highly of this, James!"

As a close friend. Charles knew very well how principled Daniel was.

Changing the rules on a whim was nothing short of indulgence.

Daniel's expression remained indifferent.

Someone like James didn't deserve his indulgence.

At that moment. James, who was waiting in the hallway outside, suddenly felt a chill down his spine.
The season was turning to fall.

Could it be that everything was starting to cool down?


Just then, his phone rang.


He received the confirmation about the rule changes.


James hung up and walked into the room. head held high. feeling quite pleased with himself. He was eager to tell Emily that he had resolved the issue with just one phone call.

But before he could speak. the announcement came over the loudspeaker.


The new rules were directly announced.


Initially, there were quite a few complaints about the sudden rule change.but once people heard the new rules. which were evenmore exciting,most of them changed their attitudes.


The few who still had objections were drowned out by the majority.


"With the new rules, there's a twenty-minute prep time. Perfect timing,I had a contract drafted. When it arrives, Mr. Smith and Bianca, make sure to sign it!"


Emily spoke with a smile that didn't reach her eyes.


Her smile was faint, but her presence was impossible to ignore.


James looked at Emily, feeling a sense of unfamiliarity.

It was as if he had truly lost Emily.

This thought made James inexplicably anxious.
He even forgot to ask what.they were supposed to sign.

Bianca noticed James's lack of reaction and shook his arm. He was still staring at Emily, unmoving.


Frustrated. Bianca had to ask. "Emily, what are we supposed to sign? We're just playing around. why take it so seriously?"


Emily ignored Bianca.


She checked the time and asked Byron to find out when the printed documents would arrive.


Byron sent a message and quickly received a reply.

"They'll be here in five minutes."

Emily nodded.

She looked up to speak to James, but met his complex gaze.

"Don't look at me like that. We talked aboout the stakes for the competition.If we lose. we'll give up five percent of the Reyes Group's shares. But if you lose, Mr. Smith, what will you offer? Five percent of Ascend Global Group's shares?"


"That's impossible! Five percent of the Reyes Group's shares can't compare to five percent of Ascend Global Group's shares!" Bianca blurted out.


She was going to marry James, so Ascend Global Group's shares would be hers in the future. How could she give them to Emily?


Emily looked at Bianca with a faint smile. "You seem so anxious. Anyone would think Ascend Global Group's shares are already yours. Even if you're marrying James and will inherit the shares, that's not now. You should
keep your intentions hidden."

"Emily, you're getting it all wrong about me and James. I'm just standing up for him. Can you stop with the baseless accusations?"


Bianca's eyes flickered with guilt as she tried to explain.


James's expression stiffened.

For a moment, he felt guilty and couldn't meet Emily's eyes.

Did she know?


Impossible!


What happened between him and Bianca that night was an accident. He hadn't told anyone. and Bianca. being kind-hearted. had promised not to let Emily know.


So. Emily was just guessing as usual.

Realizing this. James regained his composure and responded, "Fine, five percent of Ascend Global Group's shares,"


Their conversation caught the attention of their social circle, and soon everyone knew about the stakes.


Some curious onlookers couldn't help but gather to see what was happening. When they heard about the stakes, they gasped.


Although Ascend Global Group might not be as large as the Smith Group.its shares were incredibly valuable due to the Smith Group's backing. No one expected the stakes to be this high.

Many people shared the news in their group chats.
Even though their bets weren't as large, they were still significant for ordinary people.


Soon,the contract was delivered.

Emily and Byron signed without hesitation.


No one questioned why Emily needed to sign. She was just a companion;how could she make decisions for the Reyes Group?


But at that moment, everyone was focused on the five percent of Ascend Global Group's shares in James's hands and didn't notice this detail.


Bianca, in her haste. also signed her name. following Emily's lead.

"Participants. take your positions. The race is about to start."

The announcement came again.

Emily followed Byron to change into her racing suit.

She tied her ponytail high, and her tall figure fit perfectly into a small-sized men's racing suit.


The fitted suit accentuated her curves, and combined with her confident aura, she looked both fierce and cool.


Bianca had thought that Emily, deciding at the last minute, wouldn't have a proper outfit and would end up looking ridiculous.


But when Emily appeared, all eyes were on her.


James couldn't help but watch Emily. who looked both heroic and feminine.
He finally realized something.

She had grown up. Matured!

In ways he hadn't noticed, she had quietly become a real woman.

"James, the host is urging us to start. Let's get in the car."

Bianca noticed James's gaze and glared at Emily with venomous eyes.

Emily mnust have done this on purpose.

Did she think she could seduce James this way? No way.

James could only be hers.

She quickly reminded James. pulling his attention back.

With the sound of a gunshot. the race began.

Besides their two cars. several others were also in the race.


But as the race started, it was James and Byron's cars that sped off side by side.


Byron knew the likely outcome but still gave it his all.

The more he tried, the more nervous he became.


At the first turn, his nervousness caused him to make a mistake, and James pulled ahead.


"James, you're amazing! You left Byron behind so quickly. You're definitely going to win."

Bianca praised him enthusiastically.
James smirked, glancing at Byron struggling to keep up in the rearview mirror.


His car's performance was excellent, and his skills were top-notch. With a steady mindset, he maintained his lead over Byron.

Byron, seeing the gap widen.grew more anxious and prone to mistakes.

"Damn it!" He couldn't help but curse.
###Chapter 96 How Is It Possible? As If Assiste by a God!

"Turn the wheel, hit the gas..." Emily suddenly spoke up from the passenger seat.


Byron was caught off guard.


He hadn't expected Emily to start giving orders out of nowhere.

For a moment. Byron hesitated. unsure if he should follow her instructions.

Seeing Byron distracted. Emily frowned and spoke with stern authority."
Focus. If you don't want to lose.follow my lead."


Byron felt an inexplicable urge to obey Emily's authority. He instinctively
followed her directions.

Emily watched as Byron complied.

She kept her eyes on the road,fully concentrated.

"Turn the wheel... hit the gas..."


With each command from Emily, Byron found himself tuning out all other sounds, hearing only her voice.


His initial tension began to fade, replaced by absolute trust.


And indeed, as he followed Emily's directions, the gap between him and James started to close.


Bianca had always claimed to know about racing. but her experience was mostly from watching a few races and reading some theory.
Sitting in the car, feeling the speed, she was already a bit nervous.


Seeing Byron, who had been left behind, catching up, she couldn't help but exclaim in panic.


"How is this possible? James, hurry up! That witch Emily and Byron are catching up!"


In her panic, Bianca's true feelings slipped out.

James, shocked. glanced at Bianca.


Bianca, not realizing her slip. urged. "James. what are you doing? Focus! If you get distracted. they'll overtake us. I don't know what Emily did.but Byron is catching up!"


James frowned.


He refocused and began to accelerate, but a seed of doubt had been planted in his mind.


James started to realize that maybe Bianca wasn't as sweer and innocent as he thought.


After all, what slips out in a moment of panic is often the most genuine.

Only two laps left.


James saw Emily and Byron's car getting closer, his brow furrowed. lips pressed tight.


"Accelerate, floor it..." Emily's voice was calm and focused as she spoke to Byron.


As her words fell. Byron suddenly floored the gas pedal.
The car surged forward, overtaking James'car.

"Ms. Johnson, hold on tight. we're about to turn..." Byron's eyes gleamed with excitement.


He hadn't expected Emily to know so much about cars.

Emily was truly amazing. a jack-of-all-trades!

The Johnson family had really underestimated her, calling such a talented person useless.

"Keep going!" Emily's voice was as calm as if she were asking for a glass of water. with no hint of tension.


Bianca. seeing Byron's car overtake them. panicked and grabbed James'hand on the wheel. "James. hurry up! Byron's overtaken us. floor it!"

James' hand jerked. almost causing them to crash into another car.

He snapped. "Let go and shut up!"

His voice was cold and irritated.

Bianca, frightened, let go and apologized, "I'm sorry, James, I didn't mean to. I just..."


"I said shut up and be quiet!" James shouted angrily.

Bianca's face turned pale, her eyes red with tears, looking pitiful.

But James had no time to care.

With a shout of "Hold on!", he floored the gas pedal.

Though they managed to catch up to Emily and Byron's car, the
atmosphere in their car was tense, with Bianca's screams adding to James'frustration.


He couldn't even spare a thought for Bianca, his eyes red. focused on Emily and Byron's car like a predator on its prey.


The two cars took turns leading. each closely tailing the other.


The spectators were silen. eyes glued to the two cars. not daring to blink for fear of missing the most exciting moment.


In the control room. Charles watched intently.


"Wasn't James supposed to be the best after QS and you? I thought he'd easily beat Byron. What's going on? When did Byron get so good?"


Charles loved racing and often watched other races. He had seen Byron race recently.


How had Byron improved so much in such a shon time?

"It's not him!"

Daniel's voice was low, his eyes fixed on Emily.


Though far away, he could see her serious expression. occasionally moving her lips. and he had a hunch.

"What do you mean, not him?"


Charles didn't understand.

Daniel's eyes never left Emily. He didn't explain his guess.

Charles followed Daniel's gaze to Emily.
He frowned. looking from Emily to Byron.

At first, he didn't notice anything.


But after a particularly skillful maneuver, overtaking James again, Charles stood up.


"Impossible!"


He couldn't believe Byron had mastered such skills so quickly.

For the first time. Charles focused on Emily.


He noticed her lips moving. and every time they did. Byron's car would speed up. change lanes. or overtake.


His eyes widened. realizing the possibility. He asked Daniel."Daniel. are you saying it's not Byron driving. but Emily? How is that possible? Emily has this kind of skill?"


Daniel's eyes were deep as he looked at Charles, 'Why noe?'

This was an indirect confirmation of Emily's role.


Charles was speechless.


His understanding of Emily was based on limited information,which made it shallow.


Daniel continued watching the monitor, his face calm, but his heart racing with the car's speed.


On the track, Emily and James' cars were on the final lap.

Bianca was pale. unable to give James any more instructions.
The cars were neck and neck as they reached the final turn.

James,eyes wild. glanced at the two cars beside him.

Suddenly,his eyes flashed.


He steered his car closer to Emily and Byron's, moving towards the inner lane.


With another car on their right and the grass on the inner side, the upcoming turn was crucial.


If they accelerated. the tight turn would require top-notch skills and precise control, making it dangerous for anyone but the best.
###Chapter 97 She is Greedy, That Is Her Weakness

"Not good!"


Charles exhaled sharply. "James is really sneaky! Looks like the game's over!"


Even though he thought James was a bit underhanded. as long as there were no rule violations. everyone only cared about the results.


"Not necessarily!" Daniel, who had been silent. suddenly spoke up.


Charles didn't take his eyes off the screen. but couldn't help his curiosity."Daniel.why are you so sure? And I've noticed you seem to have blind faith in Emily. Don't tell me you have a thing for her?

"Even in such a tense race. you can't keep your mouth shut!"

Daniel's sarcastic voice came through.


Charles sighed but obediently closed his mouth, continuing to watch the final moments on the screen.


Byron was gripping the steering wheel, his hands sweating from the tension.


"Accelerate, take the turn..."


Emily was beside him, giving serious instructions.


Byron's forehead was covered in sweat. his eyes bloodshot. Hearing Emily s words, hebit his lip, floored the gas pedal. and turned the wheel.
But his skills weren't quite there yet. He struggled to gauge the right angle and maintain the inner lane without flipping over.


As the car accelerated, half of it seemed to lift off the ground.


Emily's eyes narrowed, and she suddenly reached over to adjust the steering wheel.


The audience collectively gasped. holding their breath as they watched.

James was also taken aback.


He quickly accelerated and turned his wheel.

Both cars took the turn simultaneously.


Bianca, in James's car. was too scared to notice Emily's car. The turn was so sharp it felt like she might be thrown out.

"Help. I don't want to die..."

Bianca screamed uncontrollably, her whole body going limp with fear.

James was irritated by her screams, which distracted him during the dangerous turn.


His body shook, and he instinctively eased off the gas.

The car slowed down just enough.


Emily and Byron's car successfully navigated the turn, overtaking James's car like an arrow shot from a bow.


James's face darkened with anger.

By the time his car reached the finish line. Emily and Byron's car was
already waiting ahead.

Byron had already gotten out of the car, his legs weak. Colt quickly stepped forward to support him.


Byron motioned for another assistant to help Emily, but she had already stepped out of the car.


Unlike Byron. who was shaky and exhausted. Emily remained calm and composed.


"Ms. Johnson. you're amazing! If it weren't for you. I would've either lost or ended up in the ICU from that turn!"

Byron. supported by Colt. approached Emily. his voice trembling with emotion. almost kneeling before her.


"Enough, have some dignity! Since I'm your leader and promised to protect you. I naturally follow through?"

Emily.though slightly annoyed, didn't roll her eyes at Byron.

At that moment. James's car arrived.

He looked at Emily with a complex expression and walked over step by step.

"James... my legs are weak. I was so scared!"

Bianca's voice, hoarse and pitiful, called out, but James ignored her,his patience wearing thin.

Just then. Finn rushed over with a stern face.

James didn't turn to help Bianca; instead. he instructed Finn, "Go help
Bianca."

Then he strode over to Emily.

"You've got guts!"

James hadn't expected Byron to win, realizing it was Emily's guidance that made the difference. Seeing her standing there. unshaken, he understood she hadn't panicked and disrupted Byron.


He spoke with a hint of admiration. "I remember when you were just a kid.you fought a grown man over some trash. You've always been brave."


Emily didn't know what he was trying to convey and remained silent.

James turned to Byron. "You won because of luck and Emily's courage. If it were just you and me. you wouldn't have won!


He refused to admit Byron was more skilled.

His words implied Bianca had been a distraction.

Bianca, supported by Finn, heard this and paled even more,her body trembling as if in shock.

Tears streamed down her face, "James, I'm sorry, it's all my fault for being so useless and scared!"


Her apology, though tearful, was pitiful.

If James continued to blame her, it would make him seem petty. He suppressed his irritation. "It's not entirely your fault. I didn't expect you to be so frightened."

Bianca, initially relieved by his words, suddenly froze. her expression
Her mind raced, and she quickly turned to Emily, "Emily. you see, even James is disappointed in me. You don't need to be jealous. In James's eyes.you're still the best. Let's just consider today's race a friendly competition and forget about the bet?"


Emily couldn't help but laugh. "You think you can just forget about a signed contract? It's clear how unreliable your words are. I wonder how many fools you've tricked."


Byron chimed in. "Exactly, a signed contract is legally binding. Stop playing dumb. you legal ignoramus!"

"I...James..."

Bianca.humiliated. looked to James for support. her eyes red.

James glared at her. signaling her to stop talking nonsicnse.

Finn. however. spoke up. "Emily, don't get too cocky.It wasn't your skill that won. If anything happens to Bianca, it'll be your fault. Don't expect me to go easy on you."

Byron stepped in front of Emily, blocking Finn's fierce gaze, "Do you think I'm dead? Bianca overestimated herself; who can she blame? You knew Mr. Smith's level and still switched drivers. We had to set some rules!"


Emily,having just won 5% of Ascend Global Group's shares. was in a great mood and didn't want to argue with Finn:

She told Byron. "Let's go!"
She headed to the louinge to change and leave.

As she passed James, she reminded him, "The contract is in effect. Don't forget the 5% share transfer."


James's face darkened even more. his nails digging into his palms.

Seeing his reaction. Emily felt even better.

She was about to change and leave when someone knocked on her lounge door.
###Chapter 98 Emily Is Awesome

"Who are you? What's going on?"

Emily paused while changing clothes and went to open the door.

Seeing the unfamiliar face at the door. she asked curiously.


"Hello, our boss just announced some new rules for the race. Thought you might be interested."


The person responded respectfully to Emily's question.

"Tell me more."


Emily replied calmly. though she was puzzled. Why had this person come to her? Was it just a coincidence that they knocked on all the dressing rooms. or did they know she was a racer?


Did they know about her advice to Byron? Who was this boss, and was this boss a friend or foe?


"Well, our boss mentioned that some skilled racers are here today, so the prize money has been bumped up. The first-place winner will get twenty million dollars. He asked us to inform everyone.


The person explained patiently.


Emily's eyes lit up at the mention of "twenty million dollars." It seemed it wasn't targeted at her specifically; anyone interested could participate.


"A race, what about the car?"


"If you need a car, we can provide one. Do you want to register and use one of our cars?"
Suppressing her doubts. Emily thought it was impressive that the boss had anticipated this and made arrangements.

Emily tightened her grip on the door handle and lowered her gaze.contemplating whether to use their car. Racers usually know their own car s performance best and can maximize its potential, so they typically don't choose someone else's car. But she didn't have her car here.


She thought of Byron's car. She had just given Byron some pointers,so she was somewhat familiar with it. But she quickly dismissed the idea.


"Have your colleagues already notified others? Are many people participating? How long until the race starts?"


Emily suddenly asked.


The staff member. though unsure of Emily's intentions. answered truthfully."Half an hour."


That should be enough time.

Emily nodded. "Alright, no need to prepare a car. Do I need to register with my identity information? Can someone else register for me?"

If she used the name QS, she didn't want to reveal her idenrity for now.


For some reason, this staff member was particularly accommodating,and almost all of Emily's concerns were met with satisfactory answers.


After the staff member left. Emily immediately called Knox.


She felt she owed him a lot of favors. but she didn't mind asking for help again.


Knox's eyes lit up when he saw Emily's call.
"Emily. I thought you had forgotten about me."

"Don't worry, I haven't forgotten the meal I owe you. I'll treat you to two meals if needed. But I need your help with something now."


Emily was straightforward.


Anyone else might hesitate to ask Knox for favors. but Emily's confidence was one of the reasons Knox admired her.


"Emily,you really don't hold back! What do you need?"

"I need a race car. ready in half an hour."


Emily spoke about needing a car as if it were a glass of water or a small toy.


"Getting a car is no problem. but I need to know what race you're entering."


He was curious that she was racing.

Emily kept surprising him, making his previously dull life exciting.

"There's a race in the north part of the cirytoday.I'll send you the address.
It starts in half an hour, with a prize of twenty million dollars.I'm planning to participate."


Emily knew her identity wouldn't be a secret to Knox, but she trusted him.

Knox's eyes lit up. "Alright. I'll arrange it."

He didn't mention that he planned to surprise her by showing up.

After hanging up with Knox. Emily called Byron.
MS. J0m15011.

Byron quickly came over.

"I'm planning to enter the race. Register me under the name QS."

Emily said calmly.

"Who? QS? You mean you're QS? I knew you were amazing. but I didn't realize you were this incredible!"


Anyone who loved racing knew about the thrilling race a year ago. Emily was probably just eighteen at the time. QS had emerged out of nowhere.won the race. and then disappeared. Everyone had searched for QS. but no one thought to look for an eighteen-year-old girl-no wonder they couldn't find her.


Besides YJ. the king of racing. QS was Byron's idol. Now that QS was Emily, he was ecstatic, almost losing his mind.


Emily's ears hurt from his excitement. She slapped Byron's head."Calm down. Go register, and get me a helmer that covers my face."


She didn't want to reveal her identiry yet, so covering her face was necessary.

"Alright, I'll go now. Ms. Johnson, what car will you use? You can use mine!"


Byron quickly offered.

"No need.I've arranged for a car. It'll be here soon."

"Okay, Ms. Johnson, I'll go register now!"
Byron practically floated away, still in shock from Emily being QS.

Emily had some time, so she looked at her spoils-five percent of Ascend Global Group's shares. She reviewed the contract. took a photo, and sent it to Isaac.


Isaac hadn't heard from Emily for days and thought she had abandoned the project. He was surprised to receive her message. He quickly opened it and saw the five percent shares of Ascend Global Group. Curious,he looked at the signatures. The first was James's name. and the other was Emily's.


Emily's message followed. "I need Mr. Reyes to arrange for someone reliable to handle the transfer of these shares."


Isaac was amazed. Emily. a doctor. seemed more like a businesswoman.casually acquiring five percent shares.


"By the way. I'll be joining the project tomorrow to coordinate with the Johnson Group." Emily added.

"Alright, I'll notify the Johnson Group," Isaac replied.

He planned to accompany her tomorrow, anticipating the Johnson Group's reaction to Emily's involvement.


Emily didn't know Isaac's thoughts. Soon, she received Knox's call; the car had arrived. She hurried to the entrance.


Unbeknownst to her, Daniel was monitoring her movements.

"Daniel, what are you looking at?"

Charles,already dressed for the race, came over to check on Daniel. He was
curious if Daniel was ready for the race.

To his surprise, Daniel hadn't changed yet and was staring at a screen.
Charles couldn't help but peek.

Daniel naturally stood up. blocking Charles's view.
###Chapter 99 Bullying James

"You ready? I'm not holding back!" Daniel's voice was deep and casual.effortlessly shifting the topic.

Charles had been itching to race against Daniel to see how they stacked up.so he naturally hoped Daniel would give it his all.


"That's exactly what I want. But shouldn't you change your clothes? The race is about to start." Charles reminded him.


"Yeah, so you need to leave." Daniel shot him an annoyed glance.

Charles wanted to argue. "We're both guys. what's the big deal... Fine, I'll go. I'll wait for you outside!"


Before he could finish. he met Daniel's cold gaze and quickly backed down.hurrying out of the room.


This race was Daniel's idea. He wanted to confirm his suspicion that Emily was QS. He hadn't been entirely sure before, but seeing her at the back entrance witha race car in front of her, Daniel was almost certain she was the mysterious QS.


Though he wasn't as dramatic as Byron, Daniel was still shocked. It meant she had started racing as soon as she became an adult. Unlike Byron,Daniel felt a pang of sympathy for Emily. What kind of circumstances had forced her into such dangerous activities?


As Daniel went to grab his racing gear. his eyes fell on the surveillance screen, focusing on the man who had just stepped out of the car.

Knox Green!
How did Emily know this guy? And they seemed pretty familiar.especially with Knox ruffling Emiy's hair. Daniel's deep eyes were filled with murderous intent, as if he wanted to pierce through Knox's hand.


Emily suddenly looked up, sensing something. Her gaze met Daniel's through the screen. Even the usually composed Daniel felt a moment of panic at being caught.


Realizing he could still feel flustered. Daniel couldn't help but smile. He knew he had developed feelings for Emily.


"What's wrong?" Knox asked. noticing Emily had paused and looked somewhere.


Emily didn't see anything unusual. She shook her head calmly. "Nothing.probably just my imagination."


She had come to the race by chance today and hadn't revealed herself as QS before, so it was unlikely anyone was specifically watching her.

"How about I join the race too? I'm curious about your skills. Emily,you never told me you could race."


Knox,with his charmingly roguish smile, looked genuinely hurt.

Emily found his expression odd, "You never asked. so I didn't mention it.Who goes around talking about that? If you want to race, I won't stop you.But you're not going to take back the car you gave me. right?"

"Relax, I won't take it back. I was just joking."


Knox laughed at Emily's wary expression. It was rare to see her like this.Despite her young age, she acted so mnaturely. He had decided on a whim;rather than racing against Emily, he wanted to watch her skills from the
sidelines.

Soon.Byron called.


"Ms. Johnson, you're all signed up. Don't worry. no one will know who you are."


Byron reported excitedly, as if they were pulling off a grand scheme together.


"Good!"


Emily was much calmer. She hung up and stopped chatting with Knox.preparing to drive into the arena. Before getting in the car. she turned to Knox. "I'll send you my race number through Byron."


Since her friend was here. she wanted him to watch.

"Alright!"

Knox nodded with a smile.

Emily drove into the arena. Another racer,James, was there too. He felt he lost to Byron because of Bianca's interference. To prove his skills, he decided to join the solo race.


Cars were arriving at the venue. Charles burst into Daniel's room, clearly excited.


"Daniel, did you know? QS is really here! I knew her comeback announcement was perfectly timed. She signed up for the race. You're going to compete against her. This is a historic race. thank goodness I didn't miss it."


Charles was so excited that he forgot that Daniel might still be changing.
Anyone else would have been cut off mid-sentence, but Charles's words didn't seem to affect Daniel.


Daniel had already guessed it. But hearing Charles confirm it. his previously calm demeanor suddenly felt like a rookie's excitement.

"Let's go!"

Daniel didn't even glance at Charles. walking past him.

"Daniel,wait for me! How can you be so calm? That's QS!"


Charles chased after Daniel. talking nonstop.


Daniel frowned. He hadn't realized Charles could be so chatty.But it was this kind of personality that made them friends. Two quiet people wouldn t have much to say. and the silence would be unbearable.


Emily was already in the arena. Her car was number seven. Daniel's car was number eight. He had arranged it after learning Emily's car had entered.


Daniel glanced at Emily. Though he couldn't see her face,he could imagine the scene. Emily sensed the gaze from the car next to hers. She turned and briefly looked at the other car.


Even without seeing the driver's face, the aura was unmistakable. She felt a connection,guessing this person might be her biggest rival.


She looked down at the car. Though the exterior didn't reveal much,the sound of the engine at the start of the race told her it had been specially modified.


Initially, there wasn't much difference. Emily's car and Daniel's car
maintained the same speed. neck and neck. James, however, floored the gas.quickly leaving several cars behind. He smirked under his helmet,feeling arrogant and pleased.


But his satisfaction didn't last long. He found his car being flanked.The cars on either side matched his speed, staying half a car length behind him.


James wondered if Byron had sent people to mess with him. Soon.he realized it wasn't the case. The other cars were effortlessly keeping up with him.


Emily had recognized James's car. Even without seeing the model.his driving style gave him away. She was surprised the car beside her seemed to have a grudge against James. too. working with her to box him in.


As another lap passed. the other cars fell behind. and all eyes were on the three leading cars.
###Chapter 100 You Are Foolish And You Don' Know Yourself

"What's happening? Why do I feel like those two cars are ganging up on the one in the middle?"


"Who's in the middle? Looks like it's James from the Smith family."


"I can't see the faces of the drivers on either side. Who are they to be so bold? Aren't they worried about Mr. Smith's retaliation?"


The spectators were wide-eyed.chattering away.


"Is that the point? Look at that turn! Such skill! Not something just anyone can pull off."

Suddenly.someone shouted.

Immediately,people started standing up in excitement.

One person standing up inspired more people to stand up in excitement.


"Mr. Smith got left behind! Who would've thought we'd see this in today's race? Who are No. 7 and No. 8? They're amazing! Who do you think will win?"


"Doesn't that technique look familiar to anyone? I remember QS using it last year when he burst onto the scene!"


"Which one is QS? Maybe someone learned it from him. QS has been off the radar."


"Haven't you seen Twitter? He announced his comeback. Could it really be him?"
"Then who's the other one?"

Emily was unaware of the discussions.

After leaving James behind, she made a sharp turn.


For the first time, she encountered someone who could match her skills.igniting her competitive spirit.


When the opponent used the same technique. her eyes lit up.

Charles was also watching with excitement.

One was Daniel, and the other he recognized as QS through their technique.
His palms were sweaty with tension.

"Go number 7! Go number 8!"

Charles shouted.

His acquaintances turned to him. puzzled.

"Mr. Green, who are you rooting for?"

Charles snorted, "I'm happy no matter who wins!"

As he spoke. Emily's car edged past Daniel's, crossing the finish line first.

She knew the opponent had let her win a bit.


Otherwise,they would have tied for first place.

Regardless of the opponent's reasons, she won.

The twenty million dollars would fund her next experiment.
Emily got out of the car. nodded to the opponent. and said. "Thank you!"

Then she quickly prepared to leave.

She didn't want to reveal her identity yet.

But she didn't expect James to block her path after quitting the race.

"Who are you?"

He was looking for trouble!


Emily raised an eyebrow. mocking. "Mr. Smith. lost and now seeking revenge?"


She tried to walk past him.

"Don't go!"


James blocked her with his arm. "You and number 8 teamed up against me. I need to know who you are."


Emily looked at him with disgust, "What if I don't tell you? If you do anything, tomorrow's news will be #Mr. James Smith can't handle losing a race and abuses his power!"


"Tll ask you again, who are you? My patience is limited. Don't blame me if I get rough. Do you think your news will get our?"


James ignored Emily's words. Since she embarrassed him. she should be prepared for his retaliation.


"James.you've got some nerve!"

Daniel didn't want to reveal his identity. but Charles saw his low mood.
Charles could speak up.

Chatles smirked, his tone mocking. But James had to take him seriously.

"Charles Green!"


James' face changed. Charles was close to DDaniel and from the Green family. He couldn't afford to offend him. He noticed Daniel in his racing uniform next to Charles. So, these two targeted him on purpose. He didn't believe it was a coincidence.


"Calling my name won't help. You should leave before you embarrass yourself and the Smith family. You don't want Daniel to find out about today.do you?"


Charles glanced at Daniel as he spoke. Emily didn't notice, but she realized Charles' sharp tongue wasn't just for her; it was indiscriminate.


Seeing James silenced by Charles, she couldn't help but laugh. The sound was a clear provocation to James.


James thought, even if Charles intervened, he couldn't stop him. Charles wouldn't target him over this. He had the Smith family backing him.He needed to vent his anger.


"Mr. Green, you saw Emily provoke me. And the man next to her is clearly her accomplice. If they hadn't targeted me, I wouldn't have lost."


James believed his loss was due to their collusion.

Emily laughed louder, "Do you know what you look like right now?"

"What?" James didn't understand. But he knew Emily wouldn't say anything nice.
"Idiot!"

Daniel spoke. He lowered his voice, making it hard for Emily to recognize.

"Someone, I suspect these two of cheating for the twenty million dollars.
The man clearly let the woman win!"


James' face was dark. Especially now, spectators wanting to meet Emily gathered around. Most participants had some wealth. They were in the same circle, and seeing James like this, they thought he couldn't handle losing.


Someone whispered. "What's going on? Can't handle losing?"


"He thinks they targeted him. If number 7 and number 8 hadn't teamed up,he wouldn't have lost."


"How can he say that? The final turn, their skills aren't something just anyone can do!"


James heard the murmurs. HIis face was grim. "Shut up! Who told you to talk?"


"Tell me.who are you?"

James's shout silenced everyone. He turned to Emily.


Emily stepped forward aggressively, "You want to know who I am? What will you do then?"


Daniel watched Emily's expression and demeanor,unable to suppress his smile.


"Yes. I'm curious too. Since you think we're accomplices, what will you do?
.
Though Daniel lowered his voice, his tone was unchanged. Speaking so much at once, Emily found his voice familiar. She couldn't help but look at him more closely.
