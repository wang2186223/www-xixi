I was an orphan, and when I turned twelve, my parents found me. I thought I could finally escape my suffering and experience the warmth of a home and the love of parents. To fit in, I did everything I could to please and serve my family. But what I never expected was that the reason they sought me out was for my bone marrow... They wanted to use it to save someone else! My heart shattered. How could parents be so cruel? Disillusioned with the world, I fell from the balcony and died. But to my surprise, I was reborn! This time, I would live for myself! Those who had hurt me would pay the price!
