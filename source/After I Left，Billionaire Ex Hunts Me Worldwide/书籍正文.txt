###Chapter 1

Everyone in high society knew Evelyn Langley was hopelessly devoted to Nathan Evans.

She fluttered around him like an tireless butterfly circling its flower.

Their breakup history could fill three pages, yet she was always the first to apologize.

The world was convinced Evelyn would never leave Nathan.

The air froze when the private room door swung open.

Nathan walked in with an unfamiliar girl draped over his arm, her waist so slender it looked breakable.

Evelyn was peeling grapes, fingertips glistening with juice.

"Why the silence?" She didn't look up. "Keep playing."

"Eve..." Her best friend hesitated.

Nathan had already settled on the couch with his companion. "Happy birthday." He tossed a gift box carelessly onto the table.

Brazen. Unapologetic.

Evelyn stood. "I need to freshen up."

The moment the door closed, whispers erupted—

"Have you lost your mind, Nate? Bringing her here knowing Eve's present?"

"You've crossed the line this time, man."

"Whatever." Nathan lit a cigarette, smirking through the smoke.

The epitome of a heartless playboy.

The bathroom mirror reflected Evelyn's pale face.

Staring at her red-rimmed eyes, she suddenly laughed.

"Pathetic."

To love so pathetically.

Taking a deep breath, she made her decision.

Yet the scene that greeted her still made her fingers tremble.

Nathan and the girl were playing an intimate game, their lips inching closer over a shared tissue.

The crowd erupted—

"That's our Nate!"

"Closer! Almost there!"

"Just kiss already!"

Evelyn's grip on the doorknob turned white.

This was the man she'd loved for six years. How laughable.

"Enough..." Someone noticed her and hurriedly warned.

Heads swiveled.

"Eve, don't misunderstand, just harmless fun..."

Nathan cut in: "Perfect timing. We need to talk."

"Go ahead."

"This back-and-forth is tiresome. Let's end it."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms, yet she felt nothing.

Six years of her youth, reduced to "tiresome."

"Chloe's different. I want something real with her."

Evelyn nodded. "Fine."

"You can still reach out if—"

"Unnecessary." She forced a smile. "Clean breaks are best."

Nathan's brow arched, visibly surprised.

Turning to the birthday boy, she said, "Happy birthday, Dylan. I'm leaving. Don't forget the grapes."

Grapes—Nathan's favorite.

But only if peeled and deseeded.

Over the years, Evelyn had mastered removing seeds in three seconds without damaging the fruit.

On good days, he'd pinch her cheek and tease, "Such wifely skills. Trying to marry me?"

He knew exactly what she wanted yet never committed.

"I'll have my driver take you."

"No need."

Dylan stood. "Let me—"

Evelyn waved him off and left.

"That was cruel, Nate."

"Relax. She'll come crawling back in days."

"I give it a week."

"Three days."

Nathan eyed the slightly ajar door, scoffing. "Three hours until she texts me."

"Hah! Easy win for Nate!"

"Evelyn's obsessed. She'd never really leave."

...

The villa was dark when she returned.

Twenty minutes sufficed to pack six years into a carry-on.

The walk-in closet's limited editions, the vanity's jewels—all untouched.

Only the wall of academic books gave her pause.

But knowledge lived in her mind; the volumes mattered less.

The drawer held a contract and check—

$50 million cash plus East Suburb Plot 72 worth $20 million.

Nathan's last breakup peace offering, left here deliberately.

He'd bet she wouldn't take it—that doing so meant finality.

$70 million for six years?

Evelyn laughed.

Not a bad trade.

She stuffed the documents into her bag.

If her youth fed a dog, at least she wouldn't leave empty-handed.

"Hello? I need deep cleaning services."

"Yes, everything. Double your rate."

Leaving the key on the entry table, she called her best friend from the car.

Midway, the cleaners confirmed—

"Ma'am, you're certain about discarding all these items?"

"Do whatever."

The line went dead.

Nathan returned near dawn to a sterile home.

Head pounding from cloying perfume, he collapsed on the sofa and slept.

Morning light woke him to kitchen sounds.

Reaching for water, he found the table bare.

He smirked. Back already, yet no water?

How childish.

"You'd better—"

"You're awake, sir?"

"Mrs. Watson?"

"Breakfast is ready. I added a blanket last night—you might've caught cold."

"...Right."
###Chapter 2

"Where's the porridge?" Nathan Evans frowned at the dining table.

Butler Thompson quickly explained, "You mean the nourishing porridge?"

"What nourishing porridge?"

"The one Miss Evelyn made every day—millet with yam, lotus seeds, and goji berries. It had to soak overnight." Thompson wiped his brow. "I don’t have her skills. Mine never turns out right."

Nathan set down his chopsticks. "Bring me some chili sauce."

"Right away."

"...This tastes off." Nathan eyed the jar. "The packaging is different too."

"The homemade one ran out. This is from the store."

"Go buy the right one."

"It’s not available." Thompson hesitated. "That was Miss Evelyn’s secret recipe..."

Bang!

"Sir? You’re not eating?"

"Hmm."

Thompson watched Nathan’s retreating figure, baffled.

The outburst made no sense.

"Wake up!"

Evelyn Langley burrowed deeper into the blankets. "Stop it..."

Her best friend, Sophia Laurent, applied lipstick. "It’s nine. Aren’t you going back to make breakfast for His Highness?"

In the past, Evelyn would rush home before dawn after sleepovers.

Just to cook that damn porridge.

Sophia always thought it was ridiculous.

A CEO like Nathan couldn’t handle his own breakfast?

Spoiled rotten.

Evelyn rolled over. "We broke up."

"How long will this last?"

"..."

"Breakfast is in the kitchen. I’m heading to work. Got a date tonight, so don’t wait—oh, never mind. You’ll probably run back to him soon. Lock up when you leave."

Hunger eventually dragged Evelyn out of bed.

Munching on a sandwich, sunlight warming her face, she realized how long it had been since she slept in.

After brunch, she went straight to the bank.

Cashing that $50 million check came first.

Money in hand meant security.

"I want to deposit ten million," she told the account manager.

The bank director personally offered favorable rates. After some negotiation, Evelyn signed, satisfied.

She repeated the process twice more.

By the time she left, she held three black cards, $30 million in savings, and $20 million in liquid assets.

"Best breakup ever."

Passing a salon, she walked in.

A membership card secured her immediate spot in the stylist’s chair.

"Your hair is gorgeous, like a princess’s—"

These curls had been for Nathan.

He loved threading his fingers through them during intimate moments.

"Cut it short. Straighten and dye it black." Evelyn’s tone was firm.

Even the prettest princess was still a caged bird.

She was done playing the role.

The new style was sleek and sharp. Next door, Uniqlo had a sale. She bought a white tee and jeans, changing on the spot.

At Harvard’s gates, students cycled past in the sunset glow.

"Ryan! Over here—"

A guy jogged past her. "Why’s everyone here?"

"We’re visiting Professor Roland..."

Ryan Clementson shook his head. "The hospital won’t allow crowds. Two reps from bioinformatics should go."

Bioinformatics... Professor Roland...

Evelyn hurried over. "Which Professor Roland?"

"Eleanor Roland." The guy flushed answering her.

"Which hospital?"

"Mass General."

"Thanks."

"Wait, which department are you—"

Evelyn was already walking away.

Back at the apartment, her mind raced.

That strict professor who rapped knuckles with a ruler was sick?

How serious?

She pulled up "Lily Anderson’s" number but couldn’t bring herself to call.

She’d given up her Ph.D. track for Nathan.

Became a housewife right after undergrad.

The professor must’ve been so disappointed.

"You’re still here?" Sophia returned from work, surprised.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Kicking me out?"

"Shocking. Last time Nathan called, you bolted in under thirty minutes."

"There’s porridge in the kitchen."

Sophia brightened, savoring a spoonful. "Nathan was lucky to have you..."

"Wash your bowl." Evelyn headed to her room.

"Really not going back?"

The door clicked shut in response.

Sophia smirked. "Progress..."

Meanwhile, at the riverside estate.

"Sir, the bank confirmed Miss Langley cashed the check at noon..."

Nathan hung up, staring through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Evelyn, what game are you playing now?"

Did she think this would win him back?

Pathetic.

"Dylan, let’s grab drinks."

Half an hour later, in the VIP lounge.

"Nathan! Finally." Dylan Lowell grinned, peering behind him. "Where’s Evelyn? Parking?"

Nathan’s expression darkened.
###Chapter 3

"Can't find the spot? I'll go out—"

Nathan Evans' words died in his throat.

He noticed Dylan Lowell's uneasy expression and belatedly swallowed hard. "Nathan, Evelyn hasn't... come back yet?"

A full day had passed.

Nathan spun his phone carelessly. "Did you think the breakup was a joke?"

He strode to the sofa without another word.

Dylan scratched his head. Was this for real?

Then again, it seemed impossible.

He'd believe Nathan could end things, but Evelyn Langley?

Everyone in their circle knew she was the last person who'd ever let go.

"Lost the bet, Nate?" Julian Roscente leaned against the bar, swirling his drink. "Three hours became twenty-four."

Nathan arched a brow. "I'll pay up."

"New rules today." Julian set down his glass. "Call Evelyn. Say 'I'm sorry, baby' in your sweetest voice."

The private room erupted in laughter.

Dylan snatched Nathan's phone and dialed Evelyn's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

Blocked?

Nathan's expression froze.

The laughter cut off abruptly as everyone exchanged glances.

Dylan forced a chuckle. "Must be bad reception. No way Evelyn blocked you—"

Julian's tone turned knowing. "Seems she's serious this time."

Nathan scoffed. "Since when are breakups pretend? Anyone mentions Evelyn again, don't blame me for losing my temper."

"Hope you won't regret it," Julian said quietly.

Nathan tugged at his tie, unbothered.

He never regretted anything.

At seven a.m., Sophia Laurent returned from her morning run to find their apartment filled with savory aromas.

Evelyn emerged from the kitchen carrying breakfast. Her newly styled hair—formerly long and straight—was now tied in a high ponytail. The houndstooth dress accentuated her slender legs.

"Shower and eat."

Sophia's eyes widened. "Dressed to kill. Is Nathan picking you up?"

"Can't you wish me well?"

"Him crawling back isn't 'well'?" Sophia reached for a bite, only to have her hand smacked away.

"Disgusting."

"Double standards! Nathan eats with his hands and you never complain."

"Next time, I'll hit him too."

By the time Sophia finished showering, Evelyn was already leaving with a thermal lunchbox.

"Tch. Says they broke up, yet still bringing her man lunch..."

Massachusetts General Hospital VIP Ward.

"Eleanor, feeling better today?"

Prof. Eleanor Roland set aside her research paper and adjusted her glasses. "Gregory? What brings you here?"

"Don't move." Prof. Gregory Hill steadied her. "Your incision hasn't healed."

"Just a minor procedure." Eleanor sighed. "Did this year's grad quotas come through?"

"You get three. I have four."

"Three..." she murmured.

"Only taking two again?"

"I'm too old for more."

Gregory shook his head helplessly. That third spot had always been reserved for one particular student.

"Professor Roland— Oh, Professor Hill too?" Ryan Clementson entered with a junior, placing a fruit basket on the table. "We came to visit."

During small talk, a student suddenly mentioned, "Heard there's an incoming freshman who landed a direct BS-to-PhD track."

"Double golds in Math and Computing Olympiads last year."

"That's nothing. Didn't Professor Roland have a student who entered with four international golds? Evelyn... Evelyn Langley—"

"It's getting late." Gregory abruptly stood. "You should head back to campus."

After the students left, Eleanor's hands began trembling. Tears spilled over.

"That genius... why would she waste her gift?"

Gregory murmured comforts.

"Last time we met, she said she wanted love..." Eleanor choked. "She broke my heart..."

Evelyn stood outside the door, knuckles whitening around the thermal container.

In the end, she couldn't bring herself to enter. Handing it to a nurse, she whispered, "Please give this to Professor Roland."

"Wait! Visitor log—"

Evelyn fled the ward like escaping demons, gulping fresh air in the courtyard.

"Evelyn Langley?"

An elegant voice called from behind.

Isabella Evans approached in stilettos, studying Evelyn's red-rimmed eyes.

"Why are you at the hospital instead of home?" She glanced at the inpatient building, relieved.

At least it wasn't OB-GYN.

"Isabella." Evelyn forced a smile.

"Those puffy eyes. Lover's quarrel?"

"We broke up."

Isabella's face softened with pity. She'd always liked Evelyn—just not enough for the Evans family standards.

"My brother's temperamental. Be patient with him."

"But we've already—"

"Sorry, I'm in a rush." Isabella checked her watch, striding toward the hospital.

Today's visit was strictly business. That direct PhD admission? She intended to claim it.
###Chapter 4

Dylan Lowell had refused to call it a night, dragging them to another round of drinks.

By the time Nathan Evans was driven home, dawn was breaking in the east.

He stumbled into the shower, barely conscious, scrubbing off the alcohol.

At least Evelyn wouldn't complain about the smell.

That was his last coherent thought before passing out.

A sharp pain in his gut yanked him from sleep.

"Damn it..." He curled into a ball, sweat soaking his back.

"Ev—"

The name died on his lips.

Nathan's mouth twisted into a bitter smirk.

She'd grown a spine.

Fine. Let's see how long her defiance lasts.

Where were the meds?

Ten minutes of rummaging through the living room yielded nothing.

"Master Nathan, the medicine is in the walk-in closet," Mrs. Watson explained over the phone. "Miss Langley put it there. Said you'd need it after drinking..."

He hung up and found five neatly stacked boxes of antacids in the back of the drawer.

The pain eased after swallowing the pills.

As he shut the drawer, his body went rigid.

All her jewelry remained untouched. Only her identification documents were missing.

The pink suitcase in the corner had vanished too.

"Perfect... just perfect."

His knuckles whitened as he ground his teeth.

This is what happens when you spoil a woman.

The more you indulge them, the more they take liberties.

The front door clicked open downstairs. He took the steps three at a time.

"Bro?" Isabella Evans blinked at him. "Who else were you expecting?"

"What do you want?" Nathan slumped onto the couch, voice flat.

"Mom sent me to check on you." She breezed past him toward the kitchen. "And mooch some food."

Thirty seconds later, a shriek echoed from the kitchen.

"Where's Evelyn? She didn't cook today?"

Nathan's temple throbbed.

"I saw her at Mass General yesterday. She looked terrible..." Isabella muttered.

"Hospital?" Nathan shot upright.

"Yeah. Oh, by the way, Professor Roland approved my direct PhD admission!"

"Why was she there?"

"How should I know?" She rolled her eyes. "Her entire world revolves around you. What friends does she even have?"

"Are you done?"

"Two p.m. tomorrow. West End Bistro. Mom's latest setup." Isabella called while slipping on her shoes. "Don't forget!"

Nathan didn't bother watching her leave.

The family had been throwing eligible women at him for years. Just another obligatory date.

It's not like keeping Evelyn interfered with these charades.

By the time he cleared his backlog in the study, night had fallen.

When he'd stubbornly refused family money to start his business, only Evelyn had endured those three brutal years with him.

Now that his company thrived, his parents had softened, turning a blind eye to her presence.

His empty stomach forced him to abandon work.

"Babe, I'm in class..." Chloe Valentine whispered on the phone.

Nathan hung up.

Five minutes later, the doorbell rang.

"I got the address from Julian." Chloe batted her lashes. "You scared me when you hung up."

She bounced inside, glancing around.

"Can you make nourishing porridge?" Nathan asked abruptly.

"Huh? I can learn!"

......

After sending Chloe away, Nathan finally met Dylan.

At a red light, Isabella's words resurfaced. He opened his messages.

[You are no longer friends with this contact...]

The crimson notification burned his retinas.
###Chapter 5

"Did Nathan take the wrong pills today?"

Dylan Lowell stole a glance at the man chugging alcohol in the corner, inching closer to Julian Roscente.

Nathan Evans' expression had been stormy since they arrived.

The laughter in the VIP room instantly quieted.

"Someone got blocked," Julian swirled his glass, deliberately raising his voice.

Nathan's gaze turned icy as daggers.

Thud—

His glass slammed onto the table. He yanked open two shirt buttons, revealing sharp collarbones.

"Say her name again. I dare you."

Julian wisely shut his mouth.

The room fell silent. Even the background music cut off.

Dylan choked on his drink. Had Evelyn Langley really gone this far?

Ethan Winston, tipsy, leaned in. "Did Evelyn reply?"

Dylan shook his head frantically. No way he'd tell the truth.

A waiter brought fresh drinks. Someone bravely suggested, "Truth or dare?"

The group caught on immediately, egging them on.

"Dare's more fun!"

The door burst open.

"Perfect timing, Vivian! Nathan needs company—"

The club's top hostess was pushed toward Nathan.

"Mr. Evans..."

Nathan stood abruptly, face dark. "Enjoy yourselves."

He left behind stunned silence and Vivian's disappointed pout.

......

Inside the black Maybach, the driver asked carefully, "Back to the estate, sir?"

Alcohol throbbed at his temples.

The thought of an empty bedroom made him snap, "To the office."

"Mr. Evans? You're—"

His assistant, clutching files, nearly collided with Nathan stepping off the elevator.

The CEO at headquarters this late? Unheard of.

Normally by now, Evelyn would've nagged him to rest. If he refused, she'd cling to him with playful whines until she won.

"Leaving already?"

"Urgent matter, sir?"

A sudden stomach pang made him grimace. "Get me congee."

He paused. "From that Michelin place in West End."

The assistant returned in twenty minutes with an exquisite takeout box.

Nathan's expression darkened further when he lifted the lid.

"Why abalone congee?"

"You praised it last time—"

"Get out."

The congee was exquisite. He set down his spoon after two bites.

Suddenly, he missed that simple bowl of millet porridge...

"Damn it!"

His fist smashed the desk.

......

Rain fell during Evelyn's return from the hospital.

Fumbling in the dark, she unlocked her apartment door—and froze at the sound of heavy breathing.

Light flooded the room, exposing Sophia Laurent straddling a younger man on the couch. Her black lace slip rode up her thighs as his hands disappeared beneath the silk.

"Evelyn?"

Sophia blinked against the light, lips still glistening.

"Don't mind me."

Evelyn spun around.

Time to find a new place.

Sophia lazily adjusted a slipped strap, tossing the boy his T-shirt.

"Wait for me in bed, darling."

The boy grinned at Evelyn. "Hey, sis."

"Hi, Kevin."

"Steven this time," Sophia corrected, swirling her wine.

Evelyn: "..."

"Your eyes are red." Sophia suddenly leaned close. "Saw Professor Roland?"

The warm mug burned Evelyn's palms.

"Went to the hospital."

Sophia's expression turned complex. Professor Eleanor Roland had broken protocol to mentor an undergrad, even chairing her thesis defense.

Most would kill for that chance. Evelyn walked away without hesitation.

"How is she?"

"Didn't go in."

Sophia snorted. "Coward!"

Evelyn's grip tightened.

So the supplements this morning were for the professor.

"How long will you hide?"

"Can't avoid it forever." Evelyn met her gaze. "Come with me tomorrow?"

Sophia's glass paused. "What are you planning?"
###Chapter 6

"I owe her an apology for my impulsive actions back then."

Sophia Laurent choked on her red wine, coughing as she patted her chest. "Please, spare me."

"Professor Roland's class was the only elective I ever failed in college. Just seeing her makes my legs weak. Besides, she's mentored so many students—why would she remember someone like me?"

Evelyn Langley pressed her lips together but didn't push further.

Sophia's eyes suddenly lit up. "I know the perfect person."

"Oh?"

"My cousin, Adrian Klein. Remember him?"

Evelyn's fingers traced the rim of her glass as she nodded.

Adrian Klein—the youngest leading figure in the field of physics. Last year, his work was named one of Science magazine's top ten breakthrough discoveries.

Back when he studied biology under Professor Roland, he published five papers in top-tier journals within two years, earning the title of "prodigy." His sudden switch to physics later stunned the academic world.

Talent, it seemed, thrived anywhere.

Evelyn had heard stories about this legendary senior when she first enrolled. It wasn’t until she met Sophia that she learned they were cousins.

"He actually asked about the professor’s condition recently. Perfect timing for you two to visit together."

Sophia dialed the number without hesitation.

A deep male voice answered. "Speak."

The faint hum of machinery buzzed in the background.

Sophia quickly explained the situation.

"Tomorrow. Two p.m. Westshore Restaurant." The call ended just as abruptly as it began.

Sophia winked at Evelyn. "Done!"

The next afternoon.

Evelyn arrived twenty minutes early.

She checked her watch as she pushed open the door—exactly two o'clock.

A waiter guided her through the hallway. By the floor-to-ceiling windows, a man was reviewing documents.

His white sleeves were rolled to his elbows, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his sharp nose. Sunlight scattered flecks of gold across his chiseled profile.

Evelyn glanced down at her white tee and jeans, suddenly feeling underdressed.

Sensing her presence, he looked up.

"Sit."

His voice was rich and smooth, like a cello’s lowest note.

Evelyn took the seat across from him. "Sorry, have you been waiting long?"

Adrian closed the folder. "Just arrived."

He slid the menu toward her. "What would you like to drink?"

"Lemon water, please."

Once the waiter left, Adrian cut straight to the point. "What do you need me to do for this visit?"

His directness was refreshing.

Evelyn absently traced the condensation on her glass. "I’d like you to accompany me. If the professor gets upset..."

She paused. "I might need your help smoothing things over."

A flicker of amusement passed behind his glasses.

"You pick the time," Evelyn added.

"Day after tomorrow." Adrian checked his watch. "I have twenty minutes."

Evelyn suddenly asked, "Why are you willing to help me?"

Adrian studied her for a long moment.

"Because you’re Evelyn Langley."

"Professor Roland once said she had three regrets in life." His tone was even. "Unfinished research, no children, and—you."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms.

This was her first time meeting Adrian, yet she recognized the same quiet disappointment in his eyes.

She could picture it—the professor mentioning her name with that exasperated, if only expression.

Adrian pulled out a notepad and wrote down a number.

His handwriting was precise, almost typed.

......

"Your tiramisu, sir."

The server set down the dessert, sneaking a glance at the table’s occupants.

The man’s striking features were edged with impatience, his fingers tapping the table in a steady rhythm. Across from him, a young woman in a Chanel suit chattered nonstop:

"Nathan, I know this amazing Michelin place—"

Nathan Evans flicked his lighter open, then froze.

Through the foliage, Evelyn was laughing with another man.

A cold smirk curled his lips.

"I have business to attend to."

Adrian checked the time and stood to leave.

At the door, he held it open for Evelyn with effortless grace.

"Thank you." She smiled.

As his car pulled away, Evelyn turned—and locked eyes with a glacial stare.

Nathan leaned against a pillar, frost in his gaze.

"Found a new target already?"
###Chapter 7

Nathan Evans paused for a few seconds when his gaze landed on Evelyn Langley.

Her signature wavy curls were gone, replaced by straight black hair. The burgundy highlights he once adored had been dyed back to pure black.

No makeup—not even the most basic foundation.

A plain white T-shirt, jeans, and flats.

Only her eyes remained, brighter and more vivid than before, showing no trace of heartbreak.

If this was an act, she was terrifyingly convincing.

So convincing it inexplicably pissed him off.

Evelyn noticed the shift in his expression and frowned. She knew that look too well—the calm before the storm.

"Hah," Nathan sneered. "After all these years by my side, your taste is still this bad? You’d stoop to any random guy? What does that say about me, your ex?"

"Your reputation?" Evelyn let out a soft laugh, a flicker of bitterness in her eyes.

Nathan missed it.

All he could picture was Evelyn smiling at another man, and the thought made his blood boil.

He chalked it up to primal male possessiveness.

Even something he’d discarded wasn’t up for grabs.

"I have things to do. I should go." Evelyn turned to leave.

"Go?" Nathan mocked. "Where else would you go besides Sophia Laurent’s place? At least you’ve learned to take your documents this time. What, is this for real now?"

The words stung.

She should’ve been used to his cruelty, yet it still hurt every time.

Did he really think she was just throwing a tantrum?

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn replied calmly, "First, Mr. Laurent and I are just friends. Second, we’re broken up. Your opinion doesn’t matter to me anymore."

Right on cue, her ride arrived.

"Drive, please," she said quickly, slipping into the car.

Nathan watched the taxi disappear, his expression dark.

Three months ago, she’d pulled the same move during their fight.

Now she’d brought a man to provoke him? Who gave her the audacity?

"Nathan~" Lily Anderson cooed, pressing against him. "Why’d you leave me like that?"

The overpowering perfume made him grimace, but he didn’t push her away. Instead, he wrapped an arm around her waist. "What? Want to come with me?"

If she could parade a man around, why couldn’t he?

In the car—

Evelyn glanced in the rearview mirror at the intimate pair, her lips curling into a self-deprecating smile.

So it wasn’t just Chloe Valentine...

Six years of her youth, wasted.

Then, in the mirror, Nathan abruptly shoved Lily aside and walked off without a backward glance.

"Nathan Evans! Stop right there!" Lily stomped her foot in frustration.

The moment Nathan got into his car, he dialed Isabella Evans.

"Bro? Aren’t you on a date?"

"Did you tell Evelyn about today?" Nathan seethed. "Mom forces me into this blind date, and instead of covering for me, you tip her off so she can bring some guy to piss me off? Are you out of your mind?"

Isabella was baffled. "What are you talking about? When did I—"

The call ended abruptly.

Isabella stared at her phone, bewildered. "What did I do?"

The butler approached with a gift list. "Miss, are these sufficient?"

She skimmed it. "These are for Professor Eleanor Roland. Make sure everything’s perfect."

......

"Miss Langley, this is hands down the best rental near Harvard! Great lighting, quiet neighborhood—there’s a waiting list!" The agent gushed.

Evelyn inspected the two-bedroom apartment.

Old building. No elevator. Dated decor.

But it was close to campus, near the library, and convenient.

Most importantly, it was flooded with sunlight.

"I’ll take it." She signed a one-year lease without hesitation.

Back at Sophia’s place, her suitcase lay open on the floor.

"Moving out?" Sophia arched a brow.

"Yeah, found a place." Evelyn continued packing.

Sophia smirked. "Nathan tracked you down? A whole week this time—progress! Serves those arrogant men right..."

Evelyn stopped and met her friend’s gaze. "Vivi, this is it. I’m not going back."

Sophia froze. This time, she believed her.

For six years, she’d watched Evelyn sand herself down for Nathan, dimming her own light.

"Good riddance! Should’ve done this ages ago! Decent men aren’t that hard to find!"

"Yeah." Evelyn nodded.

"You’re... not gonna change your mind in two days, right?" Sophia eyed her skeptically.

Evelyn laughed.

Before moving, she stopped by the hardware store for eco-friendly paint.

The old apartment’s walls were peeling, the furniture worn.

A fresh coat of paint might help her start fresh.

"Thanks, sir." The cab driver helped unload the cans.

Evelyn craned her neck to look up at the seventh floor and took a deep breath.

Trip after trip, she hauled the paint upstairs, panting by the end.

After a short break and a splash of water on her face, she picked up a brush and eyed the wall.

Rolling up her sleeves, she got to work.
###Chapter 8

Evelyn Langley hadn't done manual labor like this in years.

During her time with Nathan Evans, she'd barely lifted a finger.

Even during his early startup days when money was tight, they'd always hired an hourly maid for cleaning.

Finishing the last bucket of paint, Evelyn rubbed her aching lower back.

Years of comfortable living had made her soft...

She stepped into the hallway to fetch more paint supplies.

Her foot accidentally knocked over a paint can near the neighbor's door.

Though she caught it quickly, some paint still spilled.

As she frantically mopped the mess, the previously closed door swung open.

Their eyes met. Both froze mid-apology.

"You live here?"

"What a coincidence?"

Adrian Klein glanced at the paint stains, then at the supplies behind her.

"You're the one moving in today?"

Evelyn hadn't expected this either. "Looks like we'll be neighbors."

A flicker of surprise crossed Adrian's eyes.

He'd chosen this modest walk-up for its proximity to the lab and campus.

But the lack of elevators and basic amenities made it unsuitable for a woman living alone.

Noticing her still cleaning, Adrian turned back inside.

"Wait a moment."

He returned with a folding ladder. "This will make painting easier."

"Thank you."

With proper equipment, the work progressed quickly.

By noon, the dingy walls looked fresh and bright.

That afternoon, she visited the furniture store for a sofa, table, and chairs.

The transformed space now glowed with warmth.

Golden lamplight illuminated sun-dried linens.

Lush greenery thrived on the windowsill. Plush throw pillows adorned the lounge chair.

Though compact, every corner radiated cozy charm.

"Nice job with the place," Sophia Laurent remarked during their video call.

"Still the interior design queen from our dorm days."

Evelyn smiled. "Home should feel special."

"You're handling this better than I expected." Sophia hesitated.

"Starting over... it's good."

After hanging up, Evelyn gazed out the window.

At least it wasn't too late.

By six, hunger pangs reminded Evelyn to check the fridge.

She quickly prepared sandwiches and millet congee from the bread, vegetables, and grains.

Returning the ladder, she brought Adrian a portion.

He'd been editing research data in his study when the knock interrupted.

"Thanks for the ladder. I made extra dinner."

Her eyes sparkled in the hallway light.

Adrian accepted the container with thanks and resumed work.

Hunger finally struck at eight.

As he reached for his phone to order takeout, his gaze landed on the untouched meal.

The thermal layer kept everything warm.

Crispy bacon and perfectly cooked eggs filled the sandwich.

The congee offered comforting smoothness.

His brow relaxed—a rare sign of satisfaction.

The flavors... surpassed expectations.

At ten, returning from his nightly run, Adrian spotted Evelyn collecting a package at the complex entrance.

Her signature topknot made her easy to spot in the crowd.

"Evening stroll?"

"Just finished running?"

They spoke simultaneously.

Evelyn lifted the parcel. "Grabbed a delivery."

"The dinner was excellent. Thank you."

"I should be thanking you."

Children's laughter drifted from the nearby park.

"It's lively here."

Compared to the Evans mansion's tomb-like silence, this place brimmed with life.

Adrian followed her gaze.

After two months here, he'd never noticed before.

"Just got word—Professor Roland will be home tomorrow."

A pause.

"I'm going at ten. Would you like to join?"

"Tomorrow?"

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

Nervousness crept in as the moment approached.

"Problem?"

"No."

Adrian noted her tension but didn't pry.

Privacy wasn't his to invade.

That night, sleep eluded Evelyn.

Rain pattered against the window by dawn.

She rose early to prepare.

At precisely ten, knocking sounded at her door.

She opened it immediately, fully ready.

Adrian blinked at her promptness. "Let's go."
###Chapter 9

Evelyn walked ahead with Adrian following at a leisurely pace behind her.

Gone was the nervousness from last night—she had regained her usual composure.

A black sedan pulled up slowly. Evelyn opened the door and slid inside.

Passing a fruit stand, she suddenly spoke up: "Could we stop? I'd like to buy some fruit."

"Fruit?"

"For Professor Roland."

Adrian's slender fingers rested on the steering wheel as he frowned slightly. "Is that necessary?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Do you usually visit elders empty-handed?"

He nodded frankly.

She couldn't help laughing. "Impressive."

Apparently successful people didn't bother with such trivialities.

Despite her remark, the car still pulled over smoothly.

......

Professor Roland's residence was in the hillside villa district near Harvard.

European-style houses nestled among lush greenery blended classical elegance with modern touches.

After passing through a fiery red maple grove, the estate came into view.

Six years...

Evelyn tightened her grip on the seatbelt, eyeing the fruit basket at her feet with sudden hesitation.

Adrian glanced sideways. "Not getting out?"

She bit her lower lip. "I need another minute."

The man studied her for two seconds before nodding. "I'll go in first then."

"......"

She appreciated his thoughtfulness.

Once Adrian was out of sight, she took a deep breath and opened the car door.

The early summer garden bloomed with vibrant flowers.

A breeze carried faint floral scents. The neglected vegetable patch by the fence looked somewhat wilted.

Before reaching the entrance, she heard the professor's familiar voice. Her heart skipped a beat as she quickened her pace.

"Professor."

Eleanor set down her academic journal and adjusted her reading glasses. "Adrian? What brings you here?"

He stepped forward to support her arm. "Just checking on you. Feeling better?"

"Just minor ailments. You're all overreacting."

She patted his hand. "I'm perfectly fine, no need to worry!"

Adrian paused. "I brought someone with me today."

"Who?" Eleanor looked up in confusion.

Following his gaze, she saw Evelyn hovering awkwardly in the foyer like a chastened child.

Eleanor's pupils contracted. She instinctively took two steps forward before schooling her expression into sternness.

"What are you doing here?" Her tone was icy.

"Professor..."

Evelyn fidgeted helplessly.

Eleanor said coldly, "Who was it that swore six years ago she'd abandon her studies for love? Why come back now?"

Evelyn's eyes reddened. "I'm sorry I disappointed you."

"And?" Eleanor rarely spoke so harshly.

Her voice choked. "I was wrong."

After a beat, she whispered, "Is it... too late?"

"Finally..." Eleanor exhaled deeply, her expression softening. "Do you know how long I've waited?"

"Six whole years."

Tears streamed down Evelyn's face. "I didn't realize..." Had her professor really been waiting for her return all this time?

"Better late than never."

Seeing Evelyn's haggard appearance, Eleanor's eyes filled with tenderness.

Evelyn could no longer hold back, throwing herself into the older woman's arms. "Professor..."

Warm hands patted her back as Eleanor's voice gentled. "There now, a grown woman crying like this—people will laugh at you."

Adrian stood quietly aside. Seeing them reconciled, he discreetly retreated to the balcony to give them space.

During their reunion, Eleanor inquired about Evelyn's life while carefully avoiding romantic topics.

That Evelyn could say "I was wrong" proved her past choices had been mistakes.

Why reopen old wounds?

"...I rented an apartment near campus. I'm reviewing materials to apply for your graduate program..."

Eleanor's eyes lit up, her voice trembling with excitement. "Really? You're not joking?"

She even double-checked.

"Yes." Evelyn hung her head in shame.

The opportunity she'd once tossed aside now required starting from scratch...

"Wonderful! It's about time! I've been saving a spot for you—finally it won't go to waste..."

Evelyn looked up in shock.

Though she'd suspected, hearing her professor had reserved a position was still unbelievable.

Evelyn Langley, how could you possibly deserve this...

"Professor, I might not qualify. You shouldn't—" get your hopes up.

Eleanor cut her off firmly. "With your abilities, you'll get in if you truly want to! Unless you deliberately fail to mock this old woman!"

"Of course not..." Evelyn laughed through her tears.

"It's getting late. You and Adrian should... Hmm? Where's Adrian?"

"Professor." He reentered from the balcony.

"Stay for dinner! I'll cook!"

Evelyn's expression changed instantly. Adrian also looked subtly uncomfortable.

"Um... You should rest. Let me handle dinner."

It wasn't ingratitude—the professor's cooking was legendary for all the wrong reasons.

Eleanor coughed awkwardly, saving face. "Ahem... Right, I'm still recovering. Probably shouldn't overexert..."

Evelyn efficiently tied on an apron and disappeared into the kitchen.

Adrian rolled up his sleeves and followed. "I'll help."

Watching their retreating figures, Eleanor's eyes sparkled with knowing amusement.

The fridge was well-stocked with fresh ingredients.

Considering the professor's recent hospitalization, Evelyn opted for light dishes.

Adrian asked, "What should I do?"

She glanced at the sink. "Can you wash vegetables?"

"Shouldn't be difficult."

She moved aside.

Though clumsy, the man washed each leaf with meticulous care.

Evelyn asked casually, "Any dietary restrictions?"

"None."

"Preferences?"

"Anything's fine."

"...You're easy to please," she muttered under her breath.

Unlike someone else who was picky and high-maintenance.
###Chapter 10

Adrian Klein remained silent.

For him, food was merely sustenance—taste had never been a consideration.

"Done washing."

Evelyn Langley glanced at the ingredients on the counter. Red peppers and bok choy were arranged in two perfectly aligned rows, spaced with mathematical precision. Even the most obsessive perfectionist would be impressed.

"What's funny?" Adrian frowned.

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Nothing. You can go wait outside."

"Hmm." Adrian dried his hands with a towel and gave a slight nod.

Dinner consisted of light dishes Evelyn prepared specifically for Prof. Eleanor Roland's dietary needs.

"You remembered..." The elderly professor's eyes grew moist.

After the meal, Evelyn began clearing the table.

Adrian wordlessly followed her into the kitchen to help.

Under the warm yellow light, his tall silhouette stretched across the floor.

From Evelyn's angle, his chiseled profile looked like a classical sculpture—his razor-sharp jawline could cut glass.

Eleanor leaned against the doorframe. "Mianmian, how did you and Adrian meet?"

Adrian was her most brilliant protégé, while Evelyn was her favorite student. She'd long wanted to introduce them.

Yet somehow, they'd crossed paths on their own.

"Professor, you have a visitor!"

A voice called from the living room.

Eleanor turned to see a girl rising from the sofa—

"Hello Professor, I'm Isabella Evans. We met at the hospital about the graduate program admissions."

Eleanor nodded. "I remember. Have a seat."

Isabella's smile widened. "I heard you were recuperating at home, so I brought some tonics..."

Eleanor's gaze swept over the gift boxes on the coffee table—ginseng, bird's nest, cordyceps...

Her smile cooled slightly.

Isabella pressed on. "About this year's admission quota—"

Eleanor cut her off. "Your kindness is noted, but please take these back. Graduate admissions are merit-based."

Isabella froze.

At the hospital, the professor had said "there's a chance" and "you could try"...

"Professor, I—"

"Miss Evans, I have other guests. Walter, please help carry these to her car."

The dismissal couldn't be clearer.

Isabella stumbled out in a daze and nearly collided with someone.

"Evelyn Langley?" Her eyes widened. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn wore a white T-shirt and an outdated apron, holding a trash bag.

"What a coincidence." Evelyn seemed equally surprised but smiled politely.

She neither liked nor disliked Isabella. The pampered heiress was spoiled but at least knew basic manners.

"You..." Isabella looked her up and down. "Working as an hourly maid?"

Evelyn: "?"

"Did my brother not give you money?"

"??"

"Oh my God! This is humiliating!" Isabella stormed out in her heels, already dialing her phone.

Her outrage wasn't for Evelyn's sake—she simply found her brother's behavior appalling!

Like dining at a Michelin restaurant and leaving no tip!

"Hey—Nathan! We need to talk—"

The call connected just as she began her tirade.

"Busy. Not in the mood for your drama."

"Who's being dramatic? You're the one who's gone too far! Stingy men are as disgusting as rats!"

"Take your tantrums elsewhere." What nonsense.

Isabella barreled on. "Evelyn cooks, cleans and sleeps with you, and you won't pay her? Forcing her to work as a maid? How will this look when word gets out?"

Dead silence on the other end. "...Who did you say?"

"Evelyn Langley."

"Hourly maid... What do you mean?"

Isabella spilled everything she'd witnessed: "...This time you've really crossed the line. Even lapdogs deserve basic—"

Nathan Evans stopped listening.

Three words echoed in his mind: Evelyn. Maid. Money.

So she'd cashed that $50M check but didn't dare use it.

He loosened his tie, eyes darkening.

Hah. She'd walked away so decisively—he'd almost believed she had principles. Turns out...

Without him, she couldn't even survive.

"Nathan, your turn."

Ethan Winston tapped the dice cup.

"I'm out."

Nathan grabbed his suit jacket and car keys.

"You organized this gathering," Ethan said, bewildered.

"Something came up."

She should be calling any minute now, begging him to pick her up...

......

Nathan waited in his car. Work calls and messages came—but not the one he wanted.

He drove straight to Sophia Laurent's apartment.

Evelyn had no family in the city. Every time they fought, she fled to Sophia's place. He knew the route by heart.

"Nathan Evans?"

A voice called as he stepped out of his car. Nathan turned to see Sophia arm-in-arm with a younger man heading home.

"What are you doing here?" Sophia's gaze turned wary.

"Where's Evelyn?"

"None of your business."

"I asked where Evelyn is." His tone sharpened.

Nathan had always disapproved of Sophia's wild lifestyle and often warned Evelyn to keep her distance.

Yet this was the one thing Evelyn stubbornly refused.

Sophia smirked. "Newsflash—you broke up. What's your claim on her now?"

Nathan scoffed. "How many times have we 'broken up'? Lost count?"

"So?"

"Don't waste your time playing villain."

Evelyn always came crawling back to him eventually.

Sophia laughed bitterly. "To you, Evelyn's worth less than a dog? At your beck and call?"

Nathan wasn't in the mood for debate. "Tell me or I'll search the place myself."

Sophia's boy-toy blocked his path. "Sir, breaking and entering is illegal."

Nathan ignored him, locking eyes with Sophia. "Fine. Remember this. But it won't matter—she'll still come begging like a dog in the end."
###Chapter 11

Nathan Evans finished speaking and immediately got into his car. The engine roared as he sped away.

Sophia Laurent stomped her feet in frustration. "Jerk! Trash! That bastard!"

She grabbed the young man's collar. "If Evelyn takes him back this time, I'm cutting ties with her!"

The young man nodded hastily. "Right, right. Don't be angry..."

But deep down, he knew that man's confident demeanor wasn't so simple.

He stole a glance at the fuming Sophia. If only she could be as devoted as her best friend...

He quickly dismissed the thought.

Not even worth dreaming about.

...

Inside the black Maybach, Nathan's phone rang.

His tone was icy. "Speak."

"Nathan, I found this amazing seafood restaurant. Want to try it tomorrow?" Chloe Valentine's sweet voice came through the receiver.

She had deliberately chosen his favorite seafood and picked a weekend.

From last night until now, Nathan hadn't contacted her, leaving her restless.

Before, he would always initiate their plans, and she'd play hard to get.

But things were different now.

His replies grew shorter, sometimes nonexistent.

When asked, he'd just say he was busy.

"Not interested," Nathan flatly refused.

"What about Sunday—" Chloe's fingers turned white from gripping the phone.

"Goodbye." The call ended mercilessly.

Chloe stared at the darkened screen, her heart pounding as if she couldn't breathe.

No. She had fought too hard to become his official girlfriend. She couldn't lose now...

...

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Adrian Klein and Evelyn Langley bid farewell to Professor Eleanor Roland.

"Leaving so soon?" The elderly woman was reluctant. "Stay for dinner."

Adrian shook his head. "There's lab data to process."

Evelyn said softly, "We'll visit again soon."

"Promise?" The professor turned to Evelyn. "Don't forget the materials and books on the table."

They were her research notes and unfinished thesis from grad school.

Evelyn's eyes grew warm. "Professor..."

"Enough. Go." The old woman feigned sternness. "The lunchbox is washed. Next time, don't leave it secretly at the door."

Evelyn's ears burned. "Understood..."

On the way back, Evelyn tactfully got out at Harvard's entrance.

Adrian nodded. "Stay safe."

...

From a distance, Nathan spotted a figure by his villa's gate, his pulse quickening.

But when he recognized who it was, his heart sank heavily.

"Chloe."

"Nathan!" The girl stood up excitedly, her eyes sparkling.

"Why are you here?"

"Waiting for you." Chloe spoke timidly. "You said you were busy earlier, so I waited. Am I bothering you?"

Nathan shook his head. "No."

"Great!" Her smile brightened before faltering. "I'm hungry..."

"Let's eat."

Chloe cheered.

At the upscale restaurant, Nathan barely touched his food while Chloe ate happily.

Sensing his mood, she wisely kept quiet.

"Done?"

"Mhm!"

"I'll take you back to campus."

Chloe hesitated before getting out. "Aren't you walking me in?"

After a pause, Nathan replied, "Fine."

The entrance of MIT buzzed with students.

The sight of the campus belle with a distinguished man drew countless stares.

Chloe lifted her chin proudly. "When will you meet my roommates? They're so curious about you."

Now she could finally flaunt her boyfriend openly.

Nathan didn't respond.

Chloe continued smiling. "Every second with you is pure happiness."

Suddenly, she rose onto her toes and kissed him in full view of everyone.

Gasps erupted around them.

"The campus belle really has a boyfriend!"

"They look perfect together!"

"So sweet!"

At the back of the crowd, Evelyn froze.

Talk about bad luck.

For a fleeting moment, Nathan saw the girl from graduation day.

Her radiant smile echoed in his mind: "Nathan Evans, I choose you. No regrets."

The long-buried memory flared to life, stinging his nerves.

He stepped back abruptly. "Go inside."

Chloe blinked. "Nathan?"

"It's late." He turned and walked away.
###Chapter 12

"No." Chloe Valentine shook her head, her cheeks flushing pink as she rose on tiptoes. "I want to stay with you longer."

Nathan Evans gripped her waist and kissed her without hesitation.

Gasps erupted around them.

"Holy shit! That's bold!"

"So sweet!"

Evelyn Langley stood at the crowd's edge, her knuckles whitening from clenched fists.

Her heart felt scraped by a dull blade, yet strangely calm.

She turned and walked away, her retreating figure resolute.

Quitting cigarettes causes withdrawal—how much worse for someone loved six years?

Nathan glanced back as if sensing something.

A familiar silhouette vanished around the corner.

Chloe hooked her fingers through his. "What are you looking at?"

"Nothing." He turned away.

Beneath the dormitory lights, Chloe clung to his sleeve.

"Stay a little longer?"

Nathan ruffled her hair. "I'll pick you up this weekend."

Streetlights carved sharp shadows across his angular features.

Chloe's eyes gleamed. "Nathan... can I come to your place tonight?"

His gaze darkened. "You're too young."

The answer sent warmth through her chest.

He truly cherished her.

"I should go." Nathan checked his watch, his expression distant as he turned.

——

Evelyn sat before her computer, fingers hovering over the keyboard.

That image wouldn't leave her mind.

She rushed to the bathroom, splashing icy water on her face.

After composing herself, she opened Professor Eleanor Roland's materials—a textbook, annotated notes, and her unfinished thesis.

Countless all-nighters in the lab had been sacrificed for this paper.

After abandoning grad school, she'd clung to two things:

Caring for Nathan.

And perfecting this research.

Merging the documents felt like reassembling her shattered self.

Before dawn, she submitted the paper to Science.

Not for recognition—just closure.

At 8 AM sharp, she left her apartment.

In the hallway, she encountered Adrian Klein returning home.

Raindrops glistened on his shoulders, his umbrella dripping.

"All-night experiment?"

"Urgent data."

Evelyn handed him warm milk. "Don't catch cold."

Adrian blinked. "Thanks."

Outside the library, Isabella Evans' voice cut through the air.

"Evelyn? More part-time work?"

Beside her stood Margaret Evans, regal in her Hermès Kelly bag's metallic gleam.

"Miss Langley," Margaret smiled coolly, "this 'chance encounter' act is rather transparent."

Her gaze swept over Evelyn's simple attire, oozing disdain.

"Nathan will marry someone of his station. As for you..."

A deliberate pause.

"Know your place if you want to keep it."
###Chapter 13

Margaret Evans took a graceful sip of coffee, her manicured fingers tapping lightly on the table.

"Evelyn, in elite marriages, it's perfectly normal for men to have mistresses. As long as the wife's position remains secure, nothing else matters."

Today's meeting was specifically arranged to educate her future daughter-in-law.

Evelyn Langley responded with a cold laugh, setting her cup down sharply.

"Mrs. Evans, I appreciate your 'concern.' But Nathan and I have already broken up. Let's pretend we don't know each other from now on."

Margaret's face darkened instantly.

Evelyn had tolerated her future mother-in-law's harsh treatment for Nathan's sake. Now that she'd discarded Nathan himself, why would she care about his mother?

"One more thing," Evelyn turned back before leaving, "I'd advise against speaking so maliciously in the future."

"Someone might punch you."

She dropped this casual remark before walking into the Harvard library.

Margaret trembled with rage. "Who does she think she is?!"

Isabella Evans quickly steadied her mother. "Mom, did she really break up with Nathan?"

"Don't be naive," Margaret scoffed.

Everyone knew Evelyn had been desperately in love with Nathan.

......

Inside Harvard's library, Evelyn randomly pulled a bioinformatics book from the shelf.

Adrian Klein's name stood out boldly on the cover.

Opening it, she found an elegant inscription: "All knowledge is interconnected, disciplines know no boundaries."

She couldn't help smiling.

Only that polymath genius could declare interdisciplinary research so matter-of-factly.

Her growling stomach startled her—lunchtime had long passed.

As she exited the library, Sophia Laurent's call came through.

"Nathan came looking for you yesterday!" The urgent voice crackled through the phone. "You didn't run into him, did you?"

"No." Evelyn's tone remained calm.

"Good. Listen, can you do me a favor tonight?"

......

Meanwhile, Margaret stormed into Evans Corporation headquarters.

"Did you see Evelyn's attitude?" She slammed the desk upon entering. "How dare she speak to me like that!"

Nathan frowned. "You met her at the library?"

"She claims you've broken up?" Margaret's eyes narrowed suddenly.

Nathan instinctively denied it. "Impossible."

"Exactly!" Margaret sneered. "A social climber like her would never let go of this golden opportunity."

Nathan loosened his tie irritably.

After ushering his mother out, he texted Dylan Lowell: Need gift ideas for Chloe's birthday.

They met at SKP Mall's jewelry section.

"This heart pendant necklace suits young women perfectly," the sales associate recommended enthusiastically.

Dylan suddenly gasped. "Evelyn?"

Evelyn was collecting Sophia's custom jewelry order. At the sound of her name, she turned.

Nathan's spine stiffened instantly.
###Chapter 14

"Another time. I have plans today."

Evelyn Langley declined Dylan Lowell's invitation with a practiced smile.

Dylan noticed the exquisite jewelry box in her hand and realized she genuinely had business to attend to.

He opened his mouth to say more, but Evelyn had already brushed past Nathan Evans without so much as a glance.

The air froze instantly.

Dylan stole a glance at Nathan's stormy expression and forced a conciliatory tone. "Nate, maybe she really didn't see you—"

Nathan's face darkened further.

Dylan wisely shut his mouth.

Internally, he marveled: Evelyn was playing hardball this time.

"Sir, would you like to continue browsing?"

Nathan's icy gaze lifted. "Of course. Bring out your most expensive pieces."

If she didn't want them, plenty of others would.

......

The standalone villa on Lakeview Drive blazed with light when Evelyn arrived, most guests already present.

Recognizing her, several attendees exchanged meaningful looks.

For six years, she'd attended countless such events as Nathan's plus-one.

To these people, she wasn't "Evelyn Langley"—just "Nathan Evans' woman."

A sparrow who'd flown too high.

Recent rumors of their breakup, compounded by her solo appearance tonight, seemed to confirm the gossip.

Curious eyes glittered with schadenfreude.

Had the ambitious sparrow finally fallen back to earth?

Six wasted years, ending in abandonment.

What delicious drama.

Ignoring the stares, Evelyn located Sophia Laurent and handed her the jewelry.

"Stay for a while? The chef's Michelin three-star."

"No. Drink less and get home safe."

Sophia didn't press—she knew these vultures too well. "I'll have my assistant drive you."

"Thanks." Evelyn turned to leave.

Whispers trailed her:

"Did you see? The audacity to show up!"

"Six years with Nathan Evans—she must've gotten something."

"That dress? My housekeeper wouldn't wear it."

"Heard she did his laundry and cooking—a glorified maid—"

"Miss Langley..." The assistant glanced at Evelyn worriedly.

Even he winced at the cruelty, yet she remained impassive.

"Let's go."

She'd anticipated this.

Leaving Nathan meant weathering these storms.

The assistant nodded. "Wait here. I'll bring the car."

Alone in the courtyard, Evelyn watched the sunset.

A breeze carried away the evening's stifling heat.

"Evelyn Langley?"

A tipsy male voice startled her.

She turned to meet deep-set eyes. "Long time no see."

Sebastian Sherwood swirled his wine glass, surprise flickering across his face. "Since graduation, actually. Nathan had me thrown out before I could give you flowers."

Evelyn stiffened.

Back then, Sebastian and Nathan's rivalry over her had bordered on obsession.

"I should go—"

Sebastian blocked her path. "He's kept you under lock and key for years. Seeing you was impossible."

Her smile cooled. "What do you want?"

"You chose him because he persisted. But did you ever consider his persistence was just about winning?"

The words struck like a blade.

Had the love she cherished been merely a game?

Noticing her pallor, Sebastian's expression softened.

He reached for her face. Evelyn stepped back.

"Boundaries, please."

He advanced. "Stop pretending. I know you two broke up."

"And?" She met his gaze.

"Be with me. I'll treat you better. Name anything—"

Six years later, she still took his breath away.

Evelyn laughed. "Jump from one cage to another? Mr. Sherwood, it was nice seeing you, but let's go our separate ways."

She walked away without looking back.

Nathan or Sebastian—she wanted neither.

And they'd do well to stay away.

Sebastian watched her retreating figure, eyes darkening.

"Evelyn," he murmured, "the wind never stops for the tree that seeks stillness. Do you really think you can escape?"

Nearby, someone observed the entire exchange.

Julian Roscente admired the photo he'd just taken, smirking.

Ethan Winston emerged for air and caught the expression.

"What's so amusing?"

Julian waved his phone triumphantly.

Ethan recognized the woman instantly. "Evelyn Langley?"

"With Sebastian Sherwood," Julian added. "Already sent to Nate."

They remembered the two men's past rivalry—Nathan's possessiveness had been terrifying.

Ethan studied the image. "Sebastian reappearing right after the breakup... And her reaction—"

He paused. "This time, she seems serious."

Julian scoffed. "She'll crawl back. Watch."

"Then why send the photo?"

"For fun. Drama's entertaining."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Don't play with fire."

"It's just a photo. How invested could Nate be in an ex?" Julian admired the composition. "Perfect framing—"

Ethan observed the woman's elegant profile. "You're right. An ex getting attention is normal..."
###Chapter 15

Assistant Liu parked the car at the residential complex entrance. Evelyn Langley thanked him but didn't head straight home, detouring instead to the fresh market on the street corner.

Golden sunset bathed the entire street as she emerged carrying two full grocery bags.

Adrian Klein appeared at the intersection. His crisp white shirt sleeves were rolled to the elbows, revealing well-defined forearms. The fading light softened his angular features, even warming the lenses of his glasses.

"Professor Klein." She initiated the greeting.

He adjusted his frames. "Ms. Langley."

"I bought hotpot ingredients. Care to join?" She lifted the shopping bags slightly.

Adrian almost declined when the memory of her cooking surfaced—the lingering umami of that simple noodle dish still vivid on his palate.

"Alright."

This marked Adrian's first time entering her apartment.

The modest living room exuded warmth. Hydrangeas bloomed by the floor-to-ceiling window while goldfish circled lazily in their tank. Half-finished floral tea sat beside scattered graduate school materials on the coffee table.

"Water or tea?"

"Water's fine."

She handed him a glass—the temperature perfectly tepid.

His gaze caught the exam papers with sparse red markings, nearly flawless.

"Question three is wrong."

Evelyn followed his line of sight. "The interdisciplinary one?"

"Mhm." Adrian picked up the sheet. "Potential selection alters the entire molecular dynamics calculation."

Her eyes brightened. "So variations in potential energy surfaces change molecular trajectories?"

His eyebrows lifted behind his glasses. "You understand molecular dynamics?"

"From your notes." She smiled sheepishly. "Despite some typos..."

Adrian's ears tinged pink. "Undergraduate drafts."

"But the logic was clear." Her sincerity shone through. "They helped immensely."

The aroma of simmering broth began permeating the space.

......

Nathan Evans exited the shopping center into full darkness.

His knuckles whitened around a navy velvet jewelry box.

"Dinner first?" Dylan Lowell eyed his tense profile.

"Whatever."

Dylan chose a Michelin-starred restaurant requiring reservations. Nathan barely registered the meal, his attention continually darting to the entrance.

The box rotated in his grip, its diamond necklace refracting icy brilliance under the chandeliers.
###Chapter 16

Dylan chose a private booth by the window on the second floor. The view was expansive, and the seclusion was perfect.

The waiter handed them the menu. Cantonese cuisine prized freshness, tenderness, and smooth textures—just the soups alone numbered over a dozen. Dylan flipped through the pages, his eyes glazing over at the options.

Nathan hadn’t spoken a word. His fingers kept spinning the lighter in restless circles.

"I heard the head chef here was brought in from Guangzhou. Anything you’re craving, Nathan?" Dylan broke the silence.

"Whatever." Nathan’s tone was icy.

His mood hadn’t improved since leaving the jewelry store. Evelyn’s deliberate indifference was a thorn lodged deep in his chest.

How dare she pretend not to know him?

She’d already moved out of Sophia’s place—why hadn’t she come back?

How long did she plan to keep this up?

Amid the swirl of cigarette smoke, he crushed the butt with sharp impatience.

Dylan ordered salted pork with bamboo shoots, duck braised with perilla leaves, sweet-and-sour pork with pineapple, and the signature seafood casserole.

The dishes arrived swiftly, their aromas rich and inviting. Dylan, ravenous, dug in immediately.

"Don’t overthink it, Nathan." His mouth full, he swallowed before adding cautiously, "Evelyn’s just upset right now. She’ll come around in a few days."

He hesitated. "But you did break up with her in front of everyone that day. That was kind of—"

"Shut it." Nathan’s glare was razor-sharp. "Who said I was thinking about her?"

Dylan wisely focused on his meal.

Then Nathan’s phone buzzed.

The moment he opened the message, his pupils constricted.

The photo showed Sebastian’s hand inches from Evelyn’s face.

Bang!

He slammed the phone onto the table.

Dylan jumped, his chopsticks clattering. "What’s wrong?"

"So this is what you meant by ‘coming around’?" Nathan’s voice was glacial. "She’s already lining up her next option."

Dylan glimpsed the photo and sucked in a sharp breath.

Sebastian, that bastard, had chosen the perfect moment to make his move.

Nathan smirked darkly. "If this is the caliber of men she’s settling for without me, she’s even more pathetic than I thought."

Did he care?

...

Evelyn remained oblivious to the storm brewing outside her quiet world.

Her life now was simple: her rented apartment, the library, and her kitchen.

She studied late into the night and occasionally brought supper to her overworked neighbor.

Though her space was smaller, every breath she took was free.

"Evelyn, still at the library?" Sophia’s call came right on schedule.

"Yeah." Evelyn stepped softly into the hallway.

"It’s Friday. Let’s get dinner."

"I—"

"No excuses. Even scholars need breaks." Sophia left no room for refusal. "Six o’clock. The sushi place."
###Chapter 17

Sophia Laurent's slender fingers tapped lightly on the menu as she selected several exquisite sashimi platters. The translucent salmon slices were neatly arranged on an ice plate, glistening invitingly.

Evelyn Langley hesitated over the menu before finally ordering a steaming bowl of tonkotsu ramen. She carefully blew on the hot broth before taking small, cautious sips.

"Try this." Sophia picked up a slice of salmon and dipped it lightly in wasabi soy sauce. "It was air-flown in this morning."

Evelyn waved her hands dismissively. "You know I don't eat raw food." She lowered her head to take a bite of sushi, comforted by the warmth of the rice.

"Still the same old Evelyn." Sophia shook her head with an amused smile. She knew her best friend too well - once Evelyn liked something, she stuck with it, and things she disliked would never touch her lips.

Sophia suddenly sighed, examining her hands. "I've been so busy with blind dates lately, I haven't even had time for my usual manicure." She pouted. "My parents have teamed up to pressure me into marriage. It's driving me crazy."

"My cousin Adrian isn't even married yet. Why are they only targeting me?"

At the mention of Adrian Klein's name, Evelyn's chopsticks paused. Since their hotpot dinner, they'd only briefly crossed paths once. She wondered if he'd liked that sandwich she made.

"By the way, how did the meeting with Professor Roland go?" Sophia asked abruptly.

Evelyn swallowed her noodles, her eyes lighting up. "She agreed to reserve a spot for me, as long as I pass the graduate entrance exam."

"That's fantastic!" Sophia clapped her hands. "I'm taking you somewhere special this weekend to celebrate."

"Where?"

"It's a secret."

......

The setting sun's fading light streamed through the library's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting dappled patterns across Evelyn's workbook. She rubbed her tired eyes after solving the final problem.

As the closing announcement echoed through the speakers, she packed her books and stepped outside. The evening sky was painted in vibrant hues, like an overturned palette.

She walked home leisurely, contemplating dinner options. Turning the corner, a familiar figure suddenly came into view.

In the laboratory, Adrian Klein stared intently at the data on his computer screen, his brow furrowed. Several consecutive days of failed experiments hadn't deterred him from meticulously recording every detail.

"Dr. Klein, perhaps we should try a different approach?" The project manager rubbed his hands nervously. "This is becoming a waste of time."

Adrian adjusted his glasses, his gaze sharp as a blade behind the lenses. "Science isn't child's play. If you lack this basic level of patience, you shouldn't have chosen this research topic."

"I just thought Professor Zhu's proposal was more..."

"More what?" Adrian cut in coldly. "More aligned with your interests?"

The manager awkwardly closed his mouth.
###Chapter 18

Adrian Klein turned to leave when a clear voice called from behind, "Long time no see, neighbor."

Evelyn Langley stood bathed in the sunset, waving at him with a smile brighter than the evening glow.

They strolled slowly along the tree-lined path. Evelyn deliberately avoided their previous topic, casually chatting about recent happenings instead.

"Thanks to your explanation last time, I've been solving problems much more smoothly."

Adrian shook his head. "You're just naturally bright. How's Professor Roland doing?"

Evelyn kicked a small pebble on the path. "We've talked a few times. She's recovering well and will be back teaching next week."

"That's good." A faint smile touched Adrian's lips. "Her students are always her top concern."

As dusk deepened, a wobbling bicycle suddenly swerved toward them.

Evelyn stepped on an uneven paving stone and stumbled forward.

Adrian reacted instantly, gripping her wrist and pulling her firmly against his chest.

"Careful."

His palm burned against her skin through the thin fabric. The tips of Evelyn's ears flushed scarlet.

"Thank you."

They stood close enough to catch each other's scent. Evelyn hastily retreated half a step as Adrian released her hand.

The rest of their walk passed in silence.

Back home, Evelyn leaned against her closed door, her heartbeat still unsteady.

The warmth of his touch lingered on her wrist, while a faint hint of mint teased her senses.

She absently rubbed the still-tingling skin.

......

The lab debate had left Adrian sweating.

Slipping into house shoes, he reached for his phone to order dinner.

A shopping recommendation popped up—fluffy bear slippers identical to the pair Evelyn wore at home.

Memory flashed: her pale feet peeking from those slippers, round toes like delicate pearls.

Adrian's throat moved as he recalled the slender wrist he'd held earlier, even fairer than her ankles.

......

Sunday dawned bright and clear.

Chloe Valentine stood before her mirror, adjusting the neckline of her ruffled sundress repeatedly.

"Did the sun rise in the west today?" Her roommate teased from bed. "Our sleeping beauty woke at eight to do makeup?"

Another roommate chimed in, "Obviously a date with Mr. Evans! Chloe, what surprise did he plan for your birthday?"

Securing her final earring, Chloe checked the time and grabbed her purse. "I'll tell you when I get back!"
###Chapter 19

Chloe Valentine bounded down the stairs three steps at a time. The familiar black sports car stood out conspicuously at the school gate.

Nathan Evans leaned against the car door, a cigarette dangling between his slender fingers. Sunlight bathed his figure—the beige hoodie paired with black cargo pants made him look like a recent graduate.

Girls walking past stole glances at him.

By his third glance at his watch, his brows had already furrowed.

Just as he unlocked his phone, a warm body suddenly pressed against his back.

"Waiting long?" Chloe stood on tiptoe, wrapping her arms around his neck, her hair brushing against his chin.

"Seven minutes late." Nathan stubbed out his cigarette, his tone indifferent.

"Professor kept us late." She blinked. "I'll treat you to ice cream next time as an apology."

Nathan gave a faint hum and opened the car door.

Chloe slid into the passenger seat, chattering nonstop during the drive. Nathan steered with one hand, occasionally responding with a quiet "Mhm."

At a red light, Chloe suddenly pointed out the window. "Look!"

A massive billboard played a Universal Studios promotional video.

"Can we go here?" She tugged at his sleeve and gave it a playful shake.

Nathan glanced at the GPS. "Up to you."

He pulled a velvet box from the glove compartment and tossed it to her.

"Birthday gift."

Chloe's eyes lit up the moment she opened the box. "The Celestial collection from Chanel! This one takes three months to pre-order!"

She eagerly slipped the bracelet onto her wrist, the diamonds glittering under the sunlight.

"How did you know I wanted this?" She leaned over and planted a kiss on his cheek.

Nathan smirked. "Lucky guess."

......

Evelyn Langley was jolted awake by her phone ringing at the crack of dawn.

"Ten minutes—I'll be waiting downstairs!" Sophia Laurent's voice brimmed with energy.

Evelyn hurried through her morning routine, grabbed her backpack, and dashed downstairs.

"Right on time." Sophia handed her a cup of soy milk. "Your reward."

The roar of the sports engine faded as they pulled up to Universal Studios' entrance moments later.

Evelyn eyed the crowded gates. "Just the two of us?"

"Of course!" Sophia waved two VIP tickets. "I even got limited-edition headbands. Put yours on!"
###Chapter 20

Sophia Laurent pressed a white fox ear headband into Evelyn Langley's hand while adjusting her own pink Disney headpiece.

"Put it on!" she urged.

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn secured the headband in her hair.

Sophia stepped back to admire her handiwork, eyes lighting up. "You look just like a little vixen!"

She grabbed Evelyn's wrist and charged forward. "We're riding every attraction today!"

Screams exploded around them.

Evelyn rubbed her ringing ears, glancing at Sophia slumped on a bench.

"Feeling better?"

"Ugh—"

She quickly handed over bottled water and tissues.

"That rollercoaster nearly killed me..." Sophia wiped her mouth weakly.

"Who insisted on extreme rides?" Evelyn shook her head.

Sophia collapsed against her shoulder with a groan. "I admit defeat..."

After resting, they headed for lunch.

Suddenly, the crowd stirred.

"Look up!"

The blue sky filled with colorful balloons like a dreamy ocean.

"Some rich guy's birthday surprise," bystanders murmured.

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Let's go. I'm starving."

......

A long queue snaked before the pirate ship.

Chloe Valentine returned with shaved ice. "Our turn's next!"

Nathan Evans scrolled through his phone indifferently.

Near the carousel, gasps erupted as balloons ascended.

A man knelt with roses before his girlfriend, embracing her in the floating colors.

"So romantic..." Chloe whispered.

Today was her birthday too.

Nathan gave a dismissive glance before returning to his screen.

Such flashy gestures had always disgusted him.

He'd never indulged Evelyn with them.

Certainly wouldn't start now.
###Chapter 21

The afternoon sun was perfect as Sophia Laurent eagerly pulled Evelyn Langley to see the dolphin show.

A long line stretched outside the performance venue. Sophia stood on tiptoe, peering ahead while clutching two tickets in her hand.

The blast of cool air from the AC finally soothed Evelyn's sun-flushed cheeks.

Sophia excitedly pointed at the dolphins leaping from the water and shoved her camera into Evelyn's hands.

Seeing Sophia's radiant smile, Evelyn couldn't help but soften her own expression.

After the show, Evelyn handed her bag to Sophia and turned toward the restroom.

At the sink, Chloe Valentine was reapplying her lipstick in the mirror.

Evelyn walked past her without a glance, heading straight for a stall.

When she came out, Chloe was still there—clearly waiting for her.

The faucet ran loudly as Evelyn focused on scrubbing her hands.

Their eyes met briefly in the mirror before quickly looking away.

"What a coincidence, Evelyn," Chloe said, shaking her wrist so her silver bracelet glinted under the lights.

Evelyn didn't respond, continuing to rinse her fingers.

"How have you been lately?" Chloe tilted her head, her gaze probing.

"Fine." Evelyn turned off the water.

Chloe let out a soft laugh. "Getting used to living on your own?"

"None of your concern."

"Actually, I should thank you." Chloe's eyes suddenly reddened. "If you hadn't stepped aside, Nathan and I wouldn't have worked out so smoothly."

Evelyn pulled a paper towel and slowly dried her hands.

"See the balloons outside?" Chloe stroked the bracelet on her wrist. "Nathan said this looks especially beautiful on me..."

Evelyn caught sight of the familiar brand logo, and her chest tightened.

So that day, he had been picking out a gift for Chloe.

"Congratulations." She tossed the words over her shoulder and walked away.

Sophia waved at her near the exit. "What took you so long?"

"I'm a little tired. Let's head back." Evelyn rubbed her temples.

"No way!" Sophia shook her phone. "I just booked us tickets for the haunted house—they say it's terrifying!"

Evelyn raised a brow. "I thought you hated stuff like this?"

"Not when you're with me!" Sophia linked arms with her.

In the end, Evelyn let herself be dragged to the haunted house entrance.

The staff scanned Sophia's phone. "Right this way, ladies."
###Chapter 22

"Step right in."

The staff member pulled aside the heavy black curtain. A chilling gust of wind rushed out. Evelyn Langley squinted, barely making out a dim passageway stretching into the darkness.

Screams echoed from within. Sophia Laurent clutched Evelyn's wrist so tightly her nails nearly drew blood.

"Maybe we should turn back?" Evelyn eyed her pale-faced friend.

"No way!" Sophia jutted her chin stubbornly. "We already bought tickets!"

Evelyn had no choice but to let herself be dragged forward.

"Ahhh!"

A blood-smeared monster lunged from around the corner. Sophia shrieked and hid behind Evelyn.

Nearby, Nathan Evans whipped his head around.

Had he just heard that familiar name?

"Nathan?" Chloe Valentine timidly tugged his sleeve. "I'm scared..."

Nathan absentmindedly patted her shoulder, his gaze still searching the shadows.

Eerie red lights flickered along the passage. Chloe clung to Nathan like a limpet, eyes squeezed shut.

"Is...is it gone?" Her trembling voice muffled against his chest.

"Gone." He gave a perfunctory pat to her back.

This level of horror couldn't even frighten a child.

His mind flashed to Evelyn's first haunted house visit—she'd been so unfazed she'd discussed prop-making techniques with the staff.

The memory made his chest constrict.

"Nathan?" Chloe noticed his distraction.

"Let's keep moving." He shook off the thought.

Meanwhile, Sophia faced her greatest challenge yet.

"AHHHHH!"

The zombie rising from a coffin shattered her nerves. She bolted like a startled rabbit before Evelyn could react.

Evelyn stared at the empty space where her friend had been.

"......"

Shaking her head, she turned—and met the pleading eyes of the coffin actor.

The NPC blinked, his fake tongue flopping out comically.

Evelyn sighed and helped tuck the prop back in place.

"Thanks," the actor whispered.

Alone now, Evelyn soon got lost in the maze-like corridors. Three identical forks—one completely blocked off.

"Terrible design..."

A blaring alarm cut her off mid-sentence.

She froze.

Spoke too soon.

Panicked visitors stampeded toward the exit. The narrow passage became a suffocating crush. Evelyn struggled to breathe, forced to slow her pace.

###Chapter 23

The alarm pierced through the darkness. Emergency lights flickered to life. Evelyn Langley squinted, tracing the evacuation map on the wall in the dim glow.

She hurried past the second checkpoint. The distant clamor of panicked voices grew louder. The exit was jammed with terrified tourists, packed like sardines.

A sudden surge of bodies shoved her sideways. Evelyn crashed into the rough cave wall, the jagged surface scraping her back. Someone stomped on her toes. She gasped in pain.

Then she felt it—a scorching gaze burning into her.

Her eyes locked with Nathan Evans' obsidian depths. The impeccably suited man stood like an island of calm in the chaos. His brow furrowed as his gaze swept over her.

"Nathan?" Chloe Valentine tugged his sleeve, eyeing Evelyn with suspicion.

Evelyn turned away, pushing into the crowd.

A scream shattered the air. Metal screeched overhead. A wooden prop sword teetered precariously from the ceiling.

Nathan's pupils contracted. He shook off Chloe, plowed through the mob, and yanked Evelyn against his chest just as the sword crashed down.

The impact reverberated through the cavern.

Evelyn's pulse roared in her ears. Nathan's warm palm still pressed against her waist, his familiar cedar scent enveloping her.

She shoved him away. "Thanks."

Nathan stared at his empty hand, eyes darkening. "That's it?"

"What else?" Evelyn braced against the wall to stand.

"Why block me?" He stepped closer, voice gravelly.

She laughed coldly. "Exes delete contacts. Common sense."

"Add me back." A command.

"Pass." She turned to leave, but Nathan seized her wrist.

"Enough games." Anger simmered beneath his words.

Chloe suddenly wedged between them, clinging to Nathan's arm. "It's terrifying here...let's go..." Her red-rimmed eyes resembled a frightened rabbit's.

Staff began directing the crowd. Evelyn slipped free and strode toward the exit without looking back.

Nathan shook off Chloe and gave chase, only to lose her at a turn. He watched helplessly as her slender figure vanished into the light. His fist smashed into the stone wall.
###Chapter 24

"Nathan, wait for me—" Chloe Valentine hurried after him, her stilettos clicking sharply against the polished floor.

Outside the exit gate, Sophia Laurent paced anxiously. News of the amusement ride malfunction that nearly caused a fire had her stomping her feet in frustration. If not for the staff blocking the way, she would've rushed in to search for her friend.

Half an hour later, Evelyn Langley finally emerged.

"You scared me to death!" Sophia grabbed her arm. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Evelyn patted her hand. "Just a bit tired. Let's head back."

Just as Sophia was about to agree, her eyes widened. "Isn't that Nathan Evans?"

Nathan and Chloe walked out side by side, chatting and laughing.

"What terrible luck," Sophia muttered, rolling her eyes.

Evelyn gave them a passing glance. "Just a coincidence. Let's go."

On the drive back, Sophia grew angrier by the minute. Suddenly, she made a sharp U-turn.

"Where are we going?" Evelyn gripped the seatbelt as the car lurched.

"Taking you somewhere fun!" Sophia gritted her teeth. "Decent men are everywhere!"

......

8 PM, neon lights flickered to life.

Evelyn let Sophia drag her into an upscale bar. Deafening music pulsed through the air as multicolored lights swept over the packed dance floor.

Her simple white tee and jeans starkly contrasted with the heavily made-up girls around her.

In a VIP booth upstairs, Sophia boldly ordered a bottle of whiskey. Evelyn settled for a low-proof cocktail, her cheeks already flushed after a few sips.

"I need the restroom." She stood, her steps slightly unsteady.

At the restroom entrance, she bumped into Ethan Winston.

"What a coincidence." Evelyn nodded politely.

Ethan's eyes lit up. "Here alone?"

"With a friend." She instinctively took half a step back.

"Nathan didn't come?"

At the name, Evelyn's smile froze. "We broke up."

"For real?" Ethan studied her with a meaningful look.

"Do people fake breakups?" She turned to leave.

"Evelyn." He suddenly called after her.

The overly familiar nickname made her skin crawl. "Something else?"

Ethan stared at her flushed cheeks for a beat before smiling. "Nothing. Have fun."

Once she was out of sight, he pulled out his phone and snapped a photo of her retreating figure, casually sending it to their group chat.

[Photo]
[Guess who I just ran into]

Dylan Lowell replied instantly:
[No way! Evelyn?]
Julian Roscente:
[At Nightfall?]
Dylan:
[Definitely! I'd recognize that backdrop anywhere]
Ethan:
[@Nathan Evans Playing dead?]
###Chapter 25

Nathan Evans sat by the floor-to-ceiling window of the French restaurant, the crystal chandelier casting a soft glow. His slender fingers idly swirled the wine glass, but his gaze remained fixed on his phone screen.

Chloe Valentine noticed his sudden change in expression and set down her fork. "What's wrong?"

Nathan didn't answer, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the phone.

He typed rapidly: [Not my problem.]

Ethan Winston studied the message, amusement flickering in his eyes: [So you and Evelyn Langley are really over this time?]

Nathan stared at the screen, his Adam's apple bobbing: [Got a problem with that?]

Ethan sent a surrender emoji: [Wouldn't dare]

Followed by another message: [So you wouldn't mind if someone pursued her?]

Julian Roscente suddenly chimed in: [You're making a move?]

Ethan replied leisurely: [Mhm]

Dylan Lowell: [LOL this is getting good]

Julian: [You're serious?]

No one in the group took it seriously.

Nathan scoffed: [Do whatever you want.]

Ethan pocketed his phone, satisfied.

He wondered if someone would regret this later.

......

"Thanks for celebrating my birthday with me."

At 9 PM, Nathan walked Chloe to her dorm.

The girl clung to his sleeve, unwilling to let go. "Do we have to say goodbye so soon?" She tilted her face up, batting her dewy eyes. "Aren't you sad at all?"

Under the streetlight, her long lashes cast delicate shadows, her pouty lips glistening.

Nathan ruffled her hair. "You have class tomorrow. Get some rest."

Disappointment flashed in Chloe's eyes before she nodded obediently. "Okay, I'll head up now."

Thirty minutes later, Nathan sat in the driver's seat, staring at the fork ahead.

Left led home.

Right led to the bar district.

Raindrops suddenly splattered against the windshield, blurring his view.

In the rearview mirror, a cashmere blanket lay crumpled on the backseat—the one Chloe had used earlier.

He remembered how Evelyn always complained his car was too cold, dragging him out to buy that blanket.

After their breakup, it had remained neatly folded.

Today, someone else had used it.

A honk startled him.

The light turned green. He slammed the accelerator and veered right.

At the bar entrance, he tossed his keys to the valet.

The manager fawned as he approached. "Mr. Evans, Mr. Winston and the others are in the VIP lounge upstairs."

Nathan strode straight up.

When he pushed open the private room door, the stench of alcohol hit him.

Several drunken figures sprawled across the couches.
###Chapter 26

Nathan Evans pushed open the door to find Ethan Winston alone in the private room.

"Rare guest." Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Thought you were busy with your girlfriend?"

"Took her back to the dorm." Nathan sat casually, his gaze sweeping the empty couch.

Ethan swirled his red wine. "Burgundy. Care for a taste?"

He poured a glass and handed it over.

Nathan took a sip. "Decent."

"Where's Evelyn Langley?" The question sounded casual.

Ethan smirked knowingly. "Came specifically for her?"

"Passing by." Nathan's expression remained cool. "Just asking."

"Ran into her in the hallway earlier. Had a couple drinks and left." Ethan shrugged. "Probably couldn't stand the atmosphere."

The faintest hint of a smile touched Nathan's lips.

He set down his glass and stood. "Meeting tomorrow. I'm leaving. Tonight's on me."

Ethan watched him go with complicated eyes.

"Sorry about this," he murmured to himself.

......

In another booth, Sophia Laurent lay unconscious from intoxication.

Evelyn called a designated driver to take her best friend home first, then hailed a cab for herself.

A sudden downpour made the driver refuse to enter the narrow alley.

She stood at the alley's entrance, raindrops dampening her hair.

"Evelyn."

That familiar voice made her turn.

Adrian Klein approached with an umbrella, his casual attire making him look years younger.

"Planning to get soaked?" He frowned.

She nodded.

"Take it." He thrust the umbrella into her hands.

"What about you?"

"I'll borrow one across the street."

She watched Adrian enter the notoriously difficult Sichuan restaurant opposite and emerge moments later with another umbrella.

"Fixed their wiring once," he explained briefly.

Through the curtain of rain, they walked single file.

The aged streetlamp cast dimmer light in the storm.

Thunder rumbled, making Evelyn instinctively quicken her pace.

She noticed Adrian maintained perfect distance—

Close enough to ease her nerves, yet not so near as to discomfort her.

"Keeping up?" He suddenly turned back.

"Yeah." Her reply was soft.

By the time they reached her place, her pant cuffs were soaked through.

After a hot shower, Evelyn sat staring at her medicine bowl.

Her mind replayed the image of that figure who'd sheltered her from the storm.
###Chapter 27

The days of exam preparation were monotonous yet fulfilling. Surprisingly, Evelyn found herself adapting well to this rhythm.

As night fell, she had just set down her pen to take a break when her phone vibrated abruptly.

The caller ID showed Prof. Eleanor Roland.

"How's your revision progress?" The professor's voice came through the receiver.

Evelyn gave a brief update on her recent studies.

After listening, Eleanor simply hummed in acknowledgment, seemingly pleased with her discipline.

"Come to my place tomorrow morning," the professor suddenly said.

The call ended abruptly, as if fearing her refusal.

Morning sunlight filtered through the gaps in the curtains.

Evelyn tied on an apron and busied herself in the kitchen. The millet congee she'd simmered overnight emitted an enticing aroma. She packed an extra portion without thinking.

The neighboring apartment had remained silent all night—Adrian must have pulled another all-nighter at the lab.

As she opened her door, she nearly collided with the man who had just returned.

Two weeks had passed since she last saw him. His shirt collar was slightly wrinkled, faint shadows beneath his eyes.

"Freshly made millet congee," she offered a thermos. "Added some pumpkin—good for the stomach."

Adrian's fingertips felt cool as he accepted it.

"Thanks." His voice sounded hoarse.

"I never properly thanked you for bringing me home last time." Her eyes curved into crescents.

"Just happened to be going that way." His tone remained neutral as his gaze dropped to her bag. "Heading out?"

"The professor needs to see me." She checked her watch. "I should get going."

As she turned, she heard him murmur, "Smells good."

The golden millet congee in the thermos was perfectly soft, the pumpkin's sweetness just right. Stirring it slowly, Adrian felt some of his post-all-nighter fatigue begin to fade.

The subway during morning rush hour was a sea of people.

Evelyn barely managed to squeeze out, her hair disheveled. Straightening her collar, she hurried toward the professor's residential complex.

The security guard recognized her and waved her through.

When she rang the doorbell, a stranger answered.

"It's you?" The young man's eyes widened in surprise.

Ryan Clementson found the girl familiar, then remembered—she was the one who'd stopped him at the campus gates asking about the professor's health.

Before Evelyn could speak, Eleanor's voice called from inside.

Carrying freshly purchased water chestnut cakes, she stepped into the foyer. The sweet fragrance immediately filled the air.
###Chapter 28

"Perfect timing. Help me check if these materials are correct." Professor Eleanor Roland adjusted her reading glasses and motioned for her to come closer.

Evelyn Langley set down her bag and approached the desk. Spread across it was an English edition of Genetic Sequencing Technology, a cutting-edge work in bioinformatics.

"I remember this series has a volume specifically about genetic testing. Where did it go?"

Evelyn scanned the bookshelf, her gaze suddenly landing on a blue-covered book. "Professor, is this the one?"

"Yes, yes!" Eleanor tapped her forehead. "Right in front of me, and I searched forever."

"Ryan, come here." The professor beckoned. "Take these materials for reference. Let me know if you need more."

"Thank you, Professor." Ryan Clementson accepted the book.

He was preparing his thesis and had come specifically to borrow original materials from Professor Roland.

Eleanor finally remembered to introduce them. "This is Evelyn Langley, my former star student. Soon to be my student again."

Ryan blinked. "She's applying for your graduate program?"

"Exactly." The professor smiled. "This is Ryan Clementson, a second-year master's student planning for his Ph.D. You two can study together."

Evelyn nodded. "Nice to meet you, Senior. I'm Evelyn Langley."

Ryan pulled out his phone. "Let's exchange contacts. We can discuss any questions."

They swapped numbers. Ryan, rushing to class, left in a hurry.

Evelyn brought out a plate of glistening water chestnut cakes from the kitchen.

"From the shop in East City?" Eleanor's eyes lit up. "You waited in line forever, didn't you?"

"I passed by and grabbed them." Evelyn downplayed it.

The professor saw right through her. "Nonsense. That place has hour-long lines." She pinched Evelyn's cheek. "Don't bother next time. Just come."

Evelyn looped her arm through the older woman's. "It's no trouble. It was quick."

"Stop sweet-talking." Eleanor pulled two practice tests from the shelf. "Do these."

"You called me here just to supervise my test-taking?" Evelyn fake-pouted.

"Less sass, more work."

Evelyn spent the entire day at the professor's home. By evening, she'd cooked a table of her signature dishes and cleaned the kitchen before leaving.

During her nighttime review, her phone buzzed.

Ryan: Library tomorrow?

Evelyn replied: Sure.

The next morning, Ryan was already waiting at the library entrance.

"Had breakfast?" He handed her soy milk and steamed buns.

"Thanks." Evelyn ate quickly, and they entered the library.

As the elevator doors opened, a figure suddenly rushed forward, squeezing in ahead of them.

It was Chloe Valentine and her friend.

###Chapter 29

The alarm blared three times before Chloe Valentine finally pried her eyes open.

Bleary-eyed, she glanced at the clock and jolted upright in bed.

"I'm going to be late!" She frantically shook her roommate awake.

The two sprinted all the way to the library. Chloe doubled over, hands on her knees, gasping for breath.

Evelyn Langley stood waiting by the elevator, arms laden with thick graduate school prep books.

"Which floor?" Evelyn gave her a sidelong glance.

"Two...second," Chloe panted.

As the elevator doors opened, Chloe noticed the books and raised an eyebrow. "Studying? Don't tell me you're applying to grad school."

Evelyn remained silent, calmly watching the floor numbers.

Chloe scoffed. "Most fresh graduates can't even get in, let alone someone who's been out of school for years—"

"Whether I get in is irrelevant," Evelyn cut in. "When you say fresh graduates can't get in...are you referring to yourself?"

Chloe's face flushed crimson. As a junior, she'd been procrastinating on her grad school plans. While her roommates diligently prepared, she kept relying on Nathan Evans as her safety net.

"You think everyone's like you?" she spat through gritted teeth. "He'll give me anything I want."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Then I hope you always feel this confident."

With that, she strode toward Ryan Clementson who was already walking away.

"Who was that?" her roommate asked curiously.

"No one important," Chloe snapped, then abruptly changed the subject. "Do you know how to make millet congee?"

Her roommate looked baffled. "There are tutorials online."

Chloe immediately downloaded a cooking app and spent the entire morning studying recipes. Her textbooks remained untouched on the table as her roommate watched with concern.

At noon, Chloe rushed to the supermarket and returned with armfuls of kitchenware and ingredients.

"What's all this for?" Her roommate gaped.

"Cooking lessons." Chloe declared with determination. "I'm going to be the perfect domestic goddess."

She refused to lose to Evelyn.

Late that night, Nathan's luxury car pulled up to his estate. The moment he stepped out, a perfumed figure threw herself into his arms.

"Darling, I've missed you so much!" Chloe cooed.

Nathan deftly sidestepped her embrace. "What are you doing here?"

"I came to keep you company." She fluttered her lashes. "Let me give you a massage?"

Rubbing his temples, Nathan replied, "That won't be necessary."
###Chapter 30

Chloe carefully lifted a steaming bowl of millet congee from the insulated bag, her fingertips turning slightly red from the heat.

"I made this specially for you since you mentioned wanting to try it last time."

Nathan glanced at her flushed fingers, unlocked the door with his fingerprint, and stepped aside. "Come in."

This was the first time Chloe had stepped inside his villa in the three months they'd been dating.

Her nervous reflection stared back at her from the marble floor of the foyer. The six-meter-high ceiling in the living room caught the fractured light from the crystal chandelier. She recognized the Monet water lilies painting on the wall—they'd just covered it in last week's art appreciation class.

A Hermès scarf lay casually draped over the leather sofa, while a limited-edition Zippo lighter sat on the coffee table. The open-concept kitchen gleamed with cold precision from its imported German appliances.

Her grip tightened on the insulated bag's handle. Just last week, when her roommate had proudly shown off her new Chanel bag, Chloe had thought such luxuries were completely out of reach.

Nathan was already seated at the dining table. He took a spoonful of the congee, swallowed twice, then set down the porcelain spoon.

"Does it not taste good?" Chloe leaned closer, her hair brushing against the back of his hand.

"I already ate at a business dinner." He loosened his tie, the silver cufflinks glinting coldly under the light. "Why did you suddenly decide to make this?"

"No classes tomorrow." She rested her chin on her hand, her lashes casting delicate shadows. "I heard there's a Gemini meteor shower tonight. Maybe we could—"

"The forecast says it'll be cloudy." Nathan stood, the faint scent of cedarwood drifting with his movement. "I'll drive you back to campus."

Chloe suddenly grabbed his wrist. The lace trim of her low-cut dress slipped slightly, revealing a tiny mole near her collarbone.

"The dorm supervisor said..." Her voice was like melted honey. "I could apply to stay off-campus."

Nathan chuckled lowly, his thumb brushing her burning earlobe. "In such a hurry to be the lady of the house?"

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, koi fish sent ripples through the fountain. Counting the six-figure pebbles lining the pool, Chloe suddenly rose onto her toes and whispered near his ear, "That annex... is it a playroom for future children?"

The car keys spun a silver arc in Nathan's palm. As he pulled open the door, the night wind carried in the scent of wisteria. "We'll talk after you get into grad school."

Chloe turned at the threshold, her skirt brushing against his tailored trousers. "Want to make a bet?"
###Chapter 31

Nathan's brow arched slightly.

"Dare to register my fingerprint?" Chloe pointed at the door lock, her eyes rimmed red like a rain-soaked puppy. "I've waited for you here so many times. Look at these mosquito bites on my arms and legs..."

She counted the red marks on her skin, her voice trembling with pitiful grievance.

Nathan sighed softly. "I can't bear it."

"Perfect!" Chloe instantly brightened. "Honestly, I just want to visit you openly."

The man chuckled. "Still acting like a child..."

He lowered his head to register her fingerprint.

Remembering the millet congee she'd brought and the rash covering her skin, Nathan pulled a card from his wallet. "Supplementary card. Monthly limit of $100K. Buy whatever you like."

Chloe shook her head frantically. "No, I can't—"

"Take it." His tone brooked no argument. "My woman spends my money. That's how it should be."

"Then... fine." Her eyes sparkled. "I'll bring you more congee tomorrow!"

"No need." Nathan's voice was flat.

If it didn't taste like memory, drinking it was pointless.

......

Outside the library, Evelyn closed her notebook.

Ryan truly lived up to his reputation as the former double champion—his study notes hit every key point. She'd wanted to treat him as thanks, but his roommate had called him away, so they rescheduled for tomorrow.

The June wind carried waves of sweltering heat.

Stepping into her apartment, the AC instantly dispelled the summer's oppression. Evelyn opened the fridge, retrieving broccoli, asparagus, and ribs.

No matter how busy life got, one should always eat well.

As garlic broccoli sizzled in the pan, a faint rustling came from outside. She peeked out to find the cleaning lady tidying the hallway.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the library precisely on time, carrying soy milk and fried dough sticks.

Ryan accepted the breakfast awkwardly. "This is too much..."

"Reciprocity." She smiled, heading toward their usual window-side spot.

Sunlight spilled through the glass onto the textbook pages. Evelyn's focused profile resembled a still-life painting—until her peripheral vision caught Chloe approaching alone. Her brow furrowed slightly.

Chloe's gaze prickled like needles against her back.

The pen scratched softly across paper. Evelyn never looked up. Her page-turns were featherlight, the fall of her hair perfectly poised.

Even Chloe had to admit the silhouette was breathtaking.

Was this why Nathan couldn't forget her?

Clenching her pen, Chloe recalled that day at the haunted house—Nathan shaking off her hand, sprinting toward Evelyn without a backward glance.

But now she was the official girlfriend.

She couldn't lose.
###Chapter 32

Ryan Clementson had started preparing for his PhD entrance exams since his first year of graduate school. After two years of refining his approach, he'd developed a highly effective study method.

Under his influence, Evelyn Langley's study efficiency improved dramatically.

She completed two full practice tests in just one morning.

When Ryan graded them, he was stunned to find she'd scored over 95% accuracy on both.

Considering Evelyn had graduated three years ago and only recently resumed studying, this level of performance...

It was unbelievable!

No wonder Professor Eleanor Roland held her in such high regard.

Unaware of Ryan's thoughts, Evelyn simply excused herself to the restroom.

Chloe Valentine immediately followed.

"Wait."

Evelyn turned, unsurprised. "Yes?"

"Last night, I brought Nathan some midnight snacks at the villa. He drank every last drop of the millet congee I made."

Chloe's lips curved into a sweet smile, dimples appearing. "And... Nathan let me stay overnight."

"I never knew he could be so domineering yet captivating. I barely slept a wink."

Her deliberately suggestive tone and flushed cheeks made her resemble a delicate flower glistening with dew.

Evelyn's chest tightened, her breathing turning shallow.

"Jealous?" Chloe whispered near her ear. "Too bad. You're already out of the game."

Suddenly, Evelyn laughed, meeting her gaze directly. "How do you know he hasn't done the same with others?"

Chloe's expression froze.

"Maybe you're just one of many? And certainly not the last."

Without another word, Evelyn walked away.

Finishing the last problem, Ryan noticed Evelyn's seat had been empty for a while.

As he reached for his phone, she returned.

"You look pale. Are you feeling unwell?"

Evelyn dug her nails into her palm. "The AC might be too stuffy. Let's keep studying."

By 5 p.m., their session ended.

Ryan recalled yesterday's plan. "There's a new Chaoshan hotpot place near campus. My treat?"

Evelyn seemed distracted.

"Sorry, I'm not feeling great today. Rain check?"

"No problem. Next time."

At home, Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa.

The goldfish in the tank darted about cheerfully.

Watching them blow bubbles, drowsiness crept over her.

She woke at 8 p.m., stomach growling.

The fridge was nearly empty.

The supermarket's seafood section still had fresh options.

She selected a snakehead fish and reached for pickled mustard greens.

Her hand accidentally brushed against another warm one.
###Chapter 33

His fingers were long and slender with prominent knuckles, their pale ivory hue accentuated by the supermarket freezer's fluorescent glow. Evelyn's gaze drifted to the shopping cart filled with instant meals and frozen dinners.

"Professor Klein, you can't possibly eat like this every day?" She arched an eyebrow.

Adrian adjusted his glasses. "Too busy with late-night research to order takeout."

"These have scientifically balanced nutrition—proper protein, vitamins, and carbohydrates."

Evelyn burst into laughter. "Only a physicist would calculate meal ratios like chemical formulas."

"If you had to choose between home-cooked dishes and these frozen meals right now, which would you pick?"

After a brief silence, his answer was obvious.

Evelyn flashed a mischievous smile. "I'll cook tonight. In exchange, you'll help me with a small favor."

Thirty minutes later, Adrian stared at the thrashing fish on the cutting board, frowning slightly. "This..."

"The supermarket usually prepares them, but it's crowded today..." She offered a sheepish explanation.

Rolling up his sleeves, he removed his glasses. "Let me try."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. She'd intended to skip the messy work, but watching the renowned physicist in her kitchen suddenly felt like sacrilege.

Five minutes later.

The fish lay in paper-thin slices, arranged with surgical precision.

"Will this suffice?" Adrian asked, wiping his hands.

"More than suffice!" She gaped. "You could open a restaurant with skills like this."

A rare smile touched his lips. "Dissection practice from biology classes."

They cooked hotpot with the fresh fish and vegetables, the aroma filling the kitchen.

After dinner, Adrian insisted on washing dishes. By midnight, Evelyn walked him to the door. "I'll take out the trash. Get some rest."

He nodded and left. Expecting insomnia, she instead fell asleep the moment her head hit the pillow.

The next morning, Sophia's video call woke her.

"Lucky you sleeping in. I've got a blind date at seven." The girl on-screen applied lipstick halfheartedly.

"Want to join me at the library instead?" Evelyn teased.

"No thanks. One academic genius in the family is enough." Sophia pouted. "By the way, I edited those amusement park photos."

WeChat notifications chimed repeatedly. Evelyn scrolled through images—her wearing a fox headband with cheeks pinched, Sophia's ghostly pale face after the rollercoaster.

Her finger froze on the last solo shot. In the background, Chloe and Nathan stood hand-in-hand.

Though the photo was hers, she'd accidentally captured someone else's love story.
###Chapter 34

"Mrs. Watson!"

Nathan Evans hunched over, his forehead damp with cold sweat. His fingers dug into his stomach, knuckles turning white from the pressure.

The villa stood silent, his voice echoing through empty halls.

At five in the morning, sharp pain jolted him awake. His stomach twisted like a knife was carving through it, drenching his pajamas in sweat instantly.

He staggered out of bed, swaying toward the medicine cabinet.

The pillbox was empty.

"Damn it." He clenched his teeth, fumbling for his phone with trembling fingers.

"Bring stomach medicine. Now."

When his assistant arrived, he found Nathan curled on the couch. The usually immaculate dress shirt clung wrinkled to his body, the tie hanging loose around his neck.

"Sir, your medicine."

Nathan snatched the pills, swallowing them dry without water.

"Should I take you to the hospital?"

"Get out." He waved a dismissive hand without opening his eyes.

The moment the door closed, his phone buzzed violently.

"What garbage did you buy?!" Nathan's voice turned icy. "Can't you even read instructions?"

He froze, staring at the unfamiliar brand on the box.

He never had to worry about this before.

Evelyn Langley always stocked his medicine before his flare-ups. Those little white pills had always eased his pain instantly.

His fingers dialed the memorized number automatically.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

The robotic voice made him hurl his phone across the room.

"Young master?" Mrs. Watson stood at the doorway with a grocery basket, startled by the scene.

"Give me your phone." Nathan stretched out a hand.

His fingers shook slightly as he punched in the familiar digits.

"Hello?"

That voice sent another stab of pain through his gut.

"My stomach hurts." The hoarse words drained his last ounce of strength.
###Chapter 35

Evelyn's fingers turned white as she gripped her phone.

The image of Nathan and Chloe holding hands was burned into her mind.

"If you're sick, go to the hospital."

Her voice remained eerily calm.

Heavy breathing came through the receiver.

The call ended with a sharp click as she tossed her phone onto the couch.

The coffee on the table had gone cold.

Nathan stared at the darkened screen, his knuckles turning white.

Crash!

His phone shattered against the wall.

Mrs. Watson's hands trembled as she carried the medicine tray.

"Young master..."

Nathan clutched his stomach, sweat beading on his forehead.

"Get out."

He staggered upstairs and slammed the bedroom door.

Mrs. Watson sighed at the broken phone remains.

Such a wonderful girl, Miss Evelyn...

Afternoon sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Mrs. Watson knocked softly after finishing her chores.

"Young master? Time for your medicine..."

Silence.

Shaking her head, she left the villa with the trash bags.

Isabella's heels clicked across the living room floor at dusk.

"Bro? Mom wants—"

Her voice cut off.

An unanswered call glowed on the coffee table.

The second floor lay in ominous silence.

"Bro!"

She raced upstairs, pounding on the door.

"Mrs. Watson! Is something wrong with Nathan?"

The housekeeper's panicked voice came through. "He hasn't come out..."

The spare key turned with a grating sound.

Isabella's scream pierced the quiet.

"Call an ambulance! Now!"

Harsh fluorescent lights illuminated the hospital corridor.

Nathan's throat burned when he awoke.

"Water..."

Dylan quickly handed him a glass.

The room overflowed with visitors.

Ethan frowned. "Gastric hemorrhage and you tried to tough it out?"

Julian peeled an apple. "If Isabella hadn't found you..."

Isabella wiped red-rimmed eyes. "You scared me to death."

Nathan's gaze swept across each face.

Absent.

The one presence he sought.

He closed his eyes, mouth twisting bitterly.

She'd truly... abandoned him.
###Chapter 36

"What's wrong with me?" Nathan Evans opened his eyes, his voice hoarse.

Dylan Lowell stood by the bed, holding a medical report. "The doctor said your irregular eating habits and excessive drinking caused a stomach perforation."

Isabella Evans' eyes were red. "You scared me to death! When I walked in and saw you collapsed on the floor, your face was as pale as paper..." Her voice cracked. "The doctor said you need proper rest and can't keep neglecting your health."

Margaret Evans had been glowering silently until she finally snapped. "Where's Evelyn Langley? Her boyfriend is hospitalized, and she can't even show her face?"

Isabella also looked puzzled.

In the past, even if Nathan had a minor cold, Evelyn would stay by his side. Yet for something this serious, she was nowhere to be found.

The room fell silent.

Nathan stared blankly at the ceiling. Dylan and Julian Roscente exchanged glances, neither daring to speak.

"They broke up," Ethan Winston broke the silence. "Nathan ended it."

Margaret frowned. "Still throwing a tantrum? It's been days! She's really pushing her luck!"

Nathan's expression darkened further.

"Mrs. Evans," Ethan gave her a meaningful look, "this time is different."

"What do you mean? Is she playing hard to get?" Margaret's voice rose sharply.

"Mom," Nathan cut in coldly, "we're done for good."

Margaret froze.

Isabella's eyes widened.

Come to think of it, Evelyn had been unusually absent for a long time...

Margaret stormed out of the room and immediately dialed Evelyn's number in the hallway.

"Evelyn Langley!" she hissed the moment the call connected. "Who do you think you are? My son choosing you was a blessing you didn't deserve!"

"Do you know how much money he's spent on you? Even a dog would wag its tail in gratitude!"

Her voice dripped with venom. "Get your ass to the hospital right now—"

On the other end, Evelyn listened quietly before replying calmly, "I'm sorry, but Nathan and I are no longer involved."

She hung up, swiftly blocked the number, and deleted the contact.

After completing these actions, she exhaled deeply, as if a heavy weight had been lifted.

Margaret stared at her phone in disbelief at the dial tone. When she tried calling again, the line was dead.

"Fine! Just fine!" She trembled with rage.

......

Ryan Clementson noticed the faint smile on her lips. "Good news?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Just took care of some trouble."

Night had fallen as they left the library. Streetlights stretched their shadows long, and autumn leaves rustled in the wind.

Gathering courage, Ryan glanced at the girl's serene profile. "About that dinner we mentioned—how about tonight? Unless you're busy..."

Evelyn considered it. "I have ingredients at home. If you don't mind, I can cook?"

Ryan's ears turned pink. "Y-Your place?"

"It's a fifteen-minute walk," she added. "Or we can eat out. Your call."

Seeing her composed expression, Ryan suppressed his nervousness. "Home sounds perfect. Thanks."
###Chapter 37

Evelyn pushed open her apartment door and tossed the keys into the glass bowl by the entryway. She headed straight for the refrigerator, pulling open the door to inspect its contents.

Plenty of groceries remained from yesterday's shopping. She mentally planned tonight's menu: braised beef brisket with potatoes, sweet and sour ribs, scrambled eggs with tomatoes, and a simple stir-fried vegetable dish would suffice.

The rhythmic sound of chopping soon filled the kitchen. Ryan stood nearby, watching her precise knife skills with wide-eyed admiration.

"Not many women these days know how to cook like this," he remarked. "Most girls I know survive on takeout."

Evelyn didn't look up. "Just habit." With a flick of her wrist, perfectly cubed potatoes tumbled into the pot.

Ryan glanced around the immaculate apartment. Professional books lined the living room shelves in neat rows. His gaze caught on an anomalous title among the medical texts—Introduction to Quantum Mechanics.

Realizing he'd been staring at a woman's private belongings, he quickly averted his eyes.

Forty minutes later, four steaming dishes graced the table. The ribs glistened with caramelized glaze, the golden scrambled eggs with tomatoes looked fluffy and fresh, their aromas mingling deliciously.

Ryan bit into a rib and his eyes widened. "This is incredible!" He shoveled rice into his mouth. "Better than Michelin-starred restaurants!"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Slow down. No one's fighting you for it."

"Seriously, whoever marries you must've done something amazing in a past life—" Ryan's words cut off as urgent knocking erupted at the door.

Evelyn set down her chopsticks, brow furrowing. "I'll get it."

The door opened to reveal Isabella grabbing her wrist. "Come to the hospital now! My brother's hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer!"

Evelyn didn't move. "We broke up."

"Are you insane?" Isabella's voice rose sharply. "He needs you! He drank himself sick because you ignored his calls!"

"He ended it." Evelyn's tone remained calm.

Isabella trembled with anger. "Six years! He supported you for six years! The mansion, designer clothes, black card—did he ever stint on anything? Don't play the noble act now!"

"Finished?" Evelyn reached to close the door.

"Fine!" Isabella kicked the doorframe viciously. "You'll regret this!"

As footsteps retreated, Evelyn's grip on the doorknob tightened until her knuckles whitened.

"Um..." Ryan stood awkwardly in the living room. "Should we...keep eating?"

When Evelyn turned back, she'd reassembled her smile. "Let me refill your rice."

The rest of the meal passed in heavy silence. Ryan hurriedly finished his last bites and made a tactful exit.

While washing dishes, Evelyn stared blankly at the soap bubbles, Isabella's words stabbing like knives through her heart. The faucet's rushing water drowned out everything but her thoughts.
###Chapter 38

The glass bowl slipped from Evelyn's fingers, shattering on the kitchen floor with a crisp explosion.

She crouched down, a shard slicing her fingertip open. Staring at the bead of blood, tears suddenly splashed onto the back of her hand.

Six years. Over two thousand days. Some habits had seeped into her bones.

When news of Nathan's hospitalization reached her, her first instinct was to grab her coat. Only when her fingers touched the doorknob did reality crash over her.

They were over.

She slowly wiped her tears. The cracks in their relationship had appeared long ago—perhaps with his first broken promise, perhaps with his first lie.

Memories blurred like watercolor paintings left in the rain.

......

Isabella's stilettos hammered an angry rhythm down the hallway. She kicked aside a garbage bag with disgust. "How can anyone live in this dump?"

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Bro? Didn't the doctors tell you not to use your phone?" Her tone was sharp, yet her voice instinctively softened.

In the hospital room, Nathan stared at the IV drip. Dylan stood by the bed, shrugging helplessly. "Couldn't stop her. She insisted on seeing Evelyn."

Forty minutes. Three position changes. Twelve glances at the door. Finally, Nathan picked up his phone.

"Where are you?"

Isabella hesitated. "Out."

"When are you coming back?"

"I'm going home to get the chicken soup—"

"Where's Evelyn?" His voice turned brittle.

Silence.

The silence was answer enough.

Nathan's voice dropped to subzero. "Who told you to contact her? We're done!"

"Fine! I shouldn't have bothered!" Isabella exploded. "Evelyn said she wouldn't care if you died!"

Dead air.

"Bro?"

Only dial tone answered.

......

The latest smartphone lay in pieces on the hospital floor. Mrs. Watson quietly retreated two steps, tucking the spare phone deeper into her pocket.

Not lending this one out. No way.

###Chapter 39

The July sun scorched the earth as the meteorological station issued consecutive red alerts for extreme heat.

Adrian Klein had spent an entire week in the lab, finally completing the validation of critical data. He dragged his exhausted body up seven flights of stairs, his shirt drenched in sweat.

Just as he pulled out his keys, a muffled thud came from the opposite door.

He paused, turning toward the locked security door.

"Evelyn?" He raised his hand to knock.

No response.

After the second knock, a pale face peeked through the crack.

"What do you want?"

Her voice was unnervingly calm, but her eyes were dull as stagnant water.

Adrian adjusted his glasses. "You mentioned working on a thesis last time?"

"Submitted two months ago," she replied mechanically.

"I have an unfinished research project," he said abruptly. "Want to take a look?"

Twenty minutes later.

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly. The data on the paper pierced her gray world like a beam of light.

The study on biological initial variation values had a brilliant approach. But the two most crucial chapters had blank data fields.

"Wrote it sophomore year," Adrian leaned against the bookshelf. "Never touched it after switching majors."

He handed her a forwarded email screenshot. "Professor Roland sent me your undergraduate thesis. Your research direction is strikingly similar."

Evelyn's fingertips unconsciously traced the pages. The clinking of test tubes, the rhythmic beeping of lab equipment—suddenly, the sounds revived in her ears.

"The lab..." Her voice was hoarse. "I haven't been there in ages."

Adrian slid a cup of coffee toward her. "All the data is on the flash drive."

The cicadas outside grew louder. Staring at her reflection in the swirling coffee, Evelyn saw a glimmer reignite in her own eyes.
###Chapter 40

"The opportunity is right in front of you if you want it." Adrian Klein tapped the table with his slender fingers. "Next October, the National Academy of Sciences will form a gene sequencing research group, open to master's and doctoral candidates. If you get into grad school, you’ll be fully qualified to apply."

The project, led by three distinguished professors, had been approved last year. Though not yet public, it was an open secret at Harvard.

For Evelyn Langley, this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

"All the materials are here." He slid a silver flash drive toward her. "Take your time reviewing them."

Her lashes fluttered, eyes shimmering. "Thank you, Adrian. I’ll think it over carefully."

The clock struck ten. Evelyn rose to leave.

Adrian walked her to the foyer.

"We’re literally neighbors. No need for formalities." She waved with a laugh.

His gaze dropped to her fingertips. "Let the wound breathe. Don’t forget to change the dressing."

She instinctively curled her fingers. "Got it."

He returned with a pot of pink-and-blue succulents. "For you."

Plump leaves overlapped like pearls under the light. Evelyn accepted it with delight. "So pretty!"

"Last one at the florist." The corner of his mouth lifted. "Consider it a thank-you gift."

She shook her head. "Friends don’t keep score." Her eyes sparkled like scattered stardust.

"Right." His Adam’s apple bobbed.

In the VIP ward at Massachusetts General Hospital, Julian Roscente swaggered in with an insulated lunchbox.

"See how much I care, Nate?" He unveiled the contents like a prized offering. "Special health-boosting congee. One bowl, and you’ll be back in fighting shape!"

Dylan Lowell’s eyelid twitched at the golden-glowing porridge.

Everyone knew Nathan Evans hated congee—unless a certain someone made it.

Sure enough, Nathan took one half-spoonful and grimaced. "Disgusting."

"Since when?" Julian sniffed it. "Perfect texture, rich aroma."

Nathan tossed the spoon aside. "Get it out of here."

Julian smirked. "Could it be... you’re craving her cooking?" He dragged out the pause. "Too bad she’s now—"

"Get lost." Nathan’s gaze turned glacial.

Dylan hastily yanked his reckless friend away. "Got a death wish?"

In the hallway, Julian shook him off. "Why the act? If he misses her, just say it."

Dylan massaged his temples. "Would it kill you to shut up?"

"Be the matchmaker, then." Julian nudged him. "At this rate, he’ll end up in the ICU from sheer repression."
###Chapter 41

Dawn light filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Langley finished her morning run, water droplets still clinging to her hair. She towel-dried her locks while stepping onto the balcony when a splash of pink caught her eye among the succulents.

The plump little plant unfurled like a flower in the morning glow. She couldn't resist brushing a fingertip against its velvety leaves.

Her phone buzzed on the coffee table.

The name "Dylan Lowell" flashing on the screen made her arch an eyebrow. He rarely called at this hour.

"Hello?"

"Evelyn!" Dylan's voice carried an exaggerated, hushed sweetness. "What've you been up to lately?"

"Same old." She continued drying her hair. "Why do you sound weird?"

He seized the opportunity. "Ugh, don't ask. Drank too much at last night's client dinner. My stomach's killing me." A deliberate pause. "Suddenly craved your nourishing porridge..."

She chuckled. "That's it?"

"I swear! Just the thought of takeout makes me nauseous. Only your cooking can save me now." His dramatic whine bordered on comical. "Please?"

She checked the wall clock. Though ninety percent certain this was an act, it had been a while.

"Fine. I'll grab ingredients later." She feigned sternness. "But if you're faking..."

"Cross my heart! I'm dying here!" he vowed. "Can I swing by at noon?"

Hanging up, Evelyn shook her head. Dylan's terrible acting skills practically screamed he was running errands for someone.

......

Noon sunlight beat down mercilessly. Dylan followed his GPS through winding alleys before finally spotting the apartment building near the old campus.

Wiping sweat, he squinted at unit numbers. The place was hidden like a deliberate secret—no wonder a certain someone had failed to "accidentally" bump into her all these years.

Dylan parked his car outside the aging residential complex.

He walked through the dappled shade of the tree-lined path, stepping over cracked concrete, until he spotted the dingy apartment building.

"Seventh floor...no elevator..." He swallowed hard as he looked up at the precarious balcony railings.

Five minutes later.

Leaning against the wall, he gasped for breath, his dress shirt soaked through with sweat.

The door opened.

Evelyn handed him a glass of water. "You okay?"

He drained the glass in one gulp. "Your place is...hard to find, Evelyn." He bit back the word "shabby."

"Quiet." She turned to retrieve a thermal container from the kitchen. "Eat while it's hot. Be careful."

The moment she lifted the lid, rich aromas filled the air.

Dylan's eyes lit up. "No wonder Nathan's been craving this."

"Thank him for me." Evelyn busied herself with her bag. "I need to head out."

He hesitated, words stuck in his throat.

"Let's go." She'd already pressed the elevator button.

Only their footsteps echoed in the stairwell.

The moment the sports car's engine faded into the distance, Evelyn dropped her polite smile.

Those unspoken words? She'd stopped wanting to hear them long ago.

Hospital corridor.

Dylan thumped the thermal container onto the bedside table. "Your lunch delivery, Nathan."

Nathan's fingers stilled mid-motion.
###Chapter 42

Nathan Evans lifted the lid of the insulated container with skepticism. The moment the first spoonful touched his tongue, the tension in his brow eased.

So much for cutting ties—she still couldn’t let go, could she?

He took another deliberate bite, his gaze flicking toward the door. "Where is she?"

"Who?" Dylan Lowell blinked, momentarily confused.

"This porridge—Evelyn made it, didn’t she? Had a change of heart? Decided to come back?"

Nathan scoffed. "What, does she think this place is a revolving door? Come and go as she pleases?"

Ethan Winston lounged on the sofa, watching Dylan’s flustered expression with mild amusement. "Don’t flatter yourself. Dylan lied and told her he wanted it. That’s the only reason Evelyn bothered. As for her showing up? Not a chance."

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly, his sharp glare pinning Dylan in place. "Who gave you permission to go to her?"

Dylan shrank back. "You haven’t eaten properly in days. If it weren’t for Evelyn’s porridge—"

Nathan said nothing, his silence icy.

"Oh, and the place she’s staying now? A dump. Seventh-floor walk-up in some crumbling old building." Dylan stole a glance at Nathan’s face.

Though the man muttered "Serves her right," the worry in his eyes was unmistakable.

Still not over her.

Just as Dylan considered fanning the flames further, a sickly sweet voice trilled from the doorway—"Darling~"

Ethan and Dylan shuddered in unison.

That voice alone was enough to make spines crawl.

Chloe Valentine hadn’t been able to reach Nathan for days. It wasn’t until she pried the truth from Julian Roscente that she learned he’d been hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer.

Panic seized her.

She bolted from class mid-lecture and raced to the hospital.

The sight of Nathan pale and gaunt in his hospital gown made her eyes well up instantly. "Darling, why didn’t you tell me? Are you still in pain? Should I call the doctor?"

The rapid-fire questions grated on his nerves, but worse was the way she burst into tears the second she stepped inside. Nathan frowned. Even Dylan and Ethan found her theatrics exhausting.

"It’s handled. Stop crying."

He thought of Evelyn then. She would’ve stayed calm. She would’ve known exactly what to do.

Chloe, sharp as ever, caught his irritation and immediately stifled her sobs—though her eyes stayed red-rimmed.

Seeing her quiet down, Nathan’s tone softened marginally. "Just a flare-up. Go back to campus."

"Are you sure you don’t want me to stay? I could make you some porridge—"

Dylan snorted before he could stop himself. They’d just pulled strings to get that porridge, and here was another volunteer.

Only then did Chloe notice the others in the room. At the sound of his laugh, she shot Dylan a glare, cheeks flushing with humiliation.

Nathan’s voice turned steely. "Not necessary. Leave."

Chloe didn’t dare argue. She obeyed without another word.

The moment the door shut, Ethan rose from the sofa. "So. Are you finishing that or not?"

Nathan opened his mouth to refuse—then scowled. "Who said I wasn’t?"
###Chapter 43

The scratching of Evelyn Langley's pen filled the quiet library under the warm glow of lamps.

Both final exam questions had stumped her.

She chewed on her pen cap, deep in thought. A similar problem from a specialized textbook suddenly came to mind.

Rising from her seat, she moved toward the reference section. Her fingers glided swiftly across the book spines.

As she located her target material, her peripheral vision caught the title Genetic Sequence Recombination & Fusion.

Almost unconsciously, she pulled the book from the shelf.

The opening paragraph made her pupils contract.

The theory aligned perfectly with her current research project.

She devoured the pages with growing urgency, her breathing unconsciously slowing.

Her phone's vibration snapped her back to reality.

Sophia Laurent's WeChat icon blinked: Guess where I am?

Evelyn paused mid-sentence: You're on campus?

Beneath the shade of trees, Sophia waved a food container at her.

"Just dropping off some love-packed lunch on my way."

The aroma made Evelyn's stomach growl audibly.

"Not joining me?"

Sophia massaged her temples. "Eight hours of sleep in three days. Need to see my dad now."

She suddenly lowered her voice. "This project involves the Evans family—"

"Stop." Evelyn shoved a parasol into her hands. "Be careful."

Sophia shrugged helplessly at the words Evans Corporation on her documents.

——

In the hospital room, Nathan Evans yanked the IV needle from his hand.

Blood droplets trailed down his fingers as he indifferently pressed a tissue to the wound.

"Mr. Evans! You can't discharge yourself!" The nurse blocked his path in panic.

A single glare silenced her.

He grabbed his jacket and strode out. The antiseptic smell twisted his stomach.

His phone vibrated violently in his pocket.

Margaret Evans' furious voice exploded through the receiver: "Get back here now!"

Nathan powered off the device, shutting out the world beyond his car window.
###Chapter 44

Nathan Evans pushed open the front door, greeted by the familiar emptiness of his home.

He loosened his tie with irritation, undoing the top button of his dress shirt.

The kitchen light flickered on suddenly, freezing him in the doorway.

On the stove sat the clay pot Evelyn Langley always used, its lid bearing a hairline crack. She had chipped it last month while making congee, her face scrunched in frustration as she lamented how it had served her faithfully for three years.

His fingers traced the crack almost involuntarily.

In his memories, she rose before dawn, moving soundlessly through the kitchen. The millet needed soaking, the yams required peeling and dicing, the red dates had to be pitted. She always insisted store-bought congee lacked soul—only her slow-simmered version would do.

"Young master?"

Mrs. Watson's voice snapped him back to reality.

"Madam sent me to check on you." The housekeeper held a thermal container. "You don't look well."

His gaze dropped to the container. "Make some millet congee."

Mrs. Watson hesitated. This was the third time this week.

Two hours later, she carried the congee upstairs to find Nathan sprawled across the bed fully dressed, his forehead glistening with sweat.

Her breath caught when she touched his burning skin.

The villa blazed with lights deep into the night.

Margaret Evans arrived to find the family doctor administering an IV. Nathan's cheeks burned with fever, his lips cracked and peeling.

"Evelyn..." His delirious murmur hung in the air.

Margaret stepped back with red-rimmed eyes, recognizing the clay pot as Evelyn's treasured possession.

At 3 a.m., Nathan surfaced to consciousness as chilled fluids entered his veins.

After long minutes staring at the ceiling, he rasped, "Phone."

A nurse handed over her mobile.

The familiar number rang twice before connecting.

"Hello?"

Evelyn's sleep-softened voice drifted through the receiver, warm as her homemade congee.

Nathan's throat worked, a thousand words lodged beneath his ribs. His lips parted—only to release a ragged exhale.

Fabric rustled on the other end. Then the dial tone.

He clutched the phone until the screen went dark.
###Chapter 45

A faint whisper came through the late-night call. "Evelyn... it hurts."

Nathan's voice carried a barely detectable tremor.

Evelyn's heart clenched.

She knew this man too well. Proud as he was, he never showed weakness easily. The last time his stomach acted up, he'd stubbornly endured until passing out before being rushed to the hospital.

During their time living together, she'd experimented with different soups and porridges for him daily. She'd stayed up until 3 AM studying acupressure just to ease his stomach pain.

It took her six months to nurse his condition back to health.

All she got in return was his complaint that she nagged too much, calling her a fussy housewife.

Memories surged like a tide, then receded just as quickly.

"If it hurts, see a doctor." Her voice was ice-cold.

"I want your porridge." Nathan stubbornly repeated.

Silence stretched between them.

In the end, Evelyn hung up first.

When the nurse came for rounds, she found Nathan motionless, still clutching his phone.

"Mr. Evans, you need to rest—"

His eyes remained closed, his face frighteningly pale.

......

At the first light of dawn, Evelyn called Dylan.

"Does your stomach still hurt? Want some porridge?"

Dylan answered groggily but snapped awake at her voice.

"Evelyn!"

"Your porridge last time was amazing. I've been craving it every day..."

She didn't expose his lie, simply telling him to come pick it up at noon.

Between her and Nathan, this bowl of porridge was all that remained of their connection.

......

Nathan's stomach condition gradually improved.

Chloe unfailingly delivered homemade porridge each day.

"Leave it there," he'd always say.

Today was no different. As Chloe set down the thermos, she leaned against his shoulder.

"Darling, you're finally better. I couldn't sleep these past few days worrying about you."

Nathan gave a faint smile before suddenly asking, "Don't you have classes?"

"I took leave to be with you." She pouted. "You're more important than anything."

Nathan's mind drifted to the past.

That year on his birthday, he'd wanted to take Evelyn to the beach. But she'd insisted on attending her last class.

He'd given her the silent treatment for three days.

In the end, he was the one who apologized first.
###Chapter 46

She focused intently on the lecture, taking meticulous notes. He focused intently on watching her.

Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating her profile. Her eyelashes cast delicate shadows across her cheeks.

Nathan Evans was momentarily transported to the past.

Back then, she had been just as diligent—except her gaze would frequently drift toward him, her eyes sparkling like starlight.

Now she wouldn't even spare him a glance.

"What are you thinking about?" Chloe Valentine's voice snapped him out of his reverie.

Nathan averted his eyes. "Business matters. Don't come to the office these next few days."

Chloe's smile froze.

The moment she stepped out of the villa, she dialed Julian Roscente's number.

"Julian, Nathan seems upset lately. Is it about the hospital—"

"Evelyn? She only brought him congee twice." Julian hung up abruptly.

Chloe clenched her phone, her nails digging crescent moons into her palm.

The next day at the library.

"Stay away from Nathan Evans!" Chloe loomed over Evelyn Langley, who was reviewing her notes.

Evelyn didn't look up. "Relax. I have zero interest in him."

That evening.

Ryan Clementson beamed at Evelyn's unexpected invitation. "Cooking together again? Fantastic!"

Their laughter echoed as they walked down the narrow alley.

A black Maybach screeched to a halt at the alley's entrance.

Nathan's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel as he tracked their retreating figures.

Moss-covered walls, peeling paint, the damp scent of mildew hanging thick in the air.

Dylan Lowell's words echoed in his mind: "The place she lives... it's terrible."

His chest constricted painfully.

Silently, he followed them into the shadows.
###Chapter 47

Ryan Clementson truly lived up to being Professor Eleanor Roland's most prized student.

Though his research focus differed from Evelyn Langley's, their academic discussion flowed with surprising harmony.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with excitement.

She was preparing for her graduate school entrance exams. While she had mastered the fundamentals, cutting-edge research remained unfamiliar territory.

Absorbing vast amounts of literature wasn't an overnight task.

As a current graduate student, Ryan naturally held an advantage over Evelyn, who had been away from academia for years.

Nearby, Nathan Evans stared at the pair, his knuckles whitening from tension.

She had been so cold toward him, refusing to meet despite his pleas. Yet here she was, radiant with smiles for another man.

The dining table was laden with exquisitely prepared dishes.

Ryan had heard of Evelyn's culinary skills, but the feast still left him speechless.

"All this...just for us?"

Evelyn placed the final dish on the table. "After all your help, it's the least I could do."

Ryan's ears tinged pink. "Honestly, I didn't do much. You're a remarkably quick learner."

During their study sessions, he'd witnessed her rapid progress firsthand.

She grasped concepts instantly, never needing explanations repeated.

"It wasn't just the tutoring. I'm most grateful for those rare academic papers you helped me access."

Ryan's eyes widened in realization. "So that's why you've been buried in research..."

Now he understood Professor Roland's high regard for her.

As night deepened, Ryan rose to leave.

Evelyn walked him downstairs, taking out the trash along the way.

"Thank you for dinner. Everything was incredible."

"My pleasure."

"So..." Ryan scratched his head. "Library tomorrow?"

"Sure."

At that moment, Adrian Klein returned from the lab, his brow still furrowed in concentration.

"Professor Klein!" Ryan immediately straightened. "You live here too?"

Adrian glanced up, noticing Evelyn and a young man by the entrance.

His gaze lingered briefly on Ryan's face, recognizing him vaguely.

"Life Sciences?"

"Yes! I took your Physics Fundamentals course last semester."

"Hmm."

Evelyn opened her mouth to greet him, but Adrian's attention never shifted her way.

Ryan stepped aside as Adrian walked past without another word.

"I can't believe Professor Klein lives here!" Ryan whispered excitedly. "His classes are impossible to get into—my roommate couldn't register this term..."

On the stairwell landing, Adrian glanced back at their retreating figures.

That student...Ryan Clementson, wasn't it?

First time he'd seen anyone visiting Evelyn's apartment. Boyfriend?

He shook his head with self-mockery. None of his business.

After seeing Ryan off, Evelyn turned down an alley to dispose of the garbage.

Suddenly, a dark figure seized her wrist.

Her body tensed for defense—until that familiar, caustic voice hissed:

"Quite the little overachiever now, aren't you, Evelyn Langley?"
###Chapter 48

Nathan's voice turned icy as his knuckles whitened around Evelyn's wrist. "Who was that man who just dropped you off? What were you two doing upstairs for so long?"

Evelyn's smile froze. A sharp pain shot through her wrist as she tried to pull away, but his grip only tightened.

"Let go!"

"Answer me first."

She winced. "None of your business."

"Is it so wrong for an ex to care about his former girlfriend's private life?"

A hollow laugh escaped her lips, her eyes glinting with frost. "So you do remember you're my ex." She tilted her chin up. "Then what right do you have to interrogate me?"

Nathan's Adam's apple bobbed. "...I was just passing by."

Before he could finish, angry muttering erupted from the alley entrance. An elderly man in a tank top waved a palm-leaf fan. "Who the hell parked their sports car blocking the alley? Think this is your private garage? Kids these days..."

Evelyn's gaze landed on the familiar silver Porsche. A bitter smirk curled her lips.

She wrenched her hand free and tossed her trash bag into the bin. "Even if I dated ten men at once, it wouldn't be your concern." Her hair swung decisively as she turned. "Do I need to teach you how to spell 'breakup'?"

"Your new flames or old flames don't matter to me, and my love life is none of your business." She paused. "Let's pretend we never met."

"However you found this place, don't come again." Her voice softened to a whisper. "Don't let your current girlfriend misunderstand."

"If you've chosen to go public with your relationship, then take responsibility till the end."

Evelyn thought of that girl—Chloe Valentine. Barely twenty. She shouldn't repeat Evelyn's mistakes.

Everyone pays for their choices. Nathan chose someone new. She chose to walk away.

Nathan stood rooted to the spot.

Evelyn strode into the apartment building without a backward glance.

Watching her slender figure disappear, his chest constricted as if squeezed by an invisible hand. Something vital was slipping through his fingers—when he opened his palm, only empty air remained.

"...Is it really over this time?"

"Yes."

"You said that last time too..."

Past arguments flickered through his mind like a zoetrope. But this was different. Her terrifying calm suggested she truly meant to carve "Nathan Evans" from her life completely.

His hand twitched midair before freezing.

What right did the one who let go first have to beg her to stay?

Leaning against her front door, Evelyn listened as the sports car's engine roar faded into the distance.

This long-overdue farewell had finally reached its end.

......

Nathan remained statue-still until the elderly man threatened to call a tow truck, forcing him to leave with a stormy expression.

"So it's your car? Young man, are you deaf? I've been shouting for half an hour—"

The silver Porsche tore through the night, screeching to a halt twenty minutes later before a villa.

Mrs. Watson dropped her soup ladle in alarm as Nathan stormed past the living room, his heavy footsteps pounding up the stairs.

The elderly housekeeper shook her head at the slammed bedroom door—what tantrum was the young master throwing now?
###Chapter 49

Nathan Evans flung open the bedroom door.

He tore through the wardrobe in a frenzy before storming into Evelyn Langley's private walk-in closet. All the designer bags, clothes, watches, and jewelry he'd given her remained perfectly arranged.

Not a single item was missing.

His gaze locked onto a cherry charm bracelet.

His breathing turned ragged. Bloodshot veins appeared in his eyes.

This was the birthday gift he'd brought back from Paris during their third year together.

Cherry. Cherish.

When he'd clasped it around her wrist, he'd whispered she was the most precious person in his life.

Evelyn had smiled until her eyes crinkled like crescent moons. She'd barely taken it off since.

Now it lay abandoned in the jewelry box like a discarded vow.

Nathan staggered and collapsed onto the bed.

Finally, he understood. Evelyn wasn't throwing a tantrum.

She'd truly left him.

......

A thunderous crash echoed from downstairs.

Mrs. Watson nearly dropped her cleaning rag in fright. She rushed upstairs.

As she turned the corridor, she collided with Nathan charging out of the closet. The man's expression was terrifyingly dark, his aura suffocating.

"Young master—"

Before she could finish, he brushed past without a glance, vanishing down the stairs.

Mrs. Watson peered into the closet and gasped.

The jewelry cabinet lay shattered. Unworn couture gowns with tags still attached littered the floor. Shards of glass glittered coldly across the Persian rug under the lights.

Remembering the spoiled porridge turning rancid in the kitchen, Mrs. Watson felt dizzy.

This household was falling apart!

......

The bar pulsed with neon lights.

Couples swayed intimately on the dance floor while Nathan sat alone in a corner. Whiskey after whiskey burned down his throat, doing nothing to extinguish the fire in his chest.

The shifting lights accentuated his razor-sharp jawline. Several women eyed him hungrily until one in a spaghetti strap dress gathered her courage.

"Such a shame to drink alone..."

She leaned forward deliberately, showcasing her cleavage.

Nathan lifted his eyelids. "Get lost."

The woman recoiled at his glare and fled.

The bottle emptied quickly.

As he signaled for another, a familiar silhouette flashed through the crowd.

Nathan lunged forward, grabbing the woman's wrist. "Ev—"

She turned—a heavily made-up face breaking into a flirtatious smile. "Buy me a drink, handsome?"

Not her.

Evelyn would never smile like that.

He released her, voice hoarse. "Wrong person."

He turned to leave when she yanked his sleeve. "Playing hard to get—"

"Let go." His gaze turned glacial.

She immediately released him, muttering, "Freak..."

Nathan snatched his jacket and headed for the exit when someone blocked his path.

"Nate!" Julian Roscente slung an arm around his shoulders. "Didn't know you were here! The guys are in the VIP lounge—come on!"
###Chapter 50

Nathan Evans pressed his temples. "No more drinks. You guys carry on."

Julian Roscente arched an eyebrow as he watched Nathan walk away.
Nathan never missed these gatherings. Tonight was unusual.
Could it be... he'd gotten back together with Evelyn Langley?
Of course. Newly reunited couples had no interest in partying.

"Julian, what's the hold-up? We're waiting on you," someone called from the stairwell.
Julian shook off his thoughts and rejoined the boisterous crowd.

......

The villa was silent, the clock ticking past ten.
Mrs. Watson had already tidied the master bedroom and walk-in closet, arranging Evelyn's personal belongings neatly in a corner.

Nathan pivoted and pushed open the study door.
The floor-to-ceiling bookshelves were packed with biology textbooks.
Though Evelyn had abandoned grad school, she'd never stopped studying.
Each book was a treasure she'd hunted down—some out of print, others expensive imports.

He remembered how she'd present each rare find like a prized offering.
Her eyes would sparkle, lips curling in an irrepressible smile...

Nathan's gaze swept the shelves—then narrowed.

A rustling sound came from downstairs.
Mrs. Watson jumped when Nathan suddenly appeared as she carried out the trash.

"Let me borrow your phone."
She instinctively clutched her pocket. "Sir, you broke my last one—"
"You got a replacement."
"But—it's brand new..." Her face fell.

Nathan frowned impatiently. "I'll have two latest models delivered tomorrow."
Mrs. Watson beamed and handed it over.

The call connected. Before the other person could speak, Nathan said coldly:
"If we're done, clean out your junk tomorrow. I won't wait."

Evelyn froze before realizing he meant her books.
"...Fine."
The dial tone pierced the silent study.

Evelyn stared at her phone, then dialed Sophia Laurent.
"Sophia, can you help me move my books tomorrow?"
"Absolutely! Those are your life's work—no way that jerk keeps them!" Sophia fumed. "I'll pick you up."

Yet the next morning, Adrian Klein stood at Evelyn's door.
Rarely dressed in a white tee and light-wash jeans, his tousled bangs and lean frame made him look like a college student.

"Where's Sophia?" Evelyn blinked.
Adrian adjusted his glasses. "She pulled an all-nighter. Still asleep."
Evelyn understood—probably gaming until dawn.

"Thanks for stepping in." She smiled ruefully.
###Chapter 51

The air in the silent car felt frozen. Adrian Klein's fingers tightened slightly around the steering wheel as his peripheral gaze caught Evelyn Langley's tense profile in the passenger seat.

The black Mercedes glided smoothly along the ring road, deliberately moving at a reduced speed. Adrian adjusted the air conditioning two degrees warmer but made no attempt to break the heavy silence.

The gates of the villa district slowly opened. Old Mr. Thompson, the security guard, leaned out. "Miss Langley? You're finally back!"

Evelyn forced a weak smile, her eyes fixed on the familiar tree-lined avenue outside. Adrian noticed her clenched fists and quietly parked the car in front of the villa.

"I won't be long," she said hoarsely, unbuckling her seatbelt.

Adrian frowned. "Those books are heavy."

"Unnecessary." She pushed the door open and strode toward the three-story villa without looking back.

When the doorbell rang, Mrs. Watson was preparing lunch in the kitchen. She hurried to answer, her eyes widening in surprise. "Miss Langley!"

"I came to collect some things," Evelyn murmured, though her gaze drifted past the housekeeper, landing on the spiral staircase.

Nathan Evans leaned against the railing in a silk robe, swirling half a glass of whiskey. The amber liquid refracted harsh light under the sun.

"Alone?" He sneered. "Those books will take you at least three trips."

Evelyn walked straight to the study. "Don't trouble yourself."

The study carried a faint scent of cedar. She efficiently packed pre-sorted books into a woven bag, never once glancing at Nathan, who lounged against the bookshelf.

Sweat trickled down her temple. As she slid the final book into the bag, Nathan suddenly erupted, kicking over a nearby footstool.

"Evelyn!" He seized her wrist. "For these worthless books, you finally step foot in this house?"

"Let go!" She winced, struggling, but his grip only tightened.

Dark fury churned in his eyes. "What the hell am I to you?"

"That's my question!" Evelyn jerked her head up. "Who disappears for weeks without a word? Who ends a relationship via text?"

She yanked her hand free but stumbled backward. The sofa caught her legs, sending her tumbling into the cushions.

Nathan loomed over her, breathing heavily. His gaze dropped to her flushed lips, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Eve..." His voice roughened with that familiar warmth.

Evelyn turned her face away from his approaching kiss, palms pressing against his chest. "Nathan Evans! We're over!"
###Chapter 52

Nathan Evans shoved Evelyn Langley onto the couch, his fingers roughly grabbing her collar.

Evelyn clutched the hem of her shirt, her knuckles turning white. "Stop..."

Her voice was hoarse, like sandpaper scraping against wood, trembling with broken desperation—a cornered animal.

Nathan's eyes darkened as he yanked up her skirt.

Evelyn struggled wildly. "Have you lost your mind, Nathan? There are so many women waiting for you. Why do this to me?"

"I can call Chloe Valentine for you—"

"Shut up!"

Nathan stared at her reddened eyes, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Stop pretending. Every inch of you has already been mine."

"You're disgusting!"

He gripped her chin. "Who else would want you? Used goods."

Tears blurred her vision. Evelyn stared at his familiar-yet-strange face, her heart splitting in two.

"What are you looking at?" Nathan sneered, leaning in to kiss her.

The sound of fabric tearing was deafening.

She trembled with sobs while he laughed cruelly.

The difference in their strength was staggering.

It was like being bitten by a rabid dog...

Just as she gave up resisting, the weight on her vanished.

A dark figure lunged forward, throwing Nathan aside. He staggered and crashed into the coffee table.

Adrian Klein had heard the commotion downstairs and rushed up in seconds.

When he pushed the door open, he saw Evelyn disheveled on the couch, her face streaked with tears.

His mind went blank.

"Don't be afraid." He swiftly draped his suit jacket over her, his voice deep and steady.

Evelyn's gaze was unfocused, her entire body shaking.

"Evelyn!" Adrian cupped her face. "Look at me. You're safe now."

"Evelyn!"

Only on the third call did she snap back to reality. "P-Professor Klein..."

He patted her back gently. "It's over."

The dam broke. She nodded, gripping his sleeve tightly.

Nathan's voice dripped with malice. "Well, well. The backup plan comes to the rescue?"

Before he could finish, Adrian's fist smashed into his face.
###Chapter 53

Nathan's fist sliced through the air toward Adrian.

"Looking to die?" His voice was hoarse with rage, eyes blazing. "When I was with her, you were still—"

Adrian caught the punch effortlessly. While Nathan seethed, he remained eerily calm—only the glacial glint in his eyes betrayed his fury.

"What are you?" Adrian's tone could freeze hell. "A clingy ex? Or..."

A razor-edged pause.

"A criminal?"

Nathan's face drained of color.

"You bastard—" He strained against Adrian's grip.

The physicist didn't budge.

"Enough." Evelyn tightened her coat, rising on unsteady legs. Her whisper barely carried as she avoided Nathan's gaze, addressing Adrian instead. "Sorry you had to see this."

Adrian's brow furrowed. "Should I call the police?"

A long silence. She shook her head. "Let's go."

Pointing to a burlap sack on the ground: "Could you grab that?"

One hand lifted the sack; the other steadied her. As they walked away, the crash of a shattered flowerpot echoed behind them.

——

Wind whipped through the car window as Evelyn watched the villa shrink in the rearview mirror. Six years ago, she'd moved in dreaming of endless tomorrows.

Now it was over.

The gusts tangled her hair as she leaned back, eyes closing in exhaustion.

Adrian didn't interrupt. Pulling over, he drummed silent fingers on the steering wheel while she pretended to sleep.

"Thank you," she murmured without opening her eyes.

A sideways glance. "No trouble."

Her lips pressed together. The gratitude wasn't just for today—but for the quiet dignity he'd always shown her.

Grrr—

Her ears burned pink at the stomach's betrayal.

Adrian's mouth quirked. "Harvard dining hall. Hungry?"

Twenty minutes later, they stepped into the familiar campus cafeteria.
###Chapter 54

Harvard's dining halls were always a campus landmark.

The three main buildings formed a triangular layout, offering cuisines from every corner of the world—even Southeast Asian curries and Italian pasta could be found here.

During her student days, Evelyn Langley had loved the Chinese food counter on the second floor.

The round-faced lady there would always smile and give her an extra scoop of meat.

Three years later, the counter remained unchanged, and even the students in line looked familiar.

Standing at the end of the queue, her heartbeat inexplicably quickened.

The lady took the tray without looking up, but her eyes lit up the moment she recognized Evelyn.

"Sweetheart, long time no see."

Adrian Klein stood behind her, watching as the lady's wrist tilted slightly—the portion of braised pork was clearly excessive.

"Still tastes the same?" the lady asked while serving.

Evelyn's nose tingled.

"Even better than I remembered."

They chose a table by the window.

Sunlight streamed through the glass, glistening on the sweet and sour ribs.

"Back then, if I missed meal hours because of experiments, she'd always save me a drumstick."

Evelyn picked up a rib.

"At the time, I thought the greatest happiness was having a warm meal amid cold test tubes."

Adrian noticed a faint scar on her fingertip.

"From the lab?"

"Yeah, a glass cut sophomore year."

She unconsciously rubbed the mark.

"I bled so much—Sophia carried me to the infirmary."

The lakeside breeze carried the scent of lotus leaves.

Evelyn sat on a stone bench, her skirt fluttering slightly.

"Broke up?" Adrian suddenly asked.

She froze, then relaxed.

"Six years... undone by 'incompatibility.'"

In the distance, a student cycled past, the bell jingling.

Adrian took off his glasses to clean them.

"Does it still hurt?"

Only then did Evelyn notice the bruise on her wrist had darkened to purple.

The ointment he handed her smelled of mint, cooling as it seeped into her skin.

On the way back, the sky blazed with sunset.

In the rearview mirror, the library's spire gradually vanished into dusk.

Holding the box of books, she heard him say, "I'm off tomorrow."

Before the elevator doors fully closed, she saw him standing at the edge of light and shadow—his white shirt dyed honey-gold by the fading sun.
###Chapter 55

Evelyn Langley carefully carried the bag of books into her bedroom.

She wiped each volume clean before arranging them neatly on the shelf.

Sweat dampened the back of her shirt.

The shower stopped running.

Wrapped in a towel, she noticed the ointment on the coffee table.

The mint-scented balm brought cool relief as she applied it to her bruises.

The clock struck ten.

Though she'd planned to read, a throbbing pain pulsed at her temples.

Her eyelids grew heavy, and she collapsed onto the bed in deep slumber.

At three AM, nightmares struck.

Nathan Evans' twisted face loomed larger in her dreams.

She struggled desperately but couldn't escape his icy grip.

"No!"

Evelyn jolted upright, her pajamas soaked with sweat.

With trembling hands, she grabbed her phone and dialed Sophia Laurent.

The endless ringing yielded no answer.

Light seeped through the curtains from the neighboring balcony.

After much hesitation, she texted Adrian Klein:
"Are you awake?"

Her phone screen flickered.

Just as she was about to give up, a reply appeared:
"Yeah."

Another message followed immediately:
"Look outside."

Evelyn drew back the curtains.

A sky full of stars glittered like diamonds against the night.

Her phone vibrated repeatedly.
"See that angular constellation? That's Gemini."
"In Greek myths, one twin brought disaster while the other protected humanity."
"The younger brother sacrificed himself to redeem the elder."

Evelyn traced the star patterns on her screen.

Ten minutes later, a final message arrived:
"Finding such a rare constellation must have cheered you up?"

A smile tugged at her lips.
"Thank you. I feel better now."

In his study, Adrian chuckled at her reply.

As he returned to work, another message popped up:
"I enjoyed stargazing with you. Goodnight."

Meanwhile, lights blazed in the Evans mansion.

Nathan glared at the empty bookshelf, his mind replaying Evelyn leaning against Adrian.

A glass shattered against the wall.

His phone chimed repeatedly with messages from Chloe Valentine:
"Miss you, Nathan."
"Date next week?"
"Can I come over now?"

Nathan swiped away the notifications irritably.

Moonlight revealed two balconies separated by careful distance.

One bathed in starlight, the other simmering with dark energy.
###Chapter 56

Nathan Evans's finger froze on the screen. Evelyn Langley's words "clean break" cut through him like a blade, severing all hope. If she wanted to start over, why should he cling to the past?

"Come here."

Chloe Valentine huddled under her blankets, nearly gasping when the message appeared. She checked it three times before believing Nathan had actually texted her.

She'd dropped countless hints—even paraded around in lingerie—but he'd never reacted. Tonight's summons felt like a miracle.

"Going out this late?" a roommate mumbled sleepily.

Chloe's fingers trembled as she fastened her lace bra. "He wants me."

"Who else could make our campus belle run out at midnight?" another teased.

Her cheeks burned. Nathan had never even held her hand, making her fear their relationship would crumble. After tonight, everything would change.

The taxi stopped at the villa. The gates swung open before she could knock. A strong hand yanked her inside.

Nathan pinned her against the wall, his kiss rough and desperate. Chloe fumbled to respond, her heart pounding wildly.

He lifted her effortlessly and tossed her onto the sofa. His scorching hands made quick work of her buttons. She melted under his touch.

When he tugged at her bra strap, he suddenly stilled.

"Nathan?" Chloe blinked up at him.

He jerked away, flinging her jacket at her. "Get up."

Ice flooded her veins. "Did I do something wrong?"

She reached for him, but he seized her wrist. His glare turned arctic. "Don't make me repeat myself."

The chauffeur found her still shaking. One last glance at Nathan's silhouette by the window—even his posture radiated distance.

A cigarette glowed in the dark as Nathan called Julian Roscente. "Find me a clean woman."

"You're insane," Julian pushed away his companion. "Does Evelyn know?"

"She doesn't need to." Nathan crushed the cigarette. "Now."
###Chapter 57

"Changed your mind?" Julian Roscente sprang up from the couch. "Finally dropping the saint act?"

Nathan Evans didn't even grace him with a glance.

"Just a fling. Not my first."

Julian grinned, clapping loudly. "That's more like it! I'll set it up—clean and simple."

Within five minutes of hanging up, an address popped up on Nathan's phone.

Golden Palace Club, Room 1080

Been watching this one. Still untouched. Lucky you.

Nathan scoffed, grabbing his jacket as he strode out.

The night was ink-black. Pleasure waited for no one.

By noon the next day, Julian emerged from the adjacent suite, rubbing his temples.

He'd drunk himself into a stupor and slept till midday.

As the Roscente heir, he kept a permanent presidential suite in the family hotel—sprawling enough to fit three average apartments.

Pouring himself a glass of red wine, he shuffled toward the living room.

The moment he pushed the door open, a woman's robed back came into view. Red marks dotted her exposed shoulders and neck.

She turned toward Nathan with tear-filled eyes, only for the man to coldly toss a wad of cash at her before dismissing her.

Nathan glanced up, meeting Julian's amused gaze, and leisurely lit a cigarette.

"Damn, she was about to cry," Julian tutted. "No mercy at all?"

Nathan exhaled smoke. "Payment settled. No need for theatrics."

"Fair." Julian swirled his wine. "Join me?"

"Pass."

Only a drunk like Julian would drink this early.

Wreathed in smoke, Nathan's expression remained detached—no trace of post-indulgence satisfaction.

Julian leaned in. "Out all night. Won’t Evelyn Langley come looking?"

Nathan's brow twitched. "What is she to me? Since when does she dictate my life?"

Tch.

Still not reconciled.

"Then why not Chloe Valentine?" Julian waggled his eyebrows. "Fresh grass right there, yet you go picking wildflowers?"

That girl had curves and looks—maybe not Evelyn’s elegance, but youth had its charms.

Nathan blew a smoke ring. "Good girls mean trouble."

"Wasn’t Evelyn a good girl too?" Julian smirked. "The type to cling forever."

Nathan’s fingers stilled. "Took six years to shake her off."

Julian burst out laughing.

"Classic Nathan Evans."
###Chapter 58

October sunlight streamed through the curtains as Evelyn Langley's phone chimed with a new email notification.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she opened it.

The subject line read: "SCI Journal Preliminary Review Approval."

"Oh my God!" Sophia Laurent's shriek nearly shattered the phone speaker. "Evelyn! You got into an SCI journal!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, suppressing a smile. "It's just the first round. There are two more reviews."

"With your skills, it's guaranteed!" Sophia squealed. "We're celebrating tonight—my treat!"

"I should be the one treating you."

"Stop arguing. I'll pick you up in thirty minutes!"

After hanging up, Evelyn opened her closet. She selected a pale blue floral dress with a modest V-neck that accentuated her delicate collarbones.

Her uncut hair now reached her shoulders. She tied it back with a matching ribbon.

A car horn honked outside.

Grabbing her purse, Evelyn descended the stairs. At the alley entrance, Sophia's car came into view—but her gaze caught on another familiar figure.

Adrian Klein was walking alongside a young man with a clean buzz cut, his smile radiant in the sunlight. They seemed engrossed in an academic discussion, with Adrian nodding occasionally.

"Adrian!" Sophia leaned out the car window.

He looked up. "What are you doing here?"

"Taking Evelyn to dinner." Sophia's eyes locked onto the stranger. "And this is...?"

"A visiting grad student with questions." Adrian instantly recognized his cousin's nosy tone.

Footsteps echoed from the stairwell.

Adrian adjusted his glasses. "You two go ahead. I need to return to the lab."

"Join us!"

"No."

As Evelyn rounded the corner, sunlight filtered through the lattice wall, casting dappled shadows across Adrian. His eyes behind the lenses seemed warmer.

"Your jacket..." she said softly. "I never got to return it."

She looked particularly fresh today, the floral skirt swaying with each step. Nude sandals emphasized her slender ankles.

Adrian blinked. "I've been busy. Just stopped by to grab something."

"Don't overwork yourself." Concern laced her voice.

As they passed each other, Evelyn's foot caught. She pitched forward.

Adrian spun around, his solid chest breaking her fall. His warm hands steadied her waist.

Dazed, Evelyn looked up, inhaling his faint pine scent.
###Chapter 59

His chin nearly brushed the top of her head. If he hadn't steadied her in time, she would have tumbled straight into his arms.

Evelyn jolted awake and took two quick steps back.

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed as he withdrew his arm. His voice was low. "Flats are safer."

She couldn't help laughing. "Thanks."

"Evelyn?" Sophia's voice carried from outside. "Is that you?"

Evelyn glanced toward the door. "I should go."

"Hmm."

Adrian clenched his fist. As he turned to climb the stairs, snippets of conversation drifted up from below.

"What took so long?"
"Minor mishap."
"Did you see my cousin?"

Sophia only knew her cousin lived in the area, unaware they were next-door neighbors.

Evelyn gave a soft affirmation.

Finding nothing unusual in her expression, Sophia changed the subject, pulling her into a debate about dinner venues. They settled on a new Thai restaurant.

"Those spoiled brats have no sense of boundaries," Sophia grumbled while slicing into mango sticky rice. "Someone ought to teach them a lesson."

Their social circle knew Sophia loved to party, so her sudden foray into arranged dates had become gossip fodder. The reluctant bachelors either acted arrogantly or made snide remarks, implying she should settle down.

"So I leaked their scandals." Sophia lifted her chin triumphantly. "Let's see who dares look down on me now."

Evelyn wasn't surprised. Her best friend had always believed in direct retribution. "No wonder the tabloids have been buzzing."

"Serves them right." Sophia sighed. "Even with my family background, I'm getting pressured to marry. It's exhausting."

She lowered her voice. "Actually, my aunt is more desperate—she keeps setting up blind dates for my cousin."

Evelyn froze. Adrian being matchmade?

She couldn't picture the aloof, dignified man in such situations.

"But he's rarely home, so Auntie's efforts are wasted." Sophia winked. "I do wonder what kind of woman would catch his eye."

The hallway scene flashed through Evelyn's mind—his reserved demeanor, yet how quickly he'd reached out when she nearly fell.

How fortunate the person who held his heart must be.

......
Time slipped away like sand through fingers.
Winter arrived in the blink of an eye.
Graduate entrance exams commenced as scheduled.
###Chapter 60

Winter in the northern city always carried a bone-chilling dampness. The weather forecast had warned of snow for a week, but only freezing rain arrived. By morning, a thin layer of ice had formed on the roads.

Evelyn Langley tightened her down jacket and wrapped her cashmere scarf twice around her neck. She had deliberately chosen slip-resistant snow boots and double-checked her exam admission ticket and stationery before stepping out.

Sophia Laurent had sworn the night before that she would wear a qipao to see Evelyn off to the exam. But now, she was most likely still curled up in bed catching up on sleep. Evelyn scanned the crowd outside the exam hall and, as expected, didn’t spot her.

This kind of friendship—one that didn’t require constant maintenance—was the most comforting. Even if months passed without contact, they could still meet again without any awkwardness.

When the two-hour exam ended, the other candidates around her were either elated or anxious. Evelyn handed in her paper calmly, then opened her umbrella and stepped into the fine winter drizzle.

"Evelyn?"

A familiar voice made her pause. Isabella Evans stood under the eaves of the building, her black coat making her complexion appear even paler.

It had been half a year since their last encounter—the incident that had ended in the hospital. Isabella’s gaze fell on the stationery bag in Evelyn’s hand. "You really came for the grad school entrance exam?"

"Yeah." Evelyn lifted the edge of her umbrella slightly. "Something I’ve always wanted to finish."

Isabella hesitated. She knew Evelyn had only started preparing after the breakup, with barely enough time to make it seem like a joke. And she, more than anyone, understood just how fierce the competition was at Harvard.

"My brother—" The words died on her lips. Isabella remembered Margaret Evans’ complaints that morning—how Nathan had been suffering from stomach problems lately, practically turning the hospital into a second home.

This winter, no one in the Evans family had been doing well.

The slanting rain dampened the hem of Isabella’s coat. As she studied Evelyn’s composed profile, a sudden realization struck her—this time, there really was no going back.
###Chapter 61

Evelyn caught the hidden meaning in her words and curved her lips slightly without further explanation.

Isabella flipped through the documents in her hands. "I remember you did your undergrad at Harvard? Applying for grad school there again?"

"Yes."

"Academic or professional track?"

"Academic."

"Which field?"

"Biomedical science."

Isabella's brows lifted in surprise at the overlap with her own chosen major. "Any particular advisor in mind?"

"Professor Roland," Evelyn answered frankly.

"Eleanor Roland?" Isabella's voice rose sharply as she recalled encountering Evelyn doing housework at the professor's home last time. Her expression turned peculiar. "You don't actually think cleaning her house a few times will make her break protocol to accept you, do you?"

Evelyn's fingers paused. "That was a special circumstance."

"Let me be honest—Professor Roland is notoriously strict in academic circles. She takes many doctoral students but very few master's candidates these days." Isabella adjusted her glasses. "I'm applying to her program too. You'd better change advisors while there's still time."

She felt she'd done more than enough.

"Thanks for the advice." Evelyn gave a slight nod and turned to leave.

Isabella stood frozen. That was it?

......

Warm air rushed through the subway car as Evelyn's frost-reddened fingers finally regained feeling.

Her phone buzzed in her bag. Seeing the caller ID, the corners of her eyes crinkled. "Professor."

"How was the exam?" Professor Roland's voice held a smile, as if making small talk.

"Finished all the questions."

"You've always been reliable." The professor sounded pleased. Evelyn's undergraduate transcript had been flawless.

"Don't linger outside in this cold. Head back early."

"I'm on the subway now. I heard your leg pain flared up again? I bought some new medicated patches—I'll bring them this weekend."

Eleanor's old leg injury from her youth acted up whenever the weather turned damp. Physical therapy two years ago had helped considerably, but the pain had returned this winter.

"Wonderful. I'll make soup for you this weekend."

Evelyn checked the station display as the train approached.

After hanging up, she merged into the rush-hour crowd exiting the train. Stepping out of the station, an icy wind slammed into her, making her stagger back.

Suddenly, steady hands gripped her shoulders. The familiar scent of cedar enveloped her as she looked up into Adrian's smiling eyes.

"What a coincidence?" Her own eyes sparkled with amusement.

"Came back to get some documents. The roads are too icy to drive." He drew her closer. "Perfect timing to take you home."
###Chapter 62

The biting wind howled as Evelyn Langley tightened her scarf and stepped out of the exam hall.

"How was it?" Adrian Klein took the folder from her hands.

"Better than expected." She exhaled a white puff of breath, rubbing her reddened fingertips together.

Dusk settled around them as streetlights flickered on one by one, casting warm halos on the snow-covered ground.

The sweet aroma of roasted sweet potatoes wafted through the commercial street. Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Wait here."

Adrian watched her dart toward the food stall, her black coat fluttering in the wind.

"Try this." She returned with two golden-brown sweet potatoes, steam rising in the cold air.

The scalding heat made her gasp, but she couldn't resist taking a small bite. The sugary sweetness melted on her tongue, and she closed her eyes in contentment.

"Sweet?"

Adrian nodded. The warmth radiating from his palms carried a comforting sweetness he'd never experienced before.

"I'm an expert at picking sweet potatoes." She waved her treat triumphantly, a sticky smear of syrup at the corner of her mouth.

His gaze lingered on her wind-chapped nose. The sudden urge to wipe away that sugary spot made his throat tighten. He looked away instead.

The motion-sensor light flickered on as they entered the foyer. A wave of warmth greeted them, and Evelyn sighed in relief.

While organizing her books, she spotted the German original edition still buried in the stack. A handmade bookmark peeked between the pages.

Adrian was drying his hair when the knock came. Water droplets trailed down his neck and disappeared beneath his collar, the crisp scent of mint shampoo lingering in the air.

"Your book." Evelyn's gaze caught on his damp hair before quickly darting away. "My notes might be messy..."

He flipped through the pages and found a tiny doodle of a cheering stick figure in the corner. A smile touched his eyes.

"That's just—" She reached for the bookmark, her fingertips accidentally brushing against his cool palm. She recoiled as if shocked.

"I'd like to treat you to dinner." Her ears burned. "As... thanks."

Adrian studied her flushed cheeks. "Home-cooked is fine."

"Tomorrow then?" Her eyes brightened. "I'll get your favorite perch."

As he nodded, a water droplet fell from his hair and landed on the back of her hand. The sudden chill sent a tremor through her.

The next afternoon, Evelyn returned with two grocery bags brimming with ingredients. Sunlight broke through the clouds, casting diamond-shaped patterns on the kitchen tiles.

The doorbell rang as she was filleting the fish. Adrian effortlessly tied an apron around his waist, rolling up his sleeves to reveal well-defined forearms.

"Your turn." She handed him a basket of vegetables, her hair grazing his chin as she turned away.

Amid the sound of running water, he caught her humming off-key. The rhythmic chopping, the steaming pot fogging up the window—it reminded him of an ongoing experiment in the lab.

When two reagents meet, they too create this same inexplicable warmth.
###Chapter 63

Weekend sunlight filtered through the clouds, carrying the gentle warmth of early spring.

Evelyn returned from her morning jog with beads of sweat glistening at her temples. After a hot shower, she changed into fresh clothes and hurried out with a medicine bag.

"To Lakeside Villas, please." She slid into the taxi, cradling freshly brewed herbal medicine.

Professor Roland's front door was slightly ajar, the aroma of medicinal herbs wafting from the kitchen.

"Professor, I've left the medicine on the table." Evelyn set down the thermos gently. "Drink it while it's hot."

The professor peered from the study, wrinkling her nose. "That smell..."

"Bitter medicine works best." Evelyn smiled, pulling a paper box from her bag. "Have this with it."

Inside lay six neatly arranged mung bean cakes, their delicate sweetness instantly cutting through the medicinal bitterness.

"You..." The professor shook her head with a resigned chuckle, warmth flickering in her eyes.

They settled in the living room as tea steam curled between them.

"Have you considered the lab team selection for next semester?" The professor adjusted her glasses.

Evelyn's fingers stilled. "I heard the spots are limited."

"Five positions. Three are pre-assigned." The professor handed her a document. "The remaining two go to the most qualified."

The Ninhai Biotech logo on the cover made Evelyn's pupils contract.

"Direct PhD admission, or..." The professor paused meaningfully, "immediate placement in a top-tier lab."

Evelyn's knuckles whitened. She understood the opportunity's weight perfectly.

"Your theoretical foundation is solid." The professor sighed. "But your lab experience..."

Years had passed since she'd last worked at a lab bench. Rusty techniques and unfamiliar equipment were undeniable weaknesses.

"There's still time." The professor suddenly grasped her hand. "I believe in you."

Sunlight through the sheer curtains dappled their clasped hands with shifting patterns.

"I won't let you down." Evelyn heard the steel in her own voice.

That evening, she buried herself in research materials immediately after returning home. Columns of data and graphs swam before her eyes until deep night.

Just as her eyelids grew heavy, urgent knocking shattered the silence.

"Evelyn! Open up!"

Nathan's voice punched through the door, accompanied by insistent pounding.

Bang—Bang—
###Chapter 64

Three a.m. The pounding on the door was deafening.

Evelyn Langley curled under her blanket, fingers trembling. The shadows from that night at the villa still haunted her, and Nathan Evans' drunken aggression left her shaken.

"Evelyn!"

"I know you're home!"

His voice, thick with alcohol and stubbornness, sliced through the door.

She bit her lip hard, pressing a pillow over her head. But his voice clung like a persistent ghost.

Ten minutes passed. The banging didn't stop—it grew louder.

"Are you insane? It's the middle of the night!"

"I'm calling the cops!"

Neighbors' curses erupted around the hallway.

Barefoot on the cold floor, Evelyn yanked the door open.

"Nathan!" she hissed.

The man leaned against the doorframe, tie loose, eyes bloodshot.

"Finally," he smirked.

"Leave."

"Let me in."

"Never."

Nathan narrowed his eyes, raising his fist to strike the door again.

"Stop!" Evelyn seized his wrist. "What do you want?"

He shoved past her, reeking of whiskey.

She stumbled back until her spine hit the wall.

Nathan swayed, then dropped to one knee.

"Come back," he rasped.

"No."

"Six months. Isn't that enough?"

"We're over." Her fingers twisted in her nightgown.

He surged up, gripping her wrist. "Then why keep my things?"

Her pupils shrank.

"You went through my stuff?"

"Answer me!"

"Let go!" She struggled wildly.

His grip tightened, madness swirling in his gaze. "You still love me. Admit it."

"You're drunk."

"I'm not!" he roared. "How much longer will you torture me?"

Evelyn went still, her voice icy. "Poor memory, Mr. Evans. Weren't you the one who insisted on a clean break?"

Nathan froze.

She wrenched free, but he pinned her against the wall.

"Don't touch me!" Her voice shook.

His breath burned against her skin, bitter with whiskey.
###Chapter 65

Nathan froze in place. "You..."

Memories of that night at the villa flashed through Evelyn's mind. She instinctively took two steps back, her eyes filled with wariness. "Stop! Don't come any closer!"

"Evelyn..." A sharp pain pierced Nathan's chest. "About that night—"

"Enough!" she cut him off. "Please leave. There's nothing left to say."

The man's eyes reddened, his body stiff. "I'm sorry... I lost control. Let's stop fighting, okay? I shouldn't have said those hurtful things..."

"I just... missed you too much..."

"Come home with me..."

"Home?" Evelyn let out a cold laugh. "To be your secret lover?"

Nathan's voice was urgent. "If you agree, I'll break up with Chloe immediately."

She shook her head. "...Impossible."

"Evelyn..." He took a step forward, but she had already turned and rushed into the bedroom, slamming the door shut.

Late into the night, the apartment finally fell silent.

She quietly pushed the door open and found Nathan slumped against the wall, asleep.

Evelyn: "..."

Dawn broke.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting faint streaks across the living room.

The figure on the couch stirred. Nathan opened his eyes, a wave of dizziness washing over him.

He rubbed his temples, taking in the small but tidy rental apartment.

Evelyn stepped out of the bedroom.

Their eyes met, and Nathan froze. "...Evelyn?"

She sat at the dining table. "Do you remember what happened last night?"

He frowned, thinking, then shook his head.

Of course...

The sober version of him would never say those things.

A bitter smile tugged at Evelyn's lips.

"You made a scene outside my door until midnight. The neighbors complained. Mr. Evans, have some self-respect."

Nathan's head throbbed, but the pain in his chest was worse.

His gaze swept over the shabby apartment before he suddenly sneered. "You think I want to be in this dump? Don’t expect me to come begging again!"

He grabbed his coat and stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

At the alley entrance, he dialed Dylan. "Let’s grab a drink."

......

"Bro, you're still hung over and already hitting the bottle again?"

Dylan arrived at the bar to find Nathan drowning his sorrows alone, the stench of last night’s alcohol still clinging to him.

Nathan: "Shut up and drink."

Dylan raised his hands in surrender. "Fine, fine."

The bar was empty in broad daylight, making the scene awkward.

"Where are the others?"

"Julian’s getting lectured at home. Ethan’s been acting mysterious lately."

Nathan didn’t press further, downing another shot of hard liquor.

From afternoon until late at night.

Dylan called a car to haul the completely wasted Nathan back to his villa.

After settling the man, who kept murmuring "Evelyn" in his drunken stupor, Dylan sighed.

If you can’t let go, why keep torturing each other?
###Chapter 66

......

The living room still carried the faint scent of tobacco from Nathan Evans' visit yesterday.

Evelyn Langley spent the entire afternoon cleaning, even removing the sofa covers for washing. By the time she finished, evening had fallen. She decided to stay in and review her studies, completing two practice exams before setting her pen down.

For dinner, she made kimbap but miscalculated the portions, leaving over half uneaten.

After tidying the kitchen past eight, she planned to tackle one more exam before bed. Just as she set her alarm, her phone vibrated abruptly.

A friend request notification popped up.

The contact field clearly displayed: Ethan Winston.

Evelyn stared at the screen for several seconds. Though they often crossed paths at social gatherings, she and Ethan had virtually no private interactions.

After a brief hesitation, she accepted the request.

Thirty minutes passed with no message in the chat window.

Must have been a mistake. She set the phone aside and returned to her studies.

......

The bar's lights swirled hypnotically.

Ethan pocketed his phone as Dylan Lowell returned from dropping someone off. "She's home safe?"

Dylan took a swig of beer. "Almost ran into Mrs. Evans. Good thing I moved fast."

Margaret Evans had been frequenting Nathan's villa lately. Getting caught would mean endless questioning.

"By the way," Dylan continued, "you've been turning me down for weeks. What changed tonight?"

Ethan swirled his glass. "Finished some business."

"Wait!" Dylan slammed his drink down. "Didn't Evelyn finish her grad school exams?"

"Two days ago."

Dylan grinned. "You're keeping close tabs."

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted. "I have an excellent memory."

"Typical finance guy—detail-obsessed."

"Flattery will get you nowhere."

"You're not even pretending to be modest." Dylan clicked his tongue. "Six months and Nathan still hasn't patched things up with Evelyn? Ridiculous."

Ethan's tone remained even. "It's inevitable."

"True, they'll reconcile eventually." Dylan nodded sagely.

Ethan: "......"

"Speaking of which, you and Evelyn get along?"

Dylan immediately straightened. "Of course! She's made me her special nourishing porridge before. We're tight."

Ethan's eyes darkened slightly. "Finishing exams deserves celebration."

"How?" Dylan blinked.

"Take her to dinner? Might help create reconciliation opportunities."

Thinking of Nathan drowning his sorrows in alcohol, Dylan's eyes lit up. "Brilliant! Even if Evelyn's giving Nathan the cold shoulder, she wouldn't refuse me. I'll organize it—say it's to celebrate her exams, then..."

"Clever as ever." Ethan took a sip, hiding his smirk behind the glass.
###Chapter 67

Dylan Lowell tapped his phone screen a few times before dialing Evelyn Langley's number.

"Evelyn, how have you been?" His tone was lighthearted. "There's something I wanted to discuss with you..."

A soft exhale came through the line. After hearing his proposal, Evelyn fell silent.

Dylan immediately understood. "Just the two of us—strictly a friendly get-together. Nathan won't find out, I promise."

"...Alright." Evelyn finally relented.

Hanging up, Dylan smirked.

Step one of his plan was complete. As for whether an "accidental" encounter might occur later—well, that was beyond his control.

Ethan Winston rose from the couch, grabbing his jacket. "I'll go contact Julian."

"Perfect!" Dylan rubbed his hands together eagerly.

He could already picture himself being thanked as the matchmaker who reunited the couple.

......

Golden sunlight streamed through the windows of Golden Jade Restaurant, scattering flecks of gold across the floor.

Dylan had deliberately chosen a table by the window—strategically positioned for optimal "coincidental" visibility.

When Evelyn pushed through the door, he immediately stood and waved.

"Evelyn, over here!"

A server guided her to the table. Evelyn set her bag down and glanced around the restaurant.

"Congratulations on finishing your grad school exams." Dylan handed her a menu enthusiastically. "I ordered your favorites. Let's celebrate properly today."

As the most down-to-earth rich kid in Nathan's circle, Dylan had indeed helped Evelyn many times before.

"Thank you for always looking out for me." Evelyn offered a small smile.

Dylan waved a hand dramatically. "No need for formalities between us!"

Just then, a tall figure appeared beside their table.

"Dylan? What a coincidence."

Looking up, Dylan's smile froze.

Ethan stood there with one hand in his pocket—alone.

Dylan's eyes widened, silently demanding: Where's Nathan? What happened to the plan?

"Mind if I join you?" Ethan was already pulling out a chair, his gaze briefly skimming over Evelyn.

Dylan's cheek twitched. "O-of course not..."

Adjusting his cuffs with practiced elegance, Ethan asked casually, "Celebrating something special today?"

"Evelyn finished her grad school exams," Dylan answered through gritted teeth, his eyes screaming accusations.

Ethan turned to Evelyn as if noticing her for the first time. "Grad school? Which university?"

Dylan rolled his eyes internally: Nice acting.

"A University," Evelyn replied politely.

Ethan nodded. "Solid choice."
###Chapter 68

"Have you decided which university to apply to?"
"Harvard."
"What's your major?"
"Bioinformatics."

Ethan Winston raised an eyebrow. "An interdisciplinary field combining biology, mathematics, and computer science?"
Evelyn Langley looked at him with mild surprise. "You know about this?"
"Just took some introductory courses. I've always struggled to distinguish between Applied Life Sciences, Bioinformatics, and Biology."

Evelyn explained patiently, "Applied Life Sciences focuses on practical applications of biomolecules. Biology studies fundamental life phenomena. Bioinformatics uses computational methods to process biological data." She paused. "Was that too technical?"

Ethan pondered for a moment. "So in simple terms—Biology provides theoretical foundations, Applied Life Sciences handles practical operations, and Bioinformatics solves biological problems using computers?"

A flicker of astonishment crossed Evelyn's eyes. "That's an impressively accurate summary."
"You explained it well." Ethan's smile deepened. "I just translated the jargon into plain English."

Evelyn studied the man before her with renewed interest.
In her memory, Ethan Winston only frequented nightclubs and parties—the epitome of a playboy. She never expected him to engage in such specialized academic discourse.

It reminded her of Nathan Evans. After six years together, he couldn't even remember her major. Their relationship consisted of nightclub socializing and bedroom encounters.

Dylan Lowell, completely lost in the conversation, seized the opportunity to excuse himself when the check arrived.

Ethan glanced at his phone. "Dylan had an emergency. He asked me to see you home."
"No need, I'll take a cab."
"Allowing a lady to return alone isn't gentlemanly." He gave a slight bow. "The honor would be mine."

At the restaurant entrance, Ethan courteously opened the car door for her.
The interior fell silent. Evelyn gazed absently at the snowscape rushing past the window.
Ethan's peripheral vision caught her refined profile. Without the deliberate curls, her natural elegance shone through.

His grip tightened on the steering wheel as his eyes returned to the road ahead.
###Chapter 69

The night sky above Harbor Road glittered with countless lights as a thousand drones hovered like suspended stars, shifting formations in perfect synchronization.

This extravagant drone light show carried a six-figure price tag for just fifteen minutes of performance.

Ethan Winston's car happened to pass the prime viewing spot. He slowed down, pulling over to admire the shifting three-dimensional patterns through the windshield.

Evelyn Langley followed his gaze and was instantly mesmerized by the dazzling spectacle.

"Guess how many drones there are," Ethan suddenly asked.

"How could I possibly guess?" Evelyn blinked.

"Take a shot."

"Five hundred?"

"I'd say ninety-nine." Ethan's lips curved slightly. "It's a popular number for proposals."

As if on cue, the drones rearranged into glowing words: "Marry Me," shining brilliantly against the night sky.

Evelyn gasped, turning toward the observation deck where a sharply dressed man knelt on one knee with a bouquet of roses.

"You knew?"

Ethan pointed to the flowers hidden behind the man's back. "Details make all the difference."

Evelyn studied him with newfound interest. This seemingly carefree heir actually possessed remarkable perceptiveness.

Dinner conversation proved even more surprising. When discussing her finance major, his offhand analysis of several stock trends was startlingly accurate.

Nathan Evans' inner circle clearly had no ordinary members.

Her fingers tightened around her purse strap. She needed to distance herself from this world sooner rather than later.

"You can drop me at the alley entrance. Thanks for the ride."

Ethan pulled over smoothly, watching until her silhouette disappeared into the dimly lit passageway before turning around.

Two intersections later, Dylan Lowell's call came through.

"Where'd you go? I came back from the restroom and you'd vanished!"

Frustration colored Dylan's voice. He'd been cornered by his ex-girlfriend at the register, forced into an awkward reunion.

"Miss Langley had an emergency. I took her home," Ethan replied evenly.

"What about Nathan? Weren't we setting up a chance meeting?" Dylan pressed.

"Couldn't reach him. Probably busy with his new fling." Ethan's expression remained neutral.

After hanging up, he parked again and transferred money to an unfamiliar account.

The recipient called instantly: "Mr. Winston honors his agreements."

Dylan would have recognized his ex's voice immediately.

"Pleasure doing business," Ethan said coolly.

"Still curious though," the woman whispered, "Why pay so much just to delay Dylan for ten minutes?"

Ethan glanced at the receding alley in his rearview mirror and murmured, "Do you know why curiosity killed the cat?"
###Chapter 70

"Sorry."

"Take the money and keep your mouth shut."

......

Evelyn returned home and took a hot shower.

She towel-dried her damp hair, planning to review a couple of research papers before bed.

Just as she settled at her desk, her phone screen lit up.

A message from Ethan: You left your gloves in my car.

Attached was a photo of beige leather gloves—the exact pair she'd worn that day.

Only then did Evelyn remember. The car's heater had been too warm, so she'd casually removed them. Ethan had taken and set them aside, and she'd completely forgotten when exiting.

If it's convenient, I can return them to you sometime?

Evelyn hesitated before replying: How about sending your address? I'll arrange a courier.

Ethan responded swiftly: My building doesn't allow delivery personnel inside.

Alternatively, we could meet for coffee. I'm currently in Harvard's MBA program—heard you're an alum? If you don't mind showing me around campus...

Had it just been about the gloves, Evelyn would've politely declined.

But he'd framed it as a request for help.

She bit her lip.

Okay.

Next Friday at 11am work for you?

Evelyn sent a thumbs-up emoji.

......

That Friday, Ethan parked in the underground garage.

He walked to the designated café.

Tucked into a back alley near Harvard's rear gates, the shop's minimalist bohemian aesthetic made it a student favorite. Even on a weekday, the place was bustling.

Ethan chose a window seat.

Evelyn arrived five minutes late.

As she sat, a server brought menus.

Lazy jazz played overhead, the vinyl's faint crackle adding vintage texture.

"Iced Americano," Ethan closed his menu.

"Latte for me," Evelyn said.

From his briefcase, Ethan produced a kraft paper bag: "Your gloves."

"Thanks." Their fingers brushed as she took it, making her recoil slightly.

Ethan glanced around. The air smelled of roasted beans, the temperature perfectly balanced.

"Come here often?"

"Sometimes." Evelyn gazed outside.

The river had frozen over, willow branches dusted with last night's snow.

She often walked these banks when feeling low.

Ethan followed her sightline: "Lovely view."

His attention returned to her face: "This jazz piece is special—a 90s Miles Davis track. Rarely heard nowadays."

"You're quite knowledgeable."

"Only superficially." His lips quirked.

Evelyn recalled Dylan mentioning Ethan's mother was a renowned pianist.

But she didn't pry.

As their cups emptied, Ethan stood: "Shall we?"
###Chapter 71

Evelyn Langley carried a paper bag as she walked alongside Ethan Winston through Harvard University's campus.

Beneath the shade of sycamore trees, they strolled and chatted. Whether she brought up literature or art, Ethan always had insightful responses. His voice was warm, his words refined—like a gentle spring breeze.

As they turned past the academic building, Evelyn glimpsed a tall figure in her periphery.

Adrian Klein emerged from the lecture hall with teaching materials in his arms. He looked up and met Evelyn's bright gaze. His steps faltered slightly as his eyes swept over Ethan beside her.

"What a coincidence," Evelyn waved with a smile. "Just finished class?"

"Yes," Adrian nodded. "Heading to the lab." His gaze lingered on Ethan.

Evelyn quickly introduced them. "This is Ethan Winston." Then to Ethan, "This is Professor Adrian Klein."

The two men locked eyes. Ethan's lips curved slightly as he extended his hand. "I've heard much about you, Professor Klein."

Adrian shook his hand. "Likewise."

The air seemed to freeze. Evelyn studied their clasped hands, puzzled by how long the handshake lasted.

Finally, Adrian released first. "Excuse me." He gave Evelyn a nod before walking away.

Ethan watched his retreating figure. "You two are close?"

"Just friends," Evelyn replied casually.

That night, her phone screen lit up.

Ethan's message appeared: Thanks for being my guide today.

She typed back: No problem.

Switching off her phone, she sank into the fluffy bedding. Wrapped in the scent of sunshine, she soon drifted into dreams.

The next morning, Evelyn woke naturally to birds chirping outside. She stretched lazily.

The old neighborhood buzzed with life. Downstairs, Auntie Zhang walked her poodle and beamed at Evelyn. "You look radiant today, dear."

"Morning, Auntie," Evelyn smiled in return.

Two blocks away, steam rose from the entrance of a beloved breakfast diner. Pushing the door open, she spotted a familiar figure inside.

Tiptoeing closer, Evelyn suddenly tapped Adrian's shoulder and swiftly slid into the seat across from him.

"Why aren't you even surprised?" she grumbled.

Adrian sipped his soy milk leisurely. "You ambushed me the same way last Wednesday." He glanced at the golden retriever lounging by the door. "You're slower than Erbai."

Evelyn: "..."

"Here comes our girl!" The silver-haired proprietress greeted warmly. "The usual?"

"Yes, plus an extra side dish," Evelyn winked.

Soon, a bowl of steaming wontons arrived—translucent skins cradling pinkish minced pork, bobbing in rich bone broth. She blew on a spoonful, then noticed Adrian's unchanging order of soy milk and fried dough sticks.

"Want to try these?" She pushed two wontons toward him.

After a brief hesitation, Adrian picked one up and tasted it.

"Good?" Evelyn's eyes sparkled.

"Not bad."

She lifted her chin triumphantly. "My recommendations never miss."
###Chapter 72

Adrian Klein's lips curved slightly.

......

Dylan Lowell squinted through his cigarette smoke at Ethan Winston. "Ethan, your birthday's next month, right? How do you wanna celebrate this year? Wanna organize a racing event? Or charter a yacht?"

Julian Roscente perked up immediately. "How about hiring some models for entertainment?"

Both men turned expectantly toward Ethan.

When it came to extravagant parties, he always had the most creative ideas.

Who would've guessed this suited-up finance mogul partied harder than anyone behind closed doors?

"This year... just a small family gathering."

Dylan's eyes widened. "What?"

Julian nearly choked on his drink. "You're serious?"

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Problem?"

"Ethan, did someone put a curse on you?" Dylan reached dramatically for his forehead.

Julian looked utterly baffled. "Since when did you become so... domesticated?"

"Don't overthink it." Ethan scoffed. "The estate on Fifth Avenue. Invitations coming your way."

With that, he stood and left.

Dylan and Julian exchanged bewildered glances before simultaneously looking out the window—

Had the sun risen from the west today?

......

Evelyn Langley was in a meeting when Ethan's call came.

Her fingers stilled at the birthday invitation.

"Me?"

"Mhm."

She pressed her lips together.

Nathan Evans would undoubtedly attend Ethan's party. She wanted no further entanglement.

"Just some old friends gathering. Dylan's coming. Don't you want to see him?" Ethan's voice turned teasing at her hesitation. "Or... are you avoiding someone?"

Her grip tightened on the phone.

"Nathan and I are over."

"All the more reason to come." Ethan chuckled. "Address sent. Don't be late."

The call ended abruptly.

......

On the birthday evening, the estate glittered with decorations.

Nathan arrived last with Chloe Valentine on his arm.

She helped remove his overcoat for the attendant before linking arms with him intimately.

Fifth Avenue estates were priceless—Ethan's property alone had cost eight figures to renovate.

Passing through meticulously landscaped gardens, they reached the illuminated main hall.

"Happy birthday."

Nathan tossed over a set of keys—the limited edition sports car Ethan had coveted for months.

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Thanks."

During the exchange, Nathan's peripheral vision caught a familiar silhouette.
###Chapter 73

Nathan Evans jerked his hand away from Chloe Valentine's grasp as if electrocuted.

Chloe's nails accidentally scratched a red mark across his knuckles. Following his frozen gaze, she spotted Evelyn Langley standing by the champagne tower.

"You invited her?" Nathan's voice tightened.

Ethan Winston swirled his glass, ice cubes clinking. "We're all old classmates." His smile carried hidden meaning. "Did I need permission?"

Evelyn's gaze swept the room, lingering on Nathan for less than a second. She strode toward Ethan, the hem of her black coat slicing through the air.

"Happy birthday." She extended an exquisitely wrapped gift. "Lab data can't wait. I won't stay long."

Ethan ignored the present, plucking two champagne flutes from a passing tray instead. "In such a hurry?" He drained one glass, his Adam's apple bobbing. "At least finish this."

The crystal rim bore a lipstick imprint as Evelyn downed the drink. The alcohol burned her throat just as her phone vibrated in her purse—her advisor's manuscript revisions.

"Cake time approaches." Ethan suddenly gripped her wrist.

Warmth and alcohol flushed Evelyn's cheeks as she twisted free. "I need air."

Nathan's gaze followed her through the columned hallway. Chloe suddenly clutched her chest, swaying against his arm. "My heart...it's racing..."

Outside, rare orchids bloomed in climate-controlled glasshouses. Evelyn counted breaths to steady herself when an unseen force yanked her into moonlit laurel shadows.

A chest scented with cedar pressed against her. She raised an elbow to strike, then froze at the tequila-laced whisper:

"Recognized me?" Ethan's laughter vibrated against her. His fingers traced the silk ribbon at her waist. "Your earlobes always redden when you lie."

Evelyn's back met the cold marble pillar. Moonlight fractured through leaves, webbing cracks across his glasses.
###Chapter 74

"It's you I want to kiss."

Ethan Winston's deep voice cut clearly through the night.

Evelyn Langley jerked her head up, pupils dilating.

She must have misheard.

Moonlight outlined Ethan's profile with silver edges. His usually gentle eyes now held a hint of intoxication.

"Surprised?"

He leaned closer, his breath carrying the mingled scents of alcohol and sandalwood cologne.

Evelyn instinctively stepped back.

"You're drunk."

"I'm perfectly sober."

Ethan chuckled, his long fingers undoing the top button of his shirt. "I've wanted to do this since the moment I first saw you."

Heat rushed to the tips of Evelyn's ears.

"Stop joking."

"Do I look like I'm joking?"

Suddenly he advanced, trapping her against the wall.

She could feel the heat radiating from his chest.

"Ethan!"

She pushed against him. "Have you lost your mind? Nathan is your best friend!"

"So?"

One hand braced against the wall, the other tracing her hairline. "He already lost you."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"I love you."

His whisper was feather-light. "Long before Nathan ever did."

The words exploded in Evelyn's mind like a bomb.

She'd never imagined this moment.

Who was Ethan Winston?

Nathan Evans' most trusted brother-in-arms. A rising star in the business world. The unattainable dream of countless socialites.

And now he was saying he loved her.

"Impossible."

She turned her face away. "Between us..."

"Shh."

His finger touched her lips. "Don't reject me yet."

Sudden footsteps pounded from the distance.

"Ethan!"

Nathan's roar shattered the night.

The next instant, Ethan was violently yanked away.

The sickening thud of fist meeting flesh made Evelyn flinch.

"What the hell are you doing?!"

Nathan's eyes burned crimson as he grabbed Ethan's collar and landed another punch.

Evelyn stood frozen, stunned by the sudden violence.

"Nathan..."

Ethan wiped blood from his lip, still managing a smile.

"You dare laugh?!"

Nathan raised his fist again. "She's my girlfriend!"

"Ex-girlfriend."

Ethan calmly corrected. "Besides, you were the one who let her go."

The words ignited Nathan's fury.

"You're dead!"

Under the moonlight, the two towering men became a tangle of flying fists.

Evelyn remained rooted to the spot, her limbs turning to ice.

She'd never imagined becoming the spark that destroyed their brotherhood.
###Chapter 75

"And you!" Nathan Evans turned to Evelyn Langley, his eyes burning with fury. "You're truly shameless. Out of all the men, you had to go after him? Are you happy now?"

Evelyn's chest heaved violently, her nails digging deep into her palms. She had done nothing wrong, yet she was inexplicably caught in this storm.

Ethan Winston wiped the blood from his lips, his gaze icy and terrifying.

"You saw everything we did, didn't you?" He curled his lips in disdain.

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Don't you have anything to say for yourself?"

"Explain what?" Ethan sneered. "That I like Evelyn? Or that I'm going to pursue her?"

The words struck Evelyn like a hammer, draining the color from her face.

Nathan's fist flew toward Ethan again. "You think you're worthy?!"

Staggering back from the blow, Ethan immediately shielded Evelyn behind him. "Why not?"

The protective gesture enraged Nathan further. His teeth clenched. "Of course not!"

"And what gives you the right to say that?" Ethan mocked. "As her ex-boyfriend?"

"It's not over until I say it's over!" Nathan roared.

Ethan's eyes darkened. "You were the one who ended things. Everyone was there—have you forgotten already?"

Nathan let out a bitter laugh. "So this was your plan all along."

A flicker of guilt crossed Ethan's face. "You let her go first..."

"That doesn't mean you get to chase her!" Nathan's voice was hoarse. "Ethan, are you that desperate?"

"Get a grip, Nathan." Ethan remained calm. "It's over. If it's not me, it'll be someone else."

The image of Evelyn in another man's arms flashed through Nathan's mind, shattering his last shred of rationality. Before he knew it, his fists were raining down on Ethan.

Ethan dodged swiftly, but protecting Evelyn left him vulnerable. He took several hits before finding an opening to strike back. Soon, both men were bruised and bloodied.

Meanwhile, Chloe Valentine had composed herself in the lounge, determined to face Evelyn with grace. After freshening up, she descended the stairs—only to find Nathan missing.

A waiter directed her to the garden, where the scene before her left her stunned—

Nathan and Ethan were locked in a vicious brawl!

"Stop it!" Chloe rushed forward, trying to pull Nathan away, but he shoved her aside. She fell hard onto the ground.

Dylan Lowell and Julian Roscente arrived at the commotion, their expressions shocked.

"What the hell?! Have you both lost your minds?"

"Stop this! Nathan! Ethan—"
###Chapter 76

Dylan Lowell gripped Nathan Evans' arm tightly. "Nathan, let's talk this out!"

Julian Roscente stepped between Ethan Winston and Evelyn Langley. "Ethan, it's your birthday. Don't make a scene."

Both men's eyes burned with fury, like two enraged beasts.

"Let go!" Nathan shook off Dylan's hold.

"Back off!" Ethan shoved Julian aside.

As they moved to clash again, Dylan and Julian quickly intercepted them.

"What's going on?" Julian frowned at the pair.

"We're brothers. Don't let this ruin our friendship," Dylan urged, sweat beading on his forehead.

Julian held Nathan back. "Nathan, it's Ethan's birthday. Whatever this is, settle it another day."

Ethan wiped blood from his lip and smirked. "I meant every word. You have no right to interfere."

He turned to the pale-faced Evelyn, removing his jacket to drape over her shoulders. "You okay? I'll take you home."

Dylan and Julian exchanged stunned glances.

Ethan and Evelyn?

So this was why Nathan lost it?

Evelyn snapped back to reality, stepping away from Ethan's touch and returning his jacket.

"No need. I can go alone." Her voice was soft but firm. "I'm not some prize for you two to fight over."

She met both their gazes. "Don't contact me again."

Ethan's expression darkened. "Evelyn, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking today."

"If you're truly sorry," she cut him off, "then stay away from me."

The fog had lifted.

This wasn't her fault.

Ethan's recklessness, Nathan's rage—none of it concerned her. She just wanted out of this circus.

But Ethan wasn't giving up.

"You can reject me," he said stubbornly, "but I have the right to pursue you."

Nathan's face turned thunderous. "Ethan Winston!"

"Truth hurts," Ethan shot back challengingly.

Evelyn turned to leave. "Enjoy your chat."

Ethan lunged forward, grabbing her shoulder—
###Chapter 77

Evelyn's wrist was suddenly seized by a long-fingered hand.

Adrian Klein's grip was firm yet controlled.

Ethan Winston's expression turned glacial. "Professor Klein?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. "Professor..." Her voice trembled imperceptibly.

Adrian's gaze lingered on her red-rimmed eyes. "Need help?"

"Yes." The word came out thick with unshed tears.

He shrugged off his tailored suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "I'll take you home."

His arm settled protectively around her slender frame as he turned to leave.

Evelyn clung to his sleeve like a drowning woman grasping driftwood.

"Why are you here?" she whispered.

"Academic symposium." Adrian's reply was clipped. "Coincidental timing."

"Stop right there." Ethan blocked their path. "Isn't this overstepping, Professor?"

Adrian didn't break stride. "Move."

"This is my territory." Ethan's eyes narrowed. "Miss Langley is my guest."

Evelyn tightened her grip on Adrian's sleeve. "I'm leaving with Professor Klein."

Ethan's face darkened.

"Slut!" Nathan Evans suddenly charged forward. "Already collecting men like trophies?"

He sneered at Adrian. "No wonder you dumped me so easily. Had this one lined up already?"

"Even targeting my friends now? You're disgusting."

Evelyn's entire body shook.

Each word stabbed like shards of glass.

She lifted her gaze to Nathan. "Six years..."

"So this is what you really think of me."

Adrian felt her trembling through his jacket.

His voice dropped to subzero. "Watch your mouth."

Nathan barked a laugh. "What? Getting defensive?"

"She's not even worth fighting over—used goods."

Evelyn's face drained of color.

She bit her lip until copper bloomed on her tongue.

"I thought..." Her whisper barely carried. "We loved each other once."

An inexplicable pang struck Nathan's chest.

His mouth opened. No words came.

The night wind lifted strands of Evelyn's hair.

She turned decisively to Adrian. "Let's go."

Nathan watched her retreating figure, knuckles whitening.

"Why..." The hoarse question tore from his throat.
###Chapter 78

Nathan's knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists. His gaze burned into Ethan. "What the hell do you mean? Evelyn is mine!"

Ethan leisurely adjusted his cufflinks, a cold smirk playing on his lips. "Weren't you the one who told me to pursue her in the group chat? Spare me the sudden devotion."

The words struck Nathan like lightning. Memories of that drunken night flooded back. His face drained of color, lips trembling soundlessly.

Evelyn staggered backward, her slender frame swaying like a leaf in the wind.

Adrian stepped forward in one swift motion, steadying her shoulders. "We're leaving."

Ethan blocked their path, eyes darkening. "Mr. Klein, this is Winston territory."

Nathan snapped out of his daze, fury igniting in his eyes like a provoked beast.

Adrian's gaze sharpened instantly, his entire demeanor shifting. "The academic forum at New York Grand is chaired by my father. Shall I call him to mediate?"

The air froze.

"Or," Adrian continued calmly, "should I inform Mr. Evans Senior about tonight's events?"

Ethan's pupils constricted.

Nathan's temples pulsed visibly, yet he didn't dare advance further.

Adrian swept his icy gaze across both men. "Move."

Ethan gritted his teeth and retreated half a step. Nathan's fists cracked audibly, but he remained rooted.

"Damn it!"

Nathan kicked a flowerpot violently, sending ceramic shards flying.

Dylan and Julian cowered in a corner, barely breathing.

......

Ethan picked up his suit jacket and walked away without a backward glance.

Nathan watched his retreating figure, eyes dripping with venom.

Chloe approached timidly. "Nate—"

"Get lost!"

......

Rain hammered against the car windows during their return, like countless silver needles.

Evelyn curled into the corner, her slight frame trembling uncontrollably.

Suddenly, a warm suit jacket enveloped her, carrying the crisp scent of cedarwood.

The dam broke.

Adrian signaled the driver to stop and raised the partition, sitting silently beside her as she wept.

Eventually, the sobs subsided.

"I'm sorry..." Evelyn's voice was raw. "I lost control..."

Adrian offered a handkerchief. "Their words aren't worth a single tear."

"They only see illusions of their own making."

"But I know," he met her tear-filled eyes, "you're a thousand times better than anything they could imagine."

Evelyn lifted her gaze and found herself drowning in the depths of his unwavering stare.
###Chapter 79

"Really?" Evelyn Langley looked up with slightly reddened eyes.

Adrian Klein adjusted his glasses. "Mhm."

She exhaled deeply. "Thank you. I feel better now."

Seeing her calm down, the tension in Adrian's shoulders eased slightly.

"Hungry? There's a decent Sichuan place nearby."

Evelyn hesitated before nodding.

The restaurant's signature dish was their spicy hotpot broth.

Knowing Adrian couldn't handle heat, they opted for the split-pot option.

The crimson broth bubbled furiously, its rich aroma filling the air.

The steaming atmosphere lifted Evelyn's dampened spirits somewhat.

Between the tender beef slices and crisp vegetables, she found herself eating more than expected.

Rain pattered against the windows while warmth enveloped the dining room.

The cheerful chatter of other diners gradually dispelled the gloom in her heart.

She glanced up to notice the man across from her had barely touched his food.

His elegant movements suggested he was merely keeping her company.

Remembering how he'd stayed with her during that rainy night, warmth bloomed in Evelyn's chest.

"Today... I couldn't have done it without you." Her voice was barely above a whisper.

That scene would have been impossible to face alone.

"Like a waking nightmare."

She shook her head with a bitter smile, meeting Adrian's clear gaze.

"You're like..." She suddenly chuckled. "A superhero dropping from the sky."

"Inaccurate analogy." Adrian's lips quirked.

Evelyn studied his eyes behind the fogged lenses.

"You're stronger than you realize." His tone held quiet conviction.

This wasn't empty comfort, but simple fact.

Evelyn blinked, then burst into laughter. "Your glasses are fogged up."

The lenses had completely steamed over.

Adrian removed them with a resigned sigh. "Hence why I rarely eat hotpot."

"So even Professor Klein has weaknesses." She propped her chin on one hand.

"Merely inconvenient."

He replaced the freshly wiped glasses.

Evelyn recalled how he'd never been picky during meals at her apartment.

"Try this." Adrian placed a slice of beef in her bowl.

"I can serve myself..."

After dinner, Adrian only walked her to her building's entrance.

The post-rain air carried a crisp chill.

Evelyn tightened her coat, catching the familiar sandalwood scent.

Only then did she notice Adrian wore nothing but a thin sweater.

He wouldn't... catch cold, would he?

Yet the next morning, between intermittent sneezes,

Evelyn confirmed even professors weren't immune to sniffles.

"Your coat's at the dry cleaners. It'll be ready soon."

Adrian waved dismissively. "No matter."

His wardrobe contained plenty of alternatives.
###Chapter 80

"I came back to grab some clean clothes. The lab still has work waiting."

Adrian Klein's voice sounded muffled behind his mask, which covered most of his face, revealing only tired eyes.

"Wait a moment."

Evelyn Langley hurried into the bedroom and returned with an insulated bag.

"This is ginger tea I made last night. Drink it while it's still warm."

At the mention of ginger, Adrian's brow furrowed slightly. Evelyn didn't notice as she continued, "There's also cold medicine inside. The dosage instructions are written on the box."

Adrian rarely got sick. Staring at the bag, he felt the unfamiliar urge to refuse.

"If it weren't for me yesterday, you wouldn't have caught a cold."

Her words made him retract his hesitating hand.

He checked his watch. Time was tight.

"Thanks. I'll drink it."

She gently closed the door after watching his hurried departure.

Her desk was piled with research materials, the computer screen still glowing. Evelyn dove back into revising her thesis, fingers flying across the keyboard.

The German literature Professor Eleanor Roland provided was filled with technical terms, forcing her to constantly consult dictionaries.

Just as she focused, her phone rang sharply.

The interruption irritated her, but she answered anyway.

"Hello?"

"I owe you an apology for yesterday. There are things I need to say in person."

Ethan Winston's voice came through the receiver.

Evelyn stayed silent for a beat. She had things to say too.

After hanging up, she steadied herself, pushing Nathan Evans' furious expression from her mind before resuming work.

......

The agreed café was near Harvard University.

Wind chimes tinkled as she entered.

Ethan sat by the window in his usual spot, turning as if sensing her presence.

Today he wore a deep blue shirt with the collar slightly open, sleeves rolled up to reveal toned forearms. Girls at nearby tables stole glances.

Evelyn sat directly across from him.

"What would you like to drink?" Ethan asked.

"Nothing." She cut to the chase. "I came to make things clear."

He smiled. "Funny, so did I. Every word I said yesterday was sincere."

"But I don't like you." Evelyn met his gaze. "There's no chance for us."

"Nothing in this world is absolute." His tone remained unhurried. "As long as the outcome is good, what does it matter if the path is winding?"

This was typical Ethan—once he set his mind to something, he wouldn't relent.

He had patience. He could wait.

Just like how Nathan had persistently pursued her until he succeeded.

If Nathan could do it, why couldn't he?
###Chapter 81

Evelyn frowned slightly as she studied Ethan's confident expression. Just as she was about to speak, an exclamation came from behind her.

"Evelyn?!"

Dylan had just finished discussing a project in the neighboring office building. Passing by the café, he spotted Evelyn and Ethan sitting across from each other through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

He rubbed his eyes in disbelief.

This café was famous as a romantic hotspot, the go-to place for couples.

Was Ethan seriously making a move on his friend's ex-girlfriend? Though shocked, Dylan quickly realized this was exactly the kind of thing the Winston heir would do.

But Evelyn actually agreed to meet him? Dylan felt his worldview crumbling.

His gaze darted between them, words stuck in his throat.

Evelyn gathered the documents on the table and nodded at Dylan. "I should go."

Once she left, Dylan plopped into her vacated seat, staring straight at Ethan. "Are you serious?"

Ethan stirred his coffee leisurely. "What do you mean?"

"There's no way Evelyn would ever be interested in you," Dylan stated firmly.

Ethan's hand stilled. "And why is that?"

The sudden intensity made Dylan swallow hard. "First, you're not her type. Second, with your history with Nathan—"

Ethan chuckled darkly.

Dylan leaned in, lowering his voice. "Spill it. When did you start having feelings for Evelyn?"

Ethan gazed out the window before taking a sip of coffee. "Probably...around the time she started dating Nathan?"

"You bastard!" Dylan slammed the table, standing abruptly. "Bro code, ever heard of it?"

"Did I make a move while they were together?" Ethan's icy gaze lifted. "Now that they've broken up, I can't pursue her?"

"This was premeditated!"

Ethan smirked. "Weren't you competing with Julian for the same girl in high school?"

"That—that was different!" Dylan's face flushed red. "We were young and stupid..."

"Can you control feelings?" Ethan countered.

If Nathan didn't know how to cherish Evelyn, he would.

He'd already shown remarkable restraint.

Dylan raked his hands through his hair in frustration. "I'm begging you, man. You know how Evelyn is..."

Ever since Nathan publicly severed ties with Ethan, their entire social circle had been in an uproar.

Some said it was a business dispute.

Others speculated about family conflicts.

The wildest rumor claimed they'd fought over a nightclub performer.

Whenever Dylan heard these absurd stories, he could only force an awkward smile and change the subject.
###Chapter 82

Ethan Winston played a ruthless move. Two brothers fighting over one woman, and he openly declared his relationship first. Wasn't this deliberately causing a scandal?

Ethan lounged lazily on the sofa, fingers tapping the armrest. "Don't bother persuading me. Whether the melon is sweet or not, one must taste it to know."

......

Evelyn Langley stepped out of the café and wandered aimlessly through the mall. She bought a camel-colored cashmere scarf and picked out a beige overcoat.

By the time she finished grocery shopping, dusk had fallen. Winter nights always arrived too quickly. She tightened her coat and quickened her pace.

The streetlights were already lit when she reached her apartment building. A dark figure suddenly emerged from the alley.

Her heart clenched, thinking it was a drunkard or a homeless man.

Recognizing Nathan Evans, she relaxed—until the strong scent of alcohol hit her, making her frown.

Nathan had been waiting in the cold for hours, his nose red from the chill. Fueled by liquor, he grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

"Evelyn..."

"Let go." She struggled fiercely.

Somehow, this man's touch now made her skin crawl.

"Not until you promise to come back to me!" His voice was hoarse.

"You're drunk." She turned her face away.

"I mean it..."

The second man today to tell her he was "serious."

Nathan's gaze was unfocused. "Before, you asked if I wanted to be the other man. Now I'm telling you—I've broken up with Chloe Valentine. If you come back, I'll overlook whatever's between you and Ethan."

"I was wrong yesterday. I'm sorry. Hit me, yell at me—do whatever you want..."

The night wind cut like knives. The forecast said tonight would be the coldest of the season.

Suddenly, Evelyn felt the chill seep into her bones, her breath turning to ice shards.

"Sorry," she lowered her eyes. "There's no going back."

The once-proud man had finally bowed his head, but she no longer cared.

"Your stomach is sensitive. Don't drink so much."

She pulled her hand free and turned to leave.

Don't drink so much...

She still remembered his old ailment!

Nathan's eyes lit up. She still cared about him! This realization set his blood on fire.

He lunged forward, pulling Evelyn into his arms. "Evelyn, you still love me, don't you? Let's start over!"

He tried to kiss her.

Evelyn shoved him away hard, wiping her lips furiously. "Don't touch me!"

Nathan froze as if struck by lightning. The disgust on her face was a blade, cutting him to the bone.

The alcohol haze vanished, leaving only piercing cold.

Evelyn smirked. "Truth is, I knew long ago you were seeing other women while we were together. Did you really think you hid it well? A woman in love is a detective."

The first clue surfaced when he returned from a business trip. While unpacking, she found a torn condom wrapper in the lining—just a fingernail-sized scrap, but she instantly recognized it wasn't their brand.
###Chapter 83

That night, she claimed a headache and moved into the guest room alone.

One more second in his presence, and she might have vomited in front of Nathan Evans.

Outside the window, the night was thick as ink.

Cold wind rattled the glass.

Tears soaked her pillowcase.

The next morning, she went straight to Massachusetts General Hospital for a full gynecological exam.

The results came back completely normal.

From that day on, she deliberately avoided Nathan's touch.

And he remained utterly oblivious.

Of course. Too busy feasting elsewhere to care about plain congee at home.

"You disgust me," Evelyn Langley took a step back. "Stay away from me."

Nathan stood frozen, his Adam's apple bobbing soundlessly.

So she'd known all along...

Raindrops suddenly thickened.

Icy wind hurled rain against their faces.

Nathan stood motionless in the downpour, watching Evelyn's retreating figure like a statue.

Chloe Valentine rushed into the rain, touching his chilled skin. "Nathan! You'll get sick!"

Drenched and shivering, she spat, "She doesn't care about you! Only I—"

"Get lost." He shook off her hand.

"Then I'll stay here with you!" Chloe planted herself stubbornly.

Nathan ignored her, staring fixedly down the street.

Evelyn never looked back.

Alcohol and cold finally overwhelmed him. He collapsed face-first into the flooded pavement.

"Nathan!" Chloe frantically pulled him up.

After flagging down a cab, the female driver helped load his limp body inside.

Back at the mansion, Chloe didn't bother changing, immediately tending to Nathan—wiping him down, changing his clothes.

Their family doctor arrived overnight for IV fluids, stabilizing him by dawn.

Half-asleep, Chloe heard him murmur "Evelyn."

His daytime dismissal—"We're done"—echoed in her ears.

She refused to accept this.

How could her carefully cultivated relationship end like this?

Chloe's expression darkened.

She changed into Evelyn's abandoned nightgown and pressed herself against Nathan's chest.

In his feverish haze, Nathan caught the familiar scent—and for a moment, saw Evelyn's face.
###Chapter 84

Moonlight streamed through the gap in the curtains, outlining her graceful silhouette. The black lace nightgown clung to her perfect curves, revealing glimpses of skin in the dim light.

Nathan Evans' breathing instantly grew ragged.

He pinned her beneath him, his scorching lips claiming hers urgently. "Evelyn..." His voice was hoarse with desire.

This time, he wouldn't let her leave again.

...

Dawn lightened the bedroom before peace finally returned.

Nathan fell into deep sleep, a satisfied smile lingering on his lips.

Harsh sunlight woke him. He pressed fingers to his throbbing temples, the hangover making his vision blur.

His arm brushed against something warm and soft.

He turned sharply to meet Chloe Valentine's shy, teary gaze.

The girl's pale skin bore telltale marks of passion, her disheveled hair strewn across the pillow. She timidly pulled the sheet higher, trying to cover the evidence.

Nathan's expression darkened.

Fragmented memories flashed through his mind. He distinctly remembered getting drunk outside Evelyn's apartment last night. How did this...

"Nathan..." Chloe's quiet sob broke the silence. "You were so rough with me..."

He raked fingers through his hair. "What the hell happened?"

"You were drunk. I brought you home..." Her lip trembled as tears fell. "You wouldn't let me go... I tried to push you away..."

Her shaking hand reached for his arm but stopped midair. "I know you love someone else. I won't cling to you..."

She tried to rise but collapsed when her feet touched the floor.

Nathan's temple pulsed at the sight of angry red marks on her neck. "Forget it." He closed his eyes. "We'll deal with this later."

As shower sounds filled the bathroom, Chloe wiped her tears. A triumphant smile curved her lips.

The silk nightgown had been returned to its place in the wardrobe.

Her performance had been flawless.
###Chapter 85

Night deepened as Nathan Evans closed the last file. His phone screen lit up.

Dylan Lowell's voice came through the receiver. "Nate, wanna grab a drink?"

"Sure."

He stood to change clothes. Just as he reached the staircase, keys jingled at the front door.

Chloe Valentine stood in the foyer clutching her backpack. Her gaze locked with his.

Both froze.

"What are you doing here?" Nathan frowned.

"You're going out?" Chloe tightened her grip on the backpack straps.

"Yeah."

She bit her lower lip. "Did I...interrupt something?"

The air turned heavy.

"Last period was gym class..." Her voice trailed off. "After last night...I have some inflammation. Didn't dare go to the school clinic..."

Nathan's eyes dropped to her reddened knees.

"First aid kit's upstairs." He turned toward the steps.

Chloe hurried after him. At the sight of the ointment instructions, her ears burned crimson. "This one...won't work..."

"Then the hospital." He grabbed his jacket.

"No need! Dylan's waiting for you—"

"He can wait." The elevator dinged. "Doctor first."

Her eyes brightened. "Then...can I come with you after?"

"Whatever."

......

In the private hospital corridor, Chloe buried her face in her scarf.

Nathan accepted the medication bag. "Sorry about this."

"I like it." She suddenly looked up, eyes sparkling. "Anything involving you."

His Adam's apple bobbed.

That ridiculous case of mistaken identity had become a thorn in his heart.

"Get in." He opened the driver's side door.

"Huh?"

"Thought you wanted to see Dylan?"

......

Hazy lights pulsed in the private room. Dylan struck a pose before the mirror.

Julian Roscente kicked his shin. "Stop assaulting my eyes."

"Philistine!" Dylan swayed his hips. "This is Paris' hottest new dance move—"

"Where's Nathan?" Julian cut in.

Dylan checked his phone. "Said he's on the way."

"And Ethan?"

"Surgery." Dylan lowered his voice. "No way I'm inviting both at once—"

The door swung open.

Dylan nearly dropped his glass. "Holy shit, why'd you bring—"

Chloe peeked from behind Nathan, waving sweetly.
###Chapter 86

Dylan Lowell hurried to the door when the bell rang.

His pupils constricted the moment it swung open.

Nathan Evans stood there with Chloe Valentine clinging to his arm.

"Holy shit..." Dylan gasped.

Nathan remained impassive. "Long time no see."

"Come in, man!" Dylan fumbled to welcome them, uncorking whiskey and slicing fruit.

When Chloe excused herself to the restroom, Dylan finally blurted, "I thought you two broke up ages ago. What's going on?"

Nathan downed half his whiskey, Adam's apple bobbing. "She's young. Needs time to adjust."

Dylan nearly choked.

Twenty years old was young?

Nathan must be bewitched.

"What about Evelyn Langley..." Dylan trailed off.

That bastard Ethan Winston would throw a damn parade if he found out.

Nathan's knuckles whitened at Evelyn's name. "Who said I'm giving up?"

"But this..." Dylan glanced toward the restroom, "You're stringing them both along."

"Once Chloe's settled, I'll win Evelyn back."

Dylan opened his mouth.

He wanted to say love couldn't wait, but Nathan's determined expression made him swallow the words.

By closing time, Dylan was swaying drunk.

He barely signed the check before waiters hauled him into a cab.

Julian Roscente stayed relatively sober, though reeking of cigarettes.

He had a permanent suite at the nearby hotel and walked there directly.

Only Nathan and Chloe remained on the curb waiting for their driver.

Chloe pressed against him, fingers curling around his bicep. "Let me stay at your place tonight?"

The implication couldn't be clearer.

Nathan extracted his arm. "You have morning classes. I'll take you back to campus."

Her smile faltered before she nodded obediently. "Whatever you say."

After dropping Chloe at Harvard's gates, Nathan suddenly told the driver, "Keep the car. I'll walk."

His feet carried him unconsciously to Harvard's main entrance.

Every tree and brick felt familiar.

He'd loitered here endlessly while courting Evelyn.

Sometimes she'd appear within minutes. Other times he'd wait all day in vain.

Yet he'd relished every second.

Through the dim alleyway lay Evelyn's apartment.

Nathan stumbled upstairs in the dark, kicking over empty liquor bottles.

At last he stood before her chipped security door.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

"Evelyn, open up."
###Chapter 87

"Evelyn Langley, I know you're in there."

"Open the door! Let's talk this out."

Nathan Evans' voice carried through the door, laced with suppressed fury.

He pounded the door twice with his fist.

"Fine. Very well." A cold laugh escaped him. "You think hiding from me will solve anything?"

His patience had worn thin, shifting from pleading to outright rage.

Just as he turned to leave, a figure emerged from the shadows of the stairwell.

Nathan froze mid-step.

Under the dim light, Adrian Klein stood on the steps, holding a paper bag.

His presence here at this hour spoke volumes.

After the incident with Ethan Winston, Nathan had dug into Adrian's background.

The third son of the Klein family—no wonder even Ethan had backed down.

"Here to see Evelyn?" Nathan narrowed his eyes.

Adrian remained impassive. "None of your concern."

"She's mine," Nathan said, his tone dangerous.

"She belongs to no one." Adrian frowned. "If anything, she belongs only to herself."

Nathan scoffed. "Professor Klein, for all your education, you don't understand women. The more she acts like this, the more it proves she can't let me go."

"Go ahead, knock. She won't open the door for you either."

With that, Nathan strode away.

Adrian glanced at the locked door, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Of course he knew Evelyn wouldn't answer.

Because she wasn't home.

......

Sunlight bathed the Maldives in warmth.

The crystal-clear turquoise waters revealed vibrant schools of fish darting below.

Three days ago, Sophia Laurent had called out of the blue.

Fresh off a major project and with her boyfriend away visiting family, she was bored.

"Come to the Maldives with me," she'd said eagerly.

Evelyn had agreed almost immediately.

Partly to avoid Nathan and Ethan's relentless pursuit, but mostly because she needed this escape.

Now, she lay on a beach chair, soaking in the sun.

A gentle breeze carried the sound of waves lapping against the shore.

"Living the life, huh?" Sophia dropped onto the adjacent chair in her bikini.

Evelyn took a sip of mango juice, eyes closed in contentment.

This trip was worth every second.
###Chapter 88

Sophia Laurent sipped coconut water through a straw, mimicking Evelyn Langley's pose behind her sunglasses. A lazy smile played on her lips.

Evelyn stretched her long legs, crossing them at the ankles. "I thought you had a date today?"

"Don't remind me." Sophia wrinkled her nose in distaste. "That gym trainer looked ripped but couldn't even open a bottle cap. My puppy boy does better."

"Alex, was it?"

"Ancient history." Sophia's eyes sparkled. "The new one plays piano, has dimples when he smiles, and—" she lowered her voice conspiratorially, "his tiramisu beats Michelin restaurants."

Evelyn chuckled.

"What about you?" Sophia studied her through tinted lenses. "Still not dating?"

Evelyn gazed at the turquoise horizon. "Not interested."

"Fair." Sophia stretched like a cat. "Men would only slow down your Nobel Prize." She suddenly perked up. "Oh! A half-blood hottie at ten o'clock. Gotta shoot my shot!"

Evelyn raised her coconut in salute. "Play safe."

......

Nathan Evans stood before floor-to-ceiling windows, fingertips tapping glass. "Confirmed?"

His assistant dabbed his forehead. "Verified. Miss Langley's in the Maldives."

"Not another decoy by Ethan Winston?"

"We checked immigration records. Solid lead."

Nathan's expression darkened. Last time Ethan's misdirection sent him chasing ghosts in Iceland.

"Book the earliest flight."

The assistant scrambled. "Seven AM tomorrow."

"Do it."

"Yes, Mr. Evans." The assistant exhaled in relief. "Arrangements underway."

As the office door shut, whispers erupted outside.

"Mr. Lin, you look pale!"

Lin wiped his brow. "Nightmare. Need tickets for tomorrow's seven AM Maldives flight. Gotta pick up my kid after."

The new assistant beamed. "I'll handle it!"

"Don't screw up," Lin cautioned.

"Relax!" She waved him off. "Just ticketing..."

Alone, she noticed two default passengers in the booking system. Her call to Lin went unanswered.

She chewed her lip. Mr. Evans' sudden Maldives trip... must be a getaway with Miss Valentine.

With decisive clicks, she selected both names.

Executives always travel with secretaries. Or girlfriends. Standard procedure.
###Chapter 89

Nathan Evans idly scrolled through his phone in the VIP lounge.

Thirty minutes until boarding. He glared at the clock, willing time to move faster.

His finger froze mid-swipe.

Ethan Winston had just posted a new story—a sunset beach in Maldives with a cryptic caption: "Finally met the one I've been waiting for."

The comments exploded.

"Is Ethan chasing someone?"
"Could it be that Ms. Langley?"
Ethan only replied with a suggestive emoji.

Nathan's eyes turned icy.

He'd just ordered his assistant to spread false intel, and now Ethan flew to Maldives.

The boarding announcement blared overhead.

As he grabbed his jacket, the lounge door swung open.

Chloe Valentine stood there, eyes sparkling.

"Nathan!" She threw herself into his arms. "I knew you still cared!"

His entire body stiffened.

Chloe waved her boarding pass excitedly. "I packed everything! Those overwater villas are so romantic—you can hear the waves at night—"

A vein throbbed at Nathan's temple.

"Restroom." He cut her off coldly and strode away.

Around the corner, he dialed his assistant.

"Sebastian." His voice could freeze hell. "Explain."

Panicked stammering came through. "Sir, the new intern mixed up the—"

"Don't bother coming in tomorrow."

Nathan inhaled sharply after hanging up.

Back at the gate, Chloe waited with eager eyes.

"Let's go." His expression remained blank.

Chloe practically skipped after him, her winged eyeliner perfectly sharp.

Her fingers brushed the lace negligee hidden in her suitcase.

Nathan hadn't touched her since that drunken mistake.

This trip would change everything.
###Chapter 90

The roar of the propeller gradually faded. Chloe Valentine gazed through the window at the dreamlike blue. The Maldivian waters were even clearer than she'd imagined—like a massive sapphire set between sky and sea.

"We're here," Nathan Evans said tersely.

Chloe eagerly pulled out her phone, snapping photos of the view. Nathan's profile suddenly flashed across the screen, making her pulse quicken. She subtly angled the camera toward him.

"Don't," Nathan blocked the lens with his hand, exhaustion evident in his voice.

"Just one picture," Chloe wheedled. "It's our first international trip together."

Nathan closed his eyes. "I don't like photos."

Her smile froze before she quietly put the phone away.

The seaplane docked at the resort's pier, where white-uniformed staff had been waiting. Chloe inhaled the salty breeze, trying to dispel her disappointment.

"Mr. Evans, your suite is—" The receptionist's words cut off as elevator doors opened.

Ethan Winston strolled out leisurely, his floral shirt fluttering in the ocean wind. Removing his sunglasses, he flashed a knowing smile. "What a coincidence, Nathan."

Nathan's gaze turned icy. "Indeed."

"Seems we share similar tastes." Ethan's eyes lingered on Chloe for a second. "Both choosing the Maldives."

"Some people just follow trends." Nathan smirked. "Arriving a day early changes nothing."

Ethan toyed with his shades. "At least it proves I'm more thoughtful."

The tension between them thickened. Chloe nervously tugged Nathan's sleeve.

"Let's go." Nathan shook her off, striding toward the elevator.

Hurrying after him, Chloe heard Ethan's meaningful farewell: "Enjoy your stay."

The moment the doors closed, Nathan's expression darkened completely. "Go to the room alone. I have matters to handle."

"But—"

Before she could finish, he was already gone. Chloe stood frozen, clutching the keycard, her heart hollow.

Meanwhile, on the beachfront opposite the hotel...

"What's this?" Evelyn Langley examined the fox mask in her hands.

Sophia Laurent winked mysteriously. "Your ticket to tonight's masquerade. I picked this little vixen especially for you."

Evelyn fastened the mask. Her red-and-white dress fluttered in the breeze as sunlight glinted off pearl hairpins, making her skin glow like snow.

"Perfect!" Sophia clapped. "You'll be the belle of the ball tonight."

Evelyn turned before the mirror, the corners of her lips curling beneath the mask. A sudden premonition struck her—this vacation might not be as peaceful as expected.
###Chapter 91

"Is there a masquerade ball tonight?" Evelyn Langley flipped through the hotel brochure.

Sophia Laurent nodded excitedly. "It's the hotel's signature event, held every six months. Last time was retro court style, and before that was futuristic tech. This year's theme is Animal Kingdom, and they say ticket sales broke records."

The hotel lobby had transformed into a winter wonderland. A massive Christmas tree glittered with crystal ornaments as ribbons swayed gently in the warm air currents.

Sophia mysteriously pulled two masks from her bag. "I picked these out special for us. Fox for you, lion for me."

Evelyn examined the mask. "Why not tiger?"

"Tiger?"

"Isn't the king of the jungle more impressive?"

Sophia narrowed her eyes. "Evelyn Langley, asking for trouble?"

Evelyn quickly donned her mask and darted toward the elevator. "Come on, the ball's starting!"

"Just wait till I catch you! Who are you calling a tigress?" Sophia chased after her.

......

The 23rd floor ballroom blazed with light.

As the elevator doors opened, Evelyn felt dozens of eyes appraising her. The mask provided unexpected comfort, allowing her to face the unfamiliar crowd with ease.

Sophia dragged her straight to the bar. "Mojito for me. You?"

"Just lemon water."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Make that a Long Island Iced Tea."

The bartender smirked. "Coming right up."

Evelyn massaged her temples. She didn't notice the intense gaze fixed on her from across the room.

Nathan Evans leaned against a Roman column near the entrance, his black musical note mask glinting coldly under the lights. His impeccably tailored suit jacket hung open at the collar, radiating an unapproachable aura.

Just as he turned to leave, a white-gloved hand with bunny ears touched his shoulder. "Waiting long?"

Chloe Valentine blinked up at him through pink eyeshadow. "I got lost on the 24th floor. They're doing prize drawings tonight - let's try our luck."

Nathan's voice softened unconsciously as he took in her fluffy ears. "Lead the way."

......

Sophia suddenly set down her drink, locking onto a tall wolf-masked figure across the room.

Evelyn waved her off knowingly. "Be safe."

"Obviously!" Sophia pounced toward her prey like the lioness she portrayed.

Left alone at the bar, Evelyn observed the now-roaring ballroom. Masked figures swayed to the music, their obscured faces adding to the electric atmosphere.
###Chapter 92

Evelyn Langley circled the dessert section with her tray before selecting a slice of tiramisu. She avoided the noisy crowd and settled into a corner sofa, pulling out her tablet from her bag. Her fingers swiped rapidly through the pages of her research paper.

A gloved black hand suddenly entered her field of vision. The fingers were long and strong, with sapphire cufflinks glinting faintly under the lights.

"Might I have the honor of dancing with the lady in the fox mask?"

That familiar voice made Evelyn's head snap up. The man wore a silver half-mask, revealing a sharply defined jawline. The antique watch on his wrist gleamed softly, complementing his "Phantom of the Opera" ensemble.

She recognized those smiling eyes instantly.

Ethan. Winston.

"Sorry, I'm not much of a dancer," Evelyn reflexively declined.

Ethan chuckled. "Last year during the school festival rehearsal, I saw you perform the entire Swan Lake solo in an empty auditorium."

Her ears burned. That had been her prepared performance, canceled later due to a high fever. Even she had nearly forgotten about it—yet he remembered.

Suddenly, the lights dimmed. A spotlight roamed through the crowd as the host announced, "Our lucky guest chosen by the light—please grace us with a dance!"

The blinding beam landed squarely on them.

Ethan's lips curved. "Seems fate is on my side." He bowed gracefully, palm upturned. "With so many watching, Miss Langley wouldn't want to embarrass me, would you?"

Cheers erupted around them.

Evelyn took a deep breath and placed her hand lightly in his. Ethan immediately closed his fingers around hers, guiding her smoothly to the center of the dance floor.

His steps were steady and confident, maintaining just the right distance. Evelyn's skirt flared with each turn, blooming like a night-blooming cereus.

"You dance beautifully," Ethan murmured near her ear.

Memories surfaced—her mother insisting that girls should cultivate talents. She'd learned ballet, practiced piano, but fell irrevocably in love with physics after her first competition. Equations and theorems fascinated her more than any dance.

"Thinking of something?" Ethan suddenly tightened his hold, executing a flawless spin.

"The past," Evelyn said softly.

A flicker of understanding passed through Ethan's eyes. He shifted steps abruptly, catching her off guard as she stumbled into his arms. Applause erupted around them.

"That fox mask," he whispered, lips brushing her ear, "reminds me of when I first saw you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Mr. Winston came all this way just for vacation?"
###Chapter 93

"Of course."

"Isn't your investment bank swamped at year-end?"

"Depends on the person." Ethan Winston's lips curved slightly. "For someone important, I'm free even at 3 AM. For those who aren't? Even weekends are booked."

Evelyn Langley was still deciphering his words when the ballroom lights shifted abruptly. The partner-switching segment began.

Amid the flickering lights, a figure was flung toward her.

Chloe Valentine stumbled past, her face etched with shock.

The next second, Evelyn's wrist was seized in a firm grip.

Nathan Evans' palm burned against her skin, his other arm possessively encircling her waist.

He shot Ethan a challenging glance before his gaze softened instantly as he turned back.

"Evelyn, are you still mad at me?"

"I went to your place three times, but you weren't there." His voice was rough. "If Ethan hadn't interfered, I would've—"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered, but she remained silent.

"Did I come too late?"

Nathan leaned in, his breath grazing her ear.

The moment the spotlight had illuminated them earlier, he'd seen Ethan's hand resting on her waist.

Watching them spin across the dance floor, Ethan whispering in her ear—he'd crushed his champagne glass in his fist.

Six years. He'd never even gotten the chance to waltz with Evelyn.

So when the music changed, he'd pushed Chloe away without hesitation.

He thought this would be like before.

A little coaxing, a little vulnerability, and she'd return to him.

"Those men were just tools to make me jealous, weren't they?" His grip tightened. "I'm losing my mind with envy."

In the past, those words would've made her heart race.

But now—

Too late.

When she'd realized she was becoming hysterical, unrecognizable even to herself, she'd known this relationship should've ended long ago.

"Six years together. Can you really walk away so easily?"

Evelyn frowned. "Let go."

Nathan instinctively tightened his hold before jerking back. "Sorry..."

As the final note faded, she stepped away decisively. "What's past is past. No need to revisit it."

Her gaze flickered toward Chloe, who stood frozen nearby. "If you've chosen someone else, stop wavering."

Her skirt swirled with finality as she turned.

Ethan, who'd been distractedly guiding Chloe in circles, chuckled under his breath.

Seems Mr. Evans' usual tricks had failed this time.
###Chapter 94

Ethan Winston could recite Nathan Evans' playbook for winning people over with his eyes closed. Expensive gifts, half-hearted apologies—the man never changed.

Too bad Evelyn Langley had outgrown such tactics.

"You seem cheerful, Mr. Winston." Chloe Valentine blinked her doe eyes innocently.

Ethan smirked. "Naturally."

"Because Evelyn rejected Nathan?"

He finally looked at her. "Isn't this what you wanted?"

Chloe didn't deny it. "Yes. I want to stay by his side forever."

"Then I wish you both... marital bliss?"

Releasing his grip on her waist, Ethan took two steps back.

Chloe beamed. "Thank you. May you win your beloved's heart soon."

Tch!

Ethan shot Nathan a pitying glance as he turned away.

The fool thought he'd adopted a bunny, unaware it was a scorpion.

As they passed each other, Nathan spoke low: "Stay away from her."

Ethan halted, eyes glinting dangerously. "Not your concern."

"At least I was legitimate." Nathan sneered. "Without me, she'd never have noticed you."

Ethan scoffed. "Remember—you're just another ghost in her past now."

Evelyn returned to her water villa, removing her mask before showering.

Damp hair cascaded over her shoulders as she stepped onto the second-floor terrace. The night breeze carried the ocean's briny scent.

The rhythmic waves sounded like a lullaby.

Leaning against the railing, she watched distant boat lights dotting the dark sea like fallen stars.

The gentle night smoothed the creases in her heart.

Lights flickered on next door. Ethan emerged onto his terrace, pausing at the sight of Evelyn illuminated against the night.

Her profile in the warm glow resembled an oil painting.

Sensing his gaze, she turned.

"Your earring." He opened his palm.

Her fingers brushed her bare earlobe in surprise. She accepted it with thanks, but he remained.

"I've traveled everywhere, yet only the Maldives' seas make people drop their guards." His eyes stayed fixed on the horizon.

Evelyn agreed silently.

Before this trip, thesis deadlines and Nathan's pestering had suffocated her. Now she could finally breathe.

"Something on your mind?" Ethan caught her studying him.

After a pause, she said, "Don't waste your time on me."
###Chapter 95

Ethan Winston's lips curved slightly. "I'll pursue you my way. Don't feel pressured. How would I know if I don't try?"

Evelyn Langley frowned. "Even if you'll get hurt in the end?"

His gaze remained steady. "Willingly."

His persistence caught her off guard, leaving her speechless.

Sensing her resistance, Ethan didn't press further. He simply stood beside her in comfortable silence, listening to the waves.

It wasn't until midnight that he finally took his leave.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, lost in thought.

Ethan always knew when to advance and retreat. His courtship was restrained yet tender, never making her uncomfortable.

Unlike Nathan Evans, who used to pester her relentlessly and had now escalated his behavior.

She massaged her temples.

Whatever. She couldn't control others.

Focusing on herself was enough.

As she turned, her body froze.

A shadowy figure stood motionless in the darkness.

Like a ghostly apparition.

Evelyn gasped.

The man stepped into the light, revealing his face.

"Nathan Evans! Are you insane?"

Lurking in the shadows at this hour—was he trying to give her a heart attack?

After Evelyn left the ball, Nathan had immediately followed.

But he couldn't find her anywhere.

Just then, Chloe Valentine had latched onto him, demanding late-night snacks.

Losing all patience, he'd summoned a waiter to deal with her.

The hotel's tight security made tracking Evelyn's room number difficult.

When he finally arrived, he saw Ethan standing beside her on the balcony.

The sea breeze lifted her white gown, her hair dancing lightly.

The tall, broad-shouldered man beside her made them look like a perfect match.

The sight struck Nathan like lightning.

Only after Ethan left did Evelyn notice him.

Dark currents swirled behind his mask. With each step he took forward, she retreated.

"I've said everything there is to say. You—"

Before she could finish, he seized her wrist.

"Why is he allowed when I'm not?" Nathan's eyes burned red.

Evelyn struggled against his grip. "What's wrong with you now?"

"I saw Ethan," he rasped. "Do you even know who he really is?"
###Chapter 96

His scorching breath fanned across her face. Evelyn instinctively took two steps back. "What do you want to say?"

Her retreat ignited something in Nathan. The crimson in his eyes deepened, his voice thick with suppressed fury. "You think Ethan Winston truly cares about you? That man's a cunning fox, a playboy who toys with hearts."

Having grown up together, Nathan knew Ethan better than anyone. The man never revealed his true intentions—even his childhood friend couldn't decipher his thoughts.

Ethan's sudden interest in Evelyn raised all kinds of red flags.

Her expression remained frosty. "Whatever his motives, they don't concern me—"

Nathan's tension eased slightly—until her next words froze him in place.

"You're no different."

"It's late." She pulled out her phone. "Leave now, or I'm calling security."

He moved closer. "Evelyn—"

"Three... two..." Her finger hovered over the call button.

Nathan finally left, teeth gritted. "I'll come back tomorrow," he threw over his shoulder.

From the restaurant terrace shadows, Chloe Valentine watched everything unfold.

The next dawn barely tinted the sky when Sophia Laurent returned, humming.

Evelyn was mid-bite into her toast when the electronic lock beeped.

Sophia sauntered in wearing a new dress, radiant. She snatched a sandwich from the table.

"Good night?" Evelyn teased.

"Absolute perfection. A Korean hunk with V-cut abs and eight-pack." Sophia's eyes glazed over at the memory of his puppy-dog gaze that morning—she'd almost caved again.

"Don't forget our scuba instructor meets us at ten."

The Maldives' diving was legendary. Though uneasy about deep water, curiosity won out for Evelyn.

Their instructor, a jovial middle-aged man, brightened at the sight of them. He meticulously explained gear usage and underwater signals.

Sophia, an experienced diver, half-listened. Evelyn absorbed every detail, terrified of missing anything.

"Relax." The instructor patted her arm. "Imagine the underwater wonderland. It'll be magical."
###Chapter 97

Evelyn blinked, her mind conjuring only fragmented images. The instructor's words acted like a sedative, easing her tightly wound nerves.

The afternoon sun scorched the ocean's surface, gradually warming the water. Wetsuits hung in the changing room. Sophia immediately chose a midriff-baring two-piece, while Evelyn opted for a modest one-piece.

Even so, when they stepped out, they drew admiring glances. Someone even whistled.

"First, get used to the water temperature," the instructor said, slapping the surface. "I'll take you to the safe zone."

"The lifeguard is nearby. Signal immediately if there's any problem."

Evelyn nodded, her gaze drifting to the shimmering sea.

"Ladies, welcome to the underwater wonderland," the instructor beamed.

The oxygen tank weighed heavily on her shoulders. Evelyn took a deep breath, her pulse quickening.

Sophia squeezed her hand, flashed a reassuring gesture, and dove in.

The underwater world fell silent. Light dimmed as their bodies grew heavier.

Sophia darted away like a nimble fish. The instructor signaled the depth: fifty meters.

Evelyn exhaled a stream of bubbles. A school of colorful fish slipped through her fingers.

A translucent jellyfish floated past, its bell pulsing. She reached out instinctively. The creature recoiled into a tiny sphere, vanishing into the blue.

The moment amused her. Her tension dissolved.

When Sophia glanced back, Evelyn was engrossed in chasing fish. She swam over, took her hand, and guided her toward the coral reef.

The sight stole their breath. Coral formed undulating mountains, tropical fish weaving through like living rainbows.

Evelyn followed the fish through a coral tunnel, pursuing a starfish. Suddenly, a shadow loomed overhead.

She looked up.

Cold eyes met hers.

Shark.

The instructor had promised this was safe. Panicked, she searched for Sophia and the instructor—both gone.

Fish scattered in terror. She kicked desperately as the shark closed in.

Nearby, a dark coral cave yawned like a void.
###Chapter 98

Evelyn abruptly changed direction, kicking hard toward the coral reef below.

She could clearly sense the disturbance in the water currents behind her.

The shark was closing in.

Not daring to look back, she squeezed through a narrow crevice in the rocks with all her strength.

Boom—

The shark's massive body slammed into the rock wall, shaking the entire cave.

Evelyn's left arm smashed painfully against the stone, sending waves of agony through her body.

She flexed her arm cautiously—just bruised, thankfully.

Now she had to wait for the shark to leave.

But her oxygen was depleting at an alarming rate.

The instructor had promised three hours from the tank.

Yet after barely thirty minutes, each breath became more labored.

Cold sweat soaked through her wetsuit.

Finally, the shark swam away.

Evelyn immediately began ascending while pressing the emergency distress button.

No response from the surface.

She kicked desperately upward as her lungs began burning.

Her limbs grew heavier.

Vision blurred.

The surface light seemed both near and impossibly far.

Her eyelids fluttered shut.

"Evelyn!"

A familiar voice pierced the water.

Strong arms encircled her waist.

Sophia swam furiously, pulling them toward the surface.

"Cough—cough—"

Evelyn convulsed as air flooded her lungs.

Seawater gushed from her nose and mouth.

"You scared me to death!" Sophia's voice trembled as she fumbled with Evelyn's gear. "When I saw the distress signal, I came immediately—"

Evelyn gasped, her chest aflame.

"I thought—" Sophia suddenly choked up. "I almost lost you—"

She clutched Evelyn tightly, tears dripping onto her wet hair.

"Thanks." Evelyn managed a weak smile. "But your CPR technique—"

"Shut up!" Sophia punched her shoulder, eyes red-rimmed. "You're joking at a time like this?"

The small boat rocked gently as sunset stretched their shadows across the water.
###Chapter 99

"She's pale. She needs medical attention immediately." The silent diving instructor suddenly spoke up.

Evelyn Langley finally noticed the crowd gathering around them, each face etched with concern.

Sophia Laurent rushed forward. "I've called the medical team. Are you hurt anywhere else?"

"My right arm might be fractured." Evelyn tried moving her arm. While she could manage underwater, now it was completely useless.

"What happened? Why did you suddenly sink?"

Evelyn hesitated. "...The oxygen tank was leaking."

Sophia's eyes sharpened. She immediately picked up the tank and inspected it.

The exterior was intact—but at the bottom...

A needle-sized hole punctured the metal.

Her head snapped up, her gaze piercing the instructor.

"Impossible! Our equipment is replaced quarterly and undergoes triple inspections before every use. We've never had issues!"

Beads of sweat formed on the instructor's forehead, his voice trembling.

"Besides, the safety zone has a full rescue system. Even in emergencies, we can respond immediately."

Sophia's anger flared. "Are you calling her a liar? If I hadn't turned the yacht around in time, could you have handled the consequences?"

Evelyn studied the panicked instructor. His fear seemed genuine.

"I saw a shark," she stated calmly.

Sophia gasped.

The instructor's face drained of color. "That's absolutely impossible!"

"Blacktip reef sharks outside the safety zone are timid deep-sea creatures. They rarely approach humans."

Evelyn remained composed. "The action cameras on the diving suits should have captured everything. We can review the footage now."

The instructor fell silent.

"My God, what's going on here?"

A belated lifeguard jogged over, his expression clueless about the crisis.

The instructor grabbed his collar. "Kim! Where the hell were you? Why weren't you at your post?"

The lifeguard raised his hands defensively. "Hey, man, I just went to the lounge for coffee. Can someone explain what's happening?"

Sophia smirked coldly. "A lifeguard abandoning his post while my friend was in danger? I have every reason to suspect this was intentional."
###Chapter 100

The ocean's blue depths were unnervingly dark.

Sophia Laurent clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms as she glared at the empty lifeguard station. If she hadn't noticed the danger in time, Evelyn Langley might have—

"I just stepped away to use the restroom!" The lifeguard shrugged, cigarette dangling from his lips. His legs jiggled with indifference. "Since when is taking a bathroom break illegal? Besides, minor diving accidents happen all the time."

Smoke rings curled from his mouth as his gaze slid over Evelyn's drenched form.

A sea breeze swept past, making Evelyn shiver. Her slender frame trembled.

Sophia's eyes turned icy. She was ready to demand answers when Evelyn's coughing fit interrupted. The roar of helicopter blades forced her to prioritize getting her friend medical attention.

The sterile hospital scent stung her nose.

A nurse handed over dry patient gowns. Sophia insisted on a full examination. Only when the doctor confirmed it was just a minor sprain did she finally exhale.

The minty aroma of ointment lingered in the air.

During the helicopter ride back, Sophia confronted the hotel manager directly. His polished smile didn't waver as he sidestepped all responsibility.

"Evelyn Langley?"

Nathan Evans halted mid-step in the hallway. He'd just returned when the argument caught his ear. Those fragmented words conjured an image—a panicked figure trapped in the ocean's abyss.

His chest constricted.

That girl who needed his voice to fall asleep because she feared the dark—how terrified must she be now?

He quickened his pace toward the lounge, only to find Ethan Winston already kneeling by the sofa, offering Evelyn a steaming cup of tea with gentle hands.

"A full checkup would be safer." Nathan steadied his breathing as he approached. "Evans Private Hospital has better equipment."

Ethan didn't look up. "The report's right there. She needs rest, not more procedures."

"You trust some clinic's diagnosis?"

"Better than fake concern from performance artists."

The teacup clinked against the glass table.

Evelyn massaged her throbbing temples at their escalating tension. Snatching her jacket, she strode out and shut the door on their bickering.

......

Darkness surged like tidal waves.

Evelyn thrashed in her sleep, limbs leaden as if tangled in kelp. Suffocation tightened its grip until she jolted upright, pajamas soaked with cold sweat.
###Chapter 101

Darkness swallowed the entire room.

Evelyn Langley's eyes flew open, her pajamas soaked with cold sweat.

Her nails dug into her palms.

Just a dream...

She gasped for air like a beached fish.

The wind chime tinkled by the entryway.

Pushing open the French windows, briny sea air rushed to greet her.

Clouds devoured the moonlight, leaving only a few lonely lamps swaying along the shore.

The nightmare's aftertaste lingered.

Wrapping her shawl tighter, she stepped barefoot onto the cool sand.

Grains spilled between her toes.

The day's "accident" flashed through her mind.

The lifeguard's shifty gaze.

The staff's rehearsed responses.

Every detail fit together too perfectly.

A deep male voice carried from the distance.

Ethan Winston stood with his back to her near the reef.

"...preserve all surveillance footage intact."
"...no out-of-court settlements."

He turned after hanging up and met a pair of lucid eyes.

"Insomnia?" He pocketed his phone.
"Needed air." She kicked a seashell.

Under the coconut palm's shadow, silence stretched between them.
"Were you handling my case?"

Ethan nodded. "Cross-border litigation requires special preparations."
His fingers absently traced his phone's edge.

Harsh fluorescent light from a convenience store pierced the night.
"Drink?" She pointed to the illuminated beach shack.

Surprise flickered in Ethan's eyes.
"The honor is mine." He inclined his head.

The soda can opened with a crisp hiss.
Cradling coconut water, she blurted, "This wasn't the first incident."

Ethan arched an eyebrow, waiting.
"They were too practiced. Terrifyingly so."

Waves crashed against the rocks.
He offered an embossed business card. "My legal team stands ready."

Moonlight finally broke through the clouds.
Their shadows stretched long across the sand.
###Chapter 102

Evelyn Langley looked up at Dylan Lowell. The lead partner at Morningstar Law Firm, the ace attorney exclusively serving the Winston Group.

She tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear and murmured, "Thank you."

The Winston Group's legal team was unparalleled domestically. Their involvement eliminated countless bureaucratic hurdles.

For Evelyn, this went far beyond what money could solve.

Ethan Winston glanced at her, his dark eyes glinting with amusement. "I'm no saint, not even close to being a good man. It's only because the victim was you..."

The sea breeze brushed her face as Evelyn averted her gaze to the ink-black ocean. "What did you say just now? The wind was too loud."

Ethan chuckled. "Didn't hear me? I can repeat it."

Evelyn: "..." No need.

Under the same starry sky, inside a water villa at the resort.

Chloe Valentine carefully applied a luxurious face mask before the mirror.

Expensive indeed meant quality. The high-end skincare she'd once scrimped on was now hers to use freely.

With Nathan Evans' supplementary card in her possession, she could max it out without consequences.

This premium mask had noticeably brightened her complexion.

Nathan frowned at his vibrating phone from the sofa. "Chloe, your phone."

"Decline it for me. Must be the academic advisor again. So annoying!"

"Your advisor?"

"Yeah, I submitted a leave request before the trip. Why keep calling?" She rolled her eyes impatiently.

Nathan: "...Was it approved?"

"What does it matter? I'm already here. Everyone does this."

Nathan: "..."

"I'm going for a walk."

"Wait for me, I'm almost done—"

The closing door cut her off.

Nathan's thoughts drifted to Evelyn.

During their university dates, Professor Eleanor Roland's calls always interrupted them.

Data errors. Incorrect citations. When he got upset, she'd pacify him while respectfully taking the calls.

"Doesn't it bother you?" he'd once demanded.

She'd looked surprised. "Why would it? The professor's helping me."

Yes, she was always rational. After arguments, she'd initiate resolution immediately, never making unreasonable demands.

Sometimes her composure felt inhuman. That clinical detachment made him question if she loved him at all.

Wasn't it said? A woman's lack of emotion means lack of love.

But Chloe was different. A single glance from him could send her into anxious devotion, bending to his every whim.

So after six "respectful" years with Evelyn, Nathan had fallen for Chloe's worshipful gaze.
###Chapter 103

Chloe Valentine's tenderness and care gave Nathan Evans an unprecedented sense of fulfillment.

Evelyn Langley had never treated him this way.

But after actually being with Chloe, Nathan felt something was missing. It was like scratching an itch through a boot—frustrating and unsettling.

The beach under the moonlight was exceptionally enchanting.

Nathan walked aimlessly before suddenly stopping.

On a beach chair not far away, Evelyn was clinking glasses with Ethan Winston. Under the moonlight, her radiant smile was one Nathan hadn't seen in a long time.

"Nathan, what are you—"

Chloe caught up, slightly out of breath, and followed his gaze. She feigned surprise. "Evelyn and Ethan seem so close." She tilted her head, her tone innocent. "Drinking together at night—how romantic."

Nathan's jaw tightened.

"From a distance, they looked like a couple deeply in love." Chloe blinked. "But they do make a good match."

"Do you think... they planned this vacation together?"

She pretended to sneeze and leaned into Nathan. "The sea breeze is so cold..."

Her thin spaghetti-strap dress fluttered in the night wind.

Nathan remained motionless, his eyes fixed on the distant pair.

Chloe gritted her teeth discreetly, maintaining her sweet smile. "Shall we head back?"

Nathan shook off her hand and turned to leave.

"Wait for me!" Chloe hurried after him, glancing back at Evelyn with a flash of malice in her eyes.

Back at the villa, Chloe touched up her makeup in front of the mirror.

Her reflection showed flawless skin and lips like fire.

The shower stopped, and Nathan emerged, drying his hair. He went straight to the wine cabinet and poured himself a glass of red wine.

Chloe pressed against him from behind, tracing circles on his chest. "Nathan..." Her voice was sultry. "You haven't touched me lately..."

She rose on her tiptoes, her breath warm against his ear. "I miss you..."

When Nathan didn't resist, she boldly untied the sash of his robe.

"Enough."

Nathan suddenly pushed her away, his gaze icy. "I'm not in the mood."

Chloe froze, watching as he walked into the guest room.

She clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

After what happened last time, their relationship should have deepened. Instead, Nathan had grown increasingly distant.

No matter how hard she tried, he remained indifferent.
###Chapter 104

Evelyn couldn't comprehend it.

Did he think this was some twisted way of "remaining faithful" to her?

Absolutely ridiculous!

In the hotel room—

Nathan turned off all the lights, forcing himself to sleep.

But the moment he closed his eyes, images of Evelyn laughing with Ethan on the beach flooded his mind.

Their carefree laughter stabbed at his temples like needles.

He tossed and turned all night until dawn.

In the morning restaurant—

Chloe clung to his arm, cautiously studying his expression.

The elevator doors opened, revealing Ethan's long strides.

Their gazes collided midair, tension crackling between them.

Just then—

Evelyn and Sophia entered through the side door.

Ethan immediately brightened. "Good morning. Sleep well?"

His familiar tone suggested years of friendship.

But Nathan detected nothing but calculation.

Sophia nodded casually. "Decent."

Evelyn rubbed her arm. "Just too many mosquitoes."

Ethan gestured invitingly. "Join me?"

Sophia agreed readily. "Sure."

The trio walked in together, laughing, completely oblivious to Nathan in the corner.

His expression darkened instantly.

As he moved to intercept them, Ethan suddenly stopped. "Forgot something. Go ahead without me."

Once they were out of earshot, Ethan turned toward Nathan.

"What's your game?" Nathan demanded coldly.

Ethan lowered his voice. "Follow me."

He strode toward the emergency exit without waiting for a response.

Though irritated, Nathan followed.

Meanwhile—

Sophia nudged Evelyn. "You're acting different around Ethan today."

Evelyn frowned. "Nonsense."

"Don't play dumb," Sophia teased. "You're usually ice-cold with admirers."

Evelyn shoved a piece of fruit into her mouth. "He just did me a favor."

In the emergency stairwell—

Ethan got straight to the point. "My legal team's preparing to sue the hotel."

Nathan scoffed. "Here to gloat?"

"Don't you find yesterday's incident suspicious?" Ethan said meaningfully.

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "Explain."

"The shark appeared at a very convenient time," Ethan met his eyes. "But someone erased all traces of human interference."

Nathan sneered. "Stop trying to sow discord."
###Chapter 105

Nathan Evans was no fool. The moment Evelyn Langley had her accident, he sensed something amiss.

His fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk, eyes sharp as a hawk's.

Without delay, he pulled up the surveillance footage from the diving center.

After repeated reviews, the technicians concluded: the shark attack was purely accidental, and the oxygen tank malfunction mere coincidence.

"Let me explain—" Ethan Winston began.

Nathan violently shook off his hand, gaze icy. "Stay away from her. Or face the consequences."

Watching Nathan's retreating figure, Ethan fell into deep thought.

He'd deliberately avoided mentioning Chloe Valentine. Was it an oversight...or intentional?

At the end of the corridor, Chloe spotted Nathan approaching with a stormy expression. Instantly, she brightened with a saccharine smile. "Darling, let's get breakfast?"

She playfully swung his arm, eyes sparkling.

Nathan gave a noncommittal grunt, allowing her to cling to him.

His gaze swept the area—Evelyn had already vanished. Annoyed, he patted his pocket. Ethan clearly had ulterior motives...

After several days on the island, Evelyn discovered its charm extended beyond picturesque scenery to a vibrant cultural scene.

Morning sunlight danced on the ocean's surface as she exited the restaurant—only to collide with a voluptuous Latina bombshell.

The golden-curled beauty in a neon pink bikini winked at her.

Evelyn stumbled back in surprise, nearly tripping over her own feet.

"What's wrong?" Sophia Laurent asked concernedly.

"Nothing," Evelyn rubbed her nose. "Just wondering why there are so many bikinis today."

The beach was a riot of colorful swimwear, far more than usual.

"Oh my god!" Sophia gasped dramatically. "You don't know what today is?"

Evelyn looked blank.

"It's the 'Roses & Bikinis' Carnival!" Sophia squealed. "Ladies wear bikinis, men bring roses. Tonight they'll crown the Bikini Queen—winner gets a mystery prize!"

Lowering her voice conspiratorially, she added, "I picked out something special for you."

Before Evelyn could protest, she was shoved into a dressing room.

"Ready yet?" Sophia called impatiently.

A flushed face peeked out. "This...this is way too revealing..."

Sophia barged in, dragging her before a full-length mirror. "Look at that figure! Those curves! Absolute perfection!"

The reflection showed Evelyn in a wine-red lace bikini, her porcelain skin glowing against the crimson fabric.

"No way..." Evelyn scrambled to cover herself.

"Don't be shy," Sophia teased. "The string-bikini girls aren't complaining."

Just then, a phone rang.

Evelyn seized the distraction. "Go answer that!"

With an exasperated eye-roll, Sophia turned away.
###Chapter 106

"Darling, does this look good?" Chloe Valentine held up a backless sundress against her body.

Nathan Evans kept his eyes glued to his phone screen. "Mhm."

She picked up another floral dress. "How about this one? Too plain?"

"Fine."

"Then this?" She lifted a deep V-neck slip dress. "A bit sexier..."

Chloe suddenly realized Nathan hadn't glanced her way the entire time.

Her brows furrowed in irritation, but she swallowed her anger.

"Sweetheart~" She fluttered into his arms like a butterfly. "Help me choose one."

Nathan pointed absently. "That one."

"Oh! That's my favorite too!" She blinked in delight. "We're so in sync~ Now I'll..." She bit her lip. "Try it on for you?"

"Mhm."

Chloe began unbuttoning her dress right in front of him.

Only when she unhooked her bra did Nathan finally look up. His gaze was as indifferent as if studying furniture.

"What are you doing?" He frowned.

She froze.

"Is the dressing room broken?"

"...I'll go now." Grabbing the dress, she fled in embarrassment.

When she returned, Nathan was massaging his temples. This impromptu vacation had left a backlog of company documents he'd just finished.

"Ready?" He stood.

"Y-yes."

"Let's go." He walked out without looking back.

Chloe's enthusiasm evaporated. But she quickly rallied—once other men admired her on the beach, he'd get jealous.

She deliberately tugged her neckline lower.

"Wait for me~"

The beach swarmed with people.

Colorful bikinis and swim trunks glinted under the sun. Chloe purposefully kept distance from Nathan, drawing appreciative whistles.

Nathan ignored them all, heading straight for a lounge chair.

Chloe hovered awkwardly.

She came to enjoy herself, not endure indifference. But for Nathan, she'd swallow anything.

"Hi, beautiful Eastern rose." A blond Adonis approached. "From China?"

She flashed a sweet smile. "Yes! Your Mandarin is excellent."

"I teach it at university..."

Their conversation flowed, but Chloe kept stealing glances at Nathan's reaction.
###Chapter 107

Nathan Evans lay with his eyes closed, breathing evenly. Exhaustion had rendered him oblivious to the surrounding commotion.

"Wow!" A blond foreigner gasped dramatically. "Absolutely breathtaking!"

Chloe Valentine followed his gaze. Evelyn Langley emerged from the changing room in a modest black swimsuit, a white chiffon scarf draped carelessly over her shoulders. The ocean breeze made the delicate fabric dance.

"My God! She's like the Venus of the East!"

Chloe's voice turned icy. "You think she's pretty?"

The man nodded enthusiastically. "Have you seen Monet's Water Lilies? That same ethereal beauty—"

Clenching her teeth, Chloe demanded, "What about me?"

"You're beautiful too," he answered politely.

"Who's more beautiful?"

"That's... difficult." He hesitated. "But that lady aligns more with my taste."

Chloe's face darkened instantly.

She stood tall with porcelain skin and cascading waves of hair—every inch the seductress. Meanwhile, Evelyn's swimsuit covered her from neck to thigh, its conservative cut bordering on prudish.

Yet that very restraint made her stand out on the beach. The semi-transparent scarf accentuated her understated elegance, embodying the mystique of Eastern beauty.

What infuriated Chloe most was Nathan suddenly opening his eyes.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn, flashing with awe, regret, longing—an intensity that startled even himself.

Chloe dug her nails into her palms.

Who did this gold-digger think she was? Playing the innocent bookworm at libraries while hunting for her next sugar daddy!

"Darling," she purred, leaning into Nathan. "Would you get jealous if another man gave me roses?"

She deliberately blocked his view.

"You're too close. It's hot." Nathan shoved her away impatiently.

"Should I get you a drink?"

The moment Chloe left, his eyes tracked Evelyn again.

......

"You actually wore that boring black suit?" Sophia Laurent huffed. "It's so dull."

Evelyn adjusted her scarf. "I prefer this."

"Don't complain when nobody gives you roses later."

"Please don't let anyone—" Evelyn waved her hands frantically.

But fate had other plans.

As the sun dipped, rose distribution began on the beach. Nearly every passing man offered Evelyn a crimson bloom.

She declined at first, but the crowd grew relentless. Amid cheers and encouragement, she reluctantly accepted the mounting pile of roses in her arms.
###Chapter 108

Sophia Laurent's eyes widened in disbelief.

She stared at the mountain of roses piled before Evelyn Langley, then down at the measly few in her own hands. Confusion etched across her face.

This wasn't how things were supposed to go!

Evelyn looked equally bewildered.

She'd deliberately changed out of that eye-catching bikini—so why was she attracting even more attention now?

By the poolside, Nathan Evans' gaze darkened.

His knuckles turned white as he glared at Evelyn surrounded by admirers.

Chloe Valentine trembled with rage.

Her carefully selected sexy swimsuit went unnoticed while Evelyn, in that modest one-piece, became the center of attention.

"How dare she?"

Chloe's teeth ground together.

Evelyn simply stood there effortlessly.

Beneath her wide-brimmed straw hat, sunlight gilded her porcelain skin with a soft glow. Pale ribbons fluttered in the breeze, enhancing her ethereal grace.

As she turned to speak with Sophia, the slight curve of her lips captivated every man nearby.

"Furious?"

Ethan Winston materialized beside Nathan.

Following Nathan's gaze, he chuckled. "She was never meant to be anyone's possession."

Nathan's fist clenched tighter.

"She shines brighter than you realize." Ethan's eyes burned with intensity. "You can't cage that kind of light."

With a mocking smile, he added, "Lost your rose, now regretting it? Too bad—"

A fist whizzed past his cheek before he could finish.

Nathan sneered. "You're in no position to lecture me."

His voice turned venomous. "I cultivated that rose myself. Every inch of her bears my mark. Six years—do you even know which side she prefers to sleep on?"

Ethan's expression faltered.

"The bond between us," Nathan enunciated each word, "is beyond your reach."

For the first time, Ethan dropped his playful demeanor.

He had to admit Nathan was right. No matter how far Evelyn strayed, she'd always return to this man.

Chloe witnessed everything, nails digging into her palms.

Jealousy threatened to consume her.

Why?

Why did every exceptional man lose their minds over Evelyn Langley?

......

The rose contest results held no suspense.

Evelyn won by a landslide, crowned the undisputed Rose Queen.

Sophia snapped photos frantically, hands shaking with excitement.

"Congratulations to our Eastern beauty!"

The blonde host beamed, presenting a velvet box.

"Now, let our Rose Queen unveil the mystery grand prize!"

The crowd held its breath.

Evelyn's slender fingers rested lightly on the lid.

"Three... two... one—"

Just as she lifted it—
###Chapter 109

The hiss of a snake's tongue pierced the silence.

Evelyn Langley had just accepted the gift box when a black-and-white banded krait suddenly struck out. Its sinuous body coiled, venomous fangs glinting coldly.

"Look out!"

She instinctively flung the box away—too late.

The serpent lunged through the air, aiming straight for her slender wrist.

Chaos erupted instantly. The host shrieked and stumbled backward as the audience dissolved into panic.

Two figures surged forward simultaneously.

Nathan Evans was closer. In one fluid motion, he yanked Evelyn into his arms. His movement left the back of his neck completely exposed to the snake's strike.

"Move!"

Chloe Valentine's shout sliced through the air.

She threw herself forward without hesitation, shielding Nathan's back with her body.

The fangs sank deep into her calf.

"Ugh..." Chloe gasped, her face draining of color. She staggered, collapsing into Nathan's arms.

"Are you insane?" Nathan's voice shook.

Chloe managed a weak smile. "You're...safe...that's what matters..."

Blood seeped from the wound, staining her white dress crimson.

Nathan's pupils constricted. Dropping to one knee, he clamped a hand above the injury. "Hold on. Medics are coming."

Chloe's breathing grew ragged. Her trembling fingers clutched his collar. "Don't...worry..."

Before she could finish, darkness claimed her.

"Chloe!" Nathan's shout cracked with desperation. "Medevac! Now!"

The medical team arrived at last. After emergency treatment, they rushed the stretcher toward the helipad.

Nathan never released Chloe's hand, leaping into the helicopter after her.

As rotor blades thundered overhead, Sophia Laurent curled her lip. "What an Oscar-worthy performance."

She turned to Evelyn.

The girl stood frozen, as if her soul had fled. Her lashes fluttered while watching the departing aircraft.

Every flicker of Nathan's panic, anguish, and terror had seared itself into her vision.

"Evelyn?" Sophia touched her shoulder.

Evelyn mechanically shook her head. "I'm fine."

Her attempted smile felt like lifting lead weights.

"Let's go." The whisper barely carried.

Sophia frowned, wrapping an arm around her friend's slender frame. "Alright. Home."

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground. Evelyn never looked back.
###Chapter 110

"I'm fine." Evelyn Langley quickly composed herself, a faint smile curling her lips. "He's doing well now." She added softly, "Much better than before."

She hoped this time he could truly find his own happiness.

Ethan Winston observed everything, his lips unconsciously lifting.

Nathan Evans was completely out of the picture.

......

Chloe Valentine had a strong constitution. Combined with the timely antivenom injection, she recovered quickly.

After the doctor confirmed she was fine, they returned to the island.

As an extra precaution, Nathan arranged for a private physician to accompany them.

In the room, Chloe lay weakly on the bed as the doctor examined her.

Nathan stood by the bedside, itching to step outside for air.

"Nathan..." Chloe suddenly grabbed his sleeve, her voice trembling. "I'm scared..."

"Don't leave, okay?"

"What if... what if we encounter another snake?"

Remembering how she'd risked herself to save him, Nathan's heart softened. "Alright, I'll stay with you."

Only then did Chloe relax with a nod.

The doctor finished the examination, removed the IV, and left.

Chloe tried to sit up, and Nathan reached out to steady her.

She leaned into his embrace. "The wound hurts so much... Will it scar?"

"The doctor said it won't."

"But it really hurts..."

"The medication was just applied. Bear with it a little longer."

Nathan suddenly recalled their university days—how Evelyn had sprained her ankle during a fitness test but stubbornly finished the 800-meter run.

By the time they got her to the hospital, her ankle was horrifically swollen. The doctor had angrily slammed the table, but she'd only teared up slightly.

He'd called her foolish, but she'd just smiled and said, "Failing means not graduating... Besides, I'm already in so much pain, and you're still scolding me..."

"Nathan?" Chloe shook his arm. "What are you thinking about?"

"Hmm?"

"I was saying... what if it really leaves a scar?"

The thought of permanent snakebite marks on her leg made her want to cry.

"Medical technology is advanced now. Even if it scars, it can be treated." Nathan patiently reassured her.

Chloe suddenly wrapped her arms around his waist. "Will you dislike me because of it?"

Before he could answer, she continued, "Even if you do, I won't leave you. I love you. That will never change."

Nathan froze for a moment before gently stroking her hair, unsure how to respond.

"Thank you," he finally said after a long pause. "If it weren't for you, I'd be the one lying here now. Whatever you want, I'll give it to you."

"I don't want your gratitude." Chloe lifted her face, her eyes brimming with emotion. "I'd do anything for you."

"I know you still can't forget Evelyn... It's okay. I can wait."

"One day, your heart will belong only to me."

"You protect her. I'll protect you."
###Chapter 111

"I love you, just like you love Evelyn. You can't have her, and I can't have you."

"So if you ask what I want, I just want to stay by your side."

Chloe Valentine's voice was soft, her gaze sincere to the point of vulnerability.

Nathan Evans felt a tremor in his chest. "From now on, I'll take care of you. I won't let you get hurt again."

A faint smile touched her lips as she buried herself in his embrace, arms tightening around his waist. "I know. I've always believed in you."

Nathan held her closer.

Yet an inexplicable heaviness settled in his heart.

He couldn't pinpoint the reason.

......

Hotel staff swiftly handled the incident.

Given the safety concerns, the manager immediately called the police.

Officers questioned everyone involved that same night.

Unsurprisingly, the case was ruled an accident.

"Snakes are common in tropical regions," an officer explained.

"Poisonous ones?" Sophia Laurent countered coldly.

"Well..."

"On a crowded beach? Is that normal?"

Both the officer and hotel manager fell silent.

Sophia smirked. "This is the second time my friend has been endangered on this island. This isn't over! Come on, Evelyn."

She pulled Evelyn Langley away forcefully.

"Don't be angry," Evelyn soothed gently.

"You almost died and you're this calm? I'm more upset than you are!"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "The game isn't won in a single move."

"What do you mean? Do you have a plan?"

"No."

Sophia: "..."

"With all these incidents, I'm really worried..."

"That, I can handle," Evelyn said suddenly.

"How?"

"Guess."

......

After the scare, hunger finally caught up with them.

They headed to the restaurant for a proper meal.

After dinner, Sophia received a call and left beaming for her date.

Evelyn walked alone north along the shoreline.

Five minutes later, twinkling lights came into view.

The rich aroma of spiced broth wafted through the air.

Maldives had spiced delicacies too?

Following the scent, she arrived at a small shop.

The bold calligraphy sign read "Taste Pavilion."

A Chinese-owned business?

Pushing the door open, she found an antique store instead.

The shopkeeper was simmering chicken feet, the fragrance overwhelming.

The space was modest—antiques displayed on shelves by the entrance, the rest cluttered with odd trinkets.

A tiny figurine in gold-rimmed glasses caught Evelyn's eye.

Smaller than her palm, yet every wrinkle on its shirt was lifelike.

"You've got good taste," the shopkeeper greeted warmly. "I made these myself. Perfect souvenirs to take home."
###Chapter 112

Evelyn's fingertips lightly traced the delicate seashell brooch. Sunlight streamed through the shop window, casting fragmented glimmers across its surface.

"Wrap it up, please." She offered the shopkeeper a faint smile.

The shopkeeper efficiently packaged the item, slipping a postcard inside. "Writing down your troubles might help ease your mind."

Evelyn accepted the bag, her fingers brushing the postcard's edge briefly before she remained silent.

Back at the hotel, she carelessly placed the gift bag on her nightstand. Emerging from her shower, she found the Maldives-themed postcard lying quietly on the desk.

After several seconds of staring, she turned and tossed it into a drawer.

......

Morning sunlight flooded the restaurant.

Ethan Winston scanned the room for the third time before his gaze settled on Sophia Laurent dining alone.

"Looking for someone, Mr. Winston?" Sophia speared a piece of fruit with her fork, her smile laced with implication.

Ethan sat directly across from her.

"Morning." His eyes flicked to her drink. "The milk looks good."

"This is soy milk." Sophia shook her glass. "Can't even tell the difference?"

Ethan remained impassive. "Where's Evelyn?"

"So concerned about my best friend?" Sophia set down her fork. "Did your investment bank hit this year's targets already?"

Ethan chuckled. "Never too busy to see someone special."

Sophia suddenly turned serious. "I thought you and Nathan were brothers."

"Not anymore."

"Because of Evelyn?"

His silence spoke volumes.

Sophia burst into laughter. "Nathan Evans finally gets his comeuppance!"

Ethan arched an eyebrow.

"Fine then." Sophia dabbed her lips. "Good luck."

"Where is she?"

Sophia checked her watch. "At this hour..." She drew out the words. "She should be at the airport."

Ethan shot to his feet.

Watching his hurried departure, Sophia recalled Evelyn's words from last night: "If I can't escape, then I'll simply change locations."
###Chapter 113

Dawn's first light crept across the sky as Ethan Winston stepped out of the restaurant.

Nathan Evans collided with him at the entrance.

Nathan's brow furrowed.

His gaze swept through every corner of the dining area, but the familiar figure was nowhere in sight.

"Darling, who are you looking for?" Chloe Valentine clung to his arm, a sly glint flashing in her eyes.

Nathan withdrew his attention. "Your leg injury hasn't healed. You shouldn't be walking around."

"Lying in bed too long makes me feel moldy." Chloe blinked playfully. "I wanted to have breakfast with you."

"What would you like?"

"A sandwich with warm milk, thank you darling~"

By noon, Nathan had visited every restaurant on the island.

As evening fell, he paced restlessly along the beach.

Night descended. Only Sophia Laurent dined alone in the Chinese restaurant.

Ethan and Evelyn Langley had both vanished.

The realization made Nathan's skin prickle. He stood abruptly, grabbing a shawl from the chairback.

"Evelyn left this." He handed the shawl to Sophia.

Sophia, mid-laugh with her male companion, blurted out, "She returned this after—"

Her words cut off abruptly.

"Nathan Evans!" Sophia's eyes widened. "You tricked me?"

The man's gaze sharpened like a blade. "She went back to the country?"

"None of your business." Sophia turned her face away.

Nathan had his answer. He spun on his heel, pulling out his phone to call his assistant. "Book the earliest flight back."

"Will Miss Valentine be joining you?" Lin Ming asked cautiously.

"Sweetheart~" Chloe limped after him. "I heard there's a yacht gala the day after tomorrow. Shall we go?"

Nathan paused.

Lin Ming still waited on the line.

"...Cancel the booking." Nathan ended the call.

Chloe wore an apologetic expression. "Did I interrupt your work?"

"It's nothing." He pocketed his phone, but his eyes drifted toward the horizon.
###Chapter 114

The girl's eyes curved into crescents. "Great news! The doctor said the wound is healing well..."

At the mention of her injury, Nathan Evans' gaze instantly softened.

"Let's take a cruise?" She tugged his sleeve lightly. "I heard the Captain's Dinner is amazing..." Her voice dripped with honeyed sweetness.

Nathan found himself agreeing. "Alright."

"Mwah! Love you most~"

......

The icy wind at Kyoto Airport cut like knives.

Evelyn Langley shivered the moment she stepped out of the terminal. She tightened her down jacket, but the bone-chilling cold still seeped through.

Glazed frost coated the tree branches as freezing rain drizzled down. The usually bustling road stood eerily empty.

Her phone showed the rideshare stuck five kilometers away—estimated arrival in thirty minutes.

Just as she debated canceling the order, a black sedan pulled up smoothly.

The window lowered, revealing Adrian Klein's striking profile. His gray turtleneck accentuated his sharp jawline, the Adam's apple faintly visible.

"Get in." His tone was clipped. "Impossible to get a cab now."

Blissful warmth enveloped her inside.

Adrian retrieved a hand warmer from the compartment. "Use this first."

Evelyn's numb fingers gradually regained feeling. "Thanks. Thought I'd turn into an ice sculpture." She chuckled self-deprecatingly.

"Traffic restrictions reduced rideshares," he explained.

"That explains it..." Realization dawned. "Wait, why are you at the airport?"

"Pickup." His eyes remained on the road. "Flight got rescheduled."

Truth was, he'd spotted that familiar figure shivering in the rearview mirror.

The light turned red.

"Still cold?" he asked.

"Much better." She rubbed her hands. "Hard to adjust after the tropics."

Suddenly remembering, she dug out a small box from her bag. "For you."

Adrian blinked. "A gift?"

"Everyone got something." Smiling, she opened it—revealing a chibi figurine of a bespectacled man in a suit, sitting primly with a book.

He studied the round-faced doll for a long moment. "Aside from the glasses, what's similar?"
###Chapter 115

Evelyn Langley dangled the ceramic figurine in front of Adrian Klein. "Look, this expression is so you."

Adrian raised an eyebrow at her.

"Now it doesn’t look like you anymore." She pouted and shoved the figurine into his hand.

He took it, his fingers brushing over the smooth ceramic surface. "Thanks."

"Green light." Evelyn pointed across the street.

...

The apartment was silent in the early hours.

Evelyn pushed open the door to a spotless interior. The cleaning service she’d booked before her trip had done an impeccable job—even the potted plants on the windowsill were neatly trimmed.

Hot water washed away her exhaustion. She sank into the fluffy bedding, breathing in the familiar lavender scent, and sighed contentedly.

Home was best.

Adrian’s apartment still had its lights on.

With his experiment at a critical stage, he’d barely had time to spare for the airport trip. After showering and changing into a fresh shirt, he grabbed his coat to head out.

The ceramic figurine stood quietly in the center of the bookshelf.

He paused mid-step.

It really did resemble him.

...

By mid-January, heavy snow blanketed the entire city.

Evelyn pulled back the curtains to a world of white. Before eight, children’s laughter already drifted up from downstairs.

She bundled up in her down jacket and headed out for groceries.

A row of snowmen lined the courtyard, the tallest one sporting a pink pinwheel like a chubby Doraemon. Evelyn stopped to admire them before plucking a cherry tomato from her basket and giving one snowman a red nose.

A long queue snaked in front of the butcher’s stall. She selected a prime cut of beef ribs, planning to make half into spicy jerky and the other half into soup.

Knock knock knock—

The doorbell rang just as the aroma of beef broth filled the kitchen.

Mrs. Zhang from the third floor stood at the door, holding red eggs. "We’ve welcomed a baby girl. Sharing the joy with everyone."

Evelyn hastily wiped her hands and accepted them. "Congratulations!"

She turned to retrieve homemade pastries and sauces from the fridge. "Please try these."

"Oh, I couldn’t—"

"Consider it taste-testing for me." Evelyn smiled as she pressed them into her hands.

Mrs. Zhang suddenly lowered her voice. "By the way, Professor Klein next door is never home. Could you pass these to him? I need to rush to the hospital with dinner."

Before Evelyn could respond, the elevator doors closed with a ding.
###Chapter 116

Evelyn Langley stared blankly at the red egg in her palm. She remembered clearly—Adrian Klein had always avoided hard-boiled eggs.

...

At ten o'clock in the silent night, snowflakes drifted down.

Adrian closed his black umbrella, letting the accumulated snow slide off before melting into puddles on the steps.

Abnormal lab data had forced him to pull three consecutive all-nighters. Even for someone of his caliber, the exhaustion was undeniable.

With the New Year approaching, lanterns lined the streets.

He massaged his temples. Finally, he'd managed to contain the margin of error within safe limits, so he'd given the team two days off.

Just as his key turned in the lock, a door creaked open behind him.

Warm yellow light spilled through the gap, illuminating the dim hallway. Evelyn's voice carried an unusual warmth for winter: "Professor Klein, you're back early today. The lady on the third floor just had a granddaughter and sent over some red eggs..."

Adrian's mind was still tangled in lab data. By the time he snapped back to reality, a bamboo basket had been pressed into his hands—filled with red eggs and steaming beef bone soup.

"Thanks." His voice was hoarse.

A draft swept through the corridor, making Evelyn hunch her shoulders. "The soup was just reheated. You should—"

"Got it."

The light switched off, plunging the hallway back into silence.

Standing in the foyer, Adrian suddenly noticed how much emptier his apartment felt. He unscrewed the thermos—tender radishes swam in rich broth.

His gaze lingered on the red eggs. After a brief hesitation, he peeled one. Paired with hot soup, it went down surprisingly easily.

...

Warmth spread from his stomach to his limbs. Sinking into the couch, his tightly wound nerves finally relaxed.

His phone buzzed on the coffee table. The family group chat, no doubt.

Working abroad in previous years had spared him these gatherings. Now that he'd returned, there was no escaping them.

His mother's concern, his siblings' greetings, his father's terse reminders. He replied to each, promising to visit soon.

As he drained the thermos, a thought struck him.

The next time they met would likely be after the New Year.

Would she stay in the city for the holidays?

...

Adrian found himself at Evelyn's door for the third time, idly spinning the empty thermos in his hand.

The apartment was silent.

At that very moment, Evelyn was wheeling her suitcase toward the train station. For the first time in six years, she'd bought a ticket home.

Her finger had hovered over the confirmation button, the booking page opened and closed repeatedly—until she finally pressed it.

Some knots could only be untangled in person.
###Chapter 117

The morning market buzzed with the pungent smell of fish and the lively haggling of vendors. William Langley weaved through the stalls with a woven basket in hand.

"Professor Langley, what fish would you like today?" The fishmonger greeted him warmly.

"A fresh perch, please."

"Coming right up!" The vendor deftly scooped a flapping perch from the tank. "How about this one?"

William inspected it carefully. "This will do."

As the fishmonger scaled the fish with practiced ease, he remarked, "Professor, I heard your daughter studies at Harvard? That's impressive."

William smiled faintly. "She works very hard."

"Actually..." The vendor hesitated. "My son Zhifei is in his second year of high school. I heard there are recommendation spots for the Physics Olympiad?"

William accepted the wrapped fish. "The selection is extremely rigorous. It requires exceptional talent in physics."

"My son ranked top ten in his grade for physics!" The fishmonger pressed eagerly.

William scanned his phone to pay. "The competition problems far exceed textbook difficulty. Specialized training is necessary. The slots have already been finalized."

The vendor's expression darkened. "I... see. Sorry to bother you."

William nodded and turned to leave. Behind him, the fishmonger muttered under his breath, "Who does he think he is? Just afraid someone might outshine his precious daughter..."

"Vanessa, what are you saying?" The neighboring stall owner asked curiously.

The fishmonger sniffed. "His daughter's a Harvard elite. What would someone like him care about our ordinary kids?"

"That can't be true. Professor Langley seems like a decent man."

"Decent my foot!" The vendor curled her lip. "Rumor has it his daughter dropped out ages ago. She's some rich man's mistress now!"

"You can't spread rumors like that!"

"My cousin saw it with her own eyes in Boston!" The fishmonger embellished dramatically. "All dressed up, stepping out of a luxury car..."

William's steps faltered slightly. His grip tightened around the basket handle. Taking a deep breath, he continued walking forward.
###Chapter 118

"If she had a decent job, why wouldn't she come home for years? Must be too ashamed to show her face. In a small town like ours, gossip spreads fast. Professor Langley's probably trying to keep it under wraps. How else could he hold his head up at school?"

"Tsk tsk..."

William Langley remained oblivious to these whispers.

Even if he heard them, he'd stay silent.

To him, his daughter was no different from those kept women in gilded cages.

......

Evelyn stepped out of the train station. A cold wind slapped her face, making her instinctively tighten her down jacket.

Though Linshi was warmer than the capital, winter's bite still pierced to the bone.

The taxi crawled forward, passing scenery that gradually overlapped with her childhood memories.

Tourism had transformed Linshi in recent years. Old streets now gleamed with new life, dotted with parks and green spaces.

Only the historic district remained unchanged, divided from the modern city by the quiet river.

In summer, pleasure boats crisscrossed the water. Now, thin ice fractured at the slightest touch, scattering sunlight into glittering fragments.

The ancient stone arch bridge still stood. Beyond it lay the faculty housing complex of Linshi No.2 High School.

William Langley—top physics graduate from Harvard—had been specially recruited to teach there. Within a year, he became department head.

His physics Olympiad team produced countless international champions.

These students now thrived in prestigious careers. His legacy truly bore fruits everywhere.

Outstanding results earned him early eligibility for subsidized housing—the youngest teacher ever granted that privilege.

Remembering her father, Evelyn's eyes burned.

"...I educated you for this? Throwing away your future over some man?!"

"What right do I have to teach, with a daughter like you?"

"Walk out that door today, don't ever come back!"

"Evelyn, would you really choose him over your own parents?"

"Fine! From now on, you're no daughter of mine!"

......

"Miss, we're here." The driver's voice yanked her back to the present.

Evelyn hastily wiped her eyes and scanned her payment. "Thank you."

The Langley home occupied the ground floor with a small courtyard. Her mother loved wisteria, so her father built a trellis.

Every spring, purple blossoms cascaded like waterfalls. She'd spend hours reading beneath that floral canopy.

Noticing her fondness, he'd added a swing. As she grew older, it gathered dust.

Six years gone—did the wisteria and swing still remain?

Evelyn took a deep breath and knocked.
###Chapter 119

Knock. Knock. Knock.

William Langley wiped his hands on a dish towel as he hurried from the kitchen. The freshly steamed perch on the cutting board still emitted wisps of aromatic steam. He carefully transferred the fish to the dining table before answering the door.

In the living room, Victoria Langley paused her watering can mid-air. "Who's there?" she called toward the foyer. "Is that Adrian coming early?"

"Adrian said he wouldn't arrive until the day after tomorrow," William replied while walking. "Probably Vanessa from next door bringing those organic eggs we asked about..."

The door swung open.

Evelyn Langley stood on the doorstep, staring at the father she hadn't seen in six years. More silver streaked his temples than she remembered. Deep grooves carved his forehead like weathered stone. The man who once lifted her effortlessly now stood slightly stooped.

"Dad..."

William froze. His expression cycled through shock, anger, then settled into icy detachment. "Why did you come back?"

Silence swallowed the house. Victoria set down her watering can with a clatter and stepped into the courtyard. "William? Who is—"

The metal can hit the paving stones when she recognized their visitor.

Evelyn's eyes burned. Time had been kind to her mother, preserving the same elegant grace. Her voice trembled. "Mom..."

Victoria's lips quivered before she managed, "Come inside first."

The living room air turned viscous.

William sat rigid on the sofa, his face stormy. "Have you forgotten what you said?"

That rainy night six years ago played vividly in Evelyn's mind. When her father rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital, he'd learned she'd abandoned her direct PhD admission for a man. His blood pressure had spiked so severely he required emergency treatment.

She'd declared then, without hesitation: between love and academia, she chose the former. No regrets.

"You're no daughter of mine." William turned away. "I didn't raise someone like you."

"William!" Victoria patted his back urgently. "Your blood pressure again?"

She glanced at their daughter, torn between anger and heartache. This stubborn girl had refused all reason back then. As a mystery novelist who'd crafted countless headstrong heroines, Victoria never imagined her own child would outdo them all.

"Your father's health isn't what it was," Victoria said sternly. "If you still consider this your home, don't upset him further."

Tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks.

"Mom, Dad... I know I was wrong." Her voice fractured. "Dad always wanted me to soar higher. I failed you."

She turned to her mother. "You taught me independence and strength, but I—"

"I came back to beg your forgiveness." She bowed deeply. "Please give me a chance to make things right."
###Chapter 120

Six years.

Evelyn Langley stood before her childhood home, fingers hovering over the doorbell.

She couldn't bring herself to press it.

The thought of seeing disappointment in her parents' eyes terrified her.
Even worse was imagining their heartbreak.

That stubborn girl who'd stormed out years ago had finally tasted the bitter fruit of reality.

"Ding-dong—"

The door swung open faster than expected.

William Langley's grip on the doorknob faltered.
Victoria Langley's watering can clattered to the ground.

"Dad... Mom..." Evelyn's suitcase wheels caught on the threshold. "I..."

Words failed her.

William's brows knitted together. "Decided to come home, did you?"

Victoria shoved her husband aside, pulling their daughter inside with red-rimmed eyes. "You've lost so much weight..."

Tears splattered onto the foyer tiles.

"I was wrong." Her voice trembled. "So wrong."

William turned away, his Adam's apple bobbing violently.

Victoria dug her nails into her palms.
Her stubborn mule of a daughter never admitted fault. What horrors had she endured to say those words?

"Dinner first." William's gruff command cut through the tension as he marched toward the kitchen.

Steam still rose from the dishes.

The sweet and sour fish bore uneven sauce streaks—her father's handiwork.
The greens were overcooked—her mother's signature dish ruined.

Evelyn's tears dripped into her rice bowl.

"Stop that!" William slammed his palm on the table. "Eat!"

Victoria kicked him under the table.

"I'd like to spend New Year's at home." Evelyn picked at her food. "If that's okay."

The house plunged into deafening silence.

William set his chopsticks down with a clatter. "Your bedroom's untouched."

Victoria's dam finally broke.
She crushed her daughter's frail frame against her. "You wretched girl! Do you know how long we've waited to hear that?"

Evelyn inhaled her mother's familiar shampoo scent.

Six years of pent-up sorrow erupted.

William fumbled with the tissue box, upending it entirely.

"Conjunctivitis!" he barked. "Acts up every winter!"

Victoria laughed through tears. "William, boil some eggs. Her eyes will swell."

"The fish isn't finished—"

"I'll get pork belly!"

"You don't even know where the market moved!"

As her parents bickered, Evelyn gazed out the window.

The rain had stopped.
Sunlight pierced the clouds, painting rainbows across puddles.
###Chapter 121

The kitchen wafted with tempting aromas. William Langley carefully carried out a steaming bowl. "I learned this seafood soup recipe. Tell me how it tastes."

The dining table was laden with dishes. Glazed pork meatballs glistened crimson. Golden potatoes braised with pork belly looked tender. Freshly sautéed greens shone emerald. And there, the centerpiece—a whole steamed perch, just out of the pot.

Victoria deftly picked the tenderest portion from the fish's belly, placing it in her daughter's bowl. "Your father never gets the steaming time right. I supervised this one—it should suit your taste."

"Since when is my timing off?" William protested. "I call it innovative cooking!"

Victoria shook her head with a chuckle. "Of course. Our master chef here creates unique dishes."

"Exactly!" William puffed his chest. "Mr. Li downstairs asked for my cooking tips just yesterday!"

"Yes, yes, our culinary genius." Victoria served him meat. "Eat before everything cools."

"That sounded half-hearted!" William turned to their daughter. "Evelyn, doesn't Dad cook well?"

He added another fish slice to her bowl. "Try this properly."

Watching her parents banter, Evelyn's lips curved upward.

The fish melted on her tongue, its natural sweetness blooming. William knew his daughter preferred clean flavors—just ginger and scallions to remove any fishiness, finished with a drizzle of steamed fish soy sauce.

Memories surfaced. The kitchen had always been her father's domain. Victoria rarely cooked, mastering only steamed fish and scrambled eggs with tomatoes—because Evelyn loved them.

After school, young Evelyn would wait in William's office. At dusk, he'd pedal his worn bicycle through bustling markets, her perched behind. Vendors greeted him like old friends. Victoria avoided markets, disliking the noise and claiming poor ingredient judgment.

Though no chef, Victoria critiqued William's dishes relentlessly—fueling his competitive spirit until his skills rivaled professionals.

After leaving home, Nathan Evans had taken over caretaking. Now roles reversed, Evelyn understood her father's devotion.

"Nothing compares to your fish, Dad. Not even Michelin chefs."

William's eyes glistened. "Come home anytime. I'll cook for you."

After dinner, Victoria washed and sliced fruits bought that afternoon. Finding the living room empty, she stepped into the yard.

Under amber patio lights, father and daughter sat around a firepit. Sparks crackled occasionally, illuminating their matching smiles.

"Try these strawberries," Victoria offered the platter. "Exceptionally sweet this year—just like you loved as a child."

Dewdrops clung to ruby berries, their sugary fragrance irresistible.
###Chapter 122

Evelyn took a bite of the strawberry, its juice bursting between her lips. She squinted slightly, her lips curling into an unconscious smile. "So sweet."

Victoria watched her daughter's content expression, her heart stirring. She reached out and grasped Evelyn's slender wrist, her thumb gently brushing over the prominent bone. "Why have you gotten so thin?"

"I'm not thin," Evelyn protested with puffed cheeks, popping another strawberry into her mouth. "I actually gained two pounds last week."

She deliberately pinched her own cheek, the soft flesh spilling between her fingers. "See? Plenty of meat here."

"I was just wondering if I should go on a diet—"

William immediately set down his newspaper, his brow furrowing. "Nonsense! Girls these days are always talking about losing weight."

He recalled the neighbor's daughter who had been hospitalized from extreme dieting, his tone turning stern. "Skinny as a twig, blown over by the slightest breeze—what's attractive about that?"

Evelyn stuck out her tongue playfully and leaned into Victoria's embrace. "I was just joking."

Victoria flicked her forehead lightly. "Don't even think about it. If you come back skinnier next time, you'll see what happens."

"Got it, Mom." Evelyn nuzzled against her mother's shoulder.

The room fell quiet, the only sound the occasional crackle of wood in the fireplace. Victoria combed her fingers through her daughter's long hair before finally asking softly, "These past years... have you been okay?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled, the strawberry juice staining her nails red. "I've been fine," she murmured, staring at her fingers. "It's all in the past now."

"What about... him?" Victoria asked cautiously. "He didn't come back with you?"

The air suddenly grew heavy.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, her voice as calm as if discussing the weather. "We broke up a long time ago."

The argument from six years ago flashed before her eyes—her father walking away with his cane, her mother's tear-filled gaze, and herself stubbornly rooted in place, watching them disappear into the distance.

She had expected reproach, but instead, her father simply added another log to the fire.

"An unsuitable match is better ended early," William said, his voice blending with the crackling flames, unexpectedly gentle.

Evelyn suddenly felt her eyes grow hot.

...

On New Year's Eve morning, Evelyn was still deep in sleep when her door was pounded loudly.

"Weren't we supposed to go shopping for the holiday?" Victoria stood at the doorway, torn between exasperation and amusement at the sight of her daughter's disheveled hair and crooked pajamas. "The sun's already up."

Evelyn squinted at her phone. "It's only seven..."

"The fresh fish at the market will be sold out by now!" Victoria pushed her straight into the bathroom. "Hurry up and wash. Your father made pork rib congee."

Ten minutes later, Evelyn came downstairs with her hair in a ponytail, but her father was nowhere to be seen in the dining room.

"Where's Dad?"

"Something came up at school." Victoria ladled a bowl of congee for her. "The principal called early this morning."

Just then, the phone rang abruptly. Victoria stepped into the courtyard to answer, her voice suddenly rising. "How could they make such an arrangement?"

Evelyn froze mid-bite of her fried dough stick—she had never heard her mother sound so agitated and hurt before.
###Chapter 123

"How dare you call my writing trash? Do you even understand literary creation?"

"...I know you mean well, but that fast-food literature isn't the style I want. I can adapt, but at least give me a transition period?"

"...I need time to think. Let's end it here."

Victoria Langley hung up and turned to meet her daughter's concerned gaze. She forced a smile. "Just some disagreements with the publishing house."

"Mom, you look pale."

"It's nothing." Victoria rubbed her temples. "Traditional publishing is struggling. My editor suggested I switch to online novels. But me—a mystery writer—suddenly writing urban romance..."

"Urban romance?" Evelyn Langley's eyes widened.

Victoria nodded bitterly.

A legend in mystery fiction, Victoria had skyrocketed to fame a decade ago with The Weapon. Her follow-up The Deserted School sold over a million copies. That year, the top five spots on bestseller lists all bore her name.

Her current editor had sought her out during that golden era.

With sharp instincts and earnest persistence, the editor made multiple house calls until Victoria—moved by her dedication—signed a ten-year contract.

Little did she know it would become the turning point of her career.

Since then, every idea Victoria proposed got rejected as "not marketable." Outlines that barely got approved always required last-minute revisions. After endless edits, her original creative spark had long faded.

A decade's worth of discarded drafts now filled her study drawers.

She hadn't stopped publishing entirely.

Under strong editorial pressure, Victoria reluctantly wrote a campus romance novel. It coincided with a youth drama boom, and the publisher hoped to cash in on adaptation rights.

But this wasn't her forte.

Two years of planning, one year of polishing—by publication time, trends had shifted. Youth literature became labeled "shallow" and "melodramatic," making Victoria's new work an easy target.

Longtime fans accused her of betraying her roots. Critics slammed her "twisted values." Online trolls even speculated she'd sold her pen name.

Insomnia plagued her during that period.

Without her husband and daughter's support, she might never have recovered. Since then, she avoided the internet entirely, switching to the most basic cellphone model.

"How's the fried breadstick?"

"Just as delicious as always." Evelyn sipped her soy milk hesitantly. "Just...a bit too hot."

"Take your time."

Victoria gazed out the window. Sunlight streamed through the glass onto the table but couldn't penetrate the shadows in her eyes.
###Chapter 124

On December 28th, the small town buzzed with festive energy.

Red lanterns adorned the plane trees lining the streets. Fresh holiday decorations graced every shop entrance. Upbeat seasonal tunes played on loop from supermarket speakers.

Victoria Langley took one look at the long queue outside their neighborhood grocery and immediately steered toward the downtown hypermarket.

The underground parking was nearly full. After circling for ages, mother and daughter finally found a spot. The elevator doors opened to reveal a bustling holiday shopping scene.

Two giant red "Fortune" signs flanked the entrance. Shelves overflowed with gift baskets. Shoppers pushed carts through crowded aisles, their faces alight with seasonal cheer.

"Mom, original or spiced sunflower seeds?" Evelyn Langley held up two packages.

"Get both. Your father prefers the spiced ones." Victoria added two nut gift sets to their cart.

Soon the cart brimmed with dried goods and fruit. In the snack aisle, Victoria deliberately selected several boxes of imported chocolates for holiday guests.

While browsing condiments, Victoria noticed their soy sauce was running low. She turned to consult Evelyn, only to find empty space behind her.

Retracing their steps past two aisles, she caught Evelyn sneaking premium ice cream bars into the cart.

"Mom!" Caught red-handed, Evelyn adopted a pitiful expression. "Just two? Please?"

Victoria crossed her arms. "What do you think?"

"Then...one?" Evelyn attempted negotiation.

A single ice cream bar remained in the cart.

"That's so unfair," Evelyn grumbled. "It's the holidays..."

"One. Final answer." Victoria remained firm.

"Victoria?"

An unfamiliar woman's voice interrupted. Both turned to see a middle-aged woman in a beige trench coat. Her sleek bob framed gold-rimmed glasses.

"Penelope, what a coincidence." Victoria offered a professional smile.

"I didn't expect to see you here." The editor approached, her gaze lingering on Evelyn. "And this is..."

"My daughter, Evelyn."

"My, how she's grown!" Penelope Ashcroft examined Evelyn with surprise. "Last time I saw her, she was just a little girl."

Evelyn nodded politely. She noticed the editor's habitual glasses adjustment and unique silver ring.

"About our phone conversation this morning—have you decided?" Penelope shifted topics abruptly.

Victoria's smile stiffened. The realization struck Evelyn—this was the editor who constantly called her mother about deadlines.
###Chapter 125

"Evelyn, go get some allspice." Victoria suddenly spoke, her gaze fixed on the spice rack in the distance.

Evelyn nodded obediently. She knew her mother was trying to send her away.

Once her daughter was out of earshot, Victoria took a deep breath. "I'm still considering it."

"You've been saying that for three months!" Penelope's voice rose sharply. "It's always 'considering.' How much longer do you need?"

Victoria gripped the shopping cart handle tightly. "I specialize in mystery novels. Switching to web fiction is too big a leap."

"It's all storytelling. What's the difference?" Penelope waved a dismissive hand.

"Web novels run for millions of words, and the genres are completely different." Victoria's voice trembled. "Haven't we learned from the failure of Unripe Fruit?"

At the mention of her ill-fated genre shift, Penelope's expression darkened. "That was bad timing. The web fiction market is stable now—"

"I'm not cut out for those CEO romance fluff pieces!" Victoria cut her off.

Penelope lowered her voice abruptly. "Ten years. You've only published one book, and it sold poorly. If this continues, what kind of writer are you?"

The vegetables in the cart crumpled under Victoria's grip. Her fingertips turned white. "I have new ideas—"

"Those garbage ideas?" Penelope scoffed. "Wake up. The 'Queen of Suspense' is outdated!"

"Mom!" Evelyn rushed out from behind the shelves, holding up the spice packet. "It's time to go home."

Victoria quickly wiped the corner of her eye and forced a smile. "Yes, let's go home."

Evelyn linked arms with her mother and shot Penelope a cold look. "Goodbye, Auntie."

She could feel Victoria's arm trembling slightly.
###Chapter 126

Penelope Ashcroft's lips curved slightly. "Fine, I'll browse around some more."

She turned to Victoria Langley. "Think about my proposal. We've worked together for so many years."

Victoria lowered her head without responding.

Evelyn Langley pushed the shopping cart away with her mother.

"Mom, did you sign a ten-year contract with Penelope?"

"Yes."

"This is the final year, right?"

Victoria counted on her fingers. "You're right."

"What do you think of her?"

Victoria hesitated. "...She's professionally competent."

Evelyn chuckled lightly. "Do you still have the contract?"

"Of course. Why?"

"Can I take a look tonight?"

Victoria looked puzzled. "What for?"

"Just curious. Is that not allowed?"

"Of course you can! You can see anything of mine!"

Evelyn grinned. "You're the best, Mom! By the way, can you send me all the novels you've written these years too?"

Victoria looked even more surprised. "They're just practice drafts. Nothing worth reading."

"Having a writer mom suddenly seems cool! If anyone asks, I can talk about it. Otherwise they'll think I'm bragging!"

As a child, Evelyn had always begged to read Victoria's famous works The Weapon and The Deserted School.

But Victoria always refused with excuses like "too violent," "not for children," or "wait until you're an adult."

By the time Evelyn actually turned eighteen, she'd lost interest.

It wasn't until her lonely married days that she finally opened her mother's books.

She had to admit—Victoria was a suspense genius!

The plots were intricately woven, the logic flawless, and the twists absolutely breathtaking.

No wonder these two books still topped bestseller lists.

Yet in the past decade, Victoria hadn't published any new suspense novels. Though curious, Evelyn had never pressed the matter.

Until today's encounter with that editor.

What publishing house editor wears full Chanel? Carries a rare leather Hermès?

What kind of publishing house had that kind of money?

And why had she never heard of it?
###Chapter 127

Evelyn Langley overheard the blatant exploitation and psychological manipulation in her mother's phone conversation with the editor.

"Please, just this once~"

"Fine, I'll send it tonight. But I doubt you'll make it through."

Evelyn's voice was firm. "I'll read every single word!"

......

At the front door, William Langley stood on a ladder, adjusting the holiday decorations. Squinting, he shifted the position while Evelyn directed him. "Dad, a little to the right."

"Higher," Victoria Langley interjected, having just parked the car. She scrutinized the placement. "No, too high. Lower it."

William obediently moved it down a few inches.

"Now it's too low," Victoria frowned.

Evelyn made the final call. "Perfect."

Climbing down, William studied the decorations with dissatisfaction. "Why does it look uneven?"

Victoria suddenly burst into laughter. "You mixed up the front door and living room decorations, didn’t you?"

William rubbed his nose sheepishly. "...Seems like it."

No wonder it looked off.

Victoria scoffed. "Did your brain take a vacation too?"

William: "..."

Evelyn couldn’t hold back her laughter.

......

New Year's Eve.

Victoria personally rolled out dough and made Evelyn’s favorite sauerkraut dumplings—thin wrappers stuffed generously, dipped in aged vinegar for a tangy bite.

William prepared a feast: braised fish, poached chicken, steamed pork with preserved vegetables, and crystal dumplings—symbolizing abundance and prosperity.

At 5 PM, the family gathered for the reunion dinner.

After the meal, Evelyn offered to wash dishes, but Victoria shooed her away. "Go watch the gala. We’ve got this."

William poked his head out from the kitchen, smoky from cooking. "If you’re bored, go light fireworks in the yard."

Evelyn insisted on clearing the table, then washed and sliced fruit into a platter, arranging nuts and snacks in a basket.

By 7 PM, sporadic firecrackers popped outside.

Evelyn pushed open the window. Fireworks bloomed across the night sky. Resting her chin on her hand, she savored the rare warmth of the moment.

Her phone buzzed.

A New Year’s greeting from Sophia Laurent. Smiling, Evelyn replied with a long, heartfelt message.

A video call instantly flashed on the screen.

Sophia, usually bold and flashy, looked refined with pearl hairpins holding back her curls—every inch the elegant lady.

Evelyn understood immediately. "Meeting the parents?"

But Sophia froze, staring at the background behind Evelyn. "You’re back home? I was going to ask you out for New Year’s."

In previous years, Evelyn had always spent New Year’s in the city with Nathan Evans.
###Chapter 128

Margaret Evans had always looked down on Evelyn Langley.

She considered the girl's modest background and average education unworthy of the Evans family.

Every encounter was met with Margaret's icy demeanor.

Even during holidays, she refused to let Evelyn step foot in their home.

At first, Evelyn would secretly cry over the rejection.

Eventually, she learned to accept it.

If the woman despised her, she'd simply keep her distance.

Nathan Evans remained passive in their feud.

He never mediated nor acknowledged their conflicts.

The two women's silent war continued unchecked.

Evelyn never burdened him with impossible choices.

She never asked whom he'd spend holidays with.

Now she realized—her sacrifices had been meaningless.

Men never appreciated such gestures.

They only took them for granted.

"Just missed my parents, so I booked a ticket home," Evelyn said lightly.

Sophia Laurent understood the courage this trip required.

"How are your parents? Send them my regards."

"They're well. They actually mentioned you at dinner."

The Langleys had known Sophia was Evelyn's closest friend since college.

Every holiday, they'd send hometown specialties through Evelyn.

"How long are you staying?" Sophia asked.

"A while. It's been too long."

Evelyn's voice carried rare lightness.

Sophia suddenly laughed.

"Wait till you hear this."

"What?"

"You haven't seen?" Sophia remembered her friend had blocked Nathan.

"Chloe Valentine posted Hermès gifts from Nathan, complete with hand-holding photos."

She scrolled her screen.

"Dylan Lowell commented that Nathan was just at Morning Star—how'd he get home so fast? The comment section is pure cringe."

"Pathetic. Bragging over a bag." Sophia scoffed.

"Remember when Nathan bought you anything you wanted—"

The real kicker came two minutes later.

Nathan's own post showed a bedside table with their Beihai photo behind a wineglass.

The caption read:

"Drunk. Miss her."

"Serves him right! Hope he drinks himself to death!" Sophia caught herself when Evelyn went silent.

"Enough gloom. It's the holidays."
###Chapter 129

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Don't worry about it."

The air froze for a brief moment.

Suddenly, noisy chatter erupted from the other end of the line. "Mianmian, the family dinner is starting. My mom's looking for me."

"Hmm."

After hanging up, her phone screen lit up again.

Ethan Winston had sent a series of documents.

International lawsuit filings, acceptance receipts, progress reports, and several unsigned forms.

Cross-border litigation was notoriously complex. The fact that it had progressed this quickly genuinely surprised Evelyn.

She downloaded the files, reviewed each page carefully, and signed her name.

The moment she sent them back, Ethan replied instantly:

"You trust me this much? Not afraid I'll screw you over?"

Her fingers tapped lightly: "You wouldn't."

Ethan chuckled at his screen.

He typed rapidly: "Relax, just necessary paperwork. Nothing beyond the lawsuit."

Evelyn scoffed.

Of course she'd scrutinized every document.

If Ethan wanted to scheme against her, he wouldn’t use such clumsy methods.

Her phone vibrated again:

"Happy New Year's Eve. May next year's wishes come true."

She flipped the phone facedown on her bed.

She wasn’t a wishing well.

"Mianmian, dumplings are ready—" Victoria called from downstairs.

"Coming." She hurried down.

8:00 PM sharp.

Steaming dumplings filled the air with their aroma. Evelyn curled up on the sofa, her parents on either side. A gentle-voiced host spoke from the TV as her mother occasionally fed her a cherry.

The countdown to midnight began.

Fireworks exploded outside, painting the night sky in vibrant colors.

In the yard, William Langley lit firecrackers.

Victoria covered her ears. "Be careful..."

The crackling pops ushered out the old year.

Evelyn watched her parents' silhouettes when her phone buzzed.

An unknown number. Area code showed Boston.

She answered.

"Happy New Year."

A warm voice filtered through the receiver.

Evelyn tilted her head toward the fireworks. "Happy New Year, Professor Klein."

......

Adrian Klein had deduced Evelyn's return to her hometown from Sophia Laurent's remarks.

After the family banquet ended, he retreated to his study to analyze lab data.

His fountain pen stilled mid-calculation.

He picked up his phone and dialed a familiar number.
###Chapter 130

This was the phone number they had exchanged during their first encounter.
He had never dialed those digits himself.

His heart skipped a beat when the call connected.
"Happy New Year—" The words tumbled out before he could stop them.

A soft response floated through the receiver.
Her voice carried the warmth of winter sunshine, laced with quiet amusement.

Adrian Klein could almost picture her holding the phone.
Fireworks burst behind her, illuminating her smiling profile.

......

Evelyn Langley slept till noon on New Year's Day.
Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled patterns on the floor.

She stretched and pulled open the drapes.
Snow-capped mountains glittered in the distance under the morning sun.

Her parents' laughter drifted from the courtyard.
William Langley sat reading with occasional sips of tea.

"Finally decided to wake up?" He glanced at his daughter. "Skipping meals will ruin your stomach."

Victoria Langley popped an orange segment into his mouth. "It's the holidays. Let her sleep."

Evelyn leaned against the windowsill, grinning.
The aroma of warm breakfast waiting on the table filled the room.

......

Basking in the sunlight, she sipped tea in the courtyard.
The brew swirled on her tongue with hints of jujube.

"Isn't this the aged white tea Daniel sent?" She inhaled the fragrance. "Such a unique flavor."

William arched an eyebrow. "I thought you hated tea."

"People change." She took another sip.
Memories surfaced of how she'd grown to love tea while persuading Nathan Evans to drink less.

Victoria caught the unspoken thought and shot her husband a look.
"The doctor said cut back on tea, yet here you are brewing it daily."

Evelyn was still smirking when her mother changed tactics: "Don't laze around. Go enjoy this beautiful day."

Before she could protest, she found herself ushered out the door.

At the alley's entrance, she hesitated.
Eventually choosing the less-traveled path.

Her footsteps led her unconsciously to Linshi No.2 High School.
Her father's workplace, and the campus where she'd spent three formative years.
###Chapter 131

The campus was unusually quiet during winter break, with only a few senior classes still holding make-up sessions.

Evelyn Langley stood at the school gate as the security guard squinted at her. "Here to visit your teachers during the holidays?"

Before she could answer, he waved her in. "Go ahead. The seniors are in class—just keep it down."

Pressing her lips together, Evelyn walked silently onto the grounds.

She didn’t head toward the academic buildings. Instead, she wandered slowly across the empty sports field. Pale winter sunlight dappled the running track with shifting shadows.

At the honor display case, a familiar face made her pause.

The girl in the photo beamed with radiant confidence. Below it read: Evelyn Langley, Linshi City Science Valedictorian, Admitted to Harvard University Biology Department.

A sudden gust of wind swirled dead leaves across the pavement as the sky darkened.

"Professor Langley—"

The familiar voice made Evelyn turn. Her father approached with a stack of test papers in his arms.

"Happy New Year, Professor Zhu." William Langley smiled at the female teacher walking toward him.

"Back at school so early? No family obligations?" Professor Zhu adjusted her glasses.

As William began to respond, she suddenly lowered her voice. "Your Evelyn still isn’t coming home for the holidays, is she?"

"Actually—"

"Between you and me," Zhu interrupted, "that girl changed after moving to the capital. Won’t even acknowledge her own parents now."

William’s smile froze.

"Top of her class, yet she insisted on chasing big-city dreams. And now? Rumor has it she’s..." Zhu trailed off meaningfully.

"Rumor has what?" William’s voice turned icy.

"Oh, you know what people say about girls who..." Zhu gave an awkward laugh. "Never mind."

"Professor Zhu." William spoke each word with deliberate precision. "My daughter’s reputation is spotless. I’d appreciate you not spreading gossip."

"I was only trying to—"

"We don’t need that kind of concern." William turned sharply and walked away, his stiff back radiating anger.

Zhu smirked. "Who’s he trying to fool? Everyone knows his daughter is some rich man’s—"

Her words died as she spotted Evelyn standing nearby. The professor’s face cycled through a series of horrified expressions.
###Chapter 132

A group of middle-aged women clustered around the bulletin board at the school entrance, whispering behind cupped hands.

"Look, it's that Langley girl again," a plump woman sneered, jabbing a finger at the display case. "Every faculty meeting, they bring her up—state valedictorian, Harvard prodigy."

"Exactly," a short-haired woman chimed in with a mocking lilt. "And now? Rumor has it she's some tycoon's mistress in the city!"

Evelyn Langley froze mid-step as the words hit her like a slap.

Her fingers tightened around her umbrella handle, knuckles bleaching white.

Academic excellence had always been her father's pride. At every parent-teacher conference, he'd stand tall at the podium, beaming as he shared parenting insights.

Now these vultures were soiling that pride with venomous lies.

She ducked behind the bulletin board, stomach churning at the thought of her father hearing such filth.

......

"Professor Langley, here are the practice exam answer keys." The department head handed over a folder. "Your daughter visiting recently?"

William Langley adjusted his glasses. "Yes, just arrived yesterday."

"How lovely." The man hesitated. "Though... perhaps ignore any idle chatter you hear."

William offered a thin smile and said nothing.

Outside the office, he exhaled heavily.

Near the gates, a familiar silhouette made his shoulders relax.

"Evelyn?"

"Dad." She jogged over, cheeks pink. "I was just passing by."

William eyed the gathering storm clouds. "Rain's coming. Hop on—I'll ride you home."

The bicycle creaked beneath them.

Evelyn wrapped her arms around her father's waist, breathing in the familiar chalk-dust scent of his sweater.

"Dad, I'm sorry..."

"Silly girl. For what?"

"For not visiting sooner."

Tires splashed through puddles, scattering diamond droplets.

"Having you home is enough." His voice blended with the patter of rain. "Your photo's still in the display case, you know."

"Really?"

"Of course! Remember your first Physics Olympiad? When I asked if you were nervous, what did you say?"

She pressed her cheek against his back. "I forget."

"'Zero apprehension,'" William boomed with laughter. "Your homeroom teacher nearly had a stroke!"

The drizzle sharpened into stinging pellets.

By homecoming, William's shirt clung to his skin.

As Evelyn reached for a towel, a shrill voice sliced through the courtyard.

"William! Is that really your Evelyn? The one they say is kept by some city millionaire?"

The towel crumpled in Evelyn's grip.

She strode outside, flashing their nosy neighbor a saccharine smile.

"Aunt Brenda," she chirped, voice dripping honey, "did you gargle sewage this morning?"
###Chapter 133

"Oh my! Isn't that Evelyn? I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I saw you in the hallway earlier!"

Brenda Murphy's booming voice echoed through the corridor. She was their next-door neighbor, notorious for being the neighborhood gossip. Her husband taught at the same high school as William Langley, and the two families had lived across from each other for over a decade.

Spotting Evelyn, Brenda scurried over in three quick strides, her eyes scanning Evelyn up and down like searchlights. "My, my! Look at you! The city life sure agrees with you. Our little girl has grown up so well!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

"Just look at this outfit, this poise, this bag..." Brenda clicked her tongue dramatically before lowering her voice. "Evelyn, I heard you've met quite a few wealthy businessmen in the city. Could you introduce my second daughter to one?"

"What kind of introduction?" Evelyn frowned.

"You know, the rich ones! My girl has the looks, the figure—she's only twenty-two..."

Evelyn's expression turned icy as she took a step back. "Aunt Brenda, I work a legitimate job in the city. I don't have those kinds of connections."

Brenda's smile stiffened. "We're neighbors! Can't you do this small favor? Now that you've made it big, shouldn't you help others too?"

"Who am I to help anyone?" Evelyn scoffed.

Seeing her resistance, Brenda's face twisted instantly. "Oh, don't act so high and mighty! Everyone knows what you've been up to out there—"

"Brenda Murphy!" William Langley slammed his bicycle down and shielded his daughter behind him. His face was livid. "You can eat whatever nonsense you want, but don't you dare spew it from your mouth! My Evelyn is pure and blameless. The only filth here is what's coming out of yours!"

"Me? Spewing filth?" Brenda shrieked. "The whole building knows what your daughter—"

"Shut your mouth!" William trembled with rage.

"Dad!" Evelyn quickly steadied him, fishing his blood pressure medication from her bag.

When she looked up again, her gaze was sharp as a blade. "I called you 'Aunt' out of respect. But if you don't want it, don't blame me for what comes next!"

With that, she grabbed the wet mop leaning against the wall and swung it at Brenda with full force.

"Ah—she's hitting me!" Brenda screeched, dodging but still getting splashed with dirty water.

"Sorry, I just finished mopping the bathroom," Evelyn said coldly.

Brenda turned pale, as if she could actually smell the stench. "You little bitch! Just you wait!"

"Wait for you to come back for another beating?" Evelyn raised the mop again.

Brenda fled like a rat, but not without a final shout from the stairwell. "That damn wisteria vine of yours is creeping into my yard! I'm chopping it all down tomorrow and burning it!"

"Try it!" Evelyn brandished the mop and chased after her.

Only when Brenda's figure vanished down the stairs did Evelyn finally exhale. But when she turned back, her father's grave expression sent a chill through her heart.
###Chapter 134

Evelyn's fingers twisted together. After a long pause, she finally murmured, "Dad, I..."

"When did you learn to fight like that?" William suddenly mimicked her mop-swinging motion from earlier.

Evelyn was momentarily speechless.

"Ahem!" William put on a stern face. "Young ladies should be more refined."

"Dad," Evelyn looped her arm through his, "just tell me—did it feel satisfying or not?"

William's mouth twitched. "...Satisfying."

"Was it her who tore down our wisteria vine by the fence?"

There had been an empty plot between their houses that Brenda had arbitrarily claimed for vegetable gardening. The Langley's wisteria had barely crept over the wall when she yanked it out by the roots.

William was mild-tempered, and Victoria disliked confrontation. Over the years, Brenda had come to believe the land rightfully belonged to her.

"She said it was blocking sunlight from her vegetables." William sighed. "Your mother couldn't sleep for days afterward."

Evelyn bit her lower lip. She hadn't realized how much her parents had silently endured all these years.

"Dad, what they said about me..."

"Don't listen!" William's voice suddenly rose. "Nobody knows my daughter better than I do!"

Evelyn's eyes grew warm.

"Don't mention this to your mother. She takes things to heart."

"Okay."

...

On the second day of the New Year, Victoria dragged Evelyn out of bed at dawn.

"Hurry up and get ready. Wear something nice—we're visiting your uncle Richard's."

Among the four Langley siblings, William was the third eldest. Richard had built his fortune in construction materials and was now a prominent local businessman.

In previous years, only William and Victoria paid the New Year's visit. This time, Evelyn joined them.

"Happy New Year, Aunt Elizabeth."

Elizabeth stared at the graceful young woman at the doorway. "Is that... Evelyn?"

Victoria handed over a gift with a smile. "Happy New Year, sister-in-law."

"You shouldn't have brought anything!" Elizabeth accepted the present. "We've been waiting—come in!"

A shrill voice carried from the living room. "Oh my, Evelyn? After all these years of absence, what brings you back this time?"
###Chapter 135

Patricia Lorenz stood in the center of the living room, clad in a neon green sweater with an exaggerated perm that made her resemble a walking Christmas tree.

"My goodness, is that Evelyn?" she exclaimed dramatically, clapping her hands. "I barely recognize you after all these years!"

Charles Lorenz frowned and tugged at his wife's sleeve. Dressed in a beige turtleneck with slicked-back hair, he looked much younger than his age.

"Keep it down," he warned in a low voice.

Patricia pursed her lips. "Can't I be happy? William and Victoria have missed Evelyn terribly since she left for Harvard."

She enthusiastically grabbed Evelyn's hands, examining her from head to toe. Evelyn wore a soft apricot sweater with a brown maxi skirt, a butterfly hair clip completing her gentle, elegant look.

"Just look at this poise! Only someone who's lived in the capital could carry themselves like this," Patricia marveled.

Tiffany Lorenz rolled her eyes from the couch. Her tight crop top and JK skirt paired with heavy eyeliner screamed teenage rebellion.

"Mom, must you be so loud?" She shook her phone impatiently.

Patricia immediately glared. "Look at your cousin, then look at you! Always glued to that phone!"

William Langley glanced around. "Where's Richard?"

Elizabeth Melville poked her head out from the kitchen. "On a client call in the study. Even during the holidays, he can't catch a break."

The grandmother instantly declared, "We'll wait to eat until Richard finishes."

The grandfather nodded in agreement. "Yes, we'll wait for him."

Elizabeth looked uneasy. "But—"

"It's settled!" The grandmother's tone brooked no argument.

Victoria silently retreated to a corner seat. Rescued from a river by William as an orphan with no family, she'd never been accepted by her in-laws.

Evelyn sat beside her mother, making no effort to charm her grandparents. In this household, she and her mother would always remain outsiders.
###Chapter 136

The dinner was unusually quiet. Evelyn Langley just wanted it to end quickly.

"Evelyn, your bag..." Elizabeth Melville set down the fruit platter, her gaze lingering on Evelyn's handbag. "It looks quite exquisite. Is it designer?"

The table fell silent.

Patricia Lorenz spoke first. "I've seen that bag before. The wealthy socialites on TV all carry it. What's it called... Hermès?"

"Mom!" Tiffany Lorenz rolled her eyes. "That's the Hermès Picnic bag."

"Oh my!" Patricia dramatically covered her mouth. "The one that costs hundreds of thousands?"

Evelyn sighed inwardly. She'd saved up to buy this entry-level bag herself, never expecting it to be recognized.

"Just a knockoff from a street vendor," she said lightly. "Only a few hundred bucks."

Patricia smirked. "Not even a good replica. Just a fake."

"Yeah," Evelyn nodded. "I just liked how it looked."

Tiffany gave her a knowing glance.

Elizabeth smoothly changed the subject. "Everyone, try these cherries."

Patricia immediately chimed in. "You must've bought the premium 4J grade, right?"

"I wouldn't know," Elizabeth smiled. "I just picked the most expensive ones. Daniel and his father love them."

"Isn't Daniel coming home for New Year's?" Patricia feigned surprise.

Elizabeth couldn't hide her pride. "He's starting his business in Kyoto. The company's just getting off the ground—too busy to leave."

"My, Daniel's so accomplished," Patricia said sourly. "No wonder Grandma and Grandpa dote on their eldest grandson."

Evelyn quietly ate her fruit. The Langleys' favoritism toward sons wasn't new. As the only grandson, Daniel had been the golden child since birth.

The more Patricia thought about it, the more resentful she grew. She glanced at Evelyn, then at her own daughter, finally feeling somewhat mollified.

At least Tiffany had a job at the power bureau and could marry well someday...

Still better than unemployed Evelyn.
###Chapter 137

Patricia Lorenz's peripheral vision caught the cherries William Langley had brought. Her lips curled slightly.

"Victoria dear, you bought cherries too? They look a size smaller than Elizabeth's."

Victoria's smile froze. Her voice remained gentle.

"You're teasing me, Patricia. How could we compare with Elizabeth?"

Patricia covered her mouth with a titter.

"Naturally. Richard and Elizabeth always get the best."

Evelyn Langley idly rearranged the fruit platter.

"What did you bring, Aunt Patricia?"

Patricia's expression stiffened.

Evelyn had already bent to inspect the shopping bag at her feet.

"Let's see... Apples, pears, oranges..."

All budget fruits.

"How practical. Exactly what everyone enjoys daily."

The barb stung, but Patricia couldn't object.

"I thought to bring something economical..."

Born to affluent parents who were power bureau officials, Patricia had never known want. Yet she pinched pennies relentlessly, especially with family.

Evelyn smiled.

"You're so thrifty, Aunt Patricia."

Patricia's mouth tightened.

Elizabeth Melville intervened smoothly.

"Enough chatter. Try the fruit."

"Thank you, Aunt Elizabeth." Evelyn selected a cherry. "Delicious."

Patricia chewed mechanically. The fruit might as well have been sawdust.

She sought comfort from her husband.

Charles Lorenz didn't even glance her way.

"Mom, eat!" Tiffany Lorenz urged. "They'll be gone soon."

Patricia scowled.

"Eat, eat! You two are nothing but leeches!"

Tiffany blinked. What's her problem?
Charles frowned. Needs her meds.

The clock struck noon. The housekeeper asked about serving lunch for the third time. Elizabeth looked upstairs.

"Let's wait. Richard's still working."

Grandmother Margaret Roland agreed.

"We eat together for New Year's."

An hour later, Elizabeth grew restless.

"Shall we start? It is the holiday..."

"I'm not hungry," Margaret said, glancing at Grandfather George Roland.

"Nor I."

Margaret surveyed the room.

"Anyone hungry?"

Silence.

"Then we wait," Margaret decreed.

"Waiting for me?"

A crisp female voice carried from the foyer. The newcomer shed her down coat, revealing a tailored suit and impeccable chignon.

"Grace?!" Margaret rose in delight. "You said you were working!"

Grace Deross, a bank branch manager, had claimed she'd be on duty.

"My assistant's covering." She greeted everyone while changing shoes, pausing at Evelyn.

"Evelyn's back?"

"Aunt Grace." Evelyn smiled.

"You've grown." Grace's gaze lingered on Evelyn's face, then dropped to her handbag. Her brow furrowed.

"Come have fruit," Elizabeth offered warmly.

Grace presented a gift box with a smile.

"Happy New Year, Elizabeth. For all your hard work."

Elizabeth looked startled.

"For me?"
###Chapter 138

"Of course."

"Grace, you're too kind." Elizabeth took the gift box and casually placed it on the coffee table.

Grace Deross's lips curved slightly. "It's a solid gold bracelet. If you don't like the design, you can always exchange it at Golden Thread Pavilion."

Patricia's eyes lit up. "My, Grace is so generous—giving solid gold right away..."

"Don't tease me, Patricia," Grace smoothed her hair. "Elizabeth has seen all the finest things. This is just a small token."

"Why only prepare something for Elizabeth?" Patricia said with a half-joking smile. "As a bank president dealing with high-profile clients daily, you should understand basic social etiquette."

Grace arched an eyebrow. "Do you want one too?"

Patricia's smile didn't waver. "Who wouldn't want a gold bracelet? Don't you agree, Victoria?"

Their gazes simultaneously turned to Victoria.

Victoria pressed her lips together.

"Why so quiet?"

William Langley intervened smoothly. "She doesn't wear much jewelry. The pieces I've given her are all stored away."

Patricia internally scoffed—country folk had no taste, not even appreciating gold.

"If Victoria doesn't want it, I'll take it!" Patricia said shamelessly. "Grace, you can't play favorites."

Grace raised an eyebrow. "Fine. Just host a dinner party sometime—I'm sure you'll get your return gift."

Patricia's expression froze.

Her small apartment couldn't accommodate so many people.

"If your place is too small, book a few tables at a hotel," Grace said, voicing her unspoken concern.

Patricia: "..."

At least three tables would be needed at a high-end hotel.

A single gold bracelet wouldn't even cover the cost.

"Oh, I was just joking," Patricia forced a laugh. "Grace took me seriously."

Grace snorted.

"It's already two o'clock—aren't we eating?" Patricia changed the subject.

The atmosphere grew even more tense.

The matriarch's face darkened. "Did you skip breakfast? Are you that hungry?"

Patricia was rendered speechless.

Evelyn watched coldly, glancing at the clock. Making everyone wait this late either meant genuine busyness or deliberate posturing...

Footsteps suddenly sounded from the second floor.

"Why hasn't dinner started?"

Richard Melville descended the stairs in a polo shirt and casual pants. Though his figure had filled out, his handsome features remained.

Patricia rolled her eyes discreetly: Who dared start without you?

Elizabeth hurried over. "We wanted to begin earlier, but everyone insisted on waiting for you—"

"Wait for me?" Richard frowned. "Let our parents go hungry?"

"I..." Elizabeth floundered.

The matriarch immediately came to her defense. "We chose to wait. Isn't family reunion the point of holidays?"

Grace chimed in: "Don't blame Elizabeth, Richard. Eating later won't hurt anyone."

Richard's expression softened slightly. "Let's eat then."

At the dining table, Patricia's gaze shifted. "Evelyn, didn't your boyfriend come home with you for the holidays?"
###Chapter 139

Evelyn Langley's past remained a taboo subject in the Langley household. Years ago, William Langley and Victoria Langley had rushed to the capital overnight, only to return tight-lipped about their daughter's affairs.

Whispers swirled through social circles—claims that Evelyn had abandoned her studies for some wealthy heir. Some said the boy came from old money, no wonder she'd dropped out to chase that golden ticket.

William's brow furrowed. Victoria clenched her napkin.

"We broke up ages ago." Evelyn's tone was calm, as if discussing the weather.

Patricia Lorenz clicked her tongue. "Those old-money families don't marry just anyone. He was probably toying with you." Her eyes gleamed. "A girl's reputation matters. All those wasted years... surely you got some compensation?"

Visions of million-dollar breakup settlements from soap operas danced in her head. The more she thought, the more bitter she grew—why should her niece have landed such a catch?

"What compensation would you suggest, Aunt Patricia?" Evelyn's gaze turned razor-sharp.

"Money. Property..."

"Enough!" William slammed the table. "Patricia, know your place!"

She bristled. "I'm showing concern!"

Victoria grasped her daughter's icy hand. "Slander carries legal consequences, Patricia."

The usually meek Victoria's counterattack stunned Patricia. She kicked her husband under the table. "Cat got your tongue?"

Charles Lorenz kept shoveling food into his mouth. Tiffany Lorenz pretended to scroll through her phone.

Grandmother Margaret threw down her chopsticks. "Must we ruin the holidays? Patricia's blunt, but she's right. Those capital playboys think they can discard our girls without repercussions?"

"Mother!" William's eyes reddened. "Evelyn is your granddaughter!"

Victoria took a steadying breath. "We're done here." She pulled Evelyn up. "William, we're leaving."

Margaret hurled a teacup to the floor. "Outrageous! Sons forget their mothers once they take wives!"

She pointed at Victoria's retreating back. "That vixen and her little harlot can stay gone!"

The shattering porcelain echoed through the dining room. William didn't look back as he slammed the door behind them.
###Chapter 140

William Langley remained silent throughout the journey home.

Victoria Langley quietly grasped his hand.

He forced a faint smile, signaling he was fine.

Over the years, he'd grown accustomed to his mother's favoritism. Such unpleasant partings were nothing new.

But when it came to Evelyn, even his gentle temper couldn't tolerate those venomous slanders.

As they stepped inside, Victoria moved toward the kitchen, only to be stopped by Evelyn.

"Mom, I'll cook today."

"You?"

Victoria and William exchanged glances, mutual astonishment reflected in their eyes.

The Evelyn they knew had always avoided even stepping into the kitchen.

"Let me show you what I can do."

"Try not to blow up the kitchen," William teased.

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Do you really think that little of me?"

In perfect unison, her parents nodded.

Evelyn: "..."

One hour later—

The dining table was laden with dishes boasting vibrant colors and tantalizing aromas.

Stir-fried kidney glistened with oil, tomato beef stew emitted mouthwatering fragrance, and shredded pork with garlic sauce tempted the eyes.

Victoria swallowed hard. "You made all this?"

Evelyn lifted her chin proudly.

William took a bite, his eyes instantly brightening. "This is amazing!"

Still skeptical, Victoria picked up a spare rib.

"Hiss—" She inhaled sharply. "When did you learn to cook like this?"

"Didn't spend those years away for nothing." Evelyn urged, "Eat before it gets cold."

After dinner, Evelyn pressed her parents onto the sofa and cleared the table herself.

Before reaching the living room, she overheard William's choked voice: "Vicky... our girl must've suffered terribly these years."

"Seeing how skilled she's become in the kitchen..." Victoria's voice carried equal heartache.

Evelyn's eyes burned.

Outside, the snowstorm raged through the night.

But inside, warmth blossomed like spring.

At dawn, William warned, "The balcony door broke in last night's storm. Stay away from it these days."

The aging faculty housing seemed especially fragile against the winter onslaught.

Evelyn glanced around, truly noticing how the decor remained frozen in her childhood—yellowed wallpaper, outdated furniture.

Suddenly, raised voices erupted outside.

"What gives you the right to accuse me? Because you're some failed writer?"

Evelyn and William rushed out to find Victoria trembling with rage, while Brenda Murphy smirked triumphantly.
###Chapter 141

"Who else could have done this besides you?" Victoria's fingers trembled with rage.

She was always gentle and polite, never one to argue.

The word "barbaric" was the harshest insult she'd ever uttered.

Brenda crossed her arms and sneered. "You call this barbaric? You haven't seen anything yet!"

"You admit it?" Victoria's eyes widened in disbelief.

Brenda's gaze shifted evasively. "Admit what? Where's your proof?"

"Even if I did it, what can you do? Property damage only becomes a case above five thousand. Did you think I didn't know that?"

Victoria's chest heaved violently.

William immediately stepped forward to shield his wife. "Mrs. Murphy, what did our wisteria ever do to you? Was this really necessary between neighbors?"

Evelyn surveyed the scene.

The once-lush wisteria lay in ruins. The trellis near the wall had been snapped in half, dangling precariously.

The entire yard looked like a war zone.

"Of course it bothered me!" Brenda grew bolder with William's intervention. "It blocked sunlight from my vegetable patch and attracted bugs!"

She pointed at the broken wooden frame. "Those sharp edges faced my window—bad feng shui!"

William laughed bitterly. "You can't plant vegetables in public areas. You complain about bugs? Your garden breeds mosquitoes!"

"The trellis was inside our property line. What about Professor Hao's trellis facing your place? Why didn't you tear his down?"

At the mention of Professor Hao, Brenda visibly shrank back.

Her cowardly bullying nature was laid bare.

Brenda curled her lip. "I just don't like you people! Acting all refined—if you're so fancy, go buy a villa!"

"Poor trash trying to play gardener, pah!"

William was rendered speechless.

Victoria couldn't get a word in edgewise.

Evelyn silently walked to the corner.

She picked up the damp mop, freshly used yesterday.

"Aunt Brenda, seems yesterday's lesson wasn't memorable enough."

Before the words fully left her mouth, the mop swung out.

"Ah—!" Brenda shrieked, stumbling backward before landing flat on her back.

Victoria burst out laughing.

William smoothly added, "You okay, Mrs. Murphy? Self-inflicted falls aren't actionable, you know."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips.

When intellectuals roasted someone, every syllable drew blood.

"Oh," William added, "this mop just cleaned the toilet. Haven't rinsed it yet."

Brenda's face turned ashen.

"Dad," Evelyn feigned surprise, "we poured yesterday's leftovers down the toilet. Even though we flushed..."

"Aunt Brenda, is that... garbage water I smell on you?"
###Chapter 142

Father and daughter's synchronized verbal attack struck like daggers. Brenda Murphy's smug expression twisted instantly.

"You—" She instinctively sniffed her sleeve, as if actually detecting the sour odor Evelyn had mentioned.

"Mark my words!"

She fled in humiliation.

A shower was urgently needed.

Evelyn gripped the mop, feeling like a triumphant warrior.

Victoria sighed with mixed satisfaction. "A young lady shouldn't threaten people with cleaning tools."

"She started it." Evelyn crouched to gather the scattered wisteria blossoms tenderly.

William had already begun quietly tidying up. "When the weather clears, I'll move the trellis to the yard."

He avoided conflict.

And refused to let his family suffer.

Evelyn spoke suddenly. "Dad, tolerance only emboldens bullies."

Today Brenda destroyed their flowers. Tomorrow she'd escalate.

William sighed. "After decades as neighbors, I know her nature. But we must maintain civility."

Victoria agreed. "Let it go. She's not worth it."

"Then..." Evelyn blinked. "What if we moved?"

Her parents exchanged amused glances, dismissing it as childish fantasy.

Move?

Impossible!

No.2 High School occupied prime downtown real estate with astronomical housing prices. Their savings could barely afford a suburban studio.

William's daily walk to school was perfectly convenient.

......

The fourth day of the new year dawned clear after snowfall.

Evelyn rose before sunrise.

When her parents awoke, steaming breakfast awaited them.

Fragrant yam porridge. Golden-brown pan-fried buns. Sandwiches with tender corn kernels.

"Delicious!" William's eyes lit up. "Almost as good as my cooking!"

Victoria sniffed. "Our daughter surpasses you."

"Only thanks to my superior genes." He puffed with pride.

Victoria ignored him.

After breakfast, Evelyn suggested a family stroll.

Basking in winter sunlight, they ambled along the riverbank.

Evelyn subtly guided them around a bend.

Before they realized, they stood before a gleaming new real estate sales office.
###Chapter 143

William Langley looked surprised. "What brings us here?"

Evelyn Langley was about to answer when a sales consultant from the property office eagerly approached. "Are you here to view properties? We offer a full range of layouts, from starter homes to premium upgrades."

"Just browsing," Evelyn replied coolly.

She gestured toward the scale model. "This is our master plan for Phase Three. The development is fully equipped with shopping centers, schools, and hospitals—everything for convenient living."

Evelyn's gaze swept over the model. "The spacing between buildings seems a bit tight."

"It's common for high-rises. To maximize density, the spacing is designed to be efficient."

"I heard you also have a villa section?"

The Lakeside Pearl project featured two product lines: standard high-rise apartments and standalone villas. The villas adopted a contemporary design with two-story structures, front courtyards, and private backyards. Unlike sprawling traditional estates, these compact villas catered to modern families, making them highly sought-after in the area.

Evelyn had done her research. "I'd like to see the Lakeside Villas."

William adored gardening—their home needed a proper garden. Victoria preferred writing outdoors and required a quiet backyard, ideally with a gazebo.

The consultant gave her a second glance. The young woman wore no makeup yet radiated effortless beauty. Her simple outfit and lack of accessories made her purchasing power hard to gauge, but her striking features suggested she wasn’t ordinary.

"Evelyn!" William quickly pulled his daughter aside. "The model is enough. No need to tour the villas and waste their time."

"Dad, what do you think of this development?"

"The location is excellent. Several colleagues bought units here."

It was steps away from Linshi No.2 High School, just across the street. But the prices were staggering—fully furnished in a prime location, the cost per square foot doubled neighboring complexes.

"How about we buy one?" Evelyn dropped the bombshell.

William nearly choked. "Don’t joke around. What if the consultant takes you seriously?"

Victoria agreed. "They’re working through the holidays. Let’s not waste their time."

"Exactly, let’s go..."

Though they whispered, the consultant heard every word. Her smile instantly faded. So they were just window-shoppers! The middle-aged couple clearly lived frugally—what could they possibly afford? Villas? Please.
###Chapter 144

Evelyn patted her parents' hands reassuringly before striding toward the property model.

"I'd like to see the villas," she stated directly.

The saleswoman flashed a practiced smile. "I'm sorry, villas are only available to VIP clients."

"What are the requirements?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"First, you must qualify for property purchase in the adjacent city." The saleswoman counted on her fingers. "Second, liquid assets exceeding two million, or possession of a black card from any top-tier bank."

As Evelyn considered which card to present, William grabbed her arm to pull her away.

"This is getting ridiculous!" he hissed. "Two million? Do you think we own a bank?"

Victoria muttered behind them, "I wouldn't even write this plot in my novels. Since when did you become so bold?"

She then apologized to the saleswoman with an embarrassed smile. "Our daughter's being childish. Sorry for the trouble."

The saleswoman's expression instantly soured, rolling her eyes dramatically.

"Stop pretending to be rich if you can't afford it. What a waste of my time!"

Victoria stiffened while William's face darkened.

"We may have overstepped, but that's unnecessarily rude."

"Rude?" The saleswoman scoffed. "Don't waste my time if you're broke! Villas? You probably can't even afford a bathroom here!"

Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "How do you know we can't?"

"Please," the woman sneered, crossing her arms. "I see penniless posers like you every day."

Ignoring her, Evelyn spotted a young ponytailed girl carrying a tea tray in the corner.

"Are you a sales agent here?" Evelyn approached her.

The girl nodded timidly. "Yes, how may I assist you?"

"Show us the villas." Evelyn produced a black card from her pocket. "Does this qualify?"

The girl's eyes widened. "Absolutely! Please follow me—"

"Hold it!" The first saleswoman rushed over, shrieking, "How do we know that card's real?"
###Chapter 145

"Ms. Casstevensa..." Emily, the new sales associate, stood frozen in place.

"What are you waiting for? Did you memorize the capital verification process? If some riffraff gets in, can you handle the responsibility?"

"I... I learned the procedure during training. If the verification passes and this lady's card checks out, then I'm not at fault..."

"Tch. Just arrived and already learned to shift blame." Vanessa sneered. "In our line of work, discernment is everything. You must know who's a real client and who's just putting on airs. Wasting time is wasting life."

Emily bit her lower lip. "Thank you for the reminder. But I'm still learning and need more client interactions to gain experience."

She turned to Evelyn. "Per procedure, we'll need to verify your funds first. If everything checks out, we can proceed with the property viewing."

Then she addressed William and Victoria. "Sir and madam, you may wait in the lounge area. This won't take long."

William waved his hands hastily. "No need, no need."

His palms were drenched in sweat.

His daughter was playing with fire!

What would they do when the verification failed? Where would they hide their faces?

Victoria appeared composed as she sat sipping tea, but the cup trembled violently in her hands.

"Please follow me." Emily guided Evelyn toward the finance office.

"Such a performance!" Vanessa scoffed. "They won't admit defeat until they see the coffin..."

Ten minutes later.

The two emerged from the finance office.

"Was the card fake?" Vanessa remained posted at the door, wearing a mocking grin.

No one acknowledged her.

"Are you absolutely certain you don't want to reconsider?" Emily asked nervously.

"No need."

"Perhaps I could show you the actual unit? Just seeing the model might not—"

"The model is sufficient."

Good heavens! A multi-million-dollar property decided just like that?

"Quite the convincing act." Vanessa remarked sarcastically. "Consider this your first lesson, Emily. Open your eyes wider next time!"

"Ms. Casstevensa, you've misunderstood—"

"Misunderstood what? Don't tell me that black card was real?" She shot Evelyn a derisive glance.

"It is! The verification cleared!"

"Pfft—have you been brainwashed?" Vanessa burst into shrill laughter.

Emily: "..."

"You're certain you don't want to see more?" Emily double-checked.

"Just prepare the contract."

Though this development's prices were slightly higher, the location was prime and the luxury finishes impeccable.

Compared to Boston's housing market, it felt practically like a steal.

Moreover, Evelyn had done thorough research beforehand—she knew every detail about the unit layouts and orientations.

No further viewing was necessary.
###Chapter 146

Emily's fingers trembled slightly, her eyes shining brightly. "Then... how would you like to pay?"

"Full payment. One lump sum."

"!"

William Langley's eyes widened. He hadn't expected his daughter to actually buy a villa—and in cash!

He opened his mouth to speak, but a sharp pain suddenly shot through his waist—Victoria had pinched him hard.

"Our daughter knows what she's doing. Don't interfere."

William swallowed his words.

Emily nervously took the black card, fumbling with the contract documents, her voice shaking.

"Miss Langley, are you sure about this purchase? If everything looks good, I'll proceed with the payment now."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Go ahead."

Emily mechanically completed the process. Only after seeing the signed contract and hearing the confirmation of the $5 million transfer did it finally feel real.

Oh my God!

She'd just sold the crown jewel of the villa district!

A $5 million cash deal!

Emily's lips curled into an uncontrollable smile, though she forced it down when she caught Vanessa's ashen expression. But the joy in her eyes was unmistakable.

A commission in the hundreds of thousands—enough to keep her smiling for a year!

Vanessa, who had been so haughty earlier, now looked pale, her lips trembling. "Emily, you just—"

"Vanessa, I was about to tell you. Miss Langley does indeed hold a black card and has already selected the premium villa in the VIP lounge."

"She actually bought it?"

"The contract is signed. How could it be fake?"

Evelyn ignored the drama, linking arms with her parents. "Mom, Dad, let's go home and pack?"

William was still stunned. "P-pack what?"

"The new place comes furnished, but you'll need your clothes and daily essentials, right?"

William nodded robotically. "Right, right..."

Wait—since when did they have a new home?

Even in the taxi, William felt like he was dreaming.

Back at their house, he sat on the couch for a long moment before finally managing to speak.

"Evelyn... you really bought a house?"

Evelyn nodded.

"A villa?"

Another nod.

"In cash?"

Another nod.

William fell silent for a full ten seconds. "Something this big, and you didn't discuss it with us?"

"We've lived in this old place for so long. It's time for an upgrade." Evelyn softened her voice. "I wanted to surprise you."

William frowned. "How much... was it?"

Evelyn held up five fingers.

William knew it was $5 million, not $500,000.

Even with some preparation, the number still made his heart race.

"Where did you get that kind of money? It couldn't be..."
###Chapter 147

Five million dollars.

The staggering amount made William Langley's vision darken. After thirty years of teaching, his bank account had never held more than five figures.

Evelyn twisted her fingers. "I've saved some money over the years."

Victoria looked up sharply. "How?"

Evelyn knew she couldn't hide it. The neighborhood gossip must have reached her mother's ears.

"Every penny was earned honestly."

It was the truth.

When Nathan Evans had chosen her over his family, his furious father Vincent Evans had frozen all his assets.

At their lowest point, they'd squeezed into a damp basement. When Nathan decided to start his own business, she began saving aggressively.

By chance, she landed a product testing job at a biotech firm. One day, inspiration struck—she wrote a data analysis program.

The company offered $500,000 to buy it. Nathan negotiated the deal up to $2 million.

That money became Nathan's seed funding. Two years later, his company went public.

On IPO day, he handed her a check. "Half of this is yours."

Five million in cash, plus a prime piece of real estate.

She'd laughed it off then. "What would I do with all that?"

"Be my little sugar mama." He'd stuffed the documents into a drawer. "I never take back what I give."

Later, when their fights became constant, she never touched that money. Not until she decided to leave.

Now it struck her—if Nathan had truly wanted to marry her, he would have given company shares, not easily severable cash.

She took the money with a clear conscience. She just preferred her parents not know this history.

Victoria sensed her daughter's evasion but accepted the assurance about the money's origins.

"So we're really moving into a villa?" Victoria's eyes sparkled.

Evelyn nodded. "Tonight. It's fully furnished—just pack clothes."

"Koi pond in front, flower garden in back."

William rubbed his hands excitedly. "How big?"

"As many flowers as you want. You can order seeds now."

"Placing the order!" William pulled out his phone. "Wisteria trellis first, then hydrangeas. When they bloom, that'll show old Sherman!"

Sherman was his colleague and fellow gardening enthusiast who'd been bragging about his balcony garden since moving to a condo.
###Chapter 148

The small courtyard attached to the first floor wasn't spacious, but William Langley had transformed it into a miniature garden. Potted plants were arranged in perfect harmony, each one blooming vibrantly despite the limited space.

"I wish we could grow hydrangeas here..." William sighed as he gazed at the yard.

Seeing his disappointment, Evelyn Langley picked up her phone and browsed gardening websites. Her finger suddenly paused. "Dad, what are we doing with this place after moving to the new house?"

"Sell it," William calculated. "This location is prime real estate."

"Keep it," Evelyn said firmly.

William looked puzzled. "Why?"

"Wait for the right moment." A mysterious smile played on Evelyn's lips.

She remembered the development contract she'd accidentally seen in Nathan Evans' study. The planning map for the neighboring city's shopping district clearly included the Faculty Housing where they lived now. This secret, she had to keep to herself.

"The sales office notified us to complete paperwork tomorrow," Evelyn changed the subject.

William's eyes lit up. "Should I move some plants over first?"

"Of course. We already have the villa keys." Evelyn smiled.

The next morning, the Langley family rose early.

William busied himself packing potted plants while Victoria Langley organized their clothes. A three-wheeled vehicle waited downstairs, its cargo space filled with flowerpots.

"I'll go arrange these at the new place first," William squeezed into the driver's seat. "Wait for me after you finish the paperwork."

At the sales office, Emily Fairsprene greeted them warmly. "Miss Langley, this way please!"

The formalities proceeded smoothly. As they exited the VIP room, a familiar voice called out.

"Sister-in-law? Evelyn?"

Victoria turned to see Charles Lorenz in a tailored suit.

"Second brother? What are you—"

"We've been looking everywhere for you!" Patricia Lorenz's voice suddenly cut in, then froze when she saw Victoria.
###Chapter 149

Patricia Lorenz approached in her stilettos, gracefully linking arms with Charles Lorenz. "What a coincidence, Victoria. Fancy running into you here."

Victoria Langley gave a slight nod. "Hello, Patricia."

"What brings you to the sales office? Don't tell me you're house hunting?" Patricia widened her eyes in exaggerated surprise.

"No," Victoria replied softly. They'd already purchased a property yesterday.

"Is that so..." Patricia studied her with a knowing look, her smile widening. "We're here for Lakeside Pearl—the hottest luxury development right now! The high-rise units are selling like hotcakes. Everyone's scrambling to get one."

"Luckily Tiffany knows the sales manager here, so they reserved a unit for us."

"We just signed the contract."

Patricia spoke animatedly, her entire demeanor radiating smug satisfaction.

She watched Victoria closely, delighting in the flicker of surprise on her face.

Bet you didn't see that coming?

Jealous?

Too bad you can't afford it.

Victoria was indeed surprised—not by envy, but because she hadn't realized her in-laws were moving again. They'd just upgraded to a new place three years prior.

"...That old place was too cramped. The neighborhood wasn't nearly as nice as this one," Patricia dismissed airily.

Victoria nodded. "What will you do with your current home then—"

Charles started to answer, but Patricia tugged his sleeve sharply. She lifted her chin. "We're keeping it. Why sell or rent when we can wait for appreciation?"

The Lorenz family certainly had that luxury.

"Victoria, have you seen the high-rise models here?" Patricia abruptly changed the subject.

Victoria shook her head. "No."

Yesterday Evelyn had headed straight for the villa section without glancing at the towers.

"Let me tell you, the finishes are exquisite! All imported appliances, layouts designed by an Italian architect..." Patricia gushed. "And the landscaping—premium turf, professional running tracks, sports courts..."

"Living here could add ten years to your life!"

Charles couldn't help interjecting: "That's a bit much, don't you think?"

"Not at all! You saw everything yourself just now," Patricia shot back with an eye roll.

Charles fell silent. He simply felt this boasting was inappropriate in front of his sister-in-law.

But that was precisely the reaction Patricia wanted.

Her eyes gleamed. "Victoria, that old faculty housing you've been in for years is overdue for an upgrade. Why not buy here? We could be neighbors."

"Though the pricing..." She paused deliberately. "Might be steep. But William teaches at that elite prep school, doesn't he? With some private tutoring, he could easily cover the costs."
###Chapter 150

"The education bureau has been cracking down hard on after-school tutoring. William has always been law-abiding and never touches such things," Victoria said calmly.

Patricia Lorenz curled her lip in disdain.

What a fool to pass up easy money!

"If your husband won't earn extra income, there's still you," she said, eyes gleaming. "I hear writers can make millions from book royalties these days. After all these years of writing, you must have saved quite a fortune?"

Victoria's smile froze.

If writing could truly make her rich, she wouldn't have needed her daughter to buy them a villa.

Evelyn Langley noticed her mother's discomfort and intervened: "Uncle Charles, Aunt Patricia, we actually have somewhere to be—"

"What could possibly be so urgent during the holidays?" Patricia cut her off. "Evelyn, you're already in your twenties—no degree, no job, no boyfriend. What kind of grown woman still leeches off her parents?"

She hadn't forgotten the cherries incident.

"Your eldest cousin started a company in New York—boundless prospects. My Tiffany may not be as accomplished, but she landed a stable government job at the power bureau."

Patricia grew more animated: "Sometimes I worry for William. Raising a daughter who can't even support herself..."

Charles Lorenz frantically signaled her to stop, but she ignored him.

Victoria's smile turned icy: "Indeed, Tiffany is exceptional—getting into the power bureau right after community college."

Patricia lifted her chin proudly: "Of course! Tiffany's always been responsible. Her grandfather promised to introduce her to a government official soon—she'll be an official's wife..."

Suddenly raising her voice: "I lack nothing in life except wishing for our family's health and safety!"

"Enough!" Charles finally snapped. "Victoria, don't mind her—she speaks without thinking."

Patricia exploded: "Charles Lorenz! What exactly did I say wrong? The facts speak for themselves! Why are you apologizing?!"

Charles flushed crimson but stayed silent.

His entire career relied on his in-laws' connections—a cushy job at a power bureau subsidiary paying over ten thousand monthly. As the only daughter of the Zhou family, he dared not cross Patricia.

"Cat got your tongue? You were so eloquent earlier," Patricia pressed. "Back then I was the belle of the bureau—how did I end up married to someone like..."

Emily Fairsprene suddenly rushed from the reception area: "Miss Langley! Thank goodness you're still here!"

Breathlessly handing over documents: "We gave you the wrong contract earlier. Here's the original Purchase Agreement—please verify the details..."
###Chapter 151

Evelyn Langley took the document, her fingertips lightly tracing the paper's edge.

After verifying it was the original, she handed her photocopy to Emily Fairsprene.

"Sorry for the delay." Emily exhaled in relief. "The villa transaction process is so complicated..."

"It's fine."

Patricia Lorenz stood nearby, her frown deepening.

"What...what contract is this?" She suddenly pointed at the papers in Emily's hands.

"The property purchase agreement."

"Whose?"

"Miss Langley's villa purchase contract."

Patricia staggered back two steps, bracing against the wall to steady herself. "What? Evelyn bought property here?!"

"Yes." Emily gave her a puzzled glance.

"Impossible!" Patricia's voice shot up sharply. "Which unit did she get? 19 or 20? What's the square footage?"

"Ma'am, units 19 and 20 are regular residences. Miss Langley purchased in the villa district."

Patricia's face drained of color instantly.

"A villa?!" she shrieked. "The Lakeside Villa?!"

Evelyn sighed softly. "Aunt Patricia, it's true I don't have a job. I could only afford to buy my parents a villa as filial duty. I hope they'll live comfortably, so you won't need to worry about them anymore."

Patricia's lips trembled, rendered speechless.

"We'll go decorate the new home now." Victoria Langley linked arms with Evelyn. "We won't disturb Charles and Patricia's house hunting."

Just then, another sales agent hurried over.

"What are you doing here?" She frowned at Charles Lorenz and his wife. "This is the VIP reception lounge!"

Charles quickly apologized. "Our mistake, we got lost..."

"Made your decision yet?" The agent asked impatiently. "Will the deed be under Xiangjun Zhou or Hong Xiao? They must come personally with ID to sign."

She suppressed her frustration. While others were closing villa deals, she was still stuck haggling over regular units.

Evelyn and Victoria exchanged glances.

Xiangjun Zhou? Hong Xiao?

Those were Patricia's parents' names.

"So it's for your parents." Victoria smiled. "This area is indeed perfect for retirement."

"No!" Patricia denied hastily. "It's for us to live in!"

"Then why not use your own names?" Victoria feigned confusion.

The agent chimed in. "Exactly, using your own names is simpler. This unit's in high demand—it'll be gone by today."

She lowered her voice. "I'm only holding it because your daughter's my classmate..."
###Chapter 152

"The entire Lakeside Pearl development sold out immediately. Only a few units remain." The saleswoman maintained a professional smile, but her tone left no room for negotiation.

Patricia Lorenz stomped her foot in frustration. "We're definitely buying! Let's secure it now!"

"Please present your ID to sign the contract immediately."

Patricia's eyes darted nervously. "Can we...come back tomorrow to sign?"

The saleswoman's smile faded slightly. "They might be gone by tomorrow."

Patricia bit her lip. "Let me make a quick call."

She hurried to a corner, glancing warily back at Victoria and Evelyn to ensure they couldn't overhear before dialing.

"Dad, I'm at Lakeside Pearl! The units are selling like hotcakes..."

Her voice dripped with saccharine sweetness as her fingers absently twisted her purse strap.

The plan had been set long ago.

Her parents would purchase this luxury apartment for her to live in. After all, as their only daughter, the property would inevitably become hers someday.

"Hurry over to sign the contract! They're almost gone..."

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Victoria grew impatient.

William Langley's call came at the perfect moment. "Victoria, the Lakeside Villa is perfect! The backyard has space for flower beds, vegetable gardens, even a grapevine trellis..."

Victoria's eyes lit up. "We're on our way!"

...

Night fell by the time Patricia completed the paperwork.

Slumping into the car seat, she smirked in satisfaction. "Finally done."

Charles Lorenz frowned. "Was rushing necessary? Dragging your parents out this late..."

"You don't understand," Patricia scoffed. "Prime properties wait for no one."

She leaned closer to her husband. "Want to live there?"

Charles blinked. "What do you mean?"

"My parents' property will be mine eventually." Her smile turned calculating. "Why not enjoy it sooner?"

"You—" Charles inhaled sharply.

Patricia shrugged. "They only have me as their heir."

Gazing at the neon lights outside, she plotted how to persuade her parents.

That brat Evelyn could never afford such an expensive home anyway.
###Chapter 153

A sour bitterness welled up in Patricia Lorenz's heart.

Among the three Langley brothers, the eldest William Langley was undoubtedly the most successful. As the CEO of a listed company, he had long since left ordinary people like them far behind.

Her own family came next. Though Charles Lorenz couldn't compare to his eldest brother, he was still a manager at an inspection company with an annual salary over $300,000. Combined with her secure government job at the power bureau and their daughter Tiffany landing a stable position, they lived quite comfortably.

The youngest brother's family was the most pitiful.

What good was graduating from Harvard? He'd still ended up as just an ordinary high school teacher in their hometown, too rigid-minded to earn extra income. And Victoria Langley was a complete joke—calling herself a "writer" while being essentially unemployed.

All these years and she hadn't published a single decent book, let alone sold any film rights. Never even held a book signing—what kind of writer was that?

"Stay-at-home" would be more accurate!

This hierarchy had been perfect... until now. How could the youngest brother's family possibly afford a villa? And in Lakeside Pearl—the most exclusive development in the neighboring city?

Her own parents had scrimped their whole lives just to buy a tiny apartment. What right did the youngest brother's family have?

"Charles, what's your youngest brother been up to lately? Anything unusual?"

"How should I know?"

"Aren't you his own brother?"

"We barely interact—you're the one who told me to keep my distance."

Patricia fell silent.

She had indeed avoided associating with the youngest brother's family. Who wanted to socialize with people beneath them? She'd been afraid Victoria might ask to borrow money!

"Why are you suddenly asking about this?"

"Your brother's family quietly bought a villa. Aren't you curious?"

Charles went quiet.

Of course he was curious.

It was downright bizarre!

Like a beggar suddenly becoming a millionaire—who wouldn't want to know how?

"Didn't Victoria say Evelyn bought it..."

"Ha! Where would a girl like Evelyn Langley get that kind of money? Selling herself?"

"Don't be disgusting!"

Wait...

Money from selling herself.

Why hadn't she thought of that?

Patricia's eyes lit up, her face twisting with disdain even as jealous sparks flickered in her pupils.

She pulled out her phone and dialed a number—

"Grace? Are you busy?"

"What is it, Patricia?"

"I went to look at Lakeside Pearl today. Guess who I saw?"

Grace sounded disinterested. "Who?"

"Your sister-in-law Victoria and Evelyn!"

"They were house-hunting too?"

"House-hunting? They bought a villa outright!"

"...What?" Grace wondered if she'd misheard.
###Chapter 154

Grace Deross's grip tightened around her phone. "William's family bought a villa? Are you sure it's them?"

Patricia Lorenz scoffed on the other end. "My eyesight isn't that bad. I clearly saw Victoria and Evelyn."

Grace's throat went dry. "Where did they get the money?"

"The purchase agreement was right there in black and white." Patricia lowered her voice. "Rumor has it Evelyn paid for it."

"Evelyn?" Grace's voice shot up. "She's just a college student!"

Patricia chuckled knowingly. "These young girls nowadays have their ways. Designer bags, luxury goods—if they can't afford it themselves, someone will gladly provide..."

"What are you implying?"

"Oh dear, my big mouth." Patricia feigned regret. "Never mind. I should go."

After hanging up, Grace stared blankly at her phone.

Patricia immediately dialed Elizabeth Melville.

"Elizabeth, it's Patricia..."

Elizabeth's voice came through. "Perfect timing. We have extra client gifts this year—prepared some for your family and William's."

Patricia's stomach dropped. "Since when does William's family get included?"

"More to go around this year." Elizabeth's tone was casual.

Patricia's voice turned sour. "How generous. Though I doubt William's family needs your handouts anymore."

"What do you mean?"

"They're moving into Lakeside Villas soon. Your little gifts must seem awfully provincial."

Elizabeth's iron froze mid-air. "Lakeside Villas?"

She knew that development well. She'd visited the sales office three times while hunting for Daniel's wedding home.

The villas had been perfect—until she saw the $4 million price tag.

"You're certain it's William's family?" Elizabeth's voice strained.

"Positive." Patricia added fuel to the fire. "Apparently Evelyn financed it. How does a girl her age—"

Elizabeth slammed the phone down, smashing the iron onto the board.

She remembered the sales manager's dismissive attitude last week.

"Villas are in high demand. Cash buyers take priority."

She'd left empty-handed—only for William's family to waltz in?

Elizabeth grabbed her phone and called her husband. "Richard, we need to revisit the Lakeside Villas situation. Immediately."
###Chapter 155

"We can buy new ones when funds become available." Elizabeth Melville bit back her words at her husband's remark.

Her fingers clenched. The idea of buying a secondhand marital home was utterly distasteful.

But with company accounts stretched thin, she had no choice but to swallow her pride.

Yet the Lakeside Villa festered in her mind like a splinter.

Too expensive to afford, too painful to forget.

"Are you sure it's the Lakeside Villa?" Elizabeth's fingertips trembled as she pressed for confirmation.

Patricia Lorenz's chuckle carried through the phone, laced with implication. "I saw the purchase contract myself. Victoria admitted Evelyn bought it."

"Girls these days are so accomplished—far more than Daniel."

Elizabeth's breath hitched.

Her son's company earned millions annually, yet he'd never gifted his parents a villa.

"Where did Evelyn get that kind of money?"

"How should I know?" Patricia pivoted smoothly. "By the way, I'll have Charles collect those items tomorrow."

Hanging up, Patricia smirked at her phone.

Charles frowned. "Must you broadcast everything?"

"Sharing with family isn't broadcasting." She rolled her eyes. "I'm just happy for William."

"Spare me the act."

Patricia suddenly leaned in, causing Charles to jerk the steering wheel.

"I'm simply curious about the money source." Her eyes narrowed. "Let everyone ask around—someone will uncover the truth."

Even if they didn't, constant prying would be torment enough.

Charles scoffed. "Elizabeth avoids gossip, and Grace detests it most of all."

"You understand nothing." Patricia's smile turned icy. "Grace despises gold-diggers, and Elizabeth..."

She left the sentence unfinished, her grin chilling further.

......

The doorbell rang as William Langley packed old clothes.

"Grace?" He blinked at his rarely visiting sister. "Come in."

Grace Deross surveyed the cardboard-covered floor before seating herself with deliberate grace.

"Moving out?"

Victoria paused mid-fold. "Just organizing some old things."
###Chapter 156

"All packed up?" She stared at the cardboard boxes.

"Pretty much done."

"Are you moving?"

"Yeah."

"Where to?"

William Langley and Victoria exchanged a glance, deciding there was no point hiding it.

They'd find out eventually.

William: "The new Lakeside Pearl development nearby."

"Buying an apartment?"

"No," William shook his head. "A standalone villa."

Grace Deross's face showed perfectly measured surprise. "William, where'd you get that kind of money? Even the cheapest villa there costs at least three to four million. You didn't..."

She trailed off, concern flashing in her eyes. "Nothing illegal, I hope."

"Don't be ridiculous," William chuckled. "I wouldn't dare."

"Then how—"

"It's Eve—"

"Dad!" Evelyn suddenly walked in from the balcony, cutting him off. "You're so busy chatting, you haven't even asked Aunt Grace why she dropped by unannounced."

"Right, Grace. What brings you here today...?"

Someone who never visited suddenly showing up meant only one thing.

Grace froze.

She hadn't expected Evelyn to interrupt, leaving her momentarily speechless.

"I... had a client meeting nearby. Thought I'd stop by."

"Didn't Aunt Grace just get promoted to branch manager? Shouldn't you be swamped?"

Grace forced a smile. "No matter how busy, family comes first... By the way, Evelyn, we didn't get to talk properly at your uncle's place last time."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "What did you want to talk about?"

"After coming back this time, are you leaving again after New Year's?"

"Unless something changes, I'll return to Cambridge."

"For work? School? Or..."

Evelyn paused. "Let's call it exploring new opportunities."

Once her grad school acceptance came through, she could say it was for studies.

But without the official letter, she didn't want to jinx it.

To Grace, however, this vague answer sounded like code for "idling around" and "hunting for a new sugar daddy."

Her expression darkened as she beckoned Evelyn over. "Come, sit here. Let's have a chat."

Baffled but compliant, Evelyn took a seat.

"Evelyn, do you know what matters most for a woman?"

"?"

"Independence. Resilience. And keeping both feet on the ground."

"??"

"Look at me—grew up poor, but studied my way into college."

"Couldn't find a good job after graduating, so I started as a teller. Now I'm branch manager."

"When my marriage failed, I divorced without hesitation. Doing just fine on my own now."

"So... what exactly are you trying to say?"
###Chapter 157

Grace Deross set down her teacup with deliberate care. "A woman's greatest virtue is staying true to herself. Those seemingly easy shortcuts are often traps in disguise."

Evelyn Langley nodded softly. "You're absolutely right, Aunt Grace."

"Do you truly mean that?" A flicker of relief passed through Grace's eyes.

"Of course."

"Good." She exhaled. "Return that villa immediately. I'll cover the penalty fee."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

Grace's expression darkened. "Were my words wasted on you?"

A sudden smile curved Evelyn's lips. "I've taken your advice to heart. But—"

Her fingertip tapped the tabletop. "Every penny I spend is cleanly earned. While I appreciate your concern, there's no need to assume the worst."

The message couldn't be clearer.

"That villa is my parents' retirement home. The paperwork is already finalized." She stood, smoothing her sleeves. "Also, I'd suggest exercising more discretion when offering unsolicited advice."

This wasn't discussion—it was declaration.

Grace stormed out, the door slamming behind her.

"Ungrateful wretch!" Her venomous glare lingered before she disappeared.

William Langley frowned. "Ignore her."

Victoria Langley snorted. "Barging in to lecture without understanding the situation."

Every word had insinuated their daughter's wealth was ill-gotten.

Evelyn felt no anger, only concern that rumors might spread, inviting more meddling relatives.

Strangely, the following week passed undisturbed.

Moving preparations progressed methodically.

William agonized over transplanting his beloved garden—three full days spent relocating the aged osmanthus tree alone.

Victoria meticulously packed her treasured book collection.

By Lantern Festival, their new home stood ready.

Transplanted wisteria climbed fresh trellises while a swing swayed gently in the breeze. Tender amaranth sprouts dotted the newly tilled vegetable patch.

Though the front yard remained bare, spring would transform it into a floral paradise.

The move spawned one amusing incident.

Neighbor Brenda Murphy spent days peering over the fence, convinced they were fleeing.

"So, where are you off to?" she finally drawled, leaning against their doorframe with false sweetness.
###Chapter 158

William Langley kept digging the soil, ignoring Brenda Murphy's sarcastic remarks.

Inside the house, Victoria Langley heard the commotion and immediately turned away.

She had no intention of wasting her breath on such a person.

Brenda carried a vegetable basket, muttering under her breath, "So what if they're moving out? They're still the ones who got chased away..."

"Brenda, back from grocery shopping?" Mrs. Watson, their neighbor, greeted her.

"Yep! Got these eggs for half the price at the morning market!" Brenda proudly shook her basket.

She was notorious in the neighborhood for her penny-pinching ways.

"I should learn your budgeting skills. By the way, I heard Mr. Langley next door is moving?"

Brenda smirked. "That's right. Wonder where they'll end up—nowhere as convenient as here, I bet."

She secretly gloated. Throwing a tantrum at their age?

Good riddance. At least she wouldn’t have to trim those annoying vines anymore.

Mrs. Watson lowered her voice. "Could it be because of that argument last time?"

Brenda lifted her chin. "Who knows? If that's the reason, it just proves how petty some people are!"

"You’re something else. Now you can use their yard for your vegetable patch..."

"That’s exactly what I’m planning!" Brenda’s eyes gleamed.

"Still chatting here?" Mrs. Heilbronn hurried past. "Go get the housewarming candies before they run out!"

Brenda froze. "What candies?"

"The Langleys are handing out treats for their new home. As neighbors, you must’ve gotten yours already. I need to hurry..."

"Wait!" Brenda grabbed her arm. "Why would William give out candies for moving? It’s not a wedding..."

"You didn’t know? The Langleys bought a villa! They’re giving housewarming treats to the neighbors."

Brenda’s eyes widened. "A villa?! They bought it?!"

"Yes! That Lakeside Pearl estate nearby. Heard it’s absolutely stunning!"

Brenda’s face turned ghostly pale. "That’s impossible..."

"My husband helped move some plants last week. Saw it with his own eyes—two huge yards, beautifully decorated. Gotta go get those candies now..."

Brenda stood rooted, as if struck by lightning.

Her cheeks burned with humiliation.

......

On their first night in the new home, William cooked dinner himself.

Victoria raised her glass. "To our new home and new life. May it only get better."

"Clink—"

Three glasses met, their laughter drifting through the open window.

Moonlight bathed the garden in warmth.

The next morning, William received a call from Margaret Roland.

"Mom?"

"I heard you’ve moved?"

William’s heart skipped. "Yes."

"Tradition says you should host a housewarming for family. Tomorrow’s the Lantern Festival—we always celebrate at your brother’s place. This year, it’ll be at yours."
###Chapter 159

"I need to discuss this with Victoria first..." William Langley gripped his phone, hesitation evident in his voice.

"Discuss?" The elderly woman's displeasure crackled through the line. "A grown man like you can't make a simple decision?"

"Mom, this isn't trivial..."

"Enough! Your father and I are coming tomorrow!" She cut him off sharply before slamming the phone down.

William sighed and set his phone aside.

"What's wrong?" Victoria stepped in from the garden, noticing her husband's troubled expression.

"Mom insists on celebrating the Lantern Festival here tomorrow..."

Victoria smiled. "Perfect. Let's invite Charles and Elizabeth too—make it a family gathering."

The next morning, Victoria headed to the farmer's market early.

By four in the afternoon, relatives began arriving.

Patricia Lorenz froze in the foyer. Though she'd heard about the villa, seeing it firsthand left a bitter taste in her mouth.

She stood speechless for a long moment.

"Stop gawking," Charles Lorenz nudged her.

"Congratulations..." Patricia forced a strained smile.

Tiffany Lorenz eyed the surroundings eagerly. "Aunt Victoria, can I look around?"

"Of course." Victoria nodded warmly.

Tiffany circled the living room twice before vanishing upstairs.

Elizabeth Melville had taken the day off, arriving with a thick red envelope.

"Such a beautiful home." She pressed the envelope into Victoria's hands.

"Elizabeth, you shouldn't—"

"Keep it. We're family."

The elderly couple followed Elizabeth inside, sinking onto the plush sectional.

Their eyes swept the space, widening at the understated luxury.

Every curated detail—selected by Evelyn and Victoria—spoke of refinement.

"William, how much did this place cost?" George Roland couldn't help asking.

"Evelyn handled the renovations. I'm not entirely sure..." William deflected modestly.

"Must be at least five million," Patricia interjected. "More than we'll earn in a lifetime."

Grace Deross stood stiffly nearby, her expression dark. "Third Brother has an exceptional daughter. No use comparing."

"Exactly," Patricia added with a pointed smile. "Evelyn's so capable. Our Tiffany could never measure up."
###Chapter 160

Elizabeth Melville's eyes gleamed with calculation. "What does Evelyn do in Boston? It must be impressive. Ordinary people can't save up millions."

Evelyn Langley pressed her lips together. Victoria Langley gently squeezed her daughter's hand.

"You flatter her. Evelyn changed jobs a few times after Harvard. She just saved some modest earnings."

Grace Deross snorted. "Hopefully not through questionable means. Girls should know their place."

Victoria remained composed. "Children have their own paths. We should support them as elders."

Patricia Lorenz arched an eyebrow. "Paths? Or is she hunting for new targets? Will she bring back another few million next time?"

She emphasized the word "targets" deliberately.

Victoria's expression darkened. Just as she was about to respond, Evelyn's phone rang.

"Mom, I need to take this..."

"Go ahead." Victoria took a deep breath.

"Sophia?"

Sophia Laurent's voice came urgently. "The grad school results are out! Check yours now!"

Evelyn suddenly remembered today was score release day.

"Okay, checking now."

She hurried upstairs and entered her exam ID on the computer.

As her finger hovered over the search button—

"Are these bags real?"

Tiffany Lorenz emerged from the walk-in closet clutching a Chanel, an LV slung over her shoulder.

"Who said you could come in here?"

"Aunt Grace said I could look around."

"Looking doesn't mean rummaging through private belongings."

"They're just bags. Why so touchy?"

Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "Did no one teach you not to touch others' property?"

"I did it anyway. What will you do?"

"Put. Them. Back."

"Stop pretending! These were obviously bought by some man!"

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the room.

"That slap teaches you to watch your mouth."

"You hit me?!" Tiffany shrieked, clutching her cheek.

"I don't need an appointment to slap you."

"I'll kill you!"

Downstairs, the relatives continued speculating about Evelyn's income sources.

Suddenly, screams erupted from the second floor.

Patricia jumped up. "That's Tiffany!"
###Chapter 161

Rapid footsteps echoed from the second-floor hallway. Everyone followed the commotion to Evelyn Langley's door.

Tiffany Lorenz sat slumped on the floor, two designer handbags scattered beside her. When the crowd poured in, she immediately let out a dramatic wail, kicking her legs wildly.

A perfect image of a vulgar shrew.

"Tiffany!" Patricia Lorenz rushed forward. "Get up, the floor is cold—"

"No! Not until Evelyn apologizes!" Tiffany jutted her chin defiantly.

Evelyn crossed her arms with a cold smile. "The floor's clean. Sit there as long as you like."

"You—"

Patricia's expression darkened. "Apologize for what? Explain yourself."

"She hit me!" Tiffany pointed to a red mark on her arm.

Patricia whirled around. "Evelyn, how could you lay hands on her?"

"My apologies, Aunt Patricia." Evelyn spoke leisurely. "I heard noises in my walk-in closet and thought it was a burglar." She glanced at the bags on the floor. "Though I wonder why Tiffany was rummaging through my wardrobe?"

Patricia froze. "She—she was probably just curious..."

"Do normal people sneak into others' closets?" Evelyn arched a brow.

Patricia shot her daughter a sharp glare. Tiffany shrank back.

"Just a misunderstanding," Victoria Langley interjected with a conciliatory smile. "Let's all go downstairs—"

A ringing phone cut her off. William Langley picked up his daughter's phone and accidentally hit speakerphone.

"Evelyn! Did you check your scores? Did you get into Harvard?" Sophia Laurent's bright voice exploded through the room.

The air turned to ice.

"Hello? Can you hear me?" The voice continued.

Evelyn swiftly took the phone. "Checking now."

After hanging up, every eye locked onto her. Even Tiffany forgot her theatrics.

"Ch-check what scores?" William's voice trembled.

"Graduate school entrance exam."

"You took the GRE?" Victoria's eyes widened.

"Yes."

Patricia scoffed. "Aren't you too old for grad school?"

"Aunt Patricia," Evelyn smiled, "the age limit is forty."

"Why suddenly—"

"Had free time."

Patricia choked on her words.

"Scores come out today?" Elizabeth Melville glanced at the laptop on the desk. "Tiffany, stop this. Let Evelyn check her results."

Tiffany's eyes gleamed as she brushed off her skirt and stood. "Since we're checking scores, let's all watch. My dear cousin must've aced it."

Her inner sneer was palpable. Harvard grad school? In your dreams.
###Chapter 162

A cold smirk played on Tiffany Lorenz's lips.

Six years without touching a textbook, and now aiming for grad school?

She couldn't wait to see Evelyn Langley's humiliation when the results came out.

Elizabeth Melville feigned concern. "Now that Tiffany mentioned it, I'm curious about Evelyn's scores too."

Grace Deross chimed in with false sympathy. "Why not check? It's fine if she failed—she's been out of practice for so long."

Victoria Langley frowned, ready to decline.

But Evelyn nodded calmly. "Sure."

The group gathered around the computer.

William Langley's fingers trembled as he entered the exam ID.

The living room held its breath during those agonizing seconds of loading.

"Scores are out!"

Total: 412.

Patricia Lorenz whispered, "Is 400-something good?"

Tiffany's face drained of color.

Elizabeth suppressed her shock. "The GRE max is 500. This score would place Evelyn in the top three, if not first."

Patricia gasped. "She actually got into Harvard?!"

Grace cut in sharply. "There's still the interview."

Elizabeth smiled knowingly. "The written exam counts for 70%. It's practically a done deal. Congratulations, William."

William's eyes glistened.

Six years ago, his daughter had abandoned her education for a man.

Now she'd returned with a lakeside villa and an acceptance letter.

Everything was finally falling into place.

"Thank you, Elizabeth."

Elizabeth raised her voice pointedly. "Evelyn will be the most educated in our family now."

Tiffany's nails dug into her palms.

Patricia's face turned ashen.

Grace sneered. "Don't celebrate until the official letter arrives."

The dinner continued with tension thick enough to cut.

Guests left hastily, abandoning even perfunctory pleasantries.

......

January 20th—Victoria's birthday.

After days of rain, the clouds finally parted.

Tender green shoots peeked through the garden soil.

Evelyn moved about the kitchen, apron tied neatly.

She remembered her mother's distaste for sweets.

A steaming bowl of hand-pulled longevity noodles sat ready.

Her gift was a rare first-edition book set.

She'd scoured global websites for weeks.

It had crossed oceans to reach them after fifteen days.
###Chapter 163

Evelyn Langley almost thought she'd miss Victoria Langley's birthday. Fortunately, the express delivery arrived on time.

Victoria held the collector's edition books with sparkling eyes. "I've been searching for this out-of-print set for three years!"

"You kept mentioning it every time we passed a bookstore." Evelyn tilted her head. "My ears were about to grow calluses."

Victoria huffed. "Who told you not to come home for half a year..." Suddenly, she spread her arms. "Come here."

Evelyn was pulled into a warm embrace. Victoria's fingers combed through her shoulder-length hair. "When did you cut it?"

"Last month." Evelyn nuzzled her mother's shoulder. "Does it look bad?"

"My daughter is beautiful no matter what!" Victoria pinched her cheek. "Have they scheduled your re-examination?"

Evelyn stiffened slightly. "Next week."

The clatter of a spatula came from the kitchen. William Langley poked his head out. "The food's getting cold!"

The next morning, the high-speed train pulled into Boston Station.

The apartment door lock made a grating sound when turned. Two goldfish darted in panic inside the aquarium before happily blowing bubbles upon recognizing their owner.

The succulents on the windowsill had turned red from sun exposure, thriving unexpectedly.

The underfloor heating hummed to life. Evelyn rolled up her sleeves and stripped the dusty curtains, tossing them into the washing machine. The pink velvet sofa covers looked fluffy and soft in the sunlight.

At six in the evening, the grocery delivery rang the doorbell.

As Adrian Klein stepped out of the elevator, the seventh-floor hallway was filled with the aroma of sweet and sour ribs. He paused, gazing at the long-unseen door now glowing with light.

Just as his key touched the lock, a soft click sounded behind him.

"Professor Klein." Evelyn held up a spatula. "Care to taste my cooking?"

The hem of Adrian's lab coat swung as he turned. "Seems I returned at the perfect moment."

"Did Sophia tell you I was coming home today?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Did she also mention my written exam results?"

"Top of the entire department." Adrian accepted the slippers she handed him. "So this is a victory dinner?"

Evelyn made sparks fly with a flick of the wok. "That'll have to wait until I pass the re-examination."

"You will." His voice blended with the sizzling oil. "Just as spring always comes."
###Chapter 164

Harvard University's graduate admissions interview took place on the first Monday of March.

Evelyn Langley hesitated before her wardrobe before selecting a navy blue pantsuit.

She paired it with a crisp white blouse and three-centimeter block-heeled leather shoes.

The outfit was professional without being ostentatious.

Before leaving, her gaze caught a peacock-blue printed silk scarf on the dresser.

She draped it around her neck, instantly brightening the somber ensemble.

Last night's spring rain left the air heavy with moisture.

Puddles dotted the pavement, reflecting the overcast sky.

The waiting room buzzed with nervous energy.

Some candidates flipped through notes repeatedly while others paced with restless hands.

Evelyn sat quietly in a corner, fingers tapping rhythmically against her knee.

"You seem remarkably calm," remarked a ponytailed girl in front of her.

Evelyn offered a small smile. "Preparation breeds confidence."

Countless sleepless nights had led to this moment.

"Number 46, Evelyn Langley—"

"Here."

She straightened her collar and followed the attendant toward the examination room.

Her breath caught when she entered.

Seated at the center of the judging panel was Adrian Klein.

The physicist looked strikingly different in his charcoal gray suit, the sharp lines accentuating his angular features.

Behind gold-rimmed glasses, his piercing gaze contrasted sharply with his usual gentle demeanor.

Yet when his eyes met Evelyn's, a fleeting softness flickered through them.

The interview commenced.

She answered the initial technical questions with practiced ease.

The examiners exchanged glances before throwing curveballs beyond standard preparation.

After brief consideration, Evelyn delivered equally impressive responses.

"Professor Klein, your turn."

He adjusted his glasses. "Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in biology, mathematics, and computer science. Are you certain you possess such capabilities?"

"I'm prepared," Evelyn met his gaze steadily.

"Then the following questions may span multiple disciplines, potentially requiring live calculations."

"Proceed."

Adrian switched to fluent English: "Explain the physical properties of quasicrystals using data modeling."

The room froze.

This question ventured far beyond biological boundaries.

Other panel members exchanged startled looks—this belonged in a physics department exam.
###Chapter 165

"Yes, but not entirely," Evelyn Langley answered softly.

"What are quasicrystals?" Adrian Klein's voice cut like a scalpel.

"Quasicrystals are a unique atomic structure." Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "Their atomic arrangement lacks the periodic repetition of crystals, yet isn't completely disordered like amorphous solids."

She paused. "Dan Shechtman won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering quasicrystals."

"Wait!" An examiner interrupted. "Chemistry? This is a biology graduate interview."

Adrian tapped the table with slender fingers. "I said questions wouldn't be limited to one discipline."

Gasps rippled through the conference room.

"That's too advanced for undergrads..."
"She was doing well until Professor Klein..."

Adrian ignored them. "Would you like to forfeit?"

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly. "May I have a whiteboard and markers?"

The key lay in "data support."

This was an interdisciplinary test.

Staff quickly provided the materials.

Her marker scratched against the board as she wrote the first chemical formula.

She began with quasicrystal atomic structure.

Icosahedral symmetry.
Golden ratio values.
High-resolution imaging analysis of Al-Mn quasicrystals.

The chemistry section complete.

Next came mathematical derivations.

Fractal geometry formulas expanded across the board.
Pattern sequences evolving through second, third, to k-th order.
Precise calculations of correlation measures and dimensions.

The first board filled.

Adrian signaled for a replacement.

Physics divided into theory and application.

Three fundamental theorems.
Seven core equations.
Sixteen derived corollaries.

Numbers danced across the surface as formulas grew like vines. When stuck, she proved theories directly.

Applications proved more complex.

Stainless steel heat treatment.
Mg-Zn-Re alloy properties.
Fibonacci quasicrystal diffraction patterns.

The second board filled rapidly.

A third board arrived.

When the final three derivations landed, Evelyn's blouse clung to her damp back.

"My answer is complete." She set down the marker, knuckles white from pressure.

Silence hung thick enough to hear the AC hum.

Adrian's stern expression finally shifted. "Thank you. You may leave."

As Evelyn bowed out, an examiner muttered, "That would challenge graduate students..."

"Only exceptional candidates," Adrian's voice carried clearly, "deserve to test their limits."
###Chapter 166

Sunlight streamed through the glass windows, scattering golden flecks across the hallway. Evelyn Langley stepped out of the examination room, her shoes tapping against the illuminated floor tiles.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Sophia Laurent: "Waiting at our usual spot."

Evelyn opened the ride-hailing app, her fingers dancing lightly across the screen.

"Evelyn?" A familiar female voice called from behind.

Isabella Evans stood there in a beige trench coat, clutching a document folder. She'd come early to scope out the interview location, never expecting to run into Evelyn.

"Finished your interview already?" Isabella's gaze swept over her.

"Yes."

"What was your written exam score?"

"412."

Isabella's pupils contracted. Her voice rose sharply. "You're the top scorer in our field?!"

Evelyn blinked. "I didn't check the rankings."

"Stop pretending to be above it all." Isabella sneered. "Flashing your results in my face on purpose?"

Evelyn couldn't be bothered to explain. Since breaking up with Nathan Evans, his family meant nothing to her.

"I need to go."

"Wait!" Isabella suddenly blocked her path. "Were the interview questions difficult? What did they ask?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Are you asking me to leak the questions?"

"Don't make it sound so crude." Isabella lowered her voice. "Consider it... sharing experiences."

"Each candidate gets different questions." Evelyn met her gaze directly. "Besides, we're competitors."

Isabella's face stiffened.

The Evelyn she remembered was that foolish woman who'd bend over backward to please her brother. But this Evelyn had sharp eyes and an unyielding posture—like a sword drawn from its sheath.

Isabella suddenly recalled her brother murmuring Evelyn's name during his hospitalization. Seeing Evelyn now, radiant and confident, an inexplicable fury rose in her chest.

"You've changed." Isabella ground her teeth.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "People grow up."

She turned to leave, her back straight as bamboo. Sunlight danced across her shoulders, gilding her silhouette.

Isabella stared at the retreating figure, her nails digging deep into her palms.
###Chapter 167

Adrian's knuckles rested on the shopping cart handle, his slender fingers glowing like polished jade under the supermarket lights. Evelyn's gaze skimmed over the instant meal packages in the cart before meeting his lowered eyes.

"Professor Klein, is this really your dinner?" She tapped a prepackaged meal with her fingertip.

He adjusted his glasses. "Just something quick for late nights at the lab."

"Scientifically balanced," he added. "Calculated protein and carb ratios."

Evelyn's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Only a physics professor would say that."

"But if you had to choose between a hot meal and instant food?"

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. The answer was obvious.

"I'll cook dinner." Evelyn lifted the fish in her hand. "If you'll lend me a hand, Professor."

In the kitchen, Adrian frowned at the whole fish on the cutting board.

"Did the supermarket fishmonger take the day off?"

"The line was too long." She avoided his gaze guiltily.

Rolling up his shirt sleeves, Adrian set his silver-framed glasses aside on the counter. The knife blade flashed silver under the lights.

Five minutes later, Evelyn gaped at the perfectly even fish slices.

"Are you sure you've never cooked before?"

"I got an A in dissection class." He wiped his hands with a paper towel, fish scales still glinting on his fingertips.

Soon the kitchen filled with the aroma of sauerkraut fish. The beef Adrian had bought simmered in spicy broth while vibrant greens floated on the surface.

Bubbles piled high in the sink as they washed dishes. Holding a trash bag by the entryway, Evelyn said, "See you at the library tomorrow."

Adrian's evening jog never happened. Standing in the elevator, the lingering fish scent still clung to his fingers.

At 3 AM, Evelyn jolted awake to her buzzing phone.

Sophia's video call flashed in the dark.

"Help!" The girl on screen frantically applied foundation. "My mom scheduled a blind date at 8 AM!"

Propping her phone on the nightstand, Evelyn yawned. "The library opens at seven."

"Maybe I should just go on the date." Sophia's eyeliner went crooked as she groaned.

WeChat notifications chimed repeatedly. Theme park photos showed Evelyn wearing fox ears while someone pinched her cheek, blurred crowds in the background.

Her finger froze on the last image. Chloe and Nathan's interlaced fingers blurred into the carousel lights like silhouettes from another world.
###Chapter 168

"It's all Evelyn Langley's fault! She stole my spot!" Isabella Evans screamed hysterically, smashing a vase to the floor. "And you! Why did you let her take that exam?"

Nathan Evans felt a throbbing pain in his temples.

The moment he heard "Evelyn Langley," his entire body tensed.

Since returning from the Maldives, he'd tried countless numbers to reach her—all met with silence.

He'd camped outside her apartment, but she was never there.

The gnawing anxiety kept him awake night after night.

And now, this was how he finally learned of her whereabouts...

"What do you mean?" His voice was strained.

"She ranked first! Professor Eleanor Roland is only accepting three students this year, and I was fourth!" Isabella shrieked. "If not for her, I would've made it!"

Nathan froze.

"She... got in?"

"Yes! With flying colors!" Isabella laughed mockingly. "She's thriving without you, about to become a Harvard graduate student. Regretting it now? Should've kept her locked up tighter!"

"Enough!" Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. "Your failure is your own incompetence. One more word like that—"

The air turned icy.

Isabella clamped her mouth shut, trembling, until Margaret Evans entered, breaking the tension.

Taking in the shattered debris and her daughter's terrified expression, Margaret frowned.

She'd heard everything outside.

Evelyn actually got in?

That day at the library, she'd assumed the girl was putting on an act. Yet not only had she taken the exam, she'd been admitted as Harvard's top candidate.

Margaret curled her lip.

What did degrees matter? She'd never be good enough for the Evans family.

"Your brother is right," she said coldly. "Prove yourself next year. Throwing tantrums won't help."

"I won't accept this!" Isabella clenched her fists. "I prepared for two years. She only studied for six months. How could she outperform me? There must be foul play! I'll confront her myself!"

She stormed out.

Nathan massaged his temples and left the chaos behind.

Margaret stared at the wrecked room, fuming.

These children would be the death of her.

Following a memorized address, Isabella sped to Evelyn's apartment, fury burning hotter with each mile. She rehearsed her accusations in her head.

But as she parked, she froze.

Evelyn was walking into the building—with a man.

Isabella gasped.

She recognized him.

Adrian Klein, a Harvard professor!
###Chapter 169

Her furious gaze instantly sharpened with calculation.

Perfect.

So that's how it was.

No wonder she aced the final interview.

Isabella Evans swiftly pulled out her phone, snapping multiple shots of the retreating figures.

The frozen screen showed Adrian Klein half a step behind Evelyn Langley, his tall frame completely enveloping her petite form.

With clever camera angles, it appeared as though he was intimately embracing her.

This trip had been worth it.

A cold smirk curled Isabella's lips. Evelyn had only herself to blame for overreaching and standing in her way.

Back in her car, she immediately opened her laptop and logged into Harvard's official website.

The whistleblower email was prominently displayed on the homepage.

With practiced efficiency, she uploaded the photos and typed out a righteous accusation: "...To uphold our century-old institution's integrity and eradicate academic corruption, we demand an immediate investigation into Evelyn Langley's admission qualifications."

Clicking "Send Anonymously," the email vanished into cyberspace.

Simultaneously, a viral post exploded across Harvard's forums.

The scandalous rumors about the top graduate candidate and the celebrity professor ignited the internet during the sensitive interview period.

Hashtags like #AcademicSeductress and #AdmissionsScandal rocketed to the top of trending lists.

"Bedroom skills trump years of study? Is this Harvard's new admission standard?"

"Let's investigate her undergrad 'extracurricular activities'—we all know what that means."

"When education becomes transactional, what hope do ordinary students have?"

"Photo evidence! How long will Harvard stay silent?"

"Revoke Evelyn Langley's admission! Fire that unethical professor!"

"If we stay silent today, who will speak for us tomorrow? Share this!"

"Dox her! Let society see her true colors!"

......

Sophia Laurent spilled her奶茶 across the couch when the notifications flooded in.

Her trembling fingers scrolled through the already-toxic comment section.

"Oh no, no no no..."

She exited the app and frantically dialed Evelyn's number.

Evelyn was currently buried in research notes.

After passing the final interview, she'd immediately plunged into preparation for lab team selections.

Her desk overflowed with meticulous schedules, every minute accounted for—even hydration breaks.

She barely glanced up when answering the call.

"You're still studying?" Sophia's voice cracked. "Someone posted photos of you with Adrian online! The entire internet's accusing you of sleeping your way in!"

Evelyn's fountain pen gouged a jagged line across her notes.
###Chapter 170

The comments on her phone screen kept refreshing, each one as sharp as a knife.

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly, almost dropping her phone.

"Evelyn? Are you still there?"

Sophia's anxious voice suddenly rose through the phone.

Evelyn stared at the vicious comments, her throat tight. "...I'm fine."

"Don't pay attention to those trolls. They have no idea how much effort you've put in. My brother and I won't let you suffer like this."

Sophia's words warmed Evelyn's heart.

"Thank you, Sophia."

As soon as she hung up, Adrian's call popped up.

"Someone is deliberately manipulating public opinion," he said bluntly. "This backlash is clearly targeting your grad school admission results."

Evelyn bit her lower lip, silent.

"The university has formed an investigation team," Adrian said calmly. "The truth will come out soon."

"Can we find out who did this?"

"It's only a matter of time. Professor Eleanor has already stepped forward to vouch for you."

It turned out that when the backlash first started, Professor Eleanor had been the first to defend her.

The strict professor had actually been the first to speak up for her.

Evelyn pictured Professor Eleanor arguing firmly on her behalf, and her lips curled into a small smile.

"Thank you."

Adrian noticed the lightness in her voice. "Feeling better now?"

"Yeah."

"Excellence is never a crime," he said gently. "Don't be afraid. I'll always be here for you."

Evelyn's ears burned. "Okay."

...

The next day, the trending list was completely transformed.

The smear posts from yesterday had vanished, replaced by the full video of Evelyn's grad school interview.

In the footage, she remained composed, answering every question flawlessly.

Her responses to each technical question were impeccable.

The comment section exploded:

Is this really a live interview? She's unshakable!

As a Harvard grad student, I can confirm the interview process is strict—no way to fake it.

Seriously, her eyes light up when she answers questions!

Finally, someone noticed her looks! Genius + beauty—what a dream combo!

Am I the only one shipping her with Professor Klein? Quietly raising my CP flag!
###Chapter 171

Harvard University's official account released a video that sent shockwaves across the internet.

Observant netizens quickly discovered the verified status of the account.

This served as direct vindication for Evelyn Langley.

In the footage, Adrian Klein appeared as the final interviewer.

When he delivered that flawless English speech, the comment section exploded.

"Holy crap! That accent is perfection!"

"Favoritism? More like trial by fire!"

"First time seeing someone get tested during an interview. Savage!"

The whiteboard he prepared sent another wave of astonishment.

The comment section went wild.

"Professor Klein is ridiculously hot!"

"Totally shatters my stereotype of researchers!"

"Those wire-rim glasses are lethal! Total ice prince!"

A few skeptical voices remained.

"Fake video!"

"Obvious damage control!"

But they were swiftly drowned out.

"You think we're idiots?"

"Questioning an official release?"

"Trolls get out!"

Sophia Laurent monitored the online reactions closely.

Seeing the shift, she immediately texted Evelyn.

Evelyn was pruning plants on her balcony.

Hearing the notification, she removed her gloves and washed her hands before checking the message.

A familiar voice came through the video.

This was her first time watching her own interview from an outsider's perspective.

Yet her gaze kept drifting to Adrian.

From his focused questioning, to the restrained offer letting her quit, to that faint final smile.

Every detail exuded professionalism and grace.

"Evie, check the comments!" Sophia followed up.

Evelyn scrolled through remarks completely different from yesterday's vitriol.

Now filled with memes and lighthearted jokes.

Some even analyzed her outfit choices.

The abrupt change left her momentarily stunned.

As she set her phone down, it rang.

"Ethan Winston" flashed on the screen.

After a brief hesitation, she answered.

"I saw what happened online. Are you okay?"

"It's handled," Evelyn replied softly.

"Harvard acted surprisingly fast." Ethan sounded rueful. "I didn't even get to help."

"Did you need something, Mr. Winston?"

"Must we be so formal?" His bitter chuckle carried through. "Ethan is fine."

"You're too kind."

Silence stretched across the line.
###Chapter 172

"One day, you'll willingly call me Ethan." Ethan Winston's voice carried a hint of resignation.

Evelyn Langley tightened her grip on the phone, her tone icy. "Oh, we'll see. If there's nothing else, Mr. Winston, I'll hang up now."

"Wait—" His voice turned serious. "There's news about the Maldives incident."

Her fingers stiffened, spine straightening instantly. "What did you find?"

"Let's discuss it in person. Some documents need to be handed to you directly."

She glanced at her watch and agreed to meet the next afternoon at three.

The following day, at an upscale restaurant.

Ethan slid a manila envelope across the table. "The legal team compiled this. Take a look."

"This cross-border case has been under investigation since last year. The hotel provided full surveillance footage."

"Combined with an unexpected eyewitness, we finally pieced together the truth."

His fingers tapped the table, gaze meaningful. "You're the victim. The next steps are yours to decide."

Evelyn slowly opened the file.

Inside were detailed records—how Chloe Valentine had bribed a diving instructor to tamper with the oxygen tank, along with the entire scheme behind the venomous snake gift box. Photos, videos, and witness statements were all included.

She expected rage but felt only eerie calm.

"File a police report," she said firmly, closing the file.

Ethan raised a brow. "Not informing Nathan Evans?"

"Unnecessary." Her eyes were clear. "We're over. This is about protecting my rights."

"My parents didn’t raise me to be someone’s punching bag."

Ethan gave a meaningful look. "The outcome might disappoint you."

By the time she left the police station, night had fallen.

Though the case was officially filed, the seasoned detective hinted that cross-border evidence was tricky, and the proof might not hold. The case could easily be dismissed.

Meanwhile, Chloe stood under the spotlight in the university auditorium.

Dressed in an elegant gown, microphone in hand, she basked in the crowd's adoration.

Then, a siren pierced the silence.
###Chapter 173

Adrian Klein chuckled along.

Dylan Lowell squinted through his cigarette smoke. "Ethan, your birthday's next month, right? Any big plans this year?"

Julian Roscente lounged on the sofa with lazy grace. "Last year's racetrack party was wild. Time for something different?"

Ethan Winston's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against his crystal glass.

The refracted light danced across his sharp features.

"Just a small gathering this year."

Dylan choked on his smoke. "What?"

Julian nearly slid off the couch. "You're serious?"

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Problem?"

"Since when do you do low-key?" Dylan leaned in for closer inspection. "Wait—did you meet some girl and suddenly decide to play nice?"

Julian perked up. "Unless you mean one of those... private pool parties?"

Ethan set down his glass. "My estate on Fifth Avenue. Invitations coming soon."

As he walked away, Dylan and Julian exchanged bewildered glances.

Sunlight streamed through the windows.

Both men instinctively looked up at the cloudless sky.

......

Evelyn Langley was organizing design drafts when the call came.

"A birthday party?" Her brow furrowed slightly.

Ethan's voice carried through the receiver. "Just a few friends."

Her fingers absently traced the edges of her sketches.

She didn't want to see Nathan Evans.

"Dylan will be there." Ethan paused deliberately. "Unless... you're avoiding someone?"

Evelyn's hand stilled.

"That's over."

Ethan's quiet laugh vibrated through the line. "All the more reason to come. Address sent."

The call ended with decisive finality.

......

The estate blazed with light on the evening of the party.

Nathan entered arm-in-arm with Chloe Valentine.

She helped remove his coat, her fingers brushing his shoulder with practiced casualness.

"Happy birthday."

Nathan tossed Ethan a set of keys.

Ethan caught them with a smirk. "Thanks."

As Nathan started to speak, movement at the periphery of his vision froze the words in his throat.
###Chapter 174

"Nathan, I did all this because I love you too much." Chloe Valentine's eyes reddened, her voice trembling. "I just wanted to be with you forever. Can you forgive me this once?"

Nathan Evans' icy expression remained unmoved, his gaze frosty. "Do you realize this is a crime?"

"Don't use love as an excuse." His voice cut like a blade. "Hurting the person I care about most—is this your idea of love?"

"We're done." He turned to leave. "Don't ever show your face again."

Chloe desperately grabbed his sleeve, only to be violently shaken off.

"Out of gratitude for saving my life, I'll let this slide." Nathan's piercing glare bore into her. "There won't be a next time."

His black sports car vanished in a cloud of dust.

A sharp pain suddenly twisted through Chloe's abdomen. Her irregular cycle had been delayed for over twenty days.

The blood staining her pants forced her to rush to the hospital.

"Congratulations, you're pregnant." The doctor handed her the test results. "Early pregnancy bleeding requires bed rest."

Chloe stared blankly at the report.

It must have happened that New Year's Eve.

Her dull eyes suddenly ignited with hope.

This was her last chance to win Nathan back.

The villa's front door swung open.

Nathan was in his study, smashing objects in a rage.

"Get out!" he roared without looking up.

When he recognized the intruder, his expression darkened. "You dare come here?"

Summoning her courage, Chloe pulled the test results from her bag. "I'm pregnant. It's yours."

Nathan let out a cold laugh. "Get rid of it."

"What?" She froze as if struck by lightning.

A black card landed at her feet.

"Three million. Enough?" He looked down at her with disdain. "We're even."
###Chapter 175

Chloe Valentine trembled uncontrollably. Nathan Evans' icy gaze cut through her heart like a knife.

She never expected him to be so ruthless, leaving her not even a sliver of hope.

"Nathan, I know I was wrong." She shakily held up the ultrasound report. "Look, the baby already has a heartbeat. How can you abandon them?"

Nathan glanced at the blurry ultrasound image, his lips curling into a mocking smirk.

"Get rid of it."

"Better not to bring a fatherless child into this world."

Besides, he didn’t even believe the child was his.

As he turned to leave, Chloe desperately grabbed his sleeve.

"Are you sentencing me to death over one mistake?" Her voice was hoarse. "I only did it because I loved you too much!"

Nathan shook her off without a word and strode upstairs.

Chloe stared at his retreating figure, her nails digging deep into her palms.

This was all Evelyn Langley’s fault!

If that woman hadn’t clung to Nathan like a ghost, she wouldn’t have resorted to such measures.

A ruthless glint flashed in her eyes.

Fine. If this was how it had to be, she wouldn’t hold back anymore.

On Saturday morning, Evelyn received a call from the police.

"We’re sorry, but the evidence is insufficient..."

She hung up calmly, unsurprised by the outcome.

A notification popped up on her phone—a trending post on the campus forum.

Beneath a secretly taken profile photo of her, the comments section was in chaos.

"New campus queen!"

"Someone get me her number!"

Evelyn sighed and closed the tab, returning to her thesis edits.

The doorbell rang.

Assuming it was her food delivery, she opened the door—only to meet Nathan’s bloodshot eyes.

She immediately tried to shut the door, but he blocked it with his arm.

"Evelyn, I’ve uncovered everything about the Maldives incident." His voice was rough. "Chloe set me up on purpose."

"I’ve cut ties with her completely."

He reached out as if to touch her face but froze mid-air.

"Give me another chance. Please."

Evelyn’s heart ached at the sight of his haggard face.

The once proud and untouchable man now stood before her like a remorseful child.
###Chapter 176

The doorknob was icy to the touch.

Evelyn's fingers gripped it tightly, her knuckles turning white.

"I refuse." Her voice was soft but sharp as a blade.

Nathan's pupils constricted abruptly.

"Why?!" He slammed his palm against the doorframe, his own knuckles paling. "I've already taken care of the Chloe situation. What more do you want from me?"

His breathing was ragged, like a caged beast.

Evelyn met his gaze.

"Before," she paused, "I thought you were my entire world."

A spark of hope flickered in Nathan's eyes.

"Not anymore." Her tone was calm. "My world is vast enough to hold many things now."

The man's expression twisted instantly.

"Like what? Your studies?" He sneered. "What good will a master's degree do? You'll still end up working for money. Just name your price—I'll give it to you directly!"

Evelyn frowned.

"You took that $50 million check without hesitation. Now you're playing hard to get?" Nathan's voice rose with agitation. "Or was this your plan all along—"

Bang!

The door slammed shut with such force the hallway lights trembled.

Nathan staggered back, driving his fist into the wall.

......

The April breeze carried the scent of blossoms.

Evelyn stood at Professor Eleanor's doorstep, clutching a folder of documents.

The petite professor, vibrant as ever, immediately thrust a towering stack of papers into her arms.

"Take these!" Eleanor's eyes gleamed. "They're treasures!"

Evelyn opened the topmost file.

The pages were yellowed, their edges curled with age.

"This..."

"Your senior 'borrowed' these from the library's rare collection." The old woman winked mischievously. "Almost got chased down by the librarian."

Evelyn burst into laughter.

As her fingers traced the densely packed notes, her heart softened unexpectedly.

So this was what it felt like—to have her dreams cherished by others.
###Chapter 177

"Take these materials home and study them carefully." Professor Eleanor Roland handed a thick stack of files to Evelyn Langley. "You should have a basic grasp of the research direction before starting in September."

Evelyn accepted the documents, her fingers tightening slightly. "Don't worry, Professor. I'll master them as soon as possible. I won't hold the team back."

Eleanor couldn't help but smile at her earnest expression. "When have I ever doubted your abilities?"

"After watching your interview video, I finally feel at ease." She patted Evelyn's shoulder gently. "All these years, I worried you might struggle to keep up with today's research pace."

"But you've surprised me."

Especially during Adrian Klein's questioning—the depth of her thinking surpassed even many third-year graduate students.

"Remember, you're my student." Eleanor's gaze was firm. "No one understands your talent and potential better than I do."

......

Their conversation was interrupted by a phone call. The professor hurried away, leaving Evelyn alone with the materials.

Walking along the tree-lined campus path, Evelyn's thoughts drifted. These years hadn't been smooth sailing—she'd faced self-doubt, fearing she might disappoint her mentor's expectations.

Especially after learning Professor Roland's long-researched project still lacked breakthroughs, she worried her participation might prove futile...

Flipping through the documents, Evelyn was surprised to find the papers neatly arranged by year.

The oldest literature dated back to the 1940s, when biology first emerged as an independent discipline.

Previously, she'd only understood the history of biology as a reader. Now, she was about to become a participant in that history.

This shift in identity stirred her emotions deeply.

Evelyn became completely absorbed in the documents until her phone rang abruptly.

"Are you Sophia Laurent's family?" A hurried female voice came through. "This is Massachusetts General Hospital. She's been in a car accident. Please come immediately."

Evelyn's fingers jerked violently, her heart nearly stopping.

Hanging up, she frantically grabbed her wallet and jacket. Before leaving, she turned back to stuff several bank cards into her bag.

The elevator took too long, so she rushed for the stairs.

Just as she reached the apartment complex entrance, a taxi happened to pull up.

"Massachusetts General Hospital, please hurry!" Her voice trembled noticeably.

The driver, a gray-templed man, glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "Don't worry, miss. Thirty years behind the wheel—I'll get you there fast and safe."

Evelyn clutched her phone tightly, redialing Sophia's number.

Still switched off.

The car radio suddenly cut in with breaking news: "At 1:30 PM, a major accident occurred on West Street—a bus rear-ended a truck. Currently, ten injured and one fatality reported..."

West Street! That was Sophia's company district!

Tears instantly spilled from Evelyn's eyes.

The driver floored the gas, weaving deftly through traffic. The usual thirty-minute trip took only fifteen.
###Chapter 178

The ambulance's piercing siren tore through the night sky.

Evelyn Langley had just stepped out of the taxi when the sound made her entire body shudder.

"Hurry! Second batch of casualties from the West Avenue crash—straight to the ER!"

The bloodied figure on the stretcher made her breath catch. Instinctively, she quickened her pace and rushed into the hospital lobby.

"Which room is Sophia Laurent in?"

The nurse looked up at her, hesitating before speaking.

"Are you family?"

"Yes. I came as soon as I got the call."

The nurse sighed. "Go take a look inside."

Evelyn's fingers turned ice-cold.

She bit her lip hard and pushed open the heavy door.

The human-shaped outline beneath the white sheet made her legs go weak.

"Evelyn?"

A familiar voice came from behind.

She whirled around.

Sophia stood there, tilting her head, a band-aid on her cheek.

"You—" Evelyn's voice trembled.

"Why did the family member come in here?" A nurse poked her head in. "Your friend is in the observation room next door."

Only then did Evelyn notice the nameplate by the bed.

It wasn't Sophia at all.

"I was standing right behind you." Sophia blinked. "How could you mistake someone else for me?"

On the bench in the hallway.

Sophia nudged her gently with a shoulder. "Are you really mad?"

Evelyn turned her face away.

"Okay, I'm sorry." Sophia leaned closer. "See? I'm perfectly fine."

She pointed at the band-aid on her cheek. "Just a scratch. Didn't even need stitches."

Evelyn finally looked at her. "What actually happened?"

"Was heading out for barbecue after work when I got caught in a pileup on West Avenue." Sophia shrugged. "Got nicked by some flying glass and took a nasty fall."

She made it sound trivial, but Evelyn noticed her hands shaking slightly.

"The injured on the ambulance..." Sophia's voice dropped. "One was lying right next to me."

Evelyn grabbed her hand.

Her cold fingers gradually warmed.

"I've always had good luck." Sophia suddenly grinned. "But you—were you about to cry earlier?"

Evelyn glared. "Who told you to play dead!"

"I wasn't playing!" Sophia blinked innocently. "You charged in without looking properly."

She leaned close to Evelyn's ear. "But... thanks for worrying about me so much."

A night breeze drifted in from the window at the end of the corridor.

In the antiseptic-scented air, two shadows pressed close together.
###Chapter 179

"Fine, you win. Happy now?" Sophia Laurent scoffed.

"Hospital policy requires notifying family members for car accident patients. I didn’t want to worry my parents, so I put your number down." She waved her shattered phone. "If my phone hadn’t broken, you wouldn’t have had to come all this way for nothing."

Evelyn Langley finally understood why her calls kept going unanswered.

"Are you badly hurt?"

"All tests are done. I’m fine." Sophia grabbed her bag. "Just need to finish the paperwork, then we can leave."

As they reached the lobby, they collided with Margaret Evans and Chloe Valentine.

Margaret was clinging to Chloe’s arm, chatting and laughing intimately.

"No wonder the mistress is so brazen—she’s got her future mother-in-law backing her." Sophia sneered.

Margaret froze at the sight of Evelyn. After six months, the woman wasn’t haggard at all—she looked radiant.

Chloe’s steps faltered. Her hand drifted to her flat stomach.

"Evelyn, what a coincidence." Her voice was saccharine. "I just found out I’m pregnant. Nathan was overjoyed."

Evelyn turned away without expression.

"It’s still early, but once the bump shows, things will get complicated..." Chloe continued, as if to herself.

"Congratulations." Evelyn’s tone was icy. "But I don’t need to know."

"I just wanted to share the good news—"

"Share my ass!" Sophia exploded. "You’re proud of being a homewrecker? Even pigs can breed—what’s there to flaunt?"

"Instead of strutting around, focus on making Nathan marry you! You’ve already botched your pathetic hand—how dare you show your face here!"

Chloe’s eyes welled up instantly. "How can you say such things..."

Margaret stepped protectively in front of her. "Miss Laurent, mind your language!"

Sophia smirked. "Apologies. I’ve never been polite to shameless people."

Margaret’s face darkened with rage, but she didn’t retaliate.
###Chapter 180

Chloe Valentine's nails dug deep into her palms.

She glared at Sophia Laurent with burning hatred. If looks could kill, Sophia would have been shredded to pieces.

"Miss Laurent..." Chloe's voice trembled, her eyes reddening. "There must be some misunderstanding."

Sophia scoffed. "Misunderstanding? You're not worth my time to misunderstand."

Margaret Evans slammed the table. "Sophia Laurent! Mind your manners!"

"Manners?" Sophia arched an eyebrow. "Mrs. Evans, you can't even control your own son, yet you lecture me?"

Evelyn Langley gently touched her friend's wrist.

"Enough," she said coolly. "This is a waste of time."

The words ignited Margaret's fury.

"Who do you think you are?" she shrieked. "A barren woman has no right to act superior!"

Other diners turned to stare.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Mrs. Evans, your son means as much to me as this cold coffee." She lifted the cup. "Stale and flavorless."

Chloe suddenly grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

"Evelyn," she whimpered, tears welling. "Thank you for stepping aside. Nathan and I—"

"Let go," Evelyn commanded icily.

Sophia yanked Chloe away. "Cut the act. Should we build you a stage?"

She pulled Evelyn toward the exit, deliberately raising her voice:

"Did someone binge too many period dramas? All this fake sisterly affection makes me sick!"

"Is Nathan Evans blind? Trading a pearl for a worthless pebble!"

Margaret trembled with rage. "You vile creature!"

Chloe turned deathly pale.

Whispers spread through the restaurant:

"That Karen's overdramatic..."

"Who still acts like a toxic mother-in-law in 2023?"

The glass door slammed shut, sealing the chaos inside.
###Chapter 181

She had always disdained such clingy behavior, believing only desperate people would stoop so low.

Yet now, she was no different.

Clearly, rage had clouded her judgment.

"Sharp-tongued and arrogant—birds of a feather, all ill-mannered trash!"

Sophia Laurent sneered at the insult. She could tolerate attacks on herself, but dragging Evelyn Langley into it? Absolutely not.

"Shut your foul mouth, you old witch!"

"Did I lie? Six years with my son and not a single pregnancy—clearly a barren hen. Why so defensive? Are you defective too?"

Sophia scoffed. "Six years without results, and you never considered your son might be the problem? Constantly hospitalized, drowning in alcohol and cigarettes—maybe get him checked. Just in case..."

Her gaze slid meaningfully to Chloe Valentine's stomach.

Chloe paled, hastily defending, "I've only ever been with Nathan. I'd never betray him—"

The moment her son Nathan Evans was implicated, Margaret exploded. "Keep slandering him, and I'll rip your mouth apart—"

Unfazed, Sophia rolled up her sleeves. "Try it. Let's see who tears who first!"

Evelyn quickly pulled Sophia back.

Chloe gaped, stunned by the sudden escalation.

Seizing the moment as Evelyn stepped closer, she suddenly gasped—

And collapsed onto the floor.

"My stomach! It hurts!"

Margaret immediately panicked, abandoning the argument to fuss over Chloe.

"Chloe! Are you okay? Should we go to the hospital?"

Chloe sniffled dramatically. "I'll be fine... I just don’t understand why Evelyn pushed me..."

Margaret glared at Evelyn. "Jealous because you can't conceive? How vile!"

Evelyn: "?" These two were clearly unhinged.

She'd seen Chloe's fake fall perfectly—one hand cradling her stomach, the other bracing her landing.

The acting was laughably bad. Even the pained expression was unconvincing.

Evelyn looked down at her coolly. "Since you accused me of pushing you, wouldn’t it be unfair if I didn’t actually do it?"

She raised a hand as if to shove—

Chloe scrambled backward. Seeing Evelyn wasn’t bluffing, she instantly caved.

"It was my fault... Evelyn didn’t do anything..."

Margaret still fretted. "Are you sure? We should get you checked."

That was the Evans family's heir!

Chloe shook her head. "Really, I'm fine. Let’s just go home, Aunt Margaret."

She wouldn’t risk her precious bargaining chip.

This was just to mess with Evelyn.

Margaret huffed. "Only for my grandson’s sake. Let’s go, Chloe."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Pathetic performance. Reeks of desperation."

"You shouldn’t have stopped me," she muttered, cracking her knuckles. She hadn’t even gotten started.

Watching Chloe’s hasty retreat, Evelyn chuckled. "Relax. They’re not worth it."
###Chapter 182

"They're just two nobodies. Not worth getting upset over."

Sophia Laurent arched an eyebrow. "True! But if there's a next time, they'll taste my fists."

Since Evelyn was too soft-hearted, she'd gladly play the villain.

"Alright, alright—" Evelyn linked arms with her. "You had a scare today. My treat—what do you want to eat?"

Sophia slung an arm around her neck. "Been waiting for you to say that! Let's go, I'm treating you to something good."

"Wait—shouldn't that be my line?"

"Same difference. You're paying anyway."

......

In the backseat of the luxury sedan, Margaret Evans traced the ultrasound report, lips curving at the doctor's words: "The fetus is developing well."

Chloe Valentine stole a glance at her expression and exhaled silently.

This was her first meeting with Nathan's mother.

Throughout their relationship, Nathan never spoke of his family. She only knew he came from wealth and had a younger sister.

After being unilaterally dumped, Chloe exhausted every means to reach him—all messages vanished without a trace.

Desperate, she obtained Margaret's number through connections and directly announced her pregnancy.

So far, the future mother-in-law seemed... moderately pleased.

Chloe retrieved an exquisitely wrapped gift from her bag, offering a demure smile. "Auntie, a small token of my regard. I hope you like it."

Margaret mused that this girl had more tact than that Evelyn. "Did you pick it yourself? How thoughtful—"

Her words died as the box opened.

Nestled in blue velvet lay a clumsily hand-knitted scarf—uneven stitches, loose threads, frayed ends.

"You... made this yourself?"

Chloe nodded eagerly. "Two whole weeks of work! Do you like it?"

"......"

Margaret snapped the lid shut, barely masking her distaste.

An eyesore!

Even Evelyn's worst gift was a designer silk scarf. This looked like something salvaged from a thrift store.

She had access to Nathan's supplementary card, yet offered this shoddy scrap?

"Auntie... don't you like it?" Chloe's voice trembled. "I thought handmade gifts show sincerity."

She'd pulled all-nighters knitting it for this first meeting.

Margaret forced a smile, resting a hand on her still-flat stomach. "Of course. Handmade treasures are priceless."

Chloe beamed. "Then I'll make you one every year!"

Margaret: "......"

God forbid.
###Chapter 183

The car came to a gentle stop outside the school gates.

Margaret Evans rolled down the window and waved at Chloe Valentine. "Remember to eat on time. Don't skip meals."

"Understood, Mrs. Evans." Chloe nodded obediently.

As the window rose, Margaret's smile vanished instantly.

"Let's go," she ordered the driver coldly.

In the rearview mirror, Chloe's figure grew smaller and smaller.

Margaret glanced down at the gift box on the seat, her brows furrowed.

She lifted the lid. The rose-red scarf inside made her eyes sting.

"What terrible taste..." she muttered disdainfully, tossing the box under the seat.

She wiped her fingers on the leather upholstery as if they'd touched something filthy.

Chloe's plain face flashed through her mind again.

So provincial.

Too timid to even laugh properly.

Margaret massaged her temples.

Her gaze caught the scarf again.

Cheap yarn. Crooked stitches.

How dare someone give her such trash?

Suddenly she remembered the Hermès scarf Evelyn Langley had gifted her.

Exquisite patterns. Luxuriously soft.

Now that was worthy of her status.

"Disgusting!" Margaret slammed her palm against the seat.

Why was she thinking about that jinx?

......

"Madam is home."

Isabella Evans jumped up from the couch, eyes locking onto the gift box in her mother's hands.

"Mom, what's that?"

She tore open the packaging eagerly.

"Oh my God!" She shrieked, flinging the scarf away. "What is this monstrosity?"

The rose-red yarn twisted in tangled knots.

The stitching zigzagged haphazardly.

"From your brother's girlfriend." Margaret sneered. "Supposedly handmade."

Isabella picked up the scarf between two fingers, face scrunched in disgust. "Our dog's bed looks better than this."

"If she weren't pregnant..." Margaret ground her teeth.

"Pregnant?!" Isabella's voice shot up an octave. "Chloe's carrying my brother's baby?"

Her eyes widened.

Evelyn had been with Nathan for years without conceiving.

This Chloe must have some skills.

"She called me today with the news." Margaret rubbed her forehead.

Isabella suddenly smirked. "Don't you think it's odd, Mom?"

"What?"

"Why would my brother's girlfriend tell you instead of him?"

Margaret froze.

"Probably because Nathan doesn't want the baby." Isabella said meaningfully. "She's trying to use you as leverage."

She'd seen this game played countless times in wealthy circles.

Every social climber had their tricks.
###Chapter 184

Isabella Evans narrowed her eyes. "Mom, you're not seriously considering letting that Chloe Valentine into our family, are you?"

Margaret Evans scoffed. "In her dreams! We don't even know if she's carrying a boy or girl. Did you see how provincial she looked today? Not even a decent handbag. And she graduated from some third-rate polytechnic institute..."

In Margaret's eyes, her son Nathan was heaven's chosen one.

His future wife should at least be an Ivy League graduate with a master's degree minimum.

Someone like Chloe? If not for the baby in her womb, Margaret wouldn't have bothered meeting her at all.

Marry into the Evans family?

Try next lifetime!

Isabella smirked, completely unsurprised by this answer.

She casually tossed the cheap scarf into the trash bin and meticulously wiped her fingers with disinfectant wipes.

"Better not let her set foot in our home. She's not even on Evelyn Langley's level."

Just an empty title of campus belle—no family background, no proper education.

Who knew what her brother saw in her.

"Ugh, I'm going out!"

Isabella picked up the carefully prepared gift box containing imported cherries and premium supplements.

She was paying a visit to Professor Eleanor Roland.

Last time she'd been turned away, but this time she'd seize the opportunity.

Margaret followed her to the door. "Be careful on the road..."

The car stopped in front of Eleanor's residence. Isabella's palms were damp with sweat.

Taking a deep breath, she stepped out with the gifts.

This time she'd chosen understated yet luxurious packaging—showing sincerity without appearing try-hard.

She'd practiced her smile in the mirror for a full week preparing for this meeting.

But as she entered the garden, a familiar figure pruning flowers made her freeze.

"Evelyn Langley?!"

Eleanor was an avid horticulturist, her front yard filled with rare blooms.

With the professor busy at academic conferences recently, she'd specially asked Evelyn to tend the garden.

No one else would do.

Not only was Evelyn meticulous, she was also an expert gardener.

Eleanor had even entrusted her with a house key.

Isabella stared at Evelyn's dirt-stained gloves, her face darkening instantly.

Now she understood how Evelyn had scored so high during the interview.

"Hmph, I never knew you were so good at sucking up to professors," Isabella sneered shrilly. "Must feel great getting the spot through such cheap tricks?"

She despised social climbers like this more than anything.
###Chapter 185

Evelyn's eyes turned icy.

"The interview footage is public. File a formal appeal if you question the scores."

Her fingers tapped the desk lightly.

"Spreading rumors costs nothing—like whoever took those photos of me with Professor Adrian."

Her gaze sharpened like a blade, piercing Isabella's pupils.

Isabella's lashes fluttered, visibly shrinking at the word "photos."

A cold smirk curled Evelyn's lips.

Just as suspected.

"Every accusation you throw at me reeks of sour grapes."

Isabella's face flushed crimson before she jutted her chin out.

"Chloe's carrying my brother's baby. Bet you didn't know."

"Knew six hours before you did."

Evelyn checked her wristwatch.

Isabella's nails dug into her palms.

"Professor Eleanor isn't available. Leave."

The words ignited Isabella like a spark in oil. She slammed the table.

"Who do you think you are? I'm going in!"

"If her word isn't enough, how about mine?"

Professor Eleanor's voice cut through the hallway, her glasses glinting coldly.

Isabella froze.

"I remember you."

Eleanor approached with measured steps.

"You submitted materials here before."

As Isabella opened her mouth—

"Was my last rejection not clear enough?"

A folder snapped shut with finality.

"My students earn their place through merit."

She pointed to the door.

"Now. Immediately."

......

A ginkgo leaf spiraled to the pavement by Isabella's feet.

She clenched her purse strap.

Why did Evelyn get special treatment?

A pebble skittered away under her kick.

"Miss Evans?"

A crisp elderly voice spoke.

Silver hair framed by emerald cheongsam.

"Fourth in the interviews?"

Beatrice smoothed her collar.

"My research team has one opening left."

Fine wrinkles crinkled at her smiling eyes.

"Care to join?"
###Chapter 186

"Is this really happening?" Isabella's eyes sparkled with excitement, her voice trembling slightly.

Professor Beatrice gave an elegant nod. "Of course."

"I'd love to!" Isabella blurted out eagerly. "Being your student has always been my dream."

She seemed to have completely forgotten she'd just left Professor Eleanor's residence.

"Very well. Your name is..."

"Professor Merouin, I'm Isabella Evans, a biology major at Harvard." Isabella quickly supplied.

"A Harvard student?" The professor's lips curved in approval. "Your foundation must be solid. Report to Zone C when semester starts. I'll introduce you to the senior researchers."

Senior researchers?

Isabella's pulse quickened. Professor Merouin led national-level research projects. If she could join...

This was an elite team even Evelyn might not qualify for!

Her smile grew sweeter.

Professor Merouin approved of her enthusiasm.

Glancing toward Professor Eleanor's house, a cold glint flashed in her eyes.

For years, departmental resources had favored Eleanor Roland. Why?

Just because that old woman had seniority?

Three years without progress on her research topic. Mediocre graduate students.

This year she'd accepted three underqualified candidates, including one who took multiple attempts to pass the entrance exam.

Clearly losing her edge.

Not like her own carefully vetted selection.

Isabella came from wealth—future research funding wouldn't be an issue.

This time, let's see how Eleanor Roland competes!

...

Meanwhile, the so-called "underqualified candidate" Evelyn Langley was gathering gardening tools.

"Weeds cleared, dead branches pruned, all plants watered." She gave detailed instructions. "It's getting colder—wait a few days before watering again."

Professor Eleanor sighed. "I'm your advisor, not an elderly patient needing care."

Evelyn pulled on her down jacket and linked arms with the professor. "Last time you forgot to water... The baby bok choy is washed and ready in the kitchen. The housekeeper can stir-fry it directly."

The older woman endured her fussing with indulgent eyes.

"It's already dark," the professor pretended to scowl. "Now you're more long-winded than me."

Evelyn laughingly tightened the professor's shawl. "Leaving now. I'll visit again soon."

"Travel safely." Professor Eleanor stood at the doorway watching.

Only when the young woman disappeared into the night did the elderly professor's straight posture gradually slump, her smile slowly freezing into something else entirely.
###Chapter 187

Prof. Eleanor Roland had just received the notice from the finance department. This year's graduate research funding allocation was finalized. Prof. Beatrice Merouin's team took seventy percent, leaving the remaining thirty to be divided among other research groups.

She quickly calculated. After deducting equipment maintenance and basic expenses, less than twenty percent would actually be available for experiments.

Five years without significant publications. Their funding shrank annually. Students left one by one, leaving only a few familiar faces still holding on.

The lab lights cast shadows on Eleanor's exhausted face. She massaged her temples.

"Professor Roland, what a coincidence."

Beatrice approached in clicking heels, waving the newly approved funding application.

"I heard your team is replicating decade-old experiments? Funding that tight?" She feigned surprise, eyebrows arched.

Eleanor silently organized her files.

"Some research should've been retired years ago." Beatrice shook her documents. "Unlike us—we just secured another national key project."

"Research isn't about who has more money." Eleanor finally spoke. "Ten years ago, we achieved double the results with one-tenth your budget."

Beatrice's smile faltered. "Ancient history. Today's game is output efficiency. Dragging things out harms both the department and students."

"Every student I mentor gains real expertise." Eleanor met her gaze calmly. "Unlike some who treat them as cheap labor."

"You—!" Beatrice's face darkened. "Just wait until next semester's review. Let's see if your lab survives!"

Eleanor shook her head slightly and walked away. Some would never understand—true scholarship couldn't be bought with funding.

......

April sunlight streamed through the window onto the desk.

Evelyn Langley closed her laptop and stretched. The graduate admission letter hung on her wall, but she couldn't relax yet.

Library. Apartment. Grocery store. Her routine was simple yet fulfilling. Occasionally cooking a proper meal became her greatest pleasure.

Once, she invited Adrian Klein to try a new recipe when he stopped by for clothes. But he only took two hurried bites before rushing back to the lab.

These days were uncomplicated yet grounding. No more cooking anxiously for someone else's approval. No more waiting with bated breath. Daily video calls with her parents in the neighboring city became her new ritual.

On screen, William Langley proudly displayed freshly picked tomatoes: "See? Organic!"

"Your father's turned into a full-time retiree farmer." Victoria didn't look up from her sketchpad. "Yesterday he wanted chickens."

"Reconnecting with nature!" William's voice carried from the yard.

Victoria was drafting new work, though her publisher had rejected another proposal. Hearing her mother secretly rereading early novels at night made Evelyn's heart ache.

Ending the call, Evelyn watched the sunset. Life brought losses and gains. What mattered was—she'd finally rediscovered herself.
###Chapter 188

Everything had to remain on hold until the contract expired.

......

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Langley packed her bag for the library.

She barely stepped out of her apartment building when she nearly collided with Adrian Klein, who looked like he'd been traveling all night.

Dark circles shadowed his eyes—another all-nighter.

"Good morning, Professor Klein." She smiled brightly.

"Just call me Adrian outside class." He rubbed his temples. "I wanted to ask you something."

"The discontinued research project?"

Of course she remembered. Its focus aligned perfectly with her current work.

More importantly—

Abandoning such promising research was a criminal waste.

"Have you decided? Will you continue?"

"I'd love to..." She bit her lip. "But I don't have lab access for experimental data..."

Conclusions without data were castles in the air.

Adrian adjusted his glasses. "You can use my lab."

"Free of charge," he added.

Though newly established, his lab boasted cutting-edge international equipment.

"Seriously?" Her eyes rounded.

This was salvation when she needed it most.

"Do I look like I'm joking?"

She hesitated only a second before nodding eagerly—

"Perfect! Thank you!"

A faint smile touched Adrian's lips, his gaze softening behind his lenses.

The lab occupied the top floor of Diligence Hall.

At Harvard, entire floors dedicated to single labs were rare privileges.

Adrian's lab operated through corporate partnerships with independent funding.

The university provided space in exchange for academic credits.

This win-win model gave him absolute authority.

Countless professors coveted access, offering exorbitant sums—all firmly rejected.

Yet he'd opened these doors to Evelyn.

Unaware of this extraordinary honor, she simply thought—

Professor Klein was a saint!

......

On her first day, Evelyn arrived ten minutes early.

Adrian personally unlocked the door.

"Morning."

"You're here before me." She noticed his fresh shirt change.

The lab included a lounge and shower facilities.

Even after all-nighters, he maintained impeccable neatness.

"Brought you breakfast."

The insulated bag held steaming crab roe buns and freshly ground soy milk.
###Chapter 189

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains. Evelyn Langley stood at the laboratory entrance holding two steaming breakfast bags. She had taken a detour to buy soy milk and buns from the breakfast shop Adrian Klein frequented.

The metal door slid open. Adrian emerged wearing a lab coat, his sleeves rolled up to reveal well-defined forearms.

"Morning." Evelyn handed him the food. "Hope it's to your taste."

Adrian accepted the paper bag, warmth from the soy milk cup seeping into his palms. "Thanks. Perfect timing—I skipped breakfast."

They entered the lab side by side. The sterile scent of disinfectant mingled with the hum of operating equipment.

"First, fingerprint registration." Adrian guided her to the security system. "You'll have 24/7 access now."

Evelyn pressed her thumb against the scanner. Blue light swept across her fingertip.

"The lab never closes." Adrian input his authorization code. "Come whenever it suits your schedule."

She nodded. Between preparing her thesis proposal and reviewing Professor Eleanor Roland's research materials, her time was stretched thin.

"This is the main lab." Adrian pushed open a glass door. "I've prepared a safety checklist."

Evelyn pulled out her notebook, meticulously recording each protocol. Glassware on the test tube racks refracted splintered light under the lamps.

"We currently have four team members—"

Before he could finish, a burly figure emerged from the breakroom. The man held a thermos where goji berries bobbed in hot water.

"Adrian, who's this?" Vincent Macmillan adjusted his glasses, his gaze settling warmly on Evelyn.

"Evelyn Langley, a friend." Adrian kept the introduction brief. "Professor Macmillan, from the Basic Physics Department."

Evelyn gave a slight bow. "Pleasure to meet you, Professor."

Vincent waved dismissively. "No need for formalities." He glanced at the wall clock. "The others should arrive soon."

By nine o'clock, the lab buzzed with activity. Natalie Blanchet arrived first, her ponytail swinging as soundless sneakers carried her across the floor.

"New recruit?" She set down her backpack and retrieved a tablet. "Natalie Blanchet, Applied Physics."

Evelyn noticed the tablet's wallpaper featured a young boy wearing a red scarf.

Oliver Lancelot burst in with coffee stains dotting his lab coat hem. "Finally finished processing the data!" Wiping sweat, he spotted Evelyn. "Whoa, fresh blood in our group?"

He reached for Evelyn's bag but froze under Adrian's warning glare.

The click of high heels approached as the glass door opened again.
###Chapter 190

The glass door of the laboratory swung open as a pair of slender legs stepped inside.

The hem of a camel-colored cashmere coat swayed gently with each stride. A white turtleneck sweater accentuated her graceful neck. In her left hand, she carried a Hermès Picotin bag, while her right arm cradled a stack of files.

"Good morning, Professor Klein." Camille Valrose's eyes brightened as she hurried forward to greet him.

Adrian Klein gave a slight nod, his gaze sweeping across the lab. "Is everyone here?"

Oliver Lancelot rubbed his hands together excitedly. "Professor Klein, let me introduce our new member—Evelyn Langley. She's two years younger than Camille."

Only then did Camille notice the quiet girl standing in the corner. Her smile froze.

Before Evelyn's arrival, Camille had been the lab's favorite junior researcher. With a master's from Columbia and currently pursuing her PhD at Harvard, her academic brilliance and sweet demeanor had earned her special treatment from senior lab members.

"Hello." Evelyn extended her hand.

Camille barely touched her fingertips before withdrawing, the tiny diamonds on her nails glinting under the lights.

Natalie Blanchet subtly adjusted her glasses, sensing the tension between them.

"Correction." Adrian's voice cut through the air. "Evelyn isn't joining our research team."

The group froze.

"She has her own research direction. She's just borrowing our lab facilities."

His words dropped like a stone into still water. Oliver's eyes widened, while Vincent Macmillan and Natalie exchanged glances.

Camille's nail left a faint scratch on the lab bench.

Adrian led Evelyn to the innermost workstation. "This will be yours. Write your supply needs on the board—they'll be replenished daily."

Evelyn nodded, noticing her name already added to the board.

"If I may ask," Camille spoke suddenly, "which institute are you doing your postdoc at, Evelyn?"

"I'm starting my master's this September."

The lab fell so silent one could hear a pin drop.

Camille's pupils contracted. An undergraduate? Granted an independent project? And receiving special permission from Professor Klein, who never shared his lab?

She mentally scanned Kyoto's prominent families with the surname Langley but came up empty.

Natalie discreetly tugged her sleeve, signaling her to drop it.

Camille pressed her lips together. She knew better than anyone—Adrian cared only for research. This lab was his private domain, and he granted access as he pleased.

Evelyn had already donned gloves and begun calibrating equipment, so absorbed she didn't notice anyone approaching.

At four in the afternoon, Adrian abruptly closed his laptop. "I'm treating everyone to dinner tonight."

Natalie nearly dropped her test tube. The workaholic professor initiating a social gathering?

Both women instinctively glanced at Evelyn.

"To welcome our new member," Natalie quickly recovered. "Perfect timing—my husband's coming home today anyway."

Vincent smiled. "We wouldn't miss a dinner hosted by Professor Klein."

"I'll pass." Camille snapped her laptop shut. "Still have data to process."

Evelyn looked up to see Camille's flawless makeup failing to mask her stormy expression.
###Chapter 191

The air in the private dining room froze instantly.

Camille Valrose's rejection doused everyone's enthusiasm like a bucket of ice water.

Oliver Lancelot's temples glistened with sweat as he forced a smile. "Camille, I ran simulations on your dataset all night. We'll need at least twelve more hours." His eyes darted toward the man at the head of the table. "Besides, Professor Klein rarely has time to—"

The words flipped an invisible switch.

Camille's knuckles whitened around her napkin. She lifted her gaze across the table where the man's slender fingers idly rotated a crystal glass, his wristbone gleaming under the chandelier.

"...Fine." She finally relented.

Oliver slumped in relief, though disappointment flickered in his eyes.

It was always like this.

Only mentioning Professor Klein could make this ice princess bend.

......

The hidden restaurant nestled deep in an alleyway.

Natalie Blanchet clicked her tongue while perusing the menu. "Their signature Sichuan fish is to die for. They airfreight the chilies directly from the region."

"Order whatever you want, Evelyn." Oliver slid the gilded menu toward Evelyn Langley. "Professor Klein's treating us—a rare opportunity."

Natalie snorted. "Finally telling the truth, Ollie?"

"Natalie!" Oliver clutched his chest dramatically. "You're ruining my image in front of our junior!"

Laughter rippled through the group.

Evelyn sipped her lemon water, the tartness blooming on her tongue.

Only Camille remained glued to her phone, diamond-studded nails tapping impatiently against the screen.

"I ordered the yam soup for you," Oliver whispered, leaning closer. "And that dish you mentioned last time—"

"Enough." Camille snapped her phone shut, then paused at the menu. "...Whatever."

Oliver beamed.

"Ollie's been chasing her for three years," Natalie murmured to Evelyn. "The whole lab sees it except Camille."

Evelyn gave a quiet acknowledgment.

"Speaking of which," Natalie suddenly turned to her, "someone as lovely as you must have an impressive boyfriend."

A glass thudded against marble.

Adrian Klein stood to take a call, leaving behind a faint trace of pine cologne.

"Currently single," Evelyn answered calmly.

Natalie tactfully changed the subject.

Servers began bringing dishes. Crimson chili oil shimmered in porcelain bowls, steam rising to obscure everyone's expressions.
###Chapter 192

Vincent Macmillan's chopsticks lifted a piece of scallion oil chicken, its golden skin glistening with oil. The tender meat melted in his mouth, its savory juices bursting on his tongue. "This tastes absolutely authentic!" he couldn't help exclaiming. "It's been ages since I've had scallion oil chicken this good."

Oliver Lancelot followed suit, nodding as he chewed. "It really is excellent. Camille, would you like to try some?"

"No." Evelyn Langley pushed her bowl away coldly. "I'm watching my weight."

Oliver awkwardly retracted his chopsticks and stuffed the chicken into his own mouth. "Then after you finish dieting, we can come here just the two of us—"

"Who said I'd go anywhere alone with you?" Evelyn rolled her eyes.

Natalie Blanchet glanced at Adrian Klein, who was quietly eating across the table, and casually asked, "Evelyn, how old are you? If you're starting grad school this September, you must be around twenty-two or twenty-three?"

"Twenty-six," Evelyn replied without looking up.

The table fell silent for a beat.

Oliver stole a glance at Adrian, but his expression remained unreadable as he continued eating with measured grace.

Camille Valrose smirked. "Twenty-six and just now getting into grad school? How many times did you take the exam?"

Oliver kicked her under the table, earning a sharp glare in return.

"Once." Evelyn set down her chopsticks. "The entrance exams weren't difficult."

Camille scoffed. "If it were that easy, why didn't you apply right after undergrad? Don't tell me it took you years to finally get in."

"I turned down a combined bachelor-master-doctoral program." Evelyn's voice was calm. "Now I regret it, so I'm reapplying."

Camille looked like she'd heard the most ridiculous joke. "Harvard doesn't offer combined programs outside of medicine! That's exactly why I went abroad for grad school!"

"Just because you didn't know about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist," Evelyn said flatly.

"Professor Macmillan," Camille turned to Vincent, "does Harvard offer any combined bachelor-to-PhD programs besides medicine?"

Vincent wiped his brow. "Well... not to my knowledge."

"See?" Camille lifted her chin triumphantly.

Evelyn gently set down her teacup. "I said combined bachelor-master-doctoral program, not just master-to-PhD."

Vincent's eyes widened suddenly.

Camille sneered. "What's the difference? Your lies just keep getting bigger!"
###Chapter 193

Natalie Blanchet suddenly set down her teacup. "Harvard does offer a combined bachelor-master-doctoral program, but the bar is extremely high. Evelyn, what was your undergraduate major?"

"Bioinformatics."

"From the School of Life Sciences?" Natalie turned to Oliver Lancelot. "Does this major have a direct PhD track?"

All eyes locked onto Oliver. Camille Valrose stared at him with particular intensity.

Oliver put down his chopsticks. "Under normal circumstances, this program doesn't offer direct PhD admission..."

Camille abruptly stood up, sneering at Evelyn Langley. "Now what's your excuse?"

Natalie caught Oliver's phrasing. "'Under normal circumstances' implies there are exceptions?"

Oliver nodded. "The School of Life Sciences reserves one or two special admission slots annually for International Olympiad gold medalists."

"What's a special admission slot?"

"It means gold medalists can negotiate terms with the school—scholarships, guaranteed graduate admission, everything's on the table. Though final approval rests with the faculty."

Natalie's eyes lit up. "So direct PhD admission could be negotiated?"

Oliver: "Theoretically yes, but practically very difficult. In the past twenty years, the school has only approved two direct PhD cases."

"One was Professor Beatrice Merouin's protégé Victor Dimucci. The other was Professor Eleanor Roland's student—rumored to have won four Olympiad golds while also being the national science valedictorian."

"Most incredibly, she declined the special admission and tested in normally. For that caliber of genius, the faculty would fight to make her a professor."

The possibilities narrowed instantly.

Victor was male, which meant Evelyn had to be...

Camille scoffed. "Keep spinning your fairy tales! Four gold medals? National valedictorian? You?"

Evelyn couldn't be bothered to explain.

Adrian Klein spoke suddenly: "She is Professor Roland's student."

The private dining room fell silent.

Oliver's eyes widened. "Seriously?!" He turned to Evelyn. "You're the legendary prodigy everyone talks about?"

Evelyn sighed. "Should I call Professor Roland right now?"

"No need!" Oliver waved his hands rapidly. "I'm just... completely stunned..."

Natalie grabbed Evelyn's hands excitedly. "Tell me, how did you win four gold medals simultaneously? My kid can barely handle one subject."

Evelyn smiled sheepishly. "Just... solve the problems. Get them all right."

Natalie: "..."

That answer was downright infuriating!

Vincent Macmillan suddenly understood. "So you're the 'regret' Professor Roland always mentions! Who'd you pick as advisor this year?"

"Professor Roland."

Vincent burst out laughing. "The old lady must be overjoyed!"

Camille stood frozen, unsure whether to sit or remain standing, her face cycling through shades of pale and flushed.

Oliver smoothly extended an olive branch—
###Chapter 194

"Camille, sit here." Oliver pulled out a chair. "I put all the vegetarian dishes on this side—your favorites."

Evelyn reluctantly took her seat, her expression still hostile.

Oliver turned to Adrian. "Adrian, don't take Camille's bluntness personally."

Adrian gave a faint smile. "It's fine."

"Who asked you to apologize for me?" Camille kicked him hard under the table.

Oliver grimaced in pain but swallowed his groan.

Natalie shot him a sympathetic look.

"About the early admission..." Oliver suddenly asked. "Why did you turn it down?"

Adrian set down her fork. "I wanted to test my own abilities."

Oliver was speechless. That reason was pure audacity.

As misunderstandings cleared, the atmosphere gradually warmed.

Vincent noticed the slight curve of Adrian's lips.

Only then did he realize—Adrian wasn't failing to protect Evelyn. He'd known all along she could handle it.

Camille pushed food around her plate, nails digging into her palms.

Natalie tactfully covered her hand. "Eat first."

Oliver quickly served her more food. "Fish won't make you gain weight. I picked out all the bones."

Night deepened.

Adrian checked his watch. "Let's call it a night."

Oliver hailed a cab. "I'll take Camille home."

Natalie waved. "My husband's picking me up."

Vincent pointed down the street. "I can walk."

A black Volkswagen glided to the curb.

Adrian took the keys and glanced at Evelyn. "Get in."

Evelyn smoothly opened the passenger door.

The taillights disappeared around the corner.

The remaining group exchanged stunned looks.

Vincent rubbed his ear. "Did I hear that right?"

Natalie narrowed her eyes. "Interesting."

Camille's face turned ashen.

Oliver scratched his head. "Since when have they..."
###Chapter 195

The familiar tone made it seem like they'd been inseparable for years.

Perhaps even living under the same roof...

Natalie Blanchet watched the taillights disappear into the distance before slowly turning back. She pinched Oliver Lancelot's arm hard. "Oliver, am I seeing things?"

Oliver sucked in a sharp breath. "...Natalie, next time could you pinch yourself?"

Why was he always the unlucky one?

Natalie said matter-of-factly, "Young people have thick skin. A pinch won't kill you."

Oliver: "..." Thanks a lot.

Vincent Macmillan smiled silently, hands clasped behind his back as he strolled leisurely home.

Camille Valrose's face darkened like a thundercloud. Without waiting for Oliver, she drove off alone.

Oliver lowered his head to hide the disappointment in his eyes.

It's fine. He was used to it.

He comforted himself—sincerity could move mountains. One day...

She would see his true feelings.

......

Adrian Klein and Evelyn Langley remained oblivious to the others' reactions.

Back at the apartment complex, they walked upstairs one after another.

Motion-activated lights flickered on and off with their footsteps. Evelyn watched Adrian's tall silhouette ahead. Their elongated shadows merged and separated under the shifting light, creating an illusion of long acquaintance.

"Thank you for today."

Her soft voice carried faint echoes in the quiet stairwell.

Adrian seemed in unusually good spirits. Though she couldn't see his face, his relaxed tone was evident. "For dinner? Or for seeing you home?"

Evelyn: "Both. Thank you for dinner, for bringing me home, and especially for letting me use your lab."

And for that declaration at dinner—"Evelyn is Professor Roland's student."

On the seventh floor, Adrian stopped.

He turned to watch her climb the final step, slightly breathless, then walk to stand beside him.

"I know what you want to say. But a pearl covered in dust remains a pearl—once wiped clean, its brilliance returns."

Evelyn's heart skipped. She looked up into his eyes.

Adrian spoke deliberately. "The future's unpredictable, but the present can be seized. Though belated—welcome to my lab."

His eyes held warmth as he extended his hand.

Evelyn smiled, gently returning the handshake. "Thank you. I'd say the timing's perfect."

......

After arranging to go together the next day, they went to their respective apartments.

Evelyn showered, reviewed some materials, then slept.

At dawn, she made two sandwiches—hers with extra cream, Adrian's with more vegetables and less cream.

She also freshly ground sugar-free soy milk from homegrown beans.

At exactly 7 AM, a knock sounded at her door.

After breakfast, they headed to the lab together.

Arriving early, Evelyn and Adrian changed into lab coats and began working.

By 8 AM, others started trickling in.

Natalie set down her bag and changed before sidling up to Evelyn. "You're already halfway through the experiment? What time did you get here?"
###Chapter 196

Evelyn gently swirled the test tube between her fingers. Her eyes remained fixed on the changing solution as she rapidly recorded data. "Arrived half an hour ago. Natalie, could you check this ratio for me?"

Natalie set down her pipette and leaned closer. "Extend the reaction time by ten minutes. You can reduce the catalyst by 0.5 milliliters."

Camille walked past in her high heels, casting a disdainful glance at Evelyn's focused profile. A mere undergraduate trying to make waves? Just putting on airs.

The lab clock showed 12:30 when Evelyn finally noticed the empty workspace. Rubbing her stiff neck, she considered grabbing a quick lunch at the cafeteria.

As she pushed open the lab door, Adrian appeared carrying a takeout bag.

"Picked this up on my way." He handed her the steaming container. "Beef noodles. I remember you like them."

Evelyn's fingers brushed against condensation droplets on the bag as she accepted it. "Have you eaten already?"

"Yeah." Adrian nodded. "How's the data coming?"

"Almost there." She lifted the lid, releasing an aromatic cloud.

In the break room, Evelyn wolfed down her lunch and chased it with black coffee. Natalie's suggestion had improved the results, but they still fell short of her expectations. The data would suffice for her paper, but she wanted greater precision.

At least she had access to Adrian's lab. Tossing the cup into the trash, she hurried back.

The conversation inside died abruptly when she entered. Vincent pretended to organize reagents, Oliver fiddled with a microscope, and Camille simply turned away.

Evelyn paused briefly before continuing to her workstation. She'd long outgrown caring about others' opinions.

Human relationships resembled hunters and woodcutters in a forest—one chasing living prey, the other gathering dead wood. Different goals meant different paths. Temporary companionship was serendipity; parting ways was inevitable.

Starting the experiment anew left little time. Sampling, statistics, analysis—the workload pressed down on her alone. From dawn till midnight, her lab light always burned last.

After a week, Evelyn finally returned to her apartment to freshen up. The succulents on her balcony remained plump, but the orchid had withered. She fed the fish, did a quick clean, then began packing.

Her phone suddenly blared. Seeing the caller ID, her hands trembled, scattering clothes across the floor.
###Chapter 197

"Evelyn Langley! How dare you ignore my calls?!" Sophia Laurent's furious voice exploded through the phone. "Twenty-seven missed calls!"

Evelyn frantically checked her call log. The screen was flooded with red missed call notifications.

She hunched her shoulders guiltily. "Sorry, the lab's been swamped with this project deadline..."

"Always the lab!" Sophia's voice trembled with anger. "Why don't you just marry your damn lab already!"

Evelyn quickly changed the subject. "I'll be there for your birthday next month! Already got your gift!"

"That's more like it." Sophia snorted. "Stand me up and I'll drag you out of that lab myself."

Hanging up, Evelyn rushed back to the laboratory.

The moment she opened the door, Oliver Lancelot's frustrated shout greeted her. "This data makes no sense! Eight calculations, eight different results!"

Vincent Macmillan adjusted his glasses. "The issue's in the third node."

"Impossible!" Natalie Blanchet countered immediately. "The formula's too complex."

Camille Valrose silently took the data sheet and began rapid calculations.

"Look here." She circled several key values. "It should be calculated this way."

The lab fell silent.

All eyes fixed on the formula-covered paper.

Oliver's eyes widened. "That's it!"
###Chapter 198

Natalie Blanchet double-checked the data, her brow relaxing slightly. "This should be correct now."

Vincent Macmillan suddenly pressed a finger on one page. "Wait. These two sets still don't match."

Evelyn Langley happened to pass by. Her gaze swept over the dense numbers before her fingertip landed on the seventh row. "This is wrong. It's not 50 and 71. It should be 50.2 and 70.88."

The lab air froze.

Natalie, Vincent, Oliver Lancelot, and Camille Valrose exchanged glances, suspicion evident on each face.

Camille rolled her eyes dramatically.

Vincent was the team's strongest at calculations. If even he missed it, how could Evelyn spot the error at a glance?

Ridiculous.

Natalie cleared her throat. "Evelyn, Oliver has been tracking this dataset. We've all verified—"

"Professor Roland and I both checked the calculations," Vincent added.

"Some people just love showing off," Camille sneered, stepping aggressively toward Evelyn. "Biology and physics are worlds apart. What would you know?"

Her voice turned cutting. "So you won a high school competition gold medal? Big deal. Research isn't about solving textbook problems!"

"If you don't understand, stay quiet. That's basic professionalism."

Natalie tried to mediate, but Camille's rapid-fire words shut her down.

The lab fell dead silent.

All eyes were on Evelyn.

Natalie sighed inwardly. Maybe letting her learn this lesson wasn't a bad idea...
###Chapter 199

Vincent Macmillan stood to the side, hands tucked in his lab coat pockets, silent.

Camille Valrose tilted her chin up with disdain. "A biology student daring to comment on physics experimental data? What a joke..."

Oliver Lancelot suddenly leaped up from his computer. "Evelyn was right!"

The lab fell silent.

Camille's expression froze.

Natalie Blanchet and Vincent turned simultaneously. "What?"

Oliver pointed at the screen. "The initial values for Node 7 should be 50.2 and 70.88, not 50 and 71! This tiny error caused all subsequent data anomalies."

Vincent rushed to the computer, recalculating rapidly. The data curve gradually normalized under his adjustments.

"It's fixed!" He slammed the desk excitedly.

Natalie verified the results, her gaze turning complex when she looked at Evelyn.

Oliver already gripped Evelyn's hand enthusiastically. "Thank you! This dataset stalled us for three whole days!"

Evelyn calmly withdrew her hand. "Just a lucky observation. Professor Macmillan would've spotted it soon."

Her eyes swept across everyone present.

Natalie felt a pang of guilt. For two weeks, the entire research team had maintained a subtle distance from the new intern.

To them, Evelyn was just a freshly graduated undergrad. A biology major, no less—how could she comprehend advanced physics experiments?

Yet now, this underestimated girl had solved a problem that stumped the entire team for days.

Camille looked the most uncomfortable. Her earlier mockery still hung in the air, now slapping her own face.

She never imagined an outsider would uncover an error the professionals missed.
###Chapter 200

Camille Valrose stood frozen, her fingertips turning cold.

Evelyn Langley's voice was feather-light yet carried the weight of a thousand pounds.

"You're right, senior. Research does require rigor." She paused. "But true scientific spirit also means humbly accepting others' input."

The lab's fluorescent lights washed Camille's face ghostly pale.

Those words sliced through her arrogance like a scalpel.

Her nails dug deep into her palms, yet she felt no pain.

......

The late-night apartment was so quiet she could hear the clock ticking.

Evelyn collapsed onto the couch, too exhausted to lift a finger.

Her lashes fluttered briefly before she drifted into shallow sleep.

Meanwhile, the nightclub in the northern district was reaching its peak frenzy.

Julian Roscente lounged in the VIP booth, swirling amber liquor in his glass.

The dance floor pulsed with gyrating bodies. His gaze skimmed over the sea of scantily clad figures.

"Julian, hiding out here?" Dylan Lowell sidled up with his drink. "Don't tell me you're scared of losing?"

Julian scoffed. "The word 'fear' isn't in my vocabulary."

He jerked his chin toward the dance floor. "See that one in the black dress? Tonight's lucky winner."

Dylan frowned. "You'll get burned playing with fire like this."

"Relax. I'm more reliable than a condom." Julian swirled his glass lazily. "Still sulking in there?"

"You'd be pissed too if a kid dropped into your lap out of nowhere."

Julian grinned. "Free son sounds great. My mom's been nagging me for grandkids."

"Shut it." Dylan lowered his voice. "If Nathan hears that, that kid'll be on your birth certificate by tomorrow."

Julian's expression soured instantly. "Hell no. That's a blessing I can't handle."

He was infamous for his playboy antics, but never reckless enough to get burned.

Just then, the private room door swung open.

Nathan Evans strode out, jacket in hand, face stormy. "Get the car. We're leaving."
###Chapter 201

The night deepened. Nathan Evans stared at his phone screen, the red number of missed calls burning his eyes. Three from his mother, one from Chloe Valentine—the relentless calls made his temples throb.

Dylan Lowell swirled his glass and approached. "Leaving at nine?"

Nathan loosened his tie, dark fire simmering in his eyes. The chandelier's light glinted off his sharp jawline like an unsheathed blade.

"I'll have the driver take you," Dylan said, wisely stepping back.

As the elevator doors closed, Julian Roscente's laughter drifted from the private room. "Never thought I'd see the day Nathan got played by a canary."

Dylan kicked him. "Shut up."

"Am I wrong?" Julian waved his phone. "Just got word—Evelyn Langley's pulling an all-nighter in the Harvard lab. Microscopes are her new obsession. Doubt she remembers a certain Mr. Evans."

The liquor cabinet's glass reflected Julian's smug face. He still remembered Evelyn waiting outside the club for Nathan, drenched like a stray dog in the rain.

Who knew strays could grow fangs?

"Should I call Ethan Winston?" Julian scrolled through his contacts. "Since the main act left."

Ethan's refusal was immediate. "I quit."

"Nathan's not here!"

"Making Evelyn pear stew," came the reply, accompanied by the clink of porcelain. "She's been coughing."

Julian nearly threw his phone.

The black Maybach cut through neon lights. Nathan rolled down the window. The early autumn wind carried osmanthus fragrance, but it couldn't disperse the suffocation in his chest.

In the rearview mirror, the villa blazed with light. Margaret Evans' nutritionist carried bird's nest upstairs. Chloe's pink slippers by the entrance glared like a fresh wound.
###Chapter 202

Nathan Evans stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, cigarette ash crumbling from his fingertips.

The night outside was dark, but his gaze was darker.

Chloe Valentine had dared to go behind his back to see Margaret Evans. What a brilliant move.

She was supposed to take the money and leave. Yet here she was, shamelessly living in the Evans family villa.

He stubbed out his cigarette, lips twisting into a cold smirk.

This woman was far more cunning than he'd thought.

He used to believe she was naive and harmless. Now he saw it was all an act.

Because of her, he'd lost Evelyn Langley.

The thought sent another wave of ice through his veins.

He hadn't been home in three days, choosing to sleep at the office instead.

His phone buzzed—another call from Margaret.

"You're coming home tonight." Her tone brooked no argument.

Nathan closed his eyes briefly before grabbing his suit jacket.

The villa blazed with light.

Chloe stood in the foyer, a gentle smile on her face. "Nathan, you're back."

She reached for his jacket.

He sidestepped her, striding straight to the living room.

Her hand hung in midair, eyes reddening.

She'd changed into a pale blue maternity dress that accentuated her fair skin.

Nathan didn't spare her a glance.

"Mother, I'm home." His voice was flat. "If there's nothing else, I'll go upstairs."

Margaret set down her teacup. "Come to the study."

The moment the study door closed, the air turned glacial.

"How long will you keep this up?" Margaret frowned.

Nathan poured himself a whiskey, swirling the glass lazily. "Keep what up?"

"That's your child!"

"I never acknowledged it." His laugh was icy. "You're the one who insisted on keeping this problem."

Margaret slammed her palm on the desk. "Evans blood doesn't belong on the streets!"

Nathan downed the whiskey in one gulp, Adam's apple bobbing. "Fine."

"What?"

"The child stays. Chloe disappears the moment it's born." His gaze sharpened. "And you stay out of my relationship with Evelyn."

After a weighted pause, Margaret nodded.

She'd never liked Chloe—only tolerated her for the baby's sake.

Nathan left the study, steps lighter.

In the living room, Chloe called timidly after him, "Nathan..."

He walked out without looking back.

The night air hit his face. Nathan inhaled deeply.

Now, at last, he could go to Evelyn without restraint.
###Chapter 203

Evelyn Langley jolted awake to urgent knocking.

She sat bolt upright, straining to locate the sound.

"Who is it?" Clutching her robe, she stood guard behind the door.

Adrian Klein was pulling an all-nighter at the lab. The security in this aging walk-up apartment was practically nonexistent.

The knocking paused, then resumed with stubborn persistence.

"I won't open without a name."

"...It's me." Nathan Evans' voice seeped through the wood.

Her fingernails dug into her palms.

"What do you want?"

"Let me in. I won't touch you." His voice rasped with exhaustion. "You can keep the door open."

"Not necessary." Her refusal was absolute.

The knocking morphed into rhythmic taps—some obstinate code.

Evelyn shoved noise-canceling headphones over her ears, cranking the volume.

Even after her shower, the infuriating sound continued.

She dialed 911 with icy precision. "There's a harasser at my door."

Thirty minutes later, silence finally reclaimed the hallway.

At dawn, Evelyn left early.

She wheeled a suitcase stuffed with clothes, planning to camp at the lab.

The moment she stepped outside, a shadow intercepted her.

"Happy now?" Nathan blocked her path, dark circles bruising his eyes.

His wrinkled shirt hung like a rag. Stubble shadowed his jaw.

Bloodshot eyes locked onto hers—a wounded predator.

"The officers lectured me till 3 AM." His voice scraped raw. "Can we talk now?"

Evelyn stepped back. "You deserved it."

"Why call the cops?"

"The best response to harassment is legal consequences."

Nathan suddenly grabbed her suitcase handle. "Since when are we reduced to 'harassment'?"

"Let go."

"What does six years mean to you?" His knuckles whitened. "Nothing?"

She yanked the suitcase free. "Exes should know their place."

"You hate me." Not a question.

"Wrong." She met his gaze squarely. "Hate requires feeling. And you—"

A deliberate pause. Her lips curled. "I've reset you to zero."

Every sleepless night post-breakup, she'd replayed their memories like a film.

From sweetness to betrayal. From heartbreak to numbness.

Now the reel had burned to ash.

"Bullshit!" Nathan's voice cracked. "You definitely—"

"Definitely what?" Evelyn cut in. "Cried over you? Got drunk?"

A hollow laugh. "So what?"

The suitcase wheels screeched against concrete.

"Stop lying to yourself, Nathan Evans."
###Chapter 204

Nathan grabbed Evelyn's wrist with sudden force.

Evelyn found it utterly absurd.

He was the one who pushed her away. Now that she was finally moving on, he wanted to drag her back into the abyss?

How laughable.

"Don't make me despise you even more."

Her words pierced through his defenses like an ice spike.

"Evelyn... give me another chance..."

Her gaze remained eerily calm, like stagnant water.

"All obstacles are gone now. Even my mother approves. We can get married today!"

"Not interested."

His so-called solutions were nothing but a self-indulgent performance.

"Evelyn..."

"Move."

She shook off his hand and walked away without looking back.

Nathan stood frozen, statue-like.

The morning rush hour crowd flowed around him, yet he seemed trapped in a vacuum, staring blankly ahead.

After a long silence, his lips barely moved.

"Is it... really over?"

......

Chloe had no idea what happened in the study that night.

At first, she trembled with fear, expecting Nathan to kick her out any moment.

But soon, she relaxed.

Margaret doted on her, ordering the staff to cater to her every need.

Expensive tonics arrived daily.

To her surprise, Nathan even allowed her to stay in the mansion.

The servants, reading the room, began calling her "Madam."

Her favorite fruits appeared within half an hour of craving them.

Margaret casually gifted her luxury bags and jewelry.

Chloe slept in, indulged in imported bird's nest soup.

Now she understood why so many women coveted wealthy marriages.

She regretted not getting pregnant sooner—missing out on such luxury.

Only one thing unsettled her...

Margaret's indulgence was entirely because of her unborn child.

But Nathan's attitude remained inscrutable.

After leaving that night, he didn't return until dawn—then fell ill.

He refused doctors, food, or water.

Locked himself in his bedroom all day.

When Chloe tried to show concern, his glare sent her recoiling.

In that moment, she felt like a disgusting cockroach.

Though he soon regained his composure.

"Darling, are you going out?" She rushed to him eagerly.

"Call me that again, and you're out."
###Chapter 205

"Vincent, I need you to run these calculations ASAP!" Natalie slammed a stack of papers onto Vincent Macmillan's desk.

He didn't even look up. "Use the computer. I'm still processing my experiment data."

"Just five minutes!" Natalie stamped her foot impatiently.

Vincent jerked his chin toward the opposite workstation. "Ask Evelyn."

After the last data correction incident, everyone in the lab knew Evelyn Langley's extraordinary mental math skills. Only Camille Valrose stubbornly dismissed it as luck.

"Need help, Natalie?" Evelyn set down her test tube and approached.

Natalie looked relieved. "Calculate these figures for me!"

Evelyn took the documents, her fingers lightly tapping the pages. Two minutes later, she looked up. "Results sent to your inbox."

"That fast?!" Natalie's eyes widened.

Vincent abruptly dropped his pipette and snatched the papers. "Let me see."

Natalie scoffed. "You refused earlier, now you want to verify?"

Ignoring her, Vincent began scribbling calculations. Oliver Lancelot instinctively clicked his stopwatch.

"Done." Vincent set down his pen. "Time?"

"Two minutes three seconds," Oliver announced.

Vincent stared at Evelyn with newfound interest. "You trained in mental math?"

"I learned abacus calculation as a child." Evelyn touched her nose sheepishly. "Around five or six."

The lab fell silent.

Vincent swallowed hard. "That's...it?"

Oliver suddenly jumped in. "Evelyn, how about a challenge?"

All eyes turned toward them.

Vincent perked up immediately. "Brilliant! Oliver's been training with me for eight months—perfect test."

"Whoever solves the most problems correctly in ten minutes wins." Vincent produced paper and pens. "Loser buys lunch for the team."

Oliver cracked his knuckles. "I'm treating everyone today!"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "You might regret that offer, Oliver."

Her rare competitive edge electrified the lab atmosphere.

Camille muttered under her breath, "Such a showoff..." Only Oliver caught it.

Vincent scrawled five problems. "Ready—go!"

Pure calculation questions—a battle of speed and accuracy.

Three minutes in, Evelyn finished two problems. Oliver was already on his third.

Natalie nudged Vincent. "Who's your money on?"

Vincent kept his eyes on the competitors. "Oliver's ahead for now."
###Chapter 206

Nathan remained silent, but his eyes said everything.

By the fifth minute, Evelyn's pen flew across the paper as she solved the fifth problem.

Oliver hesitated for a few seconds on the fourth question, falling behind.

Evelyn overtook him, though the gap was razor-thin.

At the sixth minute, both hit a wall on the final problem.

...

Six minutes and fifty seconds in, Evelyn set down her pen.

Beads of sweat dotted Oliver's forehead. "...Done!"

Too late by ten seconds.

Wiping his brow, he forced composure. "Speed's just one factor. Accuracy matters more."

The results proved otherwise—Evelyn flawless, Oliver with one error.

His eyes widened. "?" The rebuttal came too fast to process.

"Your mental math is incredible," he conceded. "Just childhood training, really?"

Vincent nodded subtly.

Evelyn's brilliance wasn't just skill—it was her unshakable poise under pressure.

That alone sealed Oliver's defeat.

Natalie teased, "Well, Oliver? Convinced now?"

He waved both hands. "Totally. Thoroughly outclassed—"

Losing to Vincent was one thing, but an undergrad?

This blindsided him.

Natalie clapped his shoulder. "Win some, lose some. Rematch later—but tonight's dinner won't wait."

The last part carried more weight.

Oliver grinned. "My treat! But Evelyn, how'd you crack the last problem?"

His method had seemed ingenious.

She explained her approach without hesitation.

His jaw dropped. "...That works?"

"If it gets the answer."

"...Mind blown."

Vincent pressed again, "Sure you never trained formally?"

Meeting his probing gaze, she shook her head. "Positive."

Since childhood, numbers bent to her will—problems requiring steps for others solved at a glance.

"I've compiled mental calculation notes. Interested?"

Natalie gasped. "Vincent, your sacred notes? Since when do you share?"

He shrugged. "A sword suits its master. Worthy hands deserve good tools."

Evelyn hesitated. "Is that...appropriate?"

Vincent cut straight through. "Yes or no?"

"Absolutely!"

Why refuse such an offer?

Oliver, completely out of the loop: "?" So love transfers just like that?

Fine. Clearly, I'm unworthy.

Natalie smoothly redirected. "Shouldn't we decide dinner plans now?"

"Eating out?" A new voice cut in from the doorway.

They turned.

Adrian entered, tying his lab coat. "Reached a verdict yet? Where to?"
###Chapter 207

Adrian Klein arrived at the lab clutching his lecture notes, only to find everyone gathered in a boisterous circle.

"Professor's here!" Natalie Blanchet spotted him first and waved eagerly. "Oliver and Evelyn are having a mental calculation showdown. The loser has to treat everyone to dinner!"

His gaze swept across the crowd, landing on Evelyn Langley who was suppressing a smile, her cheeks tinged pink. The lab atmosphere felt unusually relaxed—she seemed to have finally been accepted by the team.

"Looks like someone's wallet is about to take a hit." Adrian's lips quirked upward. "Let's wrap up early today so Oliver can pay up."

Natalie's eyes widened. "How did you know Oliver would lose, Professor?"

"Lucky guess." He adjusted his glasses.

Oliver Lancelot groaned dramatically, clutching his wallet.

Camille Valrose stood apart in the corner, declining coldly: "I won't be joining."

...

Night fell as the group settled at a modest street-side diner.

Though Natalie had threatened to bankrupt Oliver, she'd thoughtfully chosen this affordable spot. Everyone knew Oliver sent most of his monthly stipend back home to his family.

The plastic chairs and greasy menus couldn't dampen their appetites. Compared to stiff fine dining, this unpretentious meal filled with laughter felt infinitely more comfortable.

During the ride back, Evelyn sat in the passenger seat, eyes sparkling.

"Having fun?" Adrian caught her buoyant expression from the corner of his eye.

"Yes!" She nodded emphatically. "Natalie said 'see you tomorrow,' and Professor Macmillan gave me his mental calculation notes..."

She'd always sensed their subtle distance. But today, those icy barriers seemed to have finally melted.

At a red light, Adrian stopped the car.

Almost unconsciously, he reached over and ruffled her hair. "You did well."

The softness against his palm sent an unexpected jolt through him.

Evelyn looked up sharply, meeting his deep gaze. Flustered, she turned away, the tips of her ears burning crimson.

Adrian withdrew his hand casually, as if this were merely a mentor encouraging his student. Only he knew the lingering tingle in his fingertips.

"Honk—"

A horn blast from behind startled them both.

"P-professor..." Evelyn whispered. "It's green."

Adrian blinked, realizing the light had changed, and quickly hit the gas.

"Professor?" Evelyn leaned closer suddenly, pointing in surprise. "Why is your face so red?"

Under the streetlights, the fair-skinned man's complexion did indeed show suspicious pink tinges.
###Chapter 208

Evelyn watched as Adrian's ears turned from pale to pink, then deepened into crimson. The transformation happened impossibly fast, like someone had spilled paint across his face.

"Must be the air conditioning." Adrian turned away, his Adam's apple bobbing slightly.

She quickly adjusted the temperature. "Better now?"

"Much."

......

After dropping Evelyn off, Adrian remembered the unrecorded lab data and turned his car back toward the research institute.

Evelyn collapsed onto her sofa, the adrenaline fading into exhaustion. Staring at the ceiling, she replayed the car scene in her mind.

The lingering sensation of Adrian's slender fingers gently tousling her hair remained. That cautious tenderness, as if afraid of breaking something precious.

Maybe he really was encouraging her.

But nothing more.

The water stain on the ceiling glared under the light. No matter how much wallpaper covered it, the previous tenant's cigarette burns and mold patches always revealed themselves at certain angles.

Just like the ugly corners of her heart.

Better to maintain a safe distance than risk discovery and disgust.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her chest.

Good. Her heartbeat had steadied.

She headed to the shower.

A hot bath and a long sleep. Tomorrow would be a new day. If tomorrow proved too difficult, there was always the day after. One day at a time—she'd endure.

......

That weekend, Evelyn finally had time to catch a movie with Sophia.

The Lunar New Year comedy was packed. Evelyn clutched the popcorn bucket while Sophia shrieked at a cameo appearance.

"Two seconds! I spent two hundred grand in gifts for two seconds!" Sophia wailed, grabbing a handful of popcorn. "But damn, he's gorgeous, right?"

Evelyn nodded. "Quite handsome."

"Want his number?" Sophia's eyes sparkled. "He's filming a new series—"

"No thanks." Evelyn shook her head. "Too young."

Sophia leaned in. "Oh? So you prefer the mature type?"

Evelyn pushed her away. "Don't be ridiculous."

Her heartbeat stuttered.
###Chapter 209

"I'm starving." Sophia Laurent abruptly changed the subject, her eyes sparkling. "Didn't we reserve a restaurant? Let's go."

The trendy Chaoshan hotpot spot, hidden near the city center, was currently the most popular social media check-in destination. Sophia had barely secured the last private booth for the weekend after booking three days in advance.

Adjacent to a predawn seafood market, the restaurant received freshly butchered beef every morning. The marbled meat arrived by noon, its tender texture glistening with delicate fat veins.

Though Evelyn Langley normally craved spicy food, today she found herself oddly anticipating the clear broth. The bone-based stock simmered in a copper pot, its milky surface dotted with goji berries, releasing an intoxicating aroma.

Sophia slapped the menu decisively upon sitting. "Ribeye, chuck flap, shank..." She ordered seven or eight cuts without hesitation. "Double portions of each."

Her nonstop workweek had shed three pounds—today demanded compensation. Dieting could wait until tomorrow; indulgence belonged to the present.

Evelyn swallowed discreetly at the mountain of meat arriving at their table. "Can we finish all this?"

"Forgot to mention." Sophia suddenly blinked. "Aunt just asked me to invite Adrian home for dinner. Since he's off today...I may have extended the invitation." She leaned closer. "You're not upset, are you?"

Evelyn choked on her soup, flushing crimson.

Sophia studied her curiously. "You see each other daily at the lab. Why so nervous?"

She'd specifically included Adrian Klein to ensure her guileless best friend had the lab director's protection. With his authority shielding Evelyn, who'd dare harass her?

"The soup's too hot." Evelyn dabbed her lips with a napkin.

Sophia accepted the explanation easily. "Then drink slowly."

......

Adrian arrived thirty minutes late, delayed by rush hour traffic.

Water droplets jeweled his dark hair as he entered, his shoulders darkened by rain.

"No umbrella?" Sophia gaped. Her meticulous cousin committing such an oversight?

"Forgot." His tone remained even.

Evelyn's soup spoon stilled. Last month's storm flashed through her mind—Adrian lending her his umbrella, never asking for its return.

That black long-handled umbrella still stood in her apartment's entryway.

She wished to vanish into her soup bowl.

Adrian caught her movement in his periphery, amusement flickering in his eyes.

......

Steam fogged the windows as rain wove delicate patterns outside. The murmur of diners, bubbling broth, and occasional distant car horns blended into comforting white noise.

Night had fully fallen when they departed. Sophia drove off alone, leaving Evelyn to ride with Adrian.

Parking spaces were scarce in the old neighborhood, forcing them to leave his car at a mall garage. Crossing a tree-lined path, sudden wind erupted.

Cottonwood seeds swirled violently through the air like an unseasonal April snowstorm.
###Chapter 210

"Ah-choo!"

Evelyn Langley sneezed violently.

"Excuse m—Ah-choo!"

Three consecutive sneezes left her eyes watering.

Adrian Klein immediately pulled a tissue packet from his coat, swiftly offering her one.

"Cover your nose. Breathe deeply."

She pressed the tissue gently against her nose, finding instant relief.

They hurried back to their apartment complex.

After parting at the elevator, Evelyn sneezed over a dozen times the moment she stepped inside.

Rubbing her reddened nose, tears welled in her eyes.

Boston had many charms, but this damned pollen season wasn't one of them.

Even after years here, her allergies never improved.

A cup of hot water and antihistamines later, she finally recovered.

Tying on an apron, she began preparing tomorrow's lunchbox.

By the time she packed the meals into insulated containers and cleaned the kitchen, it was nearly eleven.

Sighing at the full trash bag, Evelyn carried it downstairs.

Her phone rang as she reached the building entrance.

"Dylan?"

"Evelyn! Nathan's heading your way! He's drunk—I couldn't stop him—"

Her gaze darted around nervously when a dark figure suddenly lunged at her.

"Ah!"

"Evelyn..." The man reeked of alcohol, his glassy eyes fixed on her.

Dylan's frantic voice came through the phone. "Evelyn? What's wrong?"

Nathan Evans snatched the device and ended the call.

"First Ethan, now Dylan." His words slurred with venom. "You claim not to love me, yet cozy up to my friends?"

"You're drunk." She turned away. "I won't talk to you like this."

"Drunk?" His hands clamped on her shoulders, shaking her. "You used to fuss over me when I drank—"

"That was the past." She shoved him back forcefully.

The intoxicated man staggered two steps.

"My compassion is reserved for those who deserve it."

"...I don't anymore?" His voice trembled.

"You stopped deserving it long ago."

Evelyn spun to leave.

Nathan suddenly grabbed her long hair.

"Ah!"
###Chapter 211

Nathan Evans jerked his hand back as if electrocuted, his eyes panicked. "I'm sorry, Evelyn... I didn't mean to... I just... didn't want you avoiding me..."

"Don't touch me!" Evelyn Langley clutched her throbbing scalp, her eyes reddening.

Rapid footsteps approached from a distance.

Dylan Lowell arrived with Ethan Winston in tow.

"Where are you hurt?" Ethan bypassed Nathan completely, his gaze locked on Evelyn's reddened forehead.

Thirty minutes earlier, he'd been signing an eight-figure contract.

The moment Dylan called, he'd thrown down his pen and left.

He'd run three red lights before meeting Dylan at the alley entrance.

They'd rushed straight to Evelyn's building in silent agreement.

Just as expected, they found Nathan drunk and disorderly.

Evelyn took half a step back, avoiding Ethan's outstretched hand. "I'm fine."

Ethan's eyes narrowed at her disheveled hair. "Your scalp's red. That's not 'fine.'"

His voice dropped lower. "You don't have to pretend with me."

Nathan suddenly lunged forward. "Ethan Winston! Who gave you the right to interfere?"

"I'll say what I want." Ethan didn't even glance his way.

Nathan turned on Dylan. "Why'd you bring him? To humiliate me?"

Dylan spread his hands helplessly.

Why was the fire directed at him now?

Ethan's voice turned icy. "Dylan came because he considers you a brother. Otherwise, who'd care if you lived or died?"

"Brothers?" Nathan sneered. "Where was this brotherhood when you were stealing my girl?"

"She stopped being your girlfriend long ago."

"So that makes it okay? Ethan, have you no shame?"

Ethan scoffed. "Weren't you the one who dumped her at the bar?"

Nathan choked on his words.

Ethan turned back to Evelyn, speaking softly. "Go inside."

Seeing Dylan nod in agreement, Evelyn turned toward the building.

She desperately wanted someone to rein Nathan in.

Preferably before the police got involved.

With Dylan here, things probably wouldn't escalate too badly...

Nathan moved to follow, but Ethan blocked him.

"Get out of my way!"

"Can't you see how much she dislikes you?"

"She hates you!"

Ethan smirked coldly. "She used to tolerate your crap. Not anymore."
###Chapter 212

Nathan staggered back a step. "Explain yourself."

"Not clear enough?" Ethan adjusted his cufflinks. "You thought you'd covered your tracks, but Evelyn saw right through you."

Nathan's pupils constricted violently as he grabbed Ethan's collar. "What did you do to her?!"

"Pathetic." Ethan smirked. "A man who can't even figure out why she left has no right to question me."

"Stop playing games!"

Ethan shoved him away, smoothing his sleeves. "Look at you—more pitiful than a stray mutt."

Dylan stepped between them. "Enough! Must you destroy a decade of friendship?"

"Friends?" Nathan scoffed.

"Hardly." Ethan echoed coldly.

Dylan exhaled sharply.

Nathan jabbed a finger at Ethan's face. "Stay away from Evelyn, or—"

"Or what?" Ethan arched an eyebrow.

"Don't make me end this."

Ethan chuckled darkly. "Empty threats won't work. If it's not me, it'll be someone else. But one thing remains unchanged—"

He leaned in, each word a dagger. "Evelyn will never forgive you."

"Do yourself a favor and let go. Unless..."

The unspoken warning hung in the air as Ethan turned to leave. He clapped Dylan's shoulder. "Keep him in check. We've had enough drama tonight."

His silhouette dissolved into the darkness.

Dylan studied Nathan's frozen form with a quiet sigh.

If only...

"Nate..."

"Come on." Dylan hooked an arm around him. "Let's get you home."

"Why won't she come back this time?" Nathan's voice cracked. "No matter how badly I messed up before, she always forgave me..."

His glassy eyes mirrored a lost child's.

Dylan hesitated. "...A caged bird stays not because it can't escape, but because it chooses to."

"And now?"

"When the heart dies, no cage can hold it."

So she'd spread her wings—never looking back.

"Dead heart..."

The second time he'd heard those words.

The first was from Evelyn herself.

"I'll change," Nathan rasped.

Dylan swallowed hard. "...Some mistakes go beyond apologies."

"What then? Give her my life?!"

Dylan recognized the drunken despair.

The sober Nathan would bleed before showing weakness.

"Rest first. We'll talk tomorrow—"

Nathan wrenched free, stumbling toward the apartment entrance.

"Nate! Where are you going?"
###Chapter 213

Nathan Evans ignored everything.

He strode straight toward the staircase.

Dylan Lowell hurried after him, gripping his shoulder. "Nathan, stop this. Let's go back. Evelyn won't open the door."

"I have something to give her."

Dylan froze. "What?"

Nathan pulled out a tube of allergy cream from his pocket. "This season always triggers her allergies."

Dylan's eyes burned unexpectedly.

How had two people who loved each other so deeply ended up like this?

"Right," Nathan nodded, voice thick. "I came to deliver this... must give it to her..."

Before he could finish, his vision darkened. His body went limp, collapsing forward.

Dylan barely caught him, dragging him toward the waiting SUV.

He exhaled heavily at the sight of the vehicle parked at the alley's entrance.

By the time they reached the estate, it was 1 AM.

The housekeeper gasped as Dylan staggered inside. "Help me! And brew some hangover soup."

After barking orders, he turned to leave.

Chloe Valentine jolted awake at the commotion.

Clutching her robe, she descended the stairs—her dreams of wealth outweighing sleep deprivation.

"Let me help him." She reached for Nathan.

The housekeeper hesitated. "Madam, your condition—"

"I'm fine." Chloe insisted, taking his weight.

The moment she did, his dead weight nearly toppled her.

"Wait!" She yelped, flustered. "You'd better take him."

After gulping water, Nathan regained slight awareness.

Chloe knelt before him, eyes gleaming. "Baby—"

His icy glare cut her off.

She instantly corrected herself. "Nathan, are you feeling better?"

"Move."

Chloe stiffened.

"Need it spelled out?"

Tears welled. "Nathan, I'm scared..."

His expression remained stone. "Don't make me repeat myself."

Biting her lip, she stepped aside.

He marched upstairs without a backward glance.

Swallowing humiliation, Chloe forced a smile at the housekeeper. "He's just drunk. Prepare the soup—I'll deliver it personally."

In the master bedroom, Nathan leaned against the door.

Evelyn's tear-streaked face flashed behind his eyelids.

His hand dove into his pocket—

The cream was gone!

He tore through his clothes, ransacked the downstairs, then finally collapsed behind the sofa.

Kneeling there, the billionaire sobbed like a lost child.
###Chapter 214

The night was heavy as Adrian Klein stood alone in the empty living room.

"Evelyn..."

His whisper echoed through the silent space.

"I miss you so much..."

The howling wind outside seemed to mock his solitude.

"Come back to me?"

Only cold air and shifting shadows on the walls answered him.

......

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Evelyn Langley rose early, washed up, and tied on her apron to prepare breakfast.

Eggs sizzled in the skillet while toast aroma filled the kitchen.

With efficient movements, she packed the meal into containers and gathered her research materials.

As she closed the door, a paper bag caught her eye.

It hung from the doorknob, containing a tube of nasal ointment.

Her usual brand.

Evelyn scanned the empty hallway.

Her gaze drifted to the door across from hers.

Just as she hesitated to knock, it swung open.

Adrian emerged with a grim expression, freezing when he saw her.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn instantly sensed trouble.

He strode toward the elevator: "We've got lab issues. I'll explain on the way."

Her stomach dropped as she followed, the ointment forgotten.

During descent, Adrian's phone rang.

The caller's words darkened his expression.

"...Understood. We're arriving now."

Hanging up, he preempted her question: "System crash. We've lost this week's data."

"Backups?" Her voice tightened.

"Mostly wiped. Less than thirty percent remains."

The lab routinely purged data monthly, having just done so last week.

Their dual-backup system had never failed before.

This anomaly felt too deliberate.

......

By 8 AM, the entire lab team had assembled.

Technicians worked frantically on the computers.

Adrian approached the console: "Status?"

Vincent Macmillan wiped his brow: "Camille Valrose was inputting data when the screen went black. The data vanished after reboot."

Natalie Blanchet stared at the monitor, brow furrowed.

Camille, their meticulous data manager, paced pale-faced in a corner.

Oliver Lancelot pressed: "Can you recover anything, sir?"

The technician's fingers flew across the keyboard, beads of sweat forming.

A suffocating silence enveloped the laboratory.
###Chapter 215

The technician sighed. "You've asked five times in ten minutes. Data recovery takes time to troubleshoot."

Oliver Lancelot immediately fell silent, his gaze involuntarily flickering toward Adrian Klein.

After a moment's hesitation, he leaned in and whispered, "Professor Klein, I was right there when it shut down. It really was an accident. Camille stayed up two nights straight inputting data..."

Adrian pressed his fingertips to his temples. "I won't jump to conclusions before the investigation."
He only trusted evidence, not hearsay.

Natalie Blanchet tugged at Oliver's sleeve.
Oliver pressed his lips together and swallowed the rest of his words.

Twenty minutes later, the technician removed his glasses. "The data corruption was caused by a virus. Aside from the existing backups, the rest is probably..."

The lab's atmosphere instantly froze.
Adrian's gaze sharpened. "Personal devices are banned in the lab. Where did the virus come from?"

"This type of hybrid virus has multiple transmission vectors." The technician shook his head. "Surveillance systems, access control systems—any could be the medium."

Camille Valrose clenched her fists. "How long to trace the virus source?"
"That depends on the specifics."

Natalie's eyes reddened with urgency. "Is the data really unrecoverable?"
"Once the motherboard's damaged, not even a miracle can save it."

Camille's voice trembled. "This is my fault for not backing up in time..."
Silence fell, leaving only the hum of the mainframe.

Adrian suddenly remembered something. "It connected to my work computer on Friday."
The technician immediately pulled up the transfer logs. "There's hope! We can recover some data!"

Half an hour later, two-thirds of the data was successfully restored.
Natalie asked unwillingly, "What about the rest..."

"If it's from the last two days," Evelyn Langley suddenly spoke up, "we can use the AI recorder function on Sun terminals."

The technician slapped his thigh. "Right! They launched that feature six months ago!"

Everyone exchanged glances.
Adrian frowned slightly. "But the AI isn't fully developed yet. It can only perform keyword searches."
###Chapter 216

The lab was silent.

Oliver Lancelot's fingers danced across the keyboard. The screen displayed nothing but blank space.

"The data can't be recovered." He shook his head. "Without knowing the exact missing content, we can't conduct a precise search."

Vincent Macmillan adjusted his glasses. "We'd need to recall at least one-tenth of the data volume."

"One-tenth?" Oliver's eyes widened. "That's three complete sets of experimental data!"

Camille Valrose let out a cold laugh. "Who could possibly remember that?" Her gaze slid pointedly toward Evelyn Langley. "Some people will say anything to show off."

Evelyn stood by the lab bench, her fingertips lightly tracing the table's surface.

"I can try."

Oliver gasped dramatically. "You?" He pointed at the computer screen. "Even we who conducted the experiments can't recall this data. You're just an outsider—"

Adrian Klein frowned slightly, though his gaze remained gentle. "Are you sure?"

"Yes."

"One question." Adrian took a step closer. "How would you know our experimental data?"

Evelyn turned to look at Camille.

Camille exploded. "Why are you looking at me?" Her voice turned shrill. "The professor asked you a question!"

Confusion flickered across the faces of the other lab members.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "At noon two days ago, I found a report near Lab Station Three." She paused. "It had footprints on it. I thought it had been discarded."

Every pair of eyes swiveled toward Camille.

Lab Station Three was her designated workspace.
###Chapter 217

Camille Valrose's face twisted in anger. Her voice rose sharply. "Evelyn Langley, how dare you make such baseless accusations! I entered every single report from our team into the system. Not a single one is missing!"

Her trembling finger pointed at the computer screen. "Check the entry logs if you don't believe me. The system crash lost a lot of data, but these records are still intact!"

She ground her teeth together. "Stop trying to frame me!"

Evelyn let out a soft hum. "They weren't lost. Because when I picked them up from the trash, I noticed the date was current. So I put them back."

Camille's entire body shook with rage. "Then why accuse me of losing reports? First you say you found them on the floor, then claim you returned them. You're contradicting yourself!"

Evelyn remained calm. "First, I merely stated facts. I said I saw a report on the floor, picked it up, and returned it. I never specified who lost it. No one else jumped to conclusions either. You're overreacting."

"That's exactly what you implied!"

"Second," Evelyn raised her voice slightly, "if you think I'm lying, retrieve that report. Check if there are footprints on the cover."

Camille sneered. "Don't you know all paper reports get shredded after entry?"

Evelyn remained unruffled. "No matter. The lab has surveillance. Pull the footage from 11 AM to noon two days ago. Then we'll see who's telling the truth."

All color drained from Camille's face.

She had indeed seen a report with footprints that afternoon.

After finishing data entry, she'd been relieved to spot the overlooked document and quickly inputted the missing data.

Adrian Klein took one look at Camille's expression and understood.

He quickly intervened. "We're all colleagues here. No need for such hostility."

"Our priority is recovering the lost data. Evelyn mentioned AI searches require extensive keywords, but..."

Oliver Lancelot trailed off.

Who could possibly remember that much data?

Adrian turned directly to Evelyn. "You said you looked at the report when you picked it up?"

"Yes."

"How much do you recall?"

"All of it."

The conference room filled with sharp intakes of breath.

Adrian's expression didn't change. "Can this report's data serve as AI search keywords?"

"Correct."

"Good." He opened his laptop. "Dictate. I'll transcribe."

Evelyn began reciting. "Thickness, unit micrometers, standard value 25.0-26.0, testing method..."

"MD tear resistance, unit grams, standard value 165.1314362, testing method..."

Vincent Macmillan and Natalie Blanchet exchanged glances.

She actually remembered everything?

Oliver's expression shifted from doubt to shock, ending in pure admiration.

This memory was terrifying!

Evelyn spoke continuously for twenty minutes. Adrian recorded 1,192 data points.

He imported them into the AI system and pressed enter.

Ten seconds later, the screen populated with numerous related data entries.

Natalie shouted excitedly. "Master! Come check if these are the right ones..."

The senior technician examined the screen and worked briefly. "We've recovered a batch of data. But I can't confirm if it's what you need. Someone should verify..."
###Chapter 218

Camille Valrose hurried to the computer. The repair technician tactfully vacated the seat.

The progress bar crawled upward on the screen. Only the clatter of keyboards filled the lab.

Natalie Blanchet stamped her foot impatiently. "How much data has been recovered?"

Camille stared at the monitor, her nails digging unconsciously into her palms. "...Almost all of it."

Natalie peered at the screen and broke into a grin. "Perfect! Ninety-nine percent recovered!"

She threw her arms around Evelyn Langley. "Thank goodness you thought of this solution. We'd have been pulling an all-nighter otherwise!"

"Typical Harvard genius," the technician said, giving a thumbs-up. "Brilliant move."

Vincent Macmillan's eyes sparkled. "Evelyn, you're our savior!"

He suddenly winked mischievously. "Professor Klein clearly has an eye for talent, recruiting you so early."

Adrian Klein's expression remained neutral, but his knuckles whitened imperceptibly.

Catching himself, he relaxed his fist, unable to suppress the ripple of emotion in his chest.

Oliver Lancelot circled Evelyn twice. "Are you some kind of hidden prodigy?"

Evelyn: "..."

Natalie and Vincent burst into laughter.

Only Camille stood in the shadows, her gaze dark enough to drip venom.

Natalie glanced around—
Adrian massaged his temples in exasperation.
Oliver stole glances at Camille.
Camille fixed Evelyn with a death glare.

Suddenly, the lab felt more dramatic than a soap opera.

She made a mental note to bring popcorn to work tomorrow.

......

The computer virus incident was serious.

At best, an accident. At worst, a security breach.

Adrian's voice turned icy. "This requires a full investigation."

The technician nodded. "The university has already launched an inquiry."

By the time they wrapped up, city lights glittered outside the windows.

As the team dispersed, Adrian stayed behind to finalize things.

Evelyn returned alone to her apartment and collapsed onto the sofa.

Her phone buzzed suddenly.

A message from Adrian appeared:
«Found the virus source. Thanks for today.»

Evelyn bolted upright:
«That fast?»
###Chapter 219

Evelyn Langley stared at her phone screen, brows furrowed.

"Did you find out who it was?"

Adrian Klein's voice came through the receiver. "The person wore a mask and hat—couldn't see their face. But it's definitely someone from Harvard."

Her grip tightened around the phone.

If it was a virus this time, next time it could be something far more dangerous.

A low chuckle suddenly sounded from the other end.

IT department colleagues exchanged confused glances at Adrian's unexpected laughter.

The eerie sound sent chills down their spines.

"Alright, I'll follow your lead," Adrian replied softly.

Evelyn's lips curved upward unconsciously. She set the phone down and headed toward the bathroom.

......

Nathan Evans jolted awake from a splitting headache.

Darkness pressed against the windows.

He'd slept through an entire day.

Familiar stomach cramps seized him. He mechanically opened the nightstand drawer for antacids. Ice-cold water burned his throat, sending shivers through his body.

"Pills aren't food. I made yam and pork rib soup for you..."

"Too salty? I'll use less salt next time..."

"Can you drink less tonight? Your stomach just started healing..."

"Nathan, please don't drink so much. It hurts to watch..."

"If you come home drunk again, I swear I'll be furious!"

"Today's perch and tofu soup—you're finishing every drop... Mmph! Always using that move..."

"Nathan Evans! Kissing me won't get you out of this!"

......

"Stop drinking."

......

"I hate the smell of alcohol on you."

......

"There's congee in the pot. I'm going to bed."

......

Memories flooded in like tidal waves.

Evelyn had once cared so deeply about his health.

At first, she'd nagged like an overbearing housekeeper, but always followed her scolding with warm soup.

On good days, he'd silence her with kisses.

On bad days, he'd snap at her.

Gradually, she stopped lecturing—just quietly prepared hangover remedies.

He'd mistaken her silence for maturity.

Now he understood it was the silence of utter disappointment.

The drawer overflowed with empty pill boxes, a stark reminder of how long it had been since anyone cooked for him.

One day. Two days...

Three months. Half a year...

Each memory cut deeper than the last.

The door creaked open.

Chloe Valentine entered with a tray, her face brightening when she saw him awake. "Nathan, you're finally up. I made congee and some side dishes..."
###Chapter 220

"Who gave you permission to enter?"

Nathan's icy voice sent a shiver down Chloe's spine.

Her hands trembled slightly as she held the tray. "I...I noticed you didn't eat dinner..."

"Get out."

The man didn't even look up, his slender fingers continuing to flip through documents.

"Nathan, I—"

"Do I need to repeat myself?"

Chloe's eyes instantly welled up, the soup bowl on the tray clinking softly.

Nathan finally lifted his gaze, his eyes sharp as daggers. "Remember this—you don't step into this room without my permission."

"But this is the master bedroom..." Her voice cracked.

"Master bedroom?" Nathan sneered. "You think you deserve it?"

Chloe staggered back, nearly dropping the tray.

Nathan watched her coldly, his expression dripping with disdain.

"Take that away."

Biting her lip, Chloe turned to leave.

"Wait."

She spun around hopefully.

"Your perfume is disgusting."

Chloe fled in humiliation.

In the hallway, the housekeeper approached. "Madam, the young master still refuses to eat?"

Chloe instantly smoothed her expression into gentleness. "Yes, I'll think of another way. Please take these away for now."

She ascended the stairs gracefully, but around the corner, her nails dug into her palms until they turned red.

Light seeped from beneath the master bedroom door.

She swore she would claim that room.

Late into the night, Nathan unexpectedly stayed home.

Chloe heard the sounds of a meal being delivered next door.

She clenched the bedsheet.

Was she less important than a servant?

Her phone suddenly rang.

"Chloe! Are you okay?" Her roommate Emily's voice was frantic.

Chloe frowned. "Why wouldn't I be?"

"You've missed two weeks of classes! The professor said he'll mark you absent—"

"Whatever." Chloe cut her off impatiently.

"But—"

"Were those designer bags I gave you not enough?"

She hung up abruptly.

Staring at her phone, Chloe dialed another number.

"What?" The voice on the other end was glacial.

"That drug...can you still get it?" she whispered.
###Chapter 221

"The kind that... excites men..."

Silence filled the other end of the line before a soft chuckle came through. "Have you really sunk so low that you need drugs to attract a man's attention?"

Chloe Valentine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white. "Spare me the lecture. Can you get it or not?"

"Wait."

The call ended abruptly.

Chloe lay back on the plush bed, staring at the ornate crystal chandelier above. This level of luxury was something she'd never dared dream of before.

Now that she'd tasted it, she'd never let go.

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Langley finished tidying her apartment and packed a lunch box.

In the lab, her slender frame was accentuated by the white coat as she meticulously recorded data.

The "Save Successful" chime sounded. Rubbing her stiff shoulders, she retrieved the lunchbox from the fridge.

"Something smells amazing!" Natalie Blanchet followed the aroma. "What did you bring today, Evelyn?"

Inside the container, golden lemon chicken wings sat beside vibrant garlic broccoli.

"Want to try?" Evelyn offered chopsticks.

Natalie eagerly grabbed a wing. Her eyes lit up at the first bite. "Oh my god! This is incredible!"

The crispy exterior gave way to tender meat, with lemon perfectly cutting through the richness.

"No way." Oliver Lancelot approached, eyeing the food hungrily. "I already ate lunch, but..."

"I'm making sweet and sour ribs tomorrow," Evelyn said with a smile.

"C-can I reserve a portion?" Oliver rubbed his hands together hopefully.

Natalie suddenly suggested, "Why don't we have dinner at Evelyn's place tonight?"

"Sounds great!" Vincent Macmillan looked up from his microscope. "Should we invite Professor Klein?"

"I'll check." Natalie pulled out her phone. "His last lecture should be ending soon."

Evelyn smiled faintly as she organized equipment. These ordinary moments held a quiet warmth.
###Chapter 222

At exactly 2 PM, Evelyn Langley hit save and closed the experimental data document. She returned the test tube rack to its place, hung her lab coat behind the door, and quietly locked the lab.

Around the corner of the hallway, Adrian Klein leaned against the windowsill scrolling through his phone. Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting dappled shadows across his profile.

"Grocery shopping?" He pocketed his phone, his gaze landing on the shopping list in her hand.

Evelyn paused mid-step. "How did you know?"

"Vincent posted in the group chat." Adrian took two steps closer. "I'll drive you."

"?"

"The supermarket's a bit far." He jingled his car keys. "I'm heading that way anyway."

"No classes today?"

"Rescheduled."

Truthfully, he didn't need to—but he wanted to.

"Thanks, then." Evelyn exhaled in relief. She'd been calculating ride-share fares; this saved her the trouble.

Inside the supermarket, Adrian pushed the cart while Evelyn checked items off her list. Each time she picked something, he naturally took it from her and placed it in the cart.

At checkout, Adrian swiped his card first. All the grocery bags ended up in his hands, heavy and dangling.

"Let me take some." Evelyn reached for them.

Adrian sidestepped. "Not heavy."

Back home, Evelyn tied up her hair and donned an apron to prep the ingredients. As water rushed from the faucet, she suddenly turned. "Any dietary restrictions I should know about?"

Adrian was peeling garlic. "Vincent's allergic to seafood. The rest are fine."

He washed his hands and stood beside her at the counter. "What can I help with?"

......

By 6 PM, the lab team was ready to leave.

"Professor Macmillan, does Professor Klein know the address?" Camille Valrose asked casually. She'd initially declined the invitation—until seeing Adrian's "I'll be there" in the group chat.

Oliver Lancelot gave his junior a pleased look, assuming his persuasion had worked.

Vincent Macmillan scrolled through his phone. "Sent it ages ago. Strange—he hasn't been back to the lab all afternoon."

"But if he said he's coming, he will. Might head straight there."

Natalie Blanchet's eyes widened. "He's really coming?"

Vincent teased, "What, scared?"

"Who's scared!" Natalie pouted. "It's just... everyone acts so restrained around him..."

"And how exactly did you plan to misbehave?" Vincent laughed. "Good thing he's coming to keep you in check."

"You're the one who needs keeping in check!"

Passing a florist, Natalie was drawn to a cluster of white jasmine, carefully selecting a bouquet. Vincent and Oliver pooled money for two boxes of imported cherries, exquisitely packaged.

The biggest surprise was Camille's gift—a petite perfume bottle.

"Citrus top notes, subtle dry-down." Her tone was even. "Suits you."

"Thank you." Evelyn accepted it, catching a whiff of fresh scent lingering on her fingers.

Natalie craned her neck. "Where's Professor Klein? Should we call him?" She eyed the spread of dishes, the aromas making her fidget.

Vincent had just pulled out his phone when the kitchen door swung open. Adrian emerged carrying a steaming soup bowl, apron strings tied neatly behind him. His movements were practiced, like a regular guest.

Vincent: ?
Everyone: !
###Chapter 223

Natalie Blanchet's tongue seemed tied in knots, unable to squeeze out a single word.

The lab members exchanged glances, the air so thick with tension you could wring water from it.

"P-Professor..." Oliver Lancelot's gaze darted between Adrian Klein and Evelyn Langley like he'd discovered a new continent.

Camille Valrose's lips pressed into a tight line, frost gathering in her eyes.

"Adrian, what kind of show are you putting on?" Vincent Macmillan broke the silence bluntly.

Adrian rested his slender fingers against the doorframe. "Helping out. Isn't it obvious?"

"Helping all the way to Evelyn's apartment? How... thoughtful." Vincent teased.

Adrian arched an eyebrow. "Better a good neighbor than some people waiting to be served."

"Neighbor? What do you mean?"

Evelyn quickly explained, "Professor Klein lives across the hall. This afternoon when I left the lab to buy groceries, I ran into him driving to the supermarket. He gave me a ride."

"Oh." Natalie exhaled in relief.

For a moment she'd thought there was something shady going on between them!

Oliver wiped cold sweat from his brow. Thank goodness it was just a misunderstanding.

The gloom lifted from Camille's face. "Should we eat?"

"Yes, yes!" Natalie nodded eagerly.

Evelyn gestured, "Everyone take a seat. Just two more dishes coming right up!"

The atmosphere at the table gradually warmed.

Natalie raved about the sweet and sour ribs while Oliver devoured three bowls of rice.

Even diet-conscious Camille couldn't resist an extra half portion.

Damn that spicy fish—it was too good with rice...

After dinner, Evelyn saw the guests out.

To be precise, Evelyn and Adrian saw the guests out together.

Though they knew the two were just neighbors, their side-by-side figures created an oddly harmonious picture.

Natalie kept glancing back, sensing something amiss.

Oliver hovered near Camille. "It's late—let me walk you home?"

"No need. I drove."

"Then... be careful."

Camille got in her car but didn't start the engine immediately. She scrolled through her contacts and dialed a number.

"Still in real estate?"

"Just scraping by. What brings you to me?"

Camille bit her lower lip. "I want to rent an apartment near Harvard. Must be a walk-up, close to the library."

"A walk-up? You sure?"

The voice on the other end clearly hesitated.

"Positive."

"The only place matching that... is the old faculty housing by the south gate."

Camille's eyes lit up. "Perfect!"

"But the area's run down, no property management..."

"Doesn't matter. Find it quickly."

Hanging up, Camille gripped the steering wheel.

If Evelyn Langley could do it, so could Camille Valrose.
###Chapter 224

......

After seeing off their friends, Evelyn Langley and Adrian Klein walked side by side back to campus.

"Evelyn."

That familiar voice made her pause mid-step.

Across the street, Ethan Winston leaned against his car door, waving at her.

Adrian adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his expression unreadable.

Ethan strode across the crosswalk, the hem of his suit jacket fluttering in the breeze.

"I was just coming to find you upstairs. What a coincidence."

"Something urgent?"

"Yes." His face turned serious. "Can we talk somewhere private?"

Evelyn glanced at Adrian. Ethan's gaze followed hers.

"Professor Klein. Fancy meeting you here."

"Not at all." Adrian's voice remained calm. "If you're looking for her, you'd naturally run into me."

Their eyes locked in a silent battle of wills.

"Half an hour enough?" Evelyn checked her watch.

"Plenty."

"Let's go to the bubble tea shop across the street."

Between class periods, the shop stood nearly empty.

Evelyn cut to the chase. "What's this about?"

Ethan pulled a folder from his briefcase. "Supplementary materials about those two accidents in the Maldives."

"The legal team initially left them out due to insufficient evidence."

"But I believe you deserve the full truth."

As Evelyn scanned the documents, her frown deepened.

"Notice anything?" Ethan pointed to red-circled sections. "Neither the oxygen tank malfunction nor the snake attack could've been orchestrated alone."

"The security footage timeline confirms it."

"She had an accomplice?"

"Highly likely." Ethan steepled his fingers. "Though it's too late for investigations now."

The domestic police had long closed the case.

"But you needed to know." His gaze burned with intensity. "Chloe Valentine might have backup."

"Keep your distance from her. Stay safe."

"Call me anytime." His sudden grin held boyish charm. "I've got nothing but free time these days."

Evelyn chuckled. "The mighty CEO Ethan Winston, idle? I wouldn't dare impose."

"For you?" He leaned closer. "I'll always make time."

"Only for you."

The heat in his stare made her ears burn.

"I should get back." She stood abruptly.

Ethan grabbed his coat. "I'll walk you."

Stepping outside, they both froze.

Adrian remained exactly where they'd left him, posture straight as a pine.
###Chapter 225

Ethan Winston's gaze lingered on Adrian Klein for less than a second.

He knew exactly what that look meant.

It was the primal possessiveness of a predator toward its prey.

Ethan suddenly turned.

Evelyn Langley nearly collided with his chest in surprise.

"Careful." His hand hovered near her elbow without touching.

As she steadied herself, a cup of hot milk tea appeared in her hands.

"For me?"

"Who else?" Ethan arched an eyebrow. "See anyone around?"

Evelyn examined the label. "When did you order this?"

"Trade secret."

"Mr. Winston must be quite skilled at pleasing women."

"Only you."

A faint blush crept up Evelyn's ears as she instinctively stepped back.

Amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes.

Pushing too hard would only scare the prey away.

"Shall I walk you to your building?"

"No need." Evelyn refused immediately.

He nodded, watching until she safely crossed the street before leaving.

At the campus gate, Evelyn spotted Adrian beneath a ginkgo tree.

"Professor Klein?"

"Waiting for you." His eyes dropped to her drink. "You like this?"

"Occasionally."

"I've never tried it." His tone remained neutral. "No idea how it tastes."

Evelyn hesitated. "Would you... like this one?"

"Thank you." As Adrian accepted the cup, his fingertips brushed her knuckles.

She jerked her hand back like she'd been burned.

Meanwhile, Ethan's car idled at a red light.

His car phone rang.

"Ethan!" Dylan Lowell's voice blared over thumping music. "What've you been up to?"

"Working."

"That's it?" Dylan lowered his voice. "No... romantic developments?"

Ethan scoffed. "Tell Nathan to ask me himself."

A commotion erupted on the line.

"What?" Dylan forced a laugh. "Just checking in."

"Really?" Ethan tapped the steering wheel. "Perfect. Put me on speaker."
###Chapter 226

Dylan's hand trembled slightly as he gripped the phone.

"Is the speaker on? Can everyone hear me clearly?" Ethan's voice crackled through the speakers. "Then I'll begin."

Nathan's cigarette snapped between his fingers.

"Latest update—" Ethan deliberately drew out the words, "Just left her place. She accepted the milk tea I brought. Need me to elaborate?"

"An hour ago, we were having a heart-to-heart at the milk tea shop near her apartment."

"Every word's true. Feel free to verify."

Dylan stole a glance at the stormy expression on the man beside him, sweat beading on his forehead.

Ethan continued mercilessly, "Should I repeat that? So someone can record it and savor it later."

Dylan fumbled to end the call.

"Nathan..." He attempted damage control, "Ethan might just be joking..."

Nathan turned and kicked open the private room door.

Julian arched an eyebrow at Dylan: What fresh hell is this?

Dylan shook his head helplessly.

"Bring the liquor." Nathan's voice was glacial. "We're drinking till dawn."

...

2 AM. Empty bottles littered the floor.

Nathan slumped over the bar counter, murmuring drunkenly, "Evelyn..."

Julian exhaled a smoke ring. "Here we go again."

"Yeah."

"Serves him right." Julian smirked coldly. "Played the heartless bastard during the breakup. Now he's putting on this lovesick act."

Dylan intervened quickly, "Let's get him back to the hotel."

...

A shrill ringtone shattered the morning silence.

"Who?" Nathan growled, grabbing the phone.

"Young master, Miss Chloe says she has stomach pains..." Mrs. Watson's voice trembled with worry.

"Call a doctor." He hung up without hesitation.

The phone rang again.

"The doctor says a pregnant woman's emotions affect the fetus..."

Nathan cursed as he hauled himself up.

...

Chloe adjusted her dress before the mirror.

The off-shoulder design showcased her delicate collarbones, while the satin fabric hugged her curves. She caressed her flat stomach with a triumphant smile.

The doorbell chimed.

"Nathan!" She greeted him in a honeyed voice. "You came back to me."
###Chapter 227

Nathan narrowed his eyes, his gaze sharp as a blade sweeping over her. "Stomachache? You seem perfectly fine to me."

Chloe shivered under his scrutiny, feeling completely exposed.

"With you gone, I had no one to talk to..."

He cut her off with a cold laugh. "If you're bored, study for your graduate exams. Stop wasting time on nonsense."

"I saw Mrs. Watson tending the garden. Go help her."

Chloe bit her lip, not daring to argue.

Nathan's eyes were frosty. He'd seen through her pathetic act.

As he turned to leave, a warm body suddenly pressed against his back.

"Nathan, don't go..." She clung to his waist. "I missed you. Stay with me, please? Even if you hate me, think about our baby..."

He wrenched her hands away, disgust twisting his features. "Don't use the child as leverage! I told you to abort it, yet you ran crying to my mother. We're not done with that."

Her eyes darted nervously. "I was wrong..."

"Know your place and behave. Or get out now."

He strode upstairs without a backward glance.

Chloe took a deep breath, nails digging into her palms.

She couldn't give up.

Too much had been sacrificed to marry Nathan Evans.

No retreat.

Three seconds later, her face smoothed into composure.

Remembering his habit of drinking pumpkin porridge after business dinners—and smelling the alcohol on him—she hatched a plan.

Master Bedroom—

After drinking the hangover tea Mrs. Watson brought, Nathan drifted back into a heavy sleep.

He woke at 3 PM to stabbing hunger pangs. Grim-faced, he went downstairs.

"Mrs. Watson, make me something to eat."

Silence.

He raised his voice. "Mrs. Watson—"

"Nathan, your stomach must hurt. I made pumpkin porridge..." Chloe hurried from the kitchen with a bowl.

The bowl went flying before she finished.

"Ah!"

Scalding porridge splattered the rug, burning her hand.

"Who said you could interfere?" His mocking stare pinned her.

Tears welled in her eyes. "I just wanted to help..."

She bowed her head, slender neck exposed, the picture of fragility.

Nathan remained unmoved.

"Stop the act. Even my cat knows how to please its master. You're worse than an animal."

"I truly love you—"

He kicked the shattered bowl aside. The crash made her flinch.

"Disappear in three seconds, or I'll have you thrown out permanently."
###Chapter 228

Chloe Valentine shuddered, her breath catching in her throat.

She stumbled up the stairs without daring to look back.

......

The lab's atmosphere had subtly shifted.

Since the last team dinner, Evelyn Langley noticed her colleagues' gazes had softened.

The credit went to her daily homemade lunches.

Her perfectly seasoned dishes had won everyone over.

In return, Natalie Blanchet and others often helped her troubleshoot experiments.

The most dramatic change was in Vincent Macmillan.

After Evelyn flawlessly reconstructed his mental calculation theory, the math enthusiast's eyes lit up with newfound respect.

Now he seized every opportunity to teach her advanced calculation techniques.

Evelyn absorbed the lessons with startling speed.

Methods taught in morning sessions were mastered by afternoon.

Vincent vibrated with excitement like an artisan discovering uncut jade.

"Struck gold, have you?" Natalie teased.

"Professor, take me as your protégé too!" Oliver Lancelot raised his hand dramatically.

Vincent didn't glance up. "Finish your data analysis first."

Laughter rippled through the lab.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, eyes crinkling into crescents.

She missed Adrian Klein calling her name three times.

"Evelyn Langley!"

"Yes, Professor Klein?"

"My office. Now."

......

At dawn the next day,

Vincent stared blankly at a thick stack of documents.

Natalie leaned in. "Trouble? Did the director reprimand you?"

"New research focus." He sighed. "No more time for Evelyn's lessons."

This project demanded his exclusive attention.

Though regrettable, lab priorities came first.

Natalie patted his shoulder. "The capable bear the burden."

......

Saturday sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Evelyn had just set down her bag when her phone rang.

"Eve! Emergency!" Sophia Laurent's panicked voice crackled through. "My cousin's wedding—Mom's dragging me gift shopping, but my project's at the critical phase—"

"You want me to accompany your mother?"

"You read my mind! She adores you—always says she wishes you were her daughter."

Evelyn chuckled. "What time tomorrow?"

......

Adrian massaged his temples.

After thirty-six consecutive work hours, dizziness blurred his vision.

His key had barely touched the lock when the opposite door swung open.
###Chapter 229

Evelyn Langley stood drowsily at the doorway, still clad in her fuzzy teddy bear pajamas.

She rubbed her reddened eyes and let out a long yawn.

"Did I wake you?" Adrian Klein lowered his voice. The old apartment's thin walls carried every sound, even footsteps from the hallway.

Evelyn shook her head, her voice husky from sleep. "It's 6:30. I needed to get up anyway."

She had plans to accompany Eleanor Roland shopping in the afternoon, leaving only the morning to review research papers.

Adrian's tone softened unconsciously at her tired expression. "It's still early. You could sleep a bit longer."

His words met Evelyn's probing gaze.

"What's wrong?"

"Are you sick?"

Adrian blinked, then gave a wry smile. "That obvious?"

"Your voice is hoarse. Do you have a fever?"

He touched his forehead. "Can't tell. Probably not."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Professor Klein, 'probably not' doesn't sound like something you'd say."

"No thermometer at home..."

"I have one. Go back inside. I'll bring it over."

Adrian nodded and returned to his apartment.

Evelyn found the thermometer, carefully sterilized it, then crossed the hall.

When she pushed open his door, she froze.

The usually meticulous professor lay on the sofa with his shoes still on, brows slightly furrowed.

"Professor Klein?" she called softly.

Getting no response, she stepped closer. "Professor?"

Suddenly, his eyes opened.

Their gazes locked.

Evelyn's face was mere inches away, her eyelashes fluttering like startled butterflies.

Adrian's heartbeat skipped.

"You scared me." Evelyn exhaled in relief, handing him the thermometer. "Let's check."

103°F high fever.

"You need the hospital."

"Just medicine will do."

"Do you have any?"

Silence.

Evelyn sighed. "I'll get some."

After ensuring he took the medication, she returned from washing the glass to find him already asleep.

She quietly draped a blanket over him and tiptoed out.

......

Chloe Valentine stood nervously clutching her purse strap outside the mall.

Nathan Evans' cold indifference left her helpless.

Everything she did seemed wrong in his eyes.

But she wouldn't surrender.

After learning Margaret Evans' whereabouts from Mrs. Watson, she'd arrived early to stage an "accidental" meeting.
###Chapter 230

Margaret Evans hadn't gone shopping in ages.

Today's exception was made when a boutique sales consultant called, informing her about newly arrived limited-edition handbags and custom couture. They'd reserved a private appointment slot just for her.

Unexpectedly, she ran into Chloe Valentine at the store.

Since they'd crossed paths, they naturally browsed together.

This time Chloe proved more considerate. She promptly swiped her card for several limited-edition bags Margaret fancied.

Though it was Nathan Evans' supplementary card, it still beat last time's measly scarf gift.

They wandered into a high-end couture boutique.

The sharp-eyed sales associate instantly recognized Margaret as a regular. "Madam, these just arrived. They'd complement your elegance perfectly."

Margaret wore a Chanel classic suit today, diamond necklace glinting at her throat, every gesture exuding aristocratic grace.

"Let me try these two."

Chloe had just spent hundreds of thousands without flinching externally, though internally she bled. Normally she hesitated over buying a single bag.

Despite having Nathan's supplementary card, to maintain her pure image she only used it for prenatal checkups. Even clothing purchases required deliberation.

Those Hermès bags in the villa's walk-in closet? Nathan had explicitly forbidden her from touching them.

Margaret shot her a sidelong glance.

She saw right through the girl's act.

Petty.

Too timid to spend freely, coveting things yet pretending otherwise. What false purity.

Margaret couldn't be bothered. With a careless wave: "Pick whatever you like."

Chloe feigned refusal: "No need, Auntie..."

"Suit yourself." Margaret's tone turned frosty.

Chloe froze.

This wasn't how she'd imagined the interaction.

Just then, a salesgirl's delighted voice carried from the entrance: "Madam Laurent! We were about to deliver the new collection for your selection!"

Margaret's pulse jumped. She turned to see Eleanor Roland.

Eleanor wore a pale qipao with pearl shawl, bamboo-handled bag dangling from her wrist—an image of refined elegance.

Though past forty, meticulous upkeep made her appear barely thirty. Among Boston's elite socialites, Eleanor always commanded attention.

Margaret particularly loathed sharing spaces with her.

"Madam Laurent, long time no see." Margaret forced a smile.

Eleanor gave a faint nod, her gaze sliding past to beckon behind her: "Evelyn, come here."

Her voice instantly softened eight degrees.
###Chapter 231

"She's here." Evelyn Langley had just stepped out of the restroom when Eleanor Roland waved at her.

Margaret Evans froze.

Following Eleanor's gaze, she saw a familiar face.

Evelyn Langley!

Chloe Valentine spotted her too.

Today, Evelyn wore light makeup with a beige trench coat and brown suede boots. Her hair was casually pinned up with a hair claw.

She exuded a relaxed, effortless elegance, like a graceful feline.

"Mrs. Roland." Evelyn linked arms with Eleanor. "Have you been waiting long?"

She completely ignored Margaret and Chloe.

Margaret thought of how her son still pined for her, and fury ignited in her chest.

Chloe seized the moment to hand Margaret a teacup. "Auntie, have some water."

Margaret beamed. "Our Chloe is so thoughtful. Unlike some people who lack basic manners."

Eleanor arched a brow. "And this is...?" She glanced at Chloe.

Margaret hesitated.

The baby in Chloe's belly belonged to the Evans family, but she had no legitimate status.

How could she introduce her?

If word got out that she'd been shopping with her son's mistress, how could she ever face her social circle again?

Chloe watched her expectantly.

What she cared about most was recognition.

After spending so much today to please Margaret, surely she deserved some acknowledgment?

"The child of a friend," Margaret said with a strained smile.

Chloe's smile stiffened.

Eleanor let out a knowing "Oh." "I thought she might be the future Mrs. Evans."

"Nathan isn't seeing anyone," Margaret quickly denied.

Eleanor turned to Evelyn. "Help me pick out some outfits?"

"Of course." Evelyn moved to browse the racks with practiced ease.

Eleanor sighed pointedly. "Someone will be lucky to marry a girl like Evelyn."

Her eyes flicked to Chloe. "Young women should have self-respect. An unplanned pregnancy tarnishes even the prettiest face."

Margaret's expression darkened.

Chloe clenched her fists.

She couldn't match Evelyn's education, and now she didn't even have a title.

A sales associate approached with garments.

Chloe suddenly stepped forward. "Let me take those."
###Chapter 232

Margaret Evans eyed Chloe Valentine with equal suspicion.

Chloe flashed a saccharine smile. "Auntie, would you like me to pick some outfits for you too?"

Margaret glanced at Eleanor Roland trying on clothes and scoffed inwardly. As if having a personal stylist was special. She had one too!

Her face instantly brightened. "Of course, dear. I trust your taste."

She conveniently forgot how she'd mocked Chloe's "tacky" fashion sense just weeks prior.

Chloe sprang into action, weaving through clothing racks while bossing sales associates around with theatrical flair.

Evelyn Langley worked differently.

She meticulously examined each garment's cut, gently tested fabric quality between her fingers, then selected a few pieces for the attendant.

"Aunt Eleanor, I chose these two sets. Would you like to try them?"

Eleanor accepted the clothes eagerly, eyes sparkling.

She adored Evelyn's selections—each ensemble perfectly aligned with her aesthetic.

Truthfully, she enjoyed shopping with Evelyn more than with her own daughter.

Some connections just clicked.

Chloe reappeared. "Auntie, I've picked yours too."

Margaret entered the fitting room.

She emerged first in a red spaghetti-strap dress paired with a Chanel-style jacket—an ensemble that did make her appear younger.

After a satisfied twirl before the mirror, she nodded. "Not bad."

Chloe demurred, "It's your figure, Auntie. You're slimmer than me."

Margaret's smirk froze when Eleanor stepped out from the adjacent booth.

Evelyn had selected a pale teal modernized qipao with subtle bamboo embroidery—understated yet exquisite.

The tailored silhouette accentuated Eleanor's statuesque frame, elevating her natural grace.

By comparison, Margaret looked like an aging socialite desperately clinging to youth.

The second outfits magnified the contrast.

Chloe had been confident in her selections.

Margaret's petite frame limited options, and she'd done her best.

But Evelyn's styling was transcendent.

Eleanor's innate elegance made Margaret's designer pieces appear garish by comparison.

Eleanor gasped at her reflection. "Mianmian, I've never worn this style before, but I love it! How did you know?"

The silk camisole and wide-leg black trousers radiated effortless power.

Statement silver earrings added an edge of rebellious charm.

If the first look embodied grace, this one screamed confidence.
###Chapter 233

Evelyn Langley adjusted the collar of her cheongsam. "This style is too rigid. Why not try something more casual?"

Margaret Evans' face darkened, her nails digging into her palms.

Chloe Valentine bit her lower lip, her fingertips trembling.

Eleanor Roland caught their expressions and smirked. "Some people mistake glass for diamonds. How amusing."

"Wrap both sets," she said, beckoning the sales associate.

The associate beamed as she accepted the credit card.

"Evelyn, let's check the next boutique."

"Alright."

After they left, Margaret stared at her reflection, chest heaving.

Chloe hunched her shoulders. "Pregnancy makes me so tired. I was up all night taking care of Nathan..."

Margaret's gaze flicked to Chloe's slight baby bump as she suppressed her rage.

"With your taste, how could you ever belong in the Evans family?"

Chloe's eyes lit up.

"I'll study hard to improve."

Margaret tossed a gilded invitation at her. "Tea appreciation gathering tomorrow. Don't embarrass me."

Chloe clutched it like treasure.

......

Outside the mall, Eleanor linked arms with Evelyn. "I need a favor."

"Of course."

"I'm hosting a tea party and need an expert." Eleanor winked. "Your Phoenix Oolong is legendary."
###Chapter 234

The veteran tea master at Qinhuayuan suffered a sudden heart attack and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance in the early hours. Eleanor Roland froze when she received the call.

"Tomorrow's the tea appreciation gathering. Where am I supposed to find a replacement now?" She paced the living room, phone clutched in her hand.

Then she remembered Sophia Laurent mentioning Evelyn Langley's exceptional tea skills.

"...Sophia said you know tea ceremony and can perform Gongfu tea?" Eleanor tentatively made the call. "Auntie has no other options. Could you possibly save the event?"

Silence lingered on the other end.

"I'll try." Evelyn's voice remained soft and gentle.

Eleanor exhaled in relief and immediately sent the hotel location.

That evening, Evelyn knocked on Adrian Klein's study door.

"Professor, I'll be substituting at the Bulgari Hotel tomorrow afternoon." She showed him her phone. "This is the address."

Adrian glanced at the screen.

"Perfect. I have a meeting nearby tomorrow." He adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "I'll pick you up afterward."

Sunlight streamed through the windows the next day.

The Bulgari's tea room had been arranged with antique elegance. Society matrons clustered in small groups, their Chanel perfumes mingling with the scent of Hermès leather.

"Did you hear they brought in a young substitute teacher today?"

"If Eleanor chose her, she must be decent."

The whispers ceased abruptly when Beatrice Merouin entered.

The Klein family matriarch wore an emerald-green qipao, jade earrings swaying with each step. She surveyed the space with disdain. "This place dares to call itself a tea room?"

Eleanor's smile stiffened. "If you're uncomfortable, sister-in-law—"

"Since I'm already here." Beatrice marched to the head seat. "Let's see what kind of expert you've dug up."

The tea room door whispered open at that moment.

Evelyn entered carrying tea utensils, her plain white qipao making her resemble fresh snow on a branch. Amidst the glittering jewels, she moved like an ink-wash painting come to life.

"Good afternoon, ladies." She gave a slight bow. "I'm Evelyn Langley, today's tea ceremony instructor."

Beatrice narrowed her eyes. There was something familiar about this girl.
###Chapter 235

Eleanor Roland was accustomed to this tone of speech and didn't feel targeted at all. Instead, she smiled warmly.

"Staying idle at home is so dull. Why not host a tea gathering for some excitement? Tea ceremonies are quite trendy lately, so I chose this theme specifically."

"You rarely attend social events, sister-in-law. Your presence today truly honors me. Please, come in—"

Eleanor's words were gracious and sincere. Even Beatrice Merouin, who usually clashed with her, couldn't find fault.

Soon, Margaret Evans arrived fashionably late with Chloe Valentine in tow.

The unfamiliar face immediately drew the ladies' attention.

"Margaret, who is this?"

"Such a young girl. Which family does she belong to?"

Margaret had prepared for this moment and introduced with a bright smile, "This is Chloe Valentine, the daughter of my dear friend. She's currently studying at MIT."

Chloe promptly greeted everyone with practiced politeness.

"She's still in college, no wonder she looks so youthful and vibrant."

"Female students at MIT are quite rare. How impressive."

MIT was renowned for its rigorous engineering programs, dominated by male students. Women had relatively easier admission—was this really a compliment?

Unfortunately, neither Margaret nor Chloe caught the underlying sarcasm.

The ladies exchanged knowing glances. Their polite smiles masked the disdain in their eyes.

—That dress is a three-year-old Celine design. Completely outdated. Probably dug up from some thrift store.

—How embarrassing to show up dressed like this at such an event.

—The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

Everyone in their circle knew about the Evans heir getting a college girl pregnant.

Yet Margaret had the audacity to parade the girl around, passing her off as a friend's daughter?

What a pathetic cover-up.

They played along with the charade, already anticipating the juicy gossip this would provide later.

Margaret remained oblivious, mistaking their feigned admiration for genuine praise.

Chloe, intoxicated by her first taste of high society, floated on cloud nine.

"Mrs. Laurent, you're here too?" Margaret sidled up to Beatrice. "You look radiant today."

Hearing rumors of discord between the Laurent sisters-in-law, she decided to curry favor.

"That horse-face skirt is exquisite. It makes your skin glow like porcelain."

Beatrice gave her a cool glance. "This is keshi silk."

Margaret's smile faltered.

When the other woman clearly showed disinterest, she pressed on undeterred.

"Ah, keshi silk! They say every inch is worth its weight in gold. Truly magnificent."

Her eyes gleamed as she added pointedly, "I recall Eleanor owns similar skirts too. Several, if I'm not mistaken."
###Chapter 236

Beatrice raised an eyebrow, finally giving the woman her full attention. "And you are...?"

"From the Evans family."

"Ah, Mrs. Evans." A faint smirk played on Beatrice's lips. "You seem quite interested in Eleanor's and my horse-face skirts. Perhaps you'd like to visit the Laurent estate someday? Our walk-in closets might fascinate you."

Margaret's smile froze.

This wasn't the reaction she'd anticipated.

"Who do you think you are?" Beatrice rose with a cold laugh, looking down her nose at the other woman. "Matters between sisters-in-law are none of your concern."

She strode away without another glance.

Margaret's face flushed with alternating shades of humiliation.

Eleanor watched the exchange, barely concealing her disdain.

Though she and Beatrice often clashed due to their differing personalities, they were still family.

How dare this woman try to drive a wedge between them?

Was she out of her mind?

Beatrice settled into a seat directly facing Chloe.

The younger woman hunched her shoulders, adopting a pitiful expression. Her eyes brimmed with tears the moment their gazes met.

Beatrice detested such artificial white-lotus antics.

Eleanor might be spoiled, but at least she was genuine. Women like Chloe...

She averted her eyes. Out of sight, out of mind.

"Beatrice," Eleanor approached, "the lighting here is poor. Shall we move over there?"

Beatrice followed without protest.

Perfect. Now those two irritants were out of view.

She shot Eleanor an approving glance.

Eleanor shook her head in resignation.

Their eldest brother spoiled Beatrice rotten, and the entire family indulged her whims. Naturally, Eleanor had to play along.

As the attendees assembled, the tea ceremony class began.

A slender figure emerged from the side entrance.

A jade-blue cheongsam embroidered with silver magnolias hugged her curves, the intricate patterns shimmering with each graceful step.

Evelyn's hair was swept into a simple chignon, her makeup understated yet elegant.

She moved toward the platform with effortless poise, commanding every eye in the room despite her quiet demeanor.

"Have any of you watched the documentary about tea culture?" Her voice flowed like clear spring water. "When a single leaf fell into water, it transformed its essence—thus tea was born."

"China is the birthplace of tea, with a history stretching back to the era of Shennong, spanning over four thousand seven hundred years."

"As one of the 'seven daily necessities,' tea became woven into the fabric of common life since ancient times..."

"Lu Yu's 'The Classic of Tea' from the Tang Dynasty marked the crystallization of Chinese tea culture... The spirit of tea permeated poetry, calligraphy, painting, religion, medicine..."

Evelyn spoke with measured elegance, her words unfolding like the delicate unfurling of tea leaves in warm water.
###Chapter 237

"Evelyn, this teacher you invited is excellent—far better than those stuffy old scholars from before."

In the tea-scented parlor, several society matrons whispered among themselves. This was Eleanor Roland's fifth tea appreciation gathering. Previous events had featured elderly tea masters well past their prime.

"Absolutely. Ms. Langley's presentation is lively and engaging. Her voice is quite pleasant too."

"And she's so elegant—every movement exudes grace."

Chloe Valentine's grip tightened around her teacup. Her nails dug into her palms as she glared at Evelyn Langley, who held the room captive with her effortless charm.

Why?

How could this sudden interloper command such admiration?

"Wait." Chloe abruptly stood, cutting Evelyn off mid-demonstration.

Every eye turned toward her. Margaret Evans reached to pull her back down, but it was too late.

"Is there a question, miss?" Evelyn remained unruffled.

"Are you actually a certified tea master?" Chloe lifted her chin. "You seem awfully young to be lecturing us. Did you just cram some basics last night?"

Murmurs rippled through the gathering.

Eleanor quickly interjected, "Master Qiu fell ill suddenly. I personally vouch for Ms. Langley's expertise."

"Then where's your certification?" Chloe pressed. "As I understand, professional tea masters require nationally accredited qualifications."

She'd researched this meticulously. The certification had five tiers, each notoriously difficult—her roommate had failed twice before passing the basic level.

Eleanor's expression faltered. She hadn't actually verified Evelyn's credentials.

All attention shifted back to the podium.

A smirk curled Chloe's lips. Let's see how this pretender wriggles out of this one.
###Chapter 238

Evelyn Langley gazed calmly at Chloe Valentine, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Since you question my expertise, why don't you specify where I was unprofessional?"

Chloe's breath hitched.

She had only been nitpicking without cause. The materials she'd crammed last night were already forgotten.

"I'm asking if you have certification," Chloe retorted, forcing bravado. "Don't change the subject."

"As an instructor, I welcome constructive criticism." Evelyn's voice was cool. "But baseless accusations are unacceptable."

Chloe was rendered speechless.

The surrounding socialites' gazes grew skeptical. Chloe clenched her fists. "Everything you said is basic knowledge anyone can find online. We came for an expert's insight."

Several women nodded in agreement:

"Exactly. How can we verify your credentials?"

"With so many frauds these days, showing certification isn't unreasonable."

Eleanor Roland's expression darkened. Challenging Evelyn was an affront to her.

Beatrice Merouin sipped her tea leisurely, amusement flickering in her eyes. She despised pretentious girls—this drama was entertaining.

Evelyn gave Eleanor a reassuring glance before addressing Chloe. "If I produce certification, how will you apologize?"

"However you demand!" Chloe scoffed.

Evelyn signaled to the tea attendant by the door. The young woman in traditional dress hurried over with Evelyn's bag.

Inside lay precisely prepared documents. Evelyn smoothly unzipped the compartment, her fingers reaching for the contents...
###Chapter 239

Evelyn Langley pulled a crimson certificate from her bag.

The gilded words "Senior Tea Master" shimmered under the sunlight.

"Would you like to examine it closely?" She held the certificate up to Chloe Valentine's face.

Chloe's complexion paled instantly, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her blouse.

"T-this could be fake!" she stammered defiantly.

Evelyn gave a light chuckle. "The certification number is right here. Feel free to verify it."

Someone in the crowd immediately pulled out their phone.

"It's legit! Officially certified by the national tea association!" the person announced loudly.

Chloe bit her lower lip. "A piece of paper doesn't prove real skill!"

Without another word, Evelyn walked gracefully to the tea station.

She pressed the kettle's switch with elegant precision.

"Step one: water selection." Her voice rang clear. "Mountain spring water is ideal. Filtered water is acceptable."

The kettle began emitting a soft hum.

"Step two: warming the cups." She rinsed each tea vessel methodically. "Temperature affects fragrance release."

Beads of sweat formed on Chloe's forehead.

Evelyn measured a precise pinch of tea leaves.

"Leaf quantity must be exact." Her fingertip tapped the scale. "One gram more brings bitterness. One gram less lacks depth."

Boiling water cascaded into the teapot, unfurling the tightly rolled leaves.

"Pour steadily." Her wrist rotated fluidly. "Forceful streams damage the leaf structure."

A delicate aroma began permeating the air.

Evelyn covered the pot. "Steeping duration requires perfect timing."

Exactly forty seconds later, she lifted the lid.

The liquid gleamed like translucent amber.

"Distribution must be even." She decanted the brew into tasting cups. "Please."

Chloe's hands trembled slightly.

Evelyn raised her cup. "Tea tasting mirrors life—both demand mindful presence."

She took a measured sip, her expression softening.

"Lu Tong wrote: The first cup moistens lips and throat," she recited. "The second dispels loneliness. The third awakens inspiration—five thousand scrolls flow from the mind."

The tearoom fell utterly silent.

"Su Shi said: Let us test new tea with fresh fire." Her gaze swept the audience. "Today's gathering honors this tradition."

Applause erupted like crashing waves.

Chloe's face turned ashen.

Evelyn gave a slight bow. "May everyone find serenity in this shared moment."
###Chapter 240

"Magnificent!"
"This is what a true tea master looks like!"

Mrs. Cardenas, owner of Cardenas Furniture, came from a long line of tea farmers. Having grown up in tea plantations, she held tea ceremonies to an almost impossibly high standard. She'd come today specifically to witness the legendary skills of the rumored tea master.

When she saw a young woman take the stage, Mrs. Cardenas frowned slightly. What could someone so young possibly know about tea? Probably just flashy tricks without substance.

But as Evelyn Langley began her demonstration, Mrs. Cardenas' eyes widened.

Those delicate hands moved with effortless grace through each step—water temperature, timing, technique—all executed with astonishing precision. Even more impressive was how eloquently she explained the philosophy behind each movement, quoting classical texts that revealed her profound knowledge.

Mrs. Cardenas had met too many so-called "tea masters" who could only spout empty theories but faltered in practice. This girl, however, was the real deal.

Evelyn descended the stage with calm composure and walked straight to Chloe Valentine.

"Now, do you still question my certification?"

Chloe's face turned ghostly pale as she instinctively took two steps back.

"Time to honor your promise," Evelyn said, her voice steady. "You said if I proved myself, you'd apologize publicly."

Chloe's back was drenched in cold sweat. She never imagined this seemingly ordinary girl possessed such mastery of tea arts.

Margaret Evans was equally stunned. When Evelyn had been with her son, she'd been utterly unremarkable. How had she transformed into someone entirely different after leaving?

As Evelyn quoted ancient texts onstage, Margaret understood for the first time what "poetic temperament" truly meant. That innate confidence and elegance radiating from within made her feel ashamed of her own pettiness.

"Fine, I admit you're skilled!" Chloe's voice trembled. "Must you be so relentless?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Mrs. Cardenas slammed the table and stood. "What insolence! You were the one who challenged her, and now you want to backtrack?"

Other society ladies quickly joined in: "Exactly! Look at how accomplished Ms. Langley is—some people should check their reflections!"

The wave of criticism grew louder, soon pulling Margaret into its tide...
###Chapter 241

"Mrs. Evans, your family's taste in women keeps getting worse. How dare you bring such trashy company to embarrass yourself in public?"

"Exactly! She doesn't even know basic etiquette. What a disgrace to the Evans name!"

The society women whispered among themselves, their eyes dripping with disdain. Chloe Valentine stood at the center of the crowd, fingers twisting the hem of her dress.

Nathan Evans having affairs was bad enough, but this brainless floozy? Margaret Evans' carefully maintained face twisted with rage.

After years of effort to secure her place in high society, this idiot was ruining everything!

"What are you waiting for?" Margaret hissed through clenched teeth. "Apologize now!"

Chloe's eyes welled with tears, her delicate features trembling. That pitiful act might work on men, but these women had seen it all before.

Beatrice Merouin turned away in disgust, refusing to even look at her.

"How should I apologize?" Chloe bit her lip, staring at Evelyn Langley.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to Chloe's flat stomach. Why bother with such petty games?

"A sincere apology will suffice."

Chloe blinked, surprised by the easy out.

"That's it?"

"Would you prefer more?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"I'm sorry!" Chloe bowed her head quickly before Evelyn could change her mind.

"Ms. Langley is too generous. Someone like her deserves proper discipline."

"Absolutely. No manners means future disasters. Don't you agree, Mrs. Evans?"

Margaret forced a smile. "Of course. She'll be properly disciplined at home."

Chloe's nails dug into her palms. She'd meant to humiliate Evelyn, only to make her look merciful instead.

Evelyn felt the venomous glare and smirked inwardly. Some people mistake kindness for weakness.

But so what?
###Chapter 242

Evelyn had anticipated this outcome, but she felt no regret.

One should always follow their conscience in life.

Eleanor affectionately linked arms with her. "When did you get certified as a senior tea master, Evelyn? You never mentioned it."

Evelyn flushed slightly. "It's nothing worth bragging about..."

During her six years with Nathan, the first two were spent finishing college while the last four trapped in that villa.

Day after day, year after year, her world had shrunk to only him.

Though imprisoned in a gilded cage of his making, Evelyn hadn't wasted those years.

Between tending to Nathan's needs, she'd devoted every spare moment to studying and cultivating new skills.

As their relationship cooled and his visits grew scarce, Evelyn finally reclaimed her time.

She enrolled in courses, earned certifications, filling every empty hour with purpose.

Her father's words stayed with her: "Learning has no endpoint—one should study until old age."

Every new skill meant another path forward.

Perhaps subconsciously, she'd never truly relied on Nathan.

......

After class, Evelyn stayed to guide the society ladies through practical demonstrations.

Many had already brewed tea following her instructions.

"Ms. Langley, how's my infusion?"

"Mine next—any suggestions?"

"Don't forget mine!"

With patient grace, Evelyn sampled each offering, providing expert feedback.

When Mrs. Cardenas presented her cup, an exquisite fragrance wafted out before the lid was even lifted.

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Longjing tea?"

Mrs. Cardenas smiled warmly. "Pre-Qingming harvest from Feng Mountain. Last year's reserve—what do you think?"

The unfurled leaves formed perfect symmetry in crystal-clear liquor, the rich aroma confirming its premium grade.

This surprised Evelyn. Most attendees pursued tea culture as a fashionable hobby, but Mrs. Cardenas clearly knew her craft.

The first sip bloomed across her palate with lingering sweetness.

She took another, genuinely impressed. "Exceptional."

Superior leaves, perfectly brewed.

Mrs. Cardenas beamed. "My family owns tea plantations in Yunnan. These were last year's private reserve—I'd be honored if you'd take some home."

Though Evelyn tried declining, Mrs. Cardenas insisted until she gratefully accepted.

Beatrice showed no patience for the meticulous ritual, losing interest after halfhearted attempts.

"Beatrice, this instructor's brilliant—so much better than that tedious old man last time. My tangerine tea smells divine. What did you make?"

Another matron sniffed Beatrice's cup. "Lovely aroma. Let's have the expert evaluate it."

Before Beatrice could protest, Evelyn was summoned.

"Ms. Langley, do assess Beatrice's infusion. First time we've seen her actually participate!"
###Chapter 243

Madame Lowell was in high spirits. Beatrice Merouin rarely participated in such events, and even when she did attend, her involvement was always half-hearted.

Having brewed a pot of tea with rare enthusiasm, she naturally expected it to be properly appraised.

Evelyn Langley approached unhurriedly. When she lifted her gaze, it accidentally met Beatrice’s.

Beatrice stiffened for a moment before letting out a disdainful snort, her posture dripping with arrogance.

But Evelyn saw right through it—that arrogance was merely a mask to conceal her discomfort.

Madame Lowell smiled warmly. "Miss Langley, what do you think of this tea?"

Evelyn rinsed her mouth first, then took a small sip.

Setting the cup down, she spoke bluntly, "Too much tea leaves, not enough water. The brew is overly concentrated and unpleasantly bitter. The water temperature was also too low, failing to fully release the tea’s aroma."

"Pfft—" Madame Lowell couldn’t hold back her laughter. "What did I tell you? Cutting corners would give you away. Miss Langley saw right through it."

Beatrice’s expression darkened.

Though Evelyn’s assessment was accurate, did she have to be so brutally honest?

Madame Lowell laughed heartily. "I should’ve known better than to expect much from you."

Beatrice: "..."

Completely oblivious to having offended anyone, Evelyn had already turned to evaluate the next lady’s tea.

......

Margaret Evans sat stiffly among the guests, watching as Evelyn was showered with admiration. Jealousy made her fingers tremble.

She had worked painstakingly for years just to barely enter this circle, yet Evelyn had won universal praise with just one tea appreciation class.

The most infuriating part? Evelyn remained indifferent to the flattery, continuing to offer professional critiques with unshakable composure.

Some of her assessments were downright cutting.

Yet those haughty socialites didn’t take offense—instead, they thanked her profusely.

Margaret: "?" Had the world gone completely mad?

Glancing at the cowering Chloe Valentine beside her, whose tea had been an utter disaster, Margaret’s frustration deepened.

For the first time, she thought having Evelyn as a daughter-in-law might not be so bad—at least she was a hundred times better than this quail of a girl!

At exactly five o'clock, the tea appreciation gathering concluded.

Guests began leaving one after another.

At the hotel entrance, Margaret jabbed a finger at Chloe’s face. "I told you to prepare properly, and this is the humiliation you bring me? Were you trying to announce to the world how unfit you are?"

"How can someone so stupid dare to show their face? It was obvious others came prepared—couldn’t you use your brain for once?"

Chloe bit her lip, about to defend herself, when Margaret immediately took two steps back.

"Stay away from me. The sight of you disgusts me! Don’t let me see you for the next few days—you’re nothing but bad luck!"

She sneered. "A worthless thing like you, dreaming of marrying into the Evans family? Delusional!"

Nearby, Eleanor Roland’s car pulled up.

"Sister-in-law, need a ride?"

Beatrice waved her off. "No need. I have other matters to attend to."

Eleanor didn’t press further and drove away.

Evelyn stood at the hotel entrance waiting for her ride. One after another, people approached to exchange pleasantries, and she responded to each with a polite smile.
###Chapter 244

Knowing someone was coming to pick her up, Eleanor Roland didn't arrange for a driver.

Adrian Klein was punctual as always, arriving in ten minutes—two minutes early.

A light drizzle began to fall. Adrian peered through the windshield.

Through the rain, Evelyn Langley approached in her cheongsam, moving with effortless grace like a scene from an ink-wash painting.

He hesitated for a moment before quickly pulling over.

Grabbing an umbrella, he stepped out and hurried to her side, opening the car door for her.

As she bent to enter, his hand instinctively shielded her head from the doorframe.

"Thank you."

Once seated, she smiled at him. "Sorry to trouble you again, Professor Klein."

She'd planned to take a cab, but the sudden rain made it impossible to hail one.

Across from the hotel, Beatrice Merouin waited under a pavilion for the valet. She squinted as Evelyn got into a black Volkswagen.

Though she couldn't see the man's face clearly, the umbrella bearing the distinctive "RR" logo stood out sharply.

Beatrice curled her lip in disdain. These days, any pretty girl thought she could climb the social ladder.

She'd thought this one might be different, but...

Men really had terrible taste, lining up to be taken advantage of.

......

Inside the car, the so-called "fool" sneezed.

His cold was almost gone—why was he sneezing again?

Evelyn noticed the new ornament hanging below the rearview mirror—an agarwood charm strung on a Chinese knot, adorned with two jade beads.

"You hung this in your car?" she asked, delighted.

Adrian kept his eyes firmly on the road, not daring to look too long at her in the cheongsam.

"Agarwood is calming. The back has an Arabic prayer for safety—it pairs well with the knot."

Evelyn gently turned the charm over, studying the unfamiliar script.

"So this is Arabic..."

"Mhm."

"You know Arabic?"

"A little."

"How do you pronounce this?" Her fingertip traced the engraving.

Adrian recited the phrase with flawless pronunciation.

She repeated it twice, mastering it quickly.

"Like that?"

"Perfect," he nodded.

"When did you learn?"

"Six years ago. I needed to read an Emirati physicist's original work—the translation wasn't accurate enough, so I studied for six months."

Evelyn's eyes widened. Learning a language just for one book?

......

With data analysis still to complete that evening, they ate a quick dinner before returning to the lab together.

By midnight, the lab was empty except for the two of them.
###Chapter 245

The night was ink-black, with only the faint hum of laboratory equipment breaking the silence.

Adrian Klein paused his work, his peripheral vision catching the girl beside him.

Evelyn Langley was meticulously recording data, her lashes casting delicate shadows under the light.

It struck him—this was the first time someone had stayed up all night with him in the lab.

The feeling was... unfamiliar.

By 3 AM, they finally finished.

Inside the elevator, Evelyn stifled a yawn, her eyes glistening with fatigue.

"Goodnight," she murmured.

Adrian watched her enter the apartment across the hall, but his mind replayed the afternoon's scene—

Raindrops pelting the pavement as she held that silk parasol, her cheongsam tracing every graceful curve.

He slammed his door shut, Adam's apple bobbing.

Evelyn fell asleep the moment her head touched the pillow.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Chloe Valentine tossed restlessly in bed.

Nathan Evans was out again.

Margaret Evans' mocking words looped in her ears.

She flung off the covers and stormed barefoot into the living room.

"Where the hell is everyone?!"

Her shrill voice echoed through the empty mansion.

Two maids scurried out in alarm.

"Miss Valentine, what's wrong?"

Chloe's icy gaze swept over them. "I want bird's nest soup. Now."

The maids exchanged glances. "At this hour—"

"What? You suddenly don't take orders from me?"

The older maid forced a smile. "I'll prepare it right away."

Chloe jabbed a finger at the younger one. "You—come massage me."

The girl hesitated.

"Deaf?" Chloe's voice sharpened. "My back's killing me thanks to your incompetence!"

The maid bit her lip and approached. The instant her fingers grazed Chloe's shoulders, they were slapped away.

"Gently! Trying to murder me?"
###Chapter 246

The nanny hesitated. "Miss Valentine, prenatal massages require special techniques. We can't just—"

"Stop making excuses!" Chloe sneered. "You're just being lazy!"

"I'm a certified maternity care specialist. Your safety is my priority—"

"Certified?" Her voice turned shrill. "Are you threatening me with credentials? Get out if you don't want this job!"

The nanny clenched her fists, swallowing her anger.

"Lie down."

Chloe nestled into the couch with satisfaction. "Was that so hard? Must I always lose my temper?"

The nanny's hands trembled slightly.

"Did you skip breakfast? Put some strength into it!"

"Ah! Are you trying to kill me?"

Gritting her teeth, the nanny adjusted her pressure.

"Barely acceptable."

Thirty minutes later, a bowl of bird's nest soup appeared on the table. Glossy strands glistened under osmanthus honey, its aroma rich and inviting.

Chloe lifted half a spoonful—then slammed the porcelain down.

"This tastes wrong!"

"That's impossible..." The nanny paled. "I followed the traditional recipe."

"Then the bird's nest must be fake." Chloe narrowed her eyes. "Did you switch my premium stock?"

"I've served the Evans family for twenty years!" The nanny shook with indignation. "Call the police if you doubt me!"

At the mention of police, Chloe's gaze flickered.

A noise came from the foyer.

Nathan Evans stumbled in, loosening his tie. Alcohol clung to him like a second skin.

"Nathan!" Chloe's demeanor flipped instantly. She approached with a sugary smile. "Let me help—"

"Get lost." He shoved her away. "Don't touch me."

His disgusted glare treated her like something scraped off a shoe.

Her nails dug into her palms.

Once Nathan disappeared upstairs, she whirled around. "What are you gawking at? All of you—out!"

Midnight silence.

Carrying a hangover remedy, Chloe noticed the master bedroom door ajar.

Running water echoed from the shower.

She set the tray down and crept closer.

Through frosted glass, a shadow loomed larger.

Under the spray, Nathan's eyes snapped open—glinting like unsheathed blades.
###Chapter 247

The sound of running water stopped abruptly.

Chloe Valentine tightened her bathrobe, trembling fingers twisting the doorknob.

Nathan Evans' towering figure loomed before her the moment the door opened, their faces nearly colliding.

"Who gave you permission to enter?"

A tempest raged in the man's eyes.

"Didn't I declare this room off-limits?" His fingers clamped around her wrist like steel. "Who do you think you are?"

Pain shot through Chloe's arm as the hangover soup sloshed from its tray. "I...I just..."

"Spare me the act." Nathan's laugh was glacial. "A few nights in my bed doesn't make you the lady of the house. Gold-diggers like you are a dime a dozen."

His breath chilled her ear as he hissed, "I wouldn't touch you now even if you stripped naked."

Tears streaked Chloe's cheeks as her body shook. "Stop..."

"Get out!"

The porcelain bowl shattered against marble tiles.

Chloe stumbled back to her room, silent sobs wracking her body all night. The pillowcase grew damp beneath her face, his cruel words echoing endlessly.

How could he treat her like this when she carried his child?

Unless...he truly intended to reconcile with Evelyn Langley?

The thought jolted her upright, her foot kicking over the nightstand in a violent arc.

At dawn, Mrs. Watson surveyed the master bedroom's wreckage when a thunderous crash sounded next door.

"Lord have mercy..." She stared at her grease-stained hands in despair.

The high salary wasn't worth this.

Approaching the guest suite, she heard a feeble cry: "Mrs. Watson..."

Chloe crouched by the doorway, her face ghostly pale. "The pain...I can't..."

"Oh dear!" The housekeeper fumbled for her phone. "The chauffeur's off today—"

"Call an ambulance!" Chloe doubled over, sweat beading her forehead.

Another maid rushed in and dialed Mrs. Evans without hesitation.

Thirty minutes later, sirens pierced the villa district's tranquility.

As the ambulance disappeared, every staff member exhaled in unison.
###Chapter 248

Margaret Evans was getting a facial at the spa when the call came in. She ripped off the mask and grabbed her purse, storming out without hesitation.

"If anything happens to my grandson, that bitch will pay!"

Her stilettos clicked urgently down the hospital corridor. She shoved the ER doors open, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"Doctor! How's my grandson?"

The physician in a lab coat adjusted his glasses. "You're the family? The fetus is perfectly healthy. The mother just experienced Braxton Hicks contractions due to emotional stress."

Margaret's tense shoulders finally relaxed. Then her eyes turned icy as she glared at Chloe Valentine curled up on the hospital bed.

"Useless. Can't even carry a child properly."

Chloe clenched the sheets. A simple argument with Nathan had triggered sudden cramps. Now, publicly humiliated by her mother-in-law, her cheeks burned with shame.

"I'm sorry, Mom—"

"Silence!" Margaret snapped. "One more stunt like this, and you'll regret it."

The doctor cleared his throat awkwardly. "The mother's emotional state requires—"

Margaret scoffed and strode out, heels echoing. Chloe stared at the ceiling, silent tears streaking down her face.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Langley was recording lab data when her phone buzzed. The screen read "Prof. Eleanor Roland."

"Evelyn, are you free next week? An old friend wants to meet you."

The professor's voice sounded hoarse. Evelyn's pen stilled, instantly sensing something wrong.

"I'll come by next week."

After hanging up, she pulled up her schedule. She could ask a junior to cover her afternoon lab—she needed to see Eleanor now.

The jingle of keys startled the housekeeper in the kitchen.

"Oh! Evelyn, why—"

"Where's the professor?" Evelyn cut straight to the point.

A cane tapped from the inner room. Eleanor leaned against the doorframe, fleeting panic in her eyes.

"I thought we agreed on next—"

Evelyn rushed forward, steadying the unsteady woman. She knelt and gently rolled up Eleanor's pant leg.

Swollen, deformed joints came into view.

"This is your 'minor issue'?" Her voice trembled.

Eleanor sighed. "Just old age..."

"To the hospital. Now." Evelyn's tone brooked no argument.

The housekeeper hovered with a fruit platter, hesitating. Eleanor met her student's stubborn gaze and finally relented with a smile.

"Fine, fine. But let me finish editing this paper—"

"No!" Evelyn dialed 911. "Who'll take care of the lab flowers if you collapse?"

Sirens wailed in the distance. Eleanor shook her head ruefully, but her eyes glistened with touched gratitude.
###Chapter 249

The gap between a top-tier fighter and a true martial arts master may seem thin, but it's an insurmountable abyss.

That sliver of inner energy becomes the uncrossable chasm separating them.

Countless elite fighters spend their entire lives stuck at this threshold, unable to advance further.

Some train bitterly for twenty years. Others achieve enlightenment in a single moment. A rare few ascend through ancient martial techniques.

Now, this elite fighter finally realizes he's bitten off more than he can chew.

"None of you are leaving tonight!"

Xiao Chen moves like a phantom, instantly cutting off his opponent's retreat. His fist cuts through the air with a howl.

Boom!

Fists collide. The elite fighter staggers back three steps, his palms splitting open.

Desperation flashes in his eyes. "Call for backup!" he roars at the frozen Lao Hei.

Then he charges at Xiao Chen, his strikes whistling through the air.

Cornered prey often unleashes unimaginable potential.

Right now, he's like a lone boat in a storm—barely staying afloat but refusing to capsize.

Lao Hei snaps out of his daze and turns to flee.

"Looking to die?"

Xiao Chen's cold snort precedes his blurred movement. A kick lands square on Lao Hei's back.

Thud!

Lao Hei flies like a broken kite, crashing hard onto the ground. Blood sprays from his mouth.

"I said no one leaves."

Xiao Chen turns back to the elite fighter.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Fists and feet clash. Shockwaves ripple outward.

"Break!"

Xiao Chen suddenly shouts. A faint white glow flickers around his fist.

The elite fighter's pupils constrict—inner energy!

Crash!

He's sent flying, smashing through an entire wall before being buried under rubble.

Xiao Chen strides forward, casually picking up a bloodstained brick.

"N-no... please..."

The brick falls. Blood blooms.

Xiao Chen walks toward Lao Hei, his gaze icy as a blade.

"W-who the hell are you?"

Lao Hei presses against the wall, trembling uncontrollably.

"Why target Evelyn?"

Xiao Chen's voice seems to rise from the depths of hell.

Lao Hei blinks, then understands. "That's what this is about?"

Crack!

Xiao Chen stomps down, shattering his shinbone.

"Ahhh! My cousin set it up... someone paid 500 grand..."

Sweat pours down Lao Hei's pain-twisted face.

"Your cousin?"

Xiao Chen narrows his eyes, lighting a cigarette.

"C-can I live?"

Lao Hei grits through the pain, bargaining for his life.

Xiao Chen smirks, picking up a revolver from the ground.

"Five bullets. One empty chamber."

He spins the cylinder expertly before pressing the barrel to Lao Hei's forehead.

"Let's play."

Lao Hei's face turns ashen. A dark stain spreads across his pants.

"Wait! I know where Ren Hai is!"

He screams hysterically.

Xiao Chen pauses. A sharp glint flashes in his eyes.

"Talk."

"H-he's meeting a shipment at the docks tomorrow..."

Lao Hei rattles off the details, terrified the gun might fire any second.

Xiao Chen thoughtfully pockets the revolver.

"Your cousin's name and address."

Lao Hei babbles the information like a drowning man clutching at straws.

"Good."

Xiao Chen suddenly grins eerily, pulling out a coin.

"Heads you live. Tails you die."

The coin flips into the air, tracing a silver arc.
###Chapter 250

Evelyn Langley was dragged into an all-nighter by the eccentric professor. The clatter of keyboards echoed through the lab all night.

"Done!" Gregory Hill stretched his arms. "Final exam question bank and answer keys are complete."

Evelyn rubbed her dark circles. "Professor, karma will catch up with you."

She managed less than an hour of sleep before jolting awake. When her 8 AM alarm blared, she grabbed her coat and sprinted to the lab.

Adrian Klein was calibrating equipment when she arrived thirty minutes late, exhaustion written across her face. "No rest last night?"

"All-night coding session." She massaged her temples.

Adrian didn't pry, simply handing her a black coffee.

She downed the bitter liquid, forcing herself to focus.

After lunch, her eyelids grew heavy.

"Take a nap in the lounge." Adrian closed her laptop.

This time, she didn't argue.

Two hours later, Adrian knocked on the lounge door. No response.

He eased it open to find Evelyn curled on the sofa. Strands of hair framed her face as she breathed deeply in sleep.

Adrian lingered in the doorway before quietly shutting it.

Like a dozing kitten.

......

Chloe Valentine yanked the hospital curtains with a violent rattle.

"Discharge me!" She hurled a pillow at her nurse.

Nathan Evans hung up without responding. Margaret Evans' scolding exploded through the receiver: "Keep this up and you'll stay until delivery!"

After tense negotiations, Margaret reluctantly agreed to home care—with round-the-clock monitoring by a private physician.

The staff at the villa collectively groaned at the sound of approaching tires.

Mrs. Watson bolted upright from her nap in the storage room. "My afternoon rest!"

The doctor handed Chloe a strict schedule and bland meal plan the moment she stepped inside. She flung her chopsticks at the insipid menu.

"I'm going shopping!" She kicked open the car door and stormed into the mall.

Two attendants trailed behind, arms laden with a dozen shopping bags. Chanel and Hermès logos dazzled passersby.

"Keep following me!" Chloe swiped her card for another designer handbag.

In the boardroom, Nathan's phone vibrated incessantly. The CFO's presentation halted as purchase alerts flooded the screen.

He glanced at the totals, expressionless, and powered off the device.
###Chapter 251

Nathan Evans's temple throbbed violently. He flipped his phone face down on the conference table and muted it.

"Continue."

His icy voice instantly silenced the room.

Everyone held their breath, afraid to make a sound.

After the meeting, Nathan returned to his office and finally picked up his phone.

A series of spending alerts flashed across the screen, drawing a cold laugh from him.

Chloe Valentine was using his supplementary card. Every transaction triggered an instant notification to him.

The alerts kept pouring in.

Just as Nathan was about to set his phone aside, a WeChat notification chimed.

"Nathan, do you like these clothes? I bought you a tie and a suit too~"

He glanced at it and immediately blocked her.

Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, Nathan watched the endless stream of traffic below. Evelyn Langley's face surfaced in his mind again.

Lately, she kept intruding into his thoughts uninvited.

Even in his dreams.

He had once given Evelyn a black card too.

But she rarely used it except for essential expenses.

He knew she took freelance coding jobs that probably didn't pay much.

Yet she never bought luxury items.

All those designer bags and jewelry in her closet? He'd forced them on her.

When they broke up, she left everything behind.

Like discarding worthless trash.

Chloe's presence was a constant thorn, reminding him of what he'd lost.

......

At the mall.

Chloe trembled with rage when she saw the red exclamation mark signaling she'd been blocked.

A sharp pain shot through her abdomen, forcing her to take deep breaths.

"I want coconut water. Go buy it now," she ordered the two nannies, pointing imperiously.

"I'll go. She can stay with the bags," one nanny suggested.

Chloe sneered. "Are you deaf? I said both of you go!"

"But these purchases—"

"Carry them!"

The nannies exchanged a look, resentment simmering beneath their obedient expressions.

This was pure spite.

But Chloe didn't care.

If she had to suffer Nathan and Margaret Evans's indifference, someone else would bear her fury.

That night, Nathan still didn't return.

Surrounded by shopping bags, Chloe alternated between laughter and tears before starting to smash things.

Mrs. Watson rolled over in bed, pulling the covers over her head.

Let her break whatever she wants. They'd clean it up tomorrow.

The other two nannies had anticipated this. They'd requested leave as soon as they returned.

One claimed back pain required a doctor's visit. The other said her grandson needed care.

So when Chloe stormed out disheveled, the villa stood empty.

"Mrs. Heilbronn!"

"Mrs. Watson!"

"Where the hell is everyone?"

"I want bird's nest soup!"

"My stomach hurts!"
###Chapter 252

When her final gambit failed spectacularly, Chloe Valentine finally retreated in defeat.

She stormed into the bedroom, slamming the door with enough force to rattle the walls.

At dawn the next day, Mrs. Watson had just finished washing up when ear-splitting shrieks erupted upstairs.

"Someone help! I need to go to the hospital!"

The housekeeper's eye twitched. Unlike last time's panic, she remained eerily calm.

With practiced ease, she dialed the chauffeur. "Mr. Thompson, our patient is having another episode."

"On my way," came the driver's bored response.

Next, Mrs. Watson called Margaret Evans. "Madam, the situation is—"

The entire operation flowed like a well-rehearsed play.

In the hospital corridor, Margaret's expression could freeze hell over.

The doctor delivered the usual spiel. "Just get more rest."

Margaret finally snapped, barging into the VIP ward. "Do you think this is your private clinic? You practically live here!"

"Is your head just for decoration?"

"If you can't even handle a simple pregnancy, you're utterly useless!"

Her mind flashed to Evelyn Langley's composed demeanor during crises. That girl never caused elders unnecessary worry.

But this creature on the hospital bed? Louder than cicadas, more annoying than fleas!

Turning molehills into mountains, acting like the universe revolved around her—

Disgusting.

Chloe ignored the tirade, treating it as background noise.

The day after discharge, she pulled the same stunt.

Initially, Margaret would answer the calls. Eventually, she told Mrs. Watson:

"Handle it. Don't bother me."

Mrs. Watson: "..."
This household runs on my back alone!

Margaret finally found peace.
Let the drama queen exhaust someone else.

......
May 3rd, Sophia Laurent's birthday gala.

Evelyn's meticulously planned gift arrived right on schedule.

The "Eternal Galaxy" blue diamond necklace—Sophia's ultimate fantasy piece, designed by Cherry Xia.

This jewelry sensation went viral after appearing in Princess Diaries, becoming near-impossible to acquire.

Evelyn had pulled strings to procure it from Belgium through backchannels.

"Put it on me now!" Sophia squealed, spinning around. "Even the boutiques said it's sold out worldwide!"

Her off-shoulder mermaid dress, sprinkled with celestial embroidery, became transcendent with the necklace.

Breathtaking.

......
On the terrace of an exclusive club, Margaret enjoyed afternoon tea with her socialite circle.

Free from Chloe's theatrics, she'd never felt more rejuvenated.

Sometimes she wondered: Was preserving this pregnancy truly worth it?
###Chapter 253

Nathan Evans' attitude was crystal clear—he couldn't care less about this child.

The bigger problem? Vincent Evans remained completely in the dark. Every time Margaret Evans mustered the courage to speak, the words died on her lips.

She knew her husband too well.

Father and son shared the same icy detachment in their bones.

With Chloe Valentine's baby bump now visible, terminating the pregnancy was out of the question.

Margaret had no choice but to accept this reality.

"Mrs. Lowell, I heard your daughter-in-law is expecting twins? What a blessing!"

"Indeed! The lovebirds kept it secret until the pregnancy stabilized—wanted to surprise me."

"Congratulations! My useless son doesn't even have a girlfriend. By the way, Mrs. Evans, is your son seeing anyone?"

Margaret took a refined sip of tea. "Oh, he's completely absorbed in running his little company."

"You're too modest! Everyone knows your son's company went public!"

The corners of Margaret's lips lifted slightly. "Just child's play."

"My son lacks ambition—hovering around his wife since the pregnancy test turned positive. I'm pinning all my hopes on the grandson."

"The baby isn't even born yet, and you're already planning his future?"

The group burst into laughter.

"You don't understand. Latest foreign research shows fetuses can receive education in the womb."

"I enrolled my daughter-in-law in the most exclusive prenatal class—all instructors studied abroad."

"That extravagant?"

"Absolutely. Maternal quality directly impacts fetal development. Only an exceptional mother breeds an exceptional child."

Margaret's eyes flickered.

Upon returning home, she immediately summoned the butler.

"Enroll Chloe Valentine at this prenatal center. And make sure Mr. Evans doesn't find out."

The butler understood perfectly.

Thirty minutes later.

"Madam, it's done."

Margaret dialed Chloe's number.

The phone rang endlessly before being answered.

"Who is this?"

Margaret suppressed her irritation. "It's me."

"Oh! Aunt Margaret! I didn't check the caller ID."

"I've registered you for prenatal classes starting tomorrow. Consider it high-society networking—flower arranging, tea tasting, that sort of thing."

Her tone brooked no argument.
###Chapter 254

Chloe Valentine lounged lazily on the sofa, popping a segment of tangerine into her mouth with her fingertips. Hearing Margaret Evans' words, she didn't even lift her eyelids.

"Auntie, I've been feeling unwell lately—running to the hospital every other day. I really don't have the energy for any training classes..."

The humiliation from the last tea appreciation gathering still burned fresh in her memory. Just hearing the words "flower arrangement and tea tasting" now made her stomach churn.

Margaret's chest tightened with anger. Was this girl not even bothering with basic pretense anymore?

"This isn't up for discussion. You're going!"

The line went dead with a sharp "beep."

Chloe had hung up on her.

Margaret stared at her phone screen, fingers trembling. That insolent little wretch!

If she was this brazen before even giving birth, what would happen if she delivered a son? Would she try to trample over Margaret's head?

She immediately summoned the butler. "Go to Chloe's place personally and deliver the class schedule. Tell her if she misses a single session, she can pack her bags and get out of the Evans family villa! That bastard child in her womb won't be recognized either!"

At nine that evening, the butler returned with his report.

Margaret's expression was icy. "What did she say?"

The butler lowered his head. "Miss Valentine said she'll attend the classes as scheduled."

"Hmph. She'd better!"

......

The next morning, a shrill ringtone shattered the quiet.

Half-asleep, Chloe fumbled for her phone, her voice thick with drowsiness. "Who is it?"

"Good morning, Miss Valentine. This is Instructor Lynn from Morning Star Prenatal. Our first pastry-making class starts at eight. It's already seven-thirty—can you make it in half an hour?" A pause. "Mrs. Evans specifically instructed us to notify her immediately if you miss a session."

Remembering the butler's threat last night, Chloe gritted her teeth and forced herself up.

During breakfast, she opened the class schedule her assistant had messaged her and nearly spat out her milk.

From 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., every minute was accounted for—fashion coordination, social etiquette, Western dining, jewelry appraisal... Not even a moment to catch her breath.

Every fiber of her being rebelled. But the thought of Margaret's warning and her current luxurious lifestyle made her swallow her protests and step out the door.

Thus began Chloe's grueling prenatal education. Each day left her too exhausted to straighten her back, yet she still had to squeeze in university classes.

Her previous unexplained absences had piled up until her advisor came knocking with a stern warning. She'd resorted to paying classmates to attend for her, relying on roommates to cover for her sporadic appearances.

Now with prenatal classes consuming most of her time, the constant back-and-forth drained her completely. Within days, she reached a decision—

She would drop out.
###Chapter 255

Chloe Valentine stood at the dormitory door, her fingertips lightly pushing it open.

Sunlight slanted through the window, illuminating her new Chanel sweater.

"Chloe?" Emily Fairsprene was the first to notice her, setting down her book in surprise.

The other roommates looked up, their gazes lingering on her designer outfit.

"I'm here to pack my things." Chloe strode in on her high heels, casually placing her Hermès bag on the table.

The dorm fell silent.

"My withdrawal papers are already submitted." She began organizing her closet with indifference. "I can't keep studying anyway."

Emily shot to her feet. "Are you insane? You're only two years from graduation!"

"Graduation?" Chloe chuckled, her fingers brushing over her slightly rounded abdomen. "I have more important matters now."

All eyes dropped to her stomach.

"I'm pregnant." She lifted her chin. "The Evans family values this child."

The air froze for several seconds.

"Are you sure about this?" Emily's voice trembled. "That's Nathan Evans—a notorious playboy."

Chloe's expression darkened. "You know nothing. He's different with me."

She shoved clothes into her suitcase, her designer bracelet jingling at her wrist.

"At least talk to your parents—"

"Them?" Chloe sneered. "Have they ever cared about me, except when asking for money?"

Silence reclaimed the room.

"Think whatever you want." She snapped the suitcase shut. "You'll understand once I marry into the Evans family."

The sudden roar of a sports car echoed outside.

Chloe's eyes brightened as she grabbed her bag.

"My ride's here."

The roommates exchanged uneasy glances as she walked out without looking back.

Emily rushed to the doorway just in time to see a red Ferrari speeding away.

"Did she really think this through?" someone whispered.

No one answered.

The sunlight remained bright, shining on the now-empty bed.
###Chapter 256

The vanity table was cluttered with messy cosmetic bottles. Chloe Valentine picked up a lipstick with disdain.

The plastic case had yellowed slightly, with tiny dust particles clinging to the edges.

"These..." She tossed the lipstick into the trash bin. "Are all outdated."

The wardrobe door stood wide open, revealing a few faded T-shirts hanging limply. Chloe wrinkled her nose and yanked the hangers down.

"See if any of these are usable." She dumped the clothes in the middle of the dorm room. "Throw away what you don't want."

Her roommates exchanged glances.

"All of it?"

"Yes."

Without looking back, Chloe strode out. A black Maybach waited silently at the school gates. She gracefully opened the door and drove off under the envious stares.

Night fell.

When Nathan Evans pushed open the front door, Chloe greeted him with a fruit platter.

"Nathan!" Her eyes sparkled. "I withdrew from school today. Now I can focus on taking care of you and the baby."

His hands paused on his tie.

"What did you say?"

Unaware of his darkening expression, she continued, "My studies aren't as important as you—"

"Chloe Valentine." Nathan sneered. "Don't use me as an excuse."

She froze.

"I—"

"Do whatever you want." He turned toward the stairs. "Don't bother me."

Chloe clenched her skirt, nails digging into her palms. Why couldn't he see her sacrifices?

At the stair landing, Nathan suddenly remembered the figure who used to work in the lab until dawn. He closed his eyes, a dull ache spreading through his chest.

......

June sunlight pierced through the morning mist.

Evelyn Langley opened the balcony door and gasped—her succulents had sprouted new buds. Pink-and-white climbing roses covered the railing, dewdrops glistening on their petals.

She crouched down, gently touching the leaves.

"You've grown so much."

Her lab schedule was packed. After watering the plants and feeding the fish, Evelyn hurried out.

"Morning, Dr. Langley!"

"Morning."

She slipped into her white coat and dove into work. The computer screen displayed dense data—42 sets collected, 27 more to go.

Natalie Blanchet nearly knocked over a reagent rack when she rushed in.

"Sorry, sorry!" She fumbled to steady it. "Traffic was awful dropping the kids off..."

Vincent Macmillan looked up from his microscope. "Late again?"

"Don't ask." Natalie collapsed into a chair. "My mother-in-law's rheumatism flared up, my husband's away, and I—"

Evelyn suddenly turned. "Need any help?"
###Chapter 257

"Is it a gout flare-up, Natalie?"

"How did you know?"

"Professor Eleanor suffers from it too. I have a traditional herbal remedy passed down in my family. It won't cure it completely, but it's excellent for pain relief without the side effects of Western medicine."

Natalie's dull eyes suddenly brightened. "Really? Send me the recipe immediately! My mother-in-law has been in so much pain she can't sleep, and painkillers aren't working. If this helps, I'll owe you big time."

Evelyn smiled gently. "It's nothing. Don't mention it."

Vincent suddenly chimed in. "Have you noticed? Ever since Evelyn joined the lab, she's solved every problem. She's like our lucky charm!"

Oliver walked in. "What lucky charm?"

Natalie explained with a smile. "We were just saying how brilliant and capable Evelyn is. A real blessing."

Before Oliver could respond, Camille shot up from her seat, pale-faced. "Someone tampered with my computer! All my experimental data is gone!"

"What?"
"Another virus? That can't be..." Vincent immediately checked his own computer. "IT just upgraded the firewall last week..."

Natalie frantically booted up her machine.
The lab instantly tensed.

Vincent exhaled in relief. "My data's intact. Natalie?"
"Mine's fine too."
Both turned to Oliver and Evelyn.

Oliver shook his head. "No issues here."
Evelyn confirmed with a nod. "My data is safe."

Only Camille's files had vanished without a trace.

Natalie ventured cautiously. "Could you have saved them in the wrong folder?"
Camille bit her lip. "I checked everywhere."

The group exchanged uneasy glances.
Vincent frowned. "This is bizarre. Only your data was affected..."

Camille's voice trembled. "This wasn't a glitch. Someone deleted them on purpose!"

The air turned icy.

Vincent's expression darkened. "That's a serious accusation. You'll need proof."
"Professor Macmillan, I don't want to suspect anyone. But what else could explain this?" Camille clenched her fists. "Nothing like this ever happened before..."

Her gaze suddenly locked onto Evelyn. "Not until she arrived!"

Every eye in the room fixed on Evelyn.

Evelyn met Camille's stare calmly, but the other woman quickly looked away.

The usually quiet Natalie spoke up. "We need to investigate this properly..."
###Chapter 258

"The data deletion is serious, but Evelyn has worked with us for so long. I trust her character." Natalie adjusted her glasses, her tone firm. "We shouldn't accuse anyone without proof."

Camille hadn't expected the usually neutral Natalie to be the first to speak up. Her nails dug into her palms, but she maintained a composed smile.

Vincent immediately agreed. "Exactly. Evelyn is meticulous. She'd never make such a mistake."

Oliver kept his head down, his gaze shifting uneasily.

"Appearances can be deceiving," Camille said softly, each word laced with venom. "Who knows what someone might hide behind a friendly face?"

She turned to the group. "The data was there yesterday morning when I checked. Now it's gone. Natalie and Vincent left first yesterday afternoon, followed by Oliver and me. Only Evelyn and Professor Klein remained."

"Professor Klein would never do this, which leaves—"

"Are you sure you checked the data before leaving?" Evelyn interrupted.

Camille's expression faltered. "Of course! What are you implying?"

"Then let's review the surveillance footage," Evelyn met her gaze squarely. "The data disappeared after you left. The cameras will show us the truth."

Natalie clapped her hands. "Good idea. The lab has 24/7 surveillance."

Camille scoffed. "Fine. Let's check. I wouldn't want anyone accusing me of false allegations."

In the security room, the guard frowned as he pulled up the recordings. "That's odd. We have footage from the past month, except for yesterday and the day before."

"See?" Camille pointed accusingly at Evelyn. "No wonder you suggested checking the cameras. You tampered with them!"

Professor Klein entered just then, taking in the scene. "What's going on?"

"Professor!" Camille's eyes instantly welled up. "My experimental data was deleted—a week's worth of work. And now the surveillance footage from last night is missing. Evelyn was the last one here..."

Natalie hurried to explain. "Professor, we don't have all the facts yet."

Vincent nodded. "Evelyn isn't capable of this."

Oliver stood in the corner, staring at Camille's profile. They'd gone shopping and dined together these past few days. When had she found time to work on that dataset...?

Professor Klein questioned them thoroughly about the timing and storage location of the missing data. Camille answered flawlessly, every detail precise.

The tension thickened.

Evelyn suddenly laughed softly. "Finding the culprit is actually quite simple."
###Chapter 259

"Do you have a solution?" Vincent Macmillan asked with a furrowed brow.

Evelyn Langley's gaze remained fixed on the computer screen. "We can directly recover the deleted experimental data, check the operation logs, pinpoint the deletion time, and then cross-reference the lab personnel list from that period."

Vincent sighed. "That's the theory, but the recycle bin's been emptied. Can the data still be recovered?"

"I can try," Evelyn said calmly.

She hadn't intended to intervene initially—data recovery would take time, while checking surveillance footage would've been the quickest solution. But under these circumstances, the cameras could no longer provide further clues.

Just as Evelyn prepared to operate the computer, Adrian Klein suddenly pressed down on her wrist.

Everyone froze.

"First," Adrian's voice was steady, "there's currently no direct evidence implicating Evelyn. All suspicions are based solely on Camille Valrose's claims."

He scanned the room. "It's like losing your wallet on the street and randomly accusing a passerby, demanding they prove they're not the thief. Does that sound reasonable?"

"Evelyn," he met her eyes directly, "you have the ability to uncover the truth, but never fall into the trap of self-justification."

Evelyn's heart jolted. The man's calm, razor-sharp logic snapped her back to clarity.

Natalie Blanchet suddenly understood. "He's right! The burden of proof lies with the accuser. Why should Evelyn have to prove her innocence?"

All eyes turned to Camille Valrose.

Her smile stiffened, fingers twisting together unconsciously.

"I... I was just raising suspicions," her voice trembled, "I never said Evelyn did it."

Adrian pulled out his phone. "Then let's handle this through the police."

"Agreed," Natalie responded immediately.

Vincent raised his hand. "I'm in favor too."

Camille's face turned ashen, beads of sweat forming at her temples. Just as Adrian was about to dial, Oliver Lancelot suddenly stepped forward.

"Wait!" He waved his hands frantically. "I used Camille's computer yesterday—I might've accidentally deleted her folder and emptied the recycle bin..."

He bowed repeatedly. "This is all my fault, causing this misunderstanding. I'm so sorry..."

Camille nodded stiffly. "It's... it's fine."

Natalie eyed them skeptically. "Be more careful next time."

Evelyn turned and left without another glance. As for helping Camille recover her data? She owed her no such obligation.
###Chapter 260

Evelyn turned to leave but found herself caught in Adrian's intense gaze.

The corners of her lips lifted slightly as she silently mouthed two words.

Adrian clearly read them—Thank you.

......

As night deepened, Adrian led the team to a bustling night market eatery.

"I come here often for their barbecue. Evelyn, you must try their signature beef skewers." Natalie enthusiastically piled food onto Evelyn's plate.

Vincent handed her a cup of chrysanthemum tea. "This will help cool you down. Their kimchi is excellent too—want some?"

The sudden warmth left Evelyn flustered, though she understood it was their way of making amends.

Camille's grip on her chopsticks tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Once the center of attention, she now watched as all eyes focused on Evelyn.

"I need air." She abruptly stood and left the table.

Oliver quietly followed.

Red lanterns lined the alley as Camille wandered aimlessly, his footsteps shadowing hers.

She whirled around. "Enjoying this? Can't even let me breathe?"

After a beat of silence, Oliver asked, "Camille, did that dataset ever exist?"

Her pupils constricted. "What are you implying?"

"The lab was empty after hours. When did you run those experiments?"

"Oliver!" Her voice sharpened. "Are you accusing me?"

"I just don't want to see you make mistakes."

Tears welled in her eyes. "You don't believe me either?"

"I took the blame for a reason—you know why." Oliver held her gaze. "I want the truth."

"Yes! It was me!" she exploded. "Go report me then! I don't need your fake concern!"

Stunned by her outburst, Oliver faltered. "Why...?"

"Everything changed after she arrived! Professor Klein, Natalie, Vincent—even you!" Her voice trembled. "I'm sick of it!"

Seeing her red-rimmed eyes, Oliver stepped closer. "Camille, I love you. Be with me."
###Chapter 261

"Everyone in the lab orbits around Evelyn Langley, but my eyes only follow you. Let me be your anchor, okay?"

Oliver Lancelot's voice cut through the night air with startling clarity.

His pulse hammered against his ribs as he studied Camille Valrose's profile.

From the moment she'd first stepped into the laboratory, she'd ensnared him. A wildfire of brilliance, she burned brighter than any rule-follower like him ever could.

Twelve months of pursuit.

Tonight, he'd try once more.

Camille's fingers twisted the hem of her blouse.

This wasn't genuine affection. She recognized the unspoken threat—comply, or face exposure for what she'd done.

Losing her position wasn't an option.

"I accept."

Oliver blinked, then beamed. "Truly? Camille, I swear I'll protect you with my life!"

He seized her hands, blind to the ice in her gaze.

......

At the late-night diner, Oliver practically glowed as he led Camille back to their group.

"We're together!" he announced.

Natalie Blanchet arched an eyebrow. "Finally caught your beauty, eh?"

Vincent Macmillan grinned, punching Oliver's shoulder. "You sly dog!"

Evelyn offered a sincere smile. "Congratulations."

Adrian Klein's lips curved. "Boss, two more dishes—my treat."

Camille scrutinized Adrian's expression.

That effortless smile. Those genuine well-wishes. The last ember of hope in her chest flickered out.

......

Midnight approached.

As the group dispersed, Evelyn suggested walking home.

Moonlight stretched their shadows long across the pavement.
###Chapter 262

The river shimmered under the moonlight, its surface fractured by ripples that scattered the neon reflections from skyscrapers along the banks. Evelyn Langley's heels clicked rhythmically against the cobblestones as the city's clamor faded behind her.

Adrian Klein walked beside her, maintaining a comfortable distance. Their silence held an unspoken familiarity, like old friends who needed no forced conversation.

"Shall we go to the bridge?" Evelyn suddenly stopped, tilting her face toward the arched structure spanning the river. A breeze tousled her hair, and she instinctively smoothed the stray strands.

Adrian followed her gaze. "It's quite far."

"Getting tired already, Professor Klein?" She teased with a playful blink.

"How about a race?" He raised an eyebrow, amused at his own childish suggestion. A man in his thirties, acting like a college student.

"Deal!" Her eyes sparkled with sudden enthusiasm. "Loser buys ice cream."

Sophia Laurent would surely mock her for such modest stakes. Bargaining with the Klein Group heir for mere frozen dessert.

"Three, two, one—"

Evelyn shot forward like an arrow. Adrian kept pace three steps behind, never rushing.

When she reached the bridge's midpoint, breathless, Adrian appeared leisurely at the entrance.

"I won!" She lifted her chin triumphantly, eyes gleaming like captured starlight.

Adrian approached a convenience store and opened the freezer. "Flavor?"

"Strawberry, please."

They sat side by side on a riverside bench, enjoying their post-race cool-down. Evelyn gazed at the light-polluted sky with a sigh. "Hard to see stars these days."

"As a child, I never really looked at them properly," she mused, propping her chin on one hand.

The model student, the exemplary daughter—Evelyn had been everyone's golden child. William Langley, though busy with work, spoiled his little princess. Her mother Victoria gave her free rein, caring only for her happiness and health.

"...Mom was terrifyingly good at finding hidden cash. Even the emergency bills Dad stashed in shoeboxes." The memory curved Evelyn's lips, streetlights softening her features in a golden halo.

Adrian watched her, his own smile forming unconsciously. In that moment, he willingly drowned in this warmth, with no desire to surface.
###Chapter 263

"Every time Dad and I fail at hiding his secret stash, we analyze our mistakes and pick a better hiding spot." Evelyn Langley nibbled on her popsicle stick. "But Mom has radar vision—she always finds it no matter where we hide."

She suddenly noticed the man beside her had gone quiet. "Professor? Are you listening?"

Turning, she unexpectedly met Adrian Klein's fathomless gaze.

The night breeze scattered her loose hair tie.

Her cascading hair shimmered under the streetlamp like liquid gold.

"Hmm." His voice was husky. "Your mother's quite perceptive."

Evelyn averted her eyes, throat tightening. "She writes mystery novels."

Those labyrinthine cases and meticulous deductions were her mother's literary domain.

If her father taught her worldly wisdom, her mother gifted her boundless imagination.

"What about your childhood, Professor?"

"Reading. Problem sets. Exams."

"That's it?"

Adrian watched neon lights ripple across the river's surface. "When I was five, I found a book in Grandfather's study—The Way Things Work."

His eyes suddenly brightened. "I couldn't even read 'physics' yet, but it fascinated me more than any toy."

Evelyn saw sparks dancing in his gaze.

"Zhuangzi said: To judge the beauty of heaven and earth, to analyze the principles of all things." His voice softened. "Before physics, my world was monochrome."

His eyes found hers. "Then it became technicolor."

And now, perhaps, had gained another hue.

Melting popsicle dripped onto her hand. Evelyn sprang up. "We should head back."

She angled away from his gaze, pulse hammering.

Adrian watched her retreating figure, experiencing unfamiliar helplessness.

——

That night, Evelyn tossed in bed.

Behind closed eyelids, Adrian's intense stare materialized in the darkness.

Then Nathan Evans' icy expression flashed through her mind.

Those years of lovesick folly. Those days of humiliating devotion.

Her eyes flew open.

Why repeat past mistakes?

Having clawed out of one abyss, must she leap into another?

She booted up her laptop, letting research data flood her thoughts.

The academic world was pure. Safe.

——

At dawn, when the lab door opened, Natalie Blanchet and Vincent Macmillan turned in unison.
###Chapter 264

Evelyn Langley had just pushed open the laboratory door when two pairs of eager eyes locked onto her.

She froze mid-step.

"Professor Blanchet, Professor Macmillan, what's going on...?"

Natalie Blanchet and Vincent Macmillan exchanged a glance before rushing forward.

"Evelyn," Natalie rubbed her hands together, "we need your expertise on a technical issue."

Vincent nodded rapidly. "We have two sets of astronomical data to process. Traditional methods are too slow."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Massive dataset?"

"Enormous!" Natalie gestured wildly. "At least five days' worth of computing time."

Evelyn pondered for a moment. "Let me take a look."

Thirty minutes later.

"How about this algorithm framework?" Evelyn typed the final line of code.

Natalie stared at the screen, her eyes widening.

"My God! This efficiency..."

Vincent leaned in. "Let me test it!"

When Adrian Klein entered, this was the scene that greeted him.

His two top researchers were orbiting around Evelyn.

Natalie was massaging Evelyn's shoulders.

Vincent held up a bubble tea. "Bought it special—30% sugar."

Adrian: "..."

When had his lab become Evelyn's domain?

Camille Valrose strode in on stilettos, her expression darkening at the sight.

Oliver Lancelot trailed behind with breakfast.

"Camille, your favorite soup dumplings."

"Greasy food this early?" She shook off his hand. "And when did I ever say I liked these?"

Oliver floundered. "Last week you—"

"Last week was last week!" Camille glared. "Can't you remember anything?"

Oliver shrank back, silent.

......

Chloe Valentine twirled her pen listlessly.

The fashion design course Margaret Evans had enrolled her in was mind-numbingly dull.

The instructor droned on.

"This season's trending colors are—"

Chloe yawned, her eyelids growing heavy.

Suddenly, a pointer slammed onto her desk.

"Miss!" The instructor scowled. "Pay attention!"
###Chapter 265

Chloe Valentine sat in the classroom, her ears buzzing. The teacher's voice sounded muffled, as if separated by frosted glass.

She fiddled with her freshly manicured nails, the diamonds glittering under the lights.

"Miss Valentine, please answer the question I just asked." The teacher suddenly called on her.

Chloe jerked her head up, confusion written across her face.

A few snickers rippled through the classroom. Someone whispered, "It's her again. She never knows the answers."

Her grip tightened around the pen, her nails nearly digging into her palm.

The moment the bell rang, Chloe bolted from the classroom. She needed an outlet—and shopping was the perfect remedy.

The mall's dazzling array of luxury goods beckoned to her.

Nathan Evans was in a meeting reviewing quarterly reports when his phone buzzed incessantly—one spending alert after another.

He glanced at the screen, a cold smirk curling his lips before shutting it off completely.

Margaret Evans strode into the mall in her stilettos. She checked her watch, brows furrowing.

"Now I have to fetch that little gold-digger," she muttered under her breath.

In the elevator, she adjusted her hair in the mirror. The refined socialite in the reflection wore flawless makeup, but the exhaustion around her eyes was unmistakable.

The classroom was empty. The teacher informed her, "Miss Valentine left half an hour early."

Margaret's face darkened instantly. She dialed Chloe's number, only to be met with endless ringing.

Then, around the corner, a familiar figure came into view.

Chloe emerged from the Chanel boutique, arms laden with shopping bags, a satisfied smile on her face.

Margaret's gaze locked onto those unmistakable orange bags, and fury erupted within her.

"Chloe Valentine!"

Her sharp shout turned every head in the mall.

The shopping bags hit the floor with a heavy thud.

"Who do you think you are? Squandering my son's money like this!" Margaret's voice was shrill and piercing.

A crowd quickly gathered, phone cameras trained on them.

Chloe's face drained of color. She opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

"Look at her, everyone! A shameless gold-digger!" Margaret jabbed a finger at her. "Spending a man's money on all these bags—do you even deserve them?"

Camera flashes lit up the scene. Chloe instinctively raised a hand to shield her face.

Her fingers trembled. The fresh manicure now seemed unbearably garish.
###Chapter 266

Margaret Evans had completely lost her mind, shrieking like a deranged harpy as she unleashed years of pent-up fury.

She abandoned all pretense of dignity, consumed by the need to retaliate for every slight she'd endured.

Isabella Evans listened to the vulgar tirade, her expression turning icy.

She wasn't some spineless pushover.

Though she'd tried pleasing Margaret, she carried the Evans heir in her womb. What did she have to fear?

"What's wrong with buying a few bags?" Isabella's voice sharpened. "Those pointless etiquette classes are unbearable! I've humored you long enough!"

"This supplementary card came from your son. If he doesn't object, why should you care?"

Margaret trembled with rage, suddenly remembering Evelyn Langley.

That girl never demanded luxuries—dressing simply yet elegantly.

Unlike this tacky gold-digger!

"You're not fit to lick Evelyn's boots!" Margaret spat.

Isabella smirked. "Miss her that much? Then bring her back!"

"You Evanses are hilarious—scorning people when they're here, pining when they're gone. How pathetic."

"I'm no Evelyn to endure your abuse. We can destroy each other for all I care!"

"Starting today, those ridiculous classes can go to hell!"

She scooped up her scattered designer bags and strode away without a backward glance.

Margaret saw spots from rage, suddenly noticing bystanders filming.

"Stop recording! I'll sue for invasion of privacy!"

A spectator scoffed. "Making a public spectacle and expecting no witnesses?" The crowd dispersed with disdainful murmurs.

Left alone, Margaret clutched her heaving chest.

What karma!

That evening, she was hospitalized for a vertigo attack.

Isabella rushed over upon receiving the call.

In the sterile ward, Margaret lay pallid and disheveled—a far cry from her usual polished self.

"Doctor, how's my mother?" Isabella asked anxiously.

"Emotional distress triggered a relapse. She requires complete rest—no further agitation."

After the doctor left, Isabella took a crisp bite of an apple, eyeing her mother.

"Chloe drove you to this, didn't she? I warned you she's trouble."

"All that pandering, and for what? Landing yourself in a hospital bed?"
###Chapter 267

Margaret Evans tore the ice pack from her forehead, her face livid. "Did you come to visit or to provoke me? If it weren't for that child in her belly, trash like her would never set foot in our family!"

Isabella Evans rolled her eyes. "You brought this on yourself. Anyone with eyes can see her schemes—only you still believe she's some pure white lotus."

She'd seen through Chloe Valentine long ago, yet her mother remained oblivious.

Nathan Evans rushed to the hospital upon hearing his mother was admitted. As he approached the room, heated arguing spilled into the hallway.

"What's going on?" He pushed open the door, his voice icy.

Margaret immediately straightened. "Perfect timing! That girlfriend of yours is utterly lawless! I kindly went to pick her up after class, but she gave me the wrong time and even dared to disrespect me in public!"

"My vertigo hasn't flared in years—she drove me straight to the hospital today!"

Isabella scoffed. "Mom, tread carefully. Chloe is still Nathan's choice. Badmouth her now, and when they reconcile, you'll just be the wicked mother-in-law."

She deliberately redirected. "Honestly, things were better with Evelyn Langley. Now we've lost a golden phoenix and gotten stuck with some wild pheasant."

Nathan's expression darkened.

Ignoring their bickering, he went straight to consult the attending physician. Confirming his mother's condition wasn't serious, he left without another word.

Back at the villa, a soft body flung itself at him. Chloe stood there in a black silk nightgown, the plunging neckline revealing pale skin glowing under the lights.

"Nathan, you're finally—"

Her sugary voice cut off abruptly as he shoved her away, even brushing off his sleeve in disgust.

"Nathan..."

Slap!

The sharp crack echoed as Chloe staggered back, her cheek burning.

"Who gave you permission to disrespect my mother?"

Tears spilled down her face. "I only spoke the truth! Why do you only believe her side? I'm human too—I have the right to voice my thoughts!"

Nathan sneered. "Didn't you bring this on yourself?"

The words stabbed like knives. He'd originally told her to abort the child and take the money, but unwilling to accept defeat, she'd gone straight to Margaret.

"You chose to climb up using my mother—don't play the innocent now." His words dripped venom. "This hypocrisy disgusts me."

"I didn't... I just love you so much, wanted to have our baby..." Her pitiful sobs were artful.

"Love?" His gaze turned arctic. "You're unworthy of that word. Without my mother's protection, you wouldn't even be standing here."

Her pent-up grievances erupted. "After everything I've sacrificed for you, you're still blind to it? Is it because you're still hung up on Evelyn?"

"What if I am?" Nathan didn't deny it.

"How am I inferior to her? My love for you—"

"Enough." A vein throbbed at his temple. "Her name doesn't belong in your mouth."

He turned toward the stairs, delivering his ultimatum. "Apologize to my mother by tomorrow, or get out."
###Chapter 268

Nathan walked away without looking back, his jacket slung over one shoulder.

Chloe's fingers trembled.

His eyes held no love—only disdain. She was just a plaything, disposable trash.

She'd dropped out of school for him. Gotten pregnant before marriage. Groveled before Margaret. And in return? Disgust and rejection.

Tears welled up, but she wiped them away fiercely. Her palm pressed against the slight swell of her abdomen.

As long as this child remained, she still had a card to play.

......

Nathan drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.

The hospital staff would care for Margaret.

That nuisance Chloe was at the villa.

Work? He'd already pulled two straight days without sleep.

"Dylan, let's grab drinks."

"Nathan, that's the third time this week." Amusement colored the voice on the line. "When you were with Evelyn, I wouldn't see you for months."

Nathan's eyes narrowed. "Coming or not?"

"Can't tonight. Family dinner at the estate."

"Give my regards."

He hung up and dialed Julian. The call rang endlessly.

At this hour, he was probably drowning in some woman's embrace.

Nathan scrolled through his contacts, pausing at one name—

Ethan Winston.

"How surprising. Nathan Evans calling me?" The greeting dripped sarcasm.

Ethan always knew how to provoke him.

Nathan rolled down the window, flicking cigarette ash. "Didn't expect you to still have my number."

"Childish." Ethan scoffed. "Send the address."

"Not afraid I'll start a fight?"

"Good chance to stretch my legs."

......

The dim lights of Nightfall Bar pulsed overhead.

Nathan sat alone in the booth, three bottles of tequila on the table.

The bartender had just uncorked one when Ethan arrived.

"Starting with hard liquor?" Ethan arched a brow. "Planning to drink yourself under the table?"

Nathan smirked. "Scared?"
###Chapter 269

Ethan Winston lounged lazily on the sofa, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "I've quit drinking for health reasons. Can't risk it."

Nathan Evans' punch landed on cotton, leaving him frustrated.

"Ethan, are you even a man? Too scared to drink?"

"Alcohol has nothing to do with masculinity." Ethan adjusted his cuffs leisurely. "As for whether I'm a man, anyone with eyes can see that."

Nathan scoffed. "Is this how you act when pursuing Evelyn?"

"No." Ethan wagged his finger. "She's too sharp for pretense."

"Then what do you talk about?"

"World cultures. Financial markets. The artistry of poetry." A glint of amusement flashed in Ethan's eyes. "Occasionally, sweet nothings too."

Nathan's throat tightened.

Ethan added fuel to the fire. "Want details? I could give you a private lecture sometime."

"..."

Nathan grabbed his glass and downed it in one gulp.

Three whiskeys later, he loosened his tie, revealing a flushed neck.

Ethan frowned. "Did your stomach issues heal?"

"...No."

"So you're destroying yourself the moment Evelyn's gone?"

Her name stabbed Nathan's heart like a knife.

He looked up sharply. "Twelve boxes."

"What?"

"I've taken twelve boxes of stomach medicine since she left." His voice turned hoarse.

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "You think self-harm will win her back?"

"Why not?!" Nathan's eyes burned red.

"Clearly you don't understand her." Ethan signaled a waiter. "Take these away. Bring tea."

The waiter hesitated. "Sir, this is a bar—"

"Then water." Ethan's tone brooked no argument.

Nathan laughed bitterly. "I don't know her? We were together for six years!"

"Six years and you still misread her? That just proves you're a fool." Ethan's voice remained calm. "Or that you never loved her."

"Bullshit!" Nathan slammed the table. "I loved her more than anything!"

"Then why the breakup?"

The air froze.

Ethan's gaze sharpened like a blade. "Your love meant hurting her? Trampling her dignity? Shattering her trust?"

Each word struck like a slap, draining the color from Nathan's face.
###Chapter 270

"A woman like Evelyn Langley will walk away no matter how deeply she loved. It's only a matter of time."

Six years.

Ethan Winston thought it had been far too long.

Long enough that he almost believed the radiant girl had truly become love's puppet.

Long enough that he nearly gave up hope.

Fortunately, she finally took that step and became herself again.

Ethan: "Six whole years. She gave you countless chances—such blatant favoritism..." It was enough to drive a man mad with jealousy.

"Too bad you squandered it all. That's why she left so decisively, without even looking back."

This was the real Evelyn Langley.

When she loved, she gave everything without reservation.

When she stopped loving, she could turn away with grace and walk forward alone.

Julian Roscente once privately called her "love-struck" and "obsessed." Now he accused her of being "heartless" and "ruthless."

But Ethan understood—Evelyn never cared about others' opinions.

Love deeply, or walk away.

"The moment she decided to leave, your stomach problems—and you as a person—no longer mattered to her."

Nathan Evans staggered at these words, collapsing heavily into his chair.

His lips parted, but the sharpness in his voice was gone: "What makes you think... you know her so well?"

Ethan smirked.

"Women are like books you can never finish reading. Who dares claim they fully understand one? Especially at different ages, in different circumstances—the story changes."

"I don’t need to rush to understand Evelyn. I just want to spend my life cherishing her, reading her anew every day."

"So my answer to your question is: No, I don’t fully know her. But clearly, you don’t know her at all!"

The words stung. Nathan grabbed his glass and took a swig—only to taste bland water.

Ethan had already ordered the alcohol removed.

"Can’t win the argument, so now you won’t even let me drink?" Nathan laughed bitterly.

Ethan remained impassive. "As your friend, I’ll say this: A little drink is fine, but drowning yourself is reckless. You only get one life—don’t gamble with it."

Nathan paused, then tilted his head back and drank... water.

"Ethan, drinking with you is no fun."

"Yeah," Ethan sighed, pulling out a cigarette case before putting it away. "I don’t drink anyway."

Nathan scoffed. "What? First no alcohol, now quitting smoking too?"

"Trying to. Not there yet."

Nathan froze. A decade-long chain smoker suddenly quitting?

"Why?"

Ethan smiled faintly, his gaze mocking yet pitying.

"Told you you don’t know Evelyn. She has allergic rhinitis—especially sensitive to smoke. It’s mild, but she always frowned when someone lit up at gatherings."

Nathan was speechless.

Ethan stood, clapping him on the shoulder. "Give up. You won’t get her back."

He grabbed his coat and strode out—

"Bill’s on me. Don’t invite me next time. We’re rivals now—no room for nostalgia."
###Chapter 271

The motion-sensor light flickered on as Nathan Evans pushed open the villa's front door.

Chloe Valentine curled up on the leather sofa scrolling through her phone. She immediately dropped it and ran barefoot toward him.

Nathan didn't even glance her way, striding straight to the spiral staircase.

Chloe's nails dug deep into her palms.

Master Bedroom—

Nathan collapsed backward onto the king-size bed.

Evelyn Langley's lingering floral scent still clung to the pillows, flooding him with memories of their intimate moments.

His Adam's apple bobbed as crimson fury burned behind his eyes.

"Damn it!" He cursed under his breath before storming into the bathroom and turning the cold water on full blast.

Though he'd controlled his drinking tonight, Ethan Winston's words haunted him like a curse:

What right do you have to claim you love her?

Six years proved you're utterly unworthy...

All you've ever given her is pain...

She'll leave you for good one day...

Each syllable struck like a poisoned arrow, pinning him to the pillar of shame.

...

At dawn's first light, Nathan adjusted his tie.

The aroma of breakfast drifted up from the kitchen as he descended.

Golden fried eggs and freshly ground soy milk adorned the dining table.

Chloe emerged with a steaming basket of soup dumplings, flour dusting her apron.

"Nate, I woke up early to make these. Want to try?"

"Not hungry."

She hastily set down the bamboo steamer, ignoring her reddened fingertips.

"Then...maybe some hangover soup I prepared?"

Her tone carried practiced ease, as if last night's argument never happened.

Nathan's gaze swept the table before he scoffed.

The contrast couldn't be clearer.

Whenever he and Evelyn fought, she always broke the ice first.

But never with groveling.

Just a casual—

Need honey water?

Your antacids are in the left drawer.

The dry cleaners called about your suits.

One response from him would end their cold war.

For serious matters, she'd dissect every argument until he conceded defeat.

Now Nathan studied the performative woman before him—every calculated move visible in her eyes.

Disgusting.

Chloe prattled on: "Nate, I reflected all night. Aunt Margaret is family—I shouldn't have talked back."

"This is all my fault."

"Those prenatal classes are for my benefit. I swear I'll attend every session and cherish Auntie."

Nathan nearly applauded the Oscar-worthy performance.

"You're apologizing to the wrong person."

He turned toward the garage.

Chloe's smile froze in place.
###Chapter 272

The thought of facing Margaret Evans' sneering expression at the hospital made Chloe Valentine slam her lipstick down in irritation.

Nathan Evans' warning still echoed in her ears. She had no choice but to go.

Entering the kitchen, Chloe spotted the simmering chicken soup on the stove.

"Miss Valentine, the soup isn't ready yet—" Mrs. Watson said cautiously.

"Shut up," Chloe cut her off coldly. "Just pack a bowl."

She secretly hoped the old woman would get diarrhea from drinking it.

At the hospital room, Chloe pushed the door open without knocking.

"Auntie, I brought you some soup."

Margaret's face darkened the moment she saw her. "Get out!"

Chloe forced a smile. "I came to apologize. I spent all morning making this—would you like to try it?"

"Stop pretending!" Margaret hurled a pillow at her. "Who knows what you put in there!"

The soup bowl toppled over, and Chloe was shoved out of the room.

She stared at the oil stains on her dress—a Chanel piece she'd just bought last week.

Pulling out her phone, she texted Nathan: "I visited your mother."

As expected, no reply came.

Just as she reached the parking lot, a sharp voice rang out behind her. "Chloe Valentine!"

The moment she turned, a stinging slap landed across her face.

Isabella Evans withdrew her hand with a disdainful glare. "That's for forgetting your place. How dare you upset my mother?"

Clutching her cheek, Chloe maintained her smile. "Isabella, you've misunderstood—"

"Spare me the act." Isabella smirked. "If you weren't pregnant, one slap would be the least of your problems today."

She strode away, her heels clicking sharply against the pavement.

Chloe stood frozen, her nails digging deep into her palms.

One day, she'd make every single one of them pay.
###Chapter 273

The lab's AC hummed steadily as Evelyn Langley removed her goggles, rubbing her tired eyes. After two straight weeks of experiments, she finally had a day off.

Morning sunlight streamed through the fish tank, casting prismatic patterns across the room. Evelyn had just sprinkled fish food when her phone lit up.

"Morning, sweetie. You awake?"

"Yeah. Feeding the fish."

"Why not sleep in? It's your day off."

"Can't fight my body clock. Where's Mom?"

"In her study."

"Chasing another deadline?"

"Of course. Her creative juices flow best in the mornings."

Evelyn tapped the aquarium glass absently, remembering the contract. "Dad, has any editor visited Mom recently?"

"No. Why? They usually contact her online."

"Just wondering."

Hanging up, she moved to the kitchen. Soon, the aroma of frying eggs filled the air.

From the backyard came the snip of pruning shears—William Langley tending his prized roses.

In the study, Victoria Langley's fingers danced across the keyboard, birthing another chilling scene for her thriller.

None of them noticed the woman in stilettos pounding on Unit 401's door in the aging faculty housing complex.

"Victoria! I know you're home!"

Penelope Ashcroft scowled at the dirt smudging her designer pumps. This dump lacked even an elevator, and the stairwell reeked of cooking oil.

She'd never set foot in such slums if not for the expired contract. What should've been a simple online renewal became complicated after Victoria blocked all contact following their last argument. Penelope smirked. The writer always caved eventually.

"Stop pretending! Open up!"

"We only had professional differences. Have you lost all decency?"

"Victoria! Keep this up and I'll drop you!"

Her knocking escalated to pounding, leaving angry red marks on her palms.

"Who the hell's wailing at this hour?"

The neighboring door flew open, revealing Brenda Murphy in a disheveled nightgown, buttons askew.

"What're you staring at, you human vase? Got no manners?" Brenda spat through the railing. "Birds of a feather—both trash!"

The sudden tirade froze Penelope mid-pound. Beneath her flawless makeup, her face twisted with rage.
###Chapter 274

"Watch your mouth, ma'am!" Penelope Ashcroft snapped back, her chest heaving with anger. "Keep spewing nonsense like that and karma will bite you!"

Her delicate brows furrowed in outrage.

How dare this woman call her a harbinger of bad news?

"You're the one who's cursed! May your whole family rot!"

Brenda Murphy's face twisted at the taboo insult. "Who do you think you are? Dressed up like some high-class whore!"

Her scornful gaze raked over Penelope's outfit. "Which sugar daddy bought you that outfit? How many men did you service last night?"

Penelope's eyes widened in shock.

She'd never encountered such vulgarity.

"You—you're utterly—" Words failed her.

She couldn't possibly stoop to this woman's crude level.

"Cat got your tongue? Or did some man bite it off?" Brenda sneered. "How much do cheap sluts like you charge? Fifty? Eighty?"

Penelope's face burned crimson. "You're impossible!"

"Stop pretending to be pure," Brenda jeered, hands on hips. "Trash like you always puts on airs!"

Penelope took a deep breath. "Talking to you is like casting pearls before swine."

She turned to leave.

"Even pigs are cleaner than you!" The venomous shout followed her.

Penelope stumbled as her expensive heels sank into a muddy pothole.

Her heart ached at the sight of her ruined shoes. What kind of dump did Victoria live in? And what kind of neighbors were these?

As for the contract...

There were still two weeks before expiration. Victoria wouldn't dare refuse to renew.

The publishing industry had undergone massive changes this past decade, with print markets shrinking drastically. Victoria was already past her prime, having withdrawn from public life years ago—completely out of touch with current resources.

Who else would publish her books besides Penelope?

This trip had been a complete waste. Not only had she failed to meet Victoria, but she'd been humiliated by some deranged woman.

She'd remember this.

When Victoria came begging to renew the contract, Penelope would make sure to return the favor!

"At it again, Brenda?" A passing neighbor chuckled. "Didn't Professor Langley already move out?"

"Who knows what gutter this tramp crawled from!" Brenda scoffed. "Disturbing decent folks' sleep this early."

"A relative of Professor Langley's? Shouldn't she be at the villa then?"

Brenda's expression stiffened. "None of my damn business!"

"That villa of theirs is magnificent—front and back gardens both." The neighbor chattered excitedly. "We visited the other day, the flowers were—"

The more Brenda heard, the more it rankled.

"I'm going back to bed." She cut the conversation short and hurried inside.

After a moment's hesitation, she dug out a business card and dialed—

"Zack? About that housing exchange you mentioned last time..."

The voice on the other end perked up immediately. "Don't worry, Mrs. Murphy, I've got you covered..."

He'd just received word—this entire district was slated for demolition soon...
###Chapter 275

Morning sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains. Evelyn Langley stretched lazily.

The refrigerator stood empty. She decided to start with a thorough cleaning.

A thin layer of dust had settled over the untidy room after two weeks. She pulled on rubber gloves and began wiping surfaces in the living room. Dust particles danced in the sunlight like flecks of gold.

Just as she finished mopping, her phone rang abruptly. Sophia Laurent's name flashed on the screen.

"Eve, are you home?" Sophia's voice sounded muffled.

Evelyn wiped sweat from her forehead. "I was about to go grocery shopping. What's up?"

"I suddenly crave your braised pork ribs." Sophia's voice carried a distinct nasal tone.

Evelyn set down the cleaning cloth, instantly sensing something amiss. "What happened?"

"Nothing... I just want to see you." A sniffle came through the line.

Evelyn didn't press further. "Come over. I'll cook for you."

After hanging up, she rushed to the supermarket. Her cart filled with Sophia's favorite ingredients: pork ribs, potatoes, bell peppers...

The doorbell rang as soon as she unpacked the groceries. Sophia clung to her like a koala, eyes rimmed red.

"You always understand me best." Sophia stared at the shopping bags, voice trembling.

Evelyn patted her back. "Go sit on the couch. It'll be ready soon."

A tantalizing aroma soon wafted from the kitchen. Sophia sat cross-legged on the sofa, peeking toward the kitchen intermittently.

When six perfectly prepared dishes covered the table, Sophia's eyes lit up.

"Want some drinks?" she suddenly suggested.

Evelyn retrieved two beers from the fridge. Bubbles danced merrily in the glasses as Sophia downed hers in one gulp.

By the third empty can, Sophia's cheeks flushed pink. She swayed the empty container with glazed eyes. "One more~"

"You've had enough." Evelyn reached for the bottle.

Sophia dodged nimbly, staggering to her feet. "I'll... get it myself!"

She wobbled toward the refrigerator, nearly tripping over the coffee table. Evelyn caught her just in time.

"I'm not drunk!" Sophia pouted. "Just slipped..."

Evelyn sighed. "That's what all drunks say."

The words seemed to ignite something. Sophia suddenly grabbed her jacket. "Let's go buy more!"

"Are you insane?" Evelyn restrained her.

Sophia tilted her head thoughtfully, then pulled out her phone. "Calling a driver..."

After the call connected, she slurred her address. "Pick me up! Need more drinks!"

A pause. Then the voice responded, "Open the door."

"Who says I'll listen to you!" Sophia yelled into the phone, completely missing Evelyn's frozen expression.
###Chapter 276

Evelyn Langley's eyes widened as the words "Calling..." flashed on her phone screen, catching her completely off guard.

Sophia Laurent had acted with startling speed.

"Beep—beep—"

The ringing tone pierced the silence of the room.

At the same moment, the doorbell chimed.

Moving mechanically, Evelyn walked to the entrance and pulled open the door.

A familiar male voice came through the phone: "Hello?"

Adrian Klein stood outside, his cell pressed to his ear.

Their eyes locked.

Evelyn's lips twitched.

That girl had absolutely done this on purpose!

In the entire city, who else could reach her home within ten minutes except Adrian who lived next door?

Half an hour later.

Evelyn gently closed the bedroom door behind her—Sophia had already fallen into a deep sleep.

Turning around, her gaze collided with the man seated on the sofa.

Adrian was studying the scattered liquor bottles on the coffee table, his brow slightly furrowed.

"These..."

"Were hers," Evelyn answered quickly.

He looked up. "And you?"

"Just two bottles." She held up two fingers. "Really, I can hold my liquor."

Sophia was different—mixing red wine with beer was practically begging for a hangover.

Adrian sighed. "Stay put."

Rolling up his shirt sleeves, he revealed toned forearms.

Evelyn watched blankly as he cleaned up, her alcohol-slowed thoughts struggling to keep pace.

Only when the trash bag was securely tied did she snap back to reality.

"I'll take this out," Adrian said, lifting the bag.

Evelyn suddenly stood. "I'm coming too!"

The night breeze carried a slight chill, making her instinctively hunch her shoulders.

"Put this on." A jacket appeared before her.

The hallway motion sensor lights flickered intermittently.

Adrian walked ahead, his shadow stretching long behind him.

Evelyn stepped carefully on his elongated silhouette, matching his pace.

"Aunt Eleanor approached me today," he said abruptly.

"About the arranged marriage?"

"Mhm."

The trash bin clanged shut.

They fell into step along the community pathway.

"The Kleins don't need marriage alliances," Adrian said calmly. "But she's insistent."

Eleanor Roland came from an elite family and had flourished after marrying into the Klein household.

She firmly believed equal social standing was the foundation of marital happiness.

Sophia disagreed.

"She won't be returning home for now." Adrian paused. "I'd appreciate it if you could look after her."

Evelyn shook her head. "She's my best friend."

Under the streetlamp, their shadows merged into one.

The night wind tangled through her loose hair.
###Chapter 277

Sophia Laurent had described her cousin Adrian Klein as "distant." Yet here he was, showing unexpected concern for Evelyn Langley.

Evelyn understood. Behind Adrian's aloof exterior lay surprising thoughtfulness. He simply struggled with words, choosing to express care through actions instead.

"Contact me if this happens again."

His gaze lingered on her wineglass. "Alcohol numbs the senses. Mild cases cause dizziness and nausea. Severe ones lead to unconsciousness or shock. Best to drink less."

The tips of Evelyn's ears warmed.

"It harms the body, but offers temporary escape," she cleared her throat. "An occasional drink can be cathartic."

Adrian arched an eyebrow. "Must you choose this method?"

"Different preferences."

He turned abruptly. "You enjoy it?"

Evelyn avoided his penetrating stare. "No."

Even when Nathan Evans shattered her heart, she'd never drowned her sorrows in liquor. She despised losing control.

Adrian chuckled. "No wonder Aunt worried Sophia might corrupt you."

"You can call me when you want to drink."

"So you can clean up my mess?" She stifled a laugh.

"Or share a glass with you."

"You?" Disbelief colored her voice.

"Don't believe me?"

"No."

"We'll test that someday." Warmth glimmered in his eyes.

A car horn shattered the night's tranquility.

Evelyn glanced skyward. "Rain's coming. We should go." She hurried ahead.

Watching her retreating figure, Adrian's lips curved upward.

Inside his Mercedes, Nathan clenched the steering wheel, eyes fixed on the rearview mirror.

Evelyn had changed.

Her smiles no longer belonged to him.

She'd built a new life—with a man who matched him in every way.

The realization tightened his chest.

How could she walk away so effortlessly while he remained trapped in memories?

Raindrops pelted the windshield.

Nathan sat motionless, staring at the darkened mansion.

Without her, it was merely an empty shell.

He lit a cigarette, watching smoke curl through the car's interior.
###Chapter 278

The crimson cigarette tip glowed intermittently in the darkness, wisps of white smoke blurring the man's sharp features.

Nathan Evans leaned against the car door, his silhouette swallowed by the night.

Ash fluttered down silently.

As the last tendril of smoke dissipated, the confusion in his eyes faded.

Evelyn Langley would return to him.

This loss was temporary.

She would be his again whenever he desired.

Nathan crushed the cigarette and strode toward the mansion.

Chloe Valentine stood at the entrance, a saccharine smile plastered on her face.

"Nathan..."

He walked past her without a glance.

Her smile froze.

Quickly recovering, she hurried after him. "I made late-night snacks. I called but you blocked me again—"

Nathan whirled around.

"Complaining?"

"No!" Chloe scrambled to explain. "I just worried when I couldn't reach you..."

A cold smirk twisted his lips as his gaze swept the dining table.

Steamed prawns. Minced pork with eggplant. Sautéed celery with pork slices.

Every dish violated his dietary restrictions.

"Impressive skills." His voice dripped sarcasm. "Never cook again."

Chloe's knuckles whitened around her apron strings.

"Mrs. Watson!"

Silence.

"Mrs. Harrison—"

A maid appeared, trembling.

"Clear the table."

"But these dishes—"

"Feed them to the dogs."

In the master bedroom, Nathan stared at the ceiling.

Suddenly he remembered Evelyn bustling in the kitchen, apron strings tied neatly at her waist.

The girl who once couldn't fry an egg had mastered gourmet cooking for him.

No matter how late, a light always waited.

The table forever set with his favorite dishes—each prepared to perfection.

Now he realized that had been luxury.

......

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Chloe had laid out breakfast again.

Nathan walked past without acknowledgment.

"Nathan." Chloe chased after him with a tie. "Let me help—"

His hand clamped around her wrist like a vise.
###Chapter 279

"Nathan, let me help with your tie."

"I'm wearing a black shirt today."

Chloe Valentine's fingers froze midair, confusion flashing in her eyes. "I know."

Nathan Evans closed his eyes briefly.

A black shirt paired with a floral tie.

Only she could come up with such a combination.

He raised a hand to stop her. "Don't force it if you don't know how."

Without another glance, he walked away.

......

Late at night, Nathan exited the corporate building after a marathon meeting.

Sliding into the driver's seat, he lit a cigarette.

Smoke curled around him as the engine remained silent.

Only when the burning tip seared his fingertips did he finally stub it out.

The luxury car drifted aimlessly through neon-lit streets.

Margaret Evans' call went straight to voicemail.

Somehow, he found himself turning into that familiar narrow alley again.

"Damn rich kids think they can park anywhere!"

"Why do fancy cars keep showing up here lately?"

"Didn't a Bentley come through last week?"

......

At precisely 8 PM, Evelyn Langley appeared at the apartment entrance.

Nathan watched greedily through tinted windows.

Today she wore a teal blue sundress.

Her hair now brushed her shoulder blades, swaying gently with each step.

Flip-flops slapped against concrete as she walked.

Nathan pushed open the car door.

A figure blocked his path.

Adrian Klein stood with one hand in his pocket. "Fancy meeting you here, Mr. Evans."

"Move!"

Seeing Evelyn about to disappear inside, Nathan's voice turned urgent.

Adrian didn't budge.

Only when the blue silhouette vanished did he finally step aside.

"You think the Klein name gives you rights to interfere?"

"Stalking your ex, Mr. Evans?"

"None of your damn business!"

Adrian's expression remained calm. "Reporting illegal activity is every citizen's duty."

Nathan's laugh came out sharp. "Playing righteous now?"

"What if I have ulterior motives?"

Adrian met his glare without flinching.

"You're nothing! How many years have I known her?"

"Time was never the measure of love."

Adrian's quiet words cut like knives. "Some recognize soulmates at first glance. Others spend lifetimes together as strangers."

Each syllable tightened the vise around Nathan's chest.

"Blocking me won't give you a chance. Dream on!"

"I simply want her left in peace."

Turning away, Adrian delivered his parting shot: "She's happy now."

From the alley entrance came angry shouts.

Several elderly men advanced with brooms raised like weapons.

Gritting his teeth, Nathan slammed the accelerator.

"Dylan, let's grab drinks."

Deafening club music blasted through the phone.

Dylan Lowell shouted over the noise: "Julian's here too!"
###Chapter 280

Nathan's voice was clipped. "Address."

"Same place as always."

"Twenty minutes."

......

The nightclub pulsed with neon lights and deafening music.

Nathan pushed open the VIP room door, shutting out the chaos behind him.

"Well, well. Look who finally showed up." Julian smirked, his arm draped around a heavily made-up woman. He jerked his chin toward the entrance.

Nathan strode straight to the corner sofa without glancing at them.

Julian nudged the woman forward. She swayed her hips suggestively toward Nathan.

"Get lost." Nathan caught her wrist mid-reach, his grip bruising.

The woman froze, casting a pleading look at Julian.

"Not your type?" Julian raised an eyebrow. "Want me to call someone else?"

Nathan poured himself a whiskey. "Not interested."

"Tsk—" Julian drew out the sound. "Even when Evelyn was around, you weren't this boring. What's wrong? Did Chloe put you on a leash?"

Ice cubes clinked against glass.

Nathan downed the drink in one swallow.

Julian beckoned the woman back. She giggled and melted into his arms.

"Who pissed off our dear Nathan tonight?" Julian pinched the woman's chin. "Come on, lighten up."

"...Shut up."

"Smile for me?"

Nathan's lips curled into a cold smirk. "You wish."

Julian burst out laughing, leaning in conspiratorially. "Heard you're gonna be a dad. Bit sudden for me to become an uncle, don't you think—"

Nathan's gaze turned lethal. "Looking to die?"

Julian immediately mimed zipping his mouth shut.

Dylan rolled his eyes. "Could you be more obvious?"

"Was I?" Julian feigned innocence.

Dylan deadpanned. "Seriously?"

"Fine, fine." Julian shrugged. "My bad, Nathan."

Dylan reached for the whiskey bottle. "Ignore him. Let's drink—"

Nathan suddenly covered his glass.

"?"

"One's enough."

Dylan blinked. "...Since when?"

"Was I some heavy drinker before?"

"Hell yeah!"

Memories surfaced—Evelyn waiting by the foyer every time he stumbled home drunk. Scowling, scolding him, yet still brewing hangover soup.

Now no one would wait up no matter how much he drank.

"Your eyes look..."

"Strong whiskey." Nathan turned away.

Dylan took a confused sip. Tasted smooth to him.

Julian gave a knowing smile and pinched the woman's waist.

"Naughty!" She giggled. "Let me feed you, Julian~"

"Use this." He tapped her crimson lips.

The room filled with suggestive laughter.

Nathan yanked at his loosened tie.

Even Dylan averted his eyes uncomfortably.

A phone rang abruptly.

"Hello? Evelyn—"
###Chapter 281

Dylan had just stood up when his phone vibrated.

He glanced down to see "Evelyn Langley" flashing across the screen.

Nathan Evans and Julian Roscente simultaneously reached out to grip his shoulders.

The music in the private room cut off abruptly.

Everyone fell silent with unspoken understanding.

Dylan's Adam's apple bobbed as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

On the other end of the line, Evelyn stared at her phone screen for a long moment.

Her fingertip hovered over the call button, hesitating.

Victoria Langley's publishing contract was about to expire.

Without renewal, she needed to find a new editor quickly.

This editor had to specialize in thriller and horror genres.

Preferably with their own promotional resources.

Evelyn scrolled through her contacts.

Her finger paused over Dylan's name.

Her hesitation wasn't about how to ask.

But whether she should make this decision for her mother.

Earlier that morning, her father had said on the phone: "Your mother's been on a creative streak, pulling seven all-nighters in a row. I've been pruning roses in the backyard without making a sound."

Evelyn bit her lower lip.

Her finger finally pressed down.

"Dylan, got a minute?"

He immediately straightened. "For you, Evelyn? Always!"

"I need a favor."

His expression turned serious. "Name it."

Evelyn briefly explained the situation.

Dylan nodded along, interjecting occasional affirmatives.

Nathan narrowed his eyes.

He'd never seen Dylan so attentive with anyone.

Even with their childhood friends, Dylan always kept things lighthearted.

But now...

Nathan's fingers absently tapped against his glass.

Suddenly he thought of Ethan Winston.

That once-closest brother.

Who ended up...

Dylan's voice snapped him back.

"Evelyn, Julian recently invested in a publishing house."

He turned to Julian.

Julian raised an eyebrow.

"Top three in the country. Specializes in literary fiction."

Evelyn was silent for several seconds.

Dylan quickly added, "Want me to make inquiries?"

"Okay."

After hanging up, Julian scoffed.

"Calling her that so sweetly—people might think she's your real sister."
###Chapter 282

Dylan Lowell tilted his head back, downing his drink before slamming the glass onto the table.

"You know nothing. I always give my all for friends. Don't like it? Get lost."

"Friends?" Julian Roscente sneered. "She's already broken up with Nathan. What kind of friendship is this?"

Nathan Evans' gaze darkened as it settled on Dylan.

Dylan suddenly straightened, his expression turning serious. "Evelyn saved my life once. Her breakup with Nathan is none of my damn business."

"Saved your life?" Julian's eyes narrowed. "How?"

Dylan waved a hand. "Long story..." He abruptly changed the subject. "By the way, Julian, there's something I need to ask—"

"I'm going to the restroom." Julian stood abruptly and strode away.

Dylan blinked. The guy bolted faster than a rabbit. Was he avoiding this on purpose?

Julian didn't head to the restroom.

He walked straight to the terrace, lighting a cigarette. Smoke curled around his furrowed brow as he paced restlessly.

Ash fluttered down, though he barely took two drags.

Finally, he stubbed out the cigarette and dialed a number.

Evelyn Langley had just ended her call with Dylan when she tossed her phone onto the sofa and stepped into the shower.

Emerging with damp hair, she noticed two missed calls.

The area code showed Boston.

After a brief hesitation, she returned the call.

"Hello, who's this?"

A dry chuckle came through. "After all these years, you never saved my number, Evelyn?"

The most infuriating part? She had Dylan's number saved.

Evelyn froze. "Julian?"

What kind of midnight madness was this?

Julian caught himself, inwardly cursing his impulsiveness.

"Ahem. I was with Dylan during your call earlier."

"And?"

"I have the resources to help you directly. Why take the roundabout route through Dylan?" His tone carried clear displeasure.

Evelyn replied coolly, "I didn't have your contact information."

Julian: "..."

"Dylan said he'd ask you for me."

"..."

"Evelyn," he said through gritted teeth, "when asking for favors, efficiency matters. Coming to me directly would've been ten times faster. Understand?"

"Not really."

"..."

"You called just to say this?"

Julian scoffed. "I don't owe favors. You helped me once—consider this repayment."

Evelyn's breath caught.

That incident... she'd nearly forgotten.
###Chapter 283

Julian Roscente flicked his cigarette ash, his tone casual. "You helped me at the hotel last time. I don't like owing favors. Even though you and Nathan broke up, a debt is still a debt."

He glanced at his watch. He'd smoked two cigarettes in the hallway—at least twenty minutes. Evelyn Langley hadn't even called him?

Dylan Lowell had clearly said the resources were in his hands.

Top-tier resources, no less.

Why was this woman so dense?

Julian scoffed. "You need a reliable editor? I'll send you a contact."

Evelyn wasn't the type to play coy.

When opportunity knocked, she wouldn't turn it away.

"Thanks."

"Just settling the score."

The call ended. Julian pulled up the editor's WeChat, ready to forward it.

His finger froze mid-air—

He hadn't even added Evelyn as a friend.

He redialed. "Accept my friend request. Relax, I'm not like Ethan Winston. I don't mess with my friends' exes. If it bothers you, delete me after I send the contact."

"Done."

"Good."

After forwarding the contact, Julian turned back toward the private room.

Dylan, cigarette dangling from his lips, teased, "Fall into the toilet?"

"Fuck off."

A female companion immediately pressed against him. "Julian, why'd you abandon me earlier?"

"Want me to take you to the men's room?" Julian pinched her chin.

She playfully thumped his chest.

"Julian, book me for tonight~"

He smirked but didn't respond.

Her smile stiffened.

These rich boys were generous with their money and sweet talk. But their moods shifted faster than flipping a page.

Their hearts were made of stone.

......

By the time they left, it was nearly midnight.

The trio stood outside the bar. Julian asked, "How are you getting back?"

Nathan Evans: "Called a designated driver."

Dylan: "Taking a cab. You?"

Julian: "Staying at a hotel."

"Wow, not bringing anyone? Unusual."

"You think I can't get women?"

Dylan rolled his eyes. "Watch out for STDs."

"None of your business." Julian spotted his car's headlights. "I'm out."

Dylan suddenly grabbed his arm. "About that editor—"

"I sent it already. Stop nagging."

"When? You two weren't even connected."

"Just added her. Got a problem?"

Dylan sobered up instantly. "Since when are you so helpful? Unless—"

"Shut it!" Julian cut him off, sneaking a glance at Nathan.

Damn. His face was darker than ink.

"Just repaying a favor. Don't overthink it!"

One lunatic like Ethan was enough.
###Chapter 284

Julian Roscente detested these lingering attachments.

Dylan Lowell finally relaxed. "At least you have some boundaries..."

"Let go. I'm getting in the car."

"Fine." Dylan released his grip on Julian's sleeve.

Nathan Evans suddenly spoke up.

"You helped her... because of me?"

Julian's hand paused on the car door handle. He turned with a cold smirk. "You're overthinking."

"You two..." Nathan's gaze lingered on Dylan with suspicion. "You've kept in touch with her after our breakup?"

Dylan admitted freely. "Yeah, Evelyn and I stayed in contact. Got a problem?"

Julian narrowed his sharp eyes. "I know what you're implying."

"Whether Dylan kept seeing her or I stepped in to help, you think it's about you."

He paused deliberately. "Let me make this clear—it's about Evelyn Langley herself. Nothing to do with you. Same for Dylan."

Nathan frowned deeply.

"Reason?"

Julian scoffed. "Isn't that how relationships work? She helped us, so we remember the favor."

"You thought she was just arm candy those six years? We hung out two or three times a month. Plenty of chances to know her."

"Take Dylan here. Evelyn fixed his computer, even wrote code for him. Right?"

"Damn right!" Dylan nodded eagerly. "Her programming skills are top-notch. That investment scam last year? She wrote a financial audit program that exposed it."

"And that time—"

As Dylan recounted examples, Nathan grew increasingly unsettled.

This "Evelyn Langley" they described bore no resemblance to the woman he remembered—the one who simply waited at home, managing his domestic life.

Dylan added, "Don't just talk about me. Evelyn helped you too—"

Ahem! Julian cut him off. "Enough. I'm leaving. You two head back."

He swiftly entered the taxi.

"Drive."

......

Evelyn received Julian's message with an editor's contact. She sent a friend request.

Instant approval. An auto-reply appeared:

Hello, please attach your manuscript and contact info for submissions. For business inquiries, call 1372324...

After consideration, Evelyn sent one of Victoria Langley's suspense novels from last year, attaching her phone number.

Night deepened. No reply came.

She remained patient, trusting a response would come.

Meanwhile, Nathan returned to the villa.

Chloe Valentine stood at the entrance as usual, smiling sweetly like a hotel greeter. He had to admire her persistence.

When Chloe reached to steady him, the strong alcohol scent made her recoil slightly.

Nathan summoned Mrs. Watson instead. "Help me upstairs."

In truth, he'd only had two drinks—completely sober. But feigning drunkenness avoided complications.

Mrs. Watson hurried him upstairs before rushing down to prepare hangover soup.

"Mrs. Watson, I hear you've cared for Nathan for years?" Chloe leaned against the kitchen doorway in silk pajamas.

"The kitchen's smoky, Miss Valentine. Perhaps wait in the living room?"

Better yet, stay far away. That voice grates.

Chloe ignored the hint. "You must make this often for him?"

Mrs. Watson didn't look up. "Miss Langley always prepared it. The young master preferred her version."

"......"

When Mrs. Watson turned for a bowl, Chloe quickly sprinkled hidden powder into the pot.
###Chapter 285

Mrs. Watson turned to find Chloe Valentine already wearing a gentle smile. "Please take care of Nathan for me. I'm rather tired and need to rest."

Her skirt fluttered gracefully as she turned and disappeared through the kitchen doorway.

Mrs. Watson stood frozen.

The woman who usually fought to deliver hangover remedies had suddenly changed her tune.

After preparing the remedy, Mrs. Watson carried the tray to the master bedroom.

Nathan Evans hadn't drunk much at the business dinner, but the alcohol on an empty stomach made his gut twist painfully.

He drained the remedy in one gulp.

Mrs. Watson quietly retreated, closing the door behind her.

Nathan lay back, waiting for the pain to subside.

As the discomfort faded, an unnatural heat spread through his body.

He moved to adjust the air conditioning when the door swung open.

Chloe entered barefoot.

The man's slightly open collar revealed his collarbone, his cheeks flushed with intoxication.

His muscular arm rested beside him, those distinct knuckles contrasting starkly against his dark shirt—an image of restrained desire.

It reminded her of their first time.

Back then, Nathan had been equally drunk, yet called out Evelyn Langley's name.

Chloe's pulse quickened as her gaze lingered on his exposed chest.

She leaned in, tracing circles on his skin with her fingertips.

Nathan abruptly turned away.

Chloe stumbled back in shock.

Glancing at her modest nightgown, she recalled how mimicking Evelyn's style had initially caught Nathan's attention.

She marched to the wardrobe and selected a lace nightgown with a sheer back panel.

"Who are you pretending to be?" she muttered. "You climbed into his bed the same way."

Evelyn had spent six years claiming Nathan's heart. Chloe intended to replace her permanently.

Madness flashed in her eyes as she embraced Nathan from behind.

Just as her hands neared his neck, his eyes snapped open. He flung her to the floor.

Nathan stared down coldly. "Even pregnant, you're this desperate. Disgusting."

His gaze shifted in revulsion—then froze.

That was Evelyn's nightgown.

"Did you wear her clothes that first night too?" His voice turned glacial.

Chloe sat paralyzed on the floor, face bloodless.

"Answer me!" Nathan gripped her chin, the pressure drawing a whimper.

Tears streamed down Chloe's cheeks, but the man remained unmoved.
###Chapter 286

"Explain yourself. Was it you—"

Chloe Valentine shrank back. "No... Nathan, you're hurting me..."

Nathan Evans yanked her nightgown collar with a cold laugh. "Then how do you explain this? Only someone experienced could be this skilled."

He still remembered that strange night. One moment he'd been holding Evelyn Langley, the next he woke up to find Chloe in his arms.

He'd blamed it on drunken confusion—never imagining it was all an elaborate scheme.

Rage burned in Nathan's eyes.

"You're digging your own grave!" He hauled Chloe up violently. "Get out! Now!"

A sudden wave of heat surged through him.

He staggered, his Adam's apple bobbing rapidly.

Something was wrong.

Nathan's pupils constricted—this sensation was unmistakably...

"You fucking drugged me?!"

Chloe avoided his gaze, fingers twisting her clothes.

"Who gave you the right?!"

His breathing grew ragged, eyes tinged crimson.

Chloe wiped her tears and stepped closer. "Nathan...you must be suffering..."

Nathan glared icily.

"Let me help you." She bit her lip. "I'll do anything..."

Her fingers moved to unbutton her nightgown.

"Even if you pretend I'm her...even if you call her name...I don't care."

Her voice broke with desperate courage.

"What she won't do, I will. What she won't give, I'll give."

The pitiful words earned only a scornful laugh.

"A stand-in? You?" Nathan sneered. "You're not fit to lick her boots."

"You drugged me, now play the saint. Have you no shame?"

"Calling you a dog insults dogs!"

The vicious words cut deep, but Chloe remained unfazed.

Her bare skin pressed against his chest as she whispered in his ear:

"Let me help you...just like our first time..."

Her floral scent momentarily soothed the fire in his veins.

Nathan's breath hitched.

Seeing his dazed expression, Chloe smiled.

Why waste time when it was this easy?

"Nathan..." She cupped his face.

Their eyes met—her reflection swimming in his darkened gaze.

Her lips parted, inching closer...

At the last second, Nathan shoved her away.

No trace of intoxication remained in his piercing stare.
###Chapter 287

"You...you weren't drugged?"

"Surprised?"

Nathan had forced himself to vomit the moment he sensed something wrong in the bathroom.

That lingering warmth was just residual effects.

"If you're fine, why pretend earlier?"

Nathan's lips curled slightly. "Wanted to watch your fall from grace. Quite entertaining."

Chloe's legs gave way.

"Daring to drug me? Bold move. Pity you've got courage without brains."

"Idiot!"

"Mrs. Watson—"

"Yes, sir?" The housekeeper entered immediately.

Chloe frantically pulled her nightgown on, struggling clumsily.

"Pack her things. Toss her out with her luggage within thirty minutes. Change all access codes. I never want to see anything related to her in this house again."

"Understood, sir."

Chloe was dragged toward the door like a lifeless doll.

Suddenly, she wrenched free. "Don't touch me!"

Mrs. Watson paused.

"I'm carrying the Evans heir! How dare a servant lay hands on me? Could you afford the consequences if the baby's harmed?"

"Once I birth the son and marry in, you'll be the first one fired!"

The housekeeper smiled, eyeing her like a circus clown.

"Too many soap operas, Miss Valentine? In thirty years serving the Evanses, I've never seen anyone climb their way up through a child. Their bloodline's precious, but not just any stray gets to be madam."

Even Margaret Evans' stance was clear—keep the baby, then leave.

These truths even servants understood, yet Chloe remained deluded.

Pity flashed in Mrs. Watson's eyes.

A college girl, humiliating herself like this.

She'd heard every word Nathan said outside the door.

This girl's shamelessness could rival a fortress wall.

"Miss Valentine, go pack. Decide what to take."

The implication was obvious—sell those luxuries to recoup losses.

But Chloe missed it entirely.

"Why should I leave? This is my home!"

"The master has spoken."

"I'm not going! What can you do?"

Mrs. Watson: "..."
###Chapter 288

Her fingers dug into the second-floor railing, nails nearly piercing the metal. "Go ahead and drag me if you dare!"

Nathan Evans stepped out of the bedroom, his gaze icy. "Ten minutes are up. Since you refuse to behave, don't blame me for being ruthless. Mrs. Watson, call security."

"Yes, sir."

Chloe Valentine suddenly paled, clutching her abdomen as she curled inward. "It hurts... my stomach..."

The man remained unmoved.

Mrs. Watson stood frozen, unsure what to do.

Chloe slid to the floor, her silk nightgown soaked with sweat. Trembling, she grabbed Nathan's pant leg. "Save the baby... please..."

"Sir, Miss Valentine seems genuinely unwell..." Mrs. Watson whispered hesitantly.

Nathan turned away without a word. "You handle it."

Mrs. Watson looked ready to cry.

Being a housekeeper these days was pure torment!

......

The ambulance's blue lights pierced the predawn darkness as it entered the gated villa community.

By coincidence, Chloe was admitted to the same hospital where Margaret Evans was recuperating.

The morning call jolted Margaret awake. Mrs. Watson's trembling voice recounted the previous night's drama.

"Outrageous!" Margaret rushed to the maternity ward.

Before she even entered, hysterical screams echoed down the hallway—

"Doctor! My baby can't be in danger!"

"Please save him! I'll do anything!"

The doctor attempted to calm her. "Ma'am, you must relax. This level of agitation will harm the fetus—"

Chloe dug her nails into the doctor's wrist. "Tell me the truth! Is my baby still alive? Did you even try? My husband is the CEO of Evans Group—money is no object!"

Margaret strode in and delivered a stinging slap.

"Enough!"

Clutching her cheek, Chloe shrieked, "You old witch! This is all your fault!"

"Keep this up and you'll lose the baby for real!" Margaret's temple throbbed. "Can't you hear the doctor telling you to calm down?"

"If you hadn't forced me to learn etiquette, I wouldn't have fought with Nathan!" Chloe pounded the hospital bed in hysterics. "If anything happens to my child, it's on your hands!"

Margaret trembled with rage.

The fool didn't realize—this baby was the only thing securing her place in the Evans family now.
###Chapter 289

Margaret Evans let out a cold laugh. "You brought this on yourself, yet you blame me? Keep spouting nonsense and I'll rip your mouth apart!"

"Go ahead! If you don't kill me today, you're a coward—"

"Mrs. Watson!" Margaret trembled with rage. "Call Nathan Evans immediately. Tell him to get his ass here now!"

"Yes, madam!"

The call was hung up twice before finally connecting on the third attempt.

Nathan's voice was icy. "What?"

"Young master, madam requests your presence at the hospital."

"Busy."

"But... madam and Miss Valentine are fighting."

"Oh."

Mrs. Watson froze. "?"

Nathan's tone turned glacial. "Remind her she insisted on keeping Chloe's baby. Now that it's blown up in her face, she can clean up her own mess. Don't bother me."

The line went dead with a sharp click.

Subsequent calls went straight to voicemail.

"Madam, the young master said..."

Margaret glared. "What did he say?"

Mrs. Watson swallowed hard. "He said... the trouble you caused is yours to handle. He won't intervene."

Margaret's face darkened.

A bloodcurdling scream suddenly erupted from the hospital room.

Medical staff rushed in.

"Family members, out! The patient is critical—we need to operate now!"

Margaret's stomach dropped. Had things gone too far? She shouldn't have lost control...

Thirty minutes later, the doctor emerged.

Margaret hurried forward. "Is the baby safe?"

The doctor frowned. "For now. But any further stress could be fatal—next time, we might not save them."

Margaret exhaled in relief.

Isabella Evans arrived in a flurry. After hearing the details, she muttered, "Tough luck. All that drama and still kicking..."

Margaret glanced at the room. "Discharge me."

"You're still recovering. Why rush?"

"If I stay, I'll lose my grandson! I'm moving to the villa to supervise that troublemaker personally."

Isabella gaped. "Mother, have you lost it? Playing nursemaid?"

This was utterly unlike Margaret.

That she valued Chloe's pregnancy, Isabella believed. But becoming a caretaker? Never.

"What's really going on? Why is this baby so important?"

Margaret's eyes narrowed. "Recall the clause in grandfather's will? The New Street project dividends after ten years."

"What does that have to do with Chloe?"

"Foolish girl. Next year marks the decade. New Street's value has multiplied fiftyfold. The other branches are circling like vultures. That child... is the key."
###Chapter 290

"The main branch only has you and Nathan now. How can we compete with the other branches when dividing the inheritance? By headcount, we'd lose out. But if your brother or you had a child, that would change everything."

Margaret Evans lowered her voice.

Isabella Evans gasped in realization. "So that's why you..."

"You're hopeless now. But Chloe Valentine is already carrying our golden ticket."

Isabella's eyes widened. "Five hundred million?"

Margaret smiled without answering.

Inside the hospital room, Chloe heard every word.

She looked down at her flat stomach. Five hundred million...

That sum could secure her future forever.

......

Three days later, Margaret personally handled Chloe's discharge.

The accident had left them both shaken.

At home, Chloe became extra cautious—even giving up her beloved spicy foods.

Margaret treated her like royalty, granting her every whim.

Nathan never showed up.

His phone calls went unanswered or were abruptly ended.

His disdain for Chloe was now unmistakable.

Chloe didn't care anymore.

With five hundred million at stake, who needed Nathan's heart?

Weeks passed, and Chloe's belly began to show.

One day at the foyer, she asked sweetly, "Aunt Margaret, will you make me chicken soup after my prenatal checkup?"

Margaret stiffened.

"Can't Mrs. Harrison make it?"

"I only want yours." Chloe rubbed her stomach.

Margaret clenched her teeth. "Fine."

Returning from the appointment, the soup was ready.

As Margaret ladled it out, Chloe suddenly remarked, "Aunt Margaret, are you pregnant too?"

Margaret's hand jerked. Scalding broth splashed across the table.
###Chapter 291

The door clicked shut softly. Ling Mo's voice broke the silence. "Jichuan City has formidable military strength. If Minister Sikong is determined to support Ye Muchan, this voluntary surrender presents a golden opportunity."

Ye Hongling strode into the inner chamber and retrieved a travel bag from the sandalwood cabinet. Her fingers brushed against a brocade box.

Ling Mo's pupils constricted. His lips pressed into a thin line.

"You begged me twice to implant this in your mind," Ye Hongling turned, her gaze fathomless. "Care to try again?"

Memories of his amnesiac terror surfaced. Ling Mo's Adam's apple bobbed as a low chuckle escaped him. "My lady wouldn't dare."

She'd hesitated even when ignorant of his identity. Now with the truth revealed, she'd never harm him.

Warmth flooded Ling Mo's chest. Beneath her steely exterior, this woman harbored the softest trust. She guarded her heart fiercely, but once given, no force in heaven or earth could make her rescind it.

How fortunate he'd chosen the path to Divine Shadow Hall. Any deliberate approach would have shattered against her icy defenses.

"My lady." His voice roughened.

Ye Hongling lifted her eyes to his jade-smooth features. His gaze held drowning depths of devotion.

"I wouldn't," she admitted coolly.

Ling Mo stilled. Joy radiated from his eyes, gilding his entire being.

"But displease me—" Her tone shifted. "—and the disciplinary whip awaits. You seem to relish punishment."

"Only from my lady's hand." He acquiesced smoothly.

With a faint hum, she turned. "Come. Let's greet this Minis—"

Strong arms yanked her against a solid chest. Ling Mo's lips grazed her crown. "Let him wait."

Ye Hongling stiffened. "Insolence?"

"Utter insolence," he confessed freely. "Flog me or forgive me, my lady. Your silence grants permission."

Ye Hongling: "..."

His embrace tightened. He rested his chin atop her hair. "Grant me one privilege."

"Speak."

"The right to lose control." His voice strained. "Sometimes... I can't stop needing to hold you. Only this proves you're real..."

Not like his previous life, where she'd vanished without warning.

Ye Hongling's breath hitched.

A needle-prick of pain pierced her heart, spreading tiny tremors of ache.
###Chapter 292

Exhaustion weighed heavily on her.

...

The next morning, Chloe Valentine rubbed her temples, complaining about her poor appetite and craving something refreshing.

Margaret Evans had risen early to prepare nourishing bird's nest soup, fish maw broth, and a three-hour simmered pork trotter soup with soybeans.

Chloe spat out the first sip.

"This greasy slop makes me nauseous. Is this even fit for human consumption? I wanted something light, not this layer of lard!"

Margaret's temples throbbed as her carefully prepared meal was rejected. "This is nutritious. Good for the baby."

"Only caring about the fetus? Should pregnant women suffer? This oil slick looks disgusting. How can anyone drink it?"

Suppressing her anger, Margaret asked, "What do you want then?"

"Can't even skim oil properly? Do I need to teach you such basics? I don't know how you've survived this long..."

Each word was a needle, each sentence a dagger.

Margaret, unaccustomed to such disrespect, slammed the table. "Who do you think you're talking to? Don't push your luck, Chloe!"

She failed to notice Chloe's vicious remarks mirrored her own past humiliations.

This was revenge.

With a $500 million bargaining chip in her womb—even if denied entry to the Evans family—she could secure a fortune.

Surely $100 million was achievable?

What was Nathan Evans compared to that sum?

No need to please her future mother-in-law. Time to collect debts with interest.

"Yelling at me over skimming oil? If you hate it, leave. I never begged you to serve me."

"If anything happens to your precious golden grandson... don't say I didn't warn you."

"!"

Margaret took three deep breaths to suppress her rage.

Following Chloe's demands, she painstakingly skimmed the oil spoon by spoon.

After thirty minutes of labor, Chloe only took two sips—sending Margaret's blood pressure soaring...

While the Evans household descended into chaos, Evelyn Langley sat in Professor Eleanor Roland's sunlit courtyard.

June sunlight filtered through grapevines, casting dappled patterns on her white dress.

"These hands were born to hold scalpels," Eleanor teased as the young woman examined her swollen knee.

Evelyn gently pressed the joint, finally smiling. "Noted. Great suggestion, Professor."

"Silly girl, I was joking!" Eleanor tapped her forehead.

But everyone knew this determined woman would follow through.

Like that stubborn boy who switched majors years ago, rising to pinnacles amidst skepticism.

Geniuses achieved what they set their minds to.

"Your latest test results?"

Years of illness had made Evelyn more proficient at reading CT scans than some interns.

"Mostly normal. Seems you've been obedient this time."

The housekeeper chopping vegetables chimed in, "Indeed! Miss Langley's daily medication reminders make forgetting impossible."

"Lillian!" Eleanor's cheeks flushed.

Evelyn blinked. "Let's maintain this then."

Quickly changing subjects, Eleanor said, "Oh, I want you to meet someone."

"Who?"

"Ethan, come out now."
###Chapter 293

Ethan Winston's sudden appearance caught Evelyn Langley completely off guard.

As Professor Eleanor Roland finished speaking, a tall figure emerged leisurely from the study.

Evelyn's pupils contracted slightly.

"Let me introduce," Professor Roland said with a smile, "This is Professor Gregory Hill's prized student, Ethan Winston."

The man's lips curved slightly as he extended his hand toward her. "Long time no see, junior."

"You..." Evelyn's voice tightened. "You're Professor Hill's student?"

"What? Don't I look the part?"

"..."

Professor Roland's gaze shifted between them. "You two know each other?"

Ethan nodded. "We do."

And for quite some time now...

"Well then," Professor Roland chuckled, "Since you're already acquainted, why don't you both stay for dinner?"

Ethan responded politely, "We'd be honored."

Evelyn had already planned to stay for the evening meal.

The dining table was set with several home-style dishes, two of which happened to be Evelyn's favorites.

Without drawing attention, Ethan yielded the seat closest to those dishes to her, taking the adjacent spot for himself.

Professor Roland noticed this exchange and raised an eyebrow meaningfully.

Evelyn remained oblivious, assuming the housekeeper had remembered her preferences. She thought gratefully: The housekeeper still recalls my tastes!

"How old are you, Ethan?" Professor Roland inquired suddenly.

"Twenty-eight. Year of the Dog."

"Starting an investment firm at such a young age is impressive."

Ethan shook his head modestly. "Only with family support. The company just stabilized in recent years."

"Compared to business, I have greater respect for scholars like you and Professor Hill—willing to endure solitude for research."

Professor Roland laughed. "For those passionate about science, it's hardly solitude. Isn't that right, Evelyn?"

"Mmm." Evelyn nodded.

The laboratory, free from scheming and politics, offered purity and simplicity—a genuine comfort.

At least for her and Professor Roland.

Ethan looked enlightened. "How narrow-minded of me. No wonder Professor Hill always called me too worldly for academia."

"Hahaha... Did he really say that?"

"Word for word," Ethan admitted ruefully. "Said it right in front of me and my parents."

"Hahahaha... That sounds exactly like him."

With his polished conversation skills, Ethan soon had Professor Roland laughing heartily.

After dinner, Evelyn volunteered to help clear the table.

To her surprise, Ethan also rolled up his sleeves and entered the kitchen.

"Surprised?" Ethan noticed her gaze as he scraped leftovers into the trash.

Evelyn answered honestly, "A little."

The man chuckled. "Do I really seem so detached from reality in your eyes?"

"You used to."

"..."

The Nathan Evans she knew never set foot in the kitchen. Birds of a feather, so she'd assumed the same of Ethan.

"That's prejudice!" Ethan protested.

Yet the evidence proved his culinary skills were indeed rusty.

Watching him squeeze dish soap onto every single plate, Evelyn hesitated to speak.

"Wrong?" Ethan looked genuinely puzzled. "When I cooked abroad, this was how I always washed dishes..."
###Chapter 294

"There's no right way to wash dishes." Evelyn Langley leaned against the kitchen doorway, watching Ethan Winston's clumsy movements. "As long as they end up clean."

She stepped closer. "But..."

Ethan's hands froze midair.

"First, squeeze a little dish soap." Her fingertip tapped the water's surface. "Let it dissolve before scrubbing with the sponge. Rinse thoroughly at the end."

"Like this?" Ethan followed her instructions.

Just as he reached for the soap, Evelyn caught his wrist.

"Wait."

Ethan raised an eyebrow.

"Use hot water."

The corner of his mouth lifted. "Yes, ma'am."

By the time they finished, night had fallen. They bid farewell to Professor Eleanor Roland.

"I'll drive you." Ethan jingled his car keys. "The subway's closed by now."

Evelyn opened the passenger door. "Then I'll trouble you, Mr. Winston."

The engine hummed to life. Ethan suddenly turned. "Could you call me something else? Senior? Ethan? Even just my name?"

"Of course, Mr. Winston."

"Teasing me?"

Evelyn blinked. "Force of habit."

Ethan chuckled. "Suit yourself."

One day, he'd make her say his name willingly.

......

The car stopped at Harvard's main gate.

"Here's fine." Evelyn unbuckled her seatbelt.

"Not going back to your apartment?"

"Lab data needs processing."

Ethan nodded, watching her walk through the gates. "Stay safe."

The lab lights burned until midnight.

Evelyn shut down her computer and checked each instrument. When she finally turned off the lights, a light rain had begun outside.

June marked the start of Boston's rainy season. Under the streetlamps, raindrops wove a delicate net across the pavement.

The campus path stood empty.

Her umbrella trembled in the wind. A stray cat's cry pierced the night. Evelyn tightened her grip, but rainwater still soaked her shoulder.

That's when the footsteps began.

The steady rhythm of leather soles hitting puddles, maintaining a precise distance behind her.

She quickened her pace.

The footsteps immediately grew urgent.
###Chapter 295

Evelyn suddenly remembered Natalie's warning from last week.

A deranged stalker had been targeting lone female students near Harvard's backstreets, with two reported incidents already.

Her fingers tightened around her backpack strap.

Footsteps echoed persistently behind her, maintaining a deliberate distance.

Evelyn's hand slid toward the pepper spray in her bag.

A habit she'd developed since living alone—now proving necessary.

The footsteps abruptly closed in.

A chill crawled down her spine as warm breath grazed her neck.

Just as she prepared to whirl around—

"Evelyn!"

Ethan's voice cleaved through the darkness.

He stood beneath a streetlamp, a black umbrella shielding him, his gaze razor-sharp as it locked onto the shadow behind her.

The footsteps froze.

Then came the frantic sound of retreating footsteps.

Ethan strode forward, his expression softening instantly. "You're safe now."

Only then did Evelyn realize her legs were trembling.

Steadying her with one hand, he dialed his phone with the other. "Charlie, check campus surveillance near Academy Road—we've got a stalker."

His voice held terrifying calm.

Evelyn's lips parted soundlessly.

His jacket, still warm from his body, enveloped her drenched shoulders.

"Can you walk?" he asked.

She nodded.

The umbrella tilted slightly, shielding her completely.

They moved through the rain in silence.

"How did you—"

"Lab lights don't turn off till ten." Ethan cut her off. "I timed it."

Evelyn froze.

He'd waited nearly three hours in the rain.

"Worth the wait." His lips curved slightly. "Finally got to play hero."

Her nose stung.

"Thank you."

"Try another word."

"Like what?"

Ethan halted abruptly.

Raindrops shattered like crystal against the umbrella's edge.

"Like..." His gaze dropped to her faintly reddened eyes. "Let me walk you home every night from now on."
###Chapter 296

"You're so handsome. I'm smitten. Let's try dating. Be my boyfriend... things like that."

"Each request is more outrageous than the last." Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

"My greatest trait is acting on impulse."

Ethan grinned.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Then keep dreaming."

He ignored her rejection, his smile unwavering. "First dream, then act."

"Success isn't guaranteed." She deliberately deflated him.

"No regrets in trying. Who knows? It might work."

Evelyn fell silent.

Ethan walked her to the stairwell. "Go on up."

"Thanks."

"Call me anytime. I'll come running."

"Mhm."

"You're humoring me again." He chuckled. "I know you're thinking: 'I'll agree now but won't actually reach out.'"

Her lips twitched.

"I know you're fiercely independent. But when you need help, remember me. Doesn't have to be your first thought. Just... remember."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Okay."

"Go ahead."

He watched her ascend until her bedroom light flickered on before turning away.

——

Chloe had been recuperating at the Evans estate for over two weeks. The baby's condition stabilized.

With staff attending to her and Nathan absent, life was unexpectedly pleasant.

Post-morning sickness, she glowed, having gained five pounds.

In contrast, Margaret looked haggard.

Though her weight remained unchanged, dark circles shadowed her eyes. Severe hair loss and insomnia plagued her.

Chloe summoned her at all hours for whims. Repeated disruptions left Margaret jumpy, startling awake at night.

Meanwhile, Chloe shopped lavishly, slept soundly, and dined exquisitely.

Today, Margaret finally snapped. She abandoned Chloe at the mall and returned home.

Chloe stormed in later, smirking coldly.

"Abandoning your pregnant granddaughter-in-law? How maternal! What if something happened? Don't care about me or your great-grandchild?"

Margaret, barely rested, flared up.

"Security was everywhere! Mrs. Watson accompanied you! Quit the dramatics!"

"I tolerate you for the baby's sake. Don't overestimate your importance."

With that, she scoffed and ignored Chloe.

Chloe seethed silently.

Soon regaining composure, she ordered fruit before heading to the garden.

"Bring my sunscreen too."

Suddenly, the doorbell rang.
###Chapter 297

"Mrs. Evans, Mr. Evans sent me to retrieve an important document." The impeccably dressed assistant stood at the foyer, his expression respectful.

Margaret set down her teacup with a clink. "What document requires such urgency?"

"It's the bid proposal for next week's tender. Mr. Evans needs to verify some data."

Margaret nodded. "Follow me."

Chloe Valentine sauntered out of her bedroom just in time to see them heading toward the study. Her eyes lit up.

She deliberately slowed her pace, lingering behind them. The study door swung open and shut—but the assistant's hasty exit left it slightly ajar.

Glancing around to confirm no one was watching, Chloe pushed open the normally locked door.

The sandalwood bookshelves emitted a faint woody scent. Neatly organized files stood behind glass panels. A tea set glowed warmly on the table by the floor-to-ceiling window.

Her gaze landed on the desk—where two manila folders lay carelessly open.

"Thought this was a restricted area," Chloe muttered, picking up one folder.

Inside were dense spreadsheets filled with technical jargon that made no sense to her.

"Whatever." She randomly pulled out a sheet, stuffed it into the other folder, and rearranged them exactly as she'd found them.

Margaret's voice drifted upstairs. "Mrs. Watson, have you seen Chloe?"

Chloe's heart skipped. She slipped out and leaned against the hallway wall, pretending to scroll through her phone.

"What are you doing here?" Margaret eyed her suspiciously.

"Better signal upstairs." Chloe waved her phone. "Pregnant women need entertainment. What's wrong with watching videos?"

Margaret frowned. "Less screen time. It's bad for the baby."

At dusk, Nathan returned looking weary.

He went straight upstairs and entered the study. His eyes narrowed at the folders on the desk.

Someone had switched them—the darker one belonged on top, but now the lighter one was in its place.

"Mom!" Nathan emerged with a stormy expression. "Who's been in my study?"

Margaret paused on the stairs. "Your assistant came for documents yesterday. Is something wrong?"
###Chapter 298

"Who touched the documents on the low cabinet?"

Nathan Evans' voice was icy.

Chloe Valentine set down her bowl of bird's nest soup, blinking innocently. "I only opened the drawer. Didn't touch anything else."

Nathan held up two files. "Someone swapped the pages."

Chloe feigned surprise. "Only Mrs. Watson and your assistant were in the study yesterday. The assistant wouldn't dare mess with your things, so that leaves..."

Her meaningful gaze drifted toward Margaret Evans.

Margaret's face paled. "Shut up! This is between me and my son!"

Turning to Nathan, she pleaded, "I did go to the study yesterday, but only to retrieve the files you requested. Your assistant waited outside the entire time—I swear on my life."

"Could Mrs. Watson have—"

Mrs. Watson hastily waved her hands. "The young master forbids us from touching anything in the study. I'm always extra careful."

Nathan shook his head. "Yesterday wasn't cleaning day."

Chloe stirred her soup lazily. "I don't even have a key to the study. Seems the only possibility is you, Margaret."

Margaret trembled with rage. "How dare you accuse me? Why would I tamper with my own son's documents?"

Chloe smirked. "Weren't you throwing a tantrum just the other day?"

Nathan examined the files. Though nothing was missing, the critical pages had been rearranged. This petty sabotage was exactly Margaret's style.

"Forget it." Nathan closed the files. "A mistake in these contracts could cost millions. Mother, don't let it happen again."

He turned to leave.

Margaret's eyes reddened. "Nathan! It wasn't me!"

"Business calls. We'll talk later."

Watching her son's retreating back, Margaret choked on unshed tears.

Chloe pushed her bowl away. "Disgusting! Make it again!"

"You don't deserve bird's nest!" Margaret finally exploded. "Holding that unborn child over our heads—I've had enough!"

Chloe sneered. "What? Don't want your precious grandchild now?"

"Any spawn from your womb isn't worth keeping!" Margaret roared. "Have it or don't—I don't care!"

She stormed upstairs, returning ten minutes later with a suitcase.

"Everyone—we're moving back to the estate!"
###Chapter 299

Finally getting rid of that jinx?

Thank heavens!

Blessed be!

For the first time, the servants thought Madam was absolutely brilliant.

In the blink of an eye, the luxurious villa stood empty except for Chloe Valentine's solitary figure.

She stood frozen in the deserted living room, unable to process what had just happened.

......

Night fell over the Evans family estate, every window ablaze with light.

Isabella Evans had barely stepped through the front door when she spotted Margaret Evans reclining on the sofa enjoying a massage.

"Mom? You're back?"

"Hmm."

"Weren't you supposed to be playing maid for Chloe—I mean, weren't you taking care of her?"

It had been over half a month. Why return so suddenly without even a heads-up?

Something was definitely wrong.

Margaret snorted. "Don't mention that shameless hussy. Bad luck!"

"What happened?" Isabella sat beside her. "Tell me everything."

The floodgates opened as Margaret poured out every grievance from the past two weeks.

At the height of her fury, she shoved the masseuse aside and stood with hands on hips, unleashing a torrent of curses.

"...In all my years, I've never met a more brazen woman! Might as well have let Nathan marry Evelyn Langley!"

At least Evelyn was cultured and knew how to respect elders.

The comparison made Margaret want to slap herself twice over.

Seeing her mother tremble with rage, Isabella's eyes reddened too.

That last slap had been too light.

Should've given her a few more!

"And your brother—" Margaret's voice cracked mentioning her son. "He actually believed that hussy's lies, thinking I tampered with his files! His own mother! He'd rather trust an outsider than me!"

Isabella fumed. "Nathan's gone too far! I'm calling him right now—"

She yanked out her phone without hesitation.

Margaret watched coldly.

She wasn't taking the blame for this.

The call rang endlessly before connecting—

"Bro! Did you know Mom came home?"

Nathan Evans was at an upscale club discussing business.

The mini-drama industry was booming, with Dylan Lowell's media companies raking in profits—he wanted Nathan to share the spoils.

They'd just finalized partnership details, set to sign contracts tomorrow.

Isabella's call interrupted at the worst moment.

"Home? Where?"

"The family estate, obviously! You and Chloe made Mom's old illness flare up again. And here you are—one living it up in the villa, the other partying at clubs!"

Loud music bled through the phone, clearly from some entertainment venue.

Margaret chose that moment to clutch her forehead with a pained groan.

Nathan frowned. "Is Mom okay? Did you call the doctor?"

Isabella sneered. "Now you care? Where was this concern earlier? You and Chloe are two peas in a pod! Mom tried helping her, and she repaid kindness with betrayal—while you took her side against Mom."

"You've broken my heart, Nathan!"

She hung up abruptly.

Nathan stared at his phone, dazed.

Broken her heart?

Perhaps...

He shook his head with a bitter smile.

Dylan had only caught snippets but recognized family drama.

Seeing Nathan's predicament, he hesitated to speak.
###Chapter 300

Nathan Evans raised his hand to signal the bartender. A bottle of vodka was swiftly placed on the counter. He twisted off the cap, and the amber liquid poured out, glinting coldly in the glass.

Dylan Lowell watched with growing concern. "Bro, that's too strong."

Nathan ignored him, tilting his head back and downing the drink in one go. His Adam's apple bobbed as the alcohol burned his throat, but it did nothing to numb the pain in his chest.

"Give me your phone," he suddenly demanded.

Dylan hesitated before pulling it out. "Who are you calling—"

Before he could finish, the phone was snatched from his hand. Nathan's fingers trembled as he dialed the number he knew by heart. His knuckles turned white as the ringing tone filled the silence.

"Evelyn..." His voice was rough, like sandpaper. "I miss you."

Three seconds of silence stretched on the other end.

"Nathan?" Evelyn Langley's voice was icy.

He gripped the phone like a lifeline. "Let's start over. I swear—"

"I heard you're going to be a father." She cut him off. "Congratulations."

The dial tone buzzed in his ear, but Nathan remained frozen, the phone still pressed to his face. Dylan watched as the light in his eyes dimmed, replaced by hollow emptiness.

"Bro..."

Nathan suddenly laughed, grabbing the bottle and chugging straight from it. Clear liquid dripped down his chin—whether it was vodka or tears, no one could tell.

"Tell me..." He slurred, gripping Dylan's arm. "If I drank myself to death, would she come see me one last time?"

Dylan yanked the bottle away in horror. "Are you insane?!"

At 2 a.m., Nathan staggered through the doors of his villa. Moonlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, stretching his shadow long and thin.

He stumbled straight to the study and booted up the long-dormant surveillance system. The blue glow of the screen reflected in his bloodshot eyes, making him look almost ghostly.

His finger hovered over the mouse.

Suddenly, he remembered this exact day a year ago.

Back then, Evelyn had curled up in this very study, knitting him a scarf under the lamplight. When the yarn rolled to the floor and she bent to pick it up, he had wrapped his arms around her from behind.

"Stop it..." She had laughed, squirming away. "You'll make me mess up the stitches."

Nathan clicked on the earliest surveillance file.
###Chapter 301

The surveillance footage froze at exactly 6:00 PM.

The living room stood empty.

Evelyn Langley curled up alone in the corner of the sofa.

Nathan Evans recognized it immediately—she was waiting for him again.

No TV played. Her phone lay silent on the coffee table.

She hugged her knees like a forgotten rose in the shadows.

The "home" he'd idealized—the light always left on for him—had been built from her endless waiting and compromises.

"My childhood home only ever had nannies..."

"Evelyn, how I envied you growing up with parents..."

"They still believe money can buy familial love..."

"You showed me what real warmth feels like..."

"I'd imagine coming home to see you cooking in the kitchen..."

"Our children playing in the garden while I push you on the swing..."

"We'll grow old together like this..."

Nathan's own words from years ago echoed in his ears.

He'd wanted a warm home.

Time had eroded those promises from his memory. Yet Evelyn remembered—and had been quietly building the future he'd once painted.

Now everything lay in ruins.

Nathan slapped himself hard across the face.

Crack.

The sharp sound cut through the silent night.

Too late.

He'd lost her. Lost the life he'd dreamed of. Lost the woman who loved him most.

A tear splattered onto the sandalwood table, spreading into a dark stain.

The timestamp jumped to 1:00 AM.

He finally returned.

Reeking of alcohol, he strode past her sleeping form on the sofa and went upstairs without a glance.

Evelyn opened her eyes the moment his footsteps faded.

For three full minutes, she stared at the crystal chandelier overhead.

Then she sat up slowly, gazing blankly toward the staircase.

She hadn't been asleep at all.

What had she been thinking in that moment?

Nathan couldn't bear to imagine.

Disappointment accumulates drop by drop.

Breakups aren't impulsive decisions—they're the culmination of countless nights of quiet despair.

He'd taken her loyalty for granted.

Now came the reckoning.

Nathan stared at the screen until a gust of wind startled him awake.

He'd almost forgotten why he'd pulled up the footage.

With a click, he opened the past month's recordings...

Chloe Valentine had been asleep when the front door opened downstairs.

Her lips curled into a smirk.

You stormed out so dramatically—yet came crawling back within hours?
###Chapter 302

Chloe Valentine stroked her swollen belly, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

With a 500 million dollar bargaining chip growing inside her, what did she have to fear?

Margaret Evans' dramatic exit was perfect. The old hag might as well take all those servants with her—this way Chloe could replace them with her own people.

She sauntered lazily toward the kitchen, craving a snack.

The mansion stood eerily empty, devoid of any human presence.

Her gaze landed on a pair of polished men's leather shoes by the entrance.

Nathan was home?

Her eyes lit up as she hurried to change into a scandalous red lace nightgown.

Tiptoeing to the study door, she deliberately softened her voice. "Nathan? Are you in there?"

A pointless question.

The lit study could only mean one person.

"Enter."

His icy baritone sent shivers down her spine.

Chloe pushed the door open, wearing a saccharine smile.

"Nathan..."

He looked up to see her nearly transparent nightgown.

The flimsy spaghetti straps barely clung to her shoulders, her chest barely concealed.

Not seductive. Just cheap.

Encouraged by his lack of reaction, she grew bolder.

"You've been working so hard lately. Let me give you a massage..."

She deliberately avoided mentioning their last fight, pretending it never happened.

Nathan watched her with detached indifference.

His disgust had long since numbed him.

Since he couldn't change the situation, he might as well ignore it.

Chloe mistook his silence for consent.

Her hands slid down his shoulders.

"Don't you miss me and the baby after all this time apart?"

Nathan suddenly grabbed her wrist.

"Who tampered with the files in my study?"

"H-how would I know?" She forced a laugh. "Maybe Aunt Margaret accidentally moved them..."

"Really?" His冷笑 was razor-sharp.

"Aunt Margaret took all the servants away. There's no one left to take care of me and the baby..."

"What do you want?"

"At least call Mrs. Watson and the others back—"

Nathan stood abruptly.

Slap! Slap!

Two stinging blows landed on Chloe's cheeks.

He yanked her hair, dragging her to the computer monitor.

"Then explain this. Who is this person in the surveillance footage?"
###Chapter 303

The surveillance footage clearly captured her sneaking into the study and swapping the documents.

It also showed all the times she'd hurled insults at Margaret Evans and bossed her around.

Chloe Valentine froze in shock.

Perhaps it was the damning video evidence. Or perhaps it was the two brutal slaps Nathan had just delivered.

"I thought you were just vain and shallow. I didn't realize you were also a pathological liar, viciously cruel, and a master at stirring up trouble."

"These slaps are to remind you of your place and crush any delusions you might have. Consider this a warning—if you cause any more trouble—"

Nathan Evans narrowed his eyes, his voice icy.

"I'll show you what true suffering feels like."

Chloe staggered back, her terror so overwhelming she barely registered the stinging pain on her face.

"N-Nathan, I'm sorry..."

His expression remained impassive.

"I'll go apologize to Aunt Margaret right now! She can hit me, yell at me—whatever it takes to make her forgive me..."

Still, he said nothing.

Panic set in. Tears and snot streamed down her face. "I didn't mean to do it! Maybe my hormones are out of whack because of the pregnancy..."

Nathan watched her performance with cold detachment.

"...Finished?"

She blinked.

"Done crying?"

"Nathan..."

"Then go pack your things."

"W-what?"

He smirked. "Did you think I was joking last time when I told you to get out? Letting you stay an extra two weeks was more than generous."

"No! You can't do this!" Chloe shook her head violently, trembling at the thought of being thrown out.

"I'm carrying your child! You can't kick me out!"

Nathan dialed security without hesitation.

"No...I won't go..."

Before security arrived, Chloe snapped.

She lunged at him. "How dare you throw me out?! Your mother cares so much about this baby—what will you tell her?!"

Caught off guard, Nathan found himself grabbed by the crazed woman as she pummeled him wildly.

"Nathan Evans! You bastard!"

"I'm pregnant, and you're still hung up on your ex—"

"I'd rather die than leave!"

Her shrill screams grated on his nerves. With an irritated shove, he pushed her away.

Chloe slammed into the wall with a dull thud.

But she seemed numb to the pain. Regaining her footing, she charged again.

This time, Nathan sidestepped smoothly.

Unable to stop her momentum, Chloe crashed straight into the edge of the desk.

She froze. Her face drained of color.

A warm wetness trickled down her thighs.

She looked down.

Bright red blood streamed down her legs.

Drip.

Drip.

The vivid crimson spread across the floor.

She felt something vital slipping away...

Her legs gave out. She nearly fainted.

"Ahhh—my baby—"

A bloodcurdling scream pierced the night.

......

Nathan dropped her at the hospital and left.

After all her previous fake emergencies, how could this one be real?

Just another act.

He'd see how long she could keep it up!

"Where's the family? We can't save the fetus—she needs an induced abortion. A relative must sign the consent form!"
###Chapter 304

The nurse's fingers fidgeted nervously over the medical chart.

"What's going on?" The doctor frowned impatiently.

"The family...has left."

"What do you mean left?" The doctor's voice sharpened abruptly.

The nurse shrank back. "This patient is a Super VIP client. She's been hospitalized several times before."

The doctor was newly assigned to the night shift and unfamiliar with Chloe Valentine's case.

But the nursing staff knew—every time this particular patient was admitted, the entire department braced for impact.

"This isn't the time for that!" The doctor slammed the chart down. "The fetus has no heartbeat. The mother is hemorrhaging. Emergency surgery now!"

"But...the man who brought her in just left her here..."

The doctor's eyes turned icy.

The world of the wealthy truly knew no mercy.

"Check visitor logs," the doctor gritted out. "Contact anyone who can sign the consent forms!"

......

Margaret Evans' phone blinked silently on her nightstand.

The screen lit up, then darkened into oblivion.

Isabella Evans was drowning in the deafening music of a nightclub when her phone rang for the third time.

"What?" she snapped upon answering.

The fragmented voice came through the line.

"The hospital? Chloe Valentine?" She let out a derisive laugh. "This act again?"

"Miscarriage? Don't joke—that womb of hers is harder than stone!"

"Sign something? No time! Let her play her games alone!"

She hung up and melted back into the dancing crowd.

......

The nurse set down the receiver, face grim.

"Well?" The doctor pressed.

"No one's willing to come..." The nurse hesitated. "Dr. Wang, this pregnant woman...her situation is complicated."

The doctor raised an eyebrow.

"Rumor has it...she was trying to leverage the baby into marrying rich." The nurse lowered her voice. "The father never wanted the child."

"Last hospitalization, she had a huge fight with the man's mother..."

The doctor's gaze hardened.

"Prepare emergency protocols." Her voice was steel. "Pull surveillance footage. Follow procedure."

Snapping on gloves, she spoke with cold precision:

"Begin surgery."
###Chapter 305

"If you truly wish to save your life, choose your face."

Xiao Lanyuan's chest tightened, but he made his decision quickly. He had never been one to hesitate.

"I'd rather ruin this face than lose the use of my legs." His voice was low. "At least I can still move freely. If you're ever in danger, I can reach you in time."

Fu Zhaoning frowned slightly.

What stood between them that would require such urgency?

His words sounded as though they might be separated in the future.

"Xiao Lanyuan, what do you mean?"

"Years ago, at the Grand Medical Conference, several renowned physicians discussed it." His gaze darkened. "If faced with an incurable poison, one could use internal energy to force the toxin into the legs. It would cripple them, but it would save a life."

Fu Zhaoning's fingers twitched.

"If you ever have to save me like that, don’t choose that path."

He would never accept being a cripple. Even if his face were ruined, at least he could still protect her.

"True, legs are more important than a face."

After a moment of contemplation, Fu Zhaoning nodded in agreement. Mobility was far more valuable than appearance.

"If we really use this method, will the entire side of my face be destroyed?"

Xiao Lanyuan raised his hand to touch his left cheek.

"Don’t."

Fu Zhaoning seized his wrist. "Your hands aren’t clean. Don’t touch the poisoned scar."

She had been extra cautious these days. His scar had begun to fester, requiring meticulous care with each dressing change.

"Is it that bad?"

Xiao Lanyuan smiled bitterly. She had taken away all the mirrors, even stopping him from glimpsing his reflection while combing his hair.

"A grown man like you, why care so much about your face?" Fu Zhaoning scoffed lightly. "It's not like you rely on it for a living."

She avoided answering directly.

But Xiao Lanyuan already understood. If the poison were forced into his face, it would likely ruin it completely.

Now, at least half of his features remained intact. If his face were completely disfigured, how could he stand beside her?

Let the world mock her for marrying a hideous cripple?

A dying man, no less.

"You're right." He suddenly laughed.

Yet in the days that followed, Fu Zhaoning noticed his growing distance.

Where they once shared a carriage, he now rode alone on horseback. Where they once stayed in the same room, he now booked separate quarters.
###Chapter 306

Chloe Valentine's fingers trembled as she listened to the dial tone on the other end of the line.

Again.

Always using this tactic to threaten her.

Margaret Evans let out a cold laugh and tossed her phone onto the couch. She knew Chloe's weakness all too well—that unborn child was her only bargaining chip.

This woman wouldn't dare make a real move.

With this realization, Margaret suddenly found her past days of swallowing her pride utterly ridiculous.

She'd deliberately sent all the household staff away, just to let Chloe taste the bitterness of isolation.

"Serves her right." Adjusting her face mask in the mirror, she hummed a tune.

At the nurses' station, two on-duty nurses exchanged glances.

"Rich family feuds are terrifying."

"That's why mistresses always get their comeuppance."

......

Chloe had been lying in the hospital bed for forty-eight straight hours.

Severe hemorrhaging had sent her back to the operating room.

When she was wheeled out, her entire body looked drained of color, her lips pale with a bluish tint. Though her eyes were open, she lacked even the strength to speak.

Infection compounded by massive blood loss.

This time, she'd truly suffered.

Only a temporary hired caregiver bustled around the VIP ward.

She'd called Nathan Evans countless times—all unanswered. The nurses' attempts to reach Margaret also yielded no response.

They'd abandoned her completely.

Physical agony and mental collapse drove her to hysteria.

The entire nursing staff avoided her yet had no choice but to deal with her.

What else could they do? She was a VIP patient.

......

Margaret was at the mahjong table when Isabella Evans called.

"What? The baby's gone?"

Her tile clattered onto the table.

How?

No matter how intense their fights had been before, the pregnancy had always been fine. Why couldn't it be saved this time?

"Mom, forget about that five hundred million. Let's just take our rightful share."

An emptiness filled Margaret's chest.

For the lost fortune, and for the grandchild she'd never met.

It was a life, after all. Blame that worthless mother of his!

If she'd just obediently carried the child to term, she could've lived in luxury. Instead, she had to make trouble.

Then again, what good genes could a woman like that produce? Maybe losing it was a blessing.

All that scheming, only to end up with nothing.

She even found herself missing Evelyn Langley.

Though from an ordinary background, at least she'd been sensible and attentive, taking perfect care of Nathan. Most importantly, she'd had dignity!

Never shameless like Chloe.

Margaret startled at her own thoughts.

Why did Evelyn keep coming to mind lately? Especially during those days waiting on Chloe.

Ah, comparisons are odious.

Not that she'd ever admit a single good thing about Evelyn.

......

Chloe lay in the hospital bed, her hollow gaze fixed on the ceiling.

A soulless husk.

She couldn't understand—why hadn't Nathan come? Where had Margaret gone?

Hadn't that old hag cared most about the baby in her womb?

Why had she disappeared now?

She waited and waited, until her tears ran dry. Yet the first person to push open her hospital room door turned out to be...
###Chapter 307

Emily pushed open the hospital room door to find Chloe applying lipstick in front of the mirror.

"Chloe?" she called tentatively.

The reflection whipped around, leaving a scarlet streak across her cheek.

"What are you doing here?" Chloe snapped her compact shut, eyes narrowing.

Emily set the fruit basket on the bedside table. "I heard you were hospitalized—"

"Heard?" Chloe's laugh was brittle. "From who? Everyone gossiping about my abortion?"

Emily froze. "I only knew you were unwell—"

"Stop pretending!" Chloe flung the blanket aside. "Just admit you came to gloat!"

The IV needle jerked, sending blood snaking up the tube.

Emily rushed forward. "Calm down—"

"Get out!" Chloe slapped her hand away. "You were always the fake nice girl in our dorm, whispering behind my back!"

"I never—"

"Come to kick me while I'm down?" Chloe's voice turned shrill. "Newsflash—I'll always be better than some subway-riding pauper like you!"

Emily's face drained of color.

The readmission forms in her bag suddenly felt foolish.

"My mistake." She grabbed her purse. "May you get... exactly what you deserve."

"Wait!" Chloe hurled a pillow. "Who do you think you are? Lecturing me?"

The thud echoed as Emily walked out.

Collapsing onto the bed, Chloe dug her nails into her palms.

The ringing phone made her lunge for it. "Nathan?"

"Useless girl!" Her mother's voice screeched over mahjong tiles. "Send money now!"

Chloe's fingers trembled. "Mom—"

"Don't lie! Your brother said you're sleeping with some tycoon in Boston!"

"I'm not—"

"Liar!" Linda Lombardi shrieked. "After all I've done, you owe me!"

Chloe bit her lip until copper bloomed, mingling with smeared lipstick.

"No money." She suddenly smiled. "Unless... you want to collect my corpse?"

Silence.

Then came the eruption of curses.

Chloe ended the call and smashed the phone against the wall.

The screen shattered like her life.
###Chapter 308

Linda Lombardi latched onto the word "broke" like a lifeline. She slammed the mahjong table with such force that the tiles clattered violently.

"Can't find a man to sleep with?" she screeched. "Sleep with one and get paid! Do I have to spell it out for you?"

Chloe Valentine's grip on her phone turned her knuckles white. "Where would I even find someone? Who'd want me now?"

The line went silent for several beats.

Linda narrowed her eyes, finally registering the odd note in her daughter's voice. She hurried out of the noisy game room and locked herself in a bathroom stall.

"What about that rich boyfriend of yours?" she hissed. "Last time you said you were marrying into money!"

Chloe's nose stung as hot tears spilled over. Her story came out in broken fragments, dissolving into sobs by the end.

"What?!" Linda's voice spiked. "They're dumping you after sleeping together and getting you pregnant?"

Her eyes darted craftily before lowering her voice. "Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll bring your brother. This isn't over!"

......

In the lab, Evelyn Langley stared fixedly at her computer screen.

Her thesis was in the final stretch, and she'd practically moved into the laboratory. Natalie Blanchet clicked her tongue while passing by. "Trying to become immortal through sleep deprivation?"

Evelyn rubbed her burning eyes. Without a research team, she had no choice but to push herself.

At lunchtime, she headed to the break room as usual. With Adrian Klein teaching all day, she'd have the space to herself.

She stretched luxuriously before pushing open the inner door.

Adrian had voluntarily given up this break room for her. The windowless back room stayed cool and dark—perfect for napping. She'd set up a folding bed behind the door, maintaining both privacy and space efficiency.

Natalie and Vincent Macmillan had been impressed during their first visit. "Genius spot," they'd said. "Cool and shaded."

Oliver Lancelot and Camille Valrose had also dropped by. Oliver marveled at the spaciousness while Camille studied the folding bed for a long moment.

"Decent," she'd finally remarked. "At least it's far enough away."

......

Adrian hadn't planned to visit the lab.

But a student spilled soup on his shirt during lunch, leaving an oil stain. Remembering his spare clothes in the break room, he decided to change.

He eased the door open carefully, not wanting to disturb anyone who might be resting inside.
###Chapter 309

The laboratory was eerily quiet during lunch break.

Adrian Klein pushed open the lounge door and headed straight for the sink.
Cold water streamed over his slender fingers as he cupped his hands to splash his face.
Droplets trailed down his jawline, dampening his shirt collar.

A faint rustling came from the inner wardrobe.
Evelyn Langley stirred awake at the sound of the door.
Her cot was wedged behind the door, leaving her hidden in shadow.

A man's lean silhouette filled her vision.
He unbuttoned his shirt, revealing taut waist muscles as the fabric slipped away.
Evelyn's breath hitched, fingers tightening around the blanket's edge.

Speaking up would only heighten the awkwardness.
She squeezed her eyes shut, feigning sleep.
But the image of that sculpted torso burned behind her eyelids.

Adrian froze mid-motion when his peripheral vision caught the cot.
His pupils contracted.
Gently pulling the door wider, he discovered the curled-up figure.

The fallen blanket pooled on the floor.
He picked it up with the care reserved for fragile artifacts.
His fingertips grazed her stray hair, recoiling as if shocked.

Evelyn caught his crisp cedar scent.
When the blanket settled over her, she barely suppressed a shiver.
His breathing hovered dangerously close, stretching seconds into eternity.

The retreating footsteps finally came.
She bolted upright, cheeks flaming.

Vincent Macmillan intercepted Adrian in the hallway. "Thought you weren't coming today?"
"Just grabbing some files." Adrian stuffed his used shirt into his briefcase.
"Why are your ears red?"
"Broken AC." The lie came smoothly.

Vincent peeked toward the lounge. "Evelyn's not here?"
"Didn't see her." Adrian strode toward the elevator. "Probably at the library."

Only when the doors closed did he loosen his tie.
His palm still tingled where her hair had brushed against it.
###Chapter 310

Adrian Klein knew Vincent Macmillan wasn't the gossiping type, but accidents could happen.

Once words escaped, they'd snowball uncontrollably.

The best solution was to end it here.

"What's your plan for this afternoon?" Vincent asked.

"Lab work."

"You're always so busy..."

Adrian grabbed his coat. "I'm heading out."

"Wait, what did you come back for?" Vincent pressed.

"Curiosity isn't always a virtue."

"..."

After Adrian left, Evelyn Langley took a short nap.

She needed to stay sharp for the afternoon's data analysis.

At exactly 2 PM, she woke up, splashed cold water on her face, and returned to her workstation.

Natalie Blanchet and other colleagues gradually trickled back.

"Evelyn, your face is so red. Heatstroke?" Natalie asked.

Evelyn touched her cheek instinctively. "Is it? Maybe it's the heat..."

Vincent chimed in, "The break room has AC."

"I forgot to turn it on today..."

"No wonder. Professor Klein looked flushed earlier too. Both of you heat-sensitive?"

Natalie giggled. "That dramatic? Evelyn, you're turning redder. Oliver, lower the AC..."

Evelyn: "..."

She secretly checked her reflection on her phone.

Completely normal!

......

Evening came as experiments concluded.

Evelyn left work on time, stopping by the supermarket.

The farmer's market had closed, leaving supermarkets the only option.

She carefully selected ingredients and prepared two dishes with soup at home.

Propping up her phone, she video-called William Langley while eating.

"Dad, still fussing over your flowers this late? Doesn't Mom mind?"

"She's racing against deadline. No time for me."

"Creative surge lately?" Evelyn raised an eyebrow.

"Peace with her editor means good mood; good mood means inspiration flows."

William suddenly lowered his voice. "Speaking of that editor—Penelope Ashcroft—no calls recently. Odd how she suddenly went quiet."

"Guess what?"

Evelyn played along. "What happened?"

"Found out she blocked all of Penelope's contacts!"

With their recent move, the editor couldn't track them down.

Evelyn chuckled. "That's so Mom."

At nearly fifty, Victoria Langley retained childlike whimsy under William's devotion.

Like when critics panned her work years ago, she rage-quit online—pure teenage tantrum.

"Dad," Evelyn turned serious, "keep an eye on Mom. No contact with Penelope."

Julian Roscente's referred editor had connected.

After reviewing Victoria's manuscript, Simon Croix called at 3 AM.

Evelyn answered half-asleep.

The "golden editor" of thriller novels—every title under him became bestsellers, every adaptation blockbusters.

He cared only for quality, not names.

After understanding Victoria's situation, he'd said just one thing...
###Chapter 311

"Your mother has been held back for far too long."

Simon Croix's words cut through Evelyn Langley's heart like a dull blade.

Her fingers turned cold as she stared at her phone screen.

Simon requested a direct meeting with Victoria Langley.

"Mother is in the neighboring city," Evelyn explained softly. "And her contract with Penelope Ashcroft hasn't expired yet..."

She didn't want her mother to learn about this prematurely.

Creative work required undisturbed focus.

"Contract?" Simon seized the keyword. "Send it to me."

Evelyn forwarded the digital copy.

"No rush." Simon's voice remained steady. "Let me review the contract first. Your mother—I'm signing her!"

The declaration made Evelyn freeze.

Simon only signed works, never authors.

Had she misheard?

Shaking her head, she dismissed the thought.

On the video call, William Langley set down his teacup.

"Evelyn, what's wrong?"

"Nothing serious." She forced a smile. "Please don't tell Mom yet."

"Alright."

After hanging up, night had deepened.

Evelyn cleared the dishes and took out the trash.

The early summer breeze carried damp warmth as streetlights stretched her shadow long.

The recent stalking incident still haunted her.

She turned back home before walking far.

Water rushed in the shower.

Drying her hair, Evelyn settled at her desk and opened her thesis.

Her phone vibrated.

Ethan Winston: Busy?

She stared at the screen for seconds.

Evelyn: What is it?

Ethan: Miss you.

The two words made her heart skip.

Before she could reply, another message appeared:

Can I call?

Evelyn inhaled deeply: Sure.

The call connected instantly.

"They caught the stalker," Ethan's voice came through. "Solid evidence."

"How?"

"If I want someone found, they will be."

His tone bordered on arrogance.

But Evelyn knew he had the means.

"Don't go out alone at night." He paused. "I worry."

"Mm."

"That's it?" Ethan sounded displeased. "Not even a thank you?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together: "...Thank you."

"How insincere."

"What do you want then?"

A low chuckle traveled through the phone: "Tell you tomorrow in person."

"I have experiments tomorrow—"

"Surely you have fifteen minutes for lunch?"

"So urgent?"

"Too short?" Amusement laced his voice. "Want half a day instead?"

"...Fifteen minutes is fine."

"See you then."

Ending the call, Evelyn turned off her desk lamp.

In the darkness, she exhaled softly.
###Chapter 312

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Langley stood in the kitchen, already busy.

She deftly fried eggs and packed two bento boxes before rushing out the door.

The glass door of the lab slid open quietly under her touch. The wall clock read 7:30 AM.

The floor was silent except for the echo of her footsteps in the hallway.

The lounge door suddenly swung open.

Adrian Klein emerged holding a coffee cup, catching them both off guard. His fingers tightened around the mug as yesterday's abrupt departure flashed through his mind.

The tips of Evelyn's ears turned pink. She pretended to adjust her collar, masking the rapid heartbeat triggered by that unexpected memory.

"Morning." Adrian's voice was deeper than usual.

"Good morning, Professor." She kept her head down, hurrying toward the lab bench—forgetting even to store the bento in the breakroom fridge.

Adrian reached out. "I'll take it."

"Thanks," she mumbled without looking up, nearly fumbling the test tube in her hand.

At noon, Evelyn stepped out of Diligence Hall to find Ethan Winston leaning against a ginkgo tree.

His navy-blue shirt sleeves were casually rolled up, exuding effortless charm.

"Waiting long?"

Ethan waved a file folder. "Just enjoying the sun."

"What's Professor Hill up to now?"

He sighed. "The old man made me draft final exam papers—answer keys included. Then he insisted you double-check them."

Evelyn arched a brow. "How convenient for him."

"Exactly." Ethan shrugged. "I almost refused, but then I thought..."

"Hmm?"

"It's a perfect excuse to see you."

Evelyn nearly choked. She hastily opened the folder. "I'll review these right away."

Ethan pointed to a nearby pavilion. "Let's sit there. The sun's too harsh."

"Afraid of a tan?"

"Afraid you'll burn." He naturally took her bag. "Come on."

Evelyn focused on the documents but kept glancing up. The glare made her squint, her lashes casting delicate shadows.

Ethan shifted subtly, blocking the sunlight with his body.

Returning from the cafeteria, Adrian spotted the pair in the pavilion. Ethan was bent over a page, his frame nearly enveloping Evelyn's.
###Chapter 313

Evelyn Langley and Ethan Winston sat on the stone bench in the pavilion, speaking in hushed tones.

Their shoulders nearly touched.

The girl frowned slightly, her expression focused. The man leaned in, nodding occasionally in agreement.

Adrian Klein stood at a distance, his gaze fixed on the faint curve of Ethan's lips. Even from afar, he could sense the unmistakable mating signal.

His eyes darkened.

Pulling out his phone, he dialed Vincent Macmillan.

"Hey, Adrian?"

"Want bubble tea?"

"Huh?" Vincent pulled the phone away to check the caller ID. "You sick or something?"

"My treat. Ask the others."

Vincent immediately raised his voice. "Professor Klein's buying bubble tea! Hands up if you don't want any. Great, everyone's in."

"I'll go get it."

"Why not just order delivery?"

"Passing by," Adrian said flatly. "What flavors?"

"Which shop?"

Adrian named the place.

Vincent rattled off: "I'll take Oreo milk tea with fresh milk base, taro balls, less sugar, no ice, extra foam. Natalie wants—"

"Too complicated." Adrian cut him off. "Can't remember."

Vincent: "???"

The same Adrian Klein who could recall complex experimental data at a glance now claimed he couldn't remember a few drink orders?

"Text Evelyn," Adrian said calmly. "Ran into her. We'll go together."

"Got it! Sending now!"

After hanging up, Vincent typed rapidly.

"Done!"

He added a voice message: "Thanks, sweetie~"

Suddenly, his fingers froze—

Wait!

Why not just text Adrian directly?

......

"Evelyn."

Both heads in the pavilion turned.

"Professor Klein?"

"Passing by." Adrian's gaze swept over them.

Ethan stood, extending a hand. "Professor Klein."

"Mr. Winston." A brief handshake.

Their eyes locked, undercurrents swirling.

"Business at the university?"

"Helping a professor with something."

Evelyn's phone buzzed. Reading the message, she looked up in surprise. "You're treating us to bubble tea?"

"Mn. That place you recommended last time was good."

Evelyn nodded. "Give me five minutes."

"Alright."

Ethan's smile stiffened. At the mention of the shop name, his eyes darkened.

"Professor Klein drinks bubble tea?"

"First time was Evelyn's treat."

"What temperature?"

"Room temp." Adrian's lips curved slightly.

"Special packaging?"

"Cup had hearts and arrows." Adrian feigned nonchalance. "Didn't know bubble tea shops offered such... thoughtful service."
###Chapter 314

That bubble tea packaging was all too familiar to him.

"I've finished checking." Evelyn Langley handed him the revised answer key. "There were three details that needed additions. I've noted them in the margins."

Ethan Winston took the paper, his fingertips trembling slightly.

"I should get going now."

He forced a smile. "Alright. See you next time."

"Let's go, Professor. That bubble tea shop is right across from our apartment complex."

She had mentioned this shop during their last meeting.

......

"The bubble tea's here!"

Vincent Macmillan, Natalie Blanchet, and Oliver Lancelot immediately gathered around.

"Thanks, Professor! Appreciate it, Evelyn!"

"Sorry for making you run this errand!"

Vincent eagerly stabbed his straw into the cup. "So refreshing!"

Natalie raised an eyebrow. "Is it really that good?"

Oliver accepted two cups and thanked Adrian Klein and Evelyn.

He eagerly offered one to Camille Valrose.

"Here you go, Camille."

"Hmm."

Upon learning Adrian and Evelyn had gone together to buy the drinks, Camille instantly lost her appetite.

Oliver kept chattering beside her:

"Camille, why aren't you drinking?"

"The cream topping will melt if you wait too long."

"Let me put the straw in for you."

Camille suddenly slammed the table and stood up. "Would you shut up? You're driving me crazy!"

She stormed off.

Oliver stood frozen, staring at the untouched drink. "...But this was what you wanted."

Why refuse it after they'd bought it?

He would never understand.

This wasn't about education or values.

It was the unbridgeable gap created by their completely different upbringings.

Camille only accepted it because Adrian had paid for the drinks.

She stepped into the hallway for fresh air.

Her phone rang.

"Hello."

"Hey classmate, I found that apartment you wanted!"

"Really?" Camille's eyes lit up.

"It wasn't easy... The landlord initially refused, but they needed money urgently. Though the price—"

"Price doesn't matter. Which unit?"

"Unit 3, first floor."

Adrian lived in Unit 1, seventh floor...

Too far away.

The light in Camille's eyes instantly dimmed. "No other units available?"

"...Rentals are scarce in this complex. Which floor do you actually want?"

"Unit 1. Fifth floor or above. Preferably sixth."

She didn't dare hope for the seventh.

Her realtor classmate scoffed. "Sure, I'll look." As if!

After hanging up, a voice suddenly spoke behind her:

"Camille, you're moving?"

She froze.

Turning, she saw Oliver standing there holding her bubble tea.

How much had he overheard...?
###Chapter 315

"Camille?" Oliver's voice came through again.

Camille's finger paused on her phone screen.

"What?"

"Were you looking at apartments just now?"

Her heart skipped a beat. She forced calm into her voice. "Why do you care? What does my housing situation have to do with you?"

A flicker of hurt crossed Oliver's eyes before he masked it. "I'm your boyfriend. Isn't it normal for me to be concerned?"

"I want a boyfriend, not a babysitter."

"Then...should I stop asking about your business?"

His tone held hesitation, afraid of provoking her again.

When Oliver didn't press further, the tension in Camille's shoulders eased slightly. Her voice softened.

"Give it here." She extended her hand.

"What?"

"That bubble tea in your hand. Isn't it for me?"

"Oh! I almost forgot..." A smile broke across Oliver's face.

......

The lab lights had stayed on for seven straight days.

Two sets of data were finally compiled.

Evelyn could finally breathe and take a day off.

"Miss Langley, if we don't meet soon, you'll forget about me."

A red Ferrari pulled up perfectly in front of her.

Sophia rested one arm on the window frame as she removed her sunglasses.

Her wavy hair danced in the wind, the black jumpsuit accentuating her effortless elegance.

Evelyn opened the passenger door. "How could I ever forget my queen?"

Sophia pinched Evelyn's dewy cheek. "Two weeks apart and your mouth got sweeter?"

"Naturally sweet."

"Alright, alright. Buckle up. I'm taking you somewhere delicious!"

"Yes, ma'am~"

"Mimi, if I were a man, I'd marry you in a heartbeat."

Then that scumbag Nathan wouldn't stand a chance.

Ugh!

Valley Spring, the newest viral Cantonese teahouse.

This twenty-year-old establishment recently exploded in popularity after a food blogger's recommendation.

Sophia had to pull strings to secure a reservation.

When their signature roasted squab arrived, its skin glistened golden and crisp.

Evelyn took a delicate bite. Juices burst across her tongue.

"Only true foodies knew about this place before. Now there's a perpetual line." Sophia sighed.

Her first visit had been with her father.

Knowing Evelyn had been overworked in the lab, she'd specifically chosen this light Cantonese restaurant.

"How is it?"

"Divine!" Evelyn's eyes sparkled.

Crispy outside, tender inside, with the perfect hint of smokiness.

She even started mentally dissecting the recipe.

She used to study cookbooks for Nathan's sake.

After the breakup, she realized cooking for herself and sharing meals with friends was its own joy.

No need to please anyone.

No need to perform.

Doing what you love—that's enough.
###Chapter 316

"Evelyn...thanks again for getting me home last time." Sophia Laurent rubbed her nose, cheeks tinged pink. "I heard I made quite a scene when drunk?"

Even the tips of her ears turned rosy at the memory of that embarrassing night.

"Blame my mom for forcing me to attend that elite cocktail party. It was clearly a disguised matchmaking event."

Those so-called promising young men were nothing more than commodities with price tags in her eyes.

Eleanor Roland was perfect in every way—except for being stubbornly opinionated.

She kept preaching about how only well-matched marriages brought happiness, how love would eventually lose to mundane realities...

Sophia felt her ears would grow calluses from hearing it.

After returning home, she confronted her mother directly. She'd agree to the "well-matched" condition—but only if she got to choose the candidate herself.

In exchange, Eleanor had to stop arranging any blind dates without permission.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You're choosing?"

"Exactly. As long as they're from acceptable families, Mom will agree." Sophia smirked slyly. "Easy enough—just pick someone from our circle!"

"You're seriously considering this?"

Evelyn looked surprised.

Sophia had a soft spot for obedient, puppy-like younger men. But among their circle's young masters...

Plenty were young enough, but willing to lower themselves to pamper her?

Nearly impossible.

These silver-spoon-fed heirs would never humble themselves to please others.

Sophia lowered her voice mysteriously. "Of course I'm picking—how else to deal with Mom? But not for romance. A business partner."

"Business partner?"

"Mhm. I'm not the only one getting pressured to marry in our circle." She winked. "Since none of us want arranged matches, why not cover for each other?"

"How would that work?"

"Put on an act in public, live separately in private."

It would silence their elders while letting them keep their freedom. Two birds with one stone.

Evelyn still advised caution.

Sophia waved it off. "Don't worry, I've got this."

When the bill came, Evelyn paid while Sophia was freshening up.

"I said it's my treat!" Sophia pouted in protest.

Evelyn smiled. "Can't let you pay every time. Money's no issue for me now."

"Oh right, you're practically a millionaire now."

She reached to pinch Evelyn's cheek.

"Stop—that hurts!" Evelyn dodged. "We're in public. Maintain some dignity."

Laughing, they headed for the exit.

"Professor Laurent, a moment please."

A voice made them both pause.

A group emerged from the second-floor private dining room—mostly middle-aged, a few silver-haired, all dressed in academic attire.

The young man at their center stood out strikingly.

Tall and poised, with refined features, he was a vivid contrast to the portly scholars around him.

"Professor Laurent, we'd appreciate your guidance on the new research topic."

"Our lab's equipment procurement..."

"The project proposal..."

They clamored around him.

Adrian Klein responded politely, though fatigue showed between his brows. Then his gaze swept across the lobby—and landed on the two young women.

His expression instantly brightened.

"My apologies, everyone. My sister is waiting. I must go."

Before they could react, he was already striding toward Evelyn and Sophia.
###Chapter 317

The trio emerged from the restaurant into the deep night.

"Adrian, you commanded more attention than a celebrity back there. Those professors orbiting you looked like starstruck fans at a meet-and-greet," Sophia teased.

"Celebrity?"

"You know, an idol."

Adrian Klein shook his head with an amused smile. "Just professional connections. Nothing idol-like about it."

Sophia suddenly leaned closer. "Have you been drinking? Where's your car?"

"A few glasses. Didn't drive."

"Perfect. I'll drop you and Evelyn home."

The car stopped at the alley's mouth, unable to proceed further.

Evelyn Langley and Adrian walked side by side into the shadowed lane.

Moonlight spilled like liquid silver. A gentle night breeze stirred.

Occasional feline cries punctuated the quiet alleyway.

Adrian stumbled slightly after stepping on a trash bag, the alcohol affecting his balance.

"Are you alright?"

"My apologies. Overindulged tonight."

He deliberately maintained distance, wary of his breath bothering her.

That "apology" carried unusual sincerity.

Something fluttered in Evelyn's chest.

Nathan Evans used to drink frequently too, yet never felt the need to apologize.

How different people could be.

She'd assumed all men were like Nathan, Dylan, or Julian—hedonistic pleasure-seekers.

Or like William Langley—content with mundane stability.

Until Adrian Klein—

A man who touched the clouds yet remained more grounded than anyone.

True excellence needed no fanfare. Success required no arrogance.

He could indulge, yet chose restraint.

"Do academics really need networking dinners?" Evelyn asked curiously.

"In a society built on connections, reciprocity is inevitable. Alcohol's just one medium—tea, calligraphy, poetry serve the same purpose."

"If we define such interactions as 'networking,' no profession escapes it. Only degrees vary."

"During holidays, don't children visit relatives? Isn't that networking?"

"But reframe it as normal socializing—tea gatherings, fishing trips, hiking, camping—the feeling shifts."

"Yet fundamentally, it remains networking."

Evelyn heard this perspective for the first time. "Was tonight networking then?"

Adrian's lips curved slightly. "Yes and no."

"How so?"

"The table held both mentors, dear friends, and strangers. Sharing drinks with the former is joy; enduring toasts from the latter is networking."

He turned, eyes glinting with amusement. "So... half and half."

Evelyn chuckled. "Such precise accounting. Happiness and unhappiness perfectly balanced."

"Exactly," he nodded. "I hope you can achieve that too."

Evelyn froze.

Achieve what?

Before she could ask, they'd reached her doorstep.

The conversation had carried them effortlessly home.

"Goodnight, Professor."
###Chapter 318 

Evelyn Langley tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep.

The man's deep voice still echoed in her ears.

His gaze had been steady as a deep pool, his tone leaving no room for doubt.

That powerful aura radiating from within made her yearn.

For the first time, she desired to become someone like that.

......

Sophia Laurent drove straight to the bar after dropping them off.

Her Ferrari cut a red arc through the night streets.

Just as she was backing into a parking space—

BAM!

A silver Maserati suddenly swerved from behind, slamming into her rear bumper.

"Fuck!" Sophia kicked open her car door.

Stomping in heels, she marched to the offending vehicle and banged on the window. "Are you fucking blind? Couldn't see this wide-ass road?"

The window rolled down to reveal Julian Roscente's smirking face. "Well, if it isn't Miss Laurent."

"How much have you had to drink?" Sophia sneered. "Can't even see parking spaces now?"

Julian stepped out to inspect the damage.

The Ferrari's rear was visibly dented.

"No big deal," he waved dismissively. "My fault. Insurance will cover it."

"Damn right it's your fault!" Sophia threw her keys at him. "I've got plans. You handle the mess."

As she turned to leave, a sharp slap froze her in place.

SMACK!

A woman in a business suit stood before Julian, eyes red-rimmed.

"You bastard!" Her voice trembled. "Breaking up just like that?"

Julian rubbed his cheek, smile intact. "Miss Si, let's part amicably."

"I refuse!" The woman suddenly clung to him. "I don't need commitment..."

Sophia stared, dumbfounded.

The woman's flawless makeup was ruined by tears as she desperately gripped Julian's collar.

"We can increase the settlement," Julian said coolly.

She shoved him away, eyes blazing with despair. "Julian Roscente, karma will get you!"

"Someday you'll meet someone who'll never be yours."

"Then you'll understand true agony!"

Wiping her tears, she fled into the night.

Julian straightened his rumpled collar and shrugged at Sophia. "My apologies for the scene."

Sophia scoffed and strode into the bar without looking back.
###Chapter 319

The clicking of high heels faded into the distance as the woman disappeared into the night.

Julian Roscente's lips curled into a mocking smirk.

The bitterness of love?

Pathetic.

He downed his drink in one gulp.

Just then, a girl in a JK skirt emerged from the bar. Her makeup was flawless, with curled hair cascading over her shoulders and long legs peeking beneath the short skirt.

"Mr. Roscente..."

The girl cooed as she approached, but Julian sidestepped her advance.

In one fluid motion, he pulled Sophia Laurent into his arms instead.

Sophia, who had been watching the scene unfold, gasped in surprise.

Julian raised an eyebrow at the girl. "Sorry, already taken."

The girl bit her lip, shot Sophia a venomous glare, and stormed off.

"Using me as a shield?" Sophia sneered. "Tired of having hands?"

Julian had intended to release her, but now he changed his mind.

"What if I don't let go?" he challenged.

Sophia's eyes narrowed. "Perfect."

Before Julian could react, she twisted his arm behind his back.

"Ow! That hurts!" he yelped.

"Still want to play games?"

"I surrender! Let go!"

With a disdainful hum, Sophia released the pressure—only to guide his hand back to her waist.

"Now you may remove it," she said calmly.

Julian barked out a laugh.

Was she seriously pulling this move?

It was like...

A parent teaching a child to get back up after falling.

Julian = the child.

Sophia = the parent!

Damn it!

This was outright humiliation!

Suddenly, an enraged man burst out of the bar.

"Sophia Laurent! You stood me up?" The man was practically foaming at the mouth. "I thought you'd been in a car crash, but here you are flirting?"

His gaze landed on Julian's hand resting on Sophia's waist. "Seems I worried for nothing. Deal's off!"

He turned on his heel and left.

Sophia slapped Julian's hand away. "Want a repeat performance?"

Julian hastily withdrew his arm.

Watching the man's retreating figure, Sophia tugged at her hair in frustration.

Her carefully chosen business partner—gone just like that.

"This is your fault! Who drives that badly?"

Julian stood there meekly, accepting the scolding.

Of all people to rear-end, it had to be this hellion.

"Was that Adrian Lefèvre from the Chen family?" he asked curiously. "What deal were you working on?"

Sophia rolled her eyes. "None of your damn business."
###Chapter 320

"I just want to make it up to you. Maybe there's something I can help with." Julian Roscente arched a confident brow. His resources far surpassed that Adrian Klein guy.

Sophia Laurent studied him with skeptical amusement.

"You really want to discuss business with me?"

"Obviously. What's that look for? Underestimating me?"

Her gaze swept over him again.

The Roscente family topped Boston's elite circles, leagues above the Kleins.

And this man didn't even retaliate when slapped—at least his surface manners were impeccable.

Sure, his playboy reputation preceded him, but she wasn't looking for a husband.

Most importantly, he had a clean break policy with exes—no messy attachments.

The more Sophia considered it, the more pleased she became.

"Fine. Shall we talk inside?"

Julian scoffed. "Who's afraid?"

A crimson smile curved her lips.

"What are you waiting for? Let's go." She tugged his tie.

"Cough!" He stumbled.

Since when did women get so rough?

......

Margaret Evans only moped for two days after losing her grandchild.

Not having to cater to that Chloe Valentine wretch actually felt liberating.

She resumed her leisurely high-society life effortlessly.

That afternoon, the ladies gathered for tea.

Amid premium floral blends and delicate pastries, Margaret perched elegantly on a leather sofa in her latest designer ensemble.

"Mrs. Evans, you seem tired lately? Family troubles?"

Mrs. Cardenas smiled sweetly, dimples flashing.

Margaret's grin stiffened momentarily before brightening.

"Probably the summer heat affecting my sleep."

"Really?" Mrs. Cardenas arched a knowing brow.

Everyone knew about her scandal—a pregnant daughter-in-law hospitalized after miscarriage, while she couldn't be bothered to visit.

"Skin can be treated, but a rotten heart? That's incurable."

The barb wasn't lost on Margaret, yet she dared not retort.

"It's stuffy here. I need air." She rose gracefully.

The moment she left, whispers erupted.

"Pathetic act."

"Of course she can't sleep after causing a miscarriage."

"Serves her right! Who treats a girl like that?"

Margaret reached the lobby, about to summon a server, when raised voices caught her attention.

"No appointment, no entry!"

"Screw appointments! I'm here for someone—move!"
###Chapter 321

"Security! Stop those lunatics—"

Linda Lombardi's shrill voice pierced the air.

"Where's Margaret Evans? That bitch needs to face me!"

Two days ago, Linda had arrived in the city with her son Tyler Lombardi.
They'd gone straight to Massachusetts General Hospital.
After seeing Chloe Valentine's weakened state on the hospital bed...
They decided to stay.

"Why waste money on hotels? This VIP ward is spacious and comfortable!" Linda declared.

A nurse timidly reminded, "But there's only one patient bed..."

"What's wrong with a mother and son sharing? We do it all the time at home!"

Tyler picked his teeth and added, "Yeah, and we save on electricity with one AC."

The hospital didn't object.
VIP wards allowed family members to stay. The fees would be deducted from the account automatically.
Chloe could stay as long as needed—one extra bed made no difference.

After two days, Linda had even grown accustomed to the antiseptic smell.
But there'd been no sign of the father-to-be.

"Think hiding will make this go away? Dream on!"

"Mom, what's our move?" Tyler cracked his knuckles.

"If they won't come to us, we'll go to them!"

That morning, Chloe spotted Margaret's social media post.
The photo showed an upscale hotel private dining room.
She immediately sent the address to her mother.
Mother and son stormed over without hesitation.

Margaret was observing the commotion at the front desk from a distance.
Hearing her name, she thought she'd misheard.
Until the second shriek came.
Her stomach dropped.

Seeing the front desk staff struggling to contain the hysterical woman, Margaret turned to retreat.

Just then, a server approached with a tray. "Your lemon water, Mrs. Evans."
When she didn't respond, he repeated louder, "Mrs. Evans?"

"Evans?" Linda's ears perked up.
Wasn't that the surname of the man who'd knocked up her daughter?

Her eyes gleamed as she suddenly shouted, "Nathan Evans!"

Margaret instinctively turned.

"Got you!" Linda lunged, yanking Margaret's hair.
"Trying to run? My daughter's half-dead in the hospital while you're living it up?"

Before Margaret could react, Linda spat a thick glob of phlegm onto her expensive silk dress.
###Chapter 322

"My daughter is hospitalized after a miscarriage, and the Evans family can't even show their faces? Have you no conscience?"

"Back when my daughter was pregnant, you couldn't wait to fawn over her. Now that the baby's gone, you're turning your backs? Is this how the Evans family treats people?"

The shrill voice pierced through the hallway, drawing curious glances from the wealthy ladies in the private dining room.

Margaret Evans' elegant updo had come undone as a middle-aged woman gripped her collar, screaming obscenities.

The socialites exchanged knowing looks.

Linda Lombardi raised her voice louder as the crowd grew. "Everyone, hear this! The Evans heir played with my daughter's feelings and abandoned her after getting her pregnant!"

"My innocent girl's life is ruined! We demand justice today!"

She rolled up her sleeves, ready for a fight.

"Film this and post it online! Let the whole country see the Evans family's true colors! This is what Margaret Evans raised!"

Tyler Lombardi blocked the approaching staff and aimed his phone at Margaret.

"Serves you right! How dare you bully my sister!"

Margaret shielded her face in humiliation, struggling to break free from Linda's grasp.

"Stop recording! Your daughter has no self-respect—why blame my son?"

"I've been more than generous! She caused her own miscarriage! Keep this up and I'll call the police!"

Linda sneered. "Go ahead! Let the police settle this!"

"We country folk aren't afraid of shame. But I wonder if the prestigious Evans family can afford the scandal?"

Margaret paled instantly.

The words struck her weakest point.

"You're not leaving without an answer today! Tyler, block her!"

"How dare you—"

Tyler advanced with a vicious grin. "Try me."

"Get away! Don't touch me!" Margaret shrieked.

At the critical moment, her driver burst in with security, escorting her to the car.

Tyler stomped in frustration. "Mom, she got away!"

Linda narrowed her eyes. "She can't run forever. Let's return to the hospital."

"That place reeks. Can't we go somewhere else?" Tyler wrinkled his nose at his sleeve.

"Once we get the compensation, you can stay wherever you want!"

Tyler grinned. "My sister sure has good taste..."

That woman had been decked in designer brands—her family was clearly loaded.

......

Nathan Evans had spent the past week in the south handling a corporate crisis without a single appearance.

He took work calls but set his personal phone to Do Not Disturb.

Only when documents piled up, requiring his signature, did he finally return.

The moment his plane landed and he disabled airplane mode, Margaret's call came through within two minutes.

"Hello, Mom..."
###Chapter 323

"Where the hell are you?! Ignoring my calls and texts for days—have you abandoned your own mother too?!" Margaret Evans' hysterical shriek pierced through the phone.

Nathan Evans glanced at his phone impassively. "Business trip. Busy."

"Get your ass home now! If you're not back today, don't ever step foot in this house again!"

The line went dead.

Nathan's brow furrowed as he grabbed his coat and headed to the family estate.

The sound of shattering porcelain greeted him in the foyer.

"Mother."

Margaret whirled around, her perfectly made-up face contorted with rage. "So you remember you have a mother?!"

She stormed forward in stilettos. "Look at the trash you've been dating! That bitch Chloe Valentine was bad enough, but her mother's a complete lunatic! She spat in my face today—in front of everyone!"

Nathan's eyes turned glacial.

"I warned you about Chloe! But no, you had to keep seeing her. Now she's had a miscarriage and blames us—"

"Miscarriage?" Nathan interrupted sharply.

Margaret gaped. "You didn't know?"

Nathan stood frozen, fingers trembling slightly.

Then his lips curled into a cold smile. "Good."

That child should never have existed.

Margaret took a shuddering breath. "Her mother crashed my luncheon today. The whole social circle knows now. If your father finds out—"

At the mention of Vincent Evans, her voice shook.

"Clean up your own mess!"

She scrubbed furiously at her arms as if still smelling the assault.

——

Meanwhile, Evelyn Langley curled on her sofa reviewing lab data.

The fluorescent lights softened her profile.

Her phone buzzed.

"Evelyn! I found it!" Sophia Laurent's excited voice chirped through the receiver.

Evelyn blinked. "Found what?"

"You know...that thing we discussed last time..." Sophia dropped to a whisper. "The fake boyfriend."

Evelyn choked on air. "Who?"

"You should probab—"

The call cut off abruptly.

Sophia glared at her screen flashing "Julian the Asshole" before answering. "What now?!"

Outside the alley, Julian Roscente crushed his cigarette beside a Maserati. "What took so long? I've waited thirty minutes!"

Sophia smirked. "That how you ask for favors?"

Julian gritted his teeth.

Remembering her black belt in taekwondo, he forced a grin. "Please, Soph. Desperate times."

With a huff, Sophia yanked the car door open.

"One time only."
###Chapter 324

"Cut to the chase." Sophia Laurent's gaze swept over his sports car. "Got a cigarette?"

"You smoke now?"

"One won't kill me."

Julian Roscente hesitated before retrieving a cigarette case and lighter from his car.

Sophia didn't reach for them, crossing her arms with an amused smirk.

"Fine," Julian sighed in resignation. "I'm not dating a girlfriend—I'm worshipping a living goddess."

He leaned in to light her cigarette.

The flame illuminated her delicate profile.

This marked Julian's first time lighting a woman's cigarette.

Also the first time he realized smoking could look so damn elegant.

"Spit it out." Sophia exhaled a wisp of smoke that veiled her striking eyes.

Julian raked fingers through his hair. "My mother somehow found out about us. Demands I bring you home."

"Our deal was mutual cover, no strings attached."

"Remember." Sophia tapped ash from her cigarette.

"Time to return the favor."

"Sure." Her response came crisp. "Meeting the parents? Consider it handled."

"Seriously?" Julian narrowed skeptical eyes.

"One condition."

"Knew it! What?"

"Let me borrow this car for two days." Her fingertips traced the hood's curve.

Julian's heart lurched. "Easy there!"

"Deal or not?"

"Fine!" He tossed the keys through gritted teeth. "Two days max!"

Sophia caught them midair. "Text me the details. What's your mom's ideal daughter-in-law?"

"Necessary?"

"Obviously." She arched a brow. "I'm a professional."

The cigarette butt spun between her fingers before landing perfectly in the trash.

Julian blinked.

"Come here." She crooked a finger.

"Why?" His feet moved despite the protest.

"Hand on my shoulder."

"Really?" His palm already rested there.

Sophia's eyelid twitched. "What do you call me?"

"Sophia?"

"Wrong."

"Darling?"

"Disgusting."

"How about...tigress?"

"Julian!"

"Vivi—"

"Better."

Julian froze. "Wait—that wasn't me."

They turned in unison.

Evelyn Langley stood at the alley's mouth, her handbag hitting the pavement with a thud.
###Chapter 325

Sophia Laurent violently shook off the hand resting on her shoulder, cigarette ash fluttering from her fingertips.

Evelyn Langley nearly dropped her purse.
Her eyes widened as she watched her best friend arm-in-arm with a man.
That silhouette was painfully familiar.

The air froze when they turned around.
Julian Roscente?!
Evelyn's mind went blank.
So this was the "business partner" Sophia kept mentioning?

"You forgot your bag." Evelyn handed over the purse, her fingers icy.
Sophia grinned as she took it. "Thanks, sweetie!"
She nudged Evelyn toward the apartment complex. "Go on up. I'll wait until you're inside."

Evelyn nodded.
The night breeze lifted strands of her hair.
She knew Sophia too well—carefree on the surface, calculating underneath.

From her balcony, Evelyn waved.
The streetlamp stretched Sophia's shadow long across the pavement.

"Where's my car?" Julian demanded, catching up.
Sophia already had the engine roaring. "Not going your way."
Leaning out the window, she called, "I'll reimburse your cab fare."

The Maserati shot forward like an arrow.
Julian's furious shout dissolved in the exhaust fumes. "That's my brand-new car!"

Next afternoon.
Wall Street's glass facades reflected a speeding red convertible.
A chestnut-haired boy lounged in the passenger seat.

Julian's coffee cup creaked under his grip.
He stared at the retreating taillights.
A vein throbbed at his temple.

......

The last day of July.
Evelyn sealed three thesis copies into an express envelope.
Adrian Klein had verified her data for the sixth time.

The printer spat out its final page.
At last, she could sleep in.

Morning light flooded the bustling farmer's market.
Evelyn leisurely selected tomatoes.
Her phone screen lit up—a video call from her father.

"Professor Klein arranged that lab just for you?"
William Langley's voice crackled through the speaker.
Evelyn wiped damp hands on her jeans. "Yes."

Only later did she realize—
That was a lab others couldn't access with money.
Adrian had made an exception.

She encountered him during her morning jog.
The physicist had already run five kilometers.
Spotting her, he turned back. "I'll do another two with you."

Sunlight dappled through sycamore leaves.
Their shadows moved in tandem.
Evelyn's breathing gradually steadied.
###Chapter 326

"Will this affect your research schedule?"

"Professor Macmillan is handling the new project. I've had more free time lately."

"Professor Macmillan might complain," Evelyn teased with a playful smile.

"He can complain all he wants—he still has to work."

His response was blunt.

If Vincent Macmillan had been present, he would've been fuming.

After two laps around the park, Evelyn began to lag behind.

Adrian slowed his pace. "Adjust your breathing. Follow my rhythm... Inhale, exhale..."

Evelyn matched his instructions and quickly regained her stride. "Much better!"

"Want to keep going?"

"Let's call it a day."

"Alright."

Seizing the rare opportunity, they shared breakfast before heading back.

"Any updates on your paper?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Not yet."

"International journals have long review cycles. That's normal."

Mentioning the paper, Evelyn spoke earnestly. "Thanks to you lending me the lab, I could finish those three papers. Charging rent would feel too formal, but I still want to show my gratitude."

"How about I treat you to dinner?"

Adrian agreed without hesitation. "Sounds perfect. A free meal is always welcome."

"What would you like? I can—"

"Your cooking is excellent."

Evelyn blinked. "???"

When had she offered to cook?

But Adrian had already taken it as a given.

Fine...

Though she rarely cooked in the summer heat, if Adrian wanted it—

"How about lunch today? Are you free?"

"I am."

As they walked and chatted, Evelyn suddenly stopped at the alley entrance.

Adrian paused beside her. "What's wrong?"

Following her gaze, he saw Nathan Evans standing under the apartment awning, his dark eyes fixed on them.

Clad in a black dress shirt and tailored slacks, the man stood in the dappled shade, fractured by sunlight.

"Evelyn..." Nathan stepped forward, his gaze burning into her.

Post-run, Evelyn's forehead glistened with a light sheen, but her eyes were bright.

Her cheeks were flushed, radiating vitality.

He deliberately ignored Adrian—not that he hadn't noticed, but he refused to acknowledge him.

"Can I help you, Mr. Evans?"

The formal address stung.

"Do we really have to be this distant?"

Evelyn met his gaze calmly. "We're not close."

"Can't we even be friends?"

"Unnecessary."

In her view, an ex should vanish without a trace.

Staying friends was just an excuse for unresolved feelings.

And she wanted no part of it.
###Chapter 327

Those nights of heart-wrenching agony were now distant memories.

Evelyn Langley stood in the sunlight, realizing how long it had been since she last thought of that person.

The wound she once believed would never heal had faded into a faint scar.

"Yes?" she asked calmly.

"Can we talk privately?"

"Unnecessary." Evelyn turned to leave.

"Mianmian—"

"Mr. Evans, please use my full name."

Nathan Evans' expression stiffened.

He shot a glance at Adrian Klein standing nearby, silently urging him to leave.

The physicist remained motionless, ignoring the unspoken request.

Nathan clenched his fists.

Evelyn instinctively took half a step back.

"We should go," she said to Adrian.

The man gave a slight nod.

"'We'? Then what am I?" Nathan's eyes darkened with barely restrained fury.

He took a deep breath, forcing down the storm of emotions.

"I came to say," he locked eyes with Evelyn, "I don't accept your 'congratulations' from that day."

Evelyn frowned.

"Unless you forgive me, I'll never have children in this lifetime." Nathan enunciated each word. "Because the only woman who can bear my children is you."

The air froze.

Both Evelyn and Adrian fell silent.

"You should see a doctor," Evelyn finally said.

"What?"

"A psychiatrist." She tugged Adrian's sleeve. "Let's go."

Only after entering the elevator did she exhale deeply.

"Sorry you had to witness that, Professor."

Adrian contemplated for a moment. "You've... been through a lot."

"..."

Returning home, Evelyn took a long hot shower.

After confirming no one lurked outside her window, she grabbed a shopping bag and headed out.

"Professor?" She froze at the alley entrance.

Adrian had changed into casual wear, his damp hair still dripping.

"Grocery shopping? I'll join you."

Understanding dawned—he was worried Nathan might reappear.

"Thank you."

Adrian smiled. "Shall we?"

Sunlight danced across their shoulders as they walked.

The 10 AM farmers' market buzzed with lively chatter.
###Chapter 328

The perch had already been cleaned by the shop, but Evelyn Langley still wasn't satisfied. She held the fish under running water, rinsing it thoroughly, even scrubbing away the bloodstains from its gills.

Her fingers pinched a small knife as she meticulously scraped away any remaining blood from between the bones. Her movements were gentle, as if handling a delicate piece of art.

The fish soaked in a mixture of scallion-ginger water and white vinegar to remove any fishy odor while keeping the flesh tender. The prawns had their antennae trimmed, their backs slit, and veins removed before being neatly arranged on a plate, ready for cooking.

Adrian Klein rolled up his shirt sleeves, revealing toned forearms. He stood by the sink washing vegetables, the water cascading over vibrant green leaves and splashing onto his wrists.

"Since when do guests do the work?" Evelyn shook her head with a smile.

"A willing guest," he replied without looking up. With swift, precise cuts, the carrot transformed into uniform matchsticks.

The kitchen filled with the subtle aroma of scallions and ginger. Evelyn lifted the perch from its bath and patted it dry with a paper towel. She dipped her fingers in cooking oil and lightly coated the fish.

Adrian stood nearby, his gaze lingering on her slender fingers. "Need any help?"

"Could you grab the steaming rack for me?"

The rack hung in the cabinet above Evelyn. As Adrian stepped closer, she caught the faint scent of cedar from him.

When he reached up, his chest nearly brushed against her back. She could feel the warmth radiating from him, and the tips of her ears turned pink.

"Here." As he handed her the rack, their fingers accidentally touched.

Adrian's hand hesitated for a fraction of a second.

"I'll take it from here," Evelyn said, her voice softer than usual as she accepted the rack.

The kitchen suddenly felt more spacious. She exhaled slowly, realizing even the air had cooled.

Twenty minutes later, the fragrance of steamed perch filled the house. Adrian had already set the table, even arranging the placemats with precision.

"There's still the soup," he said, turning toward the kitchen, his posture straight as a pine tree.

Evelyn opened the fridge, where two cans of beer sat untouched. As she reached for them, she met Adrian's questioning look.

"Bought them when friends visited," she explained instinctively, then immediately wondered why she felt the need to justify it.

Amusement flickered in Adrian's eyes. "I have an experiment this afternoon. No drinking for me."

"Then I—"

"You're not drinking either." His tone left no room for argument.

Evelyn obediently returned the beer, like a child caught misbehaving.

At the table, she suddenly stood, cradling a bowl of soup in both hands. "Professor, thank you for lending me your lab. Without your help, I might still be stuck."

The bowl glowed warmly under the light.

"That was your own effort," Adrian said, watching her. "I just provided the space."

But Evelyn knew it was far more than just "space." His lab housed confidential materials, yet he'd given her unrestricted access. That trust was more valuable than any assistance.
###Chapter 329

"Relax." Adrian Klein chuckled at Evelyn Langley's rigid posture.

She finally loosened up and sat across from him.

"Your cooking suits my taste perfectly." Adrian lifted his soup bowl, gently tapping it against hers. "This is the best thank-you gift."

He picked up a golden-brown fried chicken wing—crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside.

"You won't find such authentic flavors elsewhere."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Then the rest is all yours?"

Adrian's eyes curved slightly. "The honor is mine."

By the time they finished lunch, it was already 2 p.m.

After cleaning the kitchen, they left together.

Adrian headed to the lab while Evelyn went to the library—conveniently on the same route.

At the fork in the road, Evelyn instinctively followed Adrian left.

Suddenly realizing she no longer needed to go to the lab, her ears burned as she hastily turned and hurried toward the library.

......

The next day, Evelyn brought homemade pastries to the lab.

"Wow!" Natalie Blanchet gasped at the exquisitely shaped cakes in the box. "You made all these?"

"This Hello Kitty is adorable!"

"And a Transformer too!"

Oliver Lancelot immediately spotted the Stitch-themed cake. "Can I have this one?"

"Go ahead." Evelyn nodded with a smile.

Natalie teased with a wink. "For Camille?"

Oliver scratched his head sheepishly.

Vincent Macmillan couldn't wait to take a bite. "Perfect sweetness—not cloying at all."

Evelyn said softly, "My thesis is done. I might not come to the lab often anymore."

Natalie had expected this, just not so soon.

"Don't make it sound so final. We can still meet for meals."

Vincent sighed regretfully. "I'll miss having a mental math partner."

Oliver added, "You're always welcome back."

Camille Valrose glanced at the Stitch cake on the table, secretly relieved.

Finally leaving...

That evening, Adrian treated everyone to dinner.

They chose a Michelin five-star Chinese courtyard restaurant.

Evelyn wore a lavender dress with her hair in a bun and strappy sandals.

The pebbled pathway at the entrance made her tread carefully, but she still slipped—falling backward.
###Chapter 330

Adrian Klein swiftly steadied Evelyn Langley by the small of her back. The warmth from his palm radiated comforting heat.

Evelyn staggered slightly but quickly regained her balance.

"Careful," he murmured, withdrawing his hand.

She smoothed her skirt. "Thank you."

Vincent Macmillan immediately sidled up. "Need an arm to lean on, Evelyn? I'm much steadier than the floor."

Camille Valrose's nails dug into her palms as she glared at Evelyn's waistline.

Across the dining table, Oliver Lancelot watched Camille's untouched plate with concern. "The steamed perch is quite fresh today. Would you like to try some?"

"Shut up!"

Camille violently shoved away the chopsticks he offered.

"Whether I eat or not is none of your business!"

Oliver froze, utensils suspended midair.

The others continued eating in silence, accustomed to such scenes.

Adrian gave Oliver a fleeting glance before looking away.

Evelyn savored the foie gras with closed eyes.

Truly worthy of a Michelin three-star chef.

......

That weekend afternoon, Evelyn received a call from her father.

"Sweetheart! Incredible news!"

William Langley's voice vibrated with barely contained excitement.

"Our old house is being demolished for redevelopment!"

Evelyn gasped on cue. "Really?"

"The commercial land compensation is estimated at 1.5 million! Thank goodness we didn't listen to that agent who pressured us to sell."

Evelyn remembered something. "What about Brenda Murphy's family?"

William chuckled darkly. "She's miserable! Sold her place dirt cheap last month—right before the demolition announcement."

"The kicker? The buyer was that same agent!"

"Now she's protesting outside the neighborhood daily, threatening fraud lawsuits."

Evelyn shook her head gently.

Some people inevitably reap what they sow.
###Chapter 331

Brenda had never suffered such a humiliating defeat in her life.

She stormed into the real estate agency, slamming the glass door with enough force to rattle the windows.

"Bring out that little bastard Zhang right now!"

The manager adjusted his glasses calmly. "Mr. Zhang resigned last week."

Refusing to believe it, Brenda returned the next day with a mob of relatives. They blocked the entrance with protest banners, drawing crowds from the entire street.

Harassed beyond endurance, the manager finally surrendered Zhang's home address.

Brenda led her troops to Zhang's residence, only to find him more ruthless than she was.

"The contract's signed in black and white. The deed's transferred. No amount of screaming will change that."

Zhang leaned against the doorframe, cigarette dangling from his lips, the picture of shamelessness.

Brenda collapsed onto the ground, wailing like she had two decades ago when confronting school administrators.

But Zhang outdid her. He threw himself onto the floor, rolling around while shrieking, "Old hag bullying the youth!"

Police arrived to find them still hurling insults.

In the mediation room, the officer examined the contract three times.

"This property legally belongs to him now."

Brenda turned ghostly pale.

Zhang crossed his legs triumphantly. "Since when is buying property a crime? How was I supposed to know it'd be demolished?"

"Want to keep fighting? I've got all the time in the world—unemployed and free."

"But you... isn't your husband still teaching? And your son just became a civil servant, right?"

Brenda trembled with rage.

For the first time, she realized her usual tactics meant nothing to outsiders.

......

In the Langley living room, William shook his head over his teacup.

"Word is she got hospitalized from the stress."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Oh, she called your mother the day before yesterday," William suddenly remembered.

"What?"

"Asked if we'd sell our old house. Offered four hundred thousand."

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud. "Does she think we're idiots?"

With demolition notices plastered everywhere, everyone knew the property was worth over a million.

"Maybe she assumed we're uninformed?" William shrugged.

"Ignore her," Evelyn said decisively.

"Your mother blocked her number." William chuckled. "Brenda called a dozen times—no answer."

Evelyn changed the subject. "Dad, you're on break now?"

"Got a week off. Why?"
###Chapter 332

"Mom, Dad, why don't you come visit me in Boston for a few days?" Evelyn Langley's cheerful voice carried through the phone.

William Langley felt his heart skip a beat.

He missed his daughter terribly. Besides, memories of his student days at Harvard still felt vivid, filling him with an inexplicable nostalgia for the city.

"But aren't you busy with your thesis? We don't want to disturb you."

"I already submitted it. I've got free time now."

"What about the weather—"

Victoria Langley cut off her husband's protest. "Don't listen to him. His eyes are practically sparkling."

William rubbed his nose. "I never said no."

Evelyn laughed. "Then it's settled! I'll book your tickets right away."

She ended the call and swiftly tapped on her phone.

......

The Langleys stared at their booking confirmation in surprise.

"Tomorrow?" William's eyes widened. "And business class? This girl..."

Victoria swatted his arm. "Isn't it sweet she wants to see us sooner? Business class is comfortable. Don't you remember how your back ached for three days after that last coach trip?"

"I just don't want her spending too much..."

"When your daughter shows such thoughtfulness, accept it happily." Victoria was already packing. "Comfort matters when traveling."

William raised his hands in surrender. "You're absolutely right, dear!"

Victoria carefully placed several new dresses in the suitcase, followed by neatly folded casual clothes.

Meanwhile, William crouched in their vegetable garden, distressed.

"These cucumbers are so crisp, and the tomatoes are perfectly ripe..." He wished he could transport the entire garden to Boston.

Victoria massaged her temples. "Are you going on vacation or running a farmers' market?"

"But they're all organic..."

"They'll rot during the trip." She decisively closed the suitcase. "Just bring two jars of homemade chili sauce."

William cast one last longing glance at the garden.

......

At the train station exit, Evelyn immediately spotted her parents.

"Mom!" She rushed forward.

Victoria recounted William's packing "adventures" from the previous night, sending both women into fits of laughter.

William trailed behind silently, carrying their luggage.

"My apartment's just ahead." Evelyn pointed as they walked. "It's an older building, but the location's perfect."

They climbed seven flights of stairs without noticing the effort, chatting and laughing all the way.

Evelyn pulled out her keys.

The door across the hall suddenly opened.

Adrian Klein stepped out with an armful of laundry, freezing when he found himself facing three pairs of staring eyes.

The air turned to ice.
###Chapter 333

Adrian Klein immediately recognized the middle-aged couple.

He strode forward with a warm smile. "Hello, I'm Adrian Klein. I live next door to Evelyn."

Evelyn Langley snapped out of her daze and quickly made introductions.

"Mom, Dad, this is Professor Klein who lent me his lab."

William Langley studied the young man with surprise. "I didn't expect the professor to be so young. The younger generation surpasses the old."

Victoria Langley also looked astonished. "Thank you for looking after our Evelyn."

"Please, just call me Adrian."

Adrian?

William and his wife exchanged glances.

"What's this..." William noticed the distinctive notebook in Adrian's hands.

Adrian explained, "These are the Calendar Notes I borrowed from Professor Quentin Valois in Harvard's physics department."

Seeing William's confusion, he continued, "It's a Harvard physics tradition. Each year's top student records research notes on trending topics with their own analyses and predictions."

"These notes get updated annually like a calendar, passed down through generations of outstanding graduates. Professor Valois bound all his students' notes into volumes."

Though Adrian simplified his explanation, William still looked bewildered.

"Did I make it too complicated?" Adrian asked apologetically.

Victoria suddenly remembered something. "William, wasn't your mentor also surnamed Valois?"

"Quentin Valois?" Adrian blurted out.

"Yes! Exactly!" William grew excited.

Adrian looked surprised. "You studied physics at Harvard?"

William scratched his head sheepishly. "I'm the least accomplished among Professor Valois' students now..."

He'd given up his direct PhD admission offer to return home and care for his parents.

"How is Professor Valois' health?"

"Still sharp as ever," Adrian smiled.

William nodded in relief. "That's good. Adrian, are you also from Harvard physics?"

"I'm from MIT's physics department."

William's eyes lit up. "Physics is wonderful! What's your research focus—"

Victoria quickly interrupted. "The professor surely has things to attend to. Stop pestering him."

Only then did William notice Adrian's briefcase. "My apologies. Don't let me keep you."

"No trouble at all. You've just arrived—I won't intrude. We'll catch up another time."

After seeing Adrian out, Evelyn busied herself unpacking.

Victoria and William wandered through their daughter's cozy two-bedroom apartment, taking in every homely detail.
###Chapter 334

Victoria Langley froze when she pushed open the door.

The peeling wallpaper and yellowed floorboards spoke of the apartment's age, yet the sight before her was unexpectedly charming.

A cream-colored fabric sofa draped with a knitted throw. Delicate ceramic teacups arranged on the coffee table. Potted plants artfully placed beside the TV stand, sunlight filtering through sheer curtains to cast dappled patterns on the wooden floor.

"Wow..." William Langley adjusted his glasses, taking in the surroundings with surprise.

The grimy stairwell had prepared them for the worst, but beyond this door lay an entirely different world.

Victoria's eyes grew misty.

She knew her daughter too well. Since childhood, Evelyn had always kept her space meticulously organized—even the pens in her desk caddy arranged by color. This innate fastidiousness was clearly inherited from her.

Twenty years ago, she and William had squeezed into a tiny 100-square-foot rental. Every payday, she'd buy the cheapest baby's breath bouquet. He'd grumble about the extravagance, yet secretly replace her makeshift vase with a proper one.

"Mom, some tea." Evelyn approached with lemon-infused water.

Victoria accepted the cup, fingertips registering its warmth. Suddenly she remembered her daughter as a little girl, standing on tiptoes to hand her a glass.

"Evelyn," Victoria took a sip, "Professor Klein... is he single?"

Evelyn's hand jerked, splashing tea across the table.

"Mom!" She scrambled for napkins. "Why would you ask that?"

Victoria smiled knowingly. She recognized that flustered reaction all too well—just like William nervously adjusting his collar whenever he used to see her.

"Just curious," Victoria said casually. "A distinguished young man like him must have many admirers."

Evelyn's ears turned pink. She pictured the perpetually lit desk lamp in Professor Klein's study, the slight furrow between his brows as he graded papers.

"He's... very busy," Evelyn murmured. "In all this time living here, I've never seen him with anyone."

Victoria exchanged a glance with William.

The same young man who'd rescued her by the river all those years ago now winked at her in silent understanding.
###Chapter 335

"You conducting a background check now?" William Langley frowned. "Besides, Evelyn probably doesn't know much about his personal affairs. What's the point asking her? Next time, just ask Adrian directly."

Victoria nodded thoughtfully. "Fine, I'll ask him myself when I get the chance."

"Wait—you're actually serious?" William's eyes widened.

Victoria rolled her eyes. "Evelyn, do we have any rock sugar?"

"Yes, I'll get it." Evelyn rose and headed to the kitchen.

Once their daughter was out of earshot, Victoria lowered her voice. "Evelyn lives alone, and this Professor Klein is her neighbor across the hall. They're on good terms. Shouldn't I get to know him better?"

"Ah, right," William scratched his head. "My wife's always so thorough. Heh..."

Victoria shot him a glare. "Don't get cozy. What will Evelyn think if she sees you like this?"

"Ahem!" William immediately straightened up. "I'll behave!"

Evelyn had already prepared a room for her parents, complete with a brand-new bed. The sheets and duvet covers were carefully chosen, freshly laundered, and sun-dried to perfection—soft and fluffy.

"Mom, Dad, rest for a bit," Evelyn said gently. "Later, I'll take you out to explore. You've been to Harvard a few times, but we never got to properly sightsee. This time, we'll make up for it."

William and Victoria had indeed visited Harvard three times before.

The first was when they dropped Evelyn off for college, hearts full of hope.

The second was after hearing she'd started dating someone—they came specifically to meet Nathan Evans. But he arrived late, rushed through a meal, and left.

The third was her graduation, only to learn she'd abandoned further studies to chase so-called love. That visit ended badly, with harsh words and tension.

The first two trips weren't exactly pleasant memories. Hopefully, this time would be different...

While her parents napped, Evelyn went to the market for fresh ingredients and fruit—all their favorites. Towels and slippers were already set out.

At dinner, Victoria eyed the spread and raised a brow. "Not bad. You've inherited my skills."

William muttered under his breath, "Pretty sure those are my skills..."

Victoria pretended not to hear. Evelyn smiled and handed them chopsticks. "Shall we eat?"

After the meal, the three strolled through Harvard's campus. The sunset painted half the sky crimson as students wandered in small groups.

Evelyn led her parents down the tree-lined paths to the library. William froze at the sight of the grand building, mesmerized—until Victoria physically dragged him away.

Back home, William was still mumbling. "I never got to see the Harvard Library..."

As a rural kid who'd attended MIT in his youth, he never had the chance to explore other campuses.

At bedtime, he pleaded with Victoria. "Take me back another day, okay?"

Recognizing his bookish obsession, Victoria agreed easily.

"Honey, you're the best~"
###Chapter 336

"Stop fooling around... time to sleep."
"...Alright."

Rest proved wise. At dawn, Evelyn Langley took her parents straight to the Great Wall.

Morning sun rose.
A crisp breeze whispered.

The sunlight remained gentle when they arrived.

William Langley leaned against the ancient stones, gazing at the undulating mountains.
Victoria Langley suddenly halted.

"Mom?" Evelyn noticed her mother staring intently.
"Is that North Tower 8?"

"Yes."
"The Sunrise Platform... the highest watchtower? Where the Hero Stone stands?"

Evelyn's eyes widened. "You researched this?"
She knew her mother too well.

Victoria always traveled spontaneously, never planning.
Why prepare now?

Victoria smiled without answering.
Confusion flickered in her eyes.

She hadn't researched anything.
Yet these details surfaced automatically when she saw the tower.

Had she... been here before?

William started the climb with grand enthusiasm.
He collapsed after photos at the Hero Stone.

"Enough. Too hot. Too tired. Need rest."
Victoria teased, "Who claimed no problem yesterday? Giving up already?"

William retorted, "At my age, reaching here is impressive! Look at those youngsters turning back halfway."
Indeed, younger climbers retreated along the winding steps below.

Victoria sighed.
No winning arguments with this old rascal.

Evelyn chuckled at their banter.
Victoria caught her immediately: "Laughing? Taking your father's side?"

William winked at his daughter.
Evelyn suggested, "How about a photo together?"

"Perfect!" William sprang up, adjusting his clothes.
Victoria smirked. "So vain."

"Absolutely!" He turned to Evelyn. "Well? Do I look presentable?"

Evelyn gave a thumbs-up. "Dashing! Ready—"
"Wait!"

William's hat sat crooked.
Fumbling hands failed to fix it.

Victoria sighed, reaching up to adjust it herself.
Her red chiffon dress fluttered. The jade hairpin held her updo elegantly.

Though casually dressed, William's handsome features retained their charm.
His gaze at his wife overflowed with tenderness.

Click—
Evelyn captured the moment.

Exhausted, the family slept soundly that night.
Next morning, Evelyn prepared breakfast early.

"Visiting Professor Roland," she informed her parents before leaving.
Returning that afternoon, she found an unexpected guest in the living room—

"Professor?!"
###Chapter 337

Evelyn's hand froze midair as she pushed open the door.

The crisp sound of chess pieces landing on the board echoed from the living room.

She blinked, wondering if she was hallucinating.

Adrian's slender fingers held a red rook, placing it decisively on the chessboard.

"Checkmate." A faint smile played on his lips.

William slapped his knee with a booming laugh. "Brilliant move!"

Evelyn's purse hit the floor with a thud.

Both men turned simultaneously.

"Evelyn's home?" William's eyes lit up.

Adrian stood, his white shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows, revealing well-defined forearms.

"Surprised?" Amusement danced in his eyes.

Evelyn mechanically bent to retrieve her purse.

"Professor, how did you—"

"Let me explain!" William interrupted excitedly. "We met in the elevator this morning when I was grocery shopping!"

Turned out Adrian had come to the neighborhood to collect experimental data.

Their conversation had flowed effortlessly from quantum mechanics to balcony potted plants.

"Adrian even knows how to prune hydrangeas!" William said admiringly.

Adrian shook his head modestly. "Just basic knowledge."

The dynamic shifted completely when physics entered the discussion.

William mentioned recent research findings not yet published in academic journals.

Adrian's eyes flickered with interest. "You follow arXiv preprints?"

"Just bedtime reading." William waved it off casually.

Suddenly remembering something, Adrian pulled out the famous calendar notebook from his briefcase.

His finger paused on a particular page.

"This is..."

William peered closer and chuckled. "That's my conjecture from twenty years ago!"

Beside the densely packed formulas, William's signature stood out clearly.

Evelyn leaned in, eyes widening.

"Dad, you never told me about this!"

"Ancient history." William dismissed it with a hand wave. "Professor Qin insisted I document it back then. Who knew it would survive this long?"

Adrian studied the handwriting intently.

Those predictions, twenty years ahead of their time, were now coming true one by one.

He looked up at Evelyn and suddenly smiled.

"Now I know where your talent comes from."

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting warm pools of light between the three figures.
###Chapter 338

After Evelyn Langley returned home, Adrian Klein politely excused himself. He declined Victoria Langley's invitation to stay for dinner, leaving the precious family reunion time to them.

William Langley was still immersed in their earlier conversation, his eyes shining with admiration. "That Adrian is such a fine young man."

He took a sip of tea and added thoughtfully, "Truly remarkable..."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Dad, you're looking at him like he's your future son-in-law."

"Nonsense! My heart belongs only to your mother!"

Evelyn: "..." The unexpected romantic display caught her off guard.

Considering their exhausting trip to the Great Wall the previous day, William and Victoria decided to rest at home.

Evelyn naturally respected her parents' plans.

The next morning, the family of three set out together.

Their destination was the Forbidden City.

Evelyn had booked tickets a week in advance.

Victoria enthusiastically participated in a Qing dynasty-style photoshoot.

The photographer kept praising, "This lady has such elegant grace. Every movement exudes classical charm, like she stepped right out of a painting..."

Victoria beamed at the compliments.

The photographer's keen eye proved accurate—the final photos were stunning.

That night, Evelyn fell asleep nestled in her mother's arms.

The familiar comforting scent lulled her into slumber.

Upon waking, Evelyn checked her emails out of habit.

To her surprise, the biology journal she'd submitted to requested complete references.

Though she'd double-checked before finalizing the draft, she decided to verify everything once more for absolute certainty.

"Dad, Mom, I'm heading to the library. I should be back by noon."

"Go ahead, don't worry about us."

At midday, the weather changed abruptly.

Sunny skies gave way to dark storm clouds.

Victoria watched the gathering storm with concern. "It's going to pour. Evelyn didn't take an umbrella. The library isn't far—should we go meet her?"

William immediately began gathering rain gear.

As they reached the stairwell, footsteps echoed from below.

The motion sensor light revealed Adrian's familiar figure.

"Adrian? You're back early today?"

After their frequent recent encounters, they'd become quite familiar.

"Are you going out, Mr. and Mrs. Langley?"

"Yes, we're heading to the library to bring Evelyn an umbrella before the rain starts."

Adrian glanced at the ominous sky.

He considered mentioning the library's umbrella loan service, but understood the parents' desire to personally fetch their daughter.

"The library has a complicated layout. Would you like me to guide you?"

"We couldn't impose..." William protested politely.

"I need to retrieve some materials from the lab anyway. It's on my way."

This was only partially true.

While he did have items at the lab, they weren't urgently needed.

Seeing Adrian's insistence, the elder Langleys relented. "We'd appreciate that. We were worried about getting lost in all those branching paths..."
###Chapter 339

"Go straight down this path. There are signs every fifty meters." Adrian Klein pointed ahead. "The north campus has a circular layout. The left leads to Diligence Hall, and the right goes to the library."

William Langley memorized the route carefully, nodding occasionally.

As the trio reached the stairwell, they nearly collided with Evelyn Langley coming upstairs.

"Mom? Dad?" She blinked in surprise. "It's about to rain outside..."

Her gaze landed on Adrian, and she froze. "Professor?"

Victoria Langley quickly explained the situation.

Evelyn immediately thanked Adrian.

The man simply waved it off. "No trouble at all."

On the way back, William enthusiastically extended an invitation. "Adrian, you should come over for dinner sometime. I'll cook!"

Victoria chimed in agreement.

This family shared an identical habit of inviting people to meals—though their motivations differed.

William wanted to show off his culinary skills.

Victoria was just being hospitable.

Evelyn genuinely enjoyed cooking and wanted someone to share it with.

Adrian's gaze flickered toward the girl before he readily accepted.

The moment they stepped inside, Victoria teased her husband. "Look at you, preening like a peacock. Can't wait to flaunt your cooking."

William grinned proudly. "Good skills deserve an audience!"

"Vain!"

Evelyn changed her slippers and asked casually, "Dad, when did you and the professor get so close?"

"You wouldn't understand." William's eyes sparkled. "Adrian and I both study physics and love chess. We hit it off."

Victoria mercilessly exposed him. "He just wanted someone to discuss his paper with."

William was the only physics expert in the household.

Back when Evelyn lived at home, she'd humor his ramblings. Now he lacked even that.

Until Adrian came along.

"Adrian is truly exceptional," William remarked sincerely.

Victoria joked, "Why don't you two become sworn brothers? Make the academic exchanges easier."

William actually considered it seriously.

Two days later, he suddenly brought up the dinner invitation again. "Evelyn, did you invite Adrian?"

"Huh?" She stared blankly. "I thought that was just politeness?"

"Since when do we break promises?" William scowled before turning to his wife with an ingratiating smile. "Right, honey?"

Evelyn watched her father's rapid mood shift with exasperation.

"This task falls to you." William patted his daughter's shoulder. "We'll go buy groceries."

He promptly dragged Victoria out the door.

Leaving Evelyn standing there in bewilderment.
###Chapter 340

Adrian Klein was reviewing last week's experimental data in the laboratory.

His slender fingers flew across the keyboard until he spotted an anomaly in the second group's fourth column.

Just as he was about to call Oliver Lancelot over, his phone rang abruptly.

"Hello?"

A familiar voice answered: "Professor, it's Evelyn."

Adrian's fingers froze mid-air.

He slowly lifted his gaze from the computer screen, his voice unconsciously softening: "What is it?"

"My dad wants to invite you for dinner..." Evelyn's voice carried hesitation, "If you're busy, I can just tell him no."

"Not busy."

There was a noticeable pause on the other end: "...But isn't the lab swamped right now?"

"Manageable."

"Then..."

Adrian cut her off: "See you tonight. Thank your father for me."

After hanging up, Evelyn stared blankly at her phone.

Just yesterday, Natalie had complained on social media about pulling all-nighters in the lab.

How did it become "manageable" when he said it?

Back in the lab, Vincent Macmillan sidled up with a sly grin: "Was that Evelyn?"

Adrian didn't look up: "You already know."

Vincent sighed dramatically: "The rest of us look like sleep-deprived pandas, while Professor Klein remains unflappable. The power of love truly is miraculous."

In reality, Adrian hadn't slept in thirty-six hours.

But he said it as casually as commenting on the weather.

Adrian took a step back, fixing Vincent with an impassive stare: "Where's your data report? Finished the error analysis? Completed the experiment logs? When do you plan to submit them?"

Vincent immediately raised his hands in surrender: "My bad, getting back to work now."

Returning to his station, Vincent sighed at the sea of data on his screen.

He missed the days when Evelyn worked in the lab.

Processing data had felt like magic back then.

Now...

Ah, how the mighty have fallen!

...

At exactly six in the evening, Adrian appeared at the Langleys' doorstep.

He carried an exquisitely packaged bottle of red wine.

William Langley rushed to answer the door, still clutching a spatula: "Adrian! You're here!"

"Good evening, sir. Sorry for intruding."

"Nonsense! Come in, come in—"

Victoria moved to fetch slippers, only to see Adrian smoothly retrieve a pair from the shoe rack.

The practiced ease suggested he'd done this many times before.

"This is for you and Mrs. Langley." Adrian handed over the wine.

Victoria accepted it with a smile: "You shouldn't have brought anything."

"My pleasure."

Her eyes flickered with surprise as she read the label.

Noticing the well-worn slippers on Adrian's feet, the corners of her mouth lifted slightly...
###Chapter 341

The crystal glass held a deep red liquid, shimmering temptingly under the light.

Victoria Langley elegantly uncorked a bottle of aged red wine she had been saving for years.

"We're celebrating today. Have a little," she said, pouring Evelyn Langley a half-glass.

Evelyn nodded obediently.

No one expected—

She secretly refilled her glass twice!

William Langley was enthusiastically detailing his company's new project, while Victoria focused on savoring each dish.

No one noticed Evelyn's little trick.

Except...

"Third glass," Adrian Klein suddenly spoke up.

Evelyn's hand, reaching for the bottle, froze mid-air.

"Oh my!" Victoria finally noticed the empty glass in front of her daughter. "I said just a little. How did you drink so much?"

William frowned too.

But he quickly shifted his attention.

"Adrian, you're incredibly observant! No wonder you've achieved such remarkable success in research..."

William hadn't been idle these past few days.

He had used his connections to thoroughly investigate Adrian's academic background.

With every achievement he uncovered, he marveled for hours.

Victoria had privately told her daughter, "Your father is obsessed."

Evelyn hadn't taken it seriously.

Until now—

"He can even turn this into praise?" she muttered under her breath.

She strongly suspected her father viewed Adrian through rose-tinted glasses.

"Adrian, you pay such close attention to Evelyn, noticing even these small things. As her father, I'm truly ashamed..." William took a sip of wine.

Suddenly, he set down his glass.

"Why don't we become sworn brothers? Evelyn can call you Uncle!"

Victoria nearly choked on her wine.

Evelyn's eyes widened: "?"

Adrian stiffened completely: "!!!"

William grew more animated. "This is a brilliant idea! Victoria and I are in Linshi, while Evelyn is alone in Cambridge..."

"You're steady and reliable. You could look after her studies and daily life..."

"Not as a favor, of course! Just so she has an elder looking out for her while she's away..."

With every mention of "elder," Adrian's eye twitched.

As William prepared to initiate a sworn brotherhood ceremony on the spot, Victoria finally had enough.

"Enough nonsense!" She snatched her husband's glass. "You're drunk and talking rubbish! Adrian is practically Evelyn's age. How can he be her uncle?"

Adrian sat stiffly, mentally giving Victoria a standing ovation.

Evelyn quickly smoothed things over. "Don't mind him, Professor. My dad gets like this when he drinks..."

"It's fine," Adrian forced out. "Uncle is drunk. I won't take it seriously."

"Who's drunk? I'm perfectly sober!" William fixed Adrian with an intense gaze. "I genuinely want to be brothers with you..."

Adrian internally screamed in refusal.

"That's enough!" Victoria's command finally put an end to the absurd discussion.

But William's address for Adrian had already shifted to—

"Little brother, try this peach blossom mandarin fish. It's my specialty."

Adrian: "..."

"How is it, little brother? To your taste?"

Adrian swallowed the fish with difficulty. "...Delicious."

William beamed. "Have more if you like! And this crystal beef..."

For the rest of dinner, Adrian could only mechanically repeat:

"Exquisite..."

"Unique..."

"First time trying it..."

William's enthusiasm only grew.
###Chapter 342

The dinner finally ended. Adrian Klein let out a long exhale as he stood to leave.

"Evelyn, see Professor Klein out," William Langley suddenly said.

Adrian paused mid-step.

He turned to look at Evelyn Langley.

The girl rose slowly, her cheeks flushed an unnatural pink.

She reached the doorway just as the wind slammed it shut with a bang.

"Why bother walking him next door..." she muttered under her breath, waving dismissively. "Bye, Uncle Adrian."

Adrian whirled around.

His eyes narrowed as he advanced step by step. "What did you call me?"

His voice held a dangerous edge.

Evelyn looked up and met his dark, intense gaze.

Too late, she clapped a hand over her mouth.

Her face burned crimson.

"I-I didn't mean to!" she stammered. "I meant to say Professor Klein..."

She stomped her foot in frustration.

Adrian suddenly chuckled. "Daring to drink again?"

He'd noticed her fondness for alcohol last time.

Tonight she'd downed glass after glass right in front of her parents.

"Quite bold." He reached out and lightly tapped her forehead.

The moment the action registered, both froze.

Adrian frowned.

Such boundary-crossing gestures weren't like him.

Evelyn blinked up at him. "Professor, head-tapping makes people stupid."

"..."

"If I turn stupid, how will I compete in the math Olympiad?"

Adrian arched an eyebrow. "Math Olympiad?"

"Yes! The exam's next week." Her expression was dead serious.

"..."

Definitely drunk.

He shook his head in resignation. "You're a sophomore in college."

"Nonsense! I'm only a high school freshman!"

Adrian massaged his temples.

Right. Completely wasted.
###Chapter 343

Evelyn Langley's memory had a gaping hole.

Her last recollection was her father asking her to escort Adrian Klein out.

What happened after?

Complete blankness.

The next morning, she stretched lazily beneath the covers, oblivious to anything amiss.

"Awake?" Victoria Langley entered with a glass of water.

Evelyn accepted it, taking a sip just as her father's voice carried through the door.

"Let's see if you'll dare overdrink again! Last night you were like a feral cat with its fur standing on end."

Drunken antics?

Feral cat?

The glass trembled in Evelyn's hand.

Fragmented images flickered through her mind before vanishing.

She swallowed hard, voice shaky. "Dad...last night I..."

"Hmph! Playing amnesia?" William Langley teased. "I asked you to see someone out, and you ended up clawing their hair into a bird's nest. Adrian had to carry you back..."

"That's enough," Victoria interrupted. "Stop teasing her—look how red her face is." She pulled her husband away, considerately closing the door behind them.

One.

Two.

Three—

"AAAAAH!"

A mortified scream erupted in the bedroom.

Evelyn buried her face in a pillow, wishing she could vanish.

Outside, William and Victoria exchanged amused smiles.

"She takes after you—rowdy when drunk."

"Clearly your genes—can't hold liquor but loves drinking."

Victoria narrowed her eyes. "Say that again?"

William immediately raised his hands in surrender. "My mistake."

......

While the Langleys laughed, Margaret Evans was having a far worse time.

Ever since Linda Lombardi and her son caused that hotel scene, the pair had discovered their golden ticket.

They stationed themselves daily outside the Evans mansion with folding chairs and snacks, resembling dutiful sentinels.

Margaret still felt nauseous remembering that loogie.

"Still there?" she hissed at the returning maid.

The maid trembled. "Yes...the way they stare at us is downright predatory..."

Linda had grown cunning.

She knew better than to trespass, but a war of attrition worked just as well.

Her eerie gaze tracking everyone's movements was enough to unsettle the entire Evans household.
###Chapter 344

Margaret Evans had been hiding at home for seven straight days.

She paced the living room restlessly, fingers twisting a silk scarf. The maids maintained polite expressions, but their whispers still reached her ears.

"Madam is throwing another tantrum..."

"I heard that mother and son keep causing scenes at the gate..."

Margaret slammed her teacup onto the coffee table. She was the esteemed Mrs. Evans—why should she cower in her own home like a fugitive?

"Prepare the car!" She abruptly stood.

The driver, Mr. Thompson, arrived promptly. "Madam, those two are still at the entrance—"

"Drive out!" Margaret's lipsticked mouth pressed into a thin line. "Run them over if you have to!"

She changed into her most expensive Chanel suit and stepped into the car in stilettos.

As the vehicle approached the gates, the mother-son duo squatted like sentinels on either side.

"Faster," Margaret commanded coldly.

Sweat beaded on the driver's forehead as he accelerated.

Linda Lombardi was mid-complaint when she heard the engine roar. She looked up to see the black sedan barreling toward them.

"Watch out!" She yanked her son Tyler aside as the car grazed their clothes.

"Murderers!" Linda shrieked, slapping her thighs. "Think money makes you untouchable? I'll put you on the front page!"

Margaret watched their flailing figures in the rearview mirror, lips curling.

Tyler scrambled up, covered in dust. "Mom, should we keep waiting?"

"Until hell freezes over!" Linda spat. "Let's see how long she can hide!"

Two days later.

Tyler scratched at his mosquito bites when his phone rang. His eyes widened as he listened.

"Mom! A tabloid's offering big money for Evans family dirt!" He waved his phone excitedly. "An exclusive on their scandals!"

Linda's dull eyes gleamed. "How much?"

"Enough for a penthouse!" His voice shook. "They said...if we escalate the drama..."
###Chapter 345

"Mom, Tyler found that bastard's company!"

Tyler Lombardi was a good-for-nothing slacker who specialized in shady dealings.

Nathan Evans hadn't held much hope, but surprisingly, the kid actually tracked down the address of Nathan's firm.

"Perfect! I was just wondering how to find him!" Linda Lombardi's eyes gleamed. "Come on, son. Let's go pay him a visit!"

All those days spent lurking outside the Evans residence had only succeeded in keeping Margaret Evans housebound—no real benefits gained.

Now their chance had finally arrived...

Thirty minutes later.

"This is Nathan Evans's company?" Tyler craned his neck to stare at the towering skyscraper, his Adam's apple bobbing. "How much is this place worth?"

Linda clicked her tongue. "Damn, your sister really landed herself a sugar daddy!"

If they could extort some money from this, they'd be set for life.

Exchanging glances, they marched straight toward the building's entrance.

But the security was tight—no access without a keycard.

Linda spotted a janitor cleaning nearby. She dragged her son into a supply closet and stole two uniforms.

Inside the building, their furtive glances stood out conspicuously.

They squeezed into an elevator with the crowd. Linda whispered, "Son, did your friend say which floor he's on?"

Tyler shook his head. "No, but the big boss must be at the top."

The elevator dinged at the penthouse.

Stepping out, Linda gaped. "This place is huge. Where do we go?"

Tyler was equally lost. "Let's try straight ahead?"

After a few steps, the "CEO's Office" sign loomed before them.

"Halt!" An assistant suddenly stood up and barked. "Which floor are you janitors from?"

He strode over, eyeing the mother-son pair suspiciously.

"We're new hires..." Linda forced a smile. "Wrong floor. Thought we'd clean up while we're here..."

She made to push past toward the office.

"Stop!" The assistant snapped. "No unauthorized personnel in Mr. Evans's office."

His gaze lingered on Tyler's youthful face, brows furrowing. "Show me your ID badges."
###Chapter 346

Linda Lombardi's fingers clenched tightly around the hem of her janitor uniform.

Tyler Lombardi's forehead glistened with sweat as his shifty eyes darted down the hallway.

"Show me your employee badges." The assistant's voice turned sharp. "Or I'll call security immediately."

Linda suddenly ripped off her mask, revealing a sneer. "Cut the act! Get Nathan Evans out here!"

Tyler immediately straightened up. "Yeah! We have business with Mr. Evans. Who do you think you are to stop us?"

Just as the assistant reached for the intercom, the conference room door swung open.

"Mr. Evans..." The assistant exhaled in relief.

Nathan approached with measured steps, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders under the office lights. His gaze swept over the imposters before lingering on Linda's face.

"Carry on." He nodded to his assistant.

The moment the office door opened, Linda barged in with her son in tow, heads held high.

Nathan studied the pair with detached calm.

The woman's crow's feet betrayed her calculating nature, thin lips pressed into a tight line. Though well-maintained, her sharp features undermined what might have been attractive.

Tyler resembled a street thug, his gold chain swaying with every movement.

Linda was sizing up Nathan too.

The man was even more handsome than she'd imagined, his diamond-studded watch nearly blinding her. She licked her lips greedily before suddenly shrieking:

"So you're the one who made my daughter miscarry? Think you can play with people's feelings just because you're rich?"

Tyler immediately chimed in: "My sister's in the hospital right now! You're gonna pay for this!"

Nathan leisurely unbuttoned his suit jacket and settled into his leather chair.

"Continue."

Linda bristled at his indifference. "Don't think your money makes you untouchable! We'll sue you into the ground!"

"Yeah!" Tyler slammed the desk. "We'll ruin your reputation!"

An eerie silence fell over the office.

Nathan's long fingers tapped the polished wood surface.

"Name your price."
###Chapter 347

Though born into wealth, Nathan Evans never relied on his family's privilege.

He'd seen too many lowlifes like Linda Lombardi and Tyler Lombardi.

All righteous talk on the surface, but extortion at heart.

Just as expected—

Linda's eyes gleamed with calculation. "Since you're being direct, I'll cut to the chase. My daughter's been ruined by you. Compensation is only fair. We want this amount..."

She held up five fingers.

Nathan narrowed his eyes.

"Fifty million. Not a penny less!"

A scoff escaped him.

Not anger—pure derision.

Tyler's jaw nearly hit the floor.

They'd agreed on five hundred thousand!

How did it jump a hundredfold?!

"What's so funny?" Linda snapped. "My daughter's innocence and health can't be bought back with money!"

Nathan's smile turned icy. "Can't be bought back? Or simply worthless? Choose your next words carefully."

He'd already shown mercy by not exposing Chloe Valentine's schemes.

Now they dared demand money?

Desperation truly knew no bounds.

"What are you implying?" Linda's face darkened. "How dare you insult my daughter?!"

"Because she's vile. Threw herself at me, faked a pregnancy, then aborted it herself."

Linda's gaze flickered.

She knew.

Nathan arched a brow. "So you were complicit?"

Linda exploded. "You heartless bastard! You ruin my girl and now blame her? Where I come from, beasts like you get drowned in a pig cage!"

"You think you can walk away scot-free? Dream on!"

"Pay up or marry her! Take responsibility!"

Nathan didn't even bother with sarcasm now.

So Chloe learned her treachery at her mother's knee.

Linda kept ranting. "Fifty million cuts all ties. What a bargain!"

"First, she's not worth it. Second, you can't threaten me."

"Lastly—get out. Call security!"

His assistant immediately dialed the intercom.

Guards arrived swiftly, hauling the pair toward the exit.

"Ow—!" Linda face-planted onto the pavement.

"Mom!" Tyler scrambled to help, equally disheveled.

She scrambled up, shaking her fist at the building. "You bastard! Rot in hell! How dare you treat me like this? I curse you #$%&...!"
###Chapter 348

"This is infuriating! After all the trouble to get into Evans Group, that Nathan Evans is impossible to deal with!"

Tyler Lombardi ran his fingers through his hair in frustration before turning to his mother. "Mom, what now? He wouldn't even give us fifty grand, let alone five million! This is all because you suddenly raised the price!"

"Useless brat!" Linda Lombardi jabbed her son's forehead. "What can fifty thousand buy? Not even a bathroom!"

"But he's not falling for it..." Tyler muttered.

Linda smirked. "You know nothing. Look at this office building, the villa Margaret Evans lives in, that watch on Nathan's wrist—each worth millions."

Tyler's eyes lit up. "So..."

"What do wealthy families fear most?" Linda narrowed her eyes. "Reputation. You still have that video of us cornering Margaret at the hotel, right? Edit it and post it online."

Tyler immediately pulled out his phone. "I'll contact Rat and the guys!"

By 3 PM, an explosive video went viral on Vibra.

The footage showed a blurred-faced middle-aged woman grabbing a socialite by the collar, tearfully accusing her son of love-and-leave.

The headline screamed: #Shocking! Elite Socialite Exposed in Public Scandal—The Truth Will Stun You#

Wealthy families, socialites, catfights—each keyword tapped into netizens' gossip cravings.

Tyler spent two grand on Vibra+ promotion.

The results were instant.

Comments flooded in:
"Rich women pull hair too? Who knew!"
"Whose scandal is this?"
"TL;DR: Rich playboy knocked up a commoner, mom came demanding answers."
"Clearly a payout dispute. Waiting for the twist."

Tyler grinned at the skyrocketing views when his phone buzzed.

"Your video has been removed for policy violations."

"What?!" He frantically refreshed. "Where's my video?!"
###Chapter 349

Nathan Evans's phone suddenly vibrated.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

"Hello? Who is this?" He answered the call.

A cold voice came through. "Good day. I'm the head of the legal department at Evans Group. Regarding the false statements you've been spreading online, we've completed our evidence collection."

Nathan's fingers trembled slightly.

"Under relevant laws, we reserve the right to pursue legal action against you." The voice paused. "We advise you to cease all infringements immediately."

After the call ended, beads of sweat formed on Nathan's forehead.

Linda Lombardi scoffed. "Just a legal notice. What's there to fear? The more they react, the guiltier they look!"

She snatched the phone. "Keep posting! For every video they take down, we'll upload ten more!"

But reality hit them hard.

Every video they uploaded was forcibly removed within five minutes.

Nathan stared at the vanished $5,000 he'd spent on promotions, feeling numb.

"Mom, I'm out of money..."

Linda's expression darkened. "Already?"

"Can you lend me some?"

Her eyes darted. "This is too wasteful. Let's try another approach."

She lowered her voice. "Create more burner accounts. Skip paid promotions—rely on organic reach."

Nathan hesitated. "But no one will see them that way..."

Meanwhile, at Evans Group headquarters.

"Mr. Evans, they're still at it," the assistant reported quietly.

Nathan didn't look up. "Let them."

His slender fingers tapped the keyboard. "Just clowns putting on a show."

Yet the spectacle caught the attention of someone it shouldn't have.

Vincent Evans was reviewing documents when his secretary knocked.

"Chairman, there's a matter requiring your attention."

The secretary handed him a tablet.

The video showed Tyler Lombardi's tearful accusations, sharp and grating.

Vincent's brow furrowed. "Contact PR. Handle this immediately."

He dialed an internal line. "Get Nathan back here now."

......

The Evans family estate.

Margaret Evans stood in the living room, barely breathing.

At the sound of the doorbell, she rushed to answer.

"Son," she whispered, "your father is furious."

Nathan walked into the study expressionlessly.

"Dad."

Vincent turned, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"With the shareholders' meeting approaching, you're causing scandals?"

Margaret tried to mediate. "Darling, this won't have much impact—"

"Enough!" Vincent snapped. "Evans Group's stock can't afford any fluctuations!"

He glared at Nathan. "I don't care how you do it. Fix this. Now."

Before leaving, he delivered his ultimatum. "One more misstep, and you're done as VP."

The study door slammed shut.

Margaret exhaled. "Son, this time you really—"

Nathan cut her off. "I know what to do."
###Chapter 350

Nathan Evans yanked off his tie in frustration.

"I told you Chloe Valentine's baby shouldn't have been kept. But you insisted. Now clean up this mess yourself!"

He slammed the door behind him.

Margaret Evans trembled with rage after being scolded by both her husband and son.

"How dare you both blame me? Everything I did was for this family! You understand nothing!"

"Go then—leave—never come back—"

"My husband berates me. My son disrespects me. My grandchild is gone. What sin did I commit in my past life..."

She collapsed onto the sofa.

But the mess remained.

She ordered the butler to find Linda Lombardi's number.

The digits appeared swiftly.

Margaret took a deep breath and dialed.

"Who is this?" Linda snapped, irritated by her video's lack of traction.

"Margaret Evans."

Linda's eyes gleamed.

"Oh?" She drew out the syllable. "What do you want?"

The video had worked.

"Name your terms." Margaret cut to the chase.

Linda exchanged glances with her son. "Terms for what?"

"Stop pretending! You caused this spectacle for money, didn't you?"

Linda narrowed her eyes. "I'm seeking justice for my daughter. Is that how you see it?"

"Hypocrite!" Margaret sneered.

"Watch your tone. You're the one begging now."

"State your price. Consider it charity. Our family donates plenty annually."

Charity?

Beggar?

Linda's blood boiled.

She changed tactics. "Who tried to run us over days ago? Now you come crawling?"

First, she'd savor this.

Margaret fought the urge to hang up.

"Enough! How much?"

Hearing her impatience, Linda deliberately stalled.

"Why rush? Shouldn't you apologize first?"

Margaret gritted her teeth. "The driver was careless. I'll fire him immediately."

"That's it? Money alone won't fix this."

"What else do you want?!" Margaret finally exploded.

Linda spoke leisurely. "Show some sincerity, Mrs. Evans."

A chill ran down Margaret's spine.

Dread pooled in her stomach.
###Chapter 351

"What do you actually want?" Margaret Evans clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms as she suppressed her rage.

Linda Lombardi crossed her legs leisurely, a smug smile playing on her lips.

"My son and I have suffered terribly these past two weeks in Boston. That awful hospital bed left me aching all over, and your driver nearly ran us over. I still have nightmares!" She dramatically massaged her temples. "Surely you owe us compensation for emotional distress?"

Margaret's breathing grew heavier. "Get to the point."

"First, we need better accommodations." Linda's eyes gleamed. "I hear the five-star hotels here are exquisite?"

Tyler Lombardi immediately chimed in. "Mom, if we're doing this, let's get the Presidential Suite!"

Margaret closed her eyes briefly. "...Fine."

That evening, the mother and son checked into a luxury hotel near the hospital.

Though they didn't secure the Presidential Suite, the Executive Suite's opulence left them gaping.

"This bathtub is bigger than our bed at home!" Tyler exclaimed, darting around the room. "Mom, look! The curtains are automatic!"

Linda ran her fingers over the leather sofa, eyes wide. "How much does this cost per night...?"

Suddenly grabbing the room service menu, she gasped. "$288 for a bowl of noodles? Highway robbery!"

Tyler swallowed hard. "Mom, I'm hungry..."

Linda's eyes narrowed. She immediately dialed Margaret. "We're not getting proper nutrition here..."

"Order whatever you want. Put it on my tab." Margaret hung up abruptly.

The pair promptly ordered the most expensive steak and wine.

A uniformed server wheeled in their meal, arranging the silverware with practiced elegance.

"Enjoy your meal." He gave a slight bow.

Linda swirled her wineglass like she'd seen in movies, mentally recalculating: Was $50 million too modest?

......

Three days later, Margaret received another call from Linda.

"What? You want to visit a members-only club?" Margaret's voice sharpened.

Linda spoke matter-of-factly. "That afternoon tea you posted about looked lovely. Take us to experience it."

Margaret nearly crushed her phone. "That's invitation-only!"
###Chapter 352 

"So?" Margaret Evans' face was icy.

"Non-members are prohibited from entering." The attendant politely blocked the doorway.

Linda Lombardi rolled her eyes. "Then just sign her up for membership!"

Margaret's knuckles turned white as she clenched her handbag. Lifetime membership at this club required spending three million. Who did this woman think she was?

"I don't care! We're having afternoon tea here today!" Linda screeched.

In the end, Margaret reluctantly used her own membership card to let them in.

They immediately ran into a group of society ladies in the lobby. Mrs. Zhao, their ringleader, looked surprised. "Mrs. Evans? We've been calling you."

Margaret forced a smile. "My apologies, I didn't notice..."

"And these two are?" Mrs. Zhao eyed Linda and her son. "They look familiar."

Linda jumped in. "Remember when I had that fight with Mrs. Evans here last time? You were there."

The ladies instantly recalled the scandalous scene, their expressions turning knowing.

"So... you've made up?" Mrs. Zhao asked meaningfully.

"All water under the bridge!" Linda crowed. "As they say, it's better to resolve—"

Margaret wanted to strangle her. This idiot had just publicly acknowledged their feud and confirmed Nathan's scandal!

"I see." Mrs. Zhao beamed. "We won't intrude on this... family reunion then."

Margaret's face darkened. Family? With her?

Linda was already gawking around. "How much does that chandelier cost? Are those vases by the entrance for sale?"

After tea, Margaret tried to leave. Linda grabbed her arm. "There's a new jewelry store across the street. Let's go!"

"I have other—"

"What could possibly be more important?" Linda said shamelessly. "Who's going to pay if you don't come?"

Margaret saw black.
###Chapter 353

Su Bao tilted her little head, studying the oddly-dressed ghost before her.

"So the dark circles and black lips are from bad luck!"

The Jinx flicked his bangs away from his eyes. "This is called fashion. What would a kid know?"

Su Bao blinked in confusion. "Fashion?"

The older generation's aesthetic sense was truly baffling!

Ji Chang's voice turned icy. "You deliberately tormented Wei Wan to lure us here?"

The Jinx gave an awkward chuckle. "Not entirely...I just really disliked her..."

Ji Chang snorted. "You've been trapped here for decades at least. Why only act now after Su Bao visited yesterday?"

Seeing he couldn't lie his way out, the Jinx confessed.

He'd been imprisoned in this jail for nearly a century. Even after becoming a malevolent spirit, he couldn't escape.

Prisoners came and went, but none matched his required birth chart.

The day he finally cultivated enough power to become a full-fledged ghost, he excitedly tried scaling the walls—only to get fried by the electric fence.

When attempting the front gate, guard dogs chased him around the compound five full laps.

"It took me ten years to become a ghost...and seven more trying to escape..."

Every escape attempt met with fresh disasters.

"Yesterday when I saw you arrive...I was overjoyed..."

Just as he tried slipping out with them, an elderly visitor's rooster pecked him back inside!

Su Bao asked curiously, "You're afraid of chickens?"

The Jinx stammered, "Roosters carry too much yang energy..."

Su Bao eyed him skeptically. "Really?"

Flipping his bangs, the Jinx changed subjects. "Of course it's true!"

He'd never admit his poultry phobia.

As Su Bao opened her mouth for more questions, the Jinx rushed out, "Take me with you! I'll do anything!"

Su Bao glanced at Ji Chang, who nodded for her to decide.

"There's too many people here!" Su Bao tugged Uncle Yichen's hand. "Let's go, Uncle!"

Without hesitation, Yichen scooped up Su Bao and left.

Wei Wan: "???"

After her tearful pleas, Yichen hadn't even glanced her way, while Su Bao kept talking to thin air.

What was their purpose in coming?!

Wei Wan had never felt so humiliated. She couldn't stay in this cursed place!

"Su Bao!"

She scrambled after them, only to trip when Su JinYu suddenly materialized before her.

JinYu crawled forward with a twisted body. "Sister-in-law...I broke in half..."

Wei Wan shrieked and scrambled backward, kicking wildly even at approaching guards.

"Get away! Don't touch me!"

A guard tased her unconscious.

Before blacking out, Wei Wan thought despairingly: Why am I always the victim?!

As they left, a guard reminded them, "Family visits have limits. Given Wei Wan's poor behavior, wait longer before returning."

Yichen gave a terse acknowledgment.

Su Bao chirped sweetly, "Don't worry officer, we won't come back!"

The guard looked thoroughly confused.

The car rolled past the prison gates.

The moment they crossed the boundary, the Jinx trembled with excitement.

"I'm free! Hahaha!"

"Seventeen years! A full seventeen years!"

"Dragon Pride has returned! No one can stop me now!"

He unleashed a surge of dark energy, bursting through the window to escape.

Ji Chang's eyes turned frosty. "Trying to run?"

Su Bao shouted fiercely, "Stop!"

The Jinx sneered.

With freedom so close, why would he stay?

CRACK!

A lightning bolt struck him mid-flight, slamming him back onto the electric fence for another crispy roasting.

He landed with a splat at a guard dog's feet.

The urinating canine paused.

This scent...wasn't this the shadow it chased five laps last time?

After sniffing cautiously, the dog resumed its business.

Splash...

The drenched Jinx tried rising—only to get golden showered.

Jinx: "......"

The car stopped outside. Su Bao hopped out, squatting to observe him curiously.

"Master, he really can't leave!"

Ji Chang opened the Book of Life. "Ask his birth details."

What sin could bind a spirit to a prison for a century?

Smoking slightly, the Jinx lamented to the skies.

He'd celebrated too soon!

"Wahhh..."

He bawled like an oversized toddler.

Su Bao reached to poke him, but withdrew her tiny finger upon noticing the dog's "artwork."

"Dragon Pride, when were you born? How did you die?"

Defeated, the Jinx mumbled, "January 1988...died in 2005..."

"Pecked to death by a rooster."

Su Bao: "?"

JinYu floated closer. "Details please?"

The Jinx gave the mother-daughter pair a resentful look.

...No use resisting.

"That year I was obsessed with internet cafes. During holiday break, I returned to my rural hometown."

"Mom told me to feed the chickens. Exhausted, I just tossed some feed randomly."

"I stepped in chicken poop, so I scraped my shoe against the wall..."

"The feed bucket fell, hitting me. I stumbled backward onto a hen..."

Su Bao blinked. "Then the rooster killed you?"

JinYu analyzed, "That doesn't sound fatal."

Both stared intently.

Jinx: "......"
###Chapter 354

"This place doesn't even have a water vendor. Just wall-to-wall people!" Linda Lombardi stomped her foot irritably, the crowded exhibition hall making her skin crawl.

"Let's go. We need to get out of here—" Margaret Evans started to turn when her peripheral vision caught a familiar figure.

Evelyn Langley stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Sophia Laurent, accompanied by a middle-aged couple.

The man was photographing artifacts in the display case while the woman leaned close to examine them through the glass. Margaret squinted—the woman's delicate features mirrored Evelyn's perfectly.

"The craftsmanship on this beaded vestment is extraordinary..." William Langley marveled as he snapped pictures. "Look at these patterns and color combinations. It's pure artistry."

This was their second visit. William remained enthralled.

An elderly tour group clustered around them. The guide grinned. "Young man, you're quite knowledgeable. Could you share some insights?"

William obliged cheerfully. He didn't just recite exhibit descriptions—he supplemented with expert commentary:

"Beaded vestments often featured ivory, gold, and gemstone embellishments. They were ceremonial garments for Buddhist statues in Qing dynasty palaces..."

"According to 'Research on Imperial Buddhist Robes,' the Suzhou Weaving Bureau produced seventeen multicolored sets during Emperor Qianlong's reign..."

More visitors gathered. When he finished, enthusiastic applause broke out.

"Sir, could you tell us about this phoenix crown?" A young man pointed to the adjacent display.

William adjusted his glasses. "This dragon-and-phoenix crown belonged to Empress Xiaojing from the Wanli era of the Ming dynasty. Excavated from Dingling Mausoleum. Observe the kingfisher feather and pearl craftsmanship..."

A tourist flipped through the exhibition booklet. "Every detail is accurate! Are you a history professor?"

"I teach physics." William chuckled, waving a dismissive hand.

The crowd erupted.

"A physics teacher with this much historical knowledge? Incredible!"
"Must be a homeroom teacher—they know everything!"

Sophia teased from the sidelines: "Uncle, you're amazing! And Auntie is stunning!"

All eyes turned to Victoria Langley. She stood gracefully beside her husband, radiating quiet elegance.

Margaret lingered at the periphery, watching William hold court as awed murmurs rippled through the audience.

She glanced back at Linda and her son impatiently urging her to leave. An inexplicable bitterness welled up in her chest.

The contrast couldn't have been starker.
###Chapter 355

The crowd gradually dispersed. Evelyn Langley was about to head to the next exhibition hall when she turned and nearly collided with Margaret Evans.

Sophia Laurent dramatically gasped.

Evelyn remained composed, calmly averting her gaze.

They had long become strangers, not even on nodding terms.

This was for the best—no entanglement, no connection.

To everyone's surprise, Margaret stepped forward with a forced smile. "Evelyn, what a coincidence."

William Langley and Victoria exchanged puzzled glances.

Sophia whispered something in their ears.

Victoria's eyes instantly turned frosty.

The smile vanished from William's face.

Before Margaret could speak, Linda Lombardi's shrill voice cut in—

"What's taking so long? This dump is stuffy and reeks. Let's go!"

"Mom, I'm hungry." Tyler Lombardi kicked the ground impatiently.

Linda commanded imperiously, "Go buy my son the most expensive food you can find!"

Margaret wished the ground would swallow her whole.

Evelyn and Sophia exchanged a glance, both seeing shock in each other's eyes.

Was this the same haughty Margaret they knew?

Sophia's eyes sparkled mischievously as she smiled at Tyler. "And you are...?"

"I'm Tyler Lombardi!" The teenager's eyes lit up. "What's your name, beautiful?"

The Lombardis...

Evelyn's gaze darkened.

She'd already heard from Sophia about Chloe Valentine's miscarriage and hospitalization. Margaret had turned a blind eye, and Nathan Evans had avoided the situation entirely.

It had come to this.

Evelyn felt no satisfaction—only sorrow for another woman's fate.

Sacrificing youth, education, and health for a man...

Was it worth it?

She was grateful she'd extricated herself in time.

Sophia feigned curiosity. "So you and Mrs. Evans are...?"

"She dragged us to this dump!" Tyler complained like a burst dam.

Sophia's eyes widened in mock realization. "So Aunt Margaret has become someone's lackey now."

"Sophia Laurent!" Margaret's face turned ashen. "Watch your tone!"

"Did I say something wrong?" Sophia smirked coldly. "The Evans and Laurent families share no connections."

Her words stabbed Margaret's heart like knives.

"Let's go." Sophia linked arms with Evelyn. "Don't waste time here."

Linda watched their retreating figures and sneered. "How unpopular."

Margaret clenched her fists.

The brief encounter was soon forgotten. Evelyn took her parents through the remaining exhibits before leading them to an upscale French restaurant.

"This place must be expensive," Victoria remarked, eyeing the elegant decor.

Evelyn smiled, looping her arm through her mother's. "It's a rare outing. Let's indulge."
###Chapter 356

Victoria Langley smiled faintly and said no more.

William Langley strolled into the restaurant without a care in the world—until he opened the menu. His entire body stiffened.

"The cheapest steak costs four figures?"

Evelyn Langley quickly handed him a membership card. "We get a discount."

William exhaled deeply and took a sip of lemon water. "How much of a discount?"

"Five percent."

He nearly spat out his drink.

"Dad! Manners!"

Sophia Laurent was already doubled over with laughter.

When the first bite of steak touched his tongue, William had to admit—sometimes expensive meant exquisite.

Meanwhile, Linda Lombardi and her son choked down terrible fast food near the Forbidden City.

As soon as they left the tourist area, Tyler Lombardi demanded, "I want proper Western food! The most expensive kind! If you try to cheap out, we're going somewhere else!"

Margaret Evans barely suppressed the urge to roll her eyes.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor. They chose the exact restaurant where Evelyn was dining.

Only a curtain separated the two private rooms.

A server handed them a tablet menu.

Linda stared helplessly at her son.

Tyler, however, leered at the server's curves with undisguised vulgarity.

The server subtly took two steps back.

Linda randomly tapped the prettiest-looking dishes without reading descriptions.

They ended up with nothing but appetizers and desserts.

Under the server's bewildered gaze, mother and son devoured the food with gusto.

Margaret wished the floor would swallow her whole.

Evelyn recognized the voices next door immediately.

She couldn't be bothered to acknowledge them.

"Dad, try this Beef Wellington."

She carefully cut a portion and placed it on William's plate.

Victoria immediately protested, "Where's mine?"

"I thought you hated food someone else touched?"

"My own daughter doesn't count as 'someone else.'"

Evelyn laughed and served her mother an even larger portion.

Watching this warm family moment, Sophia's eyes shimmered with quiet envy.

When Margaret excused herself to the restroom, cheerful laughter drifted from the next room.

The sight of William and Victoria's refined table manners twisted the knife in her heart.

Finally, she understood the magnitude of her mistake.

She'd rejected a priceless pearl—only to choose a worthless pebble.

And ended up shackled to these two grotesque creatures.
###Chapter 357

Sophia Laurent's phone rang abruptly.

She glanced at the caller ID and frowned slightly before standing up. "An urgent matter at the lab. I have to go," she apologized to the group.

Evelyn Langley nodded, watching her hurried departure.

William Langley cradled his phone like a child with a new toy, chattering excitedly about the artifact photos he'd taken at the museum.

"This gold-painted enamel cup and saucer set is a treasure from the Qianlong era..."

His voice echoed through the hallway.

Victoria Langley smiled faintly, amused by her husband's rare enthusiasm.

Evelyn walked quietly behind her parents, occasionally murmuring in response.

The seventh-floor lighting was dim.

Just as the key turned in the lock, the door across from them swung open.

"Sophia, heading out so late?" William greeted warmly.

Evelyn turned and unexpectedly met a pair of smiling eyes.

Adrian Klein stood there in a simple white shirt, sleeves rolled to his elbows, revealing toned forearms.

It was their first encounter since that drunken night.

Remembering her father's teasing about her tipsy behavior, Evelyn's ears burned. She quickly averted her gaze.

"Lab data needs processing," Adrian replied, his voice low and calm.

"You young folks work too hard," William remarked. "Come by for chess sometime?"

"Absolutely."

......

Margaret Evans dragged her exhausted body back to the old house.

She collapsed onto the couch like a limp rag, too tired to lift a finger.

Spending the day shopping with Linda Lombardi and her son had been a nightmare.

"Mom! I got in!"

Isabella Evans bounded downstairs like a whirlwind, waving her acceptance letter.

"Bioinformatics—Professor Beatrice Merouin's research group!"

Margaret barely lifted her eyelids. "Congratulations."

"What's wrong? You look awful," Isabella finally noticed her mother's pallor.

"Your brother's mess, that's what!" Margaret sat up abruptly. "That woman and her son—"

She recounted the day's ordeal through gritted teeth.

Isabella's expression darkened. "You shouldn't indulge them!"

"What choice do I have?" Margaret massaged her temples. "I just want them to take the money and disappear."

Isabella scoffed, running her fingers over the acceptance letter.

That million-dollar jade bracelet had been worth every penny.

Even if it was technically a "friendship discount" of five hundred dollars.

She'd done her research—Professor Merouin had a well-known weakness for jade.

This move had been calculated perfectly.
###Chapter 358

Margaret Evans stared blankly at the crystal chandelier overhead, her fingers absently tracing the sofa armrest.

"If only I'd accepted Evelyn Langley back then..."

She murmured the words so softly they were almost inaudible.

Isabella Evans paused mid-peel beside her, the knife's blade making faint scratching sounds against the apple skin.

"Tell me about it."

Had she not objected, she might be holding a grandchild by now instead of worrying about graduate school quotas.

But there were no second chances in life.

......

At the bistro, Sophia Laurent stood abruptly after hanging up her phone.

"My treat."

She slapped her black card on the table and arched a brow at Evelyn.

"Try paying and I'll make you regret it."

With that, she grabbed her purse and strode out, heels clicking decisively.

Thirty minutes later, a blue sports car pulled up outside BlueMaple Entertainment.

A tall young man jogged over and smoothly opened the passenger door.

"Babe!"

Dominic Alpinus slid into the seat, eyes sparkling.

The breakout star of recent mini-dramas had delicate features and luminous fair skin.

"What's wrong?"

Sophia brushed sweat from his temple.

"My agent wants me at this dinner..." Dominic bit his lower lip. "I'm scared."

His red-rimmed eyes made him resemble a frightened rabbit.

Sophia was powerless against that look.

"I'll go with you."

She pinched the young actor's cheek.

"Really?" Tears spilled over even as he brightened. "You're the best, Vi."

......

The neon lights of Leisurely Club blazed conspicuously in the night.

Sophia narrowed her eyes.

She'd heard of this place—an infamous "hunting ground" in their circles.

"You're sure about this location?"

"Brother Wang said the investors chose it." Dominic whispered. "There's a supporting role in an S-tier project..."

The moment the private room door opened, Sophia froze.

Every face was familiar.

Dylan Lowell choked on his drink.

"Holy—" He elbowed Julian Roscente. "Why's your girlfriend here with some actor?"

Julian set down his chopsticks with icy precision.

His gaze turned glacial as it landed on Dominic's hand resting on Sophia's shoulder.

The temperature in the room plummeted.
###Chapter 359

Dominic Alpinus quietly took a seat beside Sophia Laurent and raised his glass for a toast.

"My apologies for being late. Let me make it up with three drinks."

He downed three consecutive shots, maintaining a polished smile as he continued circulating.

At the head of the table sat Victor Merovingian, the entertainment mogul and CEO of JoyRay Entertainment, who observed Sophia with keen interest.

"Vivi, what suddenly sparked your interest in showbiz?"

"Just a casual whim." Sophia swirled her wine glass absently.

"My door is always open if you need assistance." Victor completely ignored Dominic's toast, focusing solely on Sophia.

"Uncle Victor, don't tease me. I know nothing about this industry."

Victor had been close friends with Sophia's father for decades, making her familial address natural.

A flicker of surprise crossed Dominic's eyes.

Now he understood why Manager Wang had insisted he bring Sophia tonight.

"Mr. Merovingian, Vivi genuinely dislikes the entertainment world. She always says distance preserves beauty."

"Haha... Still as spirited as ever. And you are?"

Victor finally acknowledged him.

"Dominic Alpinus, an artist under BlueMaple Entertainment. Two years in the industry with no notable works yet."

"At least you're honest."

"I wouldn't dare play games with someone like you."

Watching their polite exchange, Sophia suddenly found the entire affair tedious.

She stood abruptly. "Just remembered something urgent. I'll take my leave."

Victor waved dismissively. "Go ahead. I'll schedule tea with your father soon."

"Sure."

Dominic's expression darkened. Excusing himself to the restroom, he hurried after her.

"Vivi—"

Sophia halted and turned with icy detachment. "Yes?"

"Why the sudden coldness?" His eyes reddened instantly, tears welling on cue.

"Don't play dumb."

"What did I do wrong?" He feigned innocence, eyes brimming with hurt.

Sophia smirked, her gaze raking over him like a scalpel.

Dominic squirmed under her scrutiny but reassured himself—she'd always been soft-hearted and easy to placate.

"Dominic," Sophia spoke abruptly, "know the rules?"

"What?"

"I fund you. I give you resources. Your only job is to stay in line."

"Vivi..."

"Ask directly for what you want. Whether I grant it depends on my mood. But—"

Her eyes sharpened into blades. "Never scheme against me. Understood?"
###Chapter 360

"It's like my pet cat. When it's hungry, it rubs against me and acts cute—I know it's time to feed it."

Sophia Laurent's voice turned icy. "But if that cat dares to raise its claws to scratch me, do you still think it's a good cat?"

Dominic Alpinus's face paled instantly. "Sophia, you've got it all wrong... It was Victor who—"

"What he said doesn't matter." A cold smirk played on her lips. "What matters is you used me to get close to Mr. Merovingian, didn't you? Or was that also something Victor taught you? What an excellent manager he is."

"That's not true!" Dominic protested desperately. "I was just nervous about the event and wanted you there with me—"

"Nervous?" She arched a brow. "You seemed perfectly at ease at the dinner table, clinking glasses with those investors. Not a trace of nerves in sight."

He fell silent.

"Enough." Sophia turned to leave. "From now on, we're strangers."

Suddenly—

"Trying to dump me?" A man's voice, cold as steel, cut through the air. "Do you really think it's that easy?"

Sophia turned back to see the face that once radiated sunshine now twisted with malice, his eyes brimming with naked greed.

"Three million. Plus the lead role in that blockbuster film. Then I'll pretend none of this ever happened."

Sophia chuckled softly, stepping closer until she stood right before him. "Blackmailing me?"

"Call it whatever you want."

"Do you even deserve that much?" Her gaze was pure disdain.

"What about our private videos? Are those enough to qualify?"

Instead of panicking, Sophia's smile only widened. "Go ahead and leak them. I couldn't care less."

"You—" Dominic's eyes bulged.

"Is there anything about my face or body to be ashamed of? But you—" She leaned in, her breath brushing his ear. "Once those videos go public, how long do you think your sugar daddies' dirty secrets will stay hidden?"

"I'm not in the entertainment industry. But you? How badly do you want your career to survive?"

Each word struck like a blade.

His expression shifted rapidly before morphing back into that pitiful, puppy-eyed look. "Sophia, I was wrong. Please forgive me..."

She reached up and patted his cheek, her eyes glacial. "When I liked you, I gave you resources, connections, affection. Now that I don't, you're nothing but trash."

"Know your place. Don't overestimate your worth."

"To put it nicely, you were my little boyfriend. To put it bluntly? Just a pet cat I kept around."

"And if a cat dares to scratch its owner—" She enunciated each syllable slowly. "Do you know what happens next?"

"Broken. Claws. Pulled. Teeth."

With every word, his face grew paler.

By the end, he was trembling violently, his shirt soaked with sweat.

So this was how heiresses of wealthy families operated—not a single one could be fooled.

Sophia watched his reaction with satisfaction.

As she turned to leave, her stilettos clicked sharply against the floor.

In the shadows, a cigarette burned down to its filter.

Julian Roscente crushed the ember underfoot, his gaze following that slender, retreating figure.

Tsk. Ruthless.

Even more decisive than he was when dumping women.

And yet—

Damnably alluring.
###Chapter 361

Julian Roscente smirked and quickened his pace to catch up with the familiar figure.

His fake girlfriend had just broken up. He had to make some gesture.

......

Dominic Alpinus returned to the private dining room in a daze, forcing a smile as he continued toasting the investors.

Sophia Laurent had already cut ties with him. Threats were useless—this dinner was his last chance.

"Mr. Lowell, I've long admired your reputation. Finally getting the chance to toast you today—I hope for your guidance in the future."

In the past, he wouldn't even have been allowed near these industry titans.

Dylan Lowell swirled his wine glass lazily. "You are...?"

"Dominic Alpinus."

"Ah, right. Can you hold your liquor?"

"I can manage a few glasses. Don't laugh at me."

"I heard you're eyeing the third male lead in Mr. Merovingian's S-period drama?"

Dominic stiffened. "Mr. Lowell means...?"

"It's not impossible to arrange, right, Victor?"

Victor Merovingian raised a brow. Though confused, he played along. "Of course."

A flicker of hope lit Dominic's eyes.

Dylan: "Just one small condition. Shouldn't be hard for you."

"Name it."

"Finish every drink on this table, and the role is yours."

The room erupted in rowdy cheers.

Dominic's face paled. "Mr. Lowell, this—"

"What? Scared? No problem—I'll give it to someone else."

The table was laden with liquor.

Red wine. Baijiu. Whiskey.

Drinking it all would land him in the hospital—if he survived.

But Dominic only hesitated three seconds—

"I'll drink."

Dylan clapped. "That's the spirit."

As Dominic tipped back the first glass, Dylan pulled out his phone and texted Julian:

[Done as you asked]
[All because that punk touched your fake girlfriend?]
[Thought we agreed to play separately? Can't handle it?]

No reply.

At that moment, Julian was following Sophia into a nightclub.

This woman was something else.

Fresh from dumping her boytoy, she came straight here to party.

On the dance floor, a man approached her.

Sophia gave him a once-over. "Too greasy. Not interested."

She walked off, leaving him fuming.

Julian laughed so hard from his booth he slapped his thigh.

"What's so funny?" Sophia returned from dancing and kicked him. "That amusing?"

"Hilarious, hahaha..."

"You're greasier than him."

"?"

"Mocking him is mocking yourself."

"??"

This woman's tongue was lethal.

Sophia sat down and poured herself a drink.

Still sweating from dancing, her hair clung to her neck, chest rising and falling slightly.

But this reckless abandon felt exhilarating!

"Why'd you follow me? Dinner over?" she asked casually.

"Boring. When did you spot me?"

"The second I walked in. Need something?"

Julian swirled his glass with a half-smile. "Worried you'd get bitten by a dog and do something stupid. Came to supervise."

"Pfft—that's it? You underestimate me."

"Aren't all women like that?"

"Wrong. Can't speak for others, but me? I'm bulletproof."
###Chapter 362

Julian Roscente burst into laughter.

"What's so funny?" Sophia Laurent glared at him.

"Should I cry for you instead?"

"Go ahead. I've got tissues."

"......"

Julian pulled out his lighter.

Sophia reached out.

He thought she was offering to light his cigarette, but—

Smack!

She slapped his hand away. "I want the cigarette! Why are you handing me the lighter?"

Julian: "?"

He lit his own first, then wisely leaned in to light hers.

The flame flickered, illuminating her face.

She lowered her head, biting the filter between her lips. The red stain of her lipstick lingered on the paper.

Julian stared, mesmerized.

"Hey. Put it away."

"......Oh!" He fumbled to pocket the lighter.

They stayed at the bar until dawn, finishing an entire bottle of wine.

Too drunk to drive, Sophia opened the ride-hailing app.

Thirty-six people ahead in the queue.

She: "......"

"Don't bother. You won't get a driver here at this hour."

"Then I'll take a cab and pick up my car tomorrow."

The taxi app showed an even longer wait.

Sophia rolled her eyes. "How are you getting home?"

Julian: "I'm not."

"Hm?"

He pointed across the street. "See that hotel?"

Sophia arched a brow. "And?"

"It's mine."

"So?"

"Just stay there. Easy."

Sophia's eyes lit up. "Makes sense. Let's do that."

Cough—

"We?" Julian choked on his own spit.

Sophia was already striding toward the road. "What are you waiting for? Let's go check in!"

The night breeze lifted her hair, her silhouette striking against the city lights.

Julian hurried after her. "Watch for cars!"

The front desk clerk immediately greeted him. "Good evening, Mr. Roscente."

"Get her a room."

Sophia: "What about you?"

"I have a permanent suite."

"Then I want one too."

Julian scoffed. "No shame, huh?"

"As your official girlfriend, shouldn't I get some perks?"

"Fine." Julian turned to the clerk. "Prepare a permanent suite for her as well."

Sophia took the keycard with satisfaction.

They rode the elevator to the top floor, their rooms facing each other.

Julian had just showered and settled in when the doorbell rang.

The manager stood there, grinning obsequiously as he ushered in a woman. "Mr. Roscente, this is Danielle. New here."

"Take good care of him." The manager winked.

"Hello, Mr. Roscente." The woman curtsied, her voice dripping sweetness.
###Chapter 363

Julian Roscente frowned, his interest waning.

"No need. Take her away."

The manager maintained his smile, giving a subtle glance to Xiao Dan as they both retreated.

At the hallway corner—

Xiao Dan bit her lip in frustration. "I thought Mr. Roscente always requested company when he came here. Why not today...?"

The manager scoffed. "Even men have nights when they're not in the mood. Did you really think everyone was as desperate to climb the social ladder as you?"

"But I prepared so hard..."

His cold gaze swept over her meticulously applied makeup. "Save it. Mr. Roscente has no appetite tonight. Don't flatter yourself."

Xiao Dan clenched the hem of her dress.

Meanwhile, Sophia Laurent was drying her hair in a bathrobe when the doorbell rang.

Assuming it was Julian—

"What do you want at this hou— Huh?"

A stranger stood outside—a young man scratching his head awkwardly.

"Sorry, wrong room, I think."

Sophia moved to shut the door.

A slender hand pressed against it.

"Something else?" She arched a brow.

The boy's eyes suddenly turned pleading. "You really don’t remember me, sis?"

Sophia studied him with amusement.

There were only two suites on this floor.

Wrong room? Yeah, right.

Dressed in an oversized white tee and light khaki cargo pants, he exuded a refreshing boyish charm.

Exactly her type.

"Chen...?"

"Xuhe," he supplied eagerly, eyes bright.

"Chen Xuhe," Sophia crossed her arms. "What do you want?"

"Dominic Alpinus took you to a dinner party?"

"So what if he did?"

"Then you should switch to me." He stepped closer. "I'm younger, cleaner, and most importantly—"

Lowering his voice, he added, "I know the rules better."

Sophia chuckled. "Offering yourself?"

His ears flushed pink. "If you're willing..."

"Come in."

She turned and walked deeper into the suite.

Chen Xuhe swallowed hard and quietly closed the door behind him.

......

Julian tossed restlessly in bed.

Too hungry to sleep.

He called room service for a late-night snack, then hesitated before knocking on the door across the hall.

"Want something to eat?"

"...No!"

He turned to leave but froze.

That voice sounded... off.

"You okay?"

Silence.
###Chapter 364

Julian Roscente scoffed coldly. This woman had absolutely no sense of boundaries!

He returned to his room alone, his appetite gone. He collapsed onto the bed without another thought.

Moonlight spilled like water across the silent night.

By nine the next morning, Julian was already marching straight to Sophia Laurent's room.

His hand hovered mid-knock when the door suddenly swung open from inside.

"Soph—"

He froze.

A young man stood in the doorway, his hair disheveled, eyes still heavy with sleep.

Their gazes locked.

Julian's mind went blank.

The man gave a casual nod, keeping his voice low. "She's still asleep."

Then he strolled past without another word.

Julian stood rooted in the hallway for a full thirty seconds before reality crashed over him.

Sophia had actually brought a man back to his hotel—to spend the night?

He stormed into the room and slammed the door with enough force to rattle the frame.

Unfortunately, the soundproofing was impeccable. Not even a whisper of noise escaped.

Furious, he kicked over a chair—only for the plush carpet to swallow the impact.

With a sharp yank, he tore open the curtains.

Blinding sunlight finally jolted Sophia awake.

"Adrian Lefèvre! Are you trying to die?!"

She sat up with a snarl, squinting against the glare.

"Close the damn curtains!" she barked.

Julian let out a humorless laugh.

His face darkened as his gaze raked over the love bites scattered across her skin.

"Sophia Laurent. You’ve been busy."

Hearing his voice, Sophia snapped fully alert.

She blinked up at him, then yanked the sheets higher. "Julian? What the hell—since when do you barge in uninvited?"

"Someone opened the door for me." His eyes swept the room, finding no available seating. He perched on the edge of the bed instead. "Quite the seamless transition, I see."

"Who pissed in your cereal this morning?" She burrowed deeper into the blankets. "If you’re just here to bitch, get out."

Then she flopped back onto the pillows.

"...Close the curtains."

Julian stared, dumbfounded.

She’d actually gone back to sleep.

When Sophia woke again, the room was bathed in soft light.

She stretched leisurely.

"Finally awake?" Julian’s voice was ice.

Sophia flicked a glance his way. "You’re still here?"

She shrugged on a silk wrap, revealing fresh marks along her collarbone.

"Perfect." She pointed lazily. "Get me some ice water."

Julian’s expression turned thunderous.

"The fridge is right there." She rolled her eyes. "Don’t even know your own hotel..."

A vein pulsed at his temple.
###Chapter 365

"What are you staring at? Go get me water!" Sophia Laurent kicked the blanket impatiently.

Julian Roscente stood up with a dark expression.

The ice water cooled her throat, bringing some clarity to Sophia's mind.

"Did you need something?" She adjusted her robe. "Sorry to keep you waiting..."

While he fetched the water, she had already dressed properly. Noticing the clock striking eleven, she arched an eyebrow.

"Sorry?" Julian sneered. "Since when does the great Sophia Laurent apologize?"

He slammed the glass onto the coffee table.

"Ordering me around like a servant?"

Sophia frowned. "Who pissed in your cereal this morning?"

"Explain the man from earlier."

"Explain what?" She combed her fingers through her hair absently. "Do you report every woman you sleep with to me?"

Julian's Adam's apple bobbed. "I'm your boyfriend now."

"Fake boyfriend," Sophia corrected. "Clause three: no interference in personal lives. I didn't break our agreement or embarrass you."

She glanced around the suite. "This is nice. Keep it reserved for me."

A vein throbbed at Julian's temple.

"Get me an extra keycard too," she added.

"...For who?"

"For other people, obviously." She gave him a look reserved for idiots. "One key isn't enough."

The door slammed shut behind Julian's exit.

"Psycho," Sophia muttered at the empty doorway.

Room 1901's door burst open with a kick.

Julian grabbed the phone. "No duplicate keys for 1901!"

He dialed the manager next. "Send ten women up here!"

The assistant intercepted the call. "Right away, sir!"

Twenty minutes later, the suite overflowed with giggling women.

"All ten?" Julian deliberately raised his voice.

The manager wiped his brow. "Yes, sir. Not one less."

"Get them inside!"

The women tittered as they flooded into the room.

As the manager turned to leave, Julian yanked him back by the collar.

"What's this about 1901?"

"As you instructed... permanent reservation..."

Julian's pupils constricted. "When did I say that?"
###Chapter 366

"Say that again." Julian Roscente's voice was icy.

The manager trembled. "Room 1901 just checked out..."

"She left?!" Julian shot up from his chair, the legs screeching against the floor.

The manager took a step back. "Y-yes, about ten minutes ago."

"Damn it—"

The manager looked bewildered.

Julian yanked at his tie in frustration. "Get those women out of here! They're driving me insane—"

The manager hesitated. Just half an hour ago, this young master had personally called to arrange for female company.

Chaos erupted in his wake.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Langley's life remained as tranquil as ever.

At seven in the morning, sunlight filtered through the curtains.

She stretched lazily and got up to make breakfast.

By eight-thirty, she left the house with a grocery basket.

At exactly nine, she returned with fresh vegetables. As she pushed open the door, her father's excited voice greeted her. "...I never knew you were so knowledgeable about botany too!"

She froze mid-motion while slipping off her shoes.

A familiar male voice drifted from the balcony. "You flatter me, Mr. Langley. Just a passing interest."

Adrian Klein.

Evelyn placed the groceries in the kitchen, poured two cups of warm honey water, and walked toward the balcony.

William Langley and Adrian sat with their backs to her on small stools. Seven or eight flowerpots lay scattered before them, soil strewn across the floor.

"Dad, Professor, have some water."

"You're back, Evie?" William turned, noticing the dirt on his hands. "Let me wash up first."

Adrian calmly removed his gloves and accepted the cup. "Thank you."

Evelyn eyed the soil-stained cuffs of his sleeves. "No lab work today, Professor?"

"An experiment this afternoon." He took a sip. "Ran into your father while taking out the trash after my morning jog."

William wouldn’t let such an opportunity slip.

Hearing Adrian was free, he’d eagerly invited him over.

Adrian had showered at home before coming.

"About last time..." Evelyn's ears burned. "I drank too much. I’m really sorry."

"Last time?" Adrian raised a brow.

She bit her lip, unsure if he genuinely didn’t remember or was teasing her.

"That dinner... when I got drunk. If I said anything strange..."

Amusement flickered in Adrian's eyes. "Nothing much."

Seeing her nervousness, he added, "Just a bit... lively."

Aside from insisting on comparing heights and nearly tearing his shirt, it really was nothing.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"Though," Adrian suddenly leaned closer, voice dropping, "don’t casually ask a man if he’s capable next time."

She stiffened instantly.

Memories flooded back.

"Let me touch you! You touched my head first!"

Drunk, she’d grabbed his collar, practically hanging off him.

Adrian’s breath hitched, but she remained oblivious, pressing closer.

"Just once... Are you even capable?"
###Chapter 367

Memories flooded back, catching Evelyn Langley off guard.

That crazy girl who wouldn't let go of someone's collar—was that really her?

She looked up to meet Adrian Klein's meaningful gaze, wishing she could disappear into the ground.

"Remember now?" Adrian asked.

"I..."

"Would you like someone knocking on your head? You're not a temple wooden fish. And what if it made you stupid?"

His casual remark eased most of Evelyn's tension.

"But you started it first..." she muttered under her breath.

Once the floodgates of memory opened, fragmented scenes came rushing out.

He had indeed made the first move.

Adrian said seriously, "Alcohol should be tasted, not indulged."

"Got it."

Evelyn nodded with her neck tucked in, resembling a startled quail.

"What are you two discussing?" William Langley approached, drying his hands before downing a bowl of pear soup.

Adrian took a slow sip. "We were talking about drinking—"

"Speaking of which, Adrian should stay for lunch. Let's have a drink, son. We haven't finished discussing that nuclear project!"

Adrian didn't immediately agree, instead turning to Evelyn. "What do you think?"

"Maybe... we shouldn't?"

Alcohol leads to trouble!

"The professor has lab work this afternoon—no drinking. Dad, you shouldn't either. Let's just eat."

William nodded. "Can't delay important work. We'll just have a casual drink then."

"Oh?" Adrian raised an eyebrow. "Evelyn can hold her liquor?"

"Absolutely! Just yesterday she offered to drink with me before her mother stopped her."

Evelyn blinked frantically, but her father missed the signals.

"But the kid knows her limits—usually just samples." William suddenly remembered and added, "Last time was special."

Evelyn: "..."

Adrian smiled. "True, she's always known her limits."

The proud father beamed at his daughter's praise.

Lunch was again prepared by William.

He worked efficiently, soon covering the table with dishes—all different from last time.

At the table:

"Adrian, don't stand on ceremony! Eat up!"

After urging his future son-in-law, he turned to his daughter: "Where are the glasses? I'll get—"

"Dad! Don't—" Evelyn stopped him.

William: "?"

"Alcohol harms health. Let's all abstain."

William looked shocked—this contradicted his daughter's previous stance.

Evelyn declared righteously, "I've reflected deeply and quit drinking. You should too."

William: "..."

"Mom dislikes the smell of alcohol, right?" Evelyn sought her mother's support.

William: "..."

This wasn't his little princess—just a traitor with a leaky coat!

After the meal, Adrian automatically rolled up his sleeves to help clear the table.
###Chapter 368

William Langley quickly reached out to stop him.

"Don't trouble yourself. I can handle it."

Adrian Klein continued clearing the table without pause. "You didn't hesitate to invite me for dinner. Don't start being formal now."

"Well..."

William was still hesitating when Adrian efficiently gathered the dishes and headed toward the kitchen.

Victoria Langley stared at his retreating figure in surprise.

"Impressed, aren't you?" William whispered proudly. "You don't see many diligent young men like him these days. Reminds me of myself at his age. No wonder we get along so well."

Victoria shot him an exasperated look.

Even when complimenting others, he couldn't resist praising himself.

At one in the afternoon, Adrian prepared to leave.

William, tending to his plants on the balcony, called out immediately. "Evelyn, see your Uncle Adrian out!"

Adrian froze mid-step, his back visibly stiffening.

Evelyn Langley sprang up from the couch. "Dad! Stop with the 'uncle' nonsense! Professor, let me walk you—"

"Alright."

After they left, William muttered under his breath, "But last time we agreed he'd be an uncle..."

......

Two weeks passed in a blink.

Evelyn felt the timing was right to arrange a meeting between Victoria and Simon Croix.

"Mom, there's actually another reason I invited you and Dad to the capital."

"What is it?"

Evelyn slid a document folder across the table. "This is the contract you signed with Penelope Ashcroft. I had professional publishers and intellectual property lawyers review it..."

Victoria's heart clenched.

Evelyn gestured for her to open it. "The clauses marked in red are problematic. For instance, this so-called publishing house is actually a studio controlled by Penelope..."

It didn't even have proper publishing credentials.

They could only produce merchandise and e-books, not legitimate publications.

No wonder Victoria hadn't released a new book in ten years.

It wasn't writer's block—Penelope simply couldn't publish her work!

Every creative idea had been rejected for this reason.

"If she couldn't publish, why sign you in the first place? And for a full decade?" William asked gravely.

Penelope had paid a one-time signing bonus of $200,000 back then.

A substantial sum ten years ago.

What was her motive if there were no profits to be made?

Evelyn pointed to the third page. "The second trap is here. She holds full copyright agency rights to all your published works... but where's the royalty percentage?"

William flipped through the pages. "Where are the appendices?"

"There aren't any."

This meant Penelope could arbitrarily decide the profit splits.

Victoria's voice trembled. "In these ten years, I've only received royalties five times..."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Both The Weapon and The Deserted School have remained in the top twenty bestsellers for a decade."

Victoria was stunned. "Penelope said the publishing industry was struggling..."

"The domestic market did face a downturn, but did she ever mention overseas sales?"
###Chapter 369

"Southeast Asia?"

"That's right. Both The Weapon and The Deserted School have made it into the top three on the bestseller lists for e-books and physical copies there."

Victoria Langley's fingers trembled slightly, causing her coffee cup to clink against the saucer. She had never imagined her works would cross oceans.

Evelyn Langley held up five fingers. "I've done a rough estimate. The earnings from these two books over the years amount to about..."

William Langley ventured a guess. "Five hundred thousand?"

"Be bolder."

"Five million?!"

"Fifty million," Evelyn said softly. "And that's a conservative estimate."

William's spoon clattered onto his porcelain plate.

"Mom," Evelyn took her mother's cold hand, "I know this is hard for you. But the ten-year contract with Penelope Ashcroft is over now."

Victoria's nails unconsciously traced tiny scratches along the rim of her cup.

"The real tragedy isn't the financial loss—it's all those good works that were buried. How many prime creative years does a writer really have?"

Victoria suddenly turned toward the window, her shoulders trembling slightly.

"I reached out to a senior editor. He read your unpublished manuscripts." Evelyn handed her a tissue. "Will you meet with him?"

Victoria took a deep breath, her throat working. "...Okay."

Late into the night, muffled sobs drifted from the guest bedroom. William's low, comforting words came in broken fragments.

Evelyn lay awake, watching the shifting light patterns on her ceiling until dawn tinged the sky.

Noon sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting diamond-shaped patterns on the wooden floor.

The café was nearly empty. A blue-eyed Ragdoll cat dozed by the register, ignoring the chime of the doorbell.

In a window booth, a man in a white dress shirt paged through a hardcover book. His sharp gaze, framed by black-rimmed glasses, immediately locked onto the trio entering.

"Ms. Langley." He stood quickly. "Simon Croix from DecaCulture Publishing."

Evelyn tactfully pulled her father back. "We'll wait outside."

Simon pulled out a wicker chair for Victoria, adjusting the cushion behind her. "Would you like to try our signature pour-over?"

Victoria shook her head, requesting only ice water. Her distant stare fixed on some point beyond the glass, as if all vitality had been drained from her.

A decade of trust had collapsed without warning, leaving no foothold for anger.

Simon slid a folder across the table. "We'd like to publish these four works from your Lantern series."

Victoria's pupils contracted sharply.

"Apologies if this seems abrupt." He adjusted his glasses. "But after reading the manuscripts your daughter sent, our editorial team made this decision overnight."

###Chapter 370

"I prepared countless speeches before meeting you." Simon Croix adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "But now, I only want to speak the truth."

Four manuscripts lay neatly on the table—all rejected by Penelope Ashcroft. Victoria Langley had stubbornly completed them anyway. For years, she'd dreamed nightly of seeing her mystery novels displayed prominently in bookstore windows again.

"If you agree, we'll initiate the publishing process within three days." Simon's fingers tapped lightly against the desk. "Your new book will hit shelves nationwide within two months."

He outlined the royalty percentages in detail. Even the advance payment made Victoria's pulse quicken. The contract terms were transparent, clearly meticulously prepared.

Victoria's fingers absently traced the rim of her teacup. From initial shock to this heavy silence, she felt trapped in some surreal dream.

"Simon..." she suddenly interrupted.

His fountain pen stilled on the paper, ink bleeding a small shadow.

"The terms are tempting." Victoria smiled bitterly. "But I need time."

A decade of betrayal had built walls around her. Penelope had arrived with contracts too, her smile brighter than sunlight.

The light in Simon's eyes dimmed. He slowly closed the folder and retrieved a gilded business card from his inner pocket.

"I understand." He slid the card toward her. "But remember—true gold always shines."

He produced a silver flash drive next. "The edited digital manuscripts. Four books totaling 870,000 words. Our editorial team pulled three all-nighters."

Victoria's head snapped up, her teacup clattering against the saucer.

"You're..." Her voice trembled. "Gambling on a possibility?"

"Publishing is always a gamble." Simon smiled. "But we only bet on truly great stories."

He stood, straightening his suit jacket. As he extended his hand, a well-worn wristwatch peeked from his cuff—clearly a longtime companion.

Victoria studied that hand. The palm lines were sharply defined, like crime scene traces from her novels.

Just as Simon began withdrawing, she suddenly asked, "All four books simultaneously?"

His hand froze midair. Behind his lenses, his eyes ignited.

"To resurrect an author dormant for ten years..." His voice tightened with excitement. "...requires an explosive comeback."
###Chapter 371

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, Evelyn Langley and William Langley sat in the café's garden patio. The glass partition revealed Victoria Langley and Simon Croix facing each other inside.

Victoria's expression shifted from initial bewilderment to solemnity, finally settling into visible remorse. The conversation clearly wasn't going smoothly.

Simon stood up to leave when Victoria suddenly said something.

He lit up like a candle flame, instantly radiant.

Resuming his seat, their discussion continued.

This time Victoria became more animated. Her previously wooden demeanor regained its vitality.

When they concluded, Simon extended his hand again. "Professor Langley, pleasure doing business."

Victoria didn't hesitate this time. She stood and shook his hand. "Thank you. Our discussion would've gone smoother if you'd shown me the proofread manuscript earlier."

Simon shook his head. "Words are sacred. They tell stories, convey emotions, celebrate beauty—but should never become tools for moral coercion."

Victoria sighed softly. "You're a good editor. Hopefully this time..."

She wouldn't repeat the same mistakes.

During the ride home, Evelyn couldn't resist asking, "Mom, what do you think of Simon?"

"Grounded. Sincere. Genuine."

"So you reached an agreement?"

"Yes. I'd nearly given up hope, but his authenticity moved me. Things can't possibly get worse than now—might as well take this chance."

Back home, Evelyn gasped while reviewing the contract details.

Victoria looked up. "What's wrong?"

William immediately leaned in. "Problem with the contract?"

Evelyn shook her head. Not only was the contract fair, it leaned favorably toward Victoria.

The crucial point—

This contract signed the author, not the book.

Simon had broken industry norms by directly contracting Victoria herself.

After explanations, William and Victoria finally relaxed.

Evelyn forwarded Simon's profile to Victoria—his resume, signed works, and bestselling IPs he'd developed.

After reviewing, Victoria murmured, "He's this accomplished?"

Evelyn simply said four words: "Top of the field."

The next day, DecaCulture Publishing transferred the advance to Victoria's account.

William counted the digits aloud. "Ones, tens, hundreds... Two million?!"

This only covered print royalties for four books. Future editions or derivative rights would bring additional percentages.

Victoria hadn't expected Simon to move so quickly—as if fearing she'd change her mind.

Evelyn gaped. "Mom, you're incredible!"

Victoria flushed slightly. "I never expected..."

Truthfully, she didn't believe herself worth that sum.

They'd agreed on one million, yet the amount doubled. Though Simon had mentioned fighting for better terms, the figure still shocked her.

Then Simon called.

"Professor Langley, received the payment?"

"Yes, but the amount—"

"One million is the agreed print royalty. The extra fifty thousand was my negotiation. The remaining fifty thousand is the mini-drama adaptation advance for The Lantern."

"Adaptation rights? Before publication?"

"Exactly. That's your influence."

Victoria never imagined she still held "influence" after all these years away.

Though Simon had mentioned it, she'd assumed it was politeness.

That night, Evelyn's bank account suddenly gained two million.

Seeing the balance alert, she froze momentarily before throwing off her blankets. Barefoot, she dashed to the adjacent bedroom—
###Chapter 372

"Mom, why did you suddenly transfer money to me?"

Evelyn Langley frowned at the bank notification on her phone screen.

Victoria Langley and William Langley exchanged knowing smiles. "Your father and I discussed it," Victoria said gently. "You contributed so much for the villa purchase. We couldn't help before, but now we finally can."

"I don't need the money."

"We know," Victoria patted her daughter's hand. "We're not giving it because you need it. We're living in that villa too—it's only right we contribute."

"But we're family."

"Exactly," Victoria blinked. "Then why are you keeping score?"

Evelyn fell silent.

"But—"

"No buts," William interrupted. "Listen to your mother. Would you refuse if we needed financial help later?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "...Of course not."

"Then it's settled. Oh, we have an early train tomorrow—you should rest."

"...I'll keep this money saved. Just tell me whenever you need it."

"Alright, go get some sleep."

Watching their daughter retreat to her room, Victoria sighed. "That girl will definitely overthink this."

William mused, "Actually, Evelyn probably isn't short on funds..."

He vaguely knew his daughter had substantial savings—though unclear of the exact amount, it definitely reached eight figures.

Victoria said firmly, "Her finances are hers. What we give, however small, is our parental love."

This wasn't about the sum.

"We couldn't provide her a nice home growing up. Now we're living in her villa—that's not something we take for granted."

William lowered his head. "I wasn't capable enough..."

"You still had your uses."

"Darling..." William's eyes grew moist.

"I couldn't have birthed Evelyn without you."

"?"

......

At 9 AM the next morning, Evelyn saw her parents off at the train station.

She watched until their figures disappeared into the crowd before turning away.

Arriving home, she nearly collided with Adrian Klein at her doorstep. The physicist held a stack of documents, finger poised at her doorbell.

"Professor." Evelyn quickened her steps up the final stairs.

Adrian looked up. "Is your father home?"

"They left this morning. Did you need him for something?"

"Just delivering printed copies of the research materials he requested." He waved the papers.

"Ah... they just departed..."

"No matter. I'll email you the digital version to forward to him."

"You shouldn't have gone to this trouble!"

"Not at all," Adrian's lips curved slightly. "Your father is... unique."

The man's insistence on addressing him as "brother" was particularly memorable.

......

After her parents' departure, Evelyn's life regained its quiet rhythm.

Her days flowed between home and the library.

Time passed like water—soon it was September, and graduate school began anew...
###Chapter 373

At six in the morning, Evelyn Langley opened her eyes.

She washed up efficiently and straightened her collar in the mirror. Today was graduate school orientation, so she’d deliberately chosen a light blue shirt—professional and polished.

A line had already formed outside the registrar’s office.

After verifying her documents, Evelyn hurried to the department office. Sunlight streamed through the windows, making her squint.

"All settled?" her advisor asked, handing her a class schedule.

"Yes." Evelyn nodded. "The opening ceremony isn’t until tomorrow."

She checked her watch—only ten in the morning. The perk of not living on campus meant no luggage to haul, leaving her afternoon unexpectedly free.

The hallway of the Informatics building was quiet.

Gregory Hill was grading papers when a knock made him look up, his glasses nearly sliding off. "Evelyn?" He stood in surprise. "What a rare visit!"

"Just checking in," she said with a smile. "Wouldn’t want someone accusing me of being ungrateful."

"Nonsense!" He feigned sternness before faltering. "I was just... making full use of academic resources!" he muttered, adjusting his glasses.

They chatted for half an hour before Evelyn’s phone buzzed.

"Professor Roland?" She answered to a warm female voice.

Gregory rolled his eyes. "Knew it was her," he grumbled under his breath. "Like a mother hen."

Eleanor Roland’s office door was slightly ajar.

Evelyn was about to push it open when she heard voices inside. She withdrew her hand and knocked three times.

"Come in." Eleanor beckoned. "Perfect timing—meet your labmates."

Two people were already seated inside. A lanky boy in a black sweater, his pale skin accentuated by the dark fabric, was flipping through notes. A round-faced girl beamed the moment Evelyn entered.

"Liam Kalmien, Hannah Flores," Eleanor introduced. "This is Evelyn Langley."

After brief greetings, Eleanor sighed. "There’s something you should know." She rubbed her temples. "I’ve requested to stop taking new students."

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

"You three will be the last group I mentor." Eleanor’s gaze lingered on Evelyn for an extra second.

A ringing phone shattered the silence.

After Eleanor stepped out, the office was so quiet they could hear the hum of the AC.

"Cookie?" Hannah suddenly produced a tin. "Homemade."

Evelyn took one. "Thanks." She took a bite. "You’re from Guangdong?"

"Wow!" Hannah’s eyes widened. "How’d you know?"

Evelyn blinked. "Lucky guess?"

"You’re amazing, Evelyn!" Hannah gushed.

Liam, who’d been silent, finally looked up. "I guessed too."

Hannah’s cookie clattered onto the table.
###Chapter 374

Evelyn took a bite of the cookie.

"How is it?" Hannah blinked eagerly, her face full of anticipation.

"Not bad. The sweetness is just right." Evelyn nodded.

"I tried every brand in the supermarket before picking this one!" Hannah turned excitedly to Liam. "Want to try?"

"No." Liam adjusted his glasses. "I'm cutting back on carbs."

Before he finished speaking, Hannah's hand froze mid-air, still holding the cookie.

Evelyn immediately reached out. "Give me another one."

Hannah scooted closer, pouting. "You're the best, Evelyn."

Liam looked baffled.

The entire pack was gone in minutes. Evelyn only had three pieces—the rest disappeared into Hannah's stomach.

Prof. Eleanor returned with their documents. "It's 5:30. Cafeteria?"

...

They chose a private dining room on the fifth floor.

Evelyn flipped through the menu. "Sweet and sour ribs for Hannah, boiled fish for Prof. Eleanor..."

Hannah's eyes sparkled with gratitude.

Liam remained silent throughout, so Evelyn simply ordered stir-fried seasonal vegetables for him.

Once the four dishes and soup arrived, Prof. Eleanor paid with her card.

As they stepped out, they nearly collided with Prof. Beatrice, who was surrounded by five students.

"Prof. Roland," Beatrice smiled brightly. "I heard you're suspending graduate admissions this year?"

Eleanor nodded impassively.

"What a shame." Beatrice's gaze swept over Evelyn's group. "I've taken five new students this year. Audrey, Zachary, Shane, Isabella, Sophia—come say hello."

Hannah suddenly gasped.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn whispered.
###Chapter 375

"This Audrey... she's interesting," Hannah murmured under her breath.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"The freshman group chat won't stop talking about her." Hannah pulled out her phone. "Six SCI papers. Admitted as a special exception—the prodigy."

Shane suddenly leaned in. "Well, if it isn't the illustrious Professor Roland!" He gave an exaggerated bow, his tone dripping with mockery.

Hannah rolled her eyes. "This guy never shuts up in the group chat. Always making snide remarks."

Professor Merouin cleared her throat. "What are you all standing around for? Greet your professor properly."

Audrey crossed her arms, not even bothering to look up.

Sophia offered a gentle curtsy. "Good afternoon, Professor."

Isabella shrank into the back, twisting the hem of her shirt between her fingers. The memory of those expensive tonics she'd sent made her cheeks burn.

Zachary suddenly lunged forward, seizing Professor Roland's hand. "Professor! I'm Zachary Omelas!" His words tumbled out in an excited rush. "I've read every single one of your papers!"

The nearly six-foot-tall boy wore a faded T-shirt and sandals with frayed edges. His sun-darkened face flushed crimson, like a child meeting their idol.

Shane yanked him back. "Country bumpkin! You're embarrassing yourself!"

But Zachary just kept grinning, oblivious to the insult.

Professor Merouin's face turned ashen. She forced a smile. "Professor Roland, won't you introduce your students?"

"Unnecessary," Eleanor replied coldly.

Shane immediately jumped in. "Or is it because you have no students worth introducing?"

Hannah trembled with anger. "You—"

"Who let you out looking like that?" Shane raked his eyes over her with malicious glee. "Fat pig."

Evelyn stepped in front of Hannah, shielding her. "Professor Merouin, your students are truly... remarkable." Her laugh was icy. "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."
###Chapter 376

"So you're the one who got into grad school at thirty?" Beatrice Merouin finally looked Evelyn Langley up and down, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "You talk a good game. Let's see if your research skills match that mouth of yours."

Shane Evlanch immediately chimed in. "Who even goes to grad school at that age? Either you're mentally challenged or just not bright enough. Have academic standards fallen this low?"

Evelyn remained unfazed. "My IQ is none of your concern. But you—clearly need medical attention."

Liam Kalmien, who had been silent until now, spoke up. "Late-stage rabies. Bites everyone in sight."

He turned to Beatrice. "If it were me, I'd have put down a rabid dog like that long ago. Before it turns on its owner."

A chill ran down Beatrice's spine.

Shane jumped to his feet. "Who are you calling a dog?! Your whole family are dogs!"

Evelyn replied coolly, "The loudest barkers get called out first. Professor, let's go. No point engaging with roadblocks."

Eleanor Roland, who had been trembling with anger, suddenly calmed at these words.

"Agreed."

As the four turned to leave, Beatrice raised her voice. "This year's research funding has been approved. Those who haven't produced decent results in three years should step aside and let real talent take the resources."

Eleanor paused mid-step.

Beatrice continued, "Academic resources should go to cutting-edge work, not fund outdated has-beens. Don't you agree, Professor Roland?"

Evelyn turned back, her gaze sharp. "Resource allocation isn't your call. Research output will prove who deserves it."

"Well said!" Beatrice clapped sarcastically. "I look forward to seeing your groundbreaking results."

......

On the day of the opening ceremony, Evelyn and her two companions sat with the School of Life Sciences contingent. The dean's long-winded speech was putting everyone to sleep.

A commotion broke out in the back rows.

"Was that Victor Dimucci who just walked by?"
"It has to be him!"
"Isn't he supposed to be busy with lab work? Why would he come to the opening ceremony?"
"He's 'SCI incarnate.' Does whatever he wants."
"What's SCI?"
"You don't know? Victor published three SCI papers as an undergrad. Now he drops major publications every year. Even the dean treats him with respect."

Evelyn frowned slightly. This was already the second time she'd heard Victor's name.
###Chapter 377

September sunlight streamed through the classroom windows as Evelyn Langley opened her brand-new notebook. Her graduate course schedule was packed from dawn till noon, leaving barely any breathing room.

"Whew—almost late!"

The door burst open as Hannah Flores rushed in, out of breath. She wore baggy shorts and bright yellow Crocs that slapped loudly against the floor.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to her feet. "Hannah, you—"

"What?" Hannah glanced down. "Oh, the shoes? I bought them specially for the first day!"

Liam Kalmien looked up from his textbook. "You call that appropriate?"

"Of course!" Hannah retorted. "Where I'm from, this is considered perfectly presentable."

Liam shook his head and returned to his reading.

When the bell rang, the three headed to the cafeteria together. Hannah chattered nonstop like an excited songbird.

"Evelyn, I found this amazing Sichuan place right across from your apartment!" She gestured enthusiastically. "Their boiled fish—"

A bouquet of vibrant yellow roses suddenly appeared before them.

Nathan Evans stood there in a tailored suit, his tie loosely draped around his neck. With a slight bow, he offered the flowers to Evelyn. "Happy first day."

Hannah immediately yanked Liam's sleeve to pull him back.

"What?" Liam frowned.

"Can't you see he's making a move?" Hannah hissed. "Don't be a third wheel!"

Evelyn took a step back. "Mr. Evans, please maintain some decorum."

"Just flowers," Nathan said with a wry smile. "Won't you spare me this small courtesy?"

"We're over." Her voice remained calm.

A crowd of curious students began gathering around them. Whispers rippled through the hall:

"Isn't that the Evans Group heir?"
"Who's that girl? She's gorgeous!"
"Must be the new grad student..."

Nathan stood frozen, the yellow roses glaringly bright under the sunlight.
###Chapter 378

"Look, isn't that the older grad student from our department?"

Audrey Escent suddenly stopped walking.

Sophia Frackett stumbled as she was pulled along, following Audrey's gaze.

Under the sunlight, a tall, well-built man stood holding yellow roses, offering them intently to Evelyn Langley.

Audrey curled her lip. "Pretty girls have all the luck. School just started and she's already got suitors."

"Sophia, you're not bad either. How come no one sends you flowers?"

Sophia's lips curved slightly. "Is this really something to compare?"

"Stop acting so aloof!" Audrey sneered. "I don't believe you're not jealous."

Sophia's smile remained unchanged.

Audrey tossed over her shoulder, "Fake it too much and it becomes obvious," before striding away.

Sophia stood still, her smile gradually freezing.

Nearby, two male students were conversing.

Victor Dimucci adjusted his glasses. "...Did you remember all these precautions?"

Zachary Omelas scratched his head, then suddenly widened his eyes. "Senior, look!"

Victor turned and saw the flower-giving scene, his brow furrowing. "If you want academic success, don't get distracted by such things."

"...Got it, senior!" Zachary nodded earnestly.

"That girl is Professor Eleanor Roland's student," he added. "Really impressive."

Daring to challenge Professor Beatrice Merouin in class and making Shane Evlanch lose face.

So cool!

Victor showed no interest, barely glancing before looking away.

"Let's go. I'll take you to buy daily necessities."

Zachary hastily waved his hands. "No need, I brought everything."

Victor sighed. "You mean the toothbrush with no bristles left, or the towel full of holes?"

Zachary's dark face flushed red. "I...I think they're still usable..."

New things cost money.

Victor saw his younger self in Zachary.

They came from the same mountain village, though Victor had entered Harvard earlier.

Zachary only got into a regular 211 university for undergrad and took two tries to get into grad school.

As fellow villagers, Victor always wanted to look out for him.

In this cold city, warmth was a luxury for rural kids like them.

"My treat."

"Really not necessary," Zachary blurted in dialect, "Ma and Pa gave me money."

Victor said nothing, heading straight for the supermarket.

Roses, confessions—none of that concerned them.

A casual bouquet to some was half a month's living expenses for them.

The world was never fair.

......

Evelyn sidestepped the yellow roses. "I have class."

Without looking back, she walked toward Hannah Flores and Liam Kalmien.

Nathan Evans stood holding the flowers, a bitter smile forming on his lips.

Only when the crowd dispersed did he snap out of it.

The yellow roses were tossed into a trash can, stained with grime.

He turned and left.

Under the shade of a tree, Sophia watched Nathan's retreating figure pensively before gathering her books and departing.
###Chapter 379

Evelyn Langley met Hannah Flores and Liam Kalmien at the campus gate, and the trio headed straight to the newly opened trendy restaurant.

It was peak lunch hour, and a long line snaked outside. They waited twenty minutes before getting a table.

The moment they sat down, Hannah leaned in eagerly. "Evelyn, who was that handsome guy giving you flowers earlier? That bouquet had at least ninety-nine yellow roses!"

Evelyn took a sip of water. "My ex."

"What?" Hannah nearly choked on her own saliva and quickly buried her face in the menu.

Liam gave Evelyn a thoughtful glance.

After lunch, they went to Professor Eleanor Roland's office.

Hannah's eyes widened when she heard they'd be entering the lab that afternoon. "Already? We're just freshmen!"

Though Liam appeared calm, his grip on his pen tightened slightly.

Evelyn stayed silent. She knew better than anyone how long their advisor's research had stalled—every minute counted now.

By the time they left the lab, night had long since fallen.

Exhausted, Evelyn dragged herself home. Too tired to even turn on the lights, she collapsed onto the sofa.

Knock, knock, knock—sudden rapping at the door.

She forced herself up and opened it to find Adrian Klein standing outside, his briefcase in hand. He looked like he'd just gotten off work too.

"I heard Eleanor took you into the lab today?"

"Yeah."

"Worked until now?"

"Yeah."

"Did you eat?"

Evelyn shook her head weakly.

Adrian chuckled. "Wait here."

He disappeared into his apartment across the hall and returned moments later with a thermal lunchbox.

"Eat while it's hot."

Evelyn hesitated. "This is...?"

"From my family. I already ate."

Only then did she accept it. When she lifted the lid, the aroma hit her instantly.

The top layer held glistening white rice. Beneath it lay neatly arranged sweet-and-sour ribs, braised pork, and steamed fish. The bottom compartment contained seasonal vegetables and mushroom soup.

Back at the Klein family estate, Beatrice Merouin paced restlessly in the living room.

George Klein set down his newspaper. "What's got you so worked up this late?"

"Your son, that's what!" Beatrice huffed, sitting only to stand again. "Made me prepare dinner for two, then packed it all up without taking a single bite!"
###Chapter 380

"Who else could it be but the third one?" Beatrice Merouin said decisively.

"Adrian?" Julian Roscente raised an eyebrow. Their youngest son had never given them any trouble, disciplined to the point of being rigid.

At every gathering with friends, others would complain about their sons' shortcomings while he simply smiled without comment.

The eldest had taken over the family business. The second was thriving at his law firm. And the youngest had already won prestigious scientific awards despite his youth.

"What happened when you visited Adrian today?"

Beatrice frowned deeply. "Something's off about him."

"How so?"

"He actually ordered two meals!" Her voice rose sharply. "Two!"

Julian looked baffled. "What's the problem?"

"I think he has a girlfriend!"

Julian nearly laughed. "That's all? Maybe he was just hungry or getting food for a colleague."

He steeped his tea with deliberate elegance, movements unhurried.

"You know Adrian's personality. It's either the lab or data—he even considers coming home for meals a waste of time. Where would a girlfriend fit in?"

"Besides, he's twenty-eight. Isn't dating a good thing? Weren't you arranging blind dates for him before?"

Beatrice knew her husband was right, but the thought of her son possibly hiding a relationship made her restless.

"I'm going to bed." She stood abruptly.

Julian was surprised. "No evening walk today?"

"Conserving energy." She headed upstairs without looking back.

Tomorrow, she would storm her son's apartment for answers.

———

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Evelyn Langley woke before her alarm, stretching as she got up to wash.

The sweet aroma of congee filled the kitchen from the timed cooker. She ate quickly, cleaned up, and prepared to leave.

On the fourth-floor landing, a startled cry echoed from below. Peering down, she saw an elegantly dressed woman sprawled awkwardly in a pile of garbage.

Residents on the third floor habitually left trash in the stairwell, creating a foul stench.

"Are you alright?" Evelyn hurried down to help her up.

"Thank you—" Beatrice looked up, then froze.

She remembered this face all too well.

The tea master who'd publicly criticized her brewing skills at that tea appreciation gathering.

Beatrice wasn't one to hold grudges, but something about this girl rubbed her the wrong way.

Maybe it was that ostentatious cheongsam.

Or how close she'd been to Eleanor Roland.

Whatever the reason, they simply didn't mix.

Evelyn recognized the society matron too and withdrew her hand politely. "You're welcome."

Beatrice inexplicably bristled at the retreat.

"Why do you live here?" The question slipped out.

"I rent here." Evelyn answered calmly.
###Chapter 381

Beatrice Merouin frowned as she surveyed her surroundings, her stilettos clicking sharply against the cracked concrete floor.

"Not even a single light in this stairwell?" She kicked aside an empty soda can with disdain. "And these walls are covered in flyers. Does the property management even exist?"

Evelyn Langley glanced at her wristwatch. Only fifteen minutes left before class.

She turned and walked away without a word of goodbye.

Beatrice stared at the retreating figure, stomping her foot in frustration.

The rapid staccato of her heels echoed through the stairwell.

"Seventh floor... I have to climb seven flights..." She gasped for breath, gripping the peeling handrail. "Adrian Klein, have you lost your mind?"

The key scraped harshly against the lock.

The living room was immaculate, with several academic journals neatly arranged on the coffee table.

Beatrice bent to inspect the sofa crevices—not a single strand of hair in sight.

A lone insulated lunchbox sat in the glass kitchen cabinet.

"One's missing." Her lips curled into a cold smile. "How impressive, Adrian."

The crystal chandelier in the Klein family mansion cast dizzying reflections.

"I knew something was off!" Beatrice hurled her purse onto the leather couch.

Gregory Hill turned a newspaper page leisurely. "Evidence?"

"The lunchbox is gone! He never used to pack meals, now suddenly he does it every day—"

"Perhaps it broke."

"Your son breaking things?" She yanked off her pearl necklace. "He hasn't shattered a single cup since he was five!"

Gregory adjusted his reading glasses. "Nathan made the gossip columns again yesterday."

"That playboy can do as he pleases." Beatrice snatched the remote to mute the financial news. "Adrian is different. He—"

"He's twenty-eight, not eight."

"That's exactly why it's dangerous!" Her voice dropped suddenly. "What if it's someone from that lab—"

Streetlights stretched two shadows long across the pavement.

Evelyn rounded the corner, arms laden with a thick Molecular Biology textbook.

A man in black athletic wear was entering the passcode at the building entrance.

"Professor Klein." She quickened her pace.

Adrian turned, the faint scent of pinewood drifting with his movement.

"Late night." His gaze flickered to the book in her arms.

"Research at the library."

The motion-activated hallway light flickered on the seventh floor.

Evelyn stood on tiptoe to retrieve a lunchbox from the wall cabinet. "Washed it three times. Should be odor-free now."

The metal container gleamed coldly under the light.

"Eleanor's research project." Adrian spoke abruptly. "Hit a roadblock?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched.
###Chapter 382

"I've spoken with her several times, but she's too stubborn." Adrian Klein adjusted his glasses. "You know Professor Roland—she won't back down until she hits a wall."

Evelyn Langley had already sensed the issue.

She'd tactfully suggested changes to Professor Eleanor Roland before, only to be dismissed with "insufficient data." The professor insisted altering their research direction now would waste two years of effort.

"Are you free this Saturday? We should discuss how to convince her in person."

"Saturday..." Evelyn bit her lower lip. "Sorry, I already have plans."

Adrian blinked in surprise. "No problem. We'll reschedule."

"Okay."

......

At dawn on Saturday, Evelyn met Hannah Flores outside Liam Kalmien's apartment building.

The concierge had been notified in advance and granted them entry after verifying their identities.

Her phone buzzed with Liam's message: [Come straight up]

Evelyn gazed up at the luxury high-rise, sunlight glaring off its glass facade.

"Wow, Liam's full of surprises," Hannah remarked, impressed.

This penthouse in the city center was registered under Liam's name—they'd seen the ownership details during check-in.

"Come in. There are new slippers in the closet."

The smart lock disengaged as the elevator doors opened on the twelfth floor. Liam stood at the entrance in loungewear, his tone neutral.

"What would you like to drink?"

Hannah's eyes lit up. "Got any Coke?"

"Diet or regular?"

"Regular, obviously! Diet tastes like dishwater!"

Liam didn't respond, turning to Evelyn instead. "And you?"

"Room temperature water."

She'd never been particular about beverages.

After changing into slippers, Evelyn surveyed the space. The apartment's minimalist decor—monochrome with cool undertones—mirrored Liam's own detached demeanor.

Hannah explored like an excited child, pausing at a display case. "What's this? Art?"

She pointed at an unusual skeletal specimen.

"Decoration." Liam didn't look up.

"So unique! Where'd you get it? Link please!"

"Can't buy it."

"Why not?"

"Real human bones."

"!!"

Hannah recoiled three meters instantly.

The corner of Liam's mouth twitched. "Kidding. I'll send you the link later."

Hannah glared.

This guy was absolutely insane. Certifiably.

Evelyn had already opened her laptop. "Three datasets aren't huge, but not trivial either. Let's get started."

"Right." They all focused immediately.

Their efficiency surpassed expectations.

Liam performed as anticipated—flawless professionalism with encyclopedic knowledge.

What truly surprised Evelyn was Hannah.

Though her theoretical foundation wasn't as solid as Liam's, the girl possessed photographic memory and razor-sharp thinking.

Hannah: "..."

Was that a compliment or an insult?
###Chapter 383

"Done!" Hannah Flores snapped her laptop shut and stretched with a satisfied sigh.

Seven empty soda cans littered the desk.

Liam Kalmien grabbed his jacket. "Let's go. Dinner's on me."

Evelyn Langley exchanged amused glances with Hannah. Neither hesitated.

With their long-term collaboration ahead, there'd be plenty of opportunities to return the favor.

At the French restaurant—

Crystal chandeliers scattered prismatic light as a violinist played "Wedding in a Dream."

"Do you have a reservation?"

"Under Kalmien. Booked last night."

Liam showed the confirmation code on his phone.

The waiter bowed and led them to a window table.

Evelyn scanned the menu. She'd been here before with clients—this Michelin three-star cost half a month's salary for the average office worker.

Hannah ran her fingers over the gilded cutlery, then suddenly pulled out her phone to photograph the bread basket.

"For my dad," she explained sheepishly. "He always says city folks eat fancy."

Liam's gaze flickered.

Her family situation seemed...

"What does your father do?" he asked casually.

Hannah paused mid-filter adjustment.

That hesitation made the other two tense.

"Mom stays home with my brother. Dad..." She scratched her head. "Watches warehouses in our fishing village. Does some fishing when there's time."

A rundown village. Left-behind family. Surviving on odd jobs—

Evelyn clenched her napkin. Raising such a bright daughter in those circumstances spoke volumes.

"I'll bring you fresh shrimp next time!" Hannah suddenly leaned in. "Dad catches mantis shrimp that dance!"

Liam's Adam's apple bobbed. "Order anything tonight."

"Really?" Hannah's hand shot up. "Waiter! Three tomahawk steaks!"

She clarified: "Three per person."

Liam's fork clattered onto his plate.

When the dessert cart arrived, Evelyn silently pushed her mousse toward Hannah.

"You're not having any?" Hannah already had a heaping spoonful.

Liam added his sugar-dusted pancake to the offering. "Slow down. Don't choke."

"Mmmph..." The girl's cheeks bulged like a chipmunk's, her eyes crinkling into crescents.
###Chapter 384

"Order more if you want." Liam Kalmien slid the menu toward Hannah Flores.

Hannah's eyes curved into crescents. "What do your parents do?"

"My father teaches. My mother writes." Evelyn Langley picked up a piece of fish.

"Oh my! A writer mom!"
Hannah's exclamation drew glances from nearby tables. She cupped her face, starry-eyed. "So impressive..."

Her overly eager gaze made Evelyn and Liam simultaneously set down their chopsticks.

"And you?" Hannah turned to Liam.

For once, he didn't object to the saccharine address. "Civil servant."

"How nice..." Hannah murmured, fingers absently tracing the tablecloth.

As they paid, commotion erupted at the entrance.

Shane Evlanch swaggered in with Audrey Escent's group—noticeably missing Isabella Evans. This budget eatery clearly didn't meet the Evans heiress's standards.

"Well, if it isn't Professor Roland's prized students." Shane spread his arms theatrically. "Couldn't your advisor afford better?"

Silence.

His smile froze. "Our team's dining on departmental funds—Professor Xu's special budget." He raised his voice. "The faculty allocated 80% resources to us this year. Doubt some can even scrape together lab equipment."

Zachary Omelas tugged his sleeve. "Don't—"

"Back off!" Shane jerked away. "Don't touch me, country bumpkin!"

Zachary paled, lips trembling. "We're...classmates—"

"You think you're my equal?" Shane sneered. "I could have you kicked out of the lab."

Zachary clenched his fists. He remembered Victor Dimucci's advice: Endure for peace. But some humiliations cut too deep.

"Enough." Audrey frowned.

Sophia Frackett added pointedly, "Victor hates team discord."

At Victor's name, Shane deflated slightly.

"Want to transfer?" He turned to Evelyn's group with condescension. "Though you're mediocre—"

"Indeed unworthy." Evelyn cut in. "Of your team."

Shane's face darkened.

"Department-funded meals violate University Regulation 37." Liam adjusted his glasses.

Hannah already had her phone recording. "Care to repeat whose budget this is? Professor Xu?"
###Chapter 385

Shane Evlanch's face darkened instantly. "What are you photographing? I'll call the police!"

Hannah Flores waved her phone. "Filming in public isn't illegal. I'm a law-abiding citizen."

Shane turned livid with rage.

Audrey Escent frowned impatiently. "Shane, what's wrong with you?"

"What?"

"We're splitting the bill equally for this meal. Stop pretending to be generous. Finish up and let's get back to campus!"

Shane shot Evelyn Langley's group a resentful glare before storming off.

Zachary Omelas remained rooted in place. Dutch treat...

"I just remembered something urgent. I have to go!"

He sprinted away before anyone could respond.

Shane sneered. "Cheapskate! Probably couldn't stomach paying his share."

Audrey shrugged. "Forget about him."

Outside the restaurant, Evelyn's ride arrived.

Hannah and Liam Kalmien climbed in first.

As Evelyn reached for the passenger door, she glimpsed a familiar figure in her periphery.

After a brief hesitation, she approached. "Zachary?"

A tall male student emerged from the shadows, scratching his head awkwardly. "Y-yeah."

"We're heading back to campus. Want to join us?"

"Really?" Zachary's eyes brightened before dimming with uncertainty.

The restaurant was too far from school—their initial ride had cost over twenty dollars.

He'd planned to take the bus, but the last one had already departed.

No drivers were accepting his carpool request on the ride-sharing app. Just as he considered canceling, Evelyn appeared.

"It's on our way."

"Thank you so much!"

Zachary's height forced Evelyn to offer him the front seat.

The driver eyed him. "Son, with your build, my car feels cramped."

Zachary flashed an embarrassed grin, revealing a row of white teeth.

Fifteen minutes later, they arrived at the university gates.

After exiting, Zachary noticed the others hadn't moved. "We're here. Aren't you getting out?"

Evelyn shook her head. "We live off-campus."

"Oh..." He rubbed his neck. "Thanks again for today."

Suddenly, he pulled something from his pocket, shoved it through the window, and bolted.

Evelyn looked down.

A twenty-dollar bill.

Cash transactions had become rare these days.

Liam glanced at it. "Painfully earnest."

The total fare was twenty-five—just over six dollars per person.

Because they weren't campus residents, Zachary had insisted on paying twenty.

Hannah sighed. "Too bad he chose the wrong advisor. Why pick Beatrice Merouin?"

Liam shrugged. "Victor Dimucci's his hometown friend. Naturally, he'd choose Beatrice."

"How do you know that?"

"Victor came looking for him during orientation."

"I see..."

Someone as guileless as Zachary was truly uncommon nowadays.

......

At the alleyway, Evelyn exited the car.

The moon cast a cold glow over sparse stars.

Summer night air carried oppressive heat.

Her steps faltered abruptly.

Beneath the apartment's entryway, a man leaned lazily against a tree. The moment he spotted her, his posture snapped upright.
###Chapter 386

"Surprised to see me?" Ethan Winston stood under the streetlamp, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Evelyn Langley blinked. "...A little."

"How's the new semester treating you?"

"Fine."

"Busy schedule?"

The question hit a nerve. Busy was an understatement—she barely had time to breathe!

Ethan chuckled. "Your face just gave me the answer."

"...That obvious?" She instinctively touched her cheek.

"Not at all."

"Then how did you know?"

His eyes glimmered. "I'm observant."

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

"It's sweltering out here, and I know you won't invite me upstairs." He paused. "How about somewhere cooler?"

At least he knew his place.

"You're definitely thinking, 'This man has some self-awareness.'"

Evelyn: "!"

"Guessed right again?"

"..."

They entered a bubble tea shop on the corner. The blast of AC instantly relieved the summer night's humidity.

But Ethan's crisp suit clashed with the shop's pastel decor, drawing curious glances.

Evelyn: "What'll you have? My treat."

"Oreo milk tea. No ice. Full sugar."

"?"

He raised a brow. "Problem?"

She turned to the counter. "Two Oreo milk teas. No ice. Full sugar."

A low laugh followed. "Same taste? Could this be...kindred spirits?"

"Coincidence."

Ethan's lips curved.

Coincidences were rare. Over the years, he'd memorized her preferences better than anyone.

Their drinks arrived quickly. They settled in a corner booth.

Evelyn cut to the chase. "Why are you here?"

"Can't I just want to see you?"

She pursed her lips. "...You wouldn't."

Ethan wasn't the type for casual chats. He wouldn't show up unannounced at her doorstep—not at this hour.

Even if...he genuinely missed her, he'd always have a plausible excuse.

"So who would drop by uninvited?" His gaze sharpened.

Evelyn: "..." Was that the point?

"Has Nathan Evans visited recently?"

She stirred her straw absently.

Ethan pressed on. "Let me guess—he came. During the day."

"..."

"With flowers?"

"..."

"You're at Harvard all day, so he..." Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Went to campus?"

Bullseye.

Evelyn burst out laughing. "With skills like that, why not set up a fortune-telling booth?"

"Only interested in your fortunes."

She asked offhandedly, "Then what does interest you?"
###Chapter 387

The words barely left Evelyn Langley's lips when she wished she could bite her tongue off.

Too late to take them back.

Ethan Winston chuckled. "You."

"I'm interested in you."

Evelyn immediately tilted her head up to study the ceiling patterns.

The man arched an eyebrow. "Stop pretending. I know you heard me."

"The wind's too loud. Couldn't catch that." She cleared her throat awkwardly. "Let's never mention this again."

Watching her play dumb only deepened Ethan's amusement. "You can run today, but not forever."

"Oh no," Evelyn abruptly interrupted, "I forgot tissues. Do you have any?"

"Here."

"Thanks."

Ethan dangled the packet teasingly. "Hear me better now?"

Evelyn glared in silence.

Her suspicion was right—Ethan had an ulterior motive.

Only after finishing his milk tea did he get to the point.

"Professor Hill's research has hit a two-month roadblock. Wanted your input. All materials are here."

He slid a flash drive across the table.

During the handoff, he deliberately slowed his movements.

When their fingers brushed, the heat from his palm sent an electric jolt through her.

Evelyn snatched her hand back.

Ethan's grin turned downright predatory.

Absolutely intentional!

She widened her eyes in accusation, but he smoothly offered tissues—

"Wipe your hands."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Her anger flared and faded just as fast.

Making a scene would seem childish now.

But why did only his touch unsettle her?

The realization startled her.

Didn't that prove he'd already become someone special in her mind?

A no-win situation!

Outside the tea shop, Ethan insisted on walking her to her building.

At the doorstep, Evelyn suddenly declared, "You're too calculating. Let's keep our distance!"

Instead of taking offense, he laughed. "You're scared."

"Of what?" She frowned.

"That you'll unknowingly surrender your heart to me." He preened like a peacock.

Evelyn nearly choked. "I'm avoiding your traps!"

"Same destination, different paths."

Evelyn blinked.

How was that equivalent?

"Can't out-argue you. I concede."

She spun around and dashed into the stairwell.

Ethan remained rooted, watching until her silhouette disappeared around the corner.

He waited longer still, only leaving after her window lights flickered on.

Post-shower, Evelyn plugged the flash drive into her laptop.

As the loading bar progressed, she froze—

Professor Hill had class tomorrow. He could've simply handed her the materials on campus.

Why send Ethan on this special trip?

Another scheme!

Meanwhile, Ethan answered his ringing phone.

"Professor?"

"My flash drive? It was definitely in the drawer—"

"I took it."

"Those are research documents! I need to give them to Evelyn tomorrow—"

"Already delivered."
###Chapter 388

"...Huh?" Gregory Hill blinked in confusion.

"Who delivered it? When? How come I didn't know?"

"I happened to be at Harvard today and heard you wanted to give the flash drive to Evelyn Langley, so I dropped it off on my way."

"I see... You should've told me earlier. I've been searching everywhere..."

Ethan Winston smirked inwardly. If he'd given advance notice, there'd be no element of surprise.

Aloud, he said, "It was a last-minute decision. Sorry for forgetting to mention it."

"Fine. As long as it's delivered."

"Mm."

Hanging up, the man gripped the steering wheel, his lips curving upward unbidden.

......

In his study, Adrian Klein was organizing experimental data.

But his focus kept slipping.

The scene he'd witnessed two hours ago from his balcony replayed relentlessly—

Ethan walking with her from the alleyway.

The man murmuring something that made Evelyn first frown, then roll her eyes in exasperation before turning to dash away.

Ethan standing motionless, watching her retreating figure with tenderness pooling in his gaze.

Under the amber streetlights, their shadows had intertwined.

They'd looked...perfect together.

So...the person she'd been meeting was Ethan?

Adrian snapped back to reality, realizing the data on his screen had become a jumbled mess.

Where had he left off?

Which row was he supposed to check next?

In the end, he had to start over completely.

At 3 AM, the study light still burned.

Exhausted, Adrian shut his laptop—the data remained incomplete.

Tomorrow, then.

After a quick wash, he collapsed into bed but tossed restlessly, sleep eluding him entirely.

Adrian Klein tossed and turned, finally falling into a fitful sleep at 3 AM.

His dreams galloped like wild horses, careening into absurd territories.

Everything was shrouded in a hazy mist, indistinct and blurred.

A slender figure emerged from the fog, each step landing directly on his pounding heart.

He yanked at his tie in frustration, popping two shirt buttons as his Adam's apple bobbed.

An internal fire scorched his veins, leaving his mouth parched.

That indescribable craving set his entire body aflame.

Compelled by instinct, he reached for the figure, grasping her delicate hand.

His fingertips traced the smooth curve of her arm before ascending to her slender neck.

Skin contact hit him like an oasis to a desert wanderer.

When his lips cautiously met hers, a soft gasp ignited the fuse of his long-suppressed desire.

As the woman turned, recognition struck like lightning—

Evelyn Langley.

Adrian jolted awake to the first gray light of dawn.

His gaze dropped to the damp pajama pants. A fist slammed into the headboard.

Shame crashed over him in waves.

He'd fantasized about his own student.

Cold shower spray failed to rinse the images from his mind as he stood under the icy deluge.

......

Evelyn stretched as sunlight painted gold stripes across her bed.

Humming, she dressed in a sky-blue sundress and bounced out the door.

Morning classes flew by in a blur.

At lunch, Liam Kalmien leaned in conspiratorially. "Professor Roland's back in the lab."

Hannah Flores nibbled her straw. "Wasn't she at the symposium?"

"Returned early." Liam dropped his voice. "Rumor says she's got breakthrough data."

Evelyn's eyes sparkled.

That afternoon, Professor Eleanor Roland indeed calibrated equipment in the lab.

Evelyn steadied her breathing before approaching. "Professor, may I have a moment?"

Behind her glasses, Eleanor's eyes flickered with surprise.

"Certainly." She powered down the device. "Let's talk in my office."
###Chapter 389

Evelyn followed Professor Eleanor Roland into the innermost operating room of the laboratory.

She pulled out a folder and slapped it onto the workbench. "Professor, there's a fundamental flaw in our research direction."

Eleanor opened her mouth to speak, but Evelyn had already flipped open the file. "We pulled an all-nighter this weekend to review the entire project."

"From the initial proposal to experimental design, from preliminary data to interim conclusions—we reanalyzed everything." She looked up, meeting her mentor's gaze. "The delay in Phase Three results isn't due to experimental errors. The entire premise is flawed."

Hannah Flores and Liam Kalmien had both spotted this fatal flaw, but neither dared to speak up.

Only Evelyn had the courage.

Eleanor silently studied the documents.

"I know you," Evelyn said softly. "You've always pursued perfection in research, refusing to admit defeat until hitting a wall."

"Even when something's clearly wrong, you'd use data to prove exactly how it's wrong. That's your academic philosophy."

"But human life is finite, and energy even more so. Is it worth barreling down a dead-end road?"

Like flooring the accelerator at a red light just to experience the crash firsthand.

Eleanor suddenly smiled.

"I've been waiting to see when you'd discover this issue." She traced the folder's cover. "Six months? A year? I didn't expect it so soon."

Not only had they found it—they'd prepared an airtight chain of evidence.

Evelyn's pupils contracted. "You knew all along?"

"You think someone at my level wouldn't notice?"

The problem had existed from the beginning, only becoming apparent as research progressed.

"Then why not stop it?"

Eleanor's eyes dimmed. "I haven't been a proper mentor..."

When the project launched four years ago, her health had already collapsed. Combined with the blow of Evelyn abandoning the combined master's-doctoral program, she'd been bedridden for eight months.

By the time she could return to the lab, the first two phases were complete.

"Students need to graduate. They need papers. They need degrees." Eleanor gave a bitter smile. "Graduate research hinges on participating in major projects."

"By the time I identified the issue, two cohorts had already graduated based on this flawed research."

Now Phase Three was underway, tied to yet another group's academic futures.

"You think I didn't want to cut our losses?" Her voice trembled. "This ship has sailed too far. Even knowing it'll sink, we have to keep going."

Evelyn stood frozen.

"Fortunately," Eleanor gently touched the file, "someone finally had the courage to speak the truth."
###Chapter 390

Evelyn Langley stood by the laboratory window, her fingers absently tapping against the frame.

She refused to believe only the three of them had noticed the issue in their research group.

But the ship had sailed—there was no turning back.

Most graduate students were here just for the degree, treating their theses as mere stepping stones for job hunting.

Professor Eleanor Roland suddenly overturning the research project wouldn’t affect those who had already graduated, but it would leave the current batch in dire straits.

They had already structured their theses around this flawed premise.

It wasn’t that Eleanor didn’t want to correct it—the reality simply wouldn’t allow it.

"It’s my fault for being hospitalized too long." Eleanor’s voice echoed in her mind. "By the time I realized the problem, it was too late. For the sake of that graduating class, I chose silence."

Now, they were stuck between a rock and a hard place.

"But I’m relieved you three caught it so quickly."

Evelyn’s nail left a faint scratch on the window frame.

"What do you think of Hannah and Liam?" Eleanor asked abruptly.

"In what sense?"

"Academic capability, research talent, personal integrity."

Evelyn pondered for a moment. "They’re both exceptional."

Both possessed sharp insight.

Instead of running from the problem, they had sought to verify it.

In the process, each had revealed their unique strengths—

Hannah Flores had a brilliant, agile mind and a photographic memory.

Liam Kalmien remained composed under pressure, with a broad, analytical perspective.

Eleanor smiled in satisfaction. "Seems I made the right choice."

"Since you’ve already identified the flaw, this project holds no further value for you."

"My suggestion—" She paused. "—is to start fresh. Draft a new proposal based on your findings."

"But the lab..." There was only one.

This facility was too small to support two major projects simultaneously.

Eleanor’s tone brooked no argument. "Apply for a new one."

A dedicated space for just the three of them.

——

After the meeting, Evelyn relayed the decision to Hannah and Liam.

Hannah bit her lip. "So we just let the error continue? What’s the point of research like this?"

Evelyn’s gaze was steady. "Mistakes are part of the process. Every conclusion deserves scrutiny."

"But we have a clearer path now. Instead of validating errors, we should pursue the truth."

That didn’t mean the former was meaningless.

Scientific progress was a flowing river—truth and error intertwined to form a complete ecosystem.

Like clear water needing the riverbed’s silt and the darting fish to become a true current.

Pure water alone could never make a river.

To be continued...
###Chapter 391

"Why don't we apply for our own lab?" Evelyn Langley suggested abruptly.

Hannah Flores' chip bag hit the floor with a rustle.

Liam Kalmien's pen left a long streak across his paper.

"Professor Roland..." Hannah hesitated.

"The old lady is more open-minded than you think," Evelyn chuckled. "She's the one who hinted at this idea."

That afternoon, Liam submitted the application through the academic system.

System notification: Feedback within three business days.

Three days later, a glaring red alert flashed on the screen: Application denied.

Reason: Lab resources fully allocated.

"Strange," Evelyn frowned. "I saw that lab empty yesterday. The lock was rusted."

Hannah crunched a chip loudly. "Someone's sabotaging us, aren't they?"

Liam closed his laptop and marched straight to the academic office.

"That lab is clearly vacant. Why claim it's full?"

The administrator pulled up the system. "See? It shows unavailable here. Let me check the records..."

Mouse clicks echoed sharply in the quiet office.

"Found it. Approved to Victor Dimucci three days ago. He's from your department—you must know him?"

Liam's eyes darkened.

Victor already had his own private lab, with special funding and equipment from the university.

"How about Lab B-174 or C-112?" the administrator offered helpfully.

Liam shook his head.

Their research required the CPRT Analyzer. Only two existed in the entire department.

One was permanently reserved by Professor Merouin's team. The other sat in the lab they'd just been denied.

"So now we can't even access the equipment?" Hannah's breakfast wrap plopped onto the table.

"This is blatant resource hoarding! I'm going to the professor!"

Evelyn grabbed her arm.

"Professor's at her medical checkup today," Liam said quietly.

Hannah deflated instantly.

Professor Roland's health had always been fragile—her office perpetually smelled of herbal remedies.

"What now?" She looked between her teammates.

"The system process was followed correctly." Liam adjusted his glasses. "Victor did apply before us."

Only one solution remained...

"Talk to Victor directly," Evelyn declared.

The trio stood in the hallway as the lab door creaked open.

Victor stepped out, peeling off gloves, his white coat stained with chemical splatters.
###Chapter 392

Victor Dimucci studied the three unfamiliar faces before him, recognizing them as Professor Eleanor Roland's newly recruited graduate students.

"Can I help you?" He set down his lab notebook.

Liam Kalmien took a step forward. "Do you conduct all your experiments in this lab, Senior Victor?"

"Mostly. Specialized equipment requires other facilities."

Evelyn Langley cut straight to the chase. "Did you reserve Lab C122?"

"C122?" Victor's brow furrowed slightly.

"Your research doesn't require CPRT Analyzers." Evelyn's gaze sharpened.

Victor adjusted his cufflinks before meeting her eyes again. "I did borrow it."

The two exchanged glances.

"Experimental necessity. Any problem?"

Evelyn pressed further. "Why has the lab remained empty?"

"Occasional usage."

Hannah Flores unclenched her fists. The explanation was airtight.

"How long will you need it?"

"Depends on research progress."

"Understood." Evelyn turned to signal their departure.

Victor watched their retreating figures with a grave expression. After packing his equipment, he headed straight for the administration building.

The door to Professor Beatrice Merouin's office stood slightly ajar.

"Why does Victor get the National Scholarship?" Audrey Escent's shrill voice pierced the air.

"He has tangible research achievements. What do you have?" Beatrice's tone turned glacial.

"My paper—"

"Shall I explain how you obtained it?"

Audrey immediately softened. "Aunt Beatrice, I just wanted to bring honor to our family..."

"Next year."

"I knew you'd side with me!"

"Maintain decorum."

A knock interrupted them.

Victor entered expressionlessly. Beatrice instantly brightened. "Victor! Please sit."

Audrey reluctantly scooted aside.

"No need." Victor remained standing.

Beatrice smiled warmly. "What brings you here?"
###Chapter 393

"Professor, you applied for the lab under my name?" Victor stood in the center of the office, his voice calm.

Beatrice continued grading papers without looking up. "Yes. Is there a problem?"

"I'd like to know its purpose so I can prepare in advance."

She set down her pen with a gentle smile. "No need for preparation yet."

"Leaving it vacant?" His Adam's apple bobbed slightly.

"That's right."

Evelyn's accusatory gaze flashed through his mind. He spoke abruptly, "Then why apply for it at all?"

Beatrice's smile faltered for a split second.

Her eyes narrowed as if observing a disobedient pet.

"Resources must be secured in advance. You should understand that." Her tone remained honeyed.

"What special equipment does that lab have?"

"A CPRT analyzer."

"Our team already has one."

"Isn't an extra beneficial?" She chuckled lightly.

"Other groups might urgently need—"

"Victor." Her expression darkened abruptly. "Have you finished organizing your experimental data?"

"...Not yet."

Beatrice slammed her palm on the desk. "Then focus on your responsibilities! Don't forget who gave you this opportunity!"

His jaw tightened.

Silence engulfed the office.

Finally, he lowered his head. "My apologies, Professor."

Her smile returned. "I'm only strict because I expect excellence. Dedicate yourself to research, and rewards will follow."

He'd heard this mantra too many times.

Three years without a single day's respite.

"The lab will remain under your name for now." She waved dismissively. "Anything else?"

"Nothing."

"Wait—" She stopped him. "Audrey's thesis needs your attention. Finish it by month's end."

"She submitted one just six months ago."

"That's ancient history." Audrey chimed in from the side.

Beatrice shot her niece a warning look before approaching Victor. She placed a familiar hand on his shoulder. "I know you're overworked. By the way, I heard your family's orchard was damaged?"

His body stiffened.

"I quietly sent your parents fifty thousand. It's not much, but..."

His fist clenched inside his sleeve before relaxing.

"Thank you, Professor." The words tasted like sawdust.

"My pleasure." Her smile deepened with satisfaction. "You're my protégé, after all."

Victor turned and left without another word.
###Chapter 394

The silent figure disappeared at the end of the hallway.

"No rush with the thesis. I trust you'll handle it well." Beatrice Merouin lifted her teacup, steam obscuring her expression.

Audrey Escent leaned in. "Auntie, you're amazing. Just a few words and he obeyed like a lamb."

......

The rejected lab application weighed on her heart like a stone.

Hannah Flores slammed her chopsticks down. "This is outrageous! Doesn't the faculty care?"

Liam Kalmien adjusted his glasses. "Victor Dimucci followed all procedures. What grounds does the administration have to interfere?"

"What about our research project?" Hannah poked listlessly at her rice.

"The CPRT Analyzer is the real issue." Liam sighed. "Without the equipment, even an approved lab would be useless."

Hannah suddenly looked up. "How much does that machine cost?"

Evelyn Langley's spoon clattered onto her tray.

Liam froze for two seconds before frantically searching his phone. "The latest model costs $1.26 million."

"Only a million?" Hannah blinked. "Why don't we just buy one?"

Liam nearly choked. "Excuse me?"

"I'll cover it." Hannah patted her chest. "Leave it to me."

"Where would you get that kind of money?" Liam eyed her skeptically.

Hannah was already dialing. "Dad! I need to buy some lab equipment!"

A hearty laugh came through the receiver. "How much does my princess need?"

"Just a million. I've got half a million in my account already."

Liam and Evelyn exchanged stunned glances as their food grew cold on the trays.
###Chapter 395

The crisp notification tone signaled an incoming bank transfer.

Hannah Flores swiped open her phone screen. The banking alert clearly displayed a deposit of 1.5 million.

"Sweetheart, did you get the money?" Ryan Clementson's concerned voice came through the phone.

"Got it!" Hannah cheerfully shook her head. "Thanks, Dad!"

The extra 500k beyond expectations made her eyes crinkle into crescent moons.

"Remember, buy whatever you want. Just tell me if it's not enough." Ryan kept fussing over the details.

After hanging up, Hannah noticed Liam Kalmien and Evelyn Langley staring at her with odd expressions.

"The money's here. Why are you looking at me like that?" She tilted her head.

Liam crossed his arms. "Miss Flores, didn't you say your family lives in a village?"

"Yeah," Hannah said matter-of-factly. "Our urban village is super lively, surrounded by high-end shopping districts."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Parents unemployed building caretakers?"

"My dad owns over eighty buildings," Hannah counted on her fingers. "He spends all day collecting rent and fixing plumbing. That's basically caretaking."

Liam's eye twitched. "Fishing at sea?"

"Mom loves yacht parties. Dad's into deep-sea fishing." Hannah grinned. "They go out together all the time."

The word "yacht" brought sudden silence.

Liam massaged his temples. "So your family is actually wealthy?"

"Huh?" Hannah looked genuinely confused. "Who said we were poor?"

Liam gave her a once-over: faded T-shirt, wrinkled shorts, frayed flip-flops.

"Your outfit..."

"This is how everyone dresses back home!" Hannah stomped her foot indignantly. "My dad collects rent in flip-flops!"

The phrase "daily rent collection" sent the other two into deep contemplation.

Turns out poverty was just an illusion maintained by footwear.

"Now that we've got funds, when are we buying equipment?" Hannah asked eagerly.

Evelyn said seriously, "Costs should be split evenly."

"420k each." Liam did the quick math.

Hannah's eyes suddenly widened. "Wait! You two aren't ordinary either!"

Liam coughed. "Saved up allowance."

"Earned it myself." Evelyn remained calm.

Landing that astronomical breakup settlement did require skill.

With funding secured, a new problem emerged.

"High-end equipment like this is hard to find on the market." Evelyn frowned.

Liam pulled up a sales contact. Two calls later—both disconnected.

"I'll ask my family." She put away her phone. "See if they have procurement channels."
###Chapter 396

Evelyn Langley nodded gently. "I'll think of something too."

Hannah Flores blinked her large eyes. "What should I do then?"

"Chief Financial Officer," Evelyn said decisively.

That afternoon, transfers from Evelyn and Liam Kalmien arrived one after another.

Hannah stared at the $840,000 now in her mobile banking app, unable to suppress the smile tugging at her lips.

Humming a tune, she popped a chocolate cookie into her mouth.

Though her family had never lacked money, earning it herself felt entirely different.

This must be the money-loving gene inherited from her father.

......

Blue light flickered across Evelyn's computer screen.

Her research revealed that CPRT's domestic distributor was a startup called Solaris Tech.

Equity records showed the majority shareholder was someone named Liu Yang.

Digging deeper through the complex corporate structure, a familiar name suddenly appeared.

"Dylan Lowell?"

The call connected instantly.

"Evelyn!" Dylan's voice brimmed with energy.

"How have you been?" Evelyn asked.

"Don't ask. Broke my leg skiing last week—stuck in the hospital now."

Evelyn frowned. "That serious?"

"The boredom's worse! You know I can't sit still."

"Focus on healing properly," Evelyn said with exasperation.

"Got it!" Dylan chuckled. "You need something?"

Evelyn cut to the chase.

"CPRT?" Dylan sounded baffled. "Only CPR I know is first aid..."

"It's a biometric device," Evelyn explained.

"Solaris Tech..." Dylan mused. "Think my fund invested in that."

"But I just followed Julian Roscente's lead on the deal."

"He took a major stake—he'd know more."

"Thanks. Rest well."

"Since when so formal?" Dylan laughed heartily.

After hanging up, Evelyn immediately dialed Julian's number.

"Mr. Roscente."

A teasing voice answered: "So cold, Evie~"

Evelyn nearly dropped her phone.

"Professional distance is best," she said through gritted teeth.

"Now, now," Julian drawled, "I'm currently dating your best friend."

The complicated relationship made Evelyn's temples throb.

"I have a business question," she cut in.

After hearing her out, Julian fell uncharacteristically silent.

"Solaris Tech?"

"Correct."

"Need their CEO?"

"Yes."

Julian chuckled darkly. "Then you should be calling Ethan Winston."
###Chapter 397

Evelyn stared at her phone screen, her finger hovering over the call button.

"Is he really the boss?" she murmured, her brow furrowing unconsciously.

Fate seemed to be playing a cruel joke on her.

After hanging up Julian's call, Evelyn took a deep breath and finally dialed the familiar number.

She recalled her own words from not long ago: "You're too calculating. We should keep our distance."

She had said it with such finality.

Yet here she was, reaching out first.

Her cheeks burned with humiliation.

......

Meanwhile, Julian pocketed his phone and turned to look at Sophia sleeping soundly in bed.

"Weren't we supposed to leave at nine sharp?" he ground out through clenched teeth.

The wall clock showed 9:40.

He'd been waiting in the living room like an idiot for forty minutes.

"Sophia!" he raised his voice.

The figure in bed rolled over, pulling the covers tighter.

Julian strode to the bedside. "Where did you go carousing last night?"

His eyes swept the room like searchlights.

Fortunately, he found nothing suspicious.

Then his pupils constricted abruptly.

Two glasses sat prominently on the nightstand.

"Sophia!" His voice shot up an octave.

A pillow hit him square in the face.

"Shut up!" Sophia bolted upright, her hair a bird's nest. "Either wait quietly or get out now!"

She hated being disturbed during sleep.

Julian was too furious to speak.

How dare she yell at him?

"Fine, I'm leaving!" He turned to go.

But stopped abruptly at the doorway.

"Damn it!"

He muttered a curse before slinking back to the living room.

Thirty minutes later, Sophia finally woke up.

Stretching, she noticed the figure on the couch.

"You're still here?" Her surprise was genuine.

Julian smirked coldly. "You expect me to face my parents alone?"

His mother had specifically invited Sophia for weekend dinner a week ago.

Sophia had agreed readily.

When Julian reminded her yesterday, she'd vowed: "Nine sharp tomorrow. One minute late and you're dead."

And now?

"When did I say nine?" Sophia played dumb.

"Want me to play the recording?" Julian waved his phone.

"You recorded me? Creep!"

"Call it being prepared."

Sophia had no comeback.

Suddenly she realized: "Wait, how did you get in?"

Julian flashed a triumphant smile. "Keypad code. 3-2-1-0."
###Chapter 398

"How did you get my passcode?" Sophia narrowed her eyes.

Julian waved his phone. "You told me yourself when you were drunk at the bar last time."

"Impossible." Her voice was firm.

"Bad temper and worse memory." He shrugged. "Need me to recount the details of that night?"

Sophia grabbed a pillow and hurled it at him.

Julian sidestepped with practiced ease.

She reached for another pillow but found empty air.

"Looking for this?" He produced it from behind his back like a magician.

Her eyes widened. "When did you—"

"Second time." He held up two fingers. "This is your second attempt at pillow-murdering your husband."

Sophia scoffed. "What time is it?"

"Ten-thirty." He sighed. "Someone spent two hours on makeup."

"Meeting my future mother-in-law requires preparation." She extended her hand. "Water."

Julian handed her a glass of warm water.

Her fingers barely touched the surface before she frowned. "I want ice water."

"Ice water in the morning?" He looked appalled.

"Did all your exes drink lukewarm water?" Her lips curved mockingly.

Julian choked.

"Isn't bubble tea served cold? Isn't sashimi raw?" She padded barefoot across the carpet. "Since when is warm water the hallmark of a good woman?"

"So you're the bad one." The words slipped out.

Sophia snatched a slipper.

Julian backpedaled. "Changing it now! By the way, those two cups by the bed—"

"I use them. Problem?"

His face suddenly lit up. "Be right back!"

Sophia watched his retreating figure with bewilderment.

When she emerged in a sapphire dress before the floor-to-ceiling window, sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains.

Julian froze in the doorway, breath catching.

Backlit, she was gilded in gold, the skirt swirling in a perfect arc as she turned. Sunlight traced her delicate collarbones before tapering at her waist.

His pulse roared in his ears.

Thump. Thump.

Condensation dripped from the iced glass in his hand, trickling between his fingers.
###Chapter 399

"Stop spacing out. Hand me the water glass." Sophia Laurent snatched the glass from Julian Roscente's hand.

Julian's lips twitched. "Can we discuss something?"

"Speak." Sophia gulped the ice water, sighing in satisfaction.

"Could you be gentler with me? We're supposed to be lovers, not enemies. My mother will worry."

"Worry about what?"

"That her son is being bullied at home!"

Sophia: "..."

"Sweetheart~ Is this tone better?" She suddenly pitched her voice higher, batting her eyelashes. "Will Auntie like this dress? I picked it out just for her"

Julian shuddered, goosebumps rising. "Never mind. Just be your usual self."

The affected sweetness made his skin crawl.

"Say 'usual' one more time. I dare you."

Julian backtracked instantly. "Gentle. Extremely gentle."

Sophia rolled her eyes, finishing her makeup in record time.

"Let's go."

Julian studied her face. "That makeup..."

"No-makeup makeup. Designed to fool clueless men like you." She smirked. "Can you even tell I'm wearing any?"

The veteran of countless such deceptions, Julian: "..."

He sensed hidden mockery.

At the Roscente villa, Penelope Roscente waited eagerly.

Spotting her son's car, she rushed forward—completely bypassing Julian—to warmly embrace Sophia.

"Sophia, darling! Come inside quickly. The sun's too harsh today."

Julian: "..." Was he adopted?

"Auntie, I'm so sorry for being late. I worked late last night and overslept." Sophia's voice dripped honey. "Choosing the outfit and doing my makeup took forever."

Julian, entering just then, gritted his teeth at the saccharine act.

She was absolutely doing this on purpose!

Penelope patted her hand sympathetically. "All-nighters ruin your complexion. Mrs. Watson—"

"Yes, ma'am?"

"Prepare Sophia some bird's nest soup. And book a mobile spa—the anti-aging recovery package—for 3 PM."

"Of course~" Sophia's eyes lit up.

Rich women truly knew how to live. This deal was paying off already.

She glanced at Julian, suddenly finding their arrangement slightly more tolerable.

......

Lunch was extravagantly lavish, with even Julian's father, Leonard Roscente, returning from the office specially.

Afterwards, Penelope mysteriously led Sophia to the bedroom, presenting an embroidered box. "Open it."

The lid lifted—Sophia's breath caught.

An imperial jade bangle, flawless in clarity with minimal inclusions, its rounded band glowing richly.

This quality could headline an auction.
###Chapter 400

"Auntie, this is..." Sophia Laurent stared at the emerald-green jade bracelet, her fingertips trembling slightly.

"I picked it just for you." Eleanor Roland smiled warmly. "The moment I saw it at Sotheby's Hong Kong auction last month, I knew it belonged to my future daughter-in-law."

Her fingers traced the smooth surface. "I thought I'd have to wait years before gifting it. Who knew my son would move so fast?"

Sophia's throat tightened. An imperial jade of this quality had a starting bid of at least eight figures.

"It's too extravagant. I can't accept this." She hastily declined.

A fake girlfriend receiving a real betrothal gift—this charade was absurd.

"Don't be nervous." Eleanor took her hand. "Consider it a welcome gift. I'm not the type of mother-in-law who forces marriage through presents."

The cool jade slid onto her wrist, accentuating her snow-white skin.

"Perfect fit." Eleanor nodded approvingly.

Sophia stared at her wrist with a bitter smile—a priceless imperial jade on an impostor. What a waste.

In the living room, Julian Roscente lounged lazily on the sofa. "What secrets are you two whispering about?"

"Someone's jealous?" Eleanor nudged Sophia forward. "Here, have her back."

"Who's jealous?" Julian scoffed, though his gaze flickered to the emerald glint on Sophia's wrist.

The afternoon spa left Sophia utterly relaxed. Sipping water by the floor-to-ceiling window, her phone suddenly vibrated.

"Who is this?"

"Miss Laurent... It's Adrian Lefèvre." The young man's voice carried nervous hesitation.

Sophia narrowed her eyes as memories of that hotel night surfaced. A smirk curled her lips. "Of course I remember."

"You never contacted me..." His voice dipped. "I thought you forgot."

"You didn't leave your number." She swirled her water glass.

"I wrote it on a note by the bedside table..."

Recalling the empty nightstand, Sophia's smile deepened. "But we're connected now, aren't we?"

"I've been staring at my phone every day..." The boy's voice brimmed with youthful grievance. "It took all my courage to call."

"How pitiful." Her finger traced the rim of her glass. "You're breaking my heart."

"Then... can we meet?"

Before Sophia could answer, a glass slammed down behind her.

She turned and met Julian's stormy gaze. How long had he been standing there? Dark currents churned in his eyes.

"Julian, you—"

A warm arm suddenly encircled her waist. Julian leaned close, his breath brushing her ear. "Look up."

On the second-floor balcony, Eleanor leaned against the railing, watching them with an amused smile.
###Chapter 401

Sophia Laurent and Mrs. Watson stood on the second-floor hallway, their gazes fixed on the striking couple below.

"Look at those two. Perfect match!" Sophia beamed, unable to contain her delight.

Mrs. Watson nodded eagerly. "When has Master Julian ever been this attentive to a woman?"

"Evelyn has both beauty and grace. That boy finally came to his senses." Sophia rubbed her chin in satisfaction.

"Master Julian has always had sharp instincts. Never falters when it matters."

"If only I could hold a grandchild soon, my life would be complete."

"Hmm? Why does Master Julian look a bit off?"

Sophia narrowed her eyes. "Why is Evelyn so stiff?"

Despite being close, there was an inexplicable tension between them.

Downstairs, Julian Roscente lowered his voice. "Don't move. My mother is watching."

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. "Since when has your mother been here?"

"Since you took that phone call."

Evelyn immediately felt like needles were pricking her back.

Sophia's murmur carried clearly. "Why are they just hugging? No affection?"

Evelyn took a deep breath and met Julian's gaze. "Kiss me."

Julian's pupils dilated.

"What are you waiting for? Hurry up!"

His Adam's apple bobbed, dark intensity swirling in his eyes.

The next second, he gripped her waist and crushed his lips against hers.

Evelyn shuddered.

Their breaths grew scorching as their mouths tangled.

"Oh! They're kissing! Let's go, let's go. Don't disturb the young ones." Sophia quickly pulled Mrs. Watson away.

Slap!

A sharp sound echoed.

Julian held his cheek. "You hit me?"

Evelyn's legs trembled. "Who told you to take it seriously?"

"You asked for it."

"I told you to fake it!"

"My mother is sharp. It had to look convincing." Julian crossed his arms. "Besides, I'm the one at a disadvantage here. Do you know how many women—"

Evelyn scoffed. "Funny. The line of men chasing me stretches all the way to France."

Julian was rendered speechless.

After a pause, he murmured, "Are they better than me?"

"You're just average." Evelyn deliberately provoked him.

Julian's expression darkened instantly.

"Evelyn—" Sophia's voice floated from upstairs. "The esthetician is waiting."

"Coming!"

Evelyn turned to leave but remembered her phone on the couch.

As she reached for it, Julian snatched it first.

"Give it back."

"Playing with your phone during a spa session?" Julian said sternly. "Focus on entertaining my mother. Don't blow our cover."

Evelyn eyed him suspiciously before heading upstairs.

Julian stared at the phone in his hand, his knuckles turning white.

...

At dawn, Evelyn Langley stepped out of her home with a backpack.
###Chapter 402

The elevator doors slid shut.

Evelyn Langley stared at the flickering floor numbers, suddenly realizing something—she hadn't run into Adrian Klein in the elevator for a long time.

At this hour, she used to always see him in workout clothes, ready for his evening jog. Sometimes they'd brush past each other; other times, they'd walk together for a stretch.

But for the past two weeks, the door next to hers had been eerily silent, as if no one lived there.

She pulled out her phone and opened her chat with Adrian. The last message, sent ten days ago, was her asking about some lab data. It remained unread.

"Must be busy with his project," Evelyn murmured to herself.

At 8:15 PM, the library's closing melody played. Evelyn packed her bag and walked home under the cool night breeze.

Just as she reached her building, a familiar figure dashed past her.

"Profes—"

Before she could finish, the figure vanished around the corner. The jogger didn't even glance back, as if he hadn't heard her at all.

Evelyn stood frozen, staring at the empty street.

This wasn't right.

She hurried home and changed into workout gear. If Adrian was jogging, she could catch up.

More importantly, she desperately needed a CPRT analyzer. Professor Eleanor Roland's condition had been unstable lately, and she didn't want to bother her. As for Ethan Winston...

Evelyn's fingers paused on her shoelaces at the thought of that man's knowing smile.

Adrian's help, in contrast, always came at just the right moment—never burdensome.

The campus at night was unusually quiet. Evelyn searched their usual jogging route three times but found no trace of Adrian.

By the time she got home, it was 9:30. She left the door slightly ajar, prepping breakfast for the next day while listening for any movement in the hallway.

Yam slices fell neatly under her knife; millet swirled in clear water. Even as the clay pot began to simmer, the corridor outside remained silent.

"Professor Klein?" She knocked on his door. "Are you there?"

No answer.

Meanwhile, the biology lab blazed with light.

Vincent Macmillan nearly dropped his test tube when Adrian suddenly reappeared. "I thought you went home to sleep?"

"Last-minute data to process." Adrian didn't look up.

"You call working 72 hours straight 'last-minute'?" Vincent snatched the pipette from his hand. "Out with it—who are you avoiding?"

Adrian's hands froze imperceptibly.

The motion-sensor lights in the hallway flickered off, plunging his expression into darkness.
###Chapter 403

Vincent Macmillan chewed on his pen cap, tilting his head as he studied Adrian Klein organizing lab data. "Adrian, you've been radiating enough chill to freeze someone to death lately. What's going on?"

Adrian didn't look up. "You're imagining things."

He grabbed his black gym bag and headed to the break room. The folding bed in the corner caught his eye—Evelyn Langley's designated napping spot.

A memory flashed through his mind: the girl curled up on that bed, sunlight filtering through the blinds to paint dappled patterns on her face. His breath had hitched that day.

"Damn it." Adrian slammed the locker shut, his knuckles turning white.

Vincent's voice carried through the door. "I ordered barbecue. Got your favorite grilled eggplant."

"Not interested."

"There's lamb chops and oysters too. Sure you don't want any?"

"Not hungry."

Vincent abruptly changed topics. "Speaking of which, Evelyn's garlic butter shrimp with glass noodles was legendary... She hasn't been to the lab since school started, has she? Next time you see her—"

"Tell her yourself." Adrian stormed out, his lab coat whipping behind him.

Vincent coughed from the sudden gust. "You live across the hall from each other. Would it kill you to pass along a message?"

"Yes."

Vincent studied his friend's tense profile when realization struck. "Adrian, don't tell me you're—"

The man at the lab bench stilled his hands.

"—hitting early menopause?" Vincent counted on his fingers. "Irritability, mood swings, insomnia..."

Adrian snapped the microscope shut. "Shut up."

Outside, the sunset painted the entire lab in fiery orange hues.

——

At Gourmet Haven's private dining room, Ethan Winston was sterilizing tableware.

Evelyn entered just as he pushed a freshly sanitized teacup toward her. "Perfect timing."

"Sorry to keep you waiting."

Ethan chuckled. "Ten minutes early counts as late now?"

He wore a charcoal-gray shirt today, sleeves rolled to his elbows, the watch on his wrist glinting coldly under the lights.

"This place requires pre-orders." Ethan signaled the waiter. "I got seasonal asparagus and matsutake mushrooms."

Dishes arrived one after another, each plated with edible flowers like miniature artworks.

"I was supposed to treat you—"

"My pleasure." Ethan cut her off, his gaze softening.

Evelyn sipped her soup in silence.

"Actually..." She hesitated. "I brought two classmates."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Of course they're welcome."

The door swung open. Hannah Flores's eyes lit up, nearly whistling. But Liam Kalmien froze behind her, staring at Ethan.

"And this is...?" Ethan's gaze lingered on Liam's face a beat longer, his smile deepening.

Liam swallowed hard. "Hello."
###Chapter 404

Hannah Flores tugged at Liam Kalmien's sleeve as they took seats beside Evelyn Langley.

Ethan Winston signaled the waiter. "Two more place settings, and add your two signature dishes."

"Would you like recommendations?"

Ethan's gaze shifted to the newcomers.

"Braised pork belly!" Hannah blurted out.

Liam adjusted his glasses. "No seafood, please."

"Right away."

The waiter bowed and quietly closed the carved wooden door behind him.

Silence settled over the private dining room.

Ethan tapped the table lightly. "Aren't you going to introduce us, Evie?"

The affectionate nickname made Hannah's head snap up.

Liam's eyes narrowed behind his lenses.

Evelyn remained composed. "My classmates, Liam Kalmien and Hannah Flores."

She turned to Ethan. "This is Mr. Winston, CEO of Solaris Tech."

"Must be serious trouble if Evie reached out first." He emphasized the word "you" deliberately.

Hannah and Liam exchanged glances, hesitating to speak.

Evelyn sighed. "Here's the situation..."

"So you want to bypass the university and purchase the CPRT analyzer privately?"

"Yes."

Ethan paused mid-tap. "Does the administration know?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Not yet."

There was no point reporting when they weren't even sure about securing the equipment.

"Private purchases are allowed. Solaris is willing to sell, but only through proper channels." Ethan's gaze sharpened. "Otherwise, it'll cause endless complications."

Hannah frowned. "Even if we pay with our own money?"

"The equipment will ultimately reside in the university lab. The accounting must be transparent." Ethan chuckled. "Unless you enjoy being taken advantage of?"

Hannah slammed the table. "Of course not!"

Ethan calmly adjusted his cufflinks. "Leave it to me."

Hannah nearly knocked over her teacup in excitement. "You're amazing, Mr. Winston!"

Ethan suddenly turned to Evelyn. "What do you think?"

Her fingers tightened.

He clearly had already decided—why ask her publicly?

Seeing her silence, Ethan smiled wider. "Then it's settled. Fifty percent discount. Acceptable?"

"Half price?!" Hannah counted on her fingers. "That's enough savings for a sports car!"

Evelyn and Liam frowned simultaneously.

"Business partnerships require boundaries." Evelyn's tone was firm.

Liam nodded. "Favors are the hardest debts to repay."

Ethan swirled his wineglass. "Just an internal discount. I am, after all, a shrewd businessman."

As the conversation lulled, the group began eating.

Hannah's eyes widened after her first bite of braised pork. "This is incredible! Why haven't I heard of this place?"

"Members-only establishment." Ethan dabbed his mouth with a napkin.

Evelyn glanced at him sideways.

"Hence 'private kitchen.'" He winked at her.

When the meal ended, Evelyn excused herself to the restroom but headed straight for the reception.

"Mr. Winston already signed the check."

Familiar footsteps approached from behind.

"I thought you were touching up your makeup?" Ethan leaned against a marble pillar, his tie slightly loosened.

Evelyn turned. "I said this was my treat."

He stepped closer, whispering near her ear, "Pity. I never let the woman I love pay."
###Chapter 405

"Others can change, but not for you."

Evelyn Langley pressed her lips together in silence.

The three stepped out of the restaurant and realized, to their surprise, they were all headed the same way.

Hannah Flores pulled out her phone to call a ride.

A black Mercedes slowly pulled up to the curb.

The window rolled down, revealing Ethan Winston's striking profile. "Get in. I'll drive you."

Hannah glanced at Evelyn.

Ethan chuckled. "At this hour, you'll be number 216 in the queue."

Liam Kalmien nodded silently.

Hannah checked her phone and gasped—216 people ahead of them.

Evelyn opened the backseat door. "Thank you, Mr. Winston."

"No trouble at all, Evelyn."

......

The GPS indicated Evelyn's home would be the first stop.

But Ethan missed the right turn and had to continue straight.

After recalculating the route, Evelyn ended up being the last one dropped off.

The car stopped at the entrance of the old alley.

Ethan circled to the passenger side and opened the door with gentlemanly grace. "Watch your step."

Evelyn stood firm. "Thanks."

"For what? Opening the door or buying the equipment?"

"Both."

"Not inviting me up for tea?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

"Just joking. Don’t think of me as a bad guy."

"Are you?"

Ethan laughed softly. "Not now. But I want to be—just don’t dare."

"I don’t understand."

"Maybe it’s better that way."

Some attractions defy all logic.

Like that day at Harvard’s gates—Nathan Evans wasn’t the only one struck by her.

So was he.

Oh, and Sebastian Sherwood too.

Nathan moved fastest, Sebastian close behind.

But hesitation cost him his chance.

By the next update, she was already Nathan’s girlfriend.

He never imagined Nathan would take it seriously.

Nor that he’d succeed.

That’s when it hit him—some opportunities vanish forever.

Yet he clung to hope.

Because he knew Nathan’s true nature.

All he needed was patience...

Wait for their breakup, for her heart to shatter completely...

Fortunately, his wait paid off.

"If I can’t come up for tea, at least grant me a goodnight?"

"Goodnight, Mr. Winston."

"Drop the title."

"...Goodnight."

"Good girl."

Suddenly, he reached out and ruffled her hair.

By the time Evelyn processed it, the man was already walking away, his silhouette fading into the night.
###Chapter 406

Evelyn Langley glared at the retreating figure, grinding her teeth in frustration.

Ethan Winston strode forward without looking back, as if he had eyes on the back of his head. He even casually waved his hand.

Evelyn stomped her foot in anger.

Deep in the alley, Nathan Evans had been standing motionless for a full hour.

The red roses in his arms tumbled to the ground.

In the next second, he bolted toward the alley entrance.

"Ethan Winston—"

The man about to enter his car paused mid-motion.

A fist came at him with a sharp whistle of wind.

Ethan sidestepped, but the blow still grazed his cheekbone.

When Nathan swung again, Ethan seized his collar and nearly threw him to the pavement.

The two quickly separated.

Ethan touched his stinging cheekbone. "Nathan Evans, have you lost your mind?"

"You're exactly who I want to hit!"

Suddenly, Ethan laughed. He glanced in the direction Nathan had come from and understood.

"Saw everything, did you?" His grin widened mockingly.

Nathan's eyes burned red, his fists clenched so tightly they cracked.

"Can't handle it? There'll be plenty more scenes like this." Ethan taunted, "Planning to throw punches every time?"

"Too bad beating me won't change a damn thing."

Nathan's chest heaved violently, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Then, abruptly, he stilled. "Did Evelyn Langley agree to be with you?"

Ethan's smile froze.

Nathan smirked coldly. "Guess not. Couldn't win her back then—what makes you think you can now?"

"At least I had her once." Ethan shot back. "You? Too scared to even touch her."

"Someone else's castoffs must really tempt you. Can't afford anything new? Or do you just enjoy digging through trash?"

Ethan yanked him by the collar. "Say that again."

"Did I lie?"

"Say whatever you want about me." Ethan's voice turned icy. "But don't you dare insult her—the woman who loved you for six years!"

Nathan let himself be grabbed, a cold smile curling his lips. "Admit it. You're jealous I had her for those six years."

"Jealous?" Ethan scoffed. "Jealous of a failure who couldn't keep her?"

"I just pity her for ever loving garbage like you!"

The punch landed on Nathan's nose before the words finished.

"That one's for Evelyn Langley."

The second blow struck his cheekbone.

"And this one's payback."

"Ethan Winston!" Nathan roared, launching himself forward.

In the dim alley, two men in tailored suits became a tangled mess of fists.

Dylan Lowell arrived and gasped. "I knew this would happen!"

Julian Roscente watched in horror. "They're trying to kill each other!"

They rushed to intervene.

Dylan locked his arms around Nathan. "Nate, calm down! Fighting won't solve anything!"

Ethan sneered. "Don't need solutions. Just taking out the trash."

"Who the hell are you calling trash?!"

"Whoever fits the description!"

As the brawl threatened to reignite, Julian suddenly shouted, "Evelyn Langley's here!"

Both men froze instantly.
###Chapter 407

The afternoon sun slanted across the concrete parking lot.

Nathan Evans' fist remained suspended midair, his knuckles white with tension.

Ethan Winston's suit collar was crooked, a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.

"Enough!" Dylan Lowell abruptly stepped between them. "Evelyn's coming!"

Both men turned.

The empty parking lot held only silent vehicles.

Julian Roscente spread his hands. "Would you have stopped otherwise?"

Nathan's Adam's apple bobbed.

Ethan adjusted his tie, his thumb brushing the blood from his lip.

"Thirty-year-old men," Dylan sighed, "brawling like high schoolers."

Ethan said calmly, "He threw the first punch."

"Serves him right." Nathan smirked.

Julian pocketed his hands. "Keep this up and Evelyn really will show. Who wants to explain their bruised faces then?"

Ethan's fingers stilled.

Nathan looked away.

"Get those cuts checked," Dylan noted the scrapes on Nathan's knuckles.

"Unnecessary." Nathan met Ethan's gaze. "Last warning—stay away from her."

Ethan suddenly smiled. "No harm in trying. At least I still have a chance, unlike you—" He paused. "That ship has sailed."

Nathan's fist clenched again, stopped by Dylan's grip.

"Pathetic." Ethan turned toward his car.

Tires screeched against pavement.

Nathan shook Dylan off. "He's gone. Why bother holding me back?"

"Worth it?" Dylan studied his friend's bloodshot eyes.

Nathan yanked his car door open. "Ask him that."

Another engine roared to life.

Dylan and Julian exchanged glances.

"Damn frustrating." Dylan kicked a pebble.

Julian produced a cigarette pack. "Two lunatics."

"What's Ethan even playing at?"

Julian's lighter hesitated.

Through the smoke, he murmured, "Love doesn't follow logic."

Dylan's eyes widened.

Hearing this from Julian was downright surreal.

So much for "bros before hoes."

So much for playing the field.

Morning light pierced the clouds.

A breeze lifted the lab curtain's edge.

Vincent Macmillan yawned as he pushed open the break room door.

"Adrian?" He rubbed his eyes. "All-nighter?"

At the workstation, Adrian Klein remained motionless.

The pipette in his hand never wavered.

Only after recording the final dataset did he remove his goggles.

"Early start."

"How early?"

"Five."

Vincent whistled. "You're... charger still here? My phone's dead."

"Left cabinet."

"Always so organized." Vincent grumbled. "Can't you just leave it on the table?"

The cabinet door clicked.

Vincent turned abruptly. "Your phone's blinking. Want me to grab it?"

Adrian paused mid-wipe.

"Thanks."

When the screen lit up, his pupils contracted sharply.
###Chapter 408

The phone screen lit up, revealing two glaring missed calls.

Adrian's pupils contracted slightly.

Evelyn Langley's name sat quietly in the call log.

He immediately opened WhatsApp.

"Professor, I have an experiment question. Are you available?"

The message had been sent five days ago.

He'd missed it!

His slender fingers hovered over the keyboard before withdrawing.

"Vincent, monitor the data. Emergency."

Before his colleague could protest, the lab coat disappeared through the doorway.

"Hey! It's my day off! Adrian, you—"

Only retreating footsteps echoed down the hallway.

......

The doorbell rang three times.

No answer.

Adrian stood outside Evelyn's apartment, brow slightly furrowed.

Returning home, his fingers hesitated over his phone.

"Apologies for the delay. Still need assistance?"

Sent.

Thirty minutes passed. The screen remained dark.

Had she waited like this too?

Meanwhile, Evelyn wiped sweat from her forehead, rubber gloves squeaking.

"This lab is enormous!" Hannah collapsed onto the freshly mopped floor.

Liam adjusted his glasses. "More space means better organization."

The abandoned laboratory's dust had settled for years.

Three hours of work barely arranged the main equipment.

"Why won't the university hire cleaners?" Hannah groaned.

"Frugality builds character," Liam deadpanned.

At the cafeteria entrance, Evelyn paused mid-step.

Adrian approached rapidly, breath uneven.

"You contacted me?"

She blinked. Hannah and Liam discreetly stepped back.

"I... sent a message," Evelyn murmured. "But we resolved it."

Adrian's frown deepened. "What happened?"

Hannah jumped in. "Someone blocked our materials!"

"Who?"

"Beatrice Merouin!" Hannah spat the name. "Abusing her professor status!"
###Chapter 409

Hannah Flores had never met Adrian Klein, nor did she know about his connection to Evelyn Langley. But that didn't stop her from wanting to vent.

After lunch, the three returned to the lab.

Hannah planted her hands on her hips with a sigh. "The space is nice, but cleaning it is a nightmare..."

Before she could finish, a voice called from the doorway. "Excuse me, is this C116?"

Two cleaning ladies stood at the entrance, holding mops and rags.

"Huh? Yes..." Hannah blinked in confusion. "You are...?"

"Perfect!" The women immediately got to work without another word.

Hannah's eyes widened. "Wait, are you sure you have the right place?"

"Absolutely. The administration office sent us to clean C116."

The administration office?

Hannah and Evelyn both turned to Liam Kalmien.

Liam shook his head.

Since when did he have that kind of pull?

"Whatever, free cleaning service!" Hannah plopped down and ripped open a bag of chips. "Come on, dig in."

Evelyn accepted a chip but seemed distracted.

She had a guess about who might have arranged this.

It really wasn't necessary...

"Hey, not hungry?" Hannah nudged Liam.

He declined. "Too many calories."

"..." Hannah rolled her eyes.

Meanwhile, in the Life Sciences office...

Benjamin Aldridge wiped sweat from his brow, forcing a stiff smile. "Mr. Winston, what brings you here today?"

Ethan Winston's expression remained icy. "You know exactly why I'm here."

"Has all the equipment donated by Solaris Tech gone to waste?"

Benjamin paled. "I don't understand what you mean."

As the associate dean in charge of fundraising, Benjamin prided himself on being diplomatic. But Ethan's tone sent chills down his spine.

"Our department has always upheld fairness—"

"Fairness?" Ethan's laugh was sharp. "Is it fair when someone monopolizes lab equipment and blocks others from using it?"

"What was promised when we donated the CPRT analyzers? Equal access for all students."

"Instead, they've become tools for power plays."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "This directly impacts Solaris's future donation plans."

Benjamin's back prickled with cold sweat. "Mr. Winston, I'll investigate this immediately!"

His mind raced.

The issue had to be with those two CPRT analyzers...

"Your insight is invaluable. We'll address any academic misconduct with the utmost seriousness."

Ethan's expression softened slightly. "I've always trusted your judgment, Dean Aldridge."
###Chapter 410

"Mr. Winston, your kindness is too much for me to accept."

Ethan Winston stood to take his leave.

Benjamin Aldridge escorted him all the way to the elevator. The obsequious smile on his face vanished the moment the doors closed.

He hurried back to his office and immediately called the academic affairs office. "Check the recent usage records of the CPRT Analyzers."

A hesitant voice replied, "One is being used by Professor Merouin's team. The other...was just approved for Victor Dimucci last week."

"Victor Dimucci? Isn't he Beatrice Merouin's subordinate?"

"Exactly. It's strange—they already have one. Three of Professor Roland's graduate students also applied, but they were too late..."

"Eleanor Roland's people applied too?"

"Yes, almost at the same time."

Benjamin suddenly understood.

No wonder Ethan came personally.

"Clear out that lab immediately! Victor is being completely unreasonable!"

He carefully avoided mentioning Beatrice Merouin's involvement.

"Understood."

The moment he hung up, his office door swung open again.

Benjamin's forehead was still damp with sweat as he forced another smile. "Professor Klein! What brings you here? Please, have a seat."

Adrian Klein skipped the pleasantries and cut straight to the point.

"University regulations explicitly prohibit the malicious hoarding of shared resources. You know this better than I do, Director Aldridge."

Benjamin's heart skipped a beat.

Again?!

......

The two janitors worked efficiently, leaving the lab spotless in under an hour.

"Thank you."

"Of course, of course!"

They gathered their supplies and left.

Some equipment had been temporarily moved to the hallway for cleaning. There wasn’t much—three people could easily carry it all back.

"Well, if it isn’t Professor Roland’s star students?"

A mocking voice rang out.

The trio turned to see Shane Evlanch and Audrey Escent standing nearby. One wore a sneer, the other a cold stare.

"So this is the lab you applied for? Tsk. Not a single decent piece of equipment. What a waste of space."

Audrey scoffed. "Shane, are you blind? The best equipment is with our team. What could they possibly have?"

Shane nodded. "Exactly. Top-tier gear should go to top-tier teams. Some people should just quit while they’re ahead."

Evelyn Langley smiled. "If you enjoy being livestock, don’t drag others into the mud."

Hannah Flores added, "Right? Choosing to be a horse instead of a human—someone’s got water in their brain..."

"You—" Shane’s face turned livid.

Audrey snorted. "What’s the point of talking big? Show us what you’ve got! Shane, let’s go."

Shane couldn’t resist a final jab. "Want to use the CPRT? Keep dreaming! Why don’t you buy your own?"

Liam Kalmien: "Good idea."

Evelyn agreed: "Worth considering."

Hannah finished: "Delivery tomorrow. Come take a look."

Shane stared at them like they were insane. "You’re crazy!"

Buy a CPRT?

That’s a million-dollar precision instrument!

Yet the next day, when a brand-new CPRT Analyzer was escorted into the lab by a professional team, the blood drained from Shane and Audrey’s faces as they watched from the crowd...
###Chapter 411

"What is that?"
"It looks like imported lab equipment!"
"See those foreigners? Must be the installation technicians."
"I thought this lab was always empty?"
"Must be a new project starting..."

The hushed whispers around made Shane Evlanch's expression darken.

Audrey Escent pushed to the front, her pupils contracting as she stared at the gleaming new machine.

It was indeed a CPRT Analyzer—but clearly an upgraded model.

Its size had been reduced by a third, with the control panel now fully touchscreen.

The display was significantly larger than their current lab models.

"Is...is this the latest CPRT model?!" Shane's voice cracked.

He stormed forward. "Where did you get this?"

Evelyn Langley lifted cold eyes. "None of your business."

Hannah Flores nibbled a cookie, smiling sweetly. "You told us to figure it out ourselves. Now that we have the equipment, shouldn't you be happy for us?"

Shane was speechless with rage.

Audrey shook her head. "Impossible. There's no way to acquire one this quickly."

Liam Kalmien adjusted his glasses. "Ever heard of pre-orders?"

"No..." Audrey paled.

Equipment this expensive couldn't just be purchased on a whim.

But worse humiliation awaited them.

That afternoon, the university website posted a disciplinary notice:

"Disciplinary Action Regarding Graduate Student Victor Dimucci's Unauthorized Lab Usage"

...

Crash!

Prof. Beatrice Merouin's teacup shattered on the floor.

She marched into Benjamin Aldridge's office, glaring down at him. "You disciplined my student without consulting me?"

Benjamin remained calm. "This was a faculty committee decision, following protocol."

"Spare me the bureaucracy!" Beatrice sneered.

"Professor Merouin," Benjamin's eyes narrowed, "if not for your reputation, more than just Victor would be penalized. Did you really think the faculty wouldn't notice your little schemes?"

Beatrice froze.

"Sacrificing one student to protect you was already leniency."

The words deflated her completely.

In the dorm room, Victor Dimucci stared blankly at the disciplinary notice on his screen.

Zachary Omelas hovered nearby, hesitating to speak.

"They actually bought the newest CPRT model?" Victor suddenly asked.

Zachary blinked. "Huh?"

"Let's go see." Victor shut his laptop.

"But..." Zachary glanced at the disciplinary notice, conflicted.

The lab hallway had quieted.

Evelyn's group was gone, leaving only foreign engineers calibrating the equipment.

After obtaining permission, Victor and Zachary entered.

"It really is the upgraded version..." Victor's eyes lit up.

His hand twitched toward the controls before he caught himself.

Though Zachary didn't understand the machine's significance, Victor's focused gaze told him everything.
###Chapter 412

"Victor, this equipment...it must be expensive?" Zachary swallowed hard.

Victor's gaze lingered on the brand-new instrument. "Yeah. Very."

"How much exactly?"

"Over a million."

Zachary sucked in a sharp breath.

It wasn't the price that shocked him, but the fact that Evelyn and her friends could casually purchase something so costly.

Three girls. Over a million.

He thought of his farming parents back home, scrimping all year round. Even in their best years, they couldn't save fifty thousand.

This single machine equaled two decades of his parents' savings.

Zachary stood frozen.

Hannah's cheerful voice echoed down the hallway. They were back!

Victor pulled Zachary out through the rear exit.

Before leaving, Victor couldn't help glancing back.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating the three girls.

Evelyn held a bottle of mineral water with French labeling—each sip worth three days of his meals.

Hannah carried an armful of imported snacks, their English packaging glinting under the light.

Liam sipped a sports drink from packaging he'd only seen in commercials.

"Hey, what's on your mind?"

At the building's base, Zachary nudged his shoulder.

Victor murmured, "Nice."

Zachary sighed. "Yeah, the new equipment must be great to use."

Victor smiled.

He wasn't talking about the machine.

It was their ability to stand against injustice, to purchase what they desired without hesitation.

That feeling—it was nice.

Inside the lab—

Evelyn handed water to the technicians. "Thank you for your hard work."

Hannah tore open snacks. "Take a break and have some food!"

......

Professor Eleanor Roland learned about the incident three days later.

The elderly woman slammed her desk. "Beatrice! How dare she?!"

"And you! Why didn't you tell me about something this important? I may be old, but I'm not senile yet!"

Evelyn quickly interjected. "Professor, what are you saying? You're still young!"

Eleanor glared. "Had I known earlier, you wouldn't have needed to buy new equipment yourselves!"

Evelyn blinked. "The new instruments are quite efficient. Our productivity has improved."

"Exactly!" Hannah nodded vigorously. "Money well spent!"

Liam adjusted his glasses. "Data confirms superior performance."

Eleanor: "..."

"One word from me, ten retorts from you!"

"Hehe..."

The matter was settled.

......

Beatrice Merouin had been having a rough week.

First, Victor received disciplinary action, embarrassing her before the faculty.

Then the dean summoned her for a talk.

Not Benjamin Aldridge from administration—the actual department head.

The conversation carried implicit warnings against factionalism.

Leaving the office, Beatrice's back was drenched in sweat.

She stormed to Benjamin. "Did you report me?"

Benjamin looked equally confused. "Why would I? What good would that do me?"

Beatrice frowned. "Then who?"

A name flashed through Benjamin's mind.

Ethan Winston lacked that kind of influence.

Only one person could make the dean intervene personally...

Who else could it be?
###Chapter 413

"Who do you suspect?" Beatrice Merouin stared intently at Benjamin Aldridge.

The corner of Benjamin's mouth twisted into a sneer. "Don't ask. You're out of your league."

When Ethan Winston spoke to her, he'd dance around the subject. But this person barged in and confronted her directly...

That was the weight of an academic titan.

Harvard could survive without a businessman's sponsorship, but never without a scientist capable of groundbreaking discoveries!

"Go home. A starved camel is still bigger than a horse," Benjamin scoffed. "You—you're not even fit to lick Eleanor Roland's boots!"

Eleanor could summon two power players just by lying in a hospital bed.

Who did Beatrice Merouin think she was?

——

Back in her office, Benjamin's words echoed in Beatrice's ears.

Not even fit to lick her boots...

Trembling with rage, she reached for a cup to throw—only to remember she'd already smashed them all.

All that remained was a pencil holder.

Bang!

It shattered against the wall, scattering pens across the floor.

Audrey Escent walked in, oblivious to the tension. "Auntie," she called, heading straight to the water dispenser for a drink.

"I'm parched..." She gulped. "Auntie, when will Victor finish my paper? My professor asked today. I promised it by this week—can you hurry him along?"

Beatrice's face darkened. "Do you think research papers grow on trees? You can't just snap your fingers and have one ready! Stop making promises you can't keep!"

The sudden outburst left Audrey stunned.

"Auntie..."

"Shut up! How many times must I remind you? At school, I'm Professor Merouin!"

"But there's nobody else here..." Audrey pouted.

"Walls have ears! One wrong word, and we're both ruined!"

Finally grasping the gravity, Audrey stammered, "Sorry, Professor! I'll remember next time! It's just the paper..."

"You're still on about that? Why not write it yourself? Evelyn Langley's team bought their own equipment—can't you draft your own paper?"

"Victor might help you once or twice, but do you expect him to do it forever? Once he makes his name, do you think he'll spare you a second glance?"

"I tried... I just can't!" Audrey's eyes welled up.

She'd boasted too much, built up her image—now she was trapped by her own lies.

Beatrice scoffed. "Stop sniveling! I'm not dead yet! If Evelyn's team can manage, why can't you? Clearly, your heart isn't in academia!"

"Always grasping for first place, yet falling short at everything. How did I end up with such a useless niece?"

"Get out—now!"

Audrey stumbled from the office in a daze.

She couldn't comprehend what she'd done wrong—why her usually gentle aunt had transformed into this terrifying stranger.

After the outburst, Beatrice's temper cooled slightly.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Enter."

Victor Dimucci stepped inside. "Professor, here's the latest progress report..."

Beatrice took the documents.

Her frown deepened with each page. "A whole month, and zero progress?"

"The cultured bacterial groups show inconsistent data. We're troubleshooting."

"How much longer?"

"...Uncertain."

"'Uncertain'? Solutions come from human ingenuity! This project has stalled for half a year. No results by year-end means zero productivity for the entire team!"

Victor remained calm. "Experiments require verification time."

Beatrice's lips curled. "Victor, you're intelligent. You know how precious time is. Spend years like Eleanor Roland without results, and you'll be obsolete!"

"You say the data varies—isn't reculturing meant to achieve consistency? If uniformity is inevitable, why waste time double-checking?"

She narrowed her eyes. "Consistent or not—who's to say it isn't our call?"

Victor's gaze turned heavy. "Are you suggesting...?"
###Chapter 414

The doctor adjusted his glasses with professional detachment. "This condition does have medical precedent. If you're concerned, I recommend bringing your husband in for a full examination. Preconception checkups are crucial."

Nanchu's fingers tightened around the test results.

Noticing her tension, the doctor added gently, "But there's no need to panic. Conception depends on fate—let nature take its course."

"Thank you, Doctor."

......

Junhe Law Firm.

Lu Zhilü leaned back in his chair, massaging his temples after wrapping up a high-stakes client meeting.

His phone buzzed.

He glanced at the screen—and his expression darkened instantly.

Bohan: Heard your sperm quality's subpar?

Lu Zhilü: ?????? Who told you that??????

The question marks practically vibrated off the screen.

Bohan: Don't get defensive. Modern medicine can work wonders with proper treatment.

Lu Zhilü stabbed the call button.

"Who started this rumor? I'll sue them into oblivion!"

Bohan held the phone away from his ear. "Such vehemence. Could there be truth to it?"

"Bullshit! I'm prime donor material!"

"Words mean nothing. Show me the lab reports."

"...Are you even human, Bohan?"

"Weren't you the one threatening to cut ties?"

Lu Zhilü ground his teeth. "Before we do, hand over the slanderer!"

"Your wife mentioned it to mine."

"What?!"

The phone nearly cracked in his grip.

Nanchu was telling people he was infertile?

Bohan warned, "Don't reveal your source."

"Tell Qiaoyu to keep her mouth shut! If this leaks, she's getting sued too!"

"Relax. She's not as chatty as your wife."

The call ended. Lu Zhilü's fist slammed onto the desk.

He immediately pulled up the hospital appointment system.

The andrology department had afternoon slots available.

A black Cullinan roared out of the garage.

Nanchu had just hailed a taxi back to the magazine office when her phone rang.

Caller ID: Bastard Lu.

"Where are you?"

"At work. Why?"

A weighted pause.

"Be home tonight. On time."

"I'm always punctual."

"We need to talk."

"Can't we discuss it now?"

"Tonight."

The line went dead. Nanchu stared at her phone, baffled.

Lu Zhilü glared at the confirmed appointment notification, jaw clenched.

Time to settle this infertility rumor once and for all.
###Chapter 415

Evelyn Langley sensed something was off these days.

Adrian Klein had always maintained his weekly night jogging routine without fail.

That day, hearing noises in the hallway, she opened her door only to catch a glimpse of him swiftly retreating into his apartment.

Stranger still, he usually took one or two days off each month, but lately, she hadn’t seen him step outside at all.

The most bizarre incident happened two days ago. She distinctly noticed his door slightly ajar, only for it to snap shut the moment she opened hers.

Evelyn: "?"

She couldn’t make sense of it.

Had she somehow offended him?

Racking her brain yielded no answers.

If only she could corner him and demand why he was avoiding her like the plague.

Meanwhile, Adrian stood by his window.

He listened to the fading sound of her footsteps, counting the seconds.

Only when he saw her leave the neighborhood did he withdraw his conflicted gaze.

He wasn’t avoiding her on purpose.

He just...

Had no choice.

The first dream could’ve been dismissed as a fluke.

But after running into her outside the cafeteria, it happened again that night.

More explicit. More intense. More shameful.

In the dream, he’d been a ravenous beast, taking her ruthlessly despite her pleas.

Upon waking, every detail remained horrifyingly vivid.

He yanked off the sheets and mechanically stuffed them into the washing machine.

How could he have such dreams?

How could he defile a woman like that?

Yes, defile.

This overwhelming self-disgust made facing Evelyn impossible.

What if it happened again when they met?

How could he face himself?

Elsewhere, Beatrice Merouin delivered several meals to her son.

Returning home, she whispered to her husband, "He’s been in low spirits lately, eating half as much. Might be heartbreak."

Gregory Hill: "..."

......

With their research progressing smoothly, Evelyn and her two colleagues grew closer.

At noon, they decided to eat off-campus for a change.

On their way back, discussing afternoon plans, Hannah Flores suddenly stopped.

Evelyn and Liam Kalmien paused in confusion.

Liam: "What’s wrong?"

"Look over there..." Hannah nudged toward the campus gates, giving Evelyn a sympathetic glance. "Your ex is back."

Evelyn’s eye twitched.

Was it too late to run?

Clearly.

Nathan Evans had already spotted her, striding over with an armful of champagne roses.

Hannah coughed. "Uh... Liam, I’m thirsty. Come buy water with me?"

Liam glanced at Evelyn, then nodded.

They made a swift exit.

Evelyn didn’t bother faking a smile. "Nathan, don’t you have anything better to do?"

He froze. "Evelyn—"

"It’s been a year. Stop coming here."

He shoved the flowers into her arms. "No."

She sighed wearily. "What’s the point? You have endless options."

"But I only want you."

"Ha." Her laugh was icy. "That’s not what you said when you had your arm around Chloe Valentine at Dylan’s birthday."

"Chloe’s a good girl. I wanted to do right by her."

His own words slapped him across the face.

Eyes reddening, he choked out, "I was blind. Mistaken a pebble for a pearl."

"Now it’s too late. You’re the only one I’ve ever loved."

"Evelyn... please forgive me."

"Right here, you agreed to be my girlfriend. Give me another chance?"

She pushed the flowers back. "No. Way."

"If you’re truly sorry, stop showing up at my school."

"You only make me a spectacle."

Nathan’s displays of affection had always been self-centered.

She once mistook it for passionate devotion.

Six years later, she recognized it as pure selfishness.

He loved showering her with expensive bouquets.

Parking his sports car at the most conspicuous spot.

"Accompanying" her to lectures uninvited.

Never realizing how much gossip it invited.

"...I didn’t know," Nathan mumbled.

"Didn’t know, or didn’t care?" Evelyn met his gaze squarely.

He had no rebuttal.

"Six years, and we never truly understood each other. Let’s leave it at that."

Without looking back, she walked away.

Nathan collapsed onto a bench, face ashen.

Nearby, two figures lurked behind a tree, watching intently.
###Chapter 416

Linda Lombardi and Tyler Lombardi trailed stealthily behind Nathan Evans, ducking behind a van to peer at him.

Nathan walked closely beside a young woman, their intimate body language unmistakable.

"Mom, who's that?" Tyler whispered.

Linda gritted her teeth. "Who else? His new fling! No wonder he dumped my daughter!"

For the past month, the mother-son duo had lived lavishly at the Evans residence, with Margaret Evans indulging their every whim.

They'd grown accustomed to this gilded lifestyle.

Now that Margaret was thoroughly worn down, they decided to make one final extortion attempt.

"Fifty million!" Linda demanded brazenly.

Margaret's face darkened instantly. "In your dreams!" She turned on her heel and left.

From that moment, Margaret cut off their financial support completely.

"Mom, how about...five million?" Tyler ventured hesitantly.

Linda clenched her jaw. "Fine!"

But Margaret wouldn't even answer their calls.

Desperate, they turned their attention to Nathan.

However, Nathan's constant security detail forced them to resort to stalking.

Just as Linda prepared to approach, her phone rang sharply.

"What?!" she snapped.

Chloe Valentine's tearful voice came through. "Mom, why haven't you visited me?"

A nurse took over. "The patient is emotionally unstable. Family presence is required immediately."

Linda agreed reluctantly.

"Annoying," Tyler grumbled. "Throwing tantrums in a VIP suite."

Linda sighed. "Exactly. All our efforts are for her sake."

At the hospital, Chloe burst into tears upon seeing them.

Linda jabbed her forehead. "Stop crying! We're fighting for your place in the Evans family!"

Chloe's eyes lit up. "Did Nathan agree?"

Her mind raced with visions of aristocratic living.

For weeks, she'd agonized over memories of her pregnancy.

Back then, she'd taken her health for granted, acting recklessly. Now she could slap herself with regret.
###Chapter 417

She should have known better—impulse was the devil.

If only she had swallowed her pride and focused on her pregnancy, the baby wouldn't have...

Linda Lombardi frowned. "Nathan Evans won't budge. We can't even get a meeting."

Tyler Lombardi's blood boiled.

Five million was within reach, but they'd foolishly demanded fifty instead. Were they trying to sabotage themselves?

He shot his mother a sidelong glance, irritation flashing in his eyes.

Still, he asked, "What now?"

Linda's gaze turned ruthless. "We're broke anyway. Might as well burn everything down."

At dawn the next day, they returned to Evans Corporation.

The main entrance was tightly guarded—no chance of entry.

Then Tyler spotted a fire escape on the building's side.

The door was camouflaged by a massive advertisement, blending seamlessly into the wall.

It led straight to any floor.

But—

No elevator.

Thirty flights of stairs.

"Mom... maybe we should try something else?" Tyler swallowed hard.

Linda sneered. "Climb. Each floor is worth two hundred grand. You in or not?"

Suddenly, Tyler found his motivation.

For that kind of money, he'd crawl.

Fifty minutes later—

The pair stood gasping on the top floor.

Linda whipped out a wrench and smashed the fire door open.

Under stunned stares, she wailed: "Nathan Evans, you heartless bastard! You made my daughter miscarry! Give us justice or I'll die right here!"

"Someone judge this! Can rich people just trample widows and orphans?"

"If you won't let us live, I'll jump and haunt you forever!"

Her cries echoed down the empty hallway.

Too bad the soundproofing was excellent—no one else heard.

This floor housed only Nathan's inner circle. Who'd dare speak up?

Linda kept screeching.

Secretaries exchanged uneasy glances.

Until—

She actually climbed onto a windowsill.

Panic finally set in.

She couldn't die here.

An office door swung open.

Nathan stood there, cold eyes fixed on Linda perched by the window and Tyler's half-hearted attempts to "stop" her.

"Finished performing?"

"You want money?"

"Get in."

He turned without another word, his back rigid with finality.
###Chapter 418

Finally, it was time to talk money!

Linda Lombardi quickly jumped down from the windowsill.

The so-called window was just a palm-sized vent, too small even for a child to crawl through.

Jumping to her death was out of the question.

She had done it purely to draw attention and force Nathan Evans to show himself.

Fortunately, her goal was achieved.

But what she didn't know was that as she and her son eagerly headed toward Nathan's office, the assistant behind them flashed a barely detectable look of pity.

......

This was Linda and Tyler's second time entering the luxurious office.

The gilded decor still dazzled them.

Linda got straight to the point: "Five million."

Nathan raised an eyebrow. "I thought you wanted fifty?"

Linda cursed inwardly. Of course she wanted fifty, but would he give it?

She'd learned her lesson these past few days—the rich splurged on luxuries but were stingy with the poor.

They'd drop millions on racehorses or gamble fortunes without blinking, yet begrudged every penny to those in need.

Cheapskates!

What was wrong with sharing some of that wealth?!

She also understood the rich could turn on you faster than flipping a page.

Take Margaret Evans—at first she'd groveled, trying to buy them off.

Once she turned hostile? Wouldn't even take their calls.

So throwing tantrums was useless with these people.

Might even provoke them.

So Linda dropped the hysterics and laid her cards on the table.

"I've thought it over. You and Chloe were consenting adults. But you did hurt her. Compensation is reasonable—we can negotiate the amount."

Nathan smiled faintly. "Learned your lesson."

"Five million, give me a straight answer. Yes, we take the money and disappear forever."

Nathan: "I already gave Chloe Valentine three million. Another two makes five..."

"What?! You gave that—Chloe three million?!"

Linda nearly leapt from her chair.

Tyler's eyes bulged.

Chloe hadn't breathed a word!

Both were silently calculating.

Nathan said bluntly, "Leave your account number. Two million by noon."

Linda's eyes darted. "What exact time? We came all this way—best to be clear."

"Before twelve."

Linda exhaled. "Fine."

"Remember your promise, or else—"

With the windfall in sight, Linda vowed repeatedly: "Don't worry, I keep my word! Take the money and vanish!"

Tyler nodded, swallowing hard.

Five million!

He'd never seen that much money in his life.

Once they got it, first thing—make Mom buy him a luxury car. Show everyone Tyler Lombardi was somebody now!

Nathan raised a hand. "Show them out."

The assistant opened the door: "This way—"

Outside the building, mother and son were still dazed.

Not fifty million, but five was still a fortune.

Enough to last their lifetimes.

As they plotted their return to the hotel, a truck suddenly headed toward them.

At first its speed seemed normal. No one paid it any mind.
###Chapter 419

The sunlight glared harshly as Linda Lombardi strutted down the center of the road with her son Tyler in tow.

"Mom, watch out!" Tyler suddenly yanked her sleeve.

"What's there to fear?" Linda rolled her eyes. "Truck drivers are terrified of hitting pedestrians. They'll swerve."

The truck approached slowly, closing the distance.

Just as they expected the driver to brake, the engine roared violently. The vehicle accelerated straight toward them.

"Mom—" Tyler's legs buckled, his voice cracking with terror.

Linda reacted instantly, yanking her son onto the sidewalk. The truck grazed their clothes as it barreled past.

"Are you blind?!" Linda sprang up, screaming. "You accelerated when you saw us! Got a death wish?"

She stormed back into the road, hands on her hips. "You're not leaving until you pay up! Fifty grand, minimum!"

Tyler immediately collapsed onto the pavement, clutching his chest. "Mom... my heart hurts..."

The truck rolled to a stop.

The window lowered, revealing the driver's face beneath a baseball cap. A cold smirk twisted his lips before he slammed the gas pedal.

Tires screeched against asphalt.

Linda's curses died in her throat.

Tyler's eyes widened as the truck hurtled toward them again.

......

In the penthouse office of Evans Corporation, Nathan Evans stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, fingertips tapping the glass.

His phone vibrated.

"It's done?" His voice was ice.

A pause. "They're still alive."

Nathan's gaze darkened. "Why?"

"Too many surveillance cameras downtown—"

"Payment halved." He ended the call.

Turning toward his desk, a ruthless glint flashed in his eyes.

Meanwhile, the truck driver removed his cap, wiping sweat from his brow.

His phone rang.

"Intel checks out," he muttered. "Nathan Evans really wants those two dead... When do I get the rest?"

A chuckle echoed through the receiver. "Already transferred."

The driver grinned at the $50,000 notification.

This job was worth every penny.
###Chapter 420

A chilling warning came through the phone: "Keep your mouth shut, or I'll sew it shut for you."

The call ended abruptly.

The driver's hand trembled as he clutched the phone, his shirt soaked with cold sweat.

......

As city lights flickered to life, Nathan Evans stood motionless before the floor-to-ceiling window like a statue.

The last remnants of sunset faded, darkness swallowing the city whole.

His sharp profile reflected in the glass.

Suddenly, he picked up his phone and dialed a number.

"Having fun, Ethan?" Nathan's voice carried an arctic edge.

A pause on the other end. "What's your problem now?"

"Didn't Lee Ashui contact you?"

Silence stretched between them.

"So he told you. The target survived." Nathan's laugh was icy. "Pity he lacked the nerve to finish the job. Your little scheme failed."

Ethan's voice darkened. "...When did you figure it out?"

"You think you're the only one who understands people?"

Margaret Evans had cut off Linda Lombardi's financial support, yet she and her son still stayed at five-star hotels and stalked the company daily.

Impossible without backing.

"I underestimated you," Ethan chuckled.

"Why?" Nathan's knuckles whitened. "Why set me up?"

If Lee had actually killed someone, Nathan would've faced charges for soliciting murder.

With media fueling the flames, the scandal would explode.

"Rich heir hires hitman"—what a headline.

"Cold-blooded, even for you, Ethan."

"You saw through it, didn't you?" Ethan sneered.

Nathan laughed abruptly. "Because of Evelyn?"

"Brothers?" Ethan exploded. "I fucking wish I'd never met you!"

"So you tried to bury me?" Nathan struck the nerve. "Too bad. Even without me, Evelyn would never want you."

Dead silence.

"To her, you'll always just be her ex's friend." Nathan twisted the knife. "Did you really think this would change that?"

"Shut up!"

"Hit a nerve?" Nathan barked a laugh. "Look at you, Ethan Winston—brought low at last."

For someone as meticulous as Ethan, the plan shouldn't have been so sloppy.

When Nathan first noticed irregularities, Ethan hadn't even been a suspect.
###Chapter 421

Nathan Evans had never imagined that Ethan Winston, the man who always had everything under control, could lose his composure like this.

"You'd go this far for Evelyn Langley?"

He stared at the usually collected man, seeing madness in his eyes for the first time.

Ethan adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm. "Just a small favor."

"A small favor?" Nathan scoffed. "You knew exactly what kind of people Linda Lombardi and her son are, yet you handed them a weapon."

"The weapon is in your hands," Ethan met his gaze. "Whether to use it, and how—that's your choice."

Nathan clenched his fists. "You fucking planned this!"

"And if I did?" Ethan smirked. "Haven’t you always wanted to prove you’re better than me? Here’s your chance."

The air turned frigid.

"For a woman, you’d throw away your principles?" Nathan spat through gritted teeth.

Ethan’s gaze sharpened instantly. "She’s not just 'a woman.'"

She was Evelyn Langley.

The one who made him sobering soup in the dead of night.

The one who feared the dark but still walked home alone.

Nathan burst into laughter. "Spare me the act. Where were you when she was suffering by my side?"

Ethan’s fingers twitched.

"You could’ve stopped it, but you chose to watch." Nathan stepped closer. "Because you knew—only when she gave up on me completely would you have a chance."

"Shut up."

"Hit a nerve?" Nathan’s smile turned mocking. "What’s the difference between you and me? We both used her feelings."

Ethan snapped his head up. "You don’t deserve to even speak her name!"

"Getting defensive?" Nathan raised a brow. "What if she finds out about your schemes—"

"She won’t."

"Of course I won’t tell." Nathan leaned in. "I’ll watch her fall for you, and then—"

Ethan grabbed him by the collar.

Their eyes locked, tension crackling between them.

"You think this is how you win?" Nathan sneered. "Ethan, you’re naive."

He pried Ethan’s fingers off one by one. "The game has only just begun."

As he turned away, a cruel smile curled Nathan’s lips.

If this was madness, they’d drown in it together.
###Chapter 422

The screech of brakes pierced the sky.

Linda Lombardi and Tyler Lombardi collapsed in a pool of blood, their foreheads gashed horrifically.

When the truck came barreling toward them, Tyler had been throwing a tantrum on the ground. By the time he realized the danger, it was too late to dodge.

His legs turned to jelly. His entire body trembled. He couldn't even muster the strength to stand.

"Mom—"

His anguished scream echoed down the street.

At the last possible second, the truck swerved, barely grazing Tyler's body as it roared past.

Tyler sat frozen in shock, his pants soaked with urine.

The truck reversed direction and charged straight at Linda.

Linda shrieked and scrambled away like a frightened mouse, but the truck pursued her like a cat toying with its prey.

She stumbled blindly, her hair wild, looking like a madwoman.

Finally, she crashed headfirst into a tree trunk. Blood streamed down her face.

Only then did the truck speed away.

"Mom..." Tyler crawled toward her on hands and knees, his palms still damp with urine.

Linda's eyes remained shut, blood gushing from her forehead.

"Wake up!"

After what felt like an eternity, Linda's eyelids finally fluttered open.

"We..." She suddenly remembered something and began trembling violently. "We have to go. Now!"

"Why?"

"Do you want to die?!"

Tyler finally snapped out of his daze and helped his mother flee in panic.

After getting patched up at the hospital, Tyler's voice shook. "Mom, I'm scared..."

"Nathan Evans is trying to kill us!" Linda hissed through gritted teeth.

"Should we call the police?"

"It's useless. There were no cameras." Linda let out a cold laugh. "And our extortion scheme would be exposed."

"But we haven't gotten the money yet..."

"He was never going to pay!" A sinister glint flashed in Linda's eyes. "Still... we didn't walk away empty-handed."
###Chapter 423

In the hospital room, Chloe Valentine waited eagerly for good news from her mother and brother. Instead, she was met with two grim faces.

"Hand over the three million Nathan gave you," Linda Lombardi demanded, arms crossed. The bandage on her forehead stood out starkly.

Chloe's pupils constricted. "Mom, your head—"

"All thanks to you!" Linda snapped. "If it weren't for you, we wouldn’t have clashed with Nathan!"

The mask of maternal warmth had finally slipped.

Tyler rolled up his sleeves, revealing bruises. "Nathan hit us hard. You didn’t warn us—was this your plan all along? Keep the money for yourself?"

"I didn’t!" Chloe’s voice trembled. "How could I have known he’d—"

Linda sneered. "After being with him so long, don’t play innocent."

Tyler grabbed her hospital gown. "You’re paying our medical bills. Nathan admitted he gave you three million!"

Chloe bit her lip. "I only have twenty thousand left..."

"Bullshit!" Linda yanked the blanket off. "Where’s the card? Here? Or here?"

She knew her daughter too well—just as she’d known her younger self.

Chloe tried to stop her, but Tyler shoved her back onto the bed.

"Stay put! We nearly died for you. Compensation is the least you owe us!"

Linda ransacked the room until she found a bank card hidden in the backpack’s lining.

"Got it!"

Tyler’s eyes gleamed.

"Give it back!" Chloe struggled to get up. It was her last lifeline.

The three million had dwindled to just over a million.

Tyler shoved her hard. "You hid it well!"

Linda dragged her son toward the door. "Why waste words? My daughter, my money!"

"Mom! Please don’t go..." Chloe staggered into the hallway, her voice breaking. "Take it all... just don’t leave me..."

Only retreating footsteps answered her.

Chloe collapsed to the floor, tears streaming.

At the Evans Group’s penthouse, Nathan received the update. A cold smile curved his lips.

He dialed the hospital director. "Freeze her accounts."

"But Miss Valentine’s treatment—"

"Need me to repeat myself?" Nathan twirled a pen. "You know what to do."

That evening, the head nurse entered Chloe’s room with a bill.

"Miss Valentine, you’re discharged."

Chloe stared blankly out the window. "I’m waiting for him."

"Extended stays require a deposit." The nurse placed the form on the bedside table. "Please settle this promptly."
###Chapter 424

"Payment?" Chloe Valentine's fingers trembled slightly. "It's always been on auto-pay."

"I'm sorry, your account has been frozen."

"Frozen? Who did this?"

"The account holder personally requested it."

Chloe suddenly laughed, tears streaming down her face.

"Nathan Evans, you're ruthless."

After over a month in the hospital, Chloe was finally discharged.

She stood at the entrance, the sunlight stinging her eyes.

......

Nathan ended his meeting early today.

"Take me home," he ordered the driver curtly.

Outside the car window, the sky darkened as storm clouds loomed low.

He hated this kind of weather—humid and suffocating.

The car screeched to a sudden halt as they entered the gated community.

Nathan lurched forward, nearly hitting his forehead on the front seat.

"What happened?" His voice was icy.

"Sorry, Mr. Evans," the driver stammered. "Someone ran out in front of us..."

Nathan looked up.

Through the rain, a frail figure stood before the car.

Chloe was drenched, her white dress clinging to her like a drowned butterfly.

The driver winced in sympathy.

Nathan didn't even blink. "Call security."

Chloe had nowhere left to go.

Her mother had fled with her younger brother. Her university had already expelled her.

Nathan was her last hope.

"Nathan!" She pounded on the car window, her voice breaking. "I know I was wrong..."

Rain and tears mixed on her lips, bitter and salty.

"You're all I have left..."

The window remained shut.

Security quickly surrounded her.

"Miss, you need to leave immediately."

"I live here!" Chloe stomped her foot in frustration. "Nathan can vouch for me!"

She desperately knocked on the window. "Nathan! Please say something..."

Two guards grabbed her arms and began dragging her away.

Nathan watched coldly.

"Drive," he commanded.

The driver wiped his brow and hit the gas.
###Chapter 425

Raindrops slid down Chloe Valentine's hair as she lay discarded like a piece of trash by the back alley dumpster of the Golden Palace Club.

"Ungrateful bitch!" The security guard spat before slamming the door shut behind him.

The icy rain pelted her face, blurring the line between tears and rainwater.

......

The sky cleared.

Chloe trudged aimlessly, her soaked dress clinging heavily to her legs.

Without realizing it, she found herself standing before the gates of Harvard University.

Groups of vibrant students passed by, their laughter piercing her eardrums like needles.

Suddenly, her pupils contracted.

"Emily!"

She lunged forward, nails digging into the familiar girl's arm.

Emily Fairsprene winced in pain.

Her friends exchanged glances. "We'll wait for you at the tea shop."

Once alone, Emily finally took in Chloe's disheveled appearance. The once-radiant campus queen now resembled a homeless vagrant.

"The baby's gone..." Chloe's voice was hoarse. "He threw me out."

Understanding flashed in Emily's eyes. She'd seen this coming.

"Let me stay in the dorm for a few days," Chloe begged, fingers tightening around Emily's wrist.

"Your bed was reassigned to a freshman." Emily shook her head. "The school won't allow it."

Tears spilled down Chloe's cheeks. "Then lend me some money—"

Emily pulled out her phone. "I'll transfer you six hundred—"

"Six hundred?" Chloe's head snapped up. "Are you treating me like a beggar?"

Emily's finger froze mid-air.

Slowly, she pocketed her phone. "Chloe, you're still dreaming."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean—" Emily smirked coldly, "you deserve this."

She turned to leave.

"Emily! Stop right there!" Chloe screamed hysterically. "You're just jealous of me!"

Night deepened.

Huddled in a street corner, Chloe clutched her burning stomach.

The neon lights of the nightclub across the street dazzled her eyes.

Heavily made-up women strutted past, each carrying designer bags worth fortunes.

Once, she'd been one of them.

"Want to make some cash?" A woman with thick makeup blew smoke rings in her direction.
###Chapter 426

Chloe Valentine stood on the neon-lit street, her stomach twisting with hunger pangs.

"Got any food?" She stopped a heavily made-up woman.

The woman's red lips curled as her eyes raked over Chloe. "Come with me."

The Golden Fortune Club's sign glared under the night sky. Chloe knew exactly what kind of place this was, but starvation had devoured her reason.

Designer bags, high heels, mansions—all the things she once took for granted had become distant dreams.

She followed the woman through the gilded doors.

As long as she survived, she would make Nathan Evans and Evelyn Langley pay.

——

Reality slapped Chloe hard.

On her very first night serving VIP rooms, she learned the brutal rules of this game.

At 3 a.m., she staggered out of the private booth.

Her miniskirt hung in tatters. She clutched $50,000 in cash, her skin burning with bruises and scratches.

Three days later, she marched into the manager's office with $200,000.

"I quit."

The manager's smile vanished. "The contract states clearly—early termination requires a $5 million penalty."

Only then did Chloe notice the trap clause on the final page.

"This is predatory!" She turned to leave.

Two hulking men blocked the door.

Lighting a cigarette, the manager ordered, "Teach her some manners."

As fists rained down, Chloe heard him phone someone: "Mr. Sherwood, it's done as you instructed..."

They threw her into a pitch-black storage room.

For three days, she subsisted on a single cup of water daily.

In her starved delirium, she hallucinated returning to that gilded mansion—servants bearing silver platters, addressing her respectfully as "Miss Valentine."

Tears mixed with blood streaked down her face.

How had she fallen this low?
###Chapter 427

"Help... me..."

The hoarse plea echoed through the darkness.

Only silence answered.

Chloe Valentine curled in the corner when her fingers brushed against something cold.

She grasped the shard of broken glass with trembling hands.

The sharp edge sliced her skin. Blood snaked down her pale wrist.

She smiled.

Bang—

The door burst open.

Blinding light flooded the room.

"Damn it! This bitch trying to die?!" The manager roared before whirling on the bodyguards. "What the hell are you paid for?!"

He hastily turned to the man behind him. "Mr. Sherwood, my oversight—"

"Stop the bleeding." The man's voice cut like ice. "She won't die."

Freezing alcohol splashed over the wound.

The searing pain jolted Chloe awake.

A leather shoe tilted her chin up. "Want to die?" The man tapped his own neck. "Cut here."

Her pupils shrank.

That voice...

"It's you!" She lunged forward, clutching his trousers. "Why didn't you answer my calls?! Nathan abandoned me! I've got nothing left!"

The manager moved to intervene but stopped at the man's raised hand.

He crouched to her eye level. "Recognize me now?"

"Help me... like you did in the Maldives..."

"Help you?" A dark chuckle. "You've played your last move."

He picked up the glass shard.

A flash of cold light.

"Ah—!" Chloe clutched her face as blood seeped between her fingers.

"This," he said calmly, "is called destruction before rebirth."

Dawn broke.

A private jet pierced the clouds.

Chloe lay in the cabin, her bandaged eyes bloodshot beneath the gauze.

She would return.

Without fail.

......

Harvard University classroom.

Hannah Flores rushed in, cradling steaming pork buns.

"Evelyn! Mrs. Liu's new recipe—with shrimp!"

Leaning closer, she whispered, "Rumor says Professor Zhang went abroad. New teacher starts today..."

The bell rang.

A tall figure stepped onto the podium.

"I'm Adrian Klein." Gold-rimmed glasses gleamed as he adjusted them. "I'll be taking over Professor Zhang's classes this semester."
###Chapter 428

"Oh my god..."

Gasps rippled through the lecture hall.

"Adrian Klein? The physicist Adrian Klein?"

"Duh! Is there another Adrian Klein at Harvard?"

"..."

"Help! He's substituting our class? That face should be illegal!"

Everyone appreciates beauty.

Faced with such striking features, no one could resist stealing a second glance.

Evelyn Langley was spacing out when she suddenly found the professor oddly familiar.

"Wait! Isn't that the hottie who stopped you outside the cafeteria last time?"

"Mhm."

"Holy crap! That's Adrian Klein?"

Evelyn frowned. "Didn't you see him during your interview? He was on the panel."

"Huh?" Hannah Flores scratched her head. "No, I only remember Professor Beatrice Merouin."

"Strange... Beatrice wasn't there during my interview... Morning or afternoon session?"

"Afternoon."

"That explains it. I interviewed in the morning."

"I see..."

A realization struck Evelyn, her eyes narrowing.

She remembered Isabella Evans also interviewed in the afternoon—and had specifically asked about the questions.

Beatrice had been absent in the morning but appeared in the afternoon...

Plus the recent rumor about Beatrice's team purchasing an expensive CPRT Analyzer out of pocket.

The truth about Isabella joining the research group became crystal clear.

Hah... A walking ATM.

On the podium, Adrian finished brief introductions and prepared to begin.

His light gray dress shirt accentuated his lean frame, while gold-rimmed glasses softened his sharp gaze.

He exuded an air of refined elegance.

"Professor, may I ask something?"

A student suddenly raised their hand.

Adrian nodded permission.

"You're brilliant, but you're from Physics. Can you really teach Bioinformatics well?"

He adjusted his glasses. "First, my undergraduate degree was in Applied Life Sciences. Second, the registrar evaluates faculty qualifications before assigning substitutes."

A slight smile curved his lips. "Rest assured, I'm thoroughly qualified."

The class erupted in laughter.

Even Evelyn's lips twitched upward.

Adrian continued, "As graduate students, you should focus on developing research thinking. That mindset transcends disciplines."

"Professor! Do you have a girlfriend?"

The inevitable question arrived.

Adrian remained unflustered. "Too many questions delay progress. Today we'll cover big data applications in Bioinformatics..."

The lecture proved substantial and engaging.

When the bell rang, Adrian promptly closed his notes.

"Class dismissed."

He grabbed his briefcase and strode out without ceremony.

"Damn! That abrupt?"

Hannah gaped.

Evelyn quickly packed her bag. "Hannah, I've got to go."

"Okay...?"

Before Hannah could finish, Evelyn had bolted from the room.

Hannah blinked in confusion. Since when did Evelyn move so fast?

Evelyn sprinted down the path, finally intercepting Adrian beneath the tree-lined walkway.
###Chapter 429

Adrian Klein's pupils contracted slightly, clearly not expecting to run into her here.

Evelyn Langley steadied her breathing and met his gaze directly. "Professor Klein, have I done something to offend you?"

His fingertips trembled almost imperceptibly.

She actually followed him out.

And asked so bluntly.

"...No." How could he possibly have any issue with her?

"Then why have you been avoiding me lately?"

Adrian lowered his eyelids, evading her stare.

His Adam's apple bobbed slightly.

"...Work has been busy." His voice was so quiet it was nearly inaudible.

"Did I do something wrong?" Evelyn pressed.

The man's breath hitched.

Images from those intimate dreams suddenly flooded his mind.

And the leading lady from those dreams now stood before him.

He could even catch the faint scent of shampoo in her hair.

One step forward, and he could pull her into his arms—

Adrian bit down hard on his tongue.

Was he insane?

Meeting Evelyn's clear, questioning gaze made his ears burn.

"Professor? Are you okay?"

"...Hmm?"

"You don't look well." She frowned in concern.

"?"

"Your ears are red." She pointed out.

Adrian turned his face away in a fluster. "Must be...the sunlight."

"I see." Evelyn sounded skeptical.

She took a deep breath.

"Whatever misunderstanding there was before, I'd prefer we communicate directly from now on."

Her eyes held his steadily. "I don't like guessing games."

Nor did she want to lose this important person who was both mentor and friend.

He gave a slight nod. "Alright."

"Lunch together then?"

Adrian exhaled in relief. "Alright."

......

At the other end of the cafeteria, Hannah Flores' chopsticks hovered midair.

A grain of rice fell from her gaping mouth back into the bowl.

Liam Kalmien across from her passed a napkin with distaste. "Mind your manners."

Hannah mechanically wiped her mouth. "Look over there."

Liam turned, his pupils dilating in shock.

Evelyn and Adrian sat side by side, chatting amiably.

"Don't be so dramatic." He feigned nonchalance as he shoveled rice into his mouth.

Hannah leaned in. "Isn't Professor Klein so handsome?"

"Passable."

"Is Evelyn gorgeous?"

"Hmm."

"They look perfect together, right?"

Liam rolled his eyes. "Can't even a meal shut you up?"

Hannah pouted and stabbed at her rice.

Clueless block of wood!

As lunch ended, Adrian headed to the lab.

He bid farewell at the cafeteria entrance.

After a few steps, he suddenly turned back.

Evelyn arched a questioning brow.
###Chapter 430

Adrian Klein cleared his throat, the tips of his ears tinged pink. "Professor Macmillan said... the lab always welcomes you back."

Evelyn Langley tilted her head. "When did Professor Macmillan say that?"

"Last Wednesday," he answered instinctively.

"Oh—" Evelyn drew out the syllable. "So you've been keeping that to yourself for a whole week?"

Adrian fled in defeat.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, her eyes crinkling with amusement.

The sunlight was warm, the breeze gentle.

She decided to go home and clean that afternoon.

Just as she reached the school gates, Evelyn paused.

Nathan Evans stood at the entrance, dressed in a tailored suit, holding an extravagant bouquet of blue roses.

"It's that rich heir again!"
"He switched to blue roses this time. Must've cost a fortune."
"If someone that handsome chased me, I'd say yes in a heartbeat!"

Whispers followed her.

Evelyn frowned and turned away.

She had already rejected him clearly.

Cleaning could wait.

Nathan waited for two hours before laughing bitterly at himself.

He walked toward the trash bin.

"Such expensive flowers. What a waste to throw them away."

Sophia Frackett stood before him in a white dress.

"None of your business," Nathan said coldly.

Sophia's smile froze.

She had dressed up carefully today, only to be met with indifference.

"You're right. It's none of my business," she said, quickly regaining her composure. "But I can still think it's a waste, can't I?"

Nathan smirked.

Right in front of her, he shoved the roses into the bin.

"If you want them, dig them out."

His back was unyielding as he walked away.

Sophia stared at the blue roses in the trash, a glint of intrigue flashing in her eyes.
###Chapter 431

The monthly academic presentation commenced as scheduled.

The spacious auditorium was packed with research team members.

Representatives from twenty-six groups took turns presenting their monthly findings.

Evelyn Langley sat in the third row, fingers lightly tapping her knee.

With Professor Eleanor Roland still abroad, their team had no faculty advisor present today.

"Next, we'll hear from Professor Beatrice Merouin's research group," the moderator announced.

Victor Dimucci stepped onto the stage with steady confidence. The projector flickered to life.

"Our team has made groundbreaking progress in nanomaterials this month."

He displayed a chart. "Particularly noteworthy is Audrey Escent's first-authored paper published in Advanced Materials."

The room erupted in murmurs.

Advanced Materials was a top-tier journal in materials science.

Thunderous applause followed Victor's words.

Audrey rose gracefully, bowing to the audience.

"Thank you for Professor Merouin's invaluable guidance," she said, glancing pointedly at the faculty section.

Beatrice nodded with a proud smile.

Zachary Omelas leaned toward Victor. "What about your Nature submission?"

"Withdrawn," Victor cut him off.

"Why?" Zachary's eyes widened.

"Data inconsistencies." Victor's tone remained neutral.

Before Zachary could press further, Shane Evlanch's loud voice interrupted.

"Shouldn't Evelyn's group be next?" Shane deliberately raised his volume. "Wonder what they could possibly present?"

Evelyn organized her materials and approached the podium.

"This month, we completed lab equipment procurement and finalized our research direction."

She concisely displayed several progress charts.

Shane immediately scoffed. "That's it? Not even a core journal submission?"

Audrey covered a smirk. "Perhaps they're still laying groundwork."

"Groundwork until graduation?" Shane threw his hands up dramatically.

Hannah Flores clenched her fists. Liam Kalmien restrained her with a hand on her shoulder.

Evelyn returned to her seat without reaction.

Then the vice chancellor's phone rang abruptly.

He hurried out to take the call.

Five minutes later, he rushed back in.

His gaze swept the crowd before locking onto Evelyn.

An unmistakable excitement flashed across his face.
###Chapter 432

The auditorium fell into complete silence.

The presenting student abruptly stopped mid-sentence, casting a confused glance toward the podium. Vice President Hu Jun was frantically scrolling through his phone, his glasses sliding down to the tip of his nose.

"Ahem!" The academic dean cleared his throat loudly.

But President Hu suddenly grabbed the microphone, his fingers trembling visibly.

"Breaking news! A student from the School of Life Sciences has published a paper in Science!"

The entire room froze.

The word "Science" exploded through the crowd like a bomb.

"Did I hear that right?"
"Our university?"
"It must be Victor!"

Whispers rippled through the audience. Professor Beatrice Merouin unconsciously straightened her posture, a proud smile playing on her lips.

Audrey Escent clenched her pen so tightly her knuckles turned white. She glared daggers at Victor sitting in the front row, her mind in turmoil.

Sophia Frackett and Isabella Evans exchanged shocked looks.

"Bro!" Zachary Omelas slammed the table as he jumped up. "I knew it was you!"

Just as Victor opened his mouth to speak—

"Let's congratulate Evelyn Langley!" President Hu's voice boomed through the auditorium.

All air seemed to leave the room.

Shane Evlanch's half-raised hand froze mid-air.

"Evelyn...Langley?" someone murmured.

The auditorium erupted.

"Who's that?"
"Never heard of her..."
"A first-year grad student?"

From a corner came hushed whispers: "I heard Professor Eleanor once mentored a prodigy..."
"Also surnamed Langley..."
"Could it be...?"

Audrey's face drained of color.

Her pen clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 433

Hannah Flores' eyes widened, her throat tightening as her fingers unconsciously clutched Evelyn Langley's sleeve.

"Evelyn... There isn't another Evelyn Langley at our university, right?"

Liam Kalmien rubbed his forehead. "Are you out of your mind?"

"This is called being cautious!" Hannah lifted her chin stubbornly. "What if we got the wrong person? That'd be so awkward..."

Evelyn blinked, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Pretty sure... I'm the only one."

"Ahhh—" Hannah sprang up like a coiled spring. "My roommate is a prodigy! My bestie is a genius! Evelyn, I'm sticking with you from now on!"

Liam scoffed. "Pathetic."

"Oh, you're so impressive? Then go form your own team." Hannah rolled her eyes.

Liam turned directly to Evelyn. "When did you submit the paper?"

Hannah immediately leaned in closer.

"During summer break," Evelyn replied softly.

Liam nodded thoughtfully.

At the podium, President Hu clapped excitedly. "Would Evelyn Langley please come up and share her experience?"

Thunderous applause erupted throughout the auditorium.

Even Victor Dimucci raised his hand to clap lightly.

Zachary Omelas turned in surprise. "Senior, you..."

A rare smile touched Victor's lips. "The path of scientific research is never short of geniuses."

His gaze grew distant. "A hundred flowers blooming together—that's the true way forward."

Audrey Escent's expression, however, darkened—shifting from shock to jealousy, then twisting into bitter resentment.

Beatrice Merouin's smile vanished completely, her eyes turning icy.

Evelyn walked steadily to the stage.

"Scientific research is a lonely marathon," her clear voice rang out. "Some give up midway, others lose their way. Only by holding fast to your original intent can you reach the finish line."

With that, she bowed to the audience, her gaze locking onto Beatrice Merouin's team.

Beatrice's fingers twitched, unable to meet her eyes.

Victor's dark eyes deepened like ink.

"I have a question!" Audrey suddenly stood up.

President Hu motioned for her to speak.

"It's only been two months since the semester started. How could she possibly complete a Science-level project?"

The room fell silent.

"From topic selection to experiments, data analysis to paper writing—the normal process takes at least a year." Audrey raised her voice. "Unless—"

She pointed sharply at Evelyn. "She plagiarized!"

The air froze.
###Chapter 434

Evelyn Langley's lips curved slightly.

She locked eyes with Audrey Escent. "You're accusing me of cheating. Be specific."

Audrey sniffed. "Like bribing officials or hiring ghostwriters."

Hannah Flores immediately rushed to the front row.

She grabbed a microphone and sprinted back.

"Here, Evelyn!"

Evelyn tested the mic.

The amplification was perfect.

"First, Audrey, I don't have the funds to bribe Science's editorial board."

"Second, why would someone capable of publishing in Science ghostwrite for me?"

"You seem well-versed in underhanded tactics. Care to enlighten me?"

Audrey's face flushed crimson.

"That's slander! I've never used ghostwriters!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Did I name you?"

"You—" Audrey choked on her words.

Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "You demand proof from me? Then present your evidence first."

Audrey slumped into her seat, silenced.

Shane Evlanch opened his mouth.

Noticing the microphone in Evelyn's hand, he quietly shut it again.

Prof. Beatrice Merouin suddenly spoke up.

"President Hu, does this paper list a corresponding author?"

The room fell silent.

President Hu nodded. "It does."

"Who?"

"Professor Adrian Klein."

The auditorium exploded with murmurs.

Now it made sense.

With Adrian Klein's endorsement, everything clicked into place.

Prof. Merouin's face drained of color.

Her momentary relief vanished.

This still traced back to Prof. Eleanor Roland's connections.

Her cheeks burned with humiliation.
###Chapter 435

The lecture hall emptied like a receding tide after the departmental meeting.

Shane Evlanch's gang slunk along the walls like sewer rats, hunched and furtive.

Humiliated before the entire faculty, they wished the ground would swallow them whole.

"Evelyn, you were absolutely brilliant!" Hannah Flores' eyes sparkled like searchlights.

Liam Kalmien unconsciously straightened his posture. "Let's see anyone call our research team amateurish now."

"Next time we run into Shane's crew, I'm looking down my nose at them!" Hannah was already daydreaming about the scenario.

Her grin stretched ear to ear, brighter than a landlord counting rent money.

"Evelyn, can we have more moments like this? Slapping arrogance right back?"

"You think this is some online game?" Liam adjusted his glasses.

"Want me to slap you next?"

Hannah glared at him, cheeks puffing like an angry chipmunk.

......

Isabella Evans drifted home in a daze.

"Oof—"

She nearly collided with Margaret Evans carrying a bowl of bird's nest soup.

"Walking around like a ghost... Don't forget tomorrow's blind date with Roger. Stanford graduate, multiple Science Citation Index publications..."

"Evelyn Langley got published in Science." The words tumbled out.

"What science?" Margaret frowned. "Why bring her up?"

"The journal Science. Capital S." Isabella's voice tightened.

Margaret's spoon clattered against the porcelain bowl.

......

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Evelyn gathered her lecture notes, heading for the dining hall.

She nearly collided with Adrian Klein at her doorway.

They froze simultaneously.

"Morning, Professor." Evelyn recovered first.

"Morning." Adrian's ears pinked. "Campus-bound?"

"Breakfast first."

"Join me?"

"Sure."

Walking beneath the elms, Adrian remarked, "The university posted your achievement online."

"Only possible with your lab access." Evelyn kicked a pebble. "And you as corresponding author."

Adrian did carry some weight with Science's editors.

"Preparation meets opportunity."

Their shadows lengthened in the dawn light.

Since that candid conversation, Adrian no longer avoided her.

As for whether those dreams still came...

Only the frequently changed bedsheets on his balcony knew for certain.
###Chapter 436

The cicadas' shrill cries pierced the summer air.

Air conditioning units hummed relentlessly, pumping cool relief throughout the city.

Evelyn Langley sat cross-legged on the sofa, her laptop balanced on her knees as her fingers danced across the keyboard.

The sweet chill of watermelon lingered on her tongue.

Her phone buzzed abruptly.

Sophia Laurent's name flashed on the screen.

"It's Saturday! No classes today. You sure you don't want to go out?"

Evelyn glanced at the blinding sunlight outside.

"Sophia, spare me. This heat... I'm not stepping foot outside."

"Don't you want to shop for some cute outfits?!"

"I'll order online."

"What about skincare? You need to test products in person!"

"No need. I stick to my usual brands."

A frustrated growl came through the phone.

"Fine! What about groceries? Fresh produce? You have to leave for that!"

Evelyn shrank deeper into the sofa.

"Delivery works just fine."

Dead silence.

A realization struck Evelyn.

"Are you bored because work's slow?"

Sophia exhaled dramatically.

Evelyn frowned.

This wasn't like her.

"What happened to all those guys in your contacts?"

The old Sophia would rather do face masks than brave the scorching sun for shopping.

Teeth-grinding noises crackled through the speaker.

"Don't even ask..."

Sophia lay on the spa bed, glaring at the ceiling.

She never should've trusted that idiot Julian Roscente.

He'd asked for her passcode under the guise of checking her phone.

Then immediately visited adult sites.

Her phone froze instantly from malware.

Julian swore he could fix it.

She'd been naive.

By the time her facial ended, the device was completely dead.

Even the SIM card fried.

"Sorry! I really thought I could fix it! This virus was next-level though... Want me to buy you a new one?"

Sophia clenched her fists.

If they weren't at the Roscente estate, she'd punch him.

Mrs. Roscente had just gifted her a priceless jade bracelet.

And booked this luxury spa package.

She had to endure.

"Just drop it."

Julian kept rambling.

"My bad. I'll get you the latest model tomorrow."

"I said stop."

"No, I owe you. Though ten new phones couldn't replace those chat histories—"

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

"All those puppies and wolves in your DMs... gone forever?"

Sophia inhaled sharply.

She would murder this bastard one day.
###Chapter 437

"Ugh, what terrible luck." Sophia Laurent glared at her phone's spiderweb-cracked screen, shaking her hand in irritation.

"Out with the old, in with the new." She carelessly curled her crimson lips. "The number's still good. Just need a new SIM card."

Men always contacted her first anyway.

Since when did Sophia Laurent need to make the first call?

Julian Roscente's expression darkened.

Sophia snatched back the ruined phone. "Touch my things again and I'll chop your hands off."

Her stilettos clicked sharply against the floor as she strode out without a backward glance.

Her Porsche was already waiting at the entrance.

Julian chased her into the courtyard. "That number's tacky! All eights? Let me get you a 666 repeating sequence instead!"

"Eights are unlucky?" Sophia nearly laughed in disbelief. "Are you brain-dead?"

"Ever heard 'seven means rising, eight means falling'? Or 'the eighteenth level of hell'?"

"Get lost!" She slammed the car door. The engine roared as she sped away.

Julian stomped his foot in frustration.

"Ungrateful! That's a collector's number people beg for!"

On the second-floor balcony, Penelope Ashcroft leaned against the railing, thoroughly entertained.

Mrs. Watson hesitated. "Miss Laurent seems rather..."

"Exactly as she should be." Penelope admired her fresh manicure. "Men are dogs. The harder they have to chase, the more obsessed they become."

"Think those socialites stand a chance? Too easy to catch."

She winked at the housekeeper. "Know what this is called?"

"...What?"

"Being a glutton for punishment."

Mrs. Watson choked on her spit. "Madam!"

"Just stating facts. His father was the same."

"I rather admire Vivian's temper..." Reminds me of my younger self.

Mrs. Watson: "..." Should I be hearing these aristocratic secrets?

......

On the phone, Evelyn Langley endured twenty minutes of her best friend's rant, peppered with frequent "idiot" and "moron."

"You think..." Evelyn suddenly interrupted, "...he might be jealous?"

"Jealous?" Sophia froze. "Over a phone?"

"What else?"

"Why would he—"

"..." Evelyn massaged her forehead. "Never mind."

This woman had dated enough men to field a soccer team. How was she suddenly clueless?

Had the queen player finally capsized?

Or had the femme fatale suddenly turned chaste?

Sophia tried for the nth time: "Sure you won't drink with me?"

Evelyn: "Rain check~"

"Fine. I'll post for company..."

"Remember to block Julian— Hello?"

The line had disconnected.

Hopefully she'd heard that last part.
###Chapter 438

She picked up her new phone and casually snapped a photo of the living room bar. The lens focused precisely on the upside-down crystal wine glass, blurring the surroundings into soft, indistinct shapes.

Caption: Lazy summer day with nothing to do.

She tapped Send.

The phone was tossed carelessly onto the leather sofa. Barefoot, she padded toward the bedroom, her silk nightgown swaying gently with each step.

The air conditioning was set just right—no wonder Evelyn always said summer was meant for staying in.

She didn’t feel like going out either.

Julian Roscente was at the indoor surf club.

This private instructor’s schedule was packed, and he’d debated whether to keep the appointment. After a few rounds of practice, he could already feel his rapid improvement.

During a break, he instinctively checked his social feed.

"Lazy summer day with nothing to do..."

Accompanied by a photo of a wine glass.

To most, it was just another mundane post.

But who was Julian?

A seasoned charmer who’d navigated countless romantic escapades!

Lazy summer day—

Key word: lazy.
Subtext: Bored and craving company.

Nothing to do—

Key word: nothing.
Subtext: The bed’s ready, just missing a partner.

And that wine glass?

A vessel meant for red wine.

The wine doesn’t intoxicate—people intoxicate themselves.

Every word was an invitation.

"Sophia Laurent, you—"

He yanked off his surfboard, grabbed his robe, and bolted for the locker room.

The coach called after him, "Mr. Roscente, done for the day?"

"Emergency!"

"That sudden?"

"Life or death!"

Any later, and his wife might slip away!

Sophia slept until the sun dipped low.

Stretching lazily, she wandered into the living room and picked up her phone to check the results.

As expected, the responses were plentiful.

A: Same. Drinks?
B: Free lately? Me too.
C: On my way.
D: Same passcode?

A smug smile curled her lips.

But by evening, even the earliest reply was three hours old, and her doorbell hadn’t rung once.

Odd.

Clutching a glass of iced sparkling water, she headed to the foyer to check if the bell was broken.

The moment she opened the door, a dark figure suddenly loomed before her.
###Chapter 439

"Jesus—" Sophia's hand jerked, nearly spilling her coffee. "Julian, are you insane?"

What kind of person lurks outside someone's door in the middle of the night?

The moment she opened the door, he sprang up like a ghost materializing in a horror movie, startling her so badly she almost screamed.

Julian stared at her with unsettling intensity.

Sophia shivered under his gaze.

"What the hell are you—"

"When did you change the passcode?"

Last time, his fingerprint worked. This time, it was rejected.

Sophia blinked. "Right after you left last time?"

"Reason?"

"Seriously? I live alone. Should I just let anyone know my door code? That'd be an open invitation. Do I look stupid to you?"

She'd studied all those online safety guides for single women.

Changing passcodes was basic protocol.

Julian narrowed his eyes. "Just for me, or all men?"

"Not everyone. I tell my mom and Evelyn whenever I change it. Why does it matter?"

"Why change it just because I knew it?"

Sophia gaped. "Who even are you? Are we close?"

Julian: "......So if other men knew the code..."

"Instant change." Was that even a question?

Julian's expression darkened.

At least she had some sense of self-preservation.

But in her eyes, he was no different from any other man.

Sophia crossed her arms. "You need something?"

Julian glanced past her. "It's raining."

"And?"

"Not inviting me in?"

Sophia stepped aside with a sigh.

He strode in like he owned the place, toeing off his shoes and collapsing onto her couch.

Anyone would think he lived here.

She rolled her eyes. "Spit it out. I'm busy."

Julian smirked. "Busy hosting afternoon tea? Or a sleepover?"

"Shit—" Sophia's eyes widened. "You stalked my socials?"

He'd quoted her post word for word. Mortifying.

Julian shrugged. "You seemed proud enough posting it. What's wrong with reading it aloud?"

"You came here at midnight just to recite my posts? That bored?"

"Yep. Bored enough to take you up on your offer. Where are the glasses? Let's toast."

Sophia stiffened. "What offer? You're delusional."

"That post was practically begging for company. So here I am."

"......"

She'd forgotten he was a player too.

Julian's lips curved. "Where do you want to do this? Living room? Or bedroom?"

Sophia scowled. "I might be looking to play, but not with you."

"Why not?"

"Mixing business with pleasure is messy. I don't screw around with work connections."

Julian: "We don't work together."

Sophia: "We're collaborating now."

He snapped his fingers. "Collaboration requires what? Teamwork."

"Your point?"

"Mom thinks we're fighting. She saw you having lunch with another man."

Sophia frowned. "Yesterday...that was just a coworker..."

"Male?"

She nodded.

"Great. Now she's definitely misreading things. To avoid complications, we need new ground rules." He adopted a grave tone.

Sophia snorted. "Then I quit. Consider our collaboration terminated."

Julian: "?"

Since when did she play by her own rules?
###Chapter 440

"Wait...can we discuss the partnership again?"

Sophia Laurent crossed her arms with a cold smirk. "Weren't you the one who threatened to terminate the deal if I didn't agree?"

"I despise people who go back on their word. A signed contract isn't something you can just rewrite on a whim."

"Partnerships require trust. If we can't align, it's better to part ways now."

Julian Roscente shot to his feet. "Who says I'm untrustworthy?!"

Sophia cut straight to the point. "So, do you want to renegotiate terms or not?"

"...Never mind." He deflated back onto the couch.

Pride?

Did it put food on the table?

"That's more like it."

Julian muttered under his breath, "I came all this way and didn't even get a hot meal..."

"Speak up. Can't you talk straight like a grown man?"

"I said I'm starving!"

Sophia blinked, expecting insults—only to hear this.

"The mighty Julian Roscente, reduced to hunger?"

He bristled. "I waited forty minutes outside your building! Where was I supposed to eat?!"

Sophia snorted. "No one asked you to wait. Serves you right."

Julian: "!" His liver ached with fury.

In the end, Sophia made him a bowl of instant beef noodles.

Between slurps, he complained, "Couldn't you serve something decent for a guest?"

She scrolled through her phone without looking up. "Take it or leave it."

Julian: "..."

Fine. Beggars couldn't be choosers.

He drained every last drop of broth.

"...Burp!"

Sophia shot him a disgusted glance. "Finished? Then leave."

Julian sprawled on the sofa, rubbing his stomach. "Got any iced drinks?"

She narrowed her eyes. "Do I look like your waitress?"

"Why are you so difficult? Can't you be nicer?"

"No."

"..."

Julian had to raid the fridge himself.

Wow. The shelves were bare—except for the drinks section, packed to the brim.

He grabbed a cola, chugged it, and released a satisfied belch.

Sophia: "Must you be so gross?"

"Burp! Burp! Burp!"

Three deliberate repeats.

Sophia: "..."

Her glare could kill.

......

The summer afternoon hummed with cicadas.

Their bickering filled the living room.

Julian stubbornly overstayed his welcome.

Sophia's temples throbbed.

She resolved to block this nuisance from her social media.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Langley woke from her nap and graded two papers.

Her back ached from sitting. She stood to stretch.

In the kitchen, she prepared a fruit platter.

Summer fruits attracted bugs.

After peeling, she bagged the scraps tightly, planning to take them out with the evening trash.

Opening her door, she saw repairmen crowding Adrian Klein's open apartment.

Adrian emerged from the bedroom. "The bedroom AC isn't cooling either."

A repairman slapped his thigh. "Definitely the outdoor unit."

Evelyn peeked in. "Professor, AC trouble?"

He noticed her. "You're home?"

"It's the weekend."

Adrian gave a wry smile, pointing at the AC. "Broke this morning."

Sweat beaded on his forehead, his white shirt clinging damply.

Fresh from her air-conditioned apartment, Evelyn felt hot just looking at him.

"The technicians are on it. Would you...like to wait at my place? It's cool inside."

Adrian hesitated.

"Is that...alright?"
###Chapter 441

Evelyn nodded slightly. "Of course."

"Thank you."

The moment the door opened, a wave of cool air rushed out, starkly contrasting the stifling heat of his own apartment.

Adrian Klein deftly slipped into the house slippers—this wasn't his first visit.

Evelyn turned and headed to the kitchen, returning with a glass of water.

The sun slanted westward outside the window. Though she assumed he'd already eaten, she asked considerately, "Have you had lunch, Professor?"

"Yes."

"Then... would you like some fruit? It's freshly cut."

She disappeared into the kitchen again and emerged with a plate of sliced fruit.

Adrian accepted it with thanks.

Evelyn settled onto the couch, spearing a piece of honeydew with a toothpick. "When did the repairman say the AC would be fixed?"

"They need to replace a part. Probably another two or three hours."

"That's not too long. You can rest here for now. This heat is unbearable without AC..."

"Thank you. Don't trouble yourself on my account."

"Alright." Evelyn stood.

Just before entering her bedroom, she paused and glanced back. "Professor, the bathroom's down that hallway if you'd like to shower."

She pointed toward the end of the corridor.

Adrian's shirt clung to his back, damp with sweat, the outline of his muscles faintly visible. In the chilled air, the wet fabric would soon turn icy against his skin.

Cough—

Adrian choked abruptly, the piece of honeydew caught in his throat. He waved a hand hastily. "No need. I'll shower at home and come back."

"Mm." Evelyn nodded. "If you start feeling chilled, let me know. I have cold medicine."

"Alright."

Adrian took his leave.

Evelyn returned to her bedroom to continue grading papers.

Half an hour later, she closed her laptop and stretched.

With a guest visiting on a weekend, it was only proper to invite him for dinner. She opened the fridge, mentally planning the menu as she surveyed the ingredients.

The living room remained silent—Adrian clearly hadn't returned yet.

Evelyn hung her cardigan on the coat rack.

The bedroom AC had been too cold earlier, so she'd thrown on the light sweater. Now she felt stuffy again. She tugged off her T-shirt, leaving only her tank top, and reached for the loose cotton tee hanging nearby.

Adrian isn't back yet anyway...

Just as she pulled the shirt over her head, the bathroom door swung open.

Adrian stepped out, damp hair dripping, a bundle of fresh clothes in his arms.

Their eyes locked.

The air between them froze.
###Chapter 442

Adrian Klein stood at the bathroom door, his white T-shirt soaked through and clinging to his skin.

He wiped his face with his hand, droplets glinting like shattered light between his fingers.

The moment he pushed the door open, his entire body froze.

Evelyn Langley stood in the center of the living room, a black spaghetti-strap dress accentuating her slender waist.

She held a T-shirt in her hands, clearly about to change.

Their eyes met.

The air turned to ice.

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed as he swiftly turned away.

"Sorry."

His voice came out rough.

Evelyn finally snapped out of her daze, fumbling to pull the shirt over her head.

"I—I thought you weren't home..."

The tips of her ears burned crimson.

Adrian kept his back to her, water still dripping from his damp hair.

He'd intended to shower at his own place.

But the repairman was working on the AC unit outside his bathroom.

"Mind if I borrow your hairdryer?"

He fought to keep his tone even.

Evelyn nodded, then remembered he couldn't see her. "It's in that drawer," she blurted, pointing to the TV stand.

Adrian strode over, his retreating figure uncharacteristically flustered.

Evelyn fled to the kitchen like a startled deer.

She yanked open the refrigerator, cool air rushing over her.

Yet the heat in her cheeks refused to fade.

The mirror reflected her flushed face back at her.

"Need help?"

A deep voice spoke suddenly behind her.

Evelyn jumped, nearly dropping her water glass.

Adrian had changed into a dry button-down.

His hair still held traces of moisture, making it look unusually soft.

"I've got it," she stammered.

But he was already rolling up his sleeves, revealing toned forearms.

"Let me."

His gaze lingered on her scarlet-tipped ears.

The kitchen air grew suddenly thin.
###Chapter 443

Adrian Klein deftly washed and prepared vegetables in the kitchen, his movements efficient.

Evelyn Langley tied on an apron and sliced ingredients into uniform pieces with practiced ease.

Steam rose from the pot on the stove as oil sizzled in the pan.

Within half an hour, four dishes and a soup were arranged on the dining table.

Adrian pulled out a chair and served Evelyn a bowl of rice first.

"Thanks." She accepted it with a small smile.

They ate in comfortable silence, as if their earlier awkwardness had never existed.

After dinner, Adrian began clearing the dishes without prompting.

Evelyn stood by the sink, drying each plate he handed her.

Their coordination was seamless.

Until trash time—

They both bent down simultaneously to tie the garbage bag.

A dull thud.

"Ow!" Evelyn straightened up, clutching her forehead with teary eyes.

Adrian immediately leaned closer. "Sorry, I didn't see—"

Gently moving her hand aside, he inspected the red mark.

"At least it's not swelling." He exhaled in relief.

She blinked rapidly. "It's fine, doesn't hurt."

But her pink-tinged eyelids betrayed her.

Only then did Adrian realize he still held her wrist.

He released her like touching fire, stepping back two paces.

Evelyn stared before bursting into laughter.

"That amusing?" He raised an eyebrow.

"Very!" She nodded vigorously.

Shaking his head, Adrian retied the trash bag properly.

......

The AC repairman knocked on Adrian's door.

"Professor Klein, your unit's fixed. Want to test it?"

Adrian swapped his shoes, neatly returning the slippers to their rack.

The technician grinned. "Must be convenient living across from your wife like this, easy visiting—"

"Let's check the AC." Adrian cut him off.

He didn't clarify their relationship.

First, it wasn't necessary. Second, explanations might embarrass Evelyn.

In society, women always faced more scrutiny.

His only duty was protecting her from unnecessary harm.

"Payment's transferred. Thanks for your work."

As the repairman left, Evelyn's door opened the moment Adrian closed his.

"Professor, AC fixed?"

"Mhm."

"Still running tonight?"
###Chapter 444

"Want to go for a run together?" Adrian Klein suggested unexpectedly.

Evelyn Langley's eyes lit up. "Sure."

They each went home to change into workout clothes.

As night fell, streetlights flickered on one by one.

Evelyn kept pace with Adrian during the first lap.

By the second lap, her breathing grew labored.

Midway through the third lap, she gasped, "Professor... I can't... keep going..."

Adrian stopped immediately. "Are you okay?"

Her cheeks were flushed, damp strands of hair clinging to her forehead. "Just overheated."

He took the tissue she'd been using to dab her sweat. "Let's walk then."

Evelyn nodded sheepishly.

They strolled leisurely along the campus path.

Passing a convenience store, Adrian bought two water bottles. He twisted the cap open before handing one to her.

"Thank you, Professor."

Rounding the academic building, they neared the basketball courts.

A stray ball suddenly hurtled toward Evelyn.

Adrian reacted instantly—yanking her behind him while catching the ball one-handed.

"Nice reflexes, man!" Players on the court whistled appreciatively.

In athletic wear, the professor looked unexpectedly youthful.

"We're short a player. Wanna join?" someone called.

Adrian glanced at Evelyn.

She understood. "Go ahead, Professor. I'll watch."

It surprised her that the usually stern academic played basketball.

Wait—

Why was he seeking her permission?

On the court, Adrian blocked two shots consecutively upon entering.

"Holy shit! We've got a ringer!"

"Which department are you from, bro? You're insane!"

Adrian smirked. "Care to find out?"

What followed was his personal showcase.

Three-pointers, drives, slam dunks—all executed with fluid precision.

Evelyn watched, mesmerized, clapping and cheering despite herself.

After twenty minutes, their opponents waved white flags.

"Enough! We surrender!"

"Have mercy, man!"

Only then did Adrian stop, tossing the ball back.

"Hey, let's exchange contacts? We should play again."

"Which school are you in? Never seen you around before."

As Adrian scanned someone's QR code, a voice piped up: "Is that your girlfriend on the bleachers?"

He looked up—directly into Evelyn's beaming smile.
###Chapter 445

"Not yet." Adrian Klein replied calmly.

"Oh~ I see, I see!" The guys exchanged knowing glances. "Still chasing her, huh?"

He pressed his lips together in silence.

The boys shared conspiratorial smiles.

"How long have you known her?"

Adrian tapped the table lightly with his fingertips. "One year and three months."

"That long and still no progress?" One guy widened his eyes dramatically. "Dude, your game needs work!"

Adrian shot him an impassive look.

"Here, let me teach you some moves." The guy leaned in, lowering his voice. "Guaranteed to work..."

Adrian appeared indifferent, but subtly leaned forward when key points were mentioned.

......

On their way home, Evelyn Langley animatedly reenacted the scene. "That three-pointer was amazing!"

Adrian walked beside her, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Passing a pharmacy, he suddenly stopped. "Wait here."

He emerged holding a bottle of medicated oil.

"Your forehead will bruise." He pointed. "This will help it heal faster."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "That's not necessary..."

"Don't girls care about these things?"

"Girls?" She arched an eyebrow.

"Mhm." His expression remained unreadable. "My sister does."

"...Thanks." She reached for the bottle.

But Adrian had already opened the cotton swab package.

His slender fingers brushed aside her bangs with surprising gentleness.

The warmth of his touch made Evelyn's breath catch.

"It smells nice." She sniffed. "Not like medicine."

Adrian made a noncommittal sound as the swab glided over her reddened skin.

He'd deliberately chosen the floral-scented variety.

"Done." He stepped back, discarding the swab.

Evelyn touched her cooled forehead. "Thank you, Professor."

They parted ways in the hallway.

The medicated oil went home with him.

Late that night, Adrian lay in bed.

The boys' advice echoed in his mind:

"If you like her, make the first move."

"Create more opportunities to be together."

"Casual physical contact is key."

"Gentleness is your secret weapon."

Staring at the ceiling, his gaze darkened with determination.
###Chapter 446

"Only by proving your reliability will she lower her guard and willingly fall into your arms!"
"Understand?"

Adrian Klein found some logic in these words.
But one point troubled him.

Deliberately tripping for a kiss versus forcibly pinning someone down...
The former felt too staged.
The latter was outright harassment.

He believed such acts weren't expressions of love, but disrespect toward women.
Yes, utter disrespect!

Yet in his dream, he'd committed every one of these "disrespectful" acts.
Even asking shamelessly: "...Evelyn, does it feel good?"

Adrian jolted awake, sitting upright in bed while clutching his head in frustration.
Like a child caught misbehaving.

Only after prolonged silence did his breathing steady.
He moved to the wardrobe, retrieving fresh boxer briefs...

Hadn't he recovered already?
Why again...

At dawn, Vincent Macmillan arrived early at the lab.
Having left unfinished data yesterday, he came to complete it today.
If Adrian discovered this, the lecture would never end.
He'd set three alarms, dragging himself to the lab before sunrise.

"Holy shit! You're here?! It's your day off!"
His outburst betrayed his guilt.

Adrian stood by the lab bench, lifting cold eyes. "So you didn't finish yesterday's data?"
Vincent: "!"
Busted.
"Wait—why are you working on your day off? Professor, this is next-level dedication!"

Adrian responded flatly: "I've processed two datasets for you. Unnecessary then?"
Vincent instantly backpedaled: "Just kidding! Dedication's great! Marvelous!"

By noon, exhaustion drove Vincent toward the lounge.
Passing Adrian's slightly ajar door, he overheard a call:
"...Yes, sweet-glazed ribs... Two portions... Deliver to the lab before six..."

"Oho, who's bringing you meals? Girlfriend?" Vincent pounced on the gossip.
Adrian turned, presenting only the back of his head.

Beatrice Merouin hung up and dashed to the living room.
Snatching George Atlante's tea mid-sip.
She shook his shoulders excitedly:
"Two portions! Again two! Our son's seeing someone!"
George: "?"
"He ordered sweet ribs! Sweet! Know why?"
George: "...Stop shaking me..."
"It must be his girlfriend's preference! I'll cook it myself! Deliver personally!"
She stormed into the kitchen, upending the tea set in her wake.

George: "!" My Da Hong Pao!

Adrian returned home with his mother's homecooked meal.
Grabbing medicated oil and cotton swabs, he knocked on the neighboring door—

Only to receive
No response.
###Chapter 447

Evelyn Langley watched the scenery flash by outside the window, her fingers lightly tapping the armrest. She was on a high-speed train back to Linshi for her grandmother Margaret Roland's eightieth birthday celebration.

The birthday banquet was a grand affair. The three Langley brothers had begun preparations early. As the youngest generation, Evelyn was naturally expected to attend.

A week prior, she had emailed her advisor, Professor Eleanor Roland, for leave. The professor, attending an academic conference abroad, had replied with a brief approval across time zones, asking Evelyn to pass along her well-wishes to the elderly matriarch.

"Are you there yet?" Her phone vibrated with a message from her mother, Victoria Langley.

"Twenty more minutes." After replying, Evelyn gazed absently at the bustling crowd on the platform.

The train arrived on schedule. Dragging her suitcase, Evelyn stepped onto the platform and spotted her mother waiting at the exit.

"Where's Dad?" She glanced around but didn't see her father.

Victoria took the luggage, looking weary. "Your father couldn't get away."

"What could he possibly have on a Sunday?" Evelyn buckled her seatbelt, frowning at her mother.

Victoria started the car and sighed. "It's a long story..."

Three days earlier, at the Langley family estate:

Margaret Roland sat regally in the living room, her three children gathered around. The elderly woman tapped her cane. "Richard's place can't accommodate everyone. What do you propose?"

Though Richard Melville's villa was spacious, it often hosted business associates. Housing over a dozen relatives from the countryside simply wouldn't work.

Grace Deross was the first to speak up. "My apartment can take two people."

"That pigeon coop of a two-bedroom, with its garish decor? You'd be torturing them." The matriarch's tone brooked no argument. "Stay out of this."

The burden fell squarely on William Langley and Charles Lorenz.

Patricia Lorenz cut in before her husband could respond. "Mom, we just moved into Lakeside Pearl. The furniture isn't even fully set up yet." She shot a meaningful glance at William. "Didn't the third brother just finish renovating his new place?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "So it fell on us in the end?"

Victoria nodded helplessly. "Your father's scrambling to clean the guest rooms and buy supplies."

As the car entered the neighborhood, Evelyn spotted her father hauling bags of groceries into the house. Under the sunlight, his white dress shirt was already soaked through with sweat.
###Chapter 448

"My parents said they're still supporting their grown daughter at their age," Patricia Lorenz said with a gentle smile, though calculation gleamed in her eyes.

Margaret Roland's expression darkened instantly.

Patricia quickly changed tack. "I refused immediately! You're already relying on Richard and Elizabeth for care. How could we possibly ask more of you?"

The elderly woman's face softened slightly.

"That's why I didn't come to you for help. Charles and I gritted our teeth through buying all the furniture and appliances ourselves." Patricia sighed. "But now we have to host guests before everything's ready. It's so embarrassing..."

"I don't mind the shame for myself. But when relatives ask why we live in an upscale neighborhood without even a washing machine? Should we say all our money went to the house while our in-laws contributed nothing?"

"Once that gossip spreads, Charles and I can bear it. But your reputation would suffer."

"Of course, if you don't care about appearances, I'd love to have more guests!" Patricia's bright smile masked inner scorn—letting those bumpkins into her new home? Never!

Margaret's gaze flickered uncertainly.

"If the house isn't ready, we'll cancel. I won't have guests lacking basic amenities for my birthday celebration."

"You're absolutely right, Mother." Patricia feigned concern. "If only my parents could help more... Oh, I meant my own parents, don't misunderstand."

Margaret: "..." She hadn't been suspicious until now.

The matriarch pointedly ignored the hint about financial assistance.

Patricia suppressed an eye roll. Old fox!

Yet she'd accurately predicted Margaret's priorities.

Richard Melville remained silent throughout. He wasn't supposed to attend—this was a last-minute schedule change.

His wife Elizabeth mediated: "Perhaps we could host some guests at our place—"

"No." Margaret cut her off sharply. "No visitors at Richard's home."

Elizabeth retreated immediately.

Richard stood decisively. "We'll book hotel rooms. Convenient and simple."

Patricia instantly agreed. "Such a thoughtful solution!"

"Hotels?" Margaret paled. "The expense!"

"My treat." Richard massaged his temples.

"Absolutely not! You already cover our daily expenses and the banquet. We have another son—this isn't fair!"

Charles Lorenz's eyes darkened. True, Richard paid for the banquet, but he'd keep the gift money. The favors from their friends would eventually require repayment—who really benefited here?

Margaret stood firm. "They must stay with family! Otherwise the village rumors... At my age, I still have pride!"

Patricia's eyes gleamed. "I have an idea..."

All eyes turned to her.
###Chapter 449

Patricia's eyes lit up as she slapped her thigh. "Don't William and Victoria live in that lakeside villa? Perfect for hosting all the relatives from back home! Three floors plus a basement, decorated like a five-star hotel—even sleeping on the floor beats staying at some motel!"

"Not just a dozen people, we could fit twice as many!" She grew more animated. "And the villa's back gate leads straight to the wedding banquet hall. No need for taxis—just a short walk. So convenient!"

She'd completely forgotten her own home was in the same gated community.

William finally seized his chance to speak after multiple failed attempts. "Victoria and I discussed it. The relatives will stay with us."

Just three days, after all.

With Grandma Margaret's insistence and Patricia's slippery maneuvering, Victoria had no choice but to relent.

It wasn't that she looked down on country relatives. Her new novel's outline had just been approved by her editor, requiring a quiet creative space. Yet under these circumstances, compromise was inevitable.

"Don't worry, Mom. We'll take good care of everyone," Victoria forced a smile.

......

Gripping the steering wheel, Victoria told Evelyn in the passenger seat: "All the relatives moved in. Your father's hosting them, so I had to pick you up."

Evelyn buckled her seatbelt. "You're a pretty steady driver, Mom."

She remained oblivious to what awaited.

Victoria smirked proudly. "Of course! I'm a quick learner!"

......

The lakeside villa buzzed with activity.

"William, is this really your home?" A wrinkled great-aunt leaned on her cane, circling the living room. "Goodness, this must've cost a fortune!"

As Margaret's elder, she outranked even Grandma Margaret in seniority.

"Why's there bird feathers glued to this lamp?" She tiptoed to touch the crystal chandelier's feather ornaments. "Where's the switch? Let's see if it—Hmph! Just regular bulbs!"

William wiped his brow. "The feathers are decorative..."

"Then why bother if they don't light up? Wasting money!"

"..."

"This vase is lovely!" She moved to the curio cabinet. "Your grandfather collected these too, but never this fine. Must've cost plenty?"

Though toothless, her energy was boundless as she critiqued every corner.

"Xiao Wang, come here!" She beckoned her great-grandson. "Snacks! Weren't you hungry? Take whatever—your Uncle William's rich now!" She grinned at William. "Right, Willy?"

"Make yourselves at home."

The great-aunt had brought her entire clan. With free room and board plus a city excursion, why not come?

Among the three Langley brothers: eldest Richard struck gold in business, moving their parents to the city; second-born Charles secured an iron rice bowl job, marrying an official's daughter. Only William, the college graduate, became a "poor schoolteacher."

The great-aunt long believed Margaret's sons had uneven fortunes.

Until today, stepping into this villa...
###Chapter 450

This time, Julian remained uncharacteristically still, making no move to stop them.

He stood rooted to the spot, his dark eyes tracking the retreating figures of the mother and daughters. A storm brewed in those obsidian depths as a quiet resolve took root in his heart...

Ethan had just carried the barely conscious Sophia back to her quarters when a thunderous crash echoed through the courtyard.

The gates burst open.

Whirling around, he saw Julian silhouetted against the sunset, his imposing frame casting a long shadow across the threshold.

"Ethan, I've made my decision."

"My lord?" Ethan hurried forward, only to freeze at the sight of blood trickling from Julian's temple. The metallic scent stung his nostrils. "You're injured?"

It seemed Evelyn still couldn't forgive Julian's actions. Another confrontation, then.

Julian waved a dismissive hand. "It's nothing."

"I intend to publicly acknowledge the girls' lineage at my birthday banquet. You'll oversee the arrangements."

Less than a month remained until the celebration.

"You mean to legitimize the young misses?" Ethan's eyes widened. Regardless of whether the children were truly Julian's blood, this declaration alone would send shockwaves through the kingdom.

"My lord, the western court hasn't seen a female heir in a century. Announcing their status at your banquet would mean..."

It meant war.

The Emperor had decreed whichever prince first sired a daughter would become Crown Prince.

Was Julian finally making his move for the throne?

Ethan's pulse quickened with excitement. For years, the Roscente estate had endured relentless pressure from rival factions while Julian, despite his formidable talents, remained passive.

A military prodigy who commanded absolute loyalty, Julian's only weakness lay in matters of the heart—where love and hatred tangled into paralyzing indecision.

Julian understood the political ramifications perfectly. Yet court intrigue held no interest for him now.

"I've no desire for the throne. Claiming them means I can openly care for the girls and nurture our bond."

If they were his flesh and blood, why shouldn't he acknowledge them?

As for the succession, he'd make his position clear to the Emperor.

Ethan hesitated, though he wasn't entirely surprised. Then a thought struck him. "But my lord, while the young misses share your temperament, Evelyn has never actually confirmed their parentage. She likely won't consent to this."

Not once had Evelyn stated Julian fathered those children.

Were those little girls truly his?

Moreover, wouldn't unilateral action backfire spectacularly?

Given Evelyn's temperament, she'd wage all-out war against Julian!

"Evelyn's consent is irrelevant!" Julian's gaze turned glacial, his voice dripping with menace. "I must make this proclamation—unless you'd prefer to hear those girls call another man 'Father'..."
###Chapter 451

Evelyn Langley stood at her front door, double-checking the house number.

Muddy footprints covered the pale gray hardwood floor. Snack wrappers and fruit peels littered the ground. Two black shoe prints stamped the pristine white walls like savage tribal markings.

Raucous laughter erupted from the living room, resembling a disturbed hornet's nest.

She turned to her mother.

Victoria Langley forced a strained smile, her eyes conveying: You see what I mean.

"William's daughter is back!" A permed auntie rushed forward. "Graduate school at Harvard, right? Bringing honor to the Langley name!"

"You're already twenty-five?" A floral-shirted aunt scrutinized her. "My daughter had toddlers at your age."

Seven or eight relatives swarmed around her. Sunflower seed shells rained onto her shoes.

Evelyn mumbled polite responses before escaping upstairs under the pretense of using the bathroom.

Her bedroom door gaped open.

Her stomach dropped. She hurried to inspect the vanity. The jewelry box remained untouched, but the bedsheet looked trampled by elephants.

Dinner arrived via Victoria's takeout order.

Twelve lavish dishes crowded the dining table as relatives ate with greasy enthusiasm. Great-aunt Margaret picked her teeth, then froze upon seeing William Langley tie an apron.

"William!" She yanked her nephew's arm. "Since when do men enter kitchens?"

"Just clearing plates." William remained unperturbed.

"Where's your wife?"

"Finalizing a manuscript in the study."

The old woman slammed the table. "What manuscript matters more than serving in-laws?"

"Victoria's the breadwinner here." William stacked dishes with practiced ease. "I handle domestic affairs."

The rhythmic clatter of washing-up echoed from the kitchen. Great-aunt Margaret watched her nephew's efficient movements, eyes bulging.

At 10 p.m., Evelyn had just touched her pillow—

"CRASH!"

The entire house shook.

She sprinted downstairs barefoot to find two brats frozen before the entertainment center. A 65-inch LCD screen lay shattered at their feet, its spiderweb cracks glinting under the lights.
###Chapter 452

The parents arrived late, immediately scolding their children the moment they stepped inside.

"You little brat! Who said you could touch other people's things?"

"I'll break your legs!"

Then they turned to William Langley with forced smiles.

"William, kids don’t know any better. Don’t take it to heart."

"Exactly! You’re a successful businessman now. This small loss shouldn’t matter, right?"

William’s lips twitched.

In the end, he just waved it off.

His heart ached as he stared at the shattered television.

It was the latest model—cost him an entire month’s salary.

"Everyone, go home and get some rest."

The next morning, Evelyn Langley was jolted awake by noise before dawn.

Groggy, she fumbled for her phone.

5:30 AM.

Then she remembered.

She threw off the covers and rushed downstairs.

In the living room, several middle-aged women were huddled together, watching loud videos on their phones.

"HAHAHA! This is hilarious!"

"Look at this one!"

Evelyn frowned.

Her mother’s study was on the first floor. With this racket, writing was impossible.

Before she could speak, the study door swung open.

Victoria Langley stepped out, her face stormy.

The moment she saw Evelyn, her expression softened.

"Did we wake you?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I’ll go buy breakfast."

She couldn’t stand the noise.

Victoria nodded. "Be careful."

As Evelyn left, she sighed.

She turned back toward her study but was stopped by Margaret Roland.

"What time is it? Why haven’t you made breakfast?"

Victoria kept her patience. "Evelyn went to get breakfast. She’ll be back soon."

"Buying it?" Margaret’s voice rose. "What a waste of money!"

"Cooking for this many people isn’t practical."

"What’s impractical?" Margaret scoffed. "My daughter-in-law cooks for a dozen people by herself!"

She eyed Victoria up and down.

"Do you look down on us country folks?"

Victoria’s temple throbbed.

Margaret grew more agitated. "I gave you eggs as a wedding gift! Is this how you repay me?"

She recalled the things she’d heard from others.

This daughter-in-law locked herself away all day. Who knew what she was doing?

A wife who couldn’t even cook—what kind of woman was that?

Victoria took a deep breath, forcing down her anger.
###Chapter 453

"Stop making excuses!" The old woman planted her hands on her hips, her face twisted with disdain. "I'm your elder. Is it too much to ask you to make breakfast? If you refuse, I'll go straight to your mother-in-law!"

She suddenly clutched her chest, groaning dramatically—first complaining of heart pain, then claiming she was starving.

Relatives immediately swarmed around, all chiming in to scold Evelyn for being disrespectful.

Evelyn watched them coldly. She knew this game all too well—ganging up to bully someone.

"So, Aunt Margaret wants a home-cooked breakfast?" Evelyn's lips curled slightly. "I'll have William make it for you. Just wait a moment."

"Nonsense!" The old woman slammed the table. "Men earn the living, women tend the home—that's the rule passed down for generations!"

"Rule?" Evelyn chuckled. "I bought this villa. My income is triple William's. By your logic, who should serve whom?"

"Lies!" The old woman's eyes nearly bulged out of her skull. "A woman like you could afford a villa?"

Her sister-in-law quickly tugged her sleeve, whispering, "I asked last night. She really did buy it outright..."

The old woman froze as if struck by lightning.

Evelyn turned and walked straight into the study without another glance.

Aunt Margaret stood there, stunned. In all her years, she'd never met a woman who earned so much.

Her sister-in-law smirked. "If I had that kind of money, I wouldn't cook either. Why serve a man when you're rich? Would you?"

The old woman opened her mouth but couldn't utter a word.

Exactly. Who would play the housemaid when they had wealth?

......

Evelyn returned with breakfast to find the living room thick with tension. Before she could react, a loud crash echoed from the backyard.

Her heart sank.

That was William's prized garden.

Sure enough, the priceless orchid lay shattered on the ground, its delicate petals scattered. The surrounding plants hadn't escaped the destruction either.

William stood pale, his fingers trembling.

He'd spent countless sleepless nights tending that orchid, filling an entire notebook with care instructions.

Now it was ruined.

A few brats giggled nearby. "Uncle, isn't this flower pretty? We just picked it!"

Evelyn stole a glance at her father's ashen face, half-expecting him to collapse on the spot.

Years of teaching had honed William's patience. He didn't explode—but he couldn't force a smile either.

Unable to bear it, Evelyn grabbed her laptop and bolted out the door.

Just one more day.

......

Evelyn could escape, but William and Victoria couldn't.

They were family, after all. Hospitality was expected.

Otherwise, Margaret would tear the roof down.

That afternoon, Charles and Patricia "happened" to drop by. Anyone could see they'd come for the drama.

Charles, at least, had some decency—he tried to leave after a quick greeting.

But Patricia yanked him back, her eyes sharp.

She toured the villa with a bright smile, exchanging pleasantries with every relative.
###Chapter 454

Patricia Lorenz stood over Victoria Langley in her stilettos, looking down with disdain.

She glanced around the room with visible disgust, running a finger along the coffee table before recoiling dramatically. "Ugh, there's enough dust here to write in."

Victoria's knuckles turned white as she clenched the cleaning rag.

She'd wiped that table clean just this morning.

The elderly aunt's grandson was scattering snack crumbs everywhere, but Patricia pretended not to notice.

"Darling sister-in-law," Patricia drawled, "With Mother's grand birthday tomorrow, do you really want our guests thinking the Langleys live in squalor?"

She suddenly grabbed a towel from the couch, pinching her nose. "This smells moldy! Why haven't you thrown it out?"

"Put that down!" The elderly aunt rushed over to snatch back her face towel.

Patricia's expression froze.

Charles Lorenz discreetly tugged her sleeve.

"Don't touch me!" She shook off her husband and turned back to Victoria with a sneer. "I'm trying to help you. Tomorrow's guests are all distinguished people. Any embarrassment reflects on the entire Langley family."

Victoria suddenly smiled.

"You're absolutely right, Patricia." She slowly peeled off her rubber gloves. "Since you're so concerned about cleanliness, why don't you mop the floor for me?"

She moved toward the mop.

Patricia's face paled. "Oh! I just remembered—Mother asked me to finalize the menu!"

She dragged Charles out in a hasty retreat.

......

The birthday banquet finally ended.

William and Victoria sighed in relief after seeing off the last guests.

But when they returned home, the living room lights blazed brightly.

The elderly aunt's family lounged on the sofa watching TV.

"A-Aunt?" William stammered. "The village shuttle—"

"Margaret insisted we stay longer." The aunt cracked melon seeds, letting shells rain onto the carpet. "How could we refuse such hospitality?"

Victoria's vision darkened.

......

Evelyn Langley had just stepped inside when Hannah Flores' urgent message arrived.

Ignoring the noisy living room, she hurried upstairs.

Her experiment data had errors, but thankfully she'd brought backup files.

Then she froze in the doorway, blood turning to ice.

Her desk had been ransacked.

The laptop sat askew.

And worst of all—

The locked drawer containing her research data stood empty.
###Chapter 455

Evelyn Langley strode toward her computer.

Her room was equipped with high-definition surveillance cameras.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard, pulling up the day's footage in seconds...

When she zoomed in, the furtive figure was unmistakably Margaret Roland's precious grandson.

Evelyn stormed downstairs, her face icy. In the living room, the elderly woman was engrossed in a TV show while the boy's parents lounged on the sofa—one munching an apple while scrolling through short videos, the other sprawled with legs crossed, gaming.

The brat was on tiptoe, trying to yank down another framed puzzle belonging to William Langley.

"Stop!" Evelyn lunged forward and snatched the artwork. "You went into my room? Where are the documents from my desk? Hand them over now, and we can forget this."

Her voice was glacial.

At six years old, the brat already knew how to manipulate situations.

Seeing Evelyn's steely glare, his eyes darted craftily—

"Waaah!" He suddenly wailed at the top of his lungs.

"Oh, my sweetheart! Who hurt you? Tell Mommy!"

"Daddy's here! Let's see who dares touch you!"

The phone-absorbed couple sprang up instantly.

The woman clutched the boy to her chest while the man stepped forward, fists clenched like a boxer.

They'd heard Evelyn the moment she spoke.

But they'd pretended not to, only "reacting" when the waterworks started.

"Evelyn, you're his elder! How dare you bully a child? Have you no shame?" The woman played victim first, glaring as if Evelyn had struck her son.

"I just want my belongings back." Evelyn's smile was razor-thin. "If that's bullying, you two must be experts."

"What's that supposed to mean?" The woman's voice sharpened. "You lose something and immediately blame my son?"

Hurried footsteps sounded from upstairs. William Langley and Victoria Langley rushed over.

"William! Your daughter accused my boy of theft. You'd better explain yourself!" The man, emboldened by seniority, addressed him by name.

William's expression darkened—a rare sight. "Uncle, must you jump to conclusions? You protect your child; I protect mine."

"Discipline is my prerogative, not yours." His tone shifted. "But I trust Evelyn doesn't make baseless accusations."

The man faltered. William had been tolerating their behavior for days—this sudden firmness caught him off guard.

Victoria wordlessly moved to shield her daughter.

Seeing this, the woman plopped onto the floor, slapping her thighs dramatically. "My son is an angel! So what if he took something? Just some stupid papers!"

"You rich people think you're so high and mighty! Picking on a child! Look how terrified he is—he's going to Harvard someday!"

Evelyn's lips curled. "Funny. I never mentioned papers."
###Chapter 456

The woman's face turned deathly pale.

William Langley and Victoria Langley stomped their feet in frustration—

"Those documents in Evelyn's room contain classified research data for national-level projects! Our Evelyn has always been meticulous. If she says your son took them, she must have proof. You'd better return them immediately!"

The woman squared her shoulders defiantly. "Who does Evelyn Langley think she is? I'm digging in my heels today! Whether my son took them or not, I refuse to hand anything over!"

Evelyn didn't waste time arguing. She dialed 911.

The woman scoffed.

Who was she trying to scare?

Just a few worthless papers—the police wouldn't bother with such nonsense!

Thirty minutes later, four officers filed in.

"We received a report about stolen classified documents. Which one of you is Evelyn Langley?"

The woman immediately plastered on a smile. "Officers, it's just kids fooling around with some scrap paper—"

"I'm the one who called." Evelyn stepped forward, handing over her phone. "This surveillance footage clearly shows the theft."

She retrieved her credentials from her bag. "I'm a researcher at Harvard University's National Key Laboratory. The stolen materials contain raw data from a gene-editing experiment involving national security."

She bowed deeply. "Please recover the documents at all costs!"

The officers' expressions darkened instantly.

Harvard's National Key Laboratory!

Gene-editing!

This was no trivial matter.

"Rest assured, Dr. Langley. We'll form a task force immediately!"

The woman gaped in shock.

How did worthless papers suddenly become state secrets?

Her legs trembled, but she stubbornly refused to back down.

The elderly Margaret Roland, silent until now, suddenly lunged forward and slapped her grandson across the face with full force.

SMACK!
###Chapter 457

"Didn't I warn you before we left? Don't touch other people's things! Were my words just hot air to you? Hand it over now! Looks like you need a trip to juvie to straighten you out, you little brat—"

The elderly woman's palm descended with startling speed.

A sharp slap echoed through the living room.

The child froze in shock.

His parents stood dumbfounded.

Evelyn Langley's pupils contracted slightly.

"Waaah—Grandma hit me! I'm telling Grandpa!" The brat wailed dramatically, snot and tears smeared across his face.

"I didn't take it! It's not with me!"

"Still lying?" The old woman trembled with rage.

"I won't give it! Never!"

"How dare you!" She grabbed a feather duster and aimed for his backside.

The father rushed to intervene while the mother stomped helplessly—neither could stop her.

"You old hag—why don't you just drop dead!"

The grandmother swayed, nearly collapsing from fury.

Only when the police officer stepped in did the chaos finally cease.

Sniffling, the brat retrieved a document folder from the shoe cabinet's hidden compartment.

Officer: "Miss Langley, could you verify?"

Evelyn flipped through the contents. "My research notes. All accounted for."

"Glad it's returned safely."

She turned to the parents. "My room has a security lock. He climbed in through the balcony. Have you considered what would've happened if he'd fallen from the second floor?"

The couple turned ghostly pale.

The brat cowered silently in the corner.

That night, the great-aunt's family packed their bags in haste.

William Langley gazed at the darkened sky outside. "Must you leave now? Morning would be safer."

The great-aunt shook her head. "You're too trusting... Be more cautious from now on."

William frowned. "Cautious of whom?"

......

A long-missed tranquility settled over the Langley residence.

At dawn, Victoria Langley summoned professional cleaners.

Three hours later, the villa gleamed anew.

Evelyn stepped out under an umbrella.

Her thoughts lingered on the rare Neurosurgical Atlas at the West Street antique bookstore. She'd only finished the first half last time—today was for completing it.

But after five thorough searches between the shelves...

The shopkeeper apologized, "It was sold yesterday."

"I thought it wasn't for sale?"

"The buyer was the owner's army buddy. An exception was made."

Raindrops thickened.

Evelyn scoured every nearby bookstore without success.

Under the eaves, she stared into the relentless downpour, lost in thought.
###Chapter 458

The rain grew heavier.

Evelyn Langley stood at the bookstore entrance, frowning at the downpour.

She checked her wristwatch. Only twenty minutes remained before her lunch date with Victoria.

It seemed she'd have to make a run for it in the rain.

Then her gaze caught on a figure sheltering outside.

The man stood under the eaves, shielding his forehead as he looked around.

Evelyn's heart skipped.

She pushed open the door, rainwater immediately dampening her shoes.

"Daniel?"

The man turned. Raindrops slid down his hair.

"Evelyn?"

Daniel Melville's eyes widened in surprise.

His white T-shirt clung to his skin, thoroughly soaked.

Evelyn quickly pulled tissues from her bag. "Dry off before you catch cold."

"Thanks." He accepted them. "Still taking care of people, I see."

They decided to eat at the adjacent mall.

Evelyn texted Victoria that she'd run into family and wouldn't make lunch.

The private dining room carried a faint sandalwood scent.

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, rain fell in sheets.

A server brought two steaming teacups.

Evelyn cradled hers, studying her cousin through the rising steam.

They'd been closest as children.

Daniel always brought her treats—sometimes chocolates, sometimes jelly cups.

She remembered when she'd failed a monthly exam. He'd skipped class to comfort her, bringing her favorite strawberry cake.

Then they grew up.

She focused on romance. He pursued his career.

Later, she became trapped in that toxic relationship while his startup collapsed under debt.

Each struggling through life's mire, they gradually lost touch.

"Evelyn?"

Daniel's voice pulled her back.

"You spaced out."

She smiled. "I was remembering all the snacks you used to bring me."

"Then do you recall when you bombed that math test and I—"

"Brought strawberry cake!" they said simultaneously.

Shared laughter dissolved the years between them.

"You haven't changed much," Daniel observed.

Evelyn's eyes grew warm.

Those six years had drained nearly all her passion.

She'd thought her old self was lost forever.

"You have," she said softly.

Daniel rubbed his chin. "Gotten rough around the edges?"

"Taller."

In her memories, he'd been a lanky teen. Now broad-shouldered and long-limbed, his features carried a new steadiness.

But when he smiled, his eyes still held that familiar light.
###Chapter 459

Exquisite dishes soon covered the dining table.

Daniel Melville's phone kept vibrating, forcing him to answer call after call to handle company matters.

Finally hanging up the last call, he gave Evelyn Langley an apologetic look. "I was too busy yesterday to properly catch up with you."

"Understandable." Evelyn smiled softly.

As the only son of the Melville family, Daniel had been burdened with high expectations since childhood. Now, he carried the weight of the family business on his shoulders.

"I heard you're pursuing your master's at Harvard? I have business in Boston too. Call me anytime if you need help—same number as before."

"Still saved in my phone." Evelyn nodded. "Thanks, Daniel."

"Since when have you been so formal with me?" He raised an eyebrow.

"Call it maturity." She playfully blinked.

Daniel chuckled.

"What industry are you in now?"

He picked up a piece of fish. "Co-founded a smart home renovation company with friends. Basically, we use AI to upgrade traditional home design."

With rapid technological advancements, smart homes were gaining traction, but market acceptance remained limited.

A computer science graduate, Daniel had chosen this field to apply his expertise.

Seeing Evelyn's slightly puzzled expression, he didn’t elaborate further.

"How’s business?"

"Nothing comes easy when you’re starting out." He sighed. "New concepts take time to catch on. We’re barely scraping by."

Evelyn assumed it was just the usual startup struggles.

Until—

Returning from the restroom, she accidentally overheard Daniel’s hushed voice on the balcony:

"Mr. Wang, after all these years of partnership, you know my character. We’re just facing temporary cash flow issues..."

"Give me three more days—the final payment will be there. Please extend the deadline..."

His back was hunched, exhaustion lacing his words.

The once-ambitious young man now seemed weighed down by reality.

Evelyn quietly retreated to her seat.

When the bill came, Daniel had already regained his composure. "Let me drive you home."

"Sure."

...

The black sedan stopped in front of the villa.

"I have another meeting, so I won’t come in." Daniel bid a hurried farewell.

William Langley stepped outside at the sound of the engine. "Was that Daniel?"

"Yeah. We ran into each other and had lunch." Evelyn linked arms with her father.

"That boy... He barely visits since taking over the company. He handled all the arrangements for the birthday banquet—really stepping up as the family heir."

Entering the living room, Evelyn’s eyes brightened at the refreshed space.

She collapsed onto the sofa with a contented sigh. "Finally livable again."

"Of course." William chuckled. "Your mother personally supervised three cleaners all afternoon—every corner is spotless."
###Chapter 460

"Where's Mom?" Evelyn Langley glanced around the room.

William Langley kept his eyes glued to the TV screen. "She was just watching her show on the couch."

The study door burst open.

Victoria Langley rushed out clutching her phone, cheeks flushed, eyes blazing with excitement.

"It's happening!"

William looked baffled. "What's happening?"

Evelyn blinked. "Is the kitchen on fire?"

Victoria took a deep breath, her fingers trembling slightly. "My new book!"

A month ago, Seven-Day Tales had flopped at launch.

Originally titled The Lantern, the publisher insisted on changing it, claiming the original name lacked appeal.

First-day sales totaled a dismal 72 copies nationwide.

The number kept Victoria awake all night.

After years of silence in children's literature, her return to the thriller genre came with the publisher's highest advance—a seven-figure deal secured by editor Simon Croix against all odds.

The market's rejection felt like a punch to the gut.

"Maybe I should retire," Victoria muttered, staring blankly at her computer.

William could only make her tea in silence.

For days, she couldn't even open her writing software.

Doubt crept in—had she lost touch with modern readers?

Today's publishing world demanded social media presence, viral marketing, and preexisting fanbases.

Victoria didn't even have a Twitter account.

Then Simon called.

"Victoria, guess today's sales?"

Her stomach dropped. "Single digits now?"

"No! Over ten thousand!" Simon's voice cracked with excitement. "And climbing!"

A renowned critic had featured Seven-Day Tales in their column.

"True suspense doesn't rely on gimmicks or tired tropes—just raw storytelling power."

The review went viral.

Readers began recommending it organically.

"Mom, you did it!" Evelyn tackled her in a hug.

William discreetly wiped his eyes.

As sales figures refreshed endlessly on her phone screen, Victoria finally smiled—a real one, for the first time in weeks.
###Chapter 461

"Sixty thousand!" Simon Croix's voice exploded through the phone.

Victoria Langley tightened her grip on her cell. "Sixty thousand what?"

"Single-day sales! Seven-Day Tales sold sixty thousand copies yesterday!" Simon's voice trembled. "It broke The Weapon's fifteen-year record!"

Victoria's breath caught.

"Victoria," Simon inhaled sharply, "your new book—it's a phenomenon!"

Not just successful. Explosively so.

A month ago, the situation had been completely different.

Simon had stared at the dismal first-week sales report, sweat beading on his forehead. The mocking words of a rival editor still rang in his ears: "This is what you paid a million for?"

He'd flipped through the advance copy of Victoria's novel again.

The prose was masterful, the plot intricately woven, every twist perfectly timed. Such work shouldn't go unnoticed.

Where had they gone wrong?

He pulled up the reader demographics—67% male, aged 30-50. Yet the marketing team had poured all resources into platforms dominated by young women.

"Change course immediately!" Simon slammed his desk and stood. "Book forums, literary blogs, newspaper review sections—full coverage!"

Three days later, the sales curve began climbing.

The real turning point came with a video from "Old Thompson Reads."

In the clip, the self-proclaimed "thirty-year fiction abstainer" Old Thompson sat engrossed in Seven-Day Tales, oblivious to his wife calling him for dinner.

The comments section erupted:
"Old Thompson actually reading fiction?"
"How good must this book be?"
"Just ordered—gotta see what could make Thompson put down his whiskey"

Soon, organic recommendations flooded social media:
"Finished at 3 AM and turned on every light in my house"
"Do NOT read before bed (trust me)"
"I'll never walk alone at night again after this"

The top comment went viral:
"After reading this, my local diner's tofu pudding sales dropped by half"

When asked why, the commenter simply replied:
"Read it"
###Chapter 462

Two days later, the "Chubby Bookworm" account posted an update.

This time, there was no appearance from the father—just a cover photo of Seven-Day Tales.

The caption read: Who knew our grandparents' lives were this fascinating?

Riding this wave of interest, Seven-Day Tales quickly gained popularity among younger readers.

They were utterly captivated.

Within ten short days, discussions about the book flooded major social media platforms.

Longtime fans sighed in relief—The hidden gem has finally been discovered!

Then, readers realized something peculiar: Where is the author?

The book was a sensation, yet the author remained silent.

Normally, writers would engage with fans after trending online.

But despite Seven-Day Tales hitting the top searches three times, the author was nowhere to be found.

Victoria Langley truly had no idea.

She had long disconnected from the online world, not even using a smartphone.

Not because she couldn’t, but because she deliberately chose this way of living.

She preferred a slower pace, focusing solely on writing.

Outside opinions—praise or criticism—meant nothing to her.

......

Evelyn Langley immediately pulled out her phone and searched.

Information about Seven-Day Tales instantly filled the screen.

There were reader recommendations, literary critics’ endorsements, and, of course, skeptical voices.

But one thing was undeniable—

The book was a phenomenon.

"Mom, you’re amazing!" Evelyn exclaimed excitedly.

William Langley snatched the phone and scrolled. "Everyone’s praising you!"

"Does that mean I’ll get famous too, as the writer’s husband?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Dad..."

"You are famous."

"It’s just... a unique kind of fame."

William: "??"

The book’s final villain was a physics teacher—based directly on him.

"!"

......

As the book’s popularity soared, readers grew increasingly curious about the author.

Simon Croix made a decisive move: a book signing in Kyoto.

The moment the announcement went live, registrations surpassed ten thousand.

The entire marketing team was stunned.

Simon remained calm. "Great work speaks for itself."

The signing was scheduled for three days later.

Perfect timing—William and Victoria could travel with Evelyn.

The next morning, a light drizzle fell.

A taxi carried the family of three toward the bullet train station.

While waiting, Evelyn pulled out a chestnut cake she’d prepared.

It was specially made for Victoria, who disliked sweets.
###Chapter 463

William Langley had cooked himself a bowl of plain noodles before leaving home. The steaming hot meal left a comforting warmth in his stomach. He pulled out a copy of The Ming Dynasty Stories from his briefcase and became engrossed in reading.

Twenty minutes later, the boarding announcement echoed through the station.

Victoria Langley and Evelyn Langley carried only small handbags, breezing through the ticket gates with ease. They stood in the waiting area, scanning the bustling platform.

William dragged his suitcase behind him, Victoria's tote bag slung over his shoulder. Just as he reached for his ID, his expression darkened.

He remembered the man in a baseball cap who had shoved him hard in the back while he was in line.

"Dad, hurry up!" Evelyn called from inside the gate.

Beads of sweat formed on William's forehead. "My wallet's gone. My ID was inside."

"Use your digital ID," Evelyn said, pulling out her phone.

William gave a strained smile. "My phone... was in the wallet too."

Then he spotted the familiar baseball cap weaving through the crowd.

"Stop!" William abandoned his luggage and gave chase.

Evelyn and Victoria tried to turn back but were blocked by a station attendant. "Ma'am, regulations prohibit re-entering through the gates."

"My husband is chasing a thief!" Victoria stamped her foot in frustration.

The attendant shook his head. "You'll need to exit and re-enter through the proper channels."

Evelyn had an idea. "Can you call the police?"

"Officers have already been notified."

......

At the far end of the platform, William leaned forward, hands on his knees, panting. "Thank you so much, young man."

"Just doing what anyone would." The young man handed back the wallet.

"May I have your name?"

"Ethan Winston."

......

"Dad!" Evelyn jogged over, strands of hair clinging to her damp cheeks.

William waved the retrieved wallet triumphantly. "All thanks to Mr. Winston here!"

Victoria inspected her husband anxiously. "Are you hurt?"

"Just winded from running." William rubbed his side.

After sorting out their rebooked tickets, the three returned to the waiting area.

"Ethan!" William suddenly called out, waving toward the distance.

Ethan was reviewing a financial report and only looked up at the third call.

His gaze slid past William, locking onto the slender figure beside him.

"You know each other?" Evelyn blinked in surprise as the man approached.

A glimmer of amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes. He'd come to Linshi for a merger negotiation—this unexpected encounter was an unforeseen delight.
###Chapter 464

The storm forced flight cancellations, and Ethan Winston had to switch to a high-speed train.

Who would have thought...

This misfortune would bring unexpected joy!

William Langley patted Ethan's shoulder. "This young man helped me retrieve my wallet—what impressive reflexes!"

Evelyn Langley froze. "Mr. Winston?"

"Just a small favor." Ethan's gaze softened. "Anyone would've done the same."

Victoria Langley looked surprised. "You two know each other?"

They answered in unison, "Yes."

As for how they'd met...

Now wasn't the time for details.

Victoria tactfully didn't press further.

William asked warmly, "Where are you headed, Ethan?"

"Capital City."

"What a coincidence! So are we. Which train are you taking?"

Ethan countered, "And you?"

Upon hearing their train number, his lips curved slightly. "How serendipitous—we're on the same one."

"Perfect! We can travel together."

"The honor is mine."

During the conversation, Ethan swiftly completed his ticket change on his phone.

If coincidence didn't exist, he'd create it.

......

The train police arrived to take statements, requiring William's signature.

Victoria accompanied him.

Only two remained in their seats.

Ethan lowered his voice. "You called me 'Mr. Winston' earlier?"

Evelyn blinked. "What else should I call you?"

"Too formal." He feigned hurt. "'Ethan' would be nicer."

"I don't casually call anyone 'brother,'" she teased. "Unless you actually are my brother."

Ethan immediately backtracked. "'Mr. Winston' is fine."

Being her brother? Absolutely not.

He pulled out a book with a gilded cover from his bag.

"So you have it!" Evelyn gasped.

It was that out-of-print foreign academic text she'd been searching for.

"The bookstore owner gave it to me." Ethan smiled. "I heard you were looking for this?"

Her eyes sparkled. "The owner said it was out of print..."

"Now it's yours."

"I can't possibly..."

"It was meant for you all along." He pressed it into her hands. "Keeping it with me would be a waste."

A gilded bookmark nestled between the pages.

Sunlight streamed through the window, scattering flecks of gold across their overlapping shadows.
###Chapter 465

The present was too extravagant. After much hesitation, she still couldn't bring herself to refuse.

"Thank you."

"Call me Ethan."

"......"

They arrived in the capital at two in the afternoon.

The Langleys and Ethan weren’t in the same train carriage.

As they exited the station, Evelyn was about to hail a cab when she spotted Ethan standing nearby. His tall frame made him stand out in the crowd.

He walked over to William with a smile. "Uncle, my car is right outside. Let me drive you home?"

William waved his hands. "No need, we don’t want to trouble you."

"It’s on my way." Without waiting for a response, Ethan took the suitcase.

"Well, thank you, Ethan."

"My pleasure."

Evelyn quietly closed the ride-hailing app.

Inside the car—

Ethan handled the steering wheel with ease. Evelyn sat in the passenger seat while her parents occupied the back.

"Uncle, that copy of The Comprehensive Mirror you’re holding—is it the 2003 reprint?" Ethan glanced through the rearview mirror.

William’s eyes lit up. "You know about this?"

"My grandfather enjoys studying history. I picked up a bit from him. If I recall correctly, two chapters were cut from the edition published a decade later?"

William grew animated. "More than that! This book underwent three rounds of revisions!"

"The most recent was in 2010, before that in 2004, and the earliest is hard to pin down. Mine is from before the second revision."

"1996," Ethan said suddenly.

William was stunned. "How did you know?"

"My great-uncle oversaw the editorial work for the 2004 revision. The original was from 1996."

William gasped. "Your great-uncle is...?"

"Edward Winston."

"Professor Winston is your great-uncle?!" William’s voice rose in excitement.

Ethan chuckled. "You know him?"

"Of course! Everyone in academia knows Professor Winston!"

Ethan turned the steering wheel. "Pre-1996 editions are practically extinct now, but my great-uncle left me his entire collection before he moved abroad."

"I’ll look for it when I get home."

William was both shocked and delighted. "That’s... too much trouble, isn’t it?"

Ethan glanced at Evelyn. "Books only hold meaning when they’re appreciated by those who understand them."

"Well... I won’t refuse, then!"

After all, we’ll be family sooner or later.

Victoria smoothly interjected, "Ethan, your family has quite the scholarly background. What kind of books do you usually enjoy?"

"Our home library leans toward essays and fiction. Personally, I prefer mystery and suspense. I just finished Seven-Day Tales a few days ago, Auntie. The ending was brilliant."

Victoria was surprised. "You’ve read my book?"

Ethan’s gaze flicked to Evelyn. "Yes. I knew you wrote it."

As for how he knew...

The two shared an unspoken understanding.

Only Evelyn sat stiffly, pinned under their meaningful looks.

"So, was the killer really the physics teacher?"

Victoria raised an eyebrow. "Why do you ask?"
###Chapter 466

The final chapter unfolded, peeling back layers of mystery.

The physics teacher emerged from the shadows of truth.

He had designed a flawless murder using precise physics knowledge.

The evidence seemed irrefutable, the killer all but confirmed.

Yet Ethan Winston suddenly spoke, "Is he really the culprit?"

Victoria Langley's gaze deepened.

"There are several intriguing details in the book..." Ethan's slender fingers tapped the pages.

First, the angle of the shadow in the stairwell was off.

Second, the murder weapon vanished and reappeared without explanation.

Third, the lone girl kept men's slippers at home—highly unusual.

"These details suggest the real killer is someone else." Ethan closed the book. "Though it's just my theory."

Victoria's lips curved. "Noticing these means you already have the answer, don't you?"

"So," amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes, "there'll be a sequel?"

Victoria smiled without answering.

Her silence said everything.

The car stopped at the alley entrance.

Evelyn Langley thanked him and stepped out with her parents.

"Thank you so much, Ethan," William Langley said warmly.

"Don't mention it, sir."

As they climbed the stairs, William suddenly paused.

"Wait... I never told you our address."

Evelyn's heart skipped.

Victoria rolled her eyes. "Took you long enough."

"This question," she said meaningfully, "is for Evelyn."

William finally understood. "Evelyn, you and Ethan—"

"Just friends!" Evelyn hurried to explain. "He's helped me a few times, that's all."

"You're not close, yet he helps so often?"

"He's... just kind! Didn't he catch that thief for you today?"

William nodded. "True."

Victoria: "..."

"Dad, let's go. The bags are heavy."

"Give them to me..."

On the drive back, Ethan was in high spirits.

He dialed a number. "Dylan, get Julian. Tea time."

"...Tea?" Dylan Lowell thought he misheard.

"Yes, tea."

Dylan: "..."

Tea in broad daylight?

He couldn't comprehend.

At the serene teahouse.

Julian Roscente entered, skeptical. "What's this new whim?"

Ethan poured tea. "Try it. Freshly brewed."

Julian glanced. "Tasteless. Pass."

Dylan, already two cups in, nodded vigorously.

Then Nathan Evans walked in.

Julian and Dylan froze.

They exchanged stunned looks.

Dylan mouthed: Your idea?

Julian shook his head: As if I'd dare.
###Chapter 467

"Nathan Evans, what's your game?" Ethan Winston strode into the tearoom, his leather shoes tapping an urgent rhythm against the hardwood floor.

"Care to elaborate?" Ethan didn't look up, continuing to arrange the tea set with deliberate precision.

"Why was the East Suburb development project suddenly halted?"

Ethan lifted his teacup for a measured sip. "Terminated due to lack of mutual interest. Problem?"

"Do you have any idea how much we lose per day in stalled operations?"

"Roughly."

"And you still pulled the plug?!"

The kettle hissed steam between them as Ethan began a second infusion with infuriating calm.

Nathan slammed his palm over the lid. "Three days dodging my calls, now the silent treatment?"

Ethan finally met his gaze. "Who said I was avoiding you?"

"Your secretary claimed you were traveling. Convenient timing."

A humorless chuckle. "Prearranged site inspection in Linshi. Scheduled two weeks ago. Hardly an evasion tactic."

"Linshi?" Nathan's eyes sharpened like honed steel.

The corner of Ethan's mouth twitched upward.

Dylan Lowell chose that moment to interject. "You went to Linshi, Ethan? Their street food's killer... Wait, isn't that Evelyn's hometown—Ow!"

Julian Roscente's dress shoe came down hard on his instep.

Dylan's mouth snapped shut.

Nathan's stare could have frozen magma. "You went to see her."

"Business trip," Ethan corrected smoothly. "Though I did encounter Evelyn."

"What did you just call her?"

"Evelyn."

Nathan's fist cratered the tea table. "Say it again. I dare you."

"Evelyn~ Evelyn~" Ethan drawled with mocking singsong cadence.

Nathan seized his collar. "Forgotten my last warning already?"

Ethan swatted his hand away, straightening his lapel. "Warning? By what authority? Her ex? Don't flatter yourself."

A controlled inhale. "You'd sabotage our partnership over this? I thought you at least understood professional boundaries."

"Evelyn despises men who blur personal and professional lines. Does she know how petty you're being?"

The teacup met wood with a thunderous crack.

"Save the theatrics. Reverse psychology won't work here." Ethan's voice turned arctic. "State your purpose—here to discuss Evelyn, or the project?"

"Let me be clear. This is merely the first termination. All joint ventures will be systematically dissolved. Consider our professional ties severed."

Nathan's pupils contracted to pinpoints. "You've lost your goddamn mind."

"Is it truly incomprehensible?"

"Because Evelyn and I have history? Ethan, are you clinically insane? Throwing away millions to nurse a bruised ego?"

Their twenty-plus collaborations spanned multiple industries. Dissolution meant incinerating years of capital and labor.

"Worth destroying everything?" Nathan's laugh held razor blades. "Chase Evelyn all you want! I'm not initiating the split—you are!"

"Don't tell me you actually believe cutting ties with me will make her choose you?"

"Pathetic." Nathan hurled his cup against the wall.

Porcelain shrapnel rained down.

"Never pegged you for a love-struck fool, Ethan Winston."
###Chapter 468

The sharp sound of shattering porcelain echoed through the office.

Dylan Lowell and Julian Roscente quickly stepped back as glass shards scattered at their feet.

They exchanged stunned glances.

The bombshell Nathan Evans just dropped was unbelievable.

Ethan Winston would actually sever profitable business ties just to cut Nathan off completely?

Everyone knew they'd had a falling out, but their commercial collaborations never stopped.

Investments continued. Profits flowed.

Business was business. What did personal grudges matter?

If it were them, they'd never jeopardize deals even to pursue a woman.

Especially not a shrewd businessman like Ethan Winston.

This time...

No wonder Nathan called him love-struck. Even Dylan and Julian found it incomprehensible.

Ethan gazed at the shattered remains. "What a waste. You still haven't broken that habit of smashing things. Did you do this to Evelyn Langley too?"

Nathan's temple throbbed. "What are you implying?"

Ethan smirked. "I'm petty. I'm childish. I want a clean break. No grand reasons needed. Just because I feel like it. Got a problem with that?"

"You—"

Nathan's jaw clenched, chest heaving with barely contained fury.

Ethan arched a brow. "What? Can't bear to lose those projects? That money?"

Nathan scoffed. "Spare me the act. Since when does Ethan Winston turn down profits?"

"Of course I love money." Ethan shrugged. "But Evelyn matters more."

Dylan and Julian discreetly rubbed their arms.

That was nauseatingly sweet.

Ethan continued, "Even if I cut you off completely, she might still reject me. So what?"

"My choices are mine. Her decisions are hers. Ideally both work out. But if not, should I just do nothing?"

"That's the difference between us, Nathan. You won't gamble on uncertain outcomes. I'll stake everything."

Nathan narrowed his eyes. "Even knowing you'll lose?"

Ethan smiled. "There are no sure losses. Only cowards who won't try."

"You're insane!"

"Maybe." Ethan chuckled. "But I like it this way."

Nathan ground his teeth. "Pursuing Evelyn doesn't conflict with our partnership."

"It does for me."

Nathan's gaze turned icy. "Don't drag me down with your madness."

"Hence this heads-up. Prepare accordingly."

Nathan laughed bitterly. "You're literally burning money for fun now."

Ethan shrugged. "The sound's nice."

Nathan: "......"

Psycho!

He turned to leave.

Ethan suddenly said, "I visited Evelyn's parents in Linshi recently."

Nathan froze mid-step.

###Chapter 469

Ethan Winston lifted his teacup and took a deliberate sip, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"She grew up surrounded by love. Do you understand what that means?"

Nathan Evans' back stiffened.

"It means she loves fiercely and hates without hesitation." Each of Ethan's words drove in like a nail. "When she stood against the world for you, it wasn't impulsiveness—it was courage."

Nathan clenched his fists.

"Too bad you weren't worthy of that courage." Ethan's lips curled into a cold smile. "To people like you, she's just 'love-struck.' But I know the truth—she only wanted a love that lasted."

Nathan whirled around, eyes bloodshot. "Are you gloating?"

"Yes." Ethan didn't deny it.

The air turned to ice.

"A girl raised in that kind of family deserves pure love." Ethan lowered his gaze. "Not some calculated choice after weighing pros and cons."

A self-deprecating laugh escaped him.

Hadn't he once been just as calculating? But now, he'd give up every advantage for Evelyn Langley.

The door slammed shut with a violent crash.

Dylan Lowell and Julian Roscente pressed themselves against the wall, not daring to breathe.

"Is Nathan gonna murder someone?" Dylan gulped.

"Remove the 'maybe.'" Julian shuddered.

Ethan leisurely brewed his third pot of tea.

"Try it. This blend needs three infusions to reveal its depth."

Julian forced himself to take a sip, tasting nothing.

Dylan rubbed his round stomach. "Ethan, I seriously can't drink another drop..."

"No appreciation for the finer things." Ethan shook his head.

Dylan's eyes gleamed with mischief. "So, Ethan... you really met her parents?"

Julian perked up.

"Yeah." A faint smile touched Ethan's lips. "Just getting a head start on making a good impression."

"And?"

"It went fine." Ethan traced the rim of his cup.

Julian smacked the table. "Damn it! You called us here just to flaunt your relationship?"

Ethan hid his smirk behind another sip of tea.

Meanwhile, Nathan stormed into his office.

"List every project we have with Ethan Winston!" His voice was raw.

His trembling assistant handed over the files.

"Terminate them all." Nathan signed the documents with red-rimmed eyes.
###Chapter 470

"Excuse me?" The manager thought he must have misheard.

These were all the company's key ongoing projects. Several had already shown promising results. Now they were being abruptly terminated?

Nathan Evans lifted his gaze. "Do I need to repeat myself?"

"N-no, sir..."

"Any questions?"

"...None."

"Then why are you still standing here?"

Beads of sweat formed on the manager's forehead. "Mr. Evans, I just don't understand—"

"Follow orders. Understanding is optional."

......

Over twenty major projects required evaluation before termination. Minimizing losses posed complex challenges.

By the time Nathan finished reviewing the last document, night had fallen.

He stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the city lights below.

She chose you without hesitation, even willing to stand against the whole world...

Too bad you betrayed that devotion...

Ethan Winston's words echoed relentlessly in his mind.

Nathan's lips twisted in self-mockery. Regret had tiers—the most agonizing was when everyone reminded you of the priceless girl you'd lost.

Yet no one had warned him back then.

Only when it was too late did they speak up.

Returning to the empty mansion, waves of helplessness engulfed him.

What more could he do?

Ethan mentioned already meeting her parents...

Golden dawn light spilled across the windowsill.

Evelyn Langley prepared breakfast quietly without disturbing her parents. After eating alone, she left for her morning jog.

With no morning classes, she stopped by the farmers market after her run.

When William and Victoria Langley woke, steaming breakfast awaited them, and the fridge brimmed with fresh ingredients.

"Evelyn, when did you get up?"

"Around six."

"So early?"

"Force of habit."

William noticed the groceries. "You went to the market?"

"Mm. The ribs looked good today. Braised for lunch?"

"I'll cook. You rest."

Suddenly, knocking interrupted them.

Victoria set down her chopsticks. "Who could that be this early?"

Opening the door, she first saw an armload of exquisitely wrapped gift boxes.

Looking up, she met a vaguely familiar face.

Victoria frowned. "You are...?"

Nathan's smile froze. "Good morning, Mrs. Langley. I'm Nathan Evans."

Victoria's expression darkened instantly, her eyes turning glacial.

"What do you want?"

"I heard you and Mr. Langley were visiting the city. I came to pay my respects. These are just small tokens—"

Victoria didn't accept the gifts, merely studying him with icy detachment.

Nathan flushed with discomfort.

During their six-year relationship, he'd only met Evelyn's parents once.

That time, he'd rushed through dinner before making excuses to leave.

In his memory, they'd been utterly ordinary middle-class folks.
###Chapter 471

"We can't accept these." Victoria Langley's voice was soft but firm.

"First, we don't take gifts without reason. Second, you and Evelyn are no longer connected."

She would always remember the first time she met Nathan Evans.

That day, she and her husband had waited nearly forty minutes at the restaurant before Nathan arrived late.

No explanation. No apology.

Just a cold "Uncle, Aunt" before he started eating without another word.

The entire meal passed in near silence.

Victoria understood then what "ill-matched" truly meant.

Yet her daughter remained stubbornly devoted, making excuses for Nathan even after he left abruptly.

As a mother, it broke her heart into unspeakable pieces.

How could a man who couldn't offer basic respect ever truly cherish her daughter?

But she didn't force them apart.

Victoria knew Evelyn too well—unless her daughter hit that wall herself, she'd always wonder.

She just never imagined the cost would be this devastating.

"Evelyn is doing well now. If you still feel any remorse, please don't disturb her life again."

Nathan's face drained of color. "Aunt Victoria—"

William Langley emerged at the sound, his expression darkening instantly at the sight of Nathan. "What are you doing here?"

"Uncle William—"

"Leave." William cut him off sharply. "Since it's over, let it stay over."

Nathan lowered his lashes, his throat working. "...My apologies."

He turned to leave, only to collide with Adrian Klein returning home at the stairwell landing.

As they passed each other, Nathan heard William's suddenly warm voice behind him:

"Adrian! I haven't finished that paper you sent—thank you for going through the trouble."

"No trouble at all." Adrian's tone was gentle. "I remembered you prefer hard copies."

"Exactly! Such a thick stack—what a waste otherwise."

"We made ribs tonight. Join us?"

"Gladly."

"None of that formality! Come in for tea! Evelyn, get Adrian a cup!"

"Okay."

Evelyn's bright response stabbed through Nathan like a blade.

The door clicked shut behind him.

Standing in the empty stairwell, the gifts in his hands suddenly weighed like stones.

Each step downward felt like walking on knives.

Back in his hollow mansion, Nathan stared at the carefully selected presents and laughed bitterly.

Some mistakes, it seemed, could never be undone.
###Chapter 472

Mrs. Watson finished cleaning and left.

The empty villa returned to its desolate state, just as it had been when Evelyn Langley departed.

Nathan Evans walked slowly upstairs and pushed open the master bedroom door.

A thin layer of dust covered the vanity. The bottles and jars remained exactly where their owner had left them.

Like abandoned dolls.

He pulled open the bottom drawer.

Three items lay inside: a check, a deed, and a diamond bracelet.

The diamonds were arranged in the pattern of the Sagittarius constellation.

It was a custom gift he'd commissioned from John Smith for Evelyn's 22nd birthday.

"The eternal star of my life"—that was how the designer had relayed Nathan's original words.

To create the perfect surprise, he'd deliberately given her the cold shoulder for an entire week.

On the morning of her birthday, he'd appeared outside Harvard's gates at dawn.

Evelyn had rushed into his arms with red-rimmed eyes.

Yet she rarely wore the bracelet afterward.

Every time she did, they would inevitably end up fighting.

"Nathan, I'm afraid of arguments..." she once told him. "Every fight chips away at what we have."

That night he'd been drunk.

He couldn't remember a single word she'd said.

When he woke the next morning, all he saw were her bloodshot eyes.

......

The Langley family living room was filled with the aroma of home-cooked food.

"Try these braised pork ribs," William Langley said enthusiastically, serving Adrian Klein.

"Thank you, Mr. Langley."

"How do they taste?"

"Delicious."

William's eyes crinkled with pleasure. "Then have some more!"

"Alright."

"How about a game of chess after dinner?"

Adrian paused mid-bite.

Chess was fine.

But the form of address...

After the meal, William eagerly set up the board.

Adrian rolled up his sleeves instead. "Let me help clean the kitchen first."

"No need," William waved him off. "Evelyn can handle it."

The kitchen was already nearly spotless.

"I ate too much. Need to move around," Adrian insisted.

"Well, don't overdo it."

Adrian carried dishes into the kitchen.

Evelyn was tying an apron, her hands behind her back, struggling slightly with the strings.

"Need help?"

She turned. "My hands are oily. Didn't want to stain the apron..."

Adrian took the strings.

His slender fingers deftly tied a bow.

As the apron cinched, it accentuated her slender waist.

His breath caught.

That waist looked so fragile it might snap with one wrong move.
###Chapter 473

"Professor, are you done?"

Evelyn Langley's voice snapped Adrian Klein back to reality.

He realized his fingers were still resting on the fabric at her waist.

"...Done."

"Thank you."

Adrian's gaze lingered on her slender waistline.

Not out of inappropriate thoughts.

But—

She was too thin!

He could practically picture her skipping meals every day.

......

Nathan Evans sat at his dresser all night.

From sunset to sunrise.

Closing his eyes only made the memories clearer.

Sweet recollections like sugar, bitter past like medicine.

The mixture left him sleepless.

Dawn light filtered through the curtains before he emerged from reminiscence.

8:00 sharp.

He changed into a fresh suit and drove to the most famous patisserie on Fifth Avenue.

A normally thirty-minute trip took twice as long today.

"One mango mille crepe, please."

The clerk looked up in surprise. "Whole cake or slices?"

"Whole."

"You're in luck. First batch just came out. Two minutes later and we'd have started slicing."

Nathan gave a slight nod.

The clerk expertly packaged it. "Buying cake this early for a girlfriend's birthday?"

"Ex-girlfriend's favorite."

Those five simple words made the clerk's expression turn knowing.

Nathan offered no explanation, taking the box and leaving.

Through the glass door, the clerk watched the understated black sports car pull away.

"Tsk..."

More dramatic than a soap opera.

......

The school bell rang.

Hannah Flores stretched. "I'm parched!"

Liam Kalmien silently packed his bag.

Used to his quietness, she chattered on. "Let's get bubble tea by the gate! My treat!"

Liam: "..."

Here we go again.

Always monologuing like this.

"Not thirsty."

"Ugh! You're no fun!"

"I'll walk with you."

"No! You have to pick a flavor!"

"I'm training..."

Hannah rolled her eyes. "Right, right, no sugar. Get sugar-free then!"

Liam frowned. "Still has calories."

"You—" She stamped her foot. "Think you're special for being skinny?"

"If you care about weight, why not diet?"

"Dieting means no treats. No treats means unhappy. Unhappy means depressed. Depression kills! So dieting equals suicide!"

Liam: "..."

He couldn't counter that logic.

"Are you coming or not? Say no and I'll never ask again!"

Liam sighed. "...Let's go."

"Really?" Hannah's eyes lit up. "You'll drink some?"

"..."

"Say it! Are you drinking?"

Liam relented. "Fine. I'll drink."
###Chapter 474

Hannah's eyes curved into crescents, her dimples playing peek-a-boo on plump cheeks.

Though full-figured, her delicate features resembled a porcelain doll.

"That's more like it. Why didn't you say so earlier..."

She yanked Liam's arm, dragging him toward the campus gates.

Liam stiffened, attempting to withdraw.

Hannah clung tighter. "Don't be shy! We're besties!"

She bounced ahead like an overenthusiastic puppy.

Liam: "..." Since when did this girl bench-press trucks?

Just outside, Nathan emerged from a flashy red sports car, cake box in hand.

Hannah tilted her head. "Why does he always park right at the entrance? Doesn't he know it causes traffic?"

Liam pondered. "...Probably thinks it's cool."

"Cool? Because stepping out of a Porsche to gawking crowds impresses people?"

"...Something like that."

Hannah gasped. "You actually think that's attractive?"

Liam shook his head. "My grandfather says only a Lincoln screams 'class.'"

Hannah: "My dad and uncles swear by Toyotas for practicality."

So—

"Why insist on a Porsche?"

They exchanged baffled glances.

But...

Hannah eyed the cake box, swallowing hard. "That looks delicious."

Liam facepalmed at her starry-eyed expression.

Having stalked the campus entrance repeatedly, Nathan noticed Evelyn always accompanied these two.

He blocked their path. "Where's Evelyn?"

Hannah shrugged. "She's absent today."

"Where is she?"

"Personal leave."

"Why?"

"No idea."

As Nathan pressed further, Hannah tugged Liam away. "We're late—bye!"

Left standing in his tailored suit clutching a cartoon-printed cake box, Nathan became sidewalk entertainment.

This had to be Evelyn's revenge.

With a冷笑, he turned toward the trash bin.

"Hey—"

Nathan glanced back.

Sophia beamed at him. "Tossing things again?"

"None of your business."

"Flowers last time, cake today—what's next?"

He frowned. "We're strangers."

Sophia blinked. "I took those flowers, arranged them in vases, even shared with dorm neighbors. Earned me free bubble tea."

Nathan's brow arched. "You actually kept them?"

"Obviously. Not charging me now, are you? You discarded them."

Nathan: "..."

"Speaking of... mind handing over that cake?"

He scoffed. "To redistribute again?"

"Yep. Waste not—might score more free drinks."

"Can't afford bubble tea?"

Sophia grinned. "Free tastes sweeter."

"Because it's gratis?"

"Mmhmm." She nodded vigorously.

Nathan suddenly smirked, extending the box.

Sophia's eyes sparkled.

"Changed your mind?"

"Gimme!" She seized it, grinning ear-to-ear.
###Chapter 475

Sophia Frackett watched the man's retreating figure.

Sunlight glinted off the Porsche's polished surface, casting blinding reflections. Only then did she notice the icy gleam of his Patek Philippe watch under the sunlight, the bespoke Armani suit tailored perfectly to his frame.

She looked down at the cake box in her hands, fingers tightening unconsciously.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Langley was accompanying Victoria Langley through the mall. She'd skipped her specialized course—today was just group presentations anyway, with Hannah Flores and Liam Kalmien handling it.

Tomorrow was the book signing. Victoria had rummaged through her closet but couldn't find a single suitable outfit.

"You look beautiful in anything, sweetheart," William Langley said sincerely.

For once, Victoria didn't laugh.

"Mom, let's go shopping!" Evelyn immediately understood. "With so many malls in the city, we'll find something you love."

Victoria's eyes lit up. "Yes, let's!"

William scratched his head, bewildered.

......

SKP Mall.

The glass elevator ascended slowly, luxury shops on the first floor shrinking below them. Victoria gasped. "This place is enormous!"

They'd meant to go to the clothing sections on the second and third floors but missed their stop, ending up on the fourth.

"Is that...?" Victoria was drawn to a poster outside the bookstore, so the family stepped out.

Beneath the "SKP RENDEZ-VOUS" sign, the air blended coffee aromas with the scent of books. The entrance held a café, followed by a dining area, with bookshelves and文创 displays in between.

Most striking was the promotional wall—the cover of Seven-Day Tales dominated the prime spot, flanked by bold labels like "Bestseller" and "Hot Release."

Inside the reading area, Seven-Day Tales commanded the central shelf. Nearly every customer held a copy.

Victoria blinked, dazed. "Is this really my book?"

"Of course!" Evelyn bought a copy and handed it to her. "See for yourself."

Victoria opened to the title page. Seeing her pen name, she finally smiled. "It really is mine."

"Dad, you need new clothes too," Evelyn suddenly turned to William.

"Me?" William waved his hands. "I have plenty. You two go ahead."

"At tomorrow's signing, if readers ask who you are—the man behind the queen of suspense—you can't embarrass Mom."

William paused. "Good point."

He couldn't let his wife down.

They took the elevator down to the men's section. William had kept his figure well—several suits fit him perfectly.

"Sweetheart, which one looks best?" William asked Victoria.

Evelyn also looked expectantly at her mother.
###Chapter 476

Victoria's fingertips lightly traced the dresses on the clothing rack.

"Which one looks better?" William stood behind her holding two suits.

Her gaze wandered between the racks. "They're both nice."

"Then what should I do?" He frowned at the clothes in his hands.

A small smile curved her lips. "Buy them all."

"No!" William shook his head quickly. "That's too extravagant. One is enough."

Victoria already handed her credit card to the sales associate. "Please wrap all three."

The sales associate beamed. "Right away!"

William tugged her sleeve. "Honey, this is too expensive..."

"It's fine." She leaned closer, whispering in his ear. "I just got a royalty check. Over a hundred thousand."

His eyes widened. "That much?"

"Mhm~" She winked playfully.

"My wife is amazing!" William couldn't resist hugging her.

Evelyn cleared her throat loudly. "Get a room!"

The men's section was quickly settled, but Victoria lingered indecisively in women's wear. She critically browsed store after store without even wanting to try anything on.

"I remember a French brand..." Evelyn suddenly recalled something, leading them to a secluded corner of the mall.

Tucked away in an obscure location, the boutique still made Victoria's eyes light up upon entering. She went straight to the display area and selected two dresses to try.

The orange one was vibrant, the blue one elegant—both complemented her porcelain skin perfectly. Delicate lace embroidery blossomed along the hems, while the chest fringe swayed gently with each step.

Yet something still felt missing.

Her gaze suddenly caught on the window display. A seemingly plain black dress hung quietly, its only accent being the white tulle wrapped around the waist.

Simple yet romantic—the epitome of French style she adored.

......

Beatrice wandered aimlessly through the mall.

An inconspicuous little shop at the corner caught her eye. The black dress in the window made her pause.

After entering, she tried several dresses but ultimately preferred the original black one.

"Wrap this for me." As she went to check out, she suddenly saw another woman wearing the same dress she'd just tried on.

The sales associate held her breath nervously.

Beatrice narrowed her eyes and strode toward Victoria. The associate mentally rehearsed countless mediation lines.

Two elegant women wearing identical dresses—this confrontation wouldn't end peacefully.
###Chapter 477

The salesgirl braced herself for a catfight between two women.

But Beatrice Merouin walked straight toward Victoria Langley.

"That dress suits you perfectly," she remarked after careful appraisal.

Beatrice had tried the same style before, but it paled in comparison to how it looked on Victoria.

It wasn't just about sizing—their auras differed completely.

Beatrice naturally exuded sharp intensity, lacking any softness.

Victoria was the opposite.

Her gentle features, serene smile, even the warmth in her eyes—all radiated approachability.

Such a face made hostility difficult to muster.

Strangely, Beatrice usually disliked tender, feminine types.

Whether it was her sister-in-law Eleanor Roland or the tea ceremony instructor.

Yet this girl inexplicably drew her in.

Victoria noticed the salesgirl's hesitant expression.

She smiled graciously. "Thank you." Gesturing to another dress nearby, she added, "With your hourglass figure, this cut would highlight your waist better..."

Beatrice had classic curves—a slender waist paired with ample bust.

She needed designs that accentuated her midsection.

The current dress, though luxurious in fabric, obscured her silhouette.

Victoria's suggestion featured a high-waisted mermaid cut.

Black for slimming effect, with a flowing hem to soften the formality.

Beatrice tried it on skeptically.

The mirror reflection stunned her.

"Do you study fashion design?"

"Just an avid fashion magazine reader." Victoria shook her head shyly.

"You got this precise from magazines alone?"

"Hands-on experience helps too..."

Their conversation flowed effortlessly.

At checkout, Beatrice spotted a book in Victoria's bag.

The cover of Seven-Day Tales stood out prominently.

"You read this?"

"You're a fan too?" Victoria's eyes widened in surprise.

"My son recently obsessed over this author's thrillers." Beatrice chuckled. "Bought stacks—The Weapon, The Deserted School."

"Last week when I delivered his lunch, he was reading some campus romance." She wrinkled her nose. "That writing style—so saccharine it gave me goosebumps."

Victoria froze.

The mortification of having her cringeworthy past works exposed hit like a tidal wave.

She wished the ground would swallow her whole.

"But the mysteries are genuinely well-crafted." Beatrice offered a fair assessment. "Popularity doesn't come without reason."

Victoria could only manage a strained smile.

The salesgirl handed over their purchases eagerly.

As Beatrice departed, she passed Evelyn Langley at the entrance.

Their eyes met—both choosing silent acknowledgment.

Evelyn recognized the wealthy socialite.

But she couldn't be certain the recognition was mutual.

To initiate conversation might seem calculated.
###Chapter 478

Beatrice Merouin's gaze lingered on Evelyn Langley for a fleeting moment.

She remembered this girl. Their previous chance encounters had inexplicably unsettled her. That flawlessly beautiful face always dredged up unpleasant memories.

Evelyn walked past without sparing her a glance.

As they brushed shoulders, Beatrice caught a faint whiff of jasmine. She instinctively frowned and quickened her pace.

"Evelyn, come see the dress I picked!" Victoria Langley's voice carried from nearby.

Evelyn hurried over. "You've already decided? I didn't even see you try it on."

Victoria winked mysteriously. "I'll show you at home. Just helped an aunt pick clothes for her son. She mentioned he's been watching Seven-Day Tales..."

Meanwhile, in the lab, Adrian Klein sneezed three times in rapid succession.

Vincent Macmillan immediately leaned in. "Someone must be thinking about you, eh?"

Adrian shot him an icy glare. "Seems you have too much free time."

Vincent's back stiffened.

"You're attending tomorrow's academic symposium at the Grand Bliss Hotel."

"No way!" Vincent groaned.

Natalie Blanchet smirked nearby. "Serves you right for running your mouth."

......

At six in the evening, the mall lights flickered on.

As Victoria and Evelyn debated dinner options, Simon Croix called.

"I've reserved a restaurant on the lower level. Come straight down."

Victoria hesitated. "We couldn't possibly—"

"Don't be polite," Simon chuckled warmly. "You came all the way to the capital for your book signing. As your host, dinner is the least I can do."

He'd chosen a fusion restaurant blending local flavors with broader appeal. Their private booth offered panoramic views of the antique street through floor-to-ceiling windows.

Simon meticulously accommodated everyone's preferences when ordering, even remembering Evelyn's dietary restrictions.

Throughout dinner, Victoria and Simon chatted animatedly about signing details and new book concepts. Evelyn noticed a long-absent sparkle in her mother's eyes.

This was a far cry from the irritable woman who used to snap at editors over the phone.

On their way to the restroom, Victoria suddenly mused, "We should thank the friend who introduced you to Editor Simon. Without him, I wouldn't be where I am today."

Evelyn nodded quietly. "I'll arrange it."

......

The next morning, a long queue already snaked through the book signing venue.
###Chapter 479

The signing was set up on the fifth floor of the downtown library.

Half an hour before the event, a long line had already formed outside the designated area.

Over twenty security personnel stood ready to maintain order.

A massive promotional display stood at the entrance, neatly showcasing Victoria Langley's latest novel Seven-Day Tales.

Beside it stood a life-sized poster featuring the book cover and chibi-style illustrations of the main characters.

"Oh my god! This many people?" A ponytailed girl gasped as soon as she stepped off the elevator.

Her boyfriend's eyes widened. "Holy crap!"

"It's just a book signing. Why's it packed like a concert?"

The girl was a seasoned fangirl with ever-changing celebrity obsessions. Last week, bored at home, she'd picked up a mystery novel her father left on the coffee table.

She'd only meant to kill time, but couldn't put it down.

Two all-nighters later, she'd binge-read Victoria Langley's entire bibliography.

Except for one slightly amateurish campus romance, the mystery-thrillers were absolute masterpieces.

Especially the decade-old titles—their bold themes and razor-sharp psychological insights left her stunned.

When she learned about the signing, she ditched her idol meet-and-greet without hesitation.

But outside the library, doubts crept in.

"We're already here," her boyfriend said, sealing her decision.

They'd planned to just peek and leave. Then—

"Where's my fan banner? Get it out!"

"You threw it in the trash downstairs!"

"Then go fish it out!"

"What about your idol?"

"Screw that! This vibe beats some D-list celeb event any day!"

With a resigned sigh, the boyfriend went dumpster diving.

He returned just as the signing began.

Banner held high, the girl dragged him toward the front—

Only to find rows of middle-aged readers in their forties and fifties.

"What... the hell?"
###Chapter 480

"Wait... why is everyone middle-aged?" The boyfriend blurted out in confusion.

The crowd erupted instantly.

"What's wrong with middle-aged people? Looking down on us?"

He frantically waved his hands. "No! I just meant at your age—"

"We appreciate literature! Got a problem with that?"

"Exactly!"

The boyfriend gaped. "Victoria Langley's fanbase is this... diverse?"

"Humph! We've been her readers since twenty years ago. Just got busy raising kids and building careers—no time for online fandom. But we always bought her books legally."

"Damn right! We didn't quit the literary scene—just had offline lives!"

Evelyn scanned the room, realizing the audience truly spanned generations.

After a brief host introduction, Victoria Langley glided onstage to thunderous applause.

"Oh my god—"

"Victoria looks so young and gorgeous!"

"That face... completely defies expectations!"

She wore an onyx qipao with a beige cardigan. The swaying hem accentuated her orchid-like grace.

"Thank you all for taking time—"

Victoria bowed deeply.

Sincerity always moved hearts.

The applause surged like tides.

Evelyn stood among the crowd, watching her radiant mother, lips curling unconsciously.

During signing time, the room buzzed with energy.

Jostled by the flow, Evelyn tried sidestepping when a sudden shove sent her stumbling forward.

Strong arms encircled her waist just before impact.

"Tha—Professor Klein?" Her eyes widened. "Why are you here?"

Adrian cleared his throat, releasing her.

His fingertips still tingled.

Her waist was impossibly slender.

He picked up the dropped book—Seven-Day Tales gleaming on the cover.

"Supporting your mother's release."

"You read this genre?"

"Mhm."

Evelyn's expression twisted. "Could've asked me for a signed copy. Why brave this mob?"

"Different meaning."

"How's it—"

Another wave of people crashed into them.

Face-to-face, the impact sent Evelyn colliding against his chest.

Her cheek pressed against his warmth. She froze.

Adrian stiffened.

Now she was in his arms. One slight pull...

His steady breath above, rapid heartbeat beneath her ear—Evelyn's own breathing hitched.

She tried retreating, but another shove came.

This time, the impact was firmer.

"Professor, I swear I didn't—"
###Chapter 481

Adrian Klein shielded Evelyn Langley through the dense crowd until they finally reached the outskirts.

Evelyn exhaled deeply.

She looked up to meet the man's amused gaze.

"Professor, I..."

Adrian pointed to her cheek. "Your hair is stuck to your face."

Flustered, she reached up but missed the spot.

His slender fingers brushed lightly across her skin, tucking the stray strand away.

"There."

Evelyn hastily tucked her hair behind her ear. The stifling crowd had left her sweaty, strands clinging to her neck.

The memory of crashing into his chest made her ears burn.

"Professor! I'll get us water!"

Before he could respond, she darted away.

Adrian called after her, but the elevator doors slid shut.

Evelyn fled to the first floor, ensuring he hadn't followed before relaxing.

Then she froze.

Ethan Winston was guiding two elderly people toward her.

The silver-haired gentleman wore a stern expression, deep creases between his brows. Beside him, a frail woman leaned on a cane, her eyes vacant.

Ethan looked equally startled.

He'd taken leave specifically to accompany his grandparents. They'd recently returned from abroad, and his grandmother had been hospitalized due to acclimation issues.

He hadn't expected to see Evelyn here.

Then he remembered—today was Victoria Langley's book signing.

After brief introductions, George Atlante studied the girl with subtle scrutiny.

Unlike the waifish young women chasing extreme thinness, her complexion glowed with health, her figure balanced. Those amber eyes held particular vivacity, reminding him of another pair from his memories...
###Chapter 482

Evelyn greeted the elderly couple with a gentle curve of her lips.

Old Mr. Atlante, rarely seen with such kindness, smiled warmly. "Hello."

Ethan's pupils contracted slightly.

In his memory, this iron-willed patriarch never smiled easily, especially not with younger generations—his standards were notoriously strict.

The family butler once mentioned how warm-hearted the couple had been in their youth.

Until that incident twenty years ago...

All tenderness froze the day Aunt Isabella disappeared.

Ethan's gaze swept over their deeply lined faces.

If they never found her, this would remain their lifelong regret.

"Ethan, I'm thirsty," Mrs. Atlante suddenly said.

"I'll get water." He turned to Evelyn. "Could you watch them for me?"

"Should I go instead?"

"Grandmother only drinks a specific brand of mineral water. The nearest vendor is three blocks away."

"Understood. Go ahead."

Ethan hurried off.

Eleanor pulled Evelyn down beside her. "Ethan says you're friends?"

"Yes, introduced through mutual friends."

Nathan's roguish grin flashed through her mind.

"That boy never mingled with girls growing up. You're the first!"

Evelyn suppressed a smirk. If only they'd seen his nightclub escapades.

"Boston has changed so much..." Mr. Atlante mused.

Evelyn smoothly steered the conversation toward urban development.

George arched a brow. "You're from here?"

"Nearby." Her eyes softened. "My hometown has peach groves stretching miles. Petals rain down every spring."

A glimmer sparked in the old man's clouded eyes. "I visited thirty years ago..."

Most juniors trembled in his presence.

Yet Evelyn treated him like any ordinary elder.

"How old are you, dear?" Eleanor interjected.

Evelyn answered politely.

The matriarch fired off several more questions.

Her responses were impeccable—courteous yet revealing nothing private.

George studied his wife with surprise.

Eleanor apologized softly. "Your voice... reminds me of someone."

Only then did Evelyn notice the woman's unfocused pupils.

In Eleanor's blurred vision, the young woman's silhouette gradually merged with a figure from her memories.

That inexplicable familiarity sent ripples through the old woman's barren heart.
###Chapter 483

The lab alarm shrieked piercingly.

Evelyn's head snapped up toward the display screen.

Red countdown numbers flashed rapidly.

"System shutdown in 60 seconds," announced the mechanical female voice coldly.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard.

Lines of code cascaded down the monitor.

"Just three more minutes," she shouted into the comm.

Nathan's deep voice crackled through the device. "We're out of time."

The lab lights began flickering.

Backup power was draining fast.

Evelyn bit her lower lip.

She typed one final command.

The screen plunged into darkness.

"Damn it!" Her fist slammed against the console.

Nathan appeared in the doorway.

A black briefcase gripped in his hand.

"We need to leave." His voice was taut.

Evelyn glared at the unresponsive equipment.

"The data transfer wasn't complete."

Nathan strode forward.

His fingers closed around her wrist.

"Now or never."

Boots pounded down the hallway.

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

"They're here."

Nathan yanked her toward the emergency exit.

Glass shattered behind them.

A bullet grazed her hair.

Nathan spun and fired.

A scream echoed down the corridor.

They dove into the elevator.

Nathan jammed the basement button.

As the doors slid shut, Evelyn saw the dark muzzles of assault rifles.

"Bang!"

The elevator shuddered violently.

Nathan shielded her with his body.

The car plunged downward.

Evelyn's heart stopped.

"Hold on," Nathan growled in her ear.

Impact came instantly.

The elevator crashed into the ground.
###Chapter 484

Adrian Klein noticed the logo on the shopping bag—it was from the high-end imported grocery store across the street. Evelyn Langley wouldn't go out of her way to shop there, which left only one possibility...

"Ethan Winston bought these?"

"Yeah. He went to visit his grandparents, and I helped take care of them. The elderly only drink this brand of mineral water."

Adrian reached out to take the bag.

Evelyn peeked inside the venue. "Is the book signing over?"

"Far from it." Adrian shook his head. "The line is still long. It'll take a while."

Remembering how crowded it was earlier, Evelyn had no desire to go back in.

Her gaze fell on the book in his hands. "Professor, are you going to wait in line for a signature?"

"I'll go last. No rush."

"Exactly!" Evelyn nodded enthusiastically in agreement.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly.

"Professor, why are you smiling?"

"Ahem!" He cleared his throat and straightened his expression. "Nothing."

"..." Evelyn studied him suspiciously, sensing he was hiding something but unable to pinpoint what.

The signing event, originally scheduled to end at 4 PM, dragged on until 5.

Adrian and Evelyn joined the very end of the line.

When the book opened before Victoria Langley—

"Mom, give me a special dedication!"

"Thank you, Mrs. Langley."

Victoria looked up to see her daughter standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Adrian.

Both were smiling at her with expectant eyes.

For a fleeting moment, Victoria imagined them as a perfect couple...

She shook her head to dispel the absurd thought and began writing:

For her daughter—"I will mount a long wind some day and break the heavy waves, and set my cloudy sail straight and bridge the deep, deep sea."

For Adrian—"I must ascend the mountain's crest; it dwarfs all peaks under my feet."

After the signing, Adrian offered to treat them to dinner.

William Langley quickly declined. "We couldn't possibly impose! We should be the ones treating you."

Adrian waved the signed book. "Mrs. Langley's personal signature is worth at least a meal, don't you think?"

William was speechless.

Of course it was!

Adrian first sought Victoria's opinion, who said she didn't mind.

Then he asked William.

"I'm fine with anything. Let Evelyn decide."

Only then did Adrian naturally turn to Evelyn.

"...How about hotpot?" she suggested.

All three agreed.

On the way—

Evelyn suddenly gasped.

"What's wrong?" William asked.

"That hotpot place is packed! There are 82 parties ahead of us. We'd have to wait at least two hours..."

Victoria suggested, "Should we pick somewhere else?"

"But their spicy broth is supposed to be amazing. People say the aroma makes it impossible to stop eating." Evelyn insisted.

This "people say" naturally came from her foodie friend Hannah Flores.

Adrian, who was driving, kept his eyes on the road and chuckled. "No need to change. I already reserved a table."

"Perfect!" Evelyn cheered.

Several minutes later, it dawned on her—

Wasn't this a last-minute decision?

How had he booked ahead?

And how did he know this was exactly the place she wanted?

Evelyn studied the profile of the man in the driver's seat, sinking into deep bewilderment.
###Chapter 485

The waitress led the four of them into a private dining room.

The bubbling hotpot broth arrived swiftly, its crimson oil swirling with an intoxicating aroma.

The restaurant Miaomiao recommended lived up to its reputation—fresh ingredients and a satisfyingly spicy kick.

Evelyn gulped water between bites, her tongue burning. At one point, she excused herself to splash cool water on her face in the restroom.

When she returned, a bowl of crystal-clear jelly dessert waited at her place.

"For the spice." Adrian adjusted his glasses.

She murmured thanks, warmth blooming in her chest.

When the bill came, Adrian quietly slipped away to settle it.

Next door, the night market blazed with lights and boisterous chatter.

Victoria tugged William toward the bustling stalls with infectious enthusiasm.

Evelyn lingered by the entrance, unwilling to leave Adrian behind.

He emerged moments later carrying a paper bag.

"Honeydew. Best eaten fresh."

She nodded obediently.

"Where are your parents?"

"Exploring the market."

"Shall we join them?"

"Yes!" Her eyes sparkled.

Vendors hawked their wares along the crowded aisles.

Evelyn paused at a hair accessory stall.

"How much for this?" She pointed to a gray hair claw.

"Ten yuan," the vendor answered brightly.

Evelyn frowned. "My hair's too thick. These never stay put."

The woman deftly demonstrated the technique.

The intricate motions made Evelyn's head spin.

When new customers arrived, the vendor turned away.

Just as Evelyn considered giving up, Adrian handed over the payment.

"Turn around." He picked up the hair claw.

"Huh?"

"Let me."

His fingers glided through her tresses with surprising gentleness.

A grazing touch against her nape sent shivers down her spine.

"Hold still." His voice dropped an octave.

The claw secured her thick locks perfectly.

"There."

She shook her head experimentally. Not a strand escaped.

"Your boyfriend has talented hands!" The vendor chuckled.
###Chapter 486

Adrian Klein's lips curved into a faint smile.

Evelyn Langley frantically waved her hands in protest. "He's not my—"

The shopkeeper cut her off.

"In ancient times, when a woman styled her hair, it symbolized marriage. Devoted husbands would personally comb and arrange their wives' hair—'gently brushing gossamer strands, lightly tracing spring mountains' with their fingers."

"Where I'm from, there's a saying: when a man combs a woman's hair, it means they'll grow old together. These days, most men won't even pick up a hairbrush, let alone style someone's hair."

The shopkeeper gave Adrian an approving thumbs-up. "Your boyfriend is wonderful—quick to learn and so patient."

Evelyn stomped her foot in frustration. "He's not—"

"Sweetheart, men like him are rare," the shopkeeper said sagely.

Evelyn: "..." She couldn't get a word in edgewise.

As they walked away from the stall, Adrian suddenly asked, "Did you learn it?"

"Huh?"

"How to style hair."

Evelyn choked.

She hadn't seen a damn thing the entire time—what was there to learn?

Adrian arched a brow. "Should I demonstrate again?"

"No, no!" Evelyn shook her head vigorously.

She was hopeless with her hands anyway.

Might as well...

Give up entirely.

At the end of the street, they ran into Victoria and William Langley.

"Mom—"

Victoria immediately noticed her daughter's hair. "That hair clip is lovely. Where did you get it?"

Evelyn pointed behind them.

Victoria studied her. "Did you do it yourself?"

Evelyn: "..."

"I knew it wasn't you! After all those years trying to teach you how to style hair, you never learned..."

Evelyn wished the ground would swallow her whole.

"The shopkeeper helped you, didn't she?"

Evelyn mumbled an indistinct response, desperate to change the subject.

Adrian stood nearby, an almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips.

"Adrian, what's so amusing?" William asked curiously, glancing around.

Adrian stroked his chin. "Was I smiling?"

"You definitely were!"

"Perhaps..." Adrian paused. "I remembered something funny."

William clapped him on the shoulder. "I get it! I make that same dopey smile thinking about your aunt."

A flicker of emotion passed through Adrian's eyes.

"Speaking of which, Adrian—someone as outstanding as you shouldn't be single. Is work keeping you too busy?" William said enthusiastically. "Should we have your aunt introduce you to someone? There are several new female teachers at her school..."

Adrian nearly choked. "That won't be necessary."

"Don't be shy with your uncle!"
###Chapter 487

"No need, I..." Adrian Klein's Adam's apple bobbed slightly. "There's someone I like."

"What?!" William Langley sprang up from the couch, eyes wide as saucers. "Seriously? Did you confess? Why haven't you won them over yet?"

The rapid-fire questions hit like machine gun rounds.

Adrian instantly regretted speaking.

The group parted ways outside.

Adrian turned left, fishing out his keys. The Langleys went right—Victoria glanced back with a warm smile.

"Sorry for making you spend so much today."

"Getting your signed book was worth every penny."

Fine wrinkles appeared at the corners of Victoria's eyes as she laughed.

Evelyn stood before the bathroom mirror.

Her fingers automatically reached to tie up her hair, only to brush against the cool metal of a hair claw.

She'd forgotten it was already pinned up.

Shaking her head vigorously, the bun stayed perfectly in place.

Tsk—

Not bad at all.

Why couldn't she master this skill?

It made no sense...

Infuriating!

In the master bedroom, Victoria had just settled in when her phone buzzed.

A message from editor Simon Croix.

Victoria, fantastic news!

Seven-Day Tales sales have broken records again—five production companies are bidding for adaptation rights

First print run completely sold out—factory rushing additional copies

Second royalty payment processing now

Didn't call to avoid disturbing you

Victoria launched herself at William like a flying fish.

William grunted from the impact.

Another ding sounded.

Bank notification: $326,800 deposited.

Victoria counted the zeros three times.

Already?

Another three hundred grand?

Plus future licensing fees...

"Honey, we're going to be rich!"

She said "we."

William's eyes suddenly stung.

"I'm sorry, Victoria..."

"Stop right there!" She covered his mouth. "Don't you dare say 'I'm useless' or any of that nonsense."

William waved his hands. "I meant—sorry I'm about to become a kept man! Old Xie will die of envy!"

He referred to a colleague who constantly competed with him over their hydrangea gardens.

Miles away, Professor Xie sneezed twice in succession.

Victoria pinched William's cheek. "That's more like it! Only insecure men resent their wives' success."

William nodded vigorously. "Exactly! Absolutely!"
###Chapter 488

A husband taking pride in his wife is only natural.

......

With the book signing successfully concluded, Victoria Langley finally had time to fulfill her promise. She asked Evelyn to arrange a dinner to thank Julian Roscente.

The restaurant chosen was the seafood fine dining establishment atop SKP Mall.

With limited daily seating and prices equivalent to half a month's salary for the average person, Evelyn had to reserve three days in advance.

Victoria's reasoning was simple: sincerity should be expressed in the most tangible way.

And indeed—

Julian's eyebrows lifted slightly upon hearing the restaurant's name before settling into understanding.

A proper thank-you deserved an equally proper setting.

Friday evening.

Julian arrived ten minutes early, only to find the Langley family already waiting in the private room.

Sophia Laurent had also been invited, but she was buried in a project, having pulled two all-nighters in a row.

Evelyn pressed, "You're really not coming? Julian will be there."

Sophia scoffed, "Since when does his presence dictate my plans?"

"You're dating, aren't you? Perfect chance for him to drive you home."

"Cut the act! You know exactly what our 'relationship' is—fake!"

Inside the private room—

Julian demurred, "You're too kind, Mr. and Mrs. Langley. It was nothing, really."

"Nonsense," William Langley shook his hand firmly. "Thanks to your introduction to editor Simon Croix, Seven-Day Tales was published without a hitch."

Victoria nodded in agreement, smiling.

The couple appeared younger than expected.

William carried himself with scholarly grace, tall and poised. Victoria, in a moon-white qipao with her hair elegantly coiled, stood beside her husband like a painting come to life.

As they took their seats, course after exquisite course arrived.

William brought out a prized vintage liquor, filling Julian's glass first—

"Kindness should be repaid tenfold. Bottoms up."

"Please, don't stand on ceremony," Julian quickly raised his own glass. "Just call me Julian."

"Then I won't hold back, son." William laughed heartily.

Three rounds of drinks later, Julian found himself in an unusually relaxed dinner.

William quoted classics effortlessly but never pressured anyone to drink, only suggesting moderation enhanced the mood.

Julian listened, captivated. Having struggled with certain subjects since childhood, he'd always held deep respect for the erudite.

As the evening wound down, Julian reached for his car keys.

Evelyn waved her phone. "Already called a ride. It'll be here any minute."

Watching the Langley family's car disappear into the night, Julian exhaled softly—

"With in-laws like these, what more could anyone ask for?"
###Chapter 489

"Hmm?"

"So this was intentional?"

"Or just an oversight?"

Wu Di tilted her head, eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Noah's ears instantly flushed pink.

"It...it was left on purpose," she murmured, fingers nervously twisting the hem of her shirt.

At the dining table, the elderly couple mechanically chewed their food.

Chopsticks rose and fell, but their gazes kept drifting away.

As night deepened...

"Sweetheart, come here." Li Yue set down her utensils and beckoned Wu Di closer.

Wu Di approached with a puzzled expression. "What is it, Mom?"

Li Yue took a deep breath.

"I don't object to you liking girls."

"After all, you used to be a rough guy. Now that you've changed genders, it's natural your orientation stayed the same."

"But I must remind you - don't fall for someone just because of their looks."

Wu Di nodded seriously. "Mom, she's genuinely a good person."

Li Yue's expression softened slightly.

"That's good then."

"We won't interfere with you young people's affairs."

"I just want you to find true happiness."

"By the way, deities might not need sleep, but we mortals can't stay up all night."

Wu Di smiled obediently. "Goodnight, Mom."

Li Yue watched her daughter leave.

The moment the door closed, she turned to her husband.

"Let's sleep. Don't disturb the young couple."

The married couple exchanged knowing smiles.

Amidst the rustling of pulled-up blankets, the bedroom plunged into darkness.
###Chapter 490

"Hey..." Dylan Lowell glanced around. "Are you two playing relay? Just leaving like that?"

The gathering he'd worked so hard to arrange dissolved in an instant.

Julian Roscente and Nathan Evans left one after another. Dylan stared at the empty private room. "Wait for me..."

The three men stood at the club entrance, each pulling out their phones to call designated drivers.

Dylan fished out a cigarette and placed it between his lips, but couldn't find his lighter.

"Julian, got a light?"

Julian gestured toward his car. "Backseat. Get it yourself."

Dylan opened the door and bent down to search.

"Found it..."

He lit his cigarette and tossed the lighter back to Julian.

Spotting a pale yellow shawl on the backseat, Dylan smirked suggestively. "Since when do you play in cars?"

Julian frowned. "Play what?"

"Don't play dumb. That's obviously a woman's shawl—pale yellow too. Spill it—which mistress left it behind?"

"Bullshit! That belongs to Evelyn's mother. I'm returning it tomorrow."

Dylan's eyes widened. "Evelyn's mom? Why would her stuff be in your car?"

Nathan subtly shifted half a step closer.

Julian started to explain, then noticed their gossipy expressions and deliberately drew out his words. "Well..."

Dylan stamped his foot impatiently. "Out with it!"

"None of your business."

"Of course it's my business! Last month when I broke my leg in the hospital, Evelyn came to visit me. Since she cares so much, shouldn't I know more about her?"

"Oh? Evelyn visited you?" Julian deliberately raised his voice, glancing sideways at Nathan.

Nathan pretended to adjust his cufflinks, but his ears were perked up.

Dylan boasted, "Of course! Evelyn treats me really well!"

Julian nodded. "True. Tonight she even treated me to a seafood feast."

"Why would she take you to dinner?" Dylan grew even more curious.

"Well..."

"There's a reason, right?" Dylan rolled his eyes. "Whatever, keep your secrets!"

Just then their drivers arrived. Julian waved. "Later."

Dylan gave a casual wave back.

But Nathan kept staring at Julian's taillights until they disappeared into the night.

Why?

Why could she smile so brightly for Ethan, visit Dylan in the hospital, share dinner with Julian...

Yet refuse to even glance his way?

"Nathan?"

Nathan snapped back to attention. "Hmm?"

"Where to next?"

Instead of answering, Nathan suddenly extended his hand. "Got a cigarette?"

Dylan quickly offered one.

But the lighter had already been returned to Julian.

Nathan rolled the unlit cigarette between his fingers, his eyes dark and unreadable.

"Dylan...was I really wrong?"
###Chapter 491

"What?" Dylan froze, momentarily stunned.

"Was I wrong to break up with Evelyn back then?"

Dylan's expression instantly turned complicated. "Nathan, you're only realizing this now?"

Nathan remained silent.

"Evelyn was amazing! If it were me, I'd have treasured her—"

Dylan immediately regretted his words.

"I mean, if I had your luck, I'd never let her go."

A woman like that comes once in a lifetime.

"On your birthday, she went out of her way to celebrate with you, and you dumped her in front of everyone. I was speechless!"

"Julian even told me you'd regret it someday."

He just didn’t expect karma to strike so fast.

He’d thought they’d keep dragging things out, given their history. But this time, Evelyn was done for good...

"Nathan, I get how you feel, but Evelyn—"

"I know I messed up. I apologized." Nathan stared at the cigarette crushed between his fingers. "But she won’t forgive me."

"What should I do?"

Dylan hesitated.

Knowing Evelyn, there was no chance of reconciliation.

But how could he say that?

Seeing Nathan’s desolate expression, he couldn’t bring himself to—

"Nathan, there are plenty of great women out there. Why not move on? Maybe you’ll find someone better?"

Nathan laughed bitterly, the cigarette disintegrating in his palm. "Yeah, there are plenty. But Evelyn? There’s only one."

Dylan had no response.

If only he’d realized sooner.

"Driver for order 5593?"

"Here!" Dylan quickly waved. "Nathan, I gotta go. Take care of yourself."

He hesitated before adding, "Stay strong."

Watching Dylan leave, Nathan didn’t move.

The dim streetlight cast a lonely glow over his silhouette.

The next day dawned clear and bright.

Sunlight bathed the city in warmth, a gentle breeze in the air.

After their last trip to the museum, William suggested visiting a garden.

Popular spots were too crowded for a spontaneous outing.

"...Let’s go to Yi Garden!"

Originally the private estate of a wealthy merchant named Yi, the garden had a storied past.

Built as a summer retreat for a Ming dynasty prince, it was later gifted by Emperor Qianlong to a nobleman, then passed down as a dowry.

After changing hands multiple times, it was purchased by salt merchant George Atlante during the Republic era and renamed "Yi Garden."

Before the war, the Atlante family often summered there with their relatives.

After economic reforms, the garden was returned to its rightful owners.

"...And then?" Victoria listened intently, her eyes alight with curiosity.

"That’s it." Evelyn stood before the final exhibit panel.

It detailed Yi Garden’s turbulent history, listing every owner and their stories from ancient times to the present.
###Chapter 492

Victoria's fingertips traced the words on the display plaque. "Does it mention the current owner?"

Evelyn leaned closer to examine it. "No specific name."

Victoria frowned. "Returned to the Yi family after the economic reforms... If it's private property, why is it open to the public for free?"

Something felt off.

The family of three walked east along the cobblestone path. The garden unfolded in picturesque layers—pavilions and towers nestled among lush greenery.

"This place is enormous," William remarked, snapping photos with his camera. "We've been walking for fifteen minutes and still haven't seen half of it."

Beyond a moon gate, a bamboo grove appeared. A breeze rustled the leaves, carrying their delicate fragrance.

"A winding path leads to secluded tranquility," Evelyn murmured.

The bamboo path opened into a clearing. At its end stood a grand main hall with vermilion doors and upturned eaves.

"Main Hall," Victoria read the plaque aloud. Suddenly, her vision blurred.

Fragmented images flashed—sunlight through latticed windows, a child hopping on brick tiles, someone calling her childhood nickname...

"Mom?" Evelyn's voice snapped her back.

William looked concerned. "Tired?"

Victoria forced a smile. "Just... this place feels familiar."

Her fingers brushed a pillar, finding shallow scratches—childish doodles.

"The kids who lived here must've been happy," Evelyn said wistfully.

On their way back, they took a different route. The winding rock formations disoriented them.

"We're lost," Evelyn stopped. "The signs are gone."

Yet Victoria heard herself say, "The exit's this way."

The words surprised even her.

How did she know?

Evelyn followed eagerly. After several corridors and rock gardens, an inconspicuous gate materialized.

Street noise flooded in as they stepped out.

Evelyn gaped. "Mom, how—"

Victoria stood frozen, the bustling avenue stirring an inexplicable sense of recognition.
###Chapter 493

Victoria Langley had always been terrible with directions.

Even in her own neighborhood, taking a different exit could leave her completely lost.

"Mommy, how did you find the way?" her daughter asked, blinking curiously.

Victoria froze. "I...just felt like going that way. Tried it and..."

William Langley chuckled as he wrapped an arm around his wife. "Your mother is my compass!"

Both father and daughter assumed it was mere coincidence.

But Victoria couldn't help glancing back.

Those winding corridors and hidden pathways seemed imprinted in her memory.

......

At the same moment, Ethan Winston accompanied his grandparents on their nostalgic return.

After more than a decade, the main hall remained unchanged.

Eleanor Atlante's trembling hands caressed each piece of furniture.

"Look, George. This vase—it was always Isabella's favorite."

She could almost see her daughter standing on tiptoes, carefully polishing the porcelain.

"Little Bella watches fish, picks bamboo leaves, makes wine—who will drink it?"

"Daddy will! Heehee—"

The memory of that laughter remained painfully clear.

George Atlante swallowed hard. "We promised we wouldn't cry."

Ethan spoke gently, "Grandmother, your eyes have just started healing."

Years of grief had damaged the elderly woman's vision.

Countless specialists had examined her, prescribing endless remedies.

The last TCM doctor sighed. "Emotional wounds require emotional medicine."

Eleanor wiped her tears. "You're right. I mustn't cry. What if Bella returns and can't see me?"

The old man forced a smile. "Remember? Whenever little Bella cried, your eyes would redden too."

"Of course. And you always scolded her with that stern face."

Over twenty years without a single clue.

Others urged them to move on.

But the elderly couple never wavered in their belief—

Their daughter would come home.
###Chapter 494

At an age meant for peaceful retirement, yet forced to cross oceans.

Ethan's heart stirred faintly, though his expression remained unchanged. "Grandma, let's take a walk in the backyard."

"Yes, yes! Minmin always loved the swing back there..."

As he supported the elderly woman, his phone vibrated abruptly.

The flashing name darkened his eyes instantly. He flipped the phone face down with swift precision.

"Grandma, I need to take this call."

"Go ahead."

Only when he reached the courtyard did he answer. "Mother."

"Why did it take so long?" Isabella's voice carried distinct displeasure. "Where are you?"

"Handling business." His tone stayed even.

"What business? Who are you with?"

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly. "I'm not a child who needs to report my every move."

"Report?" Isabella scoffed. "I'm the one being kept in the dark! Why wasn't I told about your grandparents returning?"

A beat of silence.

"I knew it!" Her voice sharpened abruptly. "You're with them right now, aren't you?"

"..."

"Send me the address. I'm coming over."

His gaze turned icy. "Grandmother needs rest."

"What's that supposed to mean? I'm her daughter!" Her voice turned shrill. "Are you all treating me like some monster?"

For years, her parents had preferred contacting their grandson over speaking with her.

Every call ended hurriedly.

"You know the reason." His voice chilled.

"Say it! I'd love to hear your explanation!"

His jaw tightened.

"I won't argue." One final restraint.

"We're settling this today!" Isabella pressed relentlessly. "I'm your mother!"

"Fine." He drew a steadying breath. "Grandmother still hasn't recovered from what happened. The doctors said she can't handle stress. Why do you think Grandfather brought her back so suddenly?"

Sudden silence on the line.

Ethan ended the call and returned inside.

"Ethan, who was it?"

"Work matters. All handled now."

"That's good."
###Chapter 495

Isabella stared at the darkened phone screen before violently sweeping the crystal glass off the coffee table.

Shards of glass scattered across the floor, refracting harsh sunlight.

"Madam..." The maids stood trembling nearby.

"Out! All of you—get out!" Isabella pointed at the door, her manicured nails nearly piercing the air.

The staff scurried away.

She collapsed onto the sofa, chest heaving.

For years she'd bent over backward to please his parents.

The old man had gradually softened—from icy disdain to civil tolerance.

But his mother...

Polite words couldn't mask the disgust in those eyes.

"Sir is home."

Before the butler finished speaking, Edward strode in.

His gaze swept the wreckage, lingered on Isabella for half a second, then turned toward the stairs.

"Nothing to say?" She shot to her feet.

Undoing his cufflinks, Edward didn't look back. "Do as you please."

Everything here was replaceable.

"Edward! I'm your wife!" Her voice shook. "Can't you show me basic concern?"

He raised an eyebrow. "Who upset you today?"

"..."

"After all these years, why the sudden drama?"

Isabella clenched her fists. "I just learned your parents returned a week ago. Your son knew and kept it from me!"

She glared at his back. "...Did you know too?"

Edward turned calmly. "Yes. Had dinner with them two days ago."

Her vision darkened. "You knew?!"

"Problem?"

"You knew and didn't tell me?! Everyone knew except me! What am I in this house?!"

He frowned.

"First, no one realized you were uninformed. Second, even the staff knew. Why didn't you?"

Always her fault.

Everything was always her fault.

Isabella snapped—

"Do you think I deserve your parents' hatred?"

"Neither my husband nor my son considers my feelings."

"My own parents visit, and you dine with them alone. Is that appropriate?!"

Edward watched her coldly. "They're your parents and my in-laws. What's wrong with sharing a meal?"

"In-laws?" She laughed bitterly. "Right—whether you married me or my sister, they'd still be your in-laws, wouldn't they?"

His expression darkened. "Don't be absurd."

"Am I wrong? You visit them religiously every year—never taking me."

She locked onto his eyes. "Exactly whose filial duty are you performing?"

Edward's gaze turned glacial. "You know exactly why you're not invited."
###Chapter 496

"So...you all blame me, don't you? Mom, Dad, and you!" Isabella sneered, her eyes glinting with madness. "Just because I went out with Victoria that day, and she disappeared while I came back alive—so it's all my fault?"

"Did you wish I'd died out there too?"

"Enough!" Edward's face darkened, his gaze sharp as a blade. "One more word and you'll regret it."

"Hahaha...Twenty-eight years, and you're still dreaming?" Tears streamed down Isabella's face as she laughed. "It's understandable for Grandpa and Grandma—Victoria was their precious biological daughter. But you, Edward?"

"We've been married for over twenty years. Our son is about to get married, yet your heart still belongs to her?" Her voice rose to a shriek. "How pathetic!"

Slap!

The sharp sound of the blow echoed through the living room.

Edward's hand remained suspended in the air, his knuckles white.

His eyes were glacial. "Last warning. Watch your mouth."

Without another word, he turned and walked out, not even bothering to grab his coat.

"Edward! You heartless bastard!" Isabella screamed at his retreating figure.

Why?

Why does someone who vanished twenty-eight years ago still hold everyone's hearts?

Just because she was adopted, and Victoria was their real daughter?!

Meanwhile, Ethan followed his grandparents through the garden.

Hidden deep within the bamboo grove was a small gate.

"There's a door here?" Ethan said in surprise. "I've been here so many times and never knew."

George chuckled warmly. "Your aunt used to sneak out through here as a child. She thought we didn't know."

At the mention, Eleanor's eyes softened with nostalgia.

The narrow alley remained almost unchanged—cobblestone path, weathered walls, and only a sliver of sky visible above.

"Everything else has changed, except this place," the old man mused.

"Dad and I bought the surrounding three streets," Ethan said quietly. "No plans to develop them. We'll keep them just like this."

Eleanor's eyes glistened. "Your father...that's thoughtful of him."

"The food street ahead has changed quite a bit. Shall I take you for a stroll?"

The elderly couple agreed readily.

A long queue stretched in front of Tongtaihe Bakery.

"Is that Tongtaihe?" Eleanor squinted.

"Yes. It's an old establishment—now a viral sensation," Ethan said with a smile. "Why don't you both rest at the teahouse? I'll join the line."

"Victoria loved their mung bean cakes..." the old woman murmured.

Just as Ethan stepped into the queue, someone called his name.

"Ethan?"

He looked up to see Evelyn waving at him from ahead. "It really is you! The great CEO waiting in line?"

"What are you doing here?" His lips curved unconsciously.

"Showing my parents around Yi Garden." She gestured to the teahouse next door. "They're resting there. I'm here for mung bean cakes."

Because Mom suddenly had a craving.
###Chapter 497

Victoria Langley suddenly stopped at the street corner, her gaze falling on an unassuming old-fashioned pastry shop.

"I want mung bean cakes," she murmured softly.

Evelyn Langley followed her mother's line of sight. The shop's facade was worn, its sign faded, even the glass display window coated with a thin layer of dust. Only by approaching the counter could one make out the blurred handwriting on the menu.

Mung bean cakes topped the list.

"Mom, how did you know they sell mung bean cakes here?" Evelyn asked curiously.

Victoria frowned slightly. "I just had a feeling they would. And that they'd taste good."

William Langley caught up with them, chuckling. "Your mother has a nose sharper than a bloodhound. She can sniff out quality from a mile away."

Ethan Winston's voice suddenly came from behind them. "What a coincidence. I'm here for mung bean cakes too."

"Who are they for?" Evelyn turned to face him.

"My grandmother." Ethan gestured toward a nearby teahouse. "She got tired from walking and is resting there."

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Your grandmother is here? She missed me at the bookstore signing last time. This is perfect—I can finally meet her."

While queuing, Evelyn deliberately ordered two portions of mung bean cakes and handed one to Ethan.

"How much do I owe you?" Ethan pulled out his phone.

"Don't worry about it. It's my treat for your grandmother." Evelyn blinked playfully. "You didn't hesitate when you bought me water last time."

A faint smile tugged at Ethan's lips.

Inside the teahouse, Eleanor Atlante leaned against the window with her eyes closed. At the sound of approaching footsteps, she slowly opened them.

"Grandmother, this is Evelyn," Ethan introduced gently. "She brought you mung bean cakes."

The elderly woman's face brightened. "Oh my, I can't possibly let such a sweet girl spend her money on me..."

Evelyn quickly explained, "I was already in line, so it was no trouble at all."

Eleanor reached out to take Evelyn's hand, then hesitated. "Child... may I touch your face? My eyes aren't what they used to be. I'd like to know what you look like..."

Evelyn's heart softened. Just as she was about to agree, William's voice suddenly called from upstairs. "Evelyn!"

Everyone looked up. William stood by the second-floor railing, waving. Beside him, Victoria was already descending the stairs at a brisk pace.

"Those are my parents," Evelyn told the elderly couple. "They're coming over now—perfect timing for introductions."

As Victoria drew nearer, Evelyn noticed her mother's face had turned unnaturally pale.
###Chapter 498

"Sure." Evelyn's eyes curved into crescents.

She picked up the dessert box on the table. "Would you like to try some mung bean cake first? Let me get you a piece."

Before the elderly woman could respond, Ethan's phone rang abruptly.

A frantic voice came through the line. His expression darkened instantly. "Understood. Keep things steady. I'll be right there..."

Hanging up, he gave Evelyn an apologetic look. "An emergency at the company. I have to leave."

Turning to the elderly couple, he said, "Grandfather, Grandmother, let me take you home first. We'll go out together another day?"

"Of course. But Evelyn's parents—" They hadn't met them yet.

Evelyn quickly interjected, "It's fine. There will be plenty of opportunities later."

By the time Victoria and William approached the teahouse, Ethan's car had already driven off.

"Who were those two?" Victoria asked curiously.

"Ethan's grandparents. We met at the book signing," Evelyn replied casually.

Victoria nodded. "What a coincidence. Tired from walking? Ready to head home?"

"Let's stay out a little longer." Evelyn linked arms with her mother playfully.

Victoria chuckled indulgently. "Alright, let's keep exploring."

......

Inside the car, Ethan gripped the steering wheel with one hand while dialing his assistant with the other. "Proceed as planned. I'll be there in thirty minutes."

George asked with concern, "Is it urgent? We can take a taxi back."

"No need. Everything's arranged."

After a brief hesitation, he continued, "Grandfather, what are your plans for this trip? I know several ophthalmologists who could examine Grandmother."

George nodded. "You handle it."

"And..." Ethan chose his words carefully, "Mother has been thinking of you both. Knowing about Grandmother's eyes, she reached out to specialists abroad. Perhaps... we could all have dinner together?"

The atmosphere in the car turned icy.

Eleanor refused outright. "I'm not feeling well. I won't be receiving guests."

The word "guests" stung Ethan's ears.

The old woman's stance was clear, so he didn't press further.

After a moment of silence, he changed the subject. "The ten-year lease for Yi Garden is about to expire. Should we renew it?"

George gazed at the passing scenery outside the window, his clouded eyes flickering with nostalgia. "Yes. Another ten years."

If Isabella ever returned, at least the house would still feel like home.
###Chapter 499

The crisp autumn afternoon breeze carried Victoria Langley's contentment as she concluded her garden tour.

At dawn the next day, the high-speed rail station buzzed with travelers.

Evelyn Langley watched the golden couple disappear through the ticket gates. Turning, she nearly collided with a breathless Simon Croix.

"Professor Langley!" Simon lifted a bulging parcel. "All the fan letters are here."

Victoria's eyes sparkled as her fingertips traced the package's surface.

......

Sunlight pierced the clouds while Evelyn hung freshly laundered sheets on her balcony.

The autumn wind tousled her hair as she turned to reorganize the closet.

Winter garments retreated into storage boxes, making way for fall attire.

When she next checked the clock, it read 2 PM.

Two lonely tomatoes occupied the otherwise empty refrigerator.

Evelyn snatched her keys and dashed out.

At the stairwell landing, Adrian Klein ascended the steps.

"Grocery run?" His gaze flicked to her reusable tote.

She nodded.

Without hesitation, Adrian reversed direction.

Chilled supermarket air greeted them.

Crabs waved their claws inside the seafood section's glass tanks.

"Freshly caught, cooked to order!" The vendor beckoned enthusiastically.

As Evelyn accepted a plastic bag, a strand of hair escaped.

Her hands fluttered toward her bare wrist.

The gray hair claw glinted in her palm.

Her makeshift bun collapsed instantly.

Adrian's slender fingers combed through her dark tresses.

Three precise movements secured the silken strands into a neat chignon.

"Second time," he murmured.

At the weighing station, Adrian took the flour bag from her hands.

They moved between aisles with the seamless coordination of longtime partners.
###Chapter 500

The supermarket glowed brightly in the evening light. Adrian Klein paused his shopping cart in the household goods aisle. "Need anything?"

Evelyn Langley had been staring blankly at the laundry detergent on the shelf. She snapped out of her daze. "Yeah, we're almost out at home."

She stretched on her tiptoes to reach the body wash on the top shelf, catching Adrian loading items into the cart from the corner of her eye.

Towels, slippers, storage bins...

The once-empty cart now resembled a small mountain.

At the checkout, a long line had formed. Adrian pulled out his wallet. "I'll pay."

Evelyn nodded. "Keep the receipt. We'll split it later."

He motioned for her to exit first. "It's too crowded here."

"Okay." She left through the no-purchase lane.

Ten minutes later, Adrian emerged carrying three bulging shopping bags.

Evelyn reached out. "Let me take one."

He sidestepped with surprising agility. "No need."

"But—"

The bags were neatly divided: one for groceries, the other two for their respective household items.

"Are you sure you don't need help?" she pressed.

"Positive."

Adrian carried the heavy bags up seven flights of stairs without breaking a sweat.

Evelyn took her bag at the doorway. "Let me see the receipt."

He cleared his throat. "Don't worry about it."

"That's not fair." She rummaged through her bag. "Mine doesn't have it. Yours must—"

Adrian suddenly retreated two steps, hiding his bag behind his back.

Evelyn froze.

"...I'll calculate it and text you later," he said, his voice tight.

"Fine." Though puzzled, she didn't press further.

She carried her bag inside to start dinner.

......

After skipping lunch, Evelyn first made a simple noodle soup.

A golden fried egg crowned the thin noodles, accompanied by emerald greens and pink ham slices.

Simple yet satisfying.

With her hunger satisfied, she tied on an apron to prepare crab roe buns.

Kneading dough, mixing filling, shaping buns...

Steam rose from the bamboo baskets. Two hours later, thirty plump buns emerged.

......

Only after closing his door did Adrian exhale in relief.

He stared at his shopping bag, realizing how suspicious his behavior must have seemed.

It wasn't like he'd done anything wrong.

With a wry smile, he began unpacking.

Towels, slippers, storage bins...

At the very bottom lay his true purchase—

Several new pairs of boxers.

No wonder he'd panicked when Evelyn reached for the bag.

Embarrassment? Or perhaps... guilt.

Whatever the reason, he'd frozen completely when she extended her hand.

Thankfully, his reflexes had saved him.

Settling on the couch, Adrian texted Evelyn:
"Total $542. My share $263. Just transfer me $279."

Evelyn, monitoring her steaming buns while scrolling through her phone, replied instantly:
"That cheap? You bought so much though."
"Towels, slippers, underwear, storage bins, dish soap, right?"
"All that for just over two hundred?"

Adrian's fingers froze mid-type.
