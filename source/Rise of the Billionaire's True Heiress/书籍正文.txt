###Chapter 1

"Evelyn, you've lived with the Lowells for fifteen years. I truly can't bear to see you go..."

Vincent Lowell stood in the center of the living room, his eyes reddened, voice choked with emotion—the very picture of a doting father reluctant to part with his child.

Evelyn Roland held her suitcase in one hand, a black backpack slung carelessly over her shoulder. She glanced at her adoptive father's theatrics, the corner of her lips curling into a cold smirk.

Had she not overheard his scheming in the study that night, she might have actually fallen for this hypocritical act.

At six years old, she'd been rescued from human traffickers by Charles Lowell. A head injury had stolen her memories, leaving her with only the face of her savior. The kind-hearted old man took her in as his own.

For the decade he lived, she'd known peace. But when his old illness flared up, even her skills could only extend his life by ten years.

Everything she'd done for the Lowells in secret, only Charles had known. On his deathbed, he willed her 10% of the family shares—ostensibly to protect her, but in truth, to ensure she'd continue safeguarding the Lowell empire.

She saw through it but didn't refuse.

The moment the funeral ended, Vincent's mask slipped. That night, she'd heard all three of them in the study, plotting how to drive her out.

"If we can't find her real parents, we'll frame her for scandal!" Margaret Hill's shrill voice still rang in her ears.

And Vincent? Not a single word of protest.

How laughable. All her sincerity, wasted on ungrateful snakes.

She didn’t care about the shares. Only Charles' kindness had tied her here. Now that he was gone, there was nothing left for her in this house.

"Goodbye, Mr. Lowell."

She turned, dragging her suitcase behind her, her voice icy and detached. The grief on Vincent's face froze instantly, twisting into something ugly.

"Ungrateful wretch!" Margaret sprang from the couch, her spite on full display. "Even a dog wags its tail before leaving. She can't even say a proper farewell!"

Beside her, Victoria Lowell—her mother’s spitting image with those sharp, upturned brows—sneered. "Mom, trash will always be trash. No amount of polishing in the Lowell mansion could turn her into a diamond. But it’s perfect—she’ll fit right back in that dumpster of a village."

To force her out, Vincent had paid handsomely to trace her roots—Jiangshui Village. The Rolands were the poorest family there, parents who scavenged for scraps, with four good-for-nothing sons.

She could imagine the life awaiting her.

A glint of malice flashed in Victoria’s eyes as she suddenly stood and shoved a wad of cash at Evelyn. "Here, little sister. Take this ten thousand. I wanted to write a check, but I doubt your village even has a bank..."

Lowering her voice, she added smugly, "Oh, and some good news—I’m pregnant with Nathan’s baby. He said a wild stray like you was never worthy of him. It’s always been me he loved—"

Evelyn’s crimson lips curved. "A toad with a slug—a perfect match. I’m just glad I didn’t get stained by such garbage. The stench is unbearable."

Victoria’s face turned livid. She yanked at Evelyn’s backpack—and with a clatter, a pure gold medal hit the floor.

"My piano competition medal!" Victoria shrieked dramatically. "You stole it!"

Margaret lunged forward. "I knew she was a thief! Search her bag!"

Vincent frowned. "Evelyn, is this—"

"Does it even need asking?" Margaret cut in shrilly. "She’s desperate! Butler, search her now!"

Amid the tension, Evelyn laughed.

From her bag, she pulled out a larger gold emblem studded with emeralds. "Recognize this?"

Victoria paled. "The Jury President’s Badge from the International Piano Masters?!"

"Compare the status, the weight, the value—which of hers even comes close?" Evelyn smirked, casually projecting surveillance footage onto the living room screen.

The video clearly showed Victoria slipping the medal into her bag.

Gasps filled the room.

Victoria scrambled to shut off the TV while Margaret spat, "You installed cameras in our home?!"

"How many times have you framed me? I only let it slide out of respect for Charles." Evelyn flicked the miniature camera on her backpack charm. "As for the badge... Did you really think the theft of a jury president’s emblem wouldn’t make headlines?"

The debt was repaid. These three clowns wouldn’t get another ounce of her courtesy.
###Chapter 2

Evelyn Roland's slender fingers traced the edge of her phone as her icy gaze swept over the three members of the Lowell family.

"Where Victoria's piano talent truly comes from—you know better than anyone." Her voice was frosty. "The compositions I wrote over the years more than repay the Lowells for raising me."

Vincent Lowell's expression darkened.

"After I turned twelve, I never spent a single cent of the Lowell family's money." The corner of her lips curled into a mocking smile. "And as for the Evans family engagement—shall I expose your schemes right here?"

Margaret Hill trembled with rage, but her husband gripped her arm to stop her.

A bead of sweat trickled down Vincent's temple. The crisis three years ago still haunted him. The old patriarch had claimed Evelyn was the one who secretly intervened. He’d refused to believe a teenage foster daughter could possess such influence.

"Evelyn, I’ve always treated you as my own—" he began, voice pleading.

"Enough." She cut him off. "From today onward, I have no ties to the Lowells. If you slander me again..." She paused, her eyes glinting dangerously. "I won’t hesitate to let the entire city know how the Lowells treat their foster daughter."

Just then, a flustered servant rushed in. "Sir! There’s a troublemaker at the gate claiming he’s here to pick someone up!"

Margaret shrieked, "Filthy trash! This family is cursed!"

Evelyn grabbed her suitcase and turned to leave. Behind her, Victoria’s triumphant laughter rang out. "A garbage collector dares compete with me?"

As she stepped through the gates, her phone buzzed.

"Withdraw all support from Lowell Enterprises," she said coolly.

A furious male voice erupted from the other end. "Those ungrateful snakes! If not for your behind-the-scenes maneuvering, they’d have gone bankrupt years ago! And that Victoria—stealing your compositions and flaunting them—"

"I’m going to find my birth parents," Evelyn interjected softly.

A brief silence followed. "What if—"

"I know what I’m doing."

The screech of tires cut her off. A black Maybach hurtled toward her.

With lightning reflexes, she braced against the hood, her scattered belongings strewn across the pavement.

"Watch where you’re going!" the driver barked.

Evelyn slammed her palm against the window. "No honking in residential zones. Get out and pick these up!"

A deep, magnetic voice spoke from the backseat. "Step out."

The driver immediately fell silent.

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to the rear seat. In the interplay of light and shadow, the man’s chiseled profile was sculpted perfection. But when she glimpsed the faint crimson flicker in his dark eyes, her pupils constricted.

That toxin... She’d only read about it in ancient texts.

"Sir," she suddenly smiled, radiant. "May I have your number?"
###Chapter 3

Sebastian Valdemar's thin lips curved into a dangerous yet captivating smirk. His frosty gaze swept past Evelyn Roland before settling on the trembling driver.

"Who gave you permission to pick things up?" His voice was low. "Get out and inspect the car. Record everything. Don't leave any room for fraud accusations."

The driver paled. "Yes! This young lady did bump into the front of the car. I'll check thoroughly."

He moved to open the door.

Evelyn let out a cold laugh and slammed it shut with one hand.

"Fraud?" She arched a brow. "You were the ones speeding through a residential area and blaring your horn. Does driving a luxury car make you above the law?"

The man's dark eyes locked onto her, gleaming like ink under the backlight. He scoffed. "So it's not fraud. Then stopping a car in the street to ask for contact details—that counts as harassment."

Evelyn nearly laughed out loud. She raked her eyes over him without restraint. "The poison in your body will cripple you within two years. You'll be bedridden, muscles atrophied, completely dependent. Harass you? For what? That pretty face?"

The driver gasped.

Was this woman insane? How dare she speak to Mr. Valdemar like that...

Sebastian's expression darkened instantly. How did she know about the poison?

"Who the hell are you?"

Evelyn leaned in slightly, her beautiful face alight with provocation. "Oh? Interested in me? Sorry, sir, we’re not acquainted. Keep this up, and I’ll sue you for harassment."

She threw his words right back at him.

With a bright, mocking smile, she released the car door and stepped back. "Weren’t you going to inspect the car? You take care of your vehicle, and you’ll compensate me for my things. Oh, and don’t forget to apologize properly."

The driver stood frozen, caught between a rock and a hard place.

Sebastian studied Evelyn for a long moment before growling, "Drive!"

The window rolled up, and the Maybach roared away in a cloud of dust.

Evelyn waved off the exhaust fumes, cursing the man’s insanity under her breath. As she bent to gather her scattered belongings, she noticed the Maybach was heading toward the Lowell estate.

A car with triple license plates meant extraordinary status. Since when had the Lowells befriended someone like that?

Inside the car, Sebastian’s relaxed posture was gone. He stared at his legs, his expression stormy.

Crippled? Dependent?

The woman’s words stabbed into him like knives. Coincidence, or could she really see through him at a glance? And those eyes—strangely familiar...

Evelyn dragged her suitcase to the gated community entrance, where an argument was still raging.

Three security guards stood ready with batons. Opposite them was a beat-up Santana, beside which a young man in a floral shirt was gesturing wildly. "Why can that car go in but not mine?"

Laughter rippled through the onlookers. Evelyn walked straight over. "I’m Evelyn Roland. Are you here to pick me up?"

The man stiffened, his slicked-back hair seeming to wilt in shock. He scrambled to adjust his appearance—this girl was nothing like he’d imagined.

With striking features, porcelain skin, and an innate regal air even in casual wear, she exuded icy allure. Yet her peach-blossom eyes held a mesmerizing blend of coolness and charm.

This was the delinquent girl from the files?

The private investigator must’ve been blind!

Dominic Laurent hastily straightened his collar, grinning ear to ear. "Hello! I’m your second brother’s best friend. Came specially to fetch you today."

Evelyn shoved her suitcase into his hands. "Thanks."

Dominic blinked, then eagerly yanked open the passenger door—only to pull it clean off its hinges.

The crowd erupted in laughter.

Without batting an eye, Evelyn got in, took the door, and slammed it back into place with sheer force.

Dominic’s jaw dropped.

Superhuman strength?!

He hurriedly stuffed the luggage into the trunk, climbing into the driver’s seat with an apologetic look. "Sorry, this car was fifth-hand when I got it..."

"It’s fine." Evelyn calmly buckled the patched-up seatbelt.

Dominic marveled inwardly. Gorgeous, easygoing, and not a gold-digger—he’d take a dozen sisters like this.

After five failed attempts to start the car, sweat beaded on his forehead. Those bastards—he’d asked for a junker, not scrap metal!

"Let me." Evelyn deftly pulled out a few wires and had the engine roaring in seconds.

"This car needs serious repairs. If you’re not selling it, I can fix it as payment for the ride." She dusted off her hands, buckled up, and closed her eyes to rest.

The effort of prolonging the old man’s life with acupuncture, followed by three days of vigil, had left her utterly drained.

Dominic excitedly whipped out his phone and typed furiously. Alex! Lend me your sister for a couple days! She’s amazing!

At Blenheim Palace in the capital...

Alexander Roland shot up from the sofa, his phone creaking in his grip. "Mom, Dad, I’m going to get my sister."

He bolted out the door. A silver Pagani screeched out of the driveway.

He never should’ve listened to Dominic’s stupid idea! If Evelyn thought the Rolands didn’t want her, his parents would skin him alive.
###Chapter 4

The rattling engine of the old Santana made Evelyn Roland's temples throb.

She massaged her aching forehead and turned to the window.

A road sign pointed unmistakably toward the capital.

"Dominic Laurent." Her voice was ice. "Jiangshui Village is south."

The man behind the wheel stiffened.

"Well..." He forced a laugh. "The Roland family moved to the capital years ago."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed, her knuckles cracking ominously.

"Over a decade ago," Dominic added hastily. "Better opportunities there..."

She scoffed and pulled out her phone to check the route.

The car lurched violently.

Evelyn's knees slammed into the dashboard.

"What was that?"

Dominic already had his seatbelt off, eyes gleaming. "A damsel in distress!"

An Audi sat half-ditched in a roadside gully.

A pale woman leaned against the trunk, sweat beading on her forehead.

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

"Get my bag!" she barked.

Before Dominic could react, she was at the woman's side, fingers on her wrist.

"Three months pregnant. Threatened miscarriage."

The woman's legs buckled. "Save my baby..."

"Lie down."

Evelyn unfurled her needle case. Silver flashed above the woman's abdomen.

Ten minutes later, the pallor faded.

"Call me next time." Evelyn scribbled a number. "I charge for this."

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Dominic sidled up. "I didn't know you could—"

A roar of engines cut him off.

A silver Pagani blocked their path.

The door swung open. A man's voice was dangerously calm. "Where are you taking my sister?"

When their eyes met, Evelyn's heart skipped.

"I'm your second brother," he said.

——

In a hospital room, Olivia Valdemar traced the edges of the note.

Her phone rang.

"Sis! Are you okay?"

"Thanks to a young miracle worker," she said softly. "You must meet her when you return."

###Chapter 5

Half an hour later, Evelyn stood before the grand gates of Blenheim Palace, taking in the imposing security and meticulously landscaped gardens. She silently thanked Dominic Laurent for crafting the perfect "impoverished" backstory for the Roland family.

If the Lowells discovered the truth, escaping their grasp wouldn't be so effortless.

Whether those fabricated documents were intentionally leaked by the Rolands as a diversion, she couldn't be bothered to investigate.

Fewer complications were always preferable.

Alexander studied her calm expression and finally exhaled in relief. He quickly grabbed her duffel bag. "Mom and Dad are waiting in the main hall. I—"

Before he could finish, two figures hurried toward them.

Edward Roland looked dignified in his tailored gray suit, exuding quiet authority. Beside him, Sophia Roland radiated timeless elegance, her well-maintained beauty accentuated by understated grace.

Their eyes locked onto Evelyn, instantly glistening with unshed tears.

Sophia pulled her daughter into a crushing embrace, dampening Evelyn's shoulder with her tears. "My Evelyn... I've finally found you..."

Evelyn stiffened.

No one had ever held her like this. Instinct screamed to push away, but the tremors wracking her mother's frame gave her pause.

Her raised hand hesitated before settling awkwardly on Sophia's back, patting once.

"I'm fine," she said flatly.

Sophia only wept harder. Edward steadied his wife, voice thick. "She just got home. Don't overwhelm her."

"Right, of course." Sophia hastily wiped her cheeks, then slid a luminous jade bracelet from her wrist onto Evelyn's. "This belongs to the lady of the house. It's yours now."

From the shadows, Isabella Langley dug her nails into her palms.

That bracelet—coveted for years—handed to this stray without a second thought!

Evelyn caught the venomous glare instantly, her eyes flashing icy for a heartbeat.

"This is Isabella, your sister," Sophia said, linking their hands. "You must look out for each other."

Isabella's eyes reddened on cue. "It's okay if Evelyn doesn't want to call me sister... I'm not really family anyway..."

Here we go.

Evelyn smirked inwardly.

"Don't flatter yourself," she said coolly.

The dining table groaned under lavish dishes. Sophia fluttered around, heaping Evelyn's plate.

Seizing the moment, Isabella piped up, "Evelyn, the university's adult education program is accepting applications if you want to continue your studies—" She gasped theatrically. "Not that your education is lacking!"

Silence fell.

Sophia frowned, but Evelyn set down her fork first.

"Pass."

"Sweetheart, I know you've suffered." Sophia squeezed her hand. "There's no rush. Let your father and brothers take care of you."

Edward opened his mouth, only to shut it under his wife's glare.

Under the table, he nudged his son.

Alexander discreetly shifted his foot—no way was he crossing Mom today.
###Chapter 6

All eyes were fixed on Evelyn Roland.

Isabella Langley clenched her silver chopsticks until her knuckles turned white. Blood ties meant nothing. They were just a genetic combination of Edward and Sophia Roland.

She was the jewel the Roland family had meticulously polished for twenty years.

Dinner had just ended when the butler rushed into the dining room, flustered.

"Young Master Alexander, there's someone outside claiming to be a business partner from your design company—"

Before he could finish, a whirlwind of a figure barged in.

The woman carried a stack of documents, her brow furrowed with urgency.

"My apologies for interrupting."

"I need to speak with Mr. Alexander immediately."

Evelyn glanced up, studying the tall middle-aged woman. Something about her seemed familiar.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Ms. Macmillan, what is the meaning of this?"

As CEO of KL Design Group, he'd been dealing with headaches from Penelope Macmillan of Vanity Jewelry. She'd developed a batch of premium sapphires but rejected every design KL presented.

"The summer sales season is approaching," Penelope said, her voice tense. "If we don't finalize these designs soon, it'll be too late."

"KL took this project. You need to see it through!"

Penelope?

Evelyn's lashes fluttered slightly.

So it was her.

Years ago, when Penelope's business failed and she contemplated ending her life, Evelyn had casually sent her a design sketch, suggesting she pivot to gemstone sourcing.

Now she helmed Vanity Jewelry.

The city truly was a small world.

"Business matters belong at the office," Alexander said coldly.

"I couldn't find you there!" Penelope stamped her foot in frustration. "When will the designs be finalized?"

She'd rejected every top designer at KL. No one could decipher what she wanted.

Alexander was ready to terminate the contract.

"Brother." Isabella's sweet, confident voice cut through the tension. "I studied jewelry design in London. Let me try."

She was a top graduate from London Design Institute, with dual degrees to boot.

After a hesitant pause, Penelope nodded.

"No need to wait. I can sketch it now."

Isabella motioned for the butler to bring paper and pen. Her hand flew across the page, completing the design swiftly.

Penelope examined the drawing. While not breathtaking, it had more life than the previous attempts.

"We'll go with this," she decided.

Edward beamed. "Isabella, you've saved the day."

"I should've had you design it from the start," Alexander said with a relieved laugh.

"We're family, after all." Isabella emphasized the word "family," her gaze flicking pointedly toward Evelyn.

"Would you like to try, Evelyn? Perhaps Ms. Macmillan will prefer your work."

The air turned glacial.

Evelyn lifted her eyes slowly, her gaze sharp as a blade.

Isabella's back prickled with cold sweat, but she held her ground.

Sophia frowned. "Isabella, don't be ridiculous."

Everyone knew Evelyn hadn't even finished college. Asking her to design jewelry was pure mockery.

"Mother, I heard Evelyn worked with jewelry at the Lowells..." Isabella's eyes glistened with unshed tears.

She'd done her research. Evelyn had been nothing more than a janitor at the Lowells.

A country bumpkin with a high school diploma, daring to compete with her?

"If Ms. Macmillan is satisfied, let's leave it at that," Edward said diplomatically.

But Evelyn rose and walked to the desk.

Trying to put her in her place on her first day home?

She rarely bothered with such games, but she wasn't a pushover either.

"Evelyn..." Alexander started, worried she'd humiliate herself.

Isabella smirked, anticipating the spectacle.

Evelyn picked up the pen, glanced at the sapphire photos, and let her wrist move effortlessly.

In under ten minutes, the design was complete.

Isabella scoffed. Anyone could doodle. Talent was what mattered.

Penelope approached, prepared to offer polite praise.

Then she saw the sketch.

Her entire body stiffened as if struck by lightning. Her hands trembled uncontrollably.
###Chapter 7

"This..."

Penelope Macmillan's hands trembled.

The design sketch slipped from her fingers, fluttering lightly to the floor.

The crowd quickly gathered around.

On the paper was a minimalist sapphire necklace design, its intricate hollowed-out craftsmanship perfectly accentuating the gemstone's natural brilliance.

Even Evelyn Roland, who knew nothing about jewelry, could see this design far surpassed Isabella Langley's work.

Isabella pushed to the front, her pupils contracting sharply.

How was this possible?

She stared at the sketch, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"My little sister draws so well," she forced a sweet, syrupy smile. "But... doesn't this look familiar?"

Her pointed gaze landed on Evelyn. "Plagiarism is an unforgivable sin in our industry."

The air turned icy.

"Impossible!"

Penelope suddenly shouted, her voice shaking with emotion.

She picked up the sketch with trembling hands, pointing at the small "C" mark in the bottom corner.

"This is..."

Her head snapped up, eyes red-rimmed.

With a thud, the formidable jewelry tycoon dropped to her knees before Evelyn.

"My savior! I've finally found you!"

Gasps filled the room.

Evelyn cursed inwardly.

Her habitual signature had given her away.

"Blossoming Prosperity..." Penelope choked out the cringe-worthy online alias.

Evelyn's eye twitched.

A username she'd casually chosen in middle school now sounded unbearably embarrassing.

"Get up," she muttered through gritted teeth.

But Penelope remained kneeling, tearfully recounting how a single design sketch had saved her career years ago.

"So..." Alexander Roland stared at his sister in shock. "You designed the Heart of Ruiya?"

Penelope nodded fervently.

Isabella stood in the corner, her nails nearly drawing blood.

Why?

After twenty years of meticulous effort, how could this bastard child outshine her?

"Did you study design?" Alexander asked.

Evelyn shook her head.

Study? Her five consecutive global design championship titles spoke for themselves.

Alexander's eyes lit up. "Join KL Design Group!"

Evelyn almost refused—until she imagined enduring Isabella's fake smiles every day.

"Fine."

Penelope looked ready to faint with joy, suddenly twenty years younger.

Sophia Roland warned her eldest son: "Take good care of your sister, or I'll dismantle your company!"

Alexander nodded rapidly.

Evelyn lowered her gaze.

This feeling of being protected... it was unfamiliar.

Sophia led her to a standalone two-story villa.

"Do you like it? We can redecorate tomorrow if not."

"It's perfect," Evelyn said softly.

That word—"Mom"—stuck in her throat, unspoken.

Isabella lurked in the shadows, venom swirling in her eyes.

This house she'd begged for had been waiting for its true owner all along.

"Come find me if you get scared, little sister," she cooed.

Sophia beamed, clasping their hands. "You two must get along."

"Goodnight." Evelyn shut the door directly in their faces.

Outside, Isabella sniffled. "Mother, does Evelyn hate me?"

"She just needs time to adjust," Sophia reassured.

Isabella clenched her fists.

Would Sebastian Valdemar's engagement be stolen from her too?

The shower stopped running.

Evelyn towel-dried her hair, noticing 200+ missed calls from Dylan Orlando on her private phone.

"What?" she answered.

"You actually went back to that backwater town?" Dylan screeched. "You make millions per commission! Why would—"

"My father is Edward Roland."

Dead silence.

"Ed... Edward Roland?!" Dylan's voice skyrocketed. "THE Edward Roland?!"
###Chapter 8

Evelyn Roland responded with a lazy "Mm-hmm," and Dylan Orlando on the other end of the line immediately exploded.

"Boss! You're actually the Roland family's heiress?!" Dylan's voice was so shrill it nearly pierced her eardrums. "This is like winning the genetic lottery!"

"Does this mean I get to be the rich sidekick now?" He chuckled shamelessly.

"Get to the point." Evelyn yawned, her tone icy.

To her, the Roland family's wealth meant nothing. She'd always been independent, never relying on anyone.

Besides, the thought of their tangled web of relatives was enough to give her a headache.

"Wait, don't hang up!" Dylan rushed to say. "CH Design Holdings' project in P Country is wrapping up. They're asking when to transfer operations back home."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened.

Over the years, she'd discreetly built numerous overseas ventures to avoid suspicion. Now, it was time to start reeling them in.

"CH isn't established enough domestically. We can't transfer directly." She paused briefly. "Stop taking new orders for now. We'll discuss details tomorrow."

"Got it!" Dylan agreed readily. "I'll pick you up at the Roland estate."

The next morning, Evelyn had barely stepped out of her room when Sophia Roland approached her.

"Did you sleep well, sweetheart?" she asked eagerly. "I made breakfast for you. Would you like something Western or—"

"No need." Evelyn declined flatly. "I have plans with a friend."

Sophia stood holding the homemade meal, watching her daughter walk away, her eyes dimming with disappointment.

From the second-floor landing, Isabella Langley observed the entire scene.

How long had it been since her mother cooked for her?

That ungrateful bitch. But fine—the sooner Sophia realized how unworthy Evelyn was, the better.

When she saw Evelyn get into an unfamiliar Maybach, Isabella's eyes flashed with malice.

Where would a girl from the Lowell family get such wealthy friends? Something was definitely fishy.

Dylan had chosen the newly opened Le Bar du Ritz for their meeting. Even in the morning, the bar was already bustling, the lights dim and hazy.

"Why here?" Evelyn frowned.

"Supporting a friend's new business," Dylan said with an appeasing smile. "Besides, places like this are ironically the safest."

Evelyn couldn't be bothered to argue and followed him to a booth.

Dressed simply in a white button-down and jeans, her bare face stood out starkly against the bar's neon glow.

Within ten minutes, multiple men had approached her, only to be met with glacial rejections.

"This is what you call 'quiet'?" She shot Dylan a sidelong glare.

Just as he opened his mouth to explain, another unwelcome guest appeared.

"Fancy seeing you here, beautiful." Dominic Laurent stubbed out his cigarette, eyes lighting up with delight.

After driving her back to the Roland estate, he hadn't been able to forget this intriguing girl.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, expression indifferent. "Do I know you?"

"Playing dumb?" Dominic grinned. "I'm the one who personally escorted you home."

"Oh." Her voice was frosty. "The guy with the fifth-hand Santana?"

Dominic's face flushed crimson. His friends behind him burst into laughter.

"Since when does Young Master Laurent drive such a wreck?"
"Fifth-hand? Hahaha, more like battle-scarred!"

Dylan was about to suggest moving to a private room when Dominic plopped down beside them.

"Little sister, places like this are full of creeps." He shot Dylan a meaningful look. "You should be careful."

Dylan's temper flared. "Who the hell do you think you are? Back off from Evelyn!"

"I'm a friend of her brother!" Dominic's face darkened. "You're the one bringing a girl here—what are your intentions?"

"My relationship with Evelyn is none of your—"

Dylan nearly blurted out "boss" before Evelyn yanked his arm.

The two men squared off, each grabbing one of Evelyn's arms in a tug-of-war.

"Come with me!" Dominic demanded.
"She came with me!" Dylan refused to back down.

Evelyn winced at the painful pulling. Just as she was about to snap, a mocking laugh cut through the noise.

She turned and locked eyes with a pair of amused ones.

The cripple from the Maybach?
###Chapter 9

Sebastian Valdemar leaned against the second-floor railing, gazing down at Evelyn Roland in the booth below.

His slender fingers idly swirled the glass in his hand, a flicker of mockery in his eyes.

Evelyn suddenly looked up, as if sensing his stare.

Their eyes locked across the space.

As he turned to leave, she distinctly heard a derisive scoff.

"Hmph."

Evelyn averted her gaze, focusing on the two persistent heirs vying for her attention.

"Beautiful, care for a drink?"

"Back off. I asked first."

The men bickered like rutting peacocks, faces flushed with competition.

A wave of boredom washed over her.

With a twist of her wrist, she effortlessly broke free from their grasp.

"Get lost."

Dylan Orlando immediately took three steps back.

He knew his boss's temper all too well.

Dominic Laurent, however, refused to give up. He reached for her shoulder.

Evelyn drove her elbow into his stomach with surgical precision.

"Gah—"

Dominic doubled over, sweat beading on his forehead.

The woman hit like a truck.

Irritated, Evelyn left the booth and headed for the secluded lounge area.

In the shadows, Isabella Langley clenched her phone.

"Slut. Can't resist flirting, can you?"

She dialed a number, her lips curling into a venomous smile.

Meanwhile, Sebastian was ushered into the VIP section by his friend Zachary Merouin.

"Rare to see you here. What brings you?"

Zachary slid a freshly mixed drink toward him.

Sebastian's eyes unconsciously scanned the room.

"Keep this place clean."

"Excuse me?" Zachary looked baffled.

"No illegal activities." Sebastian's voice was ice. "Especially trafficking."

Zachary nearly leapt from his seat. "Sebastian! Who do you take me for?"

"Then control your patrons."

The memory of those cool, composed eyes unsettled him.

He'd misjudged her.

That woman wasn't some doctor. She was just a...

"Something's off." Zachary narrowed his eyes. "Since when do you care about this?"

Sebastian ignored him, downing his drink in one go.

Soon, a group of women approached.

He rejected each with a frosty glare.

Not far away, Evelyn scoffed.

Playing the prude.

As she turned to leave, she caught the bartender slipping something into Sebastian's glass.

The lighting was dim, but she saw it clearly.

"Serves you right."

She headed for the restroom.

The moment she pushed the door open, a strange sweetness filled the air.

"Damn it!"

She held her breath, but not before inhaling traces of the drug.

Her limbs grew heavy. Heat pooled low in her abdomen.

Aphrodisiac.

Three hulking men blocked the exit.

"Hey pretty, don't rush off."

The leader licked his lips as he advanced.

Fighting the haze, Evelyn pulled a silver hairpin from her updo.

"Who hired you?"

Their hesitation gave her an opening.

She struck with lethal precision.

Silver flashed. One man collapsed, clutching his throat.

"Try me."

The remaining two faltered under her murderous aura.

Evelyn bolted past them into the hall.

The drug's effects intensified. She needed refuge fast.

The upstairs VIP area was her only option.

Stumbling, she shoved through a door and locked it behind her.

Footsteps pounded outside.

"Where'd she go?"

Back against the door, Evelyn slid to the floor.

Sweat dampened her forehead.

She bit her tongue hard, using the pain to stay conscious—

Only to freeze at the icy voice behind her.

"Who gave you permission to enter?"
###Chapter 10

The presidential suite was pitch black, with only slivers of moonlight slipping through the curtains.

The faint scent of sandalwood lingered in the air.

Evelyn Roland curled up beside the sofa, her cheeks burning, her breathing ragged. She fought desperately against the drug coursing through her veins, but it was a losing battle. If this continued, it might damage her meridians.

A sudden pounding erupted at the door, accompanied by crude shouts.

Soon, the security guards' angry voices cut through the noise.

"Get the hell out! You dare cause trouble on Mr. Merouin's turf?"

"My buddy's resting in there. You got a death wish?"

The booming voice belonged to Zachary Merouin, the bar owner.

Evelyn remembered Dylan Orlando mentioning him.

She fumbled for her phone to call for help, only to realize it was gone.

"Damn it."

The drug's effects intensified, scorching her rationality like wildfire.

Staggering, she headed for the bathroom, hoping cold water would ease the symptoms.

Outside the bar, three thugs were thrown out by security.

"Fuck! The prey got away," the leader spat.

In the shadows, Isabella Langley's face darkened with fury.

"Useless! You can't even handle a drugged woman?"

The thugs kept their heads down, not daring to speak.

Isabella suppressed her rage and pulled out a wad of cash.

"Take the money. But remember—"

Her eyes turned icy. "If a single word leaks out..."

"Don't worry!" The thugs hurriedly assured her. "We know how to keep our mouths shut!"

"Wait," one thug suddenly recalled. "There was a man in that room too. Probably..."

Isabella's eyes lit up. "Really?"

"Swear to God! Mr. Merouin said it himself."

A cold smirk curled her lips as she dialed a tabloid reporter's number.

Inside the suite.

Evelyn stumbled into the bathroom, her foot slipping.

Her hand instinctively grabbed something—

Warm, firm muscle met her touch.

"Who's there?"

A deep, restrained voice laced with anger.

That voice... the disabled man?

Evelyn realized he was drugged too.

Sebastian Valdemar shoved her away. "Get out!"

The drug's effects grew unbearable.

Evelyn bit her lip—she was doomed either way. Might as well...

She lunged at him.

Cold water cascaded over their feverish bodies.

From the bathroom to the bedroom, the moonlight bore witness to their madness.

At dawn, Evelyn woke first.

Her body ached as if run over by a truck.

Beside her, the man still slept, his striking profile softened by the morning light.

Footsteps and the sound of camera adjustments echoed outside the door.

"Heh..."

Evelyn smirked, dressing swiftly.

Before leaving, she left a note and a few coins on the bedside table.

"Worthless service. This is all you get."

She climbed out the window and shimmied down the drainpipe.

Three floors were nothing to her.

Let that bastard face the media alone!

The door burst open.

Camera flashes flooded the room.

In the café across the street, Isabella clenched her fists in excitement.

"They're coming out!"

But when the figure in the doorway became clear, the reporters froze—

It was a man!

Sebastian's icy gaze swept over them, his eyes glinting dangerously.

"Three seconds. Disappear."

The hallway fell deathly silent.
###Chapter 11

The gray-furred mouse darted onto Qian Xiaoyu's head in a flash, baring its sharp teeth with a shrill squeak. Its tail stood straight up, ready to attack.

"Get down!"

Every hair on Qian Xiaoyu's body stood on end. She had always been terrified of small, furry creatures—especially mice and snakes.

The little mouse flicked its tail dismissively and leaped back onto the well's edge. Drinking sweet well water was far more appealing than dealing with this coward.

Qian Xiaoyu froze.

Had she just understood the mouse's squeaks?

The high-pitched chittering had translated clearly in her mind: Stupid human! This great rat has no time for you!

This was more shocking than time travel or pocket dimensions.

She cautiously approached the well. The mouse was drinking, its round belly rising and falling with each breath.

"Hey, little one," she called softly.

The gray mouse pricked up its ears and glared at her. "What? Want a fight?"

Qian Xiaoyu burst out laughing. This wasn't a hallucination—she could truly understand animals!

Fear melted into fascination. She poked the mouse's plump belly, earning an indignant glare.

"Don't touch this great rat's stomach!"

After confirming her ability, she turned her attention to the pocket dimension. With a thought, well water surged into a perfect column, and wild vegetables arranged themselves neatly along the field's edge. Only the distant fog-covered areas remained inaccessible.

"This is enough," she murmured. The fertile land and magical spring would secure her survival in this ancient world.

The mouse sprawled on the well's edge, belly full, hiccuping contentedly. Qian Xiaoyu scooped a handful of water. It tasted crisp and sweet, but held no obvious special properties.

"Time to go back." She glanced at the sky. The kids would worry if she stayed out too long.

With a thought, she and the mouse reappeared in the forest. The vegetable basket and chipped kitchen knife lay untouched where she'd left them.

"Squeak! Take me back!" The mouse frantically hopped in place.

Qian Xiaoyu grinned and lifted it by the scruff. "Come home with me, Graybie."

"Let go! Wild cats will eat this great rat!"

"Relax, I'll protect you." She winked, then paused. A serious problem occurred to her—how could she eat meat now? If she heard animals begging for mercy, how could she stomach it?

Strangely, the village chickens and dogs still sounded like ordinary animals to her. Apparently, only certain creatures could communicate.

After gathering vegetables, she carefully uprooted a few plants for her experimental garden.

On the way down the mountain, the mouse stubbornly refused to leave the basket. Qian Xiaoyu sighed. "Fine, but behave."

Two small figures came into view at the mountain's base. Warmth bloomed in her chest. In this unfamiliar world, she was no longer alone.

"Sis!"
"Jiejie!"

The children sprinted toward her. Little Hua threw herself into Qian Xiaoyu's arms while Xiao Jiang dutifully took the basket.

"Let's go home."

The setting sun stretched their three shadows long across the ground. Outside their shabby cottage, the newly built fence gleamed golden in the fading light.

"Uncle Cao and the others helped fix the walls," Xiao Jiang reported solemnly. "You said we must remember kindness."

Qian Xiaoyu ruffled his hair, proud. But her stomach growled loudly, reminding her of their empty pantry. She hurried toward the kitchen.

The thin porridge only sharpened her hunger. Her stomach protested the lack of proper nourishment.

"We need to earn money," she muttered. Without farmland, how could they survive on wild greens alone?

A sudden shriek interrupted her thoughts.

"Mouse! There's a mouse in the basket!" Little Hua jumped up and down in panic.

Xiao Jiang grabbed a broom. "I'll get it!"

The gray rodent scampered up the wall, sticking out its tongue. "Catch me if you can, brat!"

Dust flew as boy and mouse chased each other around the yard. Qian Xiaoyu massaged her temples—peace and quiet seemed impossible now.

###Chapter 12 

The elevator doors slid open soundlessly. Benjamin stepped aside to make way.

"Miss Roland, after you."

Evelyn's gaze lingered on his face for half a second before she stepped in.

As the doors closed, Benjamin loosened his tie. The boss had said she was just a greenhorn, so why did she carry herself like seasoned royalty?

He rubbed his temples. Too much overtime lately—must be seeing things.

"You should've called ahead," Alexander said, setting down his fountain pen to pour her a glass of water.

Evelyn accepted it. "Didn't have your number."

Alexander froze, then hastily pulled out his phone to exchange contacts.

"My oversight."

"No need to apologize." She took a sip. "Just stating facts."

Alexander was speechless. This sister was nothing like the spoiled Isabella.

Remembering his mother's instructions, he straightened. "You'll be in Design Team Three. Any issues, come to me or Benjamin."

"Unnecessary." She set down the glass. "I prefer to remain an ordinary employee."

"But—"

"Don't worry. I won't tattle to the family."

Alexander choked back a laugh. This girl was something else.

Noting the awkward silence, Evelyn added, "If real trouble arises, I'll find you."

"Deal." Amused, he pressed the intercom. "Benjamin, escort her to Design."

Watching her slender figure leave, admiration flickered in his eyes. Though her credentials were modest, her poise was extraordinary.

In the design department hallway, Benjamin murmured, "You'll handle Vanity Jewelry's sapphire collection."

"Adrienne, your new recruit," he called toward the workstations.

A woman buried in sketches didn't look up. "Far corner desk."

It was a clutter-filled dead zone.

Benjamin frowned. "But she's assigned to Vanity—"

"And?" Adrienne smirked.

"Here's fine." Evelyn strode to the corner.

As she set down her bag, colleagues suddenly swarmed her.

"Miss Roland, take my seat!"

"Try my homemade cookies!"

"How are you related to Mr. Roland?"

Evelyn's eyes glinted. So the lobby incident had spread.

"Coincidental surname." Her tone was even. "The Vanity drafts were from my part-time work for the Rolands. Mr. Roland appreciated them."

The cookies vanished instantly.

"Ugh, just a fluke."

"Wasted effort."

The crowd dispersed, someone deliberately piling files on her desk.

"Borrowing space~"

Evelyn eyed their empty workstation, lips quirking.

"Must all be trash then."

Crash—

She dumped everything neatly into the bin.

"My sketches!"

"Are you insane?"

Amid shrieks, the girl opposite stifled giggles.

Adrienne's office door slammed open:

"Keep it down!"
###Chapter 13

Adrienne Klein strode into the design department in her high heels, immediately surrounded by three senior employees.

"Manager, the new girl threw away all our things!"

"She tore up my design sketches!"

"And my favorite mug..."

They clamored with accusations, one even squeezing out a few tears.

Adrienne frowned, scanning the room before her gaze landed on Evelyn Roland in the corner.

"A newcomer bullying veterans?" She smirked coldly. "I, Adrienne Klein, despise such power-tripping behavior."

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain, but Hannah Clementson from the opposite workstation interrupted timidly.

"N-no, that's not what happened..." Hannah stood up hesitantly. "They took Evelyn's seat first..."

Three pairs of venomous eyes immediately shot toward Hannah, making her nearly collapse back into her chair.

Adrienne narrowed her eyes. "Hannah, explain clearly."

Under the manager's piercing stare, the three seniors stammered incoherently.

"Consider your bonuses docked this month!" Adrienne snapped. "Next time, you're fired!"

They slunk back to their seats, shooting Hannah a murderous glare on the way.

"Evelyn Roland." Adrienne turned to the newcomer. "You're staying late tonight to clean the office."

She intended to put this privileged girl in her place.

To Adrienne's surprise, Evelyn simply nodded in calm acceptance.

Once the manager left, Jessica Rubinstein stormed over to Hannah.

"Traitor!" She raised her hand to strike.

A colleague quickly pulled her back. "Don't be rash. We'll deal with her later."

Hannah shrank into herself like a frightened rabbit.

"They..." she whispered to Evelyn. "Jessica has connections..."

Evelyn studied the kind-hearted girl and gave a slight nod. "Thank you."

After hours, Evelyn cleaned the office alone.

Adrienne, passing by, paused at the sight, a flicker of surprise crossing her face.

This socialite was actually doing the work properly?

Meanwhile, in the Valdemar Group CEO's office...

Sebastian Valdemar replayed the surveillance footage with a dark expression.

"Still no leads?" Zachary Merouin lounged on the sofa. "Maybe she's hideous?"

"Shut up," Sebastian said coldly.

His assistant Theodore Ashcroft entered. "We found the culprit. It was Isabella Langley, the Roland family's adopted daughter."

Zachary nearly fell off the couch. "Your fiancée tried to kill you?"

A dangerous glint flashed in Sebastian's eyes.

An engagement? He'd never cared about it.

But that mysterious woman... he couldn't seem to forget her.

"Prepare the car," he stood. "We're going to the Rolands'."
###Chapter 14

Qi Ruhai remained silent for a long while, the creases between his brows deepening.

"If I refuse to cooperate, does the Commander intend to render me completely powerless?" His voice was low when he finally spoke.

Ye Wudao's lips curved slightly. "General Qi's presence in the rear guard has indeed been... inconvenient. Why not attempt a collaboration first?"

"Collaboration?" Qi Ruhai narrowed his eyes.

"The encirclement operation." Ye Wudao pointed to the sand table. "The left flank remains the primary battlefield."

His finger traced the mountain range on the sand table. "General Qi will feign a falling-out with me. Take your most trusted men and flank from the right, circling through the Kingdom of Xihuang to strike the demonic cultivators from behind."

"What about the right flank's defenses during the two-day march?" Qi Ruhai frowned.

"The central army will assume control." Ye Wudao's tone left no room for doubt. "Focus solely on the pincer maneuver."

After a moment of contemplation, Qi Ruhai said, "I require written orders from the Commander."

Ye Wudao nodded. "Naturally."

His gaze sharpened abruptly. "This time, the elite forces of both the vanguard and central army will be deployed. We will annihilate every last demonic cultivator on the left flank—even if it means crossing into Xihuang territory!"

Ye Wudao knew all too well that the imperial court cared little for a minor kingdom like Xihuang. The hesitation to pursue beyond borders stemmed solely from the two princesses obstructing each other.

"I'll arrange for two severely injured Demon Kings to fall into your hands," Ye Wudao lowered his voice. "The rest of the merits... will depend on General Qi's own efforts."

A flicker of doubt crossed Qi Ruhai's eyes before he finally nodded. "Agreed."

"One more thing." Ye Wudao leaned in suddenly. "Spread word that our forces will launch a full-scale assault on the right flank."

Qi Ruhai's heart clenched. He understood—Ye Wudao had long been aware of his ties to the demonic cultivators. With a bitter smile, he said, "I truly have no knowledge of their defensive arrangements. Before the left flank engages, the Commander must specify the ambush locations."

"Your cooperation is appreciated." Ye Wudao clasped his fists solemnly.

Qi Ruhai studied him intently. "If the Commander keeps his word, this general is willing to serve the Sixth Princess."

Once Qi Ruhai departed, Ye Wudao immediately issued orders to the vanguard and central army. This time, he sought not minor skirmishes, but the complete eradication of the demonic cultivators on the left flank.

Outside the tent, dusk deepened. Ye Wudao gazed at the distant mountain silhouettes, his eyes glinting with cold light.
###Chapter 15

"I was wrong, Sebastian..."

Isabella Langley's eyes were red-rimmed, her voice trembling as her delicate fingers clutched at Sebastian Valdemar's sleeve.

Sebastian's sharp brows furrowed slightly before he coldly shook off her hand.

"Filthy."

He pulled out a handkerchief and meticulously wiped the spot she had touched.

Edward Roland's face darkened with suppressed fury. After all, it was his daughter who had committed those disgraceful acts first.

"Isabella!" Sophia Roland yanked her daughter back, hissing under her breath, "Haven't you humiliated us enough?"

Alexander Roland stepped forward, his voice low. "Since Mr. Valdemar insists on canceling the engagement, the Roland family has no objections."

Sebastian's long fingers tapped lightly against the armrest of the sofa, a dark glint flashing in his eyes.

"You misunderstand, Mr. Roland."

He lifted his gaze, sharp as a blade.

"I'm calling off the engagement with Isabella Langley."

The room fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

"I heard the Roland family has found their biological daughter?" Sebastian's lips curved slightly. "According to the agreement between our families, she is my fiancée."

Sophia's face twisted. "Absolutely not! That girl grew up in the countryside—she's unworthy of the Valdemar family!"

Her voice cracked with desperation.

From the shadows of the staircase, Evelyn Roland held her breath, her nails digging into her palms.

This lunatic!

She had no intention of marrying a dying man and becoming a widow.

"Where is she?" Sebastian scanned the room, his gaze lingering on the stairwell.

"She's not home!" Sophia blurted.

Sebastian studied her for a moment before standing and straightening his suit.

"I expect to see her in three days."

With that, he strode out, his posture as unyielding as a pine tree.

Isabella collapsed to the floor, tears blurring her vision.

She couldn't accept this!

She had been so close to becoming Mrs. Valdemar—only for that country bumpkin to steal everything from her!

"Isabella, don't cry." Edward helped his daughter up, his voice tender. "He's not worth it."

Isabella bit her lip and nodded, but resentment churned in her eyes.

She would never let that bitch get her way.

Upstairs, Evelyn silently retreated to her room.

She studied her reflection in the mirror, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

He wanted to marry her?

Fine. Let's see who outplays whom.
###Chapter 16

Evelyn Roland stood at the corner of the staircase, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Sebastian Valdemar's icy gaze swept across the room, never once lingering on her. It seemed he truly didn't recognize her as the woman from last night.

"Mom, do we really have to marry Evelyn off to that devil?" Sophia Roland's voice trembled with tears.

Edward Roland rubbed his temples. "We're in the wrong here. The Valdemars aren't to be trifled with."

"Isabella, remember this lesson." Edward turned to his younger daughter, his tone stern. "Sebastian Valdemar is not someone you provoke."

Isabella Langley bit her lip and nodded, tears welling in her eyes.

Back in her room, Evelyn collapsed onto the bed. Sebastian's frosty expression flashed repeatedly in her mind.

Marrying a man like that would be pure torture.

Inside the black Maybach, Sebastian immediately noticed his assistant's unease.

"Mr. Valdemar..." The assistant's hands shook on the steering wheel.

"Speak." Sebastian's voice was like ice.

"Miss Olivia was in a car accident! She's at the hospital now!"

The car door slammed shut with such force the entire vehicle shuddered.

"When did this happen?" Sebastian's voice sharpened.

"Half an hour ago! Miss Olivia forbade us from telling you—"

The car shot forward like an arrow. Sebastian's clenched fists bulged with veins.

At fifteen, he'd lost both parents. The shadow of that tragedy still haunted him. Olivia Valdemar was the only warmth left in his world.

In the VIP ward, Olivia sat propped against the headboard, reading a book.

"Sis." Sebastian reached her bedside in three strides.

"Just a minor injury." She smiled faintly. "Though it did scare the baby."

Sebastian's eyes turned glacial. "The driver?"

"Already dealt with." Olivia took his hand. "But we should thank the girl who saved me."

Sebastian frowned. "Who?"

"A young woman trained in traditional medicine. If she hadn't acted quickly, the baby might have..." Olivia's hand drifted protectively over her stomach.

"I'll have her found." Sebastian's voice was steel. "I'll take care of Theodore these days."

At the mention of her eldest son, Olivia's expression dimmed. The boy's autism was her eternal heartache.

"Oh," she suddenly remembered, "I think the girl's surname was Roland..."
###Chapter 17

Olivia's eyes sparkled with anticipation as her fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her blouse.

Sebastian gave a slight nod, signaling his assistant to pull up the highway surveillance footage immediately.

"That girl was quite beautiful," Olivia mused, narrowing her eyes in recollection. "Around your age, actually. You two would make a striking pair."

A mischievous grin suddenly played on her lips.

"Why not offer yourself as repayment for your sister's debt?"

Sebastian's expression remained impassive, not even a flicker of emotion crossing his features.

"Boring," Olivia huffed, rolling her eyes. "You've been this cold since you were a child."

Her smile faded as she turned serious. "You don't have to cling to that engagement. The Valdemar family is at its peak now—we don't need alliances to secure our position."

Sebastian responded with a noncommittal hum.

His life was already destined to be short. Love was nothing but an unnecessary burden. Maintaining the engagement with the Rolands was merely an extra layer of security for the family.

Olivia studied her brother's stoic profile, a pang of sorrow tightening her chest.

She had defied their family to marry a man with nothing, and now she lived in happiness. How she wished Sebastian could find his own joy.

The next morning, at KL Design Group.

Evelyn had barely stepped into the office when Jessica's shrill voice cut through the air.

"Hannah, is buying coffee beneath you?"

"Don't forget you arrived only days before Evelyn. Serving your seniors is basic courtesy!"

Hannah clutched a stack of files to her chest, flustered. "But the supervisor asked me to sort these drafts first..."

"You were quick enough to defend Evelyn yesterday!" Jessica sneered.

Evelyn's gaze darkened.

What a way to start the day.

Hannah bit her lip, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

"Problem?" Evelyn drawled, her tone deliberately languid. "Think the surveillance cameras missed your little bullying act?"

"Should I post the footage online and let the public judge?"

Jessica's face flushed crimson. "You—!"

A colleague quickly pulled her back, whispering that the supervisor was about to arrive.

"Thank you," Hannah murmured. "You helped me again."

Evelyn, unusually talkative, added, "The more you retreat, the more they'll push."

Hannah nodded firmly.

With Evelyn here, she suddenly found the courage to resist. At worst, she could quit—better than enduring this humiliation.

"Evelyn, the supervisor wants to see you."

Setting down her bag, Evelyn headed toward Adrienne's office.

"You did well with the cleanup last night," Adrienne said without looking up. "There's a new assignment for you today."

She slid a manila envelope across the desk toward Evelyn.
###Chapter 18

"This design draft must be delivered to Valdemar Group in person—straight into Sebastian Valdemar's hands." Adrienne Klein slammed the kraft paper envelope onto the desk. "Find a way to make him approve it, or kiss your paycheck goodbye."

Evelyn Roland's fingers twitched.

Sebastian again.

That man was like a persistent ghost.

"Problem?" Adrienne narrowed her eyes.

"None." Evelyn picked up the file briskly.

Adrienne watched her retreating back, lips curling into a smirk. Everyone in the design department knew Sebastian was notoriously difficult. For three months, the third design team's proposals had been rejected repeatedly.

"Newbies always think they can handle anything," she muttered under her breath.

Whispers rippled through the office.

"She actually took on Mr. Valdemar's project?"
"Let's see how long before she comes back crying."
"I give her ten minutes."

Only Hannah Clementson chased after her, worried. "Evelyn, I heard Mr. Valdemar is terrifying..."

"Relax." Evelyn patted her shoulder and stepped into the elevator without looking back.

——

Top floor of Valdemar Group.

Evelyn stood before the CEO's office, taking a deep breath. If not for hiding her true identity, she'd never want to lay eyes on that scumbag again.

"Enter." A deep voice resonated from inside.

Sebastian was bent over his desk, his gaze razor-sharp behind gold-rimmed glasses. When he recognized the visitor, his pen skidded across the document, leaving an ugly ink stain.

"You?"

His eyes dropped to the ID badge on her chest, brows knitting. "A designer from KL?"

Evelyn placed the file on his desk. "For your review, Mr. Valdemar."

Instead of opening it, he studied her, slowly enunciating her name. "Evelyn... Roland?"

"Is there a problem?" She met his gaze head-on.

"Nothing." He smirked. "Just reminded me of someone I used to know."

"What a coincidence." Her expression didn't flicker. "My colleagues often say I share a surname with the big boss."

Sebastian finally flipped open the file—only to snap it shut after a glance. "Unacceptable."

Expected.

Evelyn reached for the file. "I'll revise it."

"Wait." His hand pressed down on the corner. "I'm more curious why someone with medical expertise would switch to design."

"That's personal." Her voice turned icy. "Since you're unsatisfied, no point wasting time."

"In a hurry?" His lips curved. "I wasn't finished. This draft is inadequate, but I'll give you a chance—come back tonight at seven to discuss revisions."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "And if I refuse?"

"Then KL's collaboration with Valdemar ends here." He removed his glasses leisurely. "I doubt your supervisor would appreciate that news."
###Chapter 19

Evelyn Roland met Sebastian Valdemar's piercing gaze head-on, her crimson lips curling into a smirk as a flicker of mockery flashed in her eyes.

"Any more instructions, Mr. Valdemar?"

Her fingertips tapped lightly against the desk. "Or should I book you an appointment with a psychiatrist?"

After witnessing his performance at the Roland family gathering, this man had plummeted to the bottom of her esteem. Using marriage as a bargaining chip? Dream on.

Sebastian didn't take offense. Instead, he chuckled, amusement glinting in his gaze.

"Miss Roland seems to have quite the opinion of me."

"Aside from our initial misunderstanding, have I wronged you in any way?"

Because your skills are pathetic.

She rolled her eyes internally but maintained a neutral expression. "You're overthinking it, Mr. Valdemar. I'm just an ordinary employee."

Sebastian's eyes narrowed abruptly.

Those eyes were too familiar.

Even more so than when they'd first met.

His mind flashed to the woman who'd tossed three coins at him before fleeing like a thief.

That childish, utterly insulting act fit this woman's style perfectly.

"Had your fill of staring?"

Evelyn made a show of preparing to leave.

Sebastian slid a signed form across the table, filled with records of rejected design drafts.

She scrawled her signature carelessly, yet the strokes were unexpectedly neat.

Sebastian's pupils constricted.

That handwriting...

The "evidence" still lay in his desk drawer.

"Le Bar du Ritz."

Evelyn's steps faltered.

Sebastian closed the distance between them, holding the signed form between his fingers. "Care to explain?"

"The woman on the third floor that night was you."

It wasn't a question.

Evelyn's heartbeat skipped, but her expression remained unreadable.

"I went to the bar, but I left soon after."

"Left?" Sebastian sneered.

He seized her wrist abruptly. "How long did you think you could run?"

Evelyn gritted her teeth.

This bastard has a grip like steel.

"Let go."

She couldn't risk revealing her skills and struggled in vain to break free.

Sebastian's gaze dropped. "There's a simple way to confirm."

His eyes locked onto her waist.

A secret lay hidden there.

###Chapter 20 

The courtroom air turned to ice.

Old Man Ding's words detonated like a bomb, sending shockwaves through the gallery. Prosecutor Fang's face drained of color, his lips trembling soundlessly.

"Order!" Judge Guyuan slammed his gavel, his gaze sharp as a hawk's. "Old Man Ding, are you certain of your testimony?"

"Every word is true!" The old man dropped to his knees, his forehead striking the cold tiles. "Prosecutor Fang paid my family five hundred thousand to frame Commander Han... He threatened to kill us all if we spoke out!"

Gasps erupted from the spectators.

Fang shot to his feet, his chair screeching across the floor. "Lies! This senile fool is delusional!" Veins bulged on his forehead as he turned to the judge. "Your Honor, this is a blatant setup!"

The courtroom doors burst open. A bailiff hurried to Judge Guyuan's side, whispering urgently and handing him a stack of photographs.

The judge's frown deepened as he examined the images. Slowly, he lifted one for all to see—Fang standing atop the Grand Meridian Hotel, dozens of Six of Spades playing cards scattered at his feet.

"Impossible!" Fang staggered back. "These are doctored! I've never been there!"

"Seven journalists have also come forward," Judge Guyuan continued. "Each witnessed you using the Six of Spades' abilities on separate occasions."

The murmurs swelled. Fang clawed at his collar—and a single card fluttered free.

Six of Spades.

Time froze.

"Arrest him!" Judge Guyuan barked. Bailiffs lunged forward.

"This is a trap!" Fang shrieked, thrashing wildly. "Han Meng is the real Six of Spades! You're all being played!"

Xu Chongguo rose with a cold smile. "Sound familiar, Prosecutor Fang? Weren't those your exact words yesterday?"

The gavel fell.

"In light of new evidence, court is adjourned for thirty minutes." Judge Guyuan's voice was grave. "Detain Fang Lichang pending trial."

Fang's screams echoed down the hallway until the heavy doors sealed shut behind him.

The defense attorney straightened his papers, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "Your Honor, perhaps we might revisit the matter of Commander Han's bail?"

In the back row, a figure in a baseball cap slipped away unnoticed. Beneath the brim, a smile flickered and vanished.
###Chapter 21

Olivia Valdemar recognized Evelyn Roland at first glance, her voice trembling with excitement. "It's you!"

She grabbed Sebastian Valdemar's arm. "She's the one! If she hadn't intervened that day, the baby might have—"

Olivia rushed forward, clasping Evelyn's hands tightly. "What a coincidence! I'm Olivia Valdemar, this guy's older sister."

Tears of gratitude shimmered in her eyes. "Everything happened so fast that day. I never got the chance to properly thank you."

"Is there anything I can do for you? Just name it."

Evelyn calmly withdrew her hands and took half a step back. "It was nothing, Ms. Valdemar. Please don't dwell on it."

She lifted the file folder in her hand. "I was just delivering documents. Now that my task is done, I should be going."

As she turned, Evelyn exhaled quietly in relief. Thank goodness Olivia had shown up—otherwise, that damned birthmark secret would have been exposed.

The atmosphere in the office grew tense.

Sebastian's icy voice cut through the air. "Stop."

He strode forward, closing the distance between them. "Why are you refusing the examination? Guilty conscience?"

Olivia immediately stepped between them. "What examination? Sebastian, have you lost your mind?"

She shot her brother a reproachful look. "This woman saved my life. Is this how you treat her?"

For a moment, she'd thought her brother had finally come to his senses. But no—still the same cold, unapproachable man.

Olivia sighed inwardly. At this rate, the Valdemar family line might end with him.

"Stay out of this, Olivia." Sebastian's gaze locked onto Evelyn over his sister's shoulder. "I just want an answer."

A flicker of irritation crossed Evelyn's eyes. Why was this man so damn persistent?

Suddenly, her expression shifted. She ducked timidly behind Olivia. "Ms. Valdemar, your brother seems to think I stole something..."

Sebastian stiffened.

Stole something? She had some nerve.

Olivia's temper flared. "Is Valdemar Group's security system just for show? You're accusing a young woman of theft?"

"She stole my—" Sebastian bit back the words.

How could he possibly say, in front of his sister, that this woman had taken his virginity?
###Chapter 22

Evelyn Roland had long seen through his intentions, which was why she dared to put on such a brazen performance.

"Cat got your tongue, Mr. Valdemar? Or are you throwing a tantrum like a three-year-old?"

"A pat-down? What is this, a cop drama?"

Sebastian Valdemar fell silent under Olivia Valdemar's scolding.

Evelyn tugged lightly at Olivia's sleeve, her voice tinged with hurt. "I'm a designer at KL. Mr. Valdemar rejected our department's draft for personal reasons..."

"Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll handle this."

The way Evelyn called her "Olivia" made the older woman's heart swell with affection. She was ready to claim this sweet, clever girl as her little sister on the spot.

"Sebastian, I order you to approve KL's design proposal."

"Sis, I don't make decisions based on emotions. Their work genuinely doesn't meet our standards."

Olivia hesitated. She knew her brother well—he wasn't the type to jeopardize the company over petty grievances.

Evelyn seized the moment. "If Mr. Valdemar truly separates personal feelings from business, then give me a chance to redesign."

A flicker of doubt crossed Sebastian's eyes.

An intern, taking on such an important project?

As if reading his mind, Evelyn smiled calmly. "Just ten minutes. If you're not satisfied, I'll leave immediately."

"Fine."

She strode to his desk, pulled out paper and a pen, and began sketching.

Her pen danced across the page. In under ten minutes, a complete summer jewelry collection materialized.

A pale blue heart-shaped pendant shimmered like a clear spring, while undulating chains evoked the refreshing touch of ocean breezes.

"Exquisite!" Olivia gasped. "Sebastian, we're going with this!"

Sebastian's pulse quickened.

The design perfectly aligned with their unreleased "Breeze" theme.

He checked his watch: eight minutes.

"Satisfied?" Evelyn asked.

"Impressive." He handed her a contract. "Sign here."

As she took the document, a glint of triumph flashed in her eyes.

Not only had she defused the crisis—she'd secured the project.

This round belonged to her.

Olivia eagerly added her on WeChat and requested a custom piece.

Watching Evelyn leave, Olivia sighed. "What a delightful girl."

Sebastian smirked.

Delightful?

More like a cunning little fox.
###Chapter 23

Sebastian Valdemar's mind flashed back to that night at Le Bar du Ritz.

The scene of two spoiled heirs dragging Evelyn Roland between them.

A cold smirk curled his lips. "She plays the innocent well."

Olivia Valdemar rolled her eyes. "Since when did you become so bitter?"

"Don't tell me you've taken an interest in her?"

"Sister, since when did you start playing matchmaker?"

A secret crush?

Sebastian scoffed. In the Valdemar family, he took what he wanted by force.

Olivia gave him a knowing smile. "Stubborn. I've never seen you so fixated on a girl before."

"That's because—" Sebastian abruptly fell silent.

He couldn't very well admit he suspected this woman had slept with him.

"Because what?" Olivia arched a brow. "Never mind. I don't want to hear your excuses. Eat your food."

Sebastian stared blankly at the insulated lunchbox.

He had been paying unusual attention to Evelyn.

KL Design Group, Third Division.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the office, she felt the weight of countless stares.

Jessica Rubinstein sneered, "Look who's back—our little backdoor hire! Ready for Adrienne's storm?"

"Try not to cry, newbie."

Evelyn ignored her and walked straight to her workstation.

Hannah Clementson leaned over worriedly. "Evelyn, should I come with you to see Adrienne?"

"It's fine." Evelyn gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.

Jessica scoffed. "Hannah, such a suck-up. Too bad you picked the wrong horse."

Hannah lowered her head and resumed working without response.

Jessica's face flushed with anger.

Ever since Evelyn arrived, even the meekest girl in the office dared to defy her.

Third Design Division, Supervisor's Office.

Adrienne Klein blinked in surprise when Evelyn entered.

"You—"

She'd been ready to tear into the so-called nepotism hire.

Before she could speak, a document slid across her desk.

The bold letters of KL Design Group's contract with Valdemar Group glared up at her.

"You secured the deal?" Adrienne's voice cracked.

Evelyn nodded calmly.

Adrienne frantically flipped through the pages. Sebastian's signature and the Valdemar corporate seal stared back at her.

She looked up, stunned. "This can't be..."

What shocked her more—the design schematics had been altered.
###Chapter 24

Evelyn Roland's fingers trembled slightly as she handed the design draft to Adrienne Klein.

The blueprint had undergone a complete transformation, bearing no resemblance to the initial version submitted to Mr. Roland. Every detail had been meticulously refined, as if the most brilliant summer sunlight had been crystallized onto paper.

Adrienne studied the design for a long moment.

"Is this your work?" Her fingertip tapped the centerpiece necklace on the drawing.

Evelyn pressed her lips together and nodded.

"Impressive." Adrienne rarely showed approval. "Securing the partnership with Valdemar Group is largely thanks to you."

The office air conditioning hummed loudly, yet a thin layer of sweat formed on Evelyn's back.

She understood the subtext—this unqualified hire with only a vocational degree actually had real talent.

"However—" Adrienne's tone shifted abruptly. "Young people must guard against arrogance. The Third Design Department doesn't tolerate slackers."

She stood and walked to Evelyn's side, giving her shoulder a firm pat. The gesture wasn't harsh, but it made Evelyn's heart tighten.

"I understand." Evelyn met Adrienne's scrutinizing gaze.

She knew Adrienne's prejudice wouldn't vanish overnight. But time would tell.

As she exited the office, dozens of eyes locked onto her.

Hannah Clementson rushed over first. "Did the director give you trouble?"

Her voice was hushed but laced with concern.

Evelyn shook her head. "It's fine."

Her peripheral vision caught the colleague whose design had been replaced, sitting in the corner. She chose silence.

"Who do you think you are?" Jessica Rubinstein's shrill voice cut through the air. "Someone like Sebastian Valdemar—do you really think you can handle him?"

Hannah's face flushed with anger. "Weren't you the one who got kicked out of his office?"

The room fell dead silent.

Jessica's face darkened. "Hannah! Are you looking for death?"

She raised her hand as if to charge forward but was restrained by other colleagues.

Evelyn grasped Hannah's wrist. "Let's go."

Her calm tone only infuriated Jessica further.

"Evelyn Roland! What gives you the right?" Jessica shrieked behind them. "You're just a useless backdoor hire!"

Evelyn walked away without looking back.

In the hallway, Hannah still fumed. "How dare she speak to you like that?"

"It doesn't matter." Evelyn paused. "What matters is we secured Valdemar."

Hannah's eyes widened. "Really?"

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

The sound of shattering glass echoed behind them. Without turning, Evelyn knew Jessica had been eavesdropping.

Now, the real show would begin.
###Chapter 25

Jessica Rubinstein's nails dug deep into her palms as she glared at Evelyn Roland's retreating figure. Beneath that flawless makeup, the corners of her mouth twisted into a grotesque sneer.

"Who does she think she is?" she muttered under her breath.

The glass office door swung open abruptly.

Adrienne Klein strode in on ten-centimeter stilettos, her black blazer radiating authority. The entire design department fell silent.

Jessica's expression froze.

"Third Design Department dinner tonight," Adrienne announced, scanning the room before letting her gaze linger on Evelyn. "To celebrate Evelyn securing the Valdemar Group collaboration."

Hannah Clementson's folder hit the floor with a sharp slap.

"That's impossible!" Jessica blurted out.

Adrienne shot her an icy look. "Do you have a problem with that?"

Jessica's lips trembled, but no words came out.

Applause erupted like a tidal wave. Colleagues clapped while stealing glances at Jessica's ashen face.

Hannah sidled up to Evelyn with saccharine sweetness. "You're amazing, Evelyn~"

"Absolutely!"

"You've made our department proud!"

Amid the fawning chorus, Jessica's nails screeched across her desk. She shoved her chair back with a jarring scrape.

"I'm not feeling well. I'm leaving."

Hannah watched Jessica's retreating figure, her eyes crinkling with glee.

"Serves her right," she whispered.

Adrienne left after finalizing dinner arrangements. Hannah immediately latched onto Evelyn. "You knew this would happen, didn't you? You were waiting to humiliate her!"

Evelyn sorted through design drafts without looking up. "You're imagining things."

"Bullshit!" Hannah gesticulated excitedly. "You should've seen Jessica's face!"

Evening lights illuminated Grand Bliss Hotel as design team members gathered in the lobby.

Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, fingertips lightly tapping the glass. Crystal chandelier light fractured across her profile.

"Well, well. If it isn't our 'hero'?"

A shrill female voice cut through the air behind her.
###Chapter 26

"Well, well, if it isn't the Lowell family's precious heiress."

Victoria Lowell's saccharine voice cut through the hushed ambiance of the hotel lobby. Clinging to Nathan Evans' arm, her pink dress swayed with each step, her meticulously styled curls gleaming under the chandeliers.

Nathan's gaze, however, remained fixed on Evelyn Roland. His dark eyes held an unreadable intensity, as if trying to pierce through her very soul.

Evelyn's crimson lips curved slightly, a flicker of mockery flashing in her eyes. She had long cast these two out of her mind, yet fate had a cruel sense of humor, bringing them face-to-face again.

Hannah Clementson immediately sensed the tension and stepped protectively in front of Evelyn. "And you are?"

"We're here for our engagement celebration," Victoria announced, tilting her chin up as her disdainful eyes swept over Evelyn's attire. "Evelyn, working here now, are we?"

Curious glances from nearby colleagues darted their way, but no one intervened.

Victoria feigned sympathy with a dramatic sigh. "If only you'd swallowed your pride back then, Father wouldn't have disowned you. Look at you now—how far you've fallen..."

Evelyn leaned back lazily against the sofa, her fingers tapping the armrest. She didn’t even bother lifting her eyelids, as if observing a tiresome circus act.

Hannah barely suppressed a whistle. This composure—no wonder Evelyn was a director.

The dismissive attitude made Victoria's face flush with anger. She despised Evelyn's unshakable calm, as if she herself were nothing but a ridiculous clown.

"Stop pretending to be above it all!" Victoria raised her voice sharply. "Today is mine and Nathan's engagement party. Care to join us and see how real society celebrates?"

She deliberately glanced around, ensuring everyone heard her next words. "After all, the Evans family only marries true heiresses... not some impostor."

Nathan frowned but stayed silent. His eyes remained locked on Evelyn, as if waiting for a reaction.

Evelyn finally lifted her gaze, her lips parting slightly. "Finished?"
###Chapter 27

Evelyn Roland finally lifted her gaze, her eyes icy, the corner of her lips curling slightly.

"So?"

Victoria Lowell stepped closer in her stilettos, the hem of her dress swaying gracefully.

"Everything that was yours... now belongs to me."

She tapped Nathan Evans' chest with a manicured finger, her smile triumphant.

Hannah Clementson clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

So this was the "real heiress" who stole Evelyn's boyfriend.

Evelyn rose slowly, the fabric of her dress sweeping in an elegant arc.

"You've taken to garbage collection quite naturally."

Her tone was light, as if discussing the weather.

Nathan's face darkened, pain flashing in his eyes.

Victoria abruptly shook off his hand, her manicure glinting coldly under the lights.

"What did you just say?"

Nathan quickly grabbed her arm. "Victoria, don't make a scene."

Yet his gaze remained fixed on Evelyn, his throat bobbing.

Evelyn suddenly laughed, her eyes frosty.

"If you two want to perform a melodrama, I suggest doing it outside the courthouse."

She turned to leave but was stopped by a sickly sweet voice.

Jessica Rubinstein sauntered over, her red lips like fire.

"I heard Miss Roland secured the Valdemar deal?"

She feigned shock, covering her mouth. "Surely not through... special means?"

Victoria's pupils constricted. "What Valdemar deal?"

Jessica leaned in, whispering just loud enough for everyone to hear.

"Someone saw her leaving Mr. Valdemar's office looking disheveled."

The ballroom fell silent.

Evelyn's fingers traced the rim of her champagne flute before she suddenly raised her hand.

Splash.

The entire glass of red wine drenched Jessica's face.

"Feeling clearer now?"

She dropped the glass. The shattering sound made Jessica shriek.

"You—!"

"Next time you spread rumors," Evelyn pulled out a silk handkerchief, wiping her hands with a gaze sharp as a blade,

"Make sure you've bought insurance first."
###Chapter 28

Jessica Rubinstein's words cut through Evelyn Roland like a sharp blade. The atmosphere shifted instantly as every gaze in the room turned judgmental and probing.

Even without makeup, Evelyn's face glowed with a pearlescent radiance under the lights. Such beauty inevitably invited speculation.

Nathan Evans' expression darkened immediately.

"Oh!" Jessica suddenly covered her mouth, feigning regret. "Evelyn, I just think trading favors for business deals is... unseemly. A woman should value herself more. Someone like Mr. Valdemar is out of your league."

Evelyn's fingers curled slowly into fists.

These relentless vultures.

"I don't recall ever doing such a thing."

A frigid voice spoke from behind Jessica, making her shiver violently.

When she turned, her eyes locked onto a face so flawlessly handsome it left her momentarily speechless.

"Answer me."

Sebastian Valdemar's voice snapped Jessica back to reality. His deep-set eyes churned with dangerous undercurrents.

"I—I only heard rumors..."

"So you're spreading lies?"

His tone grew colder. Jessica finally grasped the gravity of the situation and waved her hands frantically. "We were just chatting! I didn't mean to spread rumors!"

Sebastian's gaze darkened further.

"Lawyer."

The single word drained the color from Jessica's face. She reached for him, but he sidestepped her effortlessly.

"Mr. Valdemar, I was wrong! I'll never do it again! Please forgive me!"

Hannah Clementson watched from the crowd, her lips curling in satisfaction.

Sebastian had been dragged to dinner by Zachary Merouin. Spotting a commotion in the lobby, he'd approached—only to overhear his own "scandalous affair" being discussed. And of all people, Evelyn stood at the center.

Amusing.

He had no patience for theatrics. With a quick call, he summoned Adrienne Klein, head of KL Design's third department.

Adrienne, working late, rushed over immediately.

Evelyn had seen enough. She turned and headed for the restroom.

As Sebastian moved to leave, Nathan blocked his path.

"Mr. Valdemar! What an honor. Would you join us for dinner?"

Sebastian's patience had evaporated. He didn't even glance at Nathan. "Move."

Undeterred, Nathan extended a business card. "Here's my contact. Perhaps another time—"

Sebastian stepped around him without a word.

Nathan's outstretched hand hung awkwardly in the air, his face twisting like a spilled paint palette.
###Chapter 29

The hallway gradually emptied as Sebastian Valdemar caught up to Evelyn Roland in a few long strides. He stepped sideways, blocking her path, his tall frame casting a shadow over her.

"In a hurry?"

Evelyn stopped abruptly and met his gaze with icy detachment. "Do you need something, Mr. Valdemar? I don't discuss business outside work hours."

"Just curious." A smirk played at the corner of his lips, but his eyes remained sharp as blades. "With your discerning taste, how did you ever settle for someone like Nathan Evans?"

"My personal life is none of your concern."

Irritation flared within her. This man was always so domineering and relentless. She refused to indulge him further. "It's ancient history. Not worth mentioning."

Sebastian's interest only deepened. "Your expression says otherwise."

Leaning closer, he lowered his voice. "If you're truly over him, prove it. Attend the engagement next door. A proper ex should be like the dead—silent and gone. Treat it as some stranger's wedding."

"How childish." She rubbed the faint red mark on her wrist, meeting his mocking gaze.

His eyes seemed to taunt her: See? You're still hung up on him.

Evelyn felt as though she'd swallowed something vile. "You're revolting."

"Well?" He arched a brow.

"Fine!" She shoved past him, storming toward the adjacent banquet hall.

Sebastian followed at a leisurely pace, his gaze fixed on her rigid posture.

Evelyn's chest tightened as she pushed open the doors. Guests turned in surprise, though decorum kept them from approaching—until Sebastian appeared.

The atmosphere instantly buzzed with energy.

"Mr. Valdemar! What a surprise to see you here!"

"Mr. Valdemar, remember me? From last night's dinner—"

Sebastian barely spared the man—some forgettable businessman from yesterday's gathering—a glance before nodding dismissively.

Yet the man persisted, desperate to ingratiate himself. Others soon swarmed around them, transforming the intimate engagement party into a networking event.

Nathan Evans and Victoria Lowell's smiles froze the moment they spotted Evelyn. Victoria clutched her silk dress so tightly her nails nearly tore through the fabric.

Standing beside Sebastian, Evelyn drew just as much attention. Murmurs spread among the guests:

"Is that Mr. Valdemar's companion? They make a striking pair."

"That's KL Design Group's lead designer, isn't she? So young and accomplished..."

Victoria forced a saccharine smile as she dragged Nathan through the crowd. "How thoughtful of you to attend our engagement, Evelyn." Her voice dripped honey, but her eyes gleamed with venom.

###Chapter 30

The engagement party was in full swing, with champagne flowing freely. Victoria Lowell clung to Nathan Evans' arm, her face adorned with a saccharine smile. Her gaze swept across the corner where Evelyn Roland sat, lips curling into a triumphant smirk.

"Look over there," she whispered to Nathan, barely concealing her glee. "I can't believe she actually showed up."

Nathan followed her line of sight, his expression flickering briefly before he schooled it into polite surprise. "It's wonderful that Evelyn came to celebrate with us."

Victoria let out a derisive hum and deliberately raised her voice. "Why is my dear sister sitting all alone in the corner? Did she forget to bring a gift?"

The surrounding guests immediately turned their attention toward Evelyn. Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Is that the eldest Lowell daughter? I heard she doesn’t get along with her family."

"How shameless—showing up empty-handed to her own sister’s engagement party."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her wineglass, knuckles turning white. The urge to hurl the drink into Victoria’s smug face burned through her.

Just then, a tall figure stepped between them. Sebastian Valdemar stood with one hand casually tucked in his pocket, looking down at Victoria with icy disdain. "Miss Lowell, do you always take such an interest in my date?"

Victoria stiffened before forcing a brittle smile. "I was just concerned about my sister, Mr. Valdemar."

Sebastian reached into his suit jacket and pulled out a check, handing it to a nearby waiter without ceremony. "Consider this Evelyn’s gift to the happy couple."

The waiter’s eyes bulged. "O-one million?!"

Gasps erupted across the room. Vincent and Margaret Lowell immediately pushed forward, their faces alight with greedy delight.

"Oh my, this is too generous—" Margaret reached for Evelyn’s arm. "Darling, you shouldn’t have—"

Evelyn recoiled and instead linked her arm with Sebastian’s. She stared at her adoptive parents’ fawning expressions, nausea churning in her gut.

"Let’s sit over there," she muttered to Sebastian.

Once they were seated in the corner, Sebastian leaned close, his breath brushing her ear. "Not enjoying yourself?"

"Very generous of you," Evelyn hissed. "Using my name to throw money at my enemies. Clever move."

Sebastian arched a brow. "Ah, so that’s what’s bothering you." He tapped his phone screen a few times. "Just had accounting deduct it from your name."

Evelyn whipped her head toward him. "You—!"

"Joking." He pocketed his phone, a glint of amusement in his eyes. "But your temper is far more entertaining than that lifeless mask you were wearing earlier."

Across the ballroom, Victoria glared at the pair, her nails digging into her palms. Nathan followed her gaze, his expression unreadable.

"Stop staring," he murmured. "The press is watching."

Victoria forced a smile, though her mind seethed. She’d wanted to humiliate Evelyn publicly—instead, she’d handed her the spotlight.

Evelyn abruptly stood. "I need the restroom."

She needed air. The suffocating hypocrisy of this party, her revolting family, and the infuriating man beside her were too much.

As she turned the hallway corner, a hand suddenly grabbed her wrist. Evelyn turned to find Nathan staring at her, his eyes dark with emotion.

"Evelyn," he rasped. "We need to talk."
###Chapter 31

The ten-million-dollar check gleamed coldly under the lights.

Evelyn Roland's lips curled into a mocking smile as she pushed the check back toward Sebastian Valdemar with a flick of her fingers.

"Quite generous of you, Mr. Valdemar."

Her gaze swept over Nathan Evans and Victoria Lowell, who were forcing smiles on the stage. Disgust simmered in her eyes.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow, swirling his wine glass with long fingers. "Not enough?"

"Money is a wonderful thing," Evelyn said coldly. "But when spent on trash, even it becomes tainted."

The banquet hall buzzed with clinking glasses and laughter.

Victoria swayed through the crowd in stiletto heels, champagne flute in hand.

"Sister!"

The sickly sweet voice made Evelyn stiffen.

Before she could turn, icy liquid trickled down her neck and into her collar.

"Oh no!" Victoria gasped, feigning shock. "My hand slipped."

The sheer blouse turned transparent, clinging to Evelyn's skin.

All eyes turned toward them.

Victoria's eyes gleamed with triumph, though her face remained the picture of innocence. "You're not angry with me, are you?"

Evelyn paused.

Slowly, she untied the silk scarf from her hair, letting her dark locks cascade down to cover her damp back.

"Careless today, aren't we?" she murmured with a smile. "Perhaps the engagement has left you too excited to walk straight?"

Victoria's face froze.

A few knowing chuckles rose from the guests.

Nathan appeared just in time. "Victoria, didn't you prepare a spare dress for Evelyn?"

His gaze lingered on Evelyn's figure, his Adam's apple bobbing.

In the dressing room, Evelyn had just undone her buttons when the lock clicked.

"Leave the towel outside," she said.

But the footsteps grew closer.

She whirled around to meet a pair of hungry eyes.

"Evelyn..." Nathan locked the door behind him. "I've missed you."

His breath came fast, his collar damp with sweat.

"Get out," Evelyn hissed, clutching her collar.

Nathan ignored her, advancing step by step. "I know you still love me—"

Before he could finish, she drove her knee upward with brutal force.

"Ah!"

Nathan crumpled to the floor with a howl.

Evelyn seized his hair and slammed his head against the wall.

"That," she said through gritted teeth, "was for the girl I used to be."

Blood trickled down the wall.
###Chapter 32

"Everyone evacuate now!"

Evelyn Roland charged down from the third floor to find the corridor littered with wounded. She stood at the stairwell, her voice cutting through the chaos: "They're right behind us! Anyone who can move, follow me out the back!"

"Evelyn, we can't..."

Little Dog dragged his injured leg, his face smeared with soot from the explosion. Tears glistened in his eyes as he looked up. "The guys who just got sterilized can barely stand. Several are still in surgery getting bullets removed..."

"No time!"

Evelyn yanked the silk scarf from her neck and tied it around Little Dog's bleeding arm. Her nails dug into her palms. "We move now or die. Carry the critically wounded if you have to!"

Voices rose in ragged agreement down the hallway. Members of the Blenheim faction struggled to their feet—some hauling unconscious comrades on stretchers, others limping downstairs arm-in-arm. White-coated doctors wheeled IV stands while nurses followed clutching emergency kits.

The private hospital's neon lights glared harshly against the night.

"Triple the fee—get your director here!"

Evelyn slammed a stack of bills onto the reception desk. The nurse's hands shook as she grabbed the phone. Within minutes, every light in the building blazed to life, the sound of gurney wheels filling the corridors.

"Evelyn! Massachusetts General is on fire!"

Little Dog's shriek made her whirl around. The distant inferno painted her ashen face crimson. A sudden realization struck her like lightning, and she sprinted toward the flames without hesitation.

"Vincent's still inside!"

The night wind stung her cheeks. As Evelyn rounded the second intersection, seven shadowy figures emerged from an alley. The lead man wore a black balaclava, his voice grating like sandpaper. "Running straight to us, sweetheart?"

"Move!"

Her boot knife slid into her palm. The blade flashed—splitting the man's vest open, spilling entrails and blood. She seized his twin pistols and dropped two pursuers with headshots.

At the third gunshot, white-hot agony pierced Evelyn's ribs. The bullet exploded from her back in a fist-sized exit wound. Staggering, she felt the weapons grow leaden in her grip.

"Die, bitch!"

The masked man raised her own dagger, its tip inches from her throat. Evelyn shut her eyes—only to hear a sickening crack. Warm blood splattered her face. When she looked, a headless corpse toppled before her.

"Shouldn't you repay your savior with a kiss?"

A young doctor knelt beside her, surgical scissors already slicing through bloodied fabric. Evelyn turned away, tears mingling with blood at her temples. Her mind reeled with images of Vincent consumed by flames—until the sudden rip of her shirt snapped her back.

"Marry me now?"

"You—disgusting!"

Evelyn flushed scarlet, then convulsed from searing back pain. Dominic Laurent approached carrying an unconscious Vincent, his beard quivering with laughter. "Finally showing some sense, boy!"

In the hospital corridor, Little Dog burst into tears seeing the two wheeled into surgery together. The young doctor forced a pill between Evelyn's lips before scowling at the old man. "Grandfather, her tripled fee—"

"Save them first."

Dominic gripped his grandson's shoulder, scanning the deserted hallway. Not a single Blenheim guard remained—only this blood-soaked boy weeping alone. With a sigh, the elder retrieved a golden syringe from his medical kit's hidden compartment.
###Chapter 33

Evelyn Roland leaned against the ornate pillar, her fingertips tracing the rim of her wine glass. A faint smile played at the corners of her lips. To her, this farce was nothing more than a poorly staged performance.

"Nathan would never do such a thing!" Victoria Lowell stormed into the center of the crowd, her delicate makeup twisting with fury as she clutched her skirt.

I stepped forward gracefully, the silk of my gown shimmering like pearls under the chandeliers. "Oh, dear sister," I sighed, shaking my head. "Your judgment in men remains as flawed as ever."

Victoria opened her mouth to retort, but I raised a hand to silence the murmuring crowd. "Since we're at an impasse," I said, sweeping my gaze across the room, "why not consult the surveillance footage? After all..." I paused meaningfully. "Machines never lie."

The ballroom erupted in murmurs of agreement. The elite exchanged knowing glances, none willing to miss this unfolding drama.

"Pull up the footage!"
"We demand the truth!"

Victoria bit her lip and summoned the manager. The middle-aged man in a crisp suit hesitated. "My apologies, but the hotel's electrical systems are undergoing maintenance today..."

I scoffed. Even a child wouldn’t fall for such a flimsy excuse.

"No footage means you can twist the truth?" Victoria lifted her chin defiantly. "It was you who seduced Nathan!"

Sebastian Valdemar stood by the champagne tower, his long fingers idly stroking the stem of his glass. He watched as the woman in the deep red gown smiled with the poise of a languid Persian cat.

"Does anyone have a laptop?" My cool voice cut through the noise.

Sebastian arched a brow. His assistant immediately handed over a sleek silver notebook, its metallic surface gleaming under the lights.

As I took the laptop, my fingers brushed against his wristwatch. The cold metal sent a fleeting shiver through me—a stark contrast to the heat of his grip on my waist the night before, when that same watch had pressed into my skin.

The keyboard clacked crisply under my fingers. Victoria fidgeted, her crystal nails scraping against the fabric of her dress.

"Stop pretending!" she snapped.

The blue glow of the screen illuminated my face. I didn’t bother looking up. "Patience. The truth isn’t going anywhere."

Five minutes later, I breached the hotel’s security system. The large screen flickered to life, revealing Nathan Evans sneaking into the dressing room with a lecherous grin.

Silence engulfed the ballroom. I closed the laptop and turned, my skirt brushing against Sebastian’s trousers. He gazed down at me, his dark eyes swirling with something unreadable.

"Now," I smoothed nonexistent wrinkles from my sleeve. "Who owes whom an apology?"
###Chapter 34

"Finally, this day has come." Nathan Evans' eyes gleamed with greed as his fingers roughly tore open the woman's collar. "I'm going to savor every bit of you today."

Every detail was crystal clear on the high-definition screen. The mask of hypocrisy had been ripped away, leaving Nathan with no room for denial.

Victoria Lowell's face drained of color, then turned ashen before flushing crimson. Her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

"Vicky, this video is fake!" Nathan grabbed her arm in panic. "Someone must be framing me!"

Evelyn Roland smirked disdainfully. "Feel free to have it authenticated."

With a tap of her fingers on the keyboard, the screen split into nine squares—each showing Nathan entangled with different women in compromising positions.

The banquet hall erupted in chaos.

Gasps of shock rippled through the crowd. Vincent and Margaret Lowell looked ready to vanish on the spot, their faces twisted in humiliation.

What was meant to be a joyous engagement party had become a farce.

"Evelyn Roland!" Victoria shrieked hysterically, charging toward the stage. "I'll kill you!"

Madness burned in her eyes.

If not for this woman, she would have been the happiest bride. Now everything was ruined.

"Take your tantrum elsewhere." Evelyn tossed the words over her shoulder and walked away, leaving the Lowell family in disarray.

Sebastian Valdemar narrowed his eyes, watching the retreating figure with intrigue.

Hacking into a five-star hotel's surveillance system in such a short time—this woman was far from ordinary.

For the first time, someone had piqued his interest so intensely.

"Evelyn Roland," he murmured, striding after her.

At the hotel entrance, Evelyn massaged her aching ankles. The eight-centimeter heels made her steps unsteady.

She didn't notice the scorching gaze fixed on her back.

"Mr. Valdemar." Adrienne Klein's voice suddenly cut through the air.

Sebastian turned with a frown.

Jessica Rubinstein approached nervously. "Mr. Valdemar, those rumors at the celebration were just hearsay. Please don't take them to heart."

She kept her head bowed, not daring to meet his icy stare.
###Chapter 35

Jessica Rubinstein stumbled on the steps as her high heels caught the edge. She knew full well that if this deal fell through because of her loose tongue, the consequences would be unbearable.

Sebastian Valdemar stood beneath the streetlamp, his tall frame casting a long shadow. His lips parted, voice icy. "If you're going to apologize, direct it to the right person."

Following his gaze, the trio spotted Evelyn Roland waiting by the curb for a taxi. The night breeze lifted strands of her hair, softening the edges under the golden light.

Jessica dug her nails into her palms. Bowing to Evelyn was more bitter than swallowing a fly. But facing the Valdemar Group's formidable leader, she had no choice.

"I... I'm sorry." Jessica approached Evelyn, her hair falling forward to hide her contorted expression as she bowed.

Evelyn arched a brow in surprise. This woman, who had always been her adversary, now stood before her like a chastened schoolgirl.

"I spoke nonsense at the banquet earlier." Jessica's voice trembled. "I shouldn't have spread rumors about you and Mr. Valdemar."

A taxi's vacant light glowed as it pulled up. Evelyn opened the door, her gaze clear as she turned back. "Rumors die with the wise. Next time, try speaking with evidence."

As the taillights vanished around the corner, Sebastian's lips curved faintly. This woman was far more intriguing than he'd anticipated.

The shadows of plane trees flowed across the car window as they drove through the Beverly Hills estate. The moment Evelyn stepped out, Sophia Roland grabbed her arm. "Child, why take a taxi when we have cars at home?"

The garage gleamed with limited-edition sports cars, any one worth a fortune. Evelyn shook her head. "Taxis are more convenient."

She refused to reveal her identity. At KL Design Group, she was just an ordinary employee. She'd seen enough sycophantic smiles to last a lifetime.

"Fine, have it your way." Sophia lowered her voice. "If anyone at work bullies you, tell me immediately."

Upstairs, the curtains twitched violently. Isabella Langley gripped the fabric so tightly her nails nearly tore through. The harmonious scene below stabbed at her heart like a knife.

This sudden "sister" had stolen everything that should have been hers.
###Chapter 36

The crystal chandelier refracted dazzling light across the cheerful scene in the Roland family's parlor.

"Evelyn's recent performance reminds me of my younger self." Edward Roland took a sip of dragon well tea, satisfaction evident in his eyes.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, fingertips tracing the rim of her teacup. "You flatter me, Father. I still have much to learn."

"Mom, Dad, I'm home!" Isabella Langley fluttered into the room like a sparrow and nestled beside Sophia. "What are you talking about?"

Sophia set down her cup, gaze shifting between her daughters. "We were discussing your sister's latest major contract. Isabella, you should learn from her." She emphasized the last words deliberately.

"I'll definitely seek guidance from Alexander and Evelyn." Isabella's smile was radiant, but a shadow flickered in her eyes.

She tilted her head suddenly. "Why don't I intern at the company too? Now that I've graduated, it's time to gain experience." Her almond-shaped eyes sparkled with anticipation as she looked at her parents.

Edward exchanged a glance with his wife before laughing heartily. "Excellent! Young people should challenge themselves. Report tomorrow."

"Thank you!" Isabella clapped her hands, though her peripheral vision remained fixed on Evelyn's reaction.

Evelyn lifted her teacup calmly, steam obscuring her expression. She knew her sister's games all too well—but this time, she wouldn't retreat.

The next morning, KL Design Group CEO's office.

Sebastian Valdemar had barely stepped inside, his suit jacket still unbuttoned, when he pressed the intercom.

"Theodore. Now."

Outside, Theodore adjusted his tie, Adam's apple bobbing nervously. The CEO's stormy expression was darker than gathering thunderclouds.

"You summoned me, Mr. Valdemar?"

Sebastian stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, his ramrod posture radiating icy intensity. "Terminate all collaborations with the Evans and Lowell families. Immediately."

Theodore's pupils constricted. "But sir, those projects account for 15% of our quarterly revenue. The penalty clauses alone—"

"I said terminate." Sebastian turned, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Need I repeat myself?"

The office temperature plummeted. A cold sweat trickled down Theodore's spine.
###Chapter 37

The phone rang abruptly just as Nathan Evans raised his glass in toast to Vincent and Margaret Lowell.

"Uncle, Aunt, I promise—"

His words were cut off by the shrill ringtone that shattered the intimate atmosphere of the private dining room.

Vincent's brow furrowed as he slammed his chopsticks onto the bowl with a sharp clatter.

Nathan fumbled for his phone, his face paling when he saw the caller ID: "Sebastian Valdemar."

"Answer it," his father hissed under his breath.

The moment Nathan connected the call, Sebastian's icy voice sliced through the receiver: "You're fired, effective immediately."

Nathan froze as if struck by lightning, nearly dropping the phone.

"Mr. Valdemar, please let me explain—"

"The penalty fee has been transferred to the company account," Sebastian interrupted. "And regarding your embezzlement, Legal will contact you shortly."

The dial tone echoed harshly in the stunned silence.

Vincent shoved his chair back with a screech, rising to his feet.

"Embezzlement?" He glared at Nathan, whose face had turned ashen. "This is your so-called reformation?"

Victoria grabbed her father's arm in panic. "Dad, there must be some mistake—"

"A mistake?" Vincent shook her off. "Is this how you raised your son, Mr. Evans?"

Beads of sweat formed on Nathan's father's forehead as he opened his mouth to speak—when another notification chimed.

A bank alert flashed on Nathan's screen: "Your account has been frozen..."

His legs gave out, sending him crashing to his knees.

As Victoria rushed to help him up, Vincent yanked her away.

"We're leaving!" he barked, storming toward the exit. "The engagement is over!"

Margaret hesitated, but a sharp look from her husband silenced her.

The door slammed shut behind them.

Nathan's father backhanded him across the face.

"You disgrace!"

Nathan clutched his cheek, eyes glazed with shock. "It's over... Everything's over..."

Meanwhile, in the Valdemar Group executive office...

Theodore Ashcroft placed a document on Sebastian's desk. "It's done, sir."

Sebastian skimmed the file, his gaze lingering on the final figure.

"Contact the press."

Theodore blinked. "Sir?"

"I want every headline tomorrow to feature Nathan Evans' embezzlement scandal."

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, twilight deepened.

Sebastian stood silhouetted against the skyline, fingertips tapping the glass.

"Evelyn Roland... I hope you appreciate this gift."

###Chapter 38

Mr. Evans' phone suddenly vibrated.

He frowned and pressed the answer button.

"Mr. Evans, we have an emergency!" His assistant's voice trembled with panic. "The Valdemar Group just sent notice terminating all our joint projects."

His fingers clenched around the phone.

"What did you say?" His voice rose sharply. "Valdemar is canceling our contracts?"

"It's confirmed." The assistant's voice shook. "The order came directly from Mr. Valdemar himself."

A vein pulsed at Mr. Evans' temple.

"Arrange a meeting with Sebastian Valdemar immediately." He commanded through gritted teeth.

After hanging up, his expression darkened like a thunderstorm. Valdemar's contracts were worth millions. The financial impact would be catastrophic.

Meanwhile, Vincent Lowell received the same news.

"Nathan, this doesn't make sense." Vincent stubbed out his cigarette violently. "Why would Valdemar suddenly turn against both our families?"

Mr. Evans gave a cold laugh. "Someone's clearly targeting us."

The atmosphere in the private room turned glacial.

"It must be Evelyn Roland!" Victoria Lowell jumped to her feet. "Who else would come after us like this?"

Vincent snapped at her. "Don't make baseless accusations!"

"Dad!" Victoria stomped her foot in frustration. "She's jealous of my relationship with Nathan!"

Mr. Evans interjected sarcastically. "Your family certainly raised an outstanding daughter."

"And what about your playboy son?" Vincent slammed the table as he stood. "Spending every night partying!"

Mrs. Evans quickly intervened. "Enough! Our priority is salvaging these contracts."

Both families exchanged uneasy glances. Against Valdemar Group's financial might, they stood no chance.

"Nathan," Mr. Evans said suddenly. "You and Victoria should go talk to Evelyn Roland."

"Why should I beg her?" Victoria shrieked.

Mr. Evans narrowed his eyes. "Unless you'd prefer both our families to go bankrupt?"

Victoria bit her lip until it bled, nails digging into her palms. Beg that bitch for mercy? Never.
###Chapter 39

Margaret gently pressed her palm over Victoria's trembling hand.

"Victoria, this isn't the time for stubbornness." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "The Lowells need you."

Victoria bit her lower lip until it bled.

The metallic tang spread across her tongue.

She understood her mother's unspoken meaning perfectly.

But how could she stand by while that impostor stole her rightful place?

KL Design Group.

Isabella strode into the design department in limited-edition stilettos.

Diamond bracelets glittered on her wrist under the office lights.

"Hello everyone~"

Her saccharine voice made several male colleagues look up.

From her Hermès bag, she produced exquisitely wrapped gift boxes.

"Handmade chocolates from Milan."

She placed them on each desk with calculated grace.

"Let's get along~"

Penelope from accounting gasped.

"Are these...Venchi's Golden Collection?"

The office erupted in murmurs.

Isabella surveyed their awed expressions with satisfaction.

She paused deliberately before Evelyn's workstation.

"Care to try one, sister?"

The box landed with a thud.

Evelyn kept typing without looking up.

"Allergic."

Jessica immediately scurried over.

"Don't mind her, Isabella. Some people have no appreciation."

She raised her voice pointedly.

"Only a true Roland heiress would give such extravagant gifts."

Isabella smiled demurely.

But something dark flickered in her eyes.

Adrienne pushed through the glass doors.

Just in time to witness the spectacle.

"Are we being paid to socialize?"

Her icy tone scattered the crowd like startled birds.

Isabella hurried after her into the manager's office.

"Ms. Klein—"

She extended a navy velvet box.

The Patek Philippe logo gleamed faintly.

Adrienne didn't even glance up.

"This isn't a charity."

Her pen slashed across documents with brutal precision.

"Either prove your worth."

"Or—"

At last, she lifted her gaze.

"Take your bribes and get out."

Isabella's face drained of color.

Her manicured nails dug into her palms.

She whirled toward the elevators.

And pressed the button for the top floor.

Through frosted glass, a tall silhouette moved in the CEO's office.

Isabella's lips curved.

"Sebastian..."
###Chapter 40

The elevator doors slid open. Benjamin Chamberlain immediately stepped forward. "Good afternoon, Ms. Langley."

Isabella Langley stormed past him in her stilettos. "Where's my brother?"

"Mr. Roland is in an international video conference—" Before Benjamin could finish, Isabella shoved open the office doors.

The conference room fell silent. Alexander Roland's knuckles turned white around his phone. The icy aura radiating from him could be felt three meters away.

"Sir, I tried to stop her—" Benjamin wiped his brow.

Alexander dismissed him with a wave and abruptly ended the call.

"Who dared upset our precious Ms. Langley?" He loosened his tie, amusement lacing his tone.

"Alexander!" Isabella hurled her designer bag onto the sofa. "They rejected me at our own company!"

"Oh?" His eyebrow arched. "Do tell."

"I wanted to join Design Team Three to work with Evelyn, but Adrienne Klein turned me down!" Her teeth clenched. "Who does she think she is?"

Alexander's gaze darkened. He knew Adrienne's reputation—Design Team Three was KL's elite squad. Isabella's current skills would only embarrass herself there.

"Report to Design Team Two." His decision was final.

Isabella's eyes widened. "Why should I—"

"Team Two or home. Choose." He cut her off.

Her fists tightened. With a furious glare, she spun on her heel and marched out.

Meanwhile, in Design Team Three's workspace...

Evelyn Roland stretched after finishing her morning tasks and headed for the break room. As she reached the doorway, she collided with a distracted Hannah Clementson.

Splash!

Scalding coffee drenched Evelyn's pristine white suit.

"I'm so sorry!" Hannah fumbled for napkins.

Evelyn took them calmly. "It's fine. I've got it."

Her hands paused mid-wipe. This was Hannah's third distracted moment today.

"Is everything alright?" Evelyn asked softly.

Hannah forced a smile. "N-nothing. Just didn't sleep well..."

Her phone buzzed. The screen lit up—Hannah's face drained of color.
###Chapter 41

Hannah spun around abruptly, the water glass trembling slightly in her grip. She tilted her head back and gulped down the entire glass of cold water, her Adam's apple bobbing frantically.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. She could tell something was off with Hannah, but she didn't press further. "Take the day off if you're unwell," she murmured before turning toward her workstation.

The bottom of the glass reflected Hannah's bloodshot eyes. A single tear fell silently, creating tiny ripples across the water's surface.

During lunch break, the office building was filled with the mingled aromas of takeout. Hannah grabbed her bag and hurried out, her cap pulled low and a mask covering most of her face.

"Miss, you—" The security guard barely started speaking when a disheveled man suddenly lunged from behind a pillar and seized Hannah's wrist.

"Playing dumb now?" The man reeked of alcohol, his fingernails caked with grime. "Ignoring my calls?"

Hannah flinched. "Let go!"

Instead of releasing her, he tightened his grip. "Think you're too good for me now? Trying to ditch your old man?" He yanked off her cap and snarled at the guard, "This is a family matter—stay out of it!"

The guard froze. Hannah bit her lip hard—the drunken, smoke-stained man was indeed her biological father.

"I don't have money," she whispered, her voice shaking. "Really, I don't."

"Bullshit!" Richard snatched her bag and rifled through it. "A fancy office worker with no cash?" Finding only files and pens, he hurled the bag to the ground and started digging through her pockets.

"Enough!" Hannah finally snapped. "Five million in gambling debts! I couldn't pay that off in ten years even if I starved!"

"Then sell yourself!" Richard's eyes gleamed with sudden excitement. "Pretty thing like you—sleep with a few rich men..."

Across the lobby, Jessica was waiting in line for coffee. Hearing the commotion, she narrowed her eyes and discreetly raised her phone.

"You monster!" Hannah swung her bag at him, each strike punctuated by ragged sobs. "Why don't you just die!"

Richard staggered back, still slurring obscenities. "After all I've done for you—" Before he could finish, security dragged him out.

Hannah fled to the restroom, locking herself in a stall. The mirror showed her smeared lipstick, like a streak of blood.

"Scandal alert!" Jessica wriggled into the break room, waving her phone. "Someone in this company is turning tricks!"

Colleagues instantly clustered around. Jessica triumphantly played the video—Hannah hysterically beating a man while he shouted about her becoming a prostitute.

The cold glow of the screen illuminated their eager faces.
###Chapter 42 

"Isn't that Hannah Clementson?"

"Always acting so high and mighty. Turns out her family's into that kind of business."

"Look at how she dresses. She's probably been..."

The company group chat exploded with notifications. Someone had shared the video on social media with a vicious caption.

Hannah emerged from the restroom, her eyes still red. Carrying her lunch, she felt the hallway gazes prick her back like needles.

The office whispers died abruptly. She looked up to see coworkers hastily averting their eyes, phones still glowing in their hands.

Her phone vibrated. A video was spreading like wildfire in the main company group.

[SHOCKING! Female Employee's Secret Transactions Exposed]

Hannah's finger froze mid-air. The footage showed her father's drunken face, the image stabbing her like a knife.

"Well, well. The leading lady arrives." Jessica Rubinstein leaned against her desk, waving her phone. "What a coincidence—I just happened to record this."

Hannah's breath hitched. "You...you—"

"Me what?" Jessica's smile dripped venom. "Everyone deserves to know the truth."

Hannah lunged. The lunchbox crashed to the floor, soup splattering everywhere.

"Delete it!" Hannah grabbed Jessica's collar, voice raw.

Jessica yanked her hair. "Playing innocent? Didn't your own father admit everything?"

They crashed into a filing cabinet. Papers rained down as coworkers filmed instead of intervening.

"Hold her down!" Jessica shrieked.

Half a dozen hands seized Hannah. Her blouse tore at the shoulder, angry red marks blooming on her arm.

Evelyn Roland burst into the office to this scene: Hannah pinned on the floor, tear-streaked, Jessica's hand raised for another strike.

"Stop!"

Evelyn was shoved from behind. She stumbled into a desk, sharp pain exploding at her temple.

"Enough."

The voice cut through the chaos like a blade. Everyone froze.

Sebastian Valdemar stood in the doorway, his gaze glacial. It swept the wrecked office before landing on Evelyn's bruised forehead.

Jessica's hand still hovered mid-air. She paled, lips trembling. "M-Mr. Valdemar..."

Hannah curled on the floor, blouse gaping open. Her phone screen still displayed the looping video.
###Chapter 43

"The caliber of KL employees is truly eye-opening." Sebastian Valdemar's icy gaze swept across the room. "Perhaps our partnership requires reevaluation."

Evelyn Roland pressed her lips together, silent.

Jessica Rubinstein shoved Hannah Clementson away, staggering back. "It was just a joke! Who knew she'd freak out?"

"Familiar with the sentencing guidelines for defamation?" Evelyn adjusted her cuffs, her voice like frozen steel.

Jessica's eyes darted nervously. She was betting Hannah wouldn’t dare escalate this.

Evelyn stepped in front of Hannah, her voice sharpening. "Rumors die with the wise. Unfortunately, everyone here chose to be an accomplice."

"Hannah's only mistake was underestimating human cruelty."

Her piercing glare made the crowd lower their eyes—all except Jessica, who stubbornly lifted her chin, though her ears burned scarlet.

"Proud of having connections?" Evelyn smirked. "You mock her for circumstances beyond her control, forgetting your own privilege is pure luck."

Under the lights, she gleamed like an unsheathed blade. Sebastian's throat tightened, something wild pounding in his chest.

"Bravo."

Applause sounded from the doorway. Alexander Roland strode in with Isabella Langley in tow.

He’d expected trouble after seeing the group chat, but he hadn’t anticipated Evelyn dismantling the farce first.

Blood truly was remarkable. He shot her an approving glance.

"My apologies for the spectacle, Mr. Valdemar," Alexander said.

Sebastian’s gaze skimmed the crowd. "I trust such individuals won’t be part of our collaboration."

"Of course not," Alexander assured.

Isabella seized the moment, fluttering her lashes. "KL values integrity above all, Mr. Valdemar!"

Sebastian ignored her, his attention elsewhere.

Biting her lip, she edged closer, but no one noticed her calculated move.

Alexander turned to Jessica. "Secret recordings. Slander. Inciting harassment. KL has no place for you."

As Jessica opened her mouth to name-drop her patron, he cut her off. "Report to HR immediately."

She stood frozen. Alexander was already addressing Sebastian. "Shall we resume our discussion?"

In the conference room, Sebastian suddenly asked, "That courageous woman—is she acquainted with you?"

Alexander remained impassive. "Merely a shared surname. Why the sudden interest in our staff?"

Meanwhile, Evelyn examined Hannah’s bruises with a sigh.

"This might be forward, but if you need help, I’m here."

Hannah collapsed into her arms, sobbing. "My father owes half a million in gambling debts. The loan sharks won’t stop—"

"First, we determine where the money went," Evelyn murmured, rubbing her trembling back.

"He swore it was a legitimate loan, but they took the cash and denied everything..." Hannah’s voice broke.
###Chapter 44

Hannah trembled as she handed her phone to Evelyn Roland. The numbers on the screen were staggering.

Evelyn only needed one glance before a cold smirk curled her lips.

"Child's play."

Hannah's eyes widened. "You...you can fix this?"

"Obviously." Evelyn's fingers flew across the keyboard. An address popped up moments later. "Your father only borrowed 100K. One month later, it ballooned to 5 million. Textbook loan shark operation."

Before Hannah could process it, Evelyn dragged her out of the office.

Three phone calls later, they stood before a shabby storefront labeled "Financial Consulting." Five burly men with full sleeve tattoos were already waiting.

Hannah instinctively stepped back—until the lead thug respectfully offered Evelyn a cigarette.

She lit it between her lips, squinting through the smoke.

"Wreck it."

The men kicked in the glass door. The crash made everyone inside jump.

"Which idiot thought they could run a loan shark ring here? Get out!"

Ten minutes later, Hannah stared at her bank notification, fingers shaking.

The smug loan shark who'd been sneering earlier now knelt on the floor, sobbing.

Evelyn lounged in the manager's chair, black leather jacket gleaming under the lights. She planted one boot on the man's back, her gaze sharp as a blade behind her shades.

"Heard you're good with numbers?"

The manager opened his mouth—only to get punched in the face. The others immediately dropped to their knees.

"We'll return everything! All the documents! Please, no more!"

Not only did they return every cent, they voluntarily handed over all their illegal records.

Hannah's jaw dropped at the sudden role reversal.

Evelyn was already spritzing perfume with a frown, disgustedly shrugging off her studded jacket.

"Um..." Hannah ventured softly.

"Hmm?"

"Do you have some secret identity?" Hannah's eyes sparkled. "That was insanely cool!"

Evelyn chuckled. "To deal with thugs, you have to out-thug them."

Hannah suddenly hugged her, tears soaking Evelyn's shirt. "Thank you...really, thank you..."

Evelyn patted her back, unaware of the figure lurking around the corner.

Zachary Merouin held his breath, phone camera trained on them. He'd been recording since Evelyn stormed the office.

When the sent notification chimed, his fingers trembled with excitement.

"Mr. Valdemar, you'll want to see this."

###Chapter 45

Sebastian Valdemar stared at his phone screen, brows slightly furrowed.

In the video Zachary sent, Evelyn Roland stood with one hand on her hip at the loan center, negotiating fiercely with the staff. Her gangster mannerism was a stark contrast to her usual gentle demeanor.

His fingertip tapped the screen, freezing the frame on her raised eyebrow.

"Mr. Valdemar, your coffee."

Theodore entered and nearly dropped the tray—his CEO was smiling? He rubbed his eyes instinctively.

"Leave it." Sebastian didn't look up.

Theodore set down the cup quietly, straining to glimpse the phone screen. The angle was wrong.

Silence returned to the office.

Sebastian traced the phone's edge, recalling two versions of Evelyn: the docile woman asking for his contact, and the fiery negotiator in the video.

Interesting.

Meanwhile, at an old apartment building in the east district.

"Solved it?" Richard Clementson swayed with an empty bottle, blocking their path. "Where's the money?"

Hannah's nails dug into her palms.

"No need to repay." Her voice was glacial.

Richard beamed, reaching to pat her shoulder. "That's my girl—"

"Don't touch me!" Hannah recoiled. "We're even now."

The flickering hallway light revealed her pale face.

Evelyn stepped forward subtly, shielding Hannah.

"You ungrateful bitch!" Richard smashed the bottle against the wall. "After all I've done for you!"

Shards sprayed everywhere.

Hannah trembled but stood straight. "Raised me? After Mom died, all you did was gamble and drink."

Her words were deliberate. "Last warning. Next time you're beaten in an alley, I won't even glance your way."

"How dare you!" Richard swung his fist.

Evelyn yanked Hannah aside. "I've recorded everything. Another move and I call the police."

His fist froze midair.

In the dim corridor, three elongated shadows stretched across the floor.
###Chapter 46

Hannah stood at the doorway, her nails digging deep into her palms. Her father's twisted face loomed inches away, the stench of cheap tobacco clinging to him.

"Get inside!" Richard raised his hand to strike.

Evelyn stepped between them, her stilettos clicking sharply against the floor. In one fluid motion, she seized his wrist and twisted it backward.

A bloodcurdling scream echoed through the hallway.

Hannah's pupils contracted. She'd never seen anyone overpower her father so effortlessly.

"Come inside, Hannah." Evelyn's voice was soft, but her eyes were glacial.

The door shut with a quiet click, followed by a heavy thud outside. Hannah pressed her ear to the wood, hearing her father's whimpering pleas.

"Lay a finger on her again," Evelyn said with chilling amusement, "and I'll mail your gambling IOUs directly to the loan sharks."

The apartment fell into suffocating silence.

When Richard slunk back inside, his face was plastered with an obsequious grin. He hunched over, offering a fruit platter with both hands. "Sweetheart, have...have some fruit..."

Hannah stared at the bruise blooming on his jawline, struck by the absurdity of it all.

"Is he possessed?" she whispered to Evelyn.

The designer wiped her hands with a sanitizing wipe, lips quirking. "Perhaps a sudden surge of paternal affection."

Meanwhile, on the 23rd floor of KL Group, a shrill wail pierced the air.

"Uncle!" Jessica slammed her resignation letter on the coffee table. "How dare that bitch fire me!"

Marcus stared at the signature—Alexander Roland—and felt cold sweat bead on his temple.

"Of all people, you had to provoke Mr. Roland's favorite..." He smashed his fist on the desk. "Go clear your desk at payroll. Now."

Jessica's mascara streaked down her cheeks. She remembered the way Evelyn had looked at her that morning—like she was something beneath notice.

"I won't accept this!" Her nails gouged the leather sofa. "That Hannah is nothing!"

Marcus leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper. "Rumor has it Hannah is Evelyn's—"

The intercom buzzed. The HR director's icy tone crackled through: "Mr. Macmillan. My office. Immediately."

Watching her uncle's face drain of color, Jessica finally understood—she'd messed with the wrong people.
###Chapter 47

Dorian Wayne pulled out a stack of tissues and handed them over, his eyes filled with heartache. Jessica Rubinstein was his niece, whom he had watched grow up. Seeing her get fired from the company pained him more than anyone else.

"Don't cry, Jess. Your uncle has been with KL Group for years. I won't let you suffer in vain." He patted her trembling shoulder, his voice low. "The person who did this to you will pay."

Jessica lifted her tear-streaked face, choking back sobs. "Uncle, you have to help me..."

The next morning.

Evelyn Roland had just settled into her workstation when her phone buzzed. A text from Hannah Clementson flashed on the screen: "Evelyn, I left in such a hurry yesterday that I forgot to sign my leave form. Can you help me with it?"

KL Group's policy required employees to notify HR a day in advance for leave requests. Failing to do so would affect their monthly attendance bonus.

Evelyn tapped a quick reply: "No problem. I'll handle it now."

In the HR office, a staff member handed her a form. "Fill this out and get it signed by Director Wang."

"Thanks." Evelyn took the form and completed it swiftly.

She knocked lightly on the director's office door.

"Come in."

Dorian Wayne was reviewing documents and didn't look up as he accepted the form. But when his eyes landed on the name tag, his pen froze mid-air.

"Evelyn Roland?" He narrowed his eyes, his tone turning icy. "This handwriting is illegible. Do it again."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She had written it neatly.

"Of course. I'll rewrite it." Suppressing her confusion, she stepped out.

The second form was filled with extra care—every stroke precise, every punctuation mark exact.

Dorian Wayne scrutinized it from every angle but found no flaws. Reluctantly, he signed.

"Thank you, Director Wang." Evelyn turned to leave.

"Wait." He suddenly called her back, pointing to a pile of documents in the corner. "Take these outdated files to the shredder."

Evelyn glanced at the stack, nearly waist-high, and pressed her lips together. "Understood."

As she lifted the files, she didn't notice the cold glint in Dorian Wayne's eyes.
###Chapter 48

"Understood, Director Wang."

Evelyn Roland had no idea a storm was brewing in the conference room on the thirtieth floor.

At exactly 10 a.m., all department heads of KL Design Group gathered in the meeting room. Alexander Roland's icy demeanor made the temperature in the room plummet. His long fingers struck the table with a sharp, unsettling rap.

"A three-hundred-million-dollar contract—vanished into thin air?"

The room was dead silent. Everyone kept their heads down, barely daring to breathe. It was the first time they'd seen the usually composed Alexander so furious.

"This document is tied to the company's most crucial project for the second half of the year." His voice was like frozen steel. "Do you understand the gravity of this?"

The CFO's pen clattered to the floor, the sound piercing the suffocating silence.

Suddenly, an assistant burst in, flustered.

"Mr. Roland, we found the file."

Sweat beaded on his forehead as his voice trembled.

"But... it's already been shredded."

The air turned to ice. Everyone held their breath, terrified of becoming the next casualty of Alexander's wrath.

"Investigate!" Alexander slammed his palm on the table, his knuckles white. "I want to know who did this!"

Surveillance footage was quickly pulled up. When Evelyn appeared on the screen, Alexander's pupils constricted.

"Evelyn Roland from the Third Design Department?" Dorian Wayne immediately jumped up, pointing accusingly at Adrienne Klein. "This is your team's doing! Who's going to cover the three-hundred-million loss?"

Adrienne's forehead glistened with sweat. Though she'd once doubted Evelyn's competence, working alongside her had changed her opinion entirely.

"Could there... be some misunderstanding?" she ventured weakly.

"Misunderstanding?" Wang sneered. "The footage is crystal clear. Are you trying to protect your own, Director Klein?"

At the far end of the table, Alexander's fingers tapped rhythmlessly against the wood. He needed to answer to the board—but he didn’t want Evelyn humiliated.

"Bring her here," he finally ordered, his voice taut with barely restrained tension.

Adrienne immediately dialed her phone. "Evelyn, come to the thirtieth-floor conference room. Now."

The elevator ascended slowly. Evelyn watched the numbers climb, her chest suddenly tightening with inexplicable dread. She pressed a hand to her heart, sensing something terrible was about to unfold.
###Chapter 49

The conference room door gave a soft knock.

Evelyn Roland stood outside, her fingertips still poised mid-air from rapping on the wood.

"Come in."

When she pushed open the door, the room fell into dead silence. Every executive's gaze snapped toward her, the air thick with tension.

Adrienne Klein sat at the head of the table, her expression grave. "A critical company contract was shredded in the printing room. Surveillance shows you were the only person who entered there this morning."

Evelyn's eyes swept across the assembled faces before landing on the Director of HR, Daniel Murphy. He was fiddling with a pen, the ghost of a smirk playing on his lips.

Suddenly, everything clicked.

"I did it," Evelyn stated plainly.

The room erupted. Whispers rippled through the crowd. Some shook their heads in disappointment. Others curled their lips in disdain.

Alexander Roland shot to his feet, but one sharp glance from her froze him in place.

"Since Miss Roland has confessed, we should proceed according to company policy," Daniel said airily, as if discussing the weather.

The head of marketing jumped in. "We happen to need someone for market research. She can collect sales data from department stores."

In the sweltering midsummer heat, it was clearly a punishment in disguise.

Before Adrienne could speak, Evelyn nodded. "No problem."

Her immediate agreement stunned everyone.

——

3 PM. The sun blazed overhead.

Evelyn entered the third department store's KL Boutique, the back of her blouse already soaked with sweat.

"Let me try that necklace." A saccharine voice rang out.

Victoria Lowell stood at the counter, pointing at a piece of jewelry behind the glass. Dressed in designer labels, the diamonds on her wrist glittered under the lights.

Evelyn pretended not to see her, approaching a sales associate to request sales figures.

"Oh my, if it isn't KL's little employee?" Victoria's voice sharpened. "Reduced to running errands now?"

Other customers turned to look.

Evelyn kept writing, her pen scratching against the notepad.

"Hey! I'm talking to you!" Victoria stomped over in her stilettos. "I demand service. Now!"

Her crimson-lacquered nails came dangerously close to Evelyn's face.
###Chapter 50

Victoria Lowell's nails dug into her palms as she strode into the jewelry boutique on stiletto heels. The humiliation Evelyn Roland had inflicted upon her at the charity gala resurfaced with a vengeance.

"Show me your most expensive pieces." Her chin lifted, voice sharp enough to cut glass.

The sales associate Jessica cast a nervous glance toward Evelyn, who stood observing calmly. The Lowell heiress always made extravagant demands but inevitably settled for the cheapest items.

Evelyn methodically slipped on white gloves, fingertips tapping twice against the glass counter.

"Which piece would you like to try, Miss Lowell?"

A malicious smile curled Victoria's crimson lips as her manicured finger swept across the display.

"All of them."

The boutique fell so silent one could hear a pin drop. Over twenty pieces—trying them all would take the entire afternoon.

Evelyn didn't even blink, retrieving the first necklace with practiced ease. She knew Victoria's type—the more attention paid, the worse the tantrums became.

"Is she insane?" whispered a new hire.

"Shh—rumor says Evelyn publicly humiliated her at last month's gala..."

The gossip died abruptly as a tall figure paused outside the glass doors.

Sebastian Valdemar's eyes narrowed. Through the window, he could see Evelyn's slightly reddened fingertips—she'd already fastened over a dozen necklaces.

"Mr. Valdemar?" His assistant halted in confusion.

The door chimed as Victoria sneered at a sapphire piece, "Who would display such hideous design?"

"Miss Lowell." Sebastian's voice held glacial precision. "Valdemar Group doesn't welcome clients of your caliber."

Victoria whirled around, face freezing mid-snarl. The Valdemar heir was the last person she expected here.

"I—I'm a paying customer!" Her bravado wavered.

Sebastian strode to Evelyn's side, effortlessly taking the necklace from her hands.

"Not anymore."

He pressed the service bell with measured force. "Security. Escort this woman out."

Victoria's face paled as she grabbed her purse and fled, shooting Evelyn one last venomous glare.

No one noticed the smartphone recording from the corner. By evening, #ValdemarHeirDefendsDesigner trended nationwide.

"...Valdemar Group stocks surged 5% today following the incident," the financial anchor reported, "reaching this year's peak..."

###Chapter 51

The entire mall fell silent the moment Sebastian Valdemar appeared.

He stood behind Evelyn Roland, his piercing gaze sweeping across the room. Everyone knew exactly whose side the Valdemar Group CEO was on.

"Finished?" Sebastian asked in a low voice.

Evelyn kept organizing the shelves without looking up. "Mm."

She turned to leave, but Sebastian caught her wrist.

"That's it?" He arched an eyebrow. "I came all this way to help, and not even a thank you?"

Evelyn shook off his grip. "None of your business."

Sebastian followed her relentlessly. "This happens to be my mall. Care to explain why you're here?"

Employees discreetly stepped back to give them space.

Evelyn finally stopped walking. "What do you want?"

"See this." Sebastian pulled out his phone and played a video.

The footage showed Evelyn standing over a debt collector, cigarette dangling from her lips, eyes sharp as daggers.

"Delete it." She lunged for the phone.

Sebastian easily dodged. "So fierce now? Where's that energy from when you helped your friend collect debts? Why take their insults today?"

"Fuck off." Evelyn turned on her heel.

Sebastian chuckled behind her. "Adorable."

The video went viral overnight. Netizens quickly uncovered Victoria Lowell's social media accounts, flooding her comments.

"This is the Lowell heiress? Classy."
"Someone audit Lowell Group's books."
"Already reported. You're welcome."

The next morning, Victoria got pelted with rotten eggs the moment she stepped outside. No suspects—just blind spots in the security cameras.

Worse, Lowell Group's stock began plummeting. Their website got overrun with mocking messages:

"Rebrand as Lowell Losers."
"With this heir, the company won't last three months."
"Waiting for bankruptcy filings."

###Chapter 52

Vincent Lowell kicked open the front door to find Victoria Lowell touching up her makeup in front of the mirror. Without a word, he stormed over and slapped her across the face.

The sharp crack echoed through the room as her lipstick clattered to the floor.

"Dad!" she shrieked, clutching her cheek.

"Shut up!" Vincent's veins bulged at his temples. "Look what you've done! Those photos are all over the internet!"

Tears spilled down Victoria's face. "It's all Evelyn Roland's fault! That bitch set me up!"

"You dare blame others?" Vincent grabbed her collar and shook her. "One more stunt like this, and I'll break your legs myself!"

Meanwhile, Valdemar Group's stock prices soared. The market responded enthusiastically to news of their collaboration with KL Design Group.

In the design department, Evelyn meticulously inspected the newly completed jewelry pieces. Three rare gemstones sparkled under the lights, perfectly set into the platinum bases she'd designed.

"Perfect," she murmured, closing the velvet case. "Send these to Sebastian for final approval."

Her assistant had just picked up the box when a crowd suddenly flooded the office.

"Wow! Is this the KL collection?" A female colleague gasped dramatically.

"Let us see!" A male coworker reached for the box.

The assistant stumbled back. "Be careful!"

"What's the big deal?" Someone snatched the case. "It's not like we'll break it."

Evelyn frowned. "Don't damage—"

Before she could finish, the group jostled around the box. Someone bumped into another—

Crash.

The sound of shattering gemstones pierced the air.

Silence fell.

"Not me!" The first grabber jumped away.

"You started it!"

"Bullshit! You're the one who pushed!"

Pale-faced, they all backed away, pointing fingers. The three priceless gems lay in fragments, their fractured surfaces mocking them under the lights.

Then a finger shot toward Evelyn.

"It's her fault! She dropped the box!"

###Chapter 53

"Did your design lack even the most basic protective measures?" A colleague pointed at the shattered gem fragments on the floor, her voice shrill. "If you'd included cushioning structures, the gem wouldn't have broken on impact!"

Evelyn Roland swept a cold gaze over the group.

"Why don't you just admit it was your design flaw to Mr. Valdemar?" Another colleague sidled closer, lowering her voice. "He dotes on you so much—he won't hold you accountable."

"Why should I take the blame for you?" Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Even if I tell him the truth, he still won't fault me."

"You're heartless!" someone snapped, eyes red with panic. "This is a team project! If things go south, we all suffer!"

"No," Evelyn took a step back, crossing her arms. "Only you will suffer. Whoever dropped it should take responsibility. Don't drag me into this."

"This gem is priceless! How could we possibly afford to compensate?"

"We're doomed. Will Valdemar Group sue us?"

"Maybe we should just quit and run..."

"You can run, but you can't hide!"

Chaos erupted as fear twisted their faces.

Evelyn watched them dispassionately. These same people had just tried to guilt-trip her. Now they were scared?

Still, the damaged necklace would delay the project. A solution was needed—fast.

"Enough!" Adrienne Klein strode in on stiletto heels. Her pupils constricted at the sight of the fragments. As a seasoned designer, she recognized the genuine article instantly, her face draining of color.

"Useless fools! Can't even hold a piece of jewelry properly? Maybe you belong in a kitchen scrubbing dishes!"

The group fell silent. "Adrienne, please help us... Get Evelyn to intervene..."

Adrienne's tone softened when she turned to Evelyn. "This won't end well for anyone if it escalates. They can't pay for this, but the project can't stall... Could you go to Valdemar Group?"

Evelyn's expression eased slightly.

She respected Adrienne. For her, she'd make an exception. Besides, the problem wasn't unsolvable—she just despised her colleagues' hypocrisy.

Seeing her hesitation, Adrienne signaled the others.

"Sorry, Evelyn! We were desperate!"
"Please, be the bigger person and help us!"

Evelyn ignored their hollow apologies. "I'll go to Valdemar Group. But whatever happens next is on you."

Carefully gathering the fragments and remnants, she left without a backward glance.

——

Valdemar Group, Top-floor Office.

"Trouble?" Sebastian Valdemar arched a brow at Evelyn's unexpected visit, his gaze dropping to the velvet box in her hands.

###Chapter 54

The velvet box creaked open in Evelyn Roland's hands. Her expression remained unreadable. "It's broken. My apologies—our team was too heavy-handed."

Sebastian Valdemar lifted a finger. His assistant immediately placed a steaming cup of coffee before Evelyn. She took the seat, her posture slightly less rigid than before.

"KL is willing to comply with any solution Valdemar Group proposes."

"That complicates things." Sebastian tapped the desk with long fingers, his hawk-like gaze pinning her. "These gems were rare auction acquisitions—priceless. Now the project is delayed, and the losses are incalculable."

Evelyn dipped her chin. She had anticipated this. "I'll report to the CEO. Valdemar will receive compensation."

"No rush." His tone shifted abruptly. "There's another option—let me see the birthmark on your waist."

"What birthmark?" Her brow furrowed.

Sebastian didn’t flinch. Once he set his mind to something, he never wavered.

"Don’t play dumb. One look, and KL walks away debt-free."

"Dream on!" She shot to her feet. "The mighty Valdemar CEO is secretly a lecher? You expect me to undress in your office?"

"Just your waist."

"Is there a difference?" Ice flashed in her eyes. "How many women have fallen for this trick?"

"You misunderstand."

"Perverts don’t get excuses!" Her fingers trembled with fury. "Not a chance!"

The air turned glacial. They stood locked in a silent battle, tension crackling like a lit fuse.

Then Sebastian relaxed, his usual composure sliding back into place. "Fine. What’s your solution? These stones aren’t replaceable."

Evelyn’s gaze dropped to the box. Fractured gemstones glimmered under the light, casting prismatic shards across the table.

"What if... we redesign with the fragments?"

"What?"

She was already moving. Delicate fingers rearranged the pieces with surgical precision. Three central stones dissolved into asymmetrical shards, suspended from chains of varying lengths. Tiny diamonds clustered around them like scattered stardust.

Under her touch, the once-staid design transformed—elegance edged with rebellion, sophistication laced with wildness.

When she finally stepped back, the office was dead silent.

"Well?" She tilted her chin, strands of hair brushing her neck.

Sebastian studied the creation, already envisioning it gracing a woman’s collarbone.

His eyes lifted to hers. "No wonder they call you the design world’s prodigy."

###Chapter 55

"You flatter me, Mr. Valdemar." Evelyn Roland's lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained unreadable.

Sebastian Valdemar gazed at the piece displayed in the glass case. The scattered diamonds refracted delicate sparks under the lights, like stars strewn across the night sky. His long fingers traced the edge of the display as he murmured in a low voice, "How about 'Shattered Stars'?"

Evelyn's fingertips trembled imperceptibly.

Shattered Stars—even when broken, they still shine.

"A beautiful name," she heard herself say.

Sebastian immediately instructed Theodore Ashcroft to send the piece to the R&D department. Three days later, the Shattered Stars Collection launched for pre-sale, crashing the company's website within minutes. Social media platforms were flooded with posts about the jewelry, and fashion influencers rushed to review it.

Evelyn's phone buzzed incessantly with collaboration requests. Even her long-forgotten early works were suddenly unearthed and discussed enthusiastically by netizens.

Ding—

The vibration interrupted her pencil strokes on the design draft. A blot of ink spread across the paper as she glanced at the caller ID.

"Alex?"

"Mom and Dad miss you," Alexander Roland's voice came through the phone. "I'm downstairs."

By the time the black Maybach rolled over fallen leaves into the underground garage, Evelyn was tucking the seventh draft into her drawer. The elevator descended to F3, and when she opened the car door, the familiar scent of cedar enveloped her.

Headlights cut through the twilight as the car approached the villa. Two figures stood under the porch light, waiting eagerly.

"Evelyn!" Sophia Roland hurried forward, her silver-streaked hair fluttering in the breeze. Edward Roland waited on the steps, holding a steaming soup pot that fogged up his glasses.

Evelyn's nose stung unexpectedly.

"I promise," she said, gripping her mother's wrinkled hands tightly. "I'll visit every week from now on."

Sophia's eyes brightened. "You'd better mean it!" The elderly couple flanked her as they walked inside, shielding her like a treasure they'd finally recovered.

Under the dining room chandelier, their three shadows stretched across the floor-to-ceiling windows—warm enough to make her heart ache.

###Chapter 56

Isabella Langley descended the spiral staircase in stilettos, her fingertips grazing the carved banister. The living room buzzed with laughter as she lingered in the shadows, nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

"Little sister came home today?" Her practiced smile dripped honey as she spoke.

Evelyn Roland glanced up, lips curved in perfect politeness. The entire Roland family doted on her—except this stepsister whose eyes hid daggers.

Crystal chandeliers bathed the dining room in golden light. Sophia Roland piled Evelyn's plate with food until it resembled a miniature mountain.

"Mom, that's enough." Evelyn gently stopped her mother's hand.

"Look how sharp your chin has gotten." Sophia caressed her daughter's cheek. "Have you been staying up late again?"

Alexander Roland set down his spoon with a metallic clink. "Listen to your mother."

"Okay." Evelyn lowered her head over her rice bowl, strands of hair veiling her flushed earlobes.

Edward Roland tapped his wineglass. "I heard the Shattered Stars Collection sold out?"

"Just got the report from marketing." Alexander's crow's feet deepened with pride. "Three hundred percent year-over-year growth."

"Just luck." Evelyn's lashes cast delicate shadows as she demurred.

Sophia squeezed her daughter's hand. "Our Evelyn has always—"

Clatter. Isabella's chopsticks hit the porcelain plate. She bent to retrieve them, her expression twisting behind the curtain of her hair. One day, she'd make them all kneel before her.

——

On the penthouse floor of Valdemar Tower, fountain pen ink bloomed across gilded stationery. Sebastian Valdemar signed his name with finality before pressing the intercom.

"Theodore."

His assistant entered to find the CEO adjusting his cufflinks.

"Deliver this personally to Designer Roland." Sebastian extended the envelope.

The wax seal gleamed ominously under the lights. Theodore's pupils contracted—this was Valdemar Group's highest-tier invitation.

"Any message to convey?"

"Unnecessary." Sebastian turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows, his reflection smirking back from the glass. "She'll come."
###Chapter 57

Theodore Ashcroft straightened his tie as he stood before the KL Design Group headquarters. He pulled out his phone to double-check the floor number Evelyn Roland had sent him.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Evelyn in a beige pantsuit, her hair pulled into a sleek bun.

"Ms. Roland." Theodore stepped forward.

Evelyn paused mid-step, her gaze dropping to the gilded envelope in his hand.

"From Mr. Valdemar." Theodore presented the invitation with deference. "For the Shattered Stars Collection gala."

Her fingers traced the embossed lettering as she accepted it. The motion brought back the memory of Sebastian Valdemar's fathomless eyes in the elevator that day.

"Please thank Mr. Valdemar for me." She tucked the envelope into her briefcase. "But I won't be attending."

Theodore blinked. In his years delivering Sebastian's invitations, he'd never seen a woman decline one.

Evelyn was already turning toward the elevator. Her posture remained ramrod straight as her heels clicked against the marble floor.

Back at her design department workstation, Evelyn had barely sat down when her colleague Penelope leaned in.

"Was that Theodore Ashcroft from Valdemar Group downstairs?" Penelope whispered. "I saw him hand you something."

Evelyn slid the invitation into her desk drawer. "Just work correspondence."

"Let me see!" Penelope snatched the envelope before Evelyn could stop her. "Oh my God! The Shattered Stars gala!"

The office erupted into chatter. Several female coworkers clustered around, voices overlapping.

"They only invite top clients and partners!"
"You're so lucky, Evelyn!"
"Can you get us in too?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. Sebastian's scrutinizing gaze flashed through her mind, stirring an inexplicable irritation.

"Sorry, I have prior commitments." She shut the drawer with a decisive click.

Meanwhile, in the Valdemar Group executive suite...

Theodore stood before Sebastian's desk, a sheen of sweat on his brow as he relayed Evelyn's refusal.

Sebastian's fountain pen stilled mid-signature, leaving an ink blot on the document.

"Her exact words?"

"Ms. Roland said...she appreciated the gesture but had other plans." Theodore chose his words carefully.

Sebastian chuckled darkly. He set down the pen and picked up the intercom.

"Connect me to Department Three at KL Design."

When the line clicked open, his voice brooked no argument: "Adrienne, I require your entire design team's presence at tomorrow's Shattered Stars launch."

Hanging up, Sebastian turned to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The setting sun gilded the cityscape, reflecting his faint smirk in the glass.

###Chapter 58 

The phone rang, and Sebastian Valdemar's voice came through the receiver, deep and restrained.

"Valdemar Group is hosting the Shattered Stars Collection launch tomorrow night. Top designers in the industry will be there."

He paused, fingers lightly tapping the desk.

"I've already sent an invitation to Evelyn Roland from the design department."

Adrienne Klein tightened her grip on the phone. She caught the implication—the CEO was clearly hinting for Evelyn to attend.

"Don't worry, Mr. Valdemar. I'll handle it."

After hanging up, Adrienne immediately dialed the internal line. Within five minutes, Evelyn stood before her desk.

"Did you receive the invitation from Valdemar Group?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered slightly as she nodded.

"You must attend tomorrow night," Adrienne said firmly. "It's a prime opportunity to network with industry leaders."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. She despised these superficial social events, but she had no choice. "Understood, Director."

News spread like wildfire through the design department.

In the break room, Isabella Langley crushed her paper cup in her hand. She glared at the news image of Valdemar Group on her screen, nails digging into her palm.

Why Evelyn again?

The sharp click of her heels echoed on the marble floor as she stormed into the CEO's office without knocking.

"Brother!"

Alexander Roland looked up from his documents, brows furrowed. "This is a workplace."

"Mr. Roland," Isabella corrected, though her tone remained defiant. "I want to attend Valdemar's event tomorrow night."

"Reason?"

"To learn!" She crossed her arms. "With so many master designers present, shouldn't I seize the chance to gain insights?"

Alexander closed the folder, his gaze sharp behind his glasses. He knew his sister too well.

"The invitations have already been sent."

"Then get another one!" She slammed her hands on his desk. "I'm a Langley heiress. Are you saying I can't even attend a gala?"

The air in the office turned icy.
###Chapter 59

"Suddenly interested in business galas?" Alexander Roland tapped the desk with slender fingers, understanding flashing in his eyes.

He knew his childhood companion too well.

Isabella Langley's ears turned pink. She abandoned pretense. "I want to learn from experienced professionals..."

"And see Sebastian Valdemar?" Alexander cut straight to the point.

The girl's lashes fluttered. A blush spread from her cheeks down her slender neck.

The man chuckled, retrieving a gilded invitation from his drawer. "Valdemar Group's invitation. Exactly what you wanted."

"Thank you, brother!" Isabella accepted it with trembling fingers, her excitement barely contained.

She traced the invitation's edge with determination. What was Evelyn Roland to her? She always got what she wanted.

The gala glittered under crystal chandeliers. Champagne flutes clinked amidst perfumed guests in evening wear.

Evelyn arrived hurriedly, still wearing her white work suit. Her dark hair was pulled into a sleek updo, standing out among the jeweled crowd.

"Miss Roland, your speech." Theodore Ashcroft materialized beside her.

"Speech?" She frowned.

"Last-minute addition." Theodore lowered his voice. "You're leading the Shattered Stars project."

Evelyn's gaze cut through the crowd, locking onto Sebastian's. The man stood where light and shadow met, his lips curved in a faint smirk.

His eyes clearly said: You can't escape.

"Mr. Valdemar insists you prioritize the company's interests," Theodore added.

Her knuckles whitened around the papers. "Understood."

As she turned, red wine splashed across her pristine white jacket. The stain bloomed like blood.

"Oh dear, how clumsy!" The waitress feigned shock, triumph gleaming in her eyes.

Evelyn's lips curled coldly. Such an amateurish performance.
###Chapter 60

Evelyn Roland's fingertips lightly brushed over the wine-stained hem of her dress, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

She lifted her gaze, scanning the crowd until her eyes landed on a familiar face—one adorned with flawless makeup.

Isabella Langley stood nearby, champagne flute in hand, her eyes gleaming with malicious delight.

"My apologies, miss..." The waiter's trembling hand offered her a napkin.

Evelyn accepted it, dabbing at the stain with deliberate slowness. The red wine had spread across the pale fabric like an ugly, blooming flower.

"Evelyn, how careless of you," Isabella cooed, her voice dripping with false sweetness as she approached. "You're about to give your speech, too."

Her nails dug into her palms.

How dare this country bumpkin get the chance to speak at the Valdemar event? Just because of that fluke "Shattered Stars" design?

Evelyn didn't even spare her a glance, striding straight toward the restroom.

Across the ballroom, Theodore Ashcroft leaned in. "Mr. Valdemar, Miss Roland's dress—"

"Send the spare," Sebastian Valdemar replied, his gaze fixed on Evelyn's retreating figure.

The restroom lights were harsh and unforgiving.

Evelyn frowned at her reflection. The wine had seeped deep into the fabric, leaving a sprawling stain at her waist.

"Miss Roland?" A female manager knocked before entering, holding an elegant box. "From Mr. Valdemar."

Inside lay a pink fringed gown, its waistline adorned with dazzling diamonds that caught the light.

After a brief hesitation, she changed into it.

The transformation was instant. The fringes swayed with her movements, the diamonds scattering light like stars. The dress hugged her curves perfectly—most surprisingly, it concealed the scar at her waist.

When she reentered the ballroom, Sebastian stood at the entrance.

His gaze lingered.

"It suits you," he murmured, his voice low.

Evelyn tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, her expression calm. "Thank you. Though if not for that speech, I'd rather leave now."

Sebastian arched a brow but said nothing. His eyes never left her.
###Chapter 61

The grand ballroom doors swung open slowly.

Sebastian Valdemar extended his right arm slightly, his gaze signaling Evelyn Roland.

After a brief hesitation, she rested her delicate fingers lightly on his forearm.

They entered the venue side by side, instantly becoming the center of attention.

Under the crystal chandeliers, Evelyn's champagne-colored gown shimmered brilliantly.

Alexander Roland turned from the front row, his pupils contracting.

He never imagined his long-lost sister could possess such grace.

Without any pretension, her every movement exuded aristocratic refinement.

That innate elegance couldn't be cultivated in ordinary households.

"Is that Mr. Valdemar's companion?"

"I heard she's the designer of Shattered Stars."

"My God, she's so young and beautiful!"

"They look absolutely perfect together."

The whispers reached Isabella Langley's ears.

Her knuckles turned white as she clenched her wine glass.

Jealousy burned in her eyes like wildfire.

Even after being drenched in wine, Evelyn still managed to shine.

"Bitch. Let's see how long your moment lasts."

She downed the entire glass, the alcohol burning her throat.

The host took the stage, announcing the official start of the event.

"Please welcome Mr. Sebastian Valdemar, CEO of Valdemar Group."

Sebastian ascended the podium with measured steps.

Taking the microphone, he went straight to the point.

"Tonight's true star is Ms. Evelyn Roland, designer of Shattered Stars."

Spotlights suddenly illuminated Evelyn.

She raised her glass gracefully, her smile perfectly poised.

At the microphone, she delivered her speech flawlessly.

Every word crisp, every syllable precise.

Even Theodore Ashcroft in the corner couldn't help being impressed.

"Thank you all for listening."

Evelyn curtsied elegantly, her skirt blooming like flower petals.

In the shadows, Isabella's nails dug deep into her palms.

"The real show is about to begin."

Suddenly, a chorus of phone notifications erupted.

[Breaking News: Shattered Stars Accused of Plagiarism!]

[Valdemar's New Designs Leaked!]

Within minutes, trending lists were flooded with related hashtags.

The atmosphere in the ballroom shifted instantly.

Alexander stared at his phone screen, brow furrowed.

His gaze through gold-rimmed glasses turned complex as he looked at Evelyn on stage.

He'd witnessed her talent firsthand.

Yet the current situation forced him to doubt.

Was this coincidence... or carefully orchestrated deception?
###Chapter 62

Sebastian Valdemar's fingers tapped lightly on the desk, his brow furrowed.

On the trending list, the hashtag #ShatteredStarsPlagiarism was climbing at an alarming rate, quickly reaching the top three.

"KL Group insider exposes Evelyn Roland's alleged design theft!"

The comments section exploded.

"I knew it. How could a rookie create something so stunning?"

"Valdemar Group is finished. Their stocks will plummet."

"Plagiarists should be banned from the design industry!"

Isabella Langley stood in the corner, a cold smirk playing on her lips. Watching the flood of hateful comments on her phone, she felt a surge of satisfaction.

"Ms. Roland, how do you respond to the plagiarism allegations?" A reporter suddenly shoved a microphone in Evelyn's face.

The camera flashes were blinding.

Sebastian moved to intervene, but Evelyn gently stopped him. Her expression remained calm, as if she were merely an observer.

"Mr. Valdemar, should PR handle this?" Theodore Ashcroft whispered urgently.

Sebastian shook his head. "Wait."

Just then, commotion erupted at the entrance.

The crowd parted like the Red Sea.

"It's Master Edmund Grandelle!"

The white-haired elder strode forward, his sharp gaze fixed on the Shattered Stars display.

"This design is from my sketchbook twenty years ago." His quiet voice silenced the room.

Reporters snapped photos frantically.

Isabella nearly laughed aloud. Feigning concern, she approached Evelyn. "Little sister, it's not too late to apologize—"

Evelyn's icy glare made her instinctively step back.

"Master Grandelle," Evelyn said evenly, "are you certain this is your work?"

The old man stroked his beard, adopting a sorrowful expression. "Taking shortcuts is understandable, but plagiarism is despicable."

Boos erupted from the audience.

Sebastian's face darkened. Before he could speak, Evelyn suddenly smiled.

That smile sent an inexplicable chill down Grandelle's spine.

"Since you claim this is your sketch," Evelyn pulled a flash drive from her bag, "shall we review the surveillance footage?"

Grandelle froze.

Every camera lens swiveled toward the tiny device.

Isabella's heart plummeted. Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at the flash drive.
###Chapter 63

Isabella Langley stood beside Evelyn Roland, her face etched with concern as she affectionately looped an arm through hers.

"Evelyn, you're still young. Mistakes happen. Just apologize to Mr. Grandelle, step away from the design world, and everyone will forgive you."

Her tone was gentle, but a calculating glint flickered in her eyes.

Evelyn coldly withdrew her arm, a mocking smile curling her lips.

"Miss Langley, my affairs are none of your concern."

Alexander Roland stepped forward, placing a firm hand on Isabella's shoulder. His voice was uncharacteristically stern.

"That's enough."

Isabella's eyes immediately welled with tears, her lips trembling as she bit down on them.

"Brother, I was only trying to help Evelyn..."

"Let's assess the situation first." He gave her a reassuring pat, though his gaze remained locked on Evelyn.

If things escalated, he wouldn’t stand by idly.

Across the venue, Theodore Ashcroft approached Sebastian Valdemar with urgency.

"Mr. Valdemar, public opinion is spiraling out of control. Forcing suppression will only damage Valdemar Group's reputation."

Sebastian's expression remained unreadable, his long fingers tapping lightly against the table.

"Clear the room."

He could have walked away, yet something inexplicable compelled him not to leave Evelyn to face this storm alone.

Theodore moved to act, but Evelyn raised a hand to stop him.

"Don’t."

Her voice was quiet but carried undeniable authority.

"I need these cameras."

Her composed demeanor made Theodore instinctively obey before he caught himself and glanced at Sebastian for confirmation.

Sebastian gave a slight nod.

Evelyn strode toward Edmund Grandelle, the sharp click of her heels echoing across the marble floor.

"Mr. Grandelle, you accused me of plagiarism. May I ask when your original draft was completed?"

She met the old man’s cloudy gaze, her tone steady.

Edmund hesitated, his eyes darting nervously.

"I—I have too many works to recall the exact date..."

A figure suddenly burst from the crowd.

"Evelyn Roland! How dare you question a senior after stealing his work?" Jessica Rubinstein sneered triumphantly.

She had waited for this moment—to see Evelyn utterly disgraced.

The room erupted in murmurs.

Evelyn let out a soft laugh, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"Miss Rubinstein, you seem awfully invested. Do you have insider knowledge?"

She swept her eyes across the crowd, her voice clear and unwavering.

"If I’m accused of plagiarism, shouldn’t there be proof?"
###Chapter 64

"Miss Rubinstein, if I recall correctly, you're no longer employed at KL Design Group." I arched an eyebrow at Jessica Rubinstein, my fingers drumming lightly on the table. "What gives a terminated former employee the right to interfere here?"

Jessica's face flushed crimson.

"Also," I continued, "how did you even get into this venue? Should I call security to verify your invitation?"

The murmurs in the room grew louder.

All eyes darted between me and Edmund Grandelle. But soon, the skeptical gazes settled firmly on me.

After all, Edmund was a titan in the jewelry design world. Who would believe he'd tarnish his own reputation to frame a newcomer?

"Quite the silver tongue for a little girl," Edmund sneered. "Too bad plagiarism is still plagiarism. No amount of excuses can change that."

I sighed and pulled out my sketchbook.

"Mr. Grandelle, are you certain only this one design is problematic?"

His brows furrowed. "What are you implying?"

My pencil flew across the paper, fluid lines coalescing into an entirely new design.

"If 'Shattered Stars' is accused of plagiarism, then I'll simply present another concept." My voice remained calm. "Inspiration isn't something I lack."

The fresh sketch shimmered under the lights, its monochrome strokes resembling a flowing galaxy.

"But by your logic," I continued sketching without looking up, "this one could also be stolen, couldn't it?"

A second design emerged. Then a third.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Alexander Roland stared wide-eyed at the torrent of creativity pouring from my pencil.

"Mr. Grandelle," I lifted the stack of sketches, "surely these can't all be your work too?"

Edmund's complexion darkened.

"If anyone still has doubts," I scanned the room, "why don't Mr. Grandelle and I have a live design challenge?"

The venue erupted.

"That girl has nerves of steel!"
"Challenging Edmund Grandelle? Now that's guts!"

Edmund took an unconscious step back, beads of sweat forming at his temples.

"What's wrong?" I pressed forward. "You came here all fired up to accuse me, but now you won't accept a simple challenge?"

Locking onto his evasive gaze, I enunciated each word: "Who exactly sent you to frame me?"
###Chapter 65

Evelyn Roland advanced with an aura so sharp it stole the breath from everyone's lungs.

Edmund Grandelle's temples gleamed with sweat, his Adam's apple bobbing in a silent struggle.

"Guilty conscience?" Her laugh was ice.

The room held its breath.

"Such concern for fellow designers." Her fingertip tapped the table. "Yet when a newcomer like me was accused of plagiarism, who stepped forward to clear my name?"

Her gaze cut through each person present.

"Does seniority grant license to rewrite the truth?"

Edmund's grip whitened on his cane. "Why would I frame you?"

"Eloquent." His face darkened. "Perhaps you've memorized one too many designs."

Jessica Rubinstein jumped in. "Exactly! No one drafts that fast without prior preparation!"

Isabella Langley's eyes welled up. "Evelyn would never—she's brilliant! You're just jealous!"

The words ignited the room.

"Jealous? Of some greenhorn?"

"Plagiarism is plagiarism! Design requires years of refinement!"

Whispers erupted like wildfire.

Isabella turned tearful eyes to Alexander Roland. "Brother, I didn't mean to—"

"Enough." Alexander yanked her behind him, his glare lethal.

Isabella shrank back, retreating to the crowd's fringe.

Evelyn dismissed the theatrics.

"Mr. Grandelle." She met his stare. "Since we disagree, why not settle this here?"

The cane struck the floor with a crack.

Veins bulged on Edmund's aged hands.

He knew—the Shattered Stars Collection was beyond his capabilities.

"Young lady..." His voice trembled. "Talent is commendable, but arrogance isn't."

Evelyn smiled. "You forced my hand."

She picked up her stylus.

"Now, let's end this."
###Chapter 66

"Master Edmund, your piece titled 'Sincerity' remains my favorite jewelry design." Evelyn Roland's fingertips lightly traced the Shattered Stars necklace at her throat. "The state of mind when you created it must have been entirely different from now."

Edmund Grandelle's fingers twitched violently, his knuckles turning white.

The crystal chandeliers cast mottled shadows across his face, revealing the turmoil in his eyes. Thirty years in the glittering world of jewelry had eroded his original passion.

After a prolonged silence, the elderly man slowly bent at the waist, bowing deeply to Evelyn.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Your talent shouldn't be buried by rumors." Edmund's voice was hoarse with emotion. "I...was blinded."

With trembling hands, he withdrew a yellowed design sketch from his suit pocket. "'Shattered Stars' was never my creation. I failed my duty as a trustee. Effective today, I retire permanently from design."

"The jewelry world will no longer have Edmund's star."

The old man staggered slightly as he turned. His expensive suit jacket looked garish under the lights. Step by step, he walked toward the exit, followed by a crescendo of jeers.

The same voices that once praised him now cut like knives.

Alexander Roland swept a cold gaze across the room. "Now. Apologies are in order."

The crowd erupted in sycophantic murmurs. Isabella Langley stood in the corner, her nails digging bloody crescents into her palms.

"Enough." Evelyn raised a hand. "Master Edmund has restored my reputation. There's no need to kick a man when he's down. As for the mastermind—"

She flipped open her laptop. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, blue light reflecting off her composed profile. In under three minutes, she traced the post's IP address.

KL Design Group's internal network.

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Alexander. Family scandals shouldn't be aired in public.

"I'll handle the aftermath." She closed the laptop with a soft click and nodded to the crowd. "My apologies for detaining everyone."

Sebastian Valdemar gave Theodore Ashcroft a meaningful look. His assistant immediately moved to manage PR damage control.

Adjusting her gown, Evelyn subtly nudged Alexander's elbow. The siblings moved wordlessly toward the fire exit.

In the empty stairwell, Alexander studied his sister's conflicted expression. "Out with it," he said. "Who did you find?"
###Chapter 67

"The company has no place for troublemakers who undermine unity."

"Give me the name. They're fired immediately." Alexander Roland's voice was steel.

Outside the security door, Sebastian Valdemar's leather shoes sank soundlessly into the plush carpet. He'd come to discuss a PR statement with Evelyn Roland—only to stumble upon this scene.

Through the door crack, he saw the way Alexander looked at Evelyn.

That was no superior assessing a subordinate.

It was tenderness bordering on adoration.

Sebastian's eyes narrowed. Interesting.

Office romance?

Or something more complicated?

The blue glow of a phone screen illuminated Evelyn's face. Her fingers tapped lightly, pinpointing an IP address with surgical precision.

"Dorian Wayne from HR."

Jessica Rubinstein's uncle.

Alexander took the phone. The flashing digits matched the computer terminal in Dorian Wayne's office.

In the banquet hall, Dorian Wayne was edging toward the exit when he was stopped. His face turned ashen.

"I didn't do it!" Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. "You call this evidence?"

Evelyn gave a soft laugh.

She pulled up Dorian Wayne's complete chat history with Edmund Grandelle—including the deleted messages.

"Care to keep lying?" She tilted her head. "What a shame."

Dorian Wayne's knees buckled.

"You're terminated." Alexander's voice could have frozen hell.

Sebastian's lips curved by the door. Such absolute trust was...unusual.

"I've devoted over a decade to this company!" Dorian Wayne suddenly shrieked. "And you believe this little girl?"

His voice echoed through the stairwell.
###Chapter 68

Dorian Wayne's knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists. He had worked diligently at the company for ten years without a single mistake. Now, he was about to lose his job over some insignificant girl.

"Mr. Roland, have you forgotten the value I've brought to this company?" His voice trembled. "All for the sake of Evelyn Roland?"

Alexander Roland's gaze was sharp as a blade. "When you used your position to help Jessica Rubinstein steal trade secrets, did you ever consider your so-called value?"

Dorian Wayne's face drained of color. He hadn’t expected this to come to light.

"Get out." Alexander's voice was ice.

Dorian Wayne suddenly burst into hysterical laughter. "You're all bewitched by that vixen! Alexander Roland, you'll regret this!"

Benjamin Chamberlain immediately stepped forward, gripping Dorian Wayne's shoulder and dragging him out.

The stairwell fell silent again. Alexander turned to Evelyn, his voice softening. "I'm sorry you had to witness that."

Outside the door, Sebastian Valdemar leaned against the wall, his fingers tapping lightly against the marble surface. He could hear the faint rustle of fabric from inside.

The elevator dinged open. Jessica Rubinstein rushed out, her hair disheveled, a glint of steel flashing in her hand.

"Die!" she shrieked, lunging at Evelyn.

Evelyn's pupils constricted. She instinctively sidestepped, but the blade still grazed her shirt, drawing a crimson bloom of blood.

"Watch out!" Alexander moved like lightning.

Jessica attacked again like a rabid dog. Evelyn gritted her teeth, preparing to counter—

A crisp scent of cedar suddenly enveloped her. Sebastian appeared out of nowhere, pulling her into his arms.

"You bitch!" Jessica brandished the fruit knife wildly. "I'll kill you!"

Sebastian's eyes darkened. With one hand, he twisted Jessica's wrist. The knife clattered to the ground as she cried out in pain, collapsing to her knees.

Security finally arrived, restraining the still-struggling Jessica.

Sebastian looked down at the girl in his arms. Her lashes fluttered, blood seeping from the wound at her waist. Just as he was about to release her, Alexander yanked Evelyn away.

"To the hospital," Alexander said tightly.

"No need," Evelyn shook her head. "It's just a scratch."

Sebastian narrowed his eyes. The intimacy between them inexplicably irritated him. "Mind your behavior in public," he said coldly.

Alexander quickly released her, realizing his lapse. "Thank you, Mr. Valdemar."

"Don't mention it." Sebastian turned to leave but paused at the corner. He heard Alexander murmur, "Evelyn, don’t come to the company alone again."

###Chapter 69 

Evelyn? Sebastian frowned. That term of endearment didn’t sound like a typical boss-employee relationship.
The hospital corridor was bathed in harsh fluorescent light.

Alexander Roland stood outside the examination room, his knuckles tapping rhythmically against the wall. His gaze was fixed on the faint scratch on Evelyn's arm, his brows knitted tightly.

"Brother, it really doesn't hurt," Evelyn said, shaking her bandaged wrist lightly.

The probing look Sebastian Valdemar had given her in the stairwell lingered in her mind. She deliberately tugged at Alexander's sleeve before he could explain.

Now wasn’t the right time.

"Mr. Valdemar seems to have misunderstood something," Alexander suddenly remarked.

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered. "Let him misunderstand."

As they walked through the hospital lobby, heads turned. Evelyn’s striking beauty glowed under the lights, while Alexander’s tall, poised figure exuded an air of nobility.

In the banquet hall, the champagne tower glittered brilliantly.

Isabella Langley crushed the stem of her wineglass in her grip. Crimson liquid dripped between her fingers, staining her dress.

"Miss Langley?" A waiter hurried over with a towel.

Her eyes remained fixed on the entrance, where Sebastian’s figure flashed by, his expression colder than usual.

"Mr. Valdemar..." Theodore Ashcroft hesitated.

"Quiet." Sebastian loosened his tie and strode away.

The chandelier in the villa’s living room cast a blinding glow.

Olivia Valdemar padded downstairs in slippers and found her brother staring at his phone, lost in thought.

"Done with the celebration so early?" she asked, deliberately raising her voice.

Sebastian locked his screen with suspicious speed.

"Evelyn didn’t come back with you?" Olivia leaned in, studying his face.

"She had other matters."

His tone was flat, but Olivia noticed his thumb absently tracing the edge of his phone.

A vibration interrupted the silence.

Evelyn stared at Olivia’s invitation, the wound beneath her bandage throbbing faintly.

[Free tomorrow? Join me for afternoon tea.]

She bit her lip. The screen brightened and dimmed, reflecting her conflicted expression.

"What’s wrong?" Alexander handed her a warm glass of milk.

"Nothing." She hit send. "A friend wants to meet tomorrow."

Outside the window, the Valdemar car slowly pulled away from the hospital. Sebastian leaned against the window, streetlights flickering across his sharp features.

He remembered the flash of crimson on Evelyn’s fingertips when she had tugged at Alexander’s sleeve in the stairwell.
###Chapter 70

Evelyn Roland was immersed in organizing the design drafts for KL Jewelry's new season when her phone vibrated abruptly.

She glanced at the screen—a message from Olivia Valdemar.

"Evelyn, I've been feeling uneasy lately. The doctor says the baby's condition is unstable. I heard you know some traditional remedies. Could you come see me?"

Her fingers hovered over the screen. Evelyn bit her lower lip lightly.

She had wanted to sever all ties with the Valdemar family.

"By the way, some ladies I know admire your design style. They’d like to commission a few custom jewelry sets."

At this, Evelyn's eyes brightened.

This was exactly the kind of opportunity she needed.

"Alright, tomorrow afternoon."

The next day, Evelyn arrived at a discreet private club in the suburbs, following the location sent to her.

The club was understated yet luxurious, its corridors lined with thick carpets that muffled every footstep.

When she pushed open the door to the private room, she froze.

Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, silhouetted against the sunlight, was Sebastian Valdemar's tall figure.

He turned, the light gilding the sharp contours of his profile.

"Why are you here?"

They spoke simultaneously.

Evelyn immediately took a step back, her fingers tightening around the door handle.

"Miss Valdemar said she wasn’t feeling well—"

"My sister just stepped out to take a call."

Sebastian frowned, clearly realizing something was amiss.

Evelyn turned to leave but found the door wouldn’t budge.

"What’s going on?"

She twisted the handle forcefully, the metal screeching in protest.

Olivia’s anxious voice came from outside: "The lock seems jammed! I’ve called maintenance."

The sound of footsteps faded away.

An eerie silence settled over the room.

Evelyn remained by the door, deliberately keeping the maximum distance between herself and Sebastian.

"Mr. Valdemar, we need to make things clear."

She took a steadying breath. "Our collaboration is over. Please stop letting your sister misunderstand things."

Sebastian set down the documents in his hand, his gaze heavy.

"That’s exactly what I wanted to say."

A sudden clap of thunder echoed outside as rain poured down without warning.

The maintenance worker never arrived.

In the confined space, the air grew stiflingly thin.
###Chapter 71

Olivia Valdemar stormed into the hotel lobby, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Beneath the crystal chandelier, her expression was colder than frost.

"My brother and sister are locked in a room," she snapped, her fingers drumming impatiently on the front desk. "Is this your so-called five-star service?"

The receptionist flinched under her piercing glare.

"We're terribly sorry. We'll send engineering right—"

"Now!" Olivia cut her off. "One second later, and I'll shut this place down by tomorrow."

She turned sharply, her heels striking the marble with urgent precision.

What was supposed to be a carefully arranged matchmaking meeting had spiraled into chaos. Olivia massaged her temples. That stubborn brother of hers—all her efforts wasted.

"Evelyn Roland is such a catch. What more could he possibly want?"

Across the lounge, Victoria Lowell stiffened on the leather sofa.

Evelyn Roland?

Her crimson nails dug into the Hermès bag strap. That bitch was here meeting a man in secret? This was a gift from fate itself.

A sinister smile curled Victoria's lips.

She hadn't forgotten the humiliation from the design competition. This time, she'd make sure that country bumpkin was utterly ruined. Silently, she pulled out her phone and switched it to mute.

As the elevator doors closed, malice flickered in Victoria's eyes.

Inside the suite, Sebastian Valdemar's gaze raked over Evelyn like an X-ray.

"Miss Roland seems quite close to Mr. Roland," he mused, twisting the signet ring on his pinky. "The way he defended you yesterday didn't seem... professional."

Evelyn's spine stiffened, her fingertips turning cold.

"You're mistaken," she said, lifting her teacup to mask her expression. "Mr. Roland treats all employees well."

Sebastian suddenly closed the distance, his towering frame eclipsing her.

"Is that so?" He leaned in, his breath brushing her ear. "Then why does he look at you like you're a long-lost treasure?"

Evelyn shot to her feet, but Sebastian caught her wrist.

"Show me your birthmark," he rasped. "Just once."

They stood locked in tension by the sofa. Evelyn could feel the scorching heat of his palm against her skin.

With a sharp twist, she broke free.

Surprise flashed in Sebastian's eyes—that move wasn't something an ordinary designer would know.

Evelyn had already retreated to the window.

"Stay back!" She flung the floor-to-ceiling window open.

Night wind rushed in, tangling her hair.

Sebastian's pupils constricted. "Are you insane? This is the second floor!"

He lunged to grab her, but Evelyn leaped without hesitation.

"Evelyn!"

His roar was swallowed by the howling wind.
###Chapter 72

Sebastian Valdemar lunged forward, desperate to catch her.

His fingers barely grazed her sleeve as she leaped gracefully from the windowsill.

The wind lifted the hem of her blouse, revealing a flash of pale skin at her waist.

His pupils constricted.

That birthmark—he could've sworn he saw the familiar crescent shape.

But the fleeting glimpse left him uncertain.

"Stop!" he growled.

Evelyn Roland didn't look back as she brushed off her sleeve, her retreating figure disappearing down the hallway.

Sebastian clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

The identical handwriting. The defensive reaction. That elusive birthmark.

Every clue pointed back to that rainy night.

The elevator doors slid open abruptly.

"Sebastian!" Olivia Valdemar hurried toward him. "Are you alright? Where's Evelyn?"

The man jerked his chin toward the open window.

"She jumped."

"What?" Olivia's face drained of color.

"Relax," Sebastian said coldly. "She's quite the acrobat."

Click—

A sudden camera shutter sound came from the hallway.

Victoria Lowell froze, phone raised in trembling hands.

She stared in horror at Sebastian's murderous expression.

"M-Mr. Valdemar..."

This wasn't part of the script.

She'd meant to photograph Evelyn with some secret lover.

Not Sebastian.

"The Lowells raise their daughters well," Sebastian said icily.

Olivia connected the dots instantly.

Her palm connected with Victoria's cheek in a sharp slap.

"Who gave you the right to spy on people?"

Victoria cowered, clutching her stinging face.

"I'm sorry—"

"Save it for Evelyn," Olivia sneered. "But your family will pay for your stupidity."

That afternoon.

Lowell Group's stock plummeted.

Vincent Lowell smashed his third teacup.

"That little bitch! She actually has the Valdemars wrapped around her finger!"

Margaret Hill gnashed her teeth. "Wasn't the old man supposed to dote on her?"

They exchanged glances, identical sinister smiles spreading across their faces.
###Chapter 73

Vincent Lowell heaved a heavy sigh. "What can we do now that he's dead?"

"What does death matter?" Margaret Hill's eyes glinted with malice. "Didn't that wretch care most about the old man's belongings?"

The sudden ring of a phone cut through the tension.

Evelyn Roland's fingers trembled slightly as she gripped her phone.

She never imagined the Lowells could stoop so low.

"Aren't you afraid of karma?" Her voice was icy.

Vincent scoffed. "Karma? The old man couldn't touch us when he was alive."

Margaret added with a sneer, "Besides, we're just helping the Lowell family through tough times."

Evelyn clenched her fists.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

"Fine." She suddenly relented. "I'll beg Sebastian Valdemar."

A shadow flickered in her eyes.

"But you must guarantee Grandpa's belongings remain untouched."

Margaret grew wary. "Words mean nothing. Record your conversation with Mr. Valdemar."

"Agreed." Evelyn's tone was frigid. "But if I find even a scratch on those items..."

She left the threat hanging.

As she turned to leave, Vincent blocked her path.

"We'll take you there."

Evelyn's heart tightened.

They meant to monitor her.

Outside Valdemar Tower, Theodore Ashcroft spotted her.

"Miss Roland?" His brows rose in surprise.

In the CEO's office, Sebastian listened to her request and suddenly smiled.

"Interesting." His fingers tapped the desk. "After what Victoria did to you, you're pleading for her?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

"I recall..." Sebastian studied her with a meaningful gaze. "You're not the forgiving type."

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, harsh and bright.

She narrowed her eyes slightly.

"You flatter me, Mr. Valdemar." Her voice was soft. "This is merely a transaction."
###Chapter 74

"You're targeting the Lowells because of Victoria's spying incident, aren't you?" I met Sebastian Valdemar's gaze without flinching. "I have a better way to deal with her."

"A family like the Lowells isn't worth your time."

I refused to mention Charles Lowell's inheritance. It wasn't relevant.

Sebastian's brow arched slightly, amusement flickering in his eyes. "Oh? Why should I trust you? What if I back off and you don't follow through?"

"I hate them more than you do." My lips curved into a cold smile. "If I fail, you can always crush this ant later."

He laughed then, clearly entertained by my unpredictable demeanor—sometimes rebellious, sometimes icy.

The recorder in my bag blinked red. After editing the audio, I headed straight to the Lowell estate.

Today, I would retrieve my grandfather's belongings.

Victoria blocked my path the moment I stepped inside, her face twisted with fury.

"Move."

She glared at me with pure hatred. As the biological daughter, she couldn't stand how I, an adopted child, always carried myself with unshakable dignity.

"This is the Lowell house! I'm the heiress!" she shrieked. "Who do you think you are?"

I ignored the idiot and turned away.

"Stop!"

She lunged after me like a rabid dog. When she saw me enter Grandfather's study, her voice turned venomous. "So you came to steal!"

"Don't project your filth onto others." I carefully gathered the calligraphy scrolls.

A lighter clicked behind me.

Victoria held the flame between her fingers, her smile grotesque. "No one will ever know."

The fire danced in her grasp.
###Chapter 75

The scent of sandalwood permeated Charles Lowell's chamber. Rosewood furniture gleamed softly in the sunlight. These priceless antiques had now become perfect kindling. Delicate curtains swayed, and scrolls of rice paper artwork hung low—a single spark was all it took to consume the entire space.

Evelyn Roland carefully rolled up a calligraphy scroll, her fingertips brushing against the yellowed paper. Suddenly, searing heat licked at her back.

She whirled around. Flames danced along the edge of a curtain, hungrily devouring the wooden window frame. The fire spread with terrifying speed.

"Victoria!" Evelyn's pupils constricted as she spotted the deranged woman hurling a burning tablecloth toward a stack of priceless scrolls.

The blaze erupted instantly, thick smoke billowing upward.

"Are you insane? These were Grandfather's treasures!" Evelyn lunged for the burning artworks but recoiled from the blistering heat.

Victoria stood by the doorway, eyes glittering with manic glee. "Burn! Let it all burn to ashes!" She tossed aside the lighter and fled.

Flames crawled up the wooden beams, the structure groaning under the assault. Gritting her teeth, Evelyn charged into the inferno to salvage what she could.

One scroll. Two. She darted through the firestorm, arms laden with precious artworks. Smoke seared her lungs, tears streaming down her soot-streaked face. The heat scorched her skin.

"Grandfather..." In the haze, she glimpsed the old man's silhouette—his patient hands guiding hers as he taught her calligraphy on tranquil afternoons. These memories lived within these very scrolls.

She couldn't give up.

Outside, servants scrambled in panic.

"Fire! Call emergency services!"

"Miss Roland is still inside!"

Sebastian Valdemar had just entered the courtyard when the commotion reached him. His gaze snapped to the black smoke pouring from the second-floor window.

"Evelyn?" His chest tightened.

A flicker of movement caught his eye—Victoria slipping out a side entrance, her smile chillingly serene. Understanding dawned instantly.

Without hesitation, he sprinted toward the burning mansion.

Blistering heat slammed into him as he kicked open the partially collapsed door. Inside, Evelyn staggered toward safety, arms clutching salvaged scrolls. Her hair was singed, face smeared with ash.

"Have you lost your mind?" He grabbed her arm.

She fought against him. "Let go! There's one more!"

Flames blocked their exit. Sebastian hauled her backward just as the ceiling beam crashed down where she'd stood moments before.

"No—" Evelyn collapsed to her knees, the rescued scrolls scattering across the floor. Trembling fingers traced the fire-scorched edges as tears splashed onto charred paper.

Sebastian watched in silence. This stubborn woman now seemed as fragile as the delicate rice paper she'd risked her life to save.

Sirens wailed in the distance. On the periphery of the gathering crowd, Victoria's triumphant smile slowly froze.
###Chapter 76

Sebastian's brows furrowed into a tight knot.

He had never encountered such a stubborn woman.

"Stop her!" he barked, but Theodore barely took a step before the slender figure vanished into the thick smoke.

"Damn it!"

Tearing off his tie, Sebastian charged into the inferno without hesitation.

The scorching heat hit him like a wall. He seized Evelyn's wrist. "Are you trying to get yourself killed?"

Her cheeks were flushed from the heat, her lashes dusted with ash. "These paintings are Grandfather Charles's life!"

Artworks lay scattered across the floor, some already licked by flames.

"Move!" She wrenched free and lunged for a nearby landscape.

Sebastian cursed, grabbing a bucket of water to douse the burning curtains.

"Hurry up!" He whipped off his suit jacket, beating back the encroaching fire.

As Evelyn gathered the scrolls, the ceiling groaned ominously.

"Look out!"

Sebastian shielded her just as a blazing beam crashed beside them.

The heat seared her back.

"Go!" He dragged her toward the exit, only to find their path blocked by a toppled bookshelf.

Flames devoured the last remaining paintings.

Evelyn suddenly broke free.

"You—"

She sprinted toward the fire without looking back. An explosion hurled her backward just as her fingers brushed a scroll.

Sebastian caught her scorched body.

"Enough!" His voice was raw. "Do you want Grandfather Charles to watch you die?"

The woman in his arms went rigid.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Staring at the ashes of her inheritance, she dug her nails into her palms.

"Thanks." The word was forced through clenched teeth.

Silently, Sebastian draped his jacket over her shoulders.

Outside, Victoria's heels clicked sharply against the cobblestones.

"Oh my!" She gasped theatrically. "Grandfather's estate—"

Evelyn lifted her head slowly.

Victoria recoiled from the bloodshot glare.

"You did this." It wasn't a question.

"Has my sister lost her mind?" Victoria forced a smile. "I just arrived—"

A sharp slap cut her off.

Victoria clutched her cheek, stunned.

"That," Evelyn enunciated, "was for Grandfather."

She bent to retrieve a charred fragment of canvas, her eyes glacial as she turned. "We'll settle the Lowell family's debts... slowly."
###Chapter 77

Slap! Slap!

The sharp sound of palm striking flesh echoed through the Lowell mansion. Victoria Lowell staggered back, her cheeks burning.

She clutched her face, eyes wide with shock. "Have you lost your mind? How dare you hit me?"

Victoria raised her hand to retaliate, but froze when she met Sebastian Valdemar's icy glare. The recent misfortunes of the Lowell family flashed through her mind, making her fingers tremble.

"Consider this interest on a debt," Evelyn Roland said, her voice colder than winter.

She turned toward the charred remains of a painting, her chest rising and falling rapidly. It had been her grandfather's favorite piece—now reduced to ashes.

Before Victoria could react, a kick sent her sprawling to the floor. She lay there, disheveled, her perfectly styled hair in wild disarray.

"You—" Victoria sobbed, her makeup streaking. "I'll sue you for this!"

"He was your own grandfather!" Evelyn clenched her fists. "How could you?"

Sebastian watched silently, his expression unreadable. Only now did he understand—Evelyn hadn't been desperately salvaging valuables, but cherished mementos of a loved one.

Vincent and Margaret Lowell rushed in, followed by flustered servants who helped Victoria up. She shrieked hysterically, "Call the police! Now!"

Sirens wailed outside moments later. The officers hesitated when they saw the slender young woman before them. "You're under arrest for assault. Come with us."

Evelyn nodded calmly and stepped into the patrol car.

At the station, Victoria refused any settlement. But soon, the Lowells delivered a Letter of Forgiveness—too afraid of Sebastian to escalate matters.

"Call your family to arrange bail," an officer said, handing her the phone.

Evelyn held the receiver with chilled fingers. She didn't want to involve the Rolands, and hesitated over whether to call Dylan Orlando.

"I'll post her bail."

A deep voice spoke from the doorway. Sebastian stood there, accompanied by a sharply dressed lawyer.

"From this moment," the attorney said smoothly, presenting his card, "I represent Miss Roland in all legal matters."
###Chapter 78

Evelyn Roland was led into a quiet reception room. Sebastian Valdemar leaned against the window, an unlit cigarette between his fingers.

Silence stretched between them.

Three hours later, a lawyer entered and nodded at Sebastian. "Mr. Valdemar, all the paperwork is complete."

Evelyn tightened her grip on her bag strap. She hadn’t expected Sebastian to be the one to help her in the end.

"Thank you."

It was the second time today she’d thanked this man. The first was when he’d rushed into the burning building to save those priceless paintings.

Sebastian lifted his gaze, his voice low. "No need. Valdemar Group shares responsibility for this."

His eyes flickered over the scrapes on her arm. Suddenly, he suggested, "Get a medical checkup."

There was something probing in those deep eyes. He needed to confirm—confirm the hazy memories from that night at the hotel, confirm the faint crescent-shaped mark on her waist.

Last time, he hadn’t gotten a clear look. But this woman felt unnervingly familiar.

Evelyn tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and declined politely. "It’s just a minor injury."

Sebastian arched a brow, his tone turning firm. "The Shattered Stars Collection enters its critical phase next week."

He deliberately slowed his words. "I can’t afford any delays caused by unforeseen circumstances."

The excuse was flawless, leaving no room for argument.

Under normal circumstances, Evelyn would have complied. But all she could think of now was Victoria Lowell’s pale face.

"Mr. Valdemar, my health—"

"KL and Valdemar Group have had a fruitful partnership," Sebastian interrupted, tapping the desk lightly. "To ensure everything goes smoothly, this checkup is necessary, don’t you think?"

His voice was calm, but the underlying authority was unmistakable.

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered. Finally, she forced a professional smile. "Fine. Let’s get it done."

A flicker of triumph crossed Sebastian’s eyes as he pulled out his car keys. "We’re going now."

The car was so quiet she could hear their breathing. Evelyn stared at the passing scenery, desperate for this absurd examination to end.

The moment the black sedan stopped, she pushed the door open. "Mr. Valdemar, I can handle this alone. You’ve already done enough today."

Sebastian stepped out leisurely. "It’s no trouble. Valdemar Group prioritizes the well-being of our partners."

The nurse at the station seemed prepared, greeting them warmly. "Mr. Valdemar, Miss Roland, please follow me."

For the next two hours, Evelyn was subjected to a full-body examination. Blood tests, CT scans, MRIs… She felt like a fish on a chopping block.
###Chapter 79

The corridor lights stretched Evelyn Roland's shadow into a long silhouette.

She stood outside the examination room, fingers unconsciously tightening around her purse strap. Every word of Sebastian Valdemar's conversation with the nurse had reached her ears.

"Mr. Valdemar, Miss Roland indeed has no birthmark on her waist," the nurse's voice carried clearly.

Sebastian's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.

A cold smile curled Evelyn's lips. She shoved the door open violently, the metal handle banging against the wall with a sharp crack.

"Does this amuse you, Mr. Valdemar?" Her voice dripped with ice.

Sebastian turned to face her furious gaze. He opened his mouth, but she cut him off.

"I'm not the person you're looking for." Evelyn took a deep breath. "Stop playing these ridiculous games."

Her stilettos clicked sharply against the tiled floor as she walked away. Sebastian watched her retreating figure, the doubt in his eyes gradually fading.

Night had deepened.

The grandfather clock chimed eleven times as Evelyn pushed open the front door. She tiptoed inside, careful not to wake the household.

The crystal chandelier suddenly blazed to life with a snap.

"Evelyn?" Sophia Roland's voice floated down the staircase.

Evelyn quickly hid her injured wrist behind her back. But Sophia had already descended, grabbing her arm with trembling hands.

"What happened?" Sophia's voice shook.

Edward Roland followed, his brow furrowed. "Did someone hurt you?"

Footsteps sounded from the second floor. Isabella Langley appeared in her robe, wearing perfectly measured concern. "Oh my, how did you get hurt?"

She reached for Evelyn's wound, only to be deftly avoided.

"Just a scratch from working late," Evelyn said lightly.

A shadow flickered through Isabella's eyes before she linked arms with Sophia. "Mother, don't worry. Our capable Evelyn can take care of herself."

But Sophia's eyes reddened. "Why won't you tell us when something's wrong?"

Evelyn gazed at their concerned faces, warmth rising in her chest. Yet she knew—some truths weren't ready to be revealed.
###Chapter 80

Isabella Langley approached with a teacup in hand, her face adorned with a saccharine smile.

"Evelyn, I heard you were injured. Are you alright?" Her doe-like eyes glistened, her voice dripping with honeyed concern.

I suppressed the urge to grimace.

At that banquet, it was those very same innocent-looking eyes that had discreetly signaled the waiter to spill red wine on me.

"Thank you for your concern. It's nothing serious." My tone was icy as I averted my gaze and took a sip of tea.

The warmth of the tea did nothing to thaw the chill in my heart.

The entire Roland family adored this seemingly angelic girl. Only I saw through the schemes hidden beneath her sweet smile.

Exposing her now would only backfire.

"Evelyn, are you really okay?" Sophia Roland reached for my hand, her brow furrowed with worry. "Should we take you to the hospital for another check-up?"

I shook my head gently. "It's already been treated. The doctor said it's just a superficial wound."

Alexander Roland abruptly set down his newspaper. "How did you get hurt?"

The air in the living room instantly grew heavy.

Lowering my lashes, I recounted the incident briefly. When mentioning the fire, I deliberately downplayed my actions.

"You ran into a burning building?" Alexander's voice sharpened.

Sophia gasped, exchanging a stunned glance with Edward Roland.

"The artworks were saved," I quickly added. "I couldn't let Charles Lowell's life's work be destroyed."

At the mention of Charles, my throat tightened. That kind old man, even on his deathbed, had fretted over seeing me married.

"We'll prepare the east room tomorrow," Sophia said, patting my hand. "It'll be dedicated to storing your artworks."

I nodded gratefully before remembering something. "Do you know any professional art restoration experts?"

Alexander frowned. "How many pieces were damaged?"

"Not many, but they need specialized treatment."

Edward suddenly stood. "I know Professor Li from the Metropolitan Museum. I'll contact him tomorrow."

Watching my family bustling about for me, warmth blossomed in my chest.

This hard-won familial love—I would cherish it dearly.

As for Isabella... My lips curved slightly as I caught sight of her clenched fist hidden beneath her skirt.

The fox's tail would reveal itself eventually.
###Chapter 81

Alexander Roland's heart ached as he took in Evelyn Roland's pale complexion. He gently grasped her hand, his voice firm. "Leave the artwork restoration to me. I've already contacted the top expert team in the country."

Evelyn gave a slight nod, her eyes growing warm with unshed tears.

For the first time, she realized that aside from Isabella Langley, the entire Roland family treated her as one of their own. This unconditional protection left her feeling overwhelmed.

Perhaps... she could try lowering her guard and learning to rely on these people who genuinely cared for her.

The next morning.

In Edward Roland's office, documents were signed in rapid succession. His expression was icy as he issued orders. "Terminate all collaborative projects with the Lowell family immediately. Notify all our partners—anyone who continues dealings with the Lowells will be considered an enemy of the Roland family."

Within half a day, Lowell Group's stock price hit the limit-down three times.

By the tenth canceled partnership call, Vincent Lowell could no longer remain seated. He slammed his phone down, beads of cold sweat forming on his forehead. "What the hell is going on? Why would the Rolands suddenly target us?"

Margaret Hill rushed in, her high heels clicking frantically against the floor. "Vincent, the board is in complete chaos!"

"I know!" He yanked at his tie irritably. "It's the Rolands pulling the strings behind this."

"When did we ever offend the Rolands?" Margaret's face drained of color. "They're the kind of family that can make the entire business world tremble with a single step!"

Vincent froze. He recalled Victoria's smug expression when she returned home yesterday—and the name she'd mentioned. Evelyn Roland.

"Don't tell me..." His voice shook. "That Evelyn has ties to the Roland family?"

The thought sent a chill down his spine. If true, the Lowell family might not survive this blow.

He immediately dialed his assistant. "Find out everything about Evelyn Roland's connection to the Rolands. Now!"

After hanging up, his hands still trembled. Margaret gripped his arm. "You think that little bitch is behind this?"

"I hope not." Vincent's eyes darkened. "Otherwise..."

He left the sentence unfinished, but they both understood the gravity of the situation.

The entire afternoon passed in oppressive silence at the Lowell estate. Every ring of the phone felt like a death knell, stretching their nerves to the breaking point.

When the assistant's call finally came, Vincent almost couldn't bring himself to answer.
###Chapter 82

Vincent Lowell stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, cigarette ash crumbling from his fingertips.

The cityscape stretched before him, its bustling traffic mirrored in the storm brewing behind his eyes.

Going head-to-head with the Roland family would be suicide.

But if it came to that...

He stubbed out the cigarette and grabbed his suit jacket.

Meanwhile, in the Roland Group CEO's office...

"Medical leave?" Evelyn Roland's lips curved in amusement. "It's just a scratch."

She slid a file across the desk to Alexander Roland. "I'll handle next week's bid personally."

Her phone vibrated.

"Boss!" Dylan Orlando's tense voice crackled through. "The Lowells are digging into you."

Evelyn's fingers stilled.

"Since when?"

"Just got the intel." Dylan lowered his voice. "Vincent Lowell gave the order himself."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed.

Beyond the glass, storm clouds gathered over the city skyline.

"Stand down on current ops." Her fingers flew across the keyboard. "Await my signal."

"Should I—"

"Don't spook them." She cut him off. "Meet at the usual spot tonight."

After hanging up, she scrolled through her contacts.

The cursor hovered over "Private Investigator."

The break room coffee machine hummed.

Evelyn dialed another number.

"Boss!" Dylan's excited whisper carried through.

"Café Southbank." Evelyn kept her voice low. "Get L to forge new identities."

She took a sip of coffee. "Make it fast."

Her computer screen still glowed when she returned.

Thirty minutes later, her phone buzzed.

"Done."

Evelyn smiled.

L might be greedy, but he was efficient.

Most importantly—with enough money, he could make the dead walk.

She closed the file, a glint of steel in her gaze.

If the Lowells wanted dirt, she'd give them an avalanche.
###Chapter 83

Evelyn Roland set down her phone, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

Dylan Orlando's efficiency had always been reliable.

At the Lowell family villa, Vincent Lowell stared at his phone screen, the tension in his shoulders finally easing.

The forged documents showed Evelyn came from humble beginnings, with no ties to high society.

"I told you she was ungrateful!" Victoria Lowell snatched the phone, her lips curling into a mocking smirk.

Vincent frowned. The Roland family's sudden hostility baffled him.

"Why not pay them a visit?" Margaret Hill suggested.

The next morning, the Lowells stood outside the Roland estate, clutching expensive gifts.

Sophia Roland listened to the butler's report, her silk robe sweeping coldly through the stairwell.

"Tell them to leave."

The butler bowed and delivered the message to the waiting couple. "Madam is not receiving guests."

"We can wait!" Margaret insisted.

Under the scorching sun, two basins of ice water suddenly drenched them.

Vincent's suit was soaked, but he dared not react.

The Roland manor blazed with light.

"Try this." Sophia placed a piece of snow-white fish into her daughter's bowl.

Isabella Langley stirred her spoon. "You must be exhausted dealing with my sister's mess, aren't you?"
###Chapter 84: Undercurrents

Evelyn's chopsticks froze midair.

She lifted her gaze to her parents, a sharp glint flashing in her eyes.

"Mom, Dad, are you hiding something from me?"

Edward and Sophia exchanged a glance, realizing the jig was up.

"Sweetheart, we just can't stand how the Lowells have treated you," Sophia said, squeezing her daughter's hand. "They must face consequences."

Edward nodded in agreement. "The Valdemars are supporting our efforts."

Evelyn shook her head gently.

She wasn't some fragile flower needing parental protection.

"I want to handle this myself."

Her voice was soft but carried unshakable resolve.

The private investigator she'd asked Dylan to contact earlier should have already delivered the message to the Lowells.

The game had only just begun.

"Gratitude for raising me?" A cold smile curled her lips. "I remember Grandpa Charles's kindness. But as for the others... I'll settle each debt one by one."

Sophia stared at her daughter in astonishment.

She'd never imagined such steel in Evelyn's heart.

"Very well. We'll follow your lead," Edward finally conceded.

The business world was in an uproar.

News of the Valdemars and Rolands jointly pressuring the Lowells spread like wildfire.

Former partners scrambled to distance themselves.

Vincent Lowell frantically dialed number after number, hitting wall after wall.

"Should we ask the Evans family for help?" Margaret suggested. "After all, Victoria and Nathan are still engaged."

Before she finished speaking, the butler rushed in.

"Sir! The Evans family just called—they're terminating the engagement!"

Vincent's face drained of color.

Meanwhile, Nathan Evans listened impatiently to the sobs on the other end of the line.

"Nathan, how could you be so cruel?" Victoria wept hysterically.

"Let's part amicably," Nathan replied coldly.

"I'm pregnant!"

Nathan shot to his feet.

"What did you say?"

"I'm carrying your child!" Victoria shrieked. "Would the Evans family dare abandon their own blood?"

A loud thud came through the phone.

Then Margaret's scream pierced the air: "Victoria! Victoria, what's wrong?"
###Chapter 85

Nathan's parents snatched the phone, their voices trembling. "You're pregnant? Where's the proof?"

Victoria quickly sent a photo of her pregnancy test report. The ultrasound clearly showed a four-week gestation result.

"Wonderful!" Nathan's mother clapped her hands in excitement. "I never thought we'd have a grandchild so soon!"

Nathan's father beamed with joy. After years of waiting, their dream was finally coming true. With Victoria carrying the Evans family heir, there was no way they'd call off the engagement now.

"Rest well and take care of the baby," Nathan's father declared firmly. "The wedding stands. Once the child is born, the Evans family will treat you right."

After hanging up, Victoria collapsed onto the couch, her back drenched in cold sweat. If the Evans family had broken the engagement, she'd have become the laughingstock of high society.

KL Design Group Headquarters.

A fiery red Ferrari parked arrogantly in front of the building. Olivia Valdemar strode inside in ten-centimeter heels, flanked by two bodyguards laden with luxury shopping bags.

The receptionist, mistaking her for a VIP client, eagerly escorted her to the design department.

Evelyn Roland was hunched over her desk, sketching designs. She wasn't working on KL projects—these were private commissions destined for overseas clients.

"Is Evelyn Roland here?"

Hearing that voice, Evelyn's pen stilled. She looked up to see Olivia standing at her office door, smiling sweetly. Alarm bells rang in Evelyn's mind.

"Can I help you, Olivia?" Evelyn set down her pen and rose calmly.

Olivia linked arms with her, eyes glistening with faux remorse. "About what happened the other day... I had to apologize in person."

She handed Evelyn a Hermès gift box, her voice sugary. "I was too impulsive. I nearly caused trouble for you and Sebastian. Did Victoria give you any problems?"

Evelyn's fingers turned cold at the memory of being locked in that room. She wasn't one to hold grudges, but she wouldn't easily trust someone who'd schemed against her.

"Let's forget it," Evelyn said with a faint smile. "Just don't let it happen again."

Olivia exhaled in exaggerated relief. Noticing the curious glances from colleagues, she clapped her hands lightly.

The bodyguards immediately distributed luxury bags to everyone in the office.

"I heard Evelyn is well-liked here," Olivia cooed. "Consider these little tokens my way of saying hello."

As colleagues unwrapped the gifts, gasps filled the room—each bag contained a limited-edition LV, the cheapest worth five figures.

"This is too much..." they murmured, yet clutched the bags tighter.

"Evelyn's talent is unmatched! Her designs always sell out!"

"Absolutely! She's the star of our department!"

Amid the sycophantic chorus, Evelyn's lips curled into a barely perceptible smirk.
###Chapter 86

"Evelyn, feel free to ask us anything you don't understand. We'll share all our knowledge with you."

"Yes, yes! It's rare to see someone as talented as Evelyn being so humble."

The flattery echoing through the office made Hannah roll her eyes. She remembered clearly how these same people had whispered in the breakroom last week, calling Evelyn a "nepotism hire with no real skills."

Hannah smirked. "Oh, so now you're sucking up? Let me guess—you've got your eyes on Evelyn's limited-edition Hermès?"

Their faces turned pale, but no one dared to retort.

Olivia smoothly maneuvered to Evelyn's side, linking arms with her. "Evelyn, darling, I know plenty of eligible bachelors. Would you like me to introduce you?"

She added meaningfully, "Like that gorgeous heir to the jewelry empire..."

Sebastian's sharp features flashed through Evelyn's mind. She shook her head instinctively. "No, thank you."

"What a shame." Olivia's eyes gleamed. She'd never seen a girl reject her brother so decisively.

Interesting.

Just as she was about to press further, Hannah barged in. "Evelyn, Alexander wants to see you."

In the CEO's office, Alexander slid a gilded invitation across the desk.

"The International Jewelry Design Awards. KL Group will be competing." His gaze burned into Evelyn. "I want you to represent our company."

Isabella's fingers clenched around her skirt hem.

She stared at that invitation—this opportunity should have been hers!

"I'm not going." Evelyn's refusal was crisp.

Alexander frowned. "With your skills, winning would be effortless."

"Brother!" Isabella interrupted with a pout, tugging his sleeve. "Why only ask Evelyn?"

She forced a magnanimous smile. "If Evelyn doesn't want to go... may I have the spot instead?"

God knew how much hatred seethed beneath those words. Since Evelyn's return to the Roland family, Isabella had become invisible.

Now even her last chance to prove herself was being stolen!

Isabella lowered her lashes, hiding the jealousy swirling in her eyes. She would make everyone see who the true jewel of the Roland family was.
###Chapter 87

Evelyn lowered her lashes, fingertips absently tracing the edge of the design draft as she curled into the corner like a startled rabbit.

Alexander watched his sister's timid demeanor, his chest tightening with protectiveness.

"If Isabella wants to participate, give her KL's competition slot," he said gently.

Isabella immediately fluttered into her brother's arms like an excited sparrow. "You're the best!" She buried her face against Alexander's shoulder, shooting Evelyn a triumphant glance.

Evelyn turned away, gaze fixed on the plane trees outside the window.

It wasn't that she didn't want to join the design competition. But the crisis at CH's P-country project demanded her attention. The daily financial losses kept her awake at night.

She'd stayed up completing her competition entry, revising it three times before satisfaction. The final draft now rested in Dylan's hands.

"Boss! This design is insane!" Dylan practically danced across the video call. "If we produce this, every luxury brand will grovel at your feet!"

"Speaking of which, since I've worked so hard—"

[Puppy-dog eyes emoji]

"Silence." Evelyn typed the word with icy precision.

Dylan instantly replied with a prostrate GIF.

Her fingers tapped the screen, sending a digital red envelope.

"Your Majesty is most gracious!"

"Your Majesty is most—"

"One more word and I deduct your salary."

"Submit this under the Celadon name for the International Jewelry Design Awards preliminaries."

The Celadon pseudonym carried legendary weight in design circles—each appearance caused seismic shifts.

"Consider it done!" Dylan thumped his chest before adding cheekily, "You're basically nuking a goldfish bowl. What chance do other contestants have?"

Evelyn recalled Isabella's eager expression, amusement flickering in her eyes.

Celadon's signature style stood unparalleled, with countless imitators becoming industry jokes. When her submission appeared during the public voting phase, the website froze for three full seconds.

The landslide victory came as no surprise.

Isabella also advanced to the semifinals, currently strutting into the office with a coffee cup held aloft.

"Sister, try my hand-brewed coffee." She slammed the cup onto Evelyn's desk, brown liquid sloshing over the rim.

Evelyn didn't even glance up.

Undeterred, Isabella raised her voice. "I'm feeling very confident about this competition!"
Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating Evelyn Roland's office as she meticulously adjusted her jewelry design sketches.

"I heard even Celadon has entered this year's International Jewelry Design Awards," a colleague remarked, sipping coffee. "Evelyn, aren't you considering joining?"

Her fingers paused mid-stroke. A faint smile touched her lips.

"Celadon..." She gently closed her laptop. "How fortunate for her."

Isabella Langley approached in stiletto heels, her dress swaying with each step. "Sister, you're not avoiding the competition because you're afraid of losing to me, are you?" She waved her phone. "I just received my semifinal notification."

The office erupted in sycophantic praise.

"Miss Langley is incredible!"

###Chapter 88

"To make the semifinals as Celadon—that's extraordinary!"

Evelyn reopened her laptop without glancing up. "Congratulations. Best of luck."

At Valdemar Group headquarters, Sebastian Valdemar scrolled through the competition website. Celadon's entry "Stellar River" dominated the leaderboard, votes tripling the runner-up.

He enlarged the design. A spark of admiration flickered in his eyes.

Fluid lines. Innovative concept. Every detail radiated brilliance.

The comments section overflowed with unanimous acclaim.

"Theodore," Sebastian pressed the intercom, "contact Celadon. Name her price."

Dylan Orlando nearly choked on his coffee when the call came.

"Valdemar Group?" His eyes widened. "Sebastian Valdemar wants to sign Celadon?"

He burst into Evelyn's office, slamming a recorder on her desk.

"Boss! Sebastian's trying to poach you!" He gesticulated wildly. "Seven-figure salary! Stock options!"

Evelyn twirled a pen between her fingers, amusement glinting in her gaze.

"He has taste."

"Do we accept?" Dylan rubbed his hands. "Perfect chance to infiltrate Valdemar!"

Beyond the windows, the sunset gilded the city skyline. Evelyn tilted her head, the pen executing a graceful spin.

"Tell Theodore," she smiled, "I look forward to meeting Mr. Valdemar."
###Chapter 89

Evelyn Roland tapped her fingers lightly on the desk, her red lips parting. "Go."

She retrieved a black velvet box from the drawer and slid it toward Dylan Orlando. "Wear this."

Inside lay a tiny earpiece.

Dylan arched a brow and smoothly inserted the device into his ear before turning toward the garage.

Outside Valdemar Group's headquarters, Theodore Ashcroft had been waiting.

"Mr. Celadon, it's an honor." Theodore bowed respectfully as he guided the way.

Dylan gave a casual nod and strode straight into the conference room.

He lounged lazily on the leather sofa, his fingers lightly tapping the rim of his coffee cup.

When the door swung open, Sebastian Valdemar's steps faltered imperceptibly.

He recognized this man.

In the hallway of Le Bar du Ritz, standing intimately close to Evelyn.

Sebastian's eyes darkened as a startling suspicion flashed through his mind.

"I didn't expect Mr. Celadon to be so young." He extended a hand, his tone laced with implication.

Dylan smirked. "Does Mr. Valdemar have prejudices against a designer's age?"

Evelyn's quickened breaths whispered through the earpiece.

Sebastian took his seat with practiced ease. "I invited you here to discuss the design philosophy behind your competition entry."

Every word carried an undercurrent of challenge.

Dylan instinctively tilted his head, listening to Evelyn's crisp instructions. He flawlessly repeated each technical term.

But Sebastian's gaze remained fixed on the side of his head.

"Mr. Orlando seems rather tense?" Sebastian suddenly leaned forward.

Dylan reflexively shifted back.

At that moment, the lights on the entire floor abruptly cut out.

An alarm shrieked through the darkness.

"What's happening?" Theodore's panicked voice echoed from the hallway.

Sebastian stood abruptly, his phone screen illuminating his sharp profile.

A red warning flashed across the display: System breach detected.

Evelyn's fingers flew across her keyboard, a cold smile curling her lips.

On the surveillance feed, she watched Sebastian stride toward the exit.

"Stop him," she murmured into the microphone.

Dylan suddenly blocked the doorway. "Mr. Valdemar, our conversation isn't over."

In the darkness, the two men locked eyes in a silent battle of wills.
###Chapter 90

The entire building plunged into darkness.

"What's going on?" Shouts erupted in the conference room.

Dylan Orlando shot to his feet, nearly knocking over his coffee cup.

"Damn it," he muttered under his breath.

Sebastian Valdemar remained motionless in his leather chair, long fingers tapping the desk.

In the dark, his sharp轮廓 stood out even more distinctly.

Theodore Ashcroft entered swiftly, leaning down to whisper in Sebastian's ear.

The man immediately opened his laptop, the blue glow illuminating his cold, chiseled features.

Evelyn Roland stared at the screen, fingers flying across the keyboard.

A bead of sweat trickled down her temple.

Sebastian's attack was more aggressive than she'd anticipated.

Three times.

He'd nearly pinpointed her location three times.

"Get out now," she hissed into the microphone.

Dylan yanked off his earpiece and stuffed it into his suit pocket.

"Find out who this Cyber Agent 136 is," Sebastian's voice was glacial.

The blackout was just a distraction.

The real target was infiltrating the company's system—yet nothing was stolen.

This wasn't corporate espionage.

Sebastian's gaze settled on Dylan.

Too convenient.

Almost like he'd been sent as a decoy.

"Shall we continue our discussion, Mr. Valdemar?" Dylan sat back down, tone light.

Sebastian circled behind him, eyes scanning.

The suit pocket was empty.

"I want Valdemar Group's mineral development rights for the Colorado mines." Dylan cut straight to the point.

CH needed resources to expand domestically.

KL was untouchable—Valdemar was the next best option.

"Celadon's reputation warrants that price."

Sebastian's eyes narrowed.

A designer wanting mining rights?

If it was about money, he'd have demanded profit shares directly.

"Deal." Sebastian suddenly smirked. "Pleasure doing business."

The moment Dylan left, Sebastian's expression darkened.

"Follow him."

Theodore vanished soundlessly down the hallway.

Evelyn tracked the red dot on her screen.

The earpiece was still on Dylan.

Then a blue dot appeared at the edge of the map.

Her pupils contracted.

"You're being tailed," she whispered urgently.

The earpiece vibrated three times.

Dylan casually put it back on.

"Turn right. Take the elevator."

He paused mid-step.

Discovered already?
###Chapter 91

A chill ran down Dylan Orlando's neck. His instincts screamed at him to turn around.

"Don't move." Evelyn Roland's voice crackled through his earpiece, sharp and commanding. "Maintain your pace."

He stiffened his shoulders and kept walking. His footsteps echoed through the deserted alleyway.

At the corner, a shadow flickered in his peripheral vision.

"Turn left." Evelyn's instructions were crisp. "Third right."

Dylan quickened his steps, pausing deliberately at the intersection. The footsteps behind him faltered.

Theodore Ashcroft wiped sweat from his brow. His target had accelerated unexpectedly, forcing him into a jog. As he rounded the corner, the alley stood empty.

"Lost him." Evelyn's light chuckle filled Dylan's ear. "Proceed to the safe house."

Darting through a convenience store's back entrance, Dylan flipped his baseball cap backward. The glass door reflected his tense profile.

Theodore clenched his fist and pulled out his phone. The red dot on his screen had vanished.

"Mr. Valdemar..." His voice trembled. "We lost the target."

Three seconds of silence stretched across the line.

"Location." Sebastian Valdemar's tone could freeze hell.

As Theodore recited coordinates, the sharp snap of a breaking pen echoed through the receiver.

In Valdemar Group's penthouse, Sebastian loosened his tie. Security footage froze on Dylan's last known position.

The elevator doors parted. He strode toward the garage, sunlight from the revolving doors making him squint.

"Mr. Valdemar, a moment."

A clear female voice halted him. Evelyn leaned against a marble column, twirling a folder between her fingers.

"Urgent signatures required." Her smile was perfectly calibrated. "Additional clauses for the Shattered Stars project."

Sebastian's gaze flicked to the letterhead. Authentic corporate seals.

"Leave it on my desk." He checked his watch.

Evelyn stepped closer, her subtle perfume drifting between them. Her eyes caught the glint of car keys in his breast pocket.

"Reschedule." He sidestepped her.

Evelyn's hand shot out to hold the elevator. "Actually, there's another—"

Her phone rang. "Director Orlando" flashed onscreen for a split second.

Sebastian's eyes turned arctic.

"My apologies." She declined the call smoothly. "Telemarketers."

As the elevator doors closed, her practiced smile dissolved.

In the parking garage, Sebastian wrenched the steering wheel. The Maybach's mirrors reflected the skyscraper's blinding glass facade.

He dialed another number. "Pull all of Evelyn Roland's recent call logs."

Meanwhile, in the safe house, Dylan stared at a monitor. The black Maybach peeled out of the garage.

"He took the bait." Evelyn entered with two coffee cups, steam curling upward. "That should buy us three hours."

Dylan accepted the cup, his expression obscured by vapor. "Worth the risk?"

Evelyn's hand froze midair. Outside the window, twilight swallowed the last rays of sunlight.
###Chapter 92

Evelyn Roland rounded the street corner swiftly, ensuring the tall figure behind her wasn't following before pressing her earpiece again.

"Clear?" she whispered.

"Just arrived," came Dylan Orlando's breathless reply through the earpiece. "Twenty flights of stairs."

The corner of Evelyn's lips lifted. She'd specifically instructed Dylan to avoid elevator cameras—no traces left behind.

"Remember, stick to the plan tomorrow," she tapped the earpiece lightly. "No slip-ups."

"Understood." Dylan's voice turned serious instantly.

The International Jewelry Design Awards were only three days away. Winning as Celadon to secure CH Jewelry Inc.'s mining rights—this was the culmination of her six-month scheme.

Morning light filtered through sheer curtains onto the dining table.

Evelyn sliced her omelette with deliberate precision, the clink of cutlery crisp in the air.

"Evelyn, won't you accompany Isabella to the competition today?" Alexander Roland approached, coffee in hand, his tie loosely draped around his neck.

"Business calls," she replied without looking up.

Isabella Langley looped her arm through her brother's, her skirt brushing against Evelyn's chair. "Sister, it's an international event. You'll get to meet so many masters."

The unspoken implication: You've never seen the world.

Evelyn smiled faintly. Oh, she would attend—just not as herself.

Luxury cars crowded the entrance of The Ritz-Carlton downtown.

As a contestant, Isabella arrived two hours early. A doorman bowed deeply as he opened the Rolls-Royce door.

"Mr. Roland, Miss Langley, this way, please." A hostess bent at a perfect ninety-degree angle.

The elevator mirrors reflected Isabella's meticulously styled figure. Adjusting her diamond earrings, her eyes gleamed with determination.

"Brother, do you like my new gown?" She twirled, the skirt flaring like a blossom.

"Stunning." Alexander ruffled her hair affectionately.

The elevator doors slid open soundlessly.

"Rumor has it Celadon is representing Valdemar Group this time," Alexander murmured. "Confident?"

Isabella's fingers stilled.

"I'll make sure KL Design Group's name echoes through the hall," she declared, chin lifted, nails digging into her palms.

No one had anticipated the legendary designer Celadon's sudden alliance with Valdemar—it had upended all her plans.

Crystal chandeliers showered the ballroom in starlight.

"Presenting KL Design Group's representative—Miss Isabella Langley!"

Spotlights followed Isabella as she ascended the stage in ten-centimeter heels. Her champagne-colored gown, studded with diamonds, shimmered with every step.

The applause swelled like tide.

"Next, Valdemar Group's特邀设计师—Master Celadon!"

A hush fell. Every neck craned toward the entrance.

Dylan Orlando appeared at the red carpet's end in a black tailcoat, a silver mask obscuring his features. Beneath it, his lips curved in a mysterious smile.
###Chapter 93

Dylan Orlando stood under the spotlight, his tall frame accentuated by the dark suit.

His fingers were long and strong, with distinct knuckles—a testament to years of handling celadon.

Whispers and gasps rippled through the audience.

"It's really Master Orlando!"
"I heard his celadon pieces sell for millions..."

Isabella Langley's gaze cut through the crowd, locking onto Sebastian Valdemar.

She had deliberately chosen a backless gown, the slit in her skirt teasing glimpses of skin.

"Mr. Valdemar." Her voice dripped with saccharine sweetness.

Sebastian didn't even glance up.

Isabella's nails dug into her palms.

Near the back entrance, Evelyn Roland adjusted her cap.

Hidden in the oversized sleeves of her janitor uniform was a miniature camera.

"New here?" An older cleaner eyed her suspiciously.

Evelyn offered a shy smile. "Supervisor Wang asked me to familiarize myself with the venue."

She intentionally used the wrong name.

"You mean Supervisor Li?" The cleaner corrected, her expression softening slightly.

Evelyn exhaled inwardly.

By the trash bin in the corner, she pretended to wipe down a table.

The angle provided a perfect view of the VIP section.

Sebastian's profile was sharp under the lights.

Dylan was showcasing a celadon vase, its glaze the color of sky after rain.

Isabella suddenly rose and strode toward the stage.

Her heels clicked sharply against the marble floor.

"Master Orlando, may I admire it up close?"

Her voice carried, drawing every eye in the room.

Evelyn's camera discreetly shifted focus.

Sebastian finally looked up, his brow furrowing.

The cleaner reappeared abruptly. "Girl, go collect the trash in the restroom."

Evelyn's fingers twitched.

The camera nearly slipped from her grasp.

###Chapter 94

"Location." Evelyn Roland's voice was barely above a whisper, her fingertips tapping lightly on the earpiece.

Dylan Orlando's hushed response crackled through the comms: "East service corridor, behind the third pillar."

Evelyn pushed the cleaning cart forward at a measured pace, her gloved fingers tightening imperceptibly beneath the rubber. Her disguise was flawless—gray work pants, a matching vest, even her hair pinned up in an intentionally frumpy bun.

At the corner, Dylan nearly collided with her.

"Boss?" His eyes widened as they swept over her appearance. "That outfit—"

"Quiet." Her sharp gaze flicked toward the security camera at the end of the hall. Under the pretense of handing him a rag, she slipped a micro-storage device into his sleeve. "Blueprints inside. Plan A."

Dylan's Adam's apple bobbed as he discreetly pocketed the device. The venue's security had been absurdly thorough—even dismantling pens for inspection. Who would suspect the schematics hidden inside a janitor's mop handle?

"Extract in three." Evelyn moved past him without breaking stride.

Her mop swiped across polished marble as she kept her peripheral vision locked on the main exhibition platform. The quantum chip display was her true objective.

"New here, sweetheart?"

A greasy voice slithered from behind. Evelyn's fingers stiffened before she slowly turned. Two men in tailored suits leered at her, ties loosened, reeking of alcohol.

"Need assistance?" She offered a practiced service smile.

"Absolutely." The taller one draped an arm over her shoulder. "How about a drink?"

Evelyn's lashes lowered, noting his limited-edition wristwatch and manicured nails—classic trust-fund brats. She shifted just enough to evade contact. "I'm on duty."

"Work's boring." The shorter one invaded her space, his cologne cloying. "We know somewhere fun."

The blind spot was the stairwell. Evelyn's lashes fluttered before she suddenly bloomed into a shy smile. "Well... lead the way?"

Their grins widened in triumph.

The moment the fire door clicked shut, Evelyn twisted the taller man's wrist, using his momentum to slam him into the wall. The shorter one barely registered the movement before a precise strike to his neck sent him crumpling.

Thirty-seven seconds. She checked her watch, arranged their unconscious forms into a drunken slumber, and pocketed their access cards.

"Area sanitized." Her murmur dissolved into the air as she stepped back into the glittering exhibition hall. Chandelier light caught in her eyes—flames sheathed in ice.
###Chapter 95

Evelyn Roland dug her fingers into her shoulders until her knuckles turned white. The filthy sensation still clung to her skin, making her want to scrub it raw.

"Disgusting," she muttered through gritted teeth, pushing open the stairwell door.

The hallway lights made her squint. She strode toward her cleaning station, oblivious to the tall figure shadowing her.

"Stop."

Sebastian Valdemar studied the slender back in the oversized janitor uniform. There was something familiar about that delicate waistline and the way she carried herself.

Evelyn froze. She'd recognize that voice anywhere. Turning around now would be walking straight into the lion's den.

She pretended not to hear, bending to wipe down a display case. The cloth made soft scraping sounds against the glass.

Sebastian's brow furrowed. This cleaner's attitude was suspicious.

As footsteps approached, Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs. Every muscle tensed, ready to strike. Compared to those spoiled brats earlier, this man was a hundred times more dangerous.

"Mr. Valdemar!"

Dylan Orlando's voice cut through the tension. He jogged over, headphone wires swinging. "There's an urgent proposal requiring your approval."

Sebastian gave the unmoving figure one last glance before turning away.

Only when the footsteps faded completely did Evelyn exhale. This spot was compromised now. Clutching the flash drive, she slipped into the staff dressing room.

The awards ceremony glittered under spotlights. Isabella Langley clung to Alexander Roland's arm, her voice syrupy sweet. "Brother, it's finally over."

"Our Isabella was magnificent," Alexander said, ruffling her hair. But his gaze kept drifting toward Sebastian.

Sebastian sat at the judges' table, long fingers tapping the armrest. He watched Isabella's performance with the same disinterest as a tedious board meeting.

Isabella bit her lip. She'd chosen this body-hugging gown specifically, yet Sebastian hadn't even glanced her way.

"And now, the final results!"

The host's booming voice filled the venue. Numbers scrolled across the giant screen—Dylan Orlando's votes surged ahead by a landslide.

Alexander's nails dug into his palms. This meant Isabella would lose the award.

"Don't worry, brother." Isabella suddenly smiled, her manicured finger tracing his hand. "The real show is just beginning."

Her eyes locked onto a shadowy corner backstage where a figure in a baseball cap melted into the darkness.
###Chapter 96

The numbers on the giant screen suddenly froze. Isabella Langley's pupils constricted sharply.

Her fingers dug into her palms unconsciously.

The vote curve took an eerie turn at the last second. Dylan Orlando's name leapt back to the top.

"System malfunction?" She heard the tremor in her own voice.

Alexander Roland's brows knitted together, his gaze sweeping across the venue like a hawk.

The audience erupted into louder chaos.

"Foul play! This has to be foul play!"
"He was just overtaken a moment ago!"
"The organizers need to explain!"

Camera flashes lit up the room, exposing Isabella's ghostly pale face.

She whipped her head toward the judges' panel.

Sebastian Valdemar was typing on his keyboard, the cold glare of his glasses obscuring his eyes.

"Brother..." She clutched Alexander's sleeve.

A soft chuckle came from the corner.

Evelyn Roland closed her laptop, her red lips curling in mockery.

The numbers on the screen began flickering wildly.

Dylan's votes skyrocketed like a rocket launch.

"This can't be!" Isabella shrieked.

She had already—

Sebastian suddenly looked up, his sharp gaze piercing through the crowd.

Evelyn quickly pulled her hat lower.

But it was too late.

A familiar IP address flashed on the screen for three seconds.

Sebastian's pupils dilated.

By the time he pushed his chair back, the figure in the corner had vanished.

"Check the surveillance," he ordered coldly into his earpiece.

The screen went black.

The crowd gasped.

Isabella's legs gave out, nearly sending her crashing to the floor.

Her carefully laid trap had been dismantled effortlessly.

And worse—

That person had returned.
###Chapter 97

"Isabella Langley? Impossible."

"How could KL's top designer do such a thing?"

"It must be a system error. Check again."

Whispers filled the room as disbelief painted every face.

Celadon's supporters exchanged uneasy glances. Though convinced she deserved the win, the idea of the Langley heiress cheating was beyond comprehension.

The host approached Isabella cautiously, extending the microphone.

"Miss Langley, would you like to comment?" His voice softened, wary of offending the Langley princess.

"No." Isabella forced composure, but her gaze darted nervously.

Her fingers clenched the fabric of her dress, knuckles whitening as nails dug into her palms.

Retrieving the mic, the host cleared his throat.

"Due to voting irregularities, the judging panel will suspend the awards ceremony for a full investigation."

The auditorium fell silent, the air thickening with tension.

Isabella strode toward backstage, stiletto heels clicking sharply against the floor.

In the shadows, Vanessa Valrose leaned gracefully against the wall.

Her tailored navy suit accentuated her statuesque frame, giving her the aura of a runway model.

"Cousin..." Isabella's voice trembled.

Vanessa smiled, tucking a stray lock of hair behind Isabella's ear.

"Why panic?"

"What do we do now?" Isabella bit her lip.

Vanessa produced a cigarette from her pocket, lighting it with deliberate slowness.

"That Dylan Orlando..." She exhaled a smoke ring. "Isn't Celadon."

Isabella's head snapped up.

"The real Celadon is a woman. Someone abroad saw her in person." Vanessa flicked ash from her cigarette. "Dylan's just an impostor."

A spark ignited in Isabella's eyes.

She turned toward the stage, lips curling into a cold smirk.

"Dylan Orlando... You're finished."
###Chapter 98

Isabella Langley clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms. Her burning gaze fixed on the figure confidently speaking on stage.

"Since when does someone like you get to tarnish the name of Celadon?"

She stood abruptly, her clear voice cutting through the air and instantly drawing every eye in the room.

Dylan Orlando, basking in the crowd's admiration, stiffened at the unexpected interruption.

"Isabella, what are you—"

"I'm asking you," Isabella strode toward the stage, her heels clicking sharply against the floor, "why are you pretending to be Celadon?"

The room erupted in murmurs.

Beads of sweat formed on Dylan's forehead, but he quickly straightened his posture. "Isabella, you still haven't explained how you tampered with the competition data. Now you're slandering me?"

He deliberately raised his voice for all to hear.

Isabella scoffed. "My affairs are none of your concern. But you—parading around with Celadon's work as your own—doesn't that weigh on your conscience?"

She turned to the audience. "Everyone, this man is not Celadon!"

Dylan's face paled, but he forced composure. "Proof? Without evidence, this is defamation!"

"Proof?" Isabella pulled a document from her bag. "This is Celadon's original signed design draft with a unique anti-counterfeit mark. Dare to compare it with yours?"

Dylan's hands trembled slightly. He hadn't anticipated this move.

"My... my designs are with the judging panel."

"Really?" Isabella pressed closer. "Then explain why your design philosophy matches Celadon's thesis word for word—published three years ago?"

The crowd buzzed with unrest.

Dylan's sweat multiplied. He grasped at straws. "A coincidence! Jewelry inspiration often overlaps—"

"Coincidence?" A deep voice cut in from the back.

Sebastian Valdemar rose slowly, holding a file between his long fingers.

"Then what about this?" His tone was icy. "Your so-called 'original design' even mirrors the exact brushstrokes of a discarded sketch Celadon made three years ago. Another coincidence?"

Dylan turned ghostly white.

Backstage, Evelyn Roland twisted her fingers into her clothes. She hadn't expected Sebastian's sudden appearance—or that he'd kept her abandoned drafts.

"I..." Dylan stammered, eyes darting.

Sebastian ascended the stage with measured steps, looking down at him. "Care to explain what your so-called 'tangerine orchid hue' actually is?"

Dylan's legs buckled, nearly collapsing.

The room fell deathly silent, every breath held for the finale of this farce.

"I..." Dylan's lips trembled, voice failing.

Sebastian turned to the audience with a cold smile. "As you can see, this 'Celadon' can't even describe his own color."

His gaze returned to the ashen-faced Dylan. "Now. Any last words?"
###Chapter 99

The blueprint still held residual warmth as Dylan Orlando clutched it, his hands trembling slightly. He had no time to fabricate an excuse.

"Can't answer?" Sebastian Valdemar's voice cut like an ice blade.

"Then let me rephrase." He took a step closer. "What's the core philosophy behind this competition?"

The real Celadon would never fail this question.

Dylan's Adam's apple bobbed. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

Isabella Langley let out a derisive laugh. "Can't keep up the act anymore?"

Her gaze clung to Sebastian, her pulse quickening. He'd ignored her earlier, yet now he stood up for her. He must have been impressed by her talent.

Whispers swelled from the audience.

"An impostor, just as I thought!"
"That piece was too perfect to be real."
"How shameless—pretending to be Master Celadon!"

Backstage, Evelyn Roland clenched her fists. Watching Dylan falter, she swiftly stripped off her work uniform.

Three minutes later, a dazzling figure stormed onto the stage.

"Who said he wasn't worthy of representing Celadon?"

Her voice sliced through the noise like a blade.

The crowd held their breath. The woman stood tall as a pine, her silver-white gown shimmering under the spotlight. Her piercing gaze swept across the room like an eagle's.

Dylan's eyes burned. He nearly rushed to embrace his savior.

"Evelyn?!" Isabella shrieked. She'd refused to attend this morning—how was she here now? Worse, that gown cost ten times hers.

"My apologies." Evelyn gave an elegant bow. "Due to personal reasons, I entrusted my apprentice to compete on my behalf. I didn't anticipate this misunderstanding."

She cast a reassuring glance at Dylan.

Sebastian's pupils constricted. He'd suspected Evelyn was extraordinary, but never imagined she was Celadon herself.

Only Alexander Roland maintained his enigmatic smile, as if he'd known all along.
###Chapter 100

Alexander Roland had planned to bring Evelyn to the exhibition today, hoping to broaden her horizons. To his disappointment, she flatly refused. He came alone, a tinge of loneliness lingering in his heart.

Fate always had a dramatic flair.

When he saw the familiar figure on stage introducing herself as Celadon, it felt like a bolt of lightning struck him. Shock gave way to an overwhelming surge of pride.

Though they hadn’t spent much time together as siblings, the bond of blood made him genuinely proud of her.

"Evelyn is Celadon..." he murmured, his lips curving into an unconscious smile.

Beside him, Isabella Langley dug her nails into her palms. She forced a smile. "Who knew Evelyn was so talented? Achieving such mastery at such a young age."

Her words sounded like praise, but the undercurrent of bitterness was unmistakable.

The humiliation from her earlier public embarrassment still burned, and now Evelyn had stolen the spotlight. She could barely suppress her fury.

"Yes, Evelyn is remarkable," Alexander replied absentmindedly, his gaze fixed on the stage.

Whispers of doubt spread through the crowd.

"Empty claims. How can you prove you’re Celadon?"
"Another impostor was just exposed. Are you a fraud too?"
"The title of Master Celadon isn’t something to be taken lightly!"

The audience buzzed with skepticism. After two "Celadons" in quick succession, no one knew what to believe.

Evelyn remained unshaken.

She turned toward the massive screen and raised a hand. The display lit up, unveiling a series of design sketches that unfurled like a scroll.

Each piece varied in style—some ethereal and delicate, others opulent and breathtaking—every stroke radiating the touch of a master. What stunned the crowd most were the numerous never-before-seen private works among them.

The venue erupted.

"These... these are Celadon’s personal collection!" someone gasped.

"Any more doubts?" Evelyn’s voice was cool.

From a corner came a resentful challenge: "What if you stole them?"

A flicker of mockery crossed her eyes.

She dialed a video call. Instantly, a lively face appeared on screen.

"Darling, you finally remembered me~" The girl’s playful voice echoed through the speakers.

The moment the audience recognized her, chaos broke out.

It was Falling Petals—the prodigious designer whose reputation rivaled Celadon’s!

"Tell them who I am," Evelyn said, angling the camera toward the crowd.

Falling Petals took in the scene and winked. "You sure you want to go public?" She knew her friend’s preference for privacy all too well.
###Chapter 101

"Explain." Evelyn Roland's voice was glacial.

Her slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the tabletop as her gaze swept across the restless crowd below. Only Falling Petals could verify her identity now.

Self-defense would be pointless—these people wouldn't believe a word she said.

"Everyone." Falling Petals' amplified voice filled the auditorium. "The woman standing before you is my dearest friend, Celadon."

The venue erupted before she finished speaking.

Camera flashes exploded like fireworks. Gasps and shouts rippled through the audience as people scrambled for a better view of the two legendary figures on stage.

Isabella Langley's face drained of color.

Of course she recognized Falling Petals—the undisputed queen of design whose endorsement could make or break any brand.

"Anything else to say?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow, triumph gleaming in her eyes.

Silence swallowed the room.

Isabella's nails bit into her palms. Her meticulously crafted scheme had unraveled in seconds.

"My apologies, Evelyn." She forced a contrite smile, though venom flickered in her eyes. "I only wanted justice for Master Celadon."

Her saccharine tone couldn't mask the underlying threat.

"I never imagined you were Celadon. As part of this company, I simply feared someone might impersonate the great master."

Isabella's chest heaved. Watching Evelyn bask in the spotlight while Alexander Roland gazed at her with undisguised pride made jealousy coil like a serpent in her gut.

Why? She was the Langley heiress—this should be her moment!

"So your solution was fabricating evidence?" Dylan Orlando interjected, his disgust palpable.

Isabella's breath hitched.

"That's not—" she stammered, "I only meant to help—"

"Distinguished guests." The host hurried onstage, cutting through the tension. "We sincerely apologize for the technical difficulties caused by our backend system."

His eyes flickered over Isabella before quickly looking away.
###Chapter 102

The host turned to Isabella Langley with an apologetic tone. "Miss Langley, we sincerely apologize for the earlier misunderstanding. It was our oversight to suspect you without concrete evidence."

Isabella's tense shoulders relaxed slightly.

She pressed her lips together. "It's fine. As long as the truth comes out."

Though her plans had been disrupted, at least her name was cleared. She glanced discreetly toward the stage, knowing her cousin had intervened behind the scenes.

"Let's congratulate this year's champion—Master Celadon!" the host announced loudly, handing the heavy gold medal to Evelyn Roland.

The venue erupted in cheers.

Camera flashes lit up Evelyn's composed face. She recited her acceptance speech mechanically, her eyes as cold as ice.

Alexander Roland stood in the audience, a flicker of admiration in his gaze.

Thunderous applause broke out. Everyone celebrated the young prodigy.

The closing bell rang, marking the official end of the competition.

Evelyn descended the steps slowly, her dress swaying. She narrowed her eyes, pondering the identity of the mastermind.

Isabella? No, she lacked the capability.

At the dressing room entrance, a tall figure blocked her path.

"Care to talk?" Sebastian Valdemar's deep voice resonated.

His gaze swept over the janitor uniform in the corner, his brow furrowing.

So it had been her that day.

Evelyn curved her lips. "Mr. Valdemar, do we have anything to discuss?"

"This time," he stepped closer, "I want to speak with the real Celadon."

The air turned frigid.

"I'm busy." She turned to leave.

"You're the head of CH Holdings."

The words struck like a blade, freezing Evelyn mid-step.

She turned back slowly, a flicker of panic in her eyes.

"How did you know?"

Sebastian advanced. "I figured it out the moment you revealed your identity."

"CH wants to enter the domestic market, which is why you're eager to partner with Valdemar Group."

He narrowed his eyes. "If this is a collaboration, you should show some sincerity."
###Chapter 103

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly. She hadn't expected her disguise to unravel this quickly—without even a moment to prepare.

"Let's talk somewhere else." Sebastian's tone brooked no argument.

She clenched her skirt. "Where?"

"Change your clothes. I'll wait outside." The man turned and left the dressing room, his footsteps fading.

Evelyn quickly changed into casual wear. When she pushed the door open, Sebastian was leaning against the wall, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"This way."

The café smelled faintly of Blue Mountain coffee. She chose a seat by the window, her tense reflection visible in the glass.

"What's your goal?" She broke the silence first.

Sebastian stirred his coffee leisurely. "Miss Celadon, that's my question for you." He leaned forward suddenly. "Or should I call you the mastermind behind CH?"

Outside, plane tree leaves spiraled to the ground.

"Dylan must have told you—CH wants the mining rights." Her nails dug into her palms.

"Fine." Sebastian smiled unexpectedly. "But I want exclusive rights to all your design blueprints." He paused. "And you'll sever all ties with Celadon."

It felt like having her heart carved out.

"Deal." Evelyn heard her own hoarse voice. "But one condition."

"Speak."

"The identity of CH's head ends here."

Sebastian lifted his coffee cup, tapping the rim lightly. "Pleasure doing business."

At the café entrance, Isabella clenched her phone. Through the lens, Sebastian was smiling at that country bumpkin—a rare sight.

She pressed the shutter with a cold smirk.

KL Design was in chaos.

Hannah's hands shook as she held out an autograph book. "Oh my god! I've been working with Celadon all this time!" She suddenly lunged forward. "Evelyn—no, goddess! Please sign this!"

Just as Evelyn was about to write, the office door slammed open.

"Evelyn Roland!" Gregory stormed in with security guards. "You're suspended pending investigation!"

Adrienne stepped forward in her stilettos. "Gregory, overstepping much?"

"Conspiring with a competitor's executive!" Gregory threw photos onto the table. "This is your design department's star employee?"

In the photos, the coffee cup reflected a cold, harsh light.
###Chapter 104

"What do you mean by that, Mr. Macmillan?" Adrienne crossed her arms, her sharp gaze fixed on Gregory. Having worked closely with Evelyn for days, she knew the designer's character well.

"Playing dumb?" Gregory sneered, slamming a stack of photos onto the conference table. "Take a look yourself. Photos of Evelyn meeting Sebastian Valdemar in private. Care to explain?"

"As a KL employee, betraying the company from within is utterly despicable."

Evelyn's pupils contracted slightly. She hadn't expected her meeting with Sebastian to be secretly photographed.

"Mr. Macmillan, you've misunderstood Evelyn." Isabella suddenly stepped forward from the crowd, a sweet smile on her face. "Evelyn is the renowned Celadon. It's only natural she has admirers."

"I trust she would never betray the company."

Her words sounded pleasant, but a sinister glint flashed in her eyes. These photos were her doing.

Gregory was such a fool, easily manipulated.

"Miss Langley, you're too kind." Gregory immediately switched to a fawning tone. "But this is no trivial matter."

"This so-called 'master' clearly doesn't care about KL. Otherwise, why would she refuse to represent the company in the competition?"

"Or has she already found her next employer?" Gregory pressed aggressively, drawing more onlookers.

Changing jobs? How laughable.

Isabella caught sight of Alexander rushing over and quickly adopted a worried expression.

"Mr. Macmillan, please don't say that. You don't know Evelyn's connection to the Roland family. How could she harm the company?"

Whispers erupted instantly.

A connection to the Rolands? Could she be Alexander's mistress? The crowd's gazes turned suggestive.

"What's going on?" Alexander strode in, his face dark.

Gregory seized the chance to accuse Evelyn, even summoning other shareholders. The scene descended into chaos.

Alexander trusted Evelyn implicitly. But with her identity still concealed, he could only watch as the accusations flew.

This was exactly what Isabella wanted.

"Give us an explanation! KL's losses affect all shareholders!" someone shouted.

"An explanation?" Evelyn leaned lazily against the desk, a stark contrast to Hannah, who was stomping her feet in frustration.

"It's simple. I wanted to give the competition opportunity to Miss Langley. Is that reason enough?"

Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "If Celadon competed, what chance would she have?"

Isabella's face paled instantly. She wished she could vanish on the spot.

The room fell silent.

Even Alexander thought the remark was too blunt.

"Celadon would never betray KL," he said, trying to diffuse the tension.

"Empty words!" Gregory exploded. "No proof means you're guilty!"

"Proof?"

Evelyn shoved her laptop toward the crowd.

"Let the tech department investigate now. If they find any evidence I leaked company secrets, I'll kneel and apologize to you. But if they don't—"

She fixed Gregory with an icy stare. "You'll kneel and apologize to me."

Alexander nodded to the tech director, who stepped forward to inspect the laptop.

Ten minutes later, the director shook his head. "Evelyn's computer is clean. No traces of communication with Valdemar Group."

Gregory's face turned beet red.
###Chapter 105

Isabella's nails dug deep into her palms as she forced a strained smile.

"Mr. Macmillan, you've truly misunderstood Evelyn. She isn't that kind of person. You owe her an apology."

Evelyn curled her lips in disdain. "Make sure you kneel when you do it."

Gregory Macmillan's face darkened. As a senior executive, he would never grovel before some young upstart.

"I—"

His entire body trembled with rage.

Alexander's voice turned icy. "In that case, Mr. Macmillan, surrender all your shares. I'll acquire them at market price."

Gregory paled. He never should have listened to Isabella's instigation.

"You—" He tried to defend himself, but Isabella cut him off.

"Mr. Macmillan, a wise man knows when to yield."

Her tone was venomous, her eyes filled with silent threat. Gregory immediately fell silent.

Evelyn cast them a dismissive glance. "I quit."

With CH Jewelry Inc. preparing to enter the domestic market, she had no time for their petty games.

The conference room erupted in murmurs.

Adrienne Klein, the design director, stood abruptly. "Evelyn, please reconsider! You could lead KL's entire design department."

Her talent more than qualified her.

Even the marketing director nodded in agreement. The executives' support made Isabella seethe with jealousy.

Evelyn shook her head calmly. "Thank you for KL's guidance during my time here."

She turned and walked away without hesitation. Her colleagues exchanged stunned glances—no one expected her to leave so decisively.

Isabella clenched her fists. Driving Evelyn out had been her goal, so why did she feel so suffocated?

How dare this nobody act so arrogantly? She was the Langley heiress!

——

At Blenheim Palace, Sophia burst into tears upon hearing her daughter had resigned.

"Evelyn, tell me honestly—did someone bully you?" She gripped her daughter's hands tightly.

Her long-lost treasure—she wanted to shield her from any harm.

"Evelyn, speak up. No Roland child should suffer injustice." Edward's face was etched with concern.

The sudden affection made Evelyn uncomfortable.

"No one bullied me. I just didn’t want to stay." Her voice was soft.

Sophia immediately glared at her son. "Was it you? Did you upset your sister?"

"Mom!" Alexander laughed helplessly. "I wouldn’t dare! If Evelyn had stayed at KL, it would’ve been my honor."

Bully Celadon? He wouldn’t have the courage even with ten lives to spare.
###Chapter 106

"You don't know yet, do you? She's Celadon."

Alexander Roland's eyes shone with pride. Even without this identity, he adored his long-lost sister beyond measure.

"What?" Sophia Roland sprang up from the couch, her voice cracking. "Celadon, the international jewelry design master?"

Her trembling finger pointed at the limited-edition poster of Celadon's design on the wall. "The same Celadon whose pieces I waited eight months in line for and still couldn't buy?"

Alexander nodded with a smile. "So when you accused me of bullying her, how could I dare?"

Sophia and Edward Roland exchanged glances, mutual shock reflected in their eyes.

Evelyn Roland gave a faint smile. "If you like them, Mom, I can customize something for you anytime."

"Wonderful!" Sophia's eyes reddened with emotion. That her daughter could achieve such mastery while trapped in the Lowell household was nothing short of miraculous.

Alexander's expression darkened abruptly. "Someone accused Evelyn of colluding with competitors. She resigned in anger."

"Who dares slander my daughter?" Sophia slammed her palm on the table, her well-maintained face contorted with fury. "Bring them here!"

"It's in the past." Evelyn waved it off casually. "Resigning wasn't just because of that. I wanted to explore new directions."

"Useless boy!" Sophia turned and jabbed Alexander's forehead. "Can't even protect your sister, despite your size!"

Her chest heaved at the thought of her daughter's suffering.

In the corner, Isabella Langley dug her nails into her palms until they left crescent marks. Since Evelyn's return, the family's attention had been completely stolen.

Their eyes were only for their biological daughter. Where did that leave her, the adopted one? If this continued, there'd be no place for her in the Roland family.

"Evelyn," Edward suddenly proposed, "how about you take over KL?"

"What?"

The siblings spoke in unison, clearly stunned by the suggestion.

Isabella nearly ground her teeth to dust. After all these years in the Roland household, she'd never even set foot in KL. How could Evelyn waltz in and take over the family business?

"No." Evelyn refused firmly. "CH is at a critical stage. I don't have the bandwidth for anything else."

She paused, then added, "Besides, Alexander manages it perfectly."

Sophia took her daughter's hand gently. "We'll support whatever you want to do."

Even if Evelyn asked for the stars, the Rolands would find a way to build a rocket.

"Mom, Dad..." Isabella spoke up timidly. "I... I'd like to try managing KL too."

"Of course, let Isabella gain some experience." Sophia agreed readily—after all, she was also her daughter.

"Oh," Edward remembered something. "Evelyn, would you like to go back to school?"

During her years with the Lowells, Evelyn hadn't even completed junior college—a lingering regret.

Evelyn's eyes lit up. Campus life would provide both cover and ample free time. Perfect.

"Okay." She agreed immediately.

With the Rolands' connections, Stanford University admission was secured within three days—a tier above Isabella's alma mater.
###Chapter 107

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains.

Evelyn Roland stood before the full-length mirror, tucking the last strand of hair behind her ear. The pale blue dress hugged her slender waist, making her skin glow like porcelain.

She grabbed her backpack and hurried out the door.

The Stanford University campus buzzed with activity.

Evelyn glanced at her phone's navigation, brows slightly furrowed. Getting lost on the first day of class wasn't a good sign.

Whispers floated around her.

"Which department is she from?"

"She's gorgeous, like a celebrity."

"Seems so aloof..."

She ignored them, quickening her pace through the crowd. Her watch showed she was already five minutes late, deepening her frown.

The moment she pushed open the classroom door, dozens of eyes turned toward her.

The man at the lectern turned, closing his book with long, elegant fingers.

Evelyn's pupils contracted slightly.

Sebastian Valdemar.

He wore a charcoal-gray suit, his tie perfectly knotted just below his Adam's apple. Sunlight slanted through the window, casting a golden halo around him.

"Sorry, Professor." Her voice was cool. "I'm late."

Gasps rippled through the classroom.

Sebastian's lips curved. "Come in."

Evelyn strode to an empty seat. Her bare desk stood out conspicuously among the sea of textbooks, drawing more curious glances.

"Marketing strategies for niche products..." Sebastian's voice suddenly paused. "The latecomer."

She looked up.

"Care to share your thoughts on target customer segmentation?"

The room erupted in murmurs. It was the first time Professor Valdemar had ever called on a tardy student.

A girl beside her slid a textbook over. Evelyn glanced at it and shook her head.

"First, establish an accurate user persona." She rose, her tone measured. "Then analyze consumption scenarios..."

As she articulated her points with precision, the classroom gradually fell silent.

When she finished, applause broke out.

A flicker of surprise crossed Sebastian's eyes. He hadn't expected such sharp business acumen from this seemingly ornamental girl.

"Well answered." His fingers tapped the lectern. "Now, what solutions would you propose for stagnant inventory?"

Each question grew more challenging.

Evelyn met his probing gaze, her red lips parting.
###Chapter 108

The classroom buzzed with chatter the moment the bell rang.

"That question was ridiculously tricky!"
"Is the professor deliberately targeting her?"
"Being handsome doesn't give him the right to bully people..."

Evelyn Roland remained unfazed, her fingers lightly tapping the desk.

"The key to perishable goods lies in their timeliness," she said coolly. "A regional distribution model would be optimal..."

The room gradually quieted. Some students began scribbling notes.

Sebastian Valdemar narrowed his eyes. Her business acumen was sharper than he'd anticipated.

The dismissal bell cut through his thoughts.

"That's all for today." He closed his lecture notes, his gaze lingering on her slender figure.

Evelyn packed her books with swift efficiency.

A faint smirk curved Sebastian's lips. CH Jewelry would soon become Valdemar Group's biggest threat.

A commotion erupted at the classroom door.

"Can I get your number? Your insights were amazing!"

A boy in a white hoodie pushed to the front, eyes bright. "Senior, I'm a sophomore in the business school—"

Evelyn took a half-step back. "No."

The boy's smile froze, like a puppy caught in the rain.

"Just one contact—"

Sebastian appeared at the perfect moment. "Miss Roland, come collect the reference materials from my office."

In the hallway, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"Thank you, Professor."

He gave a slight nod, a glint of amusement flashing in his eyes as he turned away.

Sunlight filtered through the sycamore leaves, dappling the stone path. Evelyn walked slowly, stepping over the patches of light.

"Evelyn?"

A familiar voice made her head snap up.
###Chapter 109

Evelyn Roland stepped out of the library with a stack of heavy textbooks in her arms. The autumn sunlight filtered through the plane trees, casting dappled shadows on her.

As she turned the corner of the academic building, hurried footsteps echoed behind her.

"Evelyn!"

Nathan Evans caught up in a few quick strides, his tailored suit starkly out of place on campus. His eyes burned with intensity as they landed on her books, his face lighting up with surprise.

"You go to school here?"

Evelyn paused, her brows knitting the moment she recognized him. She took a subtle step back, maintaining a safe distance.

"What do you want?"

Her tone was icy, as if addressing a stranger.

A flicker of irritation crossed Nathan's face before he smoothed it into a gentle expression. He knew girls like her—naive and easily swayed by sweet words.

"It was all a misunderstanding. Just give me a chance to explain."

He lowered his voice deliberately, eyes pleading.

"Unnecessary."

Evelyn turned to leave, but Nathan blocked her path. She sidestepped his reaching hand with practiced ease, disgust flashing in her eyes.

"Evelyn, you used to love me..."

"Love?" She let out a cold laugh. "You flatter yourself, Mr. Evans."

It had all been an act for Grandpa Charles' sake. Now that even his keepsakes had been desecrated by the Lowells, why should she spare their dignity?

Nathan's face darkened, but before he could react, a shrill voice cut through the air.

"Evelyn Roland! Have you no shame?"

Victoria Lowell stormed over in towering stilettos, latching onto Nathan's arm. Her glare was razor-sharp as she raised her voice theatrically.

"We're getting married, and you're still chasing my fiancé?"

Passing students slowed to watch.

Emboldened by the audience, Victoria jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "A stray dog kicked out by the Lowells, now turned homewrecker?"

She suddenly cradled her flat stomach, announcing haughtily, "I'm pregnant! Stay away from Nathan!"

Evelyn's gaze lingered briefly on Victoria's abdomen, her lips curling in derision. As a medical student, she saw through the lie instantly—the taut stomach, heavy perfume, and those precarious heels all betrayed the pathetic ruse.

It seemed the Lowells were truly desperate, resorting to such cheap tricks.
###Chapter 110

The Lowells' days of prosperity were numbered.

Since Victoria had delivered herself to Evelyn's doorstep, she shouldn't blame Evelyn for showing no mercy.

Evelyn watched Victoria's incessant chatter with cold detachment, her lips curling into a mocking smirk.

"Nathan, look at her attitude..." Victoria clung to Nathan's arm, preening with arrogance.

Nathan hung his head awkwardly, shrinking like a coward.

"Pregnant?" Evelyn suddenly laughed, her sharp gaze slicing toward Victoria's abdomen.

Victoria instinctively covered her stomach before puffing out her chest. "What, jealous?"

"Only you would treasure such trash." Evelyn adjusted her cuffs with deliberate nonchalance. "I find it repulsive."

She took a deliberate step forward, letting her shoulder brush against Victoria's.

"Ah!" Victoria shrieked dramatically, staggering backward. "My baby!"

Nathan rushed to steady her. "Victoria!"

"Nathan, she—she did that on purpose..." Victoria clutched his shirt, tears welling in her eyes.

Evelyn calmly pulled out her phone. "Should I call an ambulance? A pregnant woman falling could be serious."

"N-no need..." Victoria's face paled.

"Of course we must." Evelyn had already dialed. "This is the Evans family's heir we're talking about. Any mishap would be..."

The wail of sirens grew louder.

Beads of sweat formed on Victoria's forehead as she forced herself upright. "I'm fine. Let's just go..."

"Where's the patient?" A doctor in a white coat approached briskly.

Evelyn pointed at Victoria. "This pregnant woman just took a nasty fall. Please examine her thoroughly."

The moment the doctor took Victoria's pulse, his brow furrowed.

"This..."

Victoria thrashed wildly. "I told you I'm fine!"

"Stay still!" the doctor snapped. The monitor's readings told the undeniable truth.

Whispers rippled through the gathering crowd.

Evelyn crossed her arms, satisfaction flickering in her eyes.

This performance was only just beginning.
###Chapter 111

"The test results are in. You were never pregnant." The doctor tossed the report onto the desk with a cold expression. "Your stomach pain was gastrointestinal. Why waste gynecological resources?"

The medical staff shot her disdainful looks before leaving the examination room.

Nathan Evans' face darkened instantly. He grabbed Victoria Lowell by the collar. "You dared lie about being pregnant?"

"No, Nathan, let me explain—" Victoria clutched his arm in panic.

Evelyn Roland smirked, picked up her bag, and turned to leave. Nathan immediately abandoned the sobbing Victoria and chased after her.

"Get lost." She wrinkled her nose in disgust.

But Nathan clung to her like stubborn gum.

A sharp screech of brakes cut through the air.

A black Maybach pulled up smoothly beside her. The window rolled down, revealing Sebastian Valdemar's sharply defined features.

"Get in."

Tires kicked up dust, forcing Nathan to stumble back coughing. He glared at the retreating car, fists clenched until his knuckles cracked.

"Evelyn Roland, just you wait!"

Inside the car, the faint scent of ambergris lingered.

Evelyn watched the scenery blur past outside the window, her tense nerves finally relaxing.

"You can drop me at the next intersection. Thanks for today."

Sebastian's long fingers tapped the steering wheel. "Running off after using me?"

"Don't flatter yourself." She calmly tightened her seatbelt. "The designs will be ready next week. They won't delay Valdemar's product launch."

The car slowed to a stop under a canopy of sycamore trees.

"Confident, aren't you?" He turned, his amber eyes locking onto her like a predator's.

"CH never takes on uncertain ventures." She unbuckled her seatbelt, red lips curving. "Just prepare the contract, Mr. Valdemar."

The rhythmic tapping stopped abruptly.

Sebastian leaned in suddenly, his warm breath brushing her ear. "I look forward to it."

Evelyn pushed the car door open with practiced composure. Her stiletto had barely touched the pavement when she spotted Alexander Roland standing three paces away.

In the rearview mirror, Sebastian narrowed his eyes and reversed back toward them.

"What a coincidence, Mr. Roland." He rolled down the window, gaze flickering between the siblings. "Fancy meeting KL's CEO in a place like this."

Alexander's impeccably tailored suit cast a long shadow in the afternoon sun.
###Chapter 112

Sebastian Valdemar narrowed his eyes, his gaze shifting between Evelyn Roland and Alexander Roland.

The unspoken understanding between them was palpable.

A rumor suddenly surfaced in his mind.

"What a coincidence to find you here, Mr. Roland," Sebastian drawled, his voice laced with suspicion. "Could it be you came specifically to pick someone up?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched imperceptibly before she steadied herself.

"There was an issue with the project handover," Alexander replied smoothly, unperturbed. "The third-quarter reports didn't match."

He pulled a document from his briefcase with practiced ease.

"Since we ran into each other, I thought we might as well clarify things in person."

Sebastian's knuckles rapped lightly against the table as he studied the file.

"Is that so?"

Meanwhile, the Lowell mansion echoed with the sound of shattering glass.

"That bastard Nathan Evans!"

Victoria Lowell swept every bottle and jar off her vanity with a furious cry.

She snatched her phone, the screen still displaying the photo of Nathan standing beside Evelyn.

"Slut! Both of them!"

Margaret Hill burst into the room to find her daughter hacking at wedding photos with a pair of scissors.

"Mom! I want them to suffer!" Victoria screamed, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Margaret yanked the scissors away.

"Have you lost your mind?"

She dialed the Evans residence, her voice shrill with outrage.

"The Evans family owes us an explanation!"

A cold laugh came through the line.

"An explanation? What about your daughter faking a pregnancy to trap my son into marriage?"

Margaret's face drained of color.

In the Evans living room, Nathan swirled his wine glass with a smug smile.

"Don’t worry, Mother."

His lips curled in satisfaction.

"Evelyn is just playing hard to get."

Mrs. Evans frowned. "But her status has changed now..."

"Even better," Nathan cut in. "Being the Roland family's son-in-law is far more valuable than the Lowells."

He recalled the way Evelyn used to look at him.

That kind of obsession couldn’t just disappear.

"Just wait. She’ll come crawling back to me soon enough."

Meanwhile, Alexander's car pulled away from the café.

"He’s suspicious," Evelyn murmured, watching Sebastian’s unmoving figure in the rearview mirror.

Alexander turned the steering wheel, his voice steady.

"Proceed as planned."

His sharp profile remained impassive, but a glint of determination flashed in his eyes.

"The game has only just begun."
###Chapter 113

Dawn's first light glinted off a row of over a dozen limited-edition sports cars parked outside Blenheim Palace, their sleek surfaces radiating cold luxury.

Sophia Roland clasped Evelyn's hand, her eyes brimming with affection. "Darling, I had these specially prepared for you. Pick whichever you like."

"With Alexander away, I simply can't rest easy knowing you're commuting alone."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a flicker of resignation crossing her gaze.

Now she understood the root of Isabella's spoiled nature—daughters here were truly coddled like precious jewels.

Yet these flashy vehicles were already gathering dust in her private collection.

"Parking is scarce on campus. Driving would be inconvenient."

Edward interjected hastily, "Then let Old Liu chauffeur you. He's been my personal driver for twenty years."

Their suffocating concern left Evelyn momentarily speechless.

Nearby, Isabella dug her nails into her palms, her smile remaining saccharine.

"I'm heading to the Colorado Mines for a project inspection anyway. I can drop you off." Her voice dripped honey. "Hop in, Evelyn."

Sophia beamed, visibly relieved by this display of sisterly harmony. She'd secretly feared Isabella might resent her newfound sibling.

"Very well."

Under her parents' expectant gazes, Evelyn had no choice but to comply.

The car door hadn't fully closed before Isabella's expression turned glacial.

"Quite the design prodigy, aren't you?" She stared straight ahead, her tone laced with implication. "But business is an entirely different beast."

"Feel free to consult me—I just earned my MBA from Harvard."

Evelyn watched the blurring scenery outside, offering only a noncommittal hum.

This wasn't concern—it was a power play.

Having lost the design battle, Isabella was flaunting academic credentials instead.

Harvard MBA?

Evelyn recalled the institution's massive accreditation scandal three years prior. With Isabella's mediocre intellect, that degree undoubtedly came courtesy of family connections.

Her silence only stoked Isabella's simmering irritation.

"Father already entrusted me with KL's operations. The Colorado Mines development is my project now."

Colorado Mines?

Evelyn's eyes sharpened.

Before taking over CH Jewelry, she'd meticulously analyzed mineral distributions. Those eastern deposits were nearly exhausted, with recent seismic activity making them accident-prone. Any investment there would hemorrhage money.

Despite everything, she offered a warning: "That's a poor investment choice."

Isabella's derisive snort filled the car.

"I secured that land at a bargain through sheer effort." Her grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Amateurs shouldn't lecture professionals about commerce."

As the car halted before Stanford University's gates, Evelyn exited without a backward glance.
###Chapter 114

The warning had been given. If Isabella Langley refused to heed it, Evelyn Roland could do nothing more.

Watching Evelyn's retreating figure, Isabella smirked and dialed a number. "Keep eyes on her 24/7. Report even how many sips of water she takes."

Sunlight dappled the campus pathways as Evelyn walked toward the administration office, her steps light over the shifting shadows of leaves.

At the corner, a figure suddenly collided with her. The overpowering scent of cologne assaulted her senses.

Nathan Evans' revolting face loomed before her.

"Evelyn, it's over between Victoria and me," he said with feigned tenderness. "Give me a chance. I'll treat you twice as well."

Her lips curled in disdain. "Since when does trash from the Evans family deserve anything?"

Nathan's expression darkened, but he forced a smile. "Don't be ungrateful. Think about your peasant parents tilling the soil, and that mentally disabled brother of yours—"

A sharp crack cut him off.

His wrist snapped backward in Evelyn's grip, followed by a pig-like squeal of pain.

Stumbling back, Nathan crashed into the bushes, drawing raucous laughter from onlookers.

"Professor, this stalker won't leave me alone," Evelyn said, eyes glistening as she turned to the department head.

Ten minutes later, campus security dragged Nathan out by the collar, permanently banning him from school grounds.

——

At the café, Dylan Orlando slid a document across the table. "Headquarters location is finalized. Just waiting on the blueprints and gemstone shipments."

He lowered his voice. "What about Valdemar Group? Should we—"

"No need." Evelyn stirred her coffee. "Price war. For the first wave of clients, we'll take the loss."

Outside the window, a man in a baseball cap discreetly pressed his camera shutter.
###Chapter 115

Isabella Langley was painting her nails at the vanity when the private investigator handed her a stack of photos.

Nathan Evans stood outside Evelyn Roland's dormitory, clutching roses with a nauseatingly fervent gaze.

"The Evans family?" Her lips curled in disdain.

This second-rate family from A-list society circles was a perfect match for that illegitimate brat.

She picked up her phone and texted her mother: Mom, I want to throw a birthday party.

At dinner, Isabella dutifully served Sophia Roland.

"Mom, I'd like to invite some colleagues and friends this year." She batted her eyelashes. "It's my first birthday since joining KL Design Group."

Sophia beamed. "Of course we'll host it! I'll book the best ballroom at The Ritz-Carlton."

Alexander Roland opened his mouth to protest, but a glare from Edward silenced him.

"Evelyn, you'll come too?" Isabella turned to her stepsister with honeyed sweetness.

Evelyn set down her chopsticks with a faint nod.

"I'll attend as a regular classmate."

She refused to publicly acknowledge the Rolands.

——

Theodore Ashcroft stood at the office door of Valdemar Galleria's penthouse, holding an embossed invitation.

"Mr. Valdemar, an invitation to Miss Langley's birthday gala."

Sebastian Valdemar didn't look up. "Trash it."

His attention remained fixed on the design draft Evelyn had just submitted. The woman never failed to surprise him—like this celestial gown design that captivated his gaze.

Eight more to go. His eyes narrowed.

——

At the Evans mansion, Nathan spun around the living room waving his invitation.

"Dad! The Rolands invited me!" His voice cracked with excitement. "I told you Miss Langley likes me!"

His parents immediately began preparing a million-dollar jade necklace as their gift.

——

The Ritz-Carlton glittered on the evening of the gala.

Isabella stood at the entrance in a scarlet gown, her smile as precisely measured as a protractor.

In a shadowed corner, Evelyn swirled her champagne flute absently.

"Evelyn?" Hannah Clementson squeezed through the crowd. "What are you doing here?"

Before Evelyn could answer, she spotted Nathan approaching with a triumphant grin.

A cold foreboding slithered down her spine.
###Chapter 116

Evelyn Roland lifted her champagne flute, fingertips tracing the delicate rim. "After all, she's Mr. Roland's sister. I owe her for her kindness during my time at KL Design Group." Her tone was dismissive.

Adrienne Klein settled beside her, studying her former star employee with conflicted eyes. Since Evelyn's departure, KL's sales hadn't plummeted, but their new client acquisition rate had nosedived.

"Celadon," Adrienne began carefully, "have you considered coming back?"

Evelyn lowered her lashes, shadows dancing beneath them. Adrienne sighed. "Never mind. I won't press you."

Across the ballroom, Isabella Langley glided through the crowd on Alexander Roland's arm. The newly appointed head of domestic operations carried herself with effortless grace, her conversation sparkling.

"Thank you all for celebrating my birthday," Isabella said under the spotlight, voice trembling. "Most of all, I want to thank my parents..."

Hannah Clementson leaned toward Evelyn. "She's sweet to everyone, yet it feels like there's always this...barrier."

Below the stage, Sophia Roland dabbed at her tears while Edward Roland patted her back. Evelyn's chest tightened watching them. If Isabella truly cared about family, why had she made Evelyn's life hell?

Halfway through the gala, Isabella's gaze kept drifting toward Evelyn. She gave a subtle nod to a waiter.

Upstairs in the presidential suite, Nathan Evans paced like a caged animal. He'd nearly spilled his drink when Isabella's invitation arrived.

The door swung open. His face twisted in shock. "You?"

Evelyn tried the handle. Locked. A cold smile curved her lips as she strode toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Save your energy," Nathan sneered. "That's bulletproof glass."

Moonlight silvered Evelyn's profile as she turned. Her gaze sliced through him like a blade. "So you knew exactly what this trap was."

Nathan's bravado faltered under her stare. "Stop acting so—"

The crystal ashtray was in Evelyn's hand before he finished speaking.
###Chapter 117

Nathan Evans tilted his chin up, his eyes gleaming with smug confidence.

Ever since receiving the Roland family's invitation, his ego had inflated noticeably. Now he deliberately struck a pose—one hand in his pocket, leaning casually against the wall like some cliché CEO from a bad romance novel.

"Evelyn Roland, I've seen right through your little game."

"If you want to seduce me, just say so. Considering your passable looks, I might reluctantly take you in."

Evelyn responded with a cold laugh.

She strode to the bedside, grabbed the crystal table lamp, and delivered a precise strike to the back of Nathan's neck. The man groaned before collapsing like a sack of potatoes.

Grimacing, she yanked him up by his tie and dragged his unconscious body into the bathroom, shoving him unceremoniously inside.

Just as she shut the bathroom door, the electronic lock beeped.

Evelyn froze.

This wasn't right—if Isabella Langley had come to stage a "cheating scandal," she'd have brought an entourage for maximum drama. The silence was unnerving.

Beep—

The door swung open.

The muffled thud of military boots against plush carpet grew closer.

When that sharply chiseled face came into view, both of them stiffened in mutual shock.

"Sebastian Valdemar?"

"Evelyn Roland?"

His gaze dropped to the sliver of suit pants visible beneath the bathroom door. "You—"

"Later."

A commotion erupted downstairs—stomping footsteps and Isabella's theatrically shrill voice: "Is Mr. Evans really here? That anonymous tip said—"

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

Right on schedule.

But with Sebastian here, things just got infinitely more complicated.

In a split-second decision, she seized his tie and shoved him into the walk-in closet, squeezing in after him just as the door clicked shut.

In the cramped darkness, his scorching breath grazed her ear.

Sebastian crouched awkwardly, his long legs folded uncomfortably, the scent of jasmine from her hair flooding his senses. Something unspoken crackled in the air between them.

He'd pieced together the gist of this farce.

Half an hour ago, he'd wrapped up a cross-border conference call. Passing this floor, he'd heard a heavy thud—enough to make him order Theodore to unlock the suite with a master key.

He hadn't expected this.

"Oh my God! Mr. Evans collapsed!"

"Call an ambulance!"

Chaos erupted beyond the closet doors.

Isabella put on her best concerned act: "Don't call the police yet—get the hotel physician first." She clenched her teeth. This was supposed to be her triumphant "other woman" reveal—so where the hell was the female lead?

Useless Nathan!

Inside the closet, Evelyn's knee accidentally bumped against Sebastian's rock-hard abs. His muscles tensed instantly, his Adam's apple bobbing visibly.
###Chapter 118

Whispers of admiration filled the air as guests praised Isabella Langley's kindness and grace.

She ignored them all.

Her sharp gaze swept across every corner of the room like a hawk.

Inside the wardrobe, Sebastian Valdemar's breathing grew heavier.

Evelyn Roland could feel the rise and fall of his chest against her.

"Sebastian!" Her eyes widened in silent protest.

The man paid no attention, his focus locked on Isabella's approaching figure through the narrow gap.

"Miss Langley, Mr. Valdemar is looking for you."

Theodore Ashcroft's voice rang out like salvation.

Isabella paused mid-step, then turned on her heel without hesitation.

The wardrobe door burst open.

Evelyn stumbled out, only to be caught by Sebastian's steady grip.

"Thanks." She quickly pulled away.

He leisurely adjusted his wrinkled shirt, but his predatory gaze never left her.

Moonlit memories suddenly flashed before her eyes.

Those piercing eyes.

That crescent-shaped birthmark.

"I have matters to attend to." Sensing danger, Evelyn turned to leave.

Across the ballroom, Isabella clenched her fists in frustration.

"What's wrong, sweetheart?" Edward Roland asked with concern.

"Nothing." She forced a sweet smile.

Edward waved a hand magnanimously. "I'll buy you a new car."

"Thank you, Father." Isabella beamed, then glanced pointedly at Evelyn nearby. "Evelyn and I will always be the closest of sisters."

The corner of Evelyn's mouth curled into a cold smirk.

Closest sisters?

What a pathetic joke.
###Chapter 119

The sharp scent of antiseptic stung the air.

Nathan Evans struggled to open his eyes through muffled sobs, his blurred vision catching Mrs. Evans' swollen, red-rimmed eyes.

"Mom..." His voice came out hoarse.

Mrs. Evans jerked upright, tears spilling over. "Nathan! You're finally awake!"

Her trembling hand reached for his face but recoiled as if afraid to hurt him.

A dull throbbing pulsed at the back of his skull.

Nathan remembered Evelyn Roland's ice-cold expression before everything went black, his knuckles whitening from the memory.

"I'm fine." He forced a weak smile.

Mrs. Evans suddenly slammed her palm on the bedside table. "Who dares lay a finger on my son?"

Her meticulously maintained face twisted in fury, expensive silk scarf crumpling in her grip.

"Your father will handle this." Mr. Evans pulled out his phone, expression dark. "We'll investigate immediately."

The hospital door swung open.

The crisp click of heels echoed through the room.

Isabella Langley stood in the doorway holding a fruit basket, red lips curving. "Feeling better, Nathan?"

The Evans couple instantly switched to obsequious smiles.

"Miss Langley, you're too kind." Mr. Evans hurried forward. "You shouldn't have troubled yourself."

Isabella set the basket on the nightstand, her subtle perfume wafting through the air.

"Of course I'd come." She glanced down at Nathan. "After what happened at my birthday gala."

Nathan's breathing hitched.

This elegant, refined woman was worlds apart from that bitch who'd humiliated him.

"I heard..." Isabella lowered her voice. "It was over a woman?"

Mrs. Evans gasped.

"A man of your standing." Isabella traced the basket's satin ribbon. "No woman would refuse you."

She paused meaningfully. "Unless... the approach was wrong."

Fire burned in Nathan's eyes.

That slut had made a fool of him in public!

"I have a meeting." Isabella rose gracefully. "I'll visit again soon."

The Evanses practically tripped over themselves escorting her to the elevator.

The moment the door closed, Nathan smashed his fist into the nightstand.

The fruit basket toppled, sending crimson apples rolling across the floor.

###Chapter 120

"Miss Roland, we truly appreciate you taking the time to visit personally."

Mr. Evans trailed closely behind Evelyn Roland, persistently bringing up the collaboration proposal. Securing a partnership with the prestigious Roland family would undoubtedly elevate the Evans' social standing.

As their footsteps faded, Mrs. Evans returned to the hospital room, her brow furrowed. She couldn't comprehend why the Roland heiress would personally visit Nathan.

"Mom!"

The sudden shout from the hospital bed startled her. She glared at her son. "Must you be so dramatic?"

Nathan's eyes sparkled with excitement. "I get it now! Isabella must have feelings for me. That's why she came to see me. Someone as proud as her wouldn't confess directly."

"Are you sure?"

Though skeptical, Nathan grew more convinced. A smug smile spread across his face.

Initially, he'd pursued Evelyn only because she was Celadon. But Isabella was the real deal—a genuine Roland heiress, far more worthy of his efforts.

"Just wait, Isabella!" Nathan vowed silently, already plotting his next move.

A sharp pain shot through his head. He grimaced, his expression darkening. "Evelyn Roland, once I win Isabella over, we'll see who's laughing then."

"Celadon? Just some nobody designer. Against the Rolands, you're nothing."

He could already picture Evelyn begging for mercy. During his recovery, he instructed his mother to prepare gifts for his grand romantic gesture.

Three days later, in the KL Design Group CEO's office...

Alexander Roland's slender fingers tapped the desk as he studied the design sketches. He picked up his phone and dialed his sister.

"I'm working on my designs. What is it?" Evelyn's voice came through.

"The new collection's blueprints feel incomplete. Could you come take a look?"

Alexander got straight to the point. He knew Evelyn was busy with her graduation project.

Evelyn glanced at her half-finished sketches. "Fine. I'll head over now."

"I'll have Benjamin meet you downstairs."

After hanging up, Evelyn packed her tools and rushed out. The journey from Stanford to KL Design spanned half the city.

When she arrived, a crowd had gathered outside KL Tower. Instinctively, she tensed—until a familiar voice pierced through the noise:

"Isabella, I love you! Be my girlfriend!"

Nathan's public declaration echoed clearly. Frozen in place, Evelyn found her feet moving toward the commotion against her will.
###Chapter 121

Evelyn Roland had just stepped into KL Design Group when a commotion caught her attention.

At the center of the crowd, Nathan Evans knelt on one knee, holding a bouquet of roses, his face filled with exaggerated devotion. Opposite him stood Isabella Langley, her flawless makeup unable to mask her ashen expression.

"Isabella, from the moment we first met—"

"Shut up!" Isabella snapped, her nails digging into her palms.

This was supposed to be her carefully orchestrated scheme to humiliate Evelyn in public. Instead, this idiot Nathan had turned the tables on her.

Whispers rippled through the crowd. Forcing a strained smile, Isabella hissed, "Nathan, you've mistaken me for someone else."

"No!" He lunged forward desperately. "Those were all misunderstandings—you're the only one in my heart!"

Isabella stumbled back, nearly twisting her ankle in her heels. Then she spotted Evelyn at the edge of the crowd—the mocking smirk on her lips made Isabella's blood run cold.

"Nathan Evans!" She finally shed her facade. "Security! Drag this lunatic out!"

Gasps erupted. The usually demure Langley heiress now looked like a spitting, feral cat.

Two guards rushed forward to restrain Nathan. He thrashed. "Isabella, how could you? We were—"

"Silence!" She snatched the roses from his hands and smashed them to the ground. "You think you're worthy of me?"

As petals scattered, she leaned in and whispered a single venomous word only he could hear: "Pathetic."

The guards promptly gagged him and hauled him away. The crowd parted like the Red Sea, watching the spectacle's lead actor get tossed out the doors.

Evelyn turned to leave—until a sickeningly sweet voice called out: "Evelyn, darling~"

Isabella scurried over, linking arms with her, all traces of hysteria erased. "You should've told me you were coming!"

Her smile was flawless again, as if the shrieking harpy from moments ago had never existed.
###Chapter 122

Evelyn Roland subtly sidestepped, her long lashes casting delicate shadows beneath her eyes.

"My apologies for you witnessing such a scene."

"There's truly nothing between us. If you still have feelings for him—"

"When he was hospitalized after my birthday gala, I only visited out of courtesy. I never expected him to misinterpret it."

Isabella Langley deliberately raised her voice, ensuring every passing employee could hear. She needed to salvage her dignity and shift the blame for this farce entirely onto Nathan Evans.

The onlookers exchanged knowing glances, quickly offering their sympathy.

"Don't take it to heart, Manager Langley. That kind of delusional man is revolting."

"We'll stop him for you next time!"

"Thank you, everyone." Isabella smiled demurely. "Please return to your work."

As the crowd dispersed, Evelyn seized the moment to leave.

"Evelyn, are you going to see Alexander?"

"Hmm." Her response was curt. Spotting Alexander's assistant, she hurried forward.

"Benjamin, let's go."

The assistant glanced at Isabella behind her and nodded silently.

The elevator doors closed, and Isabella's smile twisted into something venomous.

"Just you wait, Evelyn Roland." Her fists clenched, nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

In the office, Alexander Roland retrieved design blueprints from the safe.

"KL's new collection. Take a look."

Evelyn accepted the sketches, her fingertips tracing the paper thoughtfully.

"The proportions here could be adjusted to better accentuate the wearer's elegance."

"This design is too conservative. It needs a more avant-garde approach."

Her critiques were precise and methodical. Alexander's eyes lit up with admiration.

"Truly worthy of the Celadon title." His praise was genuine. "These suggestions are impeccable."
###Chapter 123

Alexander Roland gazed at his long-lost sister with admiration shimmering in his eyes. He hadn't expected Evelyn Roland to possess such unique insights in design.

His slender fingers rolled up the blueprint as he casually poured her a glass of warm water.

"The design team will revise according to your suggestions." A faint smile touched Alexander's lips. "How's Stanford treating you?"

"It's fine." Evelyn accepted the glass, her fingertips absently tracing its rim.

His brotherly concern still felt unfamiliar. The glass clinked sharply against the table as she set it down abruptly.

"Don't touch that mining project in Colorado." Her gaze locked with his. "I can't explain why now, but steer clear of it."

She knew Isabella Langley was overseeing that venture. Since reasoning with Isabella proved futile, cutting it off at the source was the only solution.

Alexander's brow furrowed slightly, yet he nodded without hesitation. "Understood. I'll inform Isabella immediately."

"I should return to campus." Evelyn rose, still unaccustomed to familial interactions.

"I'll have the driver—"

"Unnecessary." Her eyes flicked to the stack of pending revisions. "You've got enough to handle."

After seeing his sister out, Alexander promptly issued Isabella's suspension notice.

Meanwhile, Isabella was trashing her office in a rage. The notification made her tremble violently, nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

"Since when does he take orders from her?" She ground her teeth. "This project will happen—no matter what!"

As night fell, the Roland dining room blazed with light.

Sophia Roland fretfully served her daughter. "Darling, about that Nathan Evans situation..."

"Just a misunderstanding, Mother." Isabella's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "I visited him at the hospital, and he assumed..."

Her trailing words twisted Sophia's heart.

"Leave it to me." Sophia patted her daughter's hand reassuringly.

"Thank you, Mother." Isabella bowed her head over her plate, silken hair veiling her contorted expression.
###Chapter 124

"My father treated me well, but his kindness always felt... off."

"Ever since I came of age, the way he looked at me grew stranger."

"Fortunately, his health declined with age. After falling gravely ill, he became bedridden."

"And my elder brother, the Crown Prince..."

"To secure his throne, he betrothed me to that sixty-year-old general from Lancang."

"If I refuse to return for the wedding, they'll torment my mother."

"This trip to the Empire was my last desperate bargain—won only by threatening to take my own life."

"We're but strangers who crossed paths. Perhaps it's best we part ways here."

"You're from the imperial family, aren't you? A pity... even you can't save me."

Henry Valdemar didn't rush to reveal his identity. With a faint smile, he asked, "I take it you despise this elderly general?"

Alina Kalmien bit her lip and nodded. "Who could love a man one foot in the grave?"

"To my brother, I'm just another pawn to strengthen his reign."

Henry leisurely fastened his robe. "It's not hopeless yet."

"You're fortunate to have met me."

"From this day forward, you needn't worry about such troubles."

"Become mine, and I'll ensure no harm befalls you."

Alina gave a bitter laugh. Even if he were royalty, he couldn't overturn a royal marriage between nations.

For now, she only wished to cherish her remaining days in the Empire.

"I must return. The envoy will be searching for me."

"Tonight... I'll find a way to slip away."

"There are still so many places in the capital I haven't seen. I want to spend what time I have left... with you."

She dressed hastily and left before Henry could stop her.

Watching her retreating figure, Henry's lips curved slightly.

Though court had been suspended today, he should return to the palace soon—lest his grandfather worry.

......

Clutching the returned deposit, Alina hurried toward Westminster Abbey.

She'd prepared excuses for Marco Lombardi, unaware the entire envoy now languished in prison.

Henry knew little of the Khmer Empire.

This kingdom, called Angkor by its people, was known elsewhere as the Khmer Empire.

Though well-read, his knowledge came only from Ministry of Rites reports.

He immediately summoned Minister Xavier Valence.

"Your Highness." The minister bowed.

"At ease. Be seated."

Once settled, Henry cut to the chase. "Update me on the Khmer Empire's situation."

Xavier pondered briefly. "Since establishing relations in the sixth year of Hongwu, we've maintained peaceful ties."

"This year marks their tribute cycle. Their envoy currently resides in the capital."

"The delegation includes a princess—a striking beauty of mixed heritage..."

The minister stole a glance at the prince, wondering if he'd taken interest in the princess.

Little did he know Henry had already claimed the Khmer princess the night before.

"How fares their nation now?"

As Xavier elaborated, Henry grasped the situation.

The once-mighty Angkor, after six centuries, now teetered on collapse.

That their Crown Prince relied on marriage alliances revealed how far the empire had fallen.

......

Alina stood panic-stricken before Westminster Abbey.

Inquiries revealed Marco had been arrested by the Embroidered Uniform Guard—that dreaded agency few entered alive.

In desperation, she remembered Henry.

"If he's imperial family, perhaps he can help..."

Yet she knew nothing about him beyond his surname.

At nightfall, Simon Roland appeared outside the abbey.

"Princess Alina, Lord Henry requests your presence."

Eagerly, she followed him to The Savoy.

Pushing open the private chamber door, she met Henry's amused gaze.

Alina threw herself into his arms. "My lord, do you have connections with the Embroidered Uniform Guard?"

"They've arrested my entire envoy!"

"How dare they detain diplomats without cause!"

Henry arched a brow at Simon.

"My apologies, Your Highness!" Simon hastily explained. "Last night the Khmer envoys caused a disturbance at the Moulin Rouge, so we—"
###Chapter 125

The surveillance footage spread like wildfire across the internet. Though swiftly deleted, the damage was already done.

"Shut down all dissemination channels immediately!"

The project manager of the Colorado Mines slammed his fist on the conference table, veins bulging on his forehead. His bloodshot eyes darted around the room like a caged beast.

The meeting room fell dead silent, save for the sound of ragged breathing.

"What are you all standing around for?" He whirled around, his voice sharp. "If this blows up, none of us will get out unscathed!"

After he stormed out, the remaining staff exchanged uneasy glances before reluctantly returning to work.

Three days later, the public outcry finally died down. Isabella Langley stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her fingers tracing the KL Design Group logo.

"Evelyn Roland... again." Her grip tightened around the coffee cup until it shattered in her hand.

Shards of glass reflected her contorted expression.

"Just wait until I secure this project. We'll see who has the last laugh."

She grabbed her coat and headed straight for the Colorado Mines site. For three consecutive days, she personally supervised operations, pushing progress at an unprecedented pace.

Meanwhile, Dylan Orlando idly scrolled through the Aether Forum.

"Fatal accident at KL construction site?" He bolted upright, fingers flying across the screen.

The post contained horrifying images—a ramshackle worker’s shed, smeared bloodstains, and stretchers draped with white sheets.

"How could this happen at the company owned by Evelyn's brother...?"

He immediately screenshotted the post and sent it to Evelyn, then dialed her number.

"Check your messages!" he blurted the moment she picked up.

Evelyn opened the image, her pupils contracting sharply.

"So something did happen at Colorado Mines." Her voice was taut. "Isabella has truly lost her mind."

"Should we intervene?" Dylan pressed.

Evelyn didn’t answer right away. She reopened the forum, carefully reading the plea post signed by "Tyler Macmillan." It detailed the accident and multiple failed attempts to seek justice.

"This reeks of Isabella’s handiwork." She let out a cold laugh and shut her laptop.

The rustling of sycamore leaves filled the campus air as Evelyn quickened her pace toward the gates. Before things escalated further, she needed to confront KL directly.
###Chapter 126

Sunlight streamed through the carved window lattice, casting intricate patterns across the hall. Evelyn Roland squinted slightly—the scene felt eerily familiar. Half a year ago, she'd stood in this very spot after catching Vincent Lowell with Isabella Langley.

In her past life, she'd despised these aristocratic dramas. Now, she was the unwilling protagonist.

According to the original plot, she should've been the adored wife. But the author's last-minute revisions had turned her into a doormat.

"My dear, such theatrics are unbecoming," the Dowager murmured, stroking her teacup like one might soothe a child. "Vincent merely attended business at the Moulin Rouge. Must you overreact?"

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud. With three sentences, the old vixen had reframed her divorce as petty jealousy.

"Your memory fails you, madam." She stifled a theatrical yawn. "The Emperor himself sanctioned my divorce. Are you questioning imperial decree?"

The porcelain trembled in the Dowager's grip. Evelyn noted the whitened knuckles clutching the armrest.

"Outrageous!" Vincent slammed the table. "How dare you disrespect Mother!"

Evelyn eyed this mama's boy. In the original story, she'd mistaken his obedience for virtue. What blindness.

"Such filial piety! Why not adopt every widow in the capital?" Her lips curled. "It's clearly your specialty."

Vincent's face purpled like a strangled rooster.

The Dowager massaged her temples. "Men taking concubines is natural. Vincent waited three years to bring Isabella home—that was consideration."

The gaslighting was textbook. Her former CEO had used identical tactics—blame the employee, never the company.

"Quite right." Evelyn nodded sweetly. "So I graciously stepped aside. How very... accommodating of me."

The Dowager's eyes gleamed. Vincent jutted his chin. "Beg the Emperor's pardon, and I'll forgive this folly."

"Perjury?" Evelyn clutched imaginary pearls. "How thoughtful—inheriting my dowry requires my execution first."

The Dowager's sleeve twitched. Bullseye.

Perfumed air announced Isabella's entrance. "Please don't blame Sister!" She fluttered in, tear-stained. "This is all my fault—"

Evelyn smirked. The scripted lines, the dramatic timing—what a consummate White Lotus.
###Chapter 127

The sky darkened ominously, the clouds hanging oppressively low. Evelyn Roland gripped the steering wheel, flooring the accelerator as she sped toward the eastern suburbs.

Raindrops began pelting the windshield.

"Isabella, what are you trying to do...?" She bit her lower lip, her fingers turning white. She couldn't risk alarming her parents—she had to handle this alone.

The rain intensified suddenly, the wipers struggling uselessly against the torrential downpour. Two blinding headlights flashed in the rearview mirror.

Two black sedans closed in like phantoms.

"Here they come." Evelyn smirked coldly and slammed the gas pedal. The car skidded on the slick pavement, but she steadied it with sheer force.

BAM!

The first impact came without warning. The airbag deployed, slamming her forehead against the wheel. The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth.

"You want me dead? Not that easy!"

She jerked the steering wheel hard. Tires screeched against the wet road as she executed a sharp drift. The pursuing car swerved too late, crashing into the guardrail.

But her own vehicle had reached its limit.

The engine gave one final groan before dying completely. Evelyn staggered out, instantly drenched by the rain.

Headlights pierced through the downpour in the distance.

"Sir, it's Miss Roland," Theodore Ashcroft said in surprise.

Sebastian Valdemar lifted his gaze to the slender figure in the rain. Soaked to the bone, her hair clung to her pale face, yet her spine remained defiantly straight.

"Stop the car."

When the door opened, Evelyn's pupils constricted slightly.

"Mr. Valdemar?" She wiped rainwater from her face. "What a coincidence."

His eyes flicked to the wreck behind her. "What kind of performance is this, Miss Roland?"

"Car trouble." She spread her hands. "Mind giving me a ride?"

He stepped closer abruptly, his icy aura pressing in. "You'd risk your life for the Colorado Mines project? What's your real connection to the Rolands?"

Raindrops traced the sharp line of his jaw.

Her heartbeat stuttered, but she lifted her chin. "Alexander Roland saved my life. That's all."

"Is that so?" His eyes narrowed.

"What else would it be?" She met his gaze head-on, a faint smile playing on her lips. "What do you suspect, Mr. Valdemar?"

The rain softened, but the tension between them crackled like live wires.
###Chapter 128

Sebastian Valdemar took a step back and turned toward the black sedan parked by the roadside.

"Get in."

Evelyn Roland gave a slight nod and quickly followed. The Rolls-Royce's engine rumbled low before vanishing into the night.

Meanwhile, inside the abandoned factory.

Two men in black clutched their heads as they staggered to their feet. Their faces paled at the sight of the empty warehouse.

"We're done for..." One of them trembled as he dialed a number.

Isabella Langley's shrill scream erupted from the other end. "What? She got away? You useless idiots!"

"Boss, please calm down! We'll head to the Colorado Mines right now to intercept her!"

Isabella hung up, standing before the floor-to-ceiling windows with a cold smirk. Lightning flashed outside, illuminating her twisted expression.

"Do you really think you can escape? That mine will be your grave."

At the Colorado Mines.

Raindrops began to fall as Evelyn finally located the chief engineer, Hugo Flores.

"Hugo, I need the truth about the mining disaster."

Hugo's face drained of color. He spun on his heel to leave.

Thud!

A heavy fist suddenly struck his face. Theodore Ashcroft appeared behind him, leisurely rolling up his sleeves.

Sebastian stood in the rain, his gaze icy.

"I'll talk!" Hugo collapsed to the ground, rainwater mixing with blood on his face. "It was all Isabella's doing! She forced us to cover up the accident to hide the truth..."

Evelyn clenched her fists. The rain intensified.

In the distance, tires screeched.
###Chapter 129

The rain fell in sheets as Sebastian Valdemar's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the metal scaffolding. The sharp clang of metal blended eerily with the downpour.

"The Rolands certainly trained their attack dog well." A smirk played at the corners of his lips. "Even dirty work like live burials doesn't faze you."

The foreman cowered in the corner, his overalls caked with mud. "Please...my daughter just started kindergarten..."

Evelyn Roland shook rainwater from her hair, the glow of her phone screen casting sharp shadows across her profile. The mine coordinates pulsed on her navigation map like the glowing eyes of a predator.

"Open it." Her quiet command sent the foreman scrambling for his keys.

Sebastian suddenly gripped her wrist mid-dial. Shadows shifted among the distant trees as five black-clad figures advanced in formation. The lead operative carried a black box emitting a steady red pulse.

"Professional-grade signal jammer." He whistled low. "Your sister's pulling out all the stops."

Evelyn drew a dagger from her boot. Raindrops slid down the blade, leaving dark stains in the mud.

"Vehicle at southeast corner." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Key's tucked behind the left front wheel."

Instead, Sebastian unbuttoned his suit jacket, revealing a Beretta 92F at his waist. "What a coincidence. I brought toys too."

Isabella Langley's shrill voice crackled through the phone: "Dispose of that bastard along with her!"

As the operatives drew their weapons, Sebastian kicked over the scaffolding. The collapsing metal canopy sent up a curtain of spray—just as Evelyn's blade buried itself in the nearest attacker's shoulder.

Gunfire merged with thunderclaps. The foreman screamed, covering his head—only to watch Sebastian eject a magazine one-handed and smash the second assailant's jaw with the pistol grip.

"Keep one alive!" Evelyn spun to disarm a third attacker, only to have the fourth lock an arm around her throat. Sebastian's bullet pierced the man's wrist precisely, spraying blood across her pale neck.

The final operative turned to flee—and was sent flying by a sudden lurch of heavy machinery. Miners poured from the bulldozer's cab, wielding shovels like weapons.

"Director Roland!" A coal-dusted worker shouted. "We broke through the backup tunnel!"

Sebastian retrieved the still-active phone. Isabella's breathing turned ragged through the receiver.

"The game's just beginning." His chuckle was velvet over steel. "Pick out a nice gravesite for yourself."

Through the rain, Evelyn watched the groaning operatives, slowly wiping blood from her cheek. Distant sirens wove with the miners' angry shouts—a long-delayed reckoning approaching.
###Chapter 130

The rain poured down as six figures in black advanced with switchblades glinting.

Sebastian Valdemar shielded Evelyn Roland behind him, his gaze sharp as steel.

"Signal jammer?" Evelyn's eyes flicked to the device in the leader's hand. A cold smirk curved her lips. "Well prepared, I see."

Before the words faded, she launched forward. A spinning kick sent the nearest assailant crashing to the ground.

Sebastian's eyes gleamed with approval.

"Careful," he murmured. "Don't overdo it."

The corner of his mouth lifted as he twisted, wrenching a blade from an attacker's grip. Silver flashed through the rain.

A scream pierced the air. Blood mingled with rainwater.

The black-clad figures faltered.

"Move!" their leader roared. "No payment until the job's done!"

The assault intensified.

Evelyn's peripheral vision caught movement toward the equipment shed.

"Damn it!" She lunged—just as Sebastian's warning shout reached her.

A blur of motion. He intercepted the descending blade meant for her.

Crimson dripped from his forearm.

"Go!" Evelyn grabbed his uninjured arm, dragging him toward the mine shaft.

Flashlight beams stabbed the darkness as pursuers reached the entrance.

"Seal it!" The leader's laughter turned vicious. "Let them rot underground!"

Damp chill enveloped them in the tunnel.

Evelyn supported Sebastian's weight as they staggered forward.

"Sebastian?" Her voice held the barest tremor.

"Worried about me?" His chuckle came labored.

"Shut up." Her teeth clenched. "If you die here, Valdemar Group's stocks will crash."

A dim platform emerged ahead.

"Rest." She guided him onto the miners' bench.

Faint light revealed the gash through his sleeve. Blood welled steadily.

"This will hurt." She ripped her own sleeve, binding the wound with brutal efficiency.

Sebastian hissed, sweat beading his forehead.

"Why save me?" The question escaped before she could stop it.

In the darkness, his eyes burned like live coals.

"What do you think?"

###Chapter  131

The mine shaft was damp and cold. Sebastian Valdemar leaned against the rocky wall, his labored breaths echoing in the silence.

"You even know about mines?" His voice was low. "Seems I've underestimated you."

Evelyn Roland didn't respond. She turned and lit a few still-functional oil lamps. The dim glow pushed back the darkness, revealing the glint of a dagger embedded in his arm.

Blood had soaked through half his sleeve.

"Don't move." She pressed her fingers against his wrist, feeling the sticky warmth.

Sebastian smirked. "Not dying yet."

Evelyn frowned. In these conditions, infection was deadlier than blood loss.

She swiftly built a fire and sterilized a torn strip of cloth. The flames cast shadows over his clenched jaw.

"Brace yourself."

Before he could react, she yanked the blade free. Sebastian's muscles locked, his Adam's apple bobbing, but not a sound escaped him.

"Screaming helps."

Only ragged breathing answered her.

As she bandaged the wound, she added a layer of chalcedony powder. Sebastian paled, his voice weak. "My sister was right. You do know medicine."

The air grew thinner. Evelyn stood to investigate, fingertips brushing against a faint draft.

When she returned, Sebastian was in trouble.

His skin burned feverishly, his body convulsing. This wasn't ordinary illness—it was an old poison flaring up.

"Sebastian!" She pinned his thrashing arm. "Look at me!"

His eyes remained shut, his entire frame curled tight like a wounded beast. Cold sweat traced the sharp angles of his face, dripping onto Evelyn's hand.

It was worse than she'd thought.
###Chapter 132

"Pain..."

A low groan escaped Sebastian Valdemar's throat.

He had always endured suffering silently. Moments ago during the bone-scraping detoxification, he hadn't even flinched. Now he curled into himself, knuckles turning white.

Evelyn Roland stared at the veins bulging along his neck, her heart trembling.

This poison was terrifyingly potent.

To reduce such an iron-willed man to this state—she'd never witnessed such a vicious toxin before.

The blade glinted coldly in the firelight.

Without hesitation, she sliced open her own wrist.

As the first drop of blood fell, Sebastian's eyes flew open. Those crimson orbs locked onto her like a predator sighting prey.

"Drink." She pressed her wrist to his lips.

His fingers clamped around her arm with bruising force. As the warm liquid slid down his throat, the bloodlust gradually faded from his gaze.

This was her deepest secret.

At six years old, she'd discovered her blood could alleviate pain. Charles Lowell had rushed her to a martial arts school that very night, gripping her shoulders fiercely before leaving: "Take this secret to your grave."

Now for him, she'd broken that vow.

Sebastian's breathing steadied. Evelyn quickly bandaged her wound, the fabric darkening with blood.

"I'll get you out."

As she turned, she missed how his pupils contracted violently.

Rainwater had washed away the concealer on her waist.

The crescent birthmark shone clearly.

Sebastian's fingers trembled. That exact mark—he'd seen it on a woman's waist seven years ago during a rainstorm.

She'd been right under his nose all along.

His lips curved soundlessly.

A draft whispered through the mine shaft.

Evelyn counted her steps. At four hundred paces, her fingers brushed against a narrow crevice.

"Anyone there?" She knocked on the rock wall.

Frantic shouts answered from the other side: "Help! We're trapped!"

"Are you rescuers?"

Evelyn pressed against the gap. "Hold on! I'll get you out!"

Cheers erupted beyond the wall. As she prepared to respond, scorching heat suddenly pressed against her back.

Sebastian's breath ghosted over her ear: "Found you, little liar."
###Chapter 133

The cheers echoing through the mine shaft pierced Evelyn Roland's eardrums like needles.

Her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

"We're saved!"
"Finally going home!"

The workers' excited voices bounced off the narrow tunnel walls.

Evelyn's throat tightened.

How could she tell them the truth?

That those flashing police lights outside weren't for rescue—but to seal their fate?

That she was just as trapped as they were?

"I..."

She took a deep breath.

"Help is coming, but the passage is too narrow for equipment."

"Conserve your energy. We'll get out soon."

Muffled sobs rose from the darkness.

"Thank God...my daughter's waiting for me..."
"My wife's seven months pregnant. I can't die here..."

Evelyn bit her lower lip.

In desperate times, hope was more precious than oxygen.

"Stay put. Save your strength."

She grabbed a sharp rock and began sketching rapidly on the tunnel wall.

From the sounds, the trapped workers were in the adjacent shaft.

Mentally mapping the mine's layout based on her own path, she pinpointed their location.

Her fingers brushed damp soil. She rubbed it thoughtfully between them.

"Here."

She pointed to a spot on the wall.

"This is our way out."

Her legs trembled with exhaustion, but she couldn't stop.

Five lives.
And Sebastian Valdemar.

All depending on her.

"You can't climb that alone."

A hoarse male voice spoke behind her.

Evelyn whirled around.

Sebastian leaned against the wall, his face ghostly pale.

"You're awake?"

She hadn't expected him to regain consciousness so quickly.

"Yeah." He stepped closer, studying her crude map. "That exit's at least ten feet up with no running start."

Evelyn knew that.

But they had no other options.

"Together."

"Your injuries—"

Sebastian gave a grim smile. "Not fatal."

They moved through the tunnel until they reached the narrow opening.

Without hesitation, Sebastian dropped to one knee.

"Up."

Evelyn hesitated, eyeing his shaking arms.

"Keep waiting and we all die here."

His tone brooked no argument.

Gritting her teeth, she stepped onto his shoulders.

Sebastian surged upward with a pained grunt, his body swaying dangerously.

She felt his muscles tremble beneath her.

No turning back now.

Scrambling upward, her fingertips finally caught the ledge.

A heavy thud sounded below.

"Sebastian!"

She clung to the edge, peering down into darkness.

Silence.

Outside, the storm lashed the mining site, washing away all traces of crime.

"Evelyn! Over here!"

Dylan Orlando's shout cut through the rain.

Unable to reach Evelyn, he'd mobilized a team to the mines.
###Chapter 134

Dylan Orlando's pupils constricted sharply when he saw Evelyn Roland covered in blood. His knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists, hissing through gritted teeth, "Those animals!"

Outside the mine, several shadowy figures were furtively cleaning up the scene. Spotting Evelyn's escape, they immediately closed in.

"Boss, is it them?" Dylan's eyes burned with fury.

Behind him, a dozen well-trained bodyguards assumed offensive stances.

"Leave them." Evelyn pressed a hand on Dylan's shoulder.

The black-clad men retreated hastily at the shift in dynamics.

"The storm will trigger another collapse." Evelyn wiped rainwater from her face. "Find the signal jammer first. Contact rescue teams."

She directed the group to the trapped miners' location, digging a small opening to drop a walkie-talkie and glucose packets inside.

"Stay on comms. Conserve energy," she shouted into the hole.

Dylan's men began excavating an escape tunnel.

Evelyn turned and sprinted back to her original exit point, leaping into the collapsed mine shaft without hesitation.

Sebastian Valdemar curled in the darkness, his body burning with fever. Though the toxin's effects were temporarily suppressed, infection from his high temperature was eroding his consciousness.

"Cold..." he murmured deliriously, clutching Evelyn like a lifeline.

In his haze, he relived the sunless dungeon—the whippings, starvation, endless dark. Doctors had said he wouldn't survive past twenty.

"Don't be afraid." Evelyn wrapped her coat around him.

Sebastian stilled abruptly, like a child who'd found sanctuary.

Meanwhile, Isabella Langley received a call from the shadows.

"She's alive?" Her coffee cup shattered on the floor, brown liquid splattering everywhere.

Forcing composure, she ordered, "Eliminate the foreman. Find a scapegoat. I'm coming now."

News of the mining disaster had spread. Isabella knew distancing herself from the incident before her parents was now critical.

Changing into work clothes, she rushed to the Colorado Mines. Under public scrutiny, she plunged into the collapsed shaft without hesitation...

Sirens from rescue teams wailed across the mining site.

At the Roland estate, phones rang incessantly.

"Both daughters are unreachable?" Sophia Roland paled as she hung up.

Breaking news footage showed rescue workers carrying stretchers from the ruined mine...
###Chapter 135

The rain poured down in torrents, hammering against the car roof with relentless fury.

Sophia Roland clutched her phone with white-knuckled intensity. Two red missed call notifications glared back at her—one to Isabella Langley, the other to Evelyn Roland.

"How could this happen..." Her voice trembled as tears welled in her eyes.

Edward Roland pulled his wife into a firm embrace, his palm soothing her shuddering back. "Don't panic. The girls will be fine."

"Alexander!" Edward's gaze sharpened like a blade. "I thought the Colorado Mines project was shut down months ago!"

Alexander Roland paled. "Dad, I followed Evelyn's instructions to halt operations. But Isabella—" His Adam's apple bobbed as words failed him.

Sophia surged to her feet, her soaked dress clinging to her legs. "I'm going to find them."

"Mom! It's a monsoon out there!"

"Enough!" She shoved past her son and snatched the car keys, bolting into the storm. The downpour swallowed her slender frame like a leaf in a gale.

The black Mercedes tore through the tempest, windshield wipers flailing wildly. Alexander's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles bloodless. The rearview mirror reflected his mother's ghostly face.

At the mine entrance, emergency lights pulsed through the rain like a distress beacon.

"Move! My daughters are in there!" Sophia stumbled toward the police line, mud splattering her designer heels.

The rescue captain blocked her path. "Ma'am, the site's unstable—"

"Dangerous? What about my girls?" Her voice cracked as rainwater streamed down her chin.

A mechanical roar echoed as the first group of trapped workers emerged on stretchers. One young miner's arm bent at a grotesque angle, his coveralls saturated with blood.

Sophia's knees buckled. Edward caught her just as her fingers twisted in his collar. "Edward, our babies—"

The captain removed his helmet. "We've detected two life signs in separate sectors. We can only extract one at a time."

"No!" Sophia lunged, grabbing his rain slicker. "They're both my daughters!"

"Another collapse could happen any second." The captain's voice turned grave. "If we delay—"

The storm swallowed his warning. Alexander dropped to his knees in the mud. "Save Evelyn first! She's the most vulnerable!"

Sophia whipped her head around, raindrops clinging to her lashes. Her lips parted—but no sound came out.

A distant rumble shook the ground. A plume of dust erupted from the mine's depths.
###Chapter 136

The rain poured in torrents. The rescue team captain wiped water from his face, his voice hoarse. "Madam, the mine shafts could collapse again at any moment!"

Sophia Roland's fingers trembled as they clutched her dress hem.

"We must decide who to save now!" The captain stamped his foot. "Any delay will cost both their lives!"

Alexander Roland's suit was drenched. His Adam's apple bobbed as he stared at the two mine entrances.

"Sir!" Eugene Lefèvre rushed into the downpour. "Miss Isabella has always been frail. She only got trapped saving Miss Evelyn! By all rights, we should rescue her first!"

He deliberately stepped into a mud puddle, splashing filthy water onto Sophia's skirt.

"But Evelyn..." Sophia's voice was drowned by thunder.

Eugene pulled her toward the left shaft. "Look! Miss Isabella has already lost consciousness!"

Deep inside the mine, Isabella Langley lay curled like a broken doll in the muck. A lightning flash illuminated her deathly pale face, blood trickling from her lips.

"The rescue team says Miss Evelyn can still communicate!" Eugene whispered in Sophia's ear. "But Miss Isabella won't last thirty minutes!"

Sophia grabbed her husband's arm. "Save Isabella first! Hurry!"

As the rescue rope was secured, a deep rumble shook the mine. Pebbles rained down, making Eugene stumble backward.

"Faster!" Alexander stepped forward to pull the rope himself.

Through the storm, the rope inched upward. When they lifted Isabella out, her right leg bent at an unnatural angle.

"My child..." Sophia rushed forward, only to recoil from the metallic scent of blood.

"Careful, madam!" Eugene steadied her. "Miss Evelyn's side—"

The mountainside convulsed before he could finish. Before their eyes, the right shaft collapsed in a roar of dust instantly turned to mud by the rain.

Sophia's legs gave way. She collapsed into the mire, mouth forming a soundless whisper. "Ev..."

Edward Roland caught his wife's limp body. Rain mixed with tears as he lifted his face toward the ruined mine shaft. His fist slammed into the mud.
###Chapter 137

"Evelyn..."

Edward Roland's voice shattered in the torrential rain. He knelt in the mud, his expensive suit soaked through, fingers digging deep into the earth. Twenty years of searching had led to this devastating moment.

Alexander Roland slammed his fist into the ground, knuckles bleeding. "This is all my fault..." he muttered, rain mixing with his tears as they fell.

"Boss!"

Dylan Orlando's shout cut through the storm. He lunged toward the other side of the mine like a panther, where two figures swayed precariously on the edge.

Evelyn Roland was covered in blood but clung stubbornly to the unconscious Sebastian Valdemar. The moment she spotted Dylan, her lips twitched into a faint smile before she collapsed like a broken marionette.

"Breathing's steady." Dylan's trembling fingers pressed against her neck, relief flooding him. He wrapped his coat around her and lifted his gaze, eyes sharp as daggers.

Alexander reached out, only to have his hand violently slapped away.

"Perhaps the Third Young Master should tend to his precious adopted sister instead," Dylan spat, cradling Evelyn protectively. "Weren't you in such a hurry to save Isabella when the rescue team arrived?"

The Roland family paled under the downpour.

"Move." Dylan carried Evelyn forward, each step heavy with fury. "If anything happens to her, I'll bury the entire Roland family with her."

Edward gripped Alexander's arm to stop him. "Prioritize saving lives."

The wail of ambulances pierced the night. Dylan carefully laid Evelyn onto a stretcher, then glanced at Sebastian being loaded into another vehicle. The man's chest was stained with dark blood—likely from...

"We need blood transfusions, stat!" A nurse's urgent call snapped him back to reality.

The hospital corridor blazed with light.

Olivia Valdemar stumbled into the room, her pregnant belly making her unsteady. She nearly collapsed at the sight of her brother's ashen face. "Have you lost your mind?" Her trembling hand brushed his forehead. "You actually went into that death trap?"

Sebastian's lashes fluttered. His cracked lips parted. "Where... is she?"

"Who?" Olivia followed his gaze to the closed emergency room across the hall. Behind the glass, the heart monitor's weak beeps flickered like a fading pulse.
###Chapter 138

Olivia Valdemar's fingers clenched the hospital blanket, her knuckles turning white. She stared at her brother's pale face, her chest heaving with each breath.

"Don't look at me like that, sis." Sebastian Valdemar reached for her hand but winced as the movement pulled at his wound.

"You still feel pain?" Olivia's eyes reddened, her voice trembling. "If Mom and Dad find out you're hurt again—"

"It's just a scratch." He forced a weak smile. "The doctor said I'll recover in a few days."

Olivia abruptly stood, knocking over a nearby monitor with a loud clatter. "I'm getting answers from the doctor."

In the hallway, Theodore Ashcroft approached with a medical report. Olivia intercepted him. "What really happened?"

Theodore glanced toward the hospital room before lowering his voice. "Mr. Valdemar was inspecting the Colorado Mines with Miss Roland when the tunnel collapsed—"

"Her again?" Olivia's pupils constricted.

"Miss Roland carried him out herself," Theodore added. "She was injured too."

Olivia's fingers turned icy. First the car accident, now this. Evelyn Roland was like a jinx—yet always there when it mattered most.

"Which room is she in?"

"306, third floor." Before Theodore could finish, Olivia was already striding toward the elevator.

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled Room 306. Evelyn sat propped against the pillows, a faint bloodstain seeping through the bandage on her temple.

"Why take him somewhere so dangerous?" Olivia demanded without preamble.

Evelyn lifted her pallid face. "It was Isabella—"

"Sis!" Isabella Langley threw herself at the bedside, tears streaming. "I messed up the safety assessment!"

Sophia Roland immediately embraced her eldest daughter. "Isabella meant well. She wanted to expand the company's operations."

Alexander Roland frowned over the investigation report. "The tunnel was dilapidated. It was an accident."

"An accident?" Evelyn's laugh was bitter. She remembered clearly—three deaths in her past life, all because of—

"Enough!" Edward Roland slammed his hand on the table. "Evelyn, your sister has apologized."

Evelyn gripped the sheets. The wound beneath her bandage burned, but the chill in her heart was worse. She turned to her father. "I want to see the full report."

Outside the window, dusk deepened. Olivia stood in the doorway, watching it all unfold.
###Chapter 139

Alexander Roland's slender fingers tapped lightly on his phone screen as he displayed the police investigation report to Evelyn Roland.

"The surveillance footage confirms the contractor acted alone," he said in a low voice. "And the worker who killed him has already confessed."

With irrefutable evidence, the incident at the Colorado Mines was officially closed. Isabella Langley remained perfectly untouched.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. Those desperate moments in the mine, the terror of nearly losing her life—all brushed aside so casually.

"A project manager who doesn't even know what his subordinates are doing," she sneered. "The Valdemar Group's hiring standards are truly eye-opening."

Isabella's eyes instantly reddened as she lowered her head, twisting her fingers. But in the shadows, her nails bit deep into her flesh.

The air in the hospital room turned icy.

Sophia Roland quickly stepped forward, taking both daughters' hands. "Evelyn, Isabella went to the mines to look for you. She was worried too."

She gently stroked their hands. "I just want both of you safe."

Evelyn turned her face away, saying nothing more.

A sharp knock interrupted the tension.

When Sebastian Valdemar entered, he immediately sensed the strange atmosphere. His gaze swept past everyone and landed on Evelyn in the hospital bed.

"Mr. Valdemar," Alexander acknowledged with a slight nod.

Isabella's eyes brightened, her voice softening instantly. "Sebastian..."

She deliberately raised her bandaged arm, exposing more of her injuries. "I'm fine. It doesn't hurt..."

Sebastian paused mid-step.

Suddenly, he leaned down, his lips nearly brushing her ear. The intimate proximity made Isabella's heart race.

"That day in the mine," he whispered, so softly only she could hear, "were you trying to bury me alive too?"

Her pupils constricted violently.

Straightening, Sebastian watched with satisfaction as her face drained of color. When he turned toward the hospital bed, his expression was coolly detached once more.

"Miss Roland, how's your recovery?"

"Still breathing," Evelyn replied flatly.
###Chapter 140

Evelyn gave a slight nod and began conversing with Sebastian as if no one else was present. The Roland family's attention was entirely fixed on them, oblivious to Isabella's ashen face in the corner.

Isabella clenched the hem of her dress so tightly her nails nearly pierced her palms. She never imagined the man in the mines was Sebastian himself.

Fear crashed over her like a tidal wave. The memory of her actions in the mines sent cold sweat trickling down her spine.

"This is all Evelyn's fault!" she screamed internally, her venomous gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Sebastian suddenly spoke. "Miss Roland, may we speak privately?"

Sophia immediately stepped between them. "Absolutely not!"

Seeing Sebastian's raised brow, she hastily added, "Evelyn hasn't fully recovered yet."

"Whatever you have to say, say it here," Edward interjected, stepping forward.

Sebastian narrowed his eyes, scanning the Roland family. "You all seem unusually invested in a mere employee's affairs."

Evelyn's chest tightened. She pushed back the covers and stood. "I'm fine. This must be urgent, Mr. Valdemar?"

Sophia instinctively reached out to steady her—a gesture that darkened Sebastian's gaze further.

In the hallway, the overhead lights stretched their shadows long and thin.

"Thank you for saving my life," Evelyn broke the silence first.

Sebastian abruptly closed the distance, gripping her wrist. "That woman at the cabin was you."

Not a question. A statement.

Evelyn's breath hitched, but she forced composure. "Are you here to settle scores, Mr. Valdemar?"

"How bold of you," he sneered. "Vanishing without a trace after that night."

"You're not expecting me to take responsibility, are you?" Evelyn's lips curved, but her eyes remained cold.

Sebastian stiffened, his grip tightening unconsciously.

"Let go." She wrenched free. "I've long forgotten that night. You should do the same."

The air turned glacial.

Abruptly, Sebastian shifted tactics. "What did you give me when I was unconscious?"
###Chapter 141

Sebastian Valdemar's fingers absently traced the cufflink. Though his memories of the mine collapse remained hazy, the coppery tang of blood still lingered on his tongue.

It was the first time he'd remained conscious during a poisoning episode.

"Water from the mines?" His peach-blossom eyes narrowed like blades as they swept over Evelyn Roland's face.

Evelyn met his gaze calmly. "Don't believe me, Mr. Valdemar?"

The air thickened with unspoken tension.

Sebastian suddenly chuckled darkly, producing several coins from his suit pocket. The metallic clink echoed sharply in the stairwell.

"Returning what's yours."

Evelyn stared at the coins in her palm, her ears burning. Those impulsive "payment" tokens she'd left now served as damning evidence.

"Seems Ms. Roland isn't very professional either." His parting words made her nails dig into her flesh.

Olivia Valdemar's approaching footsteps broke the silence.

"What did you do to Evelyn this time?" The younger girl angrily grabbed her brother's sleeve.

Sebastian dragged his sister away without looking back. "The debt's been settled."

In the most unforgettable way.

Inside the hospital room, Isabella Langley's venomous glare instantly morphed into concern as the door opened. Edward Roland fretted over his daughter: "Did that Valdemar boy give you trouble?"

"Just expressing gratitude." Evelyn deliberately raised her voice. "If not for Mr. Valdemar's rescue on the Colorado Mines road, I wouldn't be here."

Sophia Roland paled. "Someone was on the road—"

The door burst open with a crash.

Dylan Orlando stormed in, radiating fury as he seized Evelyn's wrist. "Come with me."

His icy gaze swept over the Rolands. "You only sent one rescue team—and dare call that protection?"

Edward's pupils constricted.

Only then did Evelyn notice Isabella clutching the bedsheet, her knuckles bone-white.

"In the mines..." Sophia's voice trembled. "The rescuers could only save one..."
###Chapter 142

"Those two old fossils in the Roland family actually chose Isabella! They must be blind!"

The words stabbed into Evelyn's chest like a knife.

Her fingers clenched until her knuckles turned white.

"Don't say that. They're still our elders."

Dylan Orlando stomped his foot in frustration. "I can't swallow this injustice!"

His gaze softened as he looked at Evelyn. "Evelyn, the Rolands don't deserve your suffering."

Sophia Roland hastily grabbed her daughter's hand. "Sweetheart, it wasn't like that... It was Eugene—"

"It's all my fault!" Isabella suddenly threw herself off the hospital bed, kneeling before Evelyn.

Tears streamed down her face. "Blame me, little sister. I stole your place..."

Edward Roland quickly helped her up. "Isabella, don't do this. It's not your fault."

Dylan sneered. "Stop pretending! If it weren't for you—"

"Enough!" Evelyn's sharp voice cut through the room.

Alexander Roland frowned. "Sir, mind your manners."

"Manners? You dare lecture me about manners?" Dylan laughed bitterly, his anger boiling over.

Tension crackled between them. When Dylan took a swing, Evelyn stepped between them.

"Stop it."

Her gaze shifted to her parents, her voice barely audible.

Twenty years of love couldn't compete with blood ties.

Isabella hid behind her father, a triumphant smirk playing on her lips.

Sophia sobbed uncontrollably. "Evelyn..."

"I want to move out for a while," Evelyn said abruptly.

Isabella immediately interjected. "Little sister, you can't leave over something so trivial—"

"Trivial?" Evelyn's calm eyes locked onto hers. "You never raised me for a single day."

She turned toward the door. "I need time."

Her mother's weeping followed her, but she didn't look back.

In that moment, she finally understood—blood might be thicker than water, but time together ran deeper.
###Chapter 143

Evelyn Roland tucked the medical records into her bag and strode out of the hospital without a backward glance. Dylan Orlando hurried after her, opening the car door for her.

"Boss, the riverside penthouse you requested is ready," Dylan said, gripping the steering wheel. "It's in the heart of the CBD with top-tier security."

"Take me to the office." Evelyn closed her eyes. "I'll stay in the lounge until the new collection launch."

The shadows of plane trees flickered past the window. Her fingers tapped lightly against the leather seat as she calculated the details of the upcoming spring collection.

"But the Roland family—"

"One more word," Evelyn opened her eyes, "and you’re running back to the office."

Dylan immediately sealed his lips with an imaginary zipper.

Three days later, the Roland estate blazed with lights.

Isabella Langley curled up on the sofa, scrolling through her phone. The termination notice from KL Design Group still lay on the coffee table. The mining disaster investigation had concluded, pinning all blame on the silenced foreman.

"The material shortage is critical," Alexander Roland loosened his tie. "We’re still forty percent short on pre-order deliveries."

Edward Roland twisted his jade ring. "Find a subcontractor."

"No domestic jewelry factory can handle such an urgent order," Alexander massaged his temples. "Unless—"

"CH." Edward narrowed his eyes. "They’ve just established headquarters here, but their overseas resources are extensive."

Isabella suddenly sat up. "Father, let me go." Her eyes glistened with unshed tears. "After what happened at KL, I owe it to the family."

"You were framed," Alexander patted her shoulder. "Very well. Handle the CH negotiations."

Isabella lowered her head to hide her smirk. She carefully selected a Chanel suit and spritzed on her most alluring perfume.

The CH lobby glittered under crystal chandeliers.

In the top-floor office, Evelyn finalized the last design sketches. The Valdemar Group order was nearly complete, and she couldn’t wait to sever ties.

"Boss!" Dylan waved the intercom. "A white lotus just showed up downstairs."

Evelyn didn’t look up. "You deal with it."

Dylan rubbed his hands gleefully as he answered the call.

"Hello, I’m Isabella Langley from KL," a saccharine voice cooed through the receiver. "I’d like to discuss a subcontracting partnership."

"KL?" Dylan pinched his nose. "The unethical company with that fatal accident?"

An awkward cough sounded on the other end.

"Here’s the deal," Dylan suppressed a laugh. "We have a company rule—all business negotiations require thirty laps around the lobby first."

Isabella’s knuckles whitened around the phone. But remembering her father’s expectations, she gritted her teeth and changed into spare sneakers.

In the surveillance room, Dylan slapped the desk laughing. The screens showed Isabella’s disheveled state, her carefully styled curls plastered to her sweaty face.

The elevator doors suddenly opened. Sebastian Valdemar stepped out just as Isabella collapsed like a drowned rat. Their eyes met as she frantically tried to smooth her ruined hair, only smearing her makeup further.
###Chapter 144

Isabella Langley called out to Sebastian Valdemar in a sugary voice, "Mr. Valdemar~ Do you know the person in charge of CH? Could you help me out, please~"

Sebastian didn't even glance at her as he stepped into the elevator.

He had come to CH under the pretense of collecting design drafts.

In truth, he wanted to see how Evelyn Roland was managing the company.

When he pushed open her office door, she had just set down her pen.

"The designs are finished. Would you like to review them, Mr. Valdemar?"

Sebastian skimmed the drawings before his gaze shifted to the window. "Your doing?"

Evelyn followed his line of sight. Isabella was jogging laps under the scorching sun.

"I don't have time for such pettiness."

She pressed the intercom. "Dylan, inform the receptionist to send her away. Tell the Langley family that if they want to discuss business, Alexander must come himself."

With KL's urgent order looming, only CH and Valdemar Group in the entire city could handle it.

Given the bad blood between the Langleys and Sebastian, CH was their only option.

But Evelyn refused to waste energy on a fool like Isabella.

Dylan Orlando reluctantly carried out the order.

Downstairs, Isabella beamed when she received the message.

She stared up at the glass facade of the top floor, her heart fluttering—Mr. Valdemar must have spoken up for her!

Perhaps he wasn't as indifferent as he seemed.

Sebastian tucked away the designs. "Not planning to let the Langleys know you intervened?"

"Unnecessary." Evelyn's tone was cool. "I trust you'll keep it to yourself as well."

"Naturally." He suddenly leaned in, closing the distance between them.

The crisp scent of sandalwood enveloped her. Evelyn instinctively recoiled.

"Is something wrong?"

His gaze darkened as he abruptly seized her wrist.

The scar from the mining tunnel was stark against her skin.

"Careless, Ms. Roland?"

She yanked her hand back, hiding it behind her. "Just a scrape from the ore. No concern of yours."

"This location..." He paused meaningfully. "Be more careful."

As he turned to leave, he dialed Theodore Ashcroft. "Look into cases where human blood was used as an analgesic."

"H-human blood?!"

"Did I stutter?"

Meanwhile, Alexander Roland sat in the conference room, his expression stormy.

Through the door, a voice distorted by a modulator spoke, "Those are our terms. Your thoughts, Mr. Roland?"

"Refusing to show your face—is this CH's idea of sincerity?"

"You're free to decline." The voice carried a hint of amusement. "But KL's penalty clause..."

Alexander's fists clenched.
###Chapter 145
The robotic voice on the phone made Alexander Roland's temple throb.

His knuckles turned white as he clenched the fountain pen.

KL Design Group now had its lifeline in CH's grip, with no room for negotiation.

"CH is willing to supply raw materials," Alexander said, his voice icy. "On the condition of a ninety-ten profit split."

"Ninety-ten?" Edward Roland slammed the table and stood. "They might as well rob a bank!"

Alexander gave a bitter smile. "We're the ones begging them now."

Dylan Orlando nearly spat out his coffee in the office.

He stole a glance at Evelyn Roland, who was calmly signing contracts. The woman played ruthless.

"Deal." Evelyn hung up the phone, her pen slashing a sharp stroke across the document.

As her secretary hurried out with the files, she almost collided with Dylan, who was eavesdropping.

"Boss," Dylan whispered, "are you trying to bankrupt the Rolands?"

Evelyn twirled her pen. "This is just the beginning."

Her lips curled into a dangerous smile as she stared at KL's stock chart on her screen.

At the Roland estate, Isabella Langley massaged Edward's shoulders.

"Don't be upset, Dad. If it weren't for Mr. Valdemar's intervention, CH wouldn't even offer us ten percent."

Her fingers trembled slightly, unable to hide the excitement in her eyes.

Alexander watched coldly. "Starting tomorrow, you'll work at the branch office as a sales assistant."

"Brother! I have an MBA from Harvard!" Isabella shot up from her seat.

"Then prove it." Alexander tossed a stack of reports at her. "I want an analysis on these client profiles by tomorrow."

Isabella stormed to her room and slammed the door.

She pulled out her phone to call Sebastian Valdemar but hung up before the call connected.

The mirror reflected her twisted expression.

"Evelyn Roland..." The name hissed through her clenched teeth.

Meanwhile, the lights on CH's top floor burned through the night.

Evelyn stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, the city's glittering skyline sprawled beneath her.

Dylan entered with an update. "We found out Isabella's been secretly meeting with Valdemar's people."

"Let her walk into a trap," Evelyn said without turning. "Feed her that failed project in the southern district."

The pen spun coldly between her fingers—like a hunter setting the snare.
###Chapter 146

The mining disaster aftermath still lingered when Evelyn Roland decided to postpone making demands of her father. The jewelry sales season was currently in full swing.

Valdemar Group had seen a significant sales boost thanks to Evelyn's designs. Yet CH Jewelry Inc. dominated the market with aggressive pricing strategies, securing the top sales position.

"CH has no in-house designers?" Industry peers exchanged puzzled glances, intrigued by this mysterious new brand.

Theodore Ashcroft adjusted his glasses. "Mr. Valdemar, should we match their price cuts?"

Sebastian Valdemar twirled his pen with practiced ease. "No need."

He knew Evelyn's tactics all too well. That woman had an uncanny eye for opportunity and always maximized gains with minimal effort. KL Design Group's losses had been meticulously calculated in her playbook.

"What a shrewd penny-pincher." Sebastian's lips curved slightly. Theodore blinked in surprise—this marked the first time he'd seen his boss show genuine interest in anyone.

With CH Jewelry running smoothly, Evelyn returned to campus. Dylan Orlando handled daily operations while she periodically submitted new designs.

In the medical library, Evelyn pored over ancient texts. The memory of Sebastian's poisoning in the mines remained vivid, sparking her fascination with the rare toxin.

"Student ID." The librarian extended a languid hand.

Their eyes met, and the air froze. Victoria Lowell's pupils dilated. "Evelyn Roland?"

Since the Evans family's downfall, the Lowells had struggled. Vincent Lowell had pulled strings to secure his daughter this library job, hoping she'd snag a wealthy suitor.

"Business design major?" Victoria's voice turned shrill. "A dropout like you dares attend Stanford?"

She snatched the ID card, waving it triumphantly. "Everyone! Look at this fraud using a fake student ID!"

A crowd gathered at the library entrance. Evelyn's gaze turned glacial as she observed this unrepentant woman, a dangerous glint flashing in her eyes.
###Chapter 147

The crowd outside the library grew larger. Evelyn Roland's brows furrowed slightly.

She yanked Victoria Lowell's ID badge, her voice barely above a whisper. "Victoria, do you really want to make a scene here?"

Her fingertip traced the words "Librarian" on the badge.

Victoria stumbled back, the lanyard digging into her neck. She raised her voice deliberately. "What? Think you're special just because you know Sebastian Valdemar?"

Every student turned to stare.

Two design majors pushed to the front, studying Evelyn's face intently.

"Wait... Aren't you the one who asked that question at Sebastian's lecture last semester?"

"Oh my god! I remember now! She's Celadon! I've seen her profile photo in the magazine!"

The crowd erupted into murmurs.

Victoria's face twisted. "That's ridiculous! She doesn't even have a high school diploma!"

A bespectacled girl suddenly lifted her phone. "The International Design Association's website has Celadon's profile. The photo matches!"

Sunlight glinted off the screen, clearly displaying Evelyn's official headshot alongside a long list of accolades.

"Judge for the KIO Awards..."
"Youngest gold medalist in Asia-Pacific..."
"Creator of the Shattered Stars Collection..."

Whispers rippled through the gathering.

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. She snatched Evelyn's student ID. "Even if she's Celadon, school rules state—"

"School rules also prohibit staff from abusing their power," Evelyn cut in smoothly. "Shall I pull up last year's librarian recruitment exam scores?"

Victoria's hand jerked. The ID fell to the ground.

Evelyn bent to retrieve it, flicking the card with her finger. "Ranked 37th. Written exam score: 52. The cutoff was 65."

The crowd exploded.

"Seriously? How did she get hired?"
"I'm reporting this to the dean!"
"Nepotism hires don't belong at Stanford!"

Victoria's face turned ashen. She staggered backward.

Evelyn pocketed her ID and walked into the library without looking back. Behind her, voices called out, "Celadon! Senior Celadon!" She merely waved a hand in acknowledgment.

As the glass doors closed, Victoria's tearful shriek pierced the air. "Do you know who my father is?"

Laughter drowned out her words.
###Chapter 148

Evelyn Roland leaned against the library doorframe, tapping her library card lightly.

Victoria Lowell's face turned from red to pale.

Her fingers tightened around the chain of her designer bag, nails digging into her palms.

"Have you all lost your minds?" Her voice trembled. "You'd side with some country bumpkin over me?"

Evelyn smirked. "Miss Lowell," she said softly, "who's the real joke here?"

Students raised their phones, camera flashes popping like fireflies.

The hashtag #LowellHeiressBulliesRuralStudent instantly trended.

Victoria lunged at Evelyn. "This is all your fault!"

Evelyn sidestepped smoothly. Victoria stumbled, crashing into a bookshelf.

The librarian approached with a frosty expression. "Miss Lowell, you need to leave. Now."

That afternoon, the sound of shattering porcelain echoed from the principal's office.

"Vincent Lowell!" An elderly professor slammed his hands on the desk. "Your daughter just got me written up!"

Behind the campus gates, Evelyn pulled her baseball cap lower.

She never expected her Celadon identity to leak.

Design majors had even made support banners, crowding the library entrance.

A sharp slap rang out from the corner.

"Idiot!" Vincent Lowell's veins bulged. "You've humiliated the Lowell name!"

Margaret Hill shielded her daughter. "It must be that jinx Evelyn! Ever since she left—"

"Yes!" Victoria clutched her cheek, shrieking. "She hacked the interview system!"

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

Just then, the butler arrived hurriedly. "Miss, the chairman has been waiting."

The Lowells turned in unison.

Margaret's finger stabbed toward Evelyn's face. "You little witch! I knew it was you!"

The butler stepped forward, his tailored cuff revealing a bespoke wristwatch.

"Mrs. Lowell," he inclined his head slightly, "mind your language."

Vincent's gaze locked on the timepiece. His expression darkened instantly.
###Chapter 149

Mr. Joy's grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly.

The rearview mirror reflected the tense faces of Edward and Sophia Roland. Since the mining incident, the couple hadn't slept peacefully.

"Madam, we're approaching Stanford University," Mr. Joy reminded softly.

Sophia twisted her Hermes scarf in her hands. Their daughter had refused their calls for seven straight days, always claiming to be busy.

"Drive faster, Joy," Edward checked his watch impatiently. "Evelyn's class will end soon."

A commotion erupted on campus.

"They say Celadon studies here!"
"Someone from the design department—Evelyn Roland..."

Mr. Joy's expression darkened. He immediately called security. "Send backup. Miss Evelyn might be in danger."

The Lowell family had cornered Evelyn on a secluded path.

"Who do you think you are?" Victoria sneered. "Changing your identity won't change anything."

Margaret added with venom, "Don't forget who raised you."

Vincent was mid-rant when Mr. Joy arrived with four bodyguards. "Fifty designs? You should be grateful for the opportunity!"

"How dare you!" Mr. Joy snapped.

Victoria eyed the well-dressed man and laughed. "Evelyn, where'd you hire this actor from?"

Adjusting his tie, Mr. Joy replied coldly, "Mind your language."

Two Maseratis roared to a stop nearby. Victoria's smirk vanished when the doors opened.

Sophia rushed to Evelyn, tears streaming. "Sweetheart, I was wrong..."

Her trembling hands cupped Evelyn's face. "You've lost weight. Have you been eating properly?"

Edward stood nearby, red-eyed. The formidable tycoon looked like a chastened child. "Evelyn, punish us however you want..."

Vincent paled.

He recognized the limited-edition sports car—featured in last week's finance magazine as one of only ten worldwide. And these people... They were the heads of Roland Group!

"M-Mr. Roland?" Vincent's voice shook.

Margaret suddenly gasped, realization dawning. Now she understood why the Rolands had crushed the Lowells—they'd harmed their heiress.

Mr. Joy's icy gaze swept over the trio. "Shall I explain the prison sentence for defamation?"

The Maserati's engine purred mockingly at the Lowells' stupidity.
###Chapter 150

Edward Roland's eyes reddened, his voice choked with emotion. "We haven't been able to eat properly these past days..."

His clenched fists trembled slightly, the usual authority of a business tycoon completely absent.

The Lowell family exchanged uneasy glances, stunned into silence by the scene before them.

Who would have thought the Rolands cherished their long-lost daughter so deeply?

Victoria Lowell dug her nails into her palms.

Why?

How could Evelyn Roland suddenly become the heiress of the Roland family? All her past gloating must have seemed like a pathetic joke in Evelyn's eyes.

She glared at Evelyn, her gaze burning with resentment and envy.

Vincent Lowell immediately put on an obsequious smile, bending forward obnoxiously.

"Mr. Roland, Mrs. Roland... I had no idea—"

"Get out of my sight!" Edward snapped, his voice sharp as a blade. "You dared to make my daughter design for you?"

His piercing glare could cut steel. "We spared you before only because Evelyn chose to hide her identity. But since you clearly lack gratitude..."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, remaining silent.

Even without the Rolands' intervention, she would have reclaimed what her grandfather left behind.

"Dad! Why are you begging her—"

Slap!

Vincent backhanded his daughter across the face. "You insolent brat! Kneel and apologize!"

Victoria was forced to the ground.

"Evelyn, after all these years—"

"Silence!" Edward roared. "How dare you speak of raising her?"

Sophia Roland, usually gentle, now wore an icy expression. "We know exactly how you treated her all these years."

"Every debt will be repaid tenfold."

Vincent dropped to his knees with a thud.

Against the Rolands, they had no right to resist.

"Evelyn, at least spare us—"

"I'll let you go," Evelyn said calmly. "But I'm taking back everything that belonged to Grandpa."

"Over my dead body!" Victoria snarled, her eyes blazing. "You're trying to ruin us!"

Evelyn gestured indifferently toward the wall. "Feel free to end it now."

Her gaze was frigid. "Don't forget—Grandpa was the one who raised me. Not you."

In her heart, the Lowells had died the day her grandfather passed.

"Can't we just give half—"

"All of it."

Edward smirked coldly. "Do I need to demonstrate the Roland family's capabilities?"

"We'll give it! We'll give it!" Vincent's face turned ashen. At least they could keep their personal assets.

Sophia stated firmly, "The transfer will be completed within three days."

When she turned to her daughter, her expression instantly softened.

"Evelyn, is this arrangement acceptable?"
###Chapter 151

Evelyn Roland's gaze lowered slightly, her emotions as unfathomable as a deep pool.

"I'm only reclaiming Grandfather's share." Her fingers tapped lightly on the desk, her voice cool. "As for the rest of the Lowells, they mean nothing to me."

She looked down at the three figures kneeling before her, the hem of her dress perfectly still.

"Once the transfer is complete, we're even." She paused. "No further contact."

Vincent Lowell's face turned ashen, his nails digging into his palms.

"Still here?" Edward Roland's icy shout sent the trio scrambling out in panic.

He stepped forward and took his daughter's hand. "Let's go home. Don't blame your mother and me."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. "I never blamed you."

It was the truth.

Since being reunited with her birth family, she'd never made a single demand—except for keeping her identity hidden. Her quiet understanding made Sophia Roland secretly weep at night.

Yet a coldness lingered in Evelyn's chest.

CH Holdings had just established itself in A-city, with overseas assets still being transferred. The manor was too far, too inconvenient.

"I'll visit often." The corner of her lips lifted slightly. "I'm just not used to living at Blenheim."

Sophia looked uncertain. "Really?"

Only after repeated assurances did her parents finally leave, glancing back every few steps.

"Your mother has silenced the Lowells," Sophia added anxiously before departing. "If anyone troubles you at school, you must tell us."

"Mmm."

Watching them go, Evelyn opened the university forum. Every post about her had vanished—even search terms were blocked.

The Rolands' doing, no doubt.

She traced her phone screen, warmth flickering in her eyes.

Their soft spot for Isabella Langley was just twenty years of parental affection clouding their judgment. Perhaps... she needed to give this newfound family bond more time.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Boss, the contracts are ready," Dylan Orlando's voice came through. "Should I deliver them to Valdemar Group?"

Ten design blueprints awaited final approval.

"I'll go myself." She needed to watch Sebastian Valdemar sign them—only then would this deal be settled.

The Valdemar Tower blazed with light.

Isabella Langley swayed into the lobby, her miniskirt showcasing legs so pale they nearly glowed.

"Please inform Mr. Valdemar," she tucked a stray lock behind her ear, "I'm here to express my gratitude."

The receptionist dialed the internal line. "There's a Ms. Roland—"

"Roland?" Sebastian's finger stilled.

Had the mine matter been resolved? At least the woman kept her word. His lips curved. "Send her up."

When Isabella entered his office, Sebastian was lounging on the leather sofa. His expression darkened instantly.

"You?"
###Chapter 152

Sebastian's voice turned icy. "What are you doing here?"

Isabella's red lips curved into a smirk, her eyes glinting with charm. "I came to thank you, of course. After our encounter at CH Group, if you hadn't spoken up for me, the KL Jewelry deal wouldn't have gone so smoothly."

The air froze.

Sebastian let out a cold laugh, his gaze sharp.

"You're mistaken. I never spoke up for the Langley family."

He'd expected Evelyn to intervene for KL, but he hadn't anticipated her demanding a staggering 30% of the profits.

"Leave if you have nothing else to say."

He massaged his temples irritably. Had he really been foolish enough to expect gratitude from Evelyn?

What had he been thinking?

"I'm sorry..." Isabella bit her lip, feigning hurt. "I was wrong about the media thing. Sebastian, you can't dismiss my feelings over one mistake—"

The office door swung open.

Evelyn stood in the doorway, a file in hand.

Her eyes flicked to Isabella, who was practically draped over Sebastian, her low-cut dress leaving little to the imagination. Evelyn arched a brow.

Typical. Men never saw through the act.

Not her problem, though.

"Am I interrupting? Should I come back later?"

"Get in here!" Sebastian shot to his feet, instinctively putting distance between himself and Isabella.

Isabella's face darkened, her anger barely contained.

"What are you doing here?" she snapped.

Evelyn gave her a cool glance. "Delivering a contract."

"A contract?" Isabella sneered. "Since when does a Stanford student work with Valdemar Group? If you wanted to see Sebastian, you could've just said so. Who are you trying to fool?"

Sebastian's eyes narrowed.

"Isabella, how do you know she attends Stanford?" His voice was dangerously calm. "Are you two acquainted?"

Evelyn frowned.

"I—I saw it on her social media," Isabella stammered.

"Really?" Sebastian's gaze shifted to Evelyn, amused. "I was under the impression she never posts, just like me."

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes.

Idiot.

"Ms. Roland is a contracted designer for Valdemar. We have a professional relationship." Sebastian's tone turned glacial. "Shall I call security?"

"Sebastian—" Isabella whined, dragging out his name.

The door burst open with a kick.

"Enough with the act," a sharp female voice cut in. "The stench of desperation is giving me a headache. Didn’t you hear my brother tell you to leave?"
###Chapter 153

Olivia Valdemar stood in the center of the office, one hand supporting her five-month baby bump, the other resting on her hip. Her sharp gaze pinned Isabella Langley in place as her crimson lips parted. "Who gave you permission to act so shamelessly here?"

Sebastian Valdemar immediately rose to his feet, carefully guiding his sister to a chair. "Didn't the doctor order bed rest?"

"If I hadn't come, certain people would've walked all over you." Olivia let out a cold laugh before turning back to Isabella. "I heard you have objections to my brother's collaboration with Celadon?"

Isabella's face paled, her fingers twisting the hem of her blouse. "Olivia, I just—"

"Stop." Olivia raised a single finger. "I don't recall my mother giving birth to a sister. And with that makeup thick enough to scrape off and use as wall paint, how dare you call me 'sister'?"

The air in the office turned glacial.

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes as she bit her lip and fled.

"Same surname, yet worlds apart in character." Olivia shook her head before flashing a warm smile at Evelyn Roland. "Evelyn, you must visit us soon. I've acquired some new calligraphy pieces you'll adore."

Evelyn gave a polite nod and slid the contract toward Sebastian. "Mr. Valdemar, please review the terms."

Sebastian skimmed the clauses and arched a brow. "Don't trust me?"

"Business is business." Evelyn's expression remained neutral. "Clear terms protect everyone."

After signing, Evelyn rose to leave. Pausing beside Olivia, she added softly, "You've been struggling with insomnia. Try an Austrian Pinot Noir—it's safe during pregnancy."

Olivia's eyes widened. "How did you know?"

Evelyn merely smiled and glided out.

"That girl is extraordinary!" Olivia clapped her brother's shoulder. "Pity some people aren't worthy of her."

Sebastian stared at the closed door, lost in thought. The mysterious herb from the mines—Theodore still hadn't traced its origins. Just how many secrets did Evelyn Roland harbor?

Back in her CH Design office, Evelyn had just finalized next season's sketches when her phone buzzed.

"Evelyn!" Bianca Savigny's cheerful voice chirped through the line. "The château just received a shipment of Burgundy. Come taste it with me!"

Evelyn's lips curved. Her former protégé, now the youngest sommelier at Château Blanc, never failed to brighten her day.
###Chapter 154

The ledger of Château Blanc lay open on the desk, Evelyn Roland's fingertip resting on the final page's glaring red figures. Under Vincent Lowell's two-year management, the vineyard had been drained dry—now even basic grape procurement funds were unavailable.

Her phone vibrated. The screen displayed "Bianca Savigny."

"Evelyn, the warehouse inventory is depleted..." The young woman's voice trembled. "The workers are asking about next month's wages..."

Evelyn gazed out the window. Sunlight filtered through the glass, casting dappled shadows across the ledger.

"Suspend operations for now." She closed the book. "I'll cover the severance pay."

"But Evelyn!" Bianca's pitch rose frantically. "This was your grandfather's legacy—"

"Who said I'm giving up?" Evelyn interrupted, her fingers absently tracing the ledger's gilded edges. "Grandfather's beloved Merlot vineyard—I would never let it fall to ruin."

The call ended, only for another number to flash on screen.

"Evelyn..." Sophia Roland's voice was tentative. "Come home for dinner tonight? I'm cooking your favorites..."

Evelyn's eyes lingered on the photograph of Charles Lowell on her desk. "Mm."

The clatter of dishes and cheerful chatter immediately spilled through the receiver.

Rush hour traffic crawled at a standstill. When Evelyn pushed open the Roland estate doors, Sophia nearly spilled a steaming tureen in her haste from the kitchen.

"My darling girl!" The soup nearly scalded Alexander Roland.

Rubbing his reddened hand, Alexander scowled. "Am I adopted?"

"Go hug your robots!" Sophia shot back, then piled Evelyn's plate with food. "Once Evelyn's ready to reclaim her identity, I'll throw the grandest gala this city's ever seen!"

Isabella Langley's chopsticks tapped a sharp rhythm against her bowl. "I heard Stanford's curriculum is brutal. Keeping up, little sister?"

"Managing." Evelyn stirred her soup leisurely.

The dining room tension thickened. Just then, the butler hurried in. "Sir, the Valdemars have arrived."

Isabella's chopsticks clattered onto the table. She frantically smoothed her hair, eyes blazing with excitement.

Alexander set down his wineglass with a frown. "Sebastian Valdemar? What does he want?"
###Chapter 155

Eugene Lefèvre avoided eye contact, stammering, "It's not Mr. Sebastian..."

Before he could finish, Isabella Langley was already rushing toward the door, calling out to the guards, "Let them in at once!"

Her smile froze when she saw who had arrived.

Olivia Valdemar gave a graceful bow to the Roland elders. "I'm Olivia Valdemar, Sebastian's sister. Forgive the intrusion."

"Please have a seat, Ms. Valdemar." Edward Roland gestured for tea to be served.

Isabella stomped her foot in disappointment. "Why are you here?"

"Who else were you expecting?" Olivia settled onto the sofa, her gaze sweeping over the dining area.

She adjusted her wristwatch, her tone icy. "Sebastian won't be coming to see you again."

"What do you mean?" Isabella's eyes welled up as she bit her lip hard. "Our families still have a marriage arrangement—"

Olivia raised a hand to cut her off. "He came to break it off last time, but it wasn't formally dissolved."

Her attention suddenly shifted to the dining table. "I heard the Rolands recently welcomed a long-lost daughter?"

Sophia Roland instinctively shielded Evelyn.

This Valdemar heiress radiated too much dominance. She would never allow her daughter to marry into such a family.

"Correct." Sophia's voice was firm. "Since we're on the topic, consider the engagement void."

"Mother!" Isabella tugged at her sleeve in panic.

Alexander Roland held his daughter back. "Enough."

Olivia nodded in approval. "Perfect."

As she stood, her eyes locked onto Evelyn with disbelief. "You— Are you the one they—"

"Good evening, Ms. Valdemar." Evelyn spoke first. "I'm here to examine Mrs. Roland."

She added smoothly, "We share the same surname, so she kindly invited me to stay for dinner."

Olivia studied her. "I see."

A sudden spark lit her eyes. "Since Mrs. Roland trusts your medical skills, perhaps you could examine Sebastian in a few days?"

Evelyn's heartbeat stuttered.

Sebastian's mysterious condition had always intrigued her.

"The honor would be mine," she heard herself say.

Isabella dug her nails into her palms.

This bastard was trying to steal Sebastian again! She'd sensed something off that day in the office. No way would she let this stray snatch what rightfully belonged to her.

The title of Mrs. Valdemar was hers alone!
###Chapter 156

Isabella Langley's nails dug deep into her palms.

Why?

All the affection that should have been hers was now stolen by that wretched woman!

"Deal." Olivia Valdemar turned gracefully, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Isabella immediately plastered on a fake smile. "Sister, you don't even know medicine. How embarrassing will it be when you're exposed?"

She deliberately raised her voice so everyone could hear.

Alexander Roland frowned. "Isabella!"

"I'm just telling the truth," Isabella pouted, feigning innocence. "What if the Valdemars find out she's a fraud..."

"Who said I'm a fraud?" Evelyn Roland scoffed and walked straight toward Sophia Roland.

Her slender fingers lightly rested on Sophia's wrist.

"You've been suffering from insomnia, vivid dreams, and a weak spleen due to stomach coldness."

"Anyone can spout generic diagnoses," Isabella rolled her eyes dismissively.

Without looking up, Evelyn continued, "It's caused by excessive consumption of iced papaya. I recommend abstaining for three days."

The butler gasped. "Madam has indeed been eating iced papaya daily! How did you know, Miss Evelyn?"

Sophia covered her mouth in shock. "Evelyn, you..."

"Just a basic understanding," Evelyn replied with a faint smile.

Edward Roland eagerly extended his hand. "Check me next!"

"Your right knee has a meniscus injury. Apply ground beetle with rice wine as a poultice."

"Write that down!" Edward slammed the table excitedly. His chronic pain had been diagnosed in an instant.

Alexander also leaned in, asking for his sister's diagnosis.

No one noticed Isabella's livid expression. She stormed off, stomping her feet, with the assistant butler scrambling after her.

"Don't worry, Miss Isabella. The master and madam are just momentarily intrigued—"

"Shut up!" Isabella's eyes darkened with malice. "That bitch won't be smug for long."

Meanwhile, at the Valdemar mansion...

Olivia hummed a tune as she pushed open the door.

"Sis, what's got you so happy?" Sebastian Valdemar set down his documents.

"I solved your big problem." Olivia twirled. "I canceled the engagement with the Langley girl."

Sebastian shot to his feet. "What?"

"No more harassment from Isabella Langley." She winked triumphantly. "Oh, and I invited Evelyn to examine you soon."

"She's at the Rolands?" Sebastian's pupils constricted sharply.

"Yes, her medical skills are incredible—"

Before she could finish, Sebastian had already bolted out the door.
###Chapter 157

Every inch of the Frost Citadel was soaked in blood.

Marcus Atlante sat atop a pile of corpses, his fingers tracing the grotesque contours of a severed head in his grasp.

"Commander Marcus, the General summons you."

He tossed the head aside without a second glance.

The command tent reeked of blood and rusted steel.

"How's your recovery?" General Adrian Grandelle wiped his bloodstained sword.

"Never been clearer." Marcus's lips curled into a frigid smile. "What's next?"

Adrian pointed to the sand table. "We've discovered a massive cavern beneath the citadel. Likely the enemy's nest."

"I'll lead the vanguard." A crimson glint flashed in Marcus's eyes.

"Denied." Adrian's voice was steel. "Your company is down to you and Chester."

Spencer Roscente clapped his shoulder. "Patience, soldier. Revenge takes time."

Marcus clenched his fists in silence.

"Your new armor has arrived." Adrian handed him a token. "Collect it from the quartermaster."

Back in his tent, Marcus stared at his trembling hands.

The hunger for slaughter echoed relentlessly in his mind.

"This isn't me..." He clutched his head in agony.

At dawn, he sought out the mage Warren Klein.

"Chaos Toxin has corroded your psyche." Warren frowned. "It amplifies your bloodlust."

"Is there a cure?"

Warren unrolled a parchment. "The Calming Spell can suppress it temporarily. But you'll need monastic healing."

"I want to learn magic."

Warren scoffed and tossed him a crystal. "Try this."

A faint glow flickered in Marcus's palm.

"Limited aptitude." Warren shook his head. Still, he threw a heavy tome at him. "Learn to read first."

The runes twisted grotesquely before Marcus's eyes.

In the frozen woods, Chester found their company's tattered banner.

The bloodstains on the fabric burned Marcus's vision.

"My brothers... I'll make them pay in blood."

During the strategy meeting, Adrian outlined a decapitation strike.

Marcus remained eerily quiet.

No one noticed the forbidden ritual he'd performed in the laboratory.

In his mindscape, Marcus stood atop a mountain of gore.

"Come at me, cowards!" He laughed maniacally, slaughtering phantoms.

When the flesh-core dragged him under, he awoke with a gasp.

"Daydreaming?" Spencer nudged him.

The citadel's interior was oppressively humid.

The Fearless blocked their path.

"Cover the General!" Marcus charged first.

His Obsidian Claymore gleamed with unnatural light.

"Die! All of you!"

He tore through enemies like a rabid hound, ripping a Fearless warrior's head off barehanded.

"You... killed Bentley?"

Seeing a familiar insignia on one foe's chest, Marcus snapped completely.

When reason returned, dismembered allies littered the ground.

Kneeling in gore, Marcus arranged corpses into a profane sigil.

Runes writhed across his skin as demonic whispers filled his ears.

"This... is power."

He rose laughing, striding deeper into the citadel.

The sounds of battle faded behind him.

Marcus Bloodeye was no longer the Empire's soldier.
###Chapter 158

The sharp click of high heels echoed behind Sebastian Valdemar. He turned and found himself staring into Evelyn Roland's icy gaze.

Her eyes lingered on him for less than a second before she coolly looked away, striding toward her reserved seat.

"Mr. Valdemar, do you enjoy playing golf?"

"I heard about your recent tech company acquisition. Impressive."

Sebastian tapped his fingers lightly against the table.

The meticulously made-up girl before him asked each question with deliberate flattery. The undisguised admiration in her eyes threatened to spill over.

Another tedious blind date.

He glanced discreetly at his watch. Olivia Valdemar had arranged this meeting. If he didn’t give a clear rejection, she’d likely pester him endlessly.

"Excuse me." His gaze suddenly locked onto Evelyn, his lips curving in a faint smirk. "I’ve spotted an acquaintance."

The suggestive tone made Fiona Valentine instantly perk up, her eyes darting toward the woman nearby.

Sebastian strode toward Evelyn, deliberately raising his voice. "What a coincidence. What would you like for dinner? I’ll pick you up from the office."

Evelyn’s grip on her water glass faltered.

Had he lost his mind?

They might be acquainted, but they were nowhere near close enough for dinner plans.

Fiona’s scorching gaze burned into Evelyn’s back. The girl’s poorly concealed scrutiny was painfully obvious to Evelyn.

Understanding dawned—this was Sebastian’s unwanted admirer.

Before she could react, the man suddenly leaned in. Warm breath brushed her ear, carrying a hint of cedarwood.

She instinctively recoiled, but a large hand cradled the back of her neck.

"Sebastian!"

Her warning came in a low hiss as she pressed an elbow against his chest. He grunted but didn’t budge.

Compared to this minor discomfort, shaking off the delusional girl was far more important.

"Do me a favor."

"I have no interest in being your shield." Frost coated Evelyn’s eyes.

"Is that so?" Sebastian chuckled. "Then the Valdemar family might reconsider canceling the annulment..."

Evelyn’s pupils constricted.

How did he know?

Olivia had dined at the Rolands’ last night—damn it, she’d slipped up.

A triumphant laugh brushed her ear.

"Just a guess, but your reaction confirms it..."

"So you’re my mysterious fiancée?"

"You tricked me?" Evelyn gritted her teeth. She’d fallen for such an obvious trap.

"Fiancée." He drew out the word. "If you don’t help me with this nuisance, our engagement might just be reinstated."

Her gaze sharpened like a blade, then forcibly softened into crescents the next second.

Through clenched teeth, she spat out three words: "Just for today."
###Chapter 159

A faint smirk curled at Sebastian Valdemar's lips, dark triumph flashing in his eyes.

He leaned in close to Evelyn Roland, his warm breath grazing the delicate curve of her neck.

Their proximity was intimate enough for their heartbeats to echo against each other. Evelyn's spine stiffened, her fingers trembling slightly.

To onlookers, they appeared as a picture-perfect couple lost in whispered affection.

Sebastian's arm tightened around her slender waist, his palm pressing possessively against the dip of her spine.

"You—!" Fury ignited in Evelyn's gaze, but with her secrets held hostage, she had no choice but to endure his audacity.

"Bear with me a little longer, Miss Roland," Sebastian murmured, his voice a low, intoxicating rasp.

Evelyn mentally shredded him to pieces.

Fiona Valentine clenched her skirt, nails digging crescent moons into her palms. She watched as Sebastian tilted Evelyn's chin up, his gaze tender as springwater.

The sight stabbed through her heart.

Sebastian's obsidian eyes held Evelyn captive, dark and fathomless. For a fleeting moment, she forgot to pull away.

Fiona finally broke, fleeing the scene.

Evelyn snapped back to reality, shoving Sebastian away. The sudden emptiness in his arms made his expression shutter closed.

"That poor girl must be blind," Evelyn scoffed.

The memory of Fiona's tear-streaked face left an uncomfortable weight in her chest.

Sebastian's demeanor cooled, as if his earlier tenderness had been an illusion. "Thanks for the cooperation."

Hypocrite.

Evelyn met his gaze, her voice icy. "Remember your promise."

If he dared expose her identity, she'd make him regret it.

Her defensive stance only amused Sebastian.

Countless socialites threw themselves at him—yet this woman recoiled. The thought inexplicably grated on him, his canines itching.

"How could I forget Miss Roland's words?" His lips curved with mocking amusement.

Evelyn suddenly stepped forward, invading his space. Sebastian didn't flinch.

"Stay away from me," she enunciated sharply.

Like a bristling fox, he mused.

Evelyn strode off, her retreating figure radiating finality.

Sebastian watched her go, his gaze deepening.

The Roland heiress? Interesting.

Bianca Savigny burst into the café, breathless, scanning the room.

As she brushed past Sebastian, the scent of aged wine clung to her.

His brow arched. A winemaker this young?

Evelyn lingered at the street corner, observing Bianca's frantic search.
###Chapter 160

The mere thought of Sebastian Valdemar's face made Evelyn Roland roll her eyes.

What a nuisance.

She immediately dismissed the idea of meeting Bianca Savigny.

The hallway was empty.

Evelyn pulled out her phone from her bag, fingers flying across the screen.

Bianca's number appeared quickly.

The call connected almost instantly.

"Sorry, something came up," Evelyn said briskly. "Let's reschedule."

A brief silence followed.

"That's alright," Bianca's voice remained gentle. "Take your time."

The response twisted Evelyn's heart.

She rubbed her nose awkwardly.

Thank God this was just a phone call.

Lying to such an innocent girl felt...

"I'll treat you next time," she added lamely.

Hanging up, Evelyn leaned against the wall and stared at the ceiling.

That bastard Sebastian!

She mentally cursed his entire family tree.

If not for him, she could've met Bianca today.

Next time they crossed paths, she'd make him pay. A dangerous smirk curled her lips.

The next morning.

The alarm blared incessantly.

Evelyn slammed it off and sat up, her hair a wild mess.

Morning classes were inhuman.

Yawning, she washed up and threw on casual wear.

The mirror reflected a girl with a high ponytail, delicate features accentuated by light makeup.

She grabbed her gold-rimmed glasses on the way out.

Thirty minutes to spare.

Plenty of time.

As her car headed toward Stanford University, Fiona Valentine walked down a narrow alley.

She was a music student.

Rapid footsteps suddenly echoed behind her.

Fiona's pulse spiked.

Someone was following her!

She quickened her pace, heels clicking sharply against the cobblestones.

But the footsteps grew closer.

This shortcut was always deserted, and today was no exception.

"Running away, sweetheart?"

A greasy voice slithered into her ear.

Fiona froze.

Too terrified to look back, she broke into a run.

Her heel caught in a crack.

"Ah!"

She crashed onto the pavement, palms burning from the impact.

"Tsk tsk. So clumsy."

A pockmarked face loomed over her.
###Chapter 161

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains as Fiona Valentine finished breakfast. She hummed a cheerful tune while pushing open her apartment door, only to collide with a thickset man at the corner.

"Well, aren't you an early bird, pretty thing." His greasy voice made Fiona's stomach churn.

She instinctively stepped back until her spine pressed against the cold wall. "Sir... I have money. Take it all..." Her trembling fingers fumbled with her wallet, nearly dropping it.

The man slapped the wallet away. His meaty hand gripped her chin. "Who cares about money? I want you!" His alcohol-laced breath assaulted her senses.

"Help—" Fiona's scream echoed through the empty alley.

Just as the brute tore at her collar, a black sedan screeched to a halt. The door swung open, revealing long legs in stiletto heels.

Evelyn Roland removed her sunglasses, surveying the scene with narrowed eyes. She'd intended to ignore the commotion—until recognizing the girl she'd accidentally injured yesterday. A pang of guilt struck her.

"Quite the lively morning." She rolled up her shirt sleeves with deliberate slowness.

The man turned and gaped at Evelyn. "Two beauties in one day? My lucky streak!" Releasing Fiona, he advanced with greedy hands.

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. As he lunged, she pivoted—her stiletto connecting precisely with his groin.

"AAARGH!" His pig-like squeal sent sparrows fleeing from nearby trees.

The man collapsed, wheezing on the pavement. Evelyn planted a heel between his shoulder blades. "Hurts, doesn't it?" She increased pressure until vertebrae creaked.

Fiona watched wide-eyed from the wall. The monster who'd terrified her now writhed like a dying dog.

"Scram." Evelyn lifted her foot. The man scrambled away on all fours.

Sunlight illuminated Evelyn's profile, and Fiona's breath caught. Her rescuer looked devastatingly heroic.
###Chapter 162

That girl crouching by the wall looked strangely familiar.

A memory flashed—the girl shielded by Sebastian Valdemar in the café.

So she was a student at Stanford.

"Help!" A scream shattered the quiet.

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. Down the alley, a greasy man had Fiona Valentine backed against the wall.

"Come play with me, sweetheart?" The man leered, reaching out.

Evelyn lunged forward, her stiletto crushing his foot.

A howl of pain erupted.

Before he could react, she flipped him over her shoulder. Her heel pressed against his throat. "Looking to die?"

"Mercy!" The man trembled. "I'll leave! I swear!"

"Too late." She pulled out her phone and dialed the police with crisp efficiency.

Fiona huddled against the wall, face pale. She stood shakily, whispering, "Th-thank you."

Evelyn noticed her swollen ankle. "Can you walk?"

Fiona shook her head, eyes brimming.

With a sigh, Evelyn scooped her up effortlessly. The girl weighed nothing, her delicate frame carrying a hint of jasmine.

"I'll take you to the infirmary."

Fiona flushed crimson, fidgeting with her sleeve. "Um...could I know your name?"

"Evelyn Roland."

"Celadon?!" Fiona's eyes widened. "You're the international designer Celadon?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "You know me?"

"I've seen your fashion shows!" Fiona babbled excitedly. "Oh my god, I can't believe I'm meeting my idol!"

In the infirmary, Fiona kept stealing glances at Evelyn while the nurse bandaged her ankle.

"Done staring?" Evelyn smirked.

Fiona's ears turned red as she hastily looked away.

That evening at the café, Evelyn reviewed design sketches when a white blur appeared across from her.

"Hi, I'm Fiona Valentine." The girl nervously slid a CD across the table. "This is my piano recording...I hope you like it."

Their fingers brushed as Evelyn took it, sending Fiona jerking back as if shocked.

"I'll listen carefully." Evelyn's lips curved.

Fiona fled, her retreating figure making Evelyn chuckle.

What an intriguing little thing.
###Chapter 163

"Can I help you?" Evelyn Roland lifted her gaze, her tone distant.

The ponytailed girl in front of her widened her eyes. "You don't remember me? We're in the same class! I'm here to remind you about tonight's performance."

Performance? Evelyn's brows furrowed slightly.

"Oh my god!" The girl dramatically covered her mouth. "Evelyn, you're performing at the Homecoming Gala tonight!"

Homecoming Gala? She never signed up.

The air turned icy. The girl shrank back, unable to meet Evelyn's frosty stare.

"Who has the sign-up sheet?" Her voice was glacial.

"T-the student council president..." the girl stammered.

Evelyn turned and walked away without another word.

The student council office door slammed open. Everyone looked up in unison.

Evelyn strode straight to the girl seated at the head of the table.

"The sign-up sheet." She extended her hand.

The president blinked twice before scrambling to pull the form from a drawer.

Pretty face, empty head? The president smirked inwardly.

Evelyn scanned the list rapidly, her finger freezing over one name.

The room plunged into subzero temperatures. Someone shivered involuntarily.

"I never signed up." Her voice tightened. "Can this be canceled?"

The president grimaced. "The list was already submitted to the school administration..."

Evelyn's fists clenched, knuckles whitening.

"What's the performance?" Each word sounded forcibly extracted.

"P-piano solo..."

Piano? Really.

A cold laugh escaped her lips as she slammed the form onto the desk. She turned on her heel, leaving a trail of icy air in her wake.

Around the corridor corner, Isabella Langley pocketed her phone, a triumphant smirk playing on her lips.

"Mom! Dad! Brother!" She bounded into the living room, throwing herself onto the sofa.

"What's got you so excited?" Mrs. Roland affectionately ruffled her hair.

"Evelyn's performing piano at the Homecoming Gala tonight! Let's all go, okay?" She batted her doe eyes innocently.

Mr. Roland immediately stood. "Really? We should get ready then!"

"I saw her name on the list myself!" Isabella declared solemnly.

The family scrambled to change clothes. Isabella smoothed her skirt, masking the malice in her eyes.

You can't even play piano but still want to show off? Tonight, the entire school will witness your humiliation.
###Chapter 164

Twilight draped over the campus as time slipped through her fingers like sand.

On the eve of the homecoming gala, Evelyn Roland wrestled with an uncooperative zipper on her couture gown.

"Damn this zipper!" She gritted her teeth, beads of sweat forming on her forehead.

A faint rustling echoed outside the dressing room.

"Who's there?" Evelyn's muscles tensed instantly.

Sebastian Valdemar arched a brow, impressed by her sharp instincts.

"Show yourself, or I'm calling security," she threatened, voice icy.

The red velvet curtain parted, revealing a glimpse of her bare shoulder. His Adam's apple bobbed before a smirk tugged at his lips. "Fancy meeting you here, fiancée."

That insufferable man again!

"Shut it!" She whirled around. "Who gave you permission to enter?"

Backlit by the fading light, his chiseled features looked razor-sharp. The tailored suit emphasized his broad shoulders and narrow waist, the loosened tie adding deliberate nonchalance.

No wonder women flocked to him.

Right now, she only wanted to wipe that smug grin off his face.

"Need assistance?" He leaned against the doorframe, gaze trailing down her exposed back.

"Get out!"

Sebastian closed the distance in two strides, his minty breath fanning her face. One hand pinned her wrists above her head while the other deftly zipped up her dress.

"Where's my thank you?" His fingers tilted her chin up.

Evelyn slapped his hand away. "Much obliged, Professor Valdemar."

Her eyes widened. "Why are you at Stanford?"

"Board invitation." He adjusted his cufflinks lazily. "Whereas you, the Roland heiress, masquerading as a student—"

"Sebastian!" She fisted his tie. "Remember our agreement."

His pupils darkened. This feisty wildcat bore no resemblance to the poised socialite in his dossier.

"How many more secrets are you hiding?"

"None of your concern." She released him, stepping back. "The engagement was terminated."

He suddenly caged her against the mirror. "Unilateral decisions don't count."

The glass chilled her back while his chest burned against her. She kicked out, only for him to trap her leg effortlessly.

"Touch me again," she hissed, eyes blazing, "and you'll leave Stanford on a stretcher."

Sebastian chuckled low. "Can't wait."

Footsteps approached outside. He freed her, whispering against her ear:

"Until tonight, fiancée."
###Chapter 165

"Rage won't alter facts." Sebastian Valdemar's lips curved slightly, amusement flickering in his eyes.

Evelyn Roland's knuckles turned white, nails digging into her palms. She glared at the infuriating man before her, her gaze sharp enough to flay him alive.

"You—"

She itched to claw that handsome face to shreds.

Sebastian sensed her boiling fury. In a swift motion, he closed the distance between them, gripping her slender wrist. His breath brushed her ear as he murmured, "I can keep your secret. But..."

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

What was wrong with this man? Rumors claimed he despised physical contact.

A cold laugh escaped her as she jerked her knee up.

Sebastian anticipated the move, stepping back just in time. His eyes darkened, the air around him turning glacial.

"I warned you to stay away," Evelyn bit out, each word deliberate. "Seems Mr. Valdemar has hearing and memory problems."

Tension thickened the air.

Fiona Valentine arrived just in time to witness their standoff. Her heart leaped with excitement as she crept closer.

So it was all an act!

Smoothing her dress, she approached with a bright smile. "Mr. Valdemar, what a coincidence!"

Sebastian's eyes flashed with irritation, though his polite smile remained intact. "Miss Valentine."

That single glance sent Fiona's pulse racing. Gathering courage, she continued, "Are you alone? Would you like to—"

"Excuse me." Sebastian checked his watch, cutting her off with cool detachment. "The gala is about to begin."

Evelyn had already turned away, her retreating figure resolute.

Fiona watched Sebastian's tall silhouette disappear into the crowd, her grip tightening around the champagne flute.
###Chapter 166

Sebastian Valdemar's deep voice snapped Fiona Valentine out of her reverie.

"Goodbye, Mr. Valdemar." She replied hastily, cheeks tinged pink. "I look forward to seeing you again."

He gave a slight nod. As he turned to leave, his shoulder brushed past hers, leaving a faint trace of crisp pine scent in the air.

Fiona clenched her fists as she watched his tall, straight-backed figure retreat.

"I will make you fall for me," she whispered under her breath.

Only when he disappeared around the corner did she reluctantly turn away.

The Stanford University homecoming gala commenced as scheduled.

When Sebastian took his seat in the VIP section, every female gaze in the auditorium instantly locked onto him.

"Oh my God! That man is ridiculously handsome!"

"He can't be from our school. We'd have noticed someone like him before."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Look at where he's sitting!" A girl with black-framed glasses hissed.

The chatter died instantly when everyone saw the exclusive reserved seating.

"I heard they invited some young, accomplished lecturer this year..."

"Figures he'd be out of our league."

Isabella Langley's eyes lingered on Sebastian for a brief moment before darting away.

When she spotted Fiona preparing backstage, a knowing smile curled her lips.

"Go give Fiona some water," she ordered an underling.

Backstage, Fiona was taking deep breaths to steady her nerves.

"I can do this..." she kept repeating to herself.

A gentle tap on her shoulder made her jump.

"Fiona?"

The soft female voice startled her. In the dim backstage lighting, she couldn't make out the person's face.

"That's me. Who—"

"Evelyn asked me to bring you this. She said it helps with stage fright."

At Evelyn's name, Fiona's guard lowered.

"Break a leg out there. You'll dazzle them all," the stranger encouraged.

Fiona accepted the water bottle hesitantly. "Thank you."

"Don't mention it." The figure melted back into the shadows.

From the audience, Isabella watched Fiona intently, eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Fiona gripped the bottle, biting her lip.

"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

She gulped down half the bottle. Strangely enough, her nerves did seem to settle.

"I can't disappoint Sebastian..." She stole a glance at the VIP section for encouragement.

As the previous piano performance ended, the emcee announced the next act.

Fiona paced backstage, palms slick with sweat. She drained the remaining water.

"Next up, Fiona Valentine with a solo vocal performance!"

Spotlights illuminated the stage as Fiona glided out in a white evening gown.

She bowed gracefully to the audience, her delicate features radiant under the lights.

The auditorium erupted in thunderous applause.
###Chapter 167

Isabella Langley cast a casual glance at Fiona Valentine, her lips curling into a faint, icy smile.

At the piano, Fiona sat with perfect posture, her fingers dancing across the keys. Suddenly, a sharp pain twisted through her abdomen.

Gurgle—

She bit down hard on her lower lip, sweat beading at her temples. The music stopped abruptly, replaced by an awkward, unmistakable sound.

The room fell silent.

Fiona's face flushed crimson. She stumbled off the stage, the whispers rising behind her like a tide.

"Oh my god, how embarrassing..."
"How is she ever going to face Sebastian now..."

The bathroom mirror reflected her disheveled state. Fiona crouched on the floor, burying her face in her arms.

"Need a tissue?"

Isabella stood behind her, holding out a handkerchief embroidered with gardenias. Fiona couldn't hold back anymore—she threw herself into Isabella's arms and sobbed.

"Don't rub your eyes with your sleeves." Isabella gently stopped her, dabbing the tears away with the silk handkerchief. "You'll hurt your skin."

When the crying subsided, Isabella asked casually, "Did you eat anything before going on stage?"

"I only had a sip of water..." Fiona froze. "Evelyn gave it to me!"

Just then, the stage lights blazed to life.

Evelyn Roland glided forward in a silver-blue mermaid gown, the sequins on her skirt shimmering like moonlight on waves.

Gasps rippled through the audience.

"Since when did she learn piano?" Alexander Roland gripped the armrests, tense.

Sophia Roland smiled warmly. "My daughter shines brightest wherever she stands."

Edward Roland patted his wife's hand, his gaze never leaving the figure on stage.
###Chapter 168

Isabella Langley's nails dug deep into her palms, yet she felt no pain.

Her burning gaze remained fixed on the grand piano at the center of the stage, eyes alight with bitter resentment.

This was supposed to be Evelyn Roland's moment of public humiliation.

How dare she steal everyone's attention the moment she returned?

Isabella took a sharp breath, forcing herself to stay composed.

Even if she couldn't ruin Evelyn's reputation within the family, she would at least make sure the entire school witnessed her downfall.

A cold smirk curled her lips at the thought.

Under the spotlight, Evelyn approached the piano with quiet grace.

Her slender fingers brushed the keys, and the auditorium fell into complete silence.

The first note rang out, and the audience collectively held their breath.

The music poured forth like moonlight—sometimes a gentle stream, other times a crashing wave.

When the final note faded, the hall remained utterly still.

Three seconds passed before thunderous applause erupted.

"That was professional-level mastery!"

"Absolutely breathtaking! I can't believe she's our classmate!"

Isabella's face drained of color.

She bit down on her lower lip until the metallic tang of blood filled her mouth.

Impossible. Her investigation confirmed Evelyn had never touched a piano.

"Evelyn, you were amazing!" Sophia Roland's eyes shimmered with proud tears.

Sebastian Valdemar's gaze never left the stage, a flicker of admiration in his eyes.

She had performed Liszt's notoriously difficult La Campanella with flawless precision.

"A true musical prodigy," Professor Liu from the music department declared. "This level could earn her direct admission to any conservatory."

The host turned to the judges with visible awe. "Please announce your scores."

Evelyn stood calmly under the spotlight, composed under waves of admiration and envy alike.

"Full marks!" Professor Liu raised his scorecard first. "Miss Roland, our department's doors are always open for you."

"Thank you, Professor." Evelyn gave a slight bow.

One perfect score after another lit up the panel.

Just as the championship seemed decided, Isabella swiftly sent a text.

As Evelyn prepared to exit, a bespectacled girl abruptly stood in the audience.

"I protest!"

The shrill accusation shattered the hall's harmony.
###Chapter 169

Whispers rippled through the auditorium.

All eyes were fixed on the center stage.

"Miss, please state your grounds for questioning."

The music department chair adjusted his glasses from the judges' panel.

"I've compared the recording with the original piece note by note. They're identical!"

A short-haired girl raised her phone, voice shrill.

She scanned the crowd deliberately. "Evelyn Roland isn't even a music major. How could she reach this level?"

The audience erupted.

"She's got a point..."

"An amateur playing like a virtuoso? Suspicious."

A bespectacled male student stood up. "I just checked the original audio. It's a perfect match."

Dozens of accusatory stares pierced the stage like arrows.

Evelyn stood calmly under the spotlight.

"Nonsense!" Isabella Langley shot up, voice trembling. "My sister's had musical talent since childhood!"

Her fists clenched, eyes reddening.

Evelyn caught the fleeting triumph in her sister's gaze.

Such amateur theatrics.

In the front row, the Roland parents wrung their hands.

"Alexander, do something!"

Alexander Roland frowned, at a loss.

"Prodigy? Who's she fooling?"

"Obviously pre-recorded!"

The jeers grew louder.

Someone pointed at the stage. "Evelyn Roland, your silence proves guilt!"

The room hushed.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly.

She approached the microphone, voice cool. "Accusations require evidence."

Her challengers faltered.

"Your identical performance is evidence!"

Evelyn chuckled. "That only proves I played it perfectly."

Sebastian Valdemar studied the two instigators through narrowed eyes.

Too orchestrated.

The bespectacled girl pressed on. "Then play it again live!"

"Gladly." Evelyn remained unruffled. "Perhaps you should check backstage first."

Murmurs spread through the crowd.

"She wouldn't agree if it were faked..."

"Maybe we misjudged her?"

Isabella paled.

Why were these fools wavering?

"Isabella, you look unwell."

Alexander's concern was evident.

"I..."
###Chapter 170

"Alexander, what's wrong?" Isabella Langley suddenly interrupted.

"Your expression just now..."

"What about my expression?" She tilted her head, feigning innocence.

Alexander Roland frowned. He'd clearly caught a flicker of jealousy in his sister's eyes. But it vanished as quickly as it appeared—almost like an illusion.

"Never mind."

Isabella's heart raced. Had he noticed? Impossible. Her mask was flawless.

She needed to change the subject.

"Mom, Dad," she turned to her parents with a worried look, "I'm so concerned about Evelyn. What if she really..." She trailed off deliberately.

On stage, Evelyn Roland watched coldly. Her sister was performing again.

The music professor slammed his hand on the table. "Evelyn couldn't have faked it! I saw her finger technique clearly!"

Warmth flickered in Evelyn's chest. At least someone was defending her honestly.

"Since there are doubts," she said calmly, "I can play it again. Or you may choose any piece from the same series at random."

The audience erupted in murmurs.

The same series? Those were professional-level compositions!

"Fine!" Isabella agreed eagerly, already anticipating Evelyn's humiliation.

Evelyn handed the microphone to the host and seated herself gracefully. Her slender fingers brushed the keys, and the familiar melody flowed once more.

Then, with seamless transition, she shifted into the audience's requested piece. Notes cascaded like a mountain spring, transporting everyone to a serene valley.

As the final note faded, silence gripped the hall.

Then thunderous applause exploded.

Sebastian Valdemar's lips curved. This woman never failed to surprise him.

Isabella's face turned ashen, her nails digging into her palms. She couldn't stay another second, excusing herself with claims of illness.

Fiona Valentine seethed. She'd hoped to see Evelyn humiliated, but instead the girl had shone brilliantly—even capturing Sebastian's attention.

After the gala, Evelyn sought out Fiona.

"Don't lose heart," she said gently. "There will be other opportunities."

"Thank you, senior." Fiona forced a smile, venom flashing in her eyes.

As the crowd dispersed, Evelyn rejoined her family.

"Evelyn!" Sophia Roland embraced her daughter tearfully. "I'm so proud of you!"

Edward and Alexander beamed with equal pride.
###Chapter 171

Edward Roland's eyes shimmered with pride. His daughter never ceased to amaze him.

From design to piano, and now medicine—each talent more dazzling than the last.

"Evelyn, come home with me. I'll cook your favorite dishes," Sophia Roland beamed, clasping her daughter's hand.

Evelyn retreated half a step with practiced grace, her lips curving into a gentle smile. "I have plans. You go ahead."

Alexander Roland frowned. "It's late. Let me drive you."

Unbeknownst to him, the once-distant brother had joined the ranks of doting siblings.

"No need. Just meeting a friend."

Sophia reluctantly released her grip. "Then... be careful."

A flicker of disappointment crossed her eyes. Edward gave his wife's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Give her space."

Sophia sighed inwardly. Some wounds from the past still hadn't healed.

From the shadows, Isabella Langley watched, her nails biting into her palms. Had she ever received such affection after graduation?

Blood truly was thicker than water.

Outside the venue, Evelyn's phone rang.

"Evelyn, where are you?" Bianca Savigny's cheerful voice chirped through the receiver.

"Almost there."

Evelyn quickened her pace toward the Starbucks near campus.

Pausing at the entrance, her sharp gaze swept the surroundings before she pushed the door open.

Even in casual attire, her flawless makeup turned every head in the café.

"Oh my god, it's Evelyn Roland—the campus queen!"

"She's even prettier in person..."

Amidst the whispers, Bianca sprang up, waving eagerly. "Evelyn!"

Settling into her seat, Evelyn cut straight to business. "What's your assessment of Château Blanc?"

Bianca's face fell. "The equipment's ancient... But upgrading requires massive funding..."

"Don't worry." Evelyn tapped the table lightly. "I'm already scouting new locations."

After delegating several tasks, she rose to leave.

Outside, Sebastian Valdemar narrowed his eyes from his Rolls-Royce.

That bartender again.

He'd seen this girl at another café weeks ago.

So Evelyn had deep ties to the mixology world.

The car door swung open as Sebastian unfolded his long legs.

Interesting.
###Chapter 172

Her stilettos had barely taken two steps when an elusive scent drifted into her nostrils.

Sebastian Valdemar paused mid-stride, his sharp gaze flashing with icy intensity.

"Mr. Valdemar~" Fiona Valentine's saccharine voice floated from behind.

He turned, the knife-edge crease of his suit trousers catching the light. "Miss Valentine."

The formal address made her fingers twitch.

The humiliation from the gala still burned like a splinter in her heart. Her clutch creaked under her grip, nails nearly piercing the leather. That bitch Evelyn Roland had ruined everything.

"Did I... look ridiculous tonight?" She lifted her tear-glazed eyes.

"An unfortunate mishap." His tone remained detached.

The rare consolation sent warmth through her chest. If he'd lowered himself to comfort her, did that mean...?

His chiseled profile looked even more striking under the neon lights, the sharp line of his Adam's apple disappearing into his starched collar. Her breath hitched. She would claim the title of Mrs. Valdemar—no matter what.

"Excuse me." Sebastian turned away.

The café window reflected an empty seat. His brow furrowed as he suppressed an inexplicable irritation.

——

The Valdemar Group's penthouse overlooked the city's glittering skyline.

"Enter."

Theodore Ashcroft stepped inside. "Château Laurent is officially listed. Every major player is watching."

A fountain pen slashed across documents with surgical precision. "Prepare the acquisition proposal."

The pen stilled abruptly. Images flashed through his mind—Evelyn's recent meetings with that bartender. What game was that woman playing?

——

Three days later, Château Laurent.

Black-suited guards stood like sentinels as a crimson carpet unfurled toward the vineyards.

A Maserati and Porsche arrived in succession. Evelyn emerged just as Sebastian's probing gaze locked onto her.

So she did show up.

His license plate registered in her peripheral vision, but she didn't break stride. The estate surpassed expectations—cobblestone paths led to oak-barrel cellars, while automated irrigation systems arced silver over the vines.

Her fingers trailed along stainless steel fermentation tanks, the cold metal making her eyes narrow. German engineering, fully automated production—this operation could dominate half of A City's wine market.

In the oak aging room, a 1982 Lafite glowed amber under spotlights. Evelyn's lips curved. This deal would be hers.
###Chapter 173

The sudden news of Henry Laurent's intention to sell Château Laurent sent a chill down Evelyn Roland's spine.

This vineyard was a goldmine. Why would he let it go?

As she pondered, a deep voice murmured beside her.

"This vineyard is indeed remarkable."

Sebastian Valdemar.

Evelyn whirled around, meeting those unfathomable dark eyes.

The man stood surrounded by sycophants, his lips curved in a distant smile. Their obsequious grins turned her stomach.

Her fingers tightened around her wineglass.

Sebastian's presence here was no coincidence.

It seemed the prized Château Laurent had already attracted a pack of wolves.

She had to act fast.

Evelyn sat alone in the corner, her gaze fixed on the entrance.

Finally, an elegant middle-aged man strode in.

Henry Laurent ascended the podium, his slightly hoarse voice echoing through the microphone.

"Thank you all for coming."

Polite applause followed.

"Selling the vineyard was not an easy decision." He paused. "My wife passed too soon, and my son's frail health requires overseas treatment."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"So that's why..."

"How tragic..."

Ignoring them, Henry announced the first challenge.

"Taste and tell."

With that, he turned and left.

Evelyn's eyes gleamed.

She moved swiftly to the wine racks, her fingers gliding over the bottles.

Sebastian's gaze burned into her back.

Since when did she know wine?

Without hesitation, she selected a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.

The perfect base.

With practiced ease, she added lemon juice and a few drops of a special spice blend.

Every drop measured to perfection.

This was her moment.

Other mixologists finished their creations one by one.

Henry sampled each, his frown deepening.

Until he lifted that deceptively simple glass of clear liquid.

The first sip made his fingers tremble.

Tart yet subtly salty, exactly like the lemonade his wife had made that summer long ago.

Memories crashed over him like a tidal wave.

Henry hastily set the glass down, his eyes reddening.

He looked at Evelyn with newfound intensity.

This wine held his most painful secret.
###Chapter 174

Henry Laurent's hand trembled slightly as he raised his glass, his eyes gleaming with disbelief.

"This flavor..."

The room fell silent.

He took a deep breath and announced in a booming voice, "This cocktail crafted by the young lady is the finest in the past decade!"

All eyes turned to Evelyn Roland in the corner.

"May I ask for your name, miss?"

"Evelyn Roland."

The name sent a ripple through the crowd. No one in the city's mixology scene had heard of her.

Sebastian Valdemar stood in the VIP booth on the second floor, his piercing gaze fixed on the slender figure below.

Henry's praise was considered the highest honor in the industry.

Tyler Macmillan slammed the table and stood abruptly. "What kind of joke is this? How could some nobody make anything decent?"

Skeptical murmurs spread.

"Did she get in through connections?"

"Since when does Château Laurent take shortcuts?"

Sebastian suddenly descended the staircase, his leather shoes clicking sharply against the marble floor.

He strode straight to Evelyn's mixing station and picked up the amber-hued drink.

The moment the liquid touched his tongue, his pupils constricted.

"Gentlemen." His voice was quiet, yet it silenced the room. "Before passing judgment, perhaps you should taste this first."

No one dared contradict the Valdemar heir.

But no one stepped forward either.

Evelyn smirked and pushed the glass forward. "Anyone who doubts me is welcome to try."

Henry rubbed his chin, amused. This girl had spirit.

Sebastian shook his head helplessly. Still as stubborn as ever.

"Since there's disagreement, let's have a rematch." Henry clapped his hands, and servers immediately brought out rare vintage bottles. "This round tests palate."

Tyler stepped up first, confidently lifting a glass. "Fifty-year aged reserve from Rivercrest."

Cheers erupted.

He shot Evelyn a challenging look. "Your turn, little girl."

In the shadows of the booth, Sebastian's lips curled into an intrigued smile.
###Chapter 175

Evelyn Roland traced the rim of her wineglass with slender fingers, her gaze deliberately avoiding Tyler Macmillan.

"This vintage completed its final fermentation at precisely 2 AM." She inhaled the bouquet. "A blend of Colorado Blue Grapes, Amethyst Grapes from the Western Ridge, and Moonlight Whites from the Southern Valley."

Every word was measured to chilling precision.

Tyler's knuckles whitened, his face turning ashen.

"Impossible!" He slammed the table. "Not even Bianca Savigny could achieve this. How could you?"

Henry Laurent frowned, about to interject, when murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Rumor has it Mr. Laurent is still single..."

"Such a stunning young woman..."

Sebastian Valdemar's eyes darkened dangerously. Just as he stepped forward, commotion erupted at the entrance.

"It's Bianca Savigny!"

A twin-tailed girl bounded through the gathering, her denim overalls swaying with each lively step.

"Evelyn!" She threw her arms around Evelyn's sleeve. "Are these people giving you trouble?"

Beads of sweat formed on Tyler's forehead.

Bianca spun to face the crowd, her expression uncharacteristically stern. "The technique I used to win the International Wine Tasting Championship? Evelyn taught me."

The room fell deathly silent.

"No way..." Tyler staggered back. "She couldn't possibly..."

Bianca smirked. "My mentor could identify the oak barrel origin of an '82 Lafite at thirteen. What makes you think you're qualified to question her?"

The man who'd earlier supported Tyler turned pale, his lips trembling uncontrollably.

Leaning against the bar, Sebastian allowed a faint smile to flicker in his eyes.
###Chapter 176

The café encounter was no coincidence after all.

I watched Tyler's contorted expression, fingertips lightly tapping the table. He'd never realize what kind of powerhouse he'd just provoked.

"Impossible!" Tyler staggered back, knocking over a barstool. "How old are you?"

Bianca rolled her eyes. "What, young people can't be masters? Update your antiquated thinking."

I stepped forward, my heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"Anything else to say?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. Beads of sweat glistened at his temples.

"Pathetic," I scoffed. "Losing with no grace."

Jeers erupted around us. Tyler's face turned from red to purple before he stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

The room fell silent. Every eye fixed on me like I was some rare artifact.

But I had no time for their stares.

Château Blanc—this was Sebastian's only chance at salvation.

"Mr. Laurent," someone called out, "shouldn't you announce the successor now?"

All heads swiveled toward Henry Laurent. Bianca tugged my sleeve excitedly. "Evelyn, we're saved!"

Yet my gaze locked onto Sebastian's icy profile. With him present, nothing would be straightforward.

True to form, Henry made an unexpected move.

"Gentlemen," he said, gesturing to rival vineyard representatives, "please join me."

Sebastian and I both stiffened.

"Explain." His voice could freeze hell.

I crossed my arms. "Care to clarify, Mr. Laurent?"

Henry mopped his brow. "Patience. Château Blanc has skill but lacks capital. Mr. Valdemar has funds but needs expertise. Alone, neither is ideal."

His eyes darted between us. "But together..."

"Done." We spoke in unison.

Henry's smile turned knowing. "Seems you two share history."

Our gazes collided like flint striking steel.

The irony stung. Just freed from jewelry empire entanglements, now shackled to this man again.

For the vineyard, I'd swallow my pride.
###Chapter 177

"Deal."

A dark glint flashed in Sebastian Valdemar's eyes. This game was becoming increasingly intriguing. Acquiring the vineyard would not only bring substantial profits but also peel back the layers of Evelyn Roland's enigmatic persona.

Henry Laurent rose to his feet. "Please follow me."

They walked through the grapevines, where several European-style villas nestled among the greenery. This place held Henry's life's work and deepest concern—his vineyard and his ailing only son.

"Have a seat."

The living room resembled a miniature wine museum. Beneath the crystal chandelier, rare vintages from around the world gleamed in glass cabinets. Even the coffee table had been crafted from a repurposed oak barrel.

Henry caressed a prized bottle of red. "I'll agree to the transfer, but two conditions must be written into the contract."

"First, you must maintain your partnership. If either party withdraws prematurely, I retain the right to repurchase at market value."

His tone brooked no argument.

"Second, the vineyard's name cannot be changed during my lifetime. After my death, you may do as you wish."

The terms weren't unreasonable.

Evelyn and Sebastian exchanged glances before nodding in unison.

Just as the pen was handed to Sebastian, a whistling sound cut through the air behind him. He twisted aside—a blade flashed past, wielded by a slight figure lunging at him.

"Look out!"

Contract pages scattered like leaves. The expected pain never came. Instead, Sebastian looked up to see Evelyn gripping the blade barehanded. Blood dripped from between her slender fingers, blooming crimson on the woolen carpet.

"Evelyn!"

Sebastian didn't recognize the tremor in his own voice. He moved like lightning, seizing the assailant's wrist and pinning them to the floor. The dagger clattered aside, revealing a tear-streaked face.

"Papa...papa..."

The boy repeated the word like a broken record.

Henry stumbled forward. "Please show mercy, Mr. Valdemar! This is my son, Hugo!"

Even as Sebastian released his grip, he positioned himself protectively in front of Evelyn, his gaze as alert as a stalking panther.

"You took a blade for me?" He ripped off his tie to bind her bleeding hand, tying an exaggerated bow. "Have you lost your mind?"

Henry hurried over with a first aid kit. Amid the antiseptic scent, Sebastian's fingers traced gentle circles on Evelyn's palm before securing the bandage.

"Can't let my business partner die," Evelyn flexed her hand. "Not when my vineyard's at stake."

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed. "Director Roland...your dedication is...commendable."

The bloodstained contract was unusable now.

Henry bowed repeatedly. "I beg you not to call the police. Ever since his illness—"

Before he could finish, Evelyn crouched before the boy.

The teenager's pupils were dilated, his arms studded with needle marks. Suddenly, she yanked his collar aside—revealing a spider-shaped birthmark on his neck.
###Chapter 178

The boy's gaze swept over Evelyn Roland without a flicker of emotion.

Yet the moment his eyes landed on Sebastian Valdemar, his pupils constricted violently. His entire face contorted in an instant.

"Kill! You die!"

The hoarse child's voice exploded through the living room. Henry Laurent gripped his son's shoulders in shock.

"Hugo?"

This was the first complete sentence his son had uttered since falling ill.

Evelyn lightly pressed a fingertip to the boy's forehead.

The agitated Hugo suddenly stilled, tilting his small face upward in confusion.

"Hugo," she murmured softly.

Henry's head snapped up. "How did you know—"

"The 'Hugo' series fruit wines from your vineyard." Evelyn twirled a strand of the boy's hair between her fingers. "Quite a distinctive paternal tribute."

Sebastian lounged in the leather sofa, watching as the woman expertly lifted the child's eyelids.

"Not psychosis," she declared abruptly.

Her fingers traced the boy's neck, pausing over a slightly swollen lymph node.

"Chronic ricin poisoning."

Henry staggered backward, knocking over a crystal glass on the coffee table.

"Impossible..."

Sebastian was already striding toward the door.

"His bedroom."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow in surprise.

The man turned, his black trench coat slicing through the air.

"Poisoners don't chase their victims around to administer doses daily."

Henry collapsed to his knees.

"Miss Roland!" His forehead struck the marble floor with a sickening crack. "Save Hugo—"

A bead of blood welled at his temple.

The fourteen-year-old boy lay docile as a fledgling in Evelyn's arms—until Sebastian's retreating figure entered his line of sight.

"Kill!"

The scream tore from his ravaged vocal cords. Sebastian paused, then slowly turned with narrowed eyes.

"Interesting."

He advanced toward the boy, bending down until their faces were level.

"Do I know you?"

Hugo began convulsing violently. Evelyn immediately pressed her thumb to his Baihui point.

"Stop provoking him!"

When the housekeeper arrived in haste, she found Sebastian systematically examining the boy's pillow.

"Mr. Laurent," the middle-aged woman stammered, "I personally handle young master's bedding—"

Evelyn suddenly snatched up a stuffed bear from the bedside.

Brown powder sifted through a split seam, dusting her palm as cotton stuffing spilled out.

"Found it."
###Chapter 179

The wooden door creaked open with a piercing sound.

The walls were covered with distorted paintings in unsettling, unnatural colors.

Evelyn Roland's fingertips lightly traced the canvas, feeling the uneven texture of dried paint.

Sebastian Valdemar narrowed his eyes, observing her focused expression.

The artworks were dominated by clashing shades of green and black, with brushstrokes so chaotic they bordered on madness.

As a professional designer, Evelyn possessed an acute sensitivity to art.

Each painting depicted the same recurring scene - a woman being forcibly administered medication.

"Mommy..."

Hugo Laurent suddenly choked back a sob, tears welling in his eyes.

Sebastian and Evelyn exchanged a knowing glance.

"Mr. Laurent," Evelyn said softly, "Your wife's death... may not have been an accident."

Henry Laurent froze as if struck by lightning, his face turning deathly pale.

"That's impossible..." he muttered unconsciously, his fingers tightening into fists.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway. Evelyn immediately raised a warning finger.

"Stay calm," she whispered.

The housekeeper entered carrying a wooden tray with a recipe book and utensils.

Evelyn casually picked up a utensil and sniffed it discreetly.

The recipe pages rustled in her hands.

"Prunes every week?" She arched an eyebrow.

The housekeeper kept her head down, shoulders trembling almost imperceptibly.

Meanwhile, Sebastian noticed something on the bed.

"The doll's hands have discolored," he said gravely.

Evelyn hurried over to examine it.

Henry followed anxiously.

"My doll! Give me my doll!"

Hugo suddenly lunged forward with terrifying ferocity.

Sebastian swiftly shielded Evelyn with his body.

"Evil people!" Hugo shrieked hysterically. "I'll kill you all!"

In the corner, the housekeeper stood frozen, her back drenched in cold sweat.
###Chapter 180
Before Henry Laurent could finish speaking, Hugo suddenly became agitated again, his eyes bloodshot as he lunged toward Evelyn Roland.

Sebastian Valdemar reacted swiftly, stepping in front of Evelyn in a flash.

But Evelyn gently pushed him aside and pressed a fingertip to Hugo’s forehead.

Hugo instantly stilled, his gaze clearing as the haze lifted.

Henry rushed forward to steady his son, his face etched with guilt. "Miss Roland, I sincerely apologize—"

"It’s fine." Evelyn waved him off, her attention shifting to the tattered doll on the floor.

She picked it up and brought it to her nose, inhaling lightly.

Her frown deepened.

"Something wrong?" Sebastian asked, immediately sensing her unease.

"White Lotus," Evelyn said coldly. "A hallucinogenic drug."

Henry paled. "What?"

"This substance changes color when exposed to cotton fabric." She flipped open the recipe book. "Combined with prunes, it causes neurological deterioration."

Henry whirled around, glaring at the nanny. "How dare you—"

"Sir, I swear I didn’t know!" The nanny dropped to her knees, trembling. "I had no idea!"

Evelyn approached slowly, the sharp click of her heels echoing through the room.

Beads of sweat formed on the nanny’s forehead.

"You’re lying." Evelyn gripped her chin. "Shall I make you tell the truth?"

The nanny gasped in pain.

Just then, a figure burst into the room.

"Brother, is Hugo alright?" The man’s face was frantic with worry.

Henry blinked in surprise. "Vincent? What are you doing here?"

Evelyn studied the newcomer with keen interest.

She noticed the way his eyes flickered toward the nanny—just for a split second.

How intriguing.

This master-servant pair was definitely hiding something.
###Chapter 181

"Henry, what's this maid doing on the floor?" Vincent Laurent feigned shock, his eyes flickering with panic as he looked at his brother.

Henry Laurent gave a concise account of the incident.

"What? A lowly servant dared to poison Hugo?" Vincent's voice rose sharply in manufactured rage.

Slap! A resounding blow landed on the maid's face.

Evelyn Roland inhaled sharply. The maid's left cheek swelled instantly, a trickle of blood seeping from her lip.

"Hugo is my beloved nephew! How dare you harm him? I'll kill you for this!" Vincent's face twisted with fury as he lunged to drag the maid away.

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Sebastian Valdemar.

Sebastian moved like lightning, seizing Vincent's wrist.

"What are you doing?" Vincent yelped in pain.

The exaggerated reaction only confirmed Evelyn's suspicions.

"Before beating her, shouldn't we find out who's really behind this?" Evelyn stepped forward, her tone deceptively light.

"Who do you think you are? This is Laurent family business!" Vincent snarled.

Henry snapped, "Vincent! Mind your manners with our guest." He turned to Evelyn. "Miss Roland makes a valid point."

Sebastian released his grip, wiping his palm with visible disgust.

Vincent's eyes flashed with venom as he shot the maid a warning glare.

Evelyn caught every microexpression.

"Why so agitated, Mr. Laurent?" Her lips curved in a knowing smile.

"Would you stay calm if your nephew were poisoned?" Vincent ground out.

Evelyn ignored him, her gaze locking onto the trembling maid.

Henry understood. "Name your employer," he commanded, "or I'll hand you over to Miss Roland."

The maid shook violently, her teeth drawing blood from her lip.

"It...it was Mr. Vincent Laurent..." she finally sobbed. "He wanted the young master dead...to claim the vineyard inheritance..."

The air turned to ice.

"Vincent!" Henry's eyes burned crimson, like an enraged lion.

Cornered, Vincent suddenly grabbed a silver fork from the dining table and lunged at Evelyn. "You bitch! Die!"

The tines flashed toward Evelyn's heart—

Sebastian caught the fork's handle mid-air, his gaze glacial. "You're dead."

Vincent threw a punch at Sebastian's face while sweeping his leg.

Sebastian took the hit and flipped Vincent over his shoulder, slamming him onto the floor.

Vincent scrambled up and charged at Evelyn again.

In the chaos, Evelyn stumbled backward, knocking over a side table.
###Chapter 182

Evelyn Roland gasped sharply as fresh blood seeped through her freshly bandaged wound.

Her gaze locked onto Vincent Laurent, pinned to the ground by Sebastian Valdemar. "Vincent! Did you kill your sister-in-law?"

"Bullshit!" Vincent's eyes burned crimson as he thrashed like a caged beast. "I didn't touch her!"

Sebastian's brow furrowed. Noticing Evelyn's bloodied bandage, he increased the pressure on Vincent's arm.

A sickening crack echoed through the room.

"Argh!" Vincent howled like a slaughtered pig, his right arm now limp.

"You'll all die!" he shrieked hysterically. "Just like that bitch!"

Henry Laurent's face darkened with rage, veins bulging at his temples.

Bam!

His fist connected with Vincent's face, sending two bloodied teeth flying.

"After everything I've done for you!" Henry panted, knuckles white. "You murdered my wife! You hurt my son! Are you even human?"

"Mr. Laurent!" Evelyn stepped between them. "Don't dirty your hands with trash."

"Daddy..." Hugo's trembling voice came from behind.

Henry froze, then turned to scoop his pale-faced son into his arms. "It's okay now. Daddy's here."

The boy curled into his father's embrace, shaking.

Sebastian planted his foot on Vincent's back as the man tried to crawl away. "Stay put."

The three adults exited, Henry locking the door behind them like a man drained of all vitality.

"Thank you both." His voice was hoarse as he bowed deeply.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Then Hugo collapsed.

"Miss Roland!" Henry panicked.

Evelyn knelt, fingers finding the boy's pulse. "Just shock. He'll be fine."

A silver needle flashed over candlelight before finding its mark.

Thirty minutes later, she withdrew the last needle. "Three more sessions for full recovery."

"Really?" Henry's eyes welled up. "I'll give you the vineyard!"

Sebastian arched a brow at Evelyn.

"No need." Her refusal was crisp. "My arrangement with Mr. Valdemar stands."

Amusement flickered in Sebastian's eyes.

This woman never ceased to surprise him.

Night breeze played with Evelyn's hair as they left the estate.

"That doll," she suddenly stopped. "How did you know?"

Sebastian's lips curved slightly before he melted into the shadows.

The moonlight kept his secret.
###Chapter 183: An Unexpected Invitation to the Valdemar Mansion

Evelyn Roland had just unrolled her design sketches when her phone rang abruptly.

The screen flashed "Olivia Valdemar."

"Evelyn!" Olivia's frantic voice came through the receiver. "I finally got through to you."

"What's wrong, Olivia?"

"Sebastian has a high fever, but he refuses to go to the hospital." Anxiety laced Olivia's words. "Could you come take a look?"

Evelyn suppressed an eye roll. The mighty CEO of Valdemar Group was acting like a petulant child over an illness.

Thirty minutes later, a taxi pulled up to the Valdemar estate.

The moment Evelyn pushed open the heavy carved doors, a chill swept over her, making her shiver. The mansion was eerily silent, the plush carpets swallowing even the sound of footsteps.

"Miss Roland, please wait here." The butler gave a slight bow. "I'll inform the young mistress."

Evelyn glanced around. The vast living room was empty except for a few servants moving quietly about their tasks.

"Evelyn!" Olivia came rushing down the spiral staircase in loose loungewear, a stark contrast to the cold opulence around her. She grabbed Evelyn's hand. "Come with me."

At the end of the third-floor hallway, Evelyn froze in the doorway.

On the nightstand, a familiar Booker doll tilted its head at her.

"That was the last gift Mother gave Sebastian before she passed," Olivia explained softly, following Evelyn's gaze. Her voice dropped. "After our parents' car accident... his condition worsened."

Evelyn's heart clenched.

A phone ring shattered the silence. Olivia checked the screen, her face apologetic. "I have to go for my prenatal checkup—"

"Go ahead." Evelyn gave a reassuring nod. "I'll take care of things here."

When the door closed, only Sebastian's labored breathing filled the room.

He lay curled under black satin sheets, beads of sweat glistening on his forehead. Evelyn gently placed a cooling patch on his brow and dabbed his feverish neck with a damp towel.

As she reached to replace the patch, a burning hand suddenly seized her wrist.

"Don't go..." Sebastian murmured in his delirium. "Mother... I'm scared..."

Evelyn went completely still. The ruthless business titan now looked as vulnerable as a lost child.
###Chapter 184: Fevered Epiphany

Sebastian Valdemar's sleeping face looked unusually vulnerable in the dim lamplight. A thin sheen of sweat glistened on his fever-flushed skin. His thick lashes cast shadows beneath his closed eyes, brows furrowed as if trapped in an inescapable nightmare.

Evelyn Roland sat by the bed, fingers absently tracing the edge of the blanket. Olivia's words about enduring pain alone in the dead of night echoed in her mind, tightening her chest. That feeling of suffering without support—she knew it too well.

"Don't be afraid," she whispered, smoothing the crease between his brows with her fingertips.

Sebastian's breathing gradually steadied.

At dawn's first light, his fingers twitched. His eyes fluttered open to find his hand enveloped in warmth. Following the slender fingers upward, he met Evelyn's clear gaze.

He jerked his hand back, ears burning crimson.

"Your sister sent me," Evelyn said quickly, pretending not to notice his fluster. "Feeling better?"

"Mhm." His voice came out rough, Adam's apple bobbing as he avoided her eyes.

She handed him water, watching the droplet that escaped his lips trail down his throat and disappear beneath his collar.

"Thanks." His knuckles whitened around the emptied glass.

"You're welcome." She leaned in abruptly. "But there's a condition."

Sebastian recoiled against the headboard, her faint medicinal scent flooding his senses, stealing his breath.

"I need to draw blood." Straightening, she produced a syringe from the medical kit.

His pupils contracted at the intimidating needle's size. Jaw tightening, he extended his arm. "Do it."

When steel pierced skin, his teeth clenched. Sweat beaded at his temples—yet watching Evelyn's focused profile somehow dulled the pain.

"Done." She secured the bandage with practiced efficiency. "I'll notify you of the results."

As she packed her equipment, Sebastian spoke suddenly: "Château Laurent's profits are yours. I'll cover all treatment costs."

Evelyn turned, arching a brow. "Generous offer."

"Worth it." The words were soft but deliberate.

Night deepened, but Aether Medical Lab's lights remained on. Evelyn froze at the microscope, fingertips turning icy. The blood analysis report glared back—White Lotus compounds. Impossible.
###Chapter 185: A Sting of Sourness

A sharp pang of pain pricked at Evelyn Roland's chest.

She remembered with perfect clarity—this necklace had been a gift from Sebastian Valdemar's mother, as Olivia Valdemar herself had declared.

Evelyn took a deep breath, forcing down the surge of emotions. Her lab coat lay discarded over the chair. Rubbing her temples, she turned and walked into the laboratory's break room.

The next morning.

Dawn had barely broken when Evelyn awoke. With only a few finishing touches left on her design sketches, she washed up quickly and headed straight to CH Jewelry Inc.

At a nearby café, Vanessa Valrose sipped her latte leisurely. A familiar figure flashed past the window.

Wait—was that Evelyn?

Vanessa slammed down her cup and rushed outside. But the street was already empty.

For the next few days, Vanessa camped outside CH Jewelry like a paparazzo. When Evelyn appeared again, she snapped a photo instantly.

"Got you," Vanessa smirked, her fingers flying across her phone as she typed a message.

"Isabella! Guess what juicy scoop I just uncovered!"

Inside a shopping mall, Isabella Langley's phone buzzed incessantly. Her pupils dilated as she opened the message.

The photo clearly showed Evelyn entering and exiting CH Jewelry.

"Cousin, you're amazing!" Isabella replied, barely containing her excitement before dialing a number.

Dinnertime.

Isabella's gaze clung to Evelyn like a venomous snake. Sensing the hostility, Evelyn frowned slightly.

"Dad. Mom." Isabella suddenly stood, her voice dripping with feigned hesitation.

Every head at the table turned.

Evelyn scoffed and continued eating gracefully. What drama was this woman concocting now?

"I... I just think it's unfair to Alexander," Isabella said, throwing a挑衅 look at Evelyn.

She pulled a stack of photos from her bag and slammed them onto the table.

The images unmistakably captured Evelyn's comings and goings at CH Jewelry.

The air in the dining room froze.

"Isn't my sister a designer?" Isabella pretended to be heartbroken. "With our family's company struggling, why is she spending all her time at a competitor?"

Edward Roland's face paled as he stared at the photos.

"Evelyn, what is this...?" Sophia Roland trailed off, her expression unreadable.

"How could our family raise such a traitor?" Isabella fanned the flames. "While Alexander works late every night, you—"

A glacial glare cut her off mid-sentence.

Evelyn's eyes were sharp as daggers.

"What exactly do you mean by this, sister?" Isabella forced a defiant tone. "Did I say something wrong?"

Hah. Let's see you talk your way out of this one!
###Chapter 186: The Air Froze

Isabella Langley's words hung in the air, plunging the living room into dead silence.

Evelyn Roland's lips curled into a mocking smile.

"You seem to have overlooked one crucial detail."

Isabella shivered under that piercing gaze. Those sharp eyes seemed capable of seeing straight through her, exposing every hidden thought.

"W-what detail?" She instinctively took half a step back.

"Is there any problem with me entering my own company?"

Isabella's pupils constricted violently. "What do you mean?"

Evelyn leisurely pulled out her phone and displayed an electronic document. "CH Jewelry. Mine."

The screen clearly showed the corporate registration information, with Evelyn's photo and name prominently displayed.

"Evelyn!" Alexander Roland stood up excitedly. "You're the founder of CH?"

"Mhm." She responded casually.

The room erupted.

"My daughter is amazing!" Sophia Roland's eyes welled up with proud tears.

"We never properly thanked you for the KL incident." Alexander rubbed his hands together, suddenly realizing their 90-10 profit split had been an enormous favor. Without his sister's intervention, that astronomical penalty...

"Family doesn't keep score."

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. Impossible! How could that bitch be CH's CEO? She forced a smile. "I'm sorry, sis. I was just worried about big brother..."

Her head bowed in false contrition, but her gaze remained locked onto Evelyn.

"Isabella!" Sophia frowned. "Making accusations without knowing the facts is unacceptable."

"This can't happen again." Mr. Roland's expression darkened.

Isabella gritted her teeth through the apology, secretly wishing she could tear that composed face to shreds.

Sophia watched her adopted daughter's insincere expression with growing unease. She hadn't forgotten those divisive words earlier...

Evelyn's attention, however, was entirely focused on the photos on the coffee table.

These surveillance shots... didn't seem like Olivia Valdemar's style.

She narrowed her eyes. This required investigation.

Back in her bedroom, her fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk.

Over thirty photos spanning nearly two months. Someone had been very patient.

A cold laugh escaped her lips as she dialed a number. "Dylan Orlando."

"Boss?"

"Trace the source of these." She sent the file package. "After two months of stalking, they're bound to have slipped up."

A sharp intake of breath came through the phone. "Someone's been tailing you for two months?"
###Chapter 187: Data Storm

"Don't worry, boss. You'll have the results within 48 hours."

Dylan Orlando's crisp response drew a faint smile from Evelyn Roland.

"Good."

Hanging up, Evelyn leaned back in her leather chair, staring absently at the ceiling.

"So you want to play games with me?"

The investigation results came swiftly—Vanessa Valrose.

Evelyn's brow arched slightly at the name.

She had never met this female CEO of a statistics firm.

"Dig deeper into her background."

In less than ten minutes, Dylan sent over a detailed dossier.

A notification chimed on her computer.

Evelyn opened the file, her eyes scanning each line like a precision instrument.

A statistics company? Their most valuable asset was data.

If you dared to provoke the wrong person, you'd better be prepared to pay the price.

Her slender fingers flew across the keyboard as data streams receded like tides on the screen.

"Game on."

Two minutes later, Evelyn closed her laptop and stretched.

Meanwhile, chaos erupted at Valrose Enterprises.

"All our data is gone!"

The director stared at the empty screen, face ashen.

Vanessa's computer was equally blank—even the backups had vanished without a trace.

She collapsed into her chair, nails digging into her palms.

"It's over..."

Evelyn's coldly beautiful face flashed through her mind.

Vanessa suddenly stood, grabbing her purse and rushing out.

"Cousin! Help me!"

Isabella Langley jumped at Vanessa's abrupt intrusion.

After hearing the story, Isabella gently took her hand.

"Don't worry. I'll talk to my sister."

Vanessa left with relief.

But what awaited her was an even crueler blow.

"I'm sorry, cousin..." Isabella wept. "My sister...won't forgive you..."

Vanessa's world crumbled.

On the day her company declared bankruptcy, she stood in the empty office, hatred burning in her eyes.

"Evelyn Roland, you'll pay for this in blood!"

A week later.

Evelyn retrieved her treasured rosewood acupuncture case, the silver needles glinting coldly under the light.

After sterilizing them, she drove to the Laurent estate.

As she stepped out of the car, a black Rolls-Royce came into view.
###Chapter 188: The Familiar Black Maybach

A sleek black Maybach glided into the gated community.

My eyes locked onto the license plate number. It looked hauntingly familiar.

The door opened, and Sebastian Valdemar stepped out with effortless grace. His tall frame was accentuated by a charcoal-gray suit.

"Miss Roland, what a coincidence."

A faint smirk played on his lips as his gaze settled on me.

The crisp scent of mint wafted from him, making my pulse quicken inexplicably.

"What brings you here, Mr. Valdemar?"

I forced composure, subtly retreating half a step.

"Heard you were coming to check on Hugo today. Thought I'd drop by."

His Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he spoke, but his eyes never left my face.

My ears burned. I quickly changed the subject. "Shall we go in together?"

Henry Laurent had been waiting at the entrance. His face lit up when he saw us. "Dr. Roland! Mr. Valdemar! You're here!"

Hugo's room was noticeably tidier than last time.

The eerie doll by the bedside was gone, just as I'd instructed.

"This treatment might be intense," I warned, preparing my silver needles. "But the results should be significant."

Henry wrung his hands nervously. "We trust your expertise completely."

As I inserted the needles, I felt Sebastian's intense stare.

He stood by the window, sunlight gilding his silhouette. Something unreadable flickered in those deep-set eyes.

Thirty minutes later, Hugo's eyelids fluttered open.

"Hugo!" Henry rushed to the bed, voice trembling.

The boy blinked, then suddenly threw his arms around his father. He tried to speak, but only managed strained sounds.

"Don't worry—that's normal," I reassured them. "His vocal cords need time to heal."

Hugo suddenly slid off the bed and clung to my leg.

He pointed frantically at the window, stamping his feet in excitement.

Sebastian crouched to his level. "Want to go outside?"

The boy nodded vigorously, eyes shining like constellations.

I couldn't resist ruffling his hair. "When you're better, I'll take you to Disneyland."

Henry stood nearby, eyes glistening. The fear he'd once harbored toward Sebastian was nowhere to be seen.

"Dr. Roland, words can't express my gratitude."

He bowed deeply, voice thick with emotion.

As I helped him up, I caught Sebastian watching me. The tenderness in his gaze sent an unexpected tremor through my chest.
###Chapter 189: The Sudden Silence

"Q...Hugo!" Henry Laurent quickly pulled his son close, his expression darkening. "Stop bothering Miss Roland."

The little boy's eyes instantly welled up with tears, his lower lip trembling.

Evelyn Roland felt her heart soften.

Those moist puppy-dog eyes reminded her of her neighbor's newborn golden retriever.

"I happen to be free today." She crouched down to meet Hugo at eye level. "Would you like to go to the amusement park?"

Hugo's eyes lit up like fireworks.

He peeked shyly at his father, tiny fingers twisting the hem of his shirt.

"This is too much trouble for you," Henry said hesitantly.

"No trouble at all." Evelyn straightened up. "It'll help with his recovery."

Sebastian Valdemar suddenly spoke. "I'm coming too."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

What was this man scheming now?

"Mr. Valdemar, surely you're too busy—"

"Safety in numbers." Sebastian cut her off, his gaze heavy.

Hugo suddenly tugged at Evelyn's skirt.

Looking up with pleading eyes, he nodded vigorously.

"Then it's settled." Evelyn bent to scoop Hugo into her arms.

The boy immediately wrapped his arms around her neck.

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed as he stared at the dimple in her cheek.

"I'll have the car brought around." He turned to make the call.

Ten minutes later.

A black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided to a stop.

The chauffeur respectfully opened the rear door.

Sebastian motioned for Evelyn to enter first.

"Thank you." She climbed in with Hugo in her arms.

The man followed, settling into the backseat beside them.

The cabin filled with the faint scent of cedarwood.

Hugo pressed his nose against the window, eyes wide.

"First time at an amusement park?" Evelyn asked softly.

The boy nodded eagerly.

She ruffled his soft curls.

As the car entered the parking lot, distant screams from rollercoasters already filled the air.
###Chapter 190: Doe-like Eyes

Hugo's large, round eyes darted around with childlike wonder.

Evelyn Roland and Sebastian Valdemar stepped into the amusement park, instantly drawing admiring glances. Their striking looks made them stand out in the crowd.

"Is that a celebrity filming something?"
"That little boy is adorable—like an angel!"

The murmurs of passersby reached their ears. They were accustomed to such attention and paid it no mind.

Evelyn kept glancing down at Hugo, worried the lively atmosphere might overwhelm him.

Suddenly, the little boy froze in place.

"What is it?" Evelyn followed his gaze.

Hugo was staring intently at a nearby candy apple stand, his eyes unblinking.

"Do you want one?" Evelyn asked softly.

He nodded eagerly, swallowing hard.

A long line stretched before the stand. Before Evelyn could speak, Sebastian stepped forward. "Wait here."

Watching his tailored suit disappear into the crowd, Evelyn felt a flutter in her chest.

"Help! Somebody!"
"Call security!"

A piercing scream shattered the air.

Evelyn turned to see a man in a hospital gown wildly brandishing a shard of glass through the crowd.

Sebastian rushed back with the candy apple, shielding them both.

Amid the chaos, someone shoved Evelyn hard.

As she stumbled, a strong arm caught her waist.

They stood so close she could hear his heartbeat. Her cheeks burned as she hastily stepped back.

Sebastian's fingers absently flexed, as if savoring the lingering warmth.

"Where's Hugo?" Evelyn gasped.

"A child was taken!" someone shouted in the distance.

Her heart lurched. Through the panicked crowd, she spotted Hugo—held hostage by the deranged man.

"Die! All of you!" The man screamed hysterically, keeping everyone at bay.

"They say he escaped from the psychiatric hospital nearby."
"Call the police—now!"

The crowd buzzed with fear. Evelyn's fingertips turned to ice.
###Chapter 191: The Madwoman's Threat

The sunlight was blinding.

Sebastian Valdemar gripped Evelyn Roland's trembling wrist. "Don't be afraid. We'll get Hugo back."

The shard of glass glinted dangerously in the madwoman's hand.

They exchanged a glance, but before they could react, the woman suddenly bolted with Hugo in her arms.

"After her!"

Evelyn's heart pounded so hard it threatened to burst from her chest.

After several turns, they were led to the most desolate corner of the amusement park.

The woman whirled around, the jagged glass aimed at their throats.

"Let's talk this through," Evelyn stepped forward, softening her voice.

"Liar! You're all out to get me!" The woman let out a hysterical laugh, her eyes unfocused.

Sebastian moved silently behind her.

"Why would we hurt you?" Evelyn inched closer. "Put the glass down, okay?"

The woman suddenly snarled, "Tell me! Do I look crazy to you?"

The shout made Evelyn's ears ring.

"You're perfectly fine," she steadied her breathing. "Careful, you might cut yourself."

The woman glanced down at the weapon in her hand.

Now!

Sebastian lunged forward, kicking the woman to the ground.

Evelyn seized the chance to scoop Hugo into her arms.

"It's okay, I've got you," she murmured, feeling the child's small body tremble violently against her.

After checking Hugo for injuries, she exhaled in relief.

A ragged gasp came from behind.

Hugo's eyes widened, his face pale. "S-sister! Behind you!"

Evelyn froze—this was the first time she'd heard Hugo speak a full sentence.

"What?"

"The crazy lady has a brick!" The child cried out.

Evelyn spun around.

The madwoman charged at them, a brick raised high above her head, her face twisted with rage.

She was only a step away.
###Chapter 192

The last golden rays of the setting sun streamed through the car window, casting a warm glow on Evelyn Roland's profile.

Hugo suddenly wrenched his hand free and darted across the street.

"Watch out!" A screech of brakes pierced the air.

At the critical moment, Hugo yanked Evelyn's sleeve, pulling her back onto the sidewalk.

An out-of-control electric bike whizzed past, grazing the hem of her skirt.

"You bitch!" A disheveled woman tumbled off the bike, brandishing a fruit knife as she lunged toward them.

Sebastian Valdemar sprang forward, his long fingers clamping around the woman's wrist with precision.

A sharp snap echoed as the knife clattered to the ground.

"Let me go! I'll kill her!" The woman thrashed hysterically, her nails raking bloody streaks down Sebastian's arm.

His eyes turned icy. In three swift motions, he twisted his tie around her wrists, binding them behind her back.

"Are you hurt?" When he turned, his shirt cuff was already soaked with blood.

Evelyn shook her head, her gaze fixed on Hugo. "Hugo, you—"

"Big sister, your dress is dirty." Hugo tilted his small face up, his voice as clear as morning dew.

Both froze.

Evelyn knelt, her fingers trembling slightly. "You... just spoke?"

Hugo blinked his large eyes before breaking into a radiant smile. "Mm! I can talk now!"

Sirens wailed in the distance.

The setting sun stretched their three shadows long across the pavement, intertwining them into a warm silhouette.

On the ride back, Evelyn kept nodding off.

"Get some rest." Sebastian shrugged off his suit jacket and handed it to her.

She murmured drowsily before her head lolled against the window.

Frowning, Sebastian carefully lifted Hugo onto the opposite seat.

Then, with deliberate gentleness, he cradled the back of Evelyn's head and guided it to rest on his shoulder.

The faint scent of gardenias enveloped him.

He glanced down. Her lashes cast delicate shadows under her eyes, and for a moment, his breath hitched.

"We're here." The driver's voice snapped him out of his daze.

Evelyn rubbed her eyes awake, flushing crimson when she realized she'd been leaning on Sebastian.

"I—"

"My jacket." He turned away, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Don't forget to return it."

Evelyn looked down at the folded suit in her arms, still carrying the faint aroma of cedarwood.
###Chapter 193

Evelyn handed Sebastian his coat, her fingertips accidentally brushing against his wrist. She froze for a split second before quickly withdrawing her hand.

When had she become so careless? Falling asleep in someone else's car. She frowned, absently rubbing the cuff of her sleeve.

"We're here." Sebastian's voice snapped her out of her thoughts. He stepped out smoothly and opened the passenger door for her.

The manor was ablaze with lights. Henry Laurent had prepared dinner long ago and was waiting for them.

Evelyn held Hugo's hand and gently nudged him forward. "Hugo, say hello."

"D...Dad?" The boy's timid voice was like a pebble dropped into still water.

Henry's teacup slipped from his fingers and shattered on the floor. He stood frozen, as if struck by a spell.

The next moment, a small figure barreled into his arms.

"Dad!" This time, the voice was clear and bright.

Henry sank to his knees, his hands trembling as they cradled the child's face. "Say it... one more time?"

"I can talk now!" Hugo beamed up at him, eyes shining with pride.

Evelyn watched from the side, warmth flooding her chest. Her gaze instinctively sought Sebastian, catching the faint smile playing on his lips.

"It's like a dream..." Henry choked out, pulling the boy close as tears finally spilled over.

Suddenly, the formidable business tycoon dropped to his knees and bowed deeply.

"Don't!" Sebastian moved swiftly to stop him.

But Henry pressed his forehead to the ground. "No words can express my gratitude. From today onward, Hugo is your child too!"

Evelyn rushed forward to help him up, only to have something cold pressed into her palm.

It was an exquisitely crafted key, its metal surface gleaming under the lights.

"This is the lifeblood of the winery." Henry's voice was hoarse. "I trust you with it."

Evelyn's hand grew heavy. This key represented the Laurent family's century-old secret recipes—a coveted business secret many would kill for.

She looked up at Sebastian, seeing the same surprise reflected in his eyes.

"Once Hugo recovers further, I'll take him traveling the world." Henry lifted his son with a peaceful smile. "The winery... is in your hands now."

The key grew warm in her palm. Evelyn suddenly understood—this wasn't just trust. It was an immense responsibility.
###Chapter 194

Evelyn Roland tightened her grip on the key and looked up at Sebastian Valdemar.

"We'll keep this key together," she said.

Sebastian slid his hands into his pockets, his expression indifferent.

"I have no interest in wine."

"Partnership requires sincerity," she insisted.

The corner of his lips curved slightly.

"My sincerity is trusting you."

Evelyn's fingers twitched before she tucked the key back into her bag.

As she stepped out of the winery, her phone buzzed. The screen displayed "Professor Jameson, Stanford University."

"Evelyn!" The voice on the other end was effervescent. "The International Piano Masters competition is about to begin—"

She halted mid-step.

"Not interested," she cut in bluntly.

Outside the office, Felix Valentine happened to pass by. The words "piano competition" made his ears perk up.

"Fiona Valentine..." he murmured, eyes glazing over with infatuation.

The moment the call ended, he eagerly knocked on the door.

"Professor Jameson, I recommend Fiona Valentine for the competition!"

The professor adjusted his glasses.

"Is she skilled enough?"

"Absolutely top-tier!" Felix thumped his chest. "Far better than Evelyn Roland!"

Professor Jameson pondered briefly. Remembering the sting of rejection, he slammed his desk.

"She's in!"

Felix beamed, already envisioning Fiona's grateful smile.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood at a crosswalk.

The red light flashed. As cars streamed past, Sebastian's enigmatic gaze flickered through her mind.

There was something in those depths she couldn't decipher.
###Chapter 195

"Don't worry, Professor Jameson. I'll handle this." Felix Valentine thumped his chest before darting out the door.

He sprinted toward the music building in long strides.

"Fiona!"

Fiona Valentine was packing her sheet music when she heard her name. She looked up to see Felix with his garish rainbow hair, earrings glinting in the sunlight.

This spoiled heir had pursued her relentlessly before.

Compared to Sebastian Valdemar, he might as well be dirt beneath her feet.

Her mind was filled with Sebastian's image these days—even in her dreams.

"What do you want?"

"Don't be so cold." Felix stepped closer. "I got you something good."

Fiona subtly retreated.

Unfazed, Felix beamed. "I secured you a spot in the International Piano Masters competition."

Her eyes lit up at the mention. Winning this prestigious event would make her the center of attention.

Better yet, she'd learned Sebastian was sponsoring it.

This was her chance to rise.

"Professor Jameson wanted Evelyn Roland to go, but she refused. So I recommended you instead."

The words felt like ice water dumped over her head.

Her lashes lowered as nails dug into her palms.

Why was she always Evelyn's second choice? The resentment burned hotter.

"Thank you." Fiona forced a sweet smile, eyes crinkling like crescent moons.

Felix stared, mesmerized. His goddess looked divine when she smiled.

He'd do anything for her.

Fiona noted his infatuation with disgust. This fool had his uses.

Meanwhile, at Aether Medical Lab...

Evelyn Roland peered through the microscope, brow furrowed.

The toxin in Sebastian's blood was more complex than she'd imagined.

Who would plot against him for over a decade?

She carefully added a blood sample to a test tube, then a reagent.

A sudden knock made her hand jerk, nearly overdosing.

Evelyn yanked off her goggles, scowling.

She'd specifically ordered no interruptions.

The door flew open.

"Boss!" Dylan Orlando grinned obsequiously. "Finally caught you!"

"What do you want?" Evelyn glared.

That look always meant trouble.

"Uh... boss, I need saving!"

"What mess did you make now?"

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed.

"I didn't!" Dylan batted his lashes. "I just need you to judge a piano competition."

"Busy."

A piano competition? She had bigger concerns.

As she moved to shut the door, Dylan blocked it with his body. "Wait! Hear me out!"

Here we go again.

"Fine. Talk." Evelyn massaged her temples.

"You're the best!" Dylan dropped to his knees, clutching her leg. "I'm dead without you!"

Evelyn recoiled, shaking him off. She dragged over a chair and sat cross-legged. "Out with it. What disaster now?"
###Chapter 196

"Boss, I really got played this time." Dylan Orlando hung his head, nervously twisting the hem of his shirt between his fingers.

That sly old fox!

"Hmm?"

"The organizers of the piano competition heard I know Maestro. They deliberately provoked me into inviting them as a judge."

Evelyn Roland fixed him with a piercing stare. Dylan felt chills run down his spine.

The boss's gaze was terrifying.

"So you fell for it?"

"Waaah! Boss, don't look at me like that!"

"The worst part is, if I can't get you to come, I have to publicly kneel and apologize!" Dylan wailed pitifully.

"You can't just abandon me!"

As Dylan began his dramatic sobbing again, Evelyn massaged her temples. "Shut up. I'll go."

He immediately stopped, sniffled, and broke into a grin. "You're the best, boss."

Evelyn sighed at the sudden praise.

Must be repaying a debt from a past life.

Fine. She'd indulge him just this once.

Two days later, the piano competition commenced as scheduled.

Evelyn hadn't anticipated the event clashing with Hugo's acupuncture treatment.

Between Dylan's pride and Hugo's health, she chose the latter without hesitation, heading to the Laurent residence first.

"Big sister!"

Hugo flew into her arms like an excited little bird.

"You've grown taller." Evelyn casually ruffled his hair.

"Miss Roland." Henry Laurent greeted her with a warm smile.

She nodded politely.

After finishing the acupuncture session, Evelyn packed away her silver needles. "I'll leave the tools here so I won't need to bring them next time."

"It's almost lunch. Would you care to join us, Miss Roland?"

"Thank you for the offer, Mr. Laurent, but I have another engagement."

Evelyn checked her watch as she walked.

Time was tight.

She arrived at the competition venue in a hurry, only to find the judges' panel already fully seated.

Late, as expected.

Whispers circulated among the judges.

"Wasn't Maestro supposed to come?"

"The competition has started. Where are they?"

"Probably not showing up."

"What a shame. I've always wanted to meet Maestro."

One judge looked particularly disappointed.

Evelyn quietly took a seat beside the judges' table, her simple attire making her blend into the background.

Sebastian Valdemar sat in the investors' VIP section, bored out of his mind.

Then a familiar figure caught his eye.

White blouse, high ponytail, gold-rimmed glasses—none other than Evelyn Roland.

What was she doing here?

A contestant, perhaps?

The dull competition suddenly became interesting.
###Chapter 197

Sebastian Valdemar's slender fingers traced the competition list, his brow slightly furrowed.

Evelyn Roland's name was conspicuously absent.

A scorching gaze swept over her. Evelyn turned to meet Sebastian's penetrating stare.

"Now, let's welcome our final contestant!" The host's voice brimmed with excitement. "She will perform a breathtaking original piano composition!"

Fiona Valentine stepped onto the stage with graceful poise, her white gown shimmering like pearls under the lights.

The first note rang out. Evelyn's fingers clenched involuntarily.

This melody... it was too familiar.

She pressed her lips together, sitting quietly in the audience.

Fiona's performance flowed effortlessly, leaving the concert hall in awed silence.

As the final note faded, thunderous applause erupted.

The judges revealed their scores. Fiona unsurprisingly claimed the highest marks.

"Miss Valentine's original piece is truly remarkable," praised Professor Jameson, a renowned musician on the judging panel.

A cold smile touched Evelyn's lips.

"This piece came to me in a sudden burst of inspiration," Fiona murmured shyly, her ears turning pink.

The audience erupted in chatter.

"Genius!"
"That melody is unforgettable!"

Professor Jameson stood excitedly. "Your musical talent is astounding!"

Under the spotlight, Fiona's smile grew radiant.

"This composition..." A cool female voice cut through the air. "I believe I've heard it before."

The room fell silent.

Lights abruptly shifted to the audience, illuminating Evelyn's exquisite profile.

Fiona's pupils constricted. Her nails dug into her palms.

Her again!

"M-Miss Roland?" Fiona's voice trembled. "What do you mean?"

Evelyn rose slowly, her black gown accentuating her elegant curves.

"It's not too late to admit your mistake," she said softly, each word crisp and clear.

Fiona's face drained of color.

Sebastian studied Evelyn with thoughtful intensity.

Whispers rippled through the crowd.

"Miss, please refrain from disrupting the competition!" A middle-aged man stood abruptly from the judges' table, his face dark.

Felix Valentine snatched the microphone, glaring. "How dare you question the contestant?"

Evelyn calmly retrieved her phone.

"Because I am the original composer of this piece."
###Chapter 198

"What gives you the right to question the originality of this composition?"

The man sneered at Evelyn Roland's seat, his lips curling in mockery. "And who do you think you are? How dare you dictate terms here?"

Evelyn remained unruffled, her fingers lightly tapping the table.

"I'm a judge."

She pulled out a gilded certificate from her bag. The words "Maestro" shimmered under the lights.

"Does this qualify me?"

The judges' panel erupted in murmurs.

No one had expected the internationally renowned pianist Maestro to appear here—let alone someone so young.

In the audience, Sebastian Valdemar's eyes flickered with realization. No wonder her performance at the gala had been so breathtaking. It was her.

Interesting.

Felix Valentine paled, sweat beading on his forehead. Maestro? Evelyn Roland was Maestro? The realization sent chills down his spine.

On stage, Fiona Valentine's legs trembled, her nails digging into her palms. She never imagined she'd run into the real composer.

The tide of public opinion shifted instantly.

"Miss Valentine, care to explain the origins of this piece?"

"I—" Fiona's voice shook. "I never claimed it was my own composition..."

She suddenly pointed at Felix. "He gave me the sheet music!"

Gasps filled the room.

Felix looked ashen, his shirt soaked through with sweat.

"Where did you get the music?" Evelyn pressed, her tone icy.

"I—I bought it from a woman surnamed Lowell..." Felix stammered, avoiding eye contact.

Lowell?

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. Of course. Her dear stepsister Victoria Lowell. Back in the Lowell household, Victoria had "contributed" plenty of stolen compositions.

"Wow, this scandal just got bigger!"
"Isn't Victoria Lowell the one who—"
"I heard Evelyn used to be the Lowells' adopted daughter..."

Whispers spread through the crowd.

Evelyn's gaze darkened. Victoria's title as a piano virtuoso had been built entirely on plagiarizing her work.

Fiona's excuses sounded feeble as tears streamed down her face.

Sebastian frowned. Though he had no affection for this woman, she had been introduced by his sister.

"Miss Roland," he interjected, standing. "The competition must proceed. Since the sheet music is problematic, let's have Miss Valentine withdraw. We can address the rest afterward."
###Chapter 199

The auditorium fell into dead silence.

Sebastian Valdemar's deep voice resonated through the air like a hammer striking every heart.

Fiona Valentine's lips curled slightly. She never expected Mr. Valdemar to personally intervene for her.

This was an extraordinary honor.

She felt one step closer to becoming Mrs. Valdemar.

Evelyn Roland clenched the score sheet until her knuckles turned white.

Her icy gaze locked onto Sebastian, filled with silent accusation.

"Mr. Valdemar, are you questioning the judges' professionalism?"

Sebastian met her stare with unfathomable depth. "You're overthinking, Ms. Roland."

He addressed the room. "The competition results require further verification."

Evelyn lowered her lashes, masking her disappointment.

This so-called verification was merely saving face for capital.

The irony almost made her laugh.

Fiona stood on stage, eyes glistening.

Though disqualified, Sebastian's protection warmed her heart.

She shot Evelyn a venomous glare.

This woman ruined everything!

Without her interference, the trophy would already be in her hands.

"Fiona!"

A shrill voice pierced the air.

Fiona turned to see Felix Valentine sprinting toward her with his ridiculous red hair.

"Get lost!" She recoiled from his touch.

Felix persisted. "Just let me explain—"

Slap!

Fiona's palm connected sharply with his cheek.

Another crisp slap echoed outside the venue.

Fiona clutched her stinging face, staring in shock at her parents.

"Dad...Mom?"

Mr. Valentine trembled with rage. "You've disgraced our family name!"

Mrs. Valentine wiped tears. "How could you do this?"

Tears spilled down Fiona's cheeks.

She fled down the corridor, heels clicking frantically.

When Felix caught up, he found the Valentines' thunderous expressions.

He gulped and retreated silently.

Inside, Sebastian's phone vibrated.

A frown creased his brow as he read the message.

Evelyn noticed his tension, her stomach knotting.

"Business calls, Mr. Valdemar?" She forced lightness into her voice.

Sebastian pocketed his phone. "Excuse me."

His abrupt departure left Evelyn's heart sinking.

Fiona repaired her makeup in the restroom mirror.

The reflection showed swollen eyes and smudged foundation.

Biting her lip, she dialed a number.

"It's me."

"We need to accelerate the plan."

Hanging up, she flashed the mirror a chilling smile.

"Evelyn Roland...this isn't over."
###Chapter 200

Mr. Valentine's face turned ashen.

His temples throbbed violently.

This disgraceful daughter had utterly humiliated the Valentine family today.

"Dad!" Fiona Valentine clutched her stinging cheek, her voice trembling.

She couldn't believe her doting father would strike her in public.

Mrs. Valentine's eyes reddened as she twisted her handkerchief. "Fiona, you've disappointed me deeply."

"I'll teach you to know your place!"

Another sharp slap rang out.

Fiona's cheek burned, tears blurring her vision.

"How was I supposed to know that score—"

"Silence!" Mr. Valentine thundered. "If you hadn't claimed credit, would this have happened?"

Fiona felt her heart tearing apart.

Were these the same loving parents she remembered?

"There's been a misunderstanding—"

"Misunderstanding?" Mr. Valentine sneered. "Didn't you personally take credit for that composition?"

The rapid-fire accusations made Fiona dizzy.

Mrs. Valentine sighed. "Fiona, you were truly at fault this time."

Fiona stared at her mother in disbelief. "Mom, even you—"

"Victim?" Mr. Valentine laughed mirthlessly. "How dare you say that?"

Outside the venue, Evelyn Roland followed the commotion.

She saw Mr. Valentine's raised hand.

In a flash, Evelyn pulled Fiona aside.

The strike barely grazed Fiona's hair.

Mr. Valentine's fury evaporated when he recognized the newcomer.

"Mr. Valentine, let's discuss this calmly," Evelyn said gently.

Fiona stood rigid beside Evelyn, nails digging into her palms.

This hypocritical woman—what act was she putting on now?

She'd repay today's humiliation a hundredfold.

"Forgive our family's disgrace, Maestro," Mr. Valentine forced a smile.

Evelyn smiled warmly. "Fiona shows remarkable musical talent."

"Your praise honors our daughter," Mr. Valentine fawned.

Fiona's stomach churned at the sycophantic words.

"Your parents must be proud of your achievements at such a young age," Mrs. Valentine added.

"Would Maestro consider mentoring our daughter?" Mrs. Valentine ventured timidly.

Fiona's head snapped up.

She'd never take lessons from this fraud!

But her parents didn't give her a chance to protest.

She stared desperately at the exit, willing a familiar figure to appear.

"I regret my schedule is fully committed," Evelyn declined politely.

Mrs. Valentine's disappointment showed. "Of course, we understand."

Fiona bit her lip until copper flooded her mouth.
###Chapter 201

Fiona Valentine's tears welled up in her eyes, stubbornly refusing to fall.

Having Evelyn Roland as her mentor? This was nothing short of trampling on her dignity.

They were supposed to be family, yet they humiliated her like this. Fiona turned and ran, her tears finally breaking free.

"Don't chase her. Let her calm down."

"Today has been a complete disgrace to the Valentine family."

Evelyn gave them a detached glance.

This was someone else's family drama. She had no interest in getting involved.

"I have experiments to attend to. Excuse me."

The Valentines tried to stop her, but seeing her determination, they could only apologize. "Maestro, we're truly sorry about today."

Fiona hid in a secluded corner of the garden, waiting endlessly for her parents to come after her.

She curled up on a bench, her delicate makeup smeared by tears, looking like a discarded doll.

"Who's there?" She startled at the sound of footsteps.

"It's me." Isabella Langley stepped out of the shadows.

Recognizing her, Fiona threw herself into her arms and sobbed. "Why would they do this to me...?"

"Because they fear your talent." Isabella gently stroked her back. "It's all Evelyn's fault. If not for her—"

A flame of hatred ignited in Fiona's eyes, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood by the roadside, waiting for a cab.

Familiar footsteps approached from behind.

The faint scent of mint gave away the intruder before she even turned.

"Stop following me." She quickened her pace without looking back.

Her wrist was suddenly seized.

"Let go!" Evelyn yanked her arm free, her gaze icy.

"I can explain what happened earlier."

"Unnecessary." She turned to leave.

Sebastian Valdemar tried to pursue her but was interrupted by a ringing phone.

Evelyn exhaled in relief—finally rid of that nuisance.

Just as she hailed a cab, a familiar figure caught her eye through the café window—Sophia Roland, elegantly stirring her coffee.
###Chapter 202

Evelyn pushed open the glass door of the café, greeted by the rich aroma of coffee.

She had only intended to grab a drink, but the sound of piano music caught her attention.

The melody drifted from the back of the café, flowing smoothly at times, stumbling at others.

Following the sound, Evelyn found Sophia surrounded by a group of socialites, seated at the piano.

"Mrs. Roland, what exactly are you playing?" A woman in a Chanel suit giggled behind her hand.

"I thought we'd hear Chopin," another chimed in.

Sophia's fingers froze on the keys, her face paling slightly.

"Perhaps I could teach you?" Mrs. Lowell offered with false sweetness. "Our family employs a professor from the Vienna Conservatory."

Soft laughter rippled through the group.

Evelyn stood at the edge of the crowd, her gaze turning icy.

She watched Sophia's hands twist nervously, nails digging into her palms.

"Mom." Evelyn's voice cut through the chatter.

The café fell silent.

Sophia looked up, her eyes already glistening.

Evelyn strode to the piano and gently covered her mother's trembling hands.

"Let me help."

Her fingers danced across the keys, transforming the simple tune into something breathtaking.

"This..." Mrs. Lowell's eyes widened.

"A variation of La Campanella?" someone gasped.

As the final note faded, Evelyn rose gracefully.

"Allow me to introduce my mother." Her gaze swept over the stunned faces. "As for me—you may know me as Maestro."

"Impossible!" Mrs. Lowell shrieked. "Maestro can't possibly be this young!"

Evelyn smirked, pulling a gilded business card from her bag.

The name Maestro gleamed above the emblem of the International Piano Association.

"Shall I play Liszt's Feux Follets as proof?"

The socialites exchanged uneasy glances, their faces draining of color.

Sophia pressed a hand to her mouth, tears spilling over.

"Evelyn..." she whispered.

Evelyn clasped her mother's shaking hands.

"Let's go home."
###Chapter 203

Sophia Roland's fingers traced the rim of her teacup, her knuckles turning white.

The mocking gazes of the society ladies made her chest tighten as if stuffed with cotton.

"Let me—"

"No need." Evelyn Roland shook her head gently, her calm eyes like still water.

Sophia bit her lower lip as sharp whispers pierced her ears.

"Who does she think she's fooling?"
"Maestro couldn't possibly be this young..."
"Mrs. Lee is absolutely right..."

Evelyn felt Sophia's trembling hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze.

"Maestro!"

A booming voice cut through the tea house chatter.

A dozen staff members in committee uniforms filed in, their leader striding straight to Evelyn.

"You left your credentials at the venue."

The room fell deathly silent.

The ladies' expressions froze. Mrs. Lee's teacup shattered on the floor.

"It really is her..."
"Oh my god..."

The hushed murmurs stabbed at Mrs. Lee's ears.

Evelyn accepted the badge with a faint smile. "Thank you for delivering it."

"Our pleasure!" The staff bowed respectfully.

Sophia scoffed, linking arms with Evelyn. "This gathering isn't worthy of my daughter's status."

The Roland mansion blazed with light.

"Edward!" Sophia rushed into her husband's arms the moment she entered. "Guess what happened today?"

She animatedly recounted the tea house scene, her eyes sparkling.

Edward's face darkened. His fist slammed onto the coffee table. "Bastards!"

Cupping his wife's face tenderly, he growled, "Next time, use my name directly."

His gaze softened when it landed on Evelyn sipping tea quietly. "We owe this to Evelyn."

"Just doing my part." Evelyn set down her cup with a crisp clink.

At the stairwell, Isabella Langley dug her nails into her palms.

She forced a concerned expression and hurried downstairs. "Mom! Who upset you?"

She embraced Sophia warmly, but her side-eye burned into Evelyn.

Why did this outsider get everything upon returning?

Outside, moonlight outlined Sebastian Valdemar's tall frame.

He leaned against his Rolls-Royce, fingers absently tapping the door.

"Master Valdemar?" The butler opened the gate in surprise. "Why wait out here?"

"...Just arrived."

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed as Evelyn's indifferent gaze flashed through his mind.

Just then, Isabella's shrill voice pierced the night. "Sebastian!"

Inside, Evelyn turned without a word and ascended the stairs.

Sebastian's eyes followed her retreating figure, his chest constricting.
###Chapter 204

"I'm here to see Evelyn Roland." Sebastian Valdemar's gaze followed Evelyn's retreating figure, his voice low and measured.

Edward Roland and Sophia Roland exchanged wary glances, their defenses rising at the unexpected visitor.

"My daughter isn't receiving guests," Edward stated firmly, his tone leaving no room for argument.

"You should leave," Sophia added coldly.

Upstairs, by the floor-to-ceiling window, Evelyn watched Sebastian's car disappear into the distance. She tightened her grip on the key in her hand and strode toward the brewery's ingredient vault.

"Stop right there!" A burly middle-aged man blocked the entrance, his face twisted in disdain. "This isn't a place for you."

"I'm the heir to this winery," Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Move aside."

The man scoffed. "Who knows what underhanded tricks you used to get here?"

Hidden in the shadows, Sebastian clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

"Are you questioning my competence?" Evelyn's voice was icy.

Sebastian stepped forward. "Or are you questioning the owner's decision?"

Evelyn stiffened. Why couldn't this man leave her alone?

Recognition flashed across the man's face as he realized who Sebastian was, his expression paling instantly.

"Leave if you don't want to work here." Sebastian's gaze was sharp as a blade.

Whispers erupted among the gathering employees.

"Just because of them?"

"Mr. Laurent must be blind!"

"Think money makes you untouchable?"

The situation teetered on the edge of chaos.

Evelyn massaged her temples. Every encounter with Sebastian brought trouble.

"The winery is doomed..."

"All of Mr. Laurent's hard work..."

Sebastian opened his mouth to speak, but Evelyn cut him off. "Mr. Valdemar, this is my matter."

The way she addressed him made his eyes darken.

Ignoring him, Evelyn stepped into the center of the crowd.

"Everyone, listen to me."

Her clear voice gradually silenced the murmurs.

"Such a performance!" someone sneered.

"I know you don't trust me," Evelyn scanned the faces around her. "So let's make a bet."

The employees exchanged uncertain looks.

"Without using the ingredient vault, I'll double our sales within a month."

"Big words!"

"If I fail," Evelyn declared firmly, "I'll step down."

Sebastian watched her unwavering posture, a flicker of admiration in his eyes.
###Chapter 205

The veteran employees of the winery exchanged glances.

"Are you serious?" The nearly-fired worker narrowed his eyes.

He studied Evelyn Roland intently, searching for any sign of deception.

Evelyn straightened her posture, meeting his scrutiny with unwavering clarity.

"Absolutely. If you don't believe me, we can sign an agreement."

"No need. I recorded our entire conversation."

The man was shrewd.

He'd activated his recorder beforehand.

"One month deadline."

Other staff members stared at Evelyn like she'd lost her mind.

Doubling Château Laurent's profits without using the ingredient vault?

Preposterous.

"Bold words, Miss Roland. If you actually pull this off, I'll be the first to respect you!"

A burly man slammed the table as he stood.

"Agreed! We'll all acknowledge you!"

The others chimed in.

"Remember your words."

Sebastian Valdemar observed Evelyn's confident demeanor from the sidelines.

His tense nerves finally relaxed.

He opened his mouth to speak.

But Evelyn had already turned to leave.

A faint breeze stirred as they brushed past each other.

The employees watched Evelyn depart, then stole furtive glances at Sebastian.

This icy-faced executioner was their second-in-command.

Having publicly contradicted him, they feared retaliation.

Sebastian merely gave them an inscrutable look before striding out after her.

Evelyn walked a hundred meters from the winery.

The familiar scent of mint trailed behind her.

She didn't need to turn around to know who it was.

Irritated, she halted abruptly.

"What do you want?" She spun around.

They stood close enough to feel each other's breath.

Sebastian stumbled back, averting his face.

"I came to apologize. And explain."

"Don't bother. Since you chose to help Olivia, see it through."

Evelyn had no patience for conversation.

She just wanted him gone.

Sebastian grew visibly agitated.

"Evelyn, you've misunderstood. I never took her side."

"Not my concern." Her voice turned glacial. "If you can't comprehend basic English, Mr. Valdemar, I'll repeat myself: Stay away."

The temperature between them plummeted.

A nameless fury rose in Sebastian's chest.

As the standoff continued,

He suddenly clutched his temples, brows furrowing.

The pained expression vanished as quickly as it appeared.

Another migraine? Evelyn's hand twitched toward him instinctively.
###Chapter 206

Evelyn Roland's fingers tightened slightly, her nails nearly digging into her palms. She took a deep breath, forcing down the turbulent emotions swirling in her chest.

Sebastian Valdemar noticed her hesitation instantly, his tone softening unexpectedly. "The headaches have been getting worse. I probably need a second treatment."

A faint sheen of sweat glistened at his temples under the light as he frowned slightly.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on his strained expression. Her instincts as a healer wouldn't allow her to ignore a patient's suffering.

"I can treat you today."

A flash of triumph flickered in Sebastian's eyes before he schooled his features back into weakness. "Thank you, Miss Roland. After all, you promised to cure me."

This man really knew how to seize an opportunity. Evelyn rolled her eyes internally.

Even more absurd—she thought she detected a hint of vulnerability in his deep voice. She must be hearing things.

"Let's go to your place," she finally conceded.

The sharp edges of Sebastian's aura melted away instantly. His lips curved. "Much obliged."

Only after settling into the black Maybach did Evelyn realize she'd been led by the nose again.

As the scenery blurred past the window, she studied Sebastian's focused profile while driving and suddenly found the situation amusing.

Fine. Consider it professional compassion.

The Valdemar villa remained eerily quiet, as if uninhabited. While preparing her silver needles, Evelyn glanced around.

"Do you live here alone?"

Sebastian lay on the sofa, cracking one eye open. "Why? Feeling sorry for me?"

"This will hurt. Bear with it." She ignored his teasing, holding up a sterilized needle.

This batch was thicker than last time.

Sebastian closed his eyes again. "Do your worst."

As each needle found its mark, beads of sweat formed along his hairline. Noticing his clenched jaw, Evelyn unconsciously lightened her touch.

"Any thoughts about boosting the winery's sales?" Sebastian asked abruptly.

Evelyn's hand jerked, nearly missing the acupuncture point. She steadied herself. "Traditional sales methods are outdated."

"Oh?" Sebastian sounded intrigued. "Go on."

"It's the age of digital influence." Adjusting a needle's angle, she continued, "I'm planning online campaigns and considering a brand ambassador."

Sebastian's lips quirked. "Not bad."

His approval made her ears burn. She hurriedly bent over the needles to hide her reaction.

Outside the door, Olivia Valdemar muffled a giggle, tiptoeing away to avoid disrupting the charged atmosphere.

These two were practically made for each other. She was already calculating how large a wedding gift to prepare.
###Chapter 207

Evelyn Roland was organizing her medical kit when Olivia Valdemar's voice reached her ears.

"Evelyn, I can connect you with top-tier celebrity resources."

She looked up to see Olivia holding a pregnancy test report, her cheeks glowing. After a brief pause, Evelyn nodded. "Thank you, Olivia."

Olivia stepped closer, draping an arm over her shoulder with familiarity. "No need for formalities between family."

Evelyn's fingers stilled. She didn't respond.

The living room air thickened with unspoken tension.

Sebastian Valdemar sat silently on the opposite sofa, ignored like a ghost.

"I've sent the address and contact details to your phone," Olivia said, scrolling through her screen. "Will you stay for dinner?"

Evelyn glanced at her wristwatch. She snapped the last silver needle into place. "I'll return for the follow-up on Tuesday. The lab needs me."

As she lifted her medical kit to leave, Sebastian's voice cut through the quiet. "Let me drive you."

Olivia's eyebrows shot up in surprise.

Evelyn didn't turn around. "No need."

The moment the door closed, Olivia burst into laughter. "Well, my matchmaking list just became obsolete." She sighed dramatically. "Fiona Valentine asked about you recently. What a shame..."

Sebastian's stomach twisted at the mention of Fiona's pretentious mannerisms.

At dawn, Evelyn sat in a diner.

Steam from hot soy milk blurred her vision. She stared at the address on her phone, irritation prickling under her skin.

The celebrity's name alone made her recoil.

The film set's chaos snapped her from her thoughts.

"Cut! Perfect! Ten-minute break!"

The director's shout barely faded when a saccharine voice pierced the air. "Cousin, you're amazing~"

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

Fiona Valentine, clad in costume, clung to the lead actress's arm. When they turned, six eyes collided in midair.
###Chapter 208

Sunlight streamed through the glass ceiling of the film set. Evelyn Roland walked through the bustling crowd in her stilettos, her silhouette strikingly elegant amidst the interplay of light and shadow. The black tailored suit accentuated her flawless figure.

"Look over there!"

"My God, that aura is incredible!"

"Is she a new artist signed by some agency?"

Stagehands whispered among themselves, stealing glances at Evelyn. Their murmurs drifted to Felicity Valentine's ears.

Felicity's fingers tightened around her water bottle.

"Cousin..." Fiona Valentine leaned in, lowering her voice. "That bitch is here."

Felicity narrowed her eyes, following her cousin's gaze.

"You know her?"

"Know her?" Fiona gritted her teeth. "She's an expert at backstabbing. Be careful."

Felicity snorted and tossed her water bottle carelessly by the poolside.

"Her? Really?"

Nearby, the director and screenwriter were pointing at Evelyn.

"That look is perfect for our female lead!"

"Go ask which agency she's with!"

Felicity's expression darkened instantly.

Evelyn approached them and nodded politely.

"Miss Valentine, may I have a word? About a potential collaboration."

Felicity gave her a once-over, her lips curling into a mocking smile.

"Collaboration? With you?"

The set fell silent.

Evelyn turned to leave, but Felicity stopped her.

"Wait." She pointed to the water bottle by the pool. "Pick that up, and maybe I'll give you five minutes."

Evelyn paused, then slowly turned back.

"Are you disabled?"

The entire set held its breath.

Felicity shot to her feet. "What did you just say?"

"I said," Evelyn enunciated clearly, "are your hands broken?"

"Evelyn Roland!" Fiona shrieked. "How dare you speak to my cousin like that!"

Felicity trembled with rage. "Is this how you ask for a collaboration?"

"Collaboration?" Evelyn smirked. "You misunderstand, Miss Valentine. I'm here to acquire your company."
###Chapter 209

The heated argument erupted across the set, drawing the attention of the director's team monitoring the screens.

Fiona Valentine stood nearby, a fake smile plastered on her lips. "Senior Evelyn, my cousin is an industry veteran. Shouldn't you show some respect?"

Evelyn Roland shot her a frosty glance. She had once dismissed Fiona as merely young and reckless, but now it was clear—the two cousins were cut from the same cloth.

"Disgraceful," Felicity Valentine sneered, arms crossed and chin lifted. "No wonder even your own parents—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn's gaze turned glacial.

"Say that again."

Felicity caught sight of the contract in Evelyn's hand and smirked. "Begging for my cooperation? Get on your knees, and maybe I'll give you a discount."

"Exactly," Fiona chimed in. "Senior Evelyn should show some sincerity."

Splash—

A bucket of ice water drenched Felicity from head to toe.

She shrieked, jumping to her feet. Her meticulously styled costume was soaked, her makeup smeared, leaving her looking like a drowned rat.

"Are you insane?!" she screeched hysterically.

Fiona pretended to intervene but had already retreated to a safe distance. Evelyn watched the two fake sisters with cold amusement, her lips curling in disdain.

The director's team rushed over at the commotion, their expressions strained.

"Ms. Valentine, please calm down—"

"What kind of circus are you running here?" Felicity jabbed a trembling finger at Evelyn. "How dare you let this lunatic on set?"

The director turned to Evelyn. "Apologize and leave immediately!"

Evelyn calmly adjusted her sleeve. "A Golden Globe-winning director for The Tibetan Antelope, reduced to babysitting this trash. How pathetic."

She pointed to a cleaner at the edge of the set. "That woman over there could act circles around this so-called 'Ms. Valentine.'"

Felicity trembled with rage, her voice shaking. "You—you—"

At the mention of The Tibetan Antelope, the director froze in place.
###Chapter 210

The director's fingertips trembled slightly.

This young woman had recognized his long-buried debut film at first glance. Fresh out of film school back then, he'd poured his soul into that arthouse project—winning Best New Director at an international festival.

But in this era of viral trends, art always bowed to capital.

"Director first? Screenwriter first?" Felicity Valentine sneered, pressing a crimson nail against his chest. "Who cares about that these days? Fans only want to see my darling's face!"

The director clenched his fists in silence.

"Are you all deaf?" Felicity's voice sharpened. "Security! Throw this bitch out!"

The set fell deathly quiet. Crew members took half-steps back, eyes gleaming with morbid curiosity.

"How impressive."

A cool female voice cut through the tension. Olivia Valdemar entered, one hand supporting her pregnant belly as she swiftly positioned herself between Felicity and Evelyn Roland.

Fiona Valentine's expression instantly crumpled. "Olivia, I—"

Olivia didn't even glance her way. She'd just returned from a prenatal checkup and stopped by to check on Evelyn's shoot—only to walk into this spectacle.

"Careful with your condition," Evelyn murmured, steadying Olivia.

Though six months pregnant slowed her movements, fury bleached Olivia's face white. "I authorized Evelyn's access. Shall you expel me too, Miss Valentine?"

Fiona's eyes welled up. "But Evelyn started—"

"Enough!" Olivia's voice cracked like a whip. "Drop the innocent act. Stay away from my brother."

The words landed like a guillotine, severing Fiona's last shred of hope. She staggered back, nails biting into her palms.

Felicity's eyes darted between them before adopting a wounded expression. "A misunderstanding, Ms. Valdemar. Had I known Miss Roland was under your protection..." She turned to Evelyn with saccharine sweetness. "I'll do the endorsement for free—as apology."

"Unnecessary." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Château Blanc has no need for spokesmodels... with questionable reputations."

A deliberate pause.

"Who knows what scandals might surface tomorrow?"

Felicity's face turned ashen.
###Chapter 211

Felicity Valentine's expression darkened instantly, a flash of cruelty flickering in her eyes. Her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

"Since you're being so uncooperative, Miss Roland," she sneered, waving her phone, "this video will go viral."

Olivia Valdemar shot to her feet, shielding Evelyn Roland. "You wouldn't dare!"

Felicity smirked and suddenly shoved Olivia. Evelyn's pupils constricted in alarm.

"Watch out!"

Olivia staggered backward, losing her balance. Water erupted as she plunged into the pool. Without hesitation, Evelyn dove in after her.

Amid the splashing water, Evelyn caught Olivia's back. But then—a vivid streak of red bloomed in the water.

"The baby..." Olivia's face drained of color, her fingers clawing at Evelyn's sleeve.

Chaos erupted. Screams pierced the air. Phones were whipped out.

"Silence!" Evelyn's voice cut through the noise like a blade. "All men, out! Anyone filming will answer to the Valdemars!"

She carefully lifted Olivia onto the pool deck, her gaze sharp as a scalpel. "I need a needle!"

A pair of slender hands offered a brooch pin. Evelyn didn't even glance at the person, swiftly sterilizing the pin with a lighter.

The silver needle found its mark with precision. Olivia's moans gradually subsided. The crimson stain stopped spreading. Only then did Evelyn's tense shoulders relax slightly.

"You're safe now," she murmured, only to notice Olivia's wide-eyed stare fixed behind her.

Evelyn turned.

And met the fathomless gaze of Sebastian Valdemar.
###Chapter 212
The afternoon sun slanted across the film set, casting sharp reflections from the diamond brooch pinned to Evelyn Roland's chest. The man who had given it to her stood in the shadows, his lips curling into an amused smirk.

This young woman actually knew the long-lost ancient restoration techniques.

He checked his watch before turning away, his gaze lingering briefly on Olivia Valdemar.

"Don't worry. The doctor's coming." Evelyn pressed her hand over Olivia's trembling fingers.

Fiona Valentine clutched Felicity's costume sleeve so tightly her nails nearly tore through the fabric. "Do you realize what you've done?"

Felicity's face turned ashen. Her lips trembled wordlessly as she stared at Evelyn's retreating figure, suddenly shuddering.

Amid the chaotic set noises, Evelyn's voice cut through with crystalline clarity.

"Dylan Orlando, withdraw all funding from 'Moonlight' immediately." A deliberate pause. "I want Felicity Valentine blacklisted from this industry."

The director's phone rang. His complexion grayed the moment he answered. "CH Holdings... actually pulled out?"

Felicity stumbled backward, her high heels catching on the elaborate costume skirt.

"Impossible!" Fiona shrieked. "There's no way she's CH's—"

"CEO." Evelyn completed the sentence, her gaze sweeping across everyone present.

Twitter exploded with trending hashtags. Felicity's scandals poured out like blizzard flurries—on-set bullying, bribing judges, even video evidence of drug use.

Her fan club president publicly announced its dissolution.

Felicity collapsed onto the dusty floor, her expensive costume ruined. When she finally looked up at Evelyn, she saw the glacial ice in those eyes.

"You thought beauty alone gave you the right to bully others?" Evelyn bent down, letting the brooch's cold glare flash across Felicity's face. "Now you understand karma?"

Sirens wailed in the distance. As paramedics lifted Olivia onto a stretcher, she gripped Evelyn's wrist with surprising strength.

"Evelyn..." Her whisper barely carried. "Don't let them get away with this."

Evelyn squeezed her hand in silent promise.

Outside the set, the mysterious man observed everything from his black sedan. Rubbing his jade signet ring, he dialed a number. "Investigate Evelyn Roland's connection to CH Jewelry."

Fiona slid down against a wall, watching her cousin's breakdown with dawning horror—the Valentine family was finished.

Utterly destroyed.
###Chapter 213

Felicity's fingers trembled.

She finally realized the seemingly fragile girl before her was someone even the entire Valentine family couldn't afford to provoke.

Her knees hit the floor with a thud.

"Miss Roland, please show mercy." Felicity clung desperately to Evelyn's leg. "I worked so hard to get where I am today..."

Tears streaked her ruined makeup, making her look like a ridiculous clown. Fiona Valentine quietly retreated before turning to leave.

The Valentines had long split into separate branches. She wasn't about to be dragged down by this idiot.

Evelyn looked down at her with icy detachment.

"You're not afraid of wrongdoing. You're afraid of me." Evelyn's lips curled in disdain. "Drop the act. It's disgusting."

Felicity froze.

In the next instant, she snatched a fruit knife and lunged at Evelyn.

"Die!"

The blade glinted coldly—but stopped half a meter short.

A piercing shriek tore from Felicity's throat.

Sebastian Valdemar had appeared on set without warning. His kick sent Felicity flying with blinding speed. Theodore Ashcroft immediately pulled out his phone to call an ambulance.

"Are you hurt?" Sebastian gripped Evelyn's wrist, his voice tense.

"I'm fine." She pulled her hand free. "It's Miss Valdemar..."

Olivia Valdemar leaned weakly against the wall. "Evelyn reacted just in time."

The three hurried to the hospital.

While packing, Evelyn discovered the brooch. Sunlight refracted through its gemstones in mesmerizing hues—the final masterpiece of a Danish artisan.

She tucked it carefully into her bag.

Olivia only had a mild concussion, but Sebastian insisted on hospitalization. Six bodyguards formed an impenetrable barrier around her room.

"Need a new spokesperson?" Sebastian's intense gaze burned into Evelyn in the hallway.

"I already have someone in mind." She thought of director Blake Sherwood.

Sebastian opened his mouth to speak, but she cut him off with a raised hand.
###Chapter 214

"Miss Valdemar is still shaken. Stay with her." I stood by the hospital room door, fingertips lightly tapping the wall. "There are matters at the winery that need my attention."

Time was running out. The backup plan would only make things more rushed.

Stepping out of the hospital, I dialed Blake Sherwood's number.

A drunken voice slurred through the phone: "Termination, right? Yeah, yeah, I know the drill. Not a word about what happened on set."

The corner of my lips curved up. At least this director knew his place.

"It's me. Evelyn Roland."

The sound of a bottle clattering to the floor echoed through the line. Blake's voice instantly sobered. "M-Miss Roland?"

"Hmm."

"I swear, I won’t breathe a word about the incident!" His voice trembled.

"That’s not why I called." I cut straight to the point. "I’ve seen your documentary work. You know how to tell a story. Stop wasting your talent on those trashy dramas. Come film a documentary for my winery."

"Same pay as before. Bonuses if it performs well."

Blake stammered in excitement. "Ms. Roland! I won’t let you down!"

Inside the Valentine family villa.

Fiona Valentine huddled in the corner of her bedroom. She hadn’t dared to return to school since her cousin’s accident. Yet her obsession with Sebastian Valdemar only grew wilder.

He saved her. That meant he loved her!

Her phone suddenly rang.

"Fiona, it’s Isabella." A gentle voice floated through the line. "You haven’t been to school in days. I’ve been worried."

Fiona burst into tears.

Isabella sighed. "It’s all Evelyn Roland’s fault. Did you know? Château Laurent is co-managed by her and Sebastian."

"They’re... close."

The call ended. Fiona clenched her phone, nails digging deep into her palms.

Destroy the winery, and she’d destroy them both.

Filming day.

I led Blake through the winery grounds. The workers initially shied away from the cameras—until they realized the documentary was about them.

These seasoned employees, who’d never been on screen before, lit up with excitement. Under the lens, their labor took on a quiet dignity.

Watching the rough cut, I nodded in approval.

I hadn’t misjudged him.
###Chapter 215

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the editing bay where Evelyn Roland sat. Her fingers hovered over the playback button.

Blake Sherwood's cinematography made her eyes brighten.

"Your framing has remarkable tension." She turned to the lanky director standing beside her. "This narrative pacing—it's innate talent."

Blake's ears flushed pink. He rubbed his palms together, remembering the camera equipment gathering dust in storage.

Had Evelyn not sought him out, those forgotten tools might never have seen daylight again.

"Ms. Roland..." His voice caught.

Evelyn inserted a flash drive into her computer, lips curving gently.

"Your commission will be deposited on schedule." She paused. "You deserve a better platform."

Only the rhythmic tapping of keyboards filled the studio. Blake watched her focused profile and quietly clenched his fist.

Three days later, Château Laurent's official account updated.

The hashtag #VintnersLegacy spread like wildfire.

[I'm in tears! My grandfather was exactly this kind of craftsman]
[This is true artisan spirit]
[Order placed—supporting ethical businesses]

Live footage from the winery showed crowds flooding the tasting room.

Sebastian Valdemar tapped his fingers against the mahogany desk. His screen replayed Evelyn's documentary on loop.

"Fascinating," he murmured.

Theodore Ashcroft noted with surprise how his CEO's brow had relaxed three degrees more than usual.

When Sebastian reached for his phone, Theodore discreetly exited the office.

The call connected to a cacophony of car horns.

"Busy?"

"Mr. Valdemar?" Evelyn's breathless voice crackled through. "If this is about your follow-up appointment—"

"Excellent work," he interrupted. "I wanted—"

"Apologies, we've got a situation at the vineyard." Footsteps pounded in the background. "I'll call you back."

The dial tone hummed. Sebastian stared at the darkened screen, then chuckled unexpectedly.

Outside, Theodore nearly spilled his coffee.
###Chapter 216

Evelyn Roland ended the call decisively. The phone screen went dark instantly.

Her heels clicked rapidly against the marble floor as she strode toward the parking lot. The news of Old Joy's resignation furrowed her brow. This veteran employee, who had worked at the winery for twenty years, was now leaving over a matter of pride.

The atmosphere in Sebastian Valdemar's office plummeted to freezing.

He stared at the darkened phone screen, his knuckles tightening unconsciously. The words "Let's have dinner tonight" had been left unspoken, abruptly cut off by her.

"Mr. Valdemar, the afternoon meeting—" Theodore Ashcroft ventured cautiously.

"Postpone it," Sebastian said coldly, his gaze darkening.

Chaos reigned in the winery's HR department.

Blake Sherwood and several senior employees surrounded Old Joy, pleading with him earnestly. The HR director wrung his hands in distress. When Evelyn pushed the door open, everyone turned to her as if finding their anchor.

"Ms. Roland!" they chorused.

Old Joy shot up from his chair and slammed his resignation letter onto the table. "I'm not skilled enough! I have no face to stay!"

Evelyn raised a hand, signaling for silence.

She walked up to Old Joy, her gaze steady as still water. "Master Joy, I took over this winery not to compete with anyone. In business, profit is the only true measure of success."

Old Joy froze.

Blake's eyes lit up, and he slapped his thigh. "Listen to that! Now that's the mindset of a true leader!"

The other employees suddenly understood. Ms. Roland hadn't been bothered by petty conflicts at all—her focus had always been on the winery's growth.

"You..." Old Joy's lips trembled. The resignation letter in his hand suddenly felt scorching.

Evelyn smiled faintly and pushed the letter back toward him. "The winery needs experienced masters like you. Stay, and let's grow this business together?"

Her sincerity was impossible to refuse.

Old Joy's eyes reddened instantly. Blake snatched the letter and tore it to shreds. "Come on! There's a new batch of grapes waiting for processing!"

The group ushered Old Joy out, and the office finally settled into calm.

Just as Evelyn exhaled in relief, a security guard rushed in, panicked. "Ms. Roland, it's bad! There's a commotion at the gate—someone's claiming they got poisoned from our wine! They brought reporters!"

Her expression darkened. She grabbed her coat and bolted outside.

At the winery's entrance, a heavily made-up woman wailed into the cameras. "It was their wine that put me in the hospital! Don't buy it!"

Camera flashes erupted in waves. Evelyn narrowed her eyes, a cold smirk forming in her heart. So, they've finally made their move.
###Chapter 217

Chaos erupted outside Château Laurent.

Fiona Valentine crouched on the stone steps, her face ashen, lips tinged an unnatural bluish-purple. Tears welled in her swollen eyes as she choked out, "How dare they treat me, a Valentine heiress, like this..."

The crowd swelled with each passing minute.

"Isn't that the Valentine heiress?"

"My God, is the wine poisoned?"

"I just bought two cases last week!"

Whispers rippled through the gathering. Fiona's lips curled almost imperceptibly before she contorted her face back into agony.

With trembling hands, she raised her phone. "Look—the hospital's diagnostic report!"

Sweat dripped from the foreheads of frantic staff.

"Lies! Our wines are impeccable!"

"If she's really poisoned, why isn't she at the hospital?"

This was the moment Fiona had waited for.

She yanked two sheets of paper from her bag, shaking them dramatically.

"Open your eyes and see the truth!"

The crowd exploded.

"It's a lab report!"

"Demand refunds now!"

Security guards scrambled to contain the surge of angry patrons.

BANG!

A deafening sound froze everyone in place.

Evelyn Roland stood atop the steps, a megaphone in hand, her black trench coat billowing.

"Refunds will be processed at the front desk."

Her voice was glacial.

"But mark my words—"

"Once the truth comes out, every customer who demands a refund today will be permanently blacklisted by the Valdemar Group."

Silence descended.

Evelyn descended the stairs, her stilettos clicking against marble.

Fiona shrank back instinctively.

"Hand them over."

Evelyn snatched the papers. Her fingertips brushed the edges—

"Forging official seals carries a prison sentence, Miss Valentine."
###Chapter 218

"This certificate is forged."

"How dare you say that?!"

Evelyn Roland tapped the paper with her fingertip, a cold smile curling her lips. "It doesn’t even have the most basic details—no name of the certification agency, no official seal, no signature. Did you think a blank sheet would fool anyone?"

Fiona Valentine’s face paled.

Her plan had been to hastily forge a document and destroy it later. In the chaos, who would notice such details?

But Evelyn had seen right through it.

"My poisoning is real!" Fiona quickly pulled out another document. "The hospital report has a seal. You can verify it—"

Before she could finish, her eyes widened. She staggered backward and collapsed.

"Fiona!"

She hit the ground hard, vomiting violently. Her freshly manicured nails dug deep into Evelyn’s arm.

"Call an ambulance!"

Evelyn swiftly laid her flat and began chest compressions. One, two...

For a fleeting moment, she saw the girl with the ponytail from years ago, waving at her under the sunlight. "Evelyn! Evelyn!"

Fiona’s pupils dilated.

The wail of sirens pierced the air.

Evelyn mechanically followed the stretcher into the ambulance. The flatline on the heart monitor stabbed at her vision.

Defibrillation. Once, twice...

Finally, the doctor pulled the white sheet over Fiona’s face.

"My condolences."

The morgue lights were stark white.

Evelyn stood in the hallway until Sebastian Valdemar pulled her into his arms. When Fiona’s parents lunged at her, he shielded her firmly.

"You murderer! Give me back my daughter!"

"Fiona treated you so well, and you stole her man and her life!"

Curses exploded around her. Evelyn pressed her lips together.

"Mr. and Mrs. Valentine, I understand your grief," she said, her face ashen. "But her death had nothing to do with me."

Mrs. Valentine’s trembling finger nearly touched her face. "Prove it!"

"Surveillance footage." Evelyn turned on her phone screen. "The truth is right here."

At the end of the hallway, police sirens grew louder.
###Chapter 219

The fluorescent lights in the morgue cast a cold glow over Fiona Valentine's pallid face.

Evelyn Roland's fingers trembled as she unlocked her phone. The surveillance footage played again.

In the video, Fiona emerged from the pharmacy clutching a small box.

The words "Amino-based drug" gleamed harshly under the sunlight.

She tilted her head back and swallowed a pill.

Then she pulled out a bottle of red wine from her bag and gulped down half of it.

"She had no idea this drug could have a lethal reaction with alcohol." Evelyn's voice was raw.

Sebastian Valdemar placed a steadying hand on her shaking shoulder.

Fiona's mother suddenly threw herself over her daughter's body. Her anguished wails echoed through the corridor.

"My baby... why would you do this..."

Fiona's father collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down his weathered face.

Evelyn clenched her fists so tightly her nails drew blood from her palms.

As they stepped out of the morgue, Sebastian spoke abruptly. "This wasn't an accident."

Evelyn's head snapped up.

"Fiona wasn't clever enough to stage this kind of setup." His eyes darkened.

Their gazes locked. Without another word, they turned and sprinted toward the hospital office.

A doctor handed them a canvas bag.

Evelyn pulled out a phone. The lock screen illuminated, displaying Sebastian's birthday.

Sebastian's brow furrowed.

In the call log, the name "Isabella Langley" stood out like a neon sign.

"It was her all along."

At the Roland family villa, Isabella leaned against the doorframe, her red lips curling in mockery.

"That idiot is finally dead? What wonderful news."

Evelyn seized her wrist. "You told her to take those pills?"

"Let go!" Isabella wrenched free. "She chose to kill herself. Not my problem."

"Do you have any idea what that combination does to a person?"

Isabella threw back her head and laughed. "Don't play saint now. Weren't you praying for her death when she ruined your life?"

Evelyn's expression turned glacial.

"I'll prove it was you."

As she turned to leave, Isabella's icy whisper followed her. "Dead girls tell no tales."

The funeral wreaths still lingered at the entrance of Château Blanc.

Though the police had cleared the winery's name, customers had vanished like morning mist.

"Bad luck," a server muttered under his breath.

Evelyn stood in the empty hall, crushing the pill box in her grip.

The surveillance footage replayed in her mind.

Fiona collapsing.

Isabella's triumphant smirk.

This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 220

Sebastian Valdemar moved faster than expected.

By dawn the next day, the winery's official account released a bombshell announcement—the establishment of the Laurent Mental Health Foundation.

The statement clearly outlined free counseling and treatment services for all young people struggling with psychological issues.

Evelyn Roland had been tossing and turning all night, agonizing over the winery's tarnished reputation.

She'd even considered relocating the entire business to another city for a fresh start.

Then she saw the news.

Her finger hovered over the screen for three full seconds.

She never expected Sebastian to intervene personally.

Even less did she anticipate this masterstroke.

The foundation's announcement swept through like a cleansing breeze, dispelling the dark clouds over the winery.

Sales began a slow but steady recovery.

Young people flocked to sign up for counseling services.

The storm Fiona Valentine had unleashed with her life faded into silence.

On a drizzly morning, Evelyn stood deep in the cemetery under a black umbrella.

Her slender frame was outlined by a simple black dress.

The silk ribbon in her hair fluttered in the wind.

"We could have been friends."

Her gaze lingered on the photograph etched into the headstone.

Fiona's smile was forever frozen at eighteen.

From her bag, Evelyn withdrew an exquisitely crafted piano miniature.

Custom-made for this moment.

"Next life, just be an ordinary, happy person."

Raindrops clung to her lashes.

As she turned, seven masked figures materialized on the steps below.

Black fabric obscured their faces.

Only their murderous eyes remained visible.

"Hand over the Divine Elixir!"

The leader's voice was a rasping growl.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the umbrella. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Take her!"

They lunged as one.

The umbrella slashed through the air with lethal precision.

Two attackers crumpled instantly.

But the numbers were overwhelming.

Evelyn soon found herself outmatched.

Seizing a split-second opening, she spun and fled.

Footsteps pounded behind her.

In the chaos, her phone slipped from her bag.

The screen illuminated with a single glaring name:

Sebastian Valdemar.

The call connected.

The device lay abandoned in the rain.
###Chapter 221

Dark clouds loomed overhead as violent winds whipped up swirling sands, casting the entire city in an oppressive pre-storm gloom.

Inside the CEO's office of Valdemar Group, floor-to-ceiling windows reflected Sebastian Valdemar's tall silhouette. He was casually reviewing documents when the vibrating phone on his desk interrupted his thoughts.

His fingers stilled at the name flashing onscreen.

Evelyn Roland?

They hadn't seen each other in half a month. This sudden call raised his suspicions. The moment he answered, an unexpected male voice assaulted his ears instead of her familiar tone.

"Grab her! The Divine Elixir must be on her!"

The gruff shout mixed with chaotic footsteps, followed by Evelyn's ragged breathing. Then the line went dead, leaving only hollow static.

Sebastian's pupils constricted violently.

Those two words - Divine Elixir - stabbed into his memory like a blade. Months ago during the mining disaster, that mysterious pill had saved his life. He'd later posted a bounty on the dark web just to trace its origin.

Could it be...?

He shot to his feet, long fingers flying across the keyboard. Three seconds later, satellite coordinates locked onto a cemetery on the city outskirts.

"Mr. Valdemar! The board meeting is about to—"

Theodore Ashcroft barged in with an armful of files, only to be shoved aside as Sebastian streaked past like a released arrow. "Cancel all appointments," came the terse command.

A black sports car became a blur on the highway. Sebastian's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel, Evelyn's pale face flashing through his mind. If his momentary curiosity had endangered her...

Meanwhile, on the desolate grounds outside the cemetery, Evelyn staggered against a gravestone. Blood gushed from her waist, blooming a grotesque crimson stain across her beige trench coat.

Five black-clad figures advanced in a semicircle. The leader twirled a dagger with a cold smirk. "Hand over the Divine Elixir, and we'll make it quick."

"I don't know what you're talking about," she panted, heels hitting solid stone.

"Playing dumb?" The man lunged without warning, blade aimed at her throat. "Ask the devil in hell then!"

Steel flashed—

A dark shadow materialized like a specter. The sickening crunch of shattering bones preceded the attacker flying several meters like a ragdoll.

Familiar cologne enveloped her.

"Hold on." Sebastian caught her collapsing form with one arm while deflecting another blade with his free hand. Warm blood splattered across his chiseled profile, painting eerie patterns.

Evelyn's lips moved soundlessly. Darkness flooded her vision, the last image searing into her consciousness—those crimson-ringed eyes burning with fury.
###Chapter 222

Sebastian's pupils constricted violently. The woman in his arms was drenched in blood, her body temperature frighteningly low like a block of ice.

The black-clad men exchanged glances before retreating reluctantly.

He removed his suit jacket and wrapped Evelyn securely. She felt weightless as he carried her effortlessly into the car.

Evelyn's eyelashes trembled. Even unconscious, her expression remained tormented, as if trapped in an inescapable nightmare.

The elevator at Valdemar Tower ascended directly to the penthouse.

Sebastian carried her down the corridor, his leather shoes muffled against the plush carpet. Only after placing her on the office sofa did he realize his back was drenched in sweat.

"A hospital would be safer," he murmured, fingers absently tracing the armrest. "But Olivia can't handle any more shocks right now."

The first aid kit landed heavily on the coffee table.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he stared at her bloodied collar. After a hesitation, his fingers brushed the first button.

The shirt slipped away, revealing a vicious wound. Fresh blood seeped from below her collarbone, staining the sofa cushions.

"Mr. Valdemar, the meeting materials—"

Documents scattered across the floor. The manager's glasses slid down his nose as he froze mid-step.

Sebastian materialized like a specter before the sofa. The room temperature plummeted.

"Out."

The manager scrambled backward, nearly catching his fingers in the door. Pressing his ear against the wood, his expression suddenly cleared with understanding.

"So the boss prefers this type?"

Inside, Sebastian dabbed alcohol-soaked cotton against the wound. Evelyn whimpered faintly in her unconscious state.

"Bear with it," he softened his movements. "Almost done."

When Evelyn awoke, the first thing she noticed was the faint scent of sandalwood. She twitched her fingers, sending sharp pain radiating from her shoulder.

"Don't move."

Sebastian stood silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows. Noticing her consciousness, he poured a glass of water.

"Were they after the Divine Elixir?"

Their fingers brushed as she accepted the glass. Both recoiled simultaneously, nearly shattering it.

"About today—"

"I'll handle it." He checked his watch. "Rest here. I'll escort you home after my meeting."

Pausing at the door, he added without turning, "Fresh clothes are in the dressing room."

Only when the door clicked shut did Evelyn realize she wore his shirt. The subtle ambergris scent enveloped her, inexplicably soothing.
###Chapter 223

Sebastian's suit jacket still carried a faint trace of ambergris. Evelyn watched his retreating figure, the wound between her shoulder blades throbbing with sudden pain. She bit her lip to stifle a gasp, but her trembling hand knocked over a glass on the coffee table.

The shattering sound was followed by a glow from her phone wedged between the couch cushions.

[Mr. Valdemar, someone on the dark web is offering a billion for the Divine Elixir formula.]

Evelyn's finger hovered above the screen. The message slithered into her vision like a venomous serpent. She remembered Sebastian's bloodstained hands in the mine shaft—proof he'd never stopped hunting for answers.

"Of course..." Her lips curled into a mirthless smile as the jacket slid from her shoulders. Fresh blood bloomed across the beige upholstery, vivid as the crimson moon over the mines that night.

The taxi driver glanced at his rearview mirror for the third time.

"Miss, do you need a hospital?"

Evelyn concealed her bloodied hand in the shadows. "Stop at the next alley." She counted out bills, leaving faint scarlet smudges on their edges.

Rusted hinges screeched as she pushed open the abandoned pharmaceutical factory's gate.

Joanna froze mid-experiment, the liquid in her test tube emitting an eerie blue glow. "Boss?" Her goggles clattered onto the counter as she knocked over two racks of petri dishes.

The metallic tang of blood filled the air. Evelyn leaned against the doorframe with a strained chuckle. "Still have that bloodhound nose, I see."

"You're hit?" Joanna peeled back the blood-soaked fabric and gasped. Three knife wounds resembled viper fangs—the deepest one exposed a sliver of white bone.

"Too many strays at the cemetery." Evelyn collapsed onto the operating table, watching the flickering overhead lights. "Check who's been stockpiling Rh-negative blood lately."

Joanna's forceps tightened around the alcohol swab. "The Elixir again?"

Amid the hum of refrigeration units, Evelyn closed her eyes. The blinding "1 billion" on her phone screen merged with Sebastian's fathomless gaze. The surgical lamp burned crimson against her eyelids—just like the rain-soaked night when he'd cradled her face with bloodied hands.
###Chapter 224

The laboratory was silent except for the rhythmic tapping of keyboards.

Joanna focused intently on the screen, her fingers flying across the keys. Evelyn reclined in her chair with closed eyes, long lashes casting delicate shadows beneath them.

"Strange..."

Joanna suddenly stopped typing and turned to Evelyn. "The usable footage from the cemetery surveillance has been deleted. Those men in black vanished without a trace."

Evelyn slowly opened her eyes, a cold glint flashing in their depths. "Stop investigating." She stood, her black trench coat swaying slightly with the movement. "If they dared strike in broad daylight, they’ve already covered their tracks."

"Should I arrange for bodyguards?" Joanna frowned. "We got lucky this time, but next—"

"No." Evelyn cut her off. "More people will only get in the way."

After seeing Joanna out, the lab fell into silence once more.

Outside the window, the night was ink-black. Evelyn stood by the glass, her reflection showing a profile as cool as moonlight. She flicked the switch, and artificial light instantly banished the darkness.

With practiced ease, she retrieved the first-aid kit and lifted the hem of her shirt. The wound had scabbed over, the dark red crust stark against her pale skin.

Just as she reached for the antiseptic, faint footsteps sounded behind her.

"Who's there?"

Evelyn whirled around—and met a pair of smiling, peach-blossom eyes.

The man wore a simple white shirt, its collar slightly open to reveal elegant collarbones. Bathed in the light, he seemed to glow with a soft radiance.

"Quite the fierce greeting, Ms. Roland." He held up his phone, the screen displaying a job posting. "I'm here about the assistant position."

He took a step forward, the corner of his mouth tilting in a lazy smirk. "Silas Eisner. Pleasure to meet you."

Only then did Evelyn recall posting the vacancy. She cleared her throat. "My apologies. It's been a hectic week."

As she handed him a glass of water, their fingers brushed—and an inexplicable sense of familiarity washed over her.

That voice... Had she heard it somewhere before?
###Chapter 225

"Miss Roland?"

Silas Eisner set down his water glass, brows slightly furrowed. The woman before him had remained frozen in the same stance for three full minutes.

Evelyn Roland's pupils constricted abruptly.

Memories flooded back—Olivia Valdemar's terrified, distorted face, the glinting surface of the pool, the cacophony of screams... and that silver brooch being handed to her.

Her head snapped up.

The handsome face before her perfectly overlapped with the figure who'd extended a helping hand in her moment of crisis.

"So it was you."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she retrieved the brooch from her pocket. The silver surface gleamed coldly under the light, resting quietly in her palm.

Silas's gaze dropped to the brooch, his lips curving into a meaningful smile.

"Surprising. You actually remember me."

He didn't take it immediately. Evelyn followed his line of sight and noticed the tiny inscription on the brooch's underside.

"See this engraving?" Silas tapped the text with a slender finger. "Should be familiar to you, Senior Roland?"

"St. John's Medical College?" Evelyn's eyes widened. "You're—"

"Class of 2015, Clinical Medicine." His boyish grin revealed sharp canines. "Getting into our alma mater was my proudest achievement."

The tension dissolved instantly.

"So you're my junior." A soft laugh escaped her as she pressed the brooch into his hand. "Something this valuable should return to its owner."

She paused, expression turning earnest. "And about that day—thank you."

"Just doing my duty." He pocketed the brooch, gaze intent. "Regarding the assistant position..."

"You're hired." Evelyn stood, extending her hand formally. "Welcome to Aether Medical Lab."

Silas blinked, then scrambled to shake her hand. "I won't let you down."

Mid-conversation, his eyes caught the bloodstain on her collar.

"You're injured?"

"Minor scratch." She retreated half a step smoothly. "There's a first aid kit in the lab. I'll handle it."

Glancing at the darkening sky outside, she added, "Let's end here today. Report tomorrow for orientation—I'll introduce you to another colleague."

Silas took the hint and bid farewell.

Meanwhile, at the Roland Estate.

Night draped the grounds like ink, tree shadows swaying. A black Maybach crunched through fallen leaves, coming to a silent stop in the courtyard's center.

The door opened. Polished oxfords met flagstone. The man's tall silhouette stretched long under the streetlamp, his tailored suit radiating an impenetrable chill.
###Chapter 226

The night was ink-black, the moonlight casting a cold gleam on the black sedan parked in the courtyard.

"Sebastian Valdemar, how long do you plan to hide?"

The low voice carried an icy edge, cutting through the silence of the garden.

Sebastian stepped out from behind the car, his tall frame casting a long shadow under the streetlight. "Waiting," he said flatly, his gaze scanning the surroundings.

"Waiting?" Alexander Roland let out a humorless laugh, his eyes flickering toward the faint figures lurking in the shadows. "You've surrounded the Roland estate like a fortress. Quite the show of force."

The air grew thick with tension.

"Just precautions," Sebastian replied, his tone steady. "Times are uncertain."

"Precautions?" Alexander's eyes sharpened like blades. "Since when does an outsider get to decide how my sister should be protected?"

A sudden gust of wind sent dead leaves skittering across the ground.

Sebastian leaned against the car, fingers tapping lightly on the door. "Some threats can't be ignored."

"Hmph." Alexander closed the distance between them in one stride. "Then tell me, Sebastian—what gives you the right to interfere in Roland family affairs?"

Dappled shadows swayed between them, the moonlight drawing a stark line across the ground.

Sebastian lifted his gaze, something dark swirling in his eyes. "That answer isn't mine to give."

"Spare me the theatrics." Alexander scoffed. "If you won't speak plainly, then leave."

A distant branch snapped.

"Last warning," Alexander bit out. "Stay away from my sister."

Sebastian straightened, the air around him turning glacial. "Let her tell me that herself."

The front door creaked open.

Old Joy peeked out, beads of sweat forming on his forehead as he took in the standoff. He retreated inside and dialed with trembling fingers.

"Miss Evelyn, you need to come home immediately."

On the other end, Evelyn Roland had just finished changing her bandages. "What's wrong?"

"Master Alexander and Mr. Valdemar..." Joy whispered, "they're having a confrontation in the courtyard."

Evelyn grabbed her coat and bolted for the door. "I'm on my way."
###Chapter 227

The night was deep, with street lamps casting mottled shadows. Among the swaying trees, Sebastian Valdemar stood tall like a pine, his face obscured in the darkness.

"Mr. Valdemar, you should leave." Alexander Roland's lips curled into a cold smile. "Our humble Roland family can't handle such a grand display."

His sharp gaze swept over the black-suited bodyguards, his tone growing even more cutting. "My sister's safety is none of your concern."

Evelyn Roland had just stepped out of the car when she sensed the tension in the air. She had never seen her usually gentle third brother so confrontational.

She intended to observe from the shadows, but as the standoff escalated, she had no choice but to step forward. Her slender fingers tightened around her bag strap as she positioned herself beside Alexander, discreetly studying his expression.

When she turned, she met Sebastian's penetrating gaze. A cigarette dangled between his fingers, its ember flickering, casting his chiseled features in and out of the smoke.

"We need to talk," he said, his voice low.

Alexander scoffed, interrupting him. "What's left to discuss? Even you—"

Before he could finish, Sebastian shifted his attention solely to Evelyn. The air grew thick with silence.

Alexander's face darkened with fury at being ignored. "Sebastian Valdemar, you—"

"Third Brother."

The soft address made Alexander stiffen. He turned to her, disbelief and complex emotions swirling in his eyes.

It was the first time Evelyn had called him that.

Though they had grown close since her return to the Roland family, twenty years of separation had left an invisible barrier between them. That single word—like a key—gently unlocked something in his heart.

Seeing his stunned expression, Evelyn pressed her lips together. "There are some private matters I need to settle with him. You should go back first—Mom and Dad will be waiting."

Another "Third Brother" shattered his resistance. After shooting Sebastian a warning glare, Alexander finally turned and left.

Watching him disappear inside, Evelyn exhaled in relief. She walked to the stone bench in the courtyard, her fingertips brushing the cool surface.

"Have a seat," she said, gesturing to Sebastian. "It's better to clear the air."

The delicate aroma of tea rose as she pushed a celadon cup toward him. "Try it. Premium Longjing."

Sebastian stubbed out his cigarette, his well-defined fingers tracing the rim of the cup. After a moment of silence, he spoke abruptly. "I came to apologize."

The night breeze carried his rare admission of guilt. "Those rumors online about the Divine Elixir—they started with me. I never expected it would cause you so much trouble."

He turned to meet her gaze, his words deliberate. "I'm sorry."
###Chapter 228

The room was so quiet the ticking of the clock echoed clearly.

Sebastian Valdemar suddenly heard a soft chuckle.

Evelyn Roland turned to face him, her lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained cold.

"I saw the messages on your phone."

"At this point, I don't want to dwell on it."

She paused, tapping her fingers lightly against the desk. "But your previous investigation did cause me quite a bit of trouble."

The atmosphere between them was eerily calm.

Sebastian set down his teacup, the porcelain clinking against the wood.

"What exactly is this Divine Elixir? Why are they so desperate to get it?"

"My blood."

Evelyn said it plainly, as if discussing the weather.

Sebastian's pupils constricted.

She had just revealed the secret so casually?

"I wasn't planning to keep it from you any longer."

Evelyn saw his shock and sighed. "Absurd, isn't it? Even I don't understand why my blood has this effect."

She pressed her lips together. "I'm still investigating the reason behind it."

If not for Charles Lowell's protection all these years, she would have been in grave danger long ago.

Sebastian's expression darkened, his chest tightening.

"If the Divine Elixir is your blood..." His voice turned grave. "Then you're in far more danger than we thought. If they discover the truth, not just you—everyone around you will be at risk."

"They shouldn't know yet."

Sebastian's gaze burned into her. "But you need to leave. Now."

This was a question Evelyn had agonized over countless times.

She lowered her lashes, silent for a long moment.

If her family suffered because of her, she could never forgive herself.

"I understand." She finally spoke. "I'll leave tomorrow."

She had just returned to the Roland family. She refused to become their curse.

"Good." Sebastian nodded. "I'll come for you tomorrow."

"Come for me?" Evelyn frowned. "I can handle it myself."

"You're moving in with me."

Evelyn shot to her feet, the chair screeching against the floor.

"What did you say?"

"My estate has top-tier security. It's the safest place for you." Sebastian stood as well. "Besides, I bear responsibility for this."

"The Divine Elixir existed long before you got involved."

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Thank you for saving me today, but I'll handle the rest myself."

Living with Sebastian?

Preposterous.

She turned to leave, but a strong hand suddenly seized her wrist.
###Chapter 229

Evelyn Roland turned to leave when a strong hand suddenly clamped around her wrist.

She spun around and found herself drowning in Sebastian Valdemar's bottomless gaze.

"The Rolands still don't know about your kidnapping," he said in a low voice. "And you have no intention of telling them."

"Why should I?" Evelyn frowned, trying to pull away but failing. Mid-sentence, her eyes widened in realization.

"Sebastian Valdemar!" Her voice turned icy. "Are you threatening me? If I refuse to move in with you, you'll expose this to my family?"

Upstairs by the floor-to-ceiling window, Isabella Langley dug her nails into her palms.

She glared at the entangled pair below, jealousy burning in her eyes.

Sebastian's grip on Evelyn's wrist was unyielding, their bodies nearly touching.

"That bitch..." Isabella seethed, itching to rush down and tear them apart.

Sebastian remained silent for a long moment, his dark eyes growing even more inscrutable.

"My place is the safest," he finally said, his tone brooking no argument. "I can't trust anywhere else."

Evelyn was caught off guard by his sudden concern.

She took a deep breath. "Let go."

Sebastian immediately released her.

Clutching her bag strap, Evelyn hesitated before relenting. "Don't come for me tomorrow. I don't want another confrontation between you and my brother."

The tension in Sebastian's jaw eased. "Fine."

Watching the black Maybach disappear down the driveway, Evelyn rubbed her temples.

Had she really just agreed to live with Sebastian Valdemar?

The thought made her pulse quicken. Images of their daily interactions flashed through her mind, warming the tips of her ears.

"Evelyn, you're back?"

Sophia Roland's voice snapped her back to reality. In the living room, Edward Roland was speaking with his wife, who beckoned her over.

"Alexander is in the study," Sophia said, pulling her onto the couch and stroking her cheek worriedly. "You look exhausted."

"I'm fine. The company is running smoothly," Evelyn forced a smile.

Edward set down his teacup. "Don't overwork yourself. Delegate more."

"Your father's right," Sophia agreed. "Look at you—you've lost color in your face."

Evelyn lowered her head to hide her unease.

She couldn't possibly tell them what she'd just agreed to.
###Chapter 230

Edward Roland set down the financial magazine, his eyes crinkling with amusement. "That incident at the vineyard would've given anyone a migraine. Yet you handled it flawlessly."

Sophia Roland gazed at her daughter's delicate profile, a pang of sorrow tightening her chest. She'd missed twenty years of this child's life. Now reunited, the girl stood before her as a fully capable woman.

"Evelyn, I'm so proud of you."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she tucked a stray lock behind Evelyn's ear. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, bathing the trio in golden warmth.

Evelyn's lips curved upward at her parents' approving expressions.

"Thank you, Mom. Dad."

"Sweetheart, no need for formalities with us."

Sophia chuckled, patting her daughter's shoulder. But Evelyn flinched—just for a split second—before schooling her features. The sudden pallor didn't escape notice.

"You're hurt?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. She quickly tucked her wrist deeper into her sleeve. "Just a minor fall. Already seen the doctor."

Edward stood abruptly, teacup clattering. "We're taking you to Massachusetts General for a full examination."

"Really, I'm fine." Evelyn caught her mother's hand, swinging it playfully. "Your daughter knows how to take care of herself now."

She moved behind Sophia, kneading her shoulders gently. "You're the one who's been worrying over the vineyard, aren't you?"

Sophia's eyes glistened. "I just hate seeing you bear everything alone."

"I'm a Roland." Evelyn winked. "Anyone who messes with me answers to you two first."

Laughter bubbled through the drawing room. The sound floated up the spiral staircase like shards of glass to Isabella Langley's ears.

At the landing, her nails dug crescent moons into her palms. The cozy scene below burned her vision—and her pride.

Why?

Why did this interloper waltz in and steal everything that rightfully belonged to her? Even that man had fallen under Evelyn's spell.

Isabella's chest heaved as she glared at the figure below. Her skirt snapped like a whip as she spun away.

Just you wait, Evelyn Roland.

Downstairs, Evelyn hesitated before speaking. "Mom, Dad... There's something I need to discuss. I might not be home much in the coming days."
###Chapter 231

Sophia Roland's teacup paused mid-air, the liquid inside rippling slightly. She lifted her gaze to her daughter, brows knitting together. "Why bring this up so suddenly?"

Edward Roland set aside his newspaper, concern evident behind his glasses. "Isn't the winery stable now?"

Evelyn Roland tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her teacup. "The new season's tasting event requires extensive preparation. It would be more convenient to stay near the winery."

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a soft glow on her profile.

"Mother, you know I've always valued my independence." She reached for Sophia's wrist, her voice softening. "I promise to visit every weekend."

Sophia sighed and tapped Evelyn's forehead lightly. "You've always been stubborn, even as a child."

At dawn the next day, Evelyn tiptoed downstairs with her suitcase in tow.

Pushing open the front door, she inhaled the crisp morning air laced with dew. But her breath caught when she saw the scene in the courtyard.

A black Maybach waited beneath the plane tree, its window rolled down to reveal Sebastian Valdemar's sharp profile.

"You—" Evelyn instinctively glanced back at the second-floor windows before lowering her voice. "Why are you here so early?"

Sebastian took her luggage, the corner of his mouth lifting. "Didn't want to risk you changing your mind."

As the car pulled into the Valdemar estate, sunlight broke through the clouds. Evelyn stood by the guest room window, lost in thought as she gazed at the blooming roses in the garden.

A knock interrupted her reverie.

She turned to find Sebastian at the door, holding a steaming cup of floral tea.

"Tired?" His eyes flickered to the faint sheen of sweat at her temple. "Rest for a while. We'll go shopping this afternoon."

The midday sun was warm when Evelyn descended the stairs, dressed and ready. Sebastian waited by the foyer, his rolled-up sleeves revealing toned forearms beneath a slate-gray casual shirt.

They walked along the tree-lined path in comfortable silence.

"Does the wound still hurt?" Sebastian stopped abruptly.

Evelyn shook her head, but before she could respond, she collided with a solid wall of muscle. Stumbling back, she was steadied by Sebastian's firm grip on her shoulders.

"Miss Roland? What a coincidence."

Silas Eisner stood three paces away, his damp hair still dripping. His gaze flickered between them before curving into a knowing smile. "And this is...?"

"A friend," Evelyn answered quickly, her nails digging into her palms.

Silas tilted his head, studying Sebastian before chuckling. "A friend who makes you this nervous must be quite special."
###Chapter 232

Silas Eisner blinked his peach-blossom eyes and drawled, "After all, our Aether Research Lab—"

"Exactly! No need for formalities between friends."

Evelyn Roland's heart skipped a beat. She swiftly cut him off, shooting him a warning glare while forcing a polite smile. "We're in a hurry. Let's catch up another time."

She gritted her teeth. Sebastian Valdemar only knew about her medical skills, not her connection to the Aether Research Lab.

Silas froze, looking at her with puppy-dog eyes like an abandoned stray.

"I'll get lovesick if I don't see you."

His mournful tone made Evelyn sound like some heartless playgirl.

She paused mid-step and glared over her shoulder. "See you tomorrow."

Only then did Silas leave satisfied, tossing her a flirtatious wink before disappearing.

Evelyn exhaled in relief once he was gone.

Too close. That idiot almost blew her cover.

She stole a glance at the man beside her, meeting Sebastian's probing gaze.

"Promises?"

"Lovesick?"

"Meeting tomorrow?"

His sarcastic tone dripped with enough vinegar to sour the air.

"We just met yesterday," Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. "Who knows what's wrong with him—"

She abruptly cut herself off.

Wait. Why was she explaining?

At most, they were just temporary roommates.

"The mall's here. Let's go." She quickly changed the subject, striding ahead.

Sebastian remained rooted, watching her retreating figure with an unconscious smirk.

In a corner of Starbucks, Isabella Langley stirred her coffee elegantly before brightening at the entrance. "Cousin!"

Vanessa Valrose stormed in and plopped down, gulping half her coffee in one go.

"Well?" Isabella masked her distaste.

Vanessa leaned in conspiratorially. "I stayed up all night and finally came up with a brilliant idea."

"What idea?"

"Marry Evelyn off!" Vanessa whispered, eyes gleaming with calculation. "Once she's wed, she'll have to leave the Roland family for good!"
###Chapter 233

"Marriage?"

Isabella Langley scoffed, leaning back lazily in her chair, her fingers lightly tapping the rim of her coffee cup.

"That's it? You stayed up all night just to come up with this ridiculous idea?" She rolled her eyes. "That girl hasn't even dated anyone. By the time she gets married and leaves, it'll be too late."

Vanessa Valrose took a slow sip of her coffee, lowering her voice mysteriously. "Hear me out."

Isabella raised a skeptical eyebrow, gesturing for her to continue.

"I have a distant cousin, Oliver Valrose." A calculating glint flashed in Vanessa's eyes. "On the surface, he's the most presentable young talent from the Valrose family—charming, handsome, and well-mannered."

She suddenly smirked. "But in reality, he's a scoundrel wrapped in gold, specializing in deceiving naive girls."

Isabella's eyes lit up. "You want him to..."

"Exactly." Vanessa looked smug. "I've already made arrangements with him. He's an expert at handling someone as inexperienced as Evelyn Roland."

Isabella clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. The memory of Sebastian Valdemar's gaze at Evelyn last night sent a surge of jealousy through her.

"I'll create an opportunity today." She stood abruptly, her sunglasses hiding the malice in her eyes. "Tell your cousin to wait outside the Roland estate."

The sharp click of her heels echoed as she strode out of the café without a backward glance.

Vanessa watched her leave, a knowing smile curling at her lips.

The next evening.

"Isabella, what a surprise that you have time to take a walk with me today." Sophia Roland affectionately linked arms with her younger daughter.

Isabella smiled sweetly. "Since Evelyn moved out, I didn’t want you to feel lonely."

As they strolled toward the estate gates, Isabella spotted a black sedan parked nearby. Her phone conveniently rang.

"Mom, I need to take this." She hurried to the corner and quickly sent a text: When the car comes, make sure he plays the hero.

The black sedan suddenly accelerated, heading straight for Sophia.

At the last second, a figure in gray lightning-fast pulled her to safety. The car roared past them, missing by inches.

"Are you alright, ma'am?" The man's voice was gentle, his tailored suit exuding an air of refinement.

Isabella rushed over, feigning panic. "Mom! You scared me to death!"

"Thanks to this..." Sophia, still shaken, studied her rescuer.

"Oliver Valrose, a graduate student at Stanford." He introduced himself with impeccable manners.

"What a coincidence!" Isabella exclaimed with feigned delight. "My sister Evelyn also graduated from Stanford!"

Oliver's ears turned slightly pink. "I... I've always admired Evelyn."

Sophia's eyes brightened. She warmly clasped his hand. "What a wonderful connection! Young people should spend more time together."
###Chapter 234

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows as Evelyn Roland hung the last garment in the walk-in closet.

Sebastian Valdemar had prepared a room that balanced minimalist elegance with understated luxury, every detail reflecting his impeccable taste.

Exhausted, she collapsed onto the plush bed. Just as she closed her eyes, her stomach growled in protest.

"Grr—"

An enticing aroma suddenly wafted through the air.

Like an alert kitten, she lifted her nose and followed the scent.

In the kitchen, Sebastian stood focused over a sizzling frying pan, expertly flipping a sunny-side-up egg.

Dressed in soft cotton loungewear, the gray apron strings accentuating his lean waist. His slender fingers moved the spatula with practiced ease.

Morning light gilded his profile, even the shadow cast by his lashes seemed perfectly placed.

Evelyn unconsciously held her breath.

"Done staring?"

His deep voice startled her, sending heat rushing to her ears.

"I—I was just hungry," she stammered, hastily pulling out a dining chair.

He set breakfast before her—golden eggs with crisp edges, buttery toast, steaming milk.

"Didn't expect the CEO to have such skills," she quipped, trying to diffuse the tension.

He untied the apron with the grace of removing a silk tie. A faint smile played on his lips. "Try it."

A memory flashed—twenty years ago in the Valdemar mansion's empty kitchen, a scrawny boy straining on tiptoes to reach bread in the cabinet.

All those solitary nights now swirled in the depths of his eyes.

"I'm going to Stanford today," Evelyn blurted.

Sebastian's fingers stilled. "Reason?"

"To submit an assignment." She poked at the egg yolk. "I'll be back soon."

Silence settled over the dining room. His gaze lingered on the crown of her head, darkening.

Some things she'd never know. Like how he'd deliberated thirty minutes over ingredients this morning. How he'd secretly cataloged every food preference of hers.

"I'll drive you." Three measured words were all he offered.
###Chapter 235

Sebastian Valdemar's slender fingers curled around the milk glass, his gaze never leaving Evelyn Roland's figure.

"I'll take you."

His deep voice carried an unyielding command.

"No need."

Evelyn tipped her head back, finishing the last drop of milk before setting the glass down gently. She caught the deepening furrow between his brows.

"Relax. I can take care of myself."

Slinging her backpack over one shoulder, she strode toward the door without looking back.

Sebastian watched her retreating figure, his knuckles tapping a sharp rhythm against the glass. He pulled out his phone and dialed.

"Follow her."

Theodore Ashcroft understood immediately. "Understood, Mr. Valdemar."

Thirty minutes later, outside Stanford University.

Evelyn had just stepped out of the car when a bouquet of crimson roses blocked her path.

"Good morning, Evelyn."

Oliver Valrose stood before her in an immaculate white suit, his tie perfectly knotted, his smile calculated. He deliberately slowed his speech as he extended the roses.

A small crowd had already begun to gather.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. The Valrose family's notorious playboy—she'd heard the rumors.

"Move."

Her quiet command froze Oliver's smile in place.

Across the street, the tinted window of a black Maybach lowered slightly. Sebastian's gaze was colder than steel.

"Don't be like that," Oliver said, adjusting his expression and lowering his voice. "Your stepmother already agreed to our engagement."

The cloying scent of roses assaulted her senses. Evelyn took a sharp step back.

"Take your flowers and get lost."

Gasps rippled through the onlookers. Oliver's face darkened, but before he could react, a saccharine voice cut in.

"Little sister, is that any way to speak to Mr. Valrose?"

Isabella Langley approached in sky-high heels, her Chanel suit glinting under the sunlight. She linked arms with Oliver, flashing Evelyn a triumphant smile.

"Mother handpicked your fiancé. Don't disrespect her kindness."

Evelyn studied the pair before her, then suddenly laughed.

"So you're the matchmaker." She turned to Oliver. "Heard you got a model pregnant last month?"

The crowd erupted. Oliver's face turned ashen. Isabella's smile faltered.

Inside the Maybach, Sebastian's lips curved slightly. He rolled down the window further, watching the slender figure at the university gates.

"Drive," he ordered the chauffeur. "To the office."

As the car pulled away, the rearview mirror captured Evelyn walking through the crowd with effortless grace, her posture straight as a bamboo stalk.
###Chapter 236

"Who said anything about introducing men to me?" Evelyn Roland's lips curled into a cold smirk. "You've dated so many yourself, yet none worked out. As for me..."

She deliberately let her words trail off.

"If I date someone, it'll be with marriage in mind. Not like certain people who change partners as often as they change clothes."

Isabella Langley's face turned deathly pale.

"What nonsense are you spouting? When have I ever dated anyone?" She forced a haughty tone. "Mother only wants what's best for you. Oliver Valrose is exceptional, yet you refuse to even meet him—"

Before she could finish, a tall figure stepped between them.

Sebastian Valdemar had appeared without warning, shielding Evelyn with subtle protectiveness.

Isabella's eyes lit up with delight—until she noticed his stance. Her expression twisted instantly.

"Mr. Valdemar..." Her voice trembled.

Sebastian didn't even glance at her.

"Isabella," he said, his voice icy. "Evelyn's affairs are none of your concern. Since you think so highly of Oliver, why don't you pursue him yourself?"

"You—!"

Isabella dug her nails into her palms but didn't dare lash out in front of Sebastian. She spun on her heel and stormed off, shooting Oliver a venomous glare on her way out.

Oliver immediately caught her meaning. Seeing Sebastian's hand on Evelyn's shoulder, he stepped forward.

"Hey man, first come first ser—"

Sebastian's gaze sliced toward him.

That look was sharp as a blade, carrying suffocating pressure.

Oliver froze, a cold sweat breaking out down his back.

"Stay away from her." Sebastian's voice was dangerously low. "Or else..."

He left the threat hanging.

Oliver nodded instinctively. By the time he regained his senses, he was already fleeing. The carefully prepared roses were tossed aside, soon swept into a trash bin by a janitor.

Evelyn rubbed her temples.

"What are you doing here?"

"Passing by." Sebastian's expression didn't change. "Need me to walk you in?"

"No." She took a step back. "I can handle small fry like him on my own."

With that, she turned and left, her retreating figure radiating distance.

Sebastian watched her go, his fingertips still tingling from the brush of her hair.

He glanced at his empty hand, his eyes darkening.

Back in his car, he stripped off the cologne-tainted jacket with disgust and changed into a fresh one.

Meanwhile—

"Useless!" Isabella shoved Oliver hard in an alley. "You can't even handle one woman!"

Oliver's face darkened, still haunted by that terrifying glare.

"There are plenty of secluded spots on campus," Isabella hissed. "Next time she's alone..."

Oliver's eyes gleamed.

"Relax," he licked his lips. "There isn't a woman I can't conquer."

Elsewhere, Evelyn paused after submitting her assignment.

Her instincts prickled—someone was following her.

The hairs on her nape stood on end.

Without alerting her stalker, she quickened her pace toward the crowded school gates.
###Chapter 237

Evelyn Roland burst through the school gates, her gaze instantly locking onto the familiar black Maybach parked across the street.

Sebastian Valdemar's car was still there.

She tightened her grip on her backpack straps and hurried across the road.

Inside the car, Sebastian's eyes remained fixed on the school entrance. When he saw Evelyn running out with panic written across her face, his brow furrowed.

"Turn around."

Theodore Ashcroft swiftly turned the steering wheel, executing a smooth U-turn before pulling up right in front of Evelyn.

The moment the door opened, she slipped inside.

"Someone's following me," she said breathlessly.

Sebastian's gaze swept over her, noting the slight tremble in her fingers.

"Now you'll let me drive you?"

Evelyn nodded, only then noticing he'd changed into a dark gray suit. Earlier at the school gates, he'd been wearing black.

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me."

"Okay. Thank you."

Theodore stifled a laugh, keeping his eyes firmly on the road. In the rearview mirror, the CEO's expression was noticeably softer than usual.

Unnoticed by them, a silver sedan quietly trailed behind.

Oliver Valrose clenched the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white as he glared at the luxury car worth millions ahead. A vehicle like that would take him a decade of hard work to afford.

"Playing hard to get," he sneered before pressing down on the accelerator.

The Maybach entered the most exclusive villa district in the city center.

Sebastian stepped out first, shielding the top of the car door with his hand. Evelyn followed, and they walked side by side into the mansion.

From the bushes in the distance, the rapid clicks of a camera shutter broke the silence.

Oliver captured every moment but couldn't get a clear shot of the man's face. Though the build matched, the suit color was wrong.

"Bitch!" He slammed his fist against the steering wheel before immediately sending the photos to Isabella Langley.

Upon receiving them, Isabella zoomed in with a cold smirk.

"Found yourself a body double?" She flicked through the images disdainfully. "Let's see how long your luck lasts."

Inside the villa, Evelyn finally relaxed.

Sebastian handed her a glass of warm water. When their fingers brushed, she felt the warmth of his palm.

"Don't go out alone these days," he said in a low voice.

Evelyn cradled the cup, letting the heat seep into her fingertips. In that moment, she suddenly realized how comforting it felt to have him by her side.
###Chapter 238

Evelyn Roland had just set down her water glass when her phone screen lit up.

Silas Eisner's name flashed across the display.

"Hello?"

"Evelyn, I've made a new discovery." Silas's voice was warm and polite. "I've compiled all the documents. When would be a good time for you to review them?"

Evelyn glanced at Sebastian Valdemar sitting across from her, recalling his earlier warning.

"I'm tied up at the moment." Her fingers tapped lightly on the table. "Bring the files to this address."

After hanging up, she quickly sent him her location.

Within half an hour, the doorbell rang.

Silas stood at the entrance, arms laden with thick stacks of documents. Sunlight streamed in behind him, casting a golden halo around his silhouette.

"Evelyn." He stepped inside with a smile, but his gaze immediately landed on Sebastian.

Sebastian's expression darkened instantly.

"Drop it and leave." He tossed the icy command over his shoulder before heading upstairs.

Evelyn accepted the files and began flipping through them.

Silas settled onto the sofa, casually surveying the villa's decor. His eyes lingered on the two water glasses on the coffee table, the corner of his mouth lifting almost imperceptibly.

"I'll take my leave now." He rose to go.

Evelyn gave a distracted nod without looking up.

The moment Silas departed, Sebastian descended the stairs.

"Right on schedule?" Evelyn arched a brow.

Without a word, Sebastian retrieved a bottle of disinfectant spray from the cabinet and doused the spot where Silas had sat.

"Was that necessary?" She fought back a laugh.

Only then did he seem satisfied, taking a seat and sipping from his glass.

Suddenly, a piercing alarm shattered the villa's tranquility!

Both sprang to their feet.

"Intruders." Sebastian's eyes turned razor-sharp.

Evelyn swiftly stuffed the documents between the couch cushions.

The alarm cut off abruptly.

"What happened?"

"They disabled it." Before Sebastian could finish, the front door burst open with a crash.

A brown-haired foreigner with piercing green eyes swaggered inside.

Sebastian immediately shielded Evelyn with his body.

"Who let you in?"

The man grinned, revealing unnaturally white teeth.

"Hand over the Divine Elixir."

His Mandarin carried a thick accent.

"What elixir?" Evelyn feigned ignorance.

Outside, a dozen shadowy figures closed in.
###Chapter 239

The sound of chaotic footsteps echoed outside the window. Shadows crowded against the glass—too many to count. Evelyn Roland realized the entire villa was surrounded.

Her fingers trembled as she instinctively grabbed Sebastian Valdemar’s sleeve.

"Don’t be afraid." His hand closed over hers, warm and steady.

A blond man at the front raised his gun, eyes dark with malice. "Hand over the Divine Elixir, or else—"

Before he could finish, he signaled sharply. The door burst open as armed men flooded in.

Sebastian moved to shield Evelyn—then suddenly doubled over in agony. His muscles locked, veins bulging at his temples.

"An attack?" Her chest tightened.

His grip on her wrist turned bruising. "Run."

"I’m a doctor!" She stood her ground.

Something unreadable flashed in his eyes. Then he yanked her toward the staircase.

"After them!" The enraged shout chased them up the steps.

They stumbled into the study. Evelyn watched, stunned, as Sebastian twisted the bronze paperweight on the desk. With a mechanical click, the entire bookshelf slid aside, revealing a hidden passage.

A powerful shove sent her tumbling into the darkness.

"Sebastian!" She whirled, reaching for him—but the stone door was already closing.

"There’s a car at the end," he said, voice eerily calm. "Don’t look back."

"You’re lying!" Her fists pounded against the unyielding stone as tears blurred her vision. The gap narrowed until only his resolute gaze remained.

The door sealed shut just as boots thundered into the room.

"Where are they?"

A sickening thud—someone slammed against furniture. Sebastian’s muffled grunt of pain reached Evelyn through the stone.

She pressed her palm to the cold surface, nails biting into her flesh. Not a sound escaped her.

"Search! She’s still here!"

A tear hit the passage floor. Evelyn turned away, jaw clenched. The tunnel stretched endlessly black—just like the abyss in her chest.
###Chapter 240

"The elixir must be on that woman!"

"Come out now!"

"If you don't show yourself, I'll put a bullet in his head!"

The shrill shouts pierced through the chamber walls. Evelyn Roland's nails dug deep into her palms. Each threat felt like a poisoned arrow, twisting her insides with every word.

A muffled groan of pain from Sebastian Valdemar made her snap her head up.

Blood trickled from the corner of his lips.

Evelyn lunged at the wall, her fingers frantically searching the cold stone surface. Where was the hidden mechanism? Her fingertips brushed against a slight protrusion.

"Who's there?!"

Chaotic footsteps erupted outside.

"Special forces!"

"Drop him!"

A heavy thud echoed through the chaos. Evelyn pressed against the door, listening as the screech of tires faded into the distance.

The stone door rumbled open—just as the icy barrel of a gun pressed against her temple.

The armed man stood like a coiled panther.

His olive-green combat gear clung to his muscular frame. A jagged scar ran down his tanned face. When those hawk-like eyes locked onto her, Evelyn's breath hitched.

The gun lowered slightly.

"They were after the Divine Elixir?"

His voice grated like sandpaper on rough stone.

Evelyn's peripheral vision caught Sebastian lying motionless in a pool of blood. She clenched her trembling fingers and forced herself to meet the man's gaze. "I won't say a word until I know if you're trustworthy."

A slow, unsettling grin twisted his scar.

"You?" He kicked a spent bullet casing at his feet. "Couldn't even handle these amateurs."

"But I know where the formula is hidden." Her own voice sounded eerily calm. "Dead men keep secrets too."

The air turned to ice.

The man's eyes narrowed as his combat boot crushed glass shards underfoot. Without warning, he raised his gun, tilting Evelyn's chin up with the barrel.

"Interesting."

He turned, the movement stirring the metallic scent of blood.

"Take them both."

Two soldiers hauled Sebastian's unconscious form. When someone grabbed her wrist, Evelyn yanked free.

"He needs medical attention!"

The man waved a hand without looking back. A medic rushed forward with a kit. Just as relief began to settle, the sharp click of a gun being cocked cut through the silence.

The cold muzzle pressed against Sebastian's back.
###Chapter 241

"I don't know your intentions." My voice trembled as I stared at the unfamiliar man. "But he's in critical condition..."

My gaze fell on the unconscious Sebastian Valdemar. His face was deathly pale, beads of sweat glistening on his forehead.

The man arched an eyebrow. "Boyfriend?"

"No." The denial slipped out before I realized how absurd it sounded. This wasn't the time for explanations.

"Are you a doctor?"

"Yes."

After a tense silence, he finally stepped aside. "Make it quick."

I rushed to Sebastian, straining to lift his heavy frame. The black-clad soldiers parted like a dark tide, creating a narrow path.

In the bedroom, I gasped for breath as I settled him onto the bed. Through the closing door, I caught the man's piercing hawk-like stare.

The lock clicked shut.

I drew the curtains tight, ensuring complete privacy before picking up the folding knife from the table. Its blade gleamed coldly under the light. Gritting my teeth, I made a shallow cut on my forearm.

As blood welled up, I pried Sebastian's lips apart. Crimson droplets fell onto his pallid mouth like red blossoms blooming on snow.

One drop. Two drops...

My vision blurred while his breathing gradually steadied. The tension in his brow eased, allowing my racing heart to calm.

A memory flashed—him shoving me away, that final glance through the closing vault door.

Why would he go this far for me?

After bandaging my wound and meticulously cleaning all traces of blood, I took a deep breath and opened the door.

The villa remained swarming with black-clad men. I marched straight to the living room where the man sat listening to a subordinate's report.

"Commander Roland, the intel about the Divine Elixir must be with her," a soldier whispered. "Should we employ...persuasive measures?"

The man raised a hand. "Patience." He stood. "Guard them well. If a single hair is harmed, you'll answer to me."

"Yes, sir!"

I descended the stairs. "You have no right to detain us."

He turned, his icy stare sending chills down my spine.

"Miss, do you really think you have a choice?"

I met his gaze squarely. "You've been tailing me since afternoon—all for the Divine Elixir, isn't it?"

His pupils contracted slightly.
###Chapter 242

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting dappled patterns on the hardwood floor.

Evelyn Roland stood by the window, her fingertips lightly tapping against the frame.

She narrowed her eyes.

Just as she suspected.

The person tailing her on campus this afternoon was from this special forces unit.

Not those mysterious foreign operatives in black.

"If those foreigners hadn't intervened, you'd still be lurking in the shadows, wouldn't you?" She turned to face the man, meeting his gaze head-on. "Now that you're exposed, why keep up the act?"

Julian Roland arched an eyebrow.

This woman was sharper than he'd anticipated.

Not only had she detected their surveillance, but she'd also pieced everything together in record time.

Interesting.

Their operation had been flawless—until that slip-up at Stanford University.

And he never expected foreign agents to make their move so soon.

To prevent the Divine Elixir's secrets from falling into the wrong hands, he had no choice but to reveal himself.

"I can let you go," Julian crossed his arms. "On one condition. Tell me what you know about the Divine Elixir."

"No comment."

Evelyn's reply was crisp and final.

She countered, "Why is a special forces unit after the Divine Elixir?"

Their eyes locked in a silent battle of wills.

"I'll give you time to reconsider," Julian said.

Evelyn smirked. "No need."

"Are you sure?"

"As sure as you are about not revealing your motives."

Julian was momentarily speechless.

This woman wasn't just clever—she had a sharp tongue too.

"Then stay put."

He turned on his heel and left, posting guards outside.

When Evelyn tried to follow, they blocked her path.

Back in her room, she discovered her phone was missing.

Damn it!

She punched the mattress in frustration.

Now she was completely cut off from the outside world.

...

The Roland family villa glowed with warm light.

"Mom, Dad, I'm home."

The moment Julian stepped inside, his sister Isabella Langley threw herself into his arms.

"Big brother!" She clung to his arm. "We made all your favorite dishes!"

Their younger brother Alexander Roland joined in. "Let me see if your muscles got even bigger!"

The two hung off him like koalas.

Julian chuckled helplessly as he distributed gifts to his family.

Under the cozy lighting, the household was filled with laughter and joy.

No one could have guessed that the image of that stubborn woman still lingered in his thoughts.
###Chapter 243

Julian Roland studied Alexander with a faint smile. "You've put on some muscle, Alex."

"I've been taking boxing lessons!" Alexander threw a playful punch in the air. "You have to spar with me now that you're back!"

A glint of amusement flashed in Julian's eyes. "Whoever loses does the family's laundry for a month."

"That's not fair!" Alexander's face fell as he bolted toward the kitchen. "Mom!"

Isabella Langley rose to help with dinner preparations, leaving Edward and Julian alone in the living room.

"Weren't you deployed overseas?" Edward set aside his newspaper, brow furrowing. "What brought you back so suddenly?"

Julian's expression darkened.

"Sorry, Dad." He hesitated. "It's... complicated."

"I understand." Edward waved a hand. "Need-to-know basis."

Julian relaxed slightly. "A comrade was critically injured. We need specialized treatment only available here."

Edward nodded without further questions.

Sophia and Isabella emerged from the kitchen carrying dinner.

"Food's ready," Sophia announced.

As the family settled around the table, Julian noticed the empty chair.

"Where's Evelyn?"

The air turned frigid.

Sophia forced a smile. "She's busy with work. Lives across town now—doesn't visit often."

The explanation sounded plausible yet hollow.

Edward placed a rib on Julian's plate. "We can call her later if you'd like."

Julian studied their faces before nodding.

Just as utensils were raised, Isabella produced an envelope from her bag.

"Her life outside seems... eventful." She spread photographs across the tablecloth.

Sophia's hands trembled as she picked one up, her face draining of color.

"This... this can't be..."

Edward turned away after a single glance. "Disgraceful!"

"The license plate's blurred," Isabella sighed theatrically. "Otherwise we could identify the man."

Sophia shoved the photos aside, squeezing her eyes shut.

Julian didn't bother looking. His voice could have frozen hell. "Shameless."

"You've been too lenient with her." His words fell like stones. "Being disowned doesn't excuse this behavior."

Isabella focused on her meal, the ghost of a smirk playing on her lips.

This time, that little bitch wouldn't recover.
###Chapter 244

Sophia Roland's nails dug deep into her palms.

Her gaze fixed on the name "Evelyn Roland" on her phone screen, eyes dark with malice.

"Let's see what tricks you're playing now."

The moment the call connected, Sophia adjusted her breathing and softened her tone.

"Evelyn, where are you? I miss you..."

But a deep male voice answered instead. "Mother."

Sophia's hand trembled, nearly dropping the phone.

That voice... Julian Roland?

In the living room, Julian frowned at the incoming call.

He pressed the speakerphone button.

"Mother, it's me."

At the dining table, all chopsticks froze mid-air.

Alexander was the first to react. "Second Brother, isn't this Evelyn's phone?"

Julian's gaze swept over everyone before settling on Isabella.

"I encountered a suspicious individual during my mission."

He paused. "It turned out to be Evelyn."

Sophia's voice crackled through the phone. "Julian? Why do you have Evelyn's phone?"

Edward abruptly stood. "Explain yourself, Julian!"

Julian placed the phone on the table.

"She's suspected of involvement in illegal drug trafficking."

Isabella covered her mouth, but her eyes gleamed with triumph.

"That's impossible! Evelyn would never—"

Alexander cut her off. "Second Brother, could there be a mistake?"

Expressionless, Julian pulled out another phone.

The screen displayed a photo of Evelyn detained in a private villa.

"She's currently at Sebastian Valdemar's residence."

Sophia's voice rose sharply. "What? The Valdemar family?"

Isabella stared at the photo, her lips curling involuntarily.

"I knew it..."

She muttered under her breath, but Edward snapped, "Isabella!"

Julian pocketed the phone, his tone icy.

"I'll get to the bottom of this."

The dining room fell into dead silence.

Only Sophia's ragged breathing echoed through the phone.

Isabella lowered her head, hiding her triumphant smile.

This time, victory was hers.
###Chapter 245

Evelyn had anticipated Julian's integrity—he would never conceal the truth.

She lowered her lashes, her lips twitching slightly as she feigned hesitation.

"Julian, bring her back immediately!" Sophia slammed her hands on the table, rising to her feet. "I must teach that shameless girl a lesson!"

Julian swiftly steadied his mother by the shoulders.

His gaze swept over the photos scattered across the coffee table, his brow furrowing.

"Mother, calm down."

He picked up a photo and examined it closely. "This man is Sebastian Valdemar. The villa is indeed where I found them."

"But my men confirmed the entire property bears only Sebastian's presence. Evelyn's belongings were confined to a single small room—clearly a temporary arrangement."

As he spoke, the image flashed in his mind—Sebastian, bloodied yet unyielding, guarding Evelyn's secret with his life.

That man had truly protected his sister at all costs.

"Sebastian Valdemar?!"

Isabella's voice sharpened, her nails digging into her palms.

She hastily lowered her head, but not before Julian caught the flicker of venom in her eyes.

"Isabella." His tone darkened. "Spreading baseless rumors can ruin a woman's reputation."

Isabella bit her lip hard, suppressing the jealousy churning within her.

"You're right, brother... I was just worried about Evelyn..."

The tension in the room gradually eased.

Julian let the matter drop, his thoughts drifting to the brilliant, courageous young woman in that villa.

Calm under pressure. Unshakably loyal.

Such an exceptional girl—his long-lost sister!

Yet the danger posed by the Divine Elixir made his frown return.

"If this was all a misunderstanding," Edward stood, his expression relaxed, "let's fetch her at once."

Sophia nodded vigorously. "You brat! Did you frighten Evelyn? And confiscate her phone?"

Julian rubbed his nose, sheepish.

"Mother, I didn't bully her."

He turned to order his adjutant to prepare the car. "Would you prefer to retrieve her yourselves?"

Half an hour later, outside Sebastian's villa.

At Julian's command, the armed soldiers withdrew swiftly.

Evelyn descended the stairs slowly, taking in the sight of her parents and brother standing together—and understood everything.
###Chapter 246

"Evelyn, this is your second brother." Sophia Roland gently took her daughter's hand. "He just returned from abroad and hasn't met you yet."

Evelyn Roland lifted her gaze to the tall, imposing man studying her with an unreadable expression. His features bore traces of their parents' resemblance.

"So you're my second brother." She gave a slight nod.

Julian Roland's Adam's apple bobbed as he spoke in a low voice. "My apologies for the intrusion." He motioned for his armed unit to withdraw. "I can leave some men to watch over Sebastian if needed."

"Thank you, Julian." Evelyn's eyes swept over the soldiers' tactical gear. "But have them change into civilian clothes."

Understanding immediately, Julian issued swift orders. A flicker of admiration crossed his face at his sister's composure.

Before leaving, Evelyn glanced back at the sleeping Sebastian. Her fingers absently traced a faint, healed scar on her wrist.

As night deepened, a shadow slipped undetected into the villa. Silas Eisner moved like a fox, effortlessly diverting the guards.

He stood over Sebastian's bed, cold eyes scanning every corner of the room. His gaze finally settled on an almost imperceptible dark stain on the pillow.

"Found it." Silas's lips twisted into a grotesque smile.

With surgical precision, he clipped the fabric sample and fabricated replacement evidence. His movements were practiced, as if rehearsed countless times.

In the lab, the centrifuge hummed. Silas stared at the fluctuating data on the screen, his breathing growing ragged.

"Just as I thought..." He fixated on Evelyn's DNA profile, madness igniting in his eyes. "The secret of the Divine Elixir."

Lightning split the sky outside. The sterile lights cast eerie shadows across Silas's contorted face. With trembling fingers, he dialed an encrypted number.

"Prepare the operating theater," he hissed into the phone. "We're about to obtain... the perfect specimen."

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat at home reviewing medical texts when a sudden unease gripped her. She looked up, sensing something terrible unfolding in the night.
###Chapter 247

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting golden pools across the living room. The Roland mansion was so quiet the ticking of the clock echoed distinctly.

Neither Isabella Langley nor Alexander Roland were home.

Evelyn Roland sat sandwiched between her parents on the sofa, facing Julian Roland's stern expression across the coffee table.

Sophia Roland gripped her daughter's hand tightly. "Evelyn, what's really going on between you and Sebastian Valdemar?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

"We..."

Her words caught in her throat.

Edward Roland slammed his palm on the table. "Did that bastard hurt you?"

"Dad!" Evelyn quickly grabbed her father's wrist. "It's not what you think."

She took a deep breath. "My work involves sensitive matters. I ran into some trouble. Sebastian merely offered temporary shelter. We're not even roommates."

Sophia's eyes welled up. "What kind of job forces you to live in another man's house?"

"Mom..." Evelyn's voice softened. "I didn't want to drag our family into this."

Julian spoke abruptly. "I'm here."

Three simple words that warmed Evelyn's heart.

The man who'd seemed like an adversary yesterday now stood as her staunchest ally.

"Julian," she met his gaze directly, "will you tell me the truth now?"

Soon, only the siblings remained in the living room.

Julian's knuckles turned white. "My comrade... doesn't have much time left."

His voice cracked. "The doctors say only the Divine Elixir can save him."

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

So it was to save a life.

"Julian," she asked quietly, "what if I refuse?"

Julian shot to his feet. "Then I'll leave immediately."

His military coat swirled sharply as he turned. "I won't force you."

"Wait."

Evelyn stopped him.

She walked to the window where sunlight danced on her lashes. "The Divine Elixir exists to heal people."

Julian stiffened.

"But on one condition." Evelyn turned, her eyes glinting. "I deliver it personally."

"No!" Julian's refusal was absolute.

Evelyn smiled. "Julian, we're family."

The hardened soldier's eyes reddened at those words.
###Chapter 248

Sebastian Valdemar's eyes snapped open.

The familiar ceiling of his bedroom came into view.

"Evelyn Roland?!"

He sprang up from the bed like a coiled spring. The last scene before he lost consciousness flashed through his mind—a special forces soldier pressing a gun to Evelyn's temple.

Sebastian took the stairs two at a time, tearing through the villa from top to bottom.

In the living room, several soldiers in camouflage stood at attention with rifles.

They circled Sebastian, their dark eyes scrutinizing him.

"Vitals normal."

"Mental state stable."

"Motor functions adequate."

"Stand down."

As the soldiers filed out, Sebastian grabbed the last one by the arm.

"Where's Evelyn?"

"Miss Roland has returned safely to the Roland estate."

Only then did Sebastian's racing heart slow slightly.

Thirty minutes later, outside the Roland mansion.

Armed special forces surrounded the building like an impenetrable wall.

"I need to see Evelyn."

"Apologies. Miss Roland is not receiving visitors."

Sebastian's gaze darkened.

"Did she say that herself?"

The soldiers remained stone-faced.

Sebastian's knuckles turned white.

If the special forces were protecting the Rolands, it could only mean Evelyn herself refused to see him.

Was it because he failed to protect her?

Night fell like spilled ink, but the VIP lounge of Le Bar du Ritz blazed with light.

Sebastian sat alone on a leather sofa, a crystal glass dangling from his long fingers.

Women in skimpy outfits swayed their hips nearby, casting lingering glances his way.

"Another bottle."

A woman near the door stepped out just as Joanna Garten passed by.

Through the crack, Joanna's eyes widened in shock—

Sebastian was surrounded by women in a nightclub?
###Chapter 249

Joanna rolled her eyes in disgust, pretending not to notice, but abruptly turned around at the corner.

She furtively pulled out her phone, aiming the camera at the scene inside the private room.

"Cheater. Let's see how you talk your way out of this one," she muttered under her breath, swiftly tapping the record button.

On the screen, a dozen scantily clad women swayed their hips around Sebastian, who kept downing glass after glass of liquor.

Without hesitation, Joanna sent the video to Evelyn along with a scathing rant.

"Evelyn, look at this jerk! Faking a heart condition for sympathy during the day, then showing his true colors at night!"

Evelyn was reviewing documents from Silas in her room when her phone buzzed.

Her pupils constricted the moment she opened the video.

It wasn't the gyrating women that shocked her—it was the mountain of empty bottles piled before Sebastian.

"That lunatic!"
She shot to her feet, fingers tightening around her phone.

He'd had a cardiac episode just this morning, and now he was drowning himself in alcohol?

As Evelyn started typing a reply, Joanna's messages kept flooding in, each dripping with outrage.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn dialed Joanna directly. "Send me the address. I'm coming."

Ten minutes later, Evelyn stood outside Le Bar du Ritz.

Joanna rushed to meet her. "I'll take you up! That scumbag's probably wasted by now—when I peeked earlier, he'd already undone three shirt buttons!"

Evelyn's mouth twitched. "I'm here to save a life, not catch a cheating husband."

They hurried to the VIP room. Without preamble, Evelyn kicked the door open.

A wave of alcohol fumes made her grimace.

All eyes in the room turned toward the entrance.

"Out," Evelyn commanded, her glare sharp enough to kill.

The women exchanged glances before grabbing their purses to leave.

Someone whispered, "The wife's here. Let's bounce."

Ignoring the murmurs, Evelyn marched straight to Sebastian.

He was tilting his head back to drink, Adam's apple bobbing with each swallow.

"Enough!" She snatched the bottle away.

Sebastian blinked drunkenly, his hazy vision conjuring Evelyn's face.

"Hallucination..." he slurred, reaching for another drink.

Evelyn had had enough. She flipped the entire table over.

The shattering glass echoed violently through the room.
###Chapter 250
The sound of shattering glass exploded in the private room as colorful liquor seeped into the carpet.

"Stop drinking. Your physical condition needs reevaluation."

Evelyn Roland snatched the glass from Sebastian Valdemar's hand and shot Joanna Garten a meaningful glance. "Get a suite ready."

Joanna pouted. "Weren't we supposed to teach this scumbag a lesson? Why are we taking care of him now?" She leaned closer to Evelyn's ear. "Don't tell me you actually have feelings for Sebastian—"

"Enough. Just go."

After Joanna left, Evelyn struggled to lift the unconscious Sebastian. The crystal chandelier in the suite cast their elongated shadows across the floor.

She had just settled him onto the bed when her phone buzzed urgently.

"Where are you? Something's wrong."

Silas Eisner's voice carried an unusual tension.

Within twenty minutes of Evelyn giving the address, a sharp knock sounded at the door. Peering through the peephole to confirm it was Silas, she barely had time to open it before a cold blade pressed against her throat.

"Silas!"

The door slammed shut behind him. Silas slowly dragged the knife across his own reflection in the mirror, his lips twisting into a grotesque smile.

"Still can't figure it out?" His gaze slid past Evelyn to the unconscious Sebastian. "Don't worry. I'll let you two go together."

Evelyn's back hit the wall as her fingers stealthily inched toward the silver needles hidden at her waist.

"Who sent you?"

Silas's expression contorted violently. "Shut up!" The blade nicked her neck, drawing a thin line of blood. "Do you really think stalling will help?"

The room filled with nothing but heavy breathing. Evelyn's pulse spiked when she noticed Sebastian's fingers twitch in her peripheral vision.

"You know what?" Silas suddenly leaned in, pressing the icy blade against her cheek. "Watching prey struggle is the most entertaining part."

At that moment, Sebastian's eyes snapped open on the bed.
###Chapter 251

The dagger in Silas Eisner's hand gleamed coldly.

"Your blood is the divine elixir. I will have it."

Evelyn Roland's pupils constricted.

The black-clad figures lurking in the shadows were his accomplices all along.

When a direct assault failed, they resorted to deception. Burdened with recent affairs, she had let her guard down.

She stepped in front of Sebastian Valdemar in a flash.

"You want my life?"

The killing intent in Silas's eyes intensified. He had no patience for words—only blood and death. Evelyn would be taken by force.

Boom—

A deafening impact erupted.

Before Evelyn could react, Silas was sent flying like a ragdoll, crashing into the wall with a sickening spray of blood.

Alexander Roland whistled appreciatively as he followed Julian Roland, admiring his brother's flawless roundhouse kick.

The once-menacing man now paled, scrambling toward Evelyn in three frantic strides.

"Are you hurt?" Alexander urgently checked her for injuries.

"I'm fine." Rubbing her numb elbow, Evelyn frowned at Julian. "How did you—"

"Not now." Alexander's expression darkened. "This place isn't safe. We need to leave immediately."

Julian issued a crisp order. "Alexander, help me escort this man to the police station."

Meanwhile, Sebastian remained slumped in drunken oblivion.

Evelyn strained to haul him upright. His bleary eyes barely focused on her.

"How much did you drink?" She gritted her teeth. "You almost got yourself killed!"

Though barely conscious, Sebastian managed a shaky descent down the stairs with her support.

A Roland family car idled outside the bar, ready for departure.

At the same moment, Olivia Valdemar answered Theodore Ashcroft's call.

"Mr. Valdemar is recuperating at the Roland estate."

"What?" Olivia's spine stiffened.

After hearing the details, she exhaled in relief. "Thank goodness he's safe. I'll visit in person to express my gratitude."

Outside Blenheim Palace—

Sebastian had sobered up completely, just as the Roland brothers returned from the police station.

"What's the situation?" Evelyn pressed.

"He's awake, but..." Julian's gaze flicked to Sebastian, his expression instantly turning stormy.

Why was he here?

Alexander promptly pulled Evelyn aside. "We'll talk inside."
###Chapter 252

Julian and Alexander exchanged glances before flanking Evelyn on either side, steering her toward the house while leaving Sebastian standing alone at the doorstep.

"Wait—" Evelyn twisted to look back, throwing Sebastian a meaningful glance.

She was worried his injuries still needed follow-up care.

The moment they entered the living room, Sophia emerged from the kitchen with a fruit platter, settling beside her daughter.

"I heard about that Silas today—"

"Mom!" Evelyn cut her off, shaking Sophia's arm playfully. "I'm perfectly fine, thanks to my brothers arriving just in time."

She stood and twirled, her skirt flaring.

Sophia finally relaxed—until her gaze landed on Sebastian lingering awkwardly in the corner. Her expression hardened.

"Mr. Valdemar, help yourself to some fruit." She set the platter on the coffee table with icy politeness.

Just as Sebastian moved to thank her, Alexander snatched the tray away.

"Mom, I haven't had any yet." He deliberately placed it at the farthest end from Sebastian, shooting him a challenging look.

Sebastian's lips quirked slightly, unfazed by the childish antics.

Amid the lively chatter, Evelyn suddenly remembered something. Swallowing a bite of apple, she asked, "Julian, what about your friend—"

"Going now?" Julian's eyes lit up as he sprang to his feet. "I'll take you to the base."

Sophia caught her daughter's wrist anxiously. "So soon?"

"I'll be with her." Julian thumped his chest with a reassuring grin.

Before leaving, Evelyn made a point to approach Sebastian. "Your injuries still need rest. Contact me if anything comes up."

Sebastian nodded, watching her depart.

At the military base, clusters of soldiers huddled together.

"That's Colonel Roland's sister? Looks like an angel..."

"Shh! Keep it down!"

Julian's sharp glare scattered the gossiping troops like startled birds.

In the shadows, Wendy clenched her fists. As the base's head physician, why was some outsider being brought in to treat patients?

"Here we are." Julian stopped outside the innermost ward, hesitating. "I'll... wait out here."

He knew his sister's healing methods were unconventional.
###Chapter 253

Evelyn handed the neatly organized medications to Julian Roland. Her fingertip lightly tapped the medicine box.

"Give these to the base doctor." Her voice was cool and detached. "I've labeled the dosage and instructions."

Before Julian could respond, a sharp female voice cut in.

"Why not tell me directly?"

A woman in a white lab coat stepped out from around the corridor corner. The name tag on her chest read "Wendy Macmillan."

She deliberately straightened her posture, emphasizing the words "exclusive physician" with biting clarity.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

The hostility radiating from the woman was baffling.

"Dr. Macmillan?" Julian frowned. "Is there a problem?"

"I heard the Colonel brought back a miracle healer." Wendy's gaze burned into Evelyn. "I came to... learn from her."

Her red lips curled into an arc of provocation. "Unless Miss Roland is afraid?"

Evelyn let out a soft laugh.

Perfect timing—she'd been itching for some action lately.

"What's the challenge?"

Wendy was prepared. She led the group into an examination room littered with hundreds of dried herbs.

"Whoever identifies the most within thirty minutes wins."

Evelyn glanced at the scattered brownish herbs.

A traditional medicine test?

Interesting.

"You can still back out now," Wendy said smugly.

"Start the timer." Evelyn crouched down, picking up a withered leaf between her fingers.

Thirty minutes later.

The examination room was dead silent.

Evelyn dusted the herbal residue off her hands and stood gracefully. Not only had she named every single herb, but she'd also detailed their origins and processing methods.

Wendy's face turned ashen.

"You—"

"Medicine is about compassion." Evelyn cut her off. "Not a tool for petty competition."

She turned and walked out, the hem of her lab coat slicing through the air with sharp finality.

Julian stood frozen at the doorway, utterly speechless.

Three days later.

Sebastian's wound had scabbed over. Evelyn removed the last bandage, revealing fresh pink skin beneath.

"You're cleared to leave."

"About Silas—"

Before Sebastian could finish, rapid footsteps echoed from downstairs.

Olivia Valdemar burst into the room, her pregnant belly preceding her. The sharp click of her heels rang against the marble floor.
###Chapter 254

Olivia Valdemar pushed open the Roland family's parlor doors without waiting for the butler's announcement.

"Pardon the intrusion—"

Her words died in her throat.

Her gaze locked onto Evelyn Roland, who was carefully dressing Sebastian Valdemar's wound. Olivia's pupils constricted sharply.

"Evelyn? Why are you—"

The sight stole her breath.

Evelyn wore casual loungewear, her movements practiced and precise as she tended to the injury. This was no temporary medical consultant—this was the demeanor of a woman completely at home.

The air turned to ice.

Sebastian and Evelyn exchanged a glance, mutual resignation passing between them.

"She's the eldest daughter of the Roland family." Sebastian rose to acknowledge Edward and Sophia Roland. "I'm indebted to your hospitality."

"You knew?" Olivia's eyes widened, accusation lacing her tone.

She turned to Evelyn, her expression abruptly brightening.

"No wonder you share the Roland name! I should have realized sooner!"

The weight lifted from her shoulders.

All her worries about the family elders disapproving of Evelyn's background vanished. This was a perfect match—equal in status, destined by fate.

Olivia produced a gilded invitation from her clutch.

"Next Wednesday is Theodore's birthday gala. I came personally to invite you all." Her gaze lingered on Evelyn. "You must attend."

Relief washed over her when Evelyn nodded.

She'd considered excluding Isabella Langley, but Julian Roland had saved Sebastian's life. Courtesy demanded this concession.

The Rolands murmured polite acceptances.

"Time to go," Olivia urged.

But Sebastian's attention remained fixed on Evelyn.

"We have unfinished business," they said in unison.

——

In the visitation room of the detention center, Silas Eisner sat shackled across the table.

Days in custody had hollowed his cheeks and streaked his eyes with crimson. The polished charm had eroded, leaving only naked hatred.

Evelyn adjusted her cuff with deliberate slowness.

"Why?"

The single word made Silas blink.

He burst into laughter, chains clanking.

"Don't play dumb." His sneer flickered toward Sebastian at the door. "Who wouldn't want the Divine Elixir?"

"I know."

Evelyn's fingertips tapped the table.

This had been an elaborate trap from the moment the job posting went live. Silas's meticulous courtship—all to obtain the legendary substance.
###Chapter 255

Evelyn's fingertips turned cold.

She stared at Silas's contorted face, suddenly finding him utterly unrecognizable. The hidden forces at play were far more extensive than she'd imagined. The men in black and Silas were merely the tip of the iceberg.

How many pairs of greedy eyes lurked beneath the glow of the Divine Elixir?

"Why?"

Her voice was soft, yet it sliced through the silence like a blade. Silas's gaze shifted away from Sebastian, his lips twisting into a grotesque smirk.

"Orders?" He scoffed. "Still so naive, Miss Roland."

Sebastian remained in the shadows, his long fingers toying with a silver lighter. The flickering flame cast sharp angles across his face. He didn't even glance at Silas's provocation.

The indifference enraged Silas.

"Sebastian Valdemar!" He yanked against his chains, blood welling around his wrists. "Stop pretending you're innocent!"

Evelyn's pulse jumped. She'd never seen Silas like this—a wounded beast, his eyes burning with visceral hatred.

"Do we know each other?" Sebastian finally spoke, genuine confusion lacing his tone.

Silas burst into laughter, the sound grating and hollow.

"Karma..." He glared at Sebastian. "Just wait and see."

Instinctively, Evelyn stepped closer to Sebastian. The faint scent of cedarwood from him inexplicably calmed her.

"Explain." She pressed a hand to Silas's trembling shoulder. "What's really going on?"

His pupils contracted violently. His lips moved soundlessly before twisting into another cold sneer.

The air in the room thickened. Evelyn noticed something unsettling—when Silas looked at Sebastian, beneath the hatred, there was... fear?

The realization sent a chill down her spine.

"Someone's using you," she said gently. "Don't be their pawn."

For a fleeting moment, Silas's expression wavered. Then the darkness returned. He turned his face away, refusing to speak.

Sebastian snapped his lighter shut. The metallic click echoed sharply in the silence.

"Investigate."

A single word, yet it made Evelyn's heart pound.

What storms lay hidden behind that command?
###Chapter 256

A mocking smirk curled at Silas Eisner's lips before he shut his eyes with finality, his body language screaming refusal to engage further.

"Visiting hours are over." A guard peered in, his tone clipped. "You'll have to come back another time."

Evelyn Roland opened her mouth to protest, but the man cut her off with an impatient wave.

Her gaze lingered on Silas's motionless form. With a quiet sigh, she gathered her handbag. Before leaving, she leaned close to his ear. "Don't let them turn you into their pawn."

She missed the way his eyes snapped open the moment she turned away.

Only when the footsteps faded did Silas slowly unclench his fists. As he started to rise, a familiar shadow caught his peripheral vision.

A black mask materialized soundlessly at the visitation window, blotting out the light.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he sank back into the metal chair.

The masked figure produced a white porcelain vial from their robes, placing it gently on the table.

"You performed well." The voice grated like sandpaper. "Pity this was always your fate."

The robes swirled, and the visitor vanished as silently as they'd come.

Silas stared at the vial for a long moment before bursting into laughter. He snatched it up and downed the contents in one go.

By the time the porcelain shattered on the floor, scarlet already trailed from the corner of his mouth.

——

Sunlight stabbed at Evelyn's eyes as she stepped outside the prison gates.

She inhaled deeply, trying to shake the chill clinging to her bones.

"Are you certain you don't know Silas?" She turned to Sebastian Valdemar.

The man's brow furrowed. "I have rivals, but none who'd take things so personally..."

He trailed off. The Valdemar Group had made countless enemies, yet Silas's hatred seemed laser-focused on him alone.

"This runs deeper than it appears." Sebastian's eyes darkened. "On the surface, he came for you. But the real target was always me."

In the distance, tree shadows shuddered—a fleeting darkness darting between them.
###Chapter 257

The server suddenly flashed a series of red alerts.

SSL encryption connection timed out.

File read failure.

API interface call exception.

Cache data failed to load.

Foreach loop parameter error.

System logs flooded with error messages.

The database connection pool began fluctuating violently.

Every metric on the monitoring dashboard spiked red.

The entire backend system descended into chaos.

The tech lead bolted up from his seat.

"Initiate emergency protocols now!"

The ops team's fingers flew across their keyboards.

The firewall automatically blocked suspicious requests.

Security protocols forced an upgrade.

Backup server clusters came online urgently.

Data backup mechanisms triggered automatically.

"Any leads on the cause?"

"Someone's brute-forcing our API keys!"

The intrusion detection system blared a shrill alarm.

IP tracking launched immediately.

"Lock onto the attack source!"

"It's an overseas IP!"

The security team shifted into full combat readiness.

Counter-tracking programs initiated reverse scans.

The honeypot system activated silently.

"Got you."

The tech lead's eyes locked onto the blinking dot on-screen.

"Deploy countermeasures."

A torrent of data surged back, drowning the attacker.

Their servers began collapsing.

The final log entry read:

Connection terminated.
###Chapter 258

Evelyn Roland suddenly smacked her forehead.

She had completely forgotten today was Theodore Valdemar's birthday gala. The Valdemar family always made a grand celebration of this occasion every year.

At least she'd prepared the gift in advance.

"Mom, I'll be right there!" Evelyn called out, scrambling out of bed.

She rushed through her morning routine and applied light makeup. Just as she selected an elegant pastel gown, the living room's dazzling display nearly blinded her.

"Alexander, are you hosting a jewelry exhibition?" Evelyn gaped.

Alexander Roland gestured proudly at the glittering collection on the sofa. "I designed these pieces especially for you."

Sophia Roland chuckled behind her hand. "My own son never creates jewelry for his mother."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest, making her eyes prickle.

"Come try these gowns," Sophia urged, leading her to a rack of exclusive haute couture dresses, each worth a fortune.

"We can't let the Roland name down at the Valdemar event," Sophia said with a smile.

Evelyn's throat tightened under her family's affectionate gazes.

After hours of meticulous preparation, she chose a gown designed by Adrienne Klein—a simple off-shoulder silhouette with delicate lace accents that accentuated her ethereal grace.

Paired with Alexander's jewelry, she radiated elegance.

"My daughter is breathtaking," Sophia approved.

Evelyn eyed her reflection wryly. "This is hardly 'casual dressing'..."

"Time to depart." A deep, melodic voice sounded from the doorway.

Julian Roland entered, his gaze lingering on his sister with undisguised admiration. "All set?"

Alexander slung an arm around his brother's shoulders. "Julian brought the limited-edition Maybach. We're making an entrance today."

Julian simply smiled as the brothers headed out.

Footsteps suddenly echoed on the staircase. Isabella Langley descended leisurely, flashing Evelyn a saccharine smile from behind their parents.
###Chapter 259

Isabella Langley clung affectionately to Sophia Roland's arm, her gaze sweeping over Evelyn Roland before curling into a saccharine smile. "Mother has such impeccable taste. That gown by Adrienne Klein makes you absolutely radiant, sister."

She deliberately emphasized "Adrienne Klein," her eyes glinting with malice.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, meeting Isabella's stare with cool indifference.

"Thank you." She turned to Sophia and Edward Roland, her lips curving into a practiced smile. "Father, Mother, we should leave now."

The sharp click of her black stilettos echoed across the marble floor as she strode toward the exit without a backward glance.

Isabella's nails dug into her palms as she watched that slender figure retreat.

She had begged Adrienne for that dress for three months—only for Evelyn to waltz in wearing it. And that diamond bracelet on Evelyn's wrist? A limited-edition piece personally designed by Alexander Roland.

Why?

Why did this interloper get everything Isabella had ever wanted?

"Isabella?" Sophia gasped. "Your hand—"

Isabella snapped back to reality, realizing she'd left red marks on Sophia's arm.

"Forgive me, Mother!" She released her grip instantly, her expression morphing into one of pitiful distress. "I... I'm just nervous."

Sophia patted her hand sympathetically. "You don't have to attend if you're unwell."

"No, I want to go." Isabella's smile returned, sweet as poisoned honey, her eyes glinting with something darker.

She wouldn't miss tonight's spectacle for the world.

The Valdemar gala was held at the city's most opulent hotel.

Crystal chandeliers bathed the ballroom in blinding light, while towers of champagne flutes refracted dazzling prisms across the room. The elite mingled, their polite laughter masking the undercurrents of rivalry and ambition.

Isabella's gaze cut through the crowd, zeroing in on Evelyn standing alone in a corner.

Her crimson lips curved. Plucking two champagne flutes from a passing waiter's tray, she glided toward her target.
###Chapter 260

The crystal chandelier in the banquet hall flickered abruptly.

The elite business crowd fell silent mid-conversation, their gazes drawn to the entrance. A champagne flute tilted in someone's hand, nearly spilling its contents.

"Is that..."

"My God, twelve limited-edition Rolls-Royces!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd. A middle-aged man in gold-rimmed glasses squinted, then grabbed his companion's arm excitedly. "Look! The Roland family crest!"

In a corner, several suited men exchanged knowing glances.

"The Rolands never make a spectacle. Why today...?"

"I heard," a slick-haired man murmured, "they've recovered their long-lost biological daughter."

Before he finished speaking, the fleet of cars parked in perfect unison.

As the doors opened, the banquet hall plunged into stunned silence. Every eye locked onto the figure emerging from the extended Phantom.

Evelyn Roland stepped out in a champagne haute couture gown, her diamond necklace scattering light like shattered stars. She lifted her gaze slightly, the teardrop mole at her eye corner accentuating her porcelain skin.

A sharp inhale cut through the quiet.

Olivia Valdemar rushed forward, nearly tripping over her own hem. "Evelyn! You've stolen every word from my tongue tonight!"

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile, her earlobes tinged pink.

Edward Roland approached with his two sons, immediately surrounded by fawning business associates.

"Mr. Roland, you haven't aged a day!"

"Your sons are exceptional young men!"

Amid the pleasantries, Edward turned and extended a hand. "Come."

The chairman of Li Corporation feigned surprise. "And this young lady is...?"

"Allow me," Edward announced, voice ringing clear. "This is my treasured daughter, Evelyn Roland."

The air turned to ice.

Evelyn executed a flawless curtsy, her lashes casting delicate shadows. Muffled gasps and camera shutters erupted around her.

"So the rumors were true..."

"No wonder the Rolands made such an entrance..."

Whispers spread like wildfire through the crowd. Evelyn lowered her eyes, fingers absently tracing the pearl clasp of her clutch.

This storm had only just begun.
###Chapter 261

"Just as expected. The Rolands made such a grand spectacle today to announce this."

"No wonder... Wait, if Evelyn is the real heiress, then Isabella's status becomes rather questionable."

"Could this be some switched-at-birth scenario? Is Isabella not even a Roland by blood?"

The first man who spoke nodded emphatically.

"Pretty much."

Rising on his toes, he peered over the sea of guests until he spotted Isabella clinging to Sophia Roland's arm. He scoffed. "That impostor still dares to cling to Mrs. Roland, acting more affectionate than the real daughter."

"After learning the truth, she didn't even bother searching for her biological parents. Just shamelessly stayed with the Rolands—clearly after their wealth and influence."

Someone nearby added with a knowing smirk, "Her motives are transparent to anyone with eyes."

Whispers rippled through the crowd, mostly marveling at Evelyn's beauty, occasionally laced with scornful remarks about Isabella.

Isabella bit her lower lip until it nearly bled, nails digging crescent moons into her palms. Forcing a smile, she turned to Sophia. "Mother, you go ahead. I need to freshen up."

Sophia waved dismissively. "Don't take too long."

The rapid click of heels against marble echoed as Isabella fled. Bursting into the restroom, she locked the door and collapsed against the sink, shoulders shaking violently.

Her reflection showed smeared makeup, tears carving tracks through her foundation. With a sudden snarl, she wiped her face and slammed a fist into the mirror.

"Bitches! Every last one of them!"

No one cared about her feelings. The entire room orbited around that suddenly-appeared true heiress. Why?

Cosmetics and perfume bottles crashed to the floor, glass shards scattering like fallen stars. Only when the restroom resembled a warzone did Isabella stop, chest heaving.

Staring at her disheveled reflection, she let out a hysterical laugh. "The Rolands owe me. And I'll make them pay a hundredfold!"

Back in the ballroom, Edward Roland guided Evelyn through introductions with key guests. After the rounds of pleasantries, Olivia Valdemar smoothly approached.

"Uncle, Auntie, you must be exhausted from your travels. Why not retire to the inner lounge?" She linked arms with Evelyn. "I'd love to catch up with Evelyn. My brother's been a changed man since their last encounter—quite the transformation."

Olivia gave a meaningful wink. "They say men only change for the women they love. Sebastian's feelings couldn't be clearer. If Evelyn reciprocates, they'd be a match made in heaven."

Before Evelyn could respond, Alexander Roland bristled.

"Match made in heaven? My sister would never settle for him!"

He didn't care whose daughter Olivia was. Anyone daring to pair Evelyn with Sebastian Valdemar triggered his protective instincts, demanding an immediate rebuttal.
###Chapter 262

"Indeed." Julian Roland picked up Alexander's thread, giving Olivia Valdemar a slight nod. "Miss Valdemar, it's best we don't bring this up again. Evelyn and Sebastian simply aren't suited for each other."

Evelyn tugged at Olivia's sleeve when her brothers overreacted to Sebastian's name.

She shook the exquisitely wrapped gift box in her hand.

"Theodore is today's star." Evelyn glanced around. "I brought him a present. Where is the little one?"

"Upstairs." Olivia's expression turned apologetic. "He refuses to come down no matter how much we coax him."

Understanding flashed in Evelyn's eyes. She turned to her parents and brothers. "I'll go check on Theodore first."

Following Olivia upstairs, the noise of the party faded behind them.

Evelyn's tense shoulders finally relaxed. Today marked Edward Roland's official acknowledgment of her identity as his daughter. She had to maintain the perfect heiress facade at all times.

Every step felt like walking on thin ice. Now, she could finally breathe.

"Theodore is shy around strangers. Sebastian's keeping him company." Olivia paused at the bedroom door, her eyes dimming slightly at the mention of her eldest son. "I should return to our guests. You may go in."

Watching Olivia descend the stairs, Evelyn gave a soft knock.

Sebastian looked momentarily startled when he opened the door, then stepped aside to let her enter.

A porcelain-skinned boy sat on the carpet, his long lashes framing expressive eyes.

Theodore focused intently on stacking blocks, only glancing up briefly when Evelyn entered before resuming his play.

"Theodore, this is a gift from Aunt Evelyn." She crouched down, her voice instinctively softening.

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting dappled patterns across the boy's face. His golden curls shimmered, his delicate features mirroring Olivia's.

The child was breathtakingly beautiful.

Theodore paused, his dark eyes studying her with curiosity.

After a moment's hesitation, his small hand reached tentatively toward the present.

Sebastian settled beside Theodore, an uncharacteristic gentleness in his expression. "He likes you." His fingers brushed the boy's hair. "He never accepts gifts from strangers."

Watching Theodore unwrap the building block set, Sebastian's lips curved slightly. "He's accepted your gift."

The new blocks quickly captured Theodore's full attention as he began assembling them with single-minded focus.
###Chapter 263

Evelyn Roland frowned slightly. "Why is this child..."

At his age, most children would be curious about new things. Why would he refuse a gift from a stranger?

She crouched down, studying the porcelain-faced little boy carefully.

Then she noticed something odd—the child hadn’t spoken a single word since she entered the room.

A terrible suspicion flashed through her mind.

Could it be...?

Evelyn jerked her head up to look at Sebastian Valdemar, her eyes wide with shock.

The man seemed to read her thoughts, his lips quirking slightly. "Not what you're thinking."

Relief washed over her, and Evelyn awkwardly rubbed the tip of her nose.

But how did Sebastian always know what she was thinking? Did he really have some kind of mind-reading ability?

"Theodore has severe autism," Sebastian's voice dropped lower. "My sister took him to every top specialist, both here and abroad. Nothing worked."

"He doesn’t speak or interact with people. Building blocks are the only thing he’s ever shown interest in."

Evelyn’s heart clenched. Her gaze drifted back to the little boy, now completely absorbed in his blocks.

Such a beautiful child... How could...?

After a moment’s hesitation, she couldn’t help but ask, "Theodore’s father... isn’t he here today?"

Sebastian’s eyes turned icy, his voice laced with undisguised contempt. "He claimed to be busy with work."

"Work?" Evelyn arched a skeptical brow.

Even a business titan like Sebastian could make time. How could his own father use work as an excuse?

She was about to press further when she felt a gentle tug on her sleeve.

Theodore had looked up, his large, dark eyes fixed on her. He scooted over slightly, making space beside him.

Evelyn’s face lit up with delight. She quickly sat down and joined him in building. Sebastian watched from the side, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.

As the party was about to start, Evelyn stood—only for Theodore to immediately rise with her, his small hand clutching her sleeve tightly.

"Would you like to go downstairs with me to find your mom?" she asked softly.

The little boy’s eyes sparkled. He nodded emphatically.

When the three of them appeared at the top of the stairs, Olivia Valdemar nearly dropped her champagne glass.

"Theodore, he..." She stared at her brother in disbelief.

Sebastian smiled faintly—a rare sight. "He likes Ms. Roland."
###Chapter 264

Olivia Valdemar's eyes instantly welled up with tears. The soft touch of Theodore's little hand sent a warm current through her heart.

"Let me try treating Theodore's condition." Evelyn Roland's voice was gentle as flowing water. "It may take some time."

Olivia's throat tightened with emotion. Theodore's progress today felt like sunlight piercing through her gloomy world.

From the corner, Isabella Langley watched coldly, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She pulled out a pre-written note and stopped a passing waiter. "Please give this to the gentleman in the suit."

When Oliver Valrose unfolded the paper, his lips curled into an amused smirk. Adjusting his tie, he strode briskly toward the elevator.

Isabella's crimson lips twisted into a sneer.

At the same moment, Evelyn's phone vibrated abruptly.

"Room 203." A mechanical electronic voice spoke through the receiver.

Olivia inquired with concern, but Evelyn merely shook her head. Her gaze lingered thoughtfully toward the stairwell before excusing herself to the restroom.

Hiking up her skirt with practiced ease, her heels clicked sharply against the marble floor. Outside Room 203, Evelyn drew a steadying breath.

The turning doorknob echoed unnaturally loud in the empty hallway.

Inside, an eerie silence hung under the cold glow of a crystal chandelier. The moment Evelyn stepped forward, the scuff of leather shoes sounded behind her.

The door slammed shut with a resounding thud.

Oliver lunged like a starved wolf, his tie askew. "Evelyn, I knew you'd come."

Evelyn sidestepped with feline grace, her back pressing against the icy wall. Narrowing her eyes, she demanded, "Who sent you?"
###Chapter 265

"Miss Roland, why the prudish act with me?" Oliver Valrose sneered, his gaze roaming over her body with vulgar intent. "We're alone here. No need for pretenses."

He took a step closer, his voice dripping with sleaze.

Evelyn Roland clenched her fists, the air suddenly feeling thick with repulsion.

"Back off." Her eyes turned glacial. "Take one more step and I won't hold back."

"Oh, playing hard to get?" He licked his lips. "You're the one who invited me."

"If you enjoy dangerous games, I'll gladly oblige."

Seeing his determination to assault her, Evelyn gave a cold laugh.

It seemed this scoundrel needed a lesson he'd never forget.

She tossed her designer bag aside and flexed her wrists. The hem of her gown was already knotted neatly behind her, allowing full mobility.

The moment Oliver lunged, she drove her knee upward with brutal precision.

"Ah—!" The man crumpled, his face contorted in agony as he gasped on the floor.

"Exciting enough?" Evelyn tilted her head, danger flashing in her eyes. "Shall we escalate?"

"You bitch!"

Oliver staggered up, his expensive suit now wrinkled beyond recognition. Spittle flew as he hurled obscenities.

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. Kicking off her heels, she advanced and delivered two stinging slaps across his face.

"Still coherent? I must've gone easy on you."

Snatching her bag from the floor, she rained blows upon him. Oliver scrambled like a cornered rat, his curses dissolving into pitiful whimpers.

The commotion drew a crowd outside Room 203. When Olivia Valdemar arrived with the Roland brothers, the hallway was packed.

"Move!" Olivia shoved through the onlookers.

The door swung open to reveal Oliver, battered and bleeding, crawling toward escape—only to be slammed against the wall by Julian Roland's expert restraint.

"Help! This woman's insane!"

All eyes turned to Evelyn, now smoothing her skirt with perfect composure as she slipped back into her heels. Not a hair was out of place—only the faint redness of her knuckles betrayed the violence.

"Evelyn!" Alexander Roland and Olivia rushed forward.

"I'm fine." She gave Olivia's hand a reassuring squeeze and winked at her brother.
###Chapter 266

Oliver Valrose clutched his bleeding nose, crimson droplets seeping between his fingers. His swollen eyes were bloodshot, all traces of his usual aristocratic charm gone.

"You're the one who invited me here!" He glared venomously at Evelyn Roland. "Stop pretending to be some innocent saint!"

Julian Roland's expression darkened. Another brutal punch landed on Oliver's face. The sickening crunch of bone made the guests gasp.

"A note?" Evelyn caught the key detail, stopping her brother mid-swing. "What note?"

Grimacing, Oliver yanked a crumpled paper from his pocket and hurled it at her.

The note arced through the air. Evelyn caught it effortlessly, unfolding it with deliberate slowness.

A soft laugh escaped her lips as she held it up. "Look at this smudged ink." Her slender fingers traced the paper. "Only sweaty palms could blur writing like this."

She suddenly spread her pristine hands under the lights—spotless. "This special ink stains on contact. Yet my hands—"

Whispers erupted before she could finish.

Oliver's face turned ashen. "A server gave it to me!" He jabbed a finger toward the crowd's edge. "Her!"

A uniformed figure was edging toward the exit. Julian moved like lightning, hauling her back like a ragdoll.

Isabella Langley stood beside Alexander Roland, nails digging into her palms. Her venomous gaze locked onto the trembling server.

She'd warned this wretch in the restroom last time...

"Who put you up to this?" Evelyn's voice was glacial.

The server shook like a leaf, head bowed.

"Silence?" Evelyn stepped closer. "Who do you fear more—the Roland heiress, or the adopted daughter?"

The words struck like daggers. The server's head jerked up, her eyes flickering to Isabella's bloodless face. "I-It was Miss Isabella Langley!"

Gasps filled the room.

Isabella staggered back, toppling a champagne tower. Amid shattering glass, she shrieked, "You lying snake!"

"Sister..." She turned tearful eyes to Evelyn. "She's clearly been bribed—"

Evelyn smiled faintly, unfolding the note again. "Notice the signature—just 'Roland.'"

Her gaze settled meaningfully on Isabella. "If you and Oliver are truly in love, why hide it? Father and Mother adore you. They'd never oppose this match."

Isabella stood frozen, as if struck by lightning.
###Chapter 267

Evelyn Roland offered Isabella Langley a reassuring smile, ignoring her stunned silence. "Please excuse us," she said gently. "This was supposed to be Isabella's date with Oliver Valrose. I accidentally walked into the wrong room, causing this misunderstanding."

The onlookers at the door murmured in realization before dispersing.

"So it was Isabella and Mr. Valrose all along. No wonder the invitation only had 'Langley' written on it."

"The Valrose family may not be as prestigious as the Rolands, but Oliver is quite handsome. They make a decent match."

"Let's hope it works out for them."

Isabella's face paled at the whispers. Her ears rang.

Her? With Oliver Valrose?

That playboy?

But it was too late to protest. She couldn’t possibly admit she had set Evelyn up. Swallowing her bitterness, she remained silent.

Sebastian Valdemar lingered at the edge of the crowd, observing Isabella’s expression. He stepped aside to let others pass, his lips pressed into a thin line, amusement flickering in his eyes.

Once the crowd thinned, Olivia Valdemar finally exhaled in relief. Her pregnant belly ached from standing too long, and the commotion in Room 203 had nearly given her a fright.

Evelyn noticed her pallor and quickly helped her sit. "Olivia, are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Olivia squeezed her hand guiltily. "But you must be shaken. I should’ve double-checked the hotel arrangements."

"This is my fault," Evelyn said remorsefully. "I ruined your lovely party."

"Just a minor hiccup." Olivia tenderly rubbed her belly. "The baby’s been calm through it all."

A shadow fell over them.

A man in his early thirties approached, dressed in an impeccably tailored suit. Though unremarkable in looks, he carried an air of mature charm. Yet something about him unsettled Evelyn.

Olivia blinked in surprise before lighting up. "Honey? How did you—"

"Careful!" Evelyn stopped her from standing. "You shouldn’t exert yourself."

The man hurried forward, gently steadying his wife. "Easy. I’m right here."

Olivia settled back, her eyes soft with concern. "Weren’t you in a meeting? Did you rush back? You must be exhausted."

He clasped her hand, his gaze tender. "Seeing you makes it all worth it."
###Chapter 268

A derisive snort came from nearby.

Evelyn Roland turned toward the sound, catching only the retreating figure of Sebastian Valdemar as he walked away.

His tall frame paused at the end of the hallway. It was impossible to tell how long he had been standing there, observing.

Olivia Valdemar seemed unfazed, as if accustomed to such behavior. Suddenly remembering something, she turned to Evelyn with an apologetic smile. "Evelyn, I haven't introduced you yet. This is my husband, Howard Merouin—Theodore's father."

Howard gave a polite nod, his lips curving into a perfectly measured smile.

Evelyn returned the gesture with a faint smile of her own. But as she stepped closer, a delicate, elusive scent drifted toward her.

"Mr. Merouin, your cologne is quite distinctive," she remarked casually. "Is it 'Winter Spice' by Master Matsubara?"

For the briefest moment, Howard's pupils contracted almost imperceptibly.

"You must be mistaken," Olivia interjected with a light laugh. "Howard never wears cologne."

"Perhaps it's from the flight," Howard smoothly wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders. "Let's go see Theodore. I've missed him."

Evelyn watched them coolly, finally understanding the source of Sebastian's hostility.

"Evelyn should get to know Theodore better too," Olivia suggested.

When the three of them entered the child's room, the little boy was engrossed in a picture book.

"Sweetheart, look who's here?" Olivia called softly.

Howard enthusiastically spread his arms, but Theodore didn't even glance up before darting straight into Evelyn's embrace.

Howard's outstretched arms froze midair before he lowered them with a self-deprecating chuckle and sank onto the sofa. "I suppose I haven't spent enough time with him."

"Don't say that," Olivia immediately took her husband's hand. "Theodore has always been slow to warm up to people."

Touched, Howard pulled his wife into a hug. Evelyn observed the picture-perfect couple, a chill settling in her chest.

What kind of spell had this man cast over Olivia?
###Chapter 269

Evelyn's gaze shifted between Howard and Olivia. Their demeanor appeared natural, yet something felt off. She pressed her lips together subtly.

"Olivia, I'd like to evaluate Theodore alone."

Olivia stiffened, her fingers tightening around Howard's arm.

Howard's lips curled into a knowing smile. "Don't worry, darling. Since Ms. Roland is the expert, we should cooperate with the treatment." He patted Olivia's hand reassuringly. "Theodore will get better."

The way he said "darling" dripped with affection, yet it sent a chill down Evelyn's spine.

As the door clicked shut, Evelyn immediately locked it. Turning around, she found Theodore staring at her with timid eyes.

"Would you like to talk to me, Theodore?"

The little boy's lashes fluttered.

"Mommy..." His voice was barely a whisper. "Mommy holds me when I sleep."

Evelyn's heart softened. She crouched to his eye level. "Your mommy must love you very much."

"But..." Theodore suddenly gripped his shirt, his face turning pale. "Daddy hits me..."

The words stabbed through Evelyn like a knife. She pulled him into a tight embrace, feeling his small body tremble violently.

"Don't be afraid. I'm here." She stroked his back gently. "You're so brave."

The child clutched her collar, hot tears soaking her shoulder. The desperate grip twisted Evelyn's heart—it was the instinctive reaction of a traumatized child.

By the time Theodore fell asleep in her arms, Evelyn's nails had dug deep into her palms. She wiped his tear-stained cheeks, her eyes icy with fury.

Outside, Olivia paced anxiously.

"Evelyn!" She seized Evelyn's wrist. "How is Theodore...?"

Evelyn studied Olivia's red-rimmed eyes—then noticed the faint bruises on her wrist. The pieces clicked into a horrifying truth.

"Olivia," she said softly but firmly. "We need to talk."
###Chapter 270

Evelyn Roland had just stepped out of the children's room when Olivia Valdemar rushed forward eagerly. Behind her stood Howard Merouin in a crisp suit, both staring intently at Evelyn.

"How is he?" Olivia twisted her fingers nervously.

Evelyn shook her head slightly. "It's too early to tell." Her gaze lingered on Howard. "But a child's psychological issues often stem from their home environment. Olivia, may I speak with Mr. Merouin alone?"

Olivia visibly stiffened, instinctively looking at her husband.

Howard squeezed his wife's hand reassuringly. "Go rest. I'll join you after my talk with Ms. Roland." He pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Don't worry."

The moment Olivia left, the warmth in Howard's smile faded.

"What did you want to say, Ms. Roland?"

"Theodore is terrified of you." Evelyn cut straight to the point. "Not just shyness—actual fear."

Howard's eyes flickered. "I travel frequently. It's natural for children to be wary of strangers."

"No." Evelyn took a step closer. "He trembles at the mere mention of you. Mr. Merouin, why would a three-year-old be so afraid of his own father?"

The air turned glacial.

All pretense of politeness vanished from Howard's face. He adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate slowness, his voice icy. "Mind your words, Ms. Roland."

"I'm stating facts." Evelyn held her ground. "If Theodore's condition stems from you, it's my duty to investigate."

"Investigate?" Howard suddenly smiled, though his eyes remained frigid. "I suggest you know your limits. We'll find another specialist for Theodore. Your services are no longer required."

He gestured toward the door.

Evelyn smirked. "I was hired by Mrs. Valdemar. You have no authority to dismiss me." She picked up her bag, pausing to give Howard a meaningful look. "By the way, Theodore drew something quite... interesting earlier."

Howard's pupils constricted.

Evelyn strode toward the exit without looking back. She could feel his venomous gaze coiling around her like a serpent.

The moment the door clicked shut, a deafening crash echoed behind her—the sound of something heavy being hurled against the floor.
###Chapter 271: Walking Together in the Rain

Evelyn Roland strode out of the hotel elevator, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor. Her nails dug unconsciously into her palms. Howard Merouin's smarmy face lingered in her mind, every evasive word he'd spoken seeming to hide some dark secret.

Outside the revolving glass doors, rain fell in a fine, unrelenting mist. She checked her phone—her brothers should be long gone by now. Just as she braced herself to dash into the downpour, steady footsteps sounded behind her.

A black umbrella snapped open above her head.

Sebastian Valdemar appeared at her side without warning, tilting the umbrella slightly in her direction. Raindrops slid down the ribs of the umbrella, leaving dark stains on the shoulders of his impeccably tailored black trench coat. The sharp line of his jaw seemed even more pronounced in the dim light.

"I'm heading that way," he said tersely.

Rain streaked the car windows like winding rivers. The warmth inside the vehicle made her drowsy. Evelyn stared at the blurred neon lights outside before speaking abruptly, "Howard's afraid."

Soft music played in the background. Sebastian tapped his fingers twice against the steering wheel.

"Theodore has an episode every time he sees him," Evelyn continued, turning to face the road ahead. "This isn't just about an absent father."

The traffic light shifted from green to red. Sebastian pressed the brake. In the rhythmic sweep of the windshield wipers, his profile was gilded by the glow of streetlights. "What are you suggesting?"

"Domestic violence? Infidelity?" Her fingers absently traced the seatbelt. "Or something worse."

The sound of tires cutting through water suddenly turned harsh. Sebastian's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes darker than the night outside. The car's display screen lit up with a new notification.

"Nine tomorrow morning," he said abruptly. "Come to my office. I'll show you the files."

The rain had stopped by the time they reached her home. Evelyn stood at her front door, surprised to find the porch light on. When she turned, Sebastian's car was still idling at the curb, its taillights painting twin red streaks on the wet pavement.

"Sebastian?" she called out before she could stop herself.

The window rolled down. He rested one arm on the sill, his watch glinting coldly under the light. "Something else?"

The night wind carried the scent of osmanthus into the car. Evelyn shook her head, her hair lifting slightly in the breeze. "See you tomorrow."

Only after her slender figure disappeared behind the door did Sebastian start the engine again. His Bluetooth earpiece crackled to life with his assistant's voice. "Sir, we've uncovered Howard's spending records in Los Angeles from three years ago—"

The steering wheel jerked sharply. Tires screeched against asphalt. Sebastian's gaze remained fixed on the rearview mirror, where the Roland estate grew smaller in the distance. His voice was ice. "Keep digging. I want every move he's made in the last five years."
###Chapter 272

Sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains as Evelyn Roland stretched lazily. She had slept unusually well last night, not even a single dream disturbing her rest.

While washing up, she studied her reflection in the mirror. Her complexion looked much better than before, and the dark circles under her eyes had noticeably faded.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

"Hello?" She dried her hands and answered.

"The documents are ready," Sebastian Valdemar's voice came through the receiver. "I'll be there in thirty minutes."

After hanging up, Evelyn quickly changed into a light gray tracksuit. She tied her hair into a high ponytail, giving her a crisp, professional look.

The sound of a car engine rumbled in the driveway just as she finished applying sunscreen.

Sebastian was driving a black Range Rover today. Evelyn opened the passenger door and spotted a manila folder on the seat.

"Is this everything?" She fastened her seatbelt and picked up the folder.

"Everything we could find, from birth till now." Sebastian turned the steering wheel. "Focus on the last five years."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow at the thick stack of papers inside. When she reached the third page, she froze.

"Villa Tuscany..." She pointed at two identical addresses. "Domestic and international?"

Sebastian smirked coldly. "I checked it out personally yesterday. It's just a high-end club."

"A club?"

"Outwardly a private residence, but in reality..." He paused. "People are kept there."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn instantly. She flipped to the photos and saw two different women—one of Asian descent, the other blonde with blue eyes.

"One's a Chinese-American, the other's a foreigner." Sebastian's voice was icy. "The timeline matches right before Theodore was born."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. Howard Merouin was keeping mistresses both at home and abroad—how audacious.

"Does Olivia know?" she couldn't help asking.

Sebastian shook his head. "My sister trusts him too much."

Remembering how Olivia had defended Howard last night, Evelyn's heart sank. That kind of loyalty didn't seem fake—it was genuine trust.

"This alone won't be enough," she murmured.

Sebastian gave her an approving glance. "Exactly. My sister would think it's a setup."

As the car merged onto the main road, sunlight spilled through the window onto the documents. Evelyn suddenly noticed a detail.

"Wait..." She pointed at one page. "Howard makes regular monthly transfers to these two accounts."

Sebastian's eyes sharpened. "Did you check the recipients?"

"One is the villa's butler, the other..." She turned the page, and her pupils constricted. "A private hospital."

They exchanged a glance, both realizing the implication.

"Theodore's birth certificate..." Sebastian's voice dropped low. "Might be forged."
###Chapter 273

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly.

She stared at the thick stack of documents on the table, her chest heavy as if weighed down by a boulder. Olivia's ever-smiling eyes flashed in her mind, tightening her throat.

"Howard is nothing but a complete fraud."

Sebastian's voice was icy. His slender fingers traced the red-marked dates on the documents, each one horrifying.

"The day Theodore was born, he was popping champagne at a nightclub."

"When Theodore had his first fever and was hospitalized, he was gambling in Macau."

"On your anniversary, he booked an entire hotel floor... with three women."

Evelyn slammed the file shut. The crisp sound of paper echoed sharply in the silent living room.

The sound of a turning lock suddenly broke the silence.

"Oh, what a surprise! You're here?" Olivia walked in arm-in-arm with Howard, her cheeks still flushed. She wore a soft yellow dress that made her glow like spring itself.

Howard tenderly helped her remove her coat, his gaze dripping with affection.

Evelyn's stomach churned.

"Olivia." She took a deep breath and pushed the file forward. "Look at this."

Curious, Olivia flipped open the first page. Her smile froze. Howard glanced over her shoulder and paled instantly.

"Darling, this is a setup!" He dropped to his knees, his voice cracking with desperation. "I swear I’ve never done any of this!"

Sebastian let out a cold laugh, his eyes sharp as blades.

Olivia's fingers tightened slowly. The paper crumpled in her grip, emitting a strained rustle.

"Last year, on Theodore’s birthday..." Her voice was barely audible. "You said you were in New York for a meeting."

Beads of sweat formed on Howard’s forehead. "I was! These photos are photoshopped!"

"Then what about this?" Olivia suddenly pulled out a hotel receipt, her finger jabbing at a glaring number. "An 8888-dollar 'romance suite'—photoshopped too?"

The room plunged into dead silence.

Evelyn watched as Olivia’s eyes slowly reddened, but her spine remained rigid.

"Olivia—"

"Enough." Olivia stood abruptly, shredding the documents in her hands. The white fragments fluttered down like a ridiculous snowstorm.

Howard opened his mouth to protest but was silenced by her glare.

"Get out."

Her voice was soft, yet it plunged the room into icy cold. Evelyn had never seen Olivia like this—a drawn sword, terrifyingly sharp.

Howard scrambled to his feet, stumbling toward the door. Just before it closed, Evelyn caught the venomous glint in his eyes.

"Olivia..." Evelyn reached out, but Olivia gently pushed her away.

Bending down, Olivia picked up a torn piece of paper and suddenly laughed. "I’ve known for a while."

The words struck like thunder.

"Then why—"

"Because of Theodore." Olivia traced the date on the scrap, tears finally falling. "Every time he missed his father, Howard would magically appear."

She lifted her tear-streaked face, a bitter smile on her lips. "How ironic. Even being a good dad was just an act."
###Chapter 274

Sebastian's knuckles turned white as his fists clenched. His burning gaze locked onto his sister's forced composure.

"How long are you going to keep lying to yourself, Olivia?" His voice was low but razor-sharp.

"That scumbag Howard doesn't deserve your forgiveness. You know the truth—you're just refusing to face it. Wake up."

"Enough!" Olivia turned away sharply, her chest heaving. She couldn't bear her brother's disappointed stare. Her nails dug into her palms. "I don't believe these documents. Howard, get up."

A flicker of triumph crossed Howard's face as he started to rise—until a small figure barreled into him, knocking him flat.

Theodore planted himself protectively in front of his mother, tiny fists balled. His eyes burned red with fury. "Get out! Don't touch Mommy!"

The air turned to ice. Howard sat sprawled on the floor, his expression darkening before twisting into a sickening smile. "Come here, Theo—"

"No!" The child whirled and buried his face in Olivia's skirt. His small hands patted her back in clumsy imitation of her own comforting gestures. "Mommy don't cry. Bad man said he'll get new mommy... new mommy hits Theo..."

Olivia went deathly pale. She knelt slowly, her voice barely audible. "Who... who hurt you, baby?"

Fat tears rolled down Theodore's cheeks as he pointed a trembling finger. "He took me to see mean lady... She pinched me... slapped me..." His little body shook violently. "Said... said if I tell, he'll make Mommy poor..."

The world spun. Olivia's heart shattered like glass. Her fingers trembled as she wiped her son's tears. "Why didn't you tell me—"

"Lies!" Howard lunged to his feet, face contorted with rage. "You little brat—"

Olivia swung her handbag with all her strength. The blow cracked across his face.

"You monster!" Her scream tore through the room. The bag burst open, scattering its contents. A lipstick rolled to Howard's feet like a drop of blood.

Silence. Evelyn gasped behind her hands. Sebastian's rigid jaw finally relaxed—his sister's reaction exceeded even his expectations.

Howard sat stunned, clutching his cheek. Suddenly he grabbed Theodore's ankle. "Tell them you made it up, son—"

"Don't touch him!" Olivia swayed, her pregnant belly throwing her off balance. Evelyn rushed forward as she doubled over, retching. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead.
###Chapter 275

Olivia Valdemar raised her hand to stop them, her lips curling into a bitter smile.

That smile was more heartbreaking than tears.

"Evelyn, forgive me for this unsightly display."

Evelyn Roland opened her mouth but only shook her head with a sigh.

"Howard, I've known about every single thing you've done these years." Olivia's voice was hoarse. "I never questioned the financial flows from Villa Tuscany."

She bit her lower lip until she tasted blood.

"The lipstick stains on your shirts, the perfume clinging to you—I pretended not to see." Her voice grew fainter. "All because I couldn't let go of the past."

Olivia lowered her head, the light in her eyes dimming.

"But Theodore is my line in the sand."

Her head snapped up, gaze sharp as a blade. "This marriage ends now. You'll return everything you took from me—principal and interest."

A tear traced down her cheek. She wiped it away carelessly.

"See you in court tomorrow."

Howard Merouin's face drained of color.

"Darling!" He dropped to his knees, clutching her legs desperately. "For our child's sake, give me another chance!"

Olivia pried his fingers off one by one.

"Don't touch me." Her voice was glacial. "Disgusting."

Howard collapsed onto the floor, watching his pregnant wife's retreating figure with growing horror.

The mansion. The luxury cars. The social status.

All gifts from Olivia. If she really sued...

He'd be left with nothing.

Bloodshot eyes burned with rage.

That bitch was trying to ruin him!

In a flash of movement, Howard lunged at Olivia.

"Ah!"

Scalp screaming in pain, Olivia was yanked backward. Two brutal slaps cracked across her face.

She staggered, hands clawing uselessly at the air.

The baby!

Evelyn and Sebastian Valdemar rushed forward simultaneously.

"Thud!"

Olivia hit the ground hard. She curled into a fetal position, sweat drenching her clothes instantly.

A spreading crimson stain bloomed beneath her.

"Olivia!" Evelyn dropped to her knees, pressing hard on Olivia's philtrum. "Stay awake! Look at me!"

Behind them came the sickening thuds of fists meeting flesh and Howard's shrieks of pain.

"Sebastian!" Evelyn's voice trembled. "Help her first!"
###Chapter 276

Sebastian's hand hung frozen in midair, his knuckles white as bone. The gruesome wound on his hand wept crimson, droplets splattering onto the floor.

In silence, he scooped up the unconscious Olivia and strode toward the exit. The servants had already whisked Theodore to safety, leaving only wreckage and Howard's barely breathing form in the living room.

The hospital corridor reeked of antiseptic.

When the operating light flickered on, Sebastian slammed his back against the wall. He stared at his bloodstained hands—the dark stains looked like indelible proof of his sins.

Evelyn stood nearby, the metallic tang of exertion still clinging to her throat.

She'd never seen Sebastian like this—the always-composed man now curled in the corner like a wounded beast, his shoulders heaving violently.

"Olivia will be fine." Kneeling, she began wiping the blood from his hands with a damp cloth.

Sebastian's head snapped up. His bloodshot eyes burned into hers, desperate for reassurance.

Then he yanked her into his arms.

"I can't lose her." His voice was raw, his breath scorching against her neck.

Evelyn stiffened briefly before returning the embrace. "I promise," she whispered. "Even if Death comes, I'll drag her back."

The hallway lights flickered.

His grip tightened until Evelyn gently pushed away. "Let me check inside." She nodded toward the OR. "I know the director."

Sebastian released her slowly, clarity returning to his gaze. "Howard..." he rasped.

"Leave him to me." Squeezing his hand, she added, "Olivia needs you strong."

The contact made them both freeze.

Suddenly he pulled her back into a crushing embrace. Evelyn felt his heart hammering against her.

"I'll be right back," he murmured, his warm breath grazing her ear.

She watched him disappear down the corridor. The OR light still glowed. Taking a deep breath, Evelyn turned and pushed through the staff entrance.
###Chapter 277

Sebastian Valdemar's tall figure cast a long shadow under the corridor lights. He took one last look at the glaring red light above the operating room before turning away, his polished shoes clicking urgently against the floor.

From the shadows of the corner, a pair of eyes observed everything.

Evelyn Roland strode swiftly through the sterilization corridor, the hem of her white coat fluttering. She pulled on sterile gloves with practiced ease, though her fingertips trembled slightly.

"The fetus has..." The nurse hesitated, then turned her face away as she handed over the surgical gown.

Under the surgical lights, Olivia Valdemar's pale face looked as fragile as paper. The monitor emitted a shrill alarm as her blood pressure continued to plummet.

"Hemostat." Evelyn's voice was terrifyingly calm.

The lead surgeon's forehead beaded with sweat. "Dr. Roland, the blood loss is too severe—"

"I said, hemostat."

The scalpel in her hand traced a precise arc. Blood splattered across her goggles, but she didn't even blink.

"Olivia, can you hear me?" Evelyn suddenly raised her voice. "Howard is filing for custody of Theodore."

The EKG on the monitor spiked violently.

"Howard will move into the Valdemar estate with that woman who hit you." Her hands never stopped working, but her voice softened. "Do you really want Theodore calling another woman 'Mom'?"

A single tear slid from the corner of Olivia's tightly shut eyes.

"Blood pressure rising!"
"Prepare for transfusion, now!"

The operating room erupted into frantic activity. Only when the lines on the monitor stabilized did Evelyn realize her back was drenched in cold sweat.

Meanwhile, at the Valdemar mansion.

Howard Merouin struggled to rise from the pool of blood, his ribs screaming with excruciating pain. He fumbled for his phone—thirty-seven missed calls lit up the screen.

All from his lawyer.

The latest text message froze the blood in his veins: "Ms. Valdemar suffered a miscarriage with severe hemorrhaging. Currently in critical condition."

The phone clattered to the floor. Howard suddenly remembered the look in Sebastian's eyes before he left—it wasn't anger.

It was the look one gives a dead man.
###Chapter 278

Howard Merouin struggled to his feet, the metallic taste of blood filling his mouth. He spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva, a broken tooth mixed in.

Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly stopped.

Turning around, he charged upstairs and barged into Theodore's room.

"You little brat, come with me!" He yanked Theodore up roughly. The child trembled at the sight of his blood-covered body, squeezing his eyes shut in fear.

The moment they stepped outside, they collided with Sebastian Valdemar.

"Stay back!" Howard shoved Theodore aside and pulled out a fruit knife from his pocket. "Get me a car to the airport, or else—"

Before he could finish, Sebastian lunged forward.

"Ah!" Howard screamed as his wrist was kicked at an unnatural angle. Theodore seized the chance to break free and scrambled into Sebastian's car.

Kneeling on the ground, Howard clutched his fractured wrist, howling in pain.

"Even a child wasn't spared." Sebastian's voice was icy. "I've already handed over all your overseas cases to the police."

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Howard collapsed, unconscious.

In the hospital corridor, Evelyn Roland stared at the numbers on the monitor and exhaled slightly in relief.

Olivia Valdemar's condition had finally stabilized.

"Give me the medication." She reached out for the bottle the nurse handed her.

Just as she was about to administer it, her brows furrowed.

"This isn't the right drug!" Her voice sharpened. "It's been switched!"

The nurse paled. "I—I didn't know—"

"Go get the correct one!" Another nurse reacted swiftly, sprinting away.

Minutes later, the surgery was completed successfully.

Leaning against the wall to catch her breath, Evelyn suddenly remembered something and rushed to the surveillance room.

On the way, she ran into Alexander Roland. Together, they pulled up the security footage.

The screen showed a woman in a nurse's uniform sneaking in and tampering with the medication.

"Isabella Langley!" Evelyn slammed her fist on the table.

They raced downstairs just as Isabella was attempting to leave.

Slap! A sharp crack echoed through the hallway.

Isabella clutched her cheek, tears instantly welling up. "Third Brother, she hit me!"

"It's all on camera." Alexander's voice was frigid. "Still denying it?"

"I didn't do anything!" Isabella sobbed dramatically, though her eyes darted nervously. "You're framing me!"

Evelyn grabbed her collar and yanked her forward. "You nearly killed someone!"
###Chapter 279

Isabella's fingertips trembled slightly.

She had deliberately changed into a nurse's uniform identical to the hospital staff. The mask and cap concealed her face completely, leaving only her eyes visible. The disguise should have been flawless in the hospital corridor.

But she hadn't counted on running into Alexander.

"Alex..." Her voice wavered, a cold sweat breaking out down her back. From the corner of her eye, she saw Evelyn's clenched fist and instinctively took half a step back. "It really wasn't me."

"The surveillance footage says otherwise." Evelyn thrust her phone forward, the screen displaying crystal-clear video evidence. She grabbed Isabella by the collar, shoving the phone in her face. "Do you know what this medication does? It could have killed someone!"

Isabella's pupils constricted.

The footage showed her sneaking around, the exact moment she switched the medication bottles. Worse still, the birthmark on her wrist was clearly visible.

"I've overlooked your petty schemes before," Evelyn hissed, each word dripping with ice. "But this? This is attempted murder."

The accusation hit Isabella like a sledgehammer. Her legs nearly gave out. Desperate, she turned to Alexander—only to meet his utterly disappointed gaze.

"Alex..." She clutched at his sleeve, tears welling up. "I know I was wrong. Please don't tell Mom and Dad—"

Evelyn suddenly released her, stepping back as if touching something filthy. With one last glance at Alexander, she turned on her heel and walked away.

The sharp click of her heels against the tile echoed through the hallway.

"Alex!" Panic set in fully now. Tears streamed down Isabella's face. "I swear it won't happen again, please—"

Her nails dug into his sleeve, turning her knuckles white.

A beam of light from the window at the end of the corridor illuminated Alexander's conflicted profile.
###Chapter 280

Isabella's eyes shimmered with hopeful anticipation.

Facing the person who had called him "brother" for over two decades, Alexander couldn't bring himself to be cruel.

He turned his face away, avoiding the intensity of her gaze. "I won't tell Mom and Dad." His voice paused. "From now on, you're on your own."

His slender fingers gently pried hers from his sleeve. As he turned, a cold breeze swept past.

In the empty hall, Isabella stood frozen. Her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt no pain.

Night fell, and the Roland family villa blazed with light.

"Evelyn, try this soup." Sophia ladled a spoonful of creamy broth, its rich aroma filling the dining room.

Evelyn cradled the bowl, her mother's warm smile visible through the rising steam. "Your cooking keeps getting better."

At the other end of the table, Isabella mechanically pushed rice around her plate. The clinking of chopsticks against porcelain was jarring in the silence.

"Isabella?" Sophia exchanged a glance with her husband.

Silver chopsticks clattered onto the plate. Isabella jerked her head up, flinching visibly when her gaze brushed past Evelyn. "I—I'm fine..."

Sophia sighed. "About that boy from the Valrose family—"

"Mom!" Isabella cut her off sharply, her nails leaving creases in the tablecloth.

"Speaking of which, Evelyn should start considering marriage too." Julian suddenly spoke up, the buttons on his military uniform cuff glinting coldly under the light. "Zachary Evans seems suitable."

Evelyn choked, her face flushing crimson.

"I'll invite him over for dinner next week." Julian's tone brooked no argument.

Sophia's eyes brightened. "The one from Evans Group? I heard—"

Amid the chatter, no one noticed the drop of blood welling from Isabella's bitten lip.
###Chapter 281

Evelyn's spoon clattered into her bowl with a sharp metallic ring.

Her wide eyes darted between Sophia and Alexander in disbelief. The latter merely arched an eyebrow, amusement dancing at the corners of his mouth.

A soft chime sounded as her phone lit up.

Julian's text glared back at her: "3 PM tomorrow. Café Central. Zachary will be waiting."

"Alexander!" Evelyn nearly shot up from her seat. "This is too sudden!"

Sophia gently pressed her hand. "I know you dislike blind dates. But Zachary is a fine young man. Just think of it as meeting a new friend?"

Afternoon sunlight fractured through the café's glass panes.

Evelyn glanced at the photo on her phone again. The man in the picture had razor-sharp features and an aura that screamed "keep away." She'd deliberately chosen a beige knit sweater and the palest lipstick she owned.

"Miss Roland?"

A deep voice startled her. Zachary stood before her table, his demeanor completely different from the photo. Laughter lines crinkled at his eyes as he pulled out the chair. "I didn't expect our reunion to happen like this. Thank you for catching my father's condition at the hospital."

Before Evelyn could respond, a familiar hand snatched her coffee cup away.

"Mr. Valdemar?"

Sebastian slammed the cup down with enough force to make the table rattle. "How convenient that you're free for social calls but unavailable for our contract signing." His gaze flicked between them like a blade.

Zachary frowned. "And you are?"

"A business associate." Sebastian seized Evelyn's wrist. "We have urgent revisions to discuss."

Evelyn stumbled after him. Only when the elevator doors closed did she find her voice. "Thank you for the rescue. But what were you doing at the café?"

Sebastian stared at the ascending floor numbers, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Passing by."

When the doors opened, he strode out without looking back, his rigid posture resembling tempered steel.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, fingertips absently tracing the lingering warmth on her wrist.
###Chapter 282

The night deepened, neon lights painting the city in a kaleidoscope of colors.

Zachary Merouin had just uncorked a bottle of whiskey when the bar doors burst open. Sebastian Valdemar strode in with stormy eyes, his aura icy enough to repel any approach.

"Well, well. Who pissed off the mighty Sebastian Valdemar?" Zachary slid a glass across the counter, watching him down it in one gulp. "Since when do you drown your sorrows?"

Sebastian slammed the glass down, knuckles whitening. The shifting bar lights carved shadows across his sharp features, intensifying his grim expression.

"The café," he growled. "I saw her on a blind date."

Zachary arched a brow, swirling his drink lazily. "The great Valdemar heir got rejected?" He leaned in, intrigued. "What happened next?"

"I interrupted." Sebastian's jaw tightened. "And she... thanked me."

His words faltered. Why had that smile she gave another man made his blood boil? Why the restless irritation clawing at his chest?

Zachary chuckled, seeing right through him. "Admit it. You're jealous."

The words struck like a key, unlocking the fog in Sebastian's mind.

Should he tell her?

"Regret comes too late for cowards." Zachary clinked their glasses meaningfully.

Sebastian's gaze hardened with resolve.

The upscale restaurant glowed with candlelight, a lone violinist's melody weaving through the air. Sebastian lit the final candle as the door creaked open.

Stiletto heels clicked against marble. He looked up to meet Evelyn Roland's startled eyes.

"What's all this?" She lingered at the threshold, uncertain.

"Sit." He pulled out her chair with quiet courtesy.

Firelight danced across his throat as he swallowed. The confession hovered on his lips.

"Evelyn, I—"

CRASH.

The violinist collapsed, limbs seizing.

They bolted upright. Evelyn rushed to administer first aid until sirens wailed outside.

Later, smoothing her disheveled hair, she turned to him. "What were you saying earlier?"

Sebastian studied her concerned expression and let the words dissolve.

"Nothing important." His lashes lowered, shielding the truth.
###Chapter 283

Evelyn Roland frowned slightly, her gaze lingering on Sebastian Valdemar's face for a moment. The man's expression was clearly off, but since he claimed nothing was wrong, she didn't press further.

"Glad to hear it." She took a sip of tea. "I thought there was something important you wanted to discuss over dinner."

Under the soft lighting, Sebastian's fingers tapped absently against the table. The formidable business tycoon seemed uncharacteristically restless.

"Actually..." His voice dropped low. "I wanted to ask about the progress of my condition."

So it was about the poisoning. Evelyn's tense shoulders relaxed.

"We're working on it." She set down her cup. "Results will come soon."

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed as he fixed her with an intense stare. "Thank you."

The weight of his gaze made the tips of Evelyn's ears burn. She noticed the faint flush on his cheeks, though the private dining room was perfectly air-conditioned.

"Do you have a fever?" She reached out to check his forehead.

Sebastian coughed abruptly, nearly dropping the food from his chopsticks. "Just an old issue." He dodged her hand. "Nothing serious."

Evelyn silently vowed to find the antidote as soon as possible.

"Hold on a little longer." Her voice was firm. "I'll figure something out."

"Contact me immediately if you feel worse."

Mention of the hospital reminded her of Olivia. "How's your sister doing?"

"Physically recovering." Sebastian's eyes darkened. "But emotional wounds are harder to heal."

"Maybe we should visit her?" Evelyn suggested.

When they left the restaurant, Sebastian opened the car door for her with unusual care. His hand hovered protectively above her head, ensuring she wouldn't bump against the frame.

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured.

In the hospital garden, children's laughter rang bright and clear as they chased each other.

"I hope Theo can laugh like that someday," Sebastian said, watching them.

"He will." Evelyn's tone left no room for doubt.

As they entered the lobby, a familiar figure made Evelyn pause mid-step.

Julian Roland strode over and pulled her aside. "What are you doing with him?"

"Visiting a friend." She met his gaze steadily before turning to Sebastian. "Go ahead upstairs."

Sebastian's eyes flicked between the siblings before he nodded silently and walked away.

"Why are you at the hospital, Julian?" Evelyn attempted to divert the topic.

"Don't change the subject." Julian's brow furrowed. "Was he the one who interrupted your blind date last time?"

His sharp eyes caught the faint blush on his sister's cheeks, setting off alarm bells in his mind.
###Chapter 284

"What exactly is your relationship with Sebastian Valdemar?"

Julian Roland's piercing gaze locked onto her.

Evelyn Roland's fingers trembled slightly as she calmly closed the medical chart. "Just a doctor-patient relationship."

"Really?" Julian studied her face intently.

"Don't you trust me, brother?" Evelyn smiled faintly, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

Julian's expression softened, though his brow remained furrowed. "Sebastian has a complicated background. Stay away from him."

"I understand."

"Evelyn..." He hesitated, protective instincts surging for this sister he'd only recently reclaimed.

"Don't worry," Evelyn cut in smoothly. "We're merely acquaintances."

Seeing her composed demeanor, Julian finally relaxed. "Remember, tell me immediately if anything happens."

"Of course."

Childish laughter spilled from the hospital room.

Theodore Valdemar curled contentedly in Sebastian's lap, their heads bent together over a storybook. The boy who'd refused to speak a month ago now giggled and pointed at the pages.

Evelyn paused in the doorway, an unconscious smile touching her lips.

"Dr. Roland." Olivia Valdemar sat propped against the pillows, her complexion markedly improved.

Sebastian stood abruptly to offer his seat, his movements almost too quick.

"Your vitals look excellent." Evelyn checked the monitors. "Keep maintaining this positive outlook."

"After cheating death, perspective changes." Olivia ruffled her son's hair. "For Theo, I'll keep fighting."

A phone vibrated.

Bianca Savigny's name flashed on the screen.

"Excuse me." Evelyn stepped into the hallway, noting the security camera at the far end. "I'll call you back from my office."

After ending the call, she returned to bid farewell.

"Let me walk you out." Sebastian already held his coat.

"That won't be necessary." Her refusal was crisp and final.

The door clicked shut behind her, obscuring the sudden dimming of light in the man's eyes.

"If you like her, chase her." Olivia's quiet voice broke the silence.

Sebastian stiffened.

"Don't bother denying it." She chuckled. "The way you look at her? Impossible to hide."
###Chapter 285

Evelyn Roland's sports car traced a graceful arc as it pulled up to the gates of Château Blanc.

She tossed the keys to an approaching valet without ceremony, her black trench coat flapping sharply in the wind.

"Master!"

Bianca Savigny bounded out from the main hall like an exuberant fawn, immediately latching onto Evelyn's arm.

Regular patrons turned to stare. The usually efficient vineyard manager now clung to her mentor like an affectionate child, nuzzling her cheek against Evelyn's shoulder.

"People are watching," Evelyn chided, tapping Bianca's forehead with a sigh.

In the private lounge on the third floor, crystal chandeliers cast pools of warm golden light.

"Try this." Bianca proudly presented a glass of pink-hued cocktail. "I spent three days perfecting it."

Evelyn took a measured sip, the tang of berries dancing on her tongue. "The acidity is off by 0.3 points."

"Knew I couldn't fool you." Bianca stuck out her tongue, then abruptly sobered. "There's something..."

She produced a gilded envelope from her briefcase.

"Rose International?" Evelyn's fingers stilled on the stationery.

The embossed logo of the International Wine Tasting Championship gleamed under the lights. Bianca gestured excitedly, "They want to rent our vineyard for the finals!"

Dusk deepened beyond the windows, framing Evelyn's profile in silhouette against the glass.

"What did they say on the call?"

"Extremely generous terms, just need to ensure the judges' experience..." Bianca hesitated mid-sentence. "Master, do you sense something wrong?"

Evelyn folded the letter precisely. "Too convenient."

Bianca shot to her feet. "I'll reject them immediately—"

"No need." Slender fingers pressed the envelope flat. "Since we've accepted, we'll execute it flawlessly."

The last sliver of sunset vanished behind distant mountains. Bianca suddenly lowered her voice. "Actually...there's more."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"The Rose International liaison..." Bianca bit her lip. "It's that Mr. Smith you know."

The crystal glass clinked sharply against the table. Evelyn's eyes darkened instantly, sending tiny ripples through the remaining wine.
###Chapter 286

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the ink-black night outside.

The cigarette between my fingers had burned down to the filter, the heat making me flinch.

My phone screen lit up with a message from Sebastian: "See you tomorrow."

Just three simple words, yet they made my heart skip a beat.

Tomorrow was the shareholders' meeting.

Sebastian would officially take over Valdemar Group.

And I would stand beside him as his fiancée.

This identity had come too fast, leaving me unprepared.

Three months ago, I was just an ordinary girl working at a coffee shop.

Now, I was about to face the scrutiny of the entire business world at Sebastian's side.

My phone vibrated again.

It was an itinerary from his assistant.

9 AM tomorrow, top-floor conference room at Valdemar Tower.

I stared at the words, my throat tightening.

Ding-dong—

The doorbell rang suddenly.

Startled, I dropped ash onto the carpet.

Through the peephole, I saw Sebastian standing outside.

He wore a black trench coat, the collar slightly open.

I took a deep breath and opened the door.

"It's so late—"

Before I could finish, he pulled me into his arms.

The cool night air clung to him, mingling with the faint scent of his cologne.

"Couldn't sleep," he murmured, his voice low.

I rested my head against his chest, listening to his steady heartbeat.

"Nervous?" he asked.

I nodded.

He chuckled and tilted my chin up.

"I'm here."

Those three words were more reassuring than any promise.

Outside, a bolt of lightning split the sky.

The storm was coming.

Dorian Wayne's carefree smile froze abruptly.

His brows furrowed slightly, eyes sharpening like blades.

Calvin Lee recounted the events calmly before asking, "Was my action too reckless?"

"Reckless?" Joy let out a mirthless laugh. "Had it been my decision, Rowan Shore would've lost his head too."

Calvin Lee shook his head wryly. "You're not worried about the Sixteen Cavalry staging an immediate mutiny?"

Joy's eyes gleamed. "Merely jesting. But eliminating Rowan Shore would bring more advantages than risks."

"As long as the Sixteen Cavalry doesn't rebel outright, Your Highness could severely weaken Prince Ning's military control—even without absorbing all fifteen thousand troops."

"High stakes, higher rewards."

"By executing Ye Wang as a warning, you've planted discord within their ironclad ranks."

Calvin Lee nodded approvingly. "Precisely. Prince Ning tested my resolve. Now he's lost both his pawn and his advantage."

"What's Your Highness's next move?" Joy pressed.

"Await Prince Ning's indignant confrontation," Calvin Lee replied impassively.

Joy pondered. "The Jin City ambush caught him off-guard. With Liao forces at our borders, he won't dare openly oppose you—but the probing won't stop."

"He needs to gauge your limits to maximize his gains."

His expression darkened. "The situation still favors him."

"Naturally." Calvin Lee's gaze turned glacial. "With limited leverage, we're at a disadvantage."

"But I'm not without means to overturn the board."

Just as Calvin Lee prepared to mention the approaching Jin army, a shrill cry pierced the air:

"Assassins!"

Every muscle in Calvin Lee's body tensed.

His first thought was that the deranged monk Jue'an had dared strike within Crescent Pass.

Xu Wei and Dorian Wayne reacted instantly, shielding Calvin Lee.

Yet no attackers materialized.

Several shadowy figures burst from Soren Joy's courtyard, fleeing in panic.

"Changshou's in danger!"

Calvin Lee barked orders: "Hunt down those assassins! Ping'an, come with me!"

Joy gripped his sovereign's sleeve desperately. "Your Highness, this could be a trap!"

"That's your blood brother!" Calvin Lee growled.

Joy's lips trembled. "All the more reason for me to go! Your safety—"

"Enough!"

Shoving Joy aside, Calvin Lee sprinted toward the courtyard with his guards.

Inside, they found Soren Joy cradling a blood-soaked Caihe, sitting motionless before the doorway—his face ashen with horror.
###Chapter 287

The crystal glass refracted hazy halos under the light.

Bianca Savigny took a cautious sip, her tongue immediately enveloped by complex layers of flavor.

"Master, I taste the sweetness of malt sugar, citrus notes..." She wrinkled her nose. "But that final note—I can't place it."

Evelyn Roland leaned against the bar, fingertips tapping the countertop.

"Tell me tomorrow." She straightened abruptly. "Now, repeat every step I just did."

Bianca's fingers froze mid-air.

She'd been too mesmerized by her mentor's fluid movements to memorize the details.

"I..."

Evelyn was already shrugging into her coat.

"See you tomorrow." A dismissive wave. Her black trench coat cut a sharp arc as she exited.

Bianca stared at the amber residue in her glass, stomping her foot in frustration.

The bar erupted.

"I'll have what she's having!"

"Me too!"

The bartender's Adam's apple bobbed.

He bowed deeply to the surging crowd.

"Apologies..." His voice dwindled. "That technique...I couldn't follow it."

Bianca burst into giggles.

She swirled her glass, watching the liquid leave seductive trails.

"Seems Master only spoils me~"

Humming, she sauntered toward the staff entrance under a chorus of envious groans.

Night draped the penthouse.

Evelyn's fingers glided across her tablet. The judges' list glowed coldly.

"Interesting."

A humorless smile touched her lips, eyes glacial.

Three names were circled in red—like jagged scars.

The sofa creaked faintly.

She tilted her head back. The ceiling reflected in her obsidian pupils, twin abysses.

Fingers drummed against her knee.

One. Two. Three.

The rhythm synchronized with the wall clock's ticking.

"Game on."

As dawn's first rays pierced the curtains, she hit delete.

"Wipe it all."
###Chapter 288

The grand hall of Château Blanc buzzed with activity.

Bianca Savigny emerged at the top of the staircase, rubbing her bleary eyes. Her disheveled appearance betrayed an all-night bartending session.

"You didn't sleep?" Evelyn Roland frowned at her protégé. Bianca still wore yesterday's clothes, her smudged eyeliner giving her a raccoon-like appearance.

"Master, it's too hard," Bianca pouted, swaying toward Evelyn.

"Go freshen up first." Evelyn gently pushed her away. "Come find me later."

After shooing her apprentice off, Evelyn resumed discussions with the renovation crew. The entire estate hummed with last-minute preparations.

Workers scurried across the gray-carpeted hall like ants.

Mid-sentence, Evelyn collided with a solid wall of warmth. She stumbled backward, only to be steadied by a large hand at her waist.

Turning, she met Sebastian Valdemar's deep-set eyes and exhaled in relief.

The hand withdrew instantly as Sebastian stepped half a pace beside her.

"You didn't call for me?" His baritone voice carried morning crispness.

Evelyn hesitated before putting distance between them. A shadow flickered through the man's gaze, vanishing as quickly as it appeared.

"I can handle the château affairs. No need to trouble you."

"Trouble?" Sebastian repeated, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Evelyn cleared her throat, softening her tone. "Why are you here? Not feeling well?"

"Some chest tightness this morning." He coughed into his fist, voice deliberately weak. "Better now."

Her assessing gaze lingered on his face before relenting. No one knew his constitution better than she did.

"Wait for me over there."

Glancing at her dust-covered hands, she turned toward the restroom.

"No rush." Sebastian obediently settled on a sofa, tracking her retreating figure.

Ten minutes later, Evelyn returned and grasped his wrist.

"Your pulse is racing?"

Her fingertips pressed against his chest as she narrowed her eyes.

His pupils darkened. "It's nothing—"

"Rest first." With limited resources, she could only perform a cursory examination.

As she turned to leave, Sebastian followed.

"Didn't I tell you to sit?"

His warm fingers brushed her cheek during her pivot.

"Paper shred." He opened his palm to reveal a tiny fragment.

Before she could thank him, he continued, "Let me help with the château preparations."

"You need rest. I've got this."

She tucked a stray lock behind her ear.

Sebastian stepped closer, his gaze burning. "As business partners, I'm obligated for the wine tasting competition."

Gentle yet unyielding.

"Fine. Let's review the plans together."

Seeing his determination, Evelyn finally conceded.
###Chapter 289

"Place this painting here."

Evelyn Roland directed the staff with focused precision as they decorated the main hall of Château Blanc, completely unaware of the man standing beside her.

"Move that screen slightly to the right..."

Her voice had grown hoarse, yet she insisted on overseeing every detail herself.

Sebastian Valdemar stood behind her, his gaze never leaving her bustling figure.

His brow furrowed slightly as he spoke in a low voice, "Take a break. I'll handle it."

"No need. I'm fine."

This international competition was crucial for Château Blanc—she couldn’t afford any mistakes.

"Still treating me like an outsider?"

He hated when she carried burdens alone, as if he could never truly enter her world.

The already pale man's expression darkened further, his slender fingers tightening unconsciously.

The air around them grew heavy.

When Evelyn turned, she caught sight of his tense demeanor.

Suppressing a sigh, she relented and handed him the event plan. "Fine, it's yours. I'll grab some water." The corners of her eyes curved gently.

Sebastian took the documents with a quiet acknowledgment, the rigid line of his jaw finally relaxing.

He watched her walk away, unspoken emotions swirling in his eyes.

By noon, the main hall had been transformed. Crystal chandeliers cast dazzling reflections, and the new anti-slip carpet felt plush underfoot.

Against his usual habits, Sebastian stayed for lunch.

The dining room was filled with enticing aromas.

The table was laden with richly spiced, aromatic dishes—all bold and fiery flavors.

Sebastian instinctively pressed a hand to his stomach.

Years of adhering to a mild diet meant he never touched such stimulating foods.

But if these were her preferences...

Just as he picked up his chopsticks, an elegant plate appeared before him.

It held several light, delicately portioned side dishes.

"Don’t even think about those." Evelyn nudged the plate closer. "They’re not for you."

The corner of Sebastian’s lips lifted involuntarily.

"Try it."

Their plates presented a stark contrast—one vibrant and bold, the other subtle and refined.

"It should be decent."

Sebastian took a bite, surprise flickering in his eyes.

"I specifically asked the chef to prepare dishes suited to your palate. Though they might not compare to your family’s private chef..."

She had, after all, poached a Michelin-starred chef at great expense. She had every reason to be confident.

"It’s delicious. Thank you."

Half the plate was empty in moments. As he reached for more, a slender hand stopped him.

"Your stomach can’t handle large portions. This is enough."

Sebastian’s brows arched, his heartbeat skipping.

She remembered even his dietary limits?

The tips of his ears warmed, but Evelyn was too occupied with her meal to notice.

After lunch, she led him to the lounge.

"Drink some tea—it’s good for digestion. This is my special floral blend."

Before the first sip, the delicate fragrance already soothed his senses.
###Chapter 290

Sebastian took the teacup, his fingertips brushing against hers in an accidental caress.

"An intriguing aroma."

He lowered his head, inhaling the delicate scent of tea laced with a faint, elusive sweetness.

Evelyn settled beside him on the sofa, the cushions dipping slightly under her weight.

They sat so close that the rhythm of each other's breaths became audible.

Sebastian's throat moved as he swallowed, his knuckles whitening around the cup.

The subtle fragrance of gardenias clinging to her skin was more intoxicating than the floral tea.

"This blend..."

"Take some home if you like." She turned her face toward him, the corners of her eyes curving into soft crescents. "It helps with insomnia."

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting dappled shadows on her lashes.

By the time their cups were empty, the conversation had meandered from tea leaves to the company's new project.

Sebastian caught himself discussing trivial matters—stranger still, he was enjoying this meaningless exchange.

"Actually, I—"

His words died as a weight settled against his shoulder.

Evelyn had fallen asleep against him, her breathing slow and even. Strands of her hair tickled his neck.

Sebastian froze, not daring to move.

Her peaceful face, lips slightly parted like ripe cherries begging to be plucked—

His hand lifted of its own volition, hovering just shy of touching her—

"Mr. Valdemar!"

Theodore barged in with an armful of files, his eyes wide behind his glasses.

Sebastian's gaze turned glacial.

"Get out."

The three syllables sent his assistant scrambling for the door.

As it clicked shut, Evelyn nuzzled unconsciously against his shoulder.

Sebastian looked down, his focus dropping to her parted lips.

His throat tightened.
###Chapter 291

Sebastian had never been this close to Evelyn before. Her sleeping face was mere inches away, making his breath hitch. Even the fine down on her cheeks was visible, glowing softly under the light.

His gaze lingered on her slightly parted lips, the rosy hue like a silent invitation. Before he realized it, he leaned in, his pulse pounding loud in his ears.

Just as their lips were about to meet, Evelyn's eyes fluttered open.

"You..." Her voice was drowsy, laced with sleep. "What are you doing?"

Sebastian froze, his Adam's apple bobbing. He straightened abruptly, the tips of his ears turning pink.

"Why is your face so red?" Evelyn's attention snapped to his flushed skin. She propped herself up, her warm breath brushing his neck.

He instinctively moved back, but she cupped his face with both hands.

"Don't move." She frowned, studying the rapid spread of crimson across his cheeks, down to his neck, as if flames were licking his skin.

Her expression turned serious. "This isn't normal."

She hurried to the medical cabinet, rummaging for supplies. Sebastian watched her bustling figure, his gaze darkening.

"Lie down." She returned with a stethoscope, gesturing to the couch.

Sebastian arched a brow. "Here?"

"Don't overthink it." Evelyn remained stern. "I need to check your vitals. It might be a toxin reaction."

The cold metal of the stethoscope pressed against his chest as she listened intently. Her fingers accidentally grazed his skin, sending a shiver through him.

"Does this hurt?" She pressed lightly on his abdomen.

Sebastian's throat tightened. "No."

As the examination continued, his flush only deepened. Evelyn bit her lower lip, baffled.

"Ms. Roland." Sebastian finally spoke, his voice rough.

She looked up, questioning.

"I'm just..." He cleared his throat. "Not used to being this close to someone."

Evelyn blinked, then burst into laughter, her eyes crinkling. The sight made Sebastian's heart skip another beat.

"So the mighty Sebastian Valdemar is easily flustered?" She deliberately leaned closer, amused by the way his jaw tensed.

Who would have thought the formidable business tycoon had such an adorable side? The discovery inexplicably lifted her mood.
###Chapter 292

The moment Evelyn's fingertips brushed against Sebastian's chest, she felt his muscles tense instantly.

A mischievous glint flashed in her eyes.

"Mr. Valdemar," she drawled, her crimson lips nearly grazing his earlobe, "don't tell me... you've never been in a relationship before?"

The tips of Sebastian's ears turned visibly red.

His reaction only fueled Evelyn's playful mood. She leaned in closer, tracing slow circles on his chest with her delicate fingers.

Bang—

The door swung open abruptly.

Bianca stood frozen, her files scattering across the floor. Behind her, Theodore gasped so sharply his phone slipped from his grasp and shattered.

The air turned to ice.

"M-Master..." Bianca stammered, "I came to discuss the wine tasting competition..."

Evelyn straightened with effortless grace, as if nothing had happened.

"Wait for me in the conservatory."

Once the two left, only Sebastian and Theodore remained in the room.

The atmosphere plummeted to subzero temperatures.

"Contract." Sebastian's voice could have frozen hell itself.

Theodore trembled as he handed over the documents, not daring to meet his boss's gaze.

After signing, Sebastian adjusted his suit jacket, the crystal cufflinks gleaming like frost under the light.

"Business emergency. I'm leaving."

Outside the winery gates, Theodore finally cracked. "Sir, about you and Ms. Roland—"

"Silence."

One icy glare from Sebastian, and Theodore sealed his lips.

Meanwhile, inside Château Blanc, Bianca blinked rapidly.

"Master, that was—"

"Focus on the matter at hand." Evelyn flipped open the file, her fingers tapping lightly against the pages.

Bianca swallowed her burning curiosity.

The day of the competition arrived swiftly.

By 8 AM, Château Blanc buzzed with activity.

The parking lot overflowed with limited-edition supercars, each worth more than a luxury penthouse.

Staff guided VIP guests with practiced efficiency.

"Your invitation, please."

Every visitor caught the faint aroma of grapes lingering in the air.

Evelyn stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor, surveying the bustling crowd below.

She'd chosen a champagne-colored gown today, the diamonds sewn into the skirt catching the light with every movement.

Everything was ready.

Now, the show could begin.
###Chapter 293

"The aesthetic of this winery is truly distinctive."

Guests murmured in admiration as they entered the meticulously arranged guest rooms.

A sleek black luxury sedan glided into Château Blanc. The door opened, revealing a middle-aged man with golden hair and piercing blue eyes.

"It's Mr. Ross!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd. As an internationally renowned master sommelier, Ross's presence instantly commanded attention.

Organizing committee members hesitated, eager to greet him, but faltered at his aloof expression.

Ross surveyed the surroundings, his gaze lingering on the winery's architecture. A faint smile touched his lips.

"Let's proceed."

Staff remained composed despite the VIP's arrival, offering only polite glances before resuming their duties.

At the entrance, a staff member politely stopped him. "Sir, may I see your invitation?"

"Please enter." The staff member verified it with professional detachment before turning to the next guest.

This subtle display of impartiality made Ross's eyes flicker with surprise. He glanced back at the upright, focused staff—none distracted by his fame.

"Master Ross?" His assistant noticed his pause.

"Let's go." Ross strode toward the tasting hall beside the main building.

Inside, guests mingled in small groups, the atmosphere convivial yet refined.

A uniformed middle-aged man stepped to the center, followed by a young waiter pushing a cart.

"Welcome to Château Blanc. Our proprietor has prepared a small token of appreciation."

At his signal, the waiter began distributing two exquisite gift boxes to each guest.

One contained delicate pastries, the other two bottles of premium wine.

Connoisseurs instantly recognized the wine's value—each bottle worth at least five figures.

"My god, this is beyond generous!" The assistant whispered, mentally calculating the gifts' total worth.

But Ross's attention was drawn to the pastries. He noticed each guest's selection seemed unique.

"Master, could it be—" The assistant stared at the familiar hometown pastry before him, speechless.

"Finally catching on." Ross scoffed softly, sampling a piece. A spark of delight flashed in his eyes.

Once gifts were distributed, the middle-aged man smiled. "After your journey, please retire to your rooms and rest."
###Chapter 294

"Mr. Macmillan, this is your room."

The staff member led Ross to the third floor. As the door opened, a faint trace of soothing incense drifted through the air.

Ross narrowed his eyes slightly.

This Miss Roland... was rather intriguing.

After settling in, Ross changed into casual attire and strolled through the winery.

All committee members had arrived, yet the reception staff remained energetic, their smiles genuine and warm.

In the garden pavilion, several employees immediately stood and greeted him with poised yet relaxed manners.

Ross found himself curious. "You seem to enjoy working here?"

"Yes, we're treated with dignity here," a waitress replied, her eyes bright.

"At my last job, people looked down on servers," a younger employee added. "But Miss Roland taught us that no job is beneath anyone."

An older staff member's eyes grew moist. "I wanted to end my life... until she gave me a new purpose."

Ross listened quietly, his expression softening.

"Keep up the good work," he murmured as he stood. "Château Blanc is worthy of your pride."

Over the next two days, Ross's astonishment grew.

He'd seen countless performative philanthropists, but Evelyn Roland's sincerity couldn't be faked.

From her employees' devotion to every meticulous detail, this young winery owner displayed not just competence, but rare integrity.

Perhaps this partnership would exceed his expectations.

Morning light spilled into the hall as Sebastian approached Evelyn's resting form on the sofa.

"Tired?" he asked softly.

She shook her head. "You're the one who's lost weight again."

Before Sebastian could respond, his posture stiffened.

"Uncle?"

A middle-aged man stood at the entrance with a polite smile. "Long time no see, Sebastian."

Vincent Valdemar's gaze slid past his nephew, settling on Evelyn. "At last we meet, Miss Roland."
###Chapter 295

Vincent Valdemar extended his slender fingers. Evelyn Roland grasped them without hesitation. She lifted her gaze to meet the middle-aged man across from them, the corners of her eyes tilting slightly.

"Uncle, you came?" Sebastian Valdemar's tone was deferential.

The man stroked his beard. "I heard the competition was being held domestically this time, so I returned. At my age, I don't plan on traveling anymore."

"This way, please."

Preparations for the International Wine Tasting Championship proceeded with military precision. Contestants stood ready, awaiting the mandatory pre-entry inspection—an anti-cheating tradition.

Evelyn followed protocol step by step. Though everything was under control, an inexplicable tension coiled in her chest. Her right eyelid twitched incessantly, as if foretelling impending disaster.

"What is this?"

A staff member's sharp exclamation sliced through the air. All eyes snapped toward the commotion.

Evelyn hurried forward. When she saw Bianca Savigny at the center of the crowd, her pupils constricted violently.

She refused to believe Bianca would ever cheat.

The official brandished a small pill. "Contestant Bianca Savigny, explain why you're carrying a banned stimulant!"

Bianca's panicked gaze darted around. "It's not mine! I don't know how it got on me—"

The young woman trembled under the scrutiny, her voice shaking.

Evelyn stepped between them. "There must be some mistake."

"Ha! Everyone knows you're close. You'd cover for her even if she cheated!"

"Exactly! This is unfair to other contestants!"

The murmurs swelled like a tidal wave, engulfing them both.

"Château Blanc resorting to such dirty tricks? Disgraceful."

"That winery should be shut down!"

Ross Macmillan had been waiting quietly for the event's start. The disturbance caught his attention. After assessing the situation, his brow furrowed as he observed the spectacle with cold detachment.

A flustered organizer approached. "Mr. Macmillan, a minor incident has occurred. Please wait in the lounge—"

Ross ignored him. His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn like a hawk sighting prey.
###Chapter 296

"Miss Roland, you owe me an explanation."

Sebastian Valdemar's voice cut through the air like ice, his sharp gaze sweeping across the room. The doping scandal at the International Wine Tasting Championship was nothing short of an insult to the entire industry.

"If your people are proven guilty of cheating," he paused, his tone dropping even colder, "everyone here today will become a laughingstock."

Bianca Savigny paled, her delicate fingers gripping the hem of her dress.

"I didn't do it!" Her voice trembled. "I know nothing about any stimulants—"

A staff member cut her off roughly. "Still denying it with solid evidence right here?"

Bianca stumbled back, tears welling in her eyes. She looked to Evelyn Roland for help, like a frightened fawn.

Sebastian suddenly strode toward Evelyn. Under the stunned gazes of the crowd, he stopped beside her.

"Silence."

Two simple words, yet they instantly hushed the noisy hall.

His cold eyes swept the room before settling on the aggressive staff member.

"Right now, the priority is tracing the source of the stimulant," he said quietly, each word deliberate. "Not making baseless accusations against the winery's representative."

The room fell dead silent. Everyone knew the consequences of crossing the Valdemar Group.

Sebastian shifted slightly, shielding Evelyn behind him. The unconscious gesture warmed her heart.

Ross Macmillan spoke up. "Mr. Valdemar, we need the truth."

"If this is a frame-up, clear the contestant's name. If proven true," he gave Bianca a pointed look, "such people don't belong in this industry."

Bianca could no longer hold back her sobs.

"Everyone!" Evelyn stepped forward. "This is clearly a plot against Château Blanc!"

Someone in the crowd scoffed. "Proof? Anyone can make empty claims."

Just then, Sebastian's phone vibrated. Reading the message, his lips curled into a cold smile.

"Proof?" He raised his phone. "Surveillance footage shows someone tampering with the contestant's bag when she wasn't looking."

The screen displayed the video: a masked woman slipping something into Bianca's bag furtively.

Gasps filled the room.

Evelyn seized the moment. "Now, it's someone else's turn to give us an explanation."
###Chapter 297

A faint smile played on Evelyn Roland's lips, her eyes gleaming with quiet confidence.

"The evidence is right here." Her cool voice instantly silenced the entire venue.

All eyes locked onto the striking woman. Even Bianca Savigny stared at her mentor in stunned silence.

"Bianca has a severe allergy to stimulants. She would never use such substances."

The room erupted in chaos.

Bianca froze. She'd never heard of this allergy before. How did Evelyn know?

Before she could process it, Evelyn produced a medical certificate confirming the allergy.

"Who's to say that document isn't forged?" someone sneered from the crowd.

The blatant provocation made Evelyn's eyes narrow.

Just as she prepared to counter, Bianca stepped forward.

"Then I'll prove it myself." Her voice trembled slightly but held firm.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. Meeting Bianca's determined gaze, she gave a subtle nod.

A staff member quickly brought the injection.

The moment the needle pierced her skin, angry red welts erupted across Bianca's arm. Her breathing turned ragged.

Evelyn swiftly administered antihistamines before turning to face the crowd.

"Any more doubts?"

Dead silence.

Though vindicated, Bianca was still forced to withdraw from the competition.

Then Evelyn spoke again. "I'll take her place."

Gasps rippled through the audience.

The rules allowed substitutions, especially under extenuating circumstances.

"Pathetic performance," came a derisive chuckle from the shadows.

A hulking man stood there, surveying Evelyn with open contempt.

"Dominic, this..." His associate hesitated.

The man—Dominic Laurent—snorted, his disdain deepening.
###Chapter 298

"Château Blanc still dares to compete?" Dominic Laurent scoffed, tapping his fingers on the table. "If I were them, I'd have crawled into a hole by now."

His lackey immediately chimed in, "You're absolutely right, Dom! That woman isn't even fit to polish your shoes."

Dominic smirked in satisfaction. As the rising star of the sommelier world, he'd always looked down on everyone. The earlier fiasco only deepened his disdain for Evelyn Roland.

The competition began promptly. The first round was white wine tasting.

"Contestants must identify the alcohol content, ingredients, and aging period of each sample," the host announced, his gaze flickering between Dominic and Evelyn.

All eyes were on the pair—Dominic, the acknowledged prodigy, and Evelyn, representing the disgraced winery.

Evelyn remained composed. She lifted the glass and drank in one smooth motion. The wine swirled across her palate as she pressed her tongue against the roof of her mouth. Every detail of the vintage crystallized in her mind.

From the audience, Sebastian Valdemar's piercing gaze never left her. Bathed in stage lights, Evelyn seemed to glow, her focused expression strikingly beautiful. The usual coldness in his eyes softened imperceptibly.

"Brilliant!" Ross Macmillan couldn't help murmuring in admiration.

When the first round concluded, Evelyn won by a narrow margin. Dominic's face darkened—a single miscalculation on the final sample had cost him victory.

"Impossible!" He clenched his fists but dared not make a scene.

Yet Evelyn frowned. The aftertaste of one competition sample lingered—a faint trace of industrial alcohol lurking beneath the vintage's richness like a hidden viper.

This was wrong. Competition wines underwent rigorous screening. How could industrial alcohol appear?

She strode toward Sebastian. The man had reverted to his usual unapproachable demeanor, the earlier warmth in his eyes gone as if imagined.

"The wine was tainted," she stated bluntly. "I detected industrial alcohol."

Sebastian's gaze turned glacial, the air around him dropping several degrees. "Certain?"

"Absolutely." Her voice brooked no argument. "We need to trace the source immediately."

Their eyes met, and they spoke simultaneously: "To the winery."
###Chapter 299

Their eyes met in silent understanding.

Sebastian Valdemar tapped the table with his slender fingers, a sharp glint flashing in his gaze.

"Let's go." His lips barely moved.

Posing as business partners, they slipped effortlessly into the winery's restricted area.

Evelyn Roland headed straight for the competition wines, her fingertips grazing the edge of a barrel.

"Something's off." Her eyes narrowed.

The once-clear liquid now held faint, murky particles.

Sebastian bent closer, inhaling slightly.

"Industrial alcohol." His voice turned icy.

Evelyn scanned the room, then froze at the ceiling fixtures.

"Wait." She strode to the corner.

The candlesticks weren't filled with wax—but flammable oil.

"They're planning an explosion." The air around Sebastian dropped to subzero.

His jaw clenched, storms brewing in his darkened eyes.

Evelyn's fingers went cold.

If this plot succeeded, the entire tasting event would be destroyed.

Château Blanc's century-old reputation would burn to ashes.

"Someone's targeting us," she murmured.

Sebastian gave a humorless laugh. "Bold move."

Hurried footsteps approached.

"What are you doing here?" Vincent Valdemar panted as he rushed over. "The awards ceremony is starting!"

Beads of sweat dotted his forehead. His eyes darted nervously.

Sebastian studied his uncle through slitted lids, silent and calculating.
###Chapter 300

Sebastian Valdemar spoke calmly, "Uncle Vincent, don't worry. We're just checking some documents and will return soon."

Vincent Valdemar's forehead glistened with sweat, his chest rising and falling rapidly. "I understand young people have their own ideas. But the competition is still ongoing. If Miss Roland is absent too long as a contestant, it might raise eyebrows."

"Understood. We'll head back now." Sebastian gave a slight nod.

His words were half-truths. Rather than fearing outsiders' gossip, Vincent was more curious about what schemes his nephew and Evelyn Roland might be brewing.

After discovering some wine vats had been replaced with industrial alcohol, the two immediately realized someone was sabotaging the tasting event.

With no time to source enough high-quality wine to fill the gap, this flaw could plunge the entire competition into crisis.

On the way back, Vincent couldn't help but smirk at the thought of their helpless expressions.

He was eager to see what tricks Evelyn could possibly pull off to save the situation this time!

The first day's competition concluded amidst undercurrents of tension.

As the winery's partner, Sebastian accompanied Evelyn to arrange guest accommodations at the hotel for the next day.

As night deepened, he noticed her standing alone on the terrace, silently gazing at the distant coastline.

After a moment's hesitation, he approached.

"Don't worry too much about the wine," Sebastian said in a low voice. "Now that we've found the issue, we'll fix it in time. I'll contact some friends tonight to see if we can secure a batch of quality wine for emergency use."

The sea breeze tousled Evelyn's hair. At his words, a faint smile—rare for her typically cool demeanor—touched her lips.

"You're helping me?" She turned to ask.

Sebastian seldom saw any expression on her face besides indifference. Now, her smile glowed vividly in the night, tightening his throat.

"Yeah," he managed stiffly.

Evelyn shook her head lightly. "I've already made arrangements."

She spoke truthfully. While everyone dispersed earlier, she'd immediately contacted an overseas friend who'd arranged for a shipment of premium wine via private jet without hesitation.

Watching her composed demeanor, Sebastian felt inexplicably irritated. This woman always stood alone, never needing anyone's aid.

The realization weighed heavily on his chest.

The next day's tasting event commenced as scheduled.

###Chapter 301

The second day of the competition buzzed with even more energy than the first.

Evelyn Roland arrived two hours early, triple-checking every detail. Only when satisfied did she allow herself a brief moment of relief.

Before the second round began, contestants drew lots to reseat themselves.

Fate played a cruel joke—Evelyn found herself seated beside Dominic Laurent.

As Dominic took his seat, their eyes met briefly. A dark glint flashed in his gaze, his lips curling into a sneer.

Nearly losing to this woman yesterday had been an unbearable humiliation.

Today, he would reclaim his pride.

"Present the wines!"

At the host's command, servers filed in with silver trays.

Evelyn accepted her glass, her peripheral vision catching movement next to her. Her breath hitched.

The server attending Dominic let a fine white powder slip from his fingers into the wineglass.

Someone was drugging the drink!

She opened her mouth to cry out, but the server had already vanished into the crowd.

"Begin tasting!"

Dominic raised his glass, smirking as he tilted it toward his lips.

Evelyn's hand shot out.

Crash!

Crystal shattered against the floor, wine splattering everywhere.

Gasps rippled through the room.

Dominic surged to his feet, his grip like a vise around her wrist. "You coward! Can't handle losing fair and square?"

"Let me explain—"

"Explain?" he snarled. "You just sabotaged me in front of everyone! Host! Disqualify her!"

Judges rushed over.

The host surveyed the mess, his expression stormy. "Miss Roland, this is a blatant violation of competition rules."

"Wait." Evelyn wrenched free.

She snatched a glass shard from the floor—its edge dusted with suspicious white residue.

"This wine was spiked." She held it up to the light. "I saw the server tamper with it."

Dominic's face drained of color.

An elderly judge with silver hair examined the fragment, then barked, "Seal all exits! Find that server!"

Chaos erupted.

Evelyn watched as Dominic's temple gleamed with sweat, his gaze darting nervously.

A chilling realization took root in her mind.
###Chapter 302

"Allow me to explain." Evelyn Roland's voice cut through the noisy venue with clarity. "Mr. Laurent's wine was tainted. Had he consumed it, the consequences would have been dire. Given his prejudice against me, conventional persuasion wouldn't work. I had no choice but to resort to this method."

Dominic Laurent responded with a derisive sneer.

"This is competition-grade wine. What possible issue could there be? At least make your lies believable."

Evelyn calmly removed the silver bracelet from her wrist.

"Pure silver. Feel free to verify."

She knelt and dipped the bracelet into the spilled wine.

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

"Testing for poison with silver? Is this a period drama?"

"Why not bring a silver needle while you're at it?"

Dominic trembled with rage. This woman was mocking them all.

Just as he prepared to lash out, Evelyn rose slowly.

The bracelet's surface had turned pitch black.

Silence gripped the room.

The host paled. Poison at a public event?

Dominic's legs gave out, and he collapsed into his chair.

"It's... actually poisoned?"

Evelyn's gaze was piercing. "Had I not intervened, that wine would be in your stomach by now."

Dominic's throat moved soundlessly. His arrogance evaporated.

His face burned with humiliation.

But far worse was the icy dread creeping up his spine.

Who wanted him dead?

Why choose this moment?

The more he thought, the more terrified he became. His vision darkened, and he fainted.

Evelyn swiftly dialed emergency services.

Sirens wailed as the competition came to an abrupt halt.

While staff cleared the scene, Evelyn discreetly collected samples.

Ross suddenly blocked her path.

"Ms. Roland, I demand an explanation." His eyes were sharp as blades. "A wine tasting turned into a poisoning, following yesterday's incident. You owe me answers."

Evelyn met his gaze.

"Regrettable, indeed. But it's clear someone is systematically targeting Château Blanc—this was a calculated move to sabotage the event. Given your expertise, Mr. Macmillan, I trust you can see that."

Ross's expression darkened.

"Are you implying I lack professionalism if I disagree?"
###Chapter 303

Evelyn Roland's slender fingers gently sealed the sample bottle, her lips curving into a faint smile.

"You misunderstand. We simply wish to minimize the losses caused by the competition's suspension. Any reasonable request will be considered."

Her composed demeanor made Ross Macmillan feel like he was punching cotton.

"You—"

"Two consecutive incidents at the wine tasting championships have severely disrupted my work. What I need now is an explanation, not material compensation!"

Ross suddenly raised his voice. "If I accept your compensation, tomorrow the media will hound me about being bribed, won't they? Just yesterday, I thought you were meticulous. Who knew you were this scheming?"

Scheming?

Evelyn nearly laughed coldly.

Yesterday, he praised the hotel's service for its sophistication. Today, he accused her of being manipulative?

His flip-flopping was truly breathtaking.

She took a deep breath, maintaining her professional smile.

"Since compensation isn't necessary, we'll respect your choice. Once the truth is uncovered, you'll receive a satisfactory resolution."

"No!"

Ross lifted his chin arrogantly, looking down at her.

"With accidents happening repeatedly, you, as the overseer, are undeniably responsible. Both incidents involved you. You must be held accountable!"

Evelyn's sharp instincts caught the implication in his words. She waited silently.

"You will issue a public apology to all contestants and judges!"

"Public apology?"

Her delicate brows furrowed, her elegant features turning icy.

"Yes. A simple matter." Ross waved a dismissive hand.

A glint of steel flashed in Evelyn's eyes.

"I refuse."

"You dare refuse?" Ross gaped, incredulous.

"Demanding an apology before the truth is uncovered is tantamount to shielding the real culprit and pinning the blame entirely on me."

She paused, meeting his gaze squarely.

"Are you trying to make me the scapegoat? Do I look easy to bully?"

"You—"

Caught off guard, Ross flushed crimson.

Nearby judges and contestants who hadn't dispersed yet stopped to watch.

Everyone understood—even without a public apology, with two consecutive incidents tied to Evelyn, she wouldn't escape scrutiny.

Just as Ross was about to explode, the banquet hall doors suddenly swung open.

A squad of armed soldiers marched in, rifles at the ready. The room erupted into chaos.

At their forefront strode a stern-faced officer with commanding presence.

"G-General Roland?"

Ross's expression shifted from shock to fawning so fast it was almost comical.
###Chapter 304

Ross was arrogantly berating Evelyn Roland when he suddenly caught sight of the imposing figure at the doorway.

His pupils constricted sharply.

Wasn't that General Julian Roland from the International Military?

Ross immediately plastered on an obsequious smile and hurried forward. "General Roland, what a pleasant surprise! To what do we owe—"

Before he could finish, Julian strode past him without a glance.

Ross's smile froze.

He turned stiffly, watching as Julian walked straight toward Evelyn.

Wait...

Julian Roland... Evelyn Roland...

A cold sweat drenched Ross's back as realization struck.

Evelyn's tense shoulders finally relaxed at the sight of her brother.

"Julian—"

He raised a hand to silence her. "I already know everything."

Those simple words made Evelyn's nose sting.

The room fell deathly silent.

Everyone held their breath.

Ross forced himself forward, his face twitching. "W-we were just handling Miss Roland's situation—"

Julian finally spared him a glacial glance. "My sister's affairs are none of your concern."

"Of course! Of course!" Ross bobbed his head. "Whatever Miss Roland decides!"

Evelyn stepped forward, her voice cool and measured.

"I'll get to the bottom of this within three days."

Julian took his place beside her, his sharp gaze sweeping the room.

"If anyone dares spread rumors in the meantime..."

The unspoken threat was more effective than any words.

Ross was drowning in regret.

He studied the siblings covertly, scrambling for a way to salvage the situation.

Evelyn caught his expression, a flicker of mockery in her eyes.

This so-called master sommelier was nothing special after all.
###Chapter 305

The air in the hall seemed to freeze as all eyes locked onto the slender figure at the center.

Evelyn Roland walked toward the microphone stand, her high heels clicking with elegant precision.

Her fingers lightly brushed the microphone as a faint smile played at the corners of her lips.

"I'll handle this matter personally."

Her cool voice carried through the venue with undeniable authority, amplified by the sound system.

Bianca Savigny hurried forward and whispered something in her ear. Evelyn gave a slight nod, a sharp glint flashing in her eyes.

The contestants in the audience instinctively shrank back.

Despite her gentle smile, an icy chill ran down their spines.

Sebastian Valdemar stood in the corner, his gaze never leaving her. This was his first time witnessing Evelyn's commanding presence in public.

"Miss Roland, this wine tasting competition concerns the reputation of our entire industry."

Ross suddenly spoke up, his face plastered with a fake smile. He emphasized the word "reputation," but his eyes darted toward Evelyn's brothers.

The room fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

Before Evelyn could respond, two tall figures stepped protectively in front of her.

"Mr. Macmillan seems rather impatient?"

Sebastian's voice was cold as ice.

Julian Roland was more direct: "Shall I remind you to watch your tone?"

Beads of sweat formed on Ross's forehead as he hastily waved his hands. "A misunderstanding! We'll take our leave now."

The crowd scattered like startled birds, leaving only the four of them standing in the empty hall.

"Evelyn..."

Bianca hesitated, words caught in her throat.

Julian reached out to ruffle his sister's hair, his voice instantly softening. "Let me handle this?"

"I want to do it myself."

When Evelyn lifted her gaze, dark currents swirled in her eyes.

"Alright."

Julian gave her hair another gentle tousle, even lighter this time.

Sebastian took a step forward, only to be intercepted.

"An honor to finally meet you, Mr. Valdemar."

Julian extended his hand, his smile not reaching his eyes.

Their handshake was brief, but the air between them crackled with tension.

"My sister and I have family matters to discuss."

The dismissal couldn't have been clearer.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. After a long, lingering look at Evelyn, he finally said, "Goodbye."

Evelyn lightly tugged at her brother's sleeve, her gaze following Sebastian's retreating figure.
###Chapter 306

"Julian, let's go upstairs and rest."

Evelyn spoke softly, her fingers lightly tugging at Julian Roland's sleeve.

The man's stern expression instantly softened when he turned to his sister, the ice in his eyes melting into warmth.

"Mhm."

He glanced back at Sebastian Valdemar, his tone still distant. "Excuse us."

The sight of the siblings walking away side by side burned in Sebastian's vision.

Vincent Valdemar observed everything without a word.

Only when the Roland siblings disappeared around the staircase did he stroll over to his nephew.

"Don't take it personally." Vincent patted Sebastian's shoulder. "It's natural for Julian to be hostile toward you."

"I understand."

Sebastian lowered his gaze, his fingers absently tracing the rim of his teacup.

"Patience is key when pursuing a woman." Vincent smiled kindly. "It's been years since I last visited. Join me for dinner?"

In the private dining room, Vincent casually remarked,

"Julian holds considerable influence in the military, doesn't he?"

"The Grim Reaper." Sebastian offered a terse assessment. "A tactical genius."

A glint flashed in Vincent's eyes. "Yet he's gentle with his sister."

"The Roland brothers are infamous sister-con."

Sebastian's reply made Vincent's lips curve almost imperceptibly.

"Are you acquainted with the third Roland son?"

"No."

The answer clearly pleased Vincent.

"Does Uncle have business with him?"

Sebastian敏锐地察觉到异样.

"Just making conversation." Vincent deftly changed the subject. "The Roland heirs are all exceptional."

The timely arrival of their meal interrupted the undercurrents of their discussion.

"Have a drink with me."

Vincent pushed a glass toward his nephew.

"I'm not feeling well."

Sebastian declined politely, lifting his teacup instead.

Unperturbed, Vincent drained his glass alone.
###Chapter 307

Dawn was breaking when Julian Roland finally allowed his sister to rest.

Evelyn Roland slept deeply, without dreams.

She stretched lazily and reached for her phone on the nightstand.

The screen lit up with dozens of unread messages and missed calls, jolting her awake.

Notifications from WeChat continued to pour in.

Alongside Bianca Savigny's messages, several others from different contacts demanded attention.

Frowning, she opened Bianca's chat and dialed her number.

"What's so urgent?" Her voice still carried traces of sleep.

"Master! It's a disaster!" Bianca's panicked tone cut through the line.

"Get to the point." Evelyn was fully alert now.

"Château Blanc is trending. It's bad."

Hanging up, Evelyn immediately checked the trending list.

#ChâteauBlancFraud
#PoisonedWineAtInternationalCompetition
#ChâteauBlancOwnerFlees
#EmployeesExposeScandal

A string of negative hashtags dominated the top five spots.

Each one struck like an arrow aimed at Château Blanc.

Most alarming was how rapidly the rumors were spreading—clearly orchestrated.

In the main hall of the winery, three figures gathered.

Bianca paced anxiously. "Master, look at these comments!"

[Did someone get hospitalized from their wine?]
[Shut down this unethical business!]
[Faking results at an international competition? How bold!]

"Something's off." Evelyn tapped her phone screen. "This is too calculated."

Julian's voice was icy. "Need me to intervene?"

"Not yet." Her eyes darkened. "Removing the hashtags would only make us look guilty."

Meanwhile, in a secluded villa...

A man swirled his wine glass, satisfied with the trending list.

"The show has only just begun." His smile was sinister.

Bianca's eyes reddened with frustration. "Should we issue a statement?"

"Patience." Evelyn's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Let the bullets fly a little longer."

She loved watching enemies grow overconfident before delivering the final blow.

The intensity of her smile made Bianca's pulse quicken, her ears turning pink.
###Chapter 308 

Julian Roland effortlessly cut off Bianca Savigny's protest.

The Rolands were never pushovers. He understood his sister's temperament—even if he wished to help, he respected her decisions.

Evelyn's lips curved into a sly smile. "You know me so well, brother."

Château Blanc's scandal remained trending for an entire day. From dawn till dusk, curious onlookers waited in vain for an official statement before losing interest.

By bedtime, the buzz finally faded. Bianca's tense nerves relaxed as she drifted into deep slumber.

Without the burden, her complexion visibly improved.

But peace was short-lived. The next morning, a panicked employee intercepted her downstairs.

"Bianca! Our regular customers are here—and they're furious!"

She frowned. "It's only nine. When did they arrive?"

"They stormed in the moment we opened."

This early?

"What should we do?" The employee's eyes reddened with anxiety.

Bianca's expression darkened.

"How many are there?"

"All waiting in the parlor. Quite a crowd."

"Let's go."

The moment she entered, she recognized the familiar faces.

Forcing calm, she greeted them. "What an unexpected pleasure. Here for new selections?"

These were loyal patrons—some even top-tier VIPs.

Instead of courtesy, she received sneers. "New wines? Don't play dumb! We saw everything online!"

"Exactly! Scamming your best customers? Have you no shame?"

A torrent of accusations rained down.

Bianca's knuckles whitened, barely restraining herself.

"Château Blanc operates with integrity. There's been no deception."

She clenched her fists, struggling to maintain composure.

Someone slammed the table. "Enough! I demand a refund!"

"Me too!"

"Return our money!"

The parlor erupted into chaos, spittle flying.

Bianca paled.

"Silence!"

Her temper finally snapped.

These hysterical faces bore no resemblance to the fawning customers they'd once been.

Now they treated Château Blanc like a mortal enemy.

"No refund? We'll expose you! See how you recover then!"

"Bianca?" Staff hurriedly summoned security to restrain the mob.

Shielded behind them, she barked, "Process their returns!"

"But—"

Mass refunds could trigger a chain reaction.

"Now!"
###Chapter 309

"If you insist on canceling your orders, consider our business relationship terminated."

"Suits me just fine."

"Effective immediately, you're all permanently blacklisted from Château Blanc."

A bespectacled man in the crowd protested, "It's just a canceled order. Must you be so extreme? Business requires flexibility—"

Bianca Savigny slammed her palms on the table, sending glasses clinking.

"You abandon us at the first sign of trouble? Think we can't survive without you fair-weather friends?"

Her body swayed slightly, but her gaze remained razor-sharp.

"You—!"

The gathered tycoons turned ashen. One crushed his wineglass in his fist.

"Ungrateful wretch!"

"Escort them out!"

Security personnel ushered the crowd out like unruly chickens.

"Mark my words! Your vineyard won't last the month!"

"Get out!"

Bianca's roar made the chandelier tremble.

......

The cellar was damp and chilled.

Bianca slumped against an oak barrel, fingers trembling uncontrollably.

Her assistant Jessica crouched nearby, phone light casting ghastly shadows across her pale face.

"Bianca... the inventory..."

The postponed International Wine Tasting Championship had shattered their reputation. The entire staff was running on fumes.

"Today's online sales?"

"Zero." Jessica hesitated. "And the official account's comments..."

The vitriol was too vile to repeat.

"I see."

Bianca waved her off, bloodshot eyes silencing any comfort.

Once the cellar door shut, she finally checked her phone. Seven missed calls plunged her heart into icy depths.

"Master... something must be wrong..."

Her mind flashed to Evelyn Roland besieged by reporters. Cold sweat drenched her back.

As she grabbed her coat to rush out, the phone rang.

"Master! Are you alright?"

"What happened?"

Evelyn's voice remained steady but taut with tension.

Hearing that familiar tone shattered Bianca's composure. Through choked sobs, she recounted the disaster. Dead silence answered her.

......

The pen snapped in Evelyn's grip.

Ink stained her pale fingers like blood.

Thirty minutes later, when the black-clad figure appeared at the vineyard gates, every employee's eyes glistened.

"Master..."

Bianca's attempt at a smile looked more like a grimace.

Evelyn pinched her icy cheek. "Don't force it."

Those words broke the last dam. Tears flooded down as Bianca clutched her mentor's sleeve like a lost child.

"Show me the cellar first."

Evelyn's quiet command instantly steadied them all.
###Chapter 310

Evelyn grasped Bianca's trembling wrist. "Stay calm."

Bianca bit her lip and nodded, trailing behind Evelyn like a startled rabbit.

"Thank goodness Ms. Roland is here."

The staff exchanged glances before quietly returning to their posts.

Whenever Evelyn was present, even the fiercest storm could be calmed—this was the unspoken understanding among all employees at Château Blanc.

They stayed not just for the generous salaries, but for the radiant presence of their young leader.

Inside the wine cellar, returned crates of red wine towered like mountains.

"All returned this morning."

"I see."

Evelyn's gaze flickered as her fingertips traced the edges of a wooden crate, methodically counting.

"Expect more returns in the coming days. Accept every single one."

"But they're the ones breaching the contract—"

"Do it."

Her two words carried finality.

"Restock these."

She shrugged off her blazer and rolled up her sleeves.

Throughout it all, her expression remained as still as deep water.

Bianca watched her mentor's efficient movements, throat tightening.

"Evelyn..." Her voice wavered. "You don’t have to push yourself like this."

The Roland heiress should have been spoiled and willful, yet this woman before her was stubborn to the point of heartache.

Evelyn didn’t turn. "Work."

Bianca opened her mouth, then sighed.

"Alright."

She knelt to organize the crates.

After twenty minutes of silent labor, the cellar door swung open.

Three pairs of eyes met in the dim light.

Sebastian Valdemar stood at the entrance, phone in hand, his tailored suit unable to mask the tension in his brow.

Bianca immediately averted her gaze.

His purpose here needed no explanation.

Evelyn's eyes lingered on him briefly before looking away.

Sebastian strode forward, his gaze tracing the flush on her cheeks down to her wood-dusted fingertips.

The high ponytail couldn’t hide the sweat at her temples. Though her aura remained sharp, the faint crease between her eyebrows betrayed her.

Without a word, he extended a thermos. "Take a break."

His tone was cool yet unyielding.

"Unnecessary."

"Ms. Roland," he stepped closer, "as a business partner, I have the right to be involved in château affairs."

Behind his glasses, his eyes gleamed with intensity.

Evelyn pressed her lips together and moved aside.

"Ms. Savigny should rest too."

Startled at being addressed, Bianca nearly knocked over a bottle.

"I'll handle this." Sebastian undid his cufflinks. "Go get some sleep."

Bianca stole a glance between them, curiosity burning.

"Wipe your sweat." Evelyn suddenly shoved a tissue at her, eyes warning.

Flustered, Bianca ducked her head, pretending to dab at nonexistent perspiration.
###Chapter 311

Sebastian's slender fingers gracefully twirled the wine bottle. His black dress shirt accentuated his perfect waistline. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a soft glow around him.

Bianca chewed on her straw, her eyes darting between her mentor and Sebastian. A knowing smile played on her lips, but she wisely kept silent.

"Bianca."

Evelyn's voice floated over, light as a feather, yet it made Bianca stiffen instantly.

"Sorry, Mentor!" She clasped her hands together, blinking her large eyes in feigned innocence. "I was just thinking—"

Before she could finish, a muffled cough interrupted her.

Evelyn shoved a water bottle into Bianca's hands and strode toward Sebastian. She unscrewed the cap and pressed it to his lips, her other hand already finding his pulse.

"Stop pushing yourself," she said coolly. "Let the waitstaff handle this."

A faint flush crept across Sebastian's pale face. He tried to speak, but another coughing fit seized him.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. Without hesitation, she reached out and undid the top button of his shirt. Sebastian's pupils contracted, his Adam's apple bobbing involuntarily.

"Don't overthink it." Her fingers pressed firmly against specific pressure points. "I'm teaching you how to stop coughing."

The light in Sebastian's eyes dimmed. How he longed to seize that hand and tell her she was welcome to overthink it.

"Got it?" Evelyn withdrew her hand.

"Could you... demonstrate again?" His voice was rough.

"Bianca, come here."

The girl, who had been watching with rapt attention, nearly choked on her juice. She scrambled to wipe her mouth. "M-Mentor?"

"Be my model."

Bianca rolled her eyes discreetly. Her mentor was truly oblivious—Sebastian might as well have "flirt with me" written across his forehead.

"Wipe that nosy look off your face," Evelyn said flatly.

Bianca hastily covered her mouth, but the mischievous glint in her eyes remained.
###Chapter 312

Qiao Bolin straightened up casually, giving Lu Yao a slight nod before taking Yao Jing's hand and leading her into the elevator.

Yao Jing's ears burned with embarrassment. She sighed inwardly—she still had a long way to go in mastering her composure.

"Are you two heading out?" Lu Yao blinked her doe-like eyes innocently.

Yao Jing replied politely, "Yes, we're going to dinner."

Lu Yao clapped her hands excitedly. "What a coincidence! I just finished my livestream and was thinking of trying that new French restaurant nearby. Why don't we go together?"

Before Yao Jing could formulate a gentle refusal, Qiao Bolin cut in bluntly, "Sorry, but tonight is reserved for a private date with my girlfriend."

Lu Yao's smile froze, her ears turning crimson with humiliation. "Oh... my bad."

Once they stepped out of the elevator, Yao Jing tugged lightly at Qiao Bolin's sleeve. "That was too harsh."

He scoffed. "An invitation like that was either calculated or clueless. Either way, she needed the lesson."

Yao Jing nodded thoughtfully. "Fair point."

"Can't you show a little more possessiveness over me?" Qiao Bolin suddenly pinned her against the car door, his gaze intense. "Next time, I want you to stake your claim first."

She arched a brow, amused. "With your level of self-awareness, do I even need to?"

"Did I pass today's test?" His voice dropped lower.

Yao Jing's eyes glimmered. "Barely."

"Then I deserve a reward." Before she could react, he captured her lips, picking up where they'd left off in the elevator.

People moved through the parking garage, making Yao Jing tense. "Let's... eat first."

"And after dinner?" He nuzzled her cheek with his nose.

She suddenly nipped his lower lip, a sly glint in her eyes. "Your call."

Qiao Bolin's breath hitched. "How about we head home now?"

"Dream on." She slipped out of his arms effortlessly, straightening her collar. "I'm hungry."

Yao Jing had completely given up on Tian Xiaotian, not even bothering to ask about her anymore.

Occasionally, Shangguan Xia would mention, "They're still giving each other the silent treatment. Is Tian Xiaotian out of her mind? Even if something did happen, she should be mad at Chen Jihao, not you!"

Yao Jing couldn't be bothered to comment. Some people were easier to deal with once you saw them clearly.

That Friday afternoon, Shangguan Xia called. "Shao Si is back. He's organizing a class reunion."

"He came back early for a visit?" Yao Jing was surprised. This high school classmate had settled in the capital after graduation and rarely returned.

"He said it's for work. Weird that he didn't reach out to you separately." Shangguan Xia chuckled meaningfully. "Afraid you'll spill his secrets?"

Yao Jing snorted. "Now I have to go."

"Professor Chen will be there too. Don't be late."

"I'll head over after work." Yao Jing checked her schedule. "Give him my regards."
###Chapter 313

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting golden patterns on the wooden floor of Château Blanc's elegant pavilion.

Bianca Savigny pushed open the door and nearly dropped the wine bottle in her hand.

"Master?"

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

Evelyn Roland stood before the mirror, adjusting the hem of her new emerald-green gown that accentuated her slender waist.

"Did you bring the wine?"

Bianca snapped out of her daze and hurriedly placed the bottle on the coffee table.

"Master, why are you..."

"Try this on." Evelyn gestured to a paper bag on the sofa.

Bianca opened it to find a soft pink dress inside.

"For me?"

She looked up excitedly, only to see Evelyn already tapping on her phone.

"Master, are you going live?"

Bianca peeked at the screen and nearly bit her tongue when she saw the livestream interface.

"Hmm."

Evelyn didn't glance up, her fingers moving deftly across the screen.

Clutching the dress, Bianca hesitated, sensing something unusual.

"Go change."

The command snapped her back to reality, and she rushed to the dressing room.

The livestream suddenly flooded with viewers.

[User9527 entered the stream]
[GossipLover entered the stream]
[TruthSeeker20 entered the stream]

Comments exploded instantly.

"Is this the influencer who seduced the movie star?"
"Meh, she's average-looking."
"I heard her wine is fake."

Bianca emerged just in time to see the barrage of hateful remarks.

"Master! These people—"

"Quiet."

Evelyn raised a hand, her lips curving into a faint smile.

She turned on the microphone with effortless grace.

"Welcome to Château Blanc."

Her voice was as cool as a mountain spring.

The comments froze for a second before surging even more violently.

"Who does she think she is?"
"Explain your relationship with the actor!"

Bianca stomped her foot in frustration, but Evelyn calmly picked up the wine bottle.

"Today, we'll be tasting a very special vintage."

Her slender fingers rotated the bottle, making the amber liquid glimmer seductively in the sunlight.

The viewer count had already surpassed five thousand.

Just then, the pavilion door burst open.
###Chapter 314 

Bianca Savigny's knuckles turned white from clenching her fists, while Evelyn Roland swirled her wine glass with effortless poise.

The live chat flooded in like a tidal wave. A glint of amusement flashed in her eyes.

"One point two million viewers already?"

Only eight minutes into the broadcast, and the numbers had skyrocketed.

[Front row check-in! Is this the stunning CEO of Château Blanc?]
[Queen behavior! That aura is lethal!]
[How dare she go live after the poisoning scandal? Talk about nerves of steel.]
[Shut up! Nothing's been proven yet.]
[Poisoned wine and she's still flaunting it?]
[Authorities should shut that place down.]
[Rich people logic—celebrating tainted wine.]

Evelyn took a measured sip, crimson lips curling into a dangerous smile.

"A century-old legacy like Château Blanc won't be toppled by a few rabid dogs." The amber liquid caught the light as she tilted her glass. "The real culprit must be watching this right now."

The chat exploded.

[Holy shit! Plot twist incoming?]
[Yaaas queen! Slay!]
[Where's the proof though?]

Bianca raised her glass on cue. The crystal clink resonated through the mics.

"Our lawyers have drafted the paperwork." Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Certain individuals should expect court summons soon."

[So it was sabotage all along?]
[I knew Château Blanc would never risk their reputation!]
[Bet those who canceled orders are kicking themselves now.]
[Popcorn ready for the reckoning.]

Off-screen, several longtime clients paled.

Their trembling fingers reopened that anonymous text—the one that had made them sever ties with Château Blanc in panic. Cold sweat drenched their shirts.

"We're finished..."

One collapsed onto his leather sofa, expensive wine pooling on the floor like blood.

No amount of groveling would get them past Château Blanc's gates now.
###Chapter 315

The live stream chat exploded with a flurry of pink hearts and playful innuendos.

Bianca Savigny stole a glance at her phone, fingers fidgeting beneath the table. She longed to join the digital revelry, but one look at her mentor's stern profile made her shrink back.

"Bianca Savigny!"

The full-name summons sent a jolt down her spine.

Her head snapped up, meeting Evelyn Roland's icy gaze. Instantly, she ducked her chin like a startled rabbit.

"Miss Roland," Sebastian Valdemar's baritone voice flowed like cello notes, fingers grazing his lips with calculated slowness, "lovely weather today. Care for a stroll?"

"No—"

"Sir," Theodore Ashcroft interjected, sweat beading down his neck, "the board has requested your presence three times already. The New York flight departs tonight."

Sebastian's knuckles rapped the table once. The temperature in the room plummeted.

"Go." Evelyn didn't lift her eyes from her equipment.

"Call me if you need anything." He rose, his tailored slacks lingering in the camera frame for ten deliberate seconds before striding away.

The twenty-minute walk from Château Blanc to the parking lot set a new record.

Theodore trembled as he opened the Maybach's door, barely breathing.

Arctic silence filled the cabin.

"Drive."

Sebastian loosened his tie, all warmth erased from his expression.

"Yes, sir!"

"Next time," he adjusted a cufflink idly, "collect your termination papers from HR."

Theodore's shirt clung to his drenched back.

Viewership plummeted as the black luxury car disappeared. Yet stubborn comments flooded the screen:

[OMG did you see Sebastian's parting glare?!]

[This ship is CANON!]

Evelyn adjusted her equipment with unflinching precision, keystrokes ringing like chimes.

"Bianca," she said suddenly, "Mr. Valdemar's cardiac condition can't handle emotional extremes."

Bianca stuck out her tongue. "Got it, Master."
###Chapter 316

Bianca Savigny stared at the live stream screen, her fingers twisting nervously. She leaned closer to Evelyn Roland and whispered, "Master, are we just going to sit here?"

"Isn't the live stream already happening?"

Evelyn chuckled at her disciple's pouting face. She reached out and ruffled Bianca's hair. "Relax. Just watch."

"Mm..."

Bianca hesitated, her gaze lingering on the wine glass in Evelyn's hand. "Master, that wine is strong. You should drink less."

Evelyn smiled and nodded, but still raised her glass to clink lightly against Bianca's.

In the live stream, the audience watched the two elegant women savoring their wine, and the comments section exploded.

"Master, if this batch of wine hadn't been returned, I wouldn't have gotten to taste it."

Bianca's words were like a knife, stabbing straight into someone's heart. Off-screen, the customer who had returned the wine clenched his fists, nails digging into his palms.

That was his wine!

A rare vintage he'd spent a fortune and pulled countless strings to acquire—and he hadn't even gotten to open a single bottle...

[OMG, I'm actually craving wine now! I never drink, but suddenly I want some!]

[Is Château Blanc's wine really as legendary as they say? Someone explain!]

[Wine connoisseur here: Château Blanc's wines are famous for their lingering finish and complex aromas. The most unique part? Every label and bottle is one-of-a-kind.]

[Are these paid actors?]

[I'm the idiot who returned that wine! That bottle was supposed to be mine!]

The comments grew increasingly heated until someone dropped a bombshell: [Check my verified account *** on Twitter! If I'm lying, may I never earn another cent!]

The drama drew even more viewers, who began researching Château Blanc's unique features. The bottles changed colors under light, and each one hid a secret—a special set of engraved initials.

Evelyn turned the bottle toward the camera at just the right moment.

"Bianca, show them."

Understanding, Bianca held up the half-empty bottle. The crystal glass shimmered with amber hues under the light, revealing the raised letters clearly.

Evelyn then handed her the cork. "Even the cork has a mark."

The audience gasped. The edge bore a tiny "C," and the bottom held two more letters: "Q."

"That's my master's personal signature," Bianca explained. "Everything she designs carries this watermark."

What had once been an offhand gesture now served as irrefutable proof. When Evelyn first took over the winery, she'd casually signed her initials in the corner of a sketch—never imagining it would become today's anti-counterfeit seal.

The live chat erupted.

[Holy crap! Even the cork is this detailed!]
[This level of craftsmanship is insane!]
[No wonder it's so expensive—worth every penny!]

Even longtime customers were stunned. They'd tasted countless wines but had never noticed this hidden touch of artistry.

As praise flooded the screen, Bianca exhaled in relief and winked at her master.

Evelyn swirled her wine glass, a knowing smile playing on her lips.

This show was only just beginning.
###Chapter 317 

Evelyn Roland suddenly disappeared from the camera frame.

The live chat exploded instantly, with comments flooding the screen as fans begged for her return.

When she reappeared, a gilded folder was in her hand.

"For you." Evelyn handed the file to Bianca Savigny, a mysterious smile playing at the corners of her lips.

Bianca took it, eyeing her mentor with suspicion.

"Open it. There's a surprise inside."

Bianca's fingers trembled slightly as she slowly flipped through the pages.

Her pupils dilated the moment she saw the contents, her expression shifting from shock to sheer delight.

"Mentor! When did you prepare this?"

Her voice shook as her fingers clutched the edges of the document.

"I had the tests done that same day. The results only came in yesterday." Evelyn spoke casually, her crimson lips curving into a mesmerizing smile.

Bianca's eyes glistened with unshed tears, reflecting Evelyn's confident figure.

"You're incredible!"

The genuine praise made Evelyn arch a brow, a flicker of pride flashing in her gaze.

"So today's shopping trip... was really just for relaxation?" Bianca asked cautiously.

"Wasn't it obvious?"

"I thought..." Bianca's face flushed crimson.

Evelyn let out a soft humph and elegantly settled back onto the sofa. "Stop overthinking things."

"I'll punish myself!" Bianca hastily grabbed her wineglass and downed half of it in one gulp.

Their lighthearted banter completely ignored the frantic audience in the live chat.

Comments were now flying too fast to read:

[What's in that file?! I'm dying to know!]

[Please tell us!]

[If you don't reveal it soon, I'm smashing my phone!]

Evelyn glanced at the screen and tilted her chin slightly.

"Show them."

Bianca immediately stood and held the document up to the camera.

The chat froze as everyone held their breath, eyes glued to their screens.

Several former clients who had switched sides paled instantly upon seeing the contents.

"This is brutal..."

They finally understood Evelyn's plan—not only proving the winery's innocence but also humiliating them in the process.

"These are the test results from the International Wine Tasting Championship and the recent returned batches. 

They'll be posted on our official account shortly." Evelyn's tone was calm.

Bianca gazed at her mentor's composed profile, admiration shining in her eyes.

Despite being close in age, Evelyn always carried herself with such effortless poise.

"Is the livestream ending?" Bianca whispered.

"Not yet." Evelyn smiled mysteriously. "The show has just begun."

###Chapter 318

The livestream audience held their breath, with the barrage of comments dwindling to a trickle.

Evelyn Roland's wine glass refracted a mesmerizing glow under the lights as her lips curved into a faint smirk.

[What the hell is happening?!]

[This plot twist hit faster than a tornado!]

[So there's more to that wine-tasting competition scandal?]

Bianca Savigny inched closer to the screen, her eyes wide with disbelief.

Dominic Laurent cleared his throat, his voice trembling slightly. "If Miss Roland hadn't intervened that day, I might've..."

He left the sentence unfinished, but everyone understood.

The chat exploded instantly.

[Wait—so Evelyn saved him?!]

[Where are all those trolls who accused Château Blanc of poisoning people? Show yourselves!]

Evelyn tapped the table with her fingertips, her rhythm unhurried.

"You flatter me, Mr. Laurent." She lifted her gaze to the camera. "It was nothing."

Dominic suddenly stood and bowed deeply toward the lens.

"I came today specifically to thank you." He pulled out a document. "This is the hospital report proving someone tampered with my drink that day."

The livestream erupted.

[Bombshell revelation!]

[I knew Evelyn was framed!]

Bianca gripped the back of her chair, her cheeks flushed with excitement.

Yet Evelyn remained composed, as if she'd anticipated this all along.

She swirled her glass, the crimson liquid spiraling inside.

"There's no need for this, Mr. Laurent." Her voice was cool. "The truth always comes to light."

Comments flooded the screen as viewer numbers skyrocketed.

[This is more intense than a drama series!]

[So who's behind the plot against Château Blanc?]

Dominic wiped his brow, about to speak—

The screen went black.

Three seconds later, the feed restored.

Evelyn's red lips curled into a dangerous smile.

"Seems someone's getting nervous."
###Chapter 319

Evelyn Roland tapped the rim of her wineglass with a manicured finger, producing a crystalline chime. "You flatter me, Mr. Laurent. That misunderstanding will be resolved soon. Why not visit Château Blanc another day? I'll mix you a cocktail myself."

Her gaze lifted, eyes shimmering with calculated allure.

Dominic Laurent instantly replied in the live chat: "I'll hold you to that promise, Ms. Roland. I look forward to tasting your craftsmanship."

The tension between them dissolved like morning mist.

"Regarding those online rumors," Dominic's voice turned grave, "I believe Château Blanc will silence all doubts with excellence. A filthy mind sees filth everywhere."

He deliberately left this parting shot before ending the livestream connection.

The chat exploded. Everyone knew Dominic's notorious stubbornness—his public defense of Evelyn signaled undeniable admiration.

[Château Blanc is legendary!]
[World-class wineries operate on another level!]

The comment section's sentiment flipped instantly. Then the screen erupted in a supernova of digital stardust.

[VIP Dominic gifted Château Blanc's livestream a Meteor Shower!]

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, lips curving in satisfaction.

[OMG! My first time seeing this gift effect!]
[The hostess is incredible! So jealous!]

Before the frenzy subsided, another system chime rang out.

[User X gifted two Meteor Showers.]

[Two?! Who's this mystery tycoon?]
[That's $10K just like that!]

As comments scrolled wildly, a bold notification sliced through the chaos.

[VIP user Julian Roland has entered the livestream.]

Evelyn instantly recognized the ID. Only her brother Julian would use such an unsubtle pseudonym.

Without preamble, Julian unleashed ten Carnival gifts, flooding the screen with golden animations.

[What celestial event is happening today?!]
[Are all these magnates Ms. Roland's connections?]

Evelyn blinked at the camera, signaling Bianca Savigny to end the broadcast.

"Thank you for your support today. Until next time."
###Chapter 320

The live chat exploded instantly.

"Don't end it now! It's barely been any time!"

"Please, just a little longer! I haven't had enough!"

"Don't go, streamer! I'll send gifts right now!"

"I was blind before—I apologize to Château Blanc!"

Pleas and apologies flooded the screen in a frantic scroll. But Evelyn Roland had already risen smoothly to her feet.

Bianca Savigny, who'd been ready to chat more, quickly caught on. "Thank you all for your support! That's all for today's stream!"

She jogged after Evelyn, eyes sparkling. "Master, we won!"

The pieces finally clicked for Bianca. From the lab reports to the live demonstration, even Dominic Laurent's sudden appearance—every move had been perfectly calculated.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "We won together."

"The numbers are insane!" Bianca waved her tablet excitedly, nearly dancing.

Evelyn glanced at the data and gave her shoulder a light pat. "Go rest. Your dark circles could touch the floor."

The stress had taken its toll. Even Bianca's usually vibrant eyes had dulled.

"You should rest too, Master." For once, Bianca didn't cling. She kicked off her shoes and flopped onto the sofa.

"Ahhh! We did it!"

Thankfully, the penthouse had soundproofing. Otherwise, her shrieks would've summoned security.

Bianca bolted upright and grabbed her phone.

"Château Blanc" now topped the trending list.

The official account's comments were buried under purchase requests. The hateful remarks had vanished without a trace.

Meanwhile, in a luxury villa, a man smashed his wineglass against the wall.

"Flood the platforms with trolls! Buy more bots! Mask the IPs!"

But it was too late.

The storm around "Château Blanc" had already taken over every platform—Instagram, Twitter, Reddit—all of them.

"Useless! Can't even handle one woman!" His bloodshot eyes burned with rage.

His subordinates cowered. "We never expected her to go live..."

"Get out!"

Once alone, the man's lips twisted into a chilling smile. "Interesting... Miss Roland of the Roland family. It's been a while since I've had such a worthy opponent."

His laughter echoed through the empty hall, sending shivers down the spine.
###Chapter 321

The man stared at the wreckage strewn across the floor, his lips pressed into a thin line. A predatory glint flickered in his eyes, like a beast that had finally caught the scent of its prey after lying in wait for too long.

"Evelyn Roland, you'd better stay alive." He ran his tongue over his molars. "Who else would entertain me?"

"Achoo—"

"Achoo!"

Evelyn sneezed twice the moment she stepped into the villa. Rubbing the tip of her nose, a cold glint flashed in her eyes.

"Seems someone's thinking about me."

She pulled out her phone, her fingers gliding over the screen. The trending list was flooded with news about Château Blanc. After a quick glance, she locked the screen.

The doorbell rang abruptly.

The surveillance feed showed Julian Roland standing at the entrance.

"Second Brother." She opened the door.

Julian's gaze softened as he raised his hand to pinch her cheek, but he paused mid-air. Glancing at his rough palm, he retracted it casually.

"That's my sister for you." He smiled.

"Business?" Evelyn cut straight to the point.

Julian produced several velvet boxes like a magician. The dazzling jewels shimmered under the light.

"From Alexander. He's been swamped lately."

"Thank Third Brother for me."

Evelyn's expression remained indifferent, as if the treasures before her were cheap trinkets.

Her phone buzzed.

A transfer notification from Alexander popped up, followed by eight zeros.

"Alexander is still as stingy as ever." Julian scoffed and tapped his screen twice.

Evelyn's phone chimed again.

This time, nine zeros.

"Second Brother!" She massaged her temples in exasperation.

Julian pulled out a long case like it was a magic trick. Inside lay a customized pistol resting on velvet.

"This..."

"Your legal permit is already processed." Julian pressed down on her hesitant hand. "But promise me—only in life-or-death situations."

Evelyn's eyes lit up as she ran her fingers over the weapon with reverence. "Thank you, Second Brother."

"One more thing."

Julian handed her a flash drive. Evelyn plugged it into her laptop, her fingers flying across the keyboard. A grainy surveillance video began to play.

###Chapter 322
The blue glow of the computer screen cast shadows across Evelyn Roland's face, deepening the intensity in her eyes.

"Take a close look at the surveillance footage from competition day."

She lounged carelessly on the leather sofa, twirling a pen between her slender fingers.

Julian Roland accepted the tablet, his lips curling into a faint smirk.

The footage was shaky, captured from an awkward angle.

Blurred figures moved through the corridors of Château Blanc, the camera jerking unpredictably.

"Wait."

Evelyn suddenly sat upright, the pen clattering onto the coffee table.

Her finger stabbed at the lower right corner of the screen.

"That man."

She'd missed it during her first viewing, but now the anomaly stood out.

Not the face—but the distinct cut of that tailored suit.

She remembered it clearly. Vincent Valdemar had worn that exact outfit that day.

"Julian, do you recognize him?"

Evelyn tilted her head, fingertips drumming lightly on the table.

Her brother's gaze turned glacial.

"The third Valdemar heir."

The air thickened instantly.

Evelyn zoomed in. Pixelation blurred the image, but the identification was unmistakable.

"Just as I thought."

A derisive snort escaped her, cold fury flashing in her eyes.

Julian's knuckles cracked audibly.

The arrogant message left at the winery resurfaced in his memory.

"Suicidal."

The word hissed through his clenched teeth.

Every military officer knew how terrifying Julian Roland became when provoked.

Clearly, Vincent Valdemar didn't.

"Fascinating."

Evelyn replayed the video for confirmation.

When she turned, she noticed her brother's unsettling stillness.

"Julian."

She unwrapped a peppermint candy and pressed it between his lips.

"Don't dirty your hands. I'll handle this."

Sweetness spread across Julian's tongue. The tension in his shoulders eased slightly.

"Fine."

His eyes remained locked on the screen as he crushed the candy between his teeth.

"Make sure he never leaves this city."
###Chapter 323

"I adore both gifts, Julian."

Evelyn Roland toyed with the exquisite gift box, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Julian Roland's eyes softened as he ruffled her hair. "Since when do you stand on ceremony with me? Rest now. I'll handle the rest."

His gaze lingered on her tired expression. "You look exhausted."

Evelyn shot an exasperated glance at Bianca Savigny beside her.

The dark circles were clearly on Bianca's face.

"Be good."

Faced with her overprotective brother, she felt both touched and helpless.

"Julian, I want to deal with this personally." Her fingers tapped the table, eyes sharp. "They came after me. I won't be satisfied until I handle it myself."

"Is this about Sebastian?" Julian's brow furrowed, voice turning icy.

Just hearing that name made his entire body tense with disapproval.

The way that man looked at Evelyn—he knew exactly what it meant.

"Julian!" Evelyn's wrist twisted, jawline tightening. "I just want to punch some scumbags, that's all!"

"Really?"

"Absolutely."

Julian studied her intently, his silent warning clear. "Remember your words."

"Call me if you need backup."

"Got it." She nodded obediently.

A black sedan had been waiting outside when they stepped out.

"Go ahead, you'll be late."

Only when the car disappeared did she exhale deeply.

A doting brother's affection could sometimes be... overwhelming.

Still, she owed him this time. Without Julian, the leads wouldn't have surfaced so quickly.

"Time to close the net."

A cold smile curled her lips, eyes glinting dangerously.

Back in the living room, she sank into the sofa, replaying the video footage.

"Sebastian Valdemar... what will you choose?"

Her heart gave an odd flutter at the thought of his pale face.

"Since when did you become so indecisive, Evelyn Roland?"

Shaking her head with self-mockery, she yanked out the USB drive and grabbed her purse.

Château Blanc.

"Good afternoon, Madame!"

A gardener hastily removed his hat in greeting.

"Stay hydrated in this heat."

She nodded courteously, her gaze sweeping over the sun-scorched flowerbeds.

As she walked down the corridor, she missed the gardener's thoughtful stare.

The main hall blazed with light.
###Chapter 324

Bianca Savigny stretched lazily, nearly colliding with a figure as she pushed open her door.

"Master Evelyn?" Her eyes widened in surprise. "I thought you were taking a few days off."

Evelyn Roland's expression was darker than the night outside.

"Come with me."

Bianca hurried to keep up with her master's brisk pace.

......

The computer screen flickered to life, playing a grainy video.

"Notice anything?" Evelyn tapped the desk lightly.

Bianca leaned closer. "That silhouette..." She gasped. "It's someone from Sebastian Valdemar's inner circle!"

"Correct." A glint of approval flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "Dig into Sebastian's recent contacts."

Vincent Valdemar had just returned to the country—too new to act alone.

"You suspect..." Bianca's voice dropped.

"There might be a mole." Evelyn's tone was icy.

Bianca sprang into action. By afternoon, she'd combed through every employee file at Château Blanc.

"Found something." She rushed back, breathless. "The new bartender is suspicious."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Keep him under surveillance."

"What about Vincent?" Bianca handed over a dossier.

"Too clean." Evelyn flipped through the call logs. "Suspiciously clean."

In the surveillance room, the pair stared at the screens for three straight hours.

"Damn it." Bianca rubbed her aching eyes. "Did this guy turn invisible?"

"Bring that waiter in." Evelyn suddenly stood.

The video's distorted audio was a tangled mess—even tech support couldn't decipher it.

Bianca dashed out, only to return pale-faced moments later.

"Master..." Her voice trembled. "He's gone."

The last lead had vanished.
###Chapter 325

Evelyn Roland abruptly stood from her seat, fingers tapping lightly on the desk.

Bianca Savigny bit her lower lip. "No one saw anything. It's like they vanished into thin air."

The only lead had snapped.

Bianca's face paled as she twisted her fingers together. "Master, it's all my fault—"

"Not your doing," Evelyn cut her off. "This was clearly deliberate."

Whoever was behind this was both ruthless and meticulous.

"Pull up the surveillance footage."

Evelyn's movement sent a gust of wind through the room, her tall frame radiating undeniable authority.

Five minutes later.

The air in the surveillance room turned glacial.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, jaw tightening. She exhaled slowly, pressing her tongue against her cheek.

"Master..." Bianca's voice trembled.

"Just deleted footage." Evelyn suddenly smirked, fingers flying across the keyboard. "No big deal."

Bianca held her breath, not daring to blink.

"Done."

"Master!" Tears welled up instantly as Bianca lunged forward to hug her.

"What's with the waterworks?" Evelyn sidestepped the embrace.

"I'm just so happy!" Bianca wiped her tears, then blurted, "Master, I hate that I'm not a man."

Evelyn flicked her forehead. "Gender reassignment surgery exists."

"Master~" Bianca immediately cooed, leaning in.

Evelyn shook her head in exasperation.

Now relaxed, Bianca sighed dramatically. "Master, what man wouldn't fall for someone like you?"

"..."

"I wonder who could ever be worthy of you." Bianca batted her lashes. "Like Sebastian—"

"Focus on the case," Evelyn snapped coldly.

Bianca stuck out her tongue, then suddenly pointed at the screen. "Master, look! There they are!"
###Chapter 326

Bianca Savigny twisted her fingers nervously, trying to change the subject. Evelyn Roland's gaze swept over her in silence.

The surveillance footage was unnervingly clear.

When Evelyn first took over Château Blanc, she spared no expense upgrading the entire security system. Now, every minute detail was captured in high definition.

The timestamp read 6:03 AM.

A man in gray athletic wear appeared on screen, his headphone cord swaying with each step.

"That's him."

Bianca bit her lower lip. She had personally interviewed this waiter. Her mentor had even teased her for being swayed by his looks.

"But his behavior is too normal."

The man jogged leisurely around the vineyard, completely unbothered by the cameras. His relaxed expression and natural movements showed no trace of ulterior motives.

Fast-forwarding revealed only two appearances—his morning run and later leaving the staff dormitory in uniform.

"Impossible!"

Bianca shot to her feet. How could someone vanish into thin air?

"Play it again."

She forced herself to focus, reviewing the footage three more times until her fingertips trembled.

The trail had gone cold.

The waiter had evaporated without a trace.

A chill crawled up her spine, making her shiver.

"Mentor, something's wrong here."

"Hmm."

"Could it be connected to the poisoned wine incident?"

"Yes."

Evelyn's reply was absolute.

Bianca's eyes lit up. "Did you find something?"

"What do you know about Sebastian Valdemar's uncle?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. Vincent Valdemar had lived abroad for years. His sudden return coincided perfectly with the wine competition.

Too perfectly.

Poisoned wine. A missing employee. Vincent's appearance. These weren't coincidences.

Why had the man shown her such unusual kindness? How had he become a judge? Why had even Sebastian been unaware of his travel plans?

Questions exploded in Evelyn's mind as her fingers clenched unconsciously.

"Mentor?"

Bianca worriedly clung to her arm.

"It's nothing."

Evelyn let her protégé lean against her while staring into the distance. "Did you fully vet that employee's background? Any ties to the Valdemars?"

"I checked his records. Orphaned, from out of town. No possible connection to them..."

"Interesting."

Evelyn's smile turned icy. Of all Château Blanc's staff, why had Vincent Valdemar chosen this one?
###Chapter 327

A bolt of lightning split the sky.

Inside the room, the mentor and apprentice sitting across from each other simultaneously looked up toward the window.

The sky darkened abruptly, thick as ink.

Heavy storm clouds hung oppressively low, as if they might collapse at any moment. A fierce wind whipped up fallen leaves, the temperature plummeted, and the swirling black clouds overhead promised a torrential downpour.

"Boom—"

The thunderclap was deafening.

Lightning illuminated the entire sky, its blinding white light forcing eyes shut.

Bianca Savigny shuddered, her fingers unconsciously clutching the hem of her dress.

Evelyn Roland's gaze darkened.

She stared at the pouring rain outside, her thoughts turbulent. How should she broach the subject of that video with Sebastian Valdemar? Once the investigation began, it would inevitably alert him.

"Master," Bianca suddenly spoke, "we should tell Mr. Valdemar. Even though he isn't the direct victim, he's been dragged into this mess. I'm worried..."

She bit her lip, her delicate face scrunched with concern.

"Worried about what?" Evelyn lifted her eyes.

"Worried Mr. Valdemar might act on emotion."

Evelyn's expression tightened. She had indeed underestimated Sebastian's capacity for restraint. Rather than leaving him in the dark, it was better to confront the truth head-on.

"Contact me immediately if anything happens."

The Valdemar Group headquarters stood tall and unyielding amid the storm.

Evelyn stepped into the lobby, water droplets sliding off her umbrella. Before she could speak, the receptionist rushed forward with excitement.

"Miss Roland!"

The starry-eyed gaze gave Evelyn pause.

"I watched your livestream!" The receptionist's cheeks flushed pink. "When you stood next to Mr. Valdemar, it was just..."

"Just what?"

A deep male voice sounded from behind.

Sebastian had appeared in the lobby unnoticed, the corners of his lips lifted. For once, he wasn't in formal attire—a light-colored shirt softened his usual sharp demeanor.

The receptionist instantly fell silent, bowing her head nervously.

Evelyn turned, meeting those smiling peach-blossom eyes. Rainwater dripped from her hair, spreading tiny puddles on the polished floor.

"Looking for me?" Sebastian took a step closer.

His presence was suddenly intimate, carrying the crisp scent of rain. Evelyn tightened her grip on her bag—inside lay a secret that could shatter their fragile peace.
###Chapter 328

Everyone at Valdemar Group knew their CEO was in poor health and rarely made appearances. He seldom attended high-level meetings, let alone personally came downstairs to greet someone.

The receptionist clutched her ID badge, her palms damp with sweat.

Sebastian Valdemar was acting unusually today.

Standing beside Evelyn Roland, his usual icy demeanor had softened noticeably. There was even... a hint of deliberate ingratiation.

Though it felt disrespectful to think it, the scene resembled a man fawning over a woman.

The elevator doors slid shut with a soft ding.

Only then did the receptionist exhale, her legs weak as she leaned against the front desk for support.

Inside the enclosed elevator, Evelyn caught the faint scent of medicinal herbs clinging to Sebastian.

"What brings you here?" he asked hoarsely, clearing his throat.

"I need to discuss something with you."

As the elevator ascended, Evelyn cut straight to the point. "It's about Château Blanc."

Sebastian's eyes flickered.

He took the phone she handed him, watching the grainy surveillance footage playing on the screen.

"I suspect..." Evelyn hesitated. "It's your uncle."

The video ended. Silence engulfed the elevator.

Sebastian's fingers tapped rhythmically against his wheelchair armrest, the tempo slowing gradually.

"How long have you been investigating?" he asked abruptly.

Evelyn blinked. "Three days."

"You shouldn't have to deal with this." A bitter smile touched his lips. "Caught between me and my family."

He turned his wheelchair toward the mirrored wall, his pallid reflection staring back.

"Proceed with your plan." His voice was soft but deliberate. "Let me know if you need my cooperation."

Evelyn's tension eased.

Her biggest concern had been Sebastian letting emotions cloud his judgment. But her business partner proved more levelheaded than she'd expected.

"Thank you," she said sincerely.

As the elevator reached the top floor, Sebastian suddenly held the door open.

"Evelyn." It was the first time he'd addressed her so intimately. "No matter the outcome, I'm on your side."

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, gilding his gaunt profile in gold.

For the first time, Evelyn found this frail CEO remarkably dependable.
###Chapter 329

"My oversight caused you trouble."

Sebastian Valdemar's voice was low and restrained.

"I'll personally monitor Vincent Valdemar." His use of the full name carried finality.

"I'll keep my emotions in check to avoid alerting him."

The decisiveness expected from a titan who dominated the business world was chilling.

"Regardless of whether it's him in the footage, I'll probe further."

Evelyn Roland arched a delicate brow. The suggestion aligned perfectly with her intentions.

She needed to locate that staff member, and having Sebastian investigate Vincent was ideal.

"Proceed as planned."

"Ms. Roland." Sebastian suddenly smiled. "I'm not as fragile as you think."

Evelyn glanced at him, lips curving slightly. "Mind your health. Don't overexert yourself."

Warmth flickered in Sebastian's eyes.

"Sir, everything you requested is ready."

Theodore Ashcroft entered, pushing a cart laden with fresh fruits and desserts.

"Leave it here."

Sebastian rose, testing the juice glass's temperature before handing it to Evelyn. "Fresh mango."

She took a sip. "All this for me?"

Sebastian rubbed his nose awkwardly, tacitly confirming.

"Pity I must leave soon. Your kindness is wasted."

She retrieved a medicine bottle from her bag. "Take one during emotional fluctuations."

Sebastian accepted it like a treasured relic, the shadows vanishing from his brow.

After finalizing arrangements, Evelyn departed with minimal pleasantries.

"Sir?"

Long after Evelyn left, Sebastian remained motionless. Theodore called several times before he stirred.

"Are you unwell?"

"Fine. Dispose of these."

Theodore sighed at the untouched spread, wheeling the cart away.

Heavy curtains blocked sunlight in the dim room where a man slowly opened his eyes.

"Someone's investigating you. Shall I intervene?"

The man rose, drawing back the drapes. Harsh light made him squint.

The caller waited patiently.

He lit a cigar, inhaling deeply before answering with languid indifference.

"How many have tried?" Smoke obscured his smirk. "What became of them?"

Silence answered.

"After all these years, you still lack composure."

The call ended. The man toyed with his cigar, eyes glinting with amusement.

Every move had been meticulously calculated, every trace erased flawlessly.

Confident, he exhaled a perfect smoke ring. No weaknesses remained to exploit.
###Chapter 330

In Evelyn Roland's office, Bianca Savigny flipped through the latest compiled documents.

"Still no leads." Bianca closed the folder, her brow furrowed.

Sebastian Valdemar stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his phone screen darkening.

He turned toward the desk, his gaze settling on a photo frame.

The young man in the picture radiated youthful vigor, while the man beside him wore a gentle smile.

The basement of Château Blanc was dimly lit.

Evelyn reclined on a leather sofa, her fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest.

Bianca stood nearby, her foot planted on a man trussed up like a mummy.

"Make him talk."

Evelyn's voice was soft, yet it sent a shiver down the bound man's spine.

He struggled to lift his head. "This is illegal detention! I'll call the police!"

"From Château Blanc?" Evelyn leaned forward, her red lips curving slightly.

The man's pupils constricted violently.

"I don't know what you're talking about!" he spat defiantly.

Bianca snorted. "Still playing tough."

Evelyn rose, her stilettos clicking sharply against the floor.

"Bianca, check his gambling debts."

The man's face drained of color.

"Master, he owes over three million at the casino." Bianca scrolled through her phone. "The loan sharks said they'll take his hand if he doesn't pay up."

The man's breathing turned ragged.

"Send him to the police." Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Along with the evidence."

"Wait!" The man thrashed suddenly. "What do you want to know?"

Evelyn held up her phone screen. "Recognize him?"

The photo showed a young man whose features bore a striking resemblance to the bound man.

"N-no... I don't." He averted his face.

Bianca stomped on his back. "Last chance."

The man gritted his teeth in pain. "H-he's my younger brother."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Go on."

"He disappeared three months ago." The man's voice trembled. "Last place he was seen... Château Blanc."

Evelyn and Bianca exchanged a glance.

"Take him away." Evelyn turned toward the depths of the basement. "Make him spill everything."
###Chapter 331

The damp, chilly air reeked of mildew.

The chained man jerked his head up at the sound of approaching footsteps. His bloodshot eyes and cracked lips spoke of exhaustion.

Evelyn Roland's stilettos clicked sharply against the stone floor, echoing through the empty cellar.

"Daniel Murphy, have you reconsidered?"

His pupils contracted. "How did you—"

Bianca Savigny cut him off with an impatient wave. "Spare us the theatrics."

"This is illegal confinement!" Daniel yanked at his chains, the metal links clattering.

Evelyn smirked, pulling a stack of photos from her bag and scattering them at his feet.

Gambling den snapshots fanned across the floor.

"Your creditors would be thrilled to know your whereabouts."

Daniel's face drained of color.

"Money or your life. Choose."

He gritted his teeth in silence.

Evelyn moved faster than he could blink—her hand clamped around his wrist.

A sickening crack split the air.

Daniel collapsed to his knees, sweat soaking through his shirt.

"I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!"

Bianca dragged a chair over, looking down at him like a specimen under glass.

"That video was me... I had no choice!" He panted. "Two million in debt... they threatened to chop my hands—"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed to slits. "Who gave the order?"

"Don't know! Some guy approached me before the competition... told me to swap the bottles—"

"Contact details."

"Gone! I swear!" Daniel shook his head wildly. "The number's dead!"

Bianca glanced at her mentor.

Evelyn's fingers drummed the chairback. "Give me the number."

Her gaze could have flayed skin.
###Chapter 332

"The phone hasn't been on me for a while."

Daniel Murphy slumped on the ground, gasping like a dying dog. His entire body burned with pain, his throat parched. Survival was all he cared about now.

Bianca Savigny's smile froze.

"Voice characteristics of the caller?"

"A woman... used a voice changer..." Daniel winced, struggling to speak. "I've told you everything... please..."

His arms hung limp at his sides, his consciousness fading.

Crack!

With a swift twist and push, Bianca realigned his dislocated joints.

Daniel gasped.

"Just a dislocation." Bianca smirked.

Terror seized him. He dropped to his knees, forehead thudding against the floor. "Spare me, ma'am! I was blind not to recognize your power—"

Evelyn Roland ignored his pleas, turning to Bianca. "Is the team here?"

"Waiting in the parking lot."

"Take him."

"Where are you taking me?" Daniel's eyes bulged with panic.

A towering man entered, lifting him like a sack of potatoes.

"Let me go!"

Daniel flailed helplessly in midair. Just then, crisp footsteps echoed down the hallway.

Three pairs of polished dress shoes approached in unison.

"Help! Officers, save me!"

Sobs and snot streaked Daniel's face.

"Silence."

A swift chop to the neck from the lead officer, and darkness swallowed him.

"Julian, he's yours."

Julian Roland scanned his sister. "No injuries?"

"Not a scratch."

The entire operation unfolded without a single employee noticing.

——

In the interrogation room, Daniel spilled every detail of his crimes like a broken dam.

Julian's expression darkened. If not for the badge on his chest, he'd have strangled the bastard himself.

"Sir... can I leave now?"

"Leave?" Julian scoffed. "You'll be retiring behind bars."

As he walked away, agonized wails followed him.

——

By dawn, an official statement dominated headlines:
[@Château Blanc Poisoned Wine Case Solved. Mastermind Daniel Murphy Arrested. Investigation confirms Château Blanc as the victim. Public urged to refrain from spreading rumors. Justice prevails.]
###Chapter 333

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the villa, casting an eerie glow on the wine glass in the man's hand.

Twitter's server crash notifications kept popping up on his screen. His eyes darkened dangerously as he stared at the display.

"Sir, the situation is deteriorating." The assistant wiped sweat from his brow. "Château Blanc's stock prices are skyrocketing."

The man hurled his glass against the wall. Shards exploded like crystal daggers.

"Evacuate everyone immediately." He loosened his tie, voice ragged. "Take care of Daniel Murphy. Make it quick."

As the assistant scrambled to leave, the man suddenly called out, "Wait."

His lips curled into a cruel smile as he studied Evelyn Roland's verified profile picture. "Prepare a gift for Miss Roland."

Meanwhile, in Château Blanc's garden...

Evelyn tapped her fingers against the stone table, brow furrowed. "Julian, any leads on that blurry figure from the surveillance footage?"

"Forensics is working on it." Julian Roland's expression was grim. "Whoever it was knew how to cover their tracks."

A sudden breeze made Evelyn shiver.

She whirled around to find Sebastian Valdemar standing behind her, his black trench coat billowing like a storm cloud.

"You look pale." He brushed a fallen leaf from her shoulder. "You should rest."

Before she could respond, her phone vibrated violently.

A Twitter alert blazed across her screen: #ChâteauBlancFormerEmployeeDiesMysteriously#
###Chapter 334

Evelyn Roland snapped back to reality, her fingertips trembling slightly. She looked up at the man who had appeared unexpectedly and shook her head gently. "It's nothing. What brings you here?"

Outside the pavilion, Sebastian Valdemar's figure stood tall against the twilight.

"I came as soon as I saw the trending news," he said in a low voice, his gaze lingering on her pale face. "Did the suspect confess?"

"Yes." Evelyn rubbed her stiff neck. "His name is Daniel Murphy. An orphan. He does bear some resemblance to your uncle."

Sebastian's eyes darkened, his fingers unconsciously tapping the stone table. "I tested Uncle Vincent. Found nothing unusual."

"Let's leave it at that." She rose, her skirt swaying in the breeze. "I'll have someone monitor the International Wine Tasting Championship."

"I'll send discreet assistance." Sebastian took half a step forward but stopped abruptly. The dark circles under her eyes made him swallow his next words. "Get some rest."

Evelyn nodded. As she turned, a strand of her hair brushed against his sleeve. Sebastian remained rooted in place until her slender silhouette vanished down the corridor.

He exhaled deeply, the tension in his shoulders finally easing. These days of deliberate distance had been for the investigation—and the fear of confronting the possibility. If his uncle had truly been involved in the poisoned wine case, how could he face her?

Thankfully, the truth wasn't the worst-case scenario.

Meanwhile, the Valrose family dining room blazed with light.

"Oliver, eat more." Wendy Valrose piled food onto her son's plate, her plump arms making the table wobble.

Oscar Valrose set down his chopsticks with a frown. "I heard you've been getting close to Isabella Langley?"

Oliver Valrose's chopsticks stilled. The braised pork in his bowl suddenly lost its flavor.

"Dad, let's talk after dinner," he muttered, shoveling rice into his mouth. Yet another face surfaced in his mind—Evelyn on the awards podium, the pale curve of her neck glowing under the spotlight.

"How far have things progressed?" Wendy pressed eagerly.

Oliver's Adam's apple bobbed as he forced down tasteless bites. His mother's voice sounded muffled, as if through frosted glass. His thoughts had already drifted to the grapevines of Château Blanc—and the woman who never spared him a second glance.
###Chapter 335

Isabella Langley was undeniably beautiful, with a petite and curvaceous figure that would normally make her Oliver Valrose's type.

But that was before he met Evelyn Roland.

Standing next to Evelyn, Isabella paled in comparison—like a firefly overshadowed by moonlight.

Evelyn possessed an innate, ethereal elegance that captivated attention even without makeup.

Oliver prided himself on being a connoisseur of women, surrounded by countless beauties.

Yet Evelyn struck him with a bone-deep awe he'd never experienced before.

A woman like her—this was the kind of unparalleled beauty he, Oliver Valrose, deserved to marry.

The memory of Evelyn's delicate profile made his lips curl into an infatuated smirk.

"Oliver, I've made inquiries. The Roland heiress is truly exceptional," Wendy Valrose patted her son's hand. "Propose tomorrow. A woman like her won't stay unattached for long."

A shadow flickered in Oliver's eyes.

"Do as your mother says," Oscar Valrose set down his teacup with finality. "Or get out of this house."

Marrying into the Roland family would elevate the Valrose name to new heights.

"Understood," Oliver gritted out, his gaze toward his father venomous.

Damn old man!

Using his credit cards as leverage?

How was he supposed to host tonight's pool party without funds? His reputation would be ruined.

"Old Ma will drive you tomorrow," Oscar said, his retreating footsteps like a death knell.

The door slammed shut behind him.

Oliver stared at his dwindling bank balance, knuckles cracking under the force of his clenched fists.

"Senile bastard!" he spat, fury boiling in his eyes.

His father's desperation to court the Rolands was embarrassingly transparent.

He knew exactly what was at stake—the Roland family's influence was something people would kill to access.

Even as a mere adopted daughter, Isabella was still a legitimate Roland.

Crack!

His phone shattered against the wall, the screen fracturing like a spiderweb.

Oliver laughed as he surveyed the wreckage.
###Chapter 336 

Oliver Valrose's eyes snapped open in the darkness, a wild idea exploding in his mind.

He bolted upright in bed, fingers digging unconsciously into his palms.

The image of Evelyn Roland's icy, breathtaking beauty haunted him.

"If only I could step through the Roland family's gates..."

He licked his cracked lips, eyes gleaming with feral intensity.

His phone screen lit up the darkness, illuminating his twisted smile.

With a sharp click, the brand-new device suddenly went black.

"Useless!"

Oliver hurled the phone against the wall, shattering it into pieces.

Turning, he fished out an old phone from the depths of his drawer, fingers flying across the screen.

"Hello?"

Isabella Langley's lazy voice drifted through the receiver.

"I'm coming to the Roland estate tomorrow."

Three seconds of dead silence followed.

"Have you lost your mind?" Isabella's voice shot up an octave. "What do you think you're doing?"

Oliver calmly adjusted his cuffs. "Why... to propose marriage, of course."

"Over my dead body!" The words hissed through clenched teeth. "I swear, if you dare show your face here, I'll make sure your entire family disappears from A City!"

Oliver burst into laughter.

"How impressive, Miss Langley." His eyes narrowed. "Pity your family's too busy putting out their own fires to bother with small fry like me."

Ragged breathing filled the line.

"What do you want?" Isabella's voice trembled.

"Simple." Oliver flicked his lighter open and shut. "I want a formal invitation through your front gates."

The flame cast eerie shadows across his sharp features.

"As for my reason for visiting..." He drew out the words. "How about introducing me as your boyfriend?"

"Never!"

"Don't refuse so quickly." Oliver's voice dropped to a whisper. "Unless you've forgotten what happened last month at Le Bar du Ritz..."

Isabella's breath hitched.

"Fine." The word barely escaped her clenched jaw. "But if you breathe a word of—"

"Relax." Oliver's smile didn't reach his eyes. "I know exactly where to draw the line."

After hanging up, he moved to the window, staring at the distant silhouette of the Roland mansion.

"Evelyn Roland..." His whisper slithered through the night. "This time, you won't escape me."

Moonlight stretched his shadow long and thin across the floor—a viper poised to strike.
###Chapter 337

The moment the call ended, Isabella Langley nearly threw her phone across the room.

"That bastard!"

She glared at the darkened screen, her chest heaving with rage.

How dare Oliver Valrose hang up on her first?

If it weren't for that incident, she would never have gotten involved with someone like him. Now she couldn't even shake him off.

Isabella massaged her temples, a dull ache pulsing behind her eyes.

The winery was unusually quiet at night.

Evelyn Roland woke up starving.

She blinked groggily, noticing the city lights glowing outside her window.

Her stomach growled in protest.

Dragging herself downstairs, she nearly tripped over Bianca Savigny crouching by the door.

"Master!"

The girl's eyes lit up as she proudly presented a tray of food.

"You waited here the whole time?"

Evelyn's heart warmed at the sight of steaming dishes arranged with Bianca's signature flair.

"I knew you'd wake up soon." Bianca grinned, her eyes crinkling like crescent moons. "All your favorites."

"Thank you."

Evelyn accepted the tray, her fingers brushing the warm porcelain.

"Master, let's go stargazing tomorrow!" Bianca suddenly suggested. "They say the countryside has the clearest skies."

Her hopeful eyes sparkled with excitement.

Evelyn opened her mouth to agree when her phone rang.

"Mom" flashed across the screen.

"Evelyn? Why are you eating so late?"

Sophia Roland immediately noticed the meal in the video call, her brows knitting together.

"Mom, I—"

Evelyn swiftly pulled Bianca into frame.

"Auntie!" Bianca chirped seamlessly. "I made Master taste-test my new recipes!"

She beamed, sticking out her tongue playfully.

Sophia chuckled. "Is that so?"

Her gaze softened as it returned to her daughter. "Evelyn, you've lost weight again."
###Chapter 338

Sophia Roland's eyes glistened with unshed tears as her fingers traced her daughter's face on the display.

"Mom, it's just the camera angle making me look thinner." Evelyn Roland pulled Bianca Savigny closer, pressing their cheeks together. "See? Bianca's the one who's actually slim."

Bianca pouted, wronged but silent.

Sophia finally laughed, delicate crow's feet appearing at the corners of her eyes.

"How wonderful..."

The words slipped from Bianca's lips before she could stop herself.

Evelyn gave her a knowing look before turning back to her mother. "I'll bring Bianca home tomorrow."

"Really?" Sophia clasped her hands over her mouth in delight.

"Mm. Have Alexander pick us up."

"Perfect! I'll start preparing right away! Get some rest, my darling. Love you!"

After the call ended, Evelyn shook her head with an affectionate smile. Her mother's whirlwind energy hadn't changed in decades.

Bianca hovered nervously. "Master, maybe I shouldn't—"

"Suit yourself." Evelyn picked up a piece of fish with her chopsticks.

"I'll go!" Bianca instantly backtracked, eyes sparkling. "What do your family members like? Any taboos I should know?"

"Silence."

Bianca's face flushed crimson as she stomped out. "You're horrible!"

The door slammed shut. Evelyn's lips curved upward.

——

Blenheim Palace glowed with light.

Sophia threw herself into her husband's arms like an excited schoolgirl. "Our daughter's coming home tomorrow!"

Edward Roland stroked her hair. "I heard. What needs preparing?"

"The freshest fruits, complete sterilization of the guest rooms, and those flowers—"

"Leave it to me." He kissed her forehead. "Rest now."

——

Dawn found the estate buzzing with activity.

Edward, unusually dressed in casual homewear, accompanied his wife on final inspections.

"Father, Mother, isn't this excessive?" Isabella Langley stood at the staircase, surveying the immaculate parlor.

Sophia directed maids polishing vases. "Isabella, you're up early. Did we disturb you?"
###Chapter 339

"Mother, why is it so lively downstairs?" Isabella Langley rubbed her sleepy eyes as she descended the staircase, watching the servants bustle about.

Her heart skipped a beat. Could it be for Oliver Valrose? The thought made her lips curl into an involuntary smile.

"Your sister is returning today." Her mother didn't even glance up from polishing the vase. "Evelyn has her... particularities. Everything must be spotless."

Isabella's smile froze.

"Evelyn's coming back?" She forced a cheerful tone. "Let me help prepare her room."

"Unnecessary." Her mother finally met her gaze. "Evelyn dislikes others touching her belongings. Go have breakfast."

In the dining room, a servant arranged delicate silverware.

"Miss Isabella, I heard Miss Evelyn is bringing friends." The maid smiled. "You young ladies will have so much to talk about."

Isabella's fork clattered onto her plate.

The maid discreetly retreated.

"Evelyn Roland!" She violently overturned her breakfast tray, sending porcelain shattering across the floor.

Morning light filtered through sheer curtains at Château Blanc.

Evelyn was fastening the last button of her blouse when Bianca Savigny's energetic voice echoed outside: "Master, I'm ready!"

The foyer overflowed with gifts—imported fruits, rare tonics—nearly blocking the entrance.

Meanwhile, tension thickened in the Valrose residence.

"Where is Oliver?" Oscar Valrose glared at his watch, his expression stormy.

Wendy Valrose hurried upstairs. She found her son still snoring when she threw open his door.

"Get up!" Oscar snatched a glass from the nightstand and hurled it.

"Ah!" Oliver clutched his bleeding forehead as he jolted awake.

"Thirty minutes." Oscar spat the words before dragging his wife out and slamming the door.

Oliver stared at the ceiling, then slammed his fist into the mattress.
###Chapter 340

The morning light filtered through Château Blanc as Bianca Savigny fumbled with gift boxes, letting out occasional frustrated sighs.

"Master Evelyn, don't you think this wrapping looks too plain?"

Evelyn Roland lounged on the leather sofa, rolling a mint between her fingers. She arched a brow. "Should we just buy the entire department store instead?"

"Master!" Bianca's ears flushed pink as she crumpled the ribbon in her hands.

"Enough." Evelyn stood, crushing the mint between her teeth. "Go change."

Sunlight streamed through the windows. The drive from the vineyard to the Roland estate would take at least two hours.

Bianca scampered upstairs like a startled rabbit, the wooden stairs creaking under her hurried steps.

Evelyn glanced at her buzzing phone. The family group chat had exploded. She played Alexander Roland's voice message, his cheerful tone filling the room.

"Returning." Her reply was curt. A faint smile played on her lips as she ascended the staircase.

Meanwhile, at the Valrose mansion, Wendy Valrose paced, checking her watch.

"Why isn't that boy down yet?"

Oscar Valrose flipped through his newspaper without looking up. "Thirty seconds left."

At precisely 9:29:54, Oliver Valrose ambled downstairs, his tie hanging loosely around his neck.

"Take these." Wendy pointed at the mountain of gift boxes.

Oliver grabbed an apple and took a bite. "Whatever you think is best."

"Stand straight!" Oscar slammed his newspaper onto the coffee table.

Only after their son straightened up did Wendy anxiously pull him aside. "Should we go with you?"

"He goes alone." Oscar rested a hand on his wife's shoulder. "Proposing on the first visit would be improper."

As the car engine faded, Wendy twisted her fingers. "The Rolands are..."

"If he messes this up, he's disowned." Oscar's eyes gleamed as he stared at the gates.

On the terrace of the Roland estate, Isabella Langley placed a celadon bowl beside her mother.

"Mother, Evelyn just passed the toll station." She scooped a spoonful of glistening bird's nest soup. "You should eat something."

Sophia Roland accepted the bowl but kept her gaze fixed on the estate gates. Morning light streamed through the glass conservatory, casting delicate patterns on her silver-streaked hair.
###Chapter 341

"Isabella is so thoughtful." Sophia Roland gently stroked her daughter's hair, her eyes filled with maternal warmth.

"Only Mom gets remembered? What about Dad?" Edward Roland feigned sternness, though amusement glinted in his eyes.

"Of course not!" Isabella quickly stood. "I'll go get your portion right now."

The dining room brimmed with warmth, so palpable even the staff moved with hushed steps.

"Mom, Dad... There's something I need to tell you..."

Isabella bit her lip, gathering courage to mention Oliver Valrose's impending visit.

The butler entered abruptly, cutting through her thoughts.

"Sir, Madam, a Mr. Oliver Valrose is at the gate. He claims to be Miss Isabella's boyfriend."

His crisp voice echoed sharply in the quiet room.

"Boyfriend?"

Edward's chopsticks paused mid-air. Sophia turned to her daughter in surprise.

Though they knew she was dating, an unannounced visit...

The couple exchanged a glance.

"Show him in first."

Edward rose, straightening his collar. Hospitality came first, regardless of circumstances.

Isabella trailed behind her parents, each step feeling unsteady.

Outside the manor gates, Oliver clutched multiple gift bags, though his gaze lingered on the manicured gardens.

"Now this is what I call a mansion..."

His eyes greedily traced every lavish detail. The Valrose family maintained appearances, but their debts ran deep.

If he could secure the Rolands' favor...

"Mr. Valrose, please board the cart."

A security guard pulled up in a golf cart.

"You need vehicles to get around your own home?" Oliver raised an eyebrow.

"The main house is three kilometers from the gate," came the polite reply.

During the ride, Oliver persistently inquired about the estate's value, receiving only courteous deflections.

"We've arrived."

Oliver practically leaped off before the cart fully stopped.

Three figures stood ahead. The distinguished middle-aged couple could only be the Rolands.

Half a step behind them stood Isabella.

"Uncle, Aunt, forgive my intrusion." Oliver flashed an ingratiating smile, bowing slightly.

Edward gave a curt nod. "Let's continue inside."

The couple walked ahead, deliberately creating space for the younger pair.

Isabella clenched her fists. The charade had to continue—or else...

She took a deep breath and linked arms with Oliver.
###Chapter 342

"We're here."

Isabella Langley placed the carefully prepared gifts gently on the living room floor, a polite smile curving her lips. She took a deep breath before turning to her parents on the sofa. "Dad, Mom, this is Oliver Valrose. My boyfriend."

Oliver gave a slight bow, his smile perfectly measured. "Mr. and Mrs. Roland, it's a pleasure to meet you."

Edward Roland's gaze swept over him briefly. "Have a seat."

The moment Oliver sat down, he met Edward's piercing stare. His back stiffened instinctively.

"We didn't tell you about our relationship sooner because the timing didn't feel right," Isabella said, surprising her parents as she rarely made excuses for anyone. They exchanged a glance.

The doorbell rang.

Edward and Sophia Roland stood simultaneously, their faces lighting up. Sophia rushed to the entrance and pulled her daughter into a tight embrace. "Evelyn! I've missed you so much!"

"Mom, I'm home," Evelyn Roland murmured, patting her mother's trembling back.

"Look at you, crying when our daughter's return should be a happy occasion," Edward chided gently as he wiped his wife's tears.

"I'm just overjoyed," Sophia choked out. The recent online scandal had kept her awake with worry, but her health had delayed her travel plans. By the time she was ready to leave, the matter had already been resolved—leaving her with lingering guilt.

Evelyn squeezed her mother's hand. "Really, I'm fine. I would've told you if something was wrong."

"You're just like your brothers, always bearing everything alone," Sophia scolded, tapping Evelyn's forehead affectionately.

As the family of three spoke, Evelyn tugged lightly on the sleeve of the person beside her. Only then did Sophia notice the bright-eyed girl standing behind her daughter.

"Auntie, I'm Bianca Savigny, your daughter's apprentice," the girl said with a radiant smile. "You're so much younger than I imagined! If I didn't know you were Evelyn's mother, I'd have thought you were her sister."

Sophia burst into laughter. "What a sweet talker!"

"Uncle," Bianca greeted Edward, straightening her posture unconsciously.

Edward gave a slight nod. "Welcome."

"Let's put the gifts down first," Evelyn reminded.

Sophia finally noticed the numerous bags in Bianca's hands and waved dismissively. "You shouldn't have brought anything just to visit."

"It's only proper," Bianca replied sincerely.

With an arm around each girl, Sophia led them toward the living room. Edward followed, an uncharacteristic smile softening his features.

"Sister!" Isabella suddenly rose from her seat, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness. "You're finally back. Mom and Dad talk about you every day."

Evelyn responded with a faint, "Mm."
###Chapter 343

"Sister." Isabella's eyes instantly welled up with tears, her voice trembling.

Bianca darted forward and enthusiastically grasped her hand. "Hi there! I'm Bianca Savigny. Just call me Bianca."

Isabella's carefully crafted emotional moment was shattered. A flicker of irritation flashed in her eyes.

"Evelyn, this is your sister's boyfriend, Oliver Valrose," Sophia said gently, taking Evelyn's hand.

Oliver stepped forward with a polished smile. "I've heard so much about you. Isabella often mentions her brilliant older sister."

He extended his hand, but his gaze lingered a beat too long on Evelyn's face.

Evelyn gave a slight nod, barely sparing him a glance.

Oliver's hand hung awkwardly in the air, his smile faltering.

"Mom, these strawberries are sweet," Evelyn remarked coolly.

Sophia beamed. "I saved them just for you. Your father begged all afternoon, but I wouldn't let him touch them."

Edward immediately sidled up. "See how unfair your mother is, darling?"

Evelyn popped a strawberry into his mouth. Edward grinned like a child.

"Honestly, acting like this at your age," Sophia chided playfully.

"No acting, no treats," Edward retorted smugly as he chewed.

Bianca watched with sparkling eyes. "You two are adorable!"

The moment she spoke, a strawberry landed in her mouth. Bianca gasped in delight, turning to Evelyn. "Thank you, Master!"

Isabella observed the scene, her nails digging into her palms.

"Isabella, your sister seems to hold quite a high status in the Roland family," Oliver murmured, though his eyes remained fixed on Evelyn.

Isabella whipped her head toward him, her gaze venomous. "Watch your eyes."

A chill ran down Oliver's spine. He forced a laugh. "Just making conversation."

"Remember your place," Isabella hissed. "Cross me, and you'll regret it."

A shadow flickered in Oliver's eyes, but it vanished as quickly as it appeared.

The living room buzzed with laughter—except for Oliver, who sat stiffly on edge.

He discreetly tugged Isabella's sleeve.

"Mom, Dad, I'll take Oliver for a walk in the garden," Isabella announced, her voice suddenly sweet.

Sophia nodded. "Don't wander too far."

Bianca rubbed her arms, unnerved by Isabella's seamless shift in demeanor.

The movement didn't escape Isabella. Before leaving, she shot Evelyn a glare sharp enough to cut glass.
###Chapter 344

"Oliver, let's go see a movie." Isabella Langley clung to Oliver Valrose's arm, her cheeks flushing pink.

Sophia Roland watched their retreating figures with an amused smile. "It seems Isabella is serious this time."

"Father, Mother, have you investigated Oliver's background?" Evelyn Roland suddenly set down her teacup.

Edward Roland waved a dismissive hand. "Young love shouldn't be interfered with. Oliver has impeccable manners, and Isabella clearly adores him..."

"Is that so?" Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smirk.

"Your sister is getting married, yet your two brothers remain single." Sophia's gaze drifted unconsciously toward Bianca Savigny, who was peeling an orange.

The aroma wafting from the kitchen made Bianca fidget. She stole a glance toward the bustling direction, her fingers absently tracing the fruit plate's edge.

"Go ahead if you want." Evelyn didn't even look up.

"That's unacceptable!" Sophia protested immediately. "We can't have guests working in the kitchen."

"She becomes immobile when she smells cooking oil." Evelyn shook her head in resignation.

Bianca was already on her feet, eyes sparkling. "Uncle, Aunt, I truly love cooking!"

With permission granted, Bianca fluttered into the kitchen like a delighted songbird. The startled staff nearly knocked over spice bottles.

"What may we prepare for you, Miss Savigny?" The butler hurried forward.

"I'd like to help with some dishes." Bianca rolled up her sleeves, revealing slender wrists.

The staff exchanged uncertain glances. Finally, the head chef relented. "You may assist with plating, but please don't touch any knives."

Bianca nodded obediently, yet secretly pocketed a carving knife from the cutting board when turning away.

When the first radish blossom unfurled from her fingertips, the kitchen fell silent. The head chef gaped as the petite girl's blade flashed, transforming a carrot into a blooming rose.

"Well, well. A new kitchen assistant?"

The unexpected male voice made Bianca's hand slip, the blade grazing her fingertip. She whirled around indignantly to meet a pair of amused eyes.

A man leaned against the doorframe, his shirt collar carelessly open, his gaze roaming over her. "This isn't a playground for little girls, shortstack."

Bianca slammed the knife onto the cutting board. "Who are you calling shortstack?"

"Feisty." The man arched an eyebrow as he approached. "Do you even know who I am, pipsqueak?"

The kitchen's temperature seemed to plummet instantly.
###Chapter 345 

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the kitchen, where Bianca Savigny was intently chopping fruit, completely oblivious to the frantic eye signals the servants were making behind her.

"You're stepping on my limited edition sneakers."

A lazy male voice sounded behind her.

Bianca didn't even turn around. "Then don't stand so close."

The kitchen fell into deadly silence.

Only then did she look up, meeting a pair of peach-blossom eyes glinting with amusement. The man had a head of flamboyantly dyed hair, his earring glinting in the sunlight.

"Colorful rooster," she blurted out.

The servants gasped.

"What did you say?" Alexander Roland narrowed his eyes, his voice dangerously rising.

"I said—" Bianca enunciated each word slowly, "your hair looks like a colorful rooster."

Alexander let out a humorless laugh. In all his life, no one had dared speak to him like this.

"Who hired her?" he demanded coldly. "Get her out of the Roland estate. Now."

"Third Young Master..." The butler hesitated.

"What, are my orders meaningless now?"

Bianca finally realized something. The fruit knife in her hand clattered onto the cutting board.

"Third Brother!"

Evelyn Roland's voice cut through the tension just in time.

Alexander's expression instantly shifted, turning pitiful as he turned to her. "Little sister, she insulted me..."

Bianca froze. She finally remembered where she'd seen that face before—in the family photo Evelyn had shown her.

"She's my best friend," Evelyn said helplessly. "Mom personally invited her to help out."

The air turned to ice.

Alexander's face went through a series of expressions. He had just insulted... his mother and sister?

"Sorry," he muttered stiffly, the tips of his ears burning red.

Bianca kept her head down, fingers nervously picking at the edge of her apron.

"Bianca," Evelyn said gently, "you weren't entirely blameless either."

"I'm sorr—" she began.

"I was rude first," Alexander cut in, turning his face away awkwardly.

Bianca peeked up just in time to see him tugging at his hair in frustration. That brightly colored tuft stuck up even more, making him look like a ruffled parrot.

She couldn't help it—a giggle escaped.

Alexander glared, but under his sister's warning look, he slumped his shoulders in defeat.

The servants exchanged glances. None of them had ever seen the Third Young Master like this before.
###Chapter 346

Evelyn Roland had expected her brother Alexander to be too proud to apologize.

After all, he was someone accustomed to being the center of attention.

To her surprise, he openly admitted his mistake in front of everyone.

"I was at fault too. My apologies, Evelyn."

She cleared her throat lightly as they shook hands, putting the conflict behind them.

The tension finally dissipated.

"Master, I'd like to finish preparing those two dishes."

Bianca Savigny retied her apron, ready to resume the cooking Alexander had interrupted earlier.

"Go ahead. Alexander, let's step outside."

"Alright."

Before leaving, Alexander couldn't help glancing back.

The petite figure effortlessly lifted the heavy cast-iron pan, her movements fluid and practiced.

"Alexander?"

Evelyn noticed he hadn't followed.

"Coming."

Soon, the kitchen was filled with an enticing aroma.

"Done!"

Bianca plated the two dishes—a crystal-clear fish broth and spicy stir-fried beef glistening with a rich red hue.

Even professional chefs would have been impressed.

As the siblings reached the living room, they heard lively conversation.

"Do we have guests?" Alexander raised an eyebrow.

"Not sure."

They quickened their pace.

Aside from their parents and Oliver Valrose, a sharply dressed man stood in the living room.

"Mr. Valdemar?"

The siblings spoke in unison.

Sebastian Valdemar gave Evelyn a slight nod. "Pardon the intrusion."

"I invited Mr. Valdemar."

Sophia Roland guided her daughter to sit.

"We owe him our thanks for his help at the winery. Tonight's family dinner seemed like the perfect opportunity."

Alexander subtly positioned himself between them.

"An honor to finally meet you, Mr. Valdemar."

His chosen seat conveniently blocked their line of sight.

Sebastian's eyes darkened slightly, though his smile remained unshaken.

Their gazes locked in a silent battle of wills.

"Dinner is ready."

The scent of food wafted from the dining room.

Bianca brought out the two dishes she had prepared.

"Thank you, Bianca."

Sophia noticed the distinctiveness of the dishes.

The meal proceeded with warmth and laughter.

Then Sebastian pulled a hair tie from his pocket.

"Here."

Evelyn paused mid-bite. "Why do you have this?"

"Olivia suggested it."

At the mention of that name, understanding dawned, and she accepted it.

"Thanks."

She swiftly tied up her long hair.

To Alexander, the casual intimacy of the gesture set off alarm bells.

Though long single, his instincts as a man warned him—

This Mr. Valdemar was trouble.
###Chapter 347

"Try this, little sister."

Alexander Roland picked up a slice of onion with serving chopsticks and placed it steadily into Evelyn's bowl. His peach-blossom eyes gleamed with triumph as he shot Sebastian Valdemar a challenging glance.

"Third brother..."

Evelyn stared at the small mountain of onions in her bowl, her fingertips trembling slightly. She wasn't a picky eater, but the pungent aroma always reminded her of the bitter medicinal soups forced down her throat during childhood illnesses.

Alexander's eyes sparkled. "Why aren't you eating?"

Before Sophia Roland could speak, a pair of slender, well-defined hands reached over. Without a word, Sebastian swapped the onion-filled bowl for one containing milky-white fish soup.

"While it's hot."

Fragrant steam rose from the soup, dotted with emerald-green scallions.

As Evelyn accepted the porcelain bowl, her fingers accidentally brushed against Sebastian's knuckles. She recoiled as if shocked, the tips of her ears turning pink. "Thank you."

Alexander's chopsticks froze mid-air.

He watched helplessly as his sister took small, careful sips of the soup, his Adam's apple bobbing twice. If looks could kill, Sebastian would have been flayed alive by now.

"Valdemar!" he ground out between clenched teeth.

Bianca Savigny stuffed a piece of braised pork into her mouth and mumbled, "Third Young Master, you didn't even know your own sister dislikes onions?"

The words struck Alexander like a dagger to the heart.

He erupted into violent coughs, his eyes reddening. For the first time in twenty years, he realized he didn't know his sister's most basic preferences. When had the little girl who used to trail after him begging for candy grown into this young woman who hesitated to speak her mind around him?

"Drink some soup." Bianca pushed her own bowl toward him.

The surface reflected Alexander's distorted expression. Watching Sebastian's composed movements across the table, he suddenly tasted bitterness on his tongue.

Sebastian was placing a serving of stir-fried seasonal vegetables into Evelyn's bowl.

"Your favorite."

His voice was soft, yet it cut through the silent dining room with crystalline clarity. Evelyn's lashes fluttered, but she didn't look up.

Sophia suddenly laughed. "Third brother, Evelyn has never touched onions since she was seven. Don't you remember that time—"

"I remember!" Alexander shot to his feet, his chair screeching against the floor. His fists clenched bone-white, but when he saw the alarm in his sister's eyes, he slumped back down.

An eerie silence descended over the table.

Evelyn stared at the greens in her bowl, suddenly recalling that rainy night. Sebastian had stood waiting outside the apothecary with an umbrella, holding steaming osmanthus cakes. Back then, he'd said, "I heard you dislike medicine. Sweets can mask bitterness."

So someone had remembered all along.
###Chapter 348

Edward and Sophia Roland exchanged a knowing glance.

Sebastian Valdemar's movements were effortless, as if caring for Evelyn had become second nature.

A complex emotion surged in Edward's chest. He should be happy his daughter was being so well taken care of. So why did his heart feel so heavy?

The dinner table for eight hummed with unspoken tension.

Bianca Savigny bit her chopsticks to suppress a giggle. Sebastian's attention to detail was impeccable—even removing the scallions and garlic Evelyn disliked.

"Try this, Master." Bianca placed a piece of sweet-and-sour pork on Evelyn's plate, not to be outdone.

Alexander Roland quickly followed. "Sis, I've deboned the fish for you."

Evelyn's bowl overflowed. She shook her head in amusement. "Do you all think I'm a pig?"

Amid the laughter, Isabella Langley stabbed her rice repeatedly.

Sophia placed a piece of fish on her plate. "Eat more."

Oliver Valrose was too busy cracking crab legs to notice, his fingers glistening with grease. He finally glanced up at Isabella's reddened eyes. "What's wrong?"

"N-nothing." Isabella forced a smile.

"Too spicy?" Oliver pushed his half-drunk water glass toward her. "Here."

Isabella stared at the smudged rim, stomach churning.

"I'm full." She set down her chopsticks, her voice barely audible.

Oblivious, Oliver stuffed a piece of braised pork into his mouth. "The chef's amazing!"

Bianca nearly choked on her soup, covering her mouth with a napkin.

Sebastian's deft fingers extracted flawless crab meat, placing it on a small plate. He slid it to Evelyn. "Eat it while it's hot."

Sophia nudged her husband's elbow at the sight.

Edward cleared his throat. "Don't let the food get cold."

Oliver finally sensed the tension, wiping his hands awkwardly. "Um...Miss Langley, want some crab roe?"

Isabella's nails dug into her napkin. Across the table, Sebastian leaned close to Evelyn, his gaze unbearably tender.

Meanwhile, her date couldn't even crack a crab shell properly.

"I need the restroom." Isabella stood abruptly, her chair screeching.

Oliver blinked. "Want me to come?"

"No!" She fled before he could finish.

In the restroom mirror, she glared at her bloodshot eyes and splashed icy water on her face. It did nothing to extinguish the fire in her chest.

Why? Why did Evelyn have everything?

Her fist slammed against the marble counter. The pain brought momentary clarity. After reapplying her makeup, she returned just in time to see Sebastian wiping sauce from Evelyn's lips.

That untouchable man handled her like she was made of glass.

Isabella lingered in the shadows, her nails drawing blood from her palms.
###Chapter 349

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting golden pools across the dining room. Isabella Langley stirred her spoon absently in the porcelain bowl.

"Try this, Isabella."

Alexander Roland's elegant fingers slid a perfectly dismantled crab across the table. The meat lay in meticulous rows within its shell. She accepted it gratefully, her fingertips brushing against his knuckles.

"Thank you, Alexander."

Her peripheral vision caught Sebastian Valdemar serving Evelyn Roland with practiced ease. His sculpted hands gleamed pale under the sunlight, the Patek Philippe on his wrist refracting sharp glares.

"The Valrose family specializes in construction materials, correct?"

Alexander's voice carried a thread of amusement. Oliver Valrose immediately straightened, launching into an enthusiastic monologue about his family's enterprises.

The clink of Isabella's spoon against china rang too loud. She watched Sebastian dab sauce from Evelyn's lips, her throat tightening.

"Our new development in the eastern district—"

Oliver continued his grand speech, oblivious to the exchanged glances between the Roland parents. Alexander peeled shrimp with deliberate slowness, his gaze flickering between Sebastian and Oliver.

The former now listened to Evelyn with bowed head, lashes casting delicate shadows. The latter waved his chopsticks, splattering oil stains across the pristine tablecloth.

"It's getting late."

The moment dessert plates were cleared, Alexander smiled at Oliver. Crystal chandelier light fractured across his glasses, obscuring the ice in his eyes.

"Isabella, see our guest out."

She startled to attention. As she rose, her skirt brushed Sebastian's chair. The man didn't even glance up, preoccupied with tucking a stray lock behind Evelyn's ear.

"Oliver—"

Her words died as she caught him staring at Evelyn's décolletage. Sebastian's head snapped up, dark pupils churning with violence.

"Something the matter, Mr. Valrose?"

Evelyn's feather-light voice sent Oliver flushing crimson. Isabella dug nails into her palms, watching Sebastian drape his tailored blazer over Evelyn's shoulders.

That bespoke piece she'd seen in last week's magazine—priced at six figures—now cocooned another woman.

"Little sister looks unwell."

Evelyn turned suddenly, her glassy eyes reflecting Isabella's contorted expression. Oliver had already fled toward the foyer, knocking over a celadon vase.

Alexander removed his glasses, massaging the bridge of his nose. The chandelier stretched his shadow long across the floor.

"Wait for her return."

He murmured to his parents, gaze sliding to where Sebastian fastened a cashmere scarf around Evelyn's neck. The man's aristocratic profile belonged in a museum, yet his fingers moved with impossible tenderness.

The windows mirrored the wreckage—spilled wine bleeding across marble tiles like fresh wounds.
###Chapter 350

"Evelyn!"

"All men are liars, remember that!"

The moment Alexander Roland blurted this out, he realized he'd just insulted himself and Edward. His parents' sharp gazes immediately pinned him down.

"Except the Roland men, of course." He quickly amended with an ingratiating smile.

Evelyn Roland pressed her lips together, blinking innocently.

"Evelyn, keep your eyes open. Don't fall for sweet words and cheap gifts. You're too young to rush into marriage. Even if you never marry, this family will always take care of you."

Evelyn detected the hidden meaning in her brother's words but chose to play along. If Alexander wanted games, she'd indulge him.

"Nonsense! Just because you can't find a girlfriend doesn't mean you should stop your sister," Sophia Roland chided, rising to swat his shoulder with a warning glare.

"Evelyn, please entertain Sebastian and Bianca. Your father and I need to rest."

Sebastian Valdemar remained seated on the sofa. Alexander tried to linger, but a large hand gripped his collar.

"Dad?" He turned to see Edward.

"Come to the study. We need to talk."

"Dad!"

Alexander was practically dragged upstairs, still shouting over his shoulder, "Remember what I said, little sister!"

"Finally, some peace."

Bianca Savigny exhaled in relief, rubbing her ears.

"Master, I'd like to explore the estate."

Sensing Sebastian needed privacy, she tactfully excused herself.

"Care for a walk?"

Evelyn stood, studying the unusually quiet man.

"Alright."

The sunset bathed Blenheim Palace in golden hues as they strolled along the cobblestone path.

Sebastian watched Evelyn's slender silhouette ahead, his lips pressed tight, hesitation flickering in his eyes.

She turned abruptly, catching his conflicted expression.

"Something on your mind? Spit it out." Her smile was light.

Taking a deep breath, he finally spoke. "Miss Roland, please review this first."

Evelyn studied him briefly before accepting his phone.

"These photos were taken during the poisoned wine incident. The man is my uncle, Vincent."

He'd spent days investigating every detail. Though Daniel Murphy had been arrested, Sebastian couldn't face Evelyn until his uncle's innocence was confirmed.

The timestamped images clearly showed Vincent's alibi.

"This matter never concerned you. You didn't need to trouble yourself," she murmured.

"I had to know the truth." His voice was grave.

"Now that it's settled, you should put it behind you."

"Shall we continue?"

Evelyn absently touched her stomach. The evening stroll would help digest dinner. Vincent's involvement was but a pebble dropped into still waters—barely causing a ripple in her heart.
###Chapter 351

The twilight air at Rosewood Manor was heavy with the intoxicating scent of roses. Sebastian Valdemar's polished leather shoes made soft clicking sounds against the cobblestone path. He deliberately slowed his pace, just to walk a little longer beside Evelyn Roland.

"Miss Roland."

Evelyn, absorbed in her phone, didn't turn around.

"Evelyn."

The tender address made her freeze mid-step.

"Were you calling me, Mr. Valdemar?"

She turned, her hair swaying in an elegant arc. Her calm eyes revealed nothing. Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed as he wondered if she'd heard the intimate nickname.

"You seem different today."

Evelyn stared straight into his eyes, as if trying to decipher something. Suddenly, Sebastian felt his dress shirt collar tighten. His fingers absently traced the edges of his cufflinks.

The mighty CEO of Valdemar Group, who commanded boardrooms with ease, now fumbled like a lovestruck teenager.

A rustling came from the rose bushes. He drew a deep breath, ready to speak—

"Evelyn!"
"Little sister!"

Two tall figures emerged through the blossoms. Alexander Roland subtly positioned himself between them, while Julian Roland slung a protective arm around his sister's shoulders.

"What were you about to say, Mr. Valdemar?"

Evelyn peered out from her brother's embrace. Sebastian eyed the human barricade before him and gave a wry smile. "I was hoping Miss Roland could schedule another checkup."

"I'm free tomorrow morning." The moment she spoke, Alexander cleared his throat. "The wind's picking up. You look pale, Mr. Valdemar."

In the fading light, Sebastian's face did appear ashen—yet his gaze burned. "Thanks to Miss Roland's care, I'm much improved."

"Persistent as a barnacle," Alexander muttered under his breath. Just then, delicate raindrops began to fall, glistening on Evelyn's lashes.

"It's raining." She lifted a hand to catch the droplets. The jade bracelet on her wrist glowed softly in the mist.

In perfect synchronization, the Roland brothers shrugged off their jackets, creating an impromptu canopy over her.

Sebastian remained rooted to the spot, watching the trio disappear into the distance. Rain trailed down his jawline—whether from the storm or cold sweat, he couldn't tell. His fist clenched involuntarily.

A rose thorn pierced his palm. Crimson blood mixed with rainwater, staining the cobblestones below.
###Chapter 352

Raindrops pounded against the car window. Sebastian Valdemar's grip tightened on the steering wheel as he watched the Roland family villa shrink in the rearview mirror.

"Mr. Valdemar, should I have someone monitor the Rolands?" His assistant spoke cautiously from the passenger seat.

Sebastian's gaze remained fixed ahead. "Unnecessary."

The engine roared to life. Windshield wipers carved arcs through the downpour. This sudden storm mirrored his aborted confession.

Upstairs, a curtain fluttered. Evelyn Roland's silhouette vanished as quickly as it appeared.

"Master Julian, Mr. Valdemar has departed," the butler murmured.

Julian Roland stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, the ember of his cigarette pulsing like a dying star. "Investigate the Valdemars' recent activities."

In the dining room, Evelyn stabbed her fork into a slice of fruit.

"Evelyn." Julian took the seat across from her. "About Sebastian—"

"Brother." She cut him off. "I know my limits."

Their silent standoff lasted three heartbeats before Julian exhaled sharply.

Footsteps pattered down the staircase. Isabella Langley entered, her dress dripping onto the marble.

"Sister." Her saccharine voice made Evelyn's teeth ache. "May I borrow something to wear?"

Evelyn didn't glance up. "Guest room closet. Help yourself."

"But..." Isabella bit her lip. "I wanted one of yours."

The fork clinked against porcelain.

"Isabella." Evelyn finally met her gaze. "Does your boyfriend know you wear other women's clothes at midnight?"

Isabella's face drained of color.

"Funny coincidence." Evelyn dabbed her lips with a napkin. "Sebastian was just here discussing that bid your lover wants from Valdemar Group."

"You—" Isabella's nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Julian stood abruptly. "Enough. Both of you—bed. Now."

Rain drummed louder as Evelyn leaned against the corridor wall, watching Isabella flee like a startled rabbit.

Her phone vibrated. Sebastian's message glowed: [See you tomorrow]

She stared at those three words until her reflection blurred in the dark screen. Then powered it off.
###Chapter 353

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the Roland family dining room.

Isabella Langley fluttered around Evelyn Roland in her pink loungewear. "Sister, try this fried egg. I made it with a runny yolk just for you."

She pushed a milk glass toward Evelyn, its rim smudged with lipstick.

Evelyn's fingers tapped lightly on the table as she studied the red stain. "Why so attentive today?"

"We haven't gone shopping together in ages." Isabella batted her innocent doe eyes. "Come with me to the new mall this weekend?"

Across the table, Sophia Roland smiled approvingly. "Evelyn, do spend more time with your sister."

Edward Roland set down his newspaper, his gaze shifting between them behind his glasses. "Yes, it's good for sisters to bond."

Evelyn methodically cut into her egg, watching yolk spill across the porcelain plate. "I'm quite busy lately."

"Then I'll visit you at the vineyard!" Isabella's voice rose before she hastily lowered it. "May I?"

Silence fell over the dining room.

Evelyn lifted her eyes, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "As you wish."

After breakfast, the butler directed servants to load tonics into Evelyn's trunk. "Miss, these bird's nests were specially prepared by Madam."

"Thank you." Evelyn fastened her seatbelt, catching Isabella's waving figure in the rearview mirror.

Only when the black sedan disappeared beyond the gates did Isabella's smile vanish.

She hurried to her room, changed into a Chanel suit, and touched up her makeup.

Once certain the household had emptied, she grabbed her car keys and headed straight for the underground garage.

Her GPS led to an ordinary residential district in the east city. Isabella's hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel.

"This place..." She frowned at the peeling stairwell, her heels clicking sharply on the concrete steps.

The doorbell rang three times before anyone answered.

"Who is it?" A housekeeper in an apron eyed her suspiciously.

Isabella instinctively stepped back. "I'm here to see Mrs. Lydia Valrose."

"Madam is still doing her facial." The housekeeper let her in. "Wait here."

The cracked leather sofa and cheap fruit arrangement made Isabella grimace. She flicked a throw pillow aside with her fingertips.

"Well, who do we have here?"

A woman in a wrinkled LV dress emerged, her face mask still damp.

Isabella rose, nails digging into her palms. "Are you Owen Valrose's wife?"

"That's right." Lydia tore off the mask, then froze. "Wait—your face..."

She leaned in abruptly, overwhelming perfume assaulting Isabella's senses. "You can't be... Isabella?"

Isabella turned deathly pale. This woman reeking of drugstore perfume had recognized her instantly.
###Chapter 354 

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into Château Blanc's reception room. Evelyn Roland's slender fingers tapped lightly against her wine glass.

"Beverly Hills?"

Her eyebrow arched as a faint smirk played on her lips.

Even the servants under her name wouldn't deign to live in that neighborhood. Yet Isabella Langley had come in person.

"Should we investigate, ma'am?" her assistant asked cautiously.

Evelyn leaned back into the leather sofa, twirling a lock of hair around her finger.

"Unnecessary."

She took a sip of wine, amber eyes glinting with amusement.

Isabella's recent behavior had been... peculiar.

First the sudden boyfriend. Now this questionable location.

"Keep watching her."

The moment her assistant left, Evelyn's phone lit up.

Oliver Valrose's name flashed across the screen.

Her expression frosted over as she flipped the phone face down.

With the International Wine Tasting Championship approaching, she had no patience for these petty games.

Meanwhile, in a Beverly Hills living room, Lydia Valrose eagerly peeled an apple for Isabella.

"Try this, dear. Imported."

Isabella stared at the woman who was both familiar and strange, her fingers tightening around her skirt.

"I came here to say—"

The front door burst open before she could finish.

Owen Valrose rushed in, breathless, his gaze locked onto Isabella.

"The resemblance... uncanny!"

He rubbed his hands excitedly, only to be doused by her next words.

"I'm terminating my engagement to Oliver Valrose."

The air turned to ice.

Lydia's fruit knife clattered to the floor.

Owen's face contorted through several expressions before settling on a grotesque smile.

"Now, now, sweetheart, let's not be hasty—"

He moved closer, his overpowering cologne making Isabella recoil.

"You're the Roland family's golden child now. We'll take our time with the... reunion."

Isabella shot up, her chair screeching against the hardwood.

"Are you insane? That's incest!"

Lydia suddenly grabbed her wrist, nails digging into flesh.

"Don't be silly! Cousins married all the time in ancient days!"

Isabella's stomach churned.

Staring at their greedy, twisted faces, she realized the abyss she'd stepped into.
###Chapter 355

Isabella Langley's fingers trembled uncontrollably as she stepped out of the Beverly Hills gated community.

Her knuckles turned white from gripping the steering wheel too tightly.

The absurd words of that couple still echoed in her mind like a surreal nightmare.

Had she known this would happen, she would never have come here so recklessly.

The fear of being exposed while trying to break off the engagement coiled around her like a venomous snake.

The white villa gleamed blindingly under the sunlight. Isabella bit her lower lip, but there was no one she could confide in.

Valdemar Group Headquarters.

The lobby was unusually quiet during the lunch hour.

Evelyn Roland glanced around but didn't see the receptionist from last time.

She walked straight toward the CEO's private elevator.

"Miss!" The new receptionist hurried after her in panic. "That's the executive elevator."

Evelyn studied the unfamiliar face before her.

"Are you new here?" The corner of her lips lifted slightly. "I'm practically a regular."

Just as the receptionist was about to protest, her eyes widened in surprise.

Theodore Ashcroft approached swiftly and respectfully took Evelyn's handbag.

Before the elevator doors closed, Evelyn didn't notice the two pairs of eyes watching her from around the corner.

"Evelyn?"

Olivia Valdemar's voice made Evelyn pause mid-step.

"Just delivering some reports." She nodded calmly, her gaze lingering briefly on Vincent Valdemar.

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Vincent's eyes. "Miss Roland, it's been a while."

"Thanks to you." Her tone remained even.

Olivia enthusiastically linked arms with her. "Perfect timing! Let's have lunch together."

Inside the office, the quarterly financial statements for Château Blanc were spread across the desk.

"This... is just one quarter's revenue?" Olivia flipped through the documents in disbelief.

Evelyn pulled up the stock performance chart—the line shot upward like a rocket.

"My God!" Olivia's eyes sparkled with excitement.

Even the usually composed Theodore couldn't hide his astonishment.

Vincent stared at the report, his expression inscrutable.
###Chapter 356

The quarterly report of Château Blanc lay on the desk, its numbers glaringly impressive.

In just three months, revenue had more than doubled.

Evelyn Roland's slender fingers traced the figures on the report, a flicker of satisfaction in her eyes. Who could have predicted this turnaround when the winery was on the brink of bankruptcy?

"Ms. Roland, Ms. Valdemar is here," the secretary murmured.

Olivia Valdemar strode in on high heels, her face alight with unrestrained joy. She seized Evelyn's hands, studying her intently.

"Evelyn, you're nothing short of miraculous!" Olivia's voice trembled. "Not only did you save the winery, but—"

Her words caught in her throat.

Evelyn patted her hand gently and offered her a glass of water.

"Theodore can say 'Mama' now," Olivia finally managed, eyes glistening. "The doctors say his recovery is nothing short of a miracle."

Vincent Valdemar's teacup clattered onto the table.

"Theodore is better?" His voice was sharp before he cleared his throat, regaining composure. "I mean, that's wonderful news."

Olivia nodded with a smile. "All thanks to Evelyn. The little one keeps asking for 'Aunt Evelyn' every day."

She pulled a velvet box from her bag and slid it toward Evelyn.

The moment the lid lifted, sunlight danced across the surface of a rare pink diamond. Evelyn's pupils contracted—this was the very gem her third brother had once coveted but failed to obtain.

"This is too extravagant," Evelyn said, closing the box, her fingertips cooling.

Olivia clasped her hand. "Compared to Theodore's health, it's nothing."

As they exchanged polite refusals, Sebastian Valdemar interjected smoothly, "Accept it. It's the Valdemar family's gratitude."

Evelyn's gaze flickered to Vincent. He was staring into his tea, knuckles white with suppressed tension.

"Then I'll graciously accept," she said finally, her fingers brushing the diamond's surface.

Vincent suddenly stood. "Since we're all here, allow me to host a dinner for Ms. Roland." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Consider it... a thank-you banquet."

Evelyn met his gaze with a faint smile. "You're too kind, Uncle Vincent."

The atmosphere in the private room grew subtly charged. Oblivious, Olivia chattered excitedly about restaurant options. Sebastian observed the exchange thoughtfully, fingers tapping the table.

"I know a newly opened private kitchen..." Vincent's voice carried a veiled probe.

Evelyn lifted her teacup. Through the rising steam, she caught a dark glint in Vincent's eyes behind his glasses.
###Chapter 357

At the restaurant entrance, Vincent Valdemar's gaze briefly flickered over Evelyn Roland and Olivia Valdemar embracing.

His lips curved into a smile that didn't reach his eyes.

"Miss Roland, until we meet again."

"Hmm."

Evelyn responded coolly, her expression distant.

"Drive safely."

Sebastian Valdemar watched Evelyn's retreating figure, his eyes betraying an unmistakable longing.

The moment Evelyn's car disappeared from view, Vincent sped back to his private villa.

The mask of composure shattered the instant he stepped into his study.

"Useless!"

A crystal glass shattered against the wall, shards scattering like shrapnel.

The news of Theodore's recovery was a thorn lodged deep in his heart.

"Sir, we—" His assistant trembled as he spoke.

"Dig up everything on Evelyn Roland." Vincent's knuckles turned white. "How dare some naive girl interfere with my plans?"

He yanked his tie loose, murderous intent swirling in his eyes.

"The birthday gala for Mr. Valdemar..." the assistant cautiously reminded him.

Vincent suddenly laughed, the sound chilling to the bone.

"Prepare a grand gift."

Meanwhile, the kitchens of Château Blanc buzzed with activity.

Bianca Savigny directed the staff in decorating the venue when hushed whispers caught her ear from around the corner.

"I heard Mr. Valdemar adores Blue Enigma roses..."

"I secured a limited-edition watch..."

Bianca arched a brow and dialed Evelyn's number.

"Evelyn, someone's trying to steal your man."

A soft chuckle came through the line. "Let them try."

At precisely 6 p.m., the elevator lobby of Valdemar Group erupted in murmurs.

"Mr. Valdemar left early?!"

"Is the sky falling?"

Sebastian nodded at the stunned employees—a rare gesture—before stepping briskly into his private elevator.

"To the château."

Theodore Ashcroft's grip on the steering wheel faltered. "But today isn't—"

The rearview mirror reflected the anticipation glowing in his employer's eyes.

7:15 p.m. A black Maybach glided to a stop before Château Blanc.

The grand hall stood empty when Sebastian pushed open the doors—just flickering candlelight greeting him.
###Chapter 358

"Miss Roland?"

Darkness swallowed the living room without warning.

"Happy birthday to you..." A soft melody floated through the blackness. Evelyn Roland emerged, pushing a three-tiered cake while Bianca Savigny clapped and sang beside her.

When the lights flickered back on, Sebastian Valdemar's gaze locked onto the exquisite racing car model beside the cake.

His breathing hitched. Slender fingers clamped around his own throat, knuckles bleaching white.

"Cough... cough..."

The violent fit finally drew Evelyn's attention. She rushed forward—then froze.

Under the chandelier, Sebastian's face had turned deathly pale. Veins throbbed at his temples. But his eyes...

The whites had drowned in blood-red.

"Your eyes—"

Theodore Ashcroft arrived just as the crimson pupils swung toward him. The loyal assistant staggered. In all his years of service, he'd never witnessed this nightmare.

Sebastian radiated pure menace now, those hellish eyes scanning between Evelyn and Theodore with visible agony.

"Sir—"

A guttural roar cut him off. "OUT!"

Evelyn's voice cracked like a whip. "Sebastian!"

The red deepened to molten lava.

Her outstretched hand triggered an explosion. He lunged at the cake stand, upending it. Frosting splattered across hardwood as the racing model crashed down—miraculously intact.

Sebastian's pupils contracted. He snatched it up and smashed it against the floor with primal force.

Crash.

The shattering plastic seemed to satisfy some dark hunger. Bianca muffled a scream. Theodore stood paralyzed.

"GET OUT!"

A vase hurtled toward the doorway. Theodore barely dodged as porcelain shrapnel exploded at his feet.

Evelyn turned on her heel, the faintest red tingeing her own eyes.

"Master!" Bianca scrambled after her.

Only wreckage remained—and Sebastian standing amidst the debris, those unholy crimson eyes glowing in the light.
###Chapter 359

The three figures stood in tense silence outside the door. Theodore's gaze flickered between Evelyn and Bianca before he finally lowered his eyes without a word.

Evelyn's sharp eyes raked over his face, her expression icy.

Her voice was frigid as she stared at the closed living room door. "How long has he been like this?"

Theodore shook his head helplessly.

"Master!" Bianca suddenly exploded. "That racing model took you three sleepless nights to build, and he smashed it without even looking!" Her fists clenched audibly. "I'm going to teach him a lesson!"

"Stop."

Evelyn raised a hand to block her. The earlier anger had faded into deep contemplation. Her fingers brushed the doorframe thoughtfully. "Something's wrong."

Sebastian's abrupt change was too sudden—too much like a post-traumatic stress episode.

But what had triggered it?

"Master?"

"Wait here."

Bianca froze mid-step under Evelyn's piercing glare.

"...Yes."

The moment the living room door reopened, the man curled in the corner jerked his head up. Wild strands of hair framed his bloodshot eyes, which dilated at the sight of Evelyn.

"Get out!"

Sebastian's roar carried the metallic tang of blood.

Evelyn remained unmoved.

"I'll kill you if you don't leave!" He clawed at his hair, his vision doubling. His sanity teetered on the edge. He couldn't let her see him like this.

"Sebastian." She stepped forward, her lab coat brushing through the wreckage. "Last warning."

A shard of porcelain flashed. She slit her index finger and pressed the bleeding digit to his lips.

"Drink."

The scent of blood hit his nostrils. His Adam's apple convulsed violently. Primal hunger shattered his restraint. He seized her wrist, fangs sinking into her flesh.

Evelyn didn't even flinch.

As the swallowing sounds filled the room, the crimson faded from his eyes. When his teeth finally released her, he collapsed against her like a boneless beast.

"Ev..."

Before he could finish, darkness claimed him.

The two figures outside sprang to their feet.

"Master!"

"Dr. Roland!"

"Take him to the bedroom." She shook her bloodied hand and turned to Theodore. "Prepare a sedative. He could relapse at any moment."
###Chapter 360

The main house was meticulously designed. Beyond Evelyn Roland and Bianca Savigny's bedrooms, there were elegant guest rooms and a refined sitting area.

Theodore Ashcroft struggled to carry the unconscious man into the guest room, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. He glanced at his boss's furrowed brow but hesitated to speak.

"Stay here and watch over him."
"Thank you, Miss Roland."

Though he didn't understand why his boss had suddenly calmed down, Theodore was certain Evelyn had something to do with it.

"Master, what's going on?" Bianca whispered. "I've never seen Mr. Valdemar like this before."

Evelyn's fingers curled slightly. She was just as curious, but now wasn't the time to question the man in question.

The sharp ring of the phone shattered the silence.

"Olivia?"

"Evelyn, is Sebastian at the vineyard?" Olivia Valdemar's voice trembled with barely concealed anxiety.

"Yes. He just fell asleep."

"Oh, thank God he's with you." Olivia's voice suddenly rose. "Wait—asleep? What happened?"

Evelyn recounted the events truthfully.

A heavy sigh traveled through the line.

"Today... is the anniversary of my parents' death."

Evelyn's pupils constricted. The answer hit her like a sledgehammer to the chest.

"Please take care of him." Olivia's voice cracked as she finally revealed the painful past she'd kept buried for years.

"They were rushing back for Sebastian's birthday that day, but..." Her words grew fainter. "He waited all night. The next morning, all he got was..."

The cold image of the morgue flashed through Olivia's mind. She still remembered the hollow look in her brother's eyes.

"After that, he became hypersensitive to anything related to cars."

Evelyn's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. Now she understood why Sebastian had reacted that way to the cake model.

"Olivia, I'm so sorry..."

After hanging up, Evelyn's gaze lingered on the second-floor guest room. What kind of pain was that man carrying?

"Bianca, go make some porridge."

Bianca blinked. "For who?"

"Just do it." Evelyn's voice was soft. "I'll explain later."

With reluctant steps, Bianca turned away, her heart heavy. But she couldn't disobey her master's orders.
###Chapter 361

The night was heavy with silence. Evelyn Roland stood outside the guest bedroom door, a bowl of warm porridge in her hands. Her knuckles rapped lightly against the wood.

No response.

She knocked again, three firm strikes.

A sliver of light finally seeped through the crack beneath the door.

Pushing it open, she found only Sebastian Valdemar inside. Theodore Ashcroft had slipped away at some point.

When Sebastian lifted his gaze, Evelyn's breath caught. His usually playful eyes were bloodshot, his jaw shadowed with stubble. He looked hollow, as if the life had been drained from him.

"Eat something," she murmured, setting the porcelain bowl on the nightstand.

He remained motionless, a statue carved from grief.

The acrid scent of tobacco stung her throat. Covering her mouth, she coughed lightly. The ashtray overflowed with cigarette butts—a tiny graveyard of spent sorrows.

Without a word, she crossed to the window and pushed it open. The night air rushed in, carrying the crispness of dew.

"You know now." His voice was raw, barely recognizable.

"Yes." She saw no point in lying.

Had fate not intervened, this secret might have stayed buried forever.

Sebastian's lips twisted into something that wasn't quite a smile. It was uglier than tears.

"Don't force it," she said before she could stop herself.

His shoulders stiffened.

"Sorry." The word scraped from his throat like gravel.

Silence thickened between them. Then, abruptly, he spoke again: "Want to hear a story?"

Evelyn blinked.

"About... my parents."

She noticed his trembling fingers.

"Okay."

They moved to the balcony. Sebastian stared at the distant city lights, his eyes glistening. Moonlight carved harsh lines into his profile.

"It was my seventh birthday," he began softly. "A stormy night. They insisted on driving home."

Evelyn's fingers curled into her sleeves.

"The police said both vehicles were crushed beyond recognition." A hollow laugh escaped him. "Funny, isn't it? Living, breathing people... reduced to weight measurements."

"The driver who hit them—"

"Died on impact." Darkness flickered in Sebastian's gaze. "Everything pointed to an accident."

The wind tousled his hair.

"But I never believed that." He turned to face her, embers of defiance burning in his eyes. "Just like you digging into the Rolands' secrets—some truths... you have to unearth them yourself."

Evelyn's breath hitched. This version of Sebastian reminded her of a wounded beast, battered but refusing to surrender.

Suddenly, she remembered that rainy night when he'd approached her under his black umbrella. Now she understood—beneath those sheltering ribs had always lain wounds far deeper than she'd imagined.
###Chapter 362

"Miss Roland, don't look at me like that."

Sebastian Valdemar tilted his head slightly, avoiding her probing gaze. His slender fingers traced the rim of the porcelain cup absently. The tea inside had long gone cold.

"I'm not that fragile."

His voice was soft, as if afraid to disturb something unseen.

"Did I scare you?"

Evelyn Roland shook her head, her fingertips brushing the leather armrest unconsciously. The cool texture grounded her.

"So, you gave up racing because of that accident?"

She cut straight to the point.

Sebastian's pupils constricted.

"Racing?"

A cold laugh escaped him, his knuckles whitening.

"I never liked that nonsense."

"After the crash, I couldn't even stand touching a steering wheel."

Evelyn caught the contradiction instantly. If he truly despised it, their chance meeting at Château Blanc made no sense.

How had Bianca Savigny known his birthday?

The timing and location were too precise.

Something wasn't right...

A chill ran down her spine. It felt like unseen eyes watched them—not just her, but Château Blanc, even the entire Valdemar family.

"What's wrong?"

Sebastian frowned at her sudden tension.

"Nothing."

She forced a weak smile.

He didn't press further, simply pushing a bowl of steaming congee toward her.

"Try it."

The aroma of rice mingled with seafood filled the air.

"Thank you."

He took a spoonful. The warmth sliding down his throat brought an unfamiliar peace.

This was the first anniversary of the crash without nightmares.

All because of the woman before him.

"Miss Roland."

He set down the spoon abruptly, his gaze intense.

"Come meet my parents with me."

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Their eyes locked. Her pulse roared in her ears.

"I..."

Sebastian leaned forward, his Adam's apple bobbing. Years of suppressed emotions threatened to spill over.

Bang!

The door burst open.

Olivia Valdemar gripped the doorframe, chest heaving. Her darting eyes landed on Sebastian.

"Sebastian..."

Her voice trembled.

Sebastian's expression darkened instantly, his knuckles cracking under the strain.
###Chapter 363

Sebastian Valdemar's hand hovered midair, fingers trembling slightly.

His gaze locked with Olivia Valdemar's eyes, brimming with concern. Words formed then dissolved on his lips, ending in a soft sigh.

"I'm fine now."

Olivia's eyes darted between her brother and Evelyn Roland. A realization dawned. She took half a step back, her heel scraping the carpet.

"I seem to be interrupting."

Evelyn caught her sleeve. "Don't go, Olivia."

Sebastian stood by the window, sunlight casting shadows across his chiseled profile. A rare smile touched his lips—one reserved only for family.

Olivia's eyes instantly reddened. She remembered past years when her brother would curl alone in darkness on this date. Now, the storm in his eyes had nearly cleared.

"Evelyn..." Her voice cracked.

Evelyn squirmed under the intense gaze, sipping her tea to avoid eye contact.

Olivia smoothly changed the subject to trivial matters. As she left, she flashed Evelyn a discreet thumbs-up.

The click of the door brought silence. Sebastian adjusted his wristwatch, the interrupted confession stuck like a fishbone in his throat.

Night fell quietly on July fifth.

Meanwhile, the sound of shattering porcelain echoed through the Valrose family villa.

"Outrageous!" Owen Valrose hurled his briefcase onto the sofa.

Lydia Valrose's hands trembled around the fruit tray. "What now?"

"Valdemar Group snatched the East District land!" Owen yanked his tie loose. "The contract was supposed to sign today..."

Lydia's eyes gleamed. "Get Isabella involved. She's the Langley family's golden girl now."

Owen stopped pacing. A calculating glint surfaced in his murky eyes.

"We visit the Rolands tomorrow."

At dawn, Owen paced outside Blenheim Palace's gates. The security camera's unblinking lens tracked him while guards watched like he was a convict.

"That wretched girl..." He redialed the unanswered call for the twentieth time.

Meanwhile, Isabella Langley lounged in a nest of goose-down blankets. Sunlight filtered through sheer curtains, dappling her delicate collarbone.

"Miss, your bird's nest soup is ready."

She stretched, silk nightgown slipping off one shoulder. "Where are Mother and Father?"

"At the office since dawn." A maid drew the curtains. "Young Master Alexander mentioned taking you to the fashion show tonight."

Isabella's bare feet sank into wool carpet. Suddenly remembering, she checked her silenced phone. Twenty-three missed calls glowed on the screen.
###Chapter 364

"I'm visiting Evelyn at noon. Don't prepare lunch for me."

The sunlight was perfect as Isabella Langley impulsively decided to visit Château Blanc.

Her car had just passed through the estate gates when a black sedan abruptly blocked her path.

"Sweetheart Isabella!"

That voice made her slam the brakes. Behind her sunglasses, her pupils constricted sharply.

Owen Valrose's greasy face leaned out from the car window.

She immediately shifted into reverse, spinning the steering wheel frantically.

"Ungrateful brat!"

Owen chased after her in a rage, the two vehicles engaged in a high-speed pursuit down the road.

Finally forced to pull over, Isabella glared icily at the man who called himself her father.

"Nice car," Owen eyed her vehicle greedily. "Did you buy it yourself?"

"None of your business."

"Watch your tone! I'm your father!" Owen forced a smile. "Isabella, dear, I'm in a bit of trouble..."

Isabella suddenly laughed, the sound laced with biting coldness.

"Of course. You never show up unless you want something."

Owen's expression stiffened before he plastered on another smile. "The family business is struggling. Could you help out?"

"Dream on!"

She turned to get back in her car but was yanked back by the arm.

"How dare you speak to me like that?" Owen finally dropped the act. "I could make sure you're kicked out of the Roland family!"

Isabella's stiletto heel came down hard on his foot.

As Owen howled in pain, she swiftly started the engine and sped away.

At the winery entrance, Isabella immediately spotted Evelyn Roland sipping wine.

She rushed over like a drowning woman clutching at driftwood, nearly knocking Bianca Savigny off balance.

"Big sister~"

The sickeningly sweet tone made Evelyn's eyebrow twitch.

"Let go."

Isabella only clung tighter, her voice trembling. "Save me, sister..."

Bianca gaped at the scene, her wineglass almost slipping from her fingers.

"Bianca," Evelyn said coldly. "Remove her."

Reluctantly, Isabella released her grip—only to meet Evelyn's piercing gaze.

Those eyes were filled with suspicion and warning.
###Chapter 365

"Evelyn, may I stay at Château Blanc for a few days?"

Isabella Langley's voice was sweet and soft, but her eyes flickered with unease.

Evelyn Roland set down her wine glass and exchanged a glance with Bianca Savigny.

In the past, she might have agreed to her sister's small request without hesitation.

But times had changed.

The International Wine Tasting Championship was about to resume, and even the slightest disturbance could undo all their hard work.

"No."

"Evelyn!"

Isabella's eyes immediately welled up with tears as she tugged at her sister's sleeve, whining like a child. She deliberately softened her voice, swaying Evelyn's arm just as she used to when they were younger.

Evelyn remained unmoved, calmly withdrawing her hand.

"Was there anything else?"

The dismissal was clear. Isabella felt blood rush to her head, her nails digging into her palms to keep her expression in check.

She lowered her lashes, the long strands shielding the venom in her eyes.

"Then I'll take my leave, Evelyn."

As she turned, she sensed a sharp gaze boring into her back.

Evelyn watched her sister's retreating figure with an unreadable smile, her fingers lightly tapping the table.

Her sister's restraint was more impressive than she'd expected.

Isabella nearly fled in panic.

She always felt as if Evelyn's piercing eyes could see through every facade, leaving her nowhere to hide.

Bang!

The car door slammed shut.

Inside the confined space, Isabella let out a hysterical scream, her flawless makeup twisting with rage.

"Evelyn Roland! Just you wait!"

She pounded the steering wheel until her hands turned red.

Meanwhile, the Valrose residence in Beverly Hills blazed with light.

"What do we do now?"

Lydia Valrose paced anxiously, her stilettos clicking rapidly against the floor.

Owen Valrose hurled his glass onto the coffee table.

"This is all your daughter's fault! That ungrateful wretch!"

Shards of glass scattered, making the servants flinch and lower their heads.

Lydia's face darkened, and she shot a venomous glare at the curious staff.

"Keep staring, and I'll pluck your eyes out!"

She stormed upstairs, each step reverberating as if she meant to shatter the floor.

The next morning, Isabella fidgeted restlessly in the manor.

Her phone buzzed—an unknown number sent a message that chilled her to the bone.

"Same place. One hour."

Her fingers clenched around the device, knuckles whitening.

"Why won't they just leave me alone..."

Half an hour later, in a secluded corner of a café.

Isabella stared blankly at the middle-aged couple across from her.

"Lydia, Owen, don't push your luck."

"Is that any way to speak to your parents?" Lydia smiled sweetly, but her voice dripped with venom. "We could always pay the Rolands a visit and discuss your... origins."

Cold sweat trickled down Isabella's back, but she forced a mocking laugh.

"What do you want?"

Owen stirred his coffee leisurely.

"Simple. Make the Rolands cooperate with us."

Isabella sucked in a sharp breath.

This was pure delusion.
###Chapter 366

"I have no influence over the Roland Group's affairs."

Owen Valrose's face darkened instantly. This adopted daughter was utterly useless.

"No power? Then just give me money!" He held up five fingers. "This amount."

Isabella Langley's pupils constricted. "Five hundred thousand?"

"Fifty million!" Owen sneered. "For a spoiled heiress like you, that's just pocket change."

Pocket change? Isabella nearly ground her teeth to dust.

"If you don't pay today, you're not leaving this room." Owen's smile turned sinister. "We're capable of anything."

"You wouldn't dare!"

"Seems you don't know us well enough."

Owen tossed a document onto the table. The words "Paternity Test" burned Isabella's eyes.

"Go ahead, tear it up. I made a dozen copies." He crossed his legs leisurely.

"You're monsters!"

"Isabella, we're desperate." Lydia Valrose fake-wiped her tears.

Isabella clenched her fists. "Fine. I'll pay. But if one word of my origins leaks out, I'll make your lives hell."

"Words mean nothing. Sign this." Owen produced another contract like a magician.

Isabella signed with a cold laugh and stormed out, slamming the door.

Owen stroked the agreement, grinning from ear to ear.

Back home, Isabella pummeled a pillow until feathers flew. Fifty million! Where would she get that kind of money?

At dinner, she eagerly served Sophia and Edward Roland.

"Mom, Dad, I'd like to start working at the company."

"The company?"

A crisp female voice came from the doorway. Evelyn Roland leaned against the frame, smirking.

"Sister!" Isabella's chopsticks clattered to the floor.

"Just came back for something." Evelyn's gaze swept over her sister's face. "Perfect timing, it seems."
###Chapter 367

"Why the sudden interest in joining the company?"

Isabella Langley lowered her head, fingers twisting the hem of her dress. "Mom, Dad, I know I'm not as smart as my siblings, but I want to contribute too. I majored in finance..."

The feigned humility drew a flicker of mockery in Evelyn Roland's eyes.

Her sister's acting skills had improved.

Hollywood owed her an Oscar.

Sophia Roland and Edward Roland exchanged glances, studying Isabella for a long moment.

"I've thought this through," Isabella suddenly lifted her head, determination flashing in her eyes. "I want to build a future with Oliver Valrose. Joining the company will help me learn."

At the mention of Oliver, Evelyn's brow twitched imperceptibly.

"Are you sure?" Sophia's voice turned heavy.

The couple despised Oliver. That polished gentleman didn't even spare their daughter a second glance.

"I agree."

Evelyn's voice cut through the silence.

"Sister?" Isabella gaped, disbelief written across her face.

"Evelyn?" Her parents turned to their eldest daughter in surprise.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "If Isabella is serious, let her try. Starting from the bottom will be good experience."

The bottom?

Isabella's smile faltered before she forced sweetness back into it. "Thank you, Sister. You're always so kind to me."

But her eyes darkened with malice.

The decision was made. Isabella was assigned a junior supervisor role in the finance department, starting the following week.

On the second of May, the day of Mount Pilatus' annual Blessing Ceremony, the foot of the mountain swarmed with business elites.

"Everyone here?" An elderly man scanned the crowd. "Then let's begin."

The Roland family of six chatted amiably as they climbed. Oliver trailed behind like an outsider.

"Miss Roland."

A deep voice called from behind. Sebastian Valdemar had caught up, beads of sweat glistening at his temples.

"Mr. Valdemar." Evelyn nodded politely.

The surrounding tycoons stole glances. Everyone knew the Valdemar CEO's icy reputation—since when did he chase after anyone?

The Roland brothers immediately stepped between their sister and him.

"Mind your own business, Mr. Valdemar," Alexander Roland said coldly.

Sebastian's gaze darkened, but he still reached for Evelyn's bag. "The path is steep. Let me carry this for you."
###Chapter 368

The backpack was halfway handed over when a large, well-defined hand snatched it midair.

Alexander Roland dangled the backpack strap between his fingers, giving Sebastian Valdemar a pointed look.

This guy wasn’t even trying to hide his obvious favoritism.

The Roland brothers exchanged a glance, silently agreeing on their next move.

Sebastian felt the weight of their stares burning into his back. He stiffened but kept walking, pretending not to notice.

At the rear of the group, Isabella Langley gazed longingly at his retreating figure. But he never turned back.

The light in her eyes dimmed.

"Oliver, I can’t walk anymore. Carry my bag."

Isabella batted her lashes, her tone dripping with entitled sweetness.

"Carry it yourself."

Oliver Valrose didn’t even bother looking at her.

The backpack straps dug painfully into her palms.

"Oliver Valrose!"

She hissed his name through clenched teeth.

"Annoying. If it’s too heavy, don’t bring it."

Dark circles shadowed Oliver’s eyes, his irritation plain. After a night of partying, being dragged up this mountain at dawn had drained his patience for pretense.

"You—"

Her gaze flicked to Evelyn Roland, surrounded by admirers, then back to her own miserable situation. A lump of resentment settled in her chest.

Why was she always overlooked?

A mountain breeze swept past, cooling the simmering tension.

The Roland brothers flanked Evelyn like twin sentinels.

Halfway up the slope, Evelyn suddenly stopped.

Whispers rustled from deep within the trees.

She moved toward the sound without hesitation.

"Evelyn?"

Her brothers hurried after her.

A group of villagers sat huddled together, sighing in distress. They froze when the elegant young woman appeared.

"Don’t be afraid," her calm voice soothed. "I heard someone was bitten by insects?"

"Y-yes," one villager stammered, pointing to the corner. "She got it the worst."

Evelyn’s gaze landed on a woman with a swollen face, scratching desperately at her skin.

"Let me help."

She crouched, fingers deftly plucking herbs from the grass.

Borrowing a stone mortar, she crushed the plants with practiced ease.

The villagers gaped.

"Apply this to the bites. Keep the rest to repel insects."

As the herbal paste touched her skin, the woman gasped. "The itching stopped!"

The others stared in disbelief.
###Chapter 369

"It really stopped itching?"

The frail woman's words sent the surrounding villagers swarming forward. Dozens of eyes fixed on her exposed arm, where angry red rashes had once spread.

"It's gone! The itching's gone!"

She rubbed her arm in disbelief. A full minute passed without her scratching. The crowd erupted, turning to Evelyn Roland with newfound awe.

"A miracle worker!"

"Who knew someone so young could be so skilled?"

Suspicious glances transformed into reverence. Several elders pressed their palms together, bowing repeatedly toward Evelyn.

"Could you show us again?"

Evelyn nodded, slowing her movements. Delicate fingers crushed herbs in a stone mortar. The villagers held their breath, not daring to blink.

"Thank you, miss!"

"Take these mushrooms as payment!"

The gaunt woman shoved forward, clutching a bulging cloth sack. Dark circles ringed her eyes as her trembling wrists extended the offering.

"Unnecessary."

Evelyn's refusal made the woman wilt like a parched flower—until something cool touched her palm.

"Steep these in hot water. Three times daily."

When the woman looked up, Evelyn was already walking away with only a few mushrooms. Sunlight glinted off the lacquered medicine box in her hand.

"Wait! What's your name?"

Villagers chased after her but froze mid-step. A silent column of black-suited bodyguards materialized along the forest path. As the motorcade disappeared, the villagers bowed deeply.

"Sis, why take mushrooms?"

Isabella Langley caught up, dabbing her glistening nose with a lace handkerchief.

"Payment."

Evelyn shook the sack, releasing an earthy scent. Isabella wrinkled her nose in distaste.

"Everyone's waiting."

Her sugary tone drew eye-rolls from nearby socialites. One muttered loudly, "Imagine making us delay our hike for this..."

"Evelyn was saving lives!"

Sophia Roland's voice cut through the whispers. After her quick explanation, the group's gazes toward Isabella turned knowing.

"Shall we continue?"

Isabella linked arms with their parents, unfazed. Evelyn chuckled, tucking the mushrooms into her backpack.

The trail steepened. Sebastian Valdemar's breathing grew labored. Sweat dripped from his ashen jaw, darkening the stone steps beneath them.

"Rest."

Evelyn broke off chocolate. Their fingers brushed as Sebastian accepted it. His Adam's apple bobbed—whether from the sweetness or bitterness, who could tell?

"I'm fine."

The strained words contradicted his white-knuckled grip. Veins snaked across his clenched fists. Vincent Valdemar appeared behind him, landing a heavy hand on his shoulder.

"Uncle..."

"Take the shortcut. I know a faster route."

Sebastian shook his head, pushing upright. When Vincent moved to steady him, he sidestepped the contact. Their locked gazes turned the mountain breeze icy.
###Chapter 370

Vincent Valdemar pushed aside the bushes, revealing a hidden mountain trail.

"This way."

Sebastian Valdemar frowned at the winding stone steps. He draped his suit jacket over his arm and followed his uncle into the woods.

The mountain breeze rustled through the leaves.

"Help—"

A desperate cry shattered the silence. Sebastian froze, his sharp gaze snapping toward the sound.

"Please... help me..."

A woman's voice, laced with pain, reached his ears. Sebastian moved toward it and found a young woman slumped on the ground behind the thicket.

She clutched her right ankle, her face pale.

"Who are you?" The woman looked up warily, then stiffened when she saw him.

Sebastian studied her from above. "Just passing by."

"Can you help me?" She bit her lip, sweat beading at her temples.

Sebastian knelt, brushing aside the weeds around her foot. A rusted animal trap clamped tightly around her ankle.

"Hold still."

Before she could react, he wrenched the trap apart with a sharp twist. The metal snapped with a brittle crack.

"Ah!" The woman cried out, tears springing to her eyes.

Sebastian frowned at the bleeding wound. "Can you walk?"

She shook her head, voice trembling. "No signal... on my phone."

"I'll take you up the mountain." He loosened his tie and swiftly tied it above her injury.

When he lifted her, she inhaled sharply. His arms were strong, yet he kept a deliberate distance, his fingers barely grazing her skin.

"I'm Scarlett Galatea," she murmured.

"Sebastian Valdemar."

"Your name is... lovely..."

"Don't talk." His voice turned rough, sweat glistening at his brow.

The path steepened. Sebastian's breathing grew labored, but his steps remained steady. Scarlett peeked up and saw the rigid line of his jaw.

The summit loomed ahead.

"Sebastian!" Isabella Langley's startled cry rang out.

Sebastian staggered. His vision darkened. Scarlett felt his arms tighten around her—then—

"Look out!"

They crashed to the ground. Scarlett scrambled up, only to find Sebastian unconscious, his face deathly pale.

"Help! Someone, please!" Her scream sent birds scattering from the trees.
###Chapter 371

Sebastian's sudden collapse made Scarlett's heart clench.

Evelyn rushed over and knelt beside him. Her slender fingers pressed against his wrist as she checked his pulse, her brows furrowing slightly.

"Just dehydration and exhaustion," she murmured, retrieving a glucose solution from the medical kit.

Sebastian's pale lips parted. His tense expression softened the moment he recognized her.

"Don't speak." Evelyn brought the cup to his lips, handling him as delicately as fragile porcelain.

Scarlett stood nearby, her gaze darting between them. She noticed the way Sebastian looked at Evelyn—like she held his entire world in her hands.

"Who is she?" Scarlett grabbed Isabella's arm as she passed by, pointing at Evelyn.

Isabella eyed her warily. "And who are you?"

"Scarlett." She lifted her chin. "Sebastian brought me here."

The name made Isabella's face darken. She scoffed and shook off Scarlett's grip before walking away.

Only then did Evelyn notice Scarlett. Her eyes flicked to the bloodstained ankle, and her professional instincts kicked in immediately.

"We met on the road," Sebastian spoke up, his voice strained. "Her foot was injured, so I—"

"Hmm." Evelyn's single syllable made Sebastian tighten his grip on the cup. He'd never seen her react this way, and unease coiled in his chest.

"Can you walk?" Evelyn asked.

Scarlett whimpered the moment she tried to put weight on her foot. In the next second, she was swept off her feet—Evelyn had lifted her effortlessly into a bridal carry.

Inside the treatment room, Evelyn pulled on medical gloves and swiftly cut away Scarlett's shoe and sock.

"This will hurt." Her tone was calm but carried undeniable authority.

Scarlett clutched the sheets. "Can you be gentler—"

"Hold her down," Evelyn instructed Sebastian.

He stepped forward, but Scarlett protested, "Shouldn't we get an X-ray? This kind of injury—"

"Don't trust me?" Evelyn arched a brow, never pausing in her work.

Scarlett's retort died in her throat as sharp pain lanced through her. She stared, wide-eyed, at Evelyn's fluid, precise movements, too stunned to speak.

By the time the bandage was secured, Scarlett finally regained her composure. Gazing at the composed, striking woman before her, she felt the first sting of defeat.
###Chapter 372

"Gauze."

Before Evelyn Roland finished speaking, a roll of pristine white gauze appeared in her line of sight.

She glanced up, meeting Sebastian Valdemar's deep gaze. His slender fingers hovered midair, as if anticipating her every need.

"Thanks." The corners of her lips lifted slightly, faint laugh lines crinkling at the edges of her eyes.

Scarlett Galatea leaned against the headboard, her gaze flickering between them. "Miss Roland, you and Mr. Valdemar work together so seamlessly," she remarked, curiosity lacing her tone.

The air turned brittle.

Evelyn's hands stilled mid-bandage. The cotton swab hovered above the wound, a small stain of antiseptic spreading across the skin.

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed.

Silence stretched between them, broken only by the metallic clink of medical instruments.

Scarlett belatedly bit her lower lip. "Are you a doctor, Miss Roland?" she asked abruptly, shifting topics. "With looks like yours, you'd be rare even in the entertainment industry."

Her eyes traced Evelyn's porcelain profile before unconsciously touching her own meticulously maintained cheek.

"Flattery won't help your recovery." Evelyn didn't look up, pressing the cotton ball precisely against the wound with her forceps.

Discomfort rose like a tide. Scarlett gripped the sheets, suddenly aware of her own intrusion. The unspoken understanding between the other two had erected an invisible wall.

A realization stabbed through her. She stared at Evelyn's delicate fingers, her chest tightening.

"What exactly..." Scarlett cut straight to the point, "...is your relationship?"

The forceps clattered into the tray.

Sebastian's attention snapped to Evelyn. He saw her lashes tremble like startled butterfly wings. "Friends," he answered first, his voice rough and unfamiliar.

Scarlett narrowed her eyes. "Just friends?"

She didn't miss how Evelyn's fingers tightened around the gauze at the word, the bandage leaving faint red marks on her fingertips.

"Done." Evelyn stood abruptly, snapping the medical kit shut. Her smile was flawless, but her eyes had frosted over. "No water for three days. Avoid spicy food and seafood."

Scarlett swung her legs, her mood inexplicably lifting. Not a couple, then. She stole a glance at Sebastian's sharp profile, her pulse quickening.

"Mr. Valdemar, what kind of woman do you like?" she ventured boldly. "The gentle type? Or..."

Sebastian lifted his gaze. The look behind his glasses made her shiver. "No type," he said softly. "Just her."

His eyes slid past Scarlett, settling on Evelyn as she organized the instruments. "And," he added, barely above a whisper, "it can only be Evelyn Roland."

Scarlett missed the last part. But she saw Evelyn's back stiffen for a fraction of a second.

"I have rounds." Evelyn picked up the medical kit, her white coat flaring in a clean arc.

Sebastian moved to follow. "I'll walk you."

As the door clicked shut, Scarlett heard the distant rattle of metal instruments. Staring at the ceiling, she suddenly became aware of a dull throb in her wound.

That afternoon, Scarlett left the villa without explanation. No one knew why she changed her mind so abruptly—just as no one saw the crumpled tube of ointment Evelyn had crushed in the examination room.

###Chapter 373 

The third day of May, clear skies.

The elite business figures of City A finished their breakfast and gathered punctually at 8:50 AM in the courtyard of Mount Pilatus.

"Mr. Valdemar, where is the young lady you were holding yesterday?"

Isabella Langley immediately spotted Sebastian Valdemar's aloof figure and instinctively smoothed her carefully styled curls. Today, she had deliberately chosen a pure white lace dress, her makeup flawlessly understated.

Sebastian didn’t even glance her way. "She left."

"What girl?"

Several ears perked up. Not everyone had been present when Scarlett Galatea made her appearance the day before.

"Someone unimportant."

Sebastian shut down all further probing with that single sentence. Isabella’s nails dug into her palms, while Evelyn Roland, standing in the shadows, watched with deepening intensity.

Isabella’s words might have seemed harmless on the surface, but each one carried a hidden sting.

"Time to depart."

The group smoothly shifted the topic.

Frustrated by her failed scheme, Isabella clenched her teeth, though she couldn’t help but feel relieved that Scarlett wasn’t here.

Inside the ancient temple, incense smoke curled through the air.

Having arranged things in advance, their arrival didn’t disrupt the temple’s usual order. Monks carried out their duties, and devotees took turns offering incense.

When it was Evelyn’s turn, she calmly accepted the incense sticks.

The moment she turned—

Snap.

The incense in the burner broke without warning.

"Oh my!"

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Dozens before her had offered incense without incident—why did this happen now?

Yet Evelyn didn’t so much as frown.

She calmly removed the broken incense, relit it, and placed it back. Just as the crowd began to relax—

"It broke again!"

"This is terribly unlucky!"

The whispers grew louder, and many eyes turned accusatory.

"Amitabha."

A novice monk stepped forward to restore order.

Evelyn stared at the broken incense, something dark swirling in her gaze. The tycoons grew visibly impatient as she remained motionless.

"Miss Roland, don’t hold everyone up!"

Sebastian’s icy glance silenced the speaker instantly, leaving him drenched in cold sweat.
###Chapter 374

"Please hurry, miss." The novice monk's voice carried impatience.

I relit the incense, but it snapped the moment it caught flame. Five attempts yielded identical results.

Once could be accident. Twice, coincidence. But fresh incense behaving the same way? That reeked of sabotage.

Business tycoons were notoriously superstitious. The abnormality sent murmurs rippling through the crowd.

The Roland family exchanged cold glances as the third stick shattered mid-burn.

"Enough!" Someone slammed the table.

"Miss Roland, stop wasting our time." A rival entrepreneur seized the opportunity to attack.

"Broken incense portends catastrophe! You'll bring misfortune upon us all!"

Murmurs of agreement spread like wildfire when someone hissed, "Harbinger of doom."

Sophia Roland opened her mouth to speak, but Sebastian Valdemar beat her to it. "No wonder your ventures stagnate. Too busy chasing omens instead of opportunities."

Two red-faced businessmen looked ready to combust.

"Get out!"

"Don't curse us!"

The mob surged forward like a tidal wave.

Edward and Alexander Roland immediately formed a protective barrier around me.

I examined the broken incense with a faint smile. "Perhaps you should inspect these sticks."

"What nonsense!"

"Clearly your ill fortune caused this!"

In the corner, Isabella Langley's fingers twitched.

The white-bearded abbot arrived, voice stern. "Young lady, this is a sacred space. Leave at once."

The novice monk scurried away like a pardoned criminal.

Under a barrage of mocking stares, I walked calmly from the hall.

Derisive laughter followed me out.

Whoever orchestrated this would pay dearly.
###Chapter 375

"What a jinx. Everyone else's incense is fine, but hers is the only one that causes trouble."

"Exactly. Such bad luck."

Whispers filled the temple hall like a swarm of buzzing insects. The business tycoons had long held grudges against the Roland family, biting their tongues only because of the Blessing Ceremony's decorum. Now, with this opportunity, they eagerly piled on the criticism.

Isabella Langley's smile wavered at the edges.

Evelyn Roland's sharp gaze flickered toward the acting abbot and the novice monk.

Her wolf-like scrutiny made their hearts pound, sweat trickling down their backs.

Something was definitely off.

Sebastian Valdemar's piercing eyes followed her line of sight. Though silent, his glare alone was enough to freeze blood.

The tycoon standing opposite Sebastian—one of the main instigators—wiped his damp forehead, stammering, "M-Mr. Valdemar, Miss Roland, she..."

Dark fury churned in Sebastian's eyes, yet he remained composed. The man's knees trembled as if an invisible hand gripped his throat.

"Dad, Mom, Alex, I'm leaving."

Evelyn lifted her chin lazily, a hint of roguish defiance in her expression. The humiliation of being expelled from the temple didn't faze her.

The Roland family ached to follow her, their hearts twisting at her retreating figure.

"Dad... Mom... Brother..." Isabella panicked, reaching out to stop them.

"Stay." Evelyn paused, glancing back with calm finality. "I chose to leave."

Her gaze shifted to Isabella. The younger girl flinched at first, then inexplicably steadied herself.

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes as she clutched Sophia Roland's sleeve. "Mom, listen to her. Evelyn is doing this for the family's sake."

Evelyn's voice softened. "Stay. I need to prepare for the International Wine Tasting Championship semifinals anyway. My presence here isn't necessary. You know I hate these events."

"Evelyn, but—" Sophia's eyes reddened with unshed tears.

"Mom, I'm fine." Evelyn embraced her mother, nuzzling her cheek affectionately. "You staying helps me uncover the truth."

Sophia's eyes widened. "The truth?"

"My incense was tampered with. I know it."

"Evelyn..." Sophia patted her daughter's back gently.

Edward Roland approached with his sons. Isabella trailed behind, jealousy gnawing at her until her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Her hatred burned like acid, yet she forced a concerned expression.

"Sister..."

"I'm leaving."

"Evelyn!" Alexander Roland moved to follow.

Sebastian stepped in his path, shaking his head. "Let her go."

"Move!"
###Chapter 376

Alexander Roland's brow furrowed slightly, a flicker of displeasure flashing in his eyes.

He had always lived by his own rules, unbound by societal conventions. Watching these people harass his sister struck him as utterly ridiculous.

Blessing ceremonies? He'd never believed in such meaningless rituals.

"Stay here," he ordered coldly. "Keep an eye on them."

Alexander hesitated.

Something about the man's tone felt loaded with implication.

Just as he was about to press further, his sister gave him a subtle nod. Reluctantly, he backed down.

Sebastian Valdemar strode toward Evelyn Roland with effortless grace. His tailored black suit accentuated his impeccable physique, every step radiating innate nobility.

All eyes instinctively gravitated toward him.

"Wait for me," he murmured. "I'll take you away from here."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Alright."

A smile warmed Sebastian's eyes as he reached to caress her cheek—then stopped mid-motion.

"Everyone here is a businessperson," he turned, his voice measured. "You should all know Valdemar Group's standing in this city."

The grand hall fell deathly silent.

"Since we're all gathered," Sebastian ascended the steps, a faint smirk playing on his lips, "I should mention—I'm extremely protective of what's mine."

He slowly twisted the ring on his finger. "Those who cross me... should consider the consequences in advance."

"Valdemar Group stands firmly with Evelyn Roland."

The temperature in the hall seemed to plummet.

His razor-sharp aura sent chills down every spine. Several seasoned executives broke into cold sweats.

They'd clearly provoked the wrong man.

"What matters most to you," Sebastian said coolly, "is prosperity."

"Y-yes, exactly..." a few CEOs stammered in agreement.

"Then tell me," his gaze turned glacial, "who exactly holds the reins to your prosperity?"

The younger entrepreneurs immediately scrambled to distance themselves. "Mr. Valdemar, we had no part in this!"

Everyone knew Sebastian's reputation. The man who'd salvaged Valdemar Group from crisis and built it into an empire was no ordinary opponent.

Crossing him now would be suicide.

Sebastian's piercing stare made several men turn to bow at Evelyn. "Our apologies, Miss Roland. We were out of line."

Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet Sebastian's.

"We're leaving," he gave a slight nod.

The icy edge in his expression melted instantly as he turned back to her.

"Let's go."

He took Evelyn's hand and walked out, ignoring the murderous glares from her brothers and the terrified stares of the crowd.

"It's over..." The ringleader of the harassment collapsed to his knees, drenched in sweat.

"Nonsense!" An older CEO clutched his incense stick like a lifeline. "If we pray sincerely, the gods will protect us!"

His white-knuckled grip betrayed his false bravado.
###Chapter 377

Sebastian's hand still held Evelyn's as they descended Mount Pilatus.

His palm was broad and warm, sending tingles through her fingertips.

"Mr. Valdemar..." Her voice came out hoarse.

He released her instantly, throat bobbing. "My apologies."

"Thank you for earlier."

"Between us, such words aren't necessary."

The statement pricked her heart like a needle.

"Alright." She arched a brow, hearing the low rumble in his chest.

They avoided discussing the temple, focusing instead on details of the International Wine Tasting Championship semifinals.

A raindrop struck Evelyn's nose.

Clear skies darkened as the downpour intensified.

Sebastian swiftly draped his suit jacket over her head. "No shelter nearby. We'll have to run."

In the deluge, his tall frame angled the makeshift canopy toward her petite form.

Evelyn inhaled his crisp cedar scent—closer than ever before.

"Stay close." His rain-chilled breath grazed her ear.

She bit her lip, edging nearer.

His lips quirked at the sight of her flushed earlobe.

Rain soaked through his right sleeve, outlining taut muscle beneath the shirt.

"Find cover!" Her voice tightened seeing his drenched shoulder.

Thunder split the sky, illuminating the muddy path.

A figure emerged through the mist.

"Is there shelter nearby?" Evelyn stepped from beneath the jacket.

The girl eyed them warily.

"We got caught in the storm descending Mount Pilatus." Evelyn offered a smile. "I'm Evelyn Roland. This is Sebastian Valdemar."

"Alice." The girl relaxed. "Follow me."

At a modest cottage, Alice twisted her hem. "Wait here."

Under the eaves, warmth suddenly enveloped Evelyn's shoulders.

Alice handed over two faded but clean towels. "For drying off..." Her voice trailed off. "They're freshly washed."
###Chapter 378

"It's fine." Evelyn Roland's lips curved slightly as she casually grabbed a towel to wipe her face.

Sebastian Valdemar mimicked her, using the towel to dry his damp hair.

Their unbothered demeanor made Alice Flores relax slightly, her tense nerves easing.

"Achoo—"

The sudden sneeze shattered the quiet. Sebastian sneezed twice in quick succession, the tip of his nose turning faintly red.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. This man clearly hadn't fully recovered, yet he'd stubbornly insisted on coming along.

"Miss Roland..."

Alice fidgeted, her fingers twisting the hem of her shirt.

"Just call me Evelyn."

Evelyn smoothly took over the conversation, her tone understanding.

"Evelyn, why don't you take your boyfriend inside to rest for a bit?"

"Boyfriend?" Evelyn's eyebrow arched, but she didn't rush to correct the assumption.

The man drying his face suddenly looked up, a knowing smirk playing on his lips.

"Did... did I say something wrong?" Alice wrung her hands nervously.

"Don't worry." Sebastian's voice was gentle. "Could we borrow a hairdryer?"

Alice's face flushed crimson. "We... don't have one here."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed. "Mind if I use your kitchen? I need to make some ginger tea. Do you have ginger?"

"Yes! I'll get it right away!"

Alice practically fled the room.

When she returned to the kitchen, the sight before her made her breath catch.

The ethereal young woman stood before the worn-out clay stove, her refined presence starkly out of place in the humble surroundings.

Alice's shoulders hunched instinctively.

"Let me do it."

She knelt with practiced ease, adding firewood to the stove.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on Alice's calloused hands. Though aware of the scrutiny, Alice remained silent, focusing on her task.

"Why is the village so empty?"

"Ah..."

Alice sighed heavily, her voice suddenly aged. "This place used to be lively. Then came the famine. Some starved. Others fell ill. Those who could leave did. Now only the elderly, women, and children remain."

"What about Mount Pilatus? The temple should provide aid."

At the mention of the temple, Alice's hands trembled violently.

"That place... it's not what it used to be." Her voice shook. "It's become a den of monsters now."

Evelyn's eyes turned icy.

"No one's intervened?"

"Who would dare?" Alice gave a bitter laugh. "It's the most popular temple in the city. Too many powerful people backing it."

Mount Pilatus.

The novice monk.

The acting abbot.

Isabella Langley.

The connections snapped into place in Evelyn's mind. Her knuckles whitened as her grip tightened, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.
###Chapter 379

Raindrops pounded against the dilapidated eaves as Alice Flores clutched the hem of her dress with trembling fingers.

"Those officials couldn't care less about poor villages like ours."

Her voice trembled with suppressed rage, knuckles turning white.

"Have you tried reporting them?"

"To whom?" Alice gave a bitter laugh. "We barely even visit the town proper."

She suddenly clutched her head as if trying to stop painful memories from flooding in.

Mount Pilatus Monastery had once thrived with worshippers—until the acting abbot arrived.

"They threaten villagers for money and grain, calling it 'blessing offerings.'" Alice's voice shook. "Those who refuse get beaten and driven out."

Evelyn Roland's fingers tapped rhythmically against the wooden table.

"Started a month ago?"

"Master Xingyun left for pilgrimage." Alice looked up, eyes burning. "This so-called Master Xingyu is nothing but a bandit!"

Outside, the rain softened while Evelyn's gaze darkened.

"I'll handle this."

"No!" Alice grabbed her wrist desperately. "They have powerful backers—"

Evelyn gently freed herself, lips curving slightly.

"Waiting for divine justice takes too long." She rose gracefully. "I prefer taking out the trash myself."

Tears finally spilled down Alice's cheeks as she nodded vigorously.

When the rain ceased, Evelyn and Sebastian Valdemar departed like shadows.

While clearing dishes, Alice discovered banknotes tucked beneath a bowl. Her hands shook violently.

"God bless you..." She knelt before the empty doorway, whispering prayers.

Meanwhile, in Mount Pilatus Monastery's grand hall, business tycoons murmured among themselves.

The heavy doors burst open. A white-bearded Taoist priest strode in urgently.

"Is Miss Roland of the Roland family present?"

All eyes turned to Isabella Langley.

"That's me." She stepped forward, puzzled.

The old priest grasped her hands excitedly. "I'm Master Xingyun! Finally meeting our benefactor!"

Gasps filled the hall.

"You're the lady who funded the schoolhouse?" Master Xingyun's voice quivered. "Such boundless virtue!"

Isabella's face drained of color.
###Chapter 380

Sunlight streamed through the latticed windows of the meditation hall, scattering golden fragments across the floor.

Isabella Langley sat upright on the meditation cushion, her skirt fanning out like lotus petals. Her fingers absently traced the smooth surface of the new jade bracelet around her wrist, its warmth carrying a faint scent of sandalwood.

"Isabella, please have some tea."

Abbot Xingyun slid a celadon teacup toward her. Wisps of steam curled upward, softening the kind lines of his aged face. Isabella noticed his calloused hands trembling slightly—clear evidence of the sleepless night he'd spent crafting the bracelet.

"About that herbal prescription yesterday—"

The teacup clinked against the wooden table. Isabella's lashes fluttered as ripples disturbed the tea's surface. She distinctly remembered tending to Sebastian Valdemar at the winery yesterday. When had she visited the temple?

Yet the abbot was already lost in reminiscence. "In sixty years of practicing medicine, I've never seen such an exquisite formula. Three qian of bupleurum root, scutellaria..." His milky eyes brightened as he recited the ingredients with reverence. "Thirty-seven villagers suffering from high fever—all recovered after taking it."

Bamboo leaves rustled outside the window.

Isabella stared at her reflection in the tea, suddenly recalling Evelyn Roland's pale complexion this morning. Her white-clad sister was probably keeping vigil at Sebastian's bedside right now.

"This bracelet..."

"Carved from our temple's treasured mutton-fat jade." The abbot stroked his beard with a smile. "Such skilled hands and compassionate heart deserve this blessing."

Commotion erupted from the front courtyard.

Turning, Isabella saw her parents surrounded through the rice-paper window. Business tycoons vied for the Rolands' attention, and even her usually stern father wore an uncharacteristic smile.

"But I..."

"No need for modesty." The abbot lowered his voice. "I saw that young lady with the silver bracelet this morning too."

Isabella's pupils constricted.

The jade bracelet suddenly burned against her skin. She remembered the drenched figure on the mountain path at dawn—frail as mist about to dissolve.

The scent of vegetarian dishes drifted from the dining hall.

The abbot stood to open the wooden window, revealing mist-shrouded mountain peaks in the distance. "Some connections," he said meaningfully, "appear accidental but were fated all along."

Footsteps approached the meditation hall.

Sophia Roland's voice carried through: "Isabella? Is the master keeping you for lunch?"

Isabella's grip tightened around the teacup.

The prescription. The bracelet. The villagers. Fragments swirled in her mind. Suddenly she understood—this ordinary morning was unraveling an extraordinary secret.
###Chapter 381

The tranquil monastery courtyard buzzed with activity outside the sandalwood-scented meditation hall.

Business tycoons shifted allegiances faster than flipping pages. They swarmed around the Roland family, sycophantic grins plastered across their faces, desperate to bask in Isabella Langley and Master Xingyun's perceived divine favor.

"Your opportunism is impressive," Alexander Roland remarked coldly, the glint of his ring mirroring the frost in his eyes. "First, you shun my sister like a plague. Now you grovel at her feet. Do you truly think the Rolands are pushovers?"

The crowd stiffened, unprepared for his public confrontation during the Blessing Ceremony.

A few cowards already shrank back, eager to avoid collateral damage.

"Evelyn Roland is a jinx!" one man spat defiantly. "Keeping her around brings nothing but misfortune!"

Alexander's lips curled into a humorless smile.

Some people were rotten to the core.

In the corner, the acting abbot and novice monk trembled, barely daring to breathe.

Inside the meditation hall, Isabella fidgeted uncomfortably.

"Miss Roland," Master Xingyun pressed, hands clasped reverently, "the monastery is willing to pay handsomely for that insect repellent formula."

Her fingers twitched. "We'll discuss it another time."

She forced a strained smile, her back drenched in cold sweat.

When they exited, the master beamed with satisfaction.

The moment his back turned, Isabella's face contorted with rage.

That formula?

Again—Evelyn!

That wretched girl had been banished from the mountain. Why did her shadow still linger?

Her nails dug bloody crescents into her palms. She wanted to grind that name between her teeth and swallow the ashes.

——

Dozens of miles away, in a secluded villa, Evelyn sneezed violently.

"Coming down with something?" Sebastian Valdemar propped himself up, reaching for her forehead.

"Someone's cursing me," she deflected, tilting away.

His hand hovered midair, pale lips pressing into a tight line.

"The monastery situation..." A cough rattled his chest. "I'll handle it."

His thumb absently traced his ring, a faint flush coloring the corners of his eyes.

"Sure thing, Mr. Valdemar~" She deliberately drawled the title.

Behind his glasses, his gaze darkened.

He longed to resort to more... persuasive methods. But frightening her was the last thing he wanted.

"I'm checking on Bianca." She turned toward the door.

"Don't go—"

The whisper dissolved into empty air as the door clicked shut.
###Chapter 382

Sebastian Valdemar stood by the window, his fingers lightly tapping the sill. He had long grown accustomed to the torment of waiting.

In the incense-laden courtyard of the ancient monastery.

Isabella Langley had just composed herself when she turned a corner and collided with Oliver Valrose. "Isabella," he murmured, his voice dripping with tenderness.

"What are you doing here?"

"I've been waiting for you." Oliver naturally took her hand. "You must be hungry. Let's get dinner."

The restaurant erupted in murmurs the moment they entered.

"Miss Isabella is back!"
"Please, have a seat!"

Dozens of eager eyes locked onto Isabella like spotlights. The Roland family barely had time to approach.

"Try this soup."
"Miss Isabella looks radiant today."

Amid the flurry of compliments, Isabella's smile widened. It had been ages since she'd basked in such adoration.

She glided through the crowd and linked arms with Sophia and Edward Roland. "Mom, Dad, sorry to keep you waiting."

"Starving, aren't you?" Sophia fretted, smoothing Isabella's hair.

Isabella produced a jade bracelet from her pocket. "For you, Mom. May you have peace and happiness."

Edward watched the mother-daughter exchange, crow's feet crinkling at his eyes.

No one noticed the slender figure darting through the shadows.

A gaunt little girl with sunken cheeks clenched her fists, eyes blazing with fury. "Liar!" she hissed.

The child took a shortcut home and flung herself into Alice Flores' arms.

"Nina, what's wrong?" Alice panicked at her daughter's tears.

Between sobs, Nina recounted what she'd overheard at the temple. "That wicked woman bullied Evelyn!" She stamped her foot in rage.

Nina would never forget that day—peeking through a doorway as Evelyn Roland smiled gently at her and slipped her a piece of candy.

"Monster! Evil witch!" The little girl cried herself to exhaustion before finally falling asleep.

In the kitchen, Evelyn's phone vibrated. A text from an unknown number flashed on the screen—a single glaring exclamation mark.
###Chapter 383

The phone screen lit up with a sharp chime.

Bianca Savigny was carrying a steaming plate of sweet and sour ribs when she noticed Evelyn Roland frowning at her phone.

"Master, spam message?"

"It's from Alice."

Evelyn's fingers swiped across the screen, but the fragmented signal only displayed half the text.

"I'll fetch Theodore."

Bianca set down the tray and turned to leave.

"Wait." Evelyn stopped her with a hand on her shoulder. "Stay with Sebastian. I'll handle this."

Her apprentice pouted like a petulant child.

"Leaving me behind again..."

Evelyn was already striding out of Château Blanc, kicking up dust as her black SUV roared to life.

The Flores family's cottage stood silent.

The moment Evelyn pushed open the door, a small blur crashed into her.

"Sister!"

Little Nina gazed up with rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes.

"Here." Evelyn produced a lollipop like a magician. "Where's your mother?"

"Miss Roland!"

Alice emerged from the inner room, wringing her apron.

As the story unfolded, a glacial glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes.

"Isabella Langley..."

The name clung like chewed gum to the sole of her shoe.

"Will Nina need to testify?" Alice asked nervously.

Evelyn's sudden smile sent chills down the woman's spine.

"No children involved." Evelyn rolled up her sleeves with deliberate calm. "But we do require a small favor."

Nina bounced on her toes. "I want to help too!"

"Next time, I'll take you to Disneyland."

Thirty minutes later, at the gates of Westminster Abbey.

Whispers floated among the pilgrims:

"That adopted daughter of the Rolands..."

"Seduced the abbot..."

Evelyn adjusted her baseball cap and gave Alice a meaningful look.

"My legs won't stop shaking," Alice stammered.

"Deep breaths."

A gray-robed monk emerged from behind a pillar, prayer beads glinting softly in the sunlight.

"Master Xingyun!"

Alice rushed toward him like a drowning woman grasping at driftwood.

The old abbot's gaze slid past her, locking onto the shadowed figure.

"And this is...?"

"My cousin!" Alice blurted. "She's... allergic to pollen!"

Master Xingyun's fingers stilled on his beads.

A mountain wind swirled dead leaves across the stone steps.
###Chapter 384

Master Xingyun fingered his prayer beads, unfazed by the unfolding scene.

"Master, we're running low on insect repellent," a female worshiper pleaded urgently. "I heard Miss Langley is still at the temple. My cousin needs medicine—she's unmarried and can't afford to have her face ruined."

"I shall summon Miss Langley at once."

The abbot hurried toward the main hall with his entourage.

"Miss Langley!"

Isabella Langley stood surrounded by admirers, her radiant smile faltering as the abbot's voice froze her in place.

Her cheerful expression shattered.

"Miss Langley?"

The abbot called again.

"Y-yes?" Her voice trembled.

"Could you prepare more insect repellent immediately?"

"Of course."

The weight of countless stares prickled her skin like needles. The adoration she'd basked in moments ago now felt like a noose.

Thankfully, none of the Roland family were present to expose her lies.

"Master, I'll need to gather herbs from the mountain woods."

Evelyn Roland observed every twitch of Isabella's body from the shadows. A smirk played on her lips.

How much longer can you keep up this act, dear sister?

The business tycoons remained oblivious that the woman they'd scorned now moved among them.

The abbot's exchange with Isabella revealed the truth—Mount Pilatus teemed with venomous insects, and this socialite knew how to brew antidotes.

Overnight, their gazes shifted from skepticism to reverence.

Isabella led the group up the mountain trail, followed by Alice Flores, Master Xingyun, Evelyn, and two curious entrepreneurs.

Her fists clenched, a storm of fury and terror churning in her chest.

Don't slip up yet, Evelyn silently taunted.

An eerie silence blanketed the woods.

"Cuckoo—"
"Rustle—"

Strange noises echoed around them. Cold sweat drenched Isabella's back.

"Ah!"

Her foot sank into something soft. She shrieked.

"Miss Langley?"

The abbot's suspicious glance burned into her.

The businessmen trembled too, though they bit back their screams.

"I'm just... unfamiliar with this area," Isabella stammered.

"You don't usually forage in the mountains?"

Evelyn's voice, disguised by the modulator, cut through the tension.

Isabella's smile turned brittle. "I do, just not here specifically."

"I see."

Evelyn dragged out the words, her skepticism blatant.

The pathetic excuse and pointed questioning sharpened the abbot's scrutiny.

A sudden downpour cut their expedition short.

Isabella huddled under the eaves, watching raindrops fall. Her gaze slid toward Alice and her "cousin," venom flashing in her eyes.

Alice knew too much.

She had to be silenced.
###Chapter 385

Isabella Langley sat alone in the back courtyard chamber, her fingers absently tracing the rim of a celadon teacup.

Crash—

The cup slipped from her grasp, shattering on the stone floor.

She closed her eyes, her pale lashes casting shadows across her face.

In the pavilion, Alice Flores wiped beads of sweat from her forehead, twisting the hem of her dress. "Evelyn, what should we do now?"

Evelyn Roland leaned against a vermilion pillar, moonlight swirling in her gaze. "Stay calm."

"Did I...did I mess things up?" Alice's voice trembled as she repeated the question.

"Her schemes are transparent to me."

Isabella's cunning was shallow—every emotion flickered plainly in her eyes.

"I have people watching Nina."

Evelyn's glance caught Alice biting her lower lip, and she added the reassurance.

Alice looked at the unshakable young woman beside her, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly.

In the meditation hall, Evelyn's eyes snapped open.

She stared at her phone contacts for a long moment before finally pressing call. "Meet me in the bamboo grove."

Bamboo leaves rustled in the wind, raindrops sliding from their tips.

Oliver Valrose brushed water off his shoulder with a frown. "What's so urgent?"

He swallowed his complaint. Isabella was now the "Lady of Auspicious Bonds," personally recognized by Abbot Xingyun—a title the Valrose family prized for its divine connection.

"I need a killer."

Oliver recoiled. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Spare me the theatrics!" Isabella's voice was glacial.

"At least tell me who the target is." His throat went dry.

"Alice."

Oliver's pupils constricted. After a weighted silence, he turned on his heel and left without another word.

Deep in the bamboo grove, the wind whipped Isabella's skirt violently.

This loose end had to be eliminated—Abbot Xingyun's trust in Alice was threatening her position.

At midnight, her phone screen lit up.

Isabella stared at the message, her lips twisting into a grotesque smile.

"All obstacles must disappear."

Alice stepped out of the lounge, phone in hand.

A shadow lunged at her—

She froze, watching the glint of a dagger slash toward her—
###Chapter 386

"Ah—"

The man's grotesque face twisted under the harsh light.

Just as the blade came within inches of Alice's throat, a shadow darted past.

"Thud!"

He was flung sideways like a ragdoll, slamming into the concrete five meters away.

"My hand! My arm!" He writhed on the ground, clutching his broken limb.

Alice stood frozen.

"Alice?" Hannah's voice snapped her back to reality.

She shook her head mechanically, lips trembling too much to speak.

"Stay... stay back!" The man scrambled backward, dragging his injured leg toward the wall.

A black combat boot pinned his shirt to the ground.

He looked up into Evelyn Roland's icy gaze.

"Who sent you?"

Slender fingers closed around his throat.

His face turned from pale to ashen, eyes bulging with suffocation.

Just before he blacked out, Evelyn released him.

"Cough... cough..." He curled into a fetal position. "I... I never met the employer... just got a photo..."

"Phone."

Trembling, he handed it over.

Evelyn's fingers flew across the screen.

"Found it."

She tossed the phone back and dialed a number.

Leaning against the graffiti-stained wall, she idly twirled a butterfly knife.

Alice stood behind her like a loyal guard.

Each time the man tried to flee, Hannah kicked him back into place.

"Click-clack—"

Polished shoes echoed down the alley.

Two officers appeared at the entrance.

"You..." The man's face drained of color. "Officers, I confess! I didn't even succeed!"

"Attempted assault still carries criminal charges," the female officer said coldly.

"Bitch!" He suddenly lunged.

"Crunch!"

An elbow strike sent him crashing down.

Two bloodied teeth skittered across the pavement.

"Ms. Roland..." The male officer hesitated.

"Quieter this way." Evelyn flexed her wrist. "Wouldn't want to disturb the neighbors."

The officers exchanged a look.

After giving their statements, Evelyn led Alice away.

"Ms. Roland!" The female officer called after them. "I'll notify you immediately after closing the case!"

Evelyn waved without turning around.

Alice dug her nails into her palms.

In just a few hours, she'd lived through the most heart-stopping moments of her life.

"So badass..." The female officer murmured, watching their retreating figures. "What a waste she's not on our SWAT team."

"Agreed." Her partner nodded. "That joint lock technique? Takes at least a decade to master."

Deep in the alley, Evelyn pulled out her vibrating phone.

An encrypted message flashed onscreen:
「Photo received. Game on.」
###Chapter 387

"Alice, that man won't bother you again." Evelyn Roland tapped the table lightly with her fingertips. "The compensation for emotional distress will be transferred soon."

Alice's eyes reddened. "Thank you, Evelyn."

Evelyn suddenly leaned in, her gaze sharp as a blade sweeping over Alice's face.

"One more favor."

A dangerous glint flashed in her eyes, yet it warmed Alice's heart. No matter how piercing that girl's stare was, it would never harm her.

Meanwhile, Isabella Langley paced restlessly in her room. Her phone screen dimmed and brightened repeatedly, but Oliver Valrose's reply never came.

"What's going on..." She gnawed at her nails before finally bolting toward the front courtyard.

A scream pierced the air.

Isabella froze mid-step, her pupils contracting. The ground was now crawling with a dense swarm of insects—white, black, squirming, armored—advancing like a tidal wave.

"Ah!"

She jerked back as a plump larva clung to her shoe. Her back hit a pillar, only to discover more black insects pouring from the cracks in the wall.

"Help..."

The business tycoons were in chaos. Some slapped at the ants on their bodies, others scratched at their inflamed skin. The abbot's robe was covered in cockroaches, while devotees screamed and fled in all directions.

"Miss Langley!" Someone grabbed her sleeve. "Do something!"

Isabella forced herself to stay calm. "Everyone, don't panic. These insects—"

Before she could finish, a spider crawled up her calf. Then came a searing pain—three red ants had sunk their pincers into her ankle.

"Dad! Mom!"

The Roland family rushed toward the commotion but halted abruptly at the edge of the insect swarm. Strangely, the creatures avoided them entirely.

"The herbal formula!" the abbot suddenly shouted. "They have insect repellent! There are more ingredients in the monastery courtyard!"

All eyes locked onto the four Rolands. An invisible barrier seemed to surround them, the swarm parting to form an eerie vacuum.

Isabella gasped in pain, watching her parents and brother standing untouched amidst the chaos. That realization chilled her far more than any insect bite.
###Chapter 388

Oliver Valrose's body writhed under a crawling mass of poisonous insects. Angry red welts rose across his skin as he collapsed to his knees, his trousers soaked through. "Isabella, help me!" His voice cracked with terror.

Isabella Langley clenched her fists so tightly her nails drew blood from her palms.

"Isabella!" Oliver screamed again.

Four pairs of eyes from the Roland family locked onto her.

"I..."

Her lips parted, but no sound emerged.

The business tycoons were dropping like flies—some already convulsing on the ground. A man fumbled for his phone, only to find no signal in the mountain wilderness.

"Miss Langley!" Master Xingyun's forehead gleamed with sweat. "Mercy is the greatest virtue!"

At the crowd's edge, Evelyn Roland adjusted her hat brim. A flick of her wrist sent powder cascading silently near Isabella's feet.

"Ahhh!" Isabella shrieked, slapping frantically at her skirt.

Every head turned.

"Because she never knew how to repel insects." A cool voice cut through the chaos.

Evelyn stepped forward, removing her face mask.

"Evelyn?" Sophia Roland gasped.

Edward Roland rushed toward his daughter. "Evelyn, how did you—"

"Later, Father." Evelyn unslung her backpack of medicinal herbs. "I'm curious—when did you become such a philanthropist, Isabella?"

Master Xingyun's eyes bulged.

Isabella staggered backward, only to find herself cornered by skittering insects. Her pleading gaze met her parents' faces—and found only crushing disappointment.

"This should suffice." Evelyn handed a satchel to the nearest monk before surveying the writhing businessmen. "Any longer, and some may suffer permanent damage."

With a heavy sigh, Edward began distributing the antidote. Sophia embraced her eldest daughter, eyes glistening.

Isabella crumpled to the ground, venomous creatures scaling her arms. "Sister...please..."

Evelyn knelt, sprinkling the final powder in a protective circle. The swarm scattered instantly.

"Remember this lesson." Her whisper carried the weight of judgment.
###Chapter 389

Evelyn Roland observed the crowd's reactions with cold indifference, offering no comfort.

Isabella Langley had maintained her favored status all these years solely through her masterful manipulation skills.

As for the heartbreak of her deceived family members, it wasn't Evelyn's place to intervene.

"Mom, Dad, brothers...save me..." Isabella wept pitifully, tears streaming down her delicate face like pear blossoms in the rain. "It hurts so much..."

But the swarming venomous insects left no room for sympathy.

"Isabella, you—"

"Master Xingyun!" Alice suddenly spoke up. "This is the true Roland heiress, our savior!"

The prayer beads snapped with a sharp crack.

Master Xingyun's expression darkened instantly. "A case of mistaken identity? Then this young lady..."

Isabella dug her nails into her palms, her face turning deathly pale.

Evelyn gave a hoarse chuckle as she retrieved several herbs from her bag.

With practiced efficiency, she crushed the plants until their juices seeped out. Producing a small mortar, she added dried medicinal leaves.

A subtle herbal fragrance permeated the air.

Then came the horrifying sight—the insects retreated like a receding tide.

"This..." The crowd gaped in astonishment.

"Mom, Dad, brothers." Evelyn handed them the powdered mixture. "Sprinkle it on the ground."

The moment the powder touched the floor, the plump white larvae shriveled instantly.

Complete silence fell over the gathering.

"That's all it took?" someone challenged. "Why didn't you act sooner?"

"Exactly! You enjoyed watching us suffer!"

Accusations flew thick and fast.

"Liam Zheng! Mason Murray! William Xing!" Alexander Roland barked their names, eyes blazing with fury.

He would never forget the sight of his sister being driven from the temple yesterday.

"Alex." Evelyn restrained him with a touch. "I'll settle my own scores."

Her piercing gaze swept across the crowd before landing on Isabella. "Care to explain?"

Isabella stumbled backward in panic.

With a cold smile, Evelyn revealed the full truth about the blessing ceremony.

Alice nodded vigorously in confirmation beside her.
###Chapter 390

Isabella Langley felt the world spin around her, her palms slick with cold sweat.

"Lina, why would you do this?"

Sophia Roland approached slowly, her voice trembling.

She desperately wished this was all a misunderstanding, but the evidence before her eyes left no room for denial.

"Mom, the abbot made a mistake," Isabella's voice quivered. "Evelyn, please believe me."

"So you're saying Master Xingyun falsely accused you?"

Isabella opened her mouth, but no words came out.

Evelyn Roland stood nearby, a trace of mockery flashing in her eyes.

Sophia staggered, her gaze dull with despair.

Edward and Julian Roland's expressions were equally grim.

"Lina, you've let us down."

"Dad!"

A heavy sigh.

"Second Brother!"

Four pairs of disappointed eyes pierced through her like arrows. Isabella's legs nearly gave way beneath her.

"Apologize to Evelyn," Edward commanded sternly.

Isabella dug her nails into her palms until they nearly drew blood.

"I..."

Suddenly, Evelyn smiled sweetly.

"Big sister~"

"Hmm?"

"I'm sorry I took credit for your achievements."

"This tea is quite strong, isn't it?"

Evelyn leaned close, her whisper barely audible.

"Evelyn Roland! You set me up!"

"What if I did?"

Their family remained oblivious to the hushed exchange.

Isabella's face paled, fear flickering in her eyes.

"Oh, and about that incense incident—we'll have answers today."

Isabella shuddered violently.

"Expect my gift soon."

Abbot Xingyun suddenly bowed deeply to Evelyn.

"Abbot?"

"Miss Roland."

"Just call me Evelyn."

"Thank you."

The abbot looked haggard, the wrinkles around his eyes deeper than ever.

He studied Evelyn with a complicated gaze.

"If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask."

Evelyn met his eyes, her gaze clear as crystal. "Actually, there is something I'd like your help with."

"No!"

Isabella jerked her head up, her face deathly white.
###Chapter 391

Master Xingyun agreed to help without even asking for details.

Isabella Langley bit her lower lip until it bled, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms. She longed to intervene but remained frozen, her face ashen.

"Little sister, you seem to have something to say?" Evelyn Roland's lips curved slightly, her eyes glinting with icy disdain.

Isabella opened her mouth, but no words came out. Humiliation burned through her like never before.

Her gaze instinctively sought Sophia Roland and the others, hoping they would defend her as they always had.

This time, she was met with four pairs of disappointed eyes. The family who once doted on her now stood silent.

"Dad..."

"Mom..."

"Alexander..."

"Edward?"

Only silence answered her. The roomful of business tycoons maintained their collective muteness.

Beads of sweat formed on Isabella's forehead.

"Oliver?"

She scanned the crowd, but Oliver Valrose was nowhere to be seen.

Evelyn tapped her fingers against a wooden shelf, waiting with deliberate patience.

When she finally lifted her gaze, it swept across faces filled with guilt, sycophancy, and admiration. Her expression remained impassive. "Alice, distribute the medicinal brew. It reduces swelling and detoxifies."

"Give it to me!"

"I need some too!"

"Don't forget me!"

The tycoons who had remained passive moments ago now surged forward like a pack of wolves. Julian Roland stood at the center, his sharp eyes dissecting the crowd.

The brew was quickly depleted. Those who missed out watched helplessly as Alice "accidentally" spilled the remaining liquid.

"This..."

They gaped in disbelief.

"Evelyn Roland, you're using this as an excuse for personal vengeance!" The men clawed at their inflamed skin, their voices thick with outrage.

"Indeed." Evelyn's reply was crisp.

Their faces turned purple, their scratching hands freezing midair.

"You... You viper!"

"How dare you!"

Even timid Alice flushed with anger, her fists clenched.

Every member of the Roland family had their knuckles whitening with suppressed fury.

Human depravity never failed to astonish.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint flashing within them.

Just then—

"Gentlemen, your skin appears thicker than I imagined."

The voice made everyone whirl around.

Evelyn was the last to look up but the first to recognize its owner.

Sebastian Valdemar had arrived.

His towering frame was accentuated by the tailored black suit as he strode forward with measured steps.

"Why are you here? Are your injuries healed? Where's Theodore?"

Evelyn moved toward him, her eyes softening. The man gazed at her with undisguised tenderness. "I'm fine. I heard you came back to the mountain and couldn't stay away."

Then his attention shifted to the hecklers, his expression darkening instantly.
###Chapter 392

Sebastian Valdemar's lips curved into a smile, but his eyes remained icy cold.

"Vicious?" He repeated the word slowly, his long fingers tapping lightly on the table. "Did I just hear you gentlemen insulting the person who saved your lives?"

The pompous men instantly froze like strangled chickens, their faces flushing red as they coughed violently.

"We—we didn't—" The lead fat man stammered, sweat beading on his forehead.

Sebastian's smile deepened. "Oh? So I misheard?"

The tycoons exchanged panicked glances, wishing they could vanish into the floor. Neither admitting nor denying, they could only fidget awkwardly.

Evelyn Roland suddenly let out a soft laugh.

"Since you all called me vicious," she said idly adjusting her cuffs, "I suppose I should live up to the reputation."

Before anyone could react, she continued, "Without the antidote, the itching will seep from your skin into your bones."

"You're lying!" The fat man's voice cracked as he jerked his head up.

The moment he spoke, the men suddenly convulsed as if electrocuted, clawing frantically at their bodies.

"It burns! Help!"

"I can't stand it!"

They leaped around like crazed monkeys, the scene both absurd and pitiful.

Master Xingyun closed his eyes in prayer, while Alice Flores smirked. "Serves you right!"

"Sister..." Isabella Langley stepped forward with red-rimmed eyes. "They've learned their lesson. Please help them..."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Are you suggesting I repay malice with kindness?"

"That's not—" Isabella's tears fell in rapid drops.

"Tears lose their value when overused." Evelyn's casual remark made the female guests exchange knowing looks.

Isabella's face paled, then flushed with humiliation.

"Master Xingyun," Evelyn turned to the abbot. "I intend to conduct a thorough inspection of the temple to eliminate all venomous insect hazards."

"What?" Isabella gasped before hastily covering her mouth.

Master Xingyun clasped his hands. "The entire monastery will assist you, benefactor."

At those words, Isabella's face drained of all color.
###Chapter 393

"Stop!"

The novice monk and acting abbot cried out simultaneously, rushing forward in panic to intervene.

Isabella Langley clenched the hem of her robe, her nails digging into her palms. She opened her mouth but realized she had no right to speak.

"Abbot, how can outsiders be allowed to wander the sacred temple grounds?" The novice monk's forehead glistened with sweat.

Master Xingyun ignored him, bowing respectfully to Evelyn Roland instead. "Please follow me, benefactor."

In the courtyard before the meditation hall, Evelyn strode ahead with her hands clasped behind her back. The business tycoons trailed behind nervously, their eyes darting around for any sign of venomous insects.

"This one."

Evelyn pushed open the novice monk's door without hesitation. She emerged less than five minutes later.

Standing on the steps, her gaze swept over the crowd like a blade. "Julian," she commanded coldly, "drag out that imposter monk."

Before anyone could react, Julian Roland had already flung a robed man onto the stone pavement.

"Ah!" The imposter groaned as his face smashed against the granite.

"Abbot, save me!" He lifted his head, revealing a twisted expression.

Master Xingyun gasped. "Cloud Spirit?"

A murderous glint flashed in the imposter's eyes as he lunged at Evelyn. She sidestepped effortlessly and kicked him several meters back.

"Stay down!" Julian delivered another sharp kick.

The imposter curled into a whimpering ball. "Spare me!"

"What's going on?" The crowd murmured in confusion.

Evelyn pushed open the meditation hall door. "See for yourselves."

She yanked aside the bedding and pulled out a bulging cloth bundle, tossing it to Master Xingyun. "Since when do monks hoard this much cash?"

The bundle split open, spilling thick stacks of banknotes.

"My God!" Gasps erupted from the onlookers.

The imposter's face turned ashen as he collapsed like a deflated sack.
###Chapter 394

The cloth bag was yanked open violently, its contents clattering to the ground.

A blinding golden glare instantly pierced everyone's eyes.

"This... this is..."

Mr. Wang, standing at the front, staggered and nearly collapsed to his knees. His trembling finger pointed at the pile of gold bars on the floor, his voice cracking. "I've never seen so much gold in my life!"

A wave of murmurs erupted through the crowd.

Someone began counting on their fingers. "At market price, one gold bar... there must be at least a hundred here..."

"Master Xingyun!" A bald middle-aged businessman suddenly threw himself at the abbot. "Is it too late for me to take monastic vows?"

Master Xingyun's face had turned ashen.

His gaze locked onto Cloud Spirit, his voice hoarse with fury. "Where... did all this come from?"

Cloud Spirit's legs trembled uncontrollably.

He hadn't expected his scheme to unravel so quickly—let alone be exposed by a woman he'd just met.

"I... I..."

"Seems you've been helping yourself to the temple's donations too?" Evelyn Roland's voice floated over, light and mocking.

Cloud Spirit jerked his head up, meeting those faintly amused eyes.

"I don't know what you're talking about!" he snapped, his neck stiff with defiance. "This is my personal savings!"

Evelyn smiled.

That smile sent a chill down his spine.

"Stubbornness won't save you," she said leisurely. "I have ways to make you talk."

Sebastian Valdemar snapped his fingers.

Two men in black immediately dragged forward a disheveled monk.

"Cloud Summit?!" Master Xingyun swayed, nearly fainting.

Forced to his knees, Cloud Summit still protested. "All temple incense is purchased through proper channels! Don't slander us, Miss Roland!"

Evelyn's boot pressed lightly onto the back of his hand.

"How interesting," she mused, tilting her head. "Such loyalty. Who are you protecting?"

Her gaze swept over the crowd before settling on Isabella Langley and Oliver Valrose.

"Surely not my dear sister and her fiancé?"

Oliver's face drained of color.

Isabella forced composure. "What are you implying, sister? I've never met these monks."

"Just a joke." Evelyn chuckled, withdrawing her gaze. "Why so tense?"

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. Tears welled in her eyes, but no retort came.
###Chapter 395

Master Xingyun coughed violently, his aged hand pressing against his chest. "Miss Roland, you may take them. But first, they must complete the final rite."

Incense smoke curled through the grand hall as monks encircled Cloud Summit and Cloud Spirit. The abbot stood before the Buddha statue, trembling as he lit three sticks of incense and knelt in reverence.

As the sandalwood burned to ash, a metallic taste rose in his throat.

"From this day forth, you are no longer disciples of this temple," the abbot rasped. "Let your fate serve as a warning to others. Now, bow three times."

"Dream on!" Cloud Summit jerked his head up. "This dump isn't worth staying in!"

Cloud Spirit rose beside him. After exchanging glances, they turned to bolt from the hall.

"Stop them!"

Evelyn's eyes turned frosty. Her leg swept out in a swift arc, sending both men crashing to the floor with pig-like squeals.

Sebastian gestured, and two black-clad men stepped forward, hauling the offenders away like sacks of grain.

Silence engulfed the hall.

Master Xingyun watched, chest heaving. A porcelain hand offered him tea at perfect drinking temperature.

"This water..." The abbot took a sip, his clouded eyes flashing with surprise.

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Shall I check your pulse?"

She wasn't charitable by nature, but for true practitioners, she'd make an exception.

The abbot shook his head and shuffled away, bent like an ancient tree. He had discipline to restore and rules to reforged.

"Your hands."

Sebastian materialized beside her, holding a moist towelet between his fingers. When Evelyn accepted it, their fingertips brushed, sparking a current.

The crowd dispersed gradually. Scarlett lingered at the rear, her gaze boring into the synchronized figures ahead.

She'd altered her itinerary to return early, only to have her heart shredded witnessing Sebastian's demeanor toward Evelyn. The man who'd always maintained careful distance with her now had eyes for only one woman.

"Evelyn Roland..." Scarlett's nails bit into her palms.

Deep in the monastery, the Roland family sat in heavy silence.

"Isabella has disappointed us deeply," Sophia murmured, eyes red-rimmed.

Edward exhaled sharply. "We failed as parents."

A lone leaf spiraled onto the stone table between them—a mirror to their tangled thoughts.
###Chapter 396

"Mom, this isn't your fault." Alexander Roland gently stroked his mother's hand. "Isabella received far more affection than Evelyn growing up, yet she..."

He paused, suppressing the irritation in his chest.

"Evelyn spent the least time in the Roland family, yet she's the most sensible." Pride colored his tone.

At the mention of Evelyn Roland, Sophia Roland's eyes welled with grateful tears. "We failed that child. Her composure today puts me to shame."

In that vast conference hall filled with business tycoons, a single glance from her had commanded the room.

Outsiders might call her cold and unyielding.

But to the Rolands, this was exactly how a daughter of their house should carry herself.

The helm of Château Blanc demanded such decisive authority.

In the monastery courtyard, the monks gathered.

Abbot Xingyun's expression was grave. "Everyone witnessed the incident with Cloud Summit and Cloud Spirit. As abbot, I bear responsibility."

His stern gaze swept over them. "From today onward, monastery rules will be strictly enforced. Any violators will be expelled immediately!"

The monks stood frozen in silence.

Cloud Summit and his companion had been arrogant troublemakers. Their expulsion brought quiet relief to many.

Several monks silently thanked Evelyn in their hearts.

The blessing ceremony neared its end.

What should have been a highly anticipated event had lost its luster for the businessmen after the disruptions.

The final day's charity auction proceeded as scheduled.

The meditation hall was packed.

"Patron Evelyn."

Abbot Xingyun had been waiting under the eaves.

"Abbot." Evelyn gave a slight nod.

Sebastian Valdemar stepped forward naturally, positioning himself at her side.

Understanding flashed in the abbot's eyes as he moved aside.

Evelyn glanced at Sebastian but said nothing.

Scarlett Galatea caught the exchange.

Her grip tightened on her clutch, nails digging into her palms.

By the time she entered, the prime seats were already taken.

She could only sit far behind Sebastian, staring at his straight-backed silhouette.

These past two days, she'd used all her connections to investigate him—only to uncover mere public records.

The more enigmatic he remained, the more she longed to conquer him.

Five minutes until the auction began.

Isabella Langley and Oliver Valrose were still nowhere to be seen.

Abbot Xingyun checked his watch repeatedly as murmurs spread among the guests.
###Chapter 397

The atmosphere in the venue was tense.

Isabella Langley and Oliver Valrose were conspicuously absent.

Guests whispered among themselves, impatience written across their faces.

At exactly ten o'clock.

The grand doors finally swung open.

Two figures arrived fashionably late.

All eyes turned toward them.

Isabella entered gracefully on Oliver's arm.

Her makeup was flawless, her smile perfectly composed.

No trace remained of last night's humiliation.

Oliver strutted in his tailored suit, chest puffed out.

His bravado evaporated the moment he locked eyes with Evelyn Roland.

"Mr. Valdemar, I'm the Valrose family heir."

He extended his hand with obsequious eagerness.

Sebastian Valdemar didn't even glance his way.

Oliver's face darkened.

"Who does he think he is? A dying invalid!"

He muttered under his breath.

The words carried clearly to the front row.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial.

Sebastian chose that moment to turn his head.

Their eyes met.

"Don't."

"Let me."

They spoke simultaneously.

A dangerous smile curved Evelyn's lips.

"No one touches you while I'm here."

Sebastian chuckled softly.

"Agreed."

Bodyguards in the back row bowed their heads.

The Roland brothers clenched their fists until knuckles cracked.

Scarlett Galatea stared daggers at the couple.

Sebastian's profile had softened.

Showing tenderness she'd never witnessed before.

Isabella dug her nails into her palms.

"The charity auction will now commence."

Master Xingyun's voice rang out.

Novice monks filed in bearing trays.

The first few auction items failed to impress.

The crowd remained indifferent.

Until the rare calligraphy appeared.

Energy gradually built in the room.

"Next is a donation from Mr. Valrose."

All attention focused forward.

Isabella looked expectantly at her companion.

Oliver straightened his spine.

"Qing Dynasty jadeite rough stone. Estimated value: ten billion."

He announced with smug satisfaction.
###Chapter 398

The charity gala shimmered under dazzling chandeliers, their crystal prisms refracting blinding light.

Oliver Valrose stood onstage in an immaculate suit, his lips curved in a confident smile.

"On behalf of the Valrose Group, I donate this pair of Qing Dynasty jadeite bangles," he announced. "Appraised at one billion."

Gasps rippled through the crowd before he finished speaking.

"One billion?"
"Since when could the Valroses afford this?"
"Marrying into the Roland family really changed their fortunes."

Whispers crisscrossed the venue as tycoons craned their necks to glimpse the legendary bangles.

Alexander Roland's brow furrowed slightly as he studied the emerald-green bracelets on the velvet tray.

"Fine quality indeed," he murmured.

Evelyn Roland lounged in her seat, fingers drumming the armrest with detached elegance.

"Oliver is so dreamy!" Isabella Langley squealed, clinging to his arm with saccharine sweetness.

All eyes darted between Evelyn and Sebastian Valdemar.

"What treasure will Mr. Valdemar present?"
"It must surpass this, surely?"

Sebastian's sculpted face remained impassive as he twisted an antique jade ring around his finger.

"Miss Langley has exquisite taste!" someone fawned insincerely.

Isabella preened under the mixture of envy and flattery.

As the auction neared conclusion, Evelyn suddenly chuckled.

"Oliver Valrose," she drawled. "Are you certain these are Qing Dynasty pieces?"

The room froze.

Oliver's smile stiffened. "Naturally."

Evelyn rose leisurely, crimson lips parting. "That raw jade was privately held—never appeared on the market."

"What are you implying?" Oliver's voice tightened.

"I'm saying—" Her gaze turned glacial. "These are forgeries."

Beads of sweat dotted Oliver's forehead. "Preposterous! These are authenticated!"

Sebastian finally spoke, his voice arctic. "Shall we summon the appraisers?"

A tomb-like silence descended. Every guest held their breath.
###Chapter 399

Oliver Valrose's gaze lingered on Evelyn Roland's face, yet he couldn't decipher the depths in her eyes.

His fists clenched, nails digging into his palms.

This time, he had prepared thoroughly. He wouldn't let this scheming woman outmaneuver him again.

"Fake?"

"The Valrose family wouldn't dare pass off counterfeits, would they?"

"Miss Roland has always had a sharp eye. If she says it's fake, there must be a reason."

"Looks like someone's jealous her sister landed a good catch."

Whispers swirled around them, each comment making Oliver's expression darken further.

He had to regain control—now.

Isabella Langley had been basking in the attention when she suddenly sensed the shift in atmosphere.

Her sharp eyes locked onto Oliver.

"What's going on?"

Cold sweat trickled down Oliver's back.

He slammed his hands on the table and stood abruptly. "Evelyn Roland! The Valrose family may not compare to the Rolands, but we still have our dignity! This raw jade was my father's treasured heirloom for years! I only brought it out for this charity event!"

His voice trembled, eyes reddening like a wronged victim.

Evelyn let out a soft scoff.

"Treasured heirloom?"

She leisurely raised her phone, displaying a near-identical photo of a jade stone.

"Then explain, Mr. Valrose—why does this 'priceless heirloom' look exactly like the one in my photo?"

The stone in the image gleamed with luster, while the one on the tray appeared dull and lifeless.

"Th-that photo must be doctored!" Oliver's voice pitched higher.

The room erupted in murmurs.

Someone suggested quietly, "Should we ask Alexander Roland to authenticate it?"

Oliver's face drained of color.

He pointed accusingly at Evelyn. "I'll sue you for defamation!"

Evelyn responded with an elegant "be my guest" gesture.

Isabella's eyelid twitched violently.

She suddenly stepped forward, shooting Oliver a reproachful look. "Oliver, how could you speak to my sister like that?"

Her performance earned surprised glances from the crowd.
###Chapter 400

Oliver Valrose's palms grew clammy with sweat. He hadn't expected Evelyn Roland to be this relentless.

"Master Xingyun, shall we proceed with the ceremony?" Isabella Langley interjected smoothly, her lips curved in a practiced smile. "There are still important rituals awaiting us."

Several business tycoons nodded in agreement.

"Yes, let's not waste time."

Just as the abbot opened his mouth to speak, Evelyn suddenly raised her phone.

"Wait."

Her quiet command instantly silenced the entire meditation hall.

Oliver's stomach dropped.

"This Qing Dynasty jadeite rough stone appeared at last year's London auction." Evelyn tapped her screen lightly. "The official website has detailed records."

"Miss Roland!" Oliver snapped, his voice sharp. "You're deliberately causing trouble!"

Evelyn ignored him and dialed an international number.

"Hi, Charles."

Her flawless British accent stunned the room.

"Yes, that jadeite rough." She activated speakerphone. "Release the buyer's information and photos now."

An exaggerated gasp came through the line.

"My God! You've finally come to your senses! Is the stone still intact?"

"Save me a cutting! I owe the auction house director big time for helping you secure it!"

The man's excited chatter filled the hall, his rapid-fire English punctuated with enthusiasm.

"Shut up." Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Two minutes. No results, and you'll never speak again."

The line went dead silent.

Oliver's face darkened by the second.

"Stop this charade!" he hissed, voice trembling. "Evelyn Roland, you've crossed the line!"

Two minutes later, Evelyn lifted her gaze.

"Time's up."

She scanned the room. "Everyone, please check the auction house's official website for their latest announcement."

A chorus of notification chimes erupted.

When the photo loaded, the hall became tomb-silent.

The image showed Evelyn cradling an emerald-green rough stone, her smile serene.

"This..."

Someone whispered, "Could Mr. Valrose's stone be fake?"

"Impossible!" Oliver shot to his feet. "This must be photoshopped!"

His voice shook.

Evelyn pocketed her phone with deliberate slowness.

"Shall I request an authentication report from the auction house?" Her lips curved. "Or would you prefer an on-site appraisal, Mr. Valrose?"

Oliver's lips began to tremble.
###Chapter 401

"The photo is photoshopped. I have proof too."

Oliver Valrose stubbornly clung to his lie. Having set this trap, he'd naturally prepared a backup plan.

Evelyn Roland arched an eyebrow, a cold glint flashing in her eyes. "Really? Why don't you show us?"

Oliver pulled out his phone and displayed the photo to the crowd.

As the image circulated, murmurs rippled through the room.

Even the business tycoons who'd previously dismissed Oliver now looked unsettled.

Who would've thought this insignificant nobody had connections with the legendary Master Chen?

The elderly man in the photo, radiating vitality, was none other than Master Chen—the titan of the jewelry world.

These industry experts recognized the icon immediately.

"Mr. Valrose, you're close with Master Chen?"

"Could you introduce us?" A businessman pressed forward eagerly, eyes alight with fervor.

"That... might not be possible."

Evelyn scoffed softly.

"What about that raw jadeite? Are you considering selling it?" Several female entrepreneurs leaned in with keen interest.

"Has Master Chen released any new pieces recently?"

It was common knowledge that Master Chen not only appraised treasures but also crafted jade masterpieces himself.

Oliver's smile stiffened, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "I haven't been in touch lately. I wouldn't know."

How could he possibly know Master Chen's whereabouts? That photo was a shamelessly begged snapshot—the old master didn't even recognize him.

"Could you ask him next time you meet?"

"Y-yes, of course."

Oliver forced a nod, his stomach churning.

When would he ever cross paths with Master Chen again? Last time, he'd waited outside the man's residence for weeks without catching a glimpse.

"Mr. Valrose, could you share Master Chen's contact?"

A vein throbbed at Oliver's temple.

"That... isn't appropriate."

If he actually had Master Chen's number, would he be putting on this charade?

At least no one would dare verify it here. A little boasting never hurt anyone.

Oliver straightened slightly, regaining some false confidence.

At the front, Evelyn rested her chin on one hand, expression cool.

But Sebastian Valdemar beside her recognized the calm before the storm.

Her lips curled into a frosty smile.

"Since you're so close with Master Chen, why not call him right now?" Evelyn snapped her fingers. "Let's all witness this special connection. You wouldn't refuse, would you?"
###Chapter 402

Oliver Valrose felt cold sweat trickling down his back, his palms damp with perspiration. He forced himself to straighten his posture, though his voice wavered noticeably. "Mr. Chen is a busy man. There's no need to trouble him with such trivial matters."

Evelyn Roland tapped her phone screen lightly, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

Under the conference hall lights, the diamond studs on her earlobes glinted sharply.

"Five minutes," she said, sweeping her gaze across the room. "Any objections?"

The business tycoons exchanged glances. Some had already pulled out their phones to record the scene.

Oliver clenched his fists, his nails digging into his palms.

"Evelyn!" His voice trembled. "Must you humiliate me in public?"

She turned abruptly, the hem of her black blazer dress slicing through the air with precision.

"Scared?"

Those two words stabbed straight into Oliver's chest.

The room fell silent. All eyes locked onto Oliver's ashen face.

Master Xingyun retreated two steps silently, his prayer beads spinning rapidly between his fingers.

"I have Mr. Chen's private number right here," Evelyn lifted her phone. "Shall we verify?"

Oliver staggered back, knocking over a chair. Isabella Langley's gasp was drowned in the rising murmurs.

"Impossible!" His voice cracked. "A nouveau riche like you could never—"

Sebastian Valdemar stood abruptly, his black trench coat stirring a cold gust.

"One more word," he said, staring at Oliver's trembling fingers, "and you'll leave here on a stretcher."

The tycoons inhaled sharply. Someone recognized the Valdemar heir and urgently tugged at their companion's sleeve.

Evelyn had already initiated the video call, turning her phone toward the crowd.

The moment the screen lit up, Oliver's legs gave way, sending him crashing to his knees.

"It's Mr. Chen!" someone in the front row gasped.

The white-haired elder on screen sipped his tea, his face lighting up with affection when he saw Evelyn. "Little Evelyn..."

Isabella's handbag hit the floor with a sharp thud.

In the deathly silence, only Oliver's ragged breathing was audible. He stared at the tile seams as if willing the ground to swallow him whole.
###Chapter 403

Isabella Langley's face turned deathly pale in an instant, her fingers unconsciously clutching the hem of her dress.

She whipped her head around to glare at Oliver Valrose.

"This can't be..."

A faint, almost imperceptible smile played at the corners of Evelyn Roland's lips, but her eyes remained icy cold.

Beads of sweat dotted Oliver Valrose's forehead.

"Surely you're joking, Miss Roland?"

The murmurs in the venue grew louder.

"Look at Mr. Valrose's expression..."

"Could he actually be lying?"

Several businessmen who had been standing near Oliver instinctively took half a step back.

Oliver's hands trembled slightly.

"How could Elder Chen possibly know her?"

"Don't forget who stands behind the Roland family."

A few middle-aged men tried to sound defiant, but their eyes darted nervously.

The atmosphere in the room grew increasingly tense.

The tide was turning.

Some began discreetly examining the photograph.

"This photo..."

"It does look rather suspicious..."

Evelyn's slender finger tapped lightly on her screen.

The sharp ringtone of a video call pierced the silence of the conference room.

Elder Chen shot to his feet.

His thermos clattered to the floor with a crisp sound.

"Elder Chen?"

"Silence!"

The old man's hands shook visibly.

The room fell deathly quiet.

Everyone held their breath.

"Project it! Now!"

Elder Chen's voice carried an urgency rarely heard.

His assistant fumbled with the equipment in a panic.

Evelyn's composed face appeared on the large screen.

"Elder Chen."

That single address made the entire room gasp in unison.
###Chapter 404

The video call connected, revealing a stunning face on the large screen.

What caught everyone's attention first wasn't her delicate features, but those deep, ink-black eyes.

Her gaze was sharp as a blade, making the executives in the conference room hold their breaths in unison.

"Is... this a little girl?"

Someone gasped, disbelief thick in their voice.

Who would've thought the person Old Chen held in such high regard was a breathtakingly beautiful young woman?

Old Chen, now devoid of his earlier authority, beamed with unrestrained joy. He waved at the screen. "Evelyn, you finally remembered to call this old man?"

In the meditation hall, Evelyn Roland curved her lips slightly. "How have you been, Old Chen?"

Her gentle tone was a stark contrast to the sharpness from moments ago.

"Never better!" Old Chen's laughter deepened the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. "That prescription you gave me works wonders. I can climb mountains without breaking a sweat now."

He leaned closer to the camera like a mischievous grandfather showing off to his granddaughter.

The conference room fell silent.

The Roland family turned in unison, four pairs of eyes fixed on Evelyn.

Sebastian Valdemar's gaze flickered, his eyes reflecting only her.

No one had expected this seemingly aloof young woman to share such a close bond with Old Chen.

Evelyn gave a brief explanation.

Six months ago, Old Chen had suffered a sudden heart attack on the street. She happened to pass by and saved him with her extraordinary acupuncture skills, pulling him back from death's door.

Later, Old Chen tracked her down to Château Blanc, and their relationship deepened. With no children of his own, he treated her like a beloved granddaughter.

Recalling this, Old Chen's eyes shimmered with affection.

The conference room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

All eyes turned to Oliver Valrose, their gazes practically screaming, What do you have to say now?

Oliver squirmed under the scrutiny before suddenly slamming the table. "You think you can fool everyone with some random old man? Evelyn, do you take us for idiots?"

He pulled out his phone with a sneer. "Let me call the real Old Chen. Then we'll see how you explain this!"

The crowd's expressions turned odd.

Evelyn merely arched a brow, not even bothering to lift her eyelids.
###Chapter 405

A thunderous roar erupted from the phone.

"How dare you!"

On the projection screen in the meditation hall, Elder Chen abruptly stood, slamming his palm on the table. Behind him, a dozen experts in the conference room rose in unison, their piercing gazes fixed on the screen.

Silver-haired yet ramrod straight, Elder Chen's usually warm eyes now gleamed like sharpened blades.

"It seems I've been too modest these years."

His voice boomed with unquestionable authority.

Everyone in the industry knew Elder Chen's esteemed reputation. Countless elites had begged for his appraisal of rare treasures, only to be politely declined. Yet now, some insolent brat dared insult him—and even dragged Evelyn Roland into this disgrace.

Evelyn stood quietly to the side, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"Oliver?"

Elder Chen narrowed his eyes, scanning the screen.

"Oliver Valrose," Evelyn supplied smoothly, tilting the camera toward the man's greasy, bloated face.

"Stop pretending, old man!" Oliver Valrose jutted his chin defiantly. "How much did Evelyn pay you? I'll double it!"

He waved his phone triumphantly, displaying a group photo as if it were some winning card.

"If you know me, then you should know I never take private commissions," Elder Chen sneered. "What exactly have you been doing under my name?"

Gasps filled the room.

"He claimed to have taken a photo with you and that you authenticated Jadeite Mansion's raw stone," Evelyn said coolly.

Someone immediately snatched Oliver's phone and aimed it at the camera.

"A group photo from a charity event," Elder Chen dismissed with one glance. "There were over a hundred people in that shot. Is that supposed to mean something?"

A chorus of sharp inhales followed.

"Such audacity!" Elder Chen's laughter was laced with fury.

"So that raw stone..." someone stammered.

"Is a fake," Evelyn cut in.

Oliver's forehead glistened with sweat. "You're lying!"

"Because the real one—" Evelyn leisurely drew a velvet box from her bag, "is right here."

The moment she opened it, the room seemed to glow.

Oliver's legs gave out, and he collapsed heavily into his chair.
###Chapter 406

"This can't be..."

Oliver Valrose's face turned deathly pale as he repeated the words, his lips trembling.

His fingers dug into his palms, but he felt no pain.

"Evelyn, you actually have the raw stone from Jadeite Mansion?" Alexander Roland's eyes gleamed, his voice rising with excitement.

"Thanks to Mr. Chen's help."

In the video, Mr. Chen chuckled and waved his hand. "You're too kind, Evelyn. I've recently acquired a batch of raw stones myself. They may not compare to Jadeite Mansion's, but the quality is decent. I'll bring them to A City for you to see another time."

"Thank you, Mr. Chen."

His words struck Oliver like a sledgehammer, rooting him to the spot.

"Mr. Chen, I have matters to attend to now. Let's talk another day."

The video ended abruptly.

The venue fell into stunned silence.

Everyone needed a moment to process this shocking twist.

"Oliver Valrose, do you have anything else to say?"

Evelyn Roland's voice was sharp as a blade, aimed directly at him.

The crowd's gazes toward him shifted instantly.

"Trash from a minor family. No class at all."

"Faking wealth in front of the real deal. Unbelievable."

"I actually believed his lies earlier!"

Oliver squirmed in his seat.

Cold sweat soaked through his shirt, trickling down his spine.

He suddenly jerked his head up, eyes darting toward the exit.

"Move!"

He lunged for the door.

But security had already stationed themselves there, grabbing him by the collar and hauling him up.

"Let me go!"

Oliver thrashed wildly, like a fish out of water.

"I warned you not to provoke me." Evelyn approached slowly, her heels clicking crisply against the floor. "Since you dared to come, you'll pay the price."

"Evelyn Roland! You set me up!"

"Only realizing it now? Too late."

Sebastian Valdemar spoke coldly. "How should we handle this?"

"Hand him over to the police." Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "There's still another debt he hasn't settled."

She hadn't forgotten the knife he'd used to stab Alice.

Applause suddenly broke out.

A well-dressed lawyer stepped forward from the crowd.

"Miss Roland."

"He's all yours."

Sebastian gave a signal, and security dragged Oliver away. The lawyer followed closely behind.

"Isabella! Help me!" Oliver suddenly shrieked. "This was all—"

Isabella Langley cowered in a corner, wishing she could strangle this idiot.

Suppressing her fury, she forced out a few tears. "Oliver... I'm so disappointed in you... I really thought you were an honorable man..."

Evelyn crossed her arms, watching the farce unfold with icy detachment.

"Everyone, let's resume the charity auction." Scarlett Galatea smoothly stepped in to diffuse the tension.
###Chapter 407

The air in the venue suddenly turned heavy.

Business tycoons exchanged glances, their eyes lingering on Scarlett Galatea.

As Oliver Valrose was escorted out by security, his shouts dissolved into the murmuring crowd.

Isabella Langley finally relaxed her stiff shoulders, casting a grateful look toward Scarlett.

"Scarlett Galatea, current CEO of Galatea Group."

Her posture was impeccable, her voice crisp and commanding.

The name "Galatea" struck like lightning through A City's business circle. Recognition flashed across several faces as someone eagerly stepped forward.

"CEO Galatea! What an honor to finally meet you!"

The man clasped Scarlett's hand with excessive enthusiasm, his ingratiating smile stretching wide.

A novice monk struggled with the weight of Scarlett's lavish donation, glancing helplessly at Master Xingyun.

But the abbot's gaze remained fixed on Evelyn Roland.

Scarlett's fingertips trembled slightly.

Only when Evelyn gave a subtle nod did the auction resume.

Scarlett bowed gracefully to the audience.

The first item was unveiled—a faded ancient painting, its misty landscapes whispering of centuries past.

"A genuine Wang Wei!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Evelyn's pupils contracted. Her peripheral vision flickered toward Sebastian Valdemar's direction.

Bidding erupted like wildfire.

Scarlett's attention clung to Sebastian's impassive profile.

As numbers skyrocketed, her pulse accelerated.

When the gavel struck at fifty million, the ghost of a smile touched her lips.

Subsequent items fetched astronomical prices.

Applause surged like tidal waves.

Blood seeped from Scarlett's clenched palms, yet she felt no pain.

Her focus never wavered from that indifferent figure.

Until Evelyn rose.

Sebastian stirred abruptly.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn with magnetic intensity.

"My donation."

Evelyn opened a brocade box. Twin pink pearls shimmered with ethereal radiance.

A beat of stunned silence.

"Twenty million!"

"Thirty!"

Numbers rocketed upward.

"Eighty million."

Sebastian's voice sliced through the clamor like a blade.

The room held its breath.

Evelyn met his stare, the corner of her mouth lifting.

She'd anticipated this.

"Eighty million, going once!"

Master Xingyun raised the auction hammer.

"Eighty million, going twice!"

Just as the hammer began its descent—

"One hundred million."

A cool female voice cut through the tension.
###Chapter 408

"Ninety million!"

Alexander Roland raised his bidding paddle, his voice ringing with conviction.

He shot Sebastian Valdemar a challenging glance before winking triumphantly at Evelyn.

That look screamed—Watch your big brother back you up!

Evelyn massaged her temples.

Her third brother's childish antics left her torn between laughter and exasperation.

Every eye in the room turned toward Sebastian.

The two men locked gazes across the auction hall, the air between them crackling with tension.

Ten seconds of deafening silence.

Master Xingyun wiped his sweaty brow, voice trembling. "Ninety million, going once—"

Just as the gavel was about to fall—

"One hundred million."

Sebastian's deep voice detonated through the venue.

Gasps erupted.

A pair of pearls fetching such an astronomical sum!

Even the seasoned Master Xingyun stood frozen in shock.

Alexander clenched his fists, his glare sharp enough to draw blood.

This bastard!

Did money give him the right to trample over everything?

Stealing his sister's spotlight right in front of him!

From the shadows, Vincent Valdemar narrowed his eyes.

He'd never imagined his calculating nephew could be this reckless.

For a woman, he'd throw away a hundred million without blinking?

Scarlett Galatea dug her nails into her palms until crescent marks bloomed.

"Sold for one hundred million!"

When the pearls were delivered to Sebastian, Scarlett swayed, vision darkening at the edges.

"Mr. Valdemar is so devoted!"

"A hundred million!"

"If a man did that for me, I'd marry him on the spot!"

Amidst the whispers, Scarlett's face turned ashen.

During the charity segment, Evelyn's donated treasures took center stage one after another.

Scarlett's moment in the spotlight faded into oblivion.

After the ceremony, Master Xingyun personally escorted them out.

"You two are truly fated by the heavens."

Sebastian's lips curved. "Thank you for your blessing, Master."

Evelyn blinked, offering no reply.

"Until we meet again."

As the crowd dispersed, tranquility returned to the temple.

Inside the main hall, Alice Flores knelt in devout prayer.

"May Buddha protect Miss Roland with peace and happiness."

On the mountain path, Scarlett trailed behind Sebastian like a lost ghost.

Vincent Valdemar strolled past, murmuring, "Miss Galatea, where sincerity reaches, even metal and stone will yield."
###Chapter 409

The Roland mansion blazed with light as Isabella Langley stepped inside.

Servants bustled about as usual, the familiar scent of incense drifting through the grand foyer.

Yet her footsteps grew heavier with each step.

"Young Miss is home." The butler took her purse, his gaze flickering uneasily.

In the dining room, Sophia Roland arranged flowers, offering only a curt nod at her entrance.

"Mother—" Isabella began, but Sophia had already turned to discuss dinner preparations.

Julian Roland's booming laughter echoed from the second floor—until she ascended the stairs. Then silence.

Her phone vibrated. Oliver Valrose's name flashed on screen, making her fingers tremble.

"How much longer for the money?" The voice rasped like sandpaper.

She locked herself in the bathroom. Dark circles bruised the reflection staring back.

"I need more time—"

"Time? My family's company is collapsing!" Oliver's whisper turned venomous. "Remember who helped you—"

Water gushed from the faucet. She scrubbed her wrists raw, as if washing away invisible stains.

At breakfast, her silver spoon clattered to the floor.

"Young Miss?" A maid offered fresh cutlery, eyes lingering on the faint bruise circling Isabella's neck.

"Stop staring!" Isabella shoved back her chair. Milk splashed across the linen like spilled secrets.

Sophia frowned. "Compose yourself, Isabella."

"Compose myself?" Her laugh cracked. "Where was this concern when Evelyn humiliated my fiancé in public?"

Edward Roland lowered his newspaper. "Oliver brought that on himself."

"Exactly!" Alexander Roland descended the stairs. "That con artist deserves—"

"You know nothing!" Isabella hurled her napkin down. "If not for Evelyn—"

She bit her tongue. Copper flooded her mouth.

The phone rang again. Owen Valrose this time.

She fled upstairs, only answering after the lock clicked.

"Three days. Roland funds in my account." The voice could've frozen hell. "Or else—"

Knuckles rapped the door.

"Isabella?" Sophia's voice filtered through the wood. "Open up."

She deleted the call log. By the time the door opened, her eyes swam with practiced tears.

"Mother..." The sob came on cue. "Why must Evelyn destroy my happiness?"

Sophia's hand hovered, then fell. "Some people are rotten to the core."

"But—"

"End it." Edward materialized in the hallway. "I'll introduce you to better matches."

Julian leaned against the wall. "The Chamberlain heir just returned from Oxford—"

"No!" Isabella grabbed her purse and ran, vision blurred.

She missed the loaded glance her parents exchanged.

Meanwhile, atop Jadeite Mansion...

Evelyn Roland set down her phone, the butler's message still glowing: Follow Young Miss Isabella?

Her fingertip traced a surveillance photo—Oliver Valrose gambling away millions.

A frosty smile curved her lips. "Let the dominoes fall a little longer."
###Chapter 410

Isabella's actions were downright bizarre.

A man like Oliver Valrose was so repulsive even stray dogs would avoid him. Given Isabella's temperament, she should have steered clear.

Yet she repeatedly defended him.

"Interesting."

Evelyn Roland tapped her fingers lightly on the desk, staring at her phone screen. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting golden patterns across the surface.

Seven days after the blessing ceremony.

The business world in City A remained eerily calm, as if Sebastian Valdemar's warning at the temple had never happened.

But undercurrents were stirring.

Small businesses vanished one by one, like grains of sand swept away by the tide. Evelyn only noticed the pattern when Theodore Ashcroft mentioned it casually.

"Your doing?"

Sebastian walked in, noticeably thinner. His cheekbones stood out sharply, dark circles shadowing his eyes.

"Just tidying up loose ends."

He said it as casually as discussing the weather. Evelyn's chest warmed, as if someone had stuffed cotton into her heart.

May 15th, Fortune Ranking release day.

The entire city held its breath.

In subway cars, office workers stared at their phones. Break rooms in skyscrapers overflowed. Even shopkeepers paused their work.

8:59 AM.

The countdown began.

"Three, two, one—"

At exactly 9:00 AM, the website crashed for fifteen minutes.

When the page finally refreshed, jaws dropped across the business district.

"Sebastian Valdemar!"

"Evelyn Roland?!"

The top name was expected. But the second-place ranking sent shockwaves through the financial world. Some frantically refreshed the page. Others called the statistics bureau directly.

Sebastian's lips curved slightly as he stared at the screen.

He opened WhatsApp, typing "Congratulations"—just as her identical message popped up.

A low chuckle escaped him, bringing faint color to his pale face.

"Sir, the reports."

Theodore entered to find his boss smiling at his phone. The sight made him freeze—how long had it been since Sebastian smiled like that?

As he set down the files, Theodore glimpsed the computer screen.

His expression turned peculiar.

At this rate, his CEO might become City A's most expensive "kept man."
###Chapter 411

Rain lashed against the windows like bullets, the heavy drops cracking against the glass. I curled into the corner of the sofa, fingers twisting the edge of the blanket absently.

My phone screen lit up. A message from Liam: "I'm downstairs."

I bolted upright, the blanket slipping to the floor. Through the downpour, I could barely make out his silhouette beneath a black umbrella, standing under the streetlamp as water cascaded from its edges.

"What are you doing here?" I stood in the doorway, rain soaking the cuffs of my pants.

He closed the umbrella, droplets sliding from his hair. "I heard you quit."

I turned away, nails digging into my palms. "Just company layoffs."

"Really?" He stepped closer, the chill of rain clinging to him. "Then why did HR say you resigned voluntarily?"

I bit my lip, throat tight. Raindrops fell from the eaves, forming a curtain between us.

"Come back with me." He held out his hand, palm up. "The board reversed their decision."

I stared at his slender fingers, still glistening with rain. "You know I won't."

"Why?" His voice sharpened. "Because I didn't tell you about the acquisition?"

The downpour drowned out my sigh. I turned to leave, but he grabbed my wrist.

"Let go!" I struggled, rainwater soaking my sleeve.

He didn't budge, his gaze cutting like steel. "You think quitting solves anything?"

I yanked free, stumbling back against the doorframe. "At least I won't have to see you every day!"

Lightning split the sky, illuminating his suddenly pale face. Beneath the thunder, I heard him murmur, "So that's how you feel."

Water trailed down his jaw—rain or something else. He turned and walked into the storm, leaving the black umbrella by the door.

I stared at it, the fabric already saturated. In the distance, an engine roared to life, taillights blurring in the rain.

My phone lit again. An unknown number: "Bring your designs to headquarters tomorrow. 9 AM."

I clenched the phone, droplets from my hair splashing the screen. Outside, the storm raged on.

"Those bald monks from Westminster Abbey wouldn't miss a chance to cozy up to Lady Margaret."

The black-clad man's eyes gleamed. "You mean..."

Gongsun Zan clutched his bleeding wound, teeth gritted. "Exactly!"

"Once I recover, we'll join forces with Westminster Abbey and turn this region's underworld into a river of blood!"

"That brat emperor secretly trained such elite royal guards—no wonder he ruined our plans!"

He staggered to his feet, face contorted with pain as his wound tore open.

"Move out!"

A carrier pigeon soared northwest with a sealed message.

Gongsun Zan fled toward the Appalachian Mountains, seething with hatred.

The next dawn.

Imperial Consort Evelyn's chambers were warm with fragrant incense.

Emperor Nathan buried his face in the snow-white curve of her neck when hurried footsteps echoed outside.

"Your Majesty!"

Royal guard Luna knelt on one knee. "Elder Feng reports—Westminster Abbey has sent envoys!"

Nathan's head snapped up. "The abbot himself?"

"Only Abbot Juexiu from the outer temple, with two junior monks."

Nathan rose with a cold laugh. "Their noses are sharp indeed."

"Evelyn, help me dress!"

The imperial study wafted with sandalwood incense.

"Amitabha. This humble monk greets Your Majesty."

Abbot Juexiu bowed respectfully with his disciples.

Nathan's gaze was razor-sharp from the throne. "Abbot, did you just wish me 'ten thousand years' of life?"

"If I don't live that long... wouldn't that be treason?"

Juexiu's expression flickered. He clasped his hands. "Your Majesty's achievements will endure through eternity."

"Hah!"

Nathan slammed the table, sending teacup shards flying. "What silver-tongued monks!"

Juexiu frowned. "What does Your Majesty imply?"

"Imply?" Nathan's eyes narrowed. "Your oily complexion suggests generous temple donations fund your feasts."

Juexiu's voice hardened. "The pure need no defense."

"Pure?" Nathan's roar shook the room. "Your disciple wore black brocade from Xingnan Cloth Shop—the same shop massacred to the last soul!"

Monk Jiexin paled.

A shadow crossed Juexiu's eyes before his benign mask returned. "Your Majesty, the foolish novice stole temple funds—"

"Bullshit!"

Nathan shattered another teacup. "Do I look like a child to you?!"
###Chapter 412

Bianca Savigny had been gushing over Evelyn Roland for a full hour, her enthusiastic praise making Evelyn's ears ring.

Her phone suddenly buzzed violently.

Ding!
Ding!
Ding!

Messages flooded in one after another.

Alexander Roland. Julian Roland. Edward Roland. Sophia Roland. Sebastian Valdemar. Olivia Valdemar...

A cascade of bank transfer notifications.

Each one came with a note: "You must accept this."

Evelyn's lips curved into an involuntary smile.

Their unanimous concern warmed her heart.

Meanwhile, the financial world of City A was in an uproar.

The moment the Fortune Ranking was announced, the entire business sector reeled.

Château Blanc and CH Jewelry Inc. saw their stock prices skyrocket, with related discussions breaking a million mentions.

"Evelyn Roland!"

Vincent Valdemar stared at his computer screen, grinding his teeth.

What chilled him more was the crisis befalling every company that had insulted Evelyn at Mount Pilatus.

Vanity Jewelry had vanished without a trace.

The shareholders of another conglomerate were dumping their stocks.

Behind it all, Sebastian Valdemar and the Roland Group's influence was unmistakable.

A cold sweat broke on Vincent's forehead.

He had to act fast.

The ripple effects of the Fortune Ranking spread even further.

Countless elite families began plotting marriage alliances.

"If only we could marry Evelyn Roland..."
"Where else would you find a daughter-in-law like her?"

The next morning, both the Roland Estate and Château Blanc were simultaneously besieged.

A line of luxury cars stretched a kilometer from the estate gates.

The entrance to the winery was completely blocked.

"We're here as customers!"
"Let us see Miss Roland!"

The head of security stood stone-faced at the winery entrance. "No invitation, no entry."

A few slick-haired heirs stamped their feet in frustration. "Do you know who my father is?"

But such tactics held no weight on Roland territory.

Both locations remained impenetrable. Not a single intruder caught even a glimpse of Evelyn.
###Chapter 413

Thorn Yen's lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained cold as she stared at him in silence.

Blake Koo felt his temple throb under her gaze.

"Is the Koo residence not good enough for you?" His voice turned icy. "The Moss family would skin you alive if they could. Why would they gift you a property?"

"True," Thorn Yen chuckled. "If not for me, Aurora Moss wouldn't be living her extravagant life abroad."

The Moss family's political ties restricted them domestically. Overseas, Aurora Moss indulged in luxury, changing designer items more frequently than clothes.

Blake Koo's gaze flickered to Thorn Yen's scarred hand, and his tone softened. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be," she replied flatly. "You have the right to speak your mind."

His face darkened instantly.

He seized her wrist and dragged her toward the door.

"Where are we going?" Thorn Yen frowned. "I have plans."

"To broaden your horizons," he sneered. "Selling out your husband for a fourth-ring property? Impressive, Thorn Yen."

True to his word, he took her to elite real estate showings, luxury car galleries, and high-end jewelry boutiques.

Staring at a seven-figure diamond ring, Thorn Yen suddenly asked, "Can I take it after the divorce?"

"Are you a gold digger?" Blake Koo gritted his teeth.

She closed the catalog. "If I can't keep it, this is a waste of time."

A nearby sales associate broke into a cold sweat, fearing the deal would collapse.

"It's yours if you stay married," Blake Koo said stiffly.

"Why?" Thorn Yen met his gaze directly.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I think our current arrangement works."

"I don't," she countered with a mocking smile. "Every day with you is torture."

She grabbed her purse and left, abandoning a livid Blake Koo and a despairing sales associate.

Thorn Yen headed to her usual boutique. The store buzzed with chatter, but two words pierced through—"Xu family" and "Moss family."

"Did you hear Reed Tsui is marrying Aurora Moss?"

"The Tsuis are selling their son for connections!"

"Would Miss Mu really give up on Young Master Gu?"

"Master Gu doesn't even love his wife..."

Thorn Yen whirled around. "What did you just say?"

The two gossiping girls startled.

"Reed Tsui is marrying Aurora Moss?" Thorn Yen's voice tightened.

"None of your business," one girl muttered.

Thorn Yen smirked. "I'm the 'unworthy wife' you're talking about."

She stormed out, fingers trembling as she dialed Reed Tsui's number.

"You're marrying Aurora Moss?" Her tone was terrifyingly calm.
###Chapter 414 
The night was ink-black. Sebastian Valdemar's slender fingers lightly tapped the rim of his glass, the amber liquid glinting under the dim light.

Zachary Merouin threw back a shot of whiskey, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Seb, the rumors are everywhere. The Rolands' doorstep is practically worn out from all the marriage proposals."

Sebastian's gaze darkened, his knuckles turning white.

"Even the Laurents from the capital sent someone," Zachary added with a smirk. "But then again, someone like Evelyn Roland—"

"Enough."

Zachary shrugged and changed the subject. "Seriously, if you don't make a move soon, she'll slip through your fingers."

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, neon lights flickered. Sebastian stared at his reflection in the glass, suddenly recalling how Evelyn had been the center of attention at last week's gala.

"I bet she's into you," Zachary leaned in. "At the charity ball, she stole seven glances at you."

Sebastian's fingers twitched.

"Call her now." Zachary slid a phone across the table. "Just say—"

"My heart hurts," Sebastian blurted out.

The moment the call connected, his voice melted into liquid warmth. "Miss Roland."

The hum of a hairdryer filled the line. Evelyn's voice, still damp from her shower, came through. "Mr. Valdemar?"

"Can you come to Blenheim Palace?" He muffled a cough into the receiver. "My chest feels... tight."

Zachary bit his lip, shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.

"Do you need an ambulance?" Evelyn's tone sharpened with concern.

"No." Sebastian watched Zachary mouth exaggerated words and deadpanned, "I just... want to see you."

Silence.

Three ticks of his watch later, she replied, "Give me twenty minutes."

As the call ended, Zachary whistled. "Oscar-worthy performance, boss."

Sebastian adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate slowness, a dangerous glint in his eyes. "An ambulance should be called."

"Huh?"

"For you." He grabbed his coat. "One word about this, and you'll be managing our African branch by sunrise."

Zachary burst out laughing as his friend strode away. The glass reflected his gleeful smirk—tonight's drama beat any boardroom negotiation.
###Chapter 415

"Send me the address. I'll be right there."

Evelyn Roland set down her medical textbook, fingertips tapping twice on the desk.

The toxin in Sebastian Valdemar's system remained a ticking time bomb. The memory of his last episode still haunted her. She couldn't afford to delay, grabbing her coat as she headed out.

His deep voice resonated through the phone. "Understood."

His knuckles whitened around the phone. A sip of red wine slid down his throat, the burn failing to quell the restless heat in his chest.

The call ended with crisp efficiency.

Zachary Merouin stared at his friend as if seeing a ghost.

Sebastian continued sipping his wine, long fingers tracing the rim of the glass.

"Tsk tsk tsk..." Zachary drawled. "With acting skills like that, it's a crime you haven't won an Oscar."

Sebastian lifted his gaze, eyes clear and composed. "Problem?"

"Problem? Hell yes!" Zachary clutched his chest dramatically. "If Dr. Roland finds out you're faking—"

"Not your concern."

The blunt reply left Zachary speechless. After a beat, he managed, "When did you become such a manipulative bastard?"

Sebastian didn't grace him with a glance.

"Hey!" Zachary leaned in. "I've got way more experience chasing girls. Want some—"

"Pass." Sebastian cut him off. "Single men's advice holds zero value."

Zachary nearly launched out of his seat. "Excuse you! I turned down a supermodel two days ago!"

Sebastian swirled his wine and dropped a single syllable. "Oh."

The tone made Zachary want to hurl his glass.

The private lounge door swung open. Both men turned.

Evelyn stood at the threshold, the hem of her lab coat revealing slender ankles. Her gaze swept over the array of liquor bottles before curving into a knowing smirk.

"Mr. Valdemar's angina has improved, I see?"

Zachary felt an icy prickle down his neck.

"Dr. Roland." Sebastian rose, his stare burning.

Zachary hurried to mediate. "First time meeting. I'm Zachary Merouin."

"Pleasure." Evelyn gave a slight nod, though her attention never wavered from Sebastian. "Seems my concern was unnecessary."

Sebastian remained unflinching. "I was in discomfort earlier."

Electricity crackled between their locked gazes.

Zachary suddenly raised his glass. "Care for a taste, Doctor?"

"Certainly." She accepted the drink, her fingers brushing Sebastian's knuckles.

Zachary shot his friend a meaningful look, whispering, "Not from Château Blanc, but still exquisite."
###Chapter 416

Zachary poured Evelyn half a glass of red wine.

"Meeting for the first time under such circumstances. I'll make it up to you properly another time."

He raised his glass. Evelyn lightly clinked hers against the rim, her lips curving slightly. "No need for formalities."

As she tilted her head back to drink, Zachary's gaze lingered on her.

Now he understood why his friend had been so infatuated with this woman.

Evelyn carried herself with innate elegance, and her face was utterly captivating.

Zachary tactfully checked his watch and stood to leave.

The moment the private room door closed, the air grew still.

"Something troubles you, Mr. Valdemar."

Evelyn's tone was certain.

"Congratulations on reaching second place on the Fortune Ranking."

Sebastian deftly sidestepped her observation.

"Likewise."

Two empty wine glasses later, the night had deepened.

Sebastian's right hand clenched and unclenched at his side, his knuckles turning white.

"Ah—"

He suddenly stood, the room spinning violently around him.

An unfamiliar heat surged through his veins.

Something was wrong.

He pressed his fingers hard against his temples.

Evelyn turned at the sound, her bag in hand, just as the man staggered, his face flushed as he massaged his forehead.

"Don't move."

She strode forward to assess him, her expression sharpening instantly.

Sebastian fought to stay conscious, but his vision blurred further.

Evelyn understood immediately—he'd been drugged.

The only person who could've tampered with his drink was Zachary, who'd just left.

"Get out!"

The words tore from Sebastian's gritted teeth as he stumbled toward the bathroom.

The sound of running water filled the space as he submerged himself under the cold stream.

Evelyn waited outside, an inexplicable tightness in her chest.

The water stopped, but his condition worsened.

"Sebastian." Her voice was soft.

"Why are you still here?" His voice was ragged.

"You'll hurt yourself like this."

She reached for his hand. The scorching heat of his skin startled her.

He tried to pull away, but her grip tightened.

"Stop torturing yourself."

His head snapped up. Bloodshot eyes locked onto hers.

His fingers absently traced the back of her hand as he rasped, "Do you have any idea what you're doing, Ms. Roland?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. The next words came through clenched teeth.

"I'm a man. A very... normal man."
###Chapter 417

"I'm completely sober."

Evelyn Roland's whisper ignited the air like a spark.

The private room's soundproofing swallowed all noise, leaving only their interwoven breaths. Sebastian Valdemar's chest heaved violently, his Adam's apple bobbing as he fought for control.

His knuckles turned white.

He abruptly released her wrist and stepped back.

Evelyn advanced instead, her stilettos sinking soundlessly into the plush carpet. Tilting her chin up, she parted her crimson lips. "What are you afraid of, Mr. Valdemar?"

"Don't play with fire." His voice was gravel-rough.

"What if I refuse?"

Rising onto her toes, she enveloped him in the scent of roses. Sebastian's pupils contracted—the last thread of his restraint snapping.

His arm banded around her waist.

Heat seared through fabric to brand her skin. His other hand gripped her jaw, thumb grinding against her lower lip.

"You'll regret this."

The warning dissolved against her mouth as he claimed her in a savage kiss. It was all teeth and desperation, a caged beast finally unleashed.

Evelyn laughed into his mouth.

Her arms twined around his neck, feeling every muscle in his body lock. The response shattered Sebastian completely. He cradled her skull, deepening the kiss with ruthless intent.

Breaths tangled.

The clash of lips and tongues turned punishing. Sebastian kissed like he wanted to devour her whole. Pinned between the cold wall and his scorching body, Evelyn arched against him.

A gasp escaped her as oxygen dwindled. Instinct made her bite down. Sebastian groaned—not in pain, but dark exhilaration. He wrenched both wrists above her head, knee forcing her thighs apart.

"Too late to stop now."

His voice dripped with predatory hunger. The collar of his shirt gaped open, revealing the sharp lines of his collarbones. This feral version of Sebastian made Evelyn's pulse stutter.

Beneath that polished exterior lurked a primal predator.

His mouth trailed fire down her neck, branding her collarbone with crimson marks. Evelyn tipped her head back, feeling the coiled tension in his frame—a volcano on the verge of eruption.

"That hurts—"

Her breathy protest earned tighter restraint. Sebastian's heated exhale scorched her ear. "We're just getting started."
###Chapter 418

"Sebastian!"

Evelyn suddenly grasped the man's wandering hand, her fingertips trembling slightly. She tilted her head up to meet his lust-darkened gaze. "Look at me. Who am I?"

"Evelyn..." His voice was rough, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Before he could finish, his lips crashed down on hers, searing and possessive. The strap of her dress slipped off her shoulder, revealing skin like polished pearls in the dim light.

"I love you..." Sebastian murmured against her neck, leaving a trail of red marks in his wake.

Evelyn's eyes grew damp, her nails digging into his back. Wave after wave of pleasure crashed over her, leaving her clinging to him like he was her only lifeline.

At two in the morning, the storm finally subsided.

Exhausted, Evelyn couldn't even lift a finger. Half-asleep, she felt someone gently caress her cheek.

"Thank you." Sebastian gazed at her with satiated clarity, his eyes now sober.

When dawn's light crept through the curtains, Evelyn woke to a dull ache in her waist. She tried to turn over but was immediately pulled back by a muscular arm.

Sebastian's sleeping face was inches away, his long lashes casting delicate shadows. Unable to resist, she reached out and lightly brushed his eyelashes.

"Mischief." His eyes flew open, capturing her wandering fingers.

He nuzzled against her like a large, affectionate dog, burying his face in the crook of her neck. "Evelyn..."

"Haven't you called my name enough for one night?"

Suddenly, he propped himself up and looked into her eyes with startling intensity. "Marry me."

Evelyn arched a brow. "What if I say no?"

"Then I'll keep asking until you say yes."

She deliberately drew out her next words. "And... what if I fall for someone else?"

The air turned to ice.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. After a long pause, he finally spoke, his voice raw. "Then I'll let you go." He pulled her closer, pressing his face into her hair. "As long as you're happy."

A sudden breeze parted the curtains, and a beam of sunlight fell across their intertwined fingers—illuminating the diamond ring that glittered between them.
###Chapter 419

Evelyn Roland had intended to tease him, but when she caught the fleeting hurt in his eyes, it felt like a needle pricking her heart.

An unexpected ache welled up inside her.

Her fingers tightened around the bedsheet instinctively.

"I agree."

"Hmm?"

"Never mind."

Evelyn arched a brow, deliberately drawing out her words. "What a shame."

"You just said yes!"

Sebastian Valdemar's eyes lit up instantly, his entire being melting into tenderness.

"Say it again, Evelyn."

His voice was so soft it could drip honey, as if coaxing his most precious treasure.

"I said, yes."

When she turned her head, she met his intense gaze.

His deep pupils reflected her current state with perfect clarity—dark hair splayed across white pillows, lips slightly swollen, bare shoulders glowing like pearls in the morning light.

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed.

He suddenly leaned down, pressing a trail of featherlight kisses along her swan-like neck.

"Time to get up?"

"Mhm."

As she sat up, the sheets slipped away, and Evelyn gasped at the sudden chill, scrambling back under the covers.

She wasn't usually prudish, but after last night's relentless vigor, she had to consider the state of her waist.

A low chuckle brushed her ear.

"Mr. Valdemar, don't make me take it back."

Her attempt at sternness was utterly endearing. Sebastian knew it was an act, yet his chest still tightened.

His smile vanished instantly.

"I'll have clothes sent over."

He grabbed his discarded shirt from the floor and disappeared into the bathroom.

Through the frosted glass, Evelyn glimpsed his blurred silhouette before checking her phone—nearly noon.

Her gaze fell on the shredded fabric littering the floor, and she sighed, pressing a hand to her forehead.

That had been her favorite dress.

Premium silk, reduced to rags by his bare hands.

After fresh clothes arrived, they freshened up quickly.

"I'll take you home."

The moment they stepped out of the suite, Sebastian seized her hand.

When their fingers intertwined, he leaned down, his warm breath tickling her ear.

"No need."

Evelyn clung to her last shred of rationality, stopping in the parking lot.

"Let's keep this between us for now."

"A secret relationship?" Sebastian arched a brow.
###Chapter 420

"Wait a little longer." Evelyn Roland leaned against the car door, her fingertips lightly tapping the window. "The timing isn't right yet."

Sebastian Valdemar frowned slightly, a flicker of disappointment in his eyes. "Am I really that embarrassing to be seen with?"

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across his face—highlighting the faint scratch on his cheek. Evelyn couldn't resist reaching out to trace it with her fingers. "If news gets out that the Valdemar heir was poisoned, do you think those people would let me—your obvious weakness—off the hook?"

She paused, lowering her voice. "Not to mention... your father's side..."

"I understand." Sebastian suddenly grinned, catching her wrist in his hand. "As long as I can stand by your side openly, I'll wait however long it takes."

Evelyn arched a brow. This man had just been sulking, and now he looked like a cat who'd gotten the cream.

"Let's go." She pulled her hand free and turned to open the car door.

"Wait." Sebastian suddenly tugged at the hem of her coat. "Text me when you arrive."

Evelyn glanced back and saw the blatant expectation in his eyes. It reminded her of how this wolf had pinned her to the couch last night, kissing her senseless. Her ears burned, and she slammed the door shut with a sharp click.

In the rearview mirror, his tall figure remained rooted in place until the car turned the corner and he vanished from sight.

At the Valdemar Group headquarters, the receptionist was touching up her makeup when the elevator dinged. She glanced over—and nearly drew her lipstick down to her chin.

"G-Good morning, Mr. Valdemar!"

The entire lobby fell silent. Everyone gaped at the man in a pink hoodie—their usually icy, ruthless CEO, who was not only two hours late but also radiating an unmistakable aura of... satisfaction?

"Morning." Sebastian actually nodded in response before striding toward his private elevator, his steps unusually light.

The employees exchanged stunned looks.

"Am I hallucinating? Did the boss just wear... pink?"
"Is that a... mark on his neck?"
"Shh! Do you have a death wish?"

On the 28th floor, Theodore Ashcroft was reviewing meeting materials when the office door opened. "Just leave the documents on the desk," he said without looking up.

"Clear my afternoon schedule."

The familiar deep voice made Theodore jerk his head up. His folder hit the floor with a thud as he took in his boss's noticeably snug hoodie and the faint scratches peeking above the collar. His brain short-circuited.

"Sir, would you... like some coffee?" he managed weakly.

Sebastian glanced at his phone's lock screen—a photo of the two of them together—and smirked. "Double sugar."

Half an hour later, a dazed Theodore floated out of the office, only to be ambushed by curious colleagues.

"Theo, is the boss...?"
"Don't ask." Theodore clutched his chest. "I need a moment."

Meanwhile, Evelyn's phone buzzed.

"I'm here," came the unmistakably cheerful voice on the other end. "How's your side?"

Evelyn surveyed the warehouse full of oak barrels and sighed. "Sebastian, it's work hours."

"But I miss you." His voice dropped, warm and intimate, as if he were standing right behind her. "Last night, when you dug your nails into my back—"

"Shut up!" She hung up abruptly, but the tips of her ears betrayed her, flushing pink.

The winery staff peeked at their usually no-nonsense boss, now glaring at her phone—yet failing to suppress the tiny smile tugging at her lips.
###Chapter 421

Theodore Ashcroft stood outside the CEO's office, his finger hovering in midair, hesitating to knock.

A rare gentle voice drifted through the crack in the door. "Remember to eat on time. Don't overwork yourself."

The sound sent a shiver down Theodore's spine. For a moment, he thought he'd come to the wrong floor.

The person on the other end of the line must have said something, because Sebastian Valdemar chuckled softly. "I miss you too."

Theodore's hand froze in place, caught between retreating and proceeding.

"Come in."

The icy command from inside made him jump.

When he pushed the door open, Sebastian had already reverted to his usual cold demeanor. A cold sweat broke out on Theodore's back, as if the tender exchange he'd overheard had been a hallucination.

"Sir, I—"

"Give me the file."

Sebastian cut him off, his long fingers tapping impatiently on the desk.

Theodore hurriedly handed over the gilded official document, barely daring to breathe. He stole a glance at his boss's expression and caught the faintest trace of a lingering smile at the corner of his lips.

"Autism research project?"

Sebastian paused mid-flip, his gaze deepening.

"Yes. It's a collaboration personally spearheaded by Director Galatea."

Theodore added cautiously, "Should I have someone look into the background?"

"No need."

Sebastian closed the file, fingertips brushing the cover. He remembered the way Evelyn Roland's eyes had reddened when Theodore Valdemar first called her "Mom."

"Reply directly that we agree to cooperate."

The decision came so swiftly that even Theodore was taken aback. But he quickly realized—this had to be about Miss Roland.

"Anything else?"

Sebastian arched a brow when his assistant remained rooted in place.

Theodore gathered his courage. "Sir, about you and Miss Roland..."

"Hm."

That single syllable made the air in the office freeze. Sebastian's warning glare had Theodore clamping his mouth shut instantly.

"I'll go send that email right away!"

Theodore practically fled. As the door clicked shut behind him, he heard the telltale chime of a phone being unlocked.

Out in the hallway, he wiped sweat from his brow. Looks like he'd have to start calling her "Madam" from now on.

Meanwhile, Sebastian was already dialing Olivia Valdemar's number.

"Sis, there's a project I need you on."

Gazing at the sunlight streaming through the window, he pictured Evelyn helping Theodore with his therapy exercises.

"It's for children with autism spectrum disorder."

Olivia's delighted voice came through the line. "An official project? Perfect! I'll add another fifty million in funding."

Sebastian chuckled. "Knew you'd support it."

After hanging up, he opened his photo gallery. The most recent picture showed Evelyn bending to tie Theodore's shoelaces, sunlight gilding them both in gold.

The man's stern features softened imperceptibly.
###Chapter 422

Victor Galatea carefully placed Valdemar Group's response letter in the innermost compartment of his briefcase, his fingers lingering on the document before withdrawing. Standing by his office window, he watched the endless stream of traffic below, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Director, it's time to leave," his secretary reminded him softly.

"Hmm." He acknowledged with a nod, picking up his briefcase and heading out.

The moment he pushed open his front door, a sweet floral fragrance greeted him.

"Dad!" Scarlett Galatea bounded toward him like an excited sparrow, snatching the briefcase from his hand. "How was your day?"

Victor arched an eyebrow, allowing his daughter to eagerly take his coat. She wore a pink dress today, her hair adorned with a pearl clip—clearly dressed up for a reason.

"Honey water." Scarlett presented a glass with both hands, her eyes sparkling.

Victor accepted the cup, steam curling upward. He took slow, deliberate sips, deliberately avoiding her expectant gaze.

"Dad..." Scarlett finally couldn't hold back, inching closer. "About... the project..."

Victor set the glass down, lips quirking. "Couldn't wait any longer?"

Scarlett's face flushed crimson, her fingers twisting together.

"Go on," Victor leaned back on the sofa. "You donated your limited-edition collectibles—the ones you treasured for years—for a man?"

Scarlett's head jerked up, her lips trembling slightly. "You... you knew?"

"Your father isn't senile yet." Victor snorted lightly. "I've seen it since the first time you returned from Mount Pilatus."

Scarlett bit her lower lip before murmuring after a long pause, "Yes. I like Sebastian Valdemar."

The living room fell so quiet the ticking of the wall clock became audible.

"What about him and Evelyn Roland..." Victor chose his words carefully.

"They're nothing!" Scarlett suddenly stood, her voice shaking. "I checked—it's just a business partnership!"

Victor's chest tightened at the sight of his daughter's reddened eyes. He knew this stubborn girl too well—once she set her mind on something, nothing could pull her back.

"Dad..." Scarlett knelt, gripping his hand. "Did the project... succeed?"

Meeting her hopeful gaze, Victor suddenly felt the weight of his briefcase like a leaden anchor. He recalled Sebastian's response letter—the words "subject to further discussion" making his throat constrict.

"Scarlett," he patted her hand gently. "Some things..."

Before he could finish, Scarlett's phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her face instantly draining of color.

Victor followed her line of sight—
A photo of Sebastian Valdemar and Evelyn Roland standing side by side glared back from the display.
###Chapter 423

Victor Galatea observed his daughter's distracted expression with perfect clarity.

The girl was clearly smitten with Sebastian Valdemar.

He sipped his tea, masking his complicated emotions.

"The collaboration is finalized. Valdemar Group just needs to send someone to sign the documents. The lab will be operational soon."

"Let me handle it!"

Scarlett Galatea blurted out eagerly, her eyes sparkling.

Victor felt a pang of sourness watching his daughter like this.

"That Sebastian has poor health. I heard he's hospitalized frequently."

"So he gets treatment. What's the big deal?"

Scarlett's cheeks warmed as she recalled Sebastian carrying her that day.

"Dad, you didn't see how he held me. If not for him, my leg would've been ruined from that fall!"

Victor remained silent.

"Do as you wish. You won't listen until you hit a wall."

He sighed inwardly. Sebastian was indeed an outstanding young man with a clean family background. If this worked out, it would be a good match.

At least there wouldn't be any mother-in-law conflicts.

Victor had already started mentally drafting wedding invitations.

Meanwhile, Sebastian had just finalized the autism research project when he video-called Evelyn Roland.

8:30 PM. Evelyn had just stepped out of the shower.

Water droplets slid down her damp hair, swirling at her collarbone before disappearing beneath her robe.

She grabbed a towel to dry her hair while reaching for a bottled water from the fridge.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

Sebastian's impossibly handsome face filled the video call screen.

"Mr. Valdemar has free time today?"

She propped the phone on the coffee table, continuing to towel her hair. This was his fourth call today.

"Evelyn, I miss you."

Sebastian stared intently at the screen, his gaze burning.

"We literally woke up in the same bed this morning."

He coughed, his ears turning slightly pink.

"Victor Galatea proposed an autism research project. I accepted."

"Scarlett's father?"

Evelynn arched an eyebrow.

"Yes."

"Need my help?"

Her tone was strictly professional.

"No, focus on your work."

Sebastian shook his head. Though she'd successfully treated Theodore's autism, he wouldn't guilt her into helping.

There were too many children in this world needing assistance.
###Chapter 424

Sebastian's knuckles turned white as he gripped his phone.

He didn't want Evelyn dragged into this mess.

"Does Mr. Valdemar actually care about me now?"

A lazy voice purred through the receiver, like a kitten's paw brushing against his eardrum.

His Adam's apple bobbed.

The pounding of his own heartbeat roared in his ears.

"I can feel it."

Evelyn watched the man's jawline tighten abruptly on the video call, a sly glint flashing in her eyes.

She deliberately licked her lips.

The action made Sebastian grab his water glass and take a large gulp.

"Miss Roland has rather low standards."

His deep voice carried a barely perceptible roughness.

"Not at all!"

Just as Evelyn was about to continue, her phone buzzed.

The message from Alice made her gaze turn icy.

"What's wrong?"

Sebastian instantly detected the shift in her mood.

"Nothing."

She quickly schooled her expression, though her fingers unconsciously traced the edge of her phone.

"Evelyn, we're together now."

His voice softened. "You can tell me anything."

"Really, it's nothing."

When she looked up again, her smile was radiant.

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before letting it go.

"Go to sleep. And dry your hair properly."

His gaze lingered on her damp strands.

"Got it."

Her obedient nod made his breath catch.

"Goodnight. Sweet dreams."

The moment the call ended, Evelyn immediately opened WhatsApp.

Alice's lengthy message was riddled with typos, yet it made her eyes burn.

Nina had started school. The temple repairs were done. Even the leaky roof had been fixed.

She stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, moonlight tracing her silhouette in silver.

The next morning.

Scarlett strode into Valdemar Group's headquarters in stilettos.

The tulips in her arms still glistened with morning dew.

"I'm Scarlett Galatea."

She tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "Here on behalf of Commissioner Galatea to discuss cooperation."

The receptionist blinked at her dazzling smile.

"One moment, please. I'll notify the executive office immediately."
###Chapter 425

Zachary Merouin stood before the towering glass facade of the Valdemar Group headquarters, adjusting his tie with meticulous precision.

"Good morning, Mr. Merouin," the receptionist greeted with a polite smile.

He gave a curt nod, but his steps faltered as a stranger caught his eye.

A woman.

Clutching an extravagant bouquet of roses.

His gaze sharpened. "Who's that?" he muttered to the security guard beside him.

The guard shook his head. "First time seeing her."

Zachary's stomach twisted.

Was she here for Sebastian Valdemar?

He edged closer, straining to eavesdrop.

"My name is Scarlett Galatea. I have an appointment with Mr. Valdemar," the woman said, her voice honeyed.

The receptionist eyed her skeptically. "One moment, please."

Scarlett waited with poised elegance, her lips curved in a practiced smile.

Five minutes later, the elevator doors slid open.

"Ms. Galatea, this way."

Zachary whipped out his phone and fired off a text: "Woman with flowers heading up. Explain."

Instantly, he regretted it.

Too obvious.

Grumbling, he stormed off to find a café.

Meanwhile, in the executive conference room...

Scarlett's smile faltered as she entered.

The room wasn't empty.

"Mr. Valdemar." She recovered swiftly, placing the roses on an empty chair.

Sebastian barely glanced up. "Sit."

For thirty minutes, she maintained flawless professionalism.

Only when the others left did she follow him into his office, bouquet in hand.

"A gift for you." She extended the flowers.

"Unnecessary."

"Consider it thanks for your help last time." She set them on the coffee table, undeterred.

Sebastian finally met her gaze. "Contact Theodore Ashcroft for project details."

She rose gracefully. "Perhaps we could exchange contacts?"

After securing his number, she left with a satisfied gleam in her eyes.

Ten minutes later, the office door burst open.

"Sebastian Valdemar!" Zachary charged in like a bull. "Who was that woman?"

Sebastian slowly closed his file. "Stalking me now?"

"I was worried!" Zachary plopped onto the sofa—directly onto the roses.

He leapt up as if burned, gaping at the crushed blooms. "Don't tell me these are—"

Sebastian's glacial stare silenced him.

The room plunged into deafening silence.
###Chapter 426

Sebastian's slender fingers turned a page of the document. The office was so quiet that the rustling of paper echoed distinctly. He suddenly looked up, his dark eyes unfathomable. "Something wrong?"

Zachary swallowed hard. Though Sebastian's expression remained neutral, an icy dread crept down his spine.

The rhythmic clatter of keyboard strokes ceased abruptly. Sebastian closed the folder, his metal cufflinks glinting coldly under the light. "Explain what happened that day."

"I—I was just too anxious..." Zachary's voice trailed off. "The dosage was indeed—"

"Half a packet." Sebastian cut him off, the corner of his mouth curling into a dangerous smirk. "Eight PM. The boxing ring."

Zachary shot to his feet. "Sebastian! My hand slipped that day—"

"Warm-up at seven." Sebastian had already reopened his laptop, the blue glow casting sharp shadows across his chiseled profile. "Late arrival means extra rounds."

Zachary opened his mouth but ultimately slumped back into his chair. Staring blankly at the carpet's intricate pattern, he could already picture his battered body sprawled across the boxing mat.

At exactly eight o'clock, Zachary was thrown onto the mat for the third time. Gasping for air, sweat stung his eyes.

"Get up." Sebastian removed his gloves, revealing bruised knuckles. "Only three rounds in."

Zachary groaned as he rolled onto his side. "Murder is illegal, Sebastian!"

Sebastian twisted open a water bottle, droplets tracing his jawline. "If Evelyn ever finds out about that drink—"

"I was wrong! I swear!" Zachary scrambled upright like a startled fish. "My lips are sealed!"

Beyond the glass walls, the city glittered. Sebastian studied his reflection in the floor-to-ceiling window, suddenly recalling the faint redness at the corners of Evelyn's eyes in the dimly lit private room that night.

Three months later, the laboratory's automatic glass doors slid open. Evelyn strode down the corridor in stiletto heels, the hem of her white coat fluttering behind her.

"The ventilation system needs modification." Her fingertip tapped a specific spot on the blueprint. "Install additional filtration here."

Sebastian stood half a step behind her, his gaze lingering on the tiny whirl at the crown of her head. "I've reviewed the equipment list."

"Any concerns, Mr. Valdemar?" Evelyn turned abruptly, nearly brushing her nose against his tie clip.

Bianca entered carrying coffee, only to freeze at the sight of their nearly touching silhouettes. She deliberately thunked the cup onto the table. "Master! Your latte!"

"Thank you." Evelyn accepted the coffee and casually pushed Sebastian's iced Americano toward him. "Try it. Bianca's skills have improved."

Bianca's eyes widened. She'd only brewed one cup!

Under the warm glow of the chandelier during dinner, Bianca glared as the pair wordlessly exchanged plates. She viciously stabbed a shrimp dumpling in her bowl.

"Bianca." Evelyn suddenly placed a sweet-and-sour spare rib on her plate. "Eat more."

Bianca instantly brightened, shooting Sebastian a triumphant look. The man merely dabbed his mouth with a napkin, amusement flickering in his eyes.

Outside, early spring cherry blossoms drifted past the balcony.
###Chapter 427

The glass door of the laboratory slid open without a sound.

When Scarlett Galatea stepped into the Valdemar Group lobby for the third time, the receptionist greeted her with familiarity.

"Miss Galatea, this way, please."

The elevator ascended directly to the twelfth floor.

The metal door of the laboratory slowly parted before her.

"This is our core R&D zone," the staff member gestured toward the precision instruments behind the transparent glass partition on the left. "And that area is for administrative offices."

White-coated researchers remained engrossed in their work, indifferent to the visitor's arrival.

Scarlett's gaze swept across every corner before settling on the empty director's office.

After the tour, she disappeared alone for an hour.

When she returned, four waiters carrying exquisite food boxes followed behind her.

"Pardon the interruption," she murmured softly, directing the servers to arrange an array of desserts on the lounge's long table.

The lab director adjusted his glasses, staring at the spread of madeleines and pour-over coffee, momentarily speechless.

"Consider it a greeting gift." Scarlett tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "Looking forward to our future collaboration."

For the next forty-eight hours, Scarlett became a constant presence in the laboratory.

Daily afternoon tea with no repeated menu. Thoughtfully provided hand creams. Even the chair cushions were replaced with ergonomic designs.

But the person she sought never appeared.

Until the third morning.

The elevator doors opened.

Scarlett's breath hitched.

"Seb—"

The man's sharp profile turned toward her. She quickly corrected herself. "Good morning, Mr. Valdemar."

Sebastian Valdemar gave a slight nod. "Miss Galatea."

"Have you been...?" She twisted her fingers. "Is the project progressing well?"

"Proceeding as planned." His gaze flickered to the faint blush on her earlobes. "No need for concern."

"I was worried you might be overworking." She lifted her face, eyes shimmering.

"Your concern is appreciated."

The entire morning, Scarlett shadowed Sebastian like a silent specter.

On the glass walls of the laboratory, their reflections moved in tandem—one leading, the other following.

The moment the elevator swallowed the man's figure, whispers erupted through the lab.

"Did you see? Miss Galatea couldn't take her eyes off Mr. Valdemar."

"This isn't project supervision. It's a courtship."

The next day, when Scarlett arrived with a car full of gifts, the entire laboratory buzzed.

"Rumor says the Galatea heiress has been infatuated with Mr. Valdemar since high school."

"Honestly, it's a perfect match—equal social standing."

"If Mr. Valdemar marries Miss Galatea, our lab benefits might double."

Outside the glass doors, Scarlett smoothed the wrinkles from her skirt.

The corners of her lips curved into a smile of absolute certainty.
###Chapter 428

The click of high heels echoed through the laboratory corridor as Scarlett Galatea walked with practiced grace.

"Miss Galatea looks stunning today!"

"I heard she pulled all-nighters for this project."

A group of female employees huddled together, whispering while stealing glances at Scarlett.

A gentle smile played on her lips as she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

"Good morning, everyone."

Her voice was soft, like a spring breeze skimming across a lake.

"Good morning, Mrs. Valdemar!"

Someone called out first, and soon the entire lab erupted in greetings.

Scarlett's cheeks flushed pink as she feigned embarrassment. "Don't say that."

But inside, her heart swelled with sweetness.

Her calculated efforts had paid off. Every day, she dressed meticulously, timing her appearances in the corridors Sebastian Valdemar frequented. Though the man remained ice-cold, the entire company now acknowledged her unofficial status.

"Miss Galatea and Mr. Valdemar are a match made in heaven."

"Absolutely. He's never had another woman by his side."

Scarlett's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as she absorbed their flattery.

Just then, the glass doors slid open.

"Good morning, Mrs. Valdemar!"

The receptionist's chirpy voice cut through the quiet space like a needle.

Evelyn Roland froze mid-step.

Her sharp gaze zeroed in on the source.

A cluster of employees fawned over a woman in a lab coat. The woman's delicate profile and carefully curated elegance reeked of affectation.

"Please, don't call me that." Scarlett pretended to shy away. "Mr. Valdemar wouldn't like it."

"Nonsense! You're the one he personally invited to lead this project."

"We're all waiting for wedding invitations!"

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile as she pulled out her phone and hit record.

The screen lit up with Sebastian's message:
"At the office yet?"

"Just arrived," she typed swiftly. "Watching your fiancée's performance."

After sending it, she leaned against the wall, arms crossed, observing the farce with icy detachment.

Scarlett was in her element now. "Once the project wraps up, dinner's on me."

"Make sure Mr. Valdemar foots the bill!"

"When will you introduce him to us, Miss Galatea?"

Scarlett opened her mouth to respond when she spotted the figure by the doorway. Her face drained of color.

"M-Miss Roland?"

The lab plunged into silence.

The employees turned to see Evelyn, their expressions shifting like a kaleidoscope of horror.

Evelyn pocketed her phone with deliberate slowness.

"Don't stop on my account," she purred. "I'm enjoying the show."
###Chapter 429

"Miss... Miss Roland..."

A girl in the crowd stammered, her voice trembling. She had once fawned over Evelyn Roland, but now, under the weight of those icy eyes, she wished she could vanish on the spot.

"Yes?"

Evelyn didn't even glance up, her fingers gliding effortlessly across her phone screen.

Scarlett Galatea clenched her coffee cup, her knuckles turning white. She bit her lower lip, her eyes glistening with unshed tears like a frightened rabbit.

"Are you here to see Mr. Valdemar?" Scarlett forced a smile.

Only then did Evelyn lift her gaze, her obsidian eyes sweeping over her. "What else?"

The lab fell into a suffocating silence.

The other girls exchanged uneasy glances, wanting to defend Scarlett but too intimidated to speak. They could only silently resent Evelyn's arrogance.

Scarlett's tears welled up. "Have I... done something to offend you?"

"No." Evelyn pocketed her phone with disinterest. "I just don't drink green tea."

Scarlett's face stiffened.

At that moment, steady footsteps echoed from the end of the hallway.

"Miss Roland."

Sebastian Valdemar's voice cut through the tension like a clear stream.

He strode forward, his long legs encased in tailored suit pants moving swiftly. The usual sternness in his features softened the moment his eyes landed on Evelyn, his lips curving into a faint, almost imperceptible smile.

Scarlett's eyes brightened, and she instinctively took half a step forward.

But Sebastian's gaze swept right past her, settling on Evelyn.

"Waiting long?" His voice was uncharacteristically gentle.

Evelyn shook her head lightly, a subtle warmth flickering in her eyes. "Just got here."

The moment their eyes met, electricity crackled in the air. The surrounding noise faded into the background, leaving only the two of them in their own world.

Scarlett dug her nails into her palms.

She couldn't believe what she was seeing—since when did Sebastian Valdemar look at anyone like that? The ruthless CEO who dominated the business world now gazed at Evelyn with the tenderness of a lovestruck boy.

"Mr. Valdemar..." Scarlett couldn't help but call out.

Sebastian finally acknowledged her with a polite nod. "Miss Galatea."

His tone instantly reverted to its usual detached formality.

Scarlett's heart plummeted. She watched as Sebastian turned back to Evelyn, his profile softening again, and her nails bit deeper into her skin.

This couldn't be happening.

How could Sebastian possibly be interested in someone as arrogant as Evelyn Roland? He was supposed to prefer gentle, considerate women!

"Let's go." Sebastian naturally took Evelyn's bag. "The meeting is about to start."

Evelyn gave a slight nod, and the two walked away side by side, their effortless默契 a painful sight.

Scarlett stood frozen, her smile completely shattered.
###Chapter 430

The air in the laboratory froze instantly.

Sebastian Valdemar's expression darkened, his gaze sharp as a blade sweeping across everyone present. The female researchers who had been praising Scarlett Galatea moments ago turned pale, their test tubes nearly slipping from trembling fingers.

"T-the CEO's wife?" one girl stammered, her eyes darting between Scarlett and Sebastian.

"Theodore!" Sebastian's voice was glacial.

"Sir!" Theodore Ashcroft stepped forward immediately.

"Issue a company-wide notice." Sebastian enunciated each word. "Anyone spreading rumors will be terminated on the spot."

Scarlett kept her head lowered, fingers twisting together. She took a deep breath before lifting her face with a practiced smile. "Mr. Valdemar, this is entirely my fault for causing misunderstandings."

Sebastian gave a slight nod. "No need for self-reproach, Miss Galatea. I'll tighten lab management. You needn't come here daily anymore."

The words struck like a slap. Scarlett maintained her smile while her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Evelyn Roland observed everything from the sidelines, quietly admiring the acting skills of this Galatea heiress.

"Miss Roland, let me show you the lab." Sebastian's tone noticeably softened when addressing Evelyn.

Theodore followed them with a frown. He distinctly remembered Sebastian claiming to have won Evelyn over—why did they still interact so formally?

Researchers bustled about the lab as Sebastian personally explained various experiments to Evelyn, occasionally soliciting her opinions. Scarlett stood in a corner watching them, her chest heaving.

"This data is flawed." Evelyn suddenly stopped before an instrument, pointing at the graph on its screen.

Sebastian leaned in to examine it, their proximity allowing them to sense each other's breath. Scarlett bit her lower lip until she tasted blood.

After the tour, Evelyn seemed pensive. Scarlett glared at her flawless profile, resentment churning inside. What right did some jewelry designer have to critique biological research?

"Notice anything, Miss Roland?" Sebastian inquired.

"Further observation is needed." Evelyn shook her head slightly, though her gaze remained razor-sharp.

Scarlett sneered inwardly. What an act! She wouldn't let this woman ruin her plans.
###Chapter 431

Sebastian Valdemar's slender fingers swiped across his phone screen, his brow slightly furrowed.

"I'll stay with you." He pocketed his phone, his gaze settling on Evelyn Roland.

"Unnecessary." Evelyn caught his frequent glances at the device. "Theodore is looking for you."

Scarlett Galatea stepped forward with a gentle smile. "Don't worry, Mr. Valdemar. I'll accompany Miss Roland on the tour."

She deliberately emphasized the words "designated liaison."

"No need for the trouble." Evelyn strode straight toward the lab. "I'll manage on my own."

Sebastian gave her a lingering look before leaving. "Call me anytime."

Scarlett quickened her pace to catch up, her tone overly familiar. "Are you interested in pharmaceutical research, Miss Roland?"

"Not particularly." Evelyn didn't bother turning around.

Scarlett's smile froze.

Whispers drifted from a corner. "Who does she think she is—"

The voice cut off abruptly.

Evelyn's icy glare silenced the female employee instantly.

"This way, please." Scarlett forced a smile as she led the way.

Inside the lab, a researcher poured green reagent into a blue solution.

The expected reaction never occurred.

"Strange..." the researcher muttered under his breath.

Evelyn's eyes flicked to the data screen, her pupils contracting slightly.

"Try again." The researcher's hands trembled as he repeated the procedure.

The solution remained unchanged.

Evelyn suddenly stepped forward.

"Miss Roland!" Scarlett gasped.

The researcher whirled around. "Unauthorized personnel are not allowed—"

"The ratio is wrong." Evelyn's voice was frosty.
###Chapter 432

Evelyn Roland slid her hands into her trench coat pockets, her gaze sweeping indifferently across the lab.

"What did you say?"

The two researchers frowned in unison, displeasure written across their faces.

"Move aside."

Evelyn took a step forward, but they immediately blocked the workstation. This was a restricted area—and to make matters worse, this outsider was a woman.

Her words had clearly questioned their expertise.

"What do you know about lab procedures?" one of them snapped, his expression darkening. "Get out before you waste our time."

The other pointed toward the exit. "Leave now, or we'll call security."

When they turned to Scarlett Galatea, their tone instantly shifted to deference. "Miss Galatea, the experiment requires a quiet environment. Please excuse us."

Their change in demeanor was almost theatrical.

Scarlett hid her satisfaction behind a mask of concern. "Miss Roland, perhaps we should wait outside."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Fine."

In the hallway, Scarlett adopted a patronizing tone. "They’re just like that. Don’t take it personally."

"Doesn’t matter." Evelyn's eyes darkened.

Scarlett hadn’t expected such indifference and faltered.

"Would you like to have lunch together?"

"No need." Evelyn’s refusal was crisp.

Scarlett’s smile stiffened.

"I’ll eat at the employee cafeteria," Evelyn added.

Scarlett forced a laugh. "Perfect. I’ve been meaning to try Valdemar Group’s food."

Their entrance into the cafeteria caused a stir.

Scarlett cut her steak with exaggerated grace. "Congratulations on making the Fortune Ranking."

"Thanks." Evelyn didn’t look up.

The silence thickened.

"I’m done." Evelyn stood. "Enjoy your meal, Miss Galatea."

As she left, she spotted Daniel and David Murphy in heated discussion with their colleagues.
###Chapter 433

The glass door of the laboratory slid open silently.

Evelyn Roland stood at the entrance, scanning the room before striding purposefully toward the workbench.

The data screen still glowed faintly. Her fingers traced across its surface, then suddenly paused with a frown. She grabbed a pen and scribbled several formulas into the lab notebook before turning to adjust the reagents on the test tube rack.

"Done."

Unnoticed in the shadows, Scarlett Galatea held up her phone, recording every movement with trembling fingers.

Click.

A distant clatter of equipment made Scarlett flinch. She hastily locked her screen and slipped out along the wall, pressing herself flat against the corridor outside.

Gasping for breath, she leaned against the hallway corner, her chest heaving. Only when she confirmed no one had followed did she allow herself to exhale.

"Miss Galatea?"

Two hulking figures loomed over her. Daniel and David Murphy tilted their heads in unison, confusion written across their faces.

"N-nothing's wrong..."

The researchers exchanged glances at her pale face and evasive manner. Shrugging, they turned to leave.

"Wait!"

Scarlett's sudden call stopped them.

The brothers turned back, puzzled.

"The lab..." Scarlett bit her lip, her phone burning against her palm. "There's something..."

"What is it?" David stomped impatiently. "We're on a tight schedule!"

Scarlett took a deep breath. "I'm not sure you can handle this."

Daniel frowned. "Spit it out."

"Promise you won't tell anyone." Scarlett lowered her voice. "This is critical."

The brothers thumped their chests in assurance.

Only then did Scarlett unlock her phone. The video showed Evelyn flipping through experimental data and altering formula ratios.

"That's impossible!" Daniel snatched the phone.

David stared at the screen, his face draining of color. "Our core data..."

They charged back into the lab. The data board now bore unfamiliar handwriting, and the reagent bottles had been rearranged.

"Report this to Mr. Valdemar immediately."

Ten minutes later, the lab blazed with light.

Sebastian Valdemar appeared in the doorway, with Evelyn following calmly behind him.
###Chapter 434

The laboratory fell into abrupt silence as all eyes locked onto the slender figure in the doorway.

"Evelyn Roland!" Daniel Murphy growled through clenched teeth, storming forward. "You've got some nerve showing up here!"

David Murphy followed close behind, knuckles cracking. "You destroyed all our experimental data!"

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, stifling a lazy yawn. "Proof?"

"The security footage caught you tampering with our computers!" Daniel roared.

Her lips curved into a smile, a glint of steel flashing in her eyes. "Guilty as charged."

Gasps rippled through the lab.

Sebastian Valdemar emerged from the crowd, his icy demeanor radiating authority. "Verify her data first."

"Mr. Valdemar!" Daniel protested.

"Now." Sebastian's tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn winked at him, a ghost of amusement playing on her lips.

On the lab bench, liquids in test tubes began reacting under the precision instruments.

"This can't be..." David stared at the monitor, voice trembling.

Daniel lunged for the microscope. "It worked? It actually worked!"

Researchers exchanged stunned glances. Someone murmured, "She solved our two-day problem in ten minutes..."

"Enough!" Daniel suddenly turned and bowed deeply to Evelyn. "Miss Roland, we were blind fools."

David followed with a ninety-degree bow. "Please forgive our disrespect."

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Just happened to be passing by." Her lab coat swirled in a sharp arc as she turned.

In the corner, Scarlett Galatea dug her nails into her palms. Her burning gaze followed Evelyn's retreating figure, resentment churning in her eyes.

Daniel and David straightened, their expressions complicated as they glanced at Scarlett. The lab's atmosphere grew palpably tense.

"Assistant Galatea," Daniel asked gravely, "why were you so certain the data was destroyed?"

Scarlett's face drained of color.
###Chapter 435

Scarlett's fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving crescent-shaped marks. Her cheeks burned crimson, the tips of her ears flushed scarlet.

Once again, Evelyn had outmaneuvered her.

This seemingly gentle woman was far more formidable than she'd anticipated.

"Miss Roland's technique was flawless!"

"Beautiful and brilliant—she's the perfect goddess!"

"I'm officially her fan from today!"

In the corner of the lab, researchers exchanged knowing glances. They understood better than anyone that Evelyn had only revealed the tip of the iceberg.

Why else would top-tier talents like them willingly serve her?

"Back to work, everyone!"

"Daniel, David—let me see your notes!"

A bespectacled researcher eagerly dragged the twin brothers away. The team dispersed, leaving Scarlett standing alone, her chest heaving.

——

In the CEO's office.

Sebastian's slender fingers curled around a glass as he placed warm water before Evelyn. "You shouldn't have had to endure that."

Evelyn took a sip, lashes lowering. "It was nothing."

The man studied her expression, confirming her indifference before pouring himself water and sitting.

"By the way," he began casually, "the talents you recommended are impressive. Though..."

"Though?" She lifted her gaze.

"They're from Aether Research Lab, aren't they?"

Sebastian's piercing stare held undisguised probing.

Evelyn traced the rim of her glass, lips curving. "And?"

"Why would they involve themselves in such a minor project?"

Aether's researchers were notoriously selective, never working for outsiders. Yet Evelyn had produced three effortlessly.

"Perhaps..." Her eyes glinted with amusement, "they were charmed by my charisma?"

"Plausible." His low chuckle vibrated through the room. "But I suspect another truth—they obey you because you're Aether's shadow mastermind."

After meticulous deduction, this was the only logical conclusion.

Evelyn set down her glass, obsidian eyes flickering. "Sharp as ever, Sebastian."

"Evelyn," he leaned forward, "how many more secrets are you hiding?"

She was an enigma, endlessly surprising him.

Her crimson lips tilted. "Why not... discover them yourself?"

Sebastian's throat moved with a silent laugh.

Of course.

This answer was quintessentially Evelyn.

He tactfully changed the subject.
###Chapter 436

The laboratory's glass walls reflected a cold glow. Evelyn Roland's fingers trembled slightly as she handed the latest data report to Sebastian Valdemar.

"Phase one results are 12% above projections." Her voice held suppressed excitement.

Sebastian paused mid-page flip. His pen hovered over the project name field before etching three bold characters—Starlight Initiative.

At precisely 3:00 PM, Valdemar Group's official blog updated without warning.

Against a pure black backdrop, silver star trails swirled into the hashtag #StarlightInitiative. The caption read simply: "We reach for the stars."

Financial reporter Lina Yue choked on her coffee when her phone erupted with notifications. The cup clattered onto the table. "Valdemar's blog...alive?" Her shaking fingers opened the post to discover shares multiplying by thousands per second.

Medical forums exploded.
[Isn't this last year's Nobel laureate's theory?]
[Valdemar actually obtained experimental data!]

Entertainment sections reeled.
[The reclusive Sebastian Valdemar?]
[Check the stock price!]

Commissioner Victor Galatea frowned when the entryway sensor light failed to activate. His fingers brushed dampness instead of the light switch. "Scarlett?" The answering sob came from the couch.

Light flooded the room. Scarlett Galatea curled among throw pillows like a wounded cub, her swollen eyes squinting. She lunged forward, gripping her father's silk tie as dark stains bloomed across the fabric.

"That bastard Sebastian!" Victor whirled toward the door, but his daughter's nails dug into his wrist.

"Not him..." Scarlett choked out, thrusting her phone at him. The screen displayed Valdemar Group's blog. "My press conference...he'd rather post this than..."

Victor's gaze caught on the unhealed needle marks above her collarbone. Understanding dawned. He knelt, wiping smeared mascara with his uniform sleeve. "Foolish girl. Did you think a publicity stunt would force him out?"

"Those lab samples came from my blood!" Her scream fractured on the last word. She hurled a pillow at the television broadcasting Valdemar Group's stock surge.

Victor gripped his daughter's shaking shoulders, noticing the peeling edge of her scent suppressant patch. Alpha pheromones leaked through the fissures in her glands, mingling with salt tears to weave an invisible net in the air.
The night deepened, the top floor of the Valdemar Tower still ablaze with lights.

"President, here's tomorrow's schedule."

The assistant handed over the file just as Sebastian Valdemar removed his gold-rimmed glasses. His gaze skimmed the densely packed itinerary before his pen slashed through a few lines. "Keep the morning clear."

By the time he left the office, it was already nine at night. A sharp pang shot through his stomach as he leaned back in the driver's seat, eyes closed. Neon lights outside the window cast a lonely silhouette against his sharply defined profile.

His black suit jacket lay carelessly tossed on the passenger seat, shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he started the engine.

The doorbell rang for a long time before it was answered.

Evelyn Roland stood in the foyer, a robe draped over her shoulders, water still dripping from her hair. She arched a brow at the unexpected visitor. "To what do I owe the honor, Mr. Valdemar?"

"I wanted to see you."

Three simple words, delivered with crisp efficiency. The corner of Evelyn's lips twitched upward involuntarily. 
###Chapter 437

For a man so inexperienced in romance, he had a way of making even the simplest phrases sound effortlessly smooth.

She stepped aside to let him pass, the beauty mark at the corner of her eye catching the light.

A pair of brand-new navy-blue slippers sat by the entrance. Sebastian's gaze lingered on them for two seconds before her voice cut in with a playful threat. "Walk barefoot if you don't like them."

As he bent to change shoes, a flicker of amusement flashed in his eyes.

"Wait here."

Evelyn disappeared into the kitchen. When the rich aroma of food wafted out, Sebastian instinctively pressed a hand to his stomach.

She emerged with a clay pot, a floral apron tied around her waist, and crooked a finger at him. "Come here."

A steaming bowl of chicken soup waited on the table. Evelyn poured herself a glass of lemon water and tapped the rim of the bowl. "Warm your stomach first."

Sebastian didn't touch the spoon. Instead, he studied her for a long moment. "You noticed?"

"You're pale as a ghost." She propped her chin on one hand, mischief glinting in her eyes. "If you keel over young, I'll just find someone younger and stronger."

Before she could finish, she was yanked into his arms. His teeth grazed her earlobe as he murmured, "I can call you big sister too." The warmth of his breath sent a flush creeping up her neck.

She nearly knocked over her water glass pulling away, shooting him a glare. "Eat!"

The clink of the spoon against porcelain filled the quiet space. Then his thumb brushed the corner of her mouth. "Taste test." The next second, his lips were on hers.

Evelyn froze.

The kiss carried the savory richness of the soup. A sudden laugh escaped her, her eyes shimmering with unspoken allure.

They fell into an easy rhythm—her tapping away at her tablet, him eating in silence. Only the occasional clink of cutlery broke the stillness.

At the sink, water soaked through Sebastian's white shirt, the fabric clinging to the defined muscles of his back. Under the light, his lashes cast delicate shadows across his pale face, turning him into a sculpture carved from jade.

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, admiring the view. Droplets slid down the prominent bones of his wrists, splashing against the tiles in tiny bursts.
###Chapter 438

Evelyn Roland lounged lazily on the sofa, her tablet carelessly discarded beside her. She propped her chin on one hand, her gaze boldly tracing the figure bustling in the kitchen.

Sebastian Valdemar wiped water droplets from his slender fingers and leaned against the doorframe. "Are you free tomorrow afternoon?"

"Hmm?" She arched a brow. "Is this an invitation for a date, Mr. Valdemar?"

"Visiting the special school to see the children," he said, his voice low. "I'd like you to come with me."

Her heart skipped a beat.

"Sure," she replied without hesitation. "Just the two of us?"

A ripple of emotion flickered in Sebastian's eyes. "Yes. No one else."

The chessboard lay spread across the coffee table, black and white pieces interlocking as time slipped by unnoticed. When the clock struck eleven, Sebastian rose to leave but lingered at the door, reluctant to let go.

"Planning to stay the night, Mr. Valdemar?" she teased.

"The thought did cross my mind," he admitted frankly.

"Dream on." She laughed, pushing him out the door.

In the darkness, Sebastian sat in his car for a long while, waiting until the lights in her apartment went out before finally driving away.

The next morning, his car was already parked outside her house.

"Eager, aren't we?" She glanced at her watch. "Did you even sleep last night?"

"How about I move in?" He leaned against the doorframe, a knowing smile playing on his lips.

"Not a chance." She had no intention of facing the wrath of her two brothers.

At the mall, they carefully selected gifts for the children. Toys, stationery, and clothes filled the trunk, while snacks overflowed onto the back seat.

The iron gates of Sunshine Special School creaked open as the headmaster and teachers welcomed them warmly. From the end of the corridor came the halting notes of a piano, abruptly silenced as they approached.

Inside the classroom, a dozen children reacted to the strangers in their own ways. Some trembled in corners, others sat vacantly with hollow eyes that shattered the heart.

Sebastian's fingertips turned ice-cold.

Evelyn seized his hand, feeling the tremor in his palm.

"Thinking of Theodore?" she whispered.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he nodded. Their fingers intertwined tightly in the unnoticed corner, as if sharing the weight of each other's pain.

Suddenly, a little girl with pigtails dashed forward and clung desperately to Evelyn's leg. Her wide, innocent eyes brimmed with heartbreaking fear.
###Chapter 439

"Don't be scared, sweethearts. These kind people are here to play with you."

The teachers soothed the frightened children with practiced ease, their expressions calm and composed.

Evelyn Roland and Sebastian Valdemar exchanged glances, both seeing the gravity of the situation reflected in each other's eyes.

The scene before them was even more challenging than they'd anticipated.

"My deepest apologies. The children tend to get anxious around strangers," the director said hurriedly, her face etched with regret.

"It's alright," Evelyn replied softly. "What would you like us to do?"

"Please give us a moment."

After brief discussion, the director decided to move the activity to the main hall.

Inside the spacious auditorium, a dozen children sat quietly on floor mats. Teachers distributed snacks and toys. Two little girls with braids suddenly threw themselves into Evelyn's arms, leaving smudged handprints on her pristine white blouse.

Evelyn didn't even flinch.

When Sebastian attempted to approach, the children recoiled like startled fawns.

"Go away!"

A sturdy boy with round cheeks lunged forward and shoved Sebastian hard. The man stumbled backward onto the mats, his elbow scraping against the edge and leaving a bloody gash.

"Xiao Miaomiao!" a teacher gasped.

The culprit had already retreated behind the teacher, trembling violently.

"It's nothing," Sebastian said, pushing himself upright with a pale smile.

Evelyn swiftly retrieved the first aid kit and guided him to sit. "Let me bandage this first."

Her fingers moved gently as she disinfected the wound. Sebastian watched her with quiet amusement.

"Does it hurt?"

"Not when you're here."

From the corner, Xiao Miaomiao suddenly screamed, clutching his head. "Pretty people are bad! You're all bad!"

Teachers quickly ushered the distressed child away.

The remaining children grew increasingly restless.

By the time all the children were calmed, Evelyn was exhausted. Her phone screen had shattered into a spiderweb pattern, and her arms bore several scratches.

She exhaled heavily.
###Chapter 440

Evelyn Roland leaned against the wall, her eyes dimming slightly. Sebastian Valdemar gently squeezed her fingertips with his uninjured hand, but she only shook her head.

Though she had studied autism spectrum disorder extensively, seeing it firsthand weighed heavily on her heart. The children's conditions were far more complex than any literature had described.

Theodore Valdemar's case was already considered relatively optimistic.

But Evelyn wouldn't give up. Even if the chance was one in a million, she would try.

The headmaster stood awkwardly nearby, his wrinkles bunching up as he explained.

Evelyn's gaze, however, settled on a quiet little girl in the corner. The child had eyes so clear they seemed bottomless, her docility heartbreaking.

"That's Ruby. The most well-behaved, yet also the most worrying," the headmaster followed her line of sight.

"Can you tell me about her?"

From his account, they learned Ruby's uniqueness. This child had been different since birth—only crying once upon delivery before becoming like a delicate porcelain doll.

She never smiled. Never fussed. Her parents had tried everything to no avail. After nearly a year at the facility, there had been no improvement. The couple visited less and less.

"Such a pitiful child," the headmaster wiped his tears.

Evelyn crouched down and called softly, "Ruby?"

The little girl merely shifted her gaze slightly, giving no other reaction. As the headmaster said, her condition surpassed typical autism spectrum disorder.

An invisible hand seemed to clench Evelyn's heart as she fought back sorrow. Patiently, she called Ruby's name repeatedly, her fingertips brushing the girl's cheek.

"Ruby, should I tell you a story?"

Several teachers nearby had reddened eyes.

Cradling the girl, Evelyn began narrating a fairy tale in hushed tones. Sebastian sat nearby, watching the scene with gentle eyes.

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a faint golden glow over Evelyn's loose strands of hair. At this moment, she was unbelievably tender—a stark contrast to her usual clever, lively self.

When the first story ended, Ruby remained unresponsive. Undeterred, Evelyn turned to the next page.

"Wah..."

Midway through the second tale, the little girl in her arms suddenly let out a sob.

The entire hall fell silent.

"Wah... wah..."

The crying grew louder, piercingly clear in the quiet space.

Evelyn's eyes brightened, hope surging in her chest. Any reaction meant there was still a chance for healing. The true tragedy was a completely closed-off heart.
###Chapter 441

Ruby's eyes were red like a rabbit's, tears brimming but stubbornly refusing to fall.

"Let it out if you need to cry."

Evelyn knelt on the floor, pulling the little girl into her arms, her fingers gently smoothing the child's tangled hair.

"I'm here."

The faint scent of gardenias enveloped Ruby. Her vacant gaze slowly focused, landing on Evelyn's gentle face.

"Ruby?"

The girl suddenly burst into loud sobs, clinging to Evelyn's neck as if pouring out years of pent-up sorrow.

The activity room fell silent. Everyone held their breath.

Ruby hiccuped between cries, then tentatively reached out to touch Evelyn's cheek.

She jerked her hand back as if burned.

After several hesitant attempts, she finally offered a timid smile—only to dissolve into fresh tears.

"Thank heavens!" The director wiped her eyes, moved. "She's finally responding."

"Miss Roland is amazing. Just a few words and Ruby spoke."

"I heard she used to be a psychiatrist?"

Scarlett lurked at the back of the crowd, nails digging into her palms.

She never imagined Evelyn would break through Ruby's shell so effortlessly.

"Shh, no more tears."

Evelyn gently wiped the girl's face with her thumb, but Ruby cried herself to exhaustion, eventually falling asleep in her arms.

As Evelyn tried to stand, her legs prickled with numbness.

"Careful!"

Sebastian lunged forward, catching her as she stumbled.

"Ugh—" He grunted when her weight slammed into his chest.

"Pins and needles," Evelyn explained awkwardly.

Sebastian frowned, fingers brushing her chin. "You're hurt."

A thin red line stood out starkly against her pale skin.

"Must've been a hairpin scratch." Only then did the sting register.

"Let's get that treated." His expression darkened as he pulled her toward the door.

The director hurried after them. "My deepest apologies! I'll call the doctor immediately."

"It's nothing serious." Evelyn waved her off. "The children's wellbeing comes first."

Scarlett's gaze burned into their clasped hands, a shadow flickering in her eyes.

###Chapter 442

"I'm Fine!"

Two voices rang out simultaneously. Sebastian Valdemar and Evelyn Roland locked eyes before bursting into laughter.

The headmaster glanced between them, a knowing smile flashing across his face.

"I'll continue researching treatment options for Guoguo. Please keep monitoring the other children's conditions and update me."

"Of course!"

The headmaster grasped Evelyn's hands tightly, eyes glistening with emotion.

After leaving Sunshine Special School, Evelyn remained unusually quiet.

Sebastian held her delicate hand without pressing for explanations.

Once inside the car, he handed her a bottle of mineral water.

"Autism treatment takes time. You're already doing amazing work."

"I know. It's just seeing those children..."

Evelyn yawned and leaned back against the seat. "I'll rest my eyes."

The morning's activities and playing with the children had drained her energy.

"Sleep."

The comfortable temperature and Sebastian's smooth driving soon lulled her into deep slumber.

He stole glances at her peaceful face, unable to resist brushing his fingers against her cheek.

"Are we there?"

Evelyn blinked awake to find the car parked outside Massachusetts General Hospital.

"Why are we at the hospital?"

"Bandage change." Sebastian unbuckled his seatbelt. "For my peace of mind."

"Alright."

They exchanged smiles before walking into the hospital together.

Emerging later with fresh bandages, they burst out laughing at their matching dressings.

Back at Château Blanc, Evelyn's phone rang as soon as she stepped out of the car.

Bianca Savigny's frantic voice came through. "Where are you?"

"What's wrong?"

"Check Twitter now!"

Bianca arrived panting, only then noticing Sebastian. "Mr. Valdemar."

"What's happening?"

Bianca pulled up Twitter's trending page.

"You're being targeted again."

The top trending tags read:
#EvelynRolandAbusesSpecialNeedsKids
#FakePhilanthropistExposed

The comments section overflowed with vitriol:
[Who does this charity fraud think she is? Disgusting!]
[CH Jewelry is canceled!]
[Someone investigate this witch!]

###Chapter 443

Bianca Savigny's fingers flew across the tablet screen as trending hashtags refreshed rapidly. Her voice was laced with urgency as she explained the situation.

"Give it to me."

Sebastian Valdemar extended his hand, his gaze icy. The chilling aura around him made Bianca instinctively hand over the tablet.

"Bullying?"

His fingertip scrolled through the screen, his expression darkening with each vile comment. The offensive words made his spine stiffen, his jaw clenched tight.

"Master, could it be someone from the inside?" Bianca asked cautiously. "Judging by the camera angle, they were standing very close to you."

Evelyn Roland's eyes darkened as her fingers absently tapped the desk. "Whoever it is, they've picked the wrong target."

Finding the culprit would be easy. But the way they'd deliberately captured Ruby crying, without even blurring her face—it was malicious. The safety of those special children...

"What do you need me to do?"

Sebastian's voice, firm with concern, pulled her back. His intense gaze locked onto her. "The school's surveillance footage is ready whenever you need it."

"Not yet." A cold smile curved Evelyn's lips. "If they want to play with public opinion, I'll give them a show they won't forget."

She hadn't wanted to make a scene, but someone was begging for trouble. Now, they'd reap what they sowed.

"Let's go." She stood, a glint of steel in her eyes. "The real drama is just beginning."

Meanwhile, Scarlett Galatea scrolled through the trending list with satisfaction. The trolls she'd paid handsomely had already stirred chaos, flooding the comments with venom.

"Turn up the heat." She smirked as she messaged the gossip accounts. "I want Evelyn Roland ruined!"

Within two hours, #EvelynRolandAbusesChildren exploded to the top of the trends. The official accounts of Château Blanc and Roland Group were bombarded with furious demands for an apology.

"Serves her right." Scarlett watched the numbers climb, finally allowing herself a triumphant smile. "This is what happens when you steal my projects."

Chaos erupted in Roland Group's PR department. The director burst into Edward Roland's office, beads of sweat on his forehead.

"What?!"

Edward slammed his hands on the desk, rattling the teacup. He quickly created a family group chat—excluding Evelyn—and added everyone.

The moment the messages went through, the chat exploded.

Alexander Roland: Who dares mess with my sister?!
Julian Roland: We're not standing by this time!
Isabella Langley: Should I contact my media friends?

The brothers' messages poured in, each laced with barely contained rage. Edward watched the screen, his expression turning dangerous.

"Investigate." His reply was a single word. "Leave no stone unturned."
###Chapter 444

Julian Roland slammed his palm on the coffee table in the Roland family living room. "Find them! We must uncover who took those photos!"

"Father, I've already contacted campus security," Edward Roland adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his gaze sharp as a blade behind the lenses.

Sophia Roland clutched her phone tightly. "Evelyn must be devastated right now..."

"I'm going to check the school's surveillance footage," Alexander Roland stood abruptly, only to be yanked back by his father.

Meanwhile, Isabella Langley stared at her phone screen, nails digging into her palms. The flood of concern for Evelyn in the group chat made her stomach churn.

"Isabella? You look pale," a coworker asked worriedly.

"I'm fine," she forced a smile and flipped her phone face down.

The family group chat buzzed with heated discussions until Edward's message cut through: "We'll proceed as Evelyn wishes."

The scene shifted to Evelyn Roland, flanked by Sebastian Valdemar and Bianca Savigny as they whispered strategies. A sudden video call interrupted them.

"Evelyn!" Four anxious faces crowded the screen.

"Mom, Dad, brothers—don't worry," Evelyn reassured them with a calm smile. "I have a plan."

After hearing her scheme, the family relaxed—except Alexander, who fumed. "Those unethical media outlets need to be shut down!"

"Brother, their insults are too amateurish," Evelyn blinked playfully.

"You're serious?" Alexander gaped, wondering if the backlash had broken his sister.

After the call, Evelyn logged into Weibo and typed: See you all live tomorrow. A warning to certain people—don't provoke me.

The post went viral instantly. Netizens erupted with speculation about her next move.

Alexander forwarded it to the family group and paced the living room. Suddenly inspired, he pulled out his phone.

Ding—
Ding-ding-ding—

Four consecutive transfer notifications chimed. Evelyn arched a brow at the staggering sums on her screen.

"Master, this is..." Bianca peered over, eyes widening.

Sebastian's gaze also locked onto the amounts. Then—a fifth transfer alert popped up.

All three froze in unison.
###Chapter 445

Evelyn stared at her phone screen for a long time.

The nine-figure sum Sebastian had just transferred glared back at her. The endless string of zeros made her eyes sting.

She finally tapped "Accept."

She also collected the transfers from the Roland family.

She knew this was their way of showing concern—though admittedly, it was a rather blunt approach.

Bianca quietly pulled out her phone and opened the transfer app.

Evelyn stopped her with a look.

"Don't."

"But—"

"They don't need it."

The words struck Bianca like a dagger.

She pressed her lips together and put her phone away.

Compared to Sebastian, who could casually transfer nine figures, her savings were practically pocket change.

Bianca quickly shifted gears, steering the conversation toward their upcoming livestream.

After finalizing the details, Sebastian stood to leave.

The next morning.

Sunshine Special School.

"Look! It's Evelyn Roland!"

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the car, angry shouts erupted.

A crowd of strangers pointed and hurled insults at her. Among them, a young couple stood out—their eyes bloodshot, their faces twisted with rage.

"Let me go! I need to get to her!"

The couple struggled against the security guards, screaming, "Evelyn, you vile woman! Using our daughter for fame! You deserve to die!"

Evelyn immediately recognized them—Ruby's biological parents.

The ones who had abandoned their child.

The crowd jeered:

"Disgusting!"

"Exploiting a disabled child for clout—have you no shame?"

Security formed a human barricade, holding back the furious mob.

Evelyn calmly scanned the crowd.

Her composure only fueled their anger.

Thud!

A water bottle flew toward her.

She sidestepped, and it missed her by inches.

"Ms. Roland, I'm so sorry—" The school director rushed forward, sweating profusely. "We'll issue a statement—"

"Let them in," Evelyn interrupted, her gaze locked on the couple. "But keep them away from Ruby."

The director nodded hastily.

Inside the classroom, the children were having their lesson.

The moment Evelyn entered, the restless atmosphere stilled.

"Ruby."

As Evelyn approached the corner, the usually silent little girl reached out—asking to be held.
###Chapter 446

"Let's take the child outside for some air."

The moment Ruby was carried out of the hall, the couple lunged forward like starving wolves.

"Give us back our daughter!"

The little girl trembled violently, burrowing deeper into Evelyn Roland's arms.

"If you want her to recover, shut your mouths!"

Evelyn's voice was calm, but her gaze was sharp as ice.

She knelt down, lips moving silently. The live-stream audience could only see her gentle motions, not hear her whispered words.

"Ruby!"

The mother clutched her husband's sleeve, too terrified to take another step.

[Such theatrics!]
[Faking it!]

Evelyn suddenly pulled out a tattered rag doll.

"Waaah—" Ruby burst into loud sobs.

The couple charged forward like madmen.

"Don't touch her!"

The little girl spread her arms like a protective hen, shielding Evelyn.

Tears streaked her face as she glared with clear, stubborn defiance. "She's a good person!"

The air froze.

"Ruby... you can speak?" The father's voice shook.

The child watched them warily, like a bristling kitten.

"It's okay, Ruby."

Evelyn gently stroked her hair.

"Sister~" Ruby turned and hugged her, planting a soft kiss on her cheek.

"We're your parents!"

The couple's heartbroken wails were met with their daughter's icy indifference.

"I like her best."

The innocent words silenced the live chat.

The couple paled.

Viewer numbers skyrocketed.

Everyone wondered why this child clung to a stranger.

"Explain these scars?" Evelyn coldly pushed up Ruby's sleeve.

Countless needle marks glared under the camera lights.

The couple immediately ducked their heads.

The stream exploded.

"Monsters!"
"They've been abusing her all along!"
"We've been fooled!"

The loudest critics now ate their words, faces burning with shame.
###Chapter 447

"Ms. Roland, these marks..." The principal's face paled as she pointed with trembling fingers at the needle marks covering Ruby's arms.

The teacher gasped, rushing forward to inspect them.

The tiny scars blended almost seamlessly with her skin, nearly invisible unless examined closely. Ruby always sat quietly in the corner—no one had imagined she carried such a terrible secret.

"Care to explain?" Evelyn Roland's voice was ice-cold.

The couple turned ghostly white, their lips trembling wordlessly.

The livestream viewer count skyrocketed, comments flooding the screen.

[New here—what's happening?]
[Those monsters abused their autistic daughter!]
[Ms. Roland is a hero for exposing them!]

"Ruby," Evelyn knelt to meet the little girl's eyes. "Tell me what happened."

Ruby clutched her sleeves, her voice barely audible. "They... poked me with needles... called me worthless..."

Before she could finish, the child threw herself into Evelyn's arms, her small frame shaking like a leaf.

Evelyn's eyes darkened, her nails digging into her palms.

"That's not true!" the woman shrieked. "We had no choice! She's been like this since birth—the neighbors judged us, we couldn't take it anymore—"

The man dropped to his knees, sobbing. "We were wrong, we admit it—"

The room erupted in outrage.

"Call the police," the principal said, voice shaking as she pulled out her phone. "People like you don't deserve to be parents."

As sirens wailed in the distance, a clear child's voice suddenly rang out: "Sister!"

Everyone turned to see a porcelain-skinned little boy sprinting toward them. Behind him, Sebastian Valdemar walked slowly with a stunning woman on his arm.

The livestream exploded.

[Mr. Valdemar?!]
[Is that his wife?]
[Their visuals are insane!]

Ruby lifted her tear-streaked face to the newcomers. But Sebastian's gaze remained fixed on Evelyn, his eyes swirling with unreadable emotion.
###Chapter 448

"Thud!" A small figure barreled into Evelyn Roland's arms like a cannonball, glaring warily at Ruby.

Olivia Valdemar hurried forward and enveloped Evelyn in a warm embrace. "Evelyn, you shouldn't have had to go through this."

Ruby clutched her dress hem and shrank back, eyeing the sudden newcomer with timid curiosity.

"This is Ruby," Evelyn murmured, smoothing Theodore's hair before gently guiding the children to shake hands.

Two small hands hesitantly touched.

"From today onward, you'll be friends."

The two special children tilted their heads, intrigued by this new concept.

"Olivia, what brings you here?" Evelyn brushed dust off her clothes while keeping a firm grip on both children.

Olivia checked her watch. "You're trending everywhere. Theodore insisted on seeing you. Traffic was terrible."

Evelyn nodded gratefully, her gaze flickering to the man standing nearby.

Sebastian Valdemar's cool eyes were fixed on her.

When their eyes met, the corner of his mouth lifted almost imperceptibly.

"Hello everyone!" Theodore suddenly turned to face the camera, enunciating clearly. "I'm Theodore, just like Ruby!"

Evelyn's heart clenched.

The little boy faced the lens without fear. "Evelyn made me better. Nobody gets to hurt her!"

Olivia's eyes instantly welled up.

Ruby stepped forward too, tiny fists clenched. "If anyone bullies her, I'll call the police!"

Their innocent words dissolved the tension.

Both children looked up at Evelyn. "Don't be scared."

"With you here, how could I be?" Evelyn ruffled their hair affectionately.

Their cheeks turned pink with shy delight.

The livestream exploded.

#EvelynRolandHealsAutisticChildren began trending globally at unprecedented speed.

The clip went viral across every platform, appearing on virtually every smartphone screen.

[Tears... Dr. Roland saved two children]

[Those rumor-mongering accounts belong in hell!]

[Report them! Make the liars pay!]

The troublemaking couple was escorted away by police as onlookers dispersed.

When the broadcast ended, Sebastian was the first to reach Evelyn's side.

"You're leaving?" Ruby clung to Evelyn's sleeve.

Evelyn knelt to meet her gaze. "Will you help me take care of the other children, Ruby?"

The girl nodded vigorously, extending her pinky. "Pinky promise!"

Their elongated shadows stretched across the ground in the setting sun's glow.
###Chapter 449

Evelyn Roland stood outside the hall, her fingertips gently stroking Theodore's soft fur.

Her phone screen lit up as she dialed the familiar number.

The call connected almost instantly.

"Evelyn!"

Edward's voice brimmed with unconcealed joy.

"Dad, I met a child named Ruby at Sunshine Special School."

Her gaze drifted through the glass window, settling on the little girl quietly drawing in the classroom.

"I want the Roland Group to sponsor her."

The rustling of papers came through the line.

"We're watching the livestream. PR has already drafted a proposal."

Edward's tone was steady and firm.

Sophia's voice chimed in the background: "Tech team has blocked over three hundred malicious accounts."

The headmistress approached with red-rimmed eyes, wringing her hands.

"Miss Roland—"

"Take good care of Ruby."

Evelyn gently cut her off, giving her shoulder a reassuring pat.

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground.

Meanwhile, online outrage continued to escalate.

Countless netizens refreshed the police department's official page, waiting for updates.

At 8:17 PM, the A City Police finally posted.

The two-thousand-word statement detailed the case with chilling clarity.

Among the nine attached photos, the most shocking was the image of Ruby's bruised back.

The comment section exploded.

"Monsters!"

"Chemical castration now!"

"Thank Goddess Evelyn for exposing these demons!"

In the Beverly Hills villa, Scarlett Galatea stared at her phone, nails digging into her palms.

She hurled the device against the wall.

The shattering screen echoed through the empty bedroom.

"Why..."

Her trembling hand reached for the perfume bottle on the vanity.

Just as she was about to throw it, the landline's shrill ring froze her.

The caller ID made her pupils constrict.

"Madame has suffered a heart attack. They're resuscitating her now."

The butler's voice cracked with tears.

The perfume bottle slipped from her fingers, rolling across the carpet.

Scarlett grabbed her car keys and bolted out.

Three ambulances idled outside the ancestral home.

Their sirens pierced the night like screams.
###Chapter 450

Margaret Lefèvre paced anxiously across the living room until Scarlett Galatea appeared at the doorway. Only then did her racing heart settle slightly.

"The Dowager's condition has suddenly worsened."

Scarlett's chest tightened. Her fingernails dug into her palms unconsciously.

"What happened?"

"After dinner, she complained of dizziness. When she lay down to rest, she started vomiting." Margaret's voice trembled. "I couldn't reach the Master."

"Father is on a flight." Scarlett recalled her father's parting instructions, her brow furrowing.

"Has the doctor arrived?"

"He's upstairs examining her now."

Scarlett glanced at the open door on the second floor but didn't rush up. Standing at the foot of the stairs, her chest felt like it was weighed down by a stone.

Her grandmother's health had been declining over the past two years, but only minor ailments. Tonight's episode was the first serious one in a long time.

Even if her father turned around immediately, it would take hours for him to return. Too late to be of any help.

"Doctor!" Scarlett hurried forward as the family physician descended.

"I recommend immediate hospitalization for further tests." The doctor's expression was grave. "The Dowager's condition isn't promising."

Scarlett's vision darkened momentarily. She nearly lost her balance.

"Is it critical?"

The doctor's silence spoke volumes.

"Let's get her to the hospital first for a full examination." His words were carefully measured.

After seeing the doctor out, Scarlett rushed upstairs. The elderly woman on the bed looked gaunt, aged years in mere days.

"We're leaving for the hospital now!"

In the ambulance, Scarlett clutched her grandmother's hand so tightly her nails left crescent marks in her own palm.

"You must stay strong, Miss." Margaret's eyes were red-rimmed as she tried to comfort her.

Scarlett nodded mechanically, her fingers moving on their own to dial a number.

On the terrace of Château Blanc, Sebastian Valdemar arched an eyebrow at the name flashing on his phone screen.

"Scarlett?"

He glanced at Evelyn Roland beside him before answering.

"Sebastian..." Scarlett's voice cracked through the line, thick with unshed tears. "My grandmother is critically ill. Can you come to the hospital with me?"

Evelyn's wine glass paused mid-air.

"Send me the address." Sebastian's response was clipped.

"Massachusetts General Hospital! We're en route now!"

Too distraught to notice Sebastian's use of "we," Scarlett hung up.

Turning to Evelyn, Sebastian asked, "Coming to the hospital?"

"Of course." Evelyn's lips curved into a cold smile as she drained her glass.

An inexplicable weight settled in Sebastian's chest.
###Chapter 451

"Why are you looking at me like that?" Evelyn Roland's lips curved slightly, amusement flickering in her eyes. "Do I seem like the petty type?"

Scarlett Galatea's matter truly didn't weigh on her mind. Since Sebastian Valdemar had spoken up, and it involved a life-or-death situation, she wasn't about to make a fuss over something so trivial. Unless, of course, the other party crossed a line.

Seeing Evelyn's composed expression, the tension in Sebastian's shoulders finally eased.

"Shall we go?"

As he stood, his black dress shirt accentuated his tall, lean frame. The collar was slightly open, revealing a glimpse of his collarbone. Those usually stern eyes now brimmed with tenderness.

"Mmm." Evelyn gave a slight nod, casually gathering her long hair.

——

In the hospital corridor, Scarlett stared blankly at her phone screen.

She hadn't expected Sebastian to actually agree. The realization made her lips curl upward unconsciously.

"He's not... completely indifferent to me after all."

The thought of that man sent a pang of bitterness through her heart. Why did Evelyn get to monopolize someone like him? Just because she met him first?

"Miss?" Mrs. Lefèvre called out worriedly, only to frown at the smile on Scarlett's face.

"Huh?" Scarlett snapped out of her daze and quickly explained, "I contacted a highly skilled doctor. Grandma will be saved."

"You've worked hard, miss." Mrs. Lefèvre's expression softened.

Scarlett stood to leave but froze after two steps at the sound of approaching footsteps.

"Sebastian..."

Her face lit up, only to stiffen the moment she spotted Evelyn. Her smile turned to ice.

"Miss Galatea." Evelyn spoke first, her tone neutral.

Scarlett clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. "Miss Roland is here too?"

"Yes."

Evelyn swiftly tied up her hair, revealing her smooth forehead. She pulled out a medical license from her bag, flashing it briefly. "Shall we see the patient first?"

"What?" Scarlett's pupils contracted. She instinctively took half a step back.

"Don't worry." Evelyn waved the license. "Fully certified."

Scarlett stared at the document, her lashes fluttering rapidly.

"Where's the patient?" Evelyn met her gaze directly, her eyes clear and unwavering.

Scarlett bit her lip. "No need to trouble yourself. I know Miss Roland's skills are exceptional, but my grandmother's condition... is rather unique."

The refusal couldn't have been clearer.

"Very well." Evelyn tucked the license away without hesitation. "Then I won't intrude."
###Chapter 452

Scarlett exhaled silently as Evelyn withdrew her hand.

No one understood Evelyn's capabilities better than her. That night in the warehouse, she'd witnessed how this woman stopped her bleeding wounds with just a few silver needles. Not to mention the incident with Theodore and Ruby, which left her both terrified and resentful.

Her refusal was simple—she couldn't let Evelyn steal the spotlight in front of Sebastian again.

"That won't be necessary." Scarlett blocked the hospital room door. "Grandmother's condition is unique. It's better to wait for a professional doctor."

Evelyn shrugged indifferently, exchanging a glance with Sebastian as she turned.

Hurried footsteps suddenly echoed from the end of the corridor.

A man in a white coat strode toward them, his name tag glinting under the lights—Dr. Neil Harrison.

"Where's the patient?" His tone was arrogant, his sweeping gaze dripping with impatience.

Scarlett hurried forward. "Dr. Harrison, this way, please."

He stopped abruptly, pointing at Evelyn and Sebastian. "Clear the area. My rule—no outsiders during consultations."

Scarlett hesitated. "This is Mr. Valdemar, CEO of Valdemar Group—"

"I don't care who he is!" Neil cut her off. "Either follow my rules, or I walk right now."

He leaned against the wall, hands in pockets. Everyone in the industry knew his temper. Countless wealthy clients begged for his services. His presence today was already a favor to the Galatea family.

Scarlett bit her lip. "Miss Roland, would you mind—"

"Understood." Evelyn chuckled softly, her fingers tapping lightly against the jade bracelet on her wrist. "Sebastian, let's not interfere with the doctor's work."

As she turned, she heard Scarlett's deliberately softened voice. "Mr. Valdemar, would you mind waiting in the lounge?"

The operating room light turned red.

On the corridor bench, Evelyn toyed with her phone as an encrypted message flashed across the screen.

"This Dr. Harrison has quite the reputation," Sebastian remarked suddenly.

"Indeed." Evelyn didn't look up. "Published in The Lancet three years ago. Specializes in geriatric cardiovascular diseases."

Scarlett approached with two coffees. "My apologies. Dr. Harrison is an internationally renowned expert. His temper is... challenging."

"Understandable." Evelyn accepted the coffee, then asked abruptly, "How did you secure his services, Miss Galatea?"

"I called in several favors." A flicker of pride crossed Scarlett's face. "He was attending a conference in A City. I paid double his usual fee."

Evelyn took a sip, her eyes glinting with quiet mockery.

Neil's skills were undeniable, but his methods were rigidly conventional. And Madeline Galatea's condition... was far from straightforward.

The operating room doors burst open. A nurse rushed out in panic.

"Family! The patient is experiencing ventricular fibrillation!"

Scarlett's coffee cup shattered on the floor.
###Chapter 453

Sebastian's brows furrowed into a tight knot, his knuckles turning white from the force of his grip.

"It's nothing worth mentioning."

Evelyn's voice was calm, but a flicker of exhaustion passed through her eyes.

That very composure cut into Sebastian like a blade. He would have preferred her anger—even if she threw things in a rage. He had forced her to intervene, and now she bore this humiliation in silence.

"You'll turn into a grumpy old man if you keep frowning like that."

Her cold fingers brushed against his furrowed brow.

The sound of the operating room doors swinging open froze Scarlett in place. The intimate gesture felt like a bucket of ice water drenching her to the bone.

"It must be a misunderstanding..."

She dug her nails into her palms until they left crescent marks. Sebastian only tolerated it out of politeness—that had to be the reason!

Scarlett forced herself forward, stubbornly taking a seat beside Sebastian. The moment she leaned closer, his sharp gaze sliced through her, draining the color from her face.

The three of them sat in silence on the bench. Mrs. Lefèvre paced anxiously by the operating room doors, her footsteps grating against the tense atmosphere.

Scarlett clenched her skirt. Though the distance between them was equal, an invisible barrier separated Sebastian and Evelyn. She felt like an intruder—an audience member who had stumbled onto the wrong stage, where even breathing seemed out of place.

"Dr. Harrison!"

The moment the operating room doors opened again, Scarlett lunged forward. But when she saw the doctor's ashen face, her heart plummeted.

"Where's my grandmother?"

Her trembling hands gripped his lab coat.

Dr. Harrison's temple gleamed with sweat, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. The nightmare in the operating room flashed through his mind—the shrill alarms, the spiking blood pressure, the sudden flatline...

"I'm so sorry."

He bowed deeply, the back of his coat soaked through.

Scarlett staggered back, colliding with the cold wall. Dr. Harrison mechanically recounted the surgery, each word like a dull knife sawing into her flesh.

"Severe rejection reaction..."

"Multiple organ failure..."

"Resuscitation unsuccessful..."

By the end, his voice shook. This surgery should never have been his to lead—yet now, he carried the weight of a life lost.
###Chapter 454

The operating room's red light glared ominously. Dr. Neil Harrison yanked off his bloodstained gloves with rough impatience.

"Dr. Harrison!" Scarlett Galatea clutched desperately at his sleeve. "My grandmother is still in there!"

"Hopeless case." He shook her off. "Make funeral arrangements."

Scarlett staggered back, colliding with the wall.

"What kind of doctor are you?" Her voice cracked with anguish.

Dr. Harrison whirled around, his white coat slicing through the air like a blade.

"Say that again?"

Evelyn Roland leaned against the wall, twirling a scalpel between her fingers. The cold steel reflected against her sharp jawline.

"She called you incompetent." A smirk played on Evelyn's lips. "Shall I document that in the medical records?"

Dr. Harrison's face darkened. For years he'd dominated the medical circles in this city. Never had anyone dared humiliate him publicly.

"Fine. Just fine." He ground his teeth. "Let's see how you handle this mess."

Evelyn was already pushing through the operating room doors. The nurses exchanged uneasy glances but followed instinctively.

"Miss Galatea." Evelyn glanced back. "Activate all recording devices."

Her gaze cut sharper than any scalpel. Scarlett found herself nodding before she realized it.

Dr. Harrison pulled out his phone with a sneer. "Shall I call the mortuary for you?"

Inside, heart monitors shrieked their shrill alarms.

The snap of Evelyn's latex gloves echoed through the tense silence.

"Hemostat."

Her quiet command made every spine straighten.

Under the surgical lights, the elderly woman's pallid face had taken on a deathly gray hue. Evelyn's blade made its first precise incision.

Outside, Dr. Harrison sighed loudly for effect. "There's still time to stop this farce."

Scarlett dug her nails into her palms.

Time congealed like clotting blood. Three hours passed. The operating light remained lit.

Margaret Lefèvre steadied the swaying Scarlett. "That girl's eyes... they're different."

Dr. Harrison scoffed, scrolling through his phone. "Amateur theatrics."

Suddenly—the light blinked out.

When the doors opened, Evelyn's mask bore flecks of blood. She removed her cap, dark hair cascading down like a waterfall.

"Alive." One word.

Dr. Harrison's phone clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 455

The red surgical light burned like fire.

Scarlett's nails dug deep into her palms. She felt no pain—only the violent hammering of her heart against her ribs.

Sebastian stood motionless at the end of the corridor, his tall frame casting a long shadow. His obsidian eyes remained fixed on the operating room doors.

"Mr. Valdemar..." Scarlett's voice trembled. "Grandmother will be okay... right?"

Silence. His gaze never wavered from those doors.

Inside the OR, tension hung thick as fog.

"BP still dropping!"
"Prep the epinephrine!"
"Clamp! Now!"

Beads of sweat dotted Evelyn's forehead. Her hands moved with mechanical precision.

"Dr. Roland, flatline again!"
"Charging paddles!"

Dr. Harrison smirked against the wall. He'd known this would happen. What could some rookie possibly do for a critical case like this?

"Clear!"

The elderly patient's body arched violently before collapsing back onto the table.

"We've got a pulse!"
"BP stabilizing!"

A collective exhale filled the room. Evelyn's hands trembled slightly, but her gaze stayed steady.

"Continue suturing."

When the lights finally dimmed, every staff member slumped with exhaustion.

"We did it..." A young nurse slid to the floor, tears streaming down her face.

Evelyn removed her mask, revealing a deathly pale complexion. Her lab coat clung to her, soaked through.

"Wheel her out."

The doors swung open. Scarlett lunged forward like an arrow loosed from its bow.

"Grandmother!" She crashed against the gurney, voice shaking. "What did you do to her?"

The medical team parted in silence. Only then did Scarlett see the steady rise and fall of the old woman's chest.

"The patient is stable." Evelyn's quiet voice silenced the entire hallway.

Dr. Harrison's face twisted with fury. His glare at Evelyn burned with venom.

Sebastian finally moved. He strode to Evelyn and—before everyone—pulled her into his arms.

"You did it." His murmur was velvet against her ear.

Evelyn sagged against his shoulder, allowing herself one fleeting moment of weakness.
###Chapter 456

The moment their eyes met, Scarlett's breath hitched in her throat.

"The patient is temporarily out of danger. If there's no fever within 24 hours, she'll regain consciousness."

Aunt Margaret burst into tears.

Scarlett stood frozen, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Medical staff wheeled the hospital bed toward the ICU while the others crowded around Evelyn Roland, their gazes filled with admiration.

The young woman remained expressionless, as if she'd just performed a routine procedure.

"Miss Roland's medical skills are extraordinary for someone so young..."

"Far superior to certain so-called experts who only chase fame!"

Dr. Neil Harrison's face flushed crimson.

Scarlett kept her head down, avoiding Evelyn's piercing gaze.

"I'm going to see Grandma."

Sebastian Valdemar's icy voice cut through the air. "Miss Galatea, this isn't over yet."

Every eye in the corridor turned toward Scarlett.

"Dr. Harrison, didn't you claim the situation was critical?"

Beads of sweat formed on Neil's forehead. "I did everything I could! If not for my initial resuscitation efforts—"

"So you're saying I merely reaped the benefits of your work?" Evelyn's lips curved in a humorless smile.

"Pull the surveillance footage," Sebastian commanded, his tone glacial.

Scarlett clenched her fists. "Check it!"

"No!" Neil suddenly lunged forward.

Evelyn's eyes darkened as she delivered a swift kick.

Thud.

Neil crashed to the floor, his face a mask of disbelief.

"You—"

"Silence." The single word dripped with impatience.

The entire hallway fell deathly quiet.
###Chapter 457

The surveillance room supervisor rushed over with a laptop, followed by the hospital director wiping sweat from his brow.

"Mr. Valdemar! Ms. Galatea! Ms. Roland!"

The director's gaze swept across the group, beads of perspiration forming on his forehead. He silently congratulated himself for coming personally.

Dr. Harrison's face turned ashen.

The surnames Valdemar and Roland echoed in his mind. He felt he'd seen them somewhere but couldn't recall the details.

Then it struck him like lightning.

"Evelyn Roland? From the Forbes list?"

"Correct." Evelyn's lips curved slightly.

"And you must be Sebastian Valdemar of Valdemar Group?"

"Flattering." Sebastian's tone was cool.

Dr. Harrison's legs weakened, his ears ringing. What idiocy had he just committed?

Evelyn swiftly took the laptop. "Since doubts have been raised, let's settle this publicly. I never take what isn't mine, but what belongs to me can't be taken."

Dr. Harrison's Adam's apple bobbed soundlessly. He watched helplessly as Evelyn opened the video file, then squeezed his eyes shut in despair.

"No! You can't watch this!"

He lunged madly for the laptop, only to be thrown to the ground by a bodyguard's judo flip.

The dull thud made everyone gasp.

No one pitied him now.

"Grandma?!"

Scarlett's eyes reddened instantly at the elderly face on screen.

What followed shattered her heart.

The video showed Madeline Galatea's vitals crashing. Monitor numbers plummeted as medical staff urgently reported to the lead surgeon.

Dr. Harrison ignored them, focused solely on his task.

Only when the ECG flatlined did he panic and halt the procedure.

Then Evelyn arrived—and a miracle occurred.

Within thirty minutes, that deadly flatline revived into a steady rhythm.

Evelyn's skilled hands moved with precision, her surgical team executing her commands flawlessly.

Even at double speed, the breathtaking rescue left everyone awestruck.
###Chapter 458

The operating room lights flickered off, the air thick enough to choke on.

Dr. Neil Harrison slumped to the floor, fingers clawing at the tiles until his knuckles turned white. His lips trembled. "I followed every protocol... The old woman's condition was too complex—"

Silence swallowed his words.

Evelyn Roland leaned against the wall, idly tapping her folded arm. A humorless laugh escaped her. "Playing God when you knew the risks—is that your idea of medical ethics?"

Dr. Harrison's Adam's apple bobbed, sweat trickling down his temples.

Dark spots danced in his vision. Sebastian Valdemar stood three paces away, while Scarlett Galatea's grip on her phone turned her fingers bone-white. Any one of them could destroy him with a snap of their fingers.

Worse was the hospital director's glacial stare. Performing an unauthorized cross-hospital procedure was bad enough—now there was a corpse involved.

"Video evidence clear enough for you?" Evelyn straightened, her lab coat flaring. "Miss Galatea, he's yours to deal with."

Scarlett's chest heaved.

Sebastian's voice cut through the tension. "Hesitation breeds ruin." His gaze flicked to Scarlett's quivering lashes. "Need me to handle it?"

"No—" Scarlett stumbled back half a step. "I need to see Grandmother."

Dr. Harrison lunged for her hem, only to be wrestled down by security. He twisted toward Evelyn, pupils dilating wildly. "You can't—"

"Director." Sebastian's interruption came like an ice pick.

The balding director bowed obsequiously. "Mr. Valdemar, rest assured we'll conduct a thorough investigation."

The steady beep of monitors echoed from the corridor's end. Evelyn massaged her temples as Sebastian's arm encircled her shoulders. "Home."

Passing the crumpled doctor, Evelyn paused. The man on the floor shook like a leaf in a storm, his lab coat wrinkled beyond recognition.
###Chapter 459

"Dr. Roland, please wait."

The hospital director hurried after her, eyes gleaming with admiration. Having reviewed the surgical footage repeatedly, he was awestruck by the young female surgeon's extraordinary skills.

As the head of this elite medical institution, he'd always prided himself on his expertise. But Evelyn Roland's flawless technique made him recognize true mastery for the first time.

"Dr. Roland, we sincerely invite you to join our team." His voice carried genuine respect. "We'll offer you the most competitive compensation package."

Other physicians gathered around, especially those who'd witnessed the surgery—their gazes brimming with reverence. They yearned to learn from this brilliant surgeon, yet none dared overstep.

Sebastian Valdemar's possessive glare had made the boundaries abundantly clear.

"No, thank you." Evelyn's refusal was crisp. "I don't work well with constraints."

Disappointment flickered across the director's face, though he'd anticipated this outcome.

——

Inside the private suite, Scarlett Galatea clutched her grandmother's frail hand, tears soaking the sheets.

"Miss, Dr. Roland assured us Madeline will recover," Mrs. Lefèvre murmured soothingly.

Scarlett's expression darkened—until she felt the faintest twitch against her palm.

"Grandmother?" Her head snapped up just as the elderly woman's eyelids fluttered open.

"Scarlett..." Madeline whispered weakly before succumbing to exhaustion again.

"Get the doctor!" Scarlett shouted.

Mrs. Lefèvre rushed out, finding Evelyn mid-conversation. "Dr. Roland! She's awake!"

This exceeded even Evelyn's projections. One elegant brow arched. "Let's assess her."

A retinue of physicians fell into step behind her—an unspoken acknowledgment of her authority.

At the ICU entrance, Evelyn glanced back at Sebastian, silently instructing him to wait. The last thing this porcelain-skinned aristocrat needed was more exposure to pathogens.

The corner of his mouth lifted in acquiescence.
###Chapter 460

The sterile operating room hummed with activity as doctors suited up in protective gear.

Metal instruments clinked sharply against trays in the hallway.

"Vitals stabilizing!" A nurse called out excitedly from the monitoring station.

Madeline Galatea's eyelids fluttered weakly before opening.

Her clouded gaze settled on a striking young woman standing nearby.

Margaret Lefèvre stepped forward quickly. "Madam, this is Dr. Roland. She saved you."

The elderly woman studied Evelyn Roland's face with surprising intensity.

Evelyn returned the scrutiny calmly. Despite her frail condition, the matriarch's commanding presence remained undiminished.

"Let me examine you," Evelyn said coolly, her movements gentle despite her clinical tone.

Madeline suddenly grasped her hand. "Child, I owe you my life."

"Just doing my job." Evelyn deftly withdrew her hand. "You need rest. Try not to exert yourself."

In the corner, Scarlett Galatea dug her nails into her palms.

"Scarlett!" Madeline's voice rang out unexpectedly strong. "Come meet Dr. Roland."

The two young women locked eyes.

"An honor," Evelyn said with a faint smile.

Scarlett forced a tight-lipped grin.

Madeline chatted animatedly with Evelyn, oblivious to her granddaughter's strained expression.

"Where's Sebastian?" the matriarch asked suddenly.

Heavy footsteps approached from the corridor.

Sebastian Valdemar strode in, his gaze immediately finding Evelyn.

"You're looking much better, Madam," he remarked in that deep baritone.

Madeline beamed. "All thanks to you two lovebirds—"

"Madam!" Evelyn's ears turned pink.

Sebastian's lips twitched, though his tone remained professional. "Credit goes to Dr. Roland's medical expertise."

The room's atmosphere shifted palpably.
###Chapter 461

Madeline Galatea studied Evelyn Roland intently, her admiration growing more evident with each passing moment.

This girl was truly extraordinary.

Those clear, unflinching eyes showed not a trace of timidity. In all her years, Madeline had met countless people, but rarely had she encountered someone so composed at such a young age.

That calm, unshakable poise alone commanded respect.

"Madame Galatea, since you're recovering well, I'll take my leave now." Evelyn deftly gathered her silver needles with practiced efficiency.

Madeline exchanged a glance with Margaret Lefèvre, both women's eyes brimming with gratitude.

"Dear child, once this old bones feels better, you must come visit." Madeline's voice was warm. "Margaret will prepare her specialties for you."

Evelyn gave a slight nod, her gaze briefly flickering to Scarlett Galatea before turning away.

She had barely stepped out of the ICU when hurried footsteps followed.

"Miss Roland!" Scarlett caught up, pulling a black card from her purse. "Ten million. Please accept it."

"Unnecessary." Evelyn's tone remained detached.

Saving lives had never been about payment. Had Sebastian Valdemar not intervened, she wouldn't have set foot in this hospital.

"You must take it!" Scarlett insisted, thrusting the card forward. "Grandmother insisted. You saved her life—you saved our entire family."

Evelyn gently pushed the card away. "It was nothing."

Undeterred, Scarlett pressed it into her palm. "The PIN is six zeros." Without waiting for a response, she spun on her heel and marched off, shoulders set with determination.

Back in the room, Madeline reclined against the pillows as her granddaughter returned. "Why the rush, child? I'm perfectly fine now."

Scarlett buried her face against the elderly woman's shoulder, voice trembling. "You terrified me..."

"Silly girl." Madeline stroked her hair. "Thank Mr. Valdemar and Evelyn. We owe them everything today."

At Sebastian's name, Scarlett's expression shifted. "Grandmother... what do you think of Mr. Valdemar?"

"That young man..." Madeline's eyes sparkled. "Handsome, distinguished, though he seems rather frail. But..."

Her tone turned playful. "Standing beside Evelyn? They complemented each other perfectly. Like a pair carved from jade."

Scarlett's smile froze. "What did you say?"

"I said they look destined for each other." Madeline chuckled. "Can't you see it?"

Scarlett's fingers tightened imperceptibly around the bedsheet.
###Chapter 462

The hospital corridor was bathed in harsh fluorescent light.

Scarlett clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms. Behind her, excited chatter spilled from the hospital room—Grandma and Mrs. Lefèvre's voices, each word like a knife twisting in her chest.

"They make such a perfect match!"
"Did you see the way Sebastian looked at Evelyn?"

Her stiletto slammed into the wall, sending a shower of plaster dust to the floor. Scarlett stared at the dent she'd left, her chest heaving.

Why?
Why did everyone think they belonged together?

Meanwhile, the black Maybach glided through the night.

Evelyn leaned against the seat with her eyes closed, long lashes casting shadows. Sebastian kept stealing glances at her, his grip tightening on the steering wheel.

"We're here."

The car stopped in front of the villa. Sebastian's voice was soft when he spoke. Evelyn opened her eyes, still drowsy.

"Need me to carry you inside?"
His deep tone held a hint of hope.

She shook her head—but as she pushed the car door open, her pinky hooked around his. That tiny gesture made his eyes light up instantly.

Fingers intertwined, they walked toward the entrance. The night breeze carried the faint scent of flowers.

"This is far enough." Evelyn stopped at the door.

Sebastian suddenly pulled her into his arms. Warm breath brushed her ear: "Remember. No other man steps foot in your home except me."

The tips of her ears turned pink, but she feigned composure as she pushed him away. "Are you restricting my freedom, Mr. Valdemar?"

"What if I am?" He arched a brow, danger glinting in his gaze.

Evelyn chuckled and swiped her keycard. As the door closed, she caught him still standing there, watching intently through the gap.

She slammed it shut deliberately—but the moment she turned away, her lips curved up.

Outside, Sebastian stared at the door, his Adam's apple bobbing. After a long pause, he shook his head and left.

Back in the hospital corridor, Scarlett's phone screen lit up. An unknown number had sent a photo—Sebastian holding Evelyn intimately.

Her nails scraped across the screen with a screech.
###Chapter 463

A tall figure emerged from the corner of the parking lot.

Sunlight slanted across the man's sharp profile—Alexander Roland, Evelyn's third brother.

He had arrived ten minutes ago. His brow furrowed when his gaze landed on the familiar black Maybach.

Wasn't that Sebastian Valdemar's car?

Why was it parked outside his sister's company?

Just as he was about to step out to investigate, Sebastian drove off in haste.

"Strange..."

Alexander drummed his fingers absently against the steering wheel.

"Was he here to see Evelyn?"

From his angle, he'd completely missed the tense exchange at the entrance.

The car door slammed shut as Alexander adjusted his suit cuffs.

"Alex?" Evelyn nearly collided with him at the elevator. "What are you doing here?"

"Surprise inspection." His lips quirked as he studied her. "Making sure my little princess isn't getting into trouble behind my back."

She paused mid-step. "What trouble could I possibly be in?"

"I thought I saw Sebastian earlier."

"He just left." Her tone was casual.

Alexander's pupils constricted. "So he was here for you?"

"He gave me a ride back. That's all."

"What?!" His voice shot up like a startled cat. "Since when are you two so close?"

He gripped her shoulders. "Don't tell me you and that guy—"

"Alex!" Evelyn cut him off with an exasperated sigh. "It's strictly business."

"Really?" His gaze burned into her. "That man's cunning as a fox. Don't let him fool you."

"Cough—"

Evelyn choked on her water, the tips of her ears turning suspiciously pink.

"Easy there!" Alexander patted her back before realization struck. "Wait...that reaction..."

He leaned in abruptly. "Did you two already—"

"No!" Her denial came sharp and swift.

Yet unbidden memories surfaced—tangled limbs in a hotel room, scorching breaths, burning palms...

"Why are you blushing harder?" His eyes narrowed.

Evelyn ducked her head under the guise of coughing, avoiding his scrutiny.

"Just choked, that's all."

Only after triple-checking her expression did Alexander finally relax.

"Good." He ruffled her hair, then abruptly changed tack. "Not that I'm against you dating..."

Evelyn rolled her eyes discreetly.

"When you're older, you can date as many guys as you want..."

His lecturing voice faded into the background as Evelyn gazed at the darkening twilight outside, her thoughts drifting to that dangerously alluring man.
###Chapter 464

Morning sunlight filtered through the gap in the curtains as I rubbed my tired eyes.

Staying up late talking with Edward last night left my head still foggy.

The living room was empty when I went downstairs, only a steaming breakfast and a note on the dining table.

"Evelyn, I'm off to work. Don't forget to eat. —Alex"

A smile tugged at my lips as I snapped a photo of the heartwarming scene.

The moment I sent the picture to Sebastian, a video call notification popped up.

"Where's Evelyn?" His voice came through the phone, eyes scanning the background.

"She's at work." I took a bite of the sandwich, savoring the melted cheese.

Sebastian's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. "You're alone at her place?"

"I have my reasons." I teased, watching his jaw tighten instantly.

The call went silent as his gaze sharpened.

Finishing the last bite, I lowered my voice. "Sebastian... I think Evelyn might be seeing someone."

His pupils visibly constricted on screen.

Meanwhile, at the Valdemar estate...

Olivia set down her coffee cup, eyeing her brother sitting in the shadows.

"What's got you grinning like an idiot in the middle of the night?"

A faint smile lingered on Dominic's lips as his fingers traced the phone screen.

"Sis... I think I've found her."

The cup clattered against the table.

Olivia stared at her brother's unusually soft expression before realization dawned.

"That Roland girl?"

Dominic remained silent, but the faint blush creeping up his ears spoke volumes.

"Don't tell me..." Olivia inhaled sharply, "you went to see her last night?"

Outside, the morning sun continued its ascent.

Standing by my office window, I absentmindedly touched my burning earlobe.

My phone vibrated with a new message:

"Lunch today? —L"

My finger hovered over the screen as memories of last night's unexpected embrace resurfaced.

Just as I bit my lip to reply, the office door swung open.

"Director, we have an urgent project requiring your attention."

I didn't notice my own smile as I set the phone down.

Meanwhile, Alexander was practically bouncing during his video call with Sebastian:

"Her lips were unusually red when she came home! And I definitely smelled perfume!"

Sebastian's expression darkened before he abruptly stood up.

"I'm taking leave immediately."
###Chapter 465

Julian Roland's pupils constricted sharply as his fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk.

"Sebastian Valdemar?"

His Adam's apple bobbed as he stared at his grinning younger brother on the screen. "I'll handle this."

"Take me with you?"

"Not happening."

The call ended abruptly. Alexander Roland bared his teeth at the darkened phone screen.

"Suit yourself!"

He snatched his car keys and bolted toward the garage. Today, he would unmask the bastard who'd stolen his sister away.

The sports car roared out of the Beverly Hills estate.

At the three-way intersection, Alexander slammed the brakes.

"Damn it..."

He raked fingers through his hair before swerving toward Château Blanc.

The security guards bowed at the familiar vehicle. But Alexander remained hunched in the driver's seat, sunglasses and mask obscuring his face.

Noon sun scorched the windshield.

"Don't tell me..." Visions of Evelyn and Sebastian's romantic rendezvous flashed through his mind. He covered his eyes dramatically. "My retinas!"

Knock knock knock.

The sudden rapping nearly launched him through the roof.

"Alex?"

His sister's icy voice pierced through the glass. Alexander turned to stone.

"Counting to three." The temperature dropped further. "One—"

The door flew open. Alexander forced a grimace that resembled a smile. "Fancy meeting you here, Evie."

Evelyn crossed her arms, fingers drumming against her elbow. "My phone's been alerting me since you ran the first red light."

"......"

Alexander leaned back so abruptly he nearly toppled into the footwell.

"Care to explain?" His sister's tilted head sent chills down his spine.

"I—I came for wine tasting!"

"With binoculars and a voice recorder?"

His ears burned crimson. Inspiration struck. He adopted a brooding expression. "Actually, I'm writing a detective novel..."

"Oh?" Evelyn drew out the syllable before yanking his ear. "Would you like firsthand prison research?"

"Ow ow ow! I confess!"

Their entangled shadows stretched across the pavement under the midday sun. Passing staff members ducked their heads to hide laughter.

Rubbing his throbbing ear, Alexander suddenly noticed faint red marks peeking above Evelyn's collar.

"Evie, your neck—"

The words died in his throat under her glacial stare.

"Alex." She smoothed her cuffs with deliberate slowness. "You were saying something about a confession?"

Alexander swallowed hard. In this moment, he knew with absolute certainty—he was dancing on the razor's edge of oblivion.
###Chapter 466

Alexander Roland met his sister Evelyn's amused gaze, his knees inexplicably weakening.

He quickly slung an arm around her shoulders, forcing a playful shake. "Come on, let's grab lunch. I've been waiting in the car so long I'm starving."

"Serves you right."

Her merciless three-word reply made his expression shift.

"I'm serious."

As they walked toward the winery, he lowered his voice, probing again. "Evelyn, were you at the winery all morning? Didn't leave?"

Here we go again.

Evelyn stopped walking, her almond eyes locking onto his. "I left a note. Didn't you read it?"

"I did."

He wouldn't dare admit he'd read it and still doubted her.

That would earn him an immediate scolding.

"Hurry up."

Alexander quickened his pace, feigning starvation.

Evelyn studied him for a moment before lazily curling her lips. "Fine."

The restaurant was already set with an exquisite lunch spread, the artful plating whetting their appetites.

"Sit."

"Where's your little apprentice?"

"She had business elsewhere."

Hearing Bianca wasn't around, he visibly relaxed.

"Alexander, have some tea."

The warm tea soothed his throat.

"Alexander, stop looking. It's just us."

Caught, his ears tinged pink.

"I wasn't—just admiring the winery decor. Heh."

"Really?"

"Let's eat."

He hastily served her food, changing the subject.

"Not as good as your apprentice's cooking," he remarked after one bite.

"Good memory. But Bianca only cooks when she's in the mood."

Alexander choked.

Right. Better focus on eating.

Evelyn set down her cup. "Next time she cooks, I'll call you."

"Definitely call me!"

After the meal, Alexander slumped in his chair, too full to move.

"Want to help me take inventory in the cellar this afternoon?"

Since surveillance was his real purpose, he agreed instantly.

Casually, he asked, "Your business partner not joining?"

"You'll find out this afternoon."

Seeing her evasion, he dropped the subject.

With him keeping watch, nothing could go wrong.

He sighed inwardly, missing the message Evelyn was sending.

"Don't come to the winery today."

Sebastian Valdemar replied instantly with three question marks.

Evelyn: "I'll explain later. Just do it."

Sebastian: "As you say."

Satisfied, she pocketed her phone.
###Chapter 467

The grapevines of Château Blanc shimmered gold in the setting sun. Alexander Roland swirled his wine glass, his gaze sweeping across every corner.

"That kid didn't show up today?"

He took a sip, brow slightly furrowed. Sebastian Valdemar, the workaholic, shouldn't have missed today's wine tasting—especially with Evelyn here.

"Am I overthinking this?"

Alexander shook his head. Two career-obsessed people couldn't possibly spark anything. He drained his glass in one go, deciding to keep observing.

As night fell, Alexander personally drove his sister home.

"Evelyn, security hasn't been great lately." He stood at her doorstep, holding two bottles of rare vintage. "Don't go out at night, and never open the door for strangers."

Evelyn nodded resignedly, watching her third brother leave before a faint smile touched her lips.

The sound of running water ceased as Evelyn towel-dried her hair and headed to her bedroom. Her phone lit up, the notification chime perfectly timed.

Sebastian: Asleep?

Her fingers hovered over the screen before she replied: About to.

An instant voice call appeared.

"About that text earlier..." Sebastian's voice carried a hint of hesitation through the receiver.

Evelyn chuckled softly, recounting the day's events without holding back.

"Seems I'm not doing well as a secret boyfriend." The sound of fingers tapping a desk accompanied his mock-wounded tone. "Making my girlfriend hide me away like this."

"Then you'll have to step up your game." Evelyn's eyes narrowed playfully. "Convince me to go public sooner?"

A teacup clinked on the other end. "Deal. I'll work on it."

After hanging up, Sebastian stood before his floor-to-ceiling windows. The city glittered below, but his office was so quiet he could hear the clock ticking.

"The Roland brothers..." He massaged his temples. "More troublesome than expected."

Meanwhile, Alexander drove home. Glancing at the passenger seat's wine bottles, he suddenly hit the brakes.

"No. Big brother should handle this."

The next morning, Evelyn and Bianca Savigny headed to Massachusetts General Hospital to visit Madeline Galatea.

"Boss, your charm is off the charts!" Bianca chattered nonstop.

Suddenly, she whirled around. "We're being followed!"

In the rearview mirror, a black sedan trailed them at a steady pace.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Let them."

She'd noticed the car earlier—just hadn't expected them to be so impatient. The steering wheel spun smoothly under her hands as she turned onto a quiet backroad.

"Boss, where are we going?" Bianca white-knuckled the seatbelt.

"Meeting an old friend." Evelyn accelerated. The black car predictably sped up behind them.

Sunlight filtered through leaves, dappling the windshield with shifting patterns. Squinting against the glare, Evelyn made a sharp turn, parking neatly at the winery's back entrance.

"Out." She unbuckled crisply. "Game on."
###Chapter 468

The black SUV in the rearview mirror maintained a steady distance, neither too close nor too far. Evelyn Roland tapped her fingers lightly on the steering wheel, a faint smirk playing at the corners of her lips.

"Evelyn, that car behind us..." Bianca Savigny gripped the seatbelt nervously.

"Mhm. It's been tailing us for three blocks." Evelyn's tone was as casual as if she were discussing the weather.

Bianca stole a glance at the profile of the woman in the driver's seat. The sharp nose, the thin lips pressed together, the slender fingers wrapped around the wheel—it all looked strangely familiar.

"It's Julian!" she blurted out in realization.

Julian Roland kept his eyes fixed on the red sports car ahead when suddenly, a pair of amused eyes met his in the mirror. He instinctively touched the bridge of his nose, frowning in confusion.

Why wasn't this girl the least bit rattled?

"Hold on," Evelyn said abruptly.

Before Bianca could react, the sports car shot forward like an arrow. With a series of smooth lane changes and overtakes, the black SUV in the rearview mirror quickly shrank to a tiny speck.

"Sir, we lost them," the adjutant in the passenger seat reported quietly.

Julian slammed his fist against the steering wheel and pulled over. Several military vehicles behind him followed suit, and a dozen young soldiers in civilian clothes scrambled out to form neat rows.

"Who ordered you to follow me?" Julian's voice was icy.

"Sir, we were just on leave—"

"All of you!" Julian barked, cutting him off. "Back to base! Training grounds, now!"

Half an hour later, the training field was littered with groaning soldiers. A dozen burly young men lay sprawled on the ground, too exhausted to lift a finger.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's phone rang.

"Ms. Roland! We did it!" Daniel Murphy's excited voice crackled through the receiver. "The results match our projections perfectly!"

In the lab, Daniel and David Murphy clutched the hard-won report in trembling hands. The edges of the paper were damp with sweat, but neither dared loosen their grip.

"We actually pulled it off..." David's voice shook.

Daniel suddenly pulled his brother into a bear hug. The two grown men stood there, eyes red, laughing and crying at the same time.

"It's all thanks to Ms. Roland," Daniel said, wiping his face. "Without her guidance—"

"Yeah," David murmured, gazing at the darkening sky outside. "I wonder when she'll come see these results for herself."

The fading sunlight streamed through the lab windows, painting everything in warm hues of orange. The research report lay quietly on the table, every page brimming with hope.
###Chapter 469

"Daniel, do you think Ms. Roland will be satisfied?"

Inside the laboratory, Daniel and David Murphy waited anxiously. The success of this drug development owed much to Evelyn Roland. From initial data corrections to every critical milestone, her precise guidance had been indispensable.

Though they were the primary researchers, everyone knew Evelyn was the driving force behind this project.

When they first took on the autism medication research, the brothers had felt overwhelming pressure. Now, with a breakthrough finally achieved, they couldn’t wait to report their progress to Evelyn.

Footsteps echoed behind them. Both turned simultaneously.

"Ms. Roland! Mr. Valdemar!"

Evelyn and Sebastian Valdemar approached side by side. Daniel immediately stepped forward. "Ms. Roland, please take a look at our results."

Inside the glass-walled lab, Daniel carefully retrieved a transparent container and poured out an orange-colored lozenge.

"This is our improved formula, now with natural fruit flavoring."

Evelyn took the lozenge, rolling it between her fingers. Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting a crystalline shimmer across its surface.

"Considering children’s preferences, we’ve also developed multiple flavors," David added. "Strawberry, grape, apple—all kid-approved."

Sebastian stood nearby, his gaze settling on the neatly arranged samples on the lab bench.

"What about the liquid version?"

David promptly produced a small blue vial. "This one acts faster, but the taste isn’t as pleasant."

Evelyn uncapped the bottle, releasing a faint medicinal scent. Her brow furrowed slightly. "Clinical trial data?"

The lab fell silent.

Daniel rubbed his hands together. "So far, we’ve only tested it on animals..."

"The results are promising, but human trials are different," David continued, his voice trailing off.

Sebastian moved to the computer, swiftly scanning the experimental data. "I’ll arrange the clinical trials."

The brothers exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Mr. Valdemar!"

"This was always my project," Sebastian replied evenly, though his words made both men flush.

Evelyn set the vial back on the table. "Side effect reports?"

Daniel hurriedly flipped open another file. "Here’s the detailed log—mostly minor gastrointestinal reactions..."

Outside, sunlight streamed through the windows. Reflections from glassware danced across the walls like celebratory confetti for this pivotal moment.
###Chapter 470

Daniel straightened his posture and solemnly patted his chest. "According to the lab rat data, side effects do exist, but they're not severe. Initial symptoms may include loss of appetite and drowsiness."

These symptoms were still within manageable limits. Evelyn remained uneasy, holding the sugar-coated pill as she glanced at the brothers. "Mind if I run another test?"

The brothers scratched their heads sheepishly, shaking them like rattles. "We'd be honored! Having your oversight puts us at ease!"

In their eyes, Evelyn was nothing short of divine.

Fifteen minutes later, Evelyn closed her notebook, a gleam of triumph in her eyes. "The experiment was a success. I'll arrange human trials soon. You two can take a few days off." She paused. "Before you leave, make sure all data and samples are securely locked away."

"Don't worry!" they chorused. "We'll take shifts guarding them. No outsiders will get near."

Evelyn gave a lazy nod.

"Will you be staying, Miss Roland?" The brothers' eyes sparkled with hope. No one wanted to miss a chance to learn from the master.

"Call me if anything comes up."

As they watched her leave, the brothers reluctantly retreated into the lab.

Evelyn didn’t head out immediately. Instead, she followed Sebastian to his office.

The entire floor was silent except for the clatter of keyboards and rustling papers. Occasionally, an employee would glance up, unfazed by Evelyn’s presence. Though the CEO was often accompanied by this beauty, no one dared assume romance was involved.

Her cap was pulled low, revealing only the elegant line of her jaw. Evelyn walked straight ahead, ignoring the sidelong looks.

"Sit."

The moment she settled into a chair, Theodore entered with drinks. "For the CEO's—uh, Miss Roland, your juice." He nearly bit his tongue.

"And the CEO’s coffee."

"Leave us."

Sebastian took a sip before setting his cup aside.

Evelyn massaged her temples. "There’s no need to go through the trouble. I don’t visit often enough to warrant special preparations."

Every time she came to Valdemar Group, the office was stocked with fresh refreshments. The thoughtfulness left her unsettled.

Sebastian’s gaze was tender yet unyielding. "Then visit more often. The ingredients are replenished daily. If you don’t like these, we can switch to something else."

Evelyn: "..."

She took a sip of the juice. Freshly squeezed—clearly, no effort had been spared.

"This is perfect."

"Good." Sebastian smoothly changed the subject. "Leave the volunteer recruitment to me. You should rest."

Even if she’d been scarce in the lab lately, he knew exactly how much she’d poured into the experiment.
###Chapter 471

"Fine, I'll be the hands-off boss then."

Evelyn Roland's lips curved slightly, a glint of mischief flashing in her eyes. She knew full well how much Sebastian Valdemar cared for her.

Sebastian's smile deepened at her words.

They didn't linger on the conversation. Evelyn stood to take her leave.

Sebastian rose as well, insisting on seeing her out. Knowing it was pointless to refuse, she let him accompany her only as far as the elevator.

"Master!"

Bianca Savigny had been waiting in the car. She popped her head out the moment Evelyn returned.

"How's the lab progressing?"

Though Bianca wasn't directly involved in the project, she kept close tabs on her mentor's work. The condition of those autistic children weighed heavily on her mind.

"We've started recruiting volunteers for drug trials."

"There'll be so many applicants! Children like Ruby finally have hope."

Bianca's expression grew somber at the thought of those special kids.

"Let's go home."

Meanwhile, after seeing Evelyn off, Sebastian immediately summoned Theodore Ashcroft.

"Expedite the volunteer recruitment. I want the analysis report ASAP."

"Understood, sir."

Sebastian took the documents, calmly reviewing the recruitment details as he issued instructions.

Theodore moved swiftly. By noon, all official Valdemar Group accounts simultaneously pinned an announcement.

Within one minute of posting, comments surpassed a thousand.

The lunchtime news instantly went viral.

With the Ruby incident still fresh, news of a breakthrough drug spread like wildfire. Netizens following the story were electrified.

Many parents of autistic children wept with relief.

In under ten minutes, reposts broke ten thousand. Comments skyrocketed.

Unprecedented engagement!

Seeing the unanimous praise, Theodore finally relaxed enough to grab lunch.

Once the volunteer program launched successfully, Valdemar's stock would soar—and his bonus along with it.

The thought made him practically float. He could see himself at this company for five, ten, even twenty more years!

Applications and resumes flooded in like snow. The overwhelmed backend team wished they had three heads and six arms.

"Sir, today's applicant list. This is the preliminary screening of qualified candidates for your review."

Theodore delivered the latest data immediately after lunch.

"Over two hundred qualified applicants in one afternoon?"

The number made Sebastian frown. "Thoroughly vetted?"

The special school already had many children. With this influx of volunteers, the scale of autism cases far exceeded expectations.

"Should we interview all of them, sir?" Two hundred interviews would be a massive undertaking.

"What's this one's situation?"

On the last page, Sebastian paused, pointing to a specially marked name in the corner. "Melanie Linton?"
###Chapter 472

Theodore Ashcroft leaned over the documents, his pupils contracting sharply. He recognized the distinctive medical emblem, his fingers tapping lightly on the paper.

"Mr. Valdemar, this case involving Melanie Linton is highly unusual." Theodore adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Bipolar disorder coupled with severe autism spectrum disorder. She hasn't spoken a word in five years."

Sebastian Valdemar's fountain pen paused mid-signature, leaving a small ink blot on the document.

"All records verified?"

"Absolutely. She's the most complex case among over two hundred volunteers." Theodore slid the file forward. "I'm concerned about the risks if Ms. Roland takes this on."

A brief silence settled over the office. Sebastian gestured dismissively, and Theodore quietly exited, closing the door behind him.

Dusk painted the skyline beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows. Sebastian stared at his phone screen, hesitating before finally selecting the video call option.

The dial tone echoed sharply in the empty office.

"Busy?" The call connected to an empty frame, only rustling sounds audible.

"Almost done." Evelyn Roland's voice carried a faint echo from the lab.

Sebastian loosened his tie, his gaze dropping to the case file. When her composed face finally appeared on screen, the tension in his brow eased unconsciously.

"Trouble?" Evelyn held a mug, instantly recognizing his uncharacteristic demeanor.

He lifted the file toward the camera. "Need your opinion on a special case."

"More applicants than expected?" She set down her cup, fingers flying across the keyboard. Only then did she notice the explosion of sign-ups across social platforms.

"Not about numbers." He transmitted Melanie's records. "This one's too high-risk."

Silence stretched on the other end. Evelyn zoomed in on the medical images, her professional instincts immediately recognizing the severity.

"I need to evaluate her personally." Her tone brooked no argument.

Sebastian's knuckles rapped the desk. "Considered the PR fallout? The Starlight Initiative is under intense scrutiny."

"All the more reason we can't turn her away." Evelyn's gaze pierced through the screen. "Send the complete files. You'll have my decision by tonight."

That stubborn glint in her eyes reminded him of their first meeting in the lab. She'd worn the same expression when convincing him to fund what seemed like an impossible project.

"Fine." He finally relented. "But I'm joining the evaluation."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Since when did Mr. Valdemar develop such interest in psychology?"

"Since meeting a certain psychiatrist." His deadpan retort succeeded in tinting her ears pink.

After the call ended, Sebastian stood before the panoramic windows. City lights twinkled like distant stars. His mind returned to the case photo—a girl curled tightly in a corner.

Risk and opportunity always walked hand in hand. Just like his gamble on Evelyn Roland.
###Chapter 473

Evelyn Roland reclined lazily on the sofa, her fingertips lightly tracing the rim of her teacup. She narrowed her eyes, concealing all emotion behind her lashes. "Don't worry. I know my limits."

Sebastian Valdemar's gaze pierced through the phone screen, dark and fathomless. "Want to go for a walk?"

She glanced at the wall clock, her long lashes lowering. Her knuckles tapped twice against the table before she finally shook her head. "No." Her brothers' suspicions hadn't faded yet. She had to tread carefully.

"Alright. Get some rest." Sebastian's voice was low and restrained. He stared at the face he'd longed for day and night, his knuckles whitening. A mere few dozen kilometers apart, yet it felt like an insurmountable chasm.

In an old apartment complex in City C, under dim yellow light, a middle-aged couple clutched each other's trembling hands. Richard Linton's knuckles were pale, while Margaret Linton's tears traced the wrinkles on her face.

"Richard... do you really think this will work?" Margaret's voice quivered. "Will Valdemar Group even see our application?"

Richard wrapped an arm around his wife's frail shoulders. "The Roland heiress cured Ruby. Our Melanie will—" His voice caught in his throat.

Thud!

A heavy object crashed to the floor in the bedroom. The couple's faces drained of color as they stumbled toward the door.

Melanie Linton stood by the bed, her hair disheveled, clutching a fruit knife. The blade glinted coldly under the light, mere inches from her slender wrist.

"Melanie!" Margaret's legs gave way, her voice breaking. As she lunged to grab the knife, she saw the terrifying emptiness in her daughter's eyes.

Richard wrapped his arms around Melanie from behind, his voice shaking. "Dad found a doctor who can help you. The Roland family's miracle healer..." He felt her body stiffen slightly in his embrace.

Over the years, they'd traveled across the country, spent their life savings, only to be met with disappointment time and again. Melanie's medical records stacked up waist-high, every diagnosis reading the same: Recommended to discontinue treatment.

Until they saw the news about Ruby's recovery.

Back in the living room, Richard downed the last of his liquor and slammed his fist against his temple. The bedroom door creaked open, revealing Margaret with swollen, red-rimmed eyes. At the sight of empty bottles littering the floor, her lips trembled. "You drank this much again..."
###Chapter 474

Three empty beer bottles lay toppled on the coffee table. Richard Linton clutched a half-empty bottle, his knuckles white.

"I'm a pathetic father." His voice cracked as he pounded his chest.

Margaret Linton silently pried the bottle from his grip, her fingers trembling.

The clock struck ten. A sudden chime shattered the silence.

"Ding—"

Margaret fumbled for her phone with shaking hands. The next moment, she clung to her husband, laughter mingling with tears.

"What's going on?" Richard slurred, bleary-eyed from both alcohol and her frantic shaking.

"The Starlight Initiative! It's a response from the Starlight Initiative!" She wiped her glasses repeatedly, afraid her eyes deceived her.

The signature at the end of the message pierced their hearts like a blade.

"Melanie can be saved..."

Years of suppressed sobs erupted in the dead of night. In her bedroom, Melanie Linton stared blankly at the ceiling, listening to her parents' weeping. A numb smile tugged at her lips.

Two days later.

The high-speed train raced north. The Lintons clasped hands, hope radiating from their faces.

"How much longer?" Margaret asked for the tenth time.

"Soon." Richard patted her hand reassuringly.

At A City Medical Center, Evelyn Roland's lab coat was immaculate. Sebastian Valdemar stood beside her, his presence commanding. The Linton family huddled on their chairs like misplaced ducklings among swans.

After brief pleasantries, Evelyn flipped open the medical file. "We'll need more detailed treatment records."

Margaret's teacup trembled, sending ripples across the surface.

"No need for hesitation." Evelyn tapped the desk lightly. "Doctor-patient confidentiality is fundamental."

"It's not that..." Richard wiped sweat from his brow.

"Have some tea first." Evelyn slid a strawberry cake toward Melanie, her gaze briefly skimming the girl's pallid face.
###Chapter 475

Margaret Linton's hands trembled slightly.

She gazed at the ethereal young woman before her, her heart pounding wildly.

"Cough... cough..."

A violent coughing fit seized Margaret. She doubled over, her face flushing crimson.

Evelyn Roland's sharp gaze immediately focused on her.

"Have you been experiencing chest tightness and shortness of breath recently?"

Margaret's head jerked up in surprise.

Evelyn's fingers were already pressing against her wrist, taking her pulse.

"Deficiency in both qi and blood. Stagnation of liver qi."

Margaret froze. "Miss Roland, I..."

"You should get a full medical examination," Evelyn withdrew her hand. "Especially a chest CT scan."

Margaret's face drained of color.

She'd been experiencing these symptoms but dismissed them as exhaustion.

Never had she imagined...

"Thank you!" Margaret suddenly stood and bowed deeply.

Evelyn steadied her.

Up close, the renowned healer's beauty was breathtaking. Porcelain skin. Cool, elegant features. Even her breath carried a faint herbal fragrance.

Margaret's eyes welled with tears.

"Tell me about your daughter's condition."

Margaret took a shaky breath. "Melanie..."

Her voice caught.

Her husband gently squeezed her hand.

"She was such a lively child. Then at three years old, she developed a high fever..."

Margaret's voice grew quieter.

"After that..."

She suddenly dropped to her knees. "Dr. Roland, please save her!"

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly.

Sebastian Valdemar stepped forward immediately. "Mrs. Linton, please stand."

"I-I'm sorry..." Margaret scrambled to her feet.

Evelyn's gaze shifted to the small girl huddled in the corner.

"I'm afraid she isn't suitable for the trial."

The air turned icy.

The Lintons exchanged stunned looks.

"W-why?" Richard Linton's voice shook.

Evelyn's eyes darkened.

"Because..."
###Chapter 476

Mrs. Linton's fingers tightened around her purse strap, her knuckles turning white.

Her lips trembled slightly, but no coherent sound escaped.

"Miss Roland, please reconsider..." Her voice was rough, as if scraped by sandpaper, laced with unmistakable tremors.

Evelyn Roland set down the file in her hands, her gaze calm to the point of indifference.

"Mrs. Linton, our drug hasn't undergone human trials yet."

"I know..."

"Melanie's condition can't withstand any risks." Evelyn's fingertips tapped lightly against the desk. "If rejection occurs, the consequences would be catastrophic."

Mr. Linton's hand jerked suddenly, his coffee cup clinking sharply against the saucer.

"My apologies."

Evelyn stood and bowed, her black hair slipping over her shoulders. "We'll cover all examination and travel expenses in full."

As she turned, the hem of her coat stirred a faint breeze.

"How could this..." Mrs. Linton murmured, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"Miss Roland!"

A cold hand suddenly seized Evelyn's wrist.

Mrs. Linton's breathing was ragged, as if she'd just run a marathon. "Let Melanie try the drug. We'll accept any outcome."

Tears welled in her eyes, hovering on the brink of falling.

"She could die." Evelyn's voice was soft, yet it landed like a sledgehammer.

Mr. Linton staggered, gripping the chairback for support.

Melanie, who had been as still as a doll, suddenly lifted her head. A ripple of emotion flickered in her lifeless eyes.

"We accept." Mr. Linton's voice was hoarse, barely recognizable. "Better than watching her live like this..."

His smile was more painful than tears.

Evelyn's gaze swept over the family of three before she shook her head decisively. "No."

"Yes."

Sebastian Valdemar's voice cut through from the doorway, carrying an unshakable authority. "But they'll need to sign a liability waiver."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, all traces of gentleness vanishing.

"Are you sure?" A cold smirk curled at the corner of her lips.

Sebastian met her gaze and suddenly wondered if this decision might be a mistake.
###Chapter 477

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed as his gaze flickered under the hopeful stares of the Linton family. Finally, he lowered his lashes and swallowed his words of explanation.

"Mr. Valdemar, are you truly willing to help?"

Mr. and Mrs. Linton's eyes darted between Sebastian and Evelyn, their hope gradually fading into disappointment. Mrs. Linton's eyes reddened.

After a moment of silence, Sebastian gave a slow nod.

"Wonderful!" Mr. Linton rushed forward, his rough hands gripping Sebastian's. "Mr. Valdemar, you're our savior!"

"I'll have the specific terms drafted by my team." Sebastian subtly withdrew his hand. "You should settle in first."

"Of course, of course!"

The Lintons bowed repeatedly, pulling their daughter along. Sensing the tension between Sebastian and Evelyn, they quickly excused themselves.

"Evelyn."

The moment Evelyn stood, Sebastian seized her wrist. He forcibly interlaced their fingers, his grip unyielding.

Evelyn met his gaze in silence.

"We need to talk." His voice was deep, brooking no argument.

Her wrist ached as she struggled futilely. A vein throbbed at her temple, her eyes flashing with defiance. "I have things to attend to, Mr. Valdemar."

The air turned glacial.

"The Lintons' situation is indeed unusual—" Sebastian tried to explain.

"Your decision suffices." Evelyn's tone was icy, her brow furrowed.

"Master!" Bianca suddenly bounded around the corner, freezing at the sight of their standoff before attempting to retreat.

"Stop." Evelyn called her back. "What is it?"

"I... I mixed a new drink and wanted your opinion." Bianca hunched her shoulders nervously.

"Let's go." Evelyn wrenched her hand free and strode away without a backward glance.

Bianca offered Sebastian an apologetic smile before scurrying after Evelyn.

Sebastian massaged his temples but didn't pursue them. He turned and left the winery, his oppressive aura leaving a trail of unease.

At Valdemar Group's reception, a new intern was organizing files when she collided with an immovable figure. Looking up into Sebastian's frigid stare, her legs nearly gave out. "G-Good afternoon, CEO..."

Sebastian gave a curt nod and marched toward the elevator. Employees held their breaths in his wake.

"What's with the CEO today?" someone dared whisper once the elevator doors closed.

"Shh! Want to get fired?"

The entire afternoon passed in hushed silence at Valdemar Group. The rhythmic clatter of keyboards reached unprecedented efficiency.

"The terms are drafted." Theodore handed the documents to Sebastian.

Sebastian flipped through the pages, his expression growing colder. Just as he was about to speak, a knock interrupted.

"Mr. Valdemar," the secretary announced from outside, "Miss Olivia and young master Theodore have arrived."
###Chapter 478

"Have them wait in the lounge."

Sebastian Valdemar didn't look up as he gave the order, his long fingers pausing briefly on the document.

Theodore Ashcroft immediately set down his tablet and glanced at his boss.

"You may leave." Sebastian's voice was icy.

"Yes, sir." Theodore tactfully exited the office, closing the door softly behind him.

Sebastian shut the folder and stood, the cuffs of his suit flashing coldly under the light.

"Uncle!"

The moment the lounge door opened, a small figure barreled toward him like a cannonball.

Theodore Valdemar tilted his flushed little face up, arms wide as he threw himself into Sebastian's embrace.

"You're in high spirits today?" Sebastian scooped the boy up with one arm, lightly tapping his nose.

But a flicker of something unreadable passed through his eyes.

"You haven't come home in forever!" Theodore pouted accusingly. "Mommy says I can't bother you at work."

"Little troublemaker, tattling on me now?"

Sebastian pinched his cheek, eliciting a peal of laughter.

Who would've guessed this lively child had been a withdrawn autistic boy just six months ago?

"Sebastian."

Olivia Valdemar rose gracefully, taking her son from her brother's arms.

"Don't spoil him. He's five and still this clingy."

She settled Theodore on the sofa, where he immediately busied himself with building blocks.

A brief silence settled over the lounge.

Olivia absently smoothed her son's hair before speaking casually. "The volunteer list is finalized?"

"Here."

Sebastian handed her the tablet, his expression unreadable.

"Has Evelyn seen it?"

A nearly inaudible "Mm."

Olivia instantly noticed the shift in her brother's mood.

"Did you two argue?"

"No." His face remained impassive.

"Sebastian." Olivia met his gaze directly. "You can't lie to me."

He turned to stare out the window without answering.

"It's about the volunteers, isn't it?"

His fingers had tightened imperceptibly when she'd mentioned it earlier.

Sebastian moved toward the door. "Let me show you the lab."

"You..."

Olivia sighed but didn't press further.

Theodore blinked his large eyes between his uncle and mother before quietly returning to his blocks.

Adult world was far too complicated.

"Master! The mixing order totally changes the flavor!"

Bianca Savigny shook her cocktail shaker excitedly, eyes sparkling.

Evelyn Roland leaned against the bar, sipping her own concoction.

"Remember that sensation. You'll develop your own style eventually."

Bianca tried several recipes but kept hesitating.

She stole glances at her mentor's profile, wanting to ask about Sebastian but not daring.

Something was off—Evelyn drinking this early? Definitely not normal.

"Out with it."

Evelyn's sudden words nearly made Bianca drop her glass.

"Okay..."

Bianca clamped her mouth shut but fidgeted like a restless monkey.

What on earth had happened between her mentor and Sebastian?
###Chapter 479

The final list for the "Starlight Initiative" had just been finalized in the top-floor conference room of the Valdemar Group headquarters.

Melanie Linton's name stood out prominently, specially marked as a Tier 1 observation subject.

Scarlett Galatea received the news while secluded in a private booth at an exclusive club.

Her fingers glided repeatedly over the screen as she stared at the list.

"Scarlett, why are you hiding here alone?"

Her best friend approached with two glasses of red wine, offering one to her.

Scarlett tilted her phone toward her.

"Wow, Valdemar moves fast," her friend remarked after a sip. "But this Melanie Linton..."

"I heard Evelyn Roland personally approved the list," a girl in a sequined dress interjected, her eyes flashing with provocation. "As the project liaison, surely you had some say, Director Galatea?"

The music in the booth cut off abruptly.

Scarlett's friend slammed her glass down. "Some people should mind their own business. Since when do you get to gossip about Mr. Valdemar?"

The sequined girl pressed on. "I'm just curious. Miss Roland and Mr. Valdemar have been spending so much time together lately—"

"Enough!" Scarlett stood abruptly, her champagne-colored nails gleaming coldly under the lights. "I don't recall inviting you tonight."

The girl paled and clutched at her male companion's sleeve.

To her shock, the man shook her off and fawned over Scarlett instead. "Don't be upset, Scarlett. I'll make her leave."

"You—" The girl trembled with rage, her wineglass cracking under the pressure of her grip.

Scarlett smoothed her dress with practiced elegance and offered the room a composed smile. "Please, continue."

As music filled the booth again, the lively atmosphere returned.

Only Scarlett knew her heart had sunk to the depths.

"Should we go?" her friend asked quietly.

Scarlett shook her head, reapplying her lipstick with steady hands.

But the moment she stepped out of the club, she dialed a number. "I want Evelyn Roland's complete itinerary."

Her Maserati sliced through the night with a sharp turn.

The callback came swiftly.

"Are you sure?" Scarlett slammed the brakes, her nails digging into the leather steering wheel. "They're flying to Switzerland tomorrow?"

When the confirmation came, she stared at her distorted reflection in the rearview mirror—and suddenly laughed.

"Evelyn Roland..."

The name rolled off her tongue like shards of ice.
###Chapter 480

I should have known Sebastian Valdemar would side with Evelyn Roland. But I never expected her to act so brazenly and autocratically!

"Do you really think you'll get your way?" My fists clenched, nails digging deep into my palms. "I won't let you have what you want!"

From what I've gathered, Evelyn has been running wild under Sebastian's indulgence.

The more I think about it, the angrier I get. My chest burns with fury.

When I first saw Evelyn, I was indeed stunned by her beauty.

But later, that admiration turned to envy.

Why did she meet Sebastian before I did?

Why does she receive his special attention?

Why is she better than me in every way?

At Château Blanc, Evelyn suddenly shivered.

She rubbed her temples, sensing something ominous.

Her phone lit up—a message from Daniel Murphy.

"Mr. Valdemar has approved Melanie Linton's participation in the experiment."

She stared at the message, her gaze turning icy.

Another notification popped up—Olivia Valdemar's probing text.

Evelyn smirked and tossed her phone aside.

She understood Sebastian's decision, but she didn't agree with it.

Once she made her choice, she wouldn't change it for anyone.

Not even Sebastian.

The Lintons remained oblivious. They had just rented a cheap apartment in the suburbs.

By the time they finished unpacking, night had fallen.

Mrs. Linton gazed at the neon lights outside the window. "Melanie can be admitted tomorrow."

The next morning, the Lintons brought their daughter to the Valdemar Group's hospital.

"Is... is this really for us?"

The spacious, bright ward left the couple speechless.

A nurse smiled. "Mr. Valdemar arranged it personally."

Mrs. Linton wiped away tears.

As they settled in, a figure appeared at the doorway.

A young woman in a white dress, holding flowers, with a bodyguard carrying a gift box behind her.

Who was she?
###Chapter 481

"Is this Melanie Linton's room?"

Scarlett Galatea stood at the doorway, her gaze sweeping over the haggard middle-aged couple inside. She had already investigated the Linton family but pretended this was their first meeting.

"We're Melanie's parents. And you are?"

Mr. Linton eyed the well-dressed young woman warily, instinctively stepping in front of the hospital bed.

"I'm Scarlett Galatea, director of the Starlight Initiative." She offered a professional smile. "I meant to visit sooner, but work kept me busy. I brought some small gifts today."

Her assistant promptly placed several elegant gift boxes on the table.

Scarlett didn't linger. As she left, she cast a meaningful glance at the sleeping girl.

In the following days, Scarlett became a regular visitor. She brought expensive tonics and patiently listened to Mrs. Linton's struggles. Gradually, the older woman began confiding in her.

"Scarlett, we're so grateful..." Mrs. Linton's rough hands clutched hers, tears tracing the wrinkles on her face.

Scarlett suppressed her discomfort until a nurse called the family away for paperwork.

"Go ahead. I'll stay with Melanie."

The room fell silent. After ensuring they were alone, Scarlett swiftly retrieved a small vial from her bag. White powder dissolved soundlessly into the girl's water cup.

She stared at the bed, a flicker of conflict in her eyes.

"Don't blame me," she whispered. "Blame Evelyn Roland."

Melanie's eyes snapped open. Those clear pupils locked onto her, making Scarlett's heart skip.

"Awake? Have some water." She donned her gentle mask, helping the girl sit up.

Melanie drank mechanically.

"Did you know?" Scarlett leaned close to her ear. "Your parents grovel before us like dogs for your sake."

The girl's pupils contracted sharply.

"Watching them beg is pathetic." Scarlett continued softly, observing the girl's breathing grow ragged.

"You're so kind, Scarlett!" Mrs. Linton reentered, moved by the scene.

A week passed. Scarlett's "charity" earned unanimous praise from the medical staff. The Lintons' worried expressions eased, and Melanie's vitals stabilized miraculously.

No one noticed the growing vacancy in the girl's eyes.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Roland scrolled through a report on her phone, her frown deepening. She abruptly made a call.

"Who's responsible for Melanie Linton's medical data?" Her voice was glacial.
###Chapter 482

"It's under my supervision, Miss Roland."

Daniel Murphy's voice hesitated for several seconds before responding over the phone.

"What about her emotional fluctuation records?" Evelyn Roland tapped the armrest absently with her fingertips.

"All logged in the system. Her dietary intake has changed recently, but emotional metrics remain stable."

Evelyn's temple throbbed at his answer. She closed her eyes briefly. "Send them to me immediately."

A flight attendant approached to remind her to power off. She had to hang up abruptly.

As the plane took off, Evelyn stared at the receding cityscape through the window, the muscles in her neck taut with tension.

The emergency at the S City branch had derailed all plans. Three hours later when the plane landed, she turned on her phone to find Daniel's report waiting.

Before she could open it, a call from the regional office came through.

By the time she remembered the report again, it was already too late.

A City. Valdemar Group's executive office.

Sebastian Valdemar studied the experimental data on his screen, his frown deepening. He picked up his phone and opened a message thread that had been silent for a week.

His finger hovered over the screen for a long moment before he finally set it down without typing anything.

"Mr. Valdemar?" Theodore Ashcroft knocked and entered. "Commissioner Galatea requested a meeting this afternoon."

Sebastian's gaze remained fixed on his phone. "Arrange the car."

After the door closed, he pulled out an unopened pack of cigarettes from his drawer.

The lighter's flame illuminated his tense jawline. The cigarette burned slowly between his fingers, untouched.

Only when the ash singed his skin did he snap back to reality, crushing the cigarette violently into the crystal ashtray.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Linton hummed cheerfully on her way to the hospital. Spotting a crowd gathered below the inpatient building, she froze mid-step.

"What's..."

When she recognized the familiar figure on the rooftop, her thermal lunchbox clattered to the ground.

"Melanie!"

Mrs. Linton charged toward the building like a madwoman, only to be blocked by security. Looking up, she saw her daughter take another step forward.

"Don't! Mommy's here!" Her anguished scream dissolved into the noisy crowd.

Someone handed her a megaphone. Mrs. Linton took it with trembling hands. But before she could speak, the figure on the roof suddenly spread her arms—

"Melanie!!"

The piercing shriek tore through the sky. Everyone instinctively held their breath.
###Chapter 483

Some people stay silent out of tolerance.
Some stay silent because they can't be bothered to argue.
And some stay silent simply because they think you're a fool.

But Lin Jinyu believed silence meant surrender.

Humming a cheerful tune, he turned to head back inside to continue playing Plants vs. Zombies.

As he turned, a glint of reflected light caught his eye from the muddy ground. He bent down—it was the rusted nine-linked ring La Long had dropped earlier.

The thing was practically worthless, worth maybe a dollar at most. Yet La Long treasured it, even fearing it might get damaged while skateboarding.

After a brief hesitation, Lin Jinyu picked it up, intending to chase after La Long and return it.

"Where are you going?" Zhang Xinli's voice came from behind.

Ignoring him, Lin Jinyu dashed out the door.

The street was empty—no sign of La Long anywhere. He scanned the surroundings, but there wasn't even anyone to ask for directions.

Just then, an elderly woman wrapped in a headscarf passed by, herding two cows. Lin Jinyu hurried over. "Grandma, did you see some kids pass by? Which way did they go?"

The old woman grinned, revealing sparse teeth. "Rezha, leshi mujulo?"

Lin Jinyu stared blankly.

She patted his shoulder and rattled off more unintelligible words. Frustrated, he raised his voice. "Kids! About this tall!" He gestured wildly.

The woman continued speaking in what sounded like gibberish.

Just as Lin Jinyu was scratching his head in confusion, Zhang Xinli's voice came from behind. "Kashasha."

The old woman chuckled. "Cimogni."

"You speak Yi?" Lin Jinyu asked, surprised.

"Just a few phrases," Zhang Xinli replied. "She said you're handsome."

Lin Jinyu narrowed his eyes skeptically. "Really?"

"Looking for La Long?" Zhang Xinli asked.

Lin Jinyu shook the nine-linked ring. "He dropped this."

Zhang Xinli turned and started walking. "This way. Good thing you found it."

"That important?" Lin Jinyu smirked. "So I just saved the day?"

Zhang Xinli shot him a glance. "Last time he lost it in the sheep pen, he cried for three days searching."

"Seriously?" Lin Jinyu muttered. "It's not even worth anything."

Zhang Xinli paused mid-step. "Maybe not to you."

"Not to anyone."

Zhang Xinli didn't respond, striding ahead. Lin Jinyu hurried after him. "Hey! What did I say wrong?"

Behind them, the old woman waved and called out, "Azazabu!"

......

"This stupid metal ring..." Lin Jinyu grumbled the whole way. "I get the sentimental value, but the material..."

Zhang Xinli ignored him, leading the way in silence.

By 4:30 PM, the village was quiet. As they turned onto a secluded path, Zhang Xinli suddenly stopped.

Lin Jinyu crashed into his back. "Damn it!"

"Shh!" Zhang Xinli signaled for silence.

Ahead, behind a thicket, five or six teenagers stood in a circle, surrounding a small, hunched figure.

"Har wori ni... let go!" A crude curse drifted on the wind.

Lin Jinyu recognized the dirt-streaked face—it was La Long.

Before Zhang Xinli could speak, Lin Jinyu shot forward like an arrow.

"Picking on a kid? Have you no shame?" he barked.

The group froze. One of them swore in dialect.

Lin Jinyu sneered. "Speak properly. I don't understand bird language."

Provoked, one boy lunged to slap him.

At the last second, Zhang Xinli yanked Lin Jinyu back by the collar, barely avoiding the strike.

"Zhang Xinli, stay out of this," the leader threatened.

Lin Jinyu fired back. "You're the bullies, yet you act righteous? Your faces are thicker than a city wall's corner!"

The verbal barrage left them stunned. Zhang Xinli traded curses in dialect while Lin Jinyu switched between languages, hurling insults.

Outmatched, the group began closing in.

Zhang Xinli shielded Lin Jinyu. As tensions peaked, he suddenly grabbed the leader's collar. "Want to fight?" His voice was icy. "Need stitches in your other eye too?"

The leader faltered, then backed down. "Just... a misunderstanding."

La Long whispered, "Let it go..."

Grumbling, the boys dispersed.

Lin Jinyu rushed to La Long. The boy hid behind a tree, face smudged with dirt, a shoe print stamped on his hand—yet not a single tear fell.

"It's okay now," Lin Jinyu said softly.

La Long kept his head down. "Thanks."
###Chapter 484

Daniel and David lifted the unconscious figure from the ground, allowing Sebastian Valdemar to approach.

"Mr. Valdemar, what now?"

Daniel's voice trembled. None of them had anticipated things escalating this way.

Melanie Linton had been improving—why would she suddenly jump? And how had no one noticed when it happened?

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed before he finally spoke. "Have you reached Ms. Roland?"

David checked his phone again. "Still switched off."

A sharp pain lanced through Sebastian's chest, triggering a violent coughing fit. He braced himself against the wall, knuckles whitening.

Theodore Ashcroft hesitated, then silently offered a tissue.

"Give me your phone." Sebastian realized his own was still in the car.

Theodore unlocked his device and handed it over. The screen displayed an active call.

Inside the factory, Evelyn Roland frowned at the unfamiliar caller ID.

"Hello?"

"It's me." Sebastian's voice came through the receiver.

"Mr. Valdemar?"

"Melanie jumped."

Three seconds of silence.

"I'm on my way."

Evelyn hung up and headed straight for the airport. The cleanup in S City could be delegated.

By the time her plane landed in A City, night had fallen.

At arrivals, Theodore hurried forward.

"Melanie's condition is critical. The doctors say she might remain in a vegetative state." He took her luggage. 
###Chapter 485

"Her mother was shaken but unharmed."

"Any leads at the scene?"

"Nothing yet."

The black sedan raced down the highway, pulling into the hospital's underground garage at exactly 10 PM.

At the far end of the ward corridor, a solitary figure stood framed against the window, an unlit cigarette between his fingers.

"Ms. Roland!" Theodore's call echoed down the hallway.

The figure whirled around. Under the fluorescent lights, Sebastian's bloodshot eyes and stubbled jawline were starkly visible.

In just days, he'd become almost unrecognizable.

"Sir, she's here," Theodore reported.

Sebastian said nothing, his gaze locked on Evelyn.

"Where is she?" Evelyn cut straight to the point.

Sebastian's eyes darkened. He turned and led the way without another word.

The two walked toward the ward in silence, Theodore trailing behind them.
The ICU lights were blindingly harsh. Richard Linton hunched over the hospital bed, his bloodshot eyes fixed on the cardiac monitor.

The scent of antiseptic hit Sebastian Valdemar as he pushed the door open. The frail figure on the bed, tangled in tubes, looked like a lifeless doll.

"Dr. Roland!"

Richard jerked his head up, desperation flashing in his clouded eyes. He stumbled forward, his bony fingers clutching Evelyn Roland's white coat.

"You can save her, right? Melanie—she moved her fingers yesterday!"

Evelyn sidestepped his trembling grasp and walked to the bedside. The monitor beeped steadily as she flipped through the thick medical file, pausing on the final page.

"Brainstem damage is irreversible." She closed the file. "Only a miracle can help now."

Richard collapsed to his knees, forehead slamming against the tiles. "Try acupuncture! Ancient remedies! We'll pay anything—"

"Richard!" The door burst open as Margaret Linton rushed in, her IV stand crashing to the floor. She clawed at her daughter's pale face, leaving red marks. "Baby, look at me—"

Sebastian stepped forward, but Evelyn blocked him. Her gaze was icy as she regarded the distraught parents. "I'm not a god."

"You bitch!" Richard grabbed a metal tray and hurled it. "Heartless quack!"

Sebastian shielded Evelyn, the tray's edge slicing his collarbone. Her eyes darkened instantly. She twisted Richard's wrist—

Crack!

A pig-like squeal tore through the room as Richard crumpled. Theodore Ashcroft gasped, watching the sharp swish of Evelyn's coat.

"Take Mr. Valdemar to get bandaged." Her voice was colder than the monitor's alarm.

Margaret's wails cut off. Trembling, she fumbled for her phone. "I—I'm calling the police—"

"Assault carries a three-year sentence." Evelyn stepped on the fruit knife Richard had dropped. "Add armed intent, and it's worse."

The monitor shrieked a flatline. Margaret collapsed as medical staff rushed in. Her scream shattered the air:

"You killed my daughter!"
###Chapter 486

Margaret Linton stared at her husband's limp arm dangling uselessly, tears flooding her eyes instantly.

"You must take full responsibility for my husband's arm too!" Her voice trembled with emotion, yet carried an unyielding edge.

Evelyn Roland arched an eyebrow.

"How much?"

Margaret wiped her tears and held up five fingers.

"Five million?"

"Fifty million!" she declared firmly.

Daniel and David Murphy at the door gasped audibly.

"Fifty million? This is outright robbery!"

Margaret sneered. "What's fifty million to people like you? My daughter is a vegetable now!"

Evelyn's gaze turned icy.

"Take it up with Mr. Valdemar. I opposed this project from the beginning."

"We're holding you responsible!"

Sebastian Valdemar appeared silently in the doorway, his long fingers tapping lightly against the frame.

"Shall I remind you both about the contract terms?"

Margaret became hysterical. "The contract didn't mention anyone dying! My daughter is lying there because of you!"

Suddenly, Evelyn moved.

She advanced step by step toward Richard Linton, who scrambled backward in fear.

A crisp snap echoed through the room.

Richard's limp arm suddenly regained mobility.

"I can fix it, and I can break it again," Evelyn murmured softly.

Richard crawled frantically into a corner.

"Ms. Roland." Sebastian approached.

Though they were still in a cold war, the chill around Evelyn visibly lessened.

"Handle this, Mr. Valdemar."

Seeing the tide turn, Richard started shouting again. "Murderers! Pay up!"

Sebastian's eyes flashed dangerously. "Call the police."

Both Lintons turned ashen.

At that moment, Scarlett Galatea arrived in her stilettos, swaying gracefully.

"Uncle, auntie, what's wrong?" She helped them up gently while shooting a challenging look at Evelyn.

Evelyn leaned lazily against the wall, a mocking smile playing on her lips.
###Chapter 487

"Scarlett!"

Mrs. Linton lunged at Scarlett Galatea the moment she appeared, clutching her sleeve like a lifeline. Tears streamed down her wrinkled face. "Melanie... she jumped from the building. The doctors say she might never wake up..."

Scarlett staggered back, stunned by the news.

"How could this happen?"

"It's all their fault!" Mrs. Linton shrieked hysterically, pointing at Evelyn Roland. "They have to pay! Five million! Not a penny less!"

As Mrs. Linton swayed, Scarlett steadied her. "Auntie, please calm down. Let me handle this."

Turning to Evelyn, Scarlett's eyes gleamed with calculation. "Dr. Roland, I'm grateful you saved my grandmother. But you shouldn't have forced Melanie into that experiment. Now look what's happened—you must take responsibility."

"Forced?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her crimson lips curling. "Miss Galatea, you can swallow nonsense, but don't spit out lies."

A flicker of panic crossed Scarlett's face before she squared her shoulders. She thought her performance flawless, basking in the crowd's attention.

Evelyn didn't even glance her way, instead smirking at Sebastian Valdemar beside her. "Mr. Valdemar, this blame is too heavy for me to carry."

Scarlett paled.

"I was the one who approved Melanie's participation," Sebastian stated coldly.

The words slapped Scarlett like a physical blow. She scanned the room, realizing everyone was staring at her like she was a circus clown.

The clown was her all along.

Blood drained from Scarlett's face as her nails dug into her palms. Her ears rang, her entire body numb.

"Scarlett?" Mrs. Linton tugged her sleeve.

"Miss Galatea." Evelyn's voice was glacial. "After slandering someone, shouldn't you apologize? Throwing away your dignity for a man—the Galatea family's upbringing is truly eye-opening."

The surrounding stares pierced like knives. Scarlett wished the floor would swallow her. Her lips trembled. "I... I'm sorry..."

"Speak up. Did you skip breakfast?" Evelyn sneered.

Scarlett flushed crimson, her voice barely audible. "Miss Roland, I... I was mistaken..."

"Since you care so much about the Lintons," Evelyn pivoted sharply, "why don't you pay the five million? The Galateas are wealthy—consider it charity."

Scarlett froze.

"Don't worry, Auntie," she forced a smile at the Lintons, "Melanie will recover..."

Evelyn scoffed, tapping the wall impatiently. "Enough theatrics. I'm leaving." She paused mid-turn. "Oh, Miss Galatea."

"Next time we meet, change your perfume."

Scarlett looked up, bewildered.

"That green tea bitch scent? Overpowering."
###Chapter 488

Scarlett Galatea's nails dug deep into her palms.

She bit her lower lip hard to stifle the furious scream rising in her throat.

Since childhood, she had been the treasured jewel of the Galatea family. Her parents had never so much as raised their voices at her, let alone humiliated her in public.

Who did Evelyn Roland think she was?

Scarlett stole a glance toward Sebastian Valdemar, only to find his gaze fixed on the retreating figure.

"Stop!"

Mrs. Linton stumbled forward, her voice trembling.

Evelyn paused mid-step without turning. "I'll get to the bottom of Melanie Linton's case," she said coldly before walking away.

Around the corridor corner, Scarlett's shoulders shook slightly.

She heard the crisp snap of her meticulously manicured nails breaking.

"Keep an eye on them."

Sebastian issued the order in a clipped tone before striding after Evelyn.

"Sebastian..."

Scarlett's call dissolved into empty air.

At the hospital entrance, Evelyn was on a phone call. Sebastian followed silently, maintaining a three-step distance.

Theodore Ashcroft hovered between them, wringing his hands.

The tension was thicker than an operating room's silence.

In the parking lot, the moment Evelyn pulled open her car door, Sebastian slid into the passenger seat.

"Your Maybach is parked next door."

Evelyn massaged her temples. The relentless schedule had left her eyes bloodshot.

"Is this how we're speaking now?" Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed, his voice rough.

"Did you enjoy Miss Galatea's performance earlier?"

Evelyn tilted her head, her gaze glacial.

"I'll handle it." Sebastian pulled out his phone. "But could you unblock me first?"

He'd only discovered that morning he'd been blocked for three days.

"As you wish."

With brisk movements, Evelyn tapped her screen and flashed it before him.

"I chose the Lintons because I trust your medical expertise." Sebastian suddenly gripped her wrist. "Theodore and Ruby's cases prove that."

A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn's lips.

"Finished?" She withdrew her hand. "Get out."

In the glow of taillights, Sebastian stood motionless, watching the black SUV disappear.

Three days ago, Evelyn's last message surfaced in his memory:
【I need space】
###Chapter 489

Sebastian Valdemar and Evelyn Roland had barely left the hospital when Scarlett Galatea fled in panic.

Her knuckles turned white around the steering wheel. Evelyn's knowing gaze haunted her. A sudden brake sent tires screeching across asphalt, nearly slamming into the roadside barrier.

"Miss Galatea? You look unwell—"

The housekeeper gasped as Scarlett staggered through the front door. Ignoring her, Scarlett stumbled up the staircase, heels clattering against wooden steps.

The bedroom door slammed shut.

She collapsed onto the bed like a drowning woman clutching driftwood, burying her face in the down comforter. Evelyn's words—"I'll get to the bottom of this"—echoed like a cursed mantra, accelerating her pulse with each repetition.

"It's over..."

Nails dug into her palms as she curled into a fetal position. For the first time in her privileged life, the Galatea heiress tasted the terror of impending doom.

——

At Château Blanc's entrance, Bianca Savigny stood on tiptoe, scanning the road.

"Master!" She sprinted forward to grab the suitcase, eyes sparkling. "Everything settled in S City?"

Evelyn massaged her temples and accepted the offered lemon water. Condensation dripped onto her fingers, triggering a memory of Sebastian's constant warnings about catching cold.

"How's the winery been—"

She cut herself off, noticing Bianca's hesitant expression. Leaning against the bar counter, Evelyn crossed her long legs and tapped the glass rim.

"Speak."

"Mr. Valdemar came daily." Bianca whispered. "Sat in your usual booth for hours."

The ice cubes cracked audibly.

Evelyn straightened, eyes darkening. "What else did he ask?"

"Kept probing about your schedule." Bianca pouted. "I didn't breathe a word!"

The lemon water turned bitter. Evelyn set down the glass, frost crystallizing in her gaze.

"Prepare the car."

"You're leaving right after arriving?" Bianca clutched her sleeve.

"Massachusetts General Hospital." Evelyn unlocked her phone, displaying Melanie Linton's medical records. "Time to settle accounts."

Bianca's eyes darted. "Let me come! I... I want chestnuts from the hospital vendors!"

"Suit yourself."

Evelyn strode toward the exit, her trench coat slicing through the air like a blade. Outside, the blood-red sunset stretched her shadow endlessly across the vineyard.
###Chapter 490

A faint smile played on Evelyn Roland's lips as understanding flashed in her eyes.

This silly girl really thought she couldn't see through her little scheme? Clearly, she was worried about her driving while fatigued.

"Follow me."

Bianca Savigny's eyes lit up, and she trailed behind like an eager puppy.

A black sedan pulled into the Galatea family's gated community.

Victor Galatea was at a dinner engagement when the housekeeper called. Hearing his daughter had returned home acting strangely, he immediately excused himself.

Scarlett Galatea had been sitting rigidly in her room for hours, numb to the pins and needles in her legs. The housekeeper knocked three times, but she didn't respond.

Only the insistent ringing of her phone finally stirred her.

"Hello?"

"Scarlett, come downstairs. Now."

Her father's voice brooked no argument.

The air in the living room was thick enough to choke on.

After dismissing the staff, the sprawling villa held only father and daughter.

"I heard there was an incident with a Starlight Initiative test subject?" Victor had already learned about Melanie Linton's fall and subsequent coma.

His expression darkened. "What the hell happened?"

Scarlett's heart lurched. Her face went pale. "I... I don't know."

Her eyes welled up as her voice trembled. "Dad, I only found out at the hospital. I was home all morning—you can ask Mrs. Lefèvre."

Victor had indeed confirmed this with the housekeeper. His expression softened slightly. "It must have shaken you. Don't worry, I'll investigate personally. The Lintons and Sebastian Valdemar will get answers."

"No!"

Scarlett shot to her feet, knocking over her glass. Scalding water splashed across her foot, drawing a sharp gasp.

"Careful!"

Victor checked quickly—thankfully her shoe had protected her. He poured fresh hot milk and offered it.

"Dad, you can't investigate!" She ignored the drink, shaking her head frantically.

"Why not?"

Years in politics had honed Victor's instincts. His daughter's behavior sent alarm bells ringing. His gaze turned piercing.

"Dad..." Tears suddenly streamed down Scarlett's face as she clutched his sleeve. "Help me... You're all I have."

"Scarlett!" Victor's voice turned sharp. "What did you do?"

His daughter had grown increasingly unrecognizable lately—especially since becoming involved with Sebastian.

"I..."

Her lips moved soundlessly.

"You think this can stay hidden?" Victor's tone turned icy. "Do you know who Evelyn Roland and Sebastian Valdemar are?"

What he didn't know was that Evelyn's car was already speeding toward the hospital—where the truth would soon surface.

###Chapter 491

Scarlett's fingertips trembled.

She knew there was no turning back now.

"I'll talk," she whispered through bitten lips, her voice barely audible.

Tears welled in her eyes but stubbornly refused to fall. She drew a deep breath and recounted everything from beginning to end.

Director Galatea sat on the sofa, his expression dark as storm clouds.

His long fingers tapped rhythmically against the armrest—each tap a hammer blow to Scarlett's heart.

"Dad..." Her voice cracked with unshed tears.

She knew her father too well. This silence was far more terrifying than any outburst.

The Galateas had been in politics for generations. Scandals were their greatest taboo. And this time, she hadn't just crossed her father's line—she might have destroyed the family's reputation entirely.

Thud.

Scarlett's knees hit the floor with a heavy impact.

"I was wrong..." Her forehead pressed against the cold hardwood. "Please... help me."

She couldn't afford to lose her father's protection.

The Lows were insignificant. But if Sebastian Valdemar ever learned the truth...

A violent shiver ran down her spine.

"Get up." Director Galatea finally spoke, his voice glacial.

Scarlett didn't dare move.

"I'll handle the hospital." He rose, looking down at his daughter. "The Lows will be compensated."

Scarlett's head snapped up, hope flashing in her eyes.

"But—" His tone sharpened like a blade. "Starting today, you're grounded for a month."

"What?" she gasped. "But the Valdemar gala—"

"Don't even think about it." His laugh was icy. "Either obey, or clean up your own mess."

Scarlett's nails dug into her palms.

"Hand over your phone." He extended his hand.

Trembling, she surrendered it, watching helplessly as her father dialed a number.

"Joy, I need a favor." Director Galatea's voice regained its usual steadiness. "Yes. Make it disappear."

When the call ended, father and daughter locked eyes.

Scarlett knew the storm had temporarily passed. But the disappointment in her father's gaze—that, she feared, would never fade.
###Chapter 492

Evelyn Roland's car was stuck in traffic on the way to the hospital, the line of vehicles ahead unmoving.

"Boss, looks like an accident up front," Bianca Savigny leaned out the window to check.

Evelyn glanced at her watch, brow slightly furrowed. Time ticked by as her fingers tapped impatiently on the steering wheel.

Half an hour later, the road finally cleared.

In the hospital's surveillance room, the on-duty technician wiped sweat from his brow as he frantically worked the computer.

"That's weird... all the surveillance footage is gone?"

Bianca peered at the screen—only static. "Boss, this..."

Evelyn's eyes darkened, a cold smirk curling her lips. "Interesting."

The technician wrung his hands. "I swear I didn't touch anything! I just dozed off for a second—"

"Save it." Evelyn turned on her heel. "Bianca, let's go."

Bianca hurried after her. "We're just leaving it at that?"

"They beat us to it." Evelyn didn't slow her pace, a glint of steel in her eyes. "Whoever tampered with Valdemar Hospital's systems must have serious backing."

A shadowy figure slipped into an elevator at the end of the corridor.

Meanwhile, in the Galatea family study.

Victor Galatea set down the phone with a triumphant smile. "That little girl thinks she can outplay me?"

"Dad, she actually went to the hospital?" Scarlett Galatea sprang up from the sofa.

"Relax, the surveillance is already wiped clean." Victor narrowed his eyes. "You stay out of trouble for now."

Scarlett pouted, but unease flickered in her gaze.

In the hospital parking lot, Evelyn suddenly stopped.

"Boss?"

"Bianca, check which hospital executives visited today." Her gaze lifted toward the top-floor offices. 
###Chapter 493

"Especially... anyone with unrestricted access to the surveillance room."

Bianca's eyes lit up. "You mean—"

"Daring to mess with Sebastian Valdemar's territory?" Evelyn's laugh was icy. "Let's see who's got the guts."

She pulled out her phone and dialed.

"It's me. I need you to track someone..."
Château Blanc shimmered under the glow of crystal chandeliers, their refracted light dancing across the grand hall.

Evelyn Roland sat poised on the leather sofa, her fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. Bianca Savigny remained silent beside her, while Alexander Roland—usually carefree—knitted his brows in rare concern.

"Evelyn, involving Second Brother would expedite the investigation," Alexander murmured, his voice uncharacteristically grave.

His impromptu visit to the vineyard had coincided with witnessing his sister being framed. That reckless Galatea girl had truly overstepped.

Though Sebastian Valdemar bore the brunt of his ire.

"Second Brother's position makes it inappropriate," Evelyn countered, a sharp glint flashing in her obsidian eyes. "And you will not act rashly either, Alexander."

When he opened his mouth to protest, her silencing glare cut him short.

"I'll request assistance if needed," she stated with finality.

Alexander exhaled in defeat before shifting focus. "Scarlett Galatea is the prime suspect."

"The Galateas have deep political connections," Bianca cautioned softly.

Evelyn traced the edge of the coffee table, her lips curving slightly. "If the Galateas are indeed involved..." Her fingernail scraped the polished surface. "I have countermeasures prepared."

Alexander suddenly ruffled her hair, earning a dagger-like glare.

Meanwhile, darkness enveloped the Valdemar estate.

Moonlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, silhouetting a solitary figure. Sebastian sat slumped against the floor, an empty wine bottle beside him.

"Evelyn..." He tilted his head back, throat working as he drained another glass.

Crimson droplets escaped his lips, tracing a path down his collarbone like bloody tears. Mechanically, he refilled his glass, numb to the alcohol's burn.

After half the bottle vanished, Sebastian staggered upright. His blurred reflection reached for him in the window—and grasped only air.

"Evelyn?" His hoarse call dissolved into the night.

Dawn found him curled on the Persian rug, his pallid features gilded by morning light.

At Valdemar Group's headquarters, Theodore Ashcroft paced the executive floor.

With an international videoconference imminent, Sebastian's unprecedented radio silence sent alarm bells ringing. Fifteen unanswered calls later, Theodore's forehead gleamed with sweat. Yesterday's confrontation replayed in his mind, tightening the knot in his gut.

"Sir, answer your phone!" He stared at the dark screen, dread coiling tighter.
###Chapter 494

The phone screen flickered in the darkness before going completely black.

Theodore Ashcroft stared at the darkened screen, his knuckles turning white. He paced back and forth before finally dialing a number he rarely contacted.

The line rang for what felt like an eternity. Just as he was about to give up, a slightly hoarse female voice answered.

"Miss Roland," Theodore said, his voice tense. "Can you help me reach Mr. Valdemar?"

A brief silence followed.

"He's unreachable?" Evelyn Roland's voice sharpened with sudden alertness.

Theodore relayed the situation in detail. The breathing on the other end of the line grew noticeably heavier.

"Understood."

Evelyn threw off the covers, grabbed her car keys, and rushed out.

"Handle the meeting in my place."

The dial tone echoed in her ears.

When sunlight pierced through the gaps in the curtains, the figure on the floor finally stirred.

Sebastian Valdemar pushed himself up, his vision swimming. A sharp pain in his stomach forced a muffled groan from his lips, the metallic tang of blood blooming on his tongue.

He let out a low, humorless laugh and staggered to his feet.

The doorbell rang.

Assuming it was Olivia, he dragged his heavy limbs toward the entrance.

The electronic lock beeped as the door swung open. Sebastian's vision blurred, and he pitched forward.

Warm hands caught him.

"Evelyn?" The familiar scent of gardenias enveloped him in his haze.

Her fingers barely brushed his forehead before she recoiled. "You drank while running this high a fever?"

In the living room, half a bottle of red wine had spilled onto the carpet, the dark stain resembling dried blood.

Sebastian only smiled, his pallid face flushed with fever. "You came to see me?"

Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails biting into her palms.

"You—"

She took a deep breath, forcibly swallowing her fury.

Thud.

The man collapsed against her shoulder.

Evelyn gritted her teeth. "I must owe you from a past life."

It took every ounce of her strength to maneuver him into the car. In the rearview mirror, Sebastian lay motionless, pale as death.

The sterile scent of disinfectant stung her nostrils.

When Sebastian finally opened his eyes, his throat burned like fire.

"Water."

A glass was pressed to his lips. He drank greedily before focusing on the figure beside the bed—

Theodore Ashcroft gazed down at him with undisguised worry.
###Chapter 495

Sebastian pressed his slender fingers to his temple, his brow furrowed. "Who told you to come?"

His gaze swept the hospital room, landing only on Theodore. He distinctly remembered Evelyn being here—was it another hallucination?

Theodore cleared his throat awkwardly. "Miss Roland had urgent business. She asked me to look after you."

Before he could finish, Sebastian reached for his IV line.

"Sir!" Theodore grabbed his wrist. "The doctor said you need at least 24 more hours of observation."

"Move."

"Miss Roland said..." Theodore steeled himself, "...if you dare discharge yourself without permission, she'll personally come break your legs."

Sebastian froze.

A flicker of emotion crossed his pale face before he slowly withdrew his hand. "What else did she say?"

"To...stop being reckless."

Theodore immediately regretted his words, watching his boss's reaction nervously.

Sebastian merely gave a quiet "Hmm" and lay back on the bed.

Theodore gaped. The mighty CEO of Valdemar Group, tamed by a single sentence?

"Pull the surveillance footage from the day Melanie jumped. Keep it discreet."

"Understood."

Over the next two days, Sebastian and Evelyn pursued separate investigations—both hitting dead ends.

"All footage was deleted?" Evelyn tapped her desk. "What about hospital staff?"

"Questioned them all. Everyone claims they were too busy to notice anything." Her assistant handed her a report. "Even the shift logs were tampered with."

Meanwhile, at Valdemar Group headquarters...

"No leads?" Sebastian's gaze sharpened. "Keep digging."

"Every trail goes cold." Theodore wiped his brow. "It's like...someone scrubbed the scene clean beforehand."

With both investigations stalled, the Lintons grew desperate.

"Why isn't Scarlett answering?" Mrs. Linton clutched her phone, fingers trembling.

Mr. Linton took a drag of his cigarette. "Call again!"

They'd dialed Scarlett's number over a dozen times, sent countless messages—all met with silence.

"Richard..." Mrs. Linton's voice shook. "Have they abandoned us?"

The image of their comatose daughter and mounting medical bills made her vision blur.

"Shut up!" Mr. Linton exploded. "If you hadn't left your post that day, Melanie would never have—"

"My fault?" she shrieked. "That man pressured her into joining that project!"

Mr. Linton opened his mouth, then fell silent.

"We can't just wait to die." Mrs. Linton's eyes hardened. "If they show no mercy, neither will we."
###Chapter 496

Margaret Linton's bony fingers clenched the hospital bed rail, her knuckles turning white.

"We can't wait any longer." Her sandpaper voice scraped against the silence as she stared at her daughter's pale face.

Richard Linton stood by the window, sunlight stretching his shadow across the floor. "What are you planning?"

"Hire internet trolls." Margaret's head snapped up, desperation flashing in her eyes. "We'll blast this onto the trending list."

Richard's thermos clattered to the ground. Scalding water soaked his pants, but he didn't flinch.

"Have you lost your mind?" He hissed. "That's the Valdemar and Roland families!"

A bitter laugh carved deeper lines into Margaret's face. "They forced this. My daughter lies in a hospital bed, and they won't even acknowledge it."

The heart monitor's steady beep was the only sound in the suffocating quiet.

Richard bent to retrieve the thermos, hands trembling. "If this fails—"

"We have nothing left to lose." Margaret cut him off, turning toward the window. "This afternoon."

——

At that same moment, Sebastian Valdemar signed a document in the 32nd-floor conference room of Valdemar Group.

His pen paused mid-stroke as he glanced at the wall clock—12:30.

The trending list exploded.

#StarlightInitiativeScandal rocketed to the top, marked with a glaring "BREAKING" tag.

A video from Buzz Entertainment showed a blurred girl on a hospital bed, captioned: "Heiress Disabled in Human Experiment—Corporations Remain Silent."

Comments flooded in:

"This is inhuman!"
"Launch an investigation!"
"Valdemar and Roland suppressing the truth?"

In the employee lounge, staff huddled around phones, screens illuminating their faces.

"Is this real?"
"Those medical records look authentic..."
"Shh—"

The glass door swung open. Theodore Ashcroft stood framed in the doorway. The air froze.

"What's this?" His gaze swept the group.

A trembling intern extended her phone. "Mr. Ashcroft... we have a situation."

Theodore's temple throbbed as he recognized the hospital room—he'd delivered compensation there last week.

"The Lintons..." He gritted his teeth, punching the intercom. "Mr. Valdemar, we have a problem."

——

By the floor-to-ceiling windows, Sebastian set down his pen. Ice glinted in his eyes. "Suppress it."

"Too late." Theodore watched the view count skyrocket. "They hired professional propagandists."

Sebastian turned, shadows carving his profile. "Find out who's behind this."

——

Chaos engulfed Roland Corporation's PR department.

Alexander Roland studied the spiking crisis metrics on the screen, a cold smile curling his lips.

"Interesting." He pressed the intercom. "Contact Valdemar. Tell him—the game begins."

——

In the hospital room, Margaret traced her daughter's cheek as shares multiplied on her screen.

"Don't worry," she whispered. "Mommy will get justice for you."
###Chapter 497

Bianca Savigny paced back and forth across the wine cellar, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead.

"Has anyone seen Evelyn?"

She stopped a passing waiter, her voice thick with urgency.

"Miss Roland? I think she went toward the wine cellar."

Before the waiter could finish, Bianca was already sprinting in that direction.

At the corner, she nearly collided with Evelyn Roland, who had just emerged from the cellar.

"Evelyn! It's an emergency!"

Bianca grabbed Evelyn's arm, her fingers trembling slightly.

Evelyn frowned and calmly withdrew her arm.

"Another social media scandal?"

Her tone was as casual as if she were discussing the weather.

"It's about Melanie Linton's suicide! The whole internet is accusing the Starlight Initiative of profiting from tragedy!"

Bianca stomped her foot in frustration and shoved her phone into Evelyn's hands.

The screen was flooded with vicious comments and accusations.

Evelyn scrolled through the vile remarks, her expression growing colder by the second.

"Evelyn, even though your name isn't directly mentioned in the trending topics—"

"I know."

Evelyn cut her off, handed the phone back, and turned toward her office.

At the same moment, the atmosphere in the lab was equally tense.

Daniel and David Murphy rushed in, their faces pale.

"Sebastian, we have a problem!"

Seeing Sebastian Valdemar present, they visibly relaxed.

Zachary Merouin leaned in curiously. "What's going on?"

Sebastian took the phone and quickly scanned the screen.

His face remained impassive, but his knuckles turned white.

"Sebastian?"

Daniel spoke cautiously.

"Stay in the lab. Don't go outside."

Sebastian's voice was icy.

Zachary finally glimpsed the phone's contents and frowned. "Someone's clearly manipulating public opinion."

"I'll handle it."

Sebastian tossed the phone back to Daniel and walked to the window.

Zachary followed. "Need any help?"

"No."

The refusal was crisp and final.

Sunlight streamed through the window but couldn't penetrate the darkness in Sebastian's eyes.

Knowing his friend's temperament, Zachary didn't press further. He simply patted Sebastian's shoulder.

"I'm here if you need me."

The lab fell into an eerie silence, broken only by the faint hum of machinery.
###Chapter 498

The glass door of the laboratory slid shut with a whisper. Sebastian Valdemar stood frozen in the corridor, his fingertips trembling imperceptibly.

Now he understood why Evelyn Roland had been so adamant about keeping Melanie Linton's family away from the project.

An invisible weight crushed his chest, making each breath a struggle.

His phone burned against his palm. Without hesitation, he dialed the familiar number.

On the terrace of Château Blanc, Evelyn's phone vibrated against the glass coffee table.

"Evelyn? Where are you?"

Sebastian's voice carried an urgency she'd never heard before.

"The winery."

Her reply was clipped, almost icy.

"Wait for me."

His Adam's apple bobbed as a thousand words condensed into those two.

When the call ended, the master and apprentice exchanged puzzled glances across the wine barrels.

The elevator doors hadn't fully opened in the underground parking garage when camera flashes erupted like a thunderstorm.

"Mr. Valdemar! Care to comment on the wrongful death lawsuit against the Starlight Initiative?"

"Is it true Melanie Linton became vegetative after jumping from a building?"

"Is Valdemar Group sacrificing patients for stock gains?"

Reporters swarmed like sharks scenting blood, microphones jabbing toward Sebastian's face.

"Did Miss Roland really refuse to save a life?"

Sebastian froze mid-step.

When he turned, the glacial look in his eyes dropped the temperature of the entire garage.

"Chill Media?"

His slender finger tapped the reporter's press badge, his tone deceptively light.

"Last March, your fabricated story about that college student's suicide."

"May, your malicious editing drove an influencer to take her own life."

With each word, the reporter's face grew paler.

"Shall I continue recounting your journalistic achievements?"

Sebastian's gaze swept across the crowd. Representatives from several major outlets began edging backward.

"News Express and your fake medicine advertisements."

"Buzz Entertainment's predatory student loan schemes."

The shutter clicks faded, replaced by nervous gulps.

Standing at the center of the spotlight, Sebastian's lips curved into a smile devoid of warmth.
###Chapter 499

The courtyard was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

Every gaze was fixed on Ye Tian. The air thrummed with anticipation and reverence. This young alchemist had already established unshakable authority in their hearts.

Ye Tian stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his robes fluttering without wind.

"Since you've chosen to remain in Alchemy City, I trust you all uphold the original purpose of healing the world." His voice was measured, each word striking like a hammer.

The words acted like a key, unlocking long-buried memories in the physicians present. The oaths they'd sworn when first picking up their medicine chests, the late nights spent poring over medical texts—all came rushing back, making their hearts pound anew.

A faint stir rippled through the crowd. Anyone could see this rising Alchemy City would become a force to be reckoned with in the martial world.

"But saving lives requires rules." Ye Tian raised his index finger. "The wicked and depraved—will not be treated!"

A second finger joined the first. "Those who come seeking trouble—will not be treated!"

When the third finger lifted, his voice turned icy. "Those attempting to defy the heavens and alter fate—will not be treated!"

Ji Bochang slammed the table and shot to his feet. "Alchemist Ye, these are outrageous claims! Who decides who deserves treatment and who doesn't?"

Ye Tian's eyes glinted with frost.

"Grandmaster Ji, your eagerness suggests you count yourself among the wicked?" A cold smile played on his lips. "The rules of Alchemy City aren't finished, yet you're already rushing to dictate terms?"

Ji Bochang's face darkened with rage. "How dare you!"

"Final warning." Ye Tian's voice could have frozen hell. "Either sit quietly, or get out of Alchemy City. If you want a fight, I'm ready anytime."

Tension crackled in the air like drawn blades.

Sang Xi hurried to mediate. "Grandmaster, please calm down. Alchemist Ye will surely explain—"

But Ye Tian had already turned back to address the physicians. "Those of Alchemy City may introduce themselves by name or simply as disciples of this city."

He paused, eyes flashing. "But oppression of patients is forbidden. No one may arbitrarily raise treatment fees. However—"

The pause made every ear strain forward.

"If the powerful try to bully you, there's no need to grovel." His words were a shot of courage straight to the heart. "Disciples of Alchemy City will never bow their heads!"

A murmur of awe spread through the crowd. Years of humiliation under the thumb of the privileged finally had an outlet.

"Two more rules." Ye Tian raised his fingers again. "First, anyone who dares provoke Alchemy City will be executed without mercy. Second, harm one of ours, and you face the entire city."

Leng Ningshuang couldn't help asking, "City Lord Ye, does this mean cutting ties with the Martial Alliance?"

Every eye locked onto Ye Tian.

"What?" He smirked. "Are you all complaining Alchemy City has too few rules and want to follow someone else's instead?"

The words landed like thunder.

Ji Bochang could no longer contain himself. "Arrogant fool! You'd make enemies of the entire martial world?"

Before the last syllable faded, he blurred into motion, a ghostly streak aimed straight at Ye Tian.

Lu Feng moved to intercept, but Ye Tian raised a hand. "Brother, stand down. Since the Grandmaster insists on seeing Alchemy City's power..."

With a flick of his sleeve, a massive formation diagram materialized above the city. A gale erupted as several pills in Ye Tian's palm disintegrated into powder.

The medicinal dust swirled on the wind. Before the Martial Alliance members could react, they toppled like wheat before a scythe.

Silence swallowed the courtyard whole.
###Chapter 500

Sebastian's pupils contracted violently, a brilliant light bursting from their depths. The boulder that had long weighed on his chest shattered into pieces.

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, slender fingers pressing against the nape of her neck. "Mr. Valdemar, my cervical spine is bothering me."

The man immediately understood, striding toward the sofa.

"Evelyn, I'm sorry—"

A light cough cut Sebastian off, his pale face growing even more fragile.

Evelyn raised a hand to stop him. "No more apologies. But if this happens again, our relationship ends here."

"I promise." Sebastian grasped her hand urgently. "I'll tell you anything you want to know."

She let him hold her hand but abruptly changed the subject. "We've hit a wall in the investigation."

Sebastian's expression darkened. His own investigators had come up empty-handed—this was no coincidence.

"There's only one way left to uncover the truth about Melanie's fall."

Their eyes met, both realizing they needed to shift their approach.

"Do you know Scarlett?" Evelyn's gaze deepened. "And the Galatea family?"

Sebastian studied her serious expression. "I'll find out."

Scarlett was indeed the most unusual member of the project team.

"Whether she's involved or not, we must proceed carefully." Evelyn spoke rapidly. "Whoever we're up against has powerful connections. We can't afford mistakes."

Sebastian gave a grim nod.

Meanwhile, online outrage continued to escalate. The Starlight Initiative was thrust into the spotlight, with even the official A-city account weighing in on the high-profile case.

The social media servers crashed three times in a single day.

Scarlett paced her bedroom, restless without her electronic devices.

"Auntie, just five minutes with my phone, please?"

Seizing the moment while her father was away, she wheedled the housekeeper relentlessly.

"Your father will fire me if he finds out..." The woman hesitated.

"Just five minutes!" Scarlett blinked tearfully, playing the spoiled child.

The housekeeper finally relented, handing over the phone. "Don't let him see you."

Scarlett's fingers trembled as she logged in. The trending list blazed with hashtags:

#StarlightInitiativeScandal
#ValdemarGroupBloodMoney
#ShutDownTheCorporation

Her hands turned icy. Each headline stabbed like a knife.

"How did things come to this?"

Scarlett collapsed to the floor, the phone slipping from her grasp.
