### chapter1 

I've been losing lingerie frequently lately.
Since I got off work early today, I bought two new pieces.
I just returned home and noticed my brother's door was slightly ajar.
As I approached, I could clearly hear strange noises.
What was he doing?
I tiptoed closer, intending to startle him.
The nearer I got, the more suppressed the sounds became.
I peered through the crack in the door.
He sat upright at his desk, his computer displaying a photograph.
I set down my new lingerie and rose on my toes to see the picture clearly.
The subject of the photo was me.
It was a boudoir photoshoot my best friend had convinced me to do.
My face flushed crimson with embarrassment.
I felt completely flustered.
Looking closer, I noticed the black fabric in his hand seemed familiar.
But the angle prevented me from seeing it clearly.
I gently pushed the door open a little wider.
Now I could see it clearly.
He was holding my lingerie.
I nearly fainted.
It was the very piece I had been missing for three days.
And nestled within the black lace lingerie was something that made me blush fiercely.
He suddenly stopped.
I thought I had been discovered.
I quickly covered my mouth, frozen in place behind the door.
After a long moment, I heard no further movement from him.
I cautiously peeked again to see what he was doing now.
The lingerie had been set aside.
He was now lying on his bed, eyes half-closed.
I couldn't comprehend why he would act this way.
Dizzy and disoriented, I grabbed my new lingerie and rushed back to my room.
I tore open the packaging.
Now I regretted buying this particular style.
I buried my face in my pillow, my entire body trembling uncontrollably.
My mind began to race with wild thoughts.
Ethan Lowell and I share no blood relation.
Three months ago, my mother Charlotte married his father William Lowell.
William treats my mother exceptionally well.
So well that he resigned from his job to travel the world with her.
They haven't been home in a long time.
Now it's just Ethan and me in the house.
I racked my brains but couldn't understand why he would do such a thing.
There's no telling when my mother and William will return.
Could Ethan restrain himself from making a move on me?
After some thought, I decided to avoid facing him at home.
I went out to find my best friend.
That night, every time I closed my eyes, that scene replayed in my mind.
I tossed and turned until very late before finally falling asleep.


### Chapter 2

The next morning, I was sleeping soundly when I felt a tickling sensation on my leg.
I didn't think much of it until suddenly, I was pulled into someone's arms and lifted up.
The sudden feeling of being suspended in mid-air jolted me awake.
"Ah! Help!" I cried out in alarm.
Ethan Lowell looked at me and smiled gently, then set me back down.
"Time to get up. I've already made breakfast. I was going to carry you over to eat," he said.
My face instantly flushed bright red.
After finishing breakfast, my brother brought out a bag.
"Victoria, I bought you some new lingerie. You mentioned a few days ago that you couldn't find yours," he said.
I went back to my room and looked inside the bag.
It was a black lace lingerie set, similar to the one from yesterday, but far, far more seductive.
I imagined the scene of wearing this lingerie for Ethan.
Amid my shyness, a strange sense of anticipation rose within me.
Ethan was tall, handsome, and highly capable.
Being able to win over a man like him would prove my unique charm.
What girl hasn't dreamed of marrying a prince someday?
I was no exception.
I had always felt that if there was anyone who could be called a prince, it was Ethan.
I never met my father.
When my mother was pregnant, he went out to seek his fortune but never returned home.
When I was six, the police brought back a body.
My mother confirmed it was my father's.
She was utterly devastated and cried all day long.
But looking at me, her helpless child, she gritted her teeth and resolved to raise me.
Yet, deep down, she always longed for someone to lean on.
I knew my mother sometimes cried in secret.
They say motherhood makes you strong.
So, my mother probably didn't want anyone to know about her struggles.
I always pretended not to know.
But my heart ached for her.
I always hoped she could let go of my father and pursue her own happiness.
The year I graduated from college, my wish came true.
My mother met William Lowell, who was in a similar situation.
They fell in love quickly.
After getting consent from me and Ethan, they promptly obtained their marriage certificate.
Then they resigned from their jobs and set off to travel the world.
Since Ethan and I became family, he had always taken meticulous care of me.
He fulfilled all my fantasies of an ideal older brother—gentle, considerate, tall, and handsome.
So, I had always liked this brother quite a bit.
Not in a sibling way.
I had even wondered—if my mother hadn't remarried, could I have become Ethan's girlfriend?
But what happened yesterday truly left me at a loss.
Because of my mother's situation, I had never been in a relationship.
But I had plenty of flirtatious girlfriends.
They not only had solid theoretical knowledge but also rich practical experience.
I had heard my fair share of risqué jokes!
I understood that adult men have such needs; it's normal.
But him acting like this—how was I supposed to face him from now on?
Heaven knows, every time I see him, my face gets hot enough to fry an egg.


### Chapter 3


I rubbed my aching face.

Ethan had bought matching sets, including both bras and panties.

Perhaps I took too long trying them on.

Ethan grew impatient waiting outside.

A knock came at the door. "Victoria, are you done? Does everything fit?"

I hurriedly dressed and opened the door.

Glancing at the lingerie Ethan bought, I thought for a moment.

I put on a white blouse over it.

"They fit perfectly. Thank you, Ethan."

Ethan's expression darkened when he saw me.

He handed me a glass of juice. "Pomegranate juice. Freshly squeezed. Drink it now, then get some rest. Those dark circles under your eyes show you didn't sleep well last night."

I nodded and drank the juice in one gulp.

Maybe the recent stress had gotten to me.

Or perhaps the gloomy weather made it perfect for sleeping.

As I relaxed, overwhelming drowsiness set in.

My eyelids grew heavier and heavier.

They say we dream of what occupies our thoughts all day.

In my hazy dream, Ethan wasn't my stepbrother.

From the moment we met, he pursued me relentlessly.

I pretended to be aloof, playing hard to get.

But under Ethan's intense courtship, I quickly surrendered.

My mother gently took my hand and placed it in Ethan's.

Our wedding night was precious and fleeting.

Ethan took my hand and never let go.

When I woke up, it took me a while to regain full awareness.

Strangely, my body felt tingly and sensitive.

It was as if that wild dream had been real.

Feeling a urgent need to pee, I tried to get up.

My legs gave way, and I collapsed back onto the bed.

"Oh!" I gasped, finally processing what I had dreamed.

My face flushed with embarrassment.

How could I have such a dream about my own stepbrother?

I rushed to the bathroom in a panic.

I needed to clean away the evidence of my shameful dream.

I wanted to erase any trace of my improper thoughts.

Then I noticed the lingerie I changed out of yesterday was missing again.

I pursed my lips. Ethan must have taken it.

Remembering what I saw yesterday, I gritted my teeth.

I slipped quietly into Ethan's room.

After looking around, I confirmed he wasn't there.

He was probably out jogging.

This was strange. Ethan definitely took the lingerie.

But where would he keep it?

I searched every corner of his room.

Under his pillow, I only found the piece he took yesterday.

I had lost eight pieces in total, including this one.

But only one was here.

Where could he have hidden the others?

Just as I prepared to search again, frustrated, footsteps suddenly approached.


### Chapter 4
Oh no.
Ethan was back.
I looked down at myself, wearing only lingerie.
Panic seized me.

In my fluster, I squeezed under Ethan's desk.
I pulled the movable cabinet in front of me.
But why was the back of it hollow?

Footsteps drew nearer.
Ignoring the cold bite of metal against my skin, I curled into a tight ball.
Please don't let him find me.

The door opened.
Ethan had just finished exercising.
His breathing was ragged, tired.

He gasped for air, pulling my lingerie from under his pillow.
Humiliation and anger burned through me.
He was starting again.

Sure enough, he pressed my lingerie to his face.
He took a deep, lingering breath.

I clamped a hand over my mouth, fighting the urge to strangle him.
He was using my lingerie to wipe his sweat.

Things grew stranger.
He pulled out another red fabric.
He dragged the chair out and sat at the desk.

"Victoria... so sweet, Victoria..."

I don't know how much time passed before Ethan left, satisfied.
Was this what my best friend meant by "the end"?

She said women tend to linger in the aftermath.
That men usually stay to comfort them.

A bitter smile touched my lips.
In this situation, I was the only one suffering.

I couldn't help but wonder.
If Ethan really did make a move on me... would he comfort me afterward?

My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of shower spray from the bathroom.

Ethan had a great body.
Defined abs, that V-line.
I imagined water dancing over his muscles.
My body reacted to the memory of his masculine presence.

The thoughts made me flush with shame.
I peeked out cautiously.
I crept from my hiding spot.

My foot caught on a power cord.
Numb from crouching so long, my legs gave way.
I fell face-first.

My cheek smeared against the red and white on the stool.
It was slick with milk.
I wiped it with my hand.
Soft. Smooth.

The water stopped.
Terrified of being discovered, I scrambled back to my room on silent feet.

After washing my face, I buried myself in the soft mattress.
Finally, I could relax.
But my pounding heart refused to quiet.
It kept reminding me of what had just happened.


### Chapter 5

I stared at the star-shaped lights on the ceiling, twinkling brilliantly.

The sunlight outside was bright, yet it couldn't dim these lights. Instead, it made them shine even more radiantly.

Ethan had bought these lights for me. William had installed them.

I had never experienced a father's love growing up.

Ethan's presence became a beacon of light in my life.

Though he was only my stepbrother, I sometimes sensed a paternal warmth from him.

From the moment I first saw Ethan, I thought: if Mom hadn't married William, perhaps Ethan and I could be together.

But Mom had suffered so much for my sake. I couldn't be selfish.

Yet, what if Ethan made the first move?

He took my clothes to do... that. He must feel something for me.

My inner turmoil raged as these chaotic thoughts swirled.

Ethan's voice came through the door.

"Victoria, are you awake?"

I frantically wrapped myself tighter in the blankets.

Cold sweat trickled down my back.

I pretended to still be asleep.

Ethan pushed the door open and entered slowly.

His footsteps echoed, tap-tap-tapping as if walking directly on my heart.

I struggled to relax my facial expression, feigning deep sleep.

Then a broad, soft hand pressed against my forehead.

"Why are you so feverish? Do you have a temperature?"

Hearing this, I couldn't maintain the act any longer.

I slowly opened my eyes, mimicking someone just waking up.

I rubbed my eyes, suppressing my inner panic.

"Brother, what brings you here? It's so warm. Did we forget to turn on the AC?"

Ethan glanced toward the air conditioner and nodded.

"No wonder you're so warm. The AC is off."

He walked over and switched it on.

I breathed a heavy sigh of relief. I had managed to bluff my way through.

Ethan came back and ruffled my hair.

"Get up now. Any more sleep and you won't be able to sleep tonight."

Looking at his distinct, bony fingers, I remembered how they had handled my lingerie.

I couldn't help but nuzzle against his hand.

"Okay."

He smiled slightly.

"Lazy cat. I picked out a movie. Come watch with me."

When I went out, Ethan was drinking milk.

He handed me a glass as well.

Watching him enjoy his drink, my mind wandered to that red stained with white.

Flustered, I took the glass and gulped it down.

I wondered if this milk tasted better, or that milk would...

According to what my best friend described, perhaps that one would be richer.

Seeing me drink, Ethan's expression flickered with something unreadable.

He told me to sit properly and took the glass to clean up.

The movie had already started.

My mind remained fixated on the 'milk,' my heart burning as if on fire.

I had no focus for the film.

As I sat there lost in thought, a wave of drowsiness washed over me.

My eyelids grew heavier and heavier.

Ethan hadn't even returned yet, and I was already asleep.

In my hazy state, I seemed to drift into another absurd dream.

In the dream, Ethan carried me to his bed.

He tenderly called me "baby" and asked me to call him "husband."

He held me tightly, as if wanting to fuse me into his very bones.

I watched Ethan's wild passion, feeling him conquer my body.

I couldn't help but respond, holding him back, following his lead.

We became intimately connected, never to part.


### Chapter 6

I woke up again at half past eleven at night.

I stared at the time on my phone.

This shouldn't be happening.

There was no way I had been awake for more than three hours today.

Most importantly, my body ached as if it had been run over by a truck.

It was sore and painful, yet with a strange sense of satisfaction.

A burning pain throbbed between my legs.

Gritting my teeth against the soreness, I looked down.

How could it be so red and swollen?

I was utterly baffled.

The exhaustion washing over me made me wonder if some succubus had drained my energy.

I slowly moved to the wardrobe to get clothes.

The full-length mirror beside it made my hair stand on end.

My buttocks were covered densely with hickeys!

There was only one explanation for this.

I had been taken.

But the only other person in this house was Ethan Lowell.

I slapped my forehead in frustration.

That dream might not have been a dream at all.

My stepbrother had made his move on me.

I laughed in angry disbelief.

Was he only brave enough to leave marks where I wouldn't easily see?

Covering my flushed cheeks, I cursed Ethan under my breath.

Really, did he have to use such underhanded methods?

Couldn't he just ask for my consent?

But if he had asked, would I have agreed?

I think I would have.

Ethan fulfilled all my fantasies about men.

He filled the void left by my absent father.

Since he didn't dare face me directly, I would play along and catch him in the act.

Maybe then he would find the courage to confront our relationship.

After all, we weren't related by blood.

Mom and William Lowell wouldn't be back anytime soon.

As these thoughts swirled, waves of exhaustion washed over me.

I fell asleep filled with determination.

The next morning, there was the usual glass of juice.

Remembering yesterday's events, I knew drinking this would leave me at his mercy.

With nervous hands, I poured the juice into my room's potted plant.

I was grateful for my habit of keeping plants in my bedroom.

Ethan came in and saw the empty glass.

He nodded with satisfaction.

"Seeing it empty makes you happy?" I teased.

He stiffened briefly but quickly recovered.

"Yes. I squeezed it myself. You drinking it all means it tasted good."

I rolled my eyes internally but kept my expression neutral.

I nodded, pretending to believe him.

"Okay then."

He hurried out, his steps unsteady.

It was clearly a frantic escape.

I couldn't help a muffled laugh, quickly covering my mouth.

Lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling.

I waited boredly for him to make his move.

The door opened softly.

Suddenly I felt nervous.

As his familiar footsteps drew closer, my heartbeat spiraled out of control.

Perhaps because my eyes were closed, my hearing seemed amplified.

Listening to his increasingly ragged breathing, I swallowed nervously.

He seemed to be assessing my state.

I tried to relax my face, but my heart raced uncontrollably.

The room fell silent, making my pounding heart deafening.

Just as I grew accustomed to his gaze and less tense, he finally moved.

Cool air brushed my skin as my pajamas were removed.

He pulled me into his embrace, warming me with his heated body.

I knew what was coming next.

My best friend had described this scenario to me many times.

I couldn't help feeling excited.

Ethan's unique scent filled my nostrils.

His masculine hormones seemed to rush into my body.

Soon, I felt like a small boat adrift on Ethan's vast ocean.

Rising and falling with the tides, I forgot all about exposing him.

I was intoxicated by Ethan from the very beginning.

Slowly, I lost consciousness.


### Chapter 7

I woke again, frustrated, and punched the mattress.

But I could still feel Ethan’s presence vividly, and my heart swelled with sweetness.

After that night, though, a long time passed without him touching me again.

I missed him terribly.

But I hadn’t been honest with him before. Would it be awkward to approach him now?

My heart was a tangled mess.

For days, I was filled with longing and disappointment.

I had to admit—my feelings for Ethan weren’t pure.

Even though I called him “brother,” I kept imagining calling him something else.

What should I do?

I started to resent him a little.

Was I not his type?

Why didn’t he want to share that pleasure with me again?

I didn’t dare tell even my closest friend.

I bore the punishment of my own cowardice alone.

A week later, I received an international call.

It was from Mom.

She and William were coming home.

I bounced excitedly on my soft bed.

Joy swept over me like a fresh breeze, clearing away the dark clouds over my head.

I missed my mother so much.

Since I could remember, I had never been apart from her for this long.

But then, anxiety crept in.

Ethan had already been distant for so long.

Once Mom and William returned, would he drift even further away?

The missing lingerie reminded me he still cared.

But his absence left me tangled in doubt and heartache.

The excitement of seeing Mom clashed with the pain of Ethan’s silence.

It was tearing me apart.

I felt like I was going insane.

On the day of Mom’s return, I freshened up and went to the airport.

Since I hadn’t been sleeping well, I applied a careful layer of makeup.

Waiting felt endless.

Long waits can bring disappointment, crush hope, and plunge you into despair.

My makeup had smudged, and Mom still hadn’t arrived.

I didn’t know what to do.

When Ethan called for the seventh time to ask if they’d landed, I broke down.

Tears choking my voice, I told him they weren’t here yet.

I was terrified something had happened.

Ethan dropped everything and rushed to the airport.

He sensed something was wrong.

He found me sitting alone on a bench in the waiting area, looking lost.

He wrapped his arms around me gently.

“It’s okay. I’m here.”

I’d been sitting in the cold all day.

His warmth brought me back to myself.

I clung to him and sobbed.

“Victoria, what’s wrong?” he asked, confused by my tears.

“Ethan… Mom and William… they’re gone.”

The deepest grief isn’t loud—it’s when the pain steals your breath.

Trembling, I handed him my phone.

The news was devastating.

An avalanche in the Alps.

Nine dead, thirty-three injured.

Mom and William were among the nine.

Then a fire broke out in the disaster area.

No new casualties, but all nine bodies were burned to ashes.

I had lost my mother.

I couldn’t even see her one last time.

The thought echoed in my mind.

My only family was gone.

Ethan stared at my phone in disbelief.

He gripped my hand tightly.

“Victoria, are you joking?” he demanded, voice rising.

I didn’t know how to answer.

I sat numbly as he shook me.

My head throbbed, as if invaded by a virus.

So this is what it feels like when your world collapses.

That was my last thought before everything went black.


### Chapter 8

When I woke, Ethan was no longer his usual gentle and handsome self.

He was unshaven and utterly disheveled.

Thinking of Mother, my heart ached so fiercely I nearly fainted.

Yet a sliver of hope remained.

I looked at Ethan with desperate expectation.

"Brother, has Mother come home?"

Ethan nodded.

Tears of joy streamed down my face.

So it really was just a dream?

Mother had returned!

But if she was back, why hadn't she come to see me?

I struggled to rise, my body weak and feeble, determined to find Mother.

Ethan quickly held me down. "Victoria, what are you doing? Lie down!"

"Where is Mother? Why hasn't she come to me?"

I choked back tears, still trying to sit up.

But my powerless body was pinned firmly, unable to move.

Ethan's eyes reddened.

He growled at me in a low voice, "Victoria Roscente, snap out of it! Aunt Charlotte and Dad are gone. They're gone! They're sleeping forever beneath the Alps!"

"But you said they came home..."

I collapsed back onto the bed in despair.

The hospital's snow-white walls felt like they were smothering me, suffocating me.

How much agony had Mother endured in that moment?

Ethan grasped my hand.

His hands were no longer warm.

A damp chill clung to his palms, cold as snow.

His voice trembled as he spoke. "Victoria, my father had been to the Alps once before. I believe he brought Aunt Charlotte home."

I wept silently, ignoring Ethan, as if detached from the world.

Ethan sighed softly and drew me into his embrace.

He made a solemn promise. "Victoria, I will always be here."

I sobbed uncontrollably.

Tears wouldn't stop.

My throat and chest felt ready to burst.

Scalding tears flowed incessantly, like a leaky faucet.

It was as if I needed to pour out all the grief and sorrow in my heart.

I was lost in the pain of losing my mother, unable to free myself.

Clutching old photographs of her, I was consumed by anguish.

Every day I forced myself to sleep.

Because only in dreams would Mother visit me.

Just like when I was a child, she would softly sing to me, take me out for fried chicken, to watch movies...

Ethan cared for me diligently every day, comforting me with gentle words.

A month later, it seemed Ethan had moved past this catastrophe.

My lingerie began disappearing again.

I had no energy to confront him about it.

But his hands grew increasingly restless.


### Chapter 9

Once again when I woke up, he effortlessly pulled me into his embrace.
He pressed my head against his shoulder, his hand resting on my waist.
He gave my waist a natural squeeze. "Victoria, you haven't had a proper meal this entire month."
"You're wasting away, don't you see that?"
I remained silent, unresponsive.
This was my way of refusing to communicate.
Ethan let out a deep sigh and ruffled my hair. "Sweetheart, Charlotte would be heartbroken."
"She would want you to live well."
I understood the logic perfectly.
But I truly had no appetite.
In fact, I was terrified of anything white.
It all felt like an overwhelming blizzard that could crush a person.
I missed Mother so much.
She must miss me too...
Seeing my lifeless state, Ethan grew genuinely angry.
His hands clenched tightly, trembling slightly.
His chest heaved with violent breaths.
"Victoria Roscente, listen to me."
"They're gone, but you're still alive."
"This self-destructive behavior is destroying both you and me."
"It's been forty-eight days. That's enough!"
His words struck me like a sudden revelation.
He was right. I was still alive.
Ethan was still here.
I still had Ethan.
I clung to him fiercely, as if grabbing my last lifeline.
"Ethan, I really, really miss Mother..."
Ethan held me close, his voice choked with tears.
"I miss Father too... I miss him so much..."
I wanted to wipe away his tears.
But he held me so tightly I couldn't move.
His sobs grew louder.
My back grew damp, soaked through.
I had been too selfish.
I had lost my mother, but Ethan had lost his father.
While I wallowed in despair, he had to hide his own grief while comforting me.
I gently patted his back and made a promise. "Ethan, I won't be like this anymore."
"You're right. Mother would want me to live well."
"Good." His crying gradually subsided.
He rested his forehead against my shoulder, his steady voice tinged with a nasal tone. "We'll do it together. We'll be okay."
I reached over and pulled a tissue from the box.
I handed it to Ethan.
He noticed my damp shirt and blushed crimson.
"Get some rest," he mumbled, grabbing the tissue before fleeing in embarrassment.
Watching his flustered retreat, I smiled faintly.
Ethan, we both need to live well from now on...


### Chapter 10

I gradually emerged from that shadow.

My soul learned to smile again after enduring pain.

Come to think of it, hadn't I already started getting used to life without Mom when she married William Lowell?

Was I overthinking, or was Ethan Lowell spending more and more time away recently?

Business trips had become routine for him.

I couldn't help but panic.

Had Ethan found a better replacement?

I was bored at work, wondering when Ethan would return from his business trip.

If the mountain won't come to me, I'll go to the mountain.

Given our current situation, he wasn't really my brother anymore.

"Victoria, the boss wants to see you." A colleague interrupted my thoughts.

I nodded and walked toward the boss's office.

Inside, the boss narrowed his eyes and scanned my impressive chest and full hips.

"Victoria, close the door."

I felt puzzled but obediently closed it.

The boss was tall and burly with a crew cut.

He was known for his harsh criticism.

Facing him directly made me uneasy.

Seeing me standing still, he stood up and pressed me into a chair.

"Relax, it's nothing serious." He patted my shoulder.

His large hand casually rubbed my back.

I felt scared and subtly shifted backward, trying to create distance.

He smiled faintly and pulled me into his embrace.

"Be good, I've been dreaming about these white rabbits for a long time."

I struggled but fell into his arms.

Trembling, I tried to stand up, but couldn't break free from his iron-like grip.

I knew showing fear would only provoke his animal instincts.

I kept my voice steady. "Boss, what are you trying to do?"

He ignored my question and lightly slapped my hip.

"Don't call me boss. I'm not much older than you. Call me Ryan."

I pressed my lips together, unsure how to respond.

He didn't seem to care.

"I heard your mother recently passed away. It must be tough for a young girl alone."

"This job is quite desirable out there."

He was threatening me!

It was true. With Mom gone, I was alone...

Wait, I still had Ethan. I wasn't alone!

But Ethan couldn't support me.

Without Mom as connection, what were we?

Probably just friends.

I regretted my carelessness.

I'd heard rumors about this boss's inappropriate behavior.

Yet I walked right into his office.

This was like a lamb entering a tiger's den!

I wanted to cry but had no tears.

Ethan, please come save me.

Seeing my resistance weaken, the boss smiled happily.

"That's more like it. People need to be sensible."

But if I compromised, would Ethan still want me?

The answer was clear. Definitely not!

An idea came to mind.
