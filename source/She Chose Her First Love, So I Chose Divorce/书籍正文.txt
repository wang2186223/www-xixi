###Chapter 1

On the night of our third anniversary, my wife orchestrated a drone light show for her first love.

In the night sky, five hundred drones lit up simultaneously, forming a giant heart and his name.

They stood in the center of the square, embracing each other, their shadows elongated by the lights.

This scene was captured by a passerby and quickly went viral, topping the trending list. Netizens went wild, commenting, "A love like no other!" "I believe in true love again!"

I silently saved the video and posted a photo of our marriage certificate as the top comment: "If it weren't for the green on my head, I would have been moved too."
------

I posted a photo of my marriage certificate online.

The comments section exploded instantly.

"Seriously? You're still staying in this marriage? What for?"

"Such a perfect couple in public, but living separate lives in private. What great actors!"

"My heart aches for you. That green hat fits you perfectly."

My phone rang.

Joy Valentine's voice carried her usual self-righteous tone.

"I'm working late tonight. Not coming home."

In the background, cheers erupted.

The hum of a drone light show echoed.

She was always like this.

A casual announcement, expecting me to accept it without question.

On the dining table sat her favorite Champagne Roses.

Next to them, a limited edition Cartier Watch.

I had prepared all her favorite dishes.

Reheated them again and again.

The sauce had completely dried up.

"Do you remember what day it is today?"

She scoffed.

"Just our anniversary. What's the big deal?"

How ridiculous.

Three days ago, I was out of town working on a project.

I wasn't supposed to make it back.

She cried and threatened divorce.

Said I didn't care about her.

I worked through the night to finish my tasks.

Booked the earliest flight back.

Now, it all seemed like a joke.

My voice grew heavy.

"Have fun. With your First Love."

She exploded.

"Ryan Roland, what are you implying? I told you I'm working late!"

"Don't drag me into your dark thoughts!"

"I married you, but I didn't sell myself to you!"

I sent her the link to the trending video.

The drone forming a heart pattern was particularly glaring.

"Working late in someone else's arms?"

"Congratulations on making headlines with Felix Laurent."

The other end of the line fell silent.

Only her rapid breathing could be heard.

She was clearly watching the viral video.

"Delete that marriage certificate right now!"

"You might not care about your dignity, but I do!"

"Felix just returned from abroad. I was just welcoming him back!"

"He has an international project he wants me to invest in."

"Look at him, then look at yourself!"

"Always so suspicious and paranoid!"

"You'll never catch up to him!"

As I listened to her shrill voice.

Images of countless sleepless nights flashed before my eyes.

A dull ache formed in my stomach.

"Yes, I can't compare to him."

I said softly.

"Let's get a divorce."
###Chapter 2

The moment I hung up the phone, exhaustion washed over me like a tidal wave.

The carefully prepared dishes and flowers in the living room were thrown into the trash without a second thought.

Despite not having slept for days, I forced myself to pack Joy Valentine's luggage.

Everything was neatly packed and placed in the corner of the living room.

After finishing, I collapsed into bed.

When I woke up again, it was already the next morning.

Joy had not returned all night.

My phone only had a few scattered messages from her—

"I was wrong this time. Let's make up for our anniversary when things settle down."

"Why aren't you replying? Speak up! I've already apologized, what more do you want?"

I opened her social media.

The nine-grid photos were all intimate snapshots of her and Felix Laurent.

In a few, they were holding bubble tea, leaning against each other, smiling like a couple deeply in love.

Joy captioned the post: "Life is like a crossroads. Some people, once missed, are gone forever. Others, after parting ways, will meet again. Times change, hearts shift, but at least we remain us."

The post had just been shared, and Jenny Valentine immediately liked and commented—

"Felix is back? Why didn't you call me? I want to have dinner with him too!"

Half an hour later, Mrs. Valentine chimed in: "Felix is back? You kept it quiet! Your dad was just saying he wanted to play chess with him. Bring him home for dinner, I'll cook his favorite seafood feast!"

In all these years of marriage, the Valentines had never shown me such warmth.

I used to be a civil servant, earning a modest salary, living a stable but dull life.

The Valentines thought I didn’t earn enough and pressured me to quit and venture into business.

Now, I work day and night, constantly overworked.

To take care of Joy's parents, I stayed in her city.

Mrs. Valentine has health issues, so I accompany her to the hospital on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Mr. Valentine loves chess, so I spent a fortune on a custom rosewood chess set for him.

Jenny struggled academically and couldn’t get into college, so I pulled strings to get her tutoring, helping her graduate and land a decent job.

Yet, the entire family still looked down on me.

Every time we visited, no one bothered to talk to me.

My phone vibrated suddenly.

Joy texted: "Mom and Dad want me and Felix to come home for dinner. Are you coming?"

Before I could reply, she sent another: "Remember to bring gifts. My parents already don’t like you, and Felix knows how to charm them better. Don’t embarrass me this time."

I brought no gifts.

Only a set of divorce papers to the Valentines' home.

The moment I pushed the door open, the laughter in the living room stopped abruptly.

The Valentines were gathered around Felix, chatting and laughing happily.

Joy frowned at me: "Why are you so late? Where are the things I asked you to bring?"

Mrs. Valentine said with a sneer: "No wonder you’re so unpopular, you’re so clueless."

Felix gave me a meaningful smile, then turned to present his gifts: "Mr. and Mrs. Valentine, it’s been a while. Just a small token, please don’t mind."

Mrs. Valentine has chronic health issues and can’t consume ginseng or deer antler.

Mr. Valentine has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and liver problems, so he can’t drink spirits.

In the past, I would have spoken up to stop them.

But not anymore.

Since he’s their long-awaited "golden son-in-law," why should I interfere?

Mrs. Valentine accepted the gifts with a smile, then turned to me with a stern face—

"What are you standing there for? Can’t you see we’re talking? Go check on the soup in the kitchen!"
###Chapter 3

I stood frozen in place.

The air turned icy.

Joy Valentine broke the silence first, her brows furrowed. "Who are you glaring at? If you don't want to be here, just leave."

Mrs. Valentine immediately chimed in. "This dinner is for Felix Laurent. You should be grateful you're even invited! My daughter marrying you was the worst mistake of her life!"

I swallowed hard and let out a cold laugh.

"Am I your family's servant? Here just to wait on all of you?"

Both Mr. and Mrs. Valentine were stunned.

Joy suddenly stood up. "Ryan Roland, explain yourself!"

Jenny Valentine interjected with a smirk. "Are you still upset about last night, brother-in-law?"

"The online rumors about my sister have nothing to do with her. You're a grown man acting so petty, no wonder you're not good enough for her."

"But it's no surprise people got the wrong idea. Even I think my sister and Felix make a perfect match!"

Felix stepped forward at the perfect moment.

He stood beside Joy and gently placed his hand on her arm.

"Mr. Roland, you can blame me, but don't slander Joy."

"A real man knows how to cherish his wife. You're the one who needs to reflect."

He always knew how to play the good guy.

Back when Mrs. Valentine needed heart bypass surgery abroad.

I emptied my savings to cover all the medical expenses.

Felix merely helped arrange a few hospitals.

When Joy accompanied her mother overseas, she specifically left me behind.

She said someone needed to take care of her father and sister.

But while abroad, she rekindled her old flame with Felix.

Afterward, the Valentines showered Felix with gratitude, praising his kindness and thoughtfulness.

Meanwhile, I, the son-in-law who sacrificed everything, was labeled as useless and incompetent.

Mrs. Valentine rolled her eyes and sneered. "Look at yourself in the mirror! Felix is far better than you! If it weren't for that incident back then, Joy would have never married you!"
###Chapter 4

Joy Valentine and Felix Laurent's story began during their time studying abroad.

Back then, the Valentine family was still prosperous, and Joy was a pampered heiress.

They were a perfect match, deeply in love.

But fate had other plans. The Valentine family's business suddenly collapsed.

Crushed by massive debts, they couldn't even afford Joy's tuition.

She had to drop out of school, painfully break up with Felix, and return home in haste.

When we got married, the Valentines were still drowning in financial troubles.

I used my savings to pay off their debts and helped them find jobs through my connections.

Little did I know, these efforts would become a thorn in their hearts.

The Valentines always believed Felix was the ideal son-in-law, and that I had taken advantage of their misfortune.

Today, as they gathered together, it was clear they were reminiscing about the past.

I spoke calmly, "You're right. Felix is indeed a better match for Joy."

I placed the divorce papers on the coffee table and slid them toward Joy.

"Sign it. I'm setting you free."

The living room fell silent.

Mrs. Valentine slammed her teacup, shattering it into pieces.

"Ryan Roland! Do you think the Valentines are pushovers? You think you can marry and divorce my daughter at will?"

Jenny Valentine chimed in shrilly, "Only a weak man resorts to divorce!"

Felix stood up, feigning discomfort.

"Mr. Roland, if my presence has caused any misunderstanding, I'll leave now."

He walked slowly toward the door, deliberately dragging his steps.

Just as he was about to step out, Joy spoke coldly.

"You're not the one who should leave."

Her sharp gaze pierced through me, filled with confidence.

"Divorce? Don't come crawling back to me later!"

She grabbed a pen, signed the papers, and slammed them in front of me.

I collected the documents and turned to leave.

Behind me, Jenny whispered anxiously, "Sis, you just signed it?"

Joy's voice was brimming with confidence, "What's there to fear? He always makes a big fuss but never follows through."

"We've torn up enough divorce papers to wallpaper the house. He'll be back begging in a few days."

She thought this time would be like all the others.

But she didn't know that once a heart is dead, no amount of pleading can bring it back.
###Chapter 5

The first thing I did when I got home was pack up Joy Valentine's luggage and send it away.

As soon as the package was sent, her messages started popping up one after another.

"Tomorrow, my mom has a follow-up hospital appointment. Remember to accompany her."

"While you're at it, go visit my aunt. She's still in the hospital."

"Jenny is about to take her professional exam. Help her outline the key points."

I stared at the screen, not replying to any of them.

But she only escalated: "My dad's blood pressure is high again. Buy a blood pressure monitor, the same kind as Old Zhang's next door."

Finally, I couldn't hold back and sent her a message: "Didn't you receive the package?"

Joy replied instantly: "I did. So what? Are you really planning to divorce?"

Her tone was dismissive: "Get these things done first. I'm staying at my parents' place for a few days. They're still upset, so don't cause any trouble."

I looked at her message and suddenly laughed out loud.

Did she still think I would grovel like before?

Sorry, not this time.

I turned off my phone and started packing my own things.

This marital home was something Joy insisted on buying.

It was close to her parents' place and her workplace, but far from my company.

For three years, I commuted two hours every day, rain or shine.

Now, it was over.

I rented an apartment near my company and spent the whole day moving.

Just as I was collapsing on the floor from exhaustion, Mrs. Valentine called.

"Why aren't you here yet? Don't you know I have a follow-up today? And we need to visit my sister. How long are you going to drag this out?"

I replied calmly: "Go by yourself. I'm busy."

Mrs. Valentine exploded: "Who's going to drive me then? Do you expect me to take the subway?"

I sneered: "Ask Felix Laurent to accompany you. You're the queen, after all. I'm not worthy."

With that, I blocked her.

Just a few minutes of peace later, Jenny called.

"Brother-in-law, did my sister tell you? Help me outline the exam key points."

I scoffed: "I'm busy. Ask your other brother-in-law."

I blocked her too.

Before I could even put my phone down, it rang again.

This time, it was Mr. Valentine.

"Son-in-law, remember to buy the blood pressure monitor, the same kind as Old Zhang's. I sent you a photo."

I raised an eyebrow: "Son-in-law? You've got the wrong person. Joy and I are already divorced."
###Chapter 6

The phone screen lit up.

Joy Valentine's name flashed.

I swiped to answer.

The other end was unusually quiet.

Her voice was laced with suppressed anger. "Where are you now?"

I leaned back in the car seat. "None of your business."

She sent a family photo.

Her parents and sister were sitting in the living room.

"Come back and talk," she said.

I still had some things left to take.

It was time to go back and settle things.

I pushed the door open.

Mr. and Mrs. Valentine sat stiffly on the sofa.

Like two stern statues.

Jenny Valentine's eyes were red and swollen.

Her gaze was like a poisoned dagger.

Joy Valentine lifted her chin.

Waiting for me to apologize first.

I walked straight into the bedroom.

Packed the last few items.

Joy Valentine finally spoke up.

"Do you think this will work?"

"You'll only end up embarrassing yourself!"

I stopped what I was doing. "What?"

She threw a stack of documents on the table.

"Sign this."

"Sell the marital home."

This house was my pre-marital property.

I remembered when I bought it.

Her mother and sister had tried everything to stop me.

"Taking on a loan right after marriage?"

"Expecting my sister to pay your debts?"

I offered to pay the mortgage alone.

They still disagreed.

"A cunning poor man!"

Jenny Valentine had pointed at my nose then.

"You'll pay the mortgage."

"My sister will cover living expenses."

"You get all the benefits!"

In the end, I sold my old house.

Bought this marital home outright.

Joy Valentine moved in directly.

Even the decoration was handled by my parents.

I looked at Joy Valentine with a cold smile.

"What does this house have to do with you?"

She raised her chin.

"I know you bought it."

"Otherwise, why would you need to sign?"

Her self-righteousness made me want to laugh.

"Felix Laurent's project is short of five million."

"Sell the house first."

"We'll buy a bigger one when we make money."

"Move my family in together."

She handed me the pen.

"Sign now."

"We'll let bygones be bygones."
###Chapter 7

How ridiculous.

She had grown accustomed to being adored.

Now, she demanded favors with such arrogance.

Such condescension.

I picked up the house sale contract.

I looked at her, puzzled.

"Didn't you see the divorce papers I left for you?"

Joy Valentine was visibly stunned.

My gaze shifted to the coffee table.

The glass still weighed down the papers.

She hadn't noticed my signature.

I pulled out the document.

I slapped it down in front of her.

My finger pointed to the signature.

"We're already divorced."

"The property should indeed be divided."

"But I bought the house."

"It has nothing to do with you."

"At most, you can get some interest."

"But—"

I paused deliberately.

Watching her pupils contract sharply.

"House prices have plummeted these past few years."

"You won't get a penny from that."

Joy fell silent.

She hadn't expected me to sign.

The air grew heavy with tension.

Finally, she looked up.

Her lips curled into a sneer.

"And then what?"

"Grown some backbone, have you?"

"Daring to sign now?"

"You think I'll believe that?"

"In the end, it'll be you begging me to take you back."

Jenny Valentine yawned as she walked over.

She snorted disdainfully.

"That's right, brother-in-law."

"If you don't have the guts, don't put on a show."

"Aren't you tired of this drama?"

"We're all tired of watching it."

Mr. and Mrs. Valentine immediately stood up.

As if on cue, they began their performance.

"So you want a divorce?"

"Fine!"

"Pack up Joy's things right now!"

"We're taking her home!"

They glared at me fiercely.

"Our daughter is exceptional."

"There's a line of men waiting to marry her down the street!"

"Why should she suffer with you?"

"If you want a divorce, hurry up!"

"Don't waste our time!"

I responded indifferently.

"The divorce papers are already signed."

"If you're not convinced."

"We can go through the court process."

"As for Joy's belongings—"

"Didn't I already send them back to your house?"

"Anyone with eyes can see."

"There's nothing of hers in this house."

"What exactly do you want to pack?"

"Surely you're not thinking of taking my house?"

I chuckled.

My voice laced with sarcasm.

"Too bad."

"I will sell the house."

"But you won't get a single cent."
###Chapter 8

The Valentine family exchanged uneasy glances.

Fear was evident on their faces.

All eyes eventually turned to Joy Valentine.

Joy stared at me intensely.

Her gaze fell on the signature on the Divorce Papers.

She spoke through gritted teeth.

"I don't agree!"

"You think you can just divorce me?"

I responded with a calm "Oh."

"You signed the papers."

"Now you want to take it back?"

"Too late for that."

I pulled out my phone.

I made a show of calling the police.

"This is my house."

"Are you leaving or not?"

"If not, I'll have someone escort you out."

Joy stormed out with her family in tow.

From the hallway, Jenny's voice trembled with fear.

"Joy, are you really divorcing Ryan?"

"Will Felix marry you?"

Mrs. Valentine cut in sharply.

"Enough!"

"Felix came looking for Joy as soon as he returned."

"It's obvious he still has feelings for her!"

"Good riddance to that loser!"

"Our family never approved of him anyway!"

The Valentines were dreaming.

They wanted Joy to marry Felix.

But their plans were flawed.

A video of Joy and Felix went viral online.

I posted our marriage certificate.

Netizens identified their real identities.

They called for the downfall of the cheating pair.

Joy was forced to make a public statement.

"It's all a misunderstanding."

"Ryan and I are just good friends."

"My husband and I have a stable relationship."

"Please don't spread rumors that hurt innocent people!"

Felix also pretended to distance himself.

"Joy and I are just ordinary friends."

"The hug was a friendly gesture of comfort."

"I apologize for any misunderstanding with Ryan."

"I assure you, there's nothing between us."

Netizens exposed Felix's girlfriend abroad.

The Valentines finally quieted down.

They came to their senses and reached out to me.

Joy belatedly posted a photo of flowers.

She captioned it "Happy Anniversary."

She tagged me in the post.

Mr. and Mrs. Valentine prepared a feast.

They shamelessly contacted me.

"Ryan, last time didn't go well."

"We've made your favorite dishes."

"We missed our Anniversary."

"Come celebrate at our place."

"We've got everything ready."

Even Jenny switched sides.

"Ryan, I owe my college and job to you."

"I heard you like gaming."

"I bought the latest console as a thank you."

"Joy likes it too."

"You can play together from now on."
###Chapter 9

Belated affection is worth less than grass.

I was once addicted to gaming, but only because Joy Valentine loved it.
She barely acknowledged me, even after we got engaged, rarely speaking more than a few words to me.
To get closer to her, I joined her in playing games.

Throughout our marriage, Joy never cooked a single meal for me.
On our anniversary, she never posted photos or mentioned me.
She probably didn’t want anyone to know she hadn’t married Felix Laurent.
Even on her social media, there were hardly any traces of me.

Now, she’s making a grand announcement, celebrating our long-expired anniversary.

Netizens wouldn’t let it go, flooding my comments with warnings—
“Don’t be foolish, man!”
“You believe this lie? You’re just setting yourself up to be cheated on!”

I immediately posted the divorce papers, tagging her directly—
“We’re divorced. Don’t bother me. And Ms. Valentine, I don’t celebrate with exes.”

Joy became a laughingstock.
She and Felix were nailed to the pillar of shame, despised by everyone.

Her parents occasionally invited me for dinner, claiming they’d made my favorite dishes.
But the table was full of seafood, none of which I could eat.
In their hearts, it was always Felix.

I replied uniformly, “No more dinners, and I don’t want the gaming console either.”
“Since we’re divorced, let’s not stay in touch.”

I thought Joy had some pride and would understand after this.
But to my surprise, she was waiting outside my apartment building after work.

I pretended not to see her and walked straight ahead.
She called out from behind, “Ryan Roland… can we talk?”

I didn’t turn around. “There’s nothing to talk about.”

Suddenly, she grabbed my arm, her fingers trembling.
Her voice choked with tears, “Felix lied to me… his project collapsed, and I lost everything.”

I sneered, “So?”

Tears fell as she gripped me tighter—
“I mortgaged my parents’ house… the money’s gone.”
“My mom had a heart attack, and my dad’s in the hospital with a stroke…”
She sobbed, barely able to speak, “Can you… help me?”
###Chapter 10

The scene felt all too familiar.

It reminded me of when the Valentines went bankrupt, and Joy had begged for help in the same way.

She stood outside the Laurent mansion, tears streaming down her face.

She thought Felix would help her because of their past relationship.

But Felix didn’t even show his face.

Only his mother came out, dismissing Joy with a few sharp words.

Each word cut like a knife, severing all ties between them.

Later, Joy met me through an arranged introduction.

On our wedding night, she held my hand and cried.

She said, "Ryan, they’re my parents. I can’t abandon them."

She said, "Now that we’re married, we’re family. Please help them, won’t you?"

For years, I worked myself to the bone.

I scrimped and saved to pay off the Valentines’ debts.

I pulled them out of the abyss.

But they forgot all about it in no time.

Joy always said it was Felix’s mother who made the decision, not Felix himself.

The Valentines often lamented that if it weren’t for their misfortune, Joy would have been Mrs. Laurent by now.

And now they’re trying the same old trick?

Expecting me to be their fool again?

I yanked my hand away from Joy.

"We’re divorced," I said firmly.

Seeing her stunned expression, I spoke slowly and clearly, "I’m doing well now. Your family’s problems are no longer my concern."

"There’s no reason for an ex-husband to pay off his former in-laws’ debts."

Tears instantly welled up in Joy’s eyes.

She lunged forward and grabbed my arm.

"Honey, I know I was wrong," she pleaded.

"I only filed for divorce out of anger. I thought you’d come and comfort me…"

She trembled as she cried, "You hated me seeing Felix, didn’t you? I promise I’ll never see him again."

"I’ve long since lost any feelings for him. I hate him now."

Suddenly, she dropped to her knees.

"I didn’t know how to appreciate you before, but I’ll change."

"Please give me another chance. Let’s remarry, okay?"

I pulled my hand back and took a step away.

"Now you want to come back?" I said coldly.

"Too bad. I don’t love you anymore."
###Chapter 11

After my divorce from Joy Valentine, I went through a period of intense pain.

Those days felt like an endless night, suffocating me.

But when I finally emerged from the darkness, I realized how much lighter life felt without her.

I no longer had to compromise myself to please her family.

I no longer had to constantly worry about upsetting her.

Now, I poured all my energy into my career.

My performance at work improved dramatically.

I was promoted and received a raise, and my future looked bright.

Meanwhile, Joy's life took a sharp turn for the worse.

She had always lived a pampered life, even after her family went bankrupt, she quickly married me.

She shifted all the responsibility onto me, comfortably playing the role of a princess.

Now, she had to face everything alone.

Felix Laurent had swindled her out of all her money, leaving her unable to afford the surgery, forcing her to settle for conservative treatment for Mrs. Valentine.

But Mrs. Valentine passed away.

That day, Joy wept uncontrollably in the hospital room, repeatedly slapping herself.

Mr. Valentine, paralyzed from a stroke, could only move in a wheelchair.

After arranging Mrs. Valentine's funeral, Joy was utterly exhausted.

She had no energy left to care for her father.

Mr. Valentine fell down the stairs, and though he was rescued in time, he ended up in a vegetative state.

Jenny Valentine had always been a troublemaker.

She was of no help in such times.

Instead, she blamed Joy for bringing Felix into their lives and losing the family fortune.

She refused to care for Mr. Valentine, quit her job, and disappeared.

All the burden fell on Joy's shoulders.

She stayed by her father's side, determined to find Felix and recover the lost money.

But Felix had already fled abroad.

The victims who had met Felix through Joy came knocking, demanding repayment.

Her doorstep was constantly crowded with creditors.

Desperate, Joy took to the internet to call out Felix.

"Felix, if you're a man, come back and take responsibility."

"So many lives have been ruined because of you. Doesn't your conscience hurt?"

But evil people never feel remorse.

Her pleas only brought mockery and were of no use.
###Chapter 12

Joy Valentine was dead.

She chose the most final way to leave this world.

The water in the bathtub was stained a shocking red.

She lay quietly inside, the wound on her wrist horrifying to behold.

Even more shocking was that she had taken her father, who was in a vegetative state, with her.

The creditors were banging on the door, demanding she repay her debts.

There was no response from inside.

They broke down the door, only to be rendered speechless by the scene before them.

Joy had already stopped breathing.

Her father lay on the bed in the bedroom, having been given a large dose of sleeping pills by her beforehand.

The media caught wind of the story and rushed to report on this horrifying tragedy.

Journalists used the sharpest words to depict her unfilial behavior.

Soon, someone tracked down Jenny Valentine.

When the cameras turned to Jenny, she frantically shielded her face with her hands.

"What does this have to do with me?" Her voice was shrill and piercing. "It's all my sister's fault for not seeing people clearly!"

"She gambled away the family fortune! Wasn't it enough that she killed our mother? Now she's taken our father too!"

She roughly pushed the reporters aside, her face twisted in anger.

"Stop looking for me! I don't have such a family!"

The police notified me to come and claim Joy's belongings.

I had expected to find many traces of Felix Laurent.

Surprisingly, there was nothing related to him among her possessions.

After the project collapsed, she must have completely given up on her first love.

In a small box, I found things that belonged to me.

Every gift I had given her was carefully preserved.

Photos from our travels were neatly arranged.

I heard that when she took her last breath, she was still clutching her wedding ring.

Perhaps everything she said to me that day was true.

She didn't really want a divorce; she was just spoiled by her nature.

She was waiting for me to bow my head first, to force me to admit my mistakes.

She had indeed fallen for me, but she couldn't let go of her obsession with her first love.

I threw everything into the fire.

The flames consumed every bit of the past.

In my life, the name Joy Valentine was completely erased.

This relationship taught me self-respect and self-love.

From now on, I will never sacrifice my dignity for anyone.

To be loved, one must first love oneself.

If you don't even cherish yourself, how can you expect others to?

My ill-fated relationship with Joy ends here.

I have never regretted the decision to divorce.
