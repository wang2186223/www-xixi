###Chapter 1 Double Betrayal

In the dimly lit room, the air was thick with the sounds of passion as two figures intertwined on the bed.


A man in a perfectly tailored black suit held a woman tightly in his arms.She was dazed,her face flushed.


Kathie Cavendish felt like her whole body was on fire. The heat of her breath mingled with the man's cool demeanor. She wanted to resist,but it was futile.


Her hands were pinned above her head. Kathie struggled to open her eyes,only to see the man's hair. Despite her hazy consciousness, one word was etched deeply into her mind:Pain.

Was this a dream?

But it felt so real.

Kathie tried to push him away, but a strong hand gripped her tightly.His cool lips touched her breast, making her shiver uncontrollably.

Tonight was her wedding night with Randy Berkeley. They had been in love for years but had never truly made love. She had wanted to save it for their wedding night.

She never imagined that Randy, who seemed so frail, would have such stamina.

Feeling the wetness beneath them, Kathie's face turned crimson.

Her voice was almost lost in the pillows as she tried to escape, only to be pulled back by the man's strong hand. "No!" Kathie's voice was muffled as her back pressed against the man's muscular chest. Her back was pressed against his muscular chest, and his erection pressed against her buttocks. Just as he was about to make love to her, she suddenly felt a sharp blow to her head.

"You shameless slut! Kathie! Have you no shame?" Randy shouted.


The angry shouts pulled Kathie out of her erotic dream. She rubbed her eyes and saw Randy standing there, furious.


A silk blanket covered her stomach, her long legs looking particularly seductive. Her black nightgown was bunched up around her chest.

Kathie felt the stickiness beneath her and realized she had had another erotic dream.


It was strange. Lately, she kept dreaming about their wedding night. The sensations and memories were vivid.


But she could never see the man's face clearly.

Kathie felt a deep sense of loss. After all, it was supposed to be a beautiful night with Randy.

Since then, Randy had changed. He never came home at night and stopped being intimate with her.

Randy threw a report in Kathie's face. "In broad daylight, you're this horny! You shameless woman, explain this to me!" Sunlight streamed through the bed, highlighting Kathie's increasingly red face. Lately, she had been feeling unusually sleepy and had just wanted to rest for a bit but ended up falling asleep.

Kathie gave a bitter smile. Maybe the experience that night was too intense,leading to these erotic dreams.


Seeing the scattered reports, Kathie's eyes lit up. She picked one up and handed it to Randy, saying, "Randy, I'm pregnant. Look, this report..."

"Get out!" Randy slapped her hand away, cutting her off. "Kathie! I never slept with you. That bastard in your belly isn't mine! You made such a big deal about saving your virginity for me, but who knows how many men you've been with behind my back!"

Kathie was stunned. Looking at Randy's angry face, she turned pale. "How is that possible? Randy, on our wedding night, we made love. Randy, don't joke like this. It's not funny at all."

Kathie reached for Randy's arm, but he pushed her away.

The black nightgown highlighted Kathie's alluring skin, with one strap slipping down her arm, revealing herfull breasts.

No matter what Kathie looked like, her body was incredible.

Randy's throat felt hot, bt his voice was cold. "Kathie, that night I was with Shirley Cavendish."

Kathie felt like she had been struck by lightning. "What do you mean by that?"

Randy had abandoned her on their wedding night to be with her stepsister Shirley!

Then who was the man she had slept with that night? Randy threw another document on the table. "That child you're carrying,I don't know whose it is, but it's not mine! Kathie, we're getting a divorce!The papers are ready, and you won't take a single thing from here!"

"Randy, you betrayed our relationship with Shirley and now you're blaming me! You want a divorce? Dream on!" Kathie was furious, jumping up to grab Randy, but he pushed her away forcefully.


Just as Kathie was about to curse again, the bedroom door burst open, and Shirley shouted, "Kathie, be sensible and divorce Randy. He doesn't love you,and clinging to him is useless!"


Shirley,who had been eavesdropping, couldn't hold back any longer when she heard Kathie refusing to divorce. She barged in, yelling at Kathie.

"Look at yourself in the mirror. Do you think someone as ugly as you deserves Randy?" Shirley mocked.

Randy wrapped his arm around Shirley's waist, smugly saying, "Kathie,you see, only a woman like Shirley deserves me."

Shirley leaned coquettishly against Randy's chest.

Randy pulled Shirley out of the bedroom, saying, "Kathie, you have half an hour to think it over. Otherwise, don't blame me for throwing you out!"

As their voices faded, Kathie feltlike she was in a dream.

The change had happened so quickly that she couldn't process it. Kathie and Randy had been in love since college and got married. Three months ago, Randy was acknowledged by the leading elite family in Eldoria. Although Randy's parents were merely a branch of the Berkeley Family, it did not prevent him from rising from a penniless commoner to a member of the top-tier elite.

Why hadn't he said she wasn't good enough for him when he was pursuing her?

In terms of status, Kathie wasn't as good at dressing up or sweet-talking as her stepsister Shirley. She also had a mother in prison and wasn't well-liked at home.


But even if Randy thought she wasn't good enough for him,he shouldn't have disgusted her by having an affair with her stepsister Shirley!

"Bastard! Randy! You want me to divorce and let you two be together?Dream on!" Kathie thought for a few seconds, quickly changed her clotes,gathered all her money and bank cards, and left the bedroom.

From the other bedroom, she could hear Shirley's moans of pleasure.

Kathie gritted her teeth in anger. She quietly opened the door, took out her phone, and snapped several photos, then quickly slipped out the back door.


By the time Randy and Shirley finished, they realized Kathie was long gone from the large villa.

Valoria,at a hospital.

Kathie,who had applied for an exchange program in Valoria through her medical mentor, went abroad to escape Randy. Initially, her studies were intense, so she finally found time to visit the hospital. She was preparing for an abortion. The doctor looked at the report and said seriously, "Ms. Cavendish, your uterine lining is very thin and could develop complications. If you go through with this, you might not be able to conceive again. Of course, it's just a possibility."
As a medical student, Kathie understood. She touched her already showing belly,feeling lost.
Should she keep this child, whose father she didn't even know?
###Chapter 2 Bringing Triplet Babies Back to theCountry
Four years later.

Eldoria International Airport.

It was the weekend, and the airport was buzzing with activity.

Kathie was juggling a child in her arms and another by the hand. She reminded her eldest son, Kyle Cavendish, "Make sure you hold your brother's hand tight. There are too many people here, so don't get lost."

"Don't worry, Mommy!" Kyle said, gripping Zachary's hand firmly and sticking close to Kathie.


Zachary's round eyes sparkled with excitement as he took in the bustling crowd. "Mommy, there are so many people who look like us!"


Having grown up abroad, they rarely saw familiar faces, which made the naturally lively Zachary even more thrilled.

Kathie found a stroller and placed her children in it. Her triplets, with their adorable and handsome looks, immediately caught the attention of passersby.

Back then, she had decided to keep the children, not expecting to have triplets. The hardships were unimaginable, but she felt fortunate to have these three lovely children with her, bringing her happiness and fulfillment. She had planned to live abroad permanently, but with the children reaching school age, she decided to return home. She also had something she wanted to investigate. "Mommy,where are we going?" asked Eileen Cavendish, the youngest and only girl among the triplets, tilting her head with innocent, round eyes.

"We're going to Mommy's grandmother's house," Kathie replied.

Kathie hailed a cab, holding Eileen in her arms while the other two sat beside her. The four of them squeezed into the back seat.

The cab driver,seeing Kathie alone with three children, couldn't help but comment, "You look so young, and you already have three kids. Why are you out here alone? Where's their dad? How come you're handling everything by yourself?"

The topic of their father was always sensitive around the children, and Kathie usually dodged the question. However, Kyle and Zachary,being more mature than their peers, were no longer easily fooled.

Just as Kathie was struggling to respond, Zachary chimed in with a cheeky grin, "Our dad is busy working sir. Is that picture of your daughter?"

Zachary pointed to a photo pendant hanging in the cab.

"Yes. She's a couple of years older than you," the driver replied,his attention shifting to his daughter.


Kathie watched her children chat with the driver, feeling a weight in her heart. The radío suddenly announced, "Here's the latest traffic update.Jonathan Berkeley, the newly appointed CEO of the Berkeley Group, was in a car accident. His condition is unknown. If there are any witnesses, please contact the following number..." Eileen, with surprising maturity, said, "There are so many car accidents these days. Please drive carefully,sir!"

The driver chuckled, "Don't worry, my driving skills are top-notch. I used to be a race car driver!"

When they reached their destination, Kathie recalled the news she had heard on the radio and fell into deep thought.

The Berkeley Family was prominent in Eldoria, and Randy was a distant relative.

The name of Jonathan Berkeley sounded familiar to Kathie, and she found herself lost in thought.

"Mommy! The water is overflowing!" Eileen called out.

Eileen's voice snapped Kathie back to reality. She realized she had been too distracted and quickly turned off the faucet.

After her grandmother passed away, Kathie inherited a house in the suburbs of Eldoria. She used to visit regularly to clean it, but over the past four years, it had gathered a lot of dust, though there were some footprints on the floor, likely from Randy checking if she was there.


Kathie had just returned and was cleaning with the kids, but she had been so lost in thought that the bucket was nearly overflowing.

"Eileen, you go rest. Mommy will mop the floor." Kathie then grabbed the mop and asked,"Where are your brothers?" "Go, Mommy!" Eileen cheered her on. "Kyle is in the backyard,and Zachary went to get some tissues and then ran outside." The backyard, overgrown with weeds and backed by a cliff, looked desolate. Worried about the children's safety, Kathie put down the mop and took Eileen to the backyard.



"Mommy! We're here!" Kyle's voice came from the grass ahead.

Kathie hurried over. "What are you doing here?"

Kyle looked up with his delicate face. "Mommy, we found someone."

Zachary stood up and handed her the tissues. "Mommy, he's bleeding and still breathing. We need to help him! Maybe we can get a reward!"
Kathie finally noticed the severely injured man lying on the ground. His clothes were torn, and his exposed skin was covered in wounds.
He was barely alive, and if they didn't help himn soon,he might die.

Kathie looked up at the cliff's edge, which was out of sight. This man must have fallen from up there. It was a miracle he was still alive.
She set Eileen down and knelt beside the man, checking his eyes and pulse. After a few seconds,she stood up.

As a doctor, Kathie decided to save him.

It took a lot of effort to get the man back to the house. Ignoring the blood on her clothes, she laid him on the bed."Mommy, I'll get the first aid kit!" "Mommy, I'll bring some water!" "Mommy, I'll stay with you and this handsome man!"

Kathie remained silent.

Seeing Eileen staring at the man on the bed, Kathie couldn't help but smile.

Despite the bruises on his face, the man's handsome features were still evident.


She couldn't believe that young Eileen was already so captivated by his looks.


Kyle soon returned with the first aid kit and pulled Eileen's hand. "Eileen,don't call everyone handsome. You might get tricked when you grow up."

Eileen pouted. "But this man is really handsome. He looks a lot like Kyle."

Kathie paused, her hand holding the acupuncture needle, and looked closely at the unconscious man. There was indeed a resemblance to Kyle in his features.


"Mommy, are you going to use the needles?" Zachary asked excitedly,his round eyes wide.

Kathie smiled. "Yes, Mommy is going to save him. Be good, Kyle,take your brother and sister outside."

"Okay!" Kyle then obediently led Zachary and Eileen out.

Kathie took a deep breath and removed the man's clothes, leaving only his underwear. She then began placing needles at key acupuncture points. The man's muscular body, with its defined abs, moved with his breathing.Her gaze fell on his right shoulder. Kathie's hand froze in mid-air, her eyes widening.

There, on his shoulder, was a faint red bite mark.

Four years ago that night, Kathie bit down hard on the man's shoulder above her because the initial pain during sex was too intense,biting so hard she could taste blood.

This man not only had the same bite mark but also resembled her children.

Kathie stared in shock at the unconscious man. Could it really be such a coincidence?
###Chapter 3 The Man Who Resembles HerChi l dren
Kathie felt a whirlwind of emotions. She was terrified this man might be the one she had a one-night stand with, and she didn't dare make a move.

Maybe it was all just a coincidence.

There are tons of people in the world who look alike, and as for the scar,
it had to be a coincidence too!

Kathie steadied herself, wrung out the towel from the basin, and gently wiped the mud and blood off the man's face.

When she finally saw his face clearly, her heart started racing.

It wasn't because she was smitten by his good looks, but because she had never seen such an unblemished face.

His refined features exuded authority and strength, with a prominent nose and deep-set eyes that were closed. He was so strikingly perfect that Kathie couldn't look away.

She examined him closely; the man really did look quite a bit like her children.

She searched through his clothes but found no identification, not even a phone. However, his high-quality suit was clearly expensive, suggesting he wasn't an ordinary person. Recalling the car accident news she had heard earlier, Kathie grew suspicious. Could he be Jonathan Berkeley?

After a moment. Kathie covered himn with a blanket and headed to the kitchen to prepare some medicine.






Meanwhile, her three children had been secretly watching from outside.Seeing Kathie leave, they sneaked into the room.
"He hasn't woken up yet." Eileen ran to the bedside and exclaimed, "Wow!He's so handsome!"
Zachary pulled Eileen back by the neck. "Eileen, don't get obsessed with looks. Be careful not to get tricked."
Eileen pouted, "But he's really handsome! And he looks a lot like us!"

The other two kids looked and nodded. Zachary said, "Could he be our dad?"

Kyle's young voice was steady, "There are many people who look alike.The bad man who abandoned Mommy also looked like us."

Eileen quickly waved her hands. "That bad man is definitely not our dad!"

Zachary shook his head. "Absolutely not!" "Of course not. Our dad must be a good person!" Kyle crossed his arms,very sure of himself. Over the past year, they had pieced together their story from conversations between their mom and godmother. Four years ago, their mother was betrayed by a scumbag and her stepsister.so she went abroad and gave birth to them. But no one knew who their biological father was.


Kyle guessed that their mom didn't know either. Every time they asked about their dad, she looked very sad.

Eventually, he told his siblings to stop asking, and they avoided the topic.

But they still really wanted to know who their dad was.

The kids all looked at the sleeping man, their faces full of confusion and sadness.

Kathie returned with the medicine and saw the kids gathered around the bed, feeling a sudden sense of family.

She must have been overwhelmed by the smell of the medicine, making her head spin.

Eileen was the first to ask, "Mommy! Will the handsome man be okay?"

Kathie replied softly, "He'll be fine. With proper treatment,he'll recover."


He was lucky to survive such a high fall.

He had broken his arm and leg. Once he woke up, it would be best to take him to the hospital.

"Mommy needs to give him his medicine now. You guys go play," Kathie said. She sent the kids away and then propped up the man's head to feed him the medicine. Sensing the bitter taste, the man kept his lips tightly shut.

She tried several times but couldn't get him to drink it.

Frustrated,Kathie wiped his mouth and threw the handkerchief on the table. "You're so big and strong, yet you're fussing over some bitter medicine?"


The man remained unconscious, hisbrows furrowing as if he could taste the bitterness.


Kathie sighed, pinched his cheeks to force his mouth open, and quickly poured the medicine in.

Halfway through, she let go, but the man slightly opened his mouth,spilling much of the medicine.

Kathie frowned. "If you want to die, just don't drink the medicine!"

The man's brows furrowed as if he heard her.

Kathie continued, "Open your mouth. If you spit it out again, I'll feed you with my mouth. Don't say I didn't warn you!"

That seemed to work. His eyelashes fluttered, and he didn't spit out any more medicíne.

After feeding him. Kathie was drenched in sweat.

He was really hard to take care of, even more so than her kids.


That night. After puttíng the kids to bed, Kathie found herself unable to sleep, thinking about everything that had happened during the day. She put on a coat and walked to the window, looking at the full moon with a complicated feeling.

She hoped coming back was the right decision.

Kathie checked on the man in the guest room. Seeing his flushed face and sweaty forehead, she quickly felt his temperature.

He had a fever!

Luckily, she caught it in time. Otherwise, the consequences could have been severe.


Kathie brought the antipyretic medication and gave him an injection.Then she used physical cooling methods. With limited medical supplies, there wasn't much else she could do.


After a long night, his fever finally broke at dawn, and Kathie fell asleep by the bedside, exhausted.

Jonathan felt intense pain and a heavy head. He wanted to open his eyes but couldn't. He had a long dream with an irresistible female voice and the chatter of children.

The noise made him want to wake up.

Groggily, Jonathan opened his eyes and saw a delicate woman's face. Her long eyelashes looked like resting butterflies in the sunlight.

He thought he was hallucinating and tried to see more clearly, but his head and eyes felt heavy. Soon, he fell back asleep. "Sir, are you still asleep?" Eileen ran in. "Mommy, why are you sitting on the floor?" Eileen had woken up early and came to check on Jonathan first.

Kathie heard her and lifted her head from the bedside, rubbing her eyes.She realized she had fallen asleep.

"Eileen, why are you up so early?" Kathie asked.

"I wanted to see if the handsome man is better. Mommy, is he still asleep?"Eileen replied.

Kathie felt the man's forehead and sighed in relief.

His fever had broken.

"He's getting better. Eileen, go wash up. Mommy will make breakfast, and you can call your brothers to eat," Kathie said.

She then covered the man with a blanket and led Eileen out.

After almost no sleep, Kathie felt exhausted but still made breakfast for the kids.


Watching them eat happily, Kathie felt a sense of joy, and her fatigue seemed to fade.


Kathie was so tired that she fell asleep at the table halfway through eating.


Eileen was about to speak, but Kyle gestured for silence, and Zachary quickly brought a small blanket to cover Kathie.

The three kids quietly cleaned up the dishes. Kathie woke up twenty minutes later, seeing her kids around her. She felt warmth in her heart and took them back to bed for a nap. After lunch, Kathie planned to go to the mall for some supplies and medicíne. She told the kids, "Mommy is going to the mall. Be good at home and remember the three things I told you not to do."

Zachary raised his hand. "We know, don't open the front door, don't touch the electrical outlets, and stay away from fire."

Kathie smiled and ruffled his hair. "Great. Remember, especially don't open the door for strangers. I'll bring you some treats when I get back!"

The three children's eyes lit up with excitement as they happily responded,
"Okay!"
###Chapter 4 I Can Cure You

During her years abroad, Kathie worked tirelessly to support her children.Initially, her roommate helped take care of them, but after the roommate returned home, the kids gradually learned to manage on their own.

This made things much easier for Kathie.

Kathie went to the nearest mall to buy household and children's supplies.She also picked out some clothes for the kids and then headed to the men's section.


The man's clothes were all torn. Out of kindness, she decided to buy him a couple of outfits.

He couldn't stay naked forever.

As she was browsing, the TV above her played the latest news, "Recently,Jonathan, the new president of the Berkeley Group, was involved in a car accident. It is reported that the car lost control due to excessive speed, fell off a cliff, and exploded. However, Jonathan was not found at the scene. If there are any witnesses, please contact his family. A reward is offered."

Kathie looked up, but the image flashed by too quickly for her to see clearly.

She had wanted to see what Jonathan looked like but missed it.

She waited through a few more news segments, but there was no further mention of Jonathan. Seeing that it was getting late, Kathie decided to head home. On the other side of the store, Shirley was also browsing the men's section. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a familiar figure and paused. She looked closely.

It was a stunning woman with a perfect figure, elegantly picking out men's clothes.

Shirley found the woman somewhat familiar.

Her brows furrowed as she reluctantly guessed that the beautiful woman was her half-sister!

Kathie!

She had reappeared?

Seeing Kathie about to leave, Shirley hurried to follow, but the crowd blocked her way, and Kathie quickly disappeared.

Why was that bitch walking so fast!

Cursing, Shirley made a call, "Randy, I just saw Kathie. I wouldn't get it wrong. Find out where she's living. This time, we can't let her get away!"

Back then, Kathie had run off without even finalizing her-divorce, leaving Shirley in an ambiguous position with Randy. Even though she and Randy had a son, she was stilI the subject of gossip among the wealthy wives.

After four years, she had to make Kathie and Randy finalize their divorce! The three kids were behaving well, avoiding anything dangerous. Zachary was playing chess with Eileen, while Kyle was reading a book and occasionally helping Eileen with her moves. Before long, Eileen got restless and handed the chess pieces to Kyle. "I'm going to check if the handsome man is awake!"

Before Kyle and Zachary could react, Eileen had already dashed off,leaving theother two to quickly follow.
"Is the handsome man still asleep? Could he be dead?" Eileen cupped her chubby cheeks, her innocent eyes fixed on Jonathan in bed.
Zachary said, "No way. Mommy's medical skills are top-notch. She'll definitely save him."

Kyle checked the man's breathing and said calmly,"He's still alive."

Eileen sighed in relief. "That's good. He's tall and strong.He can help Mommy with a lot of work, like drying herbs."

Jonathan remained silent.

What were they talking about?

Why was it so noisy around him?

It sounded like a flock of sparrows chirping non-stop.

Jonathan furrowed his brows and slowly opened his eyes.

"He's awake!" Eileen called out.

The first thing Jonathan saw was a delicate little girl who looked like a beautiful doll. He was momentarily stunned. Zachary quickly said, "Kyle, he's awake!" Kyle leaned ín, staring at Jonathan, and said in a mature tone, "You're awake. Mommy said if you woke up, you'd be fine." Like little mushrooms, three identical children popped up one by one.Jonathan's voice was hoarse as he asked, "Where am I?"

Kyle replied, "This is the outskirts of Eldoria, at our great-grandmother's house."


Jonathan asked, "Did your family save me?"

Eileen giggled. "It was my mommy who saved you. How did you fall from such a high place?"

Jonathan's eyes instantly turned cold.


At that time, someone had tampered with his car. While driving on the mountain highway, it lost control and plunged off the cliff.

Fortunately, he had managed to jump out of the car before it crashed,rolling down the slope and being stopped by a tree, which slowed his fall.After that, he remembered nothing.

Was it their mommy who saved him?

Jonathan asked again, "Where is your mommy?"


"She went shopping."

"And your grandmother?"

"In heaven. It's just the three of us and Mommy here."


Jonathan casually asked, "Where's your dad?" The three kids fell silent. Zachary pouted. "Sir, you ask too many questions." Jonathan was speechless.

For the first time in his life, he was rebuffed by a child.

"Sir, have some water," Eileen said, handing him a cup."What's your name? Where are you from?"
Jonathan looked at the adorable little girl and couldn't help but soften. He took the cup and drank a few sips.
When he didn't answer, Zachary frowned. "Is he suffering from amnesia?"


Eileen was stunned."Amnesia?"

Zachary nodded. "Haven't you seen it on TV? Most people who have car accidents lose their memory. He probably did too. Otherwise, why isn't he answering?"

Jonathan was both amused and exasperated by these clever little kids.

Just then, the doorbell rang.

Eileen's eyes lit up. "Mommy must be back!"

The three kids ran off in unison. "Mommy!"

Eileen was about to open the door when Kyle stopped her.

The three kids paused and peeked through the door crack, seeing a stranger outside. "Who are you?" they asked in unison. "Hello, little ones. Where are your parents? I'm the cleaner your family hired..." Nola Rivera, the cleaner, was delighted to see the identical triplets. "Oh, we don't know. Come back later!" With that, the kids ran back inside.

Nola was puzzled.

What was going on?

Eileen turned back to Kyle. "Shouldn't we let her in?"

Kyle said, "Unless it's Mommy, we don't open the door for anyone."

Kathie hurried home, having been called several times by Nola. By the time she arrived, Nola had already left in a huff.

Kathie would have to find someone else.

As soon as Kathie walked in, Eileen ran up to her. "Mommy, the handsome man is awake!"

"Really? When did he wake up? Did he say anything?" Kathie asked.

She then put down her things and walked into the guest room.

Kyle and Zachary were there, while Eileen was reporting the situation and rummaging through a snack bag. Kyle and Zachary were also drawn to the snacks.
Kathie approached the bed, gently placing her hand on Jonathan's forehead to check his temperature.

Her sudden closeness made Jonathan inhale sharply.

He hadn't expected his savior to be such a young and beautiful woman. "Did you save me?" Jonathan asked. "Yes. You still have a slight fever. I'Il make some medicine for you to take." Kathie continued to examine Jonathan. Seeing him try to move, she said firmly, "Don't move. Your right leg and left arm are broken. You can't get up yet."


"What?" Jonathan was shocked. He hadn't realized his arm and leg were numb. He had narrowly escaped death, only to end up crippled?


Kathie looked at Jonathan's cold face and softened her voice. "Don't worry.I can heal you."
###Chapter 5 She Calls Him Seven

Listening to Kathie's reassurance, Jonathan still felt uneasy.

Aside from his family's private doctor, he found it hard to believe that someone so young could be highly skilled in medicine.

Seeing Jonathan's expression, Kathie raised an eyebrow. "You don't believe me? Fine, have your family take you to the hospital sooner rather than later, so you don't end up clinging to me."

Jonathan pursed his lips. It wasn't the right time to have someone come get him.

"When will my arm and leg heal?" he asked.

"Not sure." Kathie replied.

Jonathan was annoyed. "Didn't you say you could treat me? How come you can't give me a definite answer?"


Kathie withdrew her hand from examining him. "Watch your attitude.My kindness isn't unlimited. Give me your phone,and I'll call your family to pick you up."

She had known he would be difficult to deal with, and sure enough, he was.She should get rid of him quickly.

Jonathan awkwardly said, "I don't know." Kathie raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms and staring at him. Eileen pushed the door open and came in, excitedly saying, "Mommy! Did you bring back the dogs?" Kathie didn't answer, instead asking, "What's your name, and where are you from? The news said the CEO of the Berkeley Group,Jonathan,went missing after a car accident. Is that you?"

Jonathan calmly replied, "No."

"Really?" Kathie didn't believe it.

"Mommy, he has amnesia," Eileen interjected.

"Seriously?" Kathie stared at Jonathan's face. "Playing the amnesia cad?"

Jonathan freed a hand and suddenly realized he was naked, frowning. "Where are my clothes?"

"Your clothes were all torn. Wear this." Kathie tossed him two bags.

Jonathan's frown deepened. "You took off my clothes?"

"Who else?" Kathie pulled out some loungewear to put on him.

Jonathan felt a bit uncomfortable but had no choice. This woman had a fiery temper and quick actions.

Meanwhile, Shirley hurried home to wait for Randy. She was soothing her son while a few cleaning staff were tidying up.

One of the cleaners, Nola, grumbled, "You wouldn't believe it. Today, I went to a house where only three kids were home. They wouldn't let me in and made me wait forever.""That's so annoying. If they hire someone, they should have someone at home. What's their last name? We should avoid taking jobs from them in the future." Nola thought for a moment. "I think their last name was Cavendish too."

Shirley overheard and immediately asked, "What did you say?"

The cleaners exchanged glances, thinking, 'Oops, we forgot this family is also named Cavendish.
Unaware of the gossip,Kathie was busy.

After two days of tidying up and taking care of the man with a broken leg,she had no personal time left.

"Seven, take your medicine." Kathie placed the medicine bowl on the table.Since he was awake, he shouldn't expect her to feed him.

Jonathan frowned as he drank the medicine, then took a big gulp of water."Why do you call me Seven?"

Kathie popped a candy into Jonathan's mouth. "You won't tell me your name or address, so what else should I call you?"

Jonathan widened his eyes, helplessly watching Kathie leave. This woman changed her attitude so quickly.

After a while, Kathie brought some food and placed it on the table before leaving again.

Jonathan looked at the porridge and unknown dishes, frowning even  more. That day, Kathie bought an automatic wheelchair and had Jonathan sit in it. Seeing the nice weather, she pushed him outside to get some sun. A few days ago, Jonathan had an allergic reaction to pickled vegetables,breaking ouat in a rash that had just started to heal. Kathie found it strange. Kyle was allergic to pickled vegetables, and now Jonathan was too.
So, Kathie secretly took Jonathan's blood and compared it with Kyle's DNA.The result showed Jonathan wasn't the biological father of the children.
This put her mind at ease.

"Kathie, you shameless woman! You have a lover and still won't divorce!"Shirley shouted.

Her voice rang out, and Kathie raised an eyebrow.

They found her so quickly?

Jonathan looked up. "Who?"

Kathie smiled, ignoring his question, and asked, "Do you want to stay here or go inside?"

"Stay here," he replied.

Jonathan had finally gotten outside and didn't want to go back in so soon.

The plants hid his upper body, so people outside couldn't see his face.

The three kids heard the commotion and ran out. "Mommy, who's here?"

"Salespeople. Go back inside and don't come out," Kathie stopped them and then walked out to the gate. She saw Shirley's angry face and Randy behind her. They had found out where Kathie lived,but Randy had been on a business trip, or they would have come sooner. Randy only saw a man's silhouette and then noticed how beautiful Kathie had become, feeling a bit jealous.
"Kathie, who is that man?" he asked.

"None of your business," Kathie retorted.

Shirley sneered, "Kathie, you slut! You have another man,so why don't you divorce Randy and let us be together?"
Kathie coldly replied, "As long as I don't divorce, you'll always be Randy's mistress, a disgraceful nobody!"
"Kathie!" Shirley pounded on the gate. "You shameless slut! You slept with another man and had illegitimate children, and now you want to cling to Randy?"

Kathie's eyes turned icy. "Who are you calling illegitimate?"

Shirley felt a chill under Kathie's gaze but mustered the courage to say,"I'm talking about your three illegitimate kids!"

Kathie narrowed her eyes dangerously and opened the gate.

Shirley raised her head, ready to enter.

But Kathie put her fingers to her mouth and whistled. Three dogs came running at lightníng speed.

Shirley screamed,"Ah! Dogs!" Randy's face changed too. One dog bit his pant leg, making himyelp in pain as he tried to shake it off. "Three! Bite! Bite the bad guys!" Eileen clapped and cheered. "Four, chase! Five, run faster!" Zachary also cheered.

Hearing these names, Jonathan's eyebrow twitched.

So,that was how he got his name.

Randy,who was being chased by the dogs, had recently been recognized by the family and technically had to call Jonathan his cousin.
When Randy got married, Jonathan had attended the wedding.

Jonathan had arrived late and hadn't seen the bride, but he heard she ran away two months late, and Randy got involved with her stepsister,having a son.


Jonathan's face darkened, thinking, 'Could it be that Kathie is Randy's runaway bride?

Randy finally got into the car and saw the three kids at the gate, stunned by how much they resembled him.

"Kathie, these kids..." Randy called out.

Kathie snorted, cutting him off. "Don't worry. With your lowly genes,you couldn't have such adorable and outstanding kids. Now get lost!"

"Get away, damn dog!" Shirley screamed in fear. "Kathie, you bitch, get these damn dogs away!"

Randy opened the car door. "Shirley,get in the car!" "Kathie, you'll pay for this! I won't let you off! Ah! It's biting me! Randy,help me!" Shirley cursed as she ran to the car.
###Chapter 6 Seven, Your Ears Are Very Red

Watching the two scramble into their car, Kathie stood with her hands on her hips, shouting angrly, "Trash like you should be dealt with by dogs. If you dare come back and cause trouble again, I'll let the dogs tear you apart."


Shirley,both furious and in pain, cried bitterly, tears streaming down her face. "Randy, look at how she's bullying us. You have to get revenge for me."

Randy yelled back, "Kathie, don't get too cocky. Hurting people is against the law. I won't let you off."

Kathie was unfazed. "Get lost. If you keep yapping, I'll throw the dogs into your car and see how tough you are then."

Hearing this, the people in the car didn't dare to provoke her further. Both were injured and needed medical attention quickly.

"Kathie, you just wait. This isn't over," Randy retorted.

Kathie sneered,"It sure isn't."

Seeing she about to call the dogs again, Randy floored the gas pedal and sped away.

Jonathan leaned out slightly, surprised to witness such a dramatic scene.

"Is he your husband?" he asked. Kathie snapped back, "Absolutely not. A guy like him is a waste of space." Kathie snapped back, "Absolutely not. A guy like him is a waste of space." she had a whole battalion at her command.

"You seem to hate him. What about these kids?"

"The kids have nothing to do with him. Hate is too strong a word,but I definitely can't stand him."
Seeing his puzzled look, Kathie coldly reminded him, "We're not close,so don't pry into other people's business. Get well soon and leave. And by the way, I've kept track of all the expenses for taking care of you. You better not skip out on the bill."

Jonathan had firsthand experience of how stingy this woman could be.

The three kids clapped their hands in delight. "Mommy, you're awesome!You beat the bad guys!"

But Kathie wasn't happy. Shirley and Randy showing up meant that her peaceful days with the kids were over. If they found her today, they wouldn't stop coming back.

In the past, she could handle things on her own. Now, with three kids and an injured man with amnesia, she needed a plan to fight back.

"Remember, if any strangers show up, don't open the door," Kathie said.

Kyle patted his chest proudly. "Don't worry, Mommy. We didn't let the cleaning lady in last time."

Kathie was silent, thinking, 'Well, it's better to be cautious.' Zachary spoke up, "Mommy, if you're in danger, don't face it alone. Kyle and I are going to be heroes. We can protect you." Eileen, petting their dog Three, said sweetly, "I can help too, Mommy.I'll feed Three lots of food so it can grow big and protect you."

Kathie opened her arms and hugged her three treasures. No matter what difficulties they faced, they always got through them together. This time would be no different.

Jonathan was indeed curious. He had heard that Randy and his wife had been together for years and were very close. So how did Kathie end up pregnant with someone else's kids, and why did she disappear back then?

Who was the father of these children?

He had seen her calm expression earlier, clearly hiding something.

Night fell earlier in the suburbs. Today's incident didn't affect Kathie and her kids much. She put them to bed early.

Under the dark sky, a shadow approached the house but was scared off by the barking dogs, waking Jonathan inside.

Jonathan struggled to sit up in his wheelchair, peeking into the next room to ensure there was no movement before quietly heading out.

The dogs had gotten used to his scent over the past few days,so they didn't bark at him.

Jonathan saw a light flicker under a tree and wheeled himself over.

Ben Cooper emerged, looking guilty. "Sorry, I couldn't get in."

The plan was for him to meet Jonathan inside, but with the dogs around,he would have been a dead man if he tried to sneak in.
Jonathan understood Kathie's precautions. Living alone with kids in the suburbs, she needed to be vigilant. Dogs were more loyal than people and would never betray her.

"It's a relief you're okay. We all thought you were dead," Ben said,his eyes red.

Jonathan saw his red eyes. "Don't worry, I won't die. How's everything at home?"


"Your grandfather fainted when he heard the news. He's awake now but not doing well. Your father and brothers are taking turns watching over him,"Ben replied.

Just as he expected, his grandfather couldn't handle the shock.

"Go back and find a way to tell my grandfather I'm alive. He doesn't need to worry," Jonathan said.

Ben nodded. "Aren't you coming back with me? You're seriously injured.You should get proper medical treatment."

Jonathan shook his head. "I can't go back now. On the day of the accident,my route was changed, and my car was tampered with. Someone wanted me dead. I need to stay away to see what their next move is."

Jonathan knew this was no simple matter. As the young head of the Berkeley Family, he had many enemies.

Whoever benefited most from his disappearance was the culprit. Ben was worried. "What about your injuries? Should I secretly contact your private doctor?" Jonathan thought of Kathie's fierce face and chuckled. "The person who saved me is a doctor. If she can get me sitting up, she can get me walking." It was the first time Ben had seen Jonathan speak so highly of someone.He was about to respond when he saw a light turn on inside the house.
"Seven? Is that you outside?" Kathie asked.

As soon as Kathie spoke, Ben quickly hid behind the tree. Jonathan signaled for him to stay put.

"Seven, what are you doing out here?" Kathie asked again.

Ever since Jonathan learned the origin of his name, it felt awkward.He needed to find a way to change it.

Seeing her come out, he made up an excuse. "I heard the dogs barking and was worried those two might come back, so I came out to check."

Kathie's heart warmed. "I didn't expect you to be cautious. But don't worry, these dogs are trained. If any bad guys come, they'll be nothing but bones."

Ben, not far away, broke into a cold sweat. If he had tried to sneak in, he would have met a terrible fate.

This woman was terrifying. Jonathan better be careful.

"Ill push you back inside. You're injured and shouldn't move around. If you need anything, just call me," she said.
Kathie's soft hands pushed the wheelchair, and the gentle breeze carried her sweet scent, stimulating his senses. Jonathan fet like he had smelled this scent somewhere before, making his heart race. Kathie helped him back to his room. The light cast a soft glow on her, making her look even more beautiful, reminding him of that night four years ago, with the woman who had been so soft beneath him.
Even the memory made his body heat up. That night had been perfect.

"Seven, your ears are red. Are you feeling unwell?" Kathie asked.

She thought he might have caught a cold from being outside.

Jonathan smiled. "A man alone with a beautiful woman. This is a normal reaction for any man."

###Chapter 7 Aroused Desires

Kathie was worried Jonathan might be feeling unwell, but it turned out he had something else on his mind.
She placed a hand on his shoulder and teased, "Need a hand with that?"

Jonathan's face lit up with a smile, clearly pleased with himself. "Well, I wouldn't want to impose, Dr. Cavendish. But if you insist..."
Kathie pulled out a silver needle with a mnischievous grin. "It's no trouble at all. One poke from this, and I guarantee you'll never have those kinds of thoughts again."

Jonathan quickly covered himself, realizing that Kathie, with her medical skills and fiery temper, was not to be trifled with.

"I was just kidding! You didn't take me seriously, did you?" he asked anxiously.


"Are you sure you were joking? If you're really that uncomfortable, I can help ease your pain." Kathie smiled sweetly, but there was no humor in her eyes.

"No need. It's late, and it's not appropriate for us to be alone together. You should head back."

"Smart move." Kathie rolled her eyes and left, her soft voice lingering in Jonathan's mind,keeping him awake long after she was gone. As dawn broke and birds chirped outside, Jonathan opened his eyes and struggled to sit up. He tried to move his legs butfelt nothing. Had she lied about being able to heal him?

He slapped his legs in frustration,feeling no pain, and angrily threw a glass from the nightstand, shattering it on the floor.
The noise alerted Kathie, who rushed in to find him fuming.

"Breaking a glass means you'll have to pay for it. And let me remind you,this kind of behavior disturbs others and could scare my kids. Do it again,and I'll kick you out," Kathie said angrily.
Jonathan thought, 'This woman is both stingy and fierce,and now she is threatening to throw me out.'

"You said you could heal me. Why can't I move my legs?" he asked.

"Sir, I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker. Healing takes time, especially with serious injuries like yours. The fact that you can sit up and move your arms is already a miracle. If you doubt me, I can send you away right now," Kathie retorted.


She crossed her arms, clearly not eager to deal with a difficult patient.

Jonathan realized he was being impatient.

"As a doctor, can't you be a bit more compassionate?" he said. "If you want a doctor to coddle you, go to a VIP room in a fancy hospital where pretty nurses will chat with you. If you can't do that, then behave,"Kathie retorted.  Jonathan was furious, but Kathie couldn't help but laugh at his frustration. "Alright, your condítion requires time to heal. I keep my promises.If I say I'll heal you, I will. Just relax and cooperate with the treatment," she added. He had no choice but to endure for now.

Kathie pulled back the covers to examine him, only to see his morning erection. Her face turned red as she looked away.

As a doctor, she had seen this before, so why was she flustered now?

Taking a deep breath, she turned back to find Jonathan watching her with amusement.


"Dr. Cavendish, you should understand that morning erections are normal for men. This isn't me teasing you," he said.


When she didn't respond, Jonathan's deep voice filled the silence again."Could you bring my wheelchair over and help me to the bathroom? I'm a patient, after all."

Kathie,annoyed but efficient, brought the wheelchair, carefully helped him into it, and assisted him in the bathroom.


She spoke up, "My caregiver fees are quite high."

"Don't worry, name your price," he replied casually.

This woman was always talking about money, but he would pay her whatever she asked.

Kathie liked the sound of that. After tidying up his room,she went to prepare breakfast.

As soon as she left, a cute little girl peeked in. "Good morning, Mr.Handsome!"

Jonathan's heart melted at the sight of her. He felt an inexplicable fondness for these three kids. "Good morning, Eileen," he replied.

"Do you want some milk? Mommy says it helps you grow tall."

Jonathan,already six feet tall, didn't need to grow any more, but he nodded at Eileen's concern.

Eileen brought him a bottle of milk and climbed onto the bed to feed him.

Kathie walked in to see her usually reserved daughter smiling and feeding him milk with a straw. "Eileen, get down. What did Mommy tell you about staying away from strangers?"

Eileen shook her head cheerfully. "He is a good person. He won't trick me."


Kathie sighed, feeling her previous lessons had been in vain.

"If you give him the milk, what will Mommy drink?" Kathie asked.


Eileen grinned. "You both can share."

Kathie wouldn't drink after someone else. She gave Jonathan a warning look, picked up her daughter, and took her out for a stern talking-to.
After breakfast, Kathie started preparing today's medicine. Just as she finished, the phone rang.
Seeing the familiar number, she felt a mix of emotions as she answered."Grandma."
"Kathie, is that really you? Where have you been all these years? You disappeared without a trace and didn't contact us. Have you forgotten about your family?"
Though her grandmother's voice held a hint of reproach, it was mostly filled with joy.

"I'm sorry, Grandma. It's my fault. How could I forget you? I've missed you so much."
Kathie hated her biased father and her hypocritical stepmother, but her grandmother had always loved her dearly. She had planned to visither once she was settled, but things kept getting delayed.
"If you miss me, come back. Tell me if you're being mistreated.With me around. I won't let them bully you."
"Okay, I'll come see you as soon as I finish up here. Grandma, take care of yourself."
Kathie had expected her family to contact her after seeing Shirley yesterday.They knew her parents couldn't persuade her, so they sent her beloved grandmother instead.

They wanted Kathie to come back so she could divorce Randy, allowing Shirley to marry him.
Kathie hung up and turned to see Jonathan listening intently.

"Don't you have any manners? How can you eavesdrop on someone's call?"she said indignantly.

Jonathan, unbothered, wheeled himself over. "Do you call it eavesdropping when it's out in the open? You said it was time for my medication,and when you didn't come, I had to come find you. I just happened to catch you on the phone."

Kathie remembered and handed him the bowl of medicine. "Since you're here,drink it yourself." The foul smell hit his nose, and the dark liquid made Jonathan's hair stand on end.

"This medicine is too bitter. Can't you give me something more normal?"he said.


"No,you need to drink it now. If it cools down, it loses its effectiveness."Seeing his reluctance, Kathie teased, "I thought you were tough. Are you really afraid of a little medicine? My three kids are braver than you."

Jonathan sighed and took the bowl, knowing he had no choice but to drink it.
###Chapter 8 You Are Playing Me

Jonathan noticed the mocking smile on Kathie's face and couldn't help but ask."Is there really nothing you're scared of?"

Kathie tilted her head back proudly. If he thought he could get her to admit something, he was way off.

"Not a thing," she replied.

Jonathan frowned, took a deep breath, and downed the medicine.

The foul taste hit him hard, making his stomach churn. He almost threw up but managed to keep it down.

Seeing his pained expression, Kathie teased, "You finished it, didn't you?Want me to get you a piece of candy?"

Jonathan thought. 'Damn, this woman still treats me like a kid!

He lowered his head, a sly smile forming on his lips. He looked up, his gaze fixed behind her, and suddenly widened his eyes in feigned panic. "Watch out, there's a snake behind you!"

"Ah!" Kathie leaped into Jonathan's arms before she even realized what she was doing.

Luckily, she was petite, and Jonathan had regained enough strength in his arms. Otherwise, her jump would have undone all the progress they'd made in his recovery.

She clung to Jonathan's neck, too scared to look back, "Get rid of it, quick!"

Kathie had always been fearless, unbothered by mice or cockroaches, but she had a deep-seated fear of snakes. Jonathan had overheard her mention it to the kids once, and now it came in handy.

Feeling Jonathan's shoulders shake with laughter, Kathie slowly loosened her grip. Seeing his amused face, she turned around to find no snake in sight.

"You tricked me?" she said angrily.

Jonathan shrugged. "How could I? I was just testing. Seems you aren't entirely honest."

Kathie gritted her teeth. "Bastard!"

Jonathan laughed heartily, finally getting one over on her. She'd been giving him a hard time for days.

Kathie glared at him, her beautiful eyes practically glowing with anger.

Then she realized something was off. She could feel another heartbeat against her chest,a large hand on her waist, and her whole body felt like it was on fire.

She was in Jonathan's arms!

Kathie's cheeks turned crimson, and she practically jumped out of his embrace.

Jonathan felt a sense of reluctance as she pulled away. Her slender waist had felt so soft, and from that angle, he had caught a glimpse of her ample chest, sparking his imagination.

His gaze was so intense it feIt like it could burn through her.

Kathie couIdn't stay any longer. She turned to leave but was stopped by Jonathan.

"Didn't you say you'd get me some candy?" he asked.

"There's none left."


She wouldn't give him any even if she had some. Kathie realized that being around this man always made her lose control.

Kathie went to the backyard, where her three kids were preparing ingredients for lunch.


Kyle looked at her fłushed face and asked worriedly, "Mommy,are you okay? Are you feeling sick?"

Zachary chimed in, "I heard you scream earlier. Did someone bully you?"

Eileen ran over and grabbed her hand. "Mommy, your hand is so hot, and your face' is red like an apple."

Kyle's eyes lit up. "Did you kiss the handsome man?"

Kathie was speechless.

How did her son even know about such things?

She fannedI her face. "No, it was the medicine fumes. Kyle, don't say things like that, or I won't make your favorite food."

Kyle immediately behaved. "I'll listen to you."

"You guys keep working. I'll be in the kitchen," Kathie said.

As she went into the kitchen, Kyle called his siblings over."Zachary,did you notice? Mommy's acting weird. She wouldn't look us in the eye when she talked, which means she's hiding something."

They knew their mom well. Whenever she hid something from them,she had that exact expression.

"Yeah, and she seemed a bit shy," Zachary added.

Eileen. looking wise beyond her years, said, "Mommy spends all day with the handsome man. Of course, she's shy."

Kyle and Zachary exchanged jealous glances and asked in unison,"Who's more handsome,us or him?"

Eileen sweetly replied. "You guys are."

Even though Eileen liked Jonathan, she knew her priorities. She liked Jonathan because he made her feel safe, just like her mom did.

Kyle nodded in satisfaction. "That's more like it. Remember, the four of us have to stick together."

Zachary asked, "So what do we do next?"

Kyle eyed the basket of green onions and smiled. "He's been freeloading here. and Mommy's been treating him. He should help out."

Zachary agreed and immediately called Jonathan to the backyard.

Jonathan, feeling bored, was happy to help. "Tell me what you need."

Kyle handed him the basket and pointed to the cutting board on the stone table. "We're not tall enough. Can you chop these green onions? Mommy's making something delicious."

Jonathan had never set foot in a kitchen before, but now he was taking
orders from a bunch of kids.

"No problem." He then didn't think much of the task and started chopping.

Zachary noticed the pieces were too big and reminded him, "Seven, they need to be really fine."

Jonathan didn't suspect the kids had any ill intentions and tried to chop as finely as possible.


But soon, his eyes started to sting, and tears began to flow uncontrollably.He even sniffled.

Kyle and Zachary exchanged amused glances.

Kyle teased."Seven, I just asked you to chop some onions. Why are you crying? Do you think we're bullying you?"

Jonathan'was speechless.

He realized he'd been tricked. Who were their dad? These kids were so mischievous at such a young age.

Eileen saw Jonathan's red eyes and shouted toward the kitchen. "Mommy,come quick! The handsome man is dying!"

Jonathan felt awkward. She didn't need to exaggerate.

Kathie rushed out,seeing Jonathan with his eyes closed, tears streaming down his handsome face. It was both pitiful and funny.

"What happened?" she asked.

Zachary confessed, "Mommy, we asked him to chop some onions, but he doesn't know how and got them in his eyes." Kathie pushed Jonathan, who was in a wheelchair, to the sink. "Poor rich boy, experiencing real life must be tough for you. If you were stranded on a deserted island,you'd starve."

She couldn't help but mock him. All he did was play a little prank,and she held such a grudge.

Despite her words, Kathie wet a towel and gently wiped his eyes.

Being so close, Jonathan could smell her cool fragrance,which had a calming effect.

"How does that feel?" Kathie asked.

Jonathan tried to open his eyes, his vision blurred by tears. He looked at Kathie, thinking she might be the woman he had been with four years ago.

Kathie teased,"If people found outyou cried over chopping onions, they'd laugh their heads off."

Jonathan immediately dismissed the thought; it couldn't possibly be her!
###Chapter 9 This Woman is Fierce, Ruthless,and Vindictive
After a hectic morning, once the three kids were finally down for their nap,Kathie had to give Jonathan his acupuncture treatment and, of course,make him drink his medicine.

This time, she added a piece of candy.

"Here, drink up," she said, placing the candy in front of him.

Jonathan eyed the candy and asked, "How long do I have to keep drinking this stuff?"

Kathie thought for a moment. "At least two weeks. If you're not getting better, it could be over a month."

Jonathan looked at her, feeling hopeless. Hé had already choked down a bowl of the medicine that morning, and it made his lunch taste bitter. If he had to drink it for a month, how could he stand it?

Kathie couldn't stand adults who couldn't handle a bit of hardship, so she let him have it.

"You're complaining? Do you know how hard it is to find and prepare these medicines? These precious herbs, people offer me a fortune for them.and I still refuse. I'm treating you out of kindness, so be grateful," she said.

Kathie decided that tonight she would add an even more bitter herb to his medicine, so he could taste real bitterness.

Jonathan didn't say a word, already feeling scolded.

After a moment of hesitation, he conceded. "Fine, I'll drink it." This time, he didn't make a fuss and drank it all in one go. Apart from a frown, he had no other reaction.


"That's better. Now, I'm going to give you acupuncture. It might hurt a bit,so bear with it."

His legs were still numb that morning, and even though she was a miracle worker, he didn't believe she could make him recover so quickly. He didn't take her words seriously.


Seeing his skeptical look, Kathie didn't waste any more words. She took out the silver needles and inserted them into specific points. As her fingers gently twisted, the needles went deeper.

At first, Jonathan didn't feel anything and even started to doubt Kathie's skills.


But when the ninth needle went in, he felt a current run through his legs.Before he could feel happy, the current turned into a sharp pain.

It felt like countless hammers were pounding his bones, the pain twisting his face.


"What are you doing?"

"I told you it would hurt. You didn't take it seriously."

"But you didn't say it would hurt this much. It feels like you're taking revenge on me."

"If you keep talking like that, I might really take revenge."

Kathie didn't need to waste her time on such things to get back at him.

This woman was fierce, ruthless, and held grudges. Jonathan quickly calmed down. Despite the pain, the return of sensation meant his legs were improving.

Fifteen minutes later, Kathie removed the needles. Jonathan's legs were trembling, and this change excited him.

"I can really feelit. You're a miracle worker," he exclaimed.

"Now you should believe me. If you cooperate with my treatment, it won't be long before you can stand up."

Seeing the sweat on her forehead, Jonathan felt grateful for her focused effort.


"Thanks."

"It's rare to hear you say that. Rest well, we have another session tonight."

Kathie påcked up and left. Jonathan watched her leave, lost in thought.

Finally done with her tasks, Kathie returned to her room and lay down on the couch for a nap.

The quiet of the suburbs, far from the city's noise, was soothing. Apart from the wind, there were occasional bird calls.

In her half-asleep state, she felt like she was back on her wedding night.entangled with a man whose face she couldn't see.

The sensation was so real, her body heated up, feeling enveloped by a broad chest again.

Kathie squeezed her legs together. She often dreamt of that night,showing how deeply it had affected her. Who was that man?

Kathie had been troubled for four years, desperate to see his face. As the man was about to leave, she reached out and grabbed something solid.

"Don't go!" Kathie opened her eyes eagerly, only to see Jonathan's handsome face.

How could it be him?

Both of them were stunned.

Jonathan couldn't sleep in his room and had come to borrow some books.

Seeing her curled up on the couch, looking uncomfortable, he had knocked but got no response. Worried, he had entered, only to be grabbed by her.

Kathie let go and tried to compose herself. "I told you to rest. Why are you in my room?"

Jonathan moved closer, noticing her flushed face and the panic in her eyes.Then he understood immediately.

"Dr. Cavendish, having a naughty dream in broad daylight? Were you dreaming about me?" he teased.


Kathie panicked even more and stood up quickly. "Say one more word.and I'll stick needles ín you randomly."

"Your reaction says it all. You really dreamt about me, didn't you?"Jonathan was a bit pleased.

This was beyond embarrassing. Kathie would never admit to dreaming about him. "Why is the bold Dr. Cavendish suddenly speechless?"

"Do you want me to make you mute? Leave my room before I lose my temper."


Jonathan found it amusing. When she couldn't win an argument,she resorted to threats. She was not to be messed with.


But he was genuinely curious. "If you don't want to talk, just nod or shake your head. Give me a straight answer."

Kathie picked up a silver needle from the table, looking at him with a sinister gaze.

Jonathan didn't believe she would actually hurt him over this.

As they argued, the three kids walked in one by one.

"Mommy, oh, the handsome man is here too."

"Mommy,we're awake."

"Mommy,hug!"

Eileen reached out for a hug, and Kathie shot Jonathan a glare before picking her up.

Then she smiled. "Did you all sleep well?”

Eileen nodded sweetly. "Yes, we did."

Kathie's heart melted. "Good. Mommy has prepared some snacks.Wait here,I'll go get them."

She used this as an excuse to escape, avoiding Jonathan's questions.Left in the room, the kids stared at Jonathan. Eileen climbed onto his lap."Mr. Handsome, why are you in Mommy's room? Do you like her too?"

Jonathan was at a loss for words.

Zachary smirked. "Mommy smells nice. Who wouldn't like her?"

Kyle put his hands on his hips. "You can't take Mommy from us."

Jonathan was speechless.

He hadn't said a word, yet he was accused of liking their mommy and trying to take her awdy.

"Mr. Handsome, why aren't you saying anything?" Eileen waved her little hand in front of his face.

What could Jonathan say? They had cornered him.

"I'm just your mommy's patient. Once I'm better, I'll leave," Jonathan replied.

Eileen looked sad. "But you lost your memory. You don't remember your family. Where will you go? Just stay with us."


Jonathan glanced at Kyle and Zachary, who didn't seem to welcome him.He expected them to want him gone.


To his surprise, Kyle nodded. "Even if you can't help much, having a tall man as a bodyguard isn't bad."

Jonathan was speechless!

Zachary agreed, "People always try to date Mommy, and she hates it. You look good, so you can stay and be her shield." 
Kyle and Zachary had his role all figured out.

Outside the door, Kathie heard the conversation and couldn't help but laugh. Although Jonathan's presence brought her trouble, it also added some fun.


For years, she had raised the kids alone. feeling somewhat lonely and desolate.
###Chapter 10 He Mistook Her for the Womanfr om Four Years Ago
Jonathan's presence, in a way, filled a part of the void in Kathie's heart.

She cleared her throat. "Come on out and have some pastries."

Eileen immediately followed her out. At the door, she turned back and waved sweetly. "Hey, come on! Mommy's pastries are the best."

When Jonathan came out, he saw the three little ones all vying to feed Kathie.


He could tell they were drooling over the food, but they still gave the first bite to their mom.

It was the first time he had seen such a heartwarming scene. and he couldn't help but smile.

To him, even though Kathie was fierce,she had raised her kids well-they were smart and adorable.

The sun set.

Night always came a bit earlier in the suburbs.

After dinner, Kathie bathed the three little ones, and after a busy while,she tucked them into bed one by one. Then she went to the kitchen to bring Jonathan his medicine.


With the experience from the past few times, Jonathan held his breath and gulped it down quickly to avoid the smell. But this time, the medicine was so bitter he almost gagged. He frowned. "What's going on? This medicine is different from the one during the day."

Kathie smirked. "This is to help you recover faster. I just added one more ingredient."

Jonathan stared at her. "What did you add?"

Kathie answered honestly, "An herb that's a bit more bitter."

Sure enough, she was messing with him.

"You're too much. You're still holding a grudge from this morning."

"So what? Do you dare to mess with me again?" she said casually.

Jonathan thought, 'I really shouldn't have offended her! Especially since she's a doctor-she could find all sorts of ways to get back at me.'

He was always the one taming others, but now the tables had turned, and he was completely at the mercy of Kathie.

"No, Dr. Cavendish1, you have quite the methods," he replied.

Kathie took out a piece of candy as a reward. Jonathan's eyes lit up, and he quickly put it in his mouth. The sweet taste made him feel better again.

This woman was really something-first a slap, then a candy. She knew how to balance punishment and reward.

With the sweetness in his mouth, Jonathan managed to finish the rest of the medicine.

He had never suffered so much in his life, but here he had his fill. Kathie teased, "Not bad, you're growing."

Jonathan gritted his teeth. She still dared to make fun of him. He wiped his mouth, "I haven't had a proper bath in days. I feel gross."

Since Kathie had rescued him, he couldn't get his wounds wet,so he could only be wiped down with warm water.

The nights in the suburbs were cool, but the days were quite hot.Hearing him say this, there was indeed a bit of a smell.

Kathie deliberately covered her nose and teased, "Yeah, you do smell a bit."

Jonathan's mouth twitched. "I'm an injured person who can't move. If I smell, isn't it your fault as my caretaker?"

Kathie pushed him to the bathroom. "You didn't mention it, so how would I know how you feel? If you want a bath, just tell me anytime."

Kathie took off his jacket, revealing his eight-pack abs. His body proportions were perfect, the best she had ever seen.

She swallowed, helping him take off his pants and carefully guiding him into the bathtub.


The perfect water temperature made Jonathan relax completely.

"You can't move around too much yet, and you can't soak for too long.Call me when you're done," Kathie said.

Jonathan nodded, and she left to prepare other things.

The exhaustion of the past few days disappeared in that moment.
Although this place was small, the kids were noisy, and there was a fierce woman,Jonathan found it interesting. He had initially thought of leaving once he felt better, but now he didn't seem to have that plan.

His legs had regained some feeling. He wanted to try lifting them. Feeling some response, he used his hands to support himself on the edge of the tub,trying to stand.


But no matter how hard he tried, his feet wouldn't hold, and he kept slipping back into the water, splashing everywhere.

Hearing the commotion, Kathie rushed to the door, worried. "Hey,what are you doing in there? Are you done yet?"

Jonathan gritted his teeth. "Almost!" He refused to believe he couldn't stand.


Sensing something was off, Kathie pushed the door open just in time to see him fall out of the tub.


Without thinking, as a doctor, her first instinct was to rush forward and catch him.


But her small frame couldn't support such a tall, muscular man.She ended up being a cushion, preventing him from a hard fall.

They both felI to the floor, and Jonathan instinctively protected her head with his hands, preventing a concussion.

Jonathan's wet body was on top of her, and he was naked. The realness of it made Kathie's face flush. "Get up, you jerk."

Jonathan was speechless. "I want to, but I can't move right now."

He said that, but he didn't really want to get up. Her body was soft and melled nice. His heart was racing. Was it because he hadn't been with a woman for too long?

Considering he was injured, Kathie gently pushed him off, closed her eyes,and fumbled for a towel to cover him. "Do you want to die? If I hadn't come in just now, falling like that would have wasted all the treatment from the past few days and made your injuries worse."

Doctors hated disobedient patients the most, and he was one of them.

Jonathan was also scared. "Sorry, my bad."

Kathie sighed. She could understand an injured person's feelings, but this couldn't be rushed.

"I don't want this to happen again. You must follow my instructions strictly, or I'll send you away immediately. If you die here,I won't be able to explain," she said.

"Got it. Thanks for earlier."

Jonathan's cold heart melted a bit when she rushed over without hesitation.

The feeling of pressing against her was strangely familiar, almost making him think Kathie was the woman he had slept with four years ago.

Unfortunately,she wasn't!

Kathie struggled to get him back to the room, dried him off, and gave him acupuncture.

Since he had fallen, she didn't dare insert the needles too deeply.

The next morning, Kathie was packing some herbs, getting ready to leave. Eileen circled the table. "Mommy, where are you going?"

Kathie rubbed Kyle's cue face. "Mommy is going to see my grandma. You take care of your siblings." She glanced at Jonathan in the wheelchair,thinking he couldn't help anyway,so she kept quiet.

Jonathan was puzzled.

She was completely ignoring his existence, and that look was highly insulting.

"Mommy, I want to go with you," Kyle said.

"Me too. I want to see great-grandma," Eileen echoed.

Kathie gently reassured them, "Be good. Mommy has other things to handle today. I'll take you next time."

She didn't want the kids to see the shameless side of the Cavendish Family.Besides, she would definitely run into Randy and his mistress, and the kids would be a distraction.


Kyle, the most understanding, said, "Don't worry,Mommy. I'll take care of them. Come back soon."


Jonathan frowned and stepped forward. "Don't you have anything to say to me?"


Kathie thought for a moment.′′Ys.′′

Jonathan's eyes lit up, only to hear Kathie say, "Just don't cause any trouble."


Jonathan was speechless.
###Chapter 11 Genius Little Painter

Jonathan's intense gaze felt like it could pierce right through Kathie. How dare she ignore him?

Kathie glanced at the time, realizing she couldn't delay any longer. "Alright,Mommy's heading out. Behave yourself, and call me if you need anything,okay?"


The three kids watched their mom leave and obediently went back inside to read.


Eileen picked up a paintbrush and walked over to Jonathan. "Mr.Handsome, do you know how to paint?"

Jonathan's face lit up with pride. "Of course, I do! My paintings have been in exhibitions and sold for a lot of money."

Eileen's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Wow, I want to sell my paintings too,so I can help Mommy make lots of money."

Jonathan looked at the sketchbook on the table. She was just a kid; what couldI she possibly draw?

"Bring your sketchbook over here, and I'll give you some tips," Jonathan said.


Eileen handed over the sketchbook, and Jonathan was stunned the moment he opened it.

The treehouse on the first page had smooth lines and perfect color combinations, even the little flowers and grass were meticulously detailed.
This level of skill couldn't be achieved without at least ten years of practice. He continued flipping through the pages, each one more impressive than the last. It was pure genius.


Looking at the three-year-old Eileen in front of him, he couldn't help but laugh. "Eileen, kids should be honest. These drawings must be your mom's. At your age, you can't even tell the colors apart, let alone draw something like this."

Eileen answered earnestly, "I drew them."

Jonathan frowned, clearly not believing her. He was a naturally gifted artist,and he hadn't reached this level until he was ten. Could Eileen really be more talented than him?

Seeing that he didn't believe her, Eileen's eyes welled up with tears."I'm not lying."

Kyle rushed over. "Why are you picking on Eileen? These drawings are hers."


Zachary also defended her. "Eileen is amazing. She can even draw us. You're an outsider; what do you know?"


Jonathan was in disbelief. How could a three-year-old like Eileen, who didn't seem to have any formal training, be so talented?

Eileen took back the sketchbook and drew a picture of flowers right in front of him. If he hadn't seen the vibrant flowers and lifelike butterflies appear on the blank paper with his own eyes, Jonathan wouldn't have believed it was real.


Eileen said proudly, "Do you believe me now?"

Jonathan was in awe. "You're a genius. With proper training,you'll become a world-renowned artist."

Jonathan admired her talent and even felt a pang of regret, wishing Eileen were his daughter.


Eileen, rejuvenated by the praise, beamed with energy.

The Cavendish Mansion, located in the heart of the city, was a valuable property left to Kathie's mom by her grandfather. Now, it was occupied by a bunch of ungrateful people.

Kathie rang the doorbell, and the butler, Gary Reed, immediately recognized her. "Ms. Cavendish, you're back."

"Gary,long time no see," she replied.

Gary led her inside, where she saw her father, Walter Cavendish, and stepmother, Melissa Morris, chatting happily. Randy was holding Shirley intimately, while no one paid attention to Kathie's grandmother, Ophelia Bell,sitting in the corner.

Kathie once had a happy family, with a loving father and a caring mother.making her feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Her father had married into her mother's family. To preserve his dignity,Kathie's mom gave their children his last name. He sweet-talked her into transferring the company to his name, thinking it would keep him loyal.

When Kathie was seven, her mom was pregnant with their second child.The family was overjoyed, eagerly awaiting the new addition. But her mom died in childbirth, along with the baby.

Walter was devastated, and Kathie was touched by his apparent deep love.But less than two months later, he brought Melissa and her daughter into their home. At first, he lied, saying they were distant relatives staying temporarily, until Kathie caught him ánd Melissa in bed, revealing the truth.


Melissa was his long-time lover, and Shirley, who was only a year younger than Kathie, was their illegitimate daughter. Walter had betrayed the family long before.


Since Melissa moved in, she bullied Kathie behind the scenes while pretending to be a kind stepmother.


Kathie suspected her mom's death was suspicious and secretly investigated.
She discovered her mom's body had been covered in injuries, and the baby had died shortly after birth.

With advanced medical technology, it was unlikely her mom would die in childbirth. Unfortunately, the medical staff involved had all movéd abroad.Kathie spent years traveling the world, trying to find them.

If her mom's death was indeed connected to them, Kathie would stop at nothing to seek justice, no matter the cost.

Kathie took a deep breath to calm herself. Her grandmother, who had raised her after her mom's death, was the person she loved most.

"Grandma!" Kathie called out.

Ophelia turned around, delighted to hear her granddaughter's familiar voice. Seeing Kathie, she stood up despite her aching feet, tears of joy in her eyes. "Kathie, come here. I've missed you so much."

"Grandma, sit down. Don't move." Kathie ran over and hugged her tightly.

After Kathie left four years ago, Walter, encouraged by Melissa,sent Ophelia back to the countryside. Kathie often had people secretly take care of Ophelia, ensuring she enjoyed her later years.

Ophelia held Kathie's hand, gently caressing her face. "You've lost weight.It's good you're back. Don't leave again. I don't know how many more times I'll get to see you."

"Grandma, you'll live a long and healthy life. I'll stay with you as long as you want to see me," Kathie said.

Walter cleared his throat. His daughter hadn't seen him in four years, and she didn't even greet him. How disrespectful.

Kathie ignored him, treating him like he was invisible.


Walter had no choice but to speak first, "Kathie, you seem to be doing well.
I heard from Shirley that you have three kids. Why didn't you bring your husband and children to meet me?"

Since she left, Walter had never looked for her. What kind of grandfather was he to her children?


Melissa chimed in sarcastically, "Since you have a man, why are you still dragging out your divorce with Randy? You should finalize it soon,give your kids a proper status, and stop holding others back."


Shirley had given Randy a son, but since he hadn't divorced Kathie,Shirley and her child were considered illegitimate.

They had used Ophelia as an excuse to bring Kathie back, just to push her to divorce.

Kathie sneered, "What if I refuse to divorce?" Shirley couldn't hold back. "Don't be unreasonable. You're a mother now.
How can you let innocent children be labeled as illegitimate?"

Kathie was unfazed. "That's your problem, not mine."

Walter scolded, "Kathie, do you think you're too grown up for me to control? I'm your father. Today, you must divorce, or you won't leave this house."

Ophelia, furious, yelled at him, "What kind of father are you? I'm ashamed of you. If it weren't for Kathie's mom, you wouldn't have your current status. Shirley and Randy wronged Kathie first. They've never apologized,and you dare threaten Kathie? I'll beat you, you ungrateful bastard."

Ophelia threw a cup at him, but Melissa pretended to shield him. "Mom, if you want to hit someone, hit me. Don't hurt Walter."

Ophelia was too weak, and the cup fell at Melissa's feet without breaking.Melissa was just putting on a show for Walter.

Seeing Melissa protect him, Walter yelled at Ophelia, "You're just throwing your weight around because you're old. I think you should stay in the countryside and not come out."

Kathie couldn't take it anymore and shouted, "Shut up!"
###Chapter 12 Why Didn't You Die

"You ungrateful jerk! Grandma went through hell raising you, and you just dumped her in the countryside like she was nothing. Aren't you scared of karma?" Kathie yelled, her voice shaking with anger.

Walter's face turned red with fury.

Kathie used to be so obedient and sensible, but then she was defying him.Eventually, she left, and he felt a strange sense of relief, deciding to wash his hands of her.


Now, he wanted to help his preciouis daughter Shirley gain some recognition, so he forced Kathie to divorce. But seeing Kathie's defiant attitude, he realized this wouldn't be easy.

The tension in the room was thick, and Randy quickly stepped in to calm things down. "Everyone, let's chil out. We're family. We can talk this through. It's my fault for wronging Kathie, and I'm willing to make it right."

Kathie shot him a cold glare. "Get lost. This has nothing to do with you."


Shirley immediately jumped to his defense. "He's my man, the father of my child, Bob Berkeley. How can you say he has no right to speak? Your grudge won't change anything. The situation is what it is. Do you want to drag this out forever? It's not good for anyone."

Kathie shrugged. "So what? I don't care."

Shirley stomped her foot in frustration and turned to her father for help."Dad, look, no matter what we say, she won't listen. Bob is about to start school. Do you want him to be labeled  as an illegitimate child? What will people think of him?"

Walter tried to coax Kathie. "It's true they were in the wrong. Shirley,apologize to Kathie."

Despite her reluctance, Shirley had to compromise for the sake of her child and herself.

She pretended to be pitiful and said, "Kathie, I was wrong in the past.Please, for the sake of being Bob's aunt, show some mercy. I'll agree to any compensation you want."

Kathie looked at her fake face, wanting to tear off her mask of hypocrisy.

She sneered, "Ill divorce him, but I have one condition."

Hearing her relent, Shirley was overjoyed. "Kathie,just say it."

Kathie stepped closer. "I want to know who the man was that night. Don't tell me you don't know. On my wedding night, you got me drunkand had your affair with Randy in the next room. I heard you say to let someone into my room."

Shirley's face turned pale. No one knew about this, and Kathie had just exposed it.


Randy was shocked. "What's going on? Didn't you say Kathie was seducing men everywhere?"

Shirley denied it vehemently. "That's not true. She must have misheard."

Kathie laughed coldly. "If that's the case, then there's nothing more to discuss today, I might leave the country tomorrow, and who knows if I'll come back." The Cavendish family was quite prestigious. Shirley had worked hard to enter high society and wouldn't want to be labeled as an adulteress, nor would she want her child to be seen as illegitimate.

She urgently grabbed Kathie's hand and admitted through gritted teeth,"It was my fault. Please forgive me."

When Kathie discovered that the man she slept with wasn't her husband Randy,she truly hated Shirley.

But the birth of her three precious children healed Kathie's emotional wounds. Now, she didn't hate Shirley; she just wanted to find her children's biological father.

Kathie slapped Shirley, who didn't dare move.

"This slap is for you. Now tell me, who was the man that night?" Kathie demanded, her voice icy.

Shirley felt a pang of guilt. She had invited several sleazy men from the party that night and didn't know which one had entered Kathie's room.Or maybe more than one had.

To get Kathie to divorce, Shirley had to pick a memorable name."Itt was Tom Coleman."


Kathie vaguely remembered him as a greasy,balding middle-aged man who had been leering at her at the party. How could he have such good genes to father her three beautiful children?


"Are you sure you're not lying?" Kathie asked.

"He was outside that night. You can check the surveillance footage if you don't believe me.""You think I haven't checked? The footage from that time was destroyed."

Shirley was taken aback. She hadn't done that. "How about I call him now to confirm? I'm not lying."

"No need. I'll find a way to prove it." Kathie didn't want to make this public.

Shirley nodded. "I've done what you asked. Can you divorce Randy now?"

Kathie smirked. "No."

Shirley gritted her teeth. "You're going back on your word! You just agreed!



"Don't be so tense. You'll get more wrinkles. I'll deal with this once I figure everything out."

Kathie wasn't about to divorce until she knew who the man was. She needed leverage.

Shirley looked to her parents for help, but everyone knew Kathie's stubbornness. She wouldn't stop until she had answers.

"Let's give Kathie some tíme. I'm sure she'll consider your child's future,"
Walter said,playing the family card.

Kathie smiled as sheapproached him. Walter was always scheming.

"Dad,do you remember how Mom died?" Kathie asked coldly.

Caught off guard, Walter looked flustered but quickly feigned sadness. "Of course, I remember. Your mom died in childbirth, and we couldn't save your unborn sister. It's a pain I still carry." Kathie sneered, "Pain? I don't see it. Did you know Mom's body was covered in bruises? People heard a baby crying in the delivery room. How did they die?"

Walter turned pale and stammered, "The doctor said shewas in so much pain she rolled on the floor, causing injuries. The baby was crushed and couldn't be saved."

"So you believe that, or is there more to the story?" Kathie pressed.

Melissa clenched her hands. Seeing Walter struggle, she stepped in. "Kathie, when I had Shirley, I was in so much pain I hit the wall.She almost didn't make it..."

"Then why didn't you die? Are you going to say Shirley almost didn't survive too?" Kathie cut her off, making Melissa's face fall.

Walter shouted, "Enough! The past hurt everyone. I don't want it brought up again."

Kathie retorted, "You don't want it broughat up, or you want to hide the truth? I'll find out what really happened. If Mom and my sister were murdered,I'll make those responsible pay."

Melissa stepped back, not understanding how Kathie had uncovered this.

Walter, furious, waved his hand. "Stop spouting nonsense. If you don't want to stay,leave."

Kathie calmly pulled out a will from her bag. "I came back for a reason.Look closely. This house was left to my mom by my grandfather. After I was born, she transferred it to mne, My name is the only one on it."

Walter was stunned. He had forgotten about this, having always seen Kathie as obedient and overlooked this detail.
###Chapter 13 The Rebellious Daughter Wantsto Revolt
 Kathie used to do whatever he said, even giving him shares, which let
Walter control seventy percent of the company and do whatever he wanted.

"So what? I'm your dad. You really gonna kick me out?" Walter couldn't believe she had the nerve.

Kathie nodded. "Yep. that's exactly what I'm doing. I don't want Mom looking down from heaven and seeing you jerks living in her house.Except for Grandma and the housekeeper, everyone else needs to be out today. If not, don't blame me for what happens next."

Walter was shaking with anger. "You ungrateful brat, are you rebelling?"

Kathie laughed coldly. "Yeah. I am. What are you gonna do about it? I've already warned you. If you don't leave, I'll use force. It'll be all over the news. or I'll call thecops. Let's see how shameless you can be then."


Melissa, not wanting to give up such a nice mansion, tried to sweet-talk her. "Kathie, we're family. We can't let outsiders laugh at us. If you need money, just say the word, and I'll give it to you."

"Family? When you were hitting and yelling at me, you didn't say that. I'll be back tomorrow at this time. If you're still here, you'll face the consequences." Kathie's words were firm, leaving no room for negotiation.

Ophelia stayed quiet, feeling proud to see KKathie standing up for herself.

Kathie turned to Ophelia and smiled. "Grandma,you can stay here. I'll move in with the kids soon, and we won't be separated anymore." If Walter and Melissa hadn't pushed too far. Kathie wouldn't have taken back the villa so soon. But since they wanted to kick her grandmother out,they had to go first.

"Alright. Kathie. I will wait for you to come home," Ophelia said.

After giving instructions to the housekeeper, Kathie left, leaving the others fuming.


Shirley grabbed Randy's hand. "Why aren't you going after her? We finally got her here. You have to find a way to divorce her."

Randy's feelings had changed. He had never seen such a confident and strong woman. Kathie's bold demeanor was very attractive.

"Shirley, you owe me an explanation for what happened back then. You lied to me," he said coldly.

"I was drunk and confused at the time. I didn't know what I was doing.You shouldn't be focusing on that now. You should be thinking about giving our child a proper status," Shirley quickly explained.

She used their child to shut him up.

Randy frowned. The child's issue was indeed more important."T'll figure something out."

Melissa stomped her foot in anger, clinging to Walter's arm and crying. "Honey, what do we do? That bitch Kathie wants to kick us out. Are we really going to give her this house? I don't agree."

"Yeah, Dad, isn't there anything we can do?" Shirley naturally didn't want to leave. Walter had a headache and turned to his silent mother, Ophelia. "Mom,Kathie listens to you the most. Maybe you could..."

"Shut up. I don't want to hear you speak right now. This is all your own doing." Ophelia cut him off immediately and turned to go upstairs.She only listened to Kathie now and acted as if she didn't have this ungrateful son.


With the only person who could help gone, Melissa said viciously, "Kathie is useless. We can't count on her. We should have sent her back long ago.Honey, we're not leaving. I don't believe Kathie really dares to kick us out."

Walter glared at her. "The Hughes family is still involved with the company. If things get messy now, it won't be good for me.We have other properties. We'll just move there."

He felt a pang of guilt. He had followed Melissa's advice to harm his ex-wife,thinking he could keep everything for himself. But he hadn't expected to lose even the child.

Seeing Kathie's strong stance earlier, if the truth came out, his fate would be grim, and the Hughes family wouldn't let him off.

In the afternoon, at the suburban estate.

Eileen, just waking up, grabbed a comb and hair tie and went to Jonathan's room, calling him in her sweet childlike voice, "Mr. Handsome,my hair's a mess. Can you help me comb it?"

In the morning, the three kids had prepared a simple lunch. Even though it was just bread and eggs, Jonathan was impressed by how independent such young children were. Now that he finally had something he could help with, he was happy. Jonathan smiled. "No problem. I'll make you look beautiful."

Eileen climbed onto his lap. "I want a bun, like the one Mommy makes for me."


Jonathan fell silent.

He had spoken too soon. A bun seemed difficult to do.

"If you don't knowy how. I can teach you. First, braid it like this, then twist it up and tie it together." Eileen demonstrated with her little hands.

Jonathan smiled awkwardly. "I'll try my best."

Jonathan had thought combing hair would be easy, but as soon as he ran the comb through, Eileen yelped in pain. "It hurts. You have to comb gently, or you'll pull all my hair out."

Seeing a few strands of hair in his hand, Jonathan felt guilty and carefully combed her hair. When he felt resistance, Eileen's pained expression made him want to cry. Combing hair was too hard.

He had no choice but to slowly untangle it with his hands before combing again.

"Tell me if it hurts," Jonathan said gently.

"Okay, thank you," Eileen replied.

Her soft voice melted his heart. He wasn't a patient person, but he never got tired of these three kids.


After nearly an hour, her hair was finally smooth, and Jonathan let out a sigh of relief. But then Eileen handed him the hair tie. "Now you need to braid it and make a bun."

Jonathan's mouth twitched. "Eileen, I think you look pretty with your hair down. How about we skip the bun?"

Eileen shook her head. "I like buns. You don't know how to do it, do you?



He couldn't admit that. He reluctantly tried to braid her hair, but no matter how he twisted it, it wouldn't take shape. It was harder than dealing with an enemy. Who on earth thought of this absurdly difficult-to-style hairdo?

After much effort, he finally managed to twist the braid into a bun, but it didn't look like a bun at all!

Eileen stood in front of the mirror. "Mr. Handsome, why does the bun you made look different from Mommy's?"

"It is a new hairstyle. You're the first to have it." Jonathan lied to a child for the first time, finding it harder than negotiating a business deal.

"Does it look good?" Eileen asked innocently.

Jonathan nodded, lying through his teeth. "It looks great. You're so cute,any hairstyle looks good on you."

Eileen happily ran out to show her brothers. "Look at my hair."

Zachary laughed. "You look like you have a bird's nest on your head. It's hilarious."

Kyle laughed too. "I think it looks more like a dog's nest. How can someone make hair look like that?" Eileen pouted. "You guys are mean. Mr. Handsome didI this new hairstyle for me, and it's very cute."

###Chapter 14 Sexual Harassment

Kyle shook his head. "Your hairstyle looks terrible. He's probably just making stuff up 'cause he doesn't know how to do it."

Eileen pouted, refusing to listen.

Zachary turned on the TV. "If you don't believe me, watch how they do it on TV."


As soon as the TV turned on, there was a sudden crackling sound from above,followed by the smell of something burning.

Eileen saw smoke coming from the plug, with faint sparks, and panicked. "
It looks like it's on fire! Seven, come quick!"

Jonathan rushed out at the sound of her voice. He heard a sound and all the appliances went off, but the smoke was getting thicker. This was a sign of an impending fire; the power needed to be cut off immediately.

"The wiring's burnt. Where's the main switch?" he asked.

The three kids looked bewildered, running around the room in a panic.

Jonathan raised his hand to calm them. "Don't worry. Think about where your switches are, or if your mom told you not to touch certain places."

In this old house, worn-out wiring was a common issue. If not dealt with promptly, it could lead to a fire.

Kyle remembered something and pointed to a cabinet in the corner of the living room. "I saw Mommy turn on the light over there before and told us not to touch it." Jonathan wheeled over quickly and found the main switch. HIe bent down,despite the discomfort, and turned it off. "It's okay now. The power's off.We just need to replace the wiring to get the electricity back."

Jonathan checked the house inside and out. Several wires and the meter were burnt. If they hadn't caught it in time, the consequences would have been dire.

To avoid any further risks, Jonathan took the kids outside to the yard, so they could escape quickly if needed.

"Seven, it's a good thing you were here today. You were actually useful,"Kyle admitted.

Zachary agreed. "I'll never say you can't do anything again. Thank you."

This incident had brought them closer together.

"We live together, so we should look out for each other. Now, call your mom and ask her to get an electrician. Otherwise, we'll be in the dark tonight." Jonathan replied.

Kyle took out his phone and called Kathie, who answered immediately.

"Kyle, do you miss Mommy?" Kathie asked gently.

"Mommy, the wiring at home burnt out. It almost caught fire."

Kathie's heart skipped a beat. "Are you all okay?"

"Don't worry, Mommy. We'refine. Seven turned off the main switch in time. He said you should call an electrician."

Kathie felt relieved. She hadn't expected him to be so helpful. It he hadn't
been there, she couldn't imagine what might have hannened "Got it. Listen to Seven's instructions. I'll be home soon." Kathie then called an electrician and hurried home.

The old house hadn't been lived in for over a decade. When she moved in.she only had it cleaned and forgot to have the wiring checked. If this had happened at night, it could have been dangerous.

When Kathie got home, the electrician was already working,and Jonathan was waiting in the yard with the kids.

"Mommy's back!" Kyle ran up and hugged her.

Kathie's worry faded as she saw her children's smiling faces.

After comforting the kids, she walked over to Jonathan, remembering how dismissive she had been that morning. Now, he had been a huge help.

"Seven, thank you for today." Kathie said appreciatively.

Jonathan smiled. "No big deal."

Eileen tugged at her mom's hand. "Mommy, Seven's clothes are all dirty.You should help him change."

Seeing the dirt on his clothes, Kathie realizedI he must have gotten it while checking the wiring.

"You kids play in the yard. I'll help him change," Kathie said.

Kathie wheeled him inside and found clean pajamas, placing them on the bed.


Jonathan said, "I'm itchy from the dirt. I'd like to take a shower first."

Kathie warned, "You can shower, but don't pull any stunts like last night." Jonathan teased, "If you're worried, you can help me."


"In your dreams!"

"I hurt my hand checking the wiring. I can't move it well."

Reluctantly, Kathie agreed to help him this time, considering he had taken care of the kids.


She filled the bathtub and adjusted the temperature before wheeling him in.

"Can you undress yourself?" Kathie asked.

"It's hard. My hand won't bend."

Kathie sighed and helped him undress. "Did you do Eileen's hair? If she went out like that, she'd be embarrassed for life."

She had,almost laughed when she saw her daughter's hair earlier,knowing exactly who had done it.

Jonathan felt helpless. "That's the best I could do. I spent over two hours on it. Don't be so critical."

At least he had been patient.

Kathie said, "It wasn't bad, but don't do it again."

Jonathan fell silent.

She was crushing his confidence again.

Kathie helped him take off his pants, instinctively turning her head.Her hand accidentally brushed against his penis, and she quickly pulled back as if shocked. "Dr. Cavendish, isn't this sexual harassment?" Jonathan teased.

Kathie blushed. "What are you talking about?"

"You touched me while I couldn't move," Jonathan said seriously.

Kathie gritted her teeth. "I'm a doctor taking care of a patient. Any contact is within normal bounds."

Jonathan teased, "So,you often touch men at work?"

Kathie was furious and didn't want to argue. She yanked off his pantsand prepared to help himinto the tub.

But she slipped, and with Jonathan's weight, they both fell into the tub,splashing water everywhere.

Kathie choked on some water. When she looked up, Jonathan's'head had tilted down, and his lips were on hers.

For a moment, they stared at each other.

Jonathan had never been this close to a woman before. The feeling was incredible. That night, he had been drugged and didn't feel.much.

"Ah! Mommy and Seven are taking a bath and kissing!" Eileen's scream snapped Kathie back to reality. She pushed Jonathan away and climbed out.


Jonathan looked at her,still wanting more. "Dr. Cavendish, I don't mind if you touch me."

Kathie thought, "That's so shameless!I didn't mean to touch him at all, it was purely an accident! "You wash yourself. I'm going to change." Kathie said awkwardly.

Kathie then left, her face red, feeling her heart race. The places he had touched felt warm.

What was happening to her? Was she really craving a man because it had been so long?

She needed to calm down. She had to find out who the kids' father was first.

Inside,Eileen was vividly describing what she had seen. "It's true!Mommy and Seven were taking a bath and kissing!"

Kyle thought for a moment. "Is Mommy trying to find us a dad?"

Zachary agreed. "I saw on TV that girls marry guys to repay them. Maybe Mommy wants to marry Seven because he helped us today?"
###Chapter 15 The Kids Want Jonathan to Be Their Dad
Eileen was ecstatic. "I like Seven. If he becomes my daddy, I'm all in."

Thinking about today. Kyle realizedJonathan was impressive. "Mommy's been single for so long. If she likes him. I'm not gonna object. But isn't he disabled? We can't have Mommy taking care of him forever."

Zachary chimed in. "Mommy said he'll be able to walk in two weeks. He's not really disabled."

Kyle raised a serious concern. "We might all accept him, but isn't he suffering from amnesia? If he's already married with kids, he can'tbe with Mommy."

The three siblings sighed simultaneously, resting their chins on their hands.Making their mom happy was proving to be quite a challenge.

Eileen looked disappointed. She really liked Jonathan and wanted him to be their dad.

Kathie changed into fresh clothes and went to the bathroom, where Jonathan was soaking in the tub, unmoving.

"Hey, I need to wash my hair," Jonathan said.

"You sure have a lot of demands," Kathie said impatiently.

Kathie placed a towel on the edge of the tub and had him lean his head back.

She was wearing a loose nightgown, and as she bent over, the hem lifted slightly. Through the gap, Jonathan caught a glimpse of her toned stomach and pink underwear. Her breasts were quite full, not at all what one would expect from a mother of three.

Sensing his gaze. Kathie looked down and caught him in the act. "Seven,do you want to lose your eyes?"

Jonathan looked innocent. "What are you talking about? I don't understand. Should I close my eyes?"

Kathie was at a loss for words. She had only seen him look up, which didn't necessarily mean he was staring at anything specific.

She adjusted her clothes, tucking her top into her pants, which only accentuated her perfect figure.

Jonathan's eyes were glued to her rounded breasts, filled with undisguised admiration.

"Don't get any ideas, or Ill make sure you lose your manhood," Kathie warned.

c shook his head. She had a face that could launch a thousand ships, yet she spoke such harsh words.

When she was silent, she was serene. But once she spoke, it was like the end of the world.

"Can we start now?" Jonathan asked.

"You better close your eyes, or if soap gets in them, you'll be crying again."

Jonathan felt she was using this as an excuse to get back at him. "That's a threat."

"My conscience is clear," she said, squeezing shampoo into her hand. Jonathan obediently closed his eyes to avoid any mishaps.

He had expected Kathie to be rough, but she was surprisingly gentle.Her fingers massaged his scalp, making him relax completely.

Jonathan was shirtless, his head tilted back. From his neck down, his muscular body was free of any excess fat, his chest well-developed, and his skin glistening with water, giving off an indescribable allure.

He was tall and handsome, and she had even dreamed about them making love. The thought made her blush.

Feeling the movements on his head stop, Jonathan opened his eyes and met Kathie's gaze, filled with desire.

Jonathan smirked. "Are you planning to do something to me?"

Kathie snapped out of it and increased the pressure of her hands. "Stop talking nonsense. Close your eyes, I'm going to rinse."

Jonathan winced and closed his eyes. She was ruthless, not only denying everything but also bullying him.

Kathie finished washing his hair, gave his body a quick rinse, and helped him back into his wheelchair, then wheeled him to his room.

"Lie down. I'm going to prepare your medicine," she said.

"Are you going to add more bitter herbs? I didn't do anything wrong.You were the one teasing me."

Kathie wanted to poison him mute. How could there be such an annoying man in the world, who played innocent after taking advantage?

"If you don't want it to be bitter, keep quiet. I know what I'm doing,"she ad retorted.

Kathie went to the kitchen to prepare the medicine and called for Zachary,the little hacker genius. Despite his young age, he could crack a system in the time it took to eat a lollipop.

"Zachary. Mommy needs detailed information and a phone number for Tom from the Coleman Family. How long will it take?" Kathie said.

Zachary waved his small hand. "Piece of cake, five minutes tops. But why do you need it?"

"I'm just curious. Let me know when you find it." Kathie didn't want the kids to know until she had everything figured out.

She checked on the medicinein the kitchen, and soon Zachary had the information.


"Mommy, it's done," Zachary said proudly.

Kathie quickly came out. She saw on the computer that Tom was even fatter than before and completely bald. Looking at her three kids with their thick hair, there was no way they were related to him.

She hadn't refuted it at the time because Tom had been at the scene, so he must know something.

Zachary handed her a piece of paper. "Mommy, here's the phone number."

Kathie ruffled his hair. "Zachary, you're amazing."

Even though she didn't believe Tom could be the father of her three kids,she was still nervous. What if he was? Kathie went to the backyard to make the call, her heart pounding.

Tom answered quickly. "Hello? Who is this?"

Kathie took a deep breath. "Mr. Coleman, this is Kathie. Four years ago, I married Randy at the Aurora Grand Hotel. You attended as a guest.Do you remember?"

Her heart pounded so hard it feltlike it would leap out of her chest.

The other end responded excitedly, "Of course I remember."

His voice was so enthusiastic. Could something have really happened?

Kathie suppressed her unease. She had to ask him in person.

"I'd like to meet you tomorrow to talk about that night. Are you available?"she said.


"Sure,anytime."

"Great, I'll send you the location tomorrow."

"I'm looking forward to it."

Kathie felt heavy-hearted. His reaction was unusual. They had only met twice and had no real connection, yet he spoke as if they were close.

He was even looking forward to meeting.

If he were a stranger, he wouldn't say such things.

This feeling made her uneasy. If her three kids were really his, Kathie would be devastated.

After calming herself, Kathie took the medicine to Jonathan. As she approached the door, she heard Kyle interrogating him1. "Seven, are you married? If you have a wife and kids, you can't deceive our mom."

Jonathan was helpless. When had he ever deceived their mom? Apart from pretending to have amnesia and hiding his identity, he had been honest.

"I'm not married," he replied.

Zachary asked. "But you have amnesia. How do you know you're not married? Are you lying to us?"

Jonathan frowned. Zachary was a tough nutto crack. He almost fell for his trick.

"I just have a feeling. If I had a wife and kids, I'd remember."

Eileen was also worried. "Seven, even though I really like you, if you have a family,we can't break it up."

Jonathan firmly assured them, "I definitely don't."

"So, what kind of woman do you like? Do you think our mom, who's a total beauty, is your type?" Kyle asked.

Jonathan rubbed his forehead. They were so straightforward, clearly trying to set him up with Kathie.

"Your mom is great, but she's too fierce. I like gentle and obedient girls.like Eileen here," Jonathan replied.

Eileen beamed and hugged his arm. "I like you the most too."

Kyle shook his head and looked at Eileen, sighing, "You get infatuated every time you see a handsome guy. Aren't you afraid he might be a kidnapper and take you away?"
###Chapter 16 This is Simply a Question of Life and Death for Him
Zachary said, "Mommy's really nice, not mean at all. You only got scolded'cause you made her mad."

Eileen sided with Jonathan. "But Seven is right, sometimes Mommy can be mean to me too."


Kyle,looking disappointed ín Eileen, said, "You never think, do you? It's always 'cause you're being disobedient that Mommy has to teach you a lesson. She's doing it for your own good."

Eileen, not backing down, retorted, "Anyway, Seven isn't a bad person.You can't talk about him like that."

Zachary looked disgusted, "We don't like him talking about Mommy.You shouldn't take a stranger's side."

If Kathie didn't step in, her three little ones would start fighting. Though they usually got along, they were still kids and had their disagreements.When Eileen couldn't win an argument with Kyle and Zachary,she
tended to get physical.

"Alright, that's enough," Kathie said, stepping in.

She glared at Jonathan. "Seven, you really know how to stir things up. You've only been here a short time and already turned our house upside down.
"

Jonathan felt wronged, thinking, 'God knows, I didn't even get a chance to speak while they were arguing.

.Eileen grabbed her hand, "Mommy, don't blame him. He said you're really nice,and he's not married. Maybe you should control your temper and be with him." Kathie coughed twice and glared at Jonathan. Ever since he arrived, her sweet daughter had been defending him.

Jonathan shrugged helplessly. "It's all her own idea."

Kyle pressed, "So, are you saying you don't like Mommy?"

This was a life-or-death question for Jonathan. If he said he didn't dislike Kathie, the three little ones would definitely try to set them up. If he said he did, he might not survive the night.

Kathie raised an eyebrow, curious to hear his answer.

Zachary added, "Mommy isn't mean, but she does hold grudges."

Jonathan knew this better than anyone. Last time, he scared her once,and she made his life miserable for a whole day. He couldn't afford to offend her.

He had no choice but to humble himself. "A guy like me,with amnesia,injuries, and no money, isn't worthy of your mom. I'm not good enough."

Kathie nodded in satisfaction. "You're right. You better keep that in mind.If I find out you have any inappropriate thoughts,I'll deal with you."

Kathie put down the medicine bowl and led the kids out.

Jonathan felt a huge sense of relief. Life in this house was anything but easy.

The next day.

Kathie got up early to prepare lunch. She had to meet Tom and clear up what happened four years ago.

After yesterday's incident, she checked the house inside and out before leaving. She had only met Tom twice before and never really talked. She initially arranged to meet him at a coffee shop, but he said he was busy with businessat a hotel and asked her to meet him there.

To save time, Kathie took a cab to the hotel.

At the hotel, she waited in the lobby until Tom messaged her to come to his room.

Kathie laughed coldly at the message. His intentions were too obvious.


Despite this, she went to his room as instructed.

She rang the doorbell, and as expected, a bald, overweight man opened the door.He looked even worse than in his photos.

Tom's eyes lit up with a lecherous gleam when he saw the beautiful Kathie.
His expression was downright sleazy.

"Ms. Cavendish, please come in," he said.

As soon as Kathie stepped inside, she heard the door lock behind her.


The room had only a large bed, no place for business discussions. There was no way he was conducting business here.

"Mr. Coleman, you should know why I'm here today," Kathie said coldly.

Tom ogled her, practically drooling. He had seen many beautiful women,but Kathie was a rare gem.


"Of course, you're here to sleep with me. That night four years ago must have left quite an impression on you."

"So,it was you that night."

"Of course. I still remember how soft your body was, and all the positions Kathie felt nauseous hearing his vulgar words but held it in to continue questioning, "Who sent you that night?"

Tom thought for a moment. "No one. We were all drinking and decided to prank the bride and groom. I saw you lying alone and couldn't resist."

As Tom moved closer, Kathie dodged nimbly.

"And my dress that night, you tore it?" she asked.

Tom leered at her and said, "I was too eager. I'll be gentle this time, I promise."

He reached out, but Kathie slapped his hand away.

Tom wasn't angry; instead, he perversely sniffed his hand.

"Smells good. If you like, you can keep hitting me. I won't fight back."

"Now that I know what happened, let's talk. I had a few kids. When will you acknowledge them and pay child support?"

Tom's face stiffened. To appease her, he pretended to agree.

"Sure, after we sleep together, I'll take care of everything."

"You're not lying?"

Tom eagerly nodded, unbuttoning his shirt. "I swear. Come here, let me kiss you."

As he leaned in, he suddenly felt his body stiffen. He couldn't move, only his head. He looked down to see several silver needles in his body.

He tried to struggle but felt intense pain. Kathie sneered, "Don't move, or you'll damage your acupoints and become disabled."

"What did you do to me?"

Kathie held a silver needle in front of him. "I'm a shaman now. These needles can save or kill."

Tom hadn't known this and thought he was in for a good time, not risking his life.

"Don't do anything rash. I'm the father of your children," he said fearfully.

Kathie slapped him. "You think I'll believe anything you say? You're not the man from that night."

"I am!" Tom insisted.

Kathie slapped him again. "I was wearing a wedding dress,not a gown,and it wasn't torn. How could you forget that? When I mentioned having kids, you looked disdainful. What father reacts like that?"

Tom shook his head frantically as Kathie held the needle close.

"Stop lying, or I'll make you blind," she warned.

"Shirley sent me. She wanted to ruin your reputation so you'd leave Randy.



"Why didn't you enter the room?"

"I was going to, but someone knocked me out. I woke up on the stairs and don't know what happened."

Both Shirley and Tom admitted to the plot, but there was more to that night. Unfortunately, the surveillance footage was destroyed, and she couldn't find the person responsible.
###Chapter 17 Conquering the Three Treasures

If it weren't for the fact that the school needed the parents' information for enrollment, Kathie wouldn't have bothered tracking down the guy she hooked up with four years ago.

"If you remember anything, just let me know," Kathie said disdainfully.

Tom nodded frantically. "Yeah, I got it. Can you let me go now?"

Kathie pulled out the silver needles, and Tom's body slowly started to feel normal again.

Seeing Kathie about to leave, he lunged at her with open arms. "You think you can just walk away after coming all this way? You messed with me,now it's my turn to show you what I can do."

Kathie sighed, thinking, 'He's asking for trouble!' Calmly,she took a smooth stone from her bag and threw it with precision, hitting Tom on the head and causing blood to flow instantly.

While waiting for him in the lobby earlier, Kathie had already guessed Tom's intentions. She worried that the silver needles might not be enough,so she had picked the largest stone from a flowerpot in the lobby, which now proved useful.

Rolling up her sleeves, Kathie declared, "Today, I'm going to show you that I'm not someone to be messed with!"


Tom yelled, "Help! Someone's trying to kill me! Help!"

At 4 PM, in the small yard of Kathie's villa in the suburbs of Eldoria.

The three kids were in the kitchen preparing afternoon tea.

Normally, Kathie wouldn't be out this long, and since she hadn't returned yet,they had to fend for themselves.
As for Jonathan, he was just supervising.

But seeing the three of them fumbling around, it seemed he wasn't much of a cook either.

Eileen looked at him with wide eyes. "Seven, I want a fried egg, but Mommy told us not to touch the stove."

Jonathan smiled. "Do you want me to fry an egg for you?"

He had a look that said, "Do you think I can?"

Eileen nodded earnestly. "Yes, you try. I've seen Mommy do it, I can teach you."

Jonathan was speechless.

Having a kid teach him to cook felt a bit off.

Zachary scoffed, "Forget it, he can't even chop scallions, how could he fry an egg? He only knows how to eat."

Jonathan was silent.

He didn't like hearing that. Being looked down upon by a kid was a bit insulting.

Kyle sighed,"If only Mommy were here. I'm so hungry and don't want to eat dry food. Next time, I'll make sure Mommy teaches me how to use the stove."


Jonathan advised, "That's not safe. You're too young,and it could cause an accident."

The three kids looked at him in unison. "Then what should we do?"

Jonathan felt a sense of helplessness. Faced with their expectant eyes, he had no choice but to try frying an egg. "Alright, I'll give it a shot. Go get the eggs."

He could handle billion-dollar projects, surely frying an egg wouldn't defeat him.

Eileen clapped happily and led her brothers to the fridge to get the eggs.

"Seven, Mommy puts oil in the pan first. When the oil is hot, she adds the egg. If you're afraid of getting burned, you can crack it into a bowl first and then pour it in gently."

Kyle added, "Don't move it right away. Let it set beforeflipping it. When both sides are golden, it's done."

Zachary was already drooling. "I like my eggs with a runny yolk, don't cook it too long."

"I want mine medium-well, crispy on the outside," Kyle also requested.

Eileen was more accommodating. "I'm fine with anything!"

Jonathan felt immense pressure.

Jonathan first looked up a tutorial on his phone, then turned on the stove and added oil. When the oil started to sizzle, he quickly cracked the egg into the pan.

But within seconds, smoke rose from the pan, and a burnt smell filled the air.

Jonathan hurriedly flipped the egg with a spatula, but it was already charred.

.His face fell. The first attempt was a failure.

Kyle frowned. "Did you use too little oil?" Jonathan took a deep breath and added more oll. Eileen waved her small hand. "Too much oil makes it greasy. You've filled half the pan,"

Zachary chimed in, "We kids need to eat light."

Jonathan clenched his fists. These kids were hard to please. He poured out some oil and tried again.

As expected, the egg burned again. Despite using enough oil,something was still wrong.

Jonathan had always had smooth sailing in life, except for this incident.This was a new kind of setback.

"Can you do it or not? You've wasted two eggs already," Zachary doubted him.

Jonathan forced a smile. "No worries, we can feed it to the dog."

Kyle shook his head. "Even the dog wouldn't eat this."

Jonathan was silent.

Eileen tugged on his hand, encouraging him. "You can do it. Keep trying."

Jonathan was determined not to let these kids look down on him.He washed the pan, turned on the stove,and added oil again.

When the oil sizzled, he added the egg. To avoid burning it, he flipped it quickly, but it ended up a mess.

He saw disappointment on the kids' faces and gritted his teeth.

Kyle suddenly said, "I remember Mommy doesn't use such high heat."

'Jonathan looked at him with a pained expression. "Why didn't you say so earlier?" "I didn't think you wouldn't know. Every adult I've seen can fry an egg,"Kyle replied.

Jonathan took a deep breath. With the previous attempts in mind, he had a better idea now.

Following Kyle's advice, he used low heat and gently added the egg. After ten seconds, he flipped it, and it turned golden.

"Wow! You're amazing."

"Seven,you're awesome."

"The egg is ready!"

Amid the kids' cheers, the first fried egg was done. Though not perfect, it was edible.

Jonathan'crossed his arms, striking a chefs pose. "Not so hard,huh? Give it a try."

The kids eagerly grabbed their spoons and tasted it.

Jonathan waited for praise, but Kyle's comment deflated him."You forgot the salt."


Jonathan was silent.

He had been so focused on the technique that he forgot the seasoning.

Eileen suggested, "We can add some soy sauce."

Zachary,really hungry, poured some soy sauce on it, and it tasted fine.

Seeing the empty plate, Jonathan regained his confidence. "Wait here, I'll 'make sure you eat well."

The next egg with a runny yolk was ready. The medium-well egg was also done.

Finally, a double-yolk egg for Eileen.

Jonathan never imagined he'd become so skilled at frying eggs.

The kids ate everything,giving him thumbs up.


"Delicious! You're amazing."

"Almost as good as Mommy's."

"I want more!"

Jonathan was so pleased with their praise, it felt better than closing a billion-dollar deal.

With the eggs in the fridge used up, night fell.

The kids sat in the yard, their bellies full.

Jonathan noticed it was getting late. Where was Kathie? Was she planning to leave the kids with him?

"Kyle, has your mommy called?" he asked.

Yesterday,she had called several times to check in, but today there was no word.


Kyle shook his head. "No, let's call her."

###Chapter 18 Kathie is Ruthless

Kyle went back to his room to grab his phone and called Kathie, but no one answered.

Zachary was curious. "Mommy always picks up right away. Why isn't she answering? Did something happen to her?"

Eileen slapped his hand. "Don't say stuff like that. Mommy's probably just busy and didn't hear it. Keep calling."

Kyle motioned for them to stop arguing. This time, someone finally picked up, but before he could speak, a man's voice came through,"Hello?"

Kyle was taken aback. "Who are you? Why are you answering my mom's phone?"

"This is the police station. Ms. Cavendish has been detained for assaulting someone and causing injury. She needs to be investigated," the voice said sternly,making Kyle panic.

"You must be mistaken. My mom wouldn't hurt anyone," Kyle replied.

Hearing the child's sweet voice, the officer patiently explained, "Your mom injured someone, and the victím wants to press charges."

Kyle put down the phone, tears welling up in his eyes.

"Kyle, what's going on?" Zachary asked.

Kyle,holding Zachary and Eileen's hands, said worriedly, "Mommy's been taken to the police station. I need to go get her out. You two stay here."

He grabbed his coat and was about to leave when Jonathan stopped him."·Hold on. You're just a kid. How do you plan to get your mom out? Do you think the police will listen to you?"
Kyle was frantic. "Then what should we do? We can't let Mommy go to jail."

Eileen started crying. "I can't be without Mommy."

Zachary comforted her. "Eileen, don't cry. Mommy will be okay."

Jonathan reassured them, "Don't panic. Think about someone you can rely on. Call them for help."

Kyle nodded. "Mommy said if anything happens, we can call our godmother. She'll help us no matter what."

Jonathan praised him. "Good. Call her and tell her what's going on. Ask her to go to the police station for you."

Kyle quickly called their godmother, Melinda Brooks, and explained the situation.

Melinda, upon hearing what happened, rushed to help, which eased the kids' worries a bit.

Jonathan looked at his phone. "Kyle, take Zachary and Eileen to take a bath. I'll wait here for news."

Seeing Kyle hesitate, he added, "Your mom must be exhausted dealing with this. If she comes back and still has to take care of you, it'll be too much for her."

Kyle realized he was right. "You're right. We shouldn't add to Mommy's burden. Zachary, Eileen, let's go take a bath."

Despite his young age, Kyle showed a sense of responsiblity,which was comforting.

Once the kids left, Jonathan called Ben. Ben had been waiting for his instructions and answered immediately, "Mr.Berkeley."

"Ben, find out what's going on with Kathie at the police station."

"Got it, Mr. Berkeley. I'll call you back."

Jonathan was curious. Kathie was tough and a bit unreasonable, but she wouldn't hurt anyone. Something didn't add up.

Five minutes later, Ben called back. "Mr. Berkeley, I've found out. Ms.Cavendish injured Tom from the Coleman Family. He's in the hospital with a broken hand and head injuries. He's pressing charges for attempted murder."


Jonathan was silent.

It seemed he didn't fully understand Kathie's fierce side. She really did a number on Tom.

But he couldn't let her go to jail and leave the kids without their mom.

"Contact Tom and make sure he drops the charges. Get Kathie released immediately."

"Got it. I'll take care of it," Ben replied before hanging up. Jorathan then deleted the call record from his phone.

At the poice station, Kathie was trying to explain her side of the story to the officers.

"Officer, I've already told you, it was self-defense. He tried to assault me,and I acted in a panic," she said.

The officer showed her a report. "This is the hospital's report. Mr.Coleman was immobilizedby acupuncture needles before you injured him.You could have left, so why did you hurt him?" Kathie was frustrated. "He tricked me into his room to assault me. I used the needles to protect myself. When I was leaving, I removed the needles,but he attacked me again. I was defending myself."

"But you have no injuries, while he has a broken hand and head wounds,"the officer pointed out.

Kathie argued, "Your job is to protect the vulnerable, not just take his word and convict me."

The officer said,"This matter needs further investigation. But the fact is, he's seriously injured and pressing charges for attempted murder.You should prepare a lawyer."

Kathie was exasperated. She had acted out of anger and hadn't expected Tom to press charges.

"If this isn't resolved, will I go to jail?" Kathie asked.

The officer nodded. "You're currently detained and will face legal consequences."

Kathie bit her lip. Just then, the officer's phone rang. After answering, his expression changed.

Kathie felt uneasy. The officer smiled slightly. "Ms. Cavendish, Mr.Coleman has dropped the charges. He stated it was an accident. You can go."

"Really?" Kathie couldn't believe it.

The officer nodded and had her sign some papers before letting her leave.

Kathie remembered Tom's angry face and doubted he would let this go.Why had he suddenly dropped the charges?

As she left the station, she saw Tom at the corner. His hand wvas in a cast, and his head was bandaged. He looked pitiful.

She expected him to confront her, but he apologized, "Ms. Cavendísh,this was all a misunderstanding. I won't pursue it. Please don't hold it against me."

This was too strange. Kathie asked directly, "Didn't you say you'd make sure I spent my life in jail? Why the sudden change?"

Tom smiled bitterly.It was because Ben from the Berkeley Family had threatened him. If he made things difficult for Kathie, the Coleman Family would be ruined.

He had tolie. "I'm a parent too. I don't want your kids to be without their mom."

Kathie didn't believe his kindness. "Who put you up to this? You knew about the past and claimed to be my kids' father. Someone must have told you."

Tom, having been nearly ruined by Shirley, didn't hide the truth.

"It was Shirley. She said if you went to jail, she could force you to divorce Randy and then pay me off," he said.

So it was Shirley.She would do anything to climb up.

"I'll deal with her. As for you, take care," Kathie said coldly.

Kathie hadn't been hurt and had already dealt with him, so she let it go.

Tom,relieved,quickly left. This made Kathie even more suspicious. What could make him, injured, come to apologize? It wasn't out of guilt; he was clearly threatened.

But who could scare someone like Tom from the Coleman Family? Kathie was still pondering when a car horn interrupted her thoughts.She turned to see her friend Melinda waving.
"Kathie, you're free! I even called a friend to bail you out," Melinda called out.

She had contacted a lawyer friend to help as soon as she heard.
###Chapter 19 When Did You Develop This Hobby
Kathie looked puzzled and asked Melinda, "How did you know I was here?



Melinda opened the car door and cheerfully invited her in. "Kyle called me.He said you were in trouble, so I rushed over."

Kathie smiled knowingly. Kyle was always reliable.

After getting in the car, Kathie called her kids to let them know she was safe. Hearing Jonathan's voice for the first time made her feel at ease.
Even though he often made her angry, having an adult at home to look after her kids was a good thing.
"Kathie, what happened? I heard Tom was going to accuse you of murder,but then he suddenly let you go? When I arrived, I saw him bowing and apologizing to you. It's so strange," Melinda asked.
Kathie shook her head. "I can't figure out why he suddenly let me go either. But this whole thing was Shirley's plan. She wanted to get me imprisoned to force me to divorce Randy."

Melinda angrily slapped the steering wheel. "Shirley is truly shameless.She seduced Randy back then, ruined your reputation, and now she dares to scheme against you. What are you going to do?"

Kathie smiled. "To deal with someone like Shirley, I have to hit her where it hurts the most. She did all this to force me to divorce Randy. If I don't divorce him, she won't have the chance to marry him. She'll remain the mistress, ridiculed by everyone, and her son will be labeled a bastard,humiliated by others."

"What about your kids' schooling?" "Don't forget, as long as I'm not divorced, I have a legal husband. The kids can enroll in school under his name, which will infuriate a lot of people."
Melinda clapped her hands in approval. "That's a great plan. It completely cuts off Shirley's path. She'll go crazy."
If Shirley hadn't gone too far this time, Kathie wouldn't have considered making Randy the legal father of her children. But given the circumstances,she had no choice but to be ruthless.
Kathie smirked. "I want to see Shirley and her daughter go mad with desperation."

"I'm with you. I even have a gift for you."

Kathie looked puzzled as Melinda pulled out her phone and,played a video. The video showed a man and a woman, both naked,having wild sex, as explicit as a porn movie, making anyone blush.
Kathie laughed and cried at the same time. "Melinda, since when do you have this hobby? If you want to watch porn, do it at home."

Melinda laughed. "You think I'm showing you porn? Look closely at the woman's face.See who she is."

Kathie looked carefully and her eyes widened. "Isn't that Melissa? She's cheating on my dad with another man."

"And a young man at that. I did some digging. He's a new employee at the Cavendish Group. He didn't even graduate high school, yet he became a manager right after joining. He must have put in a lot of effort with your stepmother."

Melinda worked at a headhunting company and had connections in all the major corporations in Eldoria. She had people keep an eye on Melissa and informed her as soon as they had any news.

Kathie couldn't believeit. Melissa, who always kept Walter so happy,dared to cheat.

"You've really helped me out," Kathie said.

"Not just this guy. There are several handsome male executives at the Cavendish Group who have a thing with your stepmother. She's quite something,getting both young and old."
"If she weren't so cunning, how could she have climbed from a remote village to her current status? She even caused my mom's death. Once I find the evidence, I'll make sure she pays."
Melinda nodded firmly, anger in her eyes. "You're right. Melissa dared to harm your mom. I won't let her get away with it. If you need,anything from me,just ask."

"I'm really glad you came today. Thanks for driving me back."

"No problem. I want to see the three little ones too."

Over the years, Melinda often visited them, bringing lots of gifts for the kids. Besides their mom, Kathie, the three little ones adored their godmother the most.

Meanwhile,at Maple Grove Residence.

Walter had moved Melissa and her daughter there this morning. It was half the size of the Cavendish Mansion, and Melissa was furious, cursing Kathie for their situation.

Shirley was helping with the luggage, constantly checking her phone for updates. "Mom, it's already evening. Why haven't we heard from Tom?"

Just as she finished speaking, the doorbell rang. Melissa sent the maid to answer it. and soon she brought in an Injured Tom.
Shirley looked puzzled. "Mr. Coleman, what happened to you?"

Tom, furious, slapped Shirley across the face. "You wretch,you got me into this mess. Kathie beat me up like this. If you don't compensate me,P'II call the cops on you."
Melissa quickly stepped forward. "Mr. Coleman, how can you just hit Shirley like that. If Kathie beat you, you should sue her. Why come to us?"
Tom roared."How dare you bring that up? She has powerful people backing her. We can't touch her. If you hadn't dragged me into this, I wouldn't be in this state. Where's Walter? Let him come out and settle this."

Melissa çouldn't let Walter find out about this, so she quickly transferred some money to Tom.
"Mr. Coleman, the money is sent. We were wrong this time. Please bear with us," Melissa said.

Tom took the money and left without further fuss, glaring at Melissa and Shirley.

Shirley stomped her foot in anger. "Kathie got away again. Who's protecting her?"

Melissa patted her shoulder. "We need to stay calm. Kathie knowvs we schemed against her. She'll definitely take action next. We need to be prepared."

Just as she finished speaking, Kathie called.

Melissa signaled Shirley and put the call on speaker. "Kathie, you injured Mr. Coleman. He came to us for compensation. We've already paid him. You should thank me," Melissa said.
Kathie was amazed by her shamelessness. "Melissa, should I thank you or send you a commendation letter? You're such a good person."
Melissa was speechless. Kathie continued, "I've seen many shameless people, but you're the first who acts innocent and good while being shameless. He confessed everything. You still want to deceive me?"
Shirley was furious. "No matter what, we paid a sum of money. You should cover it."

Kathie reorted, "Shirley, are you an idiot? Why don't you call the cops and say you hired him to assault me, but he got beaten up and wants compensation? Let's see who the police make pay. You might even end up in jail."

Shirley was speechless. Kathie continued, "I'm calling to inform you that I've decided to enroll my kids in Elite Tots Academy under Mrs. Berkeley's name."

"What? No way. If your kids take that spot, what about my son? Mrs.Berkeley's identity belongs to mne." Shirley was on the verge of losing it.

Kathie mocked, "Only you would treasure the title of Mrs. Berkeley. This is my last resort. You brought this on yourself. You can continue being the mistress. Your son will always be an illegitimate child."

"Kathie, you..."

Before Shirley could finish, Kathie hung up. When she tried calling back,Kathie had already blocked her.

Shirley screamed, "No, she absolutely can't do that. Mom,you have to help me think of something." She had planned to use Tom to get rid of Kathie, but Kathle turned the robles.leaving them at a disadvantage.
###Chapter 20 Kathie Has No Taste

If this issue isn't resolved and Kathie used Randy's wife's name to secure a spot for her child at Elite Tots Academny, Shirley's son won't have a chance to attend.

Shirley had already boasted that if her son couldn't go to Elite Tots Academy,they would be the laughingstock of everyone.

Melissa was also troubled. "How did Kathie become like this? We used to control her easily, but now we can't do anything about her."

"Whatever it takes, we have to stop her!" Shirley couldn't bear to be a joke.

She had spent the last four years under the scrutiny of others. She pretended not to care, but it bothered her deeply.

Who liked being laughed at? She also wanted to become Randy's wife in a grand manner and have her son recognized as Randy's legitimate child.

"I'm coming," Randy's voice came from the entrance.

Shirley quickly ran out and grabbed his hand at the doorway. "Randy,something's happened."

Randy asked anxiously, "What's going on?"

"It's that witch Kathie. She got upset today and said she won't divorce you.She wants to use the name Mrs. Berkeley to enroll her illegitimate children at Elite Tots Academy, making our son look like a bastard."

Hearing these harsh words, Randy frowned.

Shirley might be a socialite, but she had no manners. She only knew how to scream and curse when things went wrong.

"Kathie is still your sister. Even though we don't know who the father of her children is, you're still their aunt. It's not right to talk like this," he said.


Shirley,hearing him defend Kathie, looked displeased. "Are you feeling sorry for her? She's not my biological sister, so she has nothing to do with me. As for her illegitimate kids, they don't deserve to call me aunt if they're trying to take my son's spot."

Randy's face darkened. How foolish had he been to fall for such an unrefined woman?


"Enough. All you do is curse. You're a mother too. How would you feel if someone called your son a bastard?" he said coldly.

Shirley started to cry. "You know how hurtful it is to be called a bastard,yet for four years, you haven't given us any status. Now you're defending them. What are you thinking? If you don't want to be with us, let's just break up'and go our separate ways."

Randy was infuriated, but Melissa quickly intervened. "Randy, don't be mad. Bob is your son, and Shirley is just looking out for his future. Don't forget, in the Berkeley Famíly, it's our support that has helped you."

Thanks to the Cavendish Family's support, Randy had a place in the Berkeley Family. He had chosen Shirley because of her family's wealth and influence.


But now. Shirley's behavior disgusted him.

"Melissa, I understand. I'll handle it," he replied.

Shirley rolled her eyes, clearly not believing him.

Randy's eyes darkened. He needed to think this through carefully.

At the Eldoria household, the lights were bright. The three kids were overjoyed to see their mom return.

Kyle ran up first. "Mommy's finally back."

Eileen hugged her leg. "I missed you, Mommy."

"Me too, I missed you too," Zachary said, hugging her other leg.

Kathie kneIt down and embraced her three kids. "Mommy missed you too.
I brought a surprise for you. Look who's behind me."

The three kids curiously looked towwards the car. When they saw Melinda getting out, they screamed with joy.

"It's Aunt Melinda!"

"Aunt Melinda's here!"

"We missed you, Aunt Melinda!"

The three kids ran to her, and Melinda opened her arms to hug them all. ”My darlings, I missed you too. I brought lots of gifts for you.Come and get them."

Inside, Jonathan heard there were guests and put on a mask. He couldn't reveal his identity yet.

The kids were thrilled, carrying their gifts inside.

Melinda noticed Jonathan in a wheelchair, wearing a mask and looking weak.

"Kathie, aren't you worried about having a strange man in your house?"Melinda asked.

Before Kathie could respond, Eileen said, "Seven is a good person. He helps us. He even made us eggs today and cooked dinner." Kathie was surprised. "He can cook? Was it edible?"

Jonathan remained silent.

Not only did she not praise him, but she also doubted him. Kathie really had no taste.

Zachary thought for a moment. "The food wasn't fully cooked, and the dishes were bad. but the eggs were good. I ate three."

Kyle agreed. "We feel safe with him around."

Eileen brought out sbme eggs from the kitchen. "Mommy, he saved two eggs for you in case you were hungry."

Kathie felt a warmth in her heart. She hadn't expected him to be so helpful.
Yesterday, he had helped her with a dangerous situation at home,and today he took care of the kids.

Melinda,feeling the warm atmosphere, couldn't help but say, "The kids like him so much. Why don't you two get together?"

Jonathan coughed, making Kathie unhappy.

"What, you think I'm not good enough for you? And why are you wearing a mask at home?" she asked.

Jonathan chuckled. "It's not that. I got a burn on my face while cooking.so I put some ointment on."

Realizing he was taking care of the kids, Kathie showed concern. "I'll check it for you later."

Melinda, seeing the kids were fine, felt relieved. "It's getting late. I should go. I'll visit again. Kathie, take care of yourself and call me if you need anything." Kathie walked her to the door. The day's events had left them little time to catch up, so they planned for another time.

The kids were busy opening gifts in the living room. Kathie went to Jonathan's room, where he had already taken out his pajamas.

"Dr. Cavendish, could you help me with a bath?" Jonathan asked.

"Your hair is greasy too. I'll wash it for you," Kathie replied.

Kathie noticed he was a mess, unlike his clean appearance in the morning.Taking care of kids was indeed messy, even for men.

Kathie prepared the hot water and undressed him, leaving only his underwear.

Jonathan suggested, "Why don't you help me take off my underwear too?It's uncomfortable to bathe with it on."

Kathie blushed. "You have hands. You can do it yourself.Why ask me?"

Jonathan, seeing her blush, teased, "I've been busy all day, and my hands aren't steady. Are you shy? Didn't you say it's normal to have contact with patients?"

Kathie shot him a glare. "I'll do it."

Kathie couldn't let him think less of her. She reached to pull down his underwear,turning her head away.

Jonathan suddenly asked gently, "Did you handle everything today?"

Kathie instinctively turned back, just as she pulled down his underwear,and saw his penis.

Kathie,shocked,pushed Jonathan into the bathtub. She thought. 'Oh my God, what did I just see? It is so embarrassing!

Jonathan choked on water. "Are you trying to kill me?"

Kathie,flustered,tried to stay calm. "What are you talking about?"

Jonathan argued, "You peeked at my penis and pushed me into the water
when I caught you. Isn't that trying to kill me?"
###Chapter 21 The Woman Who Made JatanBow Down
Hearing Jonathan's words. Kathie felt an overwhelming urge to dunk his head in the bathtub. One moment he moved her,and the next she wanted to strangle him.

Seeing her furious glare. Jonathan cleared his throat and tried to regain his composure.

He hadn't forgotten that his life was still in the hands of this fiercewoman,Kathie.

"Tm a guy. Even if you peeked, it's no big deal. I won't hold it against you this time." Jonathan said casually.

Kathie was about to explode. He made it sound like she was some pervert spying on him.

"I'll say it again, I didn't see anything," she retorted.

"If you didn't see anything, why are you so worked up? I don't mind, so just take a good look," heteased.

Kathie was speechless.

"You soak in the tub. I'll go make you some medicine. And I'll add a few more ingredients to help you recover faster. You probably won't be able to speak for a week," Kathie said with a hint of menace.

Jonathan fell sílent.

Now he regretted provoking her. Why did he have to mess with her?

He just found it amusing to tease her and couldn't resist.

"Dr. Cavendish, I take back everything I said. You're generous and kind- 
hearted. Please don't hold it against me." Jonathan pleaded.

Kathie was the first woman to make Jonathan back down.

For his own safety, he had to play along. If his old friends saw this, they'd laugh at him endlessly.


Kathie tilted her head, ignoring him. She didn't believe she couldn't handle him.


As Kathie walked out, Jonathan continued to plead, "Dr. Cavendish, you need to show some medical ethics and compassion. I'm an injured man."

Kathie had already left. Jonathan let out a long sigh, hoping she wouldn't add that bitter-tasting medicine again.

After drinking the medicine for a few days, he felt significantly better. He hadn't expected Kathie's concoctions to be so effective.

In the middle of the night, a few cat meows came from outside.

Jonathan opened his eyes, his expression displeased.

He put on his jacket, clímbed into his wheelchair, and snuck out. Under a tree ahead, a faint light signaled him. It was Ben.

Five cat meows were their secret code.

Jonathan yawned and said with a stern face, "You really know how to pick a time."

Ben sighed, "Forgive me. There are three big dogs in the yard. I didn't dare get close. During the day, Dr. Cavendish and her kids are around, so I had no chance to come over. I had to wait until night."

Jonathan knew Ben was loyal. Given the current situation, they had no other way to meet. Ben handed him a phone. "I think you should keep a phone on you. That way,we can stay in touch."

"Good idea!" Jonathan accepted it.

He usually had to coax Kyle to use a phone, which wasinconvenient.

"How's my grandfather doing?"

"Following your instructions, we told him the truth. He's very happy. To avoid suspicion, he's still staying in the hospital."

In the family, Jonathan's grandfather cared about him the most. Years ago,he had faced immense pressure to make Jonathan the heir, which many people resented.

"How's the investigation on the car?"

"Someone went to the garage that afternoon and tampered with your car.The person wore a black hood, so we couldn't see their face. We're tracking them."

"My garage is guarded 24/7. Didn't the security notice?"

"The security guard went missing that day. I found a large sum of money from an overseas account in his account. Recently, there have been signs of him abroad."

Jonathan's eyes turned cold. These people wanted him dead.

"You need to find that security guard. He's crucial. The mastermind won't let him live."

"You mean they'll silence hím."

Jonathan sneered, "Exactly. He's just a disposable pawn. They sent him abroad to deal with him quietly." Ben nodded. "Understood. I'll get people on it."

"Who's making the most noise in the family right now?"

"Your uncle Gerald Berkeley and his son. He wants your cousin Harold to take over."

Just as Jonathan suspected. Gerald was greedy and always wanted to seize the family assets. If Jonathan was out of the picture, his son Harold could take over.

"He wants Harold in charge, so he'll target the major shareholders."

Ben nodded. "Yes, he's meeting with shareholders privately,offering them more dividends to buy their shares. If he succeeds, even if you return, it'll be hard to take back the company.What should we do?"

No wonder Ben came tohim in the middle of the night. He was worried about this.

"Let him think he's winning. Contact the shareholders and have them pretend to comply,giving Gerald a chance."

"Isn't that too risky?"

"I want them to think they have everything under control. Only then will they get complacent. When they let their guard down, I'll strike."

Over the years, Jonathan had already taken control of the company.These people were just causing trouble, but they weren't a real threat. He didn't take them seriously.

"Also, tell a few directors that I'm alive. They'll help you," Jonathan added.


"Understood. I'll follow your lead,"

Jonathan was just waiting for Harold and the others to fail miserably. "By the way, why did Kathie go to see Tom today?" Jonathan asked.

"Dr. Cavendish is looking for the biological father of her children. She wants to enroll them in Elite Tots Academy, but her application was rejected. The school requires information from both parents for admission."

Jonathan frowned. "Is that a rule?"

Ben nodded. "Good private schools usually have this requirement, so Dr.Cavendish is anxious."

Jonathan thought for a moment. "Contact the school and have them waive that requirement. Let her kids enroll."
Ben hesitated. "That's not easy. If you were still around,a phone call would solve it. But now, with rumors of your death, my words might not carry weight."

Jonathan understood the harsh reality. He couldn't reveal himself yet.

Ben, though his assistant, didn't have the authority to make the school listen.

After a moment of thought, Jonathan remembered. "Keith Gray is on the school board. Have him handle it and tell him I'm alive."

Keith was a good friend. He could trust him with this.

Ben sighed in relief. "MMr. Gray is a good choice. I'll see him tomorrow."

"Seven, what are you doing outside at this hour?" Kathie's voice called from inside.

Ben quickly hid in the bushes, waving goodbye to Jonathan.

Jonathan replied, "I heard some stray cats making noise, so I came out to shoo them away." Ben was speechless.

"Come back inside. The night air is damp. You'll catch a cold," Kathie called out.

Jonathan felt a bit warm inside, but then Kathie added, "I don't want to waste money on cold medicine for you. Can't you behave and stop causing me trouble?"


Jonathan fell silent.

He was really deluding himself. How could he forget how stingy Kathie was? She just didn't want to spend money on him. When the time came,he'd have to use money to shut her up.
###Chapter 22 When Will You Get Married

The next morning, the three dogs in the yard were barking up a storm,signaling someone was trying to break in.
Kathie stepped outside and saw Randy standing at the gate,holding gifts.

Kathie glared at him. "What are you doing here? Aren't you worried the dogs will bite you?"

Randy forced a smile. "Don't be mad. I'm here to talk about the kids'schooling."

It seemed Shirley had already filled him in on yesterday's events.

Kathie didn't want him inside the house, so she led him to the creek to talk.

She spoke up, "Say what you need to say."

"Kathie, you want to enroll them in school under Mrs. Berkeley's name,but you don't realize that without my consent, they can't get in."

Kathie frowned. "What do you mean? We're still legally married. How can you stop it?"

Randy smirked. "You forgot the paperwork requires both parents to be present for the application, and there's a follow-up visit. If I dan't cooperate,they won't be admitted."

Kathie clenched herfists, gritting her teeth. "Then I'll just drown you in the creek and claim sympathy as a widow. Maybe that'll work."

Kathie wasn't bluffing; she genuinely wanted to get rid of Randy.

"Don't try to scare me. It won't work," Randy said.
###Chapter 22 When Will You Get Married

It was all these ridiculous school regulations that made Kathie's situation so difficult.

She took a deep breath to calm down. Killing him wasn't an option. She needed to figure out his real motive.

"What do you want to cooperate? Money?" Kathie asked.

Randy looked Kathie up and down. Even in her simple home clothes,her impressive figure was undeniable. How had he not noticed back then?

It was all Shirley's fault for constantly seducing him, making him overlook Kathie.

Randy said maliciously, "We dated for years and never had sex. If you agree to sleep with me once a mnonth, I'll let your kids go to school."

This damned Randy. He had looked down on her back then, and now he wanted to sleep with her? What a delusional fool.

Kathie calmly took out her phone and called Shirley. Once the call connected,she continued, "Doesn't this betray Shirley? She's been with you for four years without a proper title, mocked by others. If my kids get in,your son won't have a chance."

"Don't worry about her. My heart has always been with you, Kathie. I've always loved you. She used the child to threaten me. I never wanted to betray you. Your kids are my kids. If you agree to my terms,I'll do whatever you want."

Randy's words were so heartfelt that Shirley, on the other end of the line,wanted to kill him.

She couldn't believe the man who had seduced her, claiming to love only her,was saying such things behind her back. He knew how much she loved him and wanted to give their child a proper status. Yet, he shamelessly tried to please Kathie, giving away their son's school spot.

"So,you don't want a divorce anymore?" Kathie asked.

"Yes. I just want you."

"Get my kids enrolled first, and then I'll agree."

Randy grinned. "No way. What if you back out later? Maybe we should do it in the car right now. You haven't tried that, have you?"

Kathie clenched her jaw. If murder were legal, she'd have Randy dissected for medical experiments.

She lied to him. "I'm busy today. How about tomorrow?"

Hearing her relent, Randy was overjoyed. "Great, I'll book a hotel for tomorrow. Dress nicely. Don't waste that great body of yours."

Kathie looked at him like disdainfully. "Got it. Now get lost."

Satisfied,Randy left. Kathie picked up her phone, hearing Shirley's anguished screams.

Kathie found it amusing. "Shirley, you heard everything, right? This is the man you schemed to steal.Still like him?"

Shirley was on the verge of breaking down. "Kathie,you're shameless. To get your brats into school, you seduced Randy, making him betray me.I won't let you get away with this."

"Watch your mouth. As a homewrecker, you have no right to talk. Now .your man is getting my kids into school. You should figure out what to do. Kathie hung up, leaving Shirley to stew in her misery.

Jonathan woke up to the sound of children laughing outside, which lifted his spirits.

He was starting to enjoy this peaceful life, free from scheming and conflicts,not having to constantly fend off those plotting against him.

Eileen gently pushed open the door, peeking in. "You're awake."

Jonathan's heart melted at the sight of her cute face. "Eileen, you're up early. What are you playing outside?"

"We're playing soccer!" Eileen replied.

Kyle peeked in too, waving at him. "Sir, come play soccer with us."

Jonathan fell silent.

He couldn't even stand, let alone play soccer.

Jonathan was helpless. "Thanks, Kyle, but I'm injured and can't play."

Zachary squeezed in. "Then you cana be the goalie. You don't have to kick."

Jonathan forced a smile. "Thanks for thinking of such a good position for me."

Zachary proudly patted his chest. "No problem. It'll give you some exercise.



Jonathan remained silent. He didn't want to move, especially not with two rambunctious boys. It would only worsen his injuries.

"Are you scared to play?" Kyle pressed when he didn't respond.

Jonathan smiled helplessly. He didn't want to play, butthankfully,Kathie came in to stop this dangerous activity. "NNo. Seven is still recovering. If he gets hurt again, it'll be a big problem,"Kathie intervened.
Jonathan sighed in relief, but Eileen tugged at her mom. "Mommy, when are you and Seven getting married?"
Jonathan and Kathie exchanged glances. Kathie was speechless. "Eileen,why are you asking that?"
Eileen was serious. "You both took a bath together and kissed. On TV.that means you have to get married. If the man doesn't take responsibility,he's a jerk."

Kathie had a headache. "It's not what you think."

Kyle looked grave. "So, Mommy wants to abandon him?"


Kathie was awkwardly silent.

This was hard to explain. Kathie tried to soothe them. "Those were accidents. As a doctor, I was taking care of him. It was just a misunderstanding."

Zachary shook his head. "Mommy, you can't fool us with that."

Jonathan chuckled, earning a warning look from Kathie. It was all his fault for causing this mess.

Jonathan shrugged helplessly. Her three kids were sharper than any negotiator he'd met. No one could handle them.

To shut them up, Kathie had to come up with a temporary solution. "Seven has amnesia. We can't be sure if he's married. What he says is just a guess. If he has a family, you wouldn't want Mommy to break it up, right?"
###Chapter 23 Seeing Her Body

Kathie had a point. Even though the three kids liked Jonathan, they didn't want their mom to mess up someone else's family.

Kyle said seriously, "Let's wait until Seven remembers everything."

Eileen prayed, "I hope he isn't married, so he can be my daddy.I want to see him every day."

Kathie sighed. Eileen needed some serious guidance. She was so focused on Seven that Kathie worried she'd be easily deceived by bad men in the future.


Kathie herself had been fooled by that jerk Randy, and she was determined not to let her daughter make the same mistake.

"Eileen, Mommy needs to have a talk with you," Kathie said.

Eileen hung her head, mumbling, "Mommy's gonna lecture me again."

Kyle and Zachary couldn't invite Jonathan to play soccer, so they went off to play by themselves.

That afternoon, Kathie was working in the backyard, trying to clear a patch of land to grow some vegetables so she wouldn't have to buy them.

Jonathan was lounging in a wheelchair, enjoying the sun and watching Kathie toil.


"Are you planning to stay here long-term?" he asked.

He had looked into Kathie's situation. She had reclaimed the Cavendish Mansion, so why wasn't she living there instead of clearing land here?

"The air is better in the suburbs of Eldoria. I want to stay here for a while,"Kathie replied. "That's a nice thought, but this soil looks pretty poor. Do you really think you can grow anything? Seems like a waste of efort to me."

Kathie shot him a glare. Why was she sweating under the sun while he sipped juice and made snide comments?

Wiping her sweat, Kathie picked up a hoe and walked over.

Seeing her approach with a determined look, Jonathan frowned. "Dr.Cavendish, a lady uses her words, not her hands."

"I don't buy that."

"Then just pretend I didn't say anything. Keep up the good work."

Kathie raised the hoe. "You're right, the soil is poor. So I thought I'd add some meat to enrich it. How about I bury you in it?"

Jonathan grinned. "You must be joking. A doctor with a kind heart wouldn't harm a patient."

"Let's find out!" Kathie swung the hoe down, making Jonathan break out in a cold sweat.

The hoe landed just in front of his feet, kicking up some dust.

This woman was really something!

"If you don't want to die, keep your mouth shut," Kathie warned.

Jonathan covered his mouth. Living under someone else's roof, he had to behave.

After a tiring afternoon, Kathie made dinner, and the three kids obediently washed the dishes.

Kathie glared at the man who was just sitting there. "Even kids know to wash dishes. Can't you do something for this family?"

Jonathan had the feeling that KKathie was always annoyed with him.

"How about I cheer them on?" he said.

The three kids were speechless.

Jonathan was quite the comedian.

Kathie's face darkened. "I'm too tired to argue with you today. Go to your room and get ready for a bath."

Jonathan was amused. "Thanks for the trouble."

Kathie was so angry she wanted to leave him to fend for himself.

She wheeled him to the bathroom and was about to help him undress when Jonathan stopped her.

"What are you doing?" Kathie frowned.

"I see you're tired. You should take a bath first."

Kathie was surprised. "Are you really that considerate?"

"I'm just worried you'll wear yourself out and then no one will take care of us. I'll get your pajamas." Jonathan left, and Kathie was taken aback by his thoughtfulness.

Kathie had just undressed and was about to step into the shower when the bathroom door suddenly opened.

"Dr. Cavendish, your pajamas are..."

"Ah! You pervert, get out!" Kathie screamed.

She then grabbed her clothes to cover herself, not expecting him to come back so suddenly.

Jonathan turned his head and quickly shut the door. "Sorry, I just couldn't find your pajamas and came to ask. I wasn't trying to peek."

From the bathroom, Kathie roared, "Seven, you're dead!"

Jonathan shrugged.

Kathie had a stunning figure, with curves in all the right places and long,sexy legs. She was a real beauty, just as alluring as the woman he had been with years ago.

He found himself a bit envious of the father of her three kids.

Kathie was too tired to confront him, knowing she had important things to do the next day.

Jonathan escaped unscathed but wasn't happy about it. He actually enjoyed their banter.

The next morning, Kathie got up early to prepare breakfast and lunch.

Jonathan noticed she was getting ready to go out again. "Are you heading out again?"

"Yeah,please look after the kids. Call me if anything comes up.

Jonathan was puzzled. "Who are you meeting that you have to go out every day?"

Kathie rolled her eyes. "I have work to do and need to earn money to support you all. Who else is going to pay for your medicine? Those are expensive herbs, you know,"

Jonathan promised, "Ill pay you back tenfold in the future.""Really?" Kathie was skeptical.

Jonathan hated being doubted. "If you don't believe me, I can write an IOU."

Kathie nodded in satisfaction. "That sounds good. Wait here."

Jonathan was speechless.

He had just been talking, but Kathie was serious about money.

Kathie brought paper and a pen, along with the list of medicine expenses from the past few ddys. "I'll give you a friendly price, round it up, and forget the small change. No need to be too grateful.

Jonathan looked at her, amused. "You're really looking out for me."

Charging him ten times the amount and rounding off the small change,and he was supposed to thank her.

Kathie was quite the money-grubber.

Kathie pointed out, "Your current name is fake. Make a note of that on the IOU and put your fingerprint on it. We'll use the fingerprint to avoid any disputes."

Jonathan was thoroughly impressed. "You think of everything.You shouldn't be a doctor. If you went into business, you'd be a bilionaire."

Someone as calculating and stingy as her was rare.

Kathie smiled,pleased with the IOU. Now she had some money.

"That's a good idea. I'll consider it," she replied.

Jonathan rubbed his forehead, not wanting to talk anymore.

Kathie gave her kids some instructions and left. Watching their mom leave, the kids were a bit down.

Kyle sighed, "Mommy's gone again. She hasn't played with us in a long time."

Eileen looked like she was about to cry. "I want to go with Mommy."

Zachary said helplessly, "But Mommy said she has work to do. It's not convenient to take us. We can't be a burden to her."

Jonathan clapped his hands. "Cheer up, everyone. Your mommy will be back soon."

Kyle looked at him. "Seven, let's play a game."

Jonathan frowned. "As long as it's not soccer, I'm open to suggestions."

Zachary looked at the falling leaves outside and got excited. "I want to fly a kite. Can you make one?"

The yard was big and safe. If he made them kites, they wouldn't bother him. With that in mind, Jonathan decided to learn how to make kites,even if he didn't know how.

"That's easy. I'll learn right now," Jonathan said.

He then opened his laptop, watched a tutorial, and gathered materials to make a kite for each kid.

Though the kites were a bit ugly, the kids were thrilled with the new toys and ran around the yard happily.
###Chapter 24 Dealing with the Scumbag andt he Bitch

Eileen gushed, "Sir, this is the cutest kite I've ever seen, and you even drew little hearts on it for me. Thank you."

Jonathan loved hearing Eileen's sweet voice. "As long as you like it. You guys play safely in the yard."

Kyle and Zachary were already racing each other. Jonathan took advantage of their distraction to slip back into the house and call Ben.

Ben answered immediately, "Mr. Berkeley, what do you need?"

"Kathie just left. I need you to follow her and report back on who she meets."

"Mr. Berkeley, this is the first time I've seen you so concerned about a girl.Do you like Dr. Cavendish?"

Jonathan made a displeased sound, and Ben quickly corrected himself."Sorry, Mr. Berkeley, I spoke out of turn. I'll get on it."

"And arrange for someone to protect her discreetly. I'm worried she might be in danger."

Ben thought to himself that Jonathan was clearly worried about Kathie,but he didn't dare say it out loud. Instead, he respectfully replied,"Understood, I'll take care of it."

Kathie arrived at the Starlight Palace Hotel, where Randy was waiting at the entrance.

Kathie hadn't dressed up as Randy had suggested. She wore a simple white shirt and jeans, but her unique charm stillshone through. Randy said. "Kathie. I've prepared some red wine and your favorite snacks.Let's go to the room and talk."

Kathie nodded and followed him to the presidential suite.

As soon as she entered, she saw the floor covered in flower petals,the room filled with fresh flowers, and the air thick with perfume,which was so strong it made her feel nauseous.

On the bed was a set of lingerie, indicating Randy had some plans.

"Kathie,we're going to have a wonderful day here."

"You're quite thoughtful."

"Of course, this is to make up for our wedding night."

Kathie cursed him silently. Then she forced a smile. "In that case,let's not waste time. You go take a shower first."

Randy suggested, "How about we shower together?"

Kathie glared at him. "I don't like that."

"No problem, I'll go shower. You wait for me." Randy didn't want to ruin the mood; he planned to get intimate with her first.

As Randy rushed into the bathroom, Kathie used her phone to hack into the hotel's surveillance system. She saw that Shirley had already arrived at the hotel entrance. The show was about to begin.

Kathie also found two hidden cameras in the room, likely placed by Randy to gather blackmail material.

She had been foolish to ever be interested in someone as despicable as Randy. When Randy came out wrapped in a towel, there was a knock at the door.

Kathie asked curiously. "Who's knocking so urgently? You should go check."

Randy was annoyed. Who was ruining his plans now?

He angrily opened the door, only to be met with a slap.

"Randy, you bastard! You promised me yesterday that you had nothing to do with Kathie, and today you're here with her. Howcould you betray me and our child?" Shirley shouted.

Randy was shocked. He hadn't expected Shirley to show up.

"Stop yelling. Go back, and I'll explain later," he said with an annoyed expression.

Shirley was furious and pushed the door open. When she saw Kathie, she lost it. "You shameless pair! Kathie, you're my sister! How could you do this behind my back?"

Kathie laughed. "I remember you saying you didn't have a sister. Now you're claiming me?"

Shirley decided to go all out. She started shouting, "Everyone, come see!My man is cheating with my sister, abandoning me and our child. I don't want to live anymore!"

Shirley's cries attracted a crowd, and people started pointing at Randy and Kathie.

"She's so shameless. She's so pretty, why seduce her sister's husband? It's not like all the men in the world are dead."

"Yeah, young people these days are hard to figure out. How can she treat her own family like that? Doesn't she feel any guilt?" "These adulterers have no conscience. They only care about their fun in bed."

"Let's record a video and expose them. Everyone should avoid these scumbags."

Amidst the accusations. Kathie stepped out with a marriage certificate and opened it for everyone to see. "Everyone, look closely. This man and I are legally married. This woman causing a scene is the mistress. She seduced my husband, had a child with him, and is trying to force us to divorce.Just as we were reconciling, she came to cause trouble again."

Shirley was stunned.

The crowd was shocked, and their attitude quickly shifted.

"What? So she's the wife, and you're the mistress? How dare you slander her? You're so evil."

"Yeah,we almost wronged her because of you. You're shameless."

"Mistresses should die. You bully the wife, and she has such a sister, how unlucky."

Some people also pointed out Randy's faults. "This man isn't good either.
Even if he was seduced, how could he betray his wife?"

"Exactly, he's a scumbag. Miss, you should leave him."

Randy's face turned ugly. He blamed Shirley for causing this scene.

The crowd's scorn overwhelmed Shirley. She had been pampered all her life and had never been humiliated like this. All this pain was Kathie's doing.

Kathie approached her. "Shirley, how does it feel to be on the receiving end of public opinion?" Shirley shook her head. It wasn't supposed to be like this. She had been with Randy for four years.She should have been his wife.

"This isn't right. It's all your fault. Why don't you just die?" Randy retorted.

Kathieslapped her. "You're a mistress and still so arrogant. You must have learned this from your mother. You probably want to kill me and marry my husband."

Shirley couldn't take it anymore and lunged at Kathie. "How dare you hit me? I'll fight you."

Kathie dodged nimbly and tripped her,making Shirley fall face-first.

Kathie sneered, "You want to fight? You're no match for me."

Shirley got up and charged again. Kathie slapped her twice more, leaving Shirley dazed.

The crowd grew larger, and Randy couldn't let them keep fighting.He stepped in to break it up, only to be kicked twice and slapped by Kathie.

Randy was stunned. "Kathie,how could you hit me too?"

Kathie looked innocent and even a bit concerned. "Oh, did I hit you? I was so angry. Why did you come over? You could get hurt. Does it hurt?"

Randy thought it was an accident. He knew she still cared about him.

Shirley couldn't stand Kathie's fake concern and lunged again, only to be beaten up once more.

Kathie had long wanted to deal with these two scumbags. Today, she had her fill.

Staff arrived to stop the fight, ending the drama. Kathie left gracefully. Randy had booked a suite but got nothing out of it, only humiliation.Among the crowd, he had seen some familiar faces. If this got out, he'd have no dignity left.
Thinking about this, he grew even more annoyed with the crying Shirley.

He yelled at her, "All you do is cause trouble. Have you thought about how we'll face people after this?"
###Chapter 25 Played Like a Clown

Shirley's face was swollen from the slap, her foot was scraped, and a large chunk of her hair had been pulled out. She was in so much pain that she felt dizzy. Yet, Randy didn't show any concern for her condition; instead.he started blaming her right away.

Fury and frustration welled up inside Shirley, and she mustered all her strength to slap Randy across the face.

Randy spun around from the force of the slap, staring at her in dibelief."Are you out of your mind? How dare you hit me? Randy, you jerk! After everything I've done for you, this is how you repay me?"

Randy, not one to back down, kicked at her. "I'm your man. No matter what, you can't lay a hand on me. Otherwise, we're done."

Shirley never imagined that the man she had fought so hard to win back,enduring all the scorn, would treat her like this.

"Fine! Now that you're back with the Berkeley Family,you think you can use me and then dump me? If I take our child to the Berkeley Family and cause a scene, do you think you'll come out unscathed? They'd kick you out, and we can go down together," Shirley warned.

Randy hesitated, knowing he hadn't secured his position in the Berkeley Family yet. If things got ugly, it wouldn't end well for him.

"It's because you were making such a scene that I lost control," he said,his tone softening.

"You're an idiot. Did it never occur to you that this was all Kathie's plan to humiliate us and turn us against each other?" Shirley snapped back.

Randy didn't understand what she meant until Shirley showed him her phone's call log. "Yesterday, when you went to see her, she called me and
made sure I overheard your conversation. You thought she wanted to get back together, but she was just playing you."
Randy finally realized the truth. He had thought Kathie still loved him,but she had been making a fool of him.

Fuming, he immediately called Kathie.

Kathie saw the call and knew what it was about, but she answered anyway.

Randy roared, "Kathie, were you just messing with me? You never intended to get back together; you just wanted to humiliate us."
Kathie laughed heartily. "Looks like you're not as dumb as I thought. You finally figured it out. Seeing a scumbag like you makes me sick! You think we could ever get back together? Dream on!"
Randy's chest heaved with anger. He had thought he could control Kathie,but she had outsmarted him.

"Listen. Kathie, your three illegitimate kids won't get into Elite Tots Academy," he said angrily.

"Even if my kids can't get into Elite Tots Academy, I can find other schools. If you think you can threaten me with that, you're delusional."

"I'll make sure they can't get into any school,Just watch."

"If you try anything,I'll destroy you."

After hanging up, Kathie felt a mix of emotions.She had vented her anger,but the issue of her kids' schooling remained unresolved.

She had lost her temper, and now she needed to find another solution.

In the backyard of Kathie's villa in Eldoria, Jonathan was with the three kids, having a kite-flying contest to see whose kite could fly the highest. 
Eileen, the smallest. struggled to keep her kite in the air.

"Sir, why won't my kite fly?" Eileen said, a bit disappointed.

Jonathan held her tiny hand. "You need to run with the wind and let out the string when there's a breeze. That way, it will soar."

Kyle,the most perceptive, had his kite flying the highest. "Look, mine's higher than all of yours."

Jonathan noticed that these kids were smarter than most their age,especially Kyle and Zachary, who were quick thinkers. Even he had been outsmarted by them a few times.

Eileen. though not as sharp as her brothers, had an impressive talent for drawing that amazed him.

"I'm catching up to Kyle," Zachary said, not wanting to be outdone.

When Kathie returned, she saw the three sweaty kids and a man in a wheelchair arguing in the yard. The scene was almost comical.

"What are you all doing?" Kathie asked.

The kids turned and waved excitedly. "Mommy, you're back! Come judge whose kite is flying the highest!"

Kathie looked up and saw four kites in the sky, all at similar heights and equally unattractive.

"Seven,did you make these?" Kathie asked.

Jonathan nodded proudly. "I have some skills, you know."


Kathie teased, "They're ugly and uneven."

Jonathan fell silent, feeling deflated. "At least they're flying high. Now we need to rank them. Who do you think is first?" Jonathan passed the tough decision to her.

Zachary held his string. "Mommy, mine's the highest, right?"


Eileen chimed in, "Mine's the highest."

"You cheated. Seven helped you get it up there. You just held the string."Zachary exposed her.

Since the kids had gotten to know Jonathan, they all called him by the nickname Kathie had given him, Seven.

Eileen retorted, "It still counts as mine."

Kathie couldn't help but laugh. She had to be fair. "Zachary's is first. Seven's second. Kyle's third, and Eileen's is the best."
With the rankings settled, they reeled in the kites. Kathie noticed their clothes were soaked from playing outside.
"Everyone go inside and change clothes, or you'll catch a cold," Kathie said with concern.

The kids went inside, and Kathie turned to Jonathan. "Seven, you're an adult. How could you let them play outside in the sun for so long? They could get heatstroke."

Jonathan shrugged. "You coddle them too much. Kids need sunlight. Look.they played all day and they're fine."

Kathie sighed, but he had a point. "Your face is dirty too. Go wash up."

Jonathan slumped in his wheelchair. "I'm too tired. Push me inside."

Kathie knew he was faking. "You might as well give up your hands then." Jonathan immediately sat up straight. "Suddenly, I feel better. Dr.Cavendish, your medical skills are amazing."
Kathie didn't want to banter with him. Just then, her phone rang. It was Melinda.

Melinda excitedly told her, "Kathie. I have great news. Your kids' school applications have been approved."

Kathie was overjoyed. "Really? I thought they needed identity verification and home visits."

"All those requirements were canceled today. They said they were inhumane. You got lucky."
"That's fantastic! I'll get everything ready and take the kids to school as soon as possible."

"Great. Let's have a party to celebrate."


"Absolutely."

After hanging up, Kathie shared the good news with the kids. Kyle and Zachary remained indifferent, while Eileen clapped happily.
Eileen's eyes lit up as she exclaímed, "I get to go to school! I'll make lots of friends and learn so many new things."

Kyle frowned. "Mommy, can't we go straightto elementary school?Kindergarten isn't suitable for Zachary and me."

Their intelligence was advanced enough to skip elementary school, so going to kindergarten felt like a step back.
###Chapter 26 Playing Mind Games

Kathie patiently explained to Kyle, "Kyle, you and Zachary are really smart.but you're still just kids. You need to hang out with other kids your age."
"And besides. you're not tall enough yet. If you were in elementary school,others might pick on you. And Eileen is too naive. What if someone bullies her when you're not around?" she added.

Kathie was naturally worried about separating the three kids. With two older brothers around, they could protect Eileen if anything happened.

Kyle thought about what his mom said and agreed it made sense. "Alright,we'll stay with Eileen. If anyone dares to mess with her, Zachary and I will handle it."

"That's the spirit. If you run into any troublemakers, don't hesitate to stand up for yourselves," Kathie replied.

Jonathan chuckled from behind. "Who teaches kids to fight?"

Kathie retorted, "Why not? Should they just reason with someone who's bullying them?"

"They could go to the teacher."

"If they get hit and go to the teacher, they'll just get hit again next time.The only way to stop a bully is to make them afraid. Do you really think teachers can control all the bullies?"

As a doctor, Kathie had seen too many kids hurt by bullies. The only way to deal with such people was to be tougher than them.

So,she had always taught her kids not to be weak in such situations and to fight back.

Seeing Jonathan's confusion, Kathie added, "Your intentions are good,but you underestimate how cruel people can be. I suggest you learn more about these things before judging my decisions."
Zachary stepped up. "I support Mom. There was a chubby kid who used to bully me. We tried talking to his parents, but they just yelled at us.After my brother and I fought back, he never bothered me again."

Eileen nodded. "Bad kids deserve to be hit."

Jonathan had always been strong and never experienced bullying, so it was understandable he didn't get it.
But seeing all three kids agree with Kathie showed her approach was right.


"Alright, listen to your mom," Jonathan said.

"You should listen to my mom too," Eileen said innocently.

Jonathan's mouth twitched. He had no intention of listening to Kathie.

Meanwhile, Shirley returned home crying. Melissa saw her daughter in such a sorry state and was furious. "Oh my God, my poor baby. Who did this to you?"

Shirley sobbed. "Mom, it was that witch Kathie. She lured me to a hotel,humiliated me,and then beat me up."

Melissa tenderly wiped her face. "This is outrageous. Kathie is getting too bold. If we don't teach her a lesson, she'll keep stepping all over us."

"Mom, she's also trying to seduce Randy and ruin my relationship with him. I won't let her get away with it."

"We can't delay this any longer. I'll call your dad, and we'll figure out how ,to deal with that witch Kathie."

Melissa messaged Walter, and he rushed home within half an hour. Seeing his sweet daughter Shirley beaten up by Kathie, Walter was livid."Kathie must be out of her mind. You're sisters, and she dares to do this to you?"
Shirleycried. "Dad, she didn't just insult me. She kept badmouthing you too. I couldn't take it and argued with her, and she beat me up."

Walter's face turned red with anger. "What did she say about me?"

Shirley lied, "She called you a useless man, said all your success and wealth came from her mom, and that you live off women but still cheat on them. She said she would take the company back and leave you on the streets."

Walter was fuming, his fists clenched tightly. "Kathie, that ungrateful brat,dares to say such things!"
Melissa added fuel to the fire, "How could she say that? The company might have been the Hughes family's, but it was nearly bankrupt when you took over. You worked tirelessly to save it and doubled its profits. She doesn't see any of that."
Shirley chimed in, "Exactly. She can insult us, but how can she be so disrespectful to you? Now she wants her illegitimate kids to take my son's school spot. It's infuriating."

Walter couldn't swallow his anger. As an elder, he couldn't let a younger family member walk all over him.

"I'm calling Kathie right now and demanding she divorce Randy," he said angrily.

Kathie was in the yard sorting herbs when she heard the phone ring.,Seeing it was Walter, she knew Shirley must have twisted the story.

Perfect timing, she had some things to discuss with Walter too. Kathie answered. "Hello, Dad."
Walter was furious. "Don't call me Dad. I don't have a daughter like you."


"Alright. Mr. Cavendish," Kathie replied calmly.

Walter was momentarily speechless withanger.

He said through gritted teeth. "You ungrateful girl, are you trying to drive me to my grave?"
Kathie remained composed. "Don't you think you're overreacting?"

"Kathie, listen to me. You can't get away with hitting Shirley. Unless you divorce Randy immediately. I'll sue you," Walter threatened.
Kathie laughed, "Go ahead. I'll tell the police the truth-that she barged in on us and tried to attack me, and I acted in self-defense. I have plenty of witnesses."
"Regardless,hitting someone is wrong. You must apologize," Water retorted.

"I'm not apologizing. What are you going to do about it?"

Walter was nearly apoplectic, and Melissa started yelling, "Kathie,you witch! You hurt my daughter and defied your father. No wonder your illegitimate kids are unrecognized."
Kathie gritted her teeth, holding back her anger. "Melissa, don't get too comfortable. Your time to cry is coming soon. Dad, there's a special gift coming your way. Look forward to it."

Walter said impatiently, "Stop talking nonsense. Are you divorcing or not?"
 
"Not now. Maybe later, if I feel like it," Kathie said casually. Kathie was playing mind games, trying to infuriate them.

Shirley stomped her foot in frustration. Kathie was toying with them.

Walter threatened, "If you don't divorce. I'll drag you to court and make you."
Since he was being so unreasonable, Kathie decided not to hold back. "Mr.Cavendish. I'm formally requesting you return my 30% share of the company."

"What?"
"Did you forget? I own shares in the company. You said you'd hold them for me until I turned eighteen. It's time to give them back."

Walter denied it. "That never happened."

"My uncles were there. They don't know about your shady dealings yet.What do you think will happen if I tell them?"
Kathie's uncles were high-ranking executives in the company.If they teamed up. Walter would be in trouble.
"Kathie, I'm warning you, don't do anything rash."

"I won't, as long as you return my 30% share. Or, you can buy it for $100million. Then it's yours."
###Chapter 27 Most Men Are Either Jerks or ldats
Walter was on the verge of losing it. There was no way he was going to return the shares he had taken, nor was he going to hand over that huge sum of money.
Walter exclaimed, "You must be out of your mind. Even if you spill everything,what can they do?"

"Then let's see."
Walter wasn't about to be intimidated by her. "Go ahead and try."

Kathie saw him hang up and immediately contacted her uncles,coordinating with them to take Walter down from the inside out.
Walter felt a growing unease, unsure of what Kathie was planning.

Soon, his assistant called, reporting that the entire staff was on strike, the factory had halted production, and even shipments in transit were being returned.
Walter never imagined Kathie had this kind of power. It had to be the Hughes family behind this.
Within ten minutes, Walter's phone was blowing up with complaints and demands for compensation. Several companies were threatening to cancel their contracts, and the losses were mounting.
Walter was frantic. "This can't go on. We have to stop it immediately."

Melissa was furious, wishing she could kill Kathie on the spot for pushing them to this point.

"Do we have to give in?" Melissa asked. "We need to calm her down first, but either way, it's bad for me."

If he gave Kathie thirty percent of the shares, combined with the Hughes family's sixty percent, they would hold the majority, leaving him with only forty percent and no control.
He couldn't just hand over a hundred million dollars either. The company didn't have that kind of cash, and he couldn't bear to part with it.
Even though he didn't want to compromise, he couldn't stand to see the company suffer.
He called Kathie again, but she didn't answer, clearly making him sweat it out.
Walter gritted his teeth and kept calling. On the third attempt,Kathie finally picked up.

"Kathie, you're going too far," Water said coldly.

Kathie sneered. "Too far? I'm just getting started."

They had conspired to kill her mother, taken all her family assets, and he had pampered his mistress and illegitimate daughter while neglecting his legitimate one. Who was really going too far?
Walter,with great reluctance,said, "I'll return the shares to you. Just make them stop."
"That's more like it. Those shares were mine to begin with. Did you really think you could trick me out of them and they'd become yours? Prepare the agreement and send it to me. Also, I left you a 'gift' in your email. You might want to check it out."

'Kathie wasn't going to show any mercy to these despicable, ungrateful people. 
Walter sighed deeply, never imagining he'd be cornered by the daughter he had always looked down on.
Curious about the gift' she mentioned, he opened his email. When he saw the video,his blood boiled.

Unaware, Melissa was still behind him, trying to come up with a solution."Honey, don't be too upset. We can still find a way to get it back."
Walter didn't turn around, his body trembling. Melissa thought he was in shock and walked over with a smile. "Honey, let's go shopping to relax. I saw a bag yesterday that I really liked. Could you..."
Before she could finish, Walter slapped her hard. She stared at him in disbelief. "Why did you hit me?"

"You whore! What have you been doing behind my back?"

Melissa was confused. "Honey, what are you talking about?"

Walter grabbed her hair and shoved the phone in her face. "Don't understand? Look at this video. Who's the slut in it? And the guy looks younger than your daughter. You've been having quite the time,haven't you?”

Melissa's face turned pale. She never expected her affairs to be caught on camera.

"Haven't I treated you well? Haven't I given you everything? And you betray me like this, with not just one man but several."

She couldn't admit it, or her good days would be over.

Melissa had no choice but to lie, "Honey, these videos are fake. I never betrayed you. Kathie must have done this to drive a wedge between us.She did the same thing to Shirley today."

 
Walter wavered at her words, remembering Kathie's threats.

Melissa swore. "If I'm lying, may God punish me. You've been so good to me. How could I betray you? Kathie wants us to divorce so she can go after you. Don't fall for it."
Shirley, who had just arrived, chimed in, "Dad, don't let Kathie fool you.She wants to break you two up. With today's technology, anything can be faked.Trust Mom."

"Honey, think about it. So much has happened since she came back. She must have planned it all," Melissa said.
Walter released her, sternly asking, "You really didn't do this?"

Melissa breathed a sigh of relief and confidently replied, "I swear I didn't.My heart belongs to you. Kathie dared to attack us; I won't let her get away with it. I'll help you get the shares back, no matter what it takes."
Since Kathie had already made a move against her, Melissa couldn't sit idly by. She had to make Kathie disappear before she could destroy her.

Walter hesitated but nodded. Now wasn't the time for infighting.

In Kathie's suburban villa in Eldoria, Jonathan's phone buzzed. He discreetly returned to his room to check the message from Ben.

He locked the door and called back. "What's Kathie up to today?"

"Mr. Berkeley, she and Randy checked into a hotel," Ben replied.


A hotel?

Jonathan frowned,anger rising. He had been worried about Kathie, and .here she was, hooking up with Randy.

"But Shirley showed up soon after. Kathie beat her up, and it was quite chaotic. Randy seemed to get hit too." Ben quickly added.

Jonathan's frown eased. "Next time, tell me everything at once."

It seemed nothing had happened between Kathie and Randy. He felt oddly relieved. Was he starting to like Kathie?
"Mr. Gray keeps asking for your location. We might not be able to keep it from him," Ben said.
"Tell him if you must, but make sure he doesn't blow our cover."


"Understood!"
Jonathan hung up and hid his phone again, not wanting Kathie to find it.

Now that the kids were settled in school, Kathie probably wouldn't go looking for Randy. He felt a bit happy about that.
That evening. Kathie came to help him bathe, telling him to undress himself.

"Seven, your hands are quite nimble now. You can undress yourself," she said.

Jonathan feigned pain. "They were, but after making kites all day and playing all afternoon, I can barely lift my arms."
Thinking of how he had taken care of the kids all day, Kathie felt grateful."Alright, I'll help you undress and wash your hair. Do you need to use the bathroom first?"

"Thank you."

Kathie helped him to the bathroom, then undressed him and washed his hair.Being so close, he could clearly smell her intoxicating scent. "Have you ever thought about finding a dad for the kids?" Jonathan asked.


"Most men are either jerks or idiots. Why would I bother?"


Jonathan was speechless.
Seeing him deep in thought. Kathie asked curiously, "Why are you suddenly interested in this? Do you want to be their dad?"
###Chapter 28 It's Because You're Not Good a This
Jonathan tentatively asked, "What if I said yes, what would you do?"


Kathie let out a cold laugh. "I'd shut that idea down real quick."

Jonathan was a bit troubled, wondering what was wrong with him.


"Why?" he asked.
"You don't even know who you are. if you're married with kids.or if you have debts. With all that uncertainty, don't go messing up someone else's life," Kathie replied.

So that was why she went to Randy? She knew everything about him.

Jonathan was in a bad mood, moving his head around,getting seap in his eyes, "Ouch, do you even know how to wash hair? You got soap in my eyes."

Kathie rinsed his eyes with water. "Why are you being so grumpy? Who told you to move your head around while I'm washing i?"

She just said something he didn't like, why was he getting so mad?

"It's because you're not good at this"he grumbled.

Kathie pressed down on his shoulders. "Don't move, Ill handle it."

From the doorway, Eileen excitedly shouted."Wow, Mommy,are you kissing Seven again?"

Kathie realized she was half-leaning on Jonathan, with her arms around his shoulders. From the doorway,it did look like they were kissing.

She quickly stood up. "Eileen, it's a misunderstanding. Seven got soap in his eyes, and Mommy was rinsing it out."

"Really?" Eileen looked a bit disappointed.

Jonathan sighed. "You're so irresponsible."

Kathie's eyes widened instantly. "What did you just say?"

Eileen also asked. "Seven, did Mommy bully you?"

Jonathan shook his head helplessly, "Eileen, you're too young to understand. Your mommy doesn't want to take responsibility, but I won't blame her."

Kathie was speechless.

Eileen covered her mouth, looking at her mommy in disbelief, her bright little eyes blinking. "Mommy, did you kiss Seven and then nót want to take responsibility?"

"No,Eileen, don't listen to his nonsense. Go play outside. Mommy is giving him a bath, and girls shouldn't watch boys bathe."

"So Mommy can help Seven bathe because you two are getting married?"

Kathie had a headache. Eileen had really latched onto this topic.

She was helpless. "No, Mommy is a doctor and needs to take care of the injured."

Eileen nodded, half-understanding, and left. To avoid any more misunderstandings, Kathie locked the door.

Jonathan teased, "Dr. Cavendish, did you lock the door to make things easier?"

Kathie tugged the towel forcefully, "You're right, to make it easier to dispose of the evidence."
Jonathan shut up. He couldn't afford to provoke this fierce woman.

After taking care of Jonathan, Kathie went to the children's room to put the three kids to bed. By the time she finished everything and returned to her room, it was already past ten at night.

Kathie lay down,exhausted but content.

Just as she was about to sleep, the phone on the table rang.It was Clayton Watson, the hospital director she often collaborated with.

"Dr. Cavendish, sorry to bother you so late," Clayton said.

Kathie had worked with Clayton many times. If hewas calling at this hour,something must be up.

"No need to apologize. What's the matter?" Kathie asked.

"We received a stroke patient in critical condition. The patient has already had surgery before and can't undergo another one. I remember you saved many such patients with acupuncture. We hope you can help."

Clayton quickly added, "The family is willing to pay five million dollars for the treatment, and the hospital is also willing to pay. We need your expertise."

If the hospital was willing to pay, it must be to maintain their reputation.Considering her pleasant past collaborations with Clayton and the high fee,Kathie had no reason to refuse. She replied, "This patient must be quite important for you to go to such lengths to find me, Alright, I'll come by tomorrow morning."

"Thank you, Dr. Cavendish. See you tomorrow."

With three kids about to start at Elite Tots Academy, which cost a fortune annually, and her grandmother to take care of, money was always tight.Agreeing to this not only maintained her good relationship with Clayton but also brought in a significant amount of money. She had to go.
At dawn, Kathie was already preparing breakfast. The noise woke Jonathan.

Seeing the ingredients she was preparing, he blurted out, "Are you going out again?"

Kathie replied while busy, "If I don't go out to earn money,you'll go hungry."

That was a hint that he was freeloading.

"Didn't I give you an IOU?"

Kathie rolled her eyes. "You did, but can that IOU buy anything?"

Jonathan was speechless. She was right, but he couldn't let his identity be revealed.

"Are you going to see that jerk of a husband?"

"You sure are nosy. But I can tell you, no, and in my heart, he's as good as dead."

"Then why don't you get a divorce?"

"To make certain people unhappy."

Kathie finished and took the breakfast out, calling the three kids to get up.

"Kyle, Mommy has to go to work later. You need to take care of your siblings today," she said gently.

Kyle rubbed his sleepy eyes. "Mommy, why do you have to go out again? Kathie was silent.
She had heard this before. Jonathan had just said it. They really were starting to talk alike after spending so much time together.

"Mommy works hard so you can have a good life," Kathie replied.

Eileen hugged her mommy's hand. "I want to help Mommy."

Kathie held her in her arms, helping her get dressed, "You growing up healthy and happy is the best help for Mommy."

Zachary was dressing himself. "When I grow up, I'll make lots of money for Mommy."

"Good, Mommy will be waiting for you to grow up." Kathie was most comforted by her three adorable kids.

At the breakfast table, Kathie reminded them, "There's medicine for Seven in the kitchen. Make sure he takes it."

Jonathan was annoyed. "Do you think I'm a three-year-old who needs supervision to take medicine?"	

Kathie stared at him. "The plant in your room died. I checked it out.Guess what I found?"

Jonathan lowered his head, eating silently, pretending not to hear.

Kyle was curious. "Mommy, what did you find?"

Zachary also asked, "Mommy, I want to know too. Tell us."

Kathie cleared her throat. "Mommy is giving someone a chance to change.Just make sure he takes his medicine before you leave."

Eileen laughed, "I know, Seven must have poured the medicine into the plant. I did that once and got caught. Mommy punished me by not letting me have candy for a month."

Kyle and Zachary exchanged a look, grinning at Jonathan.

Jonathan was embarrassed and silent.

Now he felt even more ashamed, with Eileen spilling the beans.

Most of the medicine Kathie gave him, he did take. But sometimes, when he couldn't stomach it, he secretly poured the thick leftovers into the plant.He didn't expect the plant to die!

He also didn't expect Kathie to be so meticulous and find out.

"Seven,good medicíne tastes bitter but is good for you. You need to listen."Kathie said.

Jonathan gritted his teeth. "Got it. Dr. Cavendish, you should get going.Don't delay important matters."

"This is my home. I'll go out whenever I want," Kathie retorted.

Jonathan felt helpless. He couldn't argue, as he still needed her care.
###Chapter 29 The Potential of Being a Father
Jonathan couldn't imagine what his old friends would say if they saw him now. They'd probably laugh at him for the rest of his life.

The mighty Jonathan of the Berkeley Family, who could do whatever he wanted in Eldoria, was now being bossed around by a woman.
Luckily, Kathie left after breakfast, or Jonathan would have had a hard time.

At Eldoria Hospital, Kathie had just gotten out of the car when Clayton greeted her warmly, "Dr. Cavendish, thanks for coming."

"No problem, but please keep my identity under wraps," Kathie replied.

Kathie, known as the Miracle Doctor, was sought after by many hospitals for her extraordinary skilIs. She didn't have time to take on many patients,but she had worked with Clayton before and agreed to come.

Clayton led her to the treatment room, where many patients' families were waiting. Kathie was surprised to see Melissa among them, standing in a corner, trying not to be noticed.

But Melissa's sneaky behavior only drew more attention.

"Clayton, are all these people family members?" Kathie asked.

Clayton nodded. "Yeah, they've been waiting all day."

Kathie found it odd. She had reviewed the patient's information on the way over. He was a local with some notoriety in Eldoria. How did Melissa,who came from a remote village,get involved with someone like that?

·It seemed Melissa had a lot of secrets.

Back at Kathie's villa in the Eldoria suburbs, the three kids were clamoring 
to go out and play.

"Seven, we've been stuck at home for days. Take us fishing, please,"Zachary said.

Half an hour ago, Zachary had suggested going to the creek to catch fish.Kyle and Eileen eagerly agreed and started persuading Jonathan.

Jonathan pointed to his legs. "It's not that I don't want to,but I'm worried about your safety. If you fall, I can't protect you."

Kyle said, "The creek is really shallow. Mommy has taken us there before.Lots of kids play there. It's safe."

Zachary promised, "Ill keep an eye on Eileen. We've got all our gear ready.Please take us."

Eileen held up a small fishing net and a pink bucket. "Seven, we really want to go."

Jonathan was torn. He had never left the villa and didn't know what it was like outside. If anything happened to the kids, Kathie would skin him alive.

Kyle suggested, "Seven, if you're worried, you can call Mommy. She'll definitely agree,"

That seemed like a good idea. Jonathan had Kyle call Kathie, but there was no answer.

Kathie usually answered the phone immediately unless she was busy.

Kyle tried two more times, but still no answer.

Zachary said, "Mommy is probably saving someone. She said she can't take her phone when she's in surgery." "Yeah, Mommy must be busy. Seven, just take us, and we'll tell her later."Eileen was already impatient.

Jonathan frowned, looking at the kids'eager faces. He didn't want to disappoint them. "Okay, I'll take you, but you have to listen to me. If I think it's dangerous, we come back immediately."

The kids' eyes lit up. "Okay, we'll listen to you."

Jonathan could tell the kids were starting to trust him more.

At first. only Eileen was comfortable around him. The other two were wary. Now they were willing to let him take them out and weren't afraid of him being a bad guy.

The creek was indeed shallow, and the kids played safely. There were other local kids catching fish too.

Jonathan sat in his wheelchair by the bank, watching them.

He reminded, "Watch ouat for the rocks. Don't fall."


"Got it!"

Jonathan found himself getting better at being a dad, taking care of the three kids with ease.

And on the way there, many people commented on how much they looked alike.

Seeing the kids having fun, Jonathan took out a medical book to read.

Eileen cried out, "Don't take my fish! Zachary, hit him!"

Jonathan heard an argument and saw an eight-year-old girl holding Eileen's bucket and pushing Kyle into the water. Zachary rushed to help, but the girl's friends joined in to bully them.

Jonathan shouted, "Hey! Knock it off! Where are your parents?"

A middle-aged woman nearby snapped back, "Why are you yelling? Don't scare my kids. It's normal for kids to fight. Stop overreacting."

Jonathan retorted, "Are you blind? They're stealing from much younger kids and pushing them. You think that's okay?"

"What's the big deal? They're not hurt. Kids play rough. Stop making a fuss. It's annoying." The woman rolled her eyes.

Jonathan was speechless. He couldn't believe there were such unreasonable people in the world.

He finally understood what Kathie meant when she said some people just couldn't be reasoned with.

Seeing another boy about to push Zachary, Jonathan picked up a stone and hit the boy's knee, making him kneel in front of Kyle.

Another stone hit the girl's hand, making her drop the bucket. Kyle quickly grabbed it.

Kyle looked back in surprise. Jonathan winked at him, and Zachary smiled.


"Seven is helping us!" Zachary said.

The girl started crying, "Mommy, they hit me."

The boy cried too, and two women rushed over.

Jonathan called the kids over to avoid them getting hurt. "Come here."

The kids stood behind him as the women approached angrily, "You crippled bastard, did you hit my son's knee? And my daughter's hand is

 red. Did you hit her?"

Jonathan smiled. "Do you have proof? Did you see me do it? If not, shut up."

The women were stumped. They hadn't seen anything.

The boy's mother said, "But you said something, and then my son fell."

Jonathan chuckled. "Maybe he's just clumsy and fell on his own."

"You're the clumsy one. You can't even stand." The boy's mother resorted to insults.

Jonathan lifted his leg. "You must be blind. I'm just injured. Otherwise, I'd kick you across the creek."

The kids cheered, "Seven is awesome! Beat the old witch!"

"You... you're too much!" The boy's mother signaled her friend, and the girl's mother stepped up.

She showed her daughter's hand. "She let go of the bucket because something hit her hand."

Jonathan leaned in. "That's an evil spirit punishing kids who steal. This time her hand is red. Next tíme, it might break."

The women were speechless, and the kids huddled closer to Jonathan,feeling safe.
###Chapter 30 Squeezing Together to Sleep Tonight
As soon as Jonathan finished speaking, the little girl burst into tears, while Kathie's three kids laughed joyfully, completely forgetting the earlier unpleasantness.

The girI's mother was furious. "How could you scare a child likethat? She doesn't know any better."

Jonathan's eyes were cold as he glared at her. "She may not know better,but you, as an adult, should have taught her. When someone does something wrong, they should be punished. If you don't handle it now,the police will handle it for you later."

The girl's mother wasn't backing down. "No way,you hit my child. You need to compensate us, or I'll call for help and you won't be able to leave."

"Let's see who dares!" Kathie shouted from behind, her small frame exuding a fierce aura.

The three kids cheered and waved.

"Mommy's back!"

"Mommy,come help Seven deal with these bad people."

"Mommy, they bullied us first."

Kathie had been there for a while and, although she hadn't seen the beginning, she had guessed the situation from their conversation.

The girl's mother felt a pang of guilt seeing that Jonathan had backup, but she still put on a fierce face. "Your man hurt our kids. This needs to be resolved." "Of course, it does," Kathle sald sternly as she checked her kids. "My daughter's hand is scraped, and my son's arm is bruised. Let's call the police. I remember your eldest son is stiIl in jall. Do you want your family to be in trouble again?"

The girl's mother looked uneasy. "You know us?"

"How could I not? You married into the Powell family. My grandmother used to help your family. And you," she pointed to another woman,"married into the Bennett family. My grandmother sponsored your daughter's college education. Don't tell me you've forgotten."

The two women recognized Kathie as the granddaughter of the Hughes family and quickly apologized,remembering the help they had received.

"We're sorry. The kids didn't know any better. We'll make sure to educate them."

"Yes, it was a misunderstanding. Please don't take it to heart."

Seeing her kids' clothes were wet, Kathie didn't want to waste more time and pushed Jonathan to leave.

As soon as they got home, Kathie scolded, "How could you take them to play in the water?"

Kyle grabbed her hand. "Mommy, don't be mad. It was our idea."

Zachary chimed in, "Yeah, Mommy, I suggested it. Seven didn't want to,but we begged him."

"Mommy, we called you several times, but you didn't answer. So we begged Seven to take us," Eileen added, not wanting her mom to misunderstand.

Jonathan spread his hands. "You heard them. They wanted to play." "They're kids, you're the adult. You can't always go along with their ideas,"Kathie said,still upset. If something had happened, she wouldn't know what to do.

Jonathan felta bit annoyed by her words. "I understand you want to protect them, but you can't keep them cooped up at home every day. Kids need to play. They'll get bored of this small yard eventually."
Kyle felt guilty seeing his mom upset. "Mommy, don't blame Seven. It's our fault. We won't go again."
Zachary hugged her arm. "It was my idea. Don't be mad, Mommy.We'll listen to you from now on."

Eileen nodded tearfully. "I'll listen too. Don't be mad, Mommy."

Jonathan sighed. "Don't you think they're too well-behaved, lacking the liveliness and innocence of their age? They have to restrain themselves to please you."

Kathie realized he was right. Her three kids were always so well-behaved and rarely made her angry. She felt she owed them a lot.

Kathie took a deep breath and hugged her kids. "I'm sorry. I'll spend more time with you from now on."

She looked at Jonathan,grateful for how he had protected the kids today.

Jonathan nodded towards the bathroom. "You should get them cleaned up and changed so they don't catch a cold."

Kathie felt a warm surge in her heart.

The three kids excitedly recounted the day's events while soaking in the bathtub.

"Mommy, Seven was so cool today, dealing with those bad kids." Eileen proudly said. "He's always cool. He's a hero."

Zachary was impressed. "Seven is amazing. I want to learn how he threw those stones so accurately."

"Me too," Kyle added. interested.

Kathie ruffled their hair. "You all seem to like him a lot."


The three kids answered in unison, "We do!"

Kathie smiled wryly. She knew Jonathan wouldn't stay long. Once his leg healed or his memory returned, he would leave. The kids becoming too attached to him wouldn't be good.

"Mommy,do you like Seven?" Eileen asked, concerned.

Kathie smiled. "He's okay. I don't dislike him."

She couldn't deny that he had a place in her heart.

After bathing the kids, Kathie brought clean pajamas to Jonathan's room.

"You're all sweaty. You should take a shower too," Kathie said.


Jonathan nodded. "Feeling better now?"

"Much better. I was a bit emotional earlier. Sorry."

"I understand. Trusting a stranger with your kids is hard. I'd feel the same."

Kathie couldn't bear any harm to her kids. They were her life.

This time, they didn't argue and peacefully took their showers.

In the middle of the night, a thunderstorm woke everyone up. The kids, scared, cried for their mom.

Kathie brought them back to her room. As the thunder roared, she held them tightly, aIso feeling scared.

Many women feared thunderstorms, and she was no exception.

But as a mother, she had to be strong for her kids.

"Don't be afraid. Mommy's here," Kathie comforted.

Only she could hear the tremor in her voice.

Suddenly, the power went out.

In the pitch-black night, the four of them huddled together on the bed.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. "Are you still awake?, My room
is leaking. Can I join you?"

Jonathan's voice, strong and reassuring, came through the darkness.


Kathie hesitated,considering the propriety.

Jonathan added, "I'm injured. If I get sick, it'll be more trouble for you."


"Mommy, let Seven sleep with us."

"Yeah,with him here, we won't be scared."


"I agree."

The kids all supported the idea. Kathie sighed and opened the door.

In the darkness, she couldn't see Jonathan's face until they grasped each other's hands, feeling a bond of strength.

Jonathan had heard the kids' screams and Kathie's shaky  voice,knowing she was also scared of the thunder. He had debated with himself before deciding to knock.

"The bed's small. We'll have to squeeze in," Kathie said.

Jonathan smiled. "That'll keep us warmer. How about I tell you a story?"

"Yes! We love stories. We know all of Mommy's by heart. Tell us a new one,Seven."

The previously tense atmosphere lightened up immediately.
###Chapter 31 You Actually Slept Together

Kathie helped Jonathan onto the bed, positioning him on the outside, with the three kids in the middle, and herself on the inside. The arrangement felt cozy and reassuring.

Eileen clung to his hand. "Seven, it's so good to have you here. We're not scared anymore."

Kyle had to admit, having an adult male around made them feel safer.


"Seven is actually pretty useful," Kyle said.

Jonathan rubbed his face. "I've always been useful. Now close your eyes and listen to my story."

Zachary was full of anticipation. "Finally, a new story to listen to."

Kathie realized she hadn't listened to the kids' thoughts in a long time.Thanks to Seven, the house felt more vibrant. Even if he never regained his memory, she was willing to take care of him.

Jonathan's deep, soothing voice began, "On a distant planet, there was a little singer with gray hair and emerald green eyes..."

His voice was rich and gentle, like a warm melody that comforted the listeners. Even with the thunderstorm outside, the kids weren't afraid.

Sensing Kathie's unease, Jonathan reached for her hand in the dark.

At first, Kathie pulled away, but gradually,she stopped resisting.

On a night like this, having someone to help put the kids to sleep and hold her hand to ease her fears was comforting.

That night. the five of them slept soundly. The next morning, they were jolted awake by a scream.

Kathie opened her eyes to see Melinda standing at the door,sereaming."You...you aII slept together!"

Kathie quickly pulled her hand away from Seven's and sat up. "Melinda.what are you doing here? Don't get the wrong idea. It's not what you think."

Kyle rubbed his eyes. "Godmother, you're here."

Zachary, still sleepy, mumbled, "Godmother,you're a bit loud today.I want to sleep more."

Eileen turned over and hugged Jonathan again. "I want to keep sleeping with Seven."

Jonathan, with his messy hair and weary face, looked unrecognizable. Even if his family showed up, they might not recognize him, let alone Melinda,who had no memory of him.

Melinda was utterly confused, thinking, 'How could Kathie be interested in a man like him?

"The school notified us that the kids have interviews today. I can't let them fall behind, so I brought new clothes for them. As for last night,you owe me an explanation," Melinda said.

"Alright. Ill explain everything. I'll go make breakfast. Everyone,get up."Kathie said.

Kathie climbed out of bed, but as she reached the edge, she heard Jonathan groan. "You stepped on my wound."

*"Sorry, I'll give you an extra dose of medicine later to make up for it."

Jonathan fell silent. Was Kathie grateful or vengeful?

Melinda clapped her hands. "Kids, let's get moving. Don't be late. Who wants to try on their new clothes first?"

Although the kids had already been accepted, Elite Tots Academy required a successful interview for admission. Notjust anyone could get in.

Eileen was the most excited and got up first. "New clothes and new friends!I'm first."

Kyle and Zachary exchangedglances and shook their heads with a smile.

Melinda helped the kids get dressed and took them to wash up while Kathie started cooking.

"You came all this way. A phone call would have sufficed," Kathie said.

"That won't do. These kids are like my own. School is important, and I want to be there with you," Melinda replied.

Kathie was touched. Over the years, Melinda had always been there for the kids.

"Thank you," she said.

Melinda glanced at Jonathan in the wheelchair and whispered, "What's going on with you two? Sleeping together and holding hands? Did you...?"

"Where's your mind going? There was a thunderstorm and a power outage last night. The kids were scared, so he stayed with us," Kathie explained honestly.

Melinda didn't believe her. She stared into Kathie's eyes, looking for any .sign of deceit. But I feel like there's something off between you two.Are you falling for him?" "Of course not. He's just my patient."

"Good. He's not right for you. Raising three kids is hard enough. You don't need another person to take care of. Be careful."

Kathie nodded, trying to hide her guilt. She couldn't let her friend see through her.

With breakfast ready, Kathie let the kids eat first and took medicine to Jonathan.

Jonathan smelled the bitter medicine and knew what was coming.

Kathie placed the medicine on the table. "The kids have interviews today,so we might be back late. There's food in the kitchen. Just heat it up for lunch. Starting today, you only need to take the medicine twice a day,morning and night."

"They're smart. The interview will be fine," Jonathan said.

"Thanks for the good wishes."

In the car, Kathie gave Eileen some tips, mentioning questions the teachers might ask and how to answer them.

She wasn't worried about Kyle and Zachary, but Eileen tended to get nervous,and Kathie was concerned she might freeze up.

Eileen listened carefully. She didn't want to disappoint her mom.

At the entrance of Elite Tots Academy, many families were arriving.

As Kathie got out of the car, she saw a familiar face. "They're here too."

Melinda looked and saw Randy and Shirley. She fumed. "Randy and Shirley, those cheaters, have the nerve to send their kid here. Disgusting." Kathie remained calm. "Shirley has always dreamed of her son attending this school. She's good to her kid, and he is pretty cute. The kid is innocent,after all."

Eileen tugged on her hand. "Mommy, are you saying other kids are cute?"


Zachary leaned in. "Cuter than me?"

Kyle asked, "How cute is he?"

Kathie felt awkward, then she softly said, "Mommy was just being polite.Of course, my three babies are the cutest and best. Mommy loves you the most."

"Really?" The three kids looked at her with blinking eyes.

Kathie nodded firmly. "Of course! No one can compare to you."

The kids beamed with joy, and Kathie glanced at Melinda,who was trying not to laugh.

After handing the kids over to the reception teacher,they cheered them on with fist bumps.

"Well, look who it is," said the snide voice that could only belong to Shírley.

Kathie turned and gave her a cold look. "I don't want to fight. Stay out of my way."

Shirley sneered, "Even illegitimate children can attend Elite Tots Academy now. The standards are really dropping."

Melinda stepped forward. "And your illegitimate child is any better? You'.re flaunting your affair in front of the rightful wife. If I shout, the school will throw your kid out." Shirley was furious but didn't dare to act out. She had worked hard to get her son into this school and didn't want to ruin it.
She could only issue a bitter warning. "My son will be studying here. Keep your kids away from him."
Kathie laughed coldly. "With a mother like you. I doubt he'll get in. I saw him pushing other kids out of the way earlier. Shirley,you really know how to raise a child."
###Chapter 32 Dumping the Useless Jerk on Y

Melinda chimed in. "Elite Tots Academy only takes well-rounded kids.They definitely don't want any brats."

Shirley was fuming, stomping her foot and grabbing Randy,who had been silent. "Randy, say something! Are you just gonna stand there and let them bully me?"

Randy had something to say but hesitated. He looked at Kathie."Kathie.what's your deal with Keith?"

Kathie was taken aback. She had heard of Keith, the notorious playboy of Eldoría, a rich kid known for his extravagant lifestyle and countless women. He was infamous for his flirtatious behavior.

Shirley caught on and sneered. "No wonder your kids got in. You pulled some strings, didn't you? Keith loves beauniful women. Kathie, I really underestimated you!"

Kathie shot her a glare. "Shirley, did you eat something terrible for breakfast? Your breath is so bad, and what you're saying is really off-putting."

"You! If what I said isn't true, then why is he involved in your business?"Shirley wouldn't let it go.
Kathie warned coldly. "I don't even know Keith. Don't slander me.or I'll sue you for defamation."

Randy was skeptical. When the school changed its rules, he was curious.It was a tradition for decades, and suddenly it was gone. He did some digging and found out Keith was involved. Although Keith was on the board. he didn't have the authority to make such changes.Plus,Keith didn t have kids, so why would he care about the rules? 
The only explanation was that Keith was helping Kathie.

Shirley continued sarcastically, "I bet you can't admit it. You're stringing Randy along while secretly seducing Keith. And you have another man waiting at home. How do you manage it all?"
Kathie laughed, "I can't handle it all, so I dumped Randy, that useless jerk,on you. Do you like himn?"

Shirley's face turned blue with anger. "Kathie, don't go too far."

"I have the skills to play them like puppets. Do you? You're only fit for trash like Randy." Kathie insulted both of them.
Melinda clapped. "Well said. Trashy men for trashy women. Shirley,you and Randy should stay together forever and not harm anyone else. Kathie,let's go get some snacks. My treat."
"Sure, I'm in a good mood today. My treat." Kathie, smiling,linked arms with Melinda and walked past the fuming Shirley, who was shaking with rage. The worst part was Randy didn't defend her.

Shirley was on the verge of breaking down. "I can't take it anymore. They always mock me. Randy Berkeley, when will you divorce her? Do you even want to be with me?"

Randy felt a bit reluctant. Kathie was still very attractive to him.

He said, "I'll divorce her, but you keep provoking Kathie and bringthis on yourself."

"She just called you trash. Aren't you mad?"

Randy sighed, "I wronged her back then. I deserve a few insults. Stop being so petty."

Shirley hit his arm hard. People around them gave disapproving looks, so 
Randy pulled her into a corner to avoid further embarrassment.

In the café. Melinda couldn't wait to ask, "Kathie, do you really have something going on with Keith?"

Kathie was exasperated. "Why are you asking too?"

Melinda was excited. "I heard Keith was involved when the school changed its rules. He's our headhunter company's boss and owns a nightclub and international hotel. He's a big deal."
Not only that, Keith had connections in both the underworld and with authorities. He was a prominent figure in Eldoria.
Kathie thought carefully and shook her head. "I really don't know him."

Melinda persisted, "Think harder. Maybe you met him and forgot. He might have a crush on you and helped when he heard you were in trouble.



Kathie was silent.

"My dear friend, I've been abroad for years. How could I have crossed paths with him?" she replied.
"He travels a lot too. Could he be the father of your three kids? If so, you'd be my boss's wife, and you could look out for me," Melinda said.

Kathie stuffed a piece of cake into her mouth. "Melinda, stop dreaming.That's never going to happen."

Melinda sighed. She knew it was impossible but couldn't help hoping.

In Kathie's small yard in the suburbs of Eldoria, a tall, handsome man .was pacing in the living room. When his gaze fell on Jonathan, he tried to hide his expression but couldn't help laughing. "Well, the mighty CEO Jonathan, look at you now. Stuck in this small place, in a wheelchair, with messy hair. I really feel for you."

Jonathan frowned. "I don't see your sympathy. I see a lot of gloating."

Keith laughed for a while before stopping. It was rare to see the invincible Jonathan like this, so he had to tease him.
"But it's good you're alive. I'm waiting for you to make a comeback."


"Don't worry. I won't let those people off."

Keith was pleased with his fighting spirit. "So, Kathie and those three kids have been taking care of you?"

Jonathan was annoyed. "It's just Kathie taking care of me."

He had been looking after the kids more, though they did bring him medicine and food. He didn't want Keith to know, or he'd never hear the end of it.

"Have you two grown closer?" Keith teased.

Jonathan glared at him. Keith shrugged and pointed at the photos on the TV cabinet. "I was shocked when I saw these photos. Those kids look so much like you."

Jonathan nodded. "They do, but Kathie isn't the woman from back then."

Keith sighed, "True. I did send you a beauty back then, and you never thanked me."

Jonathan threw a cup at him. "You have the nerve to bring that up. You drugged me."

"Don't be mad. As a friend, I didn't want to see you single. Didn't you enjoy that night?" Jonathan couldn't deny it. That night was unforgettable.

Keith examined the photos again. "These kids look so much like you. If they're not yours, could they be related to the Berkeley family? Should we check your cousins?"

"Mind your own business."

"Alright, I'll listento you."

Seeing Jonathan in this state, Keith decided not to tease him anymore.


Two hours later, the interview was over.

The three kids came out hand in hand. Eileen raised her hand to speak.


"Mommy, the teacher praised us a lot."

"The teacher said they can't wait to see us again."

"Mommy, the teacher realy liked us and kept talking to us."

Kathie hugged her three kids. "You were amazing. I knew you'd do great."

They laughed and chatted, while behind them, Shirley and her son were arguing.

"Mommy, they're all bad people. They called me mean. I want to hit them,"Bob said fiercely.

Shirley glared at him and slapped him across the face.
###Chapter 33 Clearly, It Was You Who Seduced Me
Shirley was so furious that she slapped her son, Bob.

She had been waiting with high hopes for her son to come out, only to hear from the teacher that he had shown no respect. When the teacher asked him a question, he cursed, and when the teacher reprimanded him,he hit back.

"Bob, you little brat! I worked so hard to get you this interview,and you dare to curse at the teacher?" Shirley was livid.

Bob started crying and fighting back. "Mommy, you're mean! You hit me too."

Randy grabbed his hand and smacked it hard. "I told you to behave on the way here. Look, the school doesn't want you here anymore."

He then turned to Shirley. "This is all your faualt. You spoil him rotten, no matter the situation."

"How is this my fault? You never discipline him. Now that there's a problem, it's suddenly my fault? You're always thinking about that tramp,Kathie, and ignoring your own child,"Shirley retorted.

Bob, angry, broke free from his parents and ran across the street,making them chase after him.

Kathie and Melinda exchanged looks and shook their heads. It was sad to see Bob in such a family.

"Mommy, let's go home. Seven is still waiting for us."

The three kids wanted to share the good news with him "You all really care about him," Kathie replied.

"Of course. Seven is part of our family."

Melinda teased, "The kids like him so much. You should just get together and form a new family."

Kathie laughed and cried at the same time. Nothing had happened between her and him yet.

In the hospital in Eldoria, Melissa was feeding water to a patient who had just woken up. It was Raymond Barnes, the stroke patient Kathie had treated the day before.

"Raymond, howv are you feeling now?" Melissa asked.

Raymond took a sip of water and nodded weakly.

"Much better. I thought I was a goner this time. Thank goodness for the miracle doctor who saved me. Once I recover, I must thank her properly."
"I asked around, but Clayton wouldn't reveal any information about the doctor."

"No worries, I'll finda way to locate my savior. Why are you wearing a mask?"

Melissa covered her eyes and started crying, "Raymond, I've been bullied."

Raymond was her godbrother in Eldoria. She had managed to establish herself there thanks to his support, and they had an improper relationship in private.

Melissa had come to him with a purpose.

"Who dared to bully you? Tell me what happened." "It was Kathie. She investigated me and gave Walter a video of me cheating with another man. I was almost beaten to death. I'm worried she'Il find out about us, and then we'll be in trouble."
Raymond gritted his teeth in anger. "She's just a powerless woman,and she dares to cause trouble."
"Raymond, we can't let her find out about us. If she tells Walter, and he gets suspicious, we won't get the shares."
Melissa wanted someone to get rid of Kathie, and Raymond was the perfect person for the job.

"I'll handle it."
Melissa's eyes gleamed with malice. She was determined to get rid of Kathie. If Kathie didn't want a divorce, she'd make Randy a widower.

In the suburbs of Eldoria, it started to drizzle again at night.

The weather was getting cooler, and the three kids were already lying in their mommy's bed.

Kathie was about to get into bed with a storybook when Jonathan knocked on the door.

"What are you doing here?" Kathie puzzled.

Jonathan smiled warmly. "My room is leaking. How about I squeeze in with you all tonight?"

Kathie rolled her eyes and refused. "You're addicted to this, aren't you?There's no thunder tonight; we don't need you."

.Jonathan confidently replied, "The kids need me."

Kathie laughed coldly. "That's impossible. They wouldn't..." "Seven, come on in. We were just about to call you," Eileen interrupted,always the first to support him.
Kyle chimed in, "I haven't seen Seven all day. I kind of miss him."

Zachary nodded. "Seven's story last night was so good. We've heard the ones in Mommy's book a million times."

Kathie was silent.

These three little ones were really good at undermining her.

She retorted, "Mommy can find new stories on the tablet for you."

Eileen said, "But I likeSeven's voice. It makes me feel safe."

Kathie looked at Kyle and Zachary, who both nodded in agreement. As their mommy, she felt like someone had stolen her kids'love.

Jonathan immediately added, "My blankets are all wet. It's not good for my health."

Kathie saw it was getting late and didn't want to make a fuss.

"Fine, but you sleep on the outer edge of the bed like last night," she said.

Jonathan smirked, "If I don't sleep on the outer edge, do you want me to sleep next to you?"

Eileen made room. "Seven can sleep next to my mommy."

Kathie pulled her into a hug and pinched her cute little face. "That's not for you to worry about. Just go to sleep."

Jonathan lay down and chatted with the kids for a while. Only when Kathie urged him did he start telling a story.

He had spent the whole day alone at home and had never felt so bored. Seeing them made him genuinely happy, so he found an excuse to sleep with them.The kids fell asleep listening to the story, and Kathie also started to drift off.
In the middle of the night. Kathie woke up needing to use the bathroom.She groggily got out of bed, forgetting there was someone next to her, and ended up falling on top of Jonathan.

Kathie was instantly wide awake. She tried to get up, but Jonathan held her.

"Dr. Cavendish, you're quite bold. Are you trying to do something while I'm asleep?" he teased.
Kathie blushed and her heart raced. She struggled. "Let go of me. I just forgot you were here."

If she hadn't moved, it would have been fine. But as she twisted,her soft breasts rubbed against his chest, causing Jonathan to get an erection.
He was a normal man, and with a beautiful woman in such closeproximity,it was only natural for him to feel aroused.
"Keep it down. Don't wake the kids. If they see us like this, it'll be hard to explain," he said softly.

Jonathan's deep, magnetic voice had a seductive quality in the dark,making her heart flutter.
In the faint moonlight, they looked at each other, and for a moment, it felt familiar.

If only she were the woman from back then, he would have wanted to experience making love with her again. If only hewere the man from back then, Kathie could be with him without any reservations.

But there were no "ifs."
Kathie felt his hard erection against her thigh, and his hand on her waist started to wander.

Her face turned red. She couldn't let him tease her.

"You're shameless. If you don't want to lose your manhood forever,I suggest you behave. Otherwise, I can perform surgery on you tonight," she warned.

Jonathan reluctantly let go, lazily saying, "Dr. Cavendish, no need to get angry. I never said I was going to do anything to you. You were the one who climbed on top of me."
Kathie quickly got off the bed and whispered in his ear, "I told you, I fell by accident, not to seduce you."
Jonathan covered his ears. "I don't believe you. Women always say one thing and mean another. You deliberately aroused me and thencalled me shameless."

Kathie was speechless with anger, thinking, 'He's so shameless!'
###Chapter 34 He Took Away the Children'sLove
The next morning, at the crack of dawn, Kathie shook Jonathan awake.

Jonathan opened his eyes and yawned. "Kathie, why are you waking me up so early? If I don't get enough sleep, I won't recover."
Kathie gritted her teeth and pushed the wheelchair to the side of the bed."You have one minute to get up."
Seeing her angry face, Jonathan decided it was best not to provoke her.Poor him, the head of the Berkeley Family, being bossed around by a woman. No wonder Keith made fun of him. Even Jonathan couldn't help but look down on himself.

"What's wrong? Why are you so cranky this morning? " Jonathan asked.

Kathie wheeled the chair back to his room and pointed at the perfectly intact ceiling and the dry bed. "Didn't you say the roof was leaking and your bed was soaked?"
Jonathan shrugged, "Well, maybe the ceiling fixed itself and the bed dried on its own."

Kathie hadn't slept well the previous night, while he had slept comfortably.Before dawn, she had rushed to Jonathan's room to check, to prevent him from sneaking into her room again. She found out that his room wasn't leaking at all; it was all a lie.

She smirked. "Seven, lying is bad. It's a sickness that needs treatment.I'll bring you some medicine later and make sure you drink it all, without any sugar."

Jonathan knew he was in trouble. He had angered Kathie again.11Iwas actually afraid of the dark, that's why I came to you." "Stop trying to argue. My decision is final, so just deal with it."

Kathie stormed out, determined to teach him a lesson. He always tried to tease her. Jonathan regretted it deeply. Why did he have to provoke her?Now he was really in for it.
Kathie went to the kitchen and decisively added a handful of extremely bitter herbs tothe medicine pot, ensuring that after drinking it, he would behave for the next two days.
At noon, Melinda called to invite Kathie for an afternoon shopping trip.She asked her three kids to join, but they refused.
Kathie couldn't believe it. "You really don't want to go shopping? Melinda will take us for steak and fried chicken, buy you ice cream and snacks,and you still don't want to go?"

In the past,whenever Kathie asked, the kids would eagerly agree.

Kyle, dressed in sportswear, said seriously, "Today, Seven is teaching us how to skip stones. I saw him the other day, and he's amazing. I want to learn too."

Zachary nodded. "He has prepared ring toss games to train our aim and balance. We don't have tíme to go with you."
Eileen, holding atowel, said, "Mommy, you go ahead. I need to take care of my brothers and cheer them on."

Because of Jonathan, her kids no longer clung to her. Anyone who didn't know better might think Jonathan was their biological father.

Kathie confirmed again, "You really don't want to go? Mommy is leaving,don't cry at home." The three kids waved. "Have fun, Mommy." Kathie looked at Jonathan's smug expression. If this continued, the kids would all be won over by him.
Jonathan grinned. "Kathie, go ahead. It's fine if you come back late. I'll take care of things here."
Kathie gritted her teeth. She couldni't believe the kids wouldn't go with her.Even as she started the car and made noise on purpose, the kids showed no intention of joining her. She drove off, feeling a bit down. It seemed her kids were really growing up and had their own minds.
Kathie arrived at the mall where she was meeting Melinda. Just as she was about to go in, a large hand grabbed her.

"Randy? What the hell are you doing? Let go."

"Kathie, come with me. We need to talk."

Kathie slapped his hand away. "If you don't let go, I'll scream for help."

Randy didn't stop and dragged her towards the parking lot. "Screaming won't help. Don't forget, we're legally married. Even if someone comes,I'lI say it's a marital issue, and the police won't interfere."

"You shameless jerk! Do you believe I'll cripple you?"

Kathie regretted not bringing her acupuncture needles. Otherwise,she would have jabbed him a few times.
"You refused to divorce, and now I don't want to either. I don't blame you for what happened last time. Just live with me properly."

"You really are shameless, saying such things."

.Kathie stomped on his foot, and as he bent down in pain, she punched him in the nose and pushed him away, running off. Randy, enraged, chased after her. "Don't think you can escape. Stop right there!"
Kathie ran to the roadside, where a car pulled up. The window rolled down, revealing a handsome, androgynous man.
He raised his chin and said, "Miss, need some help?"

Kathie looked at the stranger, anxious but hesitant to get into a stranger's car.

Randy was catching up. Just as he reached for Kathie, the man in the car stopped him.
"Isn't this Mr. Berkeley? Broad daylight, and you're trying to kidnap a woman?" the man asked.

Randy was surprised. "Keith? It's you. So you two know each other."

Kathie was also taken aback. This legendary figure, Keith, was so stunningly beautiful.
Keith shrugged, not denying it. After all, he had seen Kathie'sphoto and knew who she was.

Kathie was confused by Keith's reaction. It seemed like he knew her.

Randy grabbed her hand. "She's my wife. We had a fight, and I'm taking her home. Mr. Gray, you wouldn't interfere in a domestic matter,would you?"

Kathie quickly shook her head and explained to Keith, "No, I have nothing to do with him."

.Keith opened the car door and approached Randy. "Did you hear that?The lady said she has nothing to do with you, Let go." Randy was frustrated. He had finaly caught Kathie, and now Keith was interfering.
"Mr. Gray, if you don't believe me, you can investigate. Her name is Kathie,and she's my legal wife," Randy said.
"I don't care if she is or isn't. As long as she doesn't want to go with you,you can't take her. I won't say it again. If you don't let go, don't blame me for being rude," Keith retorted.

Keith couldn't stand by and watch Kathie be bullied, especially since she had helped Jonathan.,
He had seen Randy chasing her while driving by and followed to ensure her safety.

Randy didn't dare provoke Keith and angrily let go of Kathie's hand.

"Kathie, don't think that finding a protector means I won't touch you.I don't believe he can protect you forever. Don't forget, we're still legally married. I can always find a way to bring you back," he snorted.

Keith opened the car door for Kathie. "Miss, no need to argue with him.Get in."

This time, Kathie didn't hesitate and got in the car, avoiding further entanglement with Randy.

Randy watched her get into Keith's car, clenching his fists in anger.Kathie had said she didn't know Keith, so why was Keith protecting her?

Maybe Kathie and Keith had an improper relationship behind his back. If she could be with other men, why couldn't he?
###Chapter 35 Best Friend as an Assistant

Kathie glanced at Keith out of the corner of her eye, surprised they were meeting under such strange circumstances.
Keith flashed a devilish smile. "Got something to say? Just spit it out. No need to hold back."
Kathie, curious, asked, "Mr. Gray, why are you helping me? We don't even know each other."

Keith shrugged. "You're right, we don't. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Saw a beautiful woman being chased and decided to play hero."

Was that really the case?

Kathie had a feeling Keith knew more than he let on.

"Are you the one who canceled those rules at Elite Tots Academy?" she asked.

"Yeah, any problem with that?"

The question caught Kathie off guard. "No, it helped me out a lot."

"That's perfect then. A friend of mine mentioned those rules were unfair,so we talked it over and decided to scrap them," Keith said, not revealing the whole truth.

It did make sense the way he put it.

"Thanks for today. Could you drop me off up ahead? My friend is looking for me."

Keith nodded and asked, "That guy earlier said he was your husband.YouI two not on good terms?"Kathie shook her head. "He's not my husband. He's my enemy."

Keith smiled knowingly but didn't press further. He pulled over and walked around to open the passenger door for her like a gentleman.
Rumor had it that Keith had a bad temper and was a womanizer, but he seemed different from what people said.
As Kathie stepped out, a sharp pain shot through her foot,causing her to wobble. Keith quickly caught her before she could fall.
She had twisted her ankle while running from Randy earlier and had almost forgotten about it.
Melinda, who had been rushing over, saw Keith holdling Kathie and thought he was trying to drag her back into the car.
Melinda,carrying bags, charged forward, shouting, "Keith, you jerk! Let go of my friend right now!"
Hearing Melinda's voice, both Keith and Kathie turned to see her leap up and slap Keith across the face.

Keith and Kathie were stunned into silence.

Melinda stood protectively in front of Kathie. "Kathie, don't be afraid. I'm here to protect you."

Keith,furious,shouted,"Melinda, are you out of your mind? Why did you hit me?"

Melinda glared at him. "You think you can just take my friend? Think again! You can mess with others, but not my best friend."

.Kathie was touched by Melinda's fierce loyalty, but she knew she had to clear up the misunderstanding quickly to avoid any trouble for Melinda at work. Kathie hurriedly explained, "Melinda, I am so moved by your fierce protection, but this is a misunderstanding. Randy was trying to grab me.and Mr. Gray saved me. I twisted my ankle, and he caught me when I almost fell."
Melinda froze, looking at Keith's angry face. She awkwardly forced a smile,reached out to touch Keith's reddened cheek, and thought, 'Oh no, I'm in trouble now.'

"Mr. Gray, are you okay? Does it hurt? Should I blow on it?" Melinda asked cautiously.

"Now you're scared? You had the nerve to hit me just now," Keith retorted.

Melinda leaned in closer. "I'm sorry, I was reckless. If you're mad, you can hit me back. Hit me as many times as you want."
Kathie chimed in, "Mr. Gray, I'm sorry. Melinda was just worried about me. Please forgive her this once. If you need to hold someone accountable,let it be me."

Keith's face was dark and menacing. He had never been hit by a woman before.Melinda really didn't know what she was doing.

"I can't let this go!" he said coldly.

Melinda pleaded pitifully, "Mr. Gray, what can I do to make you forgive me?"

Keith took a deep breath and said, "From now on, you're my assistant until I say otherwise."

"Mr. Gray, my friend..."

'"Fine, I agree," Melinda interrupted Kathie,giving her a look to stay quiet.They couldn't afford to anger him further. Keith's expression softened a bit. "Fine, come with me to buy some things."


Melinda forced a smile. "Yes."

She handed her bags to Kathie. "Kathie, wish me luck. These are gifts for the kids. Please give them to them for me."
Kathie was worried. "Are you sure you'll be okay? He seems dangerous."


Melinda put on a brave face. "We'll see how it goes."

What else could she do? She had hit the CEO of their company,a powerful man in Elddria. She had to make it right.

Kathie couldn't follow them and watched as they left.

She felt bad. Melinda had gotten into trouble because of her. She hoped Keith wouldn't make things too difficult for Melinda.
As Kathie walked to the parking lot, she sensed someone following her.Could it be Randy again?
She quickened her pace, but two men appeared in front of her. Before she could react, a knife was pressed against her waist.

"Don't move, or you'll regret it."


"Who sent you?"

A van pulled up, and the men pushed her inside. "Don't ask questions.Get in."

Kathie had no choice but to stay calm and get in the van.

She was sandwiched between two men, both holding knives. She couldn't reach her phone to call for help.

The van drove to a remote area, and she knew this was bad. She was a nobody, and without calling the police, she had no chance of escaping.
The van stopped, and Kathie was taken to an abandoned building.

Inside, seven or eight burly men were smoking, drinking, and playing cards.

"Boss,we got her."
A man with tattooed arms, named Wayne Ross, stood up. He was their leader. He circled Kathie, looking pleased. "This woman is gorgeous,prettier than a movie star."
"Yeah, we couldn't take our eyes off her on the way here. We've never seen anyone so beautiful."
Kathie tried to back away but was blocked. "Who are you, and why did you bring me here?"
She had thought Randy was behind this, but now it seemed he wasn't involved.

Wayne grabbed her hand and led her to a table with divorce papers and a stock transfer agreement. "If you know what's good for you, sign these papers, and we'll let you go."
Kathie understood. The divorce papers were from Melissa and her daughter,trying to force her to sign. Randy probably didn't know about this.
The stock transfer agreement was Walter's way of getting her to give up her shares, so he had proof if her uncle's family caused trouble.

What a ruthless family, using such methods to force her.

"Did Melissa send you?" Kathie asked. "Don't ask questions. Just sign." Wayne said impatiently.

His lack of denial confirmed her suspicion. Melissa had no connections in Eldoria, except for her adopted brother. Raymond, whom Kathie had saved a few days ago. Were these his men?

If so,things might be easier.

Kathie asked. "Are you Raymond's men?"
###Chapter 36 The Miracle Doctor Appears

When Kathie mentioned Raymond's name, everyone in the room turned to look at her. Wayne grabbed her face and demanded, "How do you know we're his guys?"
Realizingshe had guessed right. Kathie felt a bit relieved. She shook off Wayne's hand and said seriously, "I saved Raymond's life. You can't hurt me."
Everyone burst into laughter at her words. Wayne slapped her face. "Kathie, you must be kidding. Raymond ordered us to grab you and said we could do whatever we wanted with you. Think before you lie."
The others joined in the mockery, grabbing her shoulders and pinning her to the table. "Sign the papers nicely, and we might let you leave alive.Otherwise,we can do a lot of nasty things to you that you won't like."
Kathie was furíous. "I'm not lying. I'll sign the papers, but first, let Raymond come see me."
Wayne slapped her again. "You think you can just demand to see Raymond? Who do you think you are?"
Blood trickled from the corner of Kathie's mouth as she glared at the man in front of her. "Raymond had a stroke and was saved just a few days ago.Is this how you treat his savior?"

Wayne frowned and exchanged glances with his guys. "You seem to know a lot. Are you the miracle doctor?"
Kathie nodded confidently. "Yes, I am. If you don't believe me, call him."


Wayne hesitated, not wanting to harm his boss's savior.

A subordinate reminded him, "Don't be fooled by this woman. I heard the healer is a skillful doctor. She's just trying to trick us into letting her go."

"I agree. I don't think she is young enough to have such advanced medical skills. She looks more like a con artist," another added.
Kathie snapped, "That just shows how ignorant you are. A true doctor like me is right here, and you don't even recognize it."
Wayne, enraged, slapped her again. "You dare insult us?Looks like you need a lesson. Hold her down while I teach her some manners."
As the men approached with ill intent. Kathie grabbed a pen from the table and swiftly jabbed it into one of Wayne's pressure points,immobilizing him.
The others moved to intervene, but Kathie shouted, "Stay back! Look closely. I've hit a pressure point, and he can't move. Only someone skilled in acupuncture could do this. I am the healer. Call Raymond now."
Wayne, unable to move, signaled with his eyes. "You idiots, call Raymond and verify this."
His subordinates quickly dialed the number, and Raymond's voice came through, "Is everything done?"

"Boss, this woman wants to talk to you."

"I don't have tíme for her. Just tell her to sign the papers, and we won't kill her."
Kathie,fearing Raymond would hang up, quickly identified herself. "Raymond, I'm the healer Clayton has been looking for."

Raymond paused, then asked, "Are you really the one who saved me?"

"I used acupuncture to bring you back from the brink of death.Without me, you'd be in a vegetative state. You wouldn't treat your savior like this, would you?" Kathie said.
Raymond's voice softened. "TIl be there right away. Take good care of the healer."
His subordinates, now respectful, brought a chair for Kathie. "We didn't recognize you. Please forgive us."
Wayne,still immobilized, apologized, "It's all my fault. Do whatever you want to me, but please spare my life."
His subordinates pleaded as well. "Yes, please spare Wayne."

Kathie tapped Wayne's neck twice, and he regained movement, collapsing at her feet.
He had slapped Kathie twice, and he knew Raymond would punish him severely.

Wayne begged,"It's all my fault. I'll punish myself until you're satisfied."

He then began slapping himself hard, the sound echoing in the room.

His subordinates tried to help. "Please forgive him. We were just following orders."

Kathie realized the real culprit was the one who gave the orders. "Fine,I'll forgive you this time. But if I see you bullying women again. I'll make sure you're bedridden for life."

"Never again. Thank you," Wayne said hurriedly.

Raymond arrived shortly after, surprised to see the young and beautiful Kathie. He couldn't believe she was the legendary doctor.

Kathie examined him and massaged a few pressure points, making him feel much better. Raymond, deeply grateful, apologized along with his subordinates. "We were wrong today. You saved my life. If you ever need anything,just ask."
"That's not necessary. Just don't trouble me in the future," Kathie replied,doing her job for the money.
Raymond promised, "Of course. I guarantee no one in Eldoria will bother you again."

Kathie asked, "Was it Melissa who ordered you to capture me?"

Raymond's face darkened. "Yes, it was Melissa. I'll deal with her for almost harming my savior."
Kathie noticed the religious pendant around his neck and had an idea.She looked at him seriously, her expression growing more grave, making Raymond uneasy.

As a doctor, she must have seen something.

"What's wrong with me?" Raymond asked.

Kathie said seriously, "Mr. Barnes, at your age, you shouldn't have had a stroke. As a healer. I checked you thoroughly and found signs of a curse."

"A curse? What do you mean?"

"When's your birthday?"

Raymond told her without hesitation.

Kathie suddenly realized. "That explains it. Your birthday clashes with Melissa's. Her fate brings misfortune to those close to her, which is why you had a stroke. If you don't cut ties with her, your life will be in danger."

Raymond's face changed. No wonder things always went wrong for him. It was because of Melissa. In their line of work, they believed in such things. His pendant showed his belief.
Kathie wanted him to avoid Melissa. Without her protector, Melissa would be nothing in Eldoria. Since Melissa wanted to ruin her, Kathie would ruin Melissa first.

"You're right. I know what to do," Raymond replied.
###Chapter 37 Take a Big Gamble with Her

Raymond hadI been involved with Melissa mainly because he was after Walter's money and wanted to take over his company shares. But now,with his life hanging by a thread, what good were those assets to him? He needed to cut ties with Melissa immediately.
"You get it now. From now on, avoid doing anything shady if you want to stay safe," Kathie said.

"Yeah, I'll listen to you," Raymond replied.

Raymond initially wanted to drive Kathie home, but she refused, not even accepting his apology gift. It was better to keep her distance from people like him.
Kathie got back into her car but didn't headhome right away. Instead, she uploaded all the evidence of Melissa's embezzlement and her affairs with company executives to the company's website.
If Melissa wanted to play games, Kathie would make sure she played big.

Water was still in his office, working, when his secretary rushed in. "Mr.Cavendish, something big has happened. You need to check your computer."

Walter opened his laptop and felt his blood run cold. Recalling the scandaous video he had seen, he realized Melissa had been deceiving him.

He rushed home, where Melissa was in the living room trying on new clothes.Seeing him, she picked up a piece of lingerie and struck a seductive pose.

"Sweetheart, you're just in time. How do you like my new outfit?" Melissa said. Walter suddenly remembered how Melissa loved buying such lingerie but never wore it for him. She always claimed she was insecure about her body and only bought them to admire.
It turned out she was brazenly cheating on him with other men right under his nose.

Walter walked over and slapped her hard, sending her sprawling onto the couch.

Melissa looked up in shock. "Sweetheart, what's gotten into you? Why did you hit me again?"
Walter grabbed her by the throat, glaring at her with fury. "You deceitful woman,you made a fool out of me. You've been cheating on me with all sorts of men, making me a laughingstock."
"What do you mean? Sweetheart, have you been misled by Kathie again? I haven't done anything to betray you."
"You're still lying? Your lovers have all confessed. I'm divorcing you,and you'll leave with nothing."

Walter let go of her and made her look at the company's website.

Last time, Kathie had sent the evidence only to Walter's email, sparing him some dignity. But this time, their actions had left Kathie disheartened,so she made the scandal public.

Melissa trembled as she read. Hadn't Raymond said he had Kathie under control? How did she manage to post all this?

"It's not true, sweetheart. These are fake," she tried to explain.

Walter didn't want to see her disgusting face anymore. He grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to the door, shovi ng her out. "Get out, you 
wretch. Wait for the divorce papers."
Ignoring her pleas. Walter slammed the door shut and refused to open it no matter how much she begged.
Melissa shook her head. She couldn't be thrown out like this! She quickly took a cab to the hospital to find Raymond, hoping he would help her.
Usually, Raymond's subordinates would warmly welcome Melissa, but this time they treated her like a pariah, not even letting her near his ward.
"Mr. Barnes ordered us to kick you out if we saw you," one of the subordinates said.
Melissa couldn't believe it. "Do you know who I am? I'm Mr. Barnes'sworn sister. You usually can't wait to curry favor with me, and now you dare to kick me out?"
Raymond's subordinate warned, "The boss won't see you. Leave now and stop being an eyesore."
Melissa couldn't believe it and called Raymond, only to find out he had blocked her. She couldn't understand what had happened in just one day.

"I need to see Raymond. Let me in," she said, her voice filled with urgency.

Raymond was her only hope now. If he didn't protect her,what would she do in Eldoria?

She desperately tried to push her way into the ward, but a woman coming out slapped her. It was Raymond's wife.

"Shut up, you wretch," Raymond's wife shouted.

She had long wanted to deal with Melissa, and now Melissa had walked right into her trap. Melissa grabbed her hand. "Mrs. Barnes, it's me. Melissa. I need to see Raymond. It's urgent."

Raymond's wife sneered. "He won't see you."

"Impossible. Raymond has always cared for me. You must be blocking me on purpose." Melissa couldn't believe her sworn brother,who had protected her for over a decade, would suddenly ignore her.
From inside the room, Raymond's angry voice boomed, "Melissa, listen to me. This is the last time I'm speaking to you. If you ever show up in front of me again, I'll make sure you end up dead."

"Why? Raymond,what did I do wrong?"


"Our deal is off. Get lost."

He meant he didn't want the Cavendish family's money or shares anymore.He wanted to cut ties with her.

But he had been so interested before. Why the sudden change?

"Is it because of Kathie? She's a terrible woman. Don't listen to her lies,"Melissa said.

Melissa dared to slander his savior, making Raymond furious. "Get this crazy woman out of here. If she shows up again, break her legs."

Raymond's wife signaled his subordinate to grab Melissa by the hair and throw her out. With such a display, Melissa wouldn't dare come back.

At Kathie's villa in the Eldoria suburbs.

Jonathan had spent the afternoon with the kids. As the sun began to set,he wondered why their mom hadn't returned yet. Was she really planning to leave the kids with him? His phone buzzed in his pocket. He cleared his throat. "Eileen, keep an eye on them. I'm going inside for some water."

Eileen nodded obediently. "Go ahead."

Jonathan went inside and locked the door. With Kathie not around, he could finally take his phone out.

Seeing it was Keith calling, he answered.

"Jonathan. I have something to report," Keith said.


"Spit it out."

Keith teased, "You don't sound too enthusiastic."

Jonathan was worried about Kathie and wasn't in the mood for chit-chat.


"Are you going to talk or not?"

"Why so grumpy? Are you worried about someone? Fuanny thing,I actually ran into her today."

"You mean Kathie?"

Jonathan's voice rose several octaves. "How did you see her?"

"I saw her being harassed by Randy on the street and stepped in to help.Aren't you grateful?"

"That damn Randy, still bothering her."

"Well, they're not divorced yet. We can't interfere. If you like her, convince her to get a divorce. Then you'll have a chance."

.Jonathan was annoyed. "Who saidI I like her?"

Keith continued to tease him. "Only you know if you like her. But I have to say, she's very pretty, just my type."

"Keith, do you want a beating?" Jonathan snapped.

"See,you're already worked up. I have something important to tell you,and I need compensation for my emotional distress."

"Are you crazy?"
"You have no heart. For the first time in my life, I got hit by a woman,and it was one who usually wouldn't dare speak up around me."
Jonathan laughed heaftily at Keith's story, much to Keith's dismay.

"You think it's funny? I got misunderstood because I helped Kathie.Melinda won't get away with this."
###Chapter 38 The Stingy and Malicious Woma

Jonathan leaned back in his chair, his voicedripping with sarcasm. "You can't really blame Melinda. I mean, you're a notorious playboy. She was just worried about her best friend getting caught up with you."
Keith rolled his eyes. "How could someone as universally adored as me be a bad guy?"
"That's just your delusion," Jonathan shot back without missing a beat.

The sound of excited children echoed from the yard. Kathie was back.Jonathan quickly hung up the phone and hid.
"Mommy, look! I can knock the bottles off the wall," Kyle eagerly showed off to his mom.

Kathie clapped her hands. "Wow, Kyle, that's amazing!"

Zachary held up a ring toss. "Mommy, look! I can get all the rings on the pegs."

Kathie gave him a thumbs up. "Great job, Zachary!"

Eileen leaned in with her little face, and Kathie gave her a kiss. "Eileen is
awesome too. Cheer for your brothers."

Jonathan wheeled himself out, his face cold and stern. "Why are you so late today?"

Kathie, noticing his irritability, reminded him, "Didn't you say I could come back whenever I wanted?"

Jonathan fell silent.

He had indeed said that, which only made him angrier. Seeing Kathie staring at him curiously, he quickly changed the subject."I've got dust in my hair. Help me wash it."
"Fine, but why are you being so grumpy about it?"

Kathie pushed Jonathan in his wheelchair to the bathroom, placed a towel on his lap, and had him lie back while she adjusted the water temperature.
He had to admit, Kathie was incredibly meticulous, taking care of him in every possible way.

Jonathan suddenly noticed her cheek was swollen. What happened?

Keith had only mentioned Randy bothering her, not that he had hit her.Besides, knowing Keith, if Randy had actually hit Kathie,Keith would have dealt with Randy himself.

"Why is your face swollen?" Jonathan asked.

Kathie instinctively turned her head away. "I bumped into something on the way back. It's nothing."

When a woman said it was nothing, it was definitely something.

"You're lying. What really happened? Tell me."

Kathie frowned and covered his eyes. "Don't move. I'm rinsing your hair.By the way, telling you won't help."

Jonathan was unhappy. "If someone bullied you, I can deal with them."

Kathie gave a bitter smile. "You can't even stand up right now. How are you going to deal with anyone? Argue them to death? It's over. Don't ask anymore."

Jonathan was speechless. Given his current condition, it was understandable she didn't believe in him. She didn't want to talk about it, but he would find out.

Jonathan opened his eyes as warm water flowed over his head. Kathie's fingers moved gently through his hair, making his heart flutter.
She leaned forward slightly while washing his hair, and he almost brushed against her chest several times. Even without touching, the scent from her body made him react.
Remembering what Keith had said, he asked curiouisly, "When are you planning to divorce Randy?"
Kathie replied without thinking, "I haven't decided."

Jonathan's mood soured again. "Don't you hate him? The kids are all settled in school now.Why keep him around?"
"Why are you so interested in this? They want to force me to divorce, so I won't. Just to spitethem."
"That just makes it look like you're dragging Randy along on purpose,giving him an excuse to come after you."

"I don't want them to have it easy," Kathie muttered.

Jonathan sneered. "Only you know the real reason."

Kathie didn't like thatand smeared foam on his face. "Shut up.


"You vindictive woman."

"I'll do what I want. Say another word, and I'll shove foam in your mouth.

"

Kathie was indeed petty and vindictive.

After a heated argument, Kathie finally finished washing his hair, dried it,
and wheeled him back to his room.
Seeing his dejected look, she couldn't help but laugh. "Seven,cheer up.Remember, don't argue with women."
"Dr. Cavendish, you've shown me the many sides of a doctor.Too bad there's no place to file a complaint."
Kathie smiled smugly. "Good that you know. Cooperate from now on, and everything will be fine."
As soon as she left, Jonathan texted Ben, instructing him to investigate what had happened to Kathie. If someone had hit her, they should deal with it without reporting back.
Night fell, and Melissa returned to Walter, crying and begging for reconciliation. She had no one left to rely on. If Walter divorced her, she would have nothing.
Walter let her in but had already instructed the maid to pack al her belongings. "Take your stuff and get out."
Melissa knelt at his feet. "Honey, I've been with you for over twenty years and helped you with so much. Are you really going to throw me out without any consideration?"
Walter was merciless. "You've disgraced the Cavendish family. You don't belong here."
Melissa continued to plead. "I'll change. I'll do whatever you want from now on. Just give me another chance."
"You have no chance. I've been tired of you for a long time. You just made it easier for me to decide to get rid of you," Walter said bluntly.
Melissa couldn't believe it and begged desperately. "Please, for the sake of our past, don't kick me out."
"Oh, how shameless can you be? Mr. Cavendish already said he doesn't want you, and you're still begging?" A seductive voice came from the second floor. Melissa looked up in shock to see Walter's secretary, wearing her new nightgown, strutting in front of her.

"You two are together?" Melissa was stunned.

Walter beckoned the secretary over, wrapping his arm around her slim waist and caressing her young, pretty face. "Look at how young and beautiful she is. Now look at your old, haggard face. The men you used to seduce only did it because of my money. Now, even if you tried to sell yourself,not even a john would want you."
Melissa, furious, shouted, "Walter, you hypocritical bastard! You can keep mistresses, but I can't be with other men? Now you want to kick me out?Dream on. If you want a divorce, you'll have to give me half of everything."
Walter laughed coldly, squeezing the secretary's firm butt. "Baby, go upstairs and wait for me. Let me deal with this shrew first."
The secretary stood on tiptoe to kiss him, then threw a provocative glance at Melissa. She had often bullied Walter's female subordinates, but now it was her turn to be kicked out. "Hurry up, darling. I'll miss you."
Melissa lunged at her, but Walter stopped her and threw her to the ground."Melissa, get it straight. You're nothing now."
Melissa pounded the floor in anger. Her perfect life had been ruined by Kathie.

Walter sat on the couch, looking down at her arrogantly. "For old times'sake, I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars. Take it and get out of my sight."
###Chapter 39 Mutual Blackmail

Melissa couldn't help but laugh. "Walter, are you seriously trying to get rid of me like I'm some homeless person? I told you, I want half of the assets.or we're going to court."
Walter stared at her with a smug look. "Melissa, years ago, you bribed the obstetrician to have them rough up Kathie's mom, Scarlett Hughes, in the delivery room. That led to Scarlett dying during childbirth."
Melissa's face went pale, and she looked at him in horror. "So,you knew all along?"
"Not only did I know, but I also know where those doctors are now."

Melissa shook her head. "I didn't think you were this ruthless. If you knew all this, why didn't you help Scarlett back then?"
Walter smirked. "If she had lived, how could I have inherited her assets?Now you should know, if I expose this, you'll be a murderer. And Kathie's been looking for them all these years. If she finds them, you're done for."
"Walter, you actually kept this card up your sleeve. You're so cruel."Melissa never dreamed that her past schemes would become Walter's leverage against her.
Walter shrugged smugly. "You think you can fight me? You're not even in my league. Now take the money and get lost."
Melissa stared at him and burst into laughter. "You think you can control me like this? How did Scarlett's baby die back then?"

Walter's face stiffened, and he glared at her, gritting his teeth. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

"I wanted to kill Scarlett and keep the baby, so the baby she gave birth to was still alive. You rushed in first, and soon after, the baby died. I asked the doctors, and they didn't do anything, but the baby still suffocated to death."
Walter vehemently denied it. "The baby was dead at birth."

"You're lying. You were worried that the baby would take a share of your assets. You already had two daughters and didn't want another one to divide the inheritance, so you killed her to end it all."
Walter slapped her and grabbed her by the throat. "If you dare to say another word, I'll strangle you."
"You're so agitated, it proves I'm right. If you don't give me the money, I'll expose this. Let's see if Kathie will kill you. At worst, we'll go to hell together."
Melissa wasn't one to be easily bullied. If Walter was ruthless, she would be too.
Walter released his grip when he saw she was struggling to breathe and warned her, "If a third person finds out about this, I'll kill you."
"I just want the money. I'm not interested in anything else." At this point,all she wanted was the money.
Walter nodded angrily. "Half the assets are impossible, but I'll make sure you're satisfied. Wait for my message."

At least there was hope. Melissa left with her luggage without looking back.

Walter was a heartless man who could even kill his own child. She wanted nothing more to do with him.

The next morning, Kathie received photos from an unknown sender.
 
She opened them and was shocked by the bloody scenes.She initially thought it was a prank, but then she realized the people beaten beyond recognition were Wayne, who had kidnapped her, and his accomplices. They were all badly beaten.

Could it be Raymond avenging her?

During breakfast. Jonathan asked her out of the blue, "Feeling better today?"

Last night. Ben had taken some men to capture Wayne and his gang and beat them up. The photos had been sent to Kathie for her to see.

"I'm always in a good mood."


"Nothing special?"

Kathie shook her head. "That's a weird question. What's so special?"

Jonathan smirked. It seemed those thugs had been beaten for nothing.Kathie didn't even care about them.

"Never mind, forget I said anything."

Kathie handed him a piece of toast. "After breakfast, I'll take you to the hot springs in the back hills. It's good for your muscles."

The three kids waved their little hands. "Mommy, we want to go too."

Kathie ruffled their hair. "This natural hot spring is too hot for you. Next time, I'll take you to a hot spring that's suitable for you."

She was worried the high temperature would scald their delicate skin. This hot spring was too unpredictable for them.

Jonathan asked, "My skin is delicate too.Won't I get burned?"

Kathie rolled her eyes at him. "Your skin is thick. Boiling water wouldn't hurt you. What are you afraid of?"

Jonathan was speechless.

Kathie was not only fierce but also sharp-tongued.

Eileen worriedly said. "Mommy, take good care of Seven. Don't let him get burned."

Kathie seized the opportunity to ask, "Eileen, do you like his look?"


Jonathan gasped. What was Kathie up to now?

He quickly prompted Eileen. "Eileen likes me for who I am. Even if I'm not handsome, she'd still like me."
Eileen thought for a moment. "No, I like your look."


Jonathan was heartbroken and silent.

Kathie gloated. "Someone's going to be disappointed."

Eileen continued, "But I like him as a person even more. He feels like Daddy."

Kathie was stunned. Eileen's evaluation of him was too high.

Jonathan felt vindicated and lifted Eileen up. "Eileen, you're the best. I'm so glad I dote on you. Drink more milk and grow tall."
Kyle and Zachary shook their heads. They thought their mommy and Jonathan were both childish.

Kathie assigned the three kids some reading tasks. With the big dog guarding the yard,she felt at ease.

The path to the back hills was a bit steep. Kathie had to exert some effort to push Jonathan up. Jonathan watched her panting and made a mental note of her kindness,

vowing to repay her tenfold in the future.

He handed her a tissue. "You've worked hard. Have some water."

Kathie smiled sweetly,tugging at Jonathan's heartstrings.


"You do care about people," she said.
Jonathan gave a bitter smile. Everyone around him said he was cold-

hearted. No one eversaid he cared about people.


And it was true.
Everyone in the Berkeley family had their own agendas, all vying for
power and profit. He couldn't afford to let his guard down.

Only with Kathie could he truly relax and be himself.

Kathie started undressing him. "Get ready for the hot spring."

Jonathan nodded, but when he saw the water bubbling and someone
boiling eggs nearby, he quickly grabbed his clothes.

"Dr. Cavendish, are you sure this water is safe? Look, someone's boiling
eggs over there. This water could scald me," he said.

Kathie tried to pry his hand off. "Why are you so nervous? Do you think I'

d harm you? Trust me, the water temperature here is fine."

Jonathan refused. "I don't believe you. Unless you test it first."

Kathie glared at him. "Are you getting in or not?"

Jonathan shook his head. "No."

Kathie nodded. "Fine, you asked for it." With that, she flipped his
wheelchair, sending him splashing into the hot spring. Jonathan struggled to get up, shouting angrily. "You're trying to kill me!"
###Chapter 40 The Pervert Takes Advantage oHer
Kathie crossed her arms, glaring at him with disdain. "Do you still think it s too hot now?"
Jonathan finally realized the water wasn't as hot as he thought. He had assumed the bubbling water would scald him, but it was just a bit warmer than his bathwater at home.
He coughed twice. "You looked so fierce anddidn't explain clearly."

Kathie shrugged. "I told you it was fine, but you didn't believe me. What else could I do? Being straightforward works with you."
Jonathan gritted his teeth. This annoying Kathie always found ways to mess with him.

"At least I'm still injured. Aren't you afraid I'll drown?" he retorted.

"If it really comes to that, I'll just plan your funeral," Kathie teased.

Jonathan was speechless. She really was a heartless woman.

"Alright, I don't want to argue with you. Get out in half an hour," Kathie continued.

Kathie was about to turn around when Jonathan suddenly shouted,"Watch out, there's a snake behind you."

Kathie panicked for a moment but quickly calmed down. He must be lying to scare her as revenge for pushing him into the water.

"Do you think I'm stupid? I'm not falling for the same trick twice," she said.

"I'm not lying. There's a snake about six feet behind you, moving closer."
Kathie felt a bit panicked but stubbornly lifted her chin. "Even if there were ten snakes. I wouldn't be scared."

Jonathan sighed. "You'll regret it later."
"I don't have time to play with you. I'll wait up front." Kathie turned around and indeed saw a black snake. She screamed and jumped into the water, landing right in Jonathan's arms.
To be precise, Jonathan had anticipated what would happen when she turned around, so he opened his arms to catch her.
Kathie clung to him like a sloth, wrapping her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist.

Jonathan stifled a laugh. "Do you believe me now?"

Kathie was trembling,burying her head in his chest, too scared to look up."You should have explained it clearly."
Jonathan felt wronged. "I did explain, but you didn't listen. What could I do?"

Kathie had said something similar earlier, now feeling a bit embarrassed. "Check if the snake is gone."
Jonathan teased, "Oh no, it's coming towards us. It looks like it's getting into the water."

"Ah!" Kathie screamed, tightening her grip, causing Jonathan's body to react immediately.

This woman was really confusing him. Every time she got close, it stirred his desires.

Kathie's clothes were wet, and he could faintly see her pink underwear through the clinging fabric. Her smooth back and toned abs were clearly Feeling Jonathan's body aroused, Kathie shamefully looked up, meeting his lustful gaze, as if he wanted to ravish her right there.
"Don't look, or you'll regret it," Kathie warned.

Jonathan glanced at the shore. "The snake's in the water."

Kathie clung tighter, terrified. "Get rid of the snake, I'm scared."

Snakes were common in the mountains, and Kathie was always afraid of them.rarely getting close.
She had come to treat him, not expecting to encounter her worst fear.

Jonathan held her and slowly moved back. "Kiss me, and I'll get rid of it."


Kathie was speechless.
"You're taking advantage of me," she whispered, gritting her teeth. In front of a snake, she was just a scaredy-cat.
Jonathan sighed. "I'm risking my life to get rid of the snake. Just give me some courage."
Kathie hated being threatened. "No way. We can both get bitten."

Jonathan let go. "You're right. At least we'll have company. It's getting closer,swimming around."

Kathie shivered at his description, goosebumps rising. She had no choice but to grab his face and kiss him hard. "Is that enough? Now get rid of the snake."

Jonathan was thrilled. He loved this feeling.

He pretended to wave a towel, holding her waist with one hand. Kathie was incredibly tempting, with her curvy figure and refreshing scent.making him want to make love to her.
If he could, he'd pin her down and take her right now.

Feeling his Adam's apple bobbing, Kathie puzzled. "Is it gone?"


"Not yet."
Jonathan didn't want to let go. Even though he was injured, he held on.

His friends always teased him for being cold, never imagining he'd aet so shamelessly.

Kathie felt it shouldn't take this long. She cautiously looked up, seeing no snake, just him waving a towel in the water.

He didn't realize she had caught on.

Kathie deliberately asked, "Seven, is the snake gone?"

Jonathan was enjoying himself. "Not yet. Hold on tighter."

Kathie bit his shoulder hard, making him let go.

She climbed ashore, checked for the snake, and then scolded him, "You're such a pervert, taking advantage of me."
Jonathan laughed. "Dr. Cavendish, be fair. Did I force you to hug me? You jumped into my arms. If anything, you seduced me."

Kathie gritted her teeth. "The snake was gone long ago, but you wouldn't let go."

Jonathan looked innocent. "I just got rid of it. You must have missed it."

"You..." Kathie was at a loss, feeling taken advantage of but unable to argue.
Jonathan sighed. "I meant well but got misunderstood. Next time, don't ask me for help. I don't want to be seen as a pervert."

Kathie was sure he was messing with her.

"Seven, you'd better not let me catch you, or you'll regret it," she said.

Jonathan admired her perfect body, gesturing up and down. "Dr.Cavendish,you have a great figure."
Kathie quickly covered herself. "You jerk, shameless."

Watching her run dff in a panic, Jonathan couldn't help but laugh.Sparring with her was so much fun. Spending a lifetime like this wouldn't be so bad.
Half an hour later, Kathie helped him up, checking his condition.


Jonathan saw her stern face,still angry.

Kathie was indeed angry. She had never lost her composure like this.

"Are you still mad? I'll apoogize," Jonathan said.

Kathie stayed silent. and Jonathan reached out.

"If you're really mad, hit me," he continued.

"Seven, are you married? When will you regain your memory?" Kathie suddenly asked.

If he was single, their interactions were more acceptable. But if he had a family, Kathie needed to keep her distance.

Jonathan firmly assured, "I promise I'm not."

Kathie was skeptical. "How can you be sure? An amnesiac can't be certain.We should keep our distance. If you do this again, I'll use a needle to keep you in check."

Jonathan fell silent.
###Chapter 41 He Is Good at Disguising
Jonathan was still trying to get closer to her, but Kathie had found a way to keep him at arm's length, leaving him with no way to express his frustration.

"Come on, this is unnecessary," he said.

Kathie opened her bag and said seriously, "From now on, I'm carrying silver needles with me. You better behave, or I'll make sure you lose your manhood for good."
Jonathan was speechless. "Dr. Cavendish, isn't that a bit extreme? We haven't done anything inappropriate."
Kathie glared at him. They had just kissed earlier, wasn't that overly intimate?
Jonathan caught on and grinned. "I'll behave from now on. It's all my fault."
"I'll push you out to get some sun, and then we can soak in the hot springs again before heading back."
There was no denying it, Kathie was a great companion-positive, smart,kind, and hardworking. There weren't many women in Eldoria who could compare to her.
The second soak in the hot springs went smoothly. Kathie pushed him back,sweating profusely.
Jonathan felt bad for making her do all this hard work.′′D.Cavendish,will I need to keep soaking in the hot springs?"
Kathie nodded. "Yes. Starting tomorrow, we'll do medicinal baths at home to stimulate the nerves in your legs." "Next time. let me know in advance. I'll see if I can find someone to help."Jonathan didn't want her to suffer. If needed, he could call Ben to help out.
Kathie laughed. "You don't know anyone else. Who would help you? It's fine. I'll just consider it exercise."
"There are people in the nearby village. Someone might see a petite woman like you and offer to help."
"You're overthinking it. There's no such thing as a free lunch. If it comes to that. I have other friends," Kathie replied.
"I can pay them. I don' want you to get tired."

Kathie couldn't help but laugh. He was considerate, worried about her getting tired, but wanted to use her money to hire help. What was the point?
That evening, Kathie prepared some medicine for him.

Jonathan had been worried she might hold a grudge from earlier and add something to the medicine, but everything was normal.
"How do your legs feel after soaking in the hot springs?" Kathie asked.

"I could move them a bit in the water, but now it seems I can't."

Kathie checked him over and nodded. "That's a normal reaction. After the medicinal bath tomorrow, you'll feel a more noticeable difference. Drink your medicine." "Next time. let me know in advance. I'll see if I can find someone to help."Jonathan didn't want her to suffer. If needed, he could call Ben to help out.
Kathie laughed. "You don't know anyone else. Who would help you? It's fine. I'll just consider it exercise."

Not only that, she checked any other containers that could hold water. "Get some rest. Tomorrow's acupuncture will bepainful," Kathie said.

Jonathan could sense that Kathie was keeping her distance, even arguing with him less.

Where was the fun in that?
As Kathie reached the door, he suddenly spoke up, "Dr. Cavendish, when I close my eyes now, all I see is you soaking wet from earlier."

Kathie was stunned.
Jonathan awkwardly śmiled. "Dr. Cavendish, ifI said it was a side effect of the medicine, would you believe me?"
Kathie clenched her fists and approached him. Jonathan called out loudly, "Kids. I need help!"
Kathie stopped, panicking. "Seven, what are you shouting about?"

Eileen came running, her voice preceding her. "Seven, what's wrong?"


Kyle followed closely. "Is Seven hurt?"

"What happened?" Zachary joined in.

Jonathan smirked. "You were gonna mess with a defenseless guy like me.I had to protect myself."

Eileen reached the door, worried. "Seven, what happened?"

Kathie pinched Eileen's cheek, stopping the other two kids from running in. "Don't run so fast,you'll trip."

Jonathan said sadly, "I can't feel my legs at all. Your mommy called me useless, and it hurt my feelings."

Kathie retorted, "I didn't say that," Eileen held her hand. "Mommy, didn't I tell you? Girls should be gentle,not always fierce. Look how scared you made Seven. He's injured, you need to be patient."
Kathie forced a smile, unsure who was more mature between her and her daughter. "Don't be fooled by him. Mommy doesn't scold the injured."
Zachary frowned. "But Mommy, you often scold Seven."

Jonathan nodded. "See? Kids are perceptive. They see you scolding me all the time."
Kyle said, "If Seven did something wrong. Mommy can scold him. But if it's because of his injury, Mommy shouldn't scold him. He's already pitiful."

Kathie was speechless. Pitiful?
Jonathan nodded pitifully, making Kathie grit her teeth in frustration. He was like a cunning fox, good at pretending.
"Alright, let's go to bed and let him rest," Kathie said helplessly.


Eileen was worried. "Should I sleep with Seven?"


"No!" Kathie firmly refused.

Eileen looked up at her. "Why not, Mommy?"

Kathie picked her up. "Little girls should keep their distance from boys."She didn't add that this was especially true for strangers, to avoid hurting Jonathan's pride. After all, losing his memory wasn't his fault.

Eileen obediently agreed. "Then tell us a story,Mommy."

"Okay, back to your room." Tonight, she'd let him off the hook.

Jonathan lay back with his hands behind his head. He enjoyed seeing Kathie frustrated but unable to do anything about it. It made life interesting.
At ten o'clock that night. Melissa, with nowhere else to go, arrived at Shirley's house.
Shirley was both angry anid anxious when she heard Melissa wanted a divorce. "Mom, why didn't you discuss such a big decision with me? At least hold on for a bit. If you divorce now. I'll be a laughingstock."
Melissa was furious. "You think I didn't try? He insisted on divorcing me!He kicked me out during the day and brought his secretary home in the afternoon. He wants me to leave with nothing."
Shirley was exasperated. "Dad is really heartless. After more than twenty years together, he can just abandon you."
Melissa gritted her teeth. "It's all Kathie's fault. She caused my divorce and made Raymond cut ties with me. Now I have nothing."
"She's still clinging to Randy, refusing to divorce, making me a laughingstock. I don't know what to do." Shirley was at her wit's end.
Melissa clenched her fists and said fiercely, "Don't worry, Shirley. I'll deal with Kathie. I won't let her get away with this."
If it weren't for Kathie's return, she would still be the envy of others, a wealthy lady with endless money and young men to keep her company.Even if something happened, Raymond would cover for her. But now,because of Kathie, she had lost everything.

No matter what, she had to make Kathie disappear.

The next morning, the dogs in the yard wouldn't stop barking.Kathie went out to see Randy, that scumbag, had come again. "What do you want?" Kathie said coldly.

"Kathie. I need to talk to you. Can you come out?"

She sneered, "Are you here to catch me again? Do you want to get bitten by dogs?"
Kathie moved to open the gate. and Randy, scared, ran back to his car,ready to jump in at any moment.
###Chapter 42 Like to Use a Firm Hand
Randy explained. "I'm not here to arrest you. Last time. I just wanted to talk about the kids."
Kathie scoffed. "My kids have nothing to do with you. What do you want?"

Seeing that she hadn't opened the door. Randy took a step forward. "Don't get upset. I'm here for Bob."
He was here for his and Shirley's son? Kathie was a bit confused.


"Just say what you need to say." Kathie said.

"The school won't accept Bob. You're pretty close with Keith, right? I was hoping you could put in a good word for us and get them to accept Bob."
Randy didn't really want to ask her for help, but Shirley had been making a scene at home, insisting that Bob had to get into this school. He had no choice but to swallow his pride and ask Kathie.
Kathie immediately understood his intention. He had seen her leave with Keith and assumed she had some sort of relationship with him that could help get Bob into the school.
"No way! With your son's behavior, I'd be worried he'd hurt other kids.The school made a wise choice not accepting him," she retorted.
"How can you say that? If Bob isn't doing well, I'll teach him patiently. He's only three years old. Do you expect me to just give up on him?"

Kathie kindly advised, "If you really care about him, you should focus on teaching him manners and respect first. Otherwise, he'll cause a lot of trouble in the future."

"So,you're still not willing to help. We're family, for heaven's sake. How can you be so heartless? If you agree to help, I promise I won't bother you again." Randy clearly didn't understand her pont.

Kathie was speechless. "Talking to someone as dense as you is exhausting.I don't have those connections.Go home."
"You're lying. I saw you hugging Keith. Don't tell me you have nothing to do with him. Kathie, you're such a lowlife." Randy was furious. Why could other men touch her, but he couldn't?
Kathie gritted her teeth and opened the door, calling to her dogs,"Go.get this scumbag."
Three large dogs charged out, scaring Randy into running back to his car.As he shut the door, one of the dogs managed to bite him, making him scream in pain.
"Kathie, you only know how to sic dogs on people," he shouted.

"For scum like you, dogs are the best solution. Go get a rabies shot and stop barking like a mad dog."
Randy angrily honked his horn, trying to scare the dogs away, but it was useless.
The noise was so annoying that Jonathan in the yard threw a rock,smashing his windshield into a spiderweb of cracks, making him shudder.
Kathie turned around and gave Jonathan a thumbs up. "You're actually useful,"she said.

Jonathan smiled proudly. For someone like Randy, there was no need to hold back. He waved Kyle and Zachary over. "Now it's your turn to practice, See where I hit? Try to aim there."

Kyle and Zachary picked up stones and threw them. Though not as accurate as Jonathan, they managed to hit the car roof and windows, making a racket that drove Randy to the brink of madness.

Eileen clapped. "Good job. Throw more stones."

Randy had no choice but to drive away in disgrace, shouting threats as he left. "Kathie, just you wait. I'll find a way to deal with you."
Kathie wasn't afraid. She shouted at the car, "Come at me if you dare."


She called the dogs back and took her three kids inside.

Jonathan used the excuse of getting dressed to secretly message Ben,asking him to arrange for someone to deal with Randy on the road.
Breakfast was especially delicious that day, and Jonathan praised the kids."You've improved a lot. You've learned a new skill."
Kathie reminded them, "Be careful not to hurt innocent people. Remember,learning this isfor self-defense, not bullying."
Jonathan nodded. "Your mom's right. Throwing stones is only good for long-distance attacks. This afternoon, I'll teach you some self-defense techniques for dealing wih taller people. Eileen, you too."
The kids nodded excitedly, but Kathie was curious. "Seven,were you a gangster in the past? Why do you only teach fighting?"
Jonathan was speechless. Her mind always wandered to strange places.

The more Kathie thought about it, the more it made sense. "That must be it. I bet you offended some enemies, and they pushed you off a cliff. That explains your injuries."

Jonathan was speechless.

Kathie grew worried. "You're not a dangerous person, are you?" Jonathan was curious. "If I were, would you kick me out?"

Kathie was still thinking when Eileen hugged his arm. "Mommy,you can't kick Seven out. He can't walk yet."
Kyle said. "I don't think Seven is a bad person. He's always helping us and teaching us to protect ourselves."
Zachary agreed. "We're good judges of character. Seven must be a good person. He was framed. Mommy, don't kick him out."
Seeing how much the kids defended him, Kathie realized they'd be heartbroken if they had to part ways. "Alright, eat your breakfast. I never said I'd kick him out. I'm just curious. Ordinary people don't know so much."
Jonathan suggested, "Maybe I'm from a wealthy family and learned a lot of skills growing up."
Kathie waved her hand. "No more guessing. Just try to recover your memory."

Jonathan saw her deep in thought and asked softly, "Do you want me to remember quickly so I can leave?"

Kathie smiled without answering. Whether he stayed or left wasn't up to her.

After breakfast, the kids helped their mom prepare herbs for Jonathan's medicinal bath.

The water in the tub turned dark brown. Kathie carefully helped him undress and get into the tub.

'"Dr.Cavendish, will this medicine stain my skin?" Jonathan asked.

Kathie placed a towel on his back. "Yes, you'll come out looking like 
charcoal."
"I think the water's a bit hot." Jonathan continued to make small talk.

"You're a grown man, and you can't handle a little discomfort? Isn't that shameful?" Kathie said with disdain.
"You don't believe me? Try it yourself." Jonathan retorted, feeling wronged.

Kathie pinched his ear and scolded, "Keep talking, and I'll twist your ear off."
Jonathan pulled away. "See, this is why doctor-patient relationships are strained.Can't you be a bit gentler?"

Kathie ground her teeth, and he immediately behaved.

Kathie was a fierce woman; he knew better than to push his luck.

Kathie went to the kitchen to continue preparing the medicine, while Jonathan grew bored in the bathroom.

"Dr. Cavendish, my body feels itchy,"he said.


"That's normal."

"Dr. Cavendish, the water seems to be cooling down."

Kathie came in with a bucket to add more water. Seeing the steam,
Jonathan nervously reminded her, "Slow down, don't spill it."

Kathie glared at him. "If you keep quiet, my hand won't shake. Otherwise,
I'll pour this boiling water on your head, and you'll go bald."

Jonathan thought to himself, 'Kathie is such a ruthless woman.'

 
"I trust you wouldn't harm your patient." Kathie smirked. "Don't be so sure. For disobedient and talkative patients,I like to use a little force."
Kathie filled a cup with the hot water. Jonathan broke out in a sweat,thinking she was going to scald him, but she gently poured it along the edge,not burning him at all.
###Chapter 43 The Cripple Now Covered in Pi nples
Kathie slowly poured water for Jonathan, testing the temperature with her hand to make sure it was just right before stopping.
Jonathan studied her delicate face. In the mist, she had an ethereal beauty-gentle as a summer breeze when calm, but fierce as a lioness when angry.

"Why are you staring at me?" Kathie asked.

"Because you're beautiful, of course."

Kathie leaned in closer. "I know I'm beautiful, but don't get any funny ideas."

Jonathan chuckled.
Two hours later, a scream echoed from the room, "Ah! My face is ruined!"

Jonathan had taken a medicinal bath and now felt itchy all over. Kathie had assured him it was normal, but now he was covered in red rashes,even on his face.

The three kids couldn't help but laugh.

Eileen tried to comfort him, "Seven, don't worry. You still look good. I won't mind."

Kyle chimed in, "Yeah, Seven, it'll be fine in a few days. No big deal."

Zachary laughed, "Even though your face looks like it's covered in pimples,your eyes are still bright."

Jonathan was on the verge of tears. What kind of comfort was this?
Kathie brought him a bowl of medicine, unable to hold back her laughter at his pitiful expression.
Jonathan glared at her. "You're laughing at me too. Did you do this on purpose?"
"Of course not. Your body has a lot of toxins. The medicinal bath is expelling them, but some got trapped in your pores, causing the rash.Just take the medicine, and you'll be fine in a week," Kathie replied.
Jonathan did feel a lot better, as long as he didn't look in the mirror.


"Then hurry up and cure me," he said.

Kathie nodded with a smile. "Don't worry. I don't want to look at your rash-covered face every day either."
"See. you're making fun of me again. Do you even have any medical ethics?"Jonathan was exasperated.

Kathie replied honestly, "I do, but not much."

The three kids burst into laughter, filling the room with a warm,harmonious atmosphere.
A curious voice came from outside the door. "What's making you all laugh so much?"

Kyle excitedly waved. "Aunt Melinda's here!"

"Aunt Melinda, come in!" Zachary and Eileen called out together.

Jonathan was about to go to his room to puit on a mask when he heard Melinda say, "The cripple is now covered in pimples. How ugly."

Jonathan was speechless. It seemed Keith was right to deal with Melinda. With the way she talked,Keith needed to handle her even more strictly.
But on the bright side, he didn't need to wear a mask. Melinda definitely wouldn't recognize him.
Kathie quickly gave her a look. "Don't hurt his self-esteem. It's from the medicinal bath. He'll be fine in a few days. Aren't you supposed to be at work? Why are you here suddenly?"
Melinda put down two large bags anid hugged Eileen, letting out a long sigh. "The kids start school tomorrow. I promised to take them,but Keith.that evil guy, wants me to go on a business trip with him early in the morning. I don't know what's gotten into him. He never needed me before.but now I have to follow him everywhere."
Melinda had agreedI to be his assistant, thinking he'd vent for á day and be done. Who knew he'd keep it up indefinitely?
Kathie laughed. "Maybe he likes you and wants to keep you close."

Melinda shook her head. "Are you crazy? There's no way he likes me! He's just torturing me because I hit him that day."
Kathie felt guilty. "You hit him to help me. Maybe I should explain to him and ask him to stop targeting you."
"Forget it. He hasn't done anything too bad, just keeps me around to boss me. I'll take it as a learning experience," Melinda said, not wanting her best friend to waste time on her.

"You're really going through a lot."

"It's fine. I brought the kids' uniforms and arranged a driver for you. He'll pick you up tomorrow." Kathie was touched. Even now, Melinda was thinking about them.


"That's too much trouble. I can drive them myself."

Melinda shook her head. "No way. You sprained your ankle. It's not safe for you to drive. Think about the kids. This driver is free, so use him."
Kathie was curious. "Who did you call?"

Melinda teased, "You'll find out tomorrow morning. Kids, get a good night s sleep. When I get back from the trip. I'll bring you gifts."The three kids hugged her. "Aunt Melinda, you're the best. We'll wait for you."
Melinda kissed each of them on the cheek, gave some instructions, and left.

Kathie looked at the uniforms in the living room. After worrying for so long,the kids were finally going to school.
That night, Kathie bathed the kids and sent themn to the children's room to rest early for the big day.
After taking care of the kids, she had to attend to Jonathan.

Kathie handed him his evening medlicine. "You don't need to bathe again after the medicinal bath. Drink this, and I'll give you acupuncture."
Jonathan said, "I feel a bit sticky. Can you wipe me down?"

"You sure have a lot of demands," Kathie said, but she was already heading to the bathroom to get water.

Jonathan held his breath and drank the bitter medicine, feeling the taste linger in his mouth.

"Is there no sugar today?" he asked. "Too much sugar isn't good for you."
The medicine was so bitter that Jonathan's face twisted. "At least give me a piece of candy or something to get rid of the taste."

Kathie ignored him.

Jonathan was speechless. This woman was so stingy.

Soon. Kathie came out with a basin of water and handed him a hot towel."

You can move your hands. Wipe yourself."

"I can only reach the front. You'll have to do my back."

Kathie frowned, took off his shirt and pants, and signaled him to hurry up.

Jonathan slowly wiped his neck, then moved sluggishly to his chest. At this rate. he'd be wiping until morning.
Kathie couldn't stand it and grabbed the towel to finish quickly. "Forget it,I'll do it."
Jonathan was pleased, spreading his arms on the armrests, ready to enjoy.

Kathie wiped his chest, noting his firm muscles. He had broad shoulders,a narrow waist, and stood over 5'10".
This showed how hard it had been for her to take care of him. Every time she helped him, she used all her strength.

"You better remember to repay me well," she suddenly said.

"I'll give you a blank check. Fill in any amount you want."


"You said it. No backing out."

Jonathan nodded firmly. He appreciated all she had done. Kathie looked at his face and turned away tohide her laughter. He really did look ridiculous.
Jonathan saw her shoulders shaking and angrily turned her around,accidentally pulling her into his lap.
Kathie lost her balance and fell onto his chest, her face hitting his firm muscles. Her heart felt like it was about to jump out.
They were so close, they could hear each other's breathing.

Jonathan's breathing grew heavier, desire surging within him. He had wanted Kathie more than once.

Kathie's soft. alluring body was irresistible.

Kathie quickly stood up, throwing the towel back at him. "Pervert, wipe yourself."
###Chapter 44 This Woman Has LustfulInt enti ons
Kathie bolted out of the room, desperate to hide her flushed face from Jonathan. She rushed to the bathroom, splashing cold water on her face to regain her composure.
If Jonathan had a wife and kids. Kathie would never allow herself to ruin another family.
Until he regained his memory, she had to keep her feelings in check.

Kathie lightly slapped her cheeks. It had been too long since she had been with a man, and now she couldn't control herself around a handsome one.
Jonathan couldn't get the image of Kathie's flushed face out of his mind.

He had seen the desire in her expression. Kathie was attracted to him.


Jonathan was confident in his physique.

That night, both of them tossed and turned, unable to sleep due to their restless desires.

The next morning, a luxury car was parked outside the small courtyard.

Hearing the dog bark, Kathie thought Randy was back for another round of insults. But when she saw who it was, she quickly called the dog back.

"Bradley, what are you doing here?" she puzzled.

Bradley Brooks greeted her with a smile, "Hey Kathie, long time no see.Melinda had something come up and asked me to take the kids to school."

So Melinda's "free driver" was her own brother. She really knew how to delegate. "Give me a sec, I'll bring them out,"Kathie replied.


"No rush. we got plenty of time."

The three kids inside heard his voice and excitedly ran out to greet him.


"Hi, Uncle Bradley! Long time no see!"

"Hi, Uncle Bradley, I'm Zachary."

"Eileen's here too!"

Bradley looked at their adorable faces, feelig his heart melt.

"Hey there, my little darlings. Today, I'm taking you out for a big meal."


"Yay!"
Kathie ruffled their hair and told them to go back and get their backpacks so they wouldn't be late.
Eileen, with her backpack ready, looked at Jonathan reluctantly before running over to hug him. "Seven, we're going to school. We'll be back in the afternoon. Don't forget to miss us."
Kyle also hugged him. "Seven, be good and listen to Mommy while we're gone. We'll be back soon."
Zachary secretly handed him two candies, whispering in his ear. "Mommy doesn't let us have candy. I saved these for you, Enjoy them."

Jonathan was speechless.

He was genuinely touched, but for a moment, he couldn't tell who was the adult and who was the child.

Usually, he found the three kids noisy at home, but now that they were leaving for school, he felt an emptiness inside. "Take care of yourselves at school. If anyone bullies you, remember to fight back and tell us. By the way, protect Eileen." He still wasn't reassured. "Especially you, Eileen. Don't trust strangers easily,and don't go with someone just because they're good-looking."
Kathie watched him, amused. He looked like a worried father, afraid his daughter would run off with someone.

"Now you know how I feel," Kathie said.

Jonathan sighed, wishing he had given Eileen more advice earlier.

Eileen nodded obediently. "Seven, don't worry. I only like you. I won't be interested in anyone else."
Jonathan frowned, pointing outside at Bradley. He had seen Eileen smiling at him earlier. "What about him?"
Eileen answered innocently,"Uncle Bradley is Aunt Melinda's brother. He's very nice to us and takes care of Mommy. I like him too."
Jonathan held her shoulders seriously. "That's not okay. You can't like everyone."

Jonathan didn't know why, but seeing the kids get along with others made him uncomfortable.

Kathie said, "Bradley has taken care of us for years. It's natural for the kids to like him. Don't be so petty. Stay home and read more, and stop overthinking."

Petty?

Jonathan was speechless.

Eileen held his hand and promised, "Seven, no matter how many people there are, I like you the most. That won't change." Jonathan felt a bit comforted and reluctantly saw them off.

Bradley carefully took the kids' backpacks, helped them into the car,and even brought gifts for them and Kathie.
Watching their warm interaction. Jonathan felt a pang of jealousy.

Bradley turned back and smiled politely at him, but Jonathan sensed competition. His gut told him Bradley liked Kathie.
Why else would he be dressed in a suit so early in the morning unless he was meeting someone important? And his eyes were always on Kathie.She really had a way with men, always surrounded by handsome guys.
Bradley didn't feel threatened. This man with a rash-covered face and a limp was no match for him.

"Let's go!" Bradley called out.

At the school gate, there were already several luxury cars parked. Families who could send their kids to Elite Tots Academy were all wealthy and influential.
Kathie adjusted the kids' outfits, her eyes full of pride. "Kids, from now on,you're preschool students. Learn well, have fun, and make lots of friends."

"Mommy,we know."

Kathie didn't want to part with them either, but she knew it was necessary.

She and Bradley walked the kids inside. Once they were out of sight, she turned around and ran into Randy and Shirley with Bob.

Randy had found a way to get his son into the school after all.

Randy smirked, "Kathie, even without your heIp,I managed." Kathie didn't want to waste time with Randy,so she turned to leave.Randy taunted, "Bradley, you're fromn a prestigious family. How could you be interested in a woman I discarded?"
Bradley was about to step forward, but Kathie stopped him. "Randy, who was the one begging me to take him back? Now you're here with your mistress and illegitimate son. Should I help spread the word?"

Randy and Shirley's faces turned ugly.

They had begged the Berkeley family to pull strings for Bob's admission.If there was a scene now, his enrollment would be canceled.
Shirley forced a smile. "Kathie, we're still sisters. Don't be so harsh."

"Don't call us sisters. Your parents are divorced. We have no relation,"Kathie retorted.
Shirley gritted her teeth. It was because of Kathie that her parents divorced.Kathie would get what was coming to her.
Bradley glared at Randy. "You're a disgrace to men. Stop shouting and show some humility."
Randy was furious but couldn't retort. He could only watch them leave.

He clenched his fists. One day, he would make Kathie regret it.

Bradley asked, "Now that your kids are in school, why don't you divorce Randy? He's just trouble."

Kathie shrugged. "I'm stubborn. The more they want something, the less I'Il give it to them. Shirley cares about her reputation. I'll make sure she's known as Randy's mistress."

Kathie wouldn't let those who hurt her get away easily. She'd fight to the end. Seeing Bradley silent, she asked with a bitter smile, "Do you think I'm too harsh?"
###Chapter 45 Friends Found Him
Bradley gave a small smile. "I'm just worried about you. You need to get that divorce from Randy sorted out ASAP so it doesn't cause you more trouble."
Deep down, Bradley kept his true feelings about wanting Kathie to get a divorce hidden. He didn't think it was the right time to confess his feelings;he was afraid of losing even the friendship they had now. So, he continued to keep his admiration for her a secret, staying by her side and waiting for the right moment to reveal his heart.
Kathie, completely unaware of Bradley's feelings, was grateful. "Thanks,Bradley. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing."
Bradley got to the point. "Now that you're back and the kids are in school,you have more time. Would you consider working at Staright General Hospital?"
Bradley was the director of Starlight General Hospital. They had gone to the same medical school, and he was also Melinda's brother, so he and Kathie had always had a good relationship. Bradley had wanted to invite her to work at his hospital for a long time, but she had always declined due to her marriage and the kids.
At this moment, Bradley extended the invitation again, but Kathie's mind immediately went to Jonathan, the injured man at home who couldIn't take care of himself. Without him, she might have considered accepting.
"Bradley, you know I have a patient at home to take care of. I don't have the tíme right now," Kathie said.

"You could bring him to the hospital. That way, more doctors could help treat him and ease your burden,"

Kathie shook her head. She suspected Jonathan had been targeted and
didn't want to expose him to the public.

"I want to take care of him myself, but thank you for the offer."

"Alright. I won't push you. When he's better, you can reconsider.Since you're here, why not visit Starlight General Hospital? That way, if you decide to accept my invitation later, you'll already be familiar with the place."
"Sure. I'd love to check it out. You know, I also want to open my own hospital someday and pass on the medical skills our professor taught us."

Bradley nodded approvingly. "I support you."

At the outskirts of Eldoria, a van pulled over by the roadside. A man and a woman got out. The man was handsome, and the woman was strikingly beautiful.
"Is Jonathan really still alive?" Patricia Stewart had been asking her brother this question the entire trip.
Henry Stewart analyzed, "When Jonathan had his accident, his grandfather was in the hospital in bad shape. But recently, he's been full of energy and even personally arranged for Randy's son to go to school. Whatdoes that tell you?"

Patricia suddenly understood. "Jonathan must be alive"

"Exactly. And his grandfather is keeping it a secret. I asked Ben several times, but he wouldn't say anything. I had someone follow him, and he's been coming to the outskirts a lot lately."

"Ben only listens to Jonathan, so he must be nearby. Maybe Jonathan is injured and can't go back," Patricia said excitedly.

Henry comforted her. "That's what I think too. That's why I brought you here to find him. He'll be happy to see you." Patricia's eyes filled with tears. Since Jonathan disappeared, she had been crying every day and had canceled all her engagements to search for him.
"Henry, if Jonathan is alive, I'll take him back and protect him," she said.

"Alright, let's ask around. If he's nearby, someone must know."

Patricia quickened her pace, asking every passerby she saw, but several villagers said they hadn't seen him, leaving her disappointed.
Henry encouraged her. "Don't lose hope. Jonathan is probably injured and hasn't been out, so people don't recognize him. Let's ask the kids."
Patriciatook a deep breath and approached some children, showing them a photo. "Hey kids, have any of you seen this man?"
One of the boys, who had been scolded by Jonathan before, immediately started cursing, "Yeah, that's the bad man who brought some illegitimate kids with him."
Patricia puzzled. "A bad man? Illegitimate kids? Are you sure you've seen him?"

The boy nodded. "He threw rocks at us and yelled at us."

A girl added, "He was with the Cavendish family. My mommy says they're trash."

Patricia was confused but decided to find Jonathan first to figure out what was going on. "Can you tell me where they live?"
The kids eyed them, and Henry pulled out some chocolate from his pocket."Please tell us where he is."

.The kids took the chocolate and pointed ahead. "Go up this hill and turn the corner. There's a small house with some mean dogs. That's their place." Patricia was thrilled and ran ahead, leaving Henry behind.

"Patricia, slow down. The road is rough. Be careful,"Henry called out.

Patricia couldn't wait. She had been longing for news of her beloved and was desperate to find him.
The siblings reached the small house, and the dogs started barking furiously,scaring them.
Jonathan, who was resting inside, opened his eyes. Someone was trying to break in.
He wheeled himself to the living room and heard familiar voices.

"Jonathan, are youin there?" Patricia asked hurriedly.


"Jonathan, can you hear us? It's Henary."

Jonathan was surprised to see Henry and Patricia.

Henry came from a renowned medical family in Eldoria and was well-known both domestically and internationally. He was one of Jonathan's friends.

Jonathan spoke up, "How did you find me?"

Patricia, with tears in her eyes, said, "Jonathan, it's really you. We finally found you. I missed you so much!"
Henry pointed at the dogs. "Can you put the dogs away andI let us in?"

Jonathan hesitated,thinking this was Kathie's house and it wouldn't be right to let others in without her permission. But he needed to know how they found him and if anyone else knew. So, he called the dogs back and let them in. Patricia ran up and hugged him, momentarily stunned by the rash on his face but still excited.
Jonathan pulled her away and asked. "How did you find me? Who told you?"
Henry proudly explained, "I figured out you weren't dead, but Ben wouldn't give me any information. I had to follow him and ask around with your photo until we found you."
So that's how it was. If they could figure it out, others wouldn't be far behind. This place was about to be exposed.
"Jonathan,why are you in a wheelchair? Did you hurt your leg? Come back with us and let Henry check you out," Patricia asked with concern.
"Patricia's right. You don't look well. Come with us, and I'll give,you a full check-up. Ill make sure you're healed," Henry said.
Jonathan refused. "I'm fine. The doctor who saved me is very skilled. She can heal me."
"But you have a rash all over. It's clearly an allergic reaction. This place is too basic for proper treatment. Cometo the hospital with us. We can keep it a secret if you don't want others to know." Henry didn't trust any doctor but himself.

Patricia,remembering what the kids had said, felt jealous and didn't want Jonathan to stay with Kathie any longer. She had loved Jonathan for so long without any progress, and now she heard he might be involved with another woman. She couldn't stand it. But she didn't show her true feelings in front of Jonathan.

She tried to stay calm. "Jonathan, do you know what the kids said about you? They called you and that doctor trash. Is there something going on between you two?" Her words, though she thought were calm, angered Jonathan.

Jonathan's handsome face filled with anger. "Even if you heard that,you shouldn't sayit. Dr. Cavendish is a good person. Those people are just talking nonsense."
Jonathan, trusting his friend Henry, didn't pursue Patricia's mistake further but was angry at the villagers.
It seemed his previous warning wasn't enough. He needed to find a way to shut them up.
Patricia didn't expect Jonathan to defend Kathie. Her jealousy overwhelmed her, and she couldn't hide her true feelings. She angrily said,"Jonathan, are you defending that woman? I heard she has several kids.What does a country woman know about medicine? She's probably trying to trap you because she knows who you are."
"Shut up! I won't let anyone insult her! She's my savior. You don't know anything and are just guessing. Without her, I'd be dead! If I hear you insult her again, I won't care that you're Henry's sister!" Jonathan interrupted Patricia, not allowing anyone to insult Kathie.
Patricia was shocked, forgetting her sadness. She and Henry exchanged looks of disbelief. This was the first time they had seen Jonathan defend someone so fiercely, especially a woman.
###Chapter 46 Identity Exposed
All of Jonathan's friends knew he wasn't into women, and they had never seen him protect someone like this, especially a woman!
Now.Patricia had barely mentioned Kathie, and Jonathan's reaction was so intense that it was hard not to suspect there was something between him and Kathie.
Patricia was the first to recover from the shock. She suppressed her overwhelming jealousy and anger, carefully choosing her words. "Jonathan,I'm just worried you might be getting played. After all, you're not just anybody."
Henry agreed. stepping in to defend his sister. "Jonathan, don't be like this.Patricia's just looking out for you. She's turned down all her engagements recently to find you. She's even worn her feet raw from walking, justto locate you."
Hearing this, Jonathan couldn'tstay angry. He sighed and said, "I know you care about me. I have everything under control. You should go back.I'Il contact you if anything comes up."
Patricia immediately shook her head. "I'm not leaving. I finally found you.I want to stay with you."
"Don't be ridiculous. If you stay, my identity will be exposed. Henry, take her away." Jonathan's leg injury hadn't healed yet, and more importantly,he didn't want to leave.

Henry, who had grown up with Jonathan, understood what he meant. "Patricia, since he has a plan, we should respect his decision.Come home with me."

"No, Henry, I can't leave Jonathan here!" Patricia's intuition told her that Jonathan's reaction and his protection of Kathie had deeply hurt her. Her unease exploded, and she couldn't allow Jonathan to stay here with Kathie.

Meanwhile. Bradley was driving Kathie back. As they passed an intersection, Kathie noticed a luxury van parked by the roadside.





"Kathie, think it over. Starlight General Hospital would always welcome you to join us," Bradley said, still hoping she would work there.

"Tll consider it. Thanks for today."

"Then treat me to a cup of coffee."

"No problem. I'll grind it myself."

They chatted and laughed as they reached the gate. Káthie nóticed the three dogs were back in their cages, which puzzled her even more. She distinctly remembered letting them out before she left. Could Seven have put them back?
She had let the dogs out to protect him, so he wouldn't have put them back unless something happened.
As Kathie pondered, she walked to the house and immediately heard a soft female voice inside saying, "I really missed you. I want to be with you and never be apart."

Jonathan's face was extremely displeased. Because he had grown up with Henry and his sister, they were like family. He treated Henry's sister like his own, and she had once saved his life. Otherwise, with his aversion to women,she wouldn't have been able to get close to him.

Patricia had always clung to Jonathan since childhood. Jonathan thought she saw him as an older brother like Henry, and although he didn't like it, he couldn't outright reject her. He would just be stern with her,making her too scared to approach. Usually, when he was stern, Patricia wouldn't cling to him. But today, no matter what he said, it didn't work. He was anxious because Kathie had been out for a while and would be back soon.He didn't want Kathie to see him being clung to by Patricia. He looked to Henry for help.
"Why are you just standing there? Get her off me..."

Before Jonathan could finish, the door opened, and Kathie stood at the entrance,seeing a beautiful woman hugging Jonathan.
Kathie recognized the woman as the popular singer Patricia, likely the owner of the luxury van.
Jonathan,seeing Kathie, immediately pushed Patricia away, keeping his distance. He felt a pang of guilt but tried to act nonchalant,smiling at Kathie. "Dr. Cavendish, you're back early."
Kathie forced a smile. She had hurried back, worried he might be bored at home.only to see this scene. Feeling uncomfortable, she spoke with a hint of anger. "Too bad I came back at the wrong time. Sorry to interrupt your reunion."

"Kathie, it's not like that. My friends just found me," Jonathan said, not wanting her to be upset.

Patricia wiped her tears and turned around, surprised to see that the rural woman she imagined Kathie to be was actually very beautiful, rivaling top celebrities.

With such a beautiful female doctor by Jonathan's side, Patricia felt even more uneasy. Her jealousy grew exponentially, but with Jonathan present,she had to maintain her composure. She pretended to be grateful, walking over to Kathie and holding her hand. "You must be the doctor who saved Jonathan. Thank you so much."

Kathie couldn't tell if she was more shocked or angry.


Jonathan?
He was the Jonathan Patricia publicly claimed as her boyfriend,the head of the Berkeley family.

He had deceived her thoroughly.
"Seven, or should I say Mr. Berkeley, is the amnesia game over?" Kathie said coldly.
Jonathan frowned, feeling a tightness in his chest. If he claimed to have just regained his memory, she wouldn't believe him. He didn't want to lie to her anymore.

"TIl explain everything later," he said.

Patricia, not understanding their conversation, saw Kathie's anger and assumed Jonathan couldn't stay here with Kathie anymore. She excitedly chimed in, "Since everything is out in the open, Jonathan, you don't need to stay here. Come back with us. As for Dr. Cavendish, I'll double the expenses Jonathan incurred."
Kathie still hadn't fully sorted out her emotions. Despite her anger, she knew that when it came to money, she wouldn't hold back.

"Three million dollars, and you can take him," Kathie said.

The Stewart siblings were shocked. "Three million dollars?"

Though the Stewart family was wealthy, they weren't used to being .extorted like this.

They had heard negative things about Kathie on the way, even from children, suggesting she wasn't well-regarded.

Now.asking for such a large sum confirmed their suspicions that she had ulterior motives in saving Jonathan.
Henry angrily retorted. "You're too greedy. We're grateful you saved Jonathan and can pay double the market rate, but this amount is excessive."
Kathie didn't care if they misunderstood. She wasn't in the mood to be polite to people who were hostile from the start. She coldly replied, "What's excessive? Ask around. My consultatíon fee starts at half a million dollars.Three million is a friendly price. Besides, Mr. Berkeley promised I could fill out a check for any amount." Then she turned to Jonathan. "Are you backing out because you have more people?"
Before Jonathan could speak, Patricia, filled with disdain for Kathie,angrily interrupted, "That must have been when Jonathan waśn't in his right mind. You're a doctor, not a robber!"
Kathie didn't wvant the money but was annoyed by their arrogance,especially Patricia's unwarranted hostility and proprietorial attitude. "Don't forget, I saved his life. Otherwise, you'dI be finding his corpse. Now, do you think he's worth that price?"
Henry was speechless. This woman was sharp-tongued, and his impression of her worsened.
Jonathan, with a stern face, said, "Stop talking. Henry, take Patricia and leave."

Patricía, already upset by Jonathan's earlier reaction, was even more reluctant to leave now that she saw a beautiful female doctor by his side.

"Henry,you go back. I want to stay and take care of Jonathan," she said.

Jonathan sternly ordered, "Didn't you understand me? Leave and stop causing trouble."
Patricia, feeling wronged, said. "I won't cause trouble. I'll stay and take care of you. Dr. Cavendish has to look after her children and won't have time for you."
Jonathan was exasperated. "Taking care of a patient requires strength. You can't do anything."
Patricia persisted. "I can hire help. I won't feel at ease if I'm not by your side."
Kathie found it laughable. Did they think her home was a hotel? Had any of them considered her opinion? These arrogant rich people were insufferable! She coldly said, "Stop arguing. Mr. Berkeley is too distinguished for my humble home. You should go with them."
Kathie didn't want his arrogant friends disrupting her life. Whether it was because seeing Patricia, Jonathan's publicly known girlfriend, made her uncomfortable,only Kathie knew.
Jonathan frowned, not expecting Kathie to kick him out. This wasn't what he wanted. His face darkened. "Dr. Cavendish, are you afraid you can't treat me? You promised to make me walk again. Are you going back on your word?"

"Your friends want to take you," Kathie said angrily.

Jonathan replied, "But I didn't say I wanted to go. I'll stay until I'm healed.11

He looked at Henry, his gaze serious. "Leave and don't come back. You'll only cause trouble."

Patricia shook her head. Jonathan had lost all patience with her.He glared at her coldly. "I hate repeating myself. Henry, take her away." Though Henry was Jonathan's childhood friend, he feared his anger.


Henry pulled Patricia. "Patricia, let's go. Don't disturb him."

Patricia, filled with jealousy, asked one last time, "Jonathan, are you sure you don't want to come with us?"
###Chapter 47 Who Else Would Be So

Shanal ess?
Jonathan nodded firmly, leaving no room for negotiation. "I'm not going back. Don't tell anyone I'm here, and most importantly, don't come back."
Seeing Jonathan's resolve. Henry didn't press further. "Alright, take care of yourself. Let us know if you need anything."
Jonathan waved them off. urging them to leave quickly. Patricia sighed,suppressing her jealousy, and walked over to Kathie, trying to be gracious."Dr. Cavendish, pleasé take good care of him."
"As long as the money's right, I know what to do." Kathie decided to play along since they assumed she was in it for the money.
Henry looked at her with disdain and pulled out a credit card from his bag."Use this as you need."
Kathie didn't take it. "I only want Mr. Berkeley's money, not from outsiders."
"Ungrateful," Henry muttered, dragging a reluctant Patricia away.

Patricia kept looking back, hoping Jonathan would change his mind.

Bradley, who had been silent at the door, stepped forward. "So,you're the famous Jonathan."
Jonathan sized him up. "Mr. Brooks, I've seen you in medical journals.You're quite a notable figure in Eldoria."

"You flatter me. I'm not as famous as Mr. Berkeley. We'll chat more another time." Bradley nodded and walked over to Kathie. "You two talk.Call me if you need anything." "Thanks for today. I'll treat you to coffee another time," Kathie replied.

Given the current situation. Kathie couldn't calmly invite Bradley for coffee.She still had someone to deal with.
Understanding her mood,Bradley left.

The room fell silent, with only their breathing auidible.

After a long pauase, Kathie broke the silence. "Jonathan, you never lost your memory,did you?"
Jonathan felt uncomfortable with the formal address. "You don't have to call me that. I prefer when you call me Seven."
Ignoring him, Kathie continued, "You knew my identity when you saw Randy,yet you chose to keep it a secret."
Jonathan felt a lump in his throat. "It was a special situation. I couldn't say anything."
Kathie laughed coldly. "Of course, I understand. You were worried that if you revealed your noble identity, I'd ask for more money. It was a temporary measure."
Jonathan felt troubled. He knew Kathie's temper well by now, and appeasing her wouldn't be easy.

"It's not like that. I know you're not greedy," he said.

Kathie was fuming. "Patricía is your girlfriend. She mentioned in an interview that her beloved boyfriend was about to propose. That's you.right?"

.Kathie regretted asking as soon as the words left her mouth. Why did she care if Jonathan was marrying someone else? 
"That's not..."
"No need to explain. I'm not interested in your personal life. But I have the right to know why you ended up like this." Kathie cut him off.
Jonathan's mood was in turmoil, but he patiently explained, "Someone tried to kill me. They altered my route and tampered with my car, causing it to go off a cliff."
"No wonder you were so badly injured. If the culprit finds out I saved you,won't I be in danger?"
"If you're scared. just heal me quickly so I can leave. Otherwise, I'll have to stay here,as you promised."

Who else would be so shameless?

"You can stay, as long as the money's right," Kathie replied.

Jonathan nodded seriously. "Name your price."

Kathie teased, "I mentioned thirty million dollars earlier, and your friend got so worked up. If I ask for more, you might run away."
Jonathan smiled wryly. "Try me. See if you can scare me off."

Kathie held up three fingers. "This time, I want three hundred million dollars. Can Mr. Berkeley afford that?"

"Yes!"

Kathie was stunned into silence.

Seeing her reaction, Jonathan waved a hand in front of her face. "What's wrong? Don't believe me? I can write you a promissory note right now."

Kathie had been testing him, expecting him to call her greedy like the Stewart siblings. She hadn't expected him to agree without hesitation.


"You're really willing to give that?" Kathie pressed.

Jonathan smiled. "Yes. You want to secure a future for your three little ones,right?"
Kathie was surprised he understood her true intentions. Feeling a mix of emotions, she nodded nonchalantly. "Yes, in case something happens to me. they'll have the money to live well."
Jonathan's face softened. "That's why I'm willing to give it. I'm not joking."

Kathie shook her head sincerely. "I don't need that much. As I said before,thirty million dollars is enough. I'm giving you a friendly price for helping my three little ones."

Jonathan smiled."Thank you, Dr. Cavendish."

Kathie added, "You need to tell your friends not to come to my house uninvited."
Jonathan nodded. "I understand. But wasn't it a bit inappropriate to bring Bradley back here?"
Kathie didn't get his point. "He picked us up early and drove me back.Inviting him in for coffee is just common courtesy. I felt bad he left so quickly."
"It's not proper for a man and woman to be alone together. You should keep your distance." Jonathan didn't like seeing her close to other men.

Kathie was exasperated. "Aren't we alone together now? Why aren't you saying to keep our distance?"

Jonathan frowned. "Let's not talk about him. When are you divorcing Randy? You're dragging it out too long."Kathie laughed in anger. "Mr. Berkeley, you're meddling too much in my affairs. I don't pry into your personal life, so don't pry into mine."
With that. Kathie went to her room, leaving Jonathan troubled.

Meanwhile, back in the car, Henry and Patricia were in a foul mood.

Patricia grew increasingly jealous. "Henry, Kathie doesn't seem like a country woman. What's her real identity?"
Henry was lost in thought, her question snapping him out of it.

He found Kathie familiar, like he'd seen her somewhere before.


"Call Ben. He'll know," Henry replied.

Patricia nodded and dialed Ben.

Ben answered quickly, "Miss Stewart, what's up?"

Patricia got straight to the point. "Ben, I just saw Jonathan and Kathie."


Ben was shocked they'd discovered the secret.

Patricia continued. "Don't hide it from us. I want to know Kathie's real identity. If you don't tell us, we'll find out ourselves, which might not be good for Jonathan."
There was silenace on the other end. Henry added, "We're concerned about Jonathan. Tell us what you know, and we'll keep it confidential."
After some thought, Ben decided the Stewart siblings wouldn't harm Jonathan. He hesitated before speaking. "Kathie is a socialite from the Cavendish Group, Randy's legal wife, with three children."

°"Are her three kids Randy's?"

"No, their biological father is unknown."
###Chapter 48 All Things Explained
The Stewart siblings' faces fell when they heard the news. They never imagined Kathie was not only greedy but also had such a messy personal life.

"Does she have any other secrets?" Patricia asked.

Ben replied, "Nothing else has come up so far."

"Thanks for the heads-up. We'll keep this under wraps." Patricia hung up,but she couldn't shake her unease. She then turned to Henry. "Henry,we need to go back right now. I want to get Jonathan away from Kathie. He can't stay with her."
Henry shook his head. "You know how stubborn he is. Once he's made up his mind, he won't budge."
Patricia was on the edge of losing it. "You heard what Ben said. How can we let someone like Kathie stay around Jonathan?"
Henry was worried too, but he said helplessly, "Jonathan has his own mind. And haven't you noticed? He really cares about Kathie!He won't leave easily."
Patrícia had indeed noticed Jonathan's special attention to Kathie. Her heart was already filled with anger and jealousy. She clenched her fists and said fiercely, "I won't let anyone take him away!"
Henry,seeing her like this, was also worried but tried to comfort her, "You've been with him for years. How can Kathie compare to that? He's just grateful to her for saving his life. He'll come back."

Despite his words, Henry could sense Jonathan's change.

He had never seen Jonathan care so much about someone. Patricia was going to have trouble with her feelings in the future.


At 4 PM4. Kathie's kids got out of school.

Kathie stood at the front so that her kids would see her first.


Eileen saw her mom and waved excitedly. "Mommy!"

Zachary and Kyle followed behind her, calling out happily, "Mommy, we're here!"
Kathie opened her arms and hugged her three kids. "How was school today,my darlings? Did you have fun?"
Eileen nodded. "It was great! I made new friends."

Kathie pinched Zachary's cheek. "How about you, Zachary? How was it?"


Zachary's expression was calm. "It was okay."

Kathie looked at her three kids. Before she could say anything, Kyle spoke up. "I thought it was just so-so,but I'll manage."
Kathie laughed. "Good kids, Mommy will make something delicious for you tonight."
Eileen clapped her hands happily. "Yay! The school food is good, but it doesn't taste like Mommy's cooking."
"Such sweet talk. Get in the car." Kathie opened the car door and was about to help them in when someone grabbed Eileen's backpack from behind.

Kathie turned around curiously and saw it was Bob.

She asked, puzzled, "Why are you grabbing Eileen's backpack?"

Bob looked anxious. "I want to sit next to Eileen, but she won't let me."
Kyle pushed him away. "We don't like you. Stay away from Eileen."

Kathie was surprised they were in the same class. Bob seemed to really like Eileen.
Bob looked a bit hurt. "I want to be friends with Eileen. I won't bully her."

Zachary stepped in front of him. "I saw you trying to take Eileen's pencil case today. You're not a good kid."

Bob argued, "I just wanted to play with her."

Kyle was blunt. "No dne likes to play like that. Go away!"

Shirley, who had followed behind, saw this and sneered, "Your family is really good at bullying people, ganging up on my son."
Kathie turned and glared at her. "Are you blind? Didn't you seé your son chasing after Eileen and grabbing her? He even tried to take her things at school."
Seeing her son's behavior, Shirley had a moment of realization. She pulled him back and pinched his ear. "YouI're embarrassing me. Get back in the car."

Bob kept shouting that he wanted to be friends with Eileen, but Shirley covered his mouth and shoved him into the car.

As Shirley watched Kathie drive away, she couldn't believe her son liked Kathie's daughter so much. It was a real twist of fate.

In the car, Kathie asked her kids about Bob. "What else did he do?"

Eileen sighed. "He talks a lot and tries to take other people's things.No .one likes to play with him, and I don't want to either."
"If he tries to bully you, let your brothers handle it. But you shouldn't isolate or bully him either." Kathie didn't like Shirley's family, but she didn't want to target Bob.
Kyle nodded. "Don't worry,Mommy. We'll protect Eileen."


Kathie was relieved. "I'm glad to hear that."

Eileen asked, "How's Seven at home? Did he mention me?"

Zachary said excitedly. "I showed my classmates the trick Seven taught me today. They all said I was amazing. I want to tell Seven."
"Seven said he'd maké us slingshots today. I can't wait," Kyle added.


Kathie felt conflicted. "You all really like him."

The three kids answered in unison, "Of course!"

Seeing how much the kids liked Jonathan, Kathie wondered what impact his eventual departure would have on them.

But she knew she couldn't keep Jonathan.

In the suburban villa of Eldoria, Jonathan heard the car wheelsand came to the door.

The three kids saw him and cheered, even more excited than when they saw Kathie.

Eileen ran ahead and jumped into his arms. "Seven, did you miss me? I missed you so much at school."

Jonathan's heart melted. He liked these three adorable kids more and more.

He held Eileen in his arms, reluctant to let go. "Of course,I missed you.I''ve been waiting for you at home."

Zachary hugged his arm. "I missed you too. I showed my classmates the trick you taught me and they all praised me and gave me things."

He then pulled out an eraser and a pencil from his bag and handed them to him.
Jonathan gave him a thumbs up. "Great job, Zachary."

Kyle leaned against him and asked, "Seven, where's the slingshot you promised?"
Jonathan pulled out two slingshots from behind him. They were a bit rough but looked pretty good.
"Wow!" The three kids exclaimed in awe. "Seven, you're amazing!"

Kathie watched this warm scene and felt a bit dazed. If only he could stay forever.
But how could that be? He was Jonathan, and he had a famous singer girlfriend.
Kathie smiled. "Alright, you just got back. Go put your things away.We'll have dinner soon."
The three kids ran to their room, and Kathie walked over to Jonathan. "Mr.Berkeley. you haven't changed towards the kids."
Jonathan frowned. "I haven't changed towards you either. You don't have to call me that. Just call me Seven like before. It's more intimate."
Kathie sat next to him and asked, "When I hit Tom and got taken to the police station, he didn't press charges in the end. Was that you helping me?"

.There were many things Kathie couldn't understand before. Now that she knew Jonathan's identity, it all made sense. "Yes. I wouldn't let anyone harm you," Jonathan replied.

"And the kidis being able to go to school smoothly, that was you getting Keith to cancel the rules."

"Yes, I said I would help you."
"And those people who tried to grab me, you had someone teach them a lesson."
Jonathan nodded. "Yes, I did. I lied to you out of necessity. Can you forgive me for everything I've done?"
###Chapter 49 Bad People
Kathie thought she was just lucky, but it turned out Jonathan had been helping her behind the scenes.
Technically, he hadn't done anything wrong, just kept his identity a secret.


Kathie spoke up, "I get it. I can forgive you."

Jonathan frowned. "Then you wouldn't beso distant. I don't like your attitude right now."
Kathie shrugged. "I'm getting paid to treat you. I can't adjust my attitude based on your preferences. It depends on my mood."
Jonathan sighed. Kathie was quite stubborn; it seemed he would have to take it slow.
Around midnight, a cat's meow echoed outside the small courtyard.

Jonathan opened his eyes reluctantly. Ben, of all times, had to come now.

Jonathan got into his wheelchair, threw on a coat, and quietly went outside.


Under the big tree across the street, a light flickered.


"Mr. Berkeley," Ben said softly.

Jonathan yawned. "What brings you here in the middle of the night?Couldn't you just call?"
"Mr. Berkeley, I apologize. I found some important information and thought it best to report in person."

Knowing Ben's loyalty, Jonathan wasn't truly upset, just venting a bit.

 
"Alright, what did you find?" time we found him, the body was already decomposing. The person behind this is extremely ruthless,"Ben replied.
Jonathan had anticipated that anyone holding crucial information would be killed. They were just a step too late.
"What about the person who tampered with the car? Any leads?"

"We traced it to a mechanic at the car shop. I checked all his communications and relationships, and there's no connection to Mr. Gerald Berkeley's family."
This surprised Jonathan. The current leads pointed away from Gerald.Could someone else be trying to kill him?

"How's the company doing?" Jonathan asked.

"Besides our own people, the other shareholders are causing trouble. Even some major contracts were canceled recently. The situation is dire. You need to come back and take charge."

Jonathan frowned. "Isn't Gerald handling it?"

Ben explained, "He's trying, and Mr. Harold Berkeley is also stepping in,but no one is listening to them. It's complete chaos. Only you can bring order."
This was unexpected for Jonathan. Now should be the time for Gerald to win people over, so why wasn't it working?

Could someone be creating chaos to drag Gerald down too?

If that was the case, the person behind this was formidable.

"Mr. Berkeley, your father and the others can't hold on much longer.You need to come back and help." Ben's visit was to persuade him to return. Jonathan hesitated. He could go back immediately, but once he did, the distance between him and Kathie would grow.
"Give me a bit more time to figure things out," Jonathan said.

"Also, Mr. Stewart and his people have already found this place. It's only a matter of time before others do too."
Jonathan nodded. "I expected that. I know what I'm doing. You head back first."
Hearing this. Ben didn't press further. Alright, I'm at your service anytime."

Jonathan waved, and as Ben turned1, he shivered. Someone was standing behind the tree.

Kathie was staring at them intently.

Jonathan was startled too. "When did you get here?"

Ben looked at Jonathan, silently asking how to explain this to her.

Kathie smiled. "So that's why there's the occasional cat meow at night. It's your signal."

Kathie had found it odd before, thinking, 'Seven is so lazy, why would he go to the tree in the middle of the night, claiming to chase away wild cats?Turns out he was meeting his subordinate.'

"Dr. Cavendish, thank you for taking care of Mr. Jonathan Berkeley,"Ben said.

"No need to thank me. I'm not doing it for free."

Ben gave an awkward smile, "I'll head back now and not disturb you."

Kathie nodded. "Next time, come in openly. Don't sneak around." That wasn't the nicest way to put it.


"Got it." Ben left.
Kathie pushed the wheelchair back inside. "If I'm not mistaken,you have a phone on you."
She had checked Kyle's phone. Although the call records were deleted,she found a number Jonathan had called, but never again.
This meant he had his own communicationdevice.Otherwise,how could he stay in touch with others?
Jonathan said awkwardly, "I do. Don't be mad. I won't hide anything from you anymore."
"As long as it doesn't cause me trouble," she replied coldly.

Kathie took him back inside, slowly coming to terms with the recent events.She just hated being deceived, and it would take her a long time to get over it.

Jonathan lay down, unable to sleep for a long time.

With his company in such chaos, he needed to make plans quickly and couldn't waste time.

But he found it hard to leave Kathie.

Just as Jonathan was drifting off, he heard a noise outside.

At first, he thought it was the wind. If it were someone, the dogs in the yard would bark. But as the noise grew louder, he realized something was wrong.

Jonathan got back into his wheelchair and looked out the window. Several shadows were carrying firewood around the courtyard, and someone had a metal can.
His heart sank as he thought, 'Oh no! They're going to set the place on fire.'

Jonathan immediately called Ben to come back, then went to find Kathie.

Luckily, she had forgotten to lock her door tonight, sohe went straight in.


Kathie sensed someone approaching and opened her eyes to see Jonathan.



"You..."
Jonathan covered her mouth. "Keep it down. There are people outside."

Kathie pulled his hand away. "Are you sleepwalking? How could there be people? And don't you think the dogs in the yard would alert us?"
Jonathan gestured for her to see for herself. "Go check, and you'll know."

Kathie didn't believe him, but Jonathan's serious expression made her run to the window. Then she was shocked. "What's going on?"
They were in the suburbs. Even if they called the police now, it wouldn't help.

"Move the kids first, then come find me," Jonathan said.

Kathie nodded and ran to the children's room.

Jonathan went to the living room, found the slingshot he had made for the kids earlier, and quickly filled his pockets with marbles.

Outside, the men in black had already set up the firewood.

"Boss, the dogs are taken care of," one of the men said.

"Good. Get over the wall and pour more gasoline. Make sure the fire burns strong."  kids inside. They won't be able to escape."
The leader nodded smugly. "This job is a sure win. Once they're dead,we get the remaining two hundred thousand dollars."
The men in black, following his orders, started climbing over the wall. Just as they were about to pour gasoline, a marble flew out, hitting one of them in the eye.
"Ah!" With a scream, another marble hit his leg, making him kneel in paín.

The leader immediately became alert. "Listen up, folks. The heat's on us.We gotta move quick and make sure nobody's left standing."
###Chapter 50 The Kiss After the Catastrophe

When they took the job, they had already scoped everything out. The guy in the house was disabled, and there was just one woman and three toddlers. No real threat.
They were six strong men; no way they could fail.

Jonathan gripped his slingshot tightly, aimed at the guy trying to climb in.and nailed him right on the head, making it bleed.
"Boss, there's a hidden weapon here. Look, my head's bleeding," one of the men cried out in pain.
Kathie came over to Jonathan's side and watched him hit the intruder with precision. She couldn't help but be impressed. "Didn't know you had that in you."
"It's nothing, but they'll soon figure out it's a slingshot. Then they'll find a way to block it, and it won't be as effective. Once they get in, we're in trouble. Have you hidden the kids?"
Kathie was anxious. "Yeah. What do we do now?"

"Do we have any weapons in the house?" Jonathan couldn't fight them off himself; he needed something for defense.

"The knives are all in the kitchen."

Jonathan nodded. "Alright, head'to the kitchen. Be ready; we might have to fight."

Kathie pulled out some silver needles. "I canuse these if necessary."

·Jonathan had her push him to the kitchen while he continued to use the slingshot to fend off the intruders. Sure enough, the leader outside quickly realized it was just marbles and instructed his men. "Stay cool, it's just marbles. Grab something to cover your heads and push through the pain. Get in there."
Jonathan reached the kitchen. Besides a kitchen knife, he found a rolling pin, but nothing else that could be used effectively for defense.
Kathie looked worried. "They're coming in."
Jonathan gripped the kitchen knife. "Stay behind me. When the fight starts,run if you get the chance."
"I can't leave you, and the kids are upstairs. We all need to be safe."Kathie couldn't abandon him.
The men in black stormed into the house. To prevent them from going upstairs and finding the kids, Jonathan launched a surprise attack from the kitchen, drawing them in.
Kathie shouted angrily, "Who sent you? I've already called the police. If you know what's good for you, leave now."
The leader sneered, "By the time the cops get here, they'll becollecting your bodies. If you give up now, you might die a little more comfortably."
These men were out for blood. Kathie couldn't understand who hated her so much.

"Stop talking and just charge in there," the leader ordered.

Two strong men kicked open the kitchen door. Jonathan released his slingshot, hítting one in the forehead. The other grabbed a knifeand swung it at Kathie. Jonathan quickly pulled her aside, getting his arm cut in the process.

Kathie realized they were targeting her. Seeing more men approaching, Kathie shouted, "Wait! You guys are in the underworld, right? You must know Raymond. I saved his life. He said he'd protect me in Eldoria. If anyone harms me, he won't let it slide."
The leader cursed, "So, you're the one who saved him. We went through so much trouble to give him a stroke, hoping he'd kick the bucket soon.And now, thanks to you, he's back."
"Exactly. Our boss and Raymond are mortal enemies. You're his savior.which makes you our enemy."
Jonathan chuckled awkwardly. "What a coincidence."


Kathie fell silent,embarrassed.
She had hoped to use Raymond's name to scare them off, but it backfired,showing how well the mastermind knew her.
The leader and his men charged in. Jonathan blocked Kathie and said,"Get out of here! I'm Jonathan Berkeley. You may not fear Raymond, but you dare mess with me?"

Hearing Jonathan's name, the men hesitated.

The leader scrutinized the disabled man before him. "You're Jonathan Berkeley?"
"Yes. I'm just recovering here. If you know what's good for you,leave now,or I promise you'll regret it." Jonathan's cold gaze aimed to intimidate them.

The leader smirked. "Everyone knows Jonathan is dead. You're just pretending." Then he signaled, and his men charged with knives.

Kathie grabbed the wheelchair, pushing Jonathan to a corner and standing in front of him. "Come at me, don't hurt innocent people." Jonathan pushed her aside. "Are you crazy? You'll get killed."

"Seven, listen. If I die, take care of my three kids." Kathie, forgetting their earlier quarrel. began her last words.




The leader ordered. "That guy's in the way. Kill him first."

Two strong men obeyed, swinging their knives at Jonathan. In a critical moment, Kathie turned and shielded him with her body.
Jonathan's eyes widened in disbelief. He couldn't stop it in time. As the knife neared Kathie, a gunshot rang out.
One of the strong men fe1l. Another shot followed, and the second man dropped.
"Anyone moves, and I'll shoot!" Ben's roar froze everyone.

Jonathan held the trembling Kathie, his heart pounding. He hadn't expected her to shield him.

"It's okay. Don't be scared," he said softly.

Luckily, Ben had rushed back after getting a call, arriving just in time to save them.

Ben ran in, seeing Jonathan's bleeding arm. "Mr. Berkeley,you're hurt."

Jonathan sighed in relief. "You got here just in time. Tie them up." He then gently held Kathie's face,kissing her forehead.

Kathie's heart raced. "What are you doing?"

"Just comforting you after the ordeal. Don't worry. Go check onthe kids." Kathie glared at the intruders. "Make them reveal who sent them."


Jonathana nodded. "Leave it to me. Go now!"
Kathie.worried about the kids, went upstairs. She had hidden them in the attic, instructing them to stay silent.
Ben tied up the attackers and tended to Jonathan's wound.

Jonathan took Ben's gun and aimed it at the leader's head. "Now do you believe me? I'm Jonathan!"
The leader trembled! "Mr. Berkeley, we didn't know you were here.We were just doing a job."
Jonathan's cold eyes bore into them. "Who sent you?"

The leader hesitated. Revealing their employer would break the code,making it hard to survive in their world.
Jonathan saw his hesitation and threatened, "If you don't talk, I can end you right now!"
Everyone in Eldoria knew Jonathan was ruthless. Crossing him meant no good end,especially now that they had hurt him. Their only chance was to cooperate.
###Chapter 51 Have You Fallen for Me?

The man in charge was on his knees, pleading for mercy. "Mr. Berkeley. I'Il spill everything. It was Kathie's stepmom, Melissa. She paid us three million upfront and promised another two million once we took you out."

Jonathan couldn't wrap his head around Melissa going to such extremes to get rid of Kathie.


Anyone who dared to harm Kathie and her kids was as good as dead.

"Take them to the police. And as for Melissa, you know what to do,"Jonathan said coldly.

Ben nodded. "Got it. I'll handle it."

The man in charge didn't dare resist. At least their lives were spared for now,so they obedently followed Ben out.

Kathie had just put the kids to bed wwhen she found Jonathan tidying up the living room. Seeing her face, something inside him lit up.

"The kids okay?" Jonathan asked.

Kathie smiled and nodded. "Yeah, they were hiding in the closet and didn't hear a thing. They're asleep now. How's your injury?"
"It's fine. Ben patched me up. The three dogs outside were sedated and won't wake up until tomorrow. I think it'd be safer to have a couple of bodyguards around."

After what had just happened, Kathie didn't want to take any chances.

"Okay. Did you find out who was behind this?" she agreed.

"Yeah, we did. I sent Ben to handle it. Kathie,why did you shield me from that knife?" In that moment of crisis. if Ben hadn't arrived, she would have died.

There were plenty of people who wanted to harm him, and many who claimed they would protect him. But in a life-threatening situation, Kathie was the first to unhesitatingly put herself in harm's way to protect him.
It shook him deeply and changed his perspective.

Kathie hadn't expected him to ask that. In the heat of the moment, she had instinctively wanted to protect him, not wanting him to get hurt. As for why she risked her life for him, she couldn't quite explain it. She smiled and said, "You protected me earlier. I was just returning the favor."
Jonathan shook his head. "It's different. You have three kids. No matter what happens, you would make sure you survive. But you still risked your life for me. Do you like me?"
Kathie felt a pang of panic, as if he had seén through her deepest, mnost hidden feelings. But she knew he had a girlfriend and would never allow herself to be the other woman. She feigned calmness and denied it. "That's impossible. As a doctor, it's my duty to protect my patients."
"Is it that hard to admit you like me?" Jonathan didn't believe her answer.He wanted to hear the truth from her.
Kathie didn't want to argue about it anymore and seriously said, "I don't like to interfere ín other people's relationships. I won't fall for a man who already has a partner."
Hearing this, Jonathan was secretly pleased. Her words implied that she did like him.
Without thinking, he said, "It's okay if you like me."

Kathie's face darkened instantly. "Are you trying to be like Randy,being ambiguous with other women while having a partner, becoming an Irresponsible jerk?"

Jonathan smiled wryly. "Of course not. I'm loyal to the person I like..."

"Enough. Since you said that, don't tease me anymore. It's late. Go to bed."Kathie cut him off, not wanting to continue the frustrating conversation.

He had made it clear he was loyal, which meant he must love Patricia very much.


She despised people who interfered in others' relationships and would never become someone she hated.

At 3 a.m., in a high-end hotel.

Melissa hadn't slept all night, clutching her phone, waiting for news.

To get rid of Kathie and her family, Melissa had drainéd her šavings to hire hitmen to burn them alive. To ensure there were no tricks from Kathie,she had specifically chosen Raymond's arch-enemies, leaving Kathie no chance to escape.

But it had been three hours, and there was still no news.

Logically, in the dead of night, Kathie and her kids, being defenseless,should have been easy targets.
The more Melissa thought about it, the more anxious she became.She quickly packed her things and woke Shirley next to her. "Shirley, I have to go. Take care of yourself."
Shirley groggily woke up, seeing her mother frantically packing. She rubbed her eyes and sat up. "Mom, what are you doing? It's not even dawn.Where are you going?"
Melissa didn't hide it anymore. "Shirley, I had you come over because I was scared." Shirley tried to comfort her. "Mom, it's okay. Even if Dad doesn't want you.Randy and I will take care of you. You won't have to suffer."

Melissa hugged her and shook her head. "It's not that. I sent people to kill Kathie and her kids, but there's been no word from them. Something must have gone wrong."

Shirley pushed her away in shock. "What? You sent people to killthem?Mom.are you crazy?"

"I hate her for ruining everyhing and taking the position that should be yours as Randy's wife. If Kathie doesn't die, you won't have a good life.Shirley, I did it for you."

Shirley was distressed. She had guessed her mother would go after Kathie but hadn't expected her to resort to murder.
"You could have just had them beaten up or sent away. How could you go so far?" Shirley was still in shock.

"It's too late. If they failed, they'll trace it back to me. I have to leave now.
Shirley, take care of Bob.I'm leaving."

Melissa grabbed her bag and ran. But as soon as she opened the door,she found the police waiting with handcuffs. She immediately collapsed to the ground.

At dawn, in Kathie's suburban villa in Eldoria.

The alarm clock rang, and the three kids stretched and got up.

Kathie had laid out their school uniforms by their beds. "Babies, get dressed. Mommy's making breakfast."
Kyle reminded her, "Mommy, the school has nutritious breakfasts.You don't have to wake up so early. G et some more rest." Kathie smiled warmly. "I know, but someone needs to eat."

Eileen raised her hand. "I get it. Mommy's making breakfast for Seven."


Zachary praised, "Mommy is such a good wife and mother."

Kathie chuckled. "I'm just filling his stomach. Now hurry up and get ready.
1


"Okay!" the three kids answered sweetly.

Kathie walked into the living room to find Jonathan already up, reading a medical book. He used to have no interest in these,but now he always had one in hand.

"You're not studying medicine. Why are you so serious about it?" she asked.

"I want to learn more. It might come in handy someday."


Kathie shrugged and went to the kitchen, letting him be.

Eileen, dressed in her uniform, ran out and headed straight for Jonathan."Seven, do you like my new uniform?"

Jonathan gave her a thumbs-up. "Eileen, you look beautiful."

Eileen handed him a hair tie and comb. "Seven, can you do my hair?"

Seeing her cute face, Jonathan forgot all his worries.

He picked her up and gently combed her hair.

"Seven, can you do a bun for me?" Eileen asked again.

.Jonathan smiled awkwardly. "Eileen, I know my limits. This is too advanced for me. Better let your mommy do it so you don't get laughed at school." Eileen sweetly encouraged him. "Seven, if you practice, you'll get good at it.1 like it when you do my hair."

Kathie came out with breakfast and joined in. "It's good to encourage him,but don't let him braid your hair too much. Outside, we need to look presentable."


Zachary followed, agreeing with his mom. "Mommy's right. If you get a terrible hairstyle, everyone will laugh at you."
###Chapter 52 Do Not Make Promises Lightly
Eileen felt a bit down. She really appreciated everything Seven did for her."But I really don't mind."

Jonathan comforted her, "Eileen, be good. I'll brush your hair, and your mom will do the bun. Once I get better at it, I'll do it for you, okay?"

Eileen nodded happily. "Okay, Seven, you need to practice more. When I'm not home, you can practice on my mommy. That way, you'll learn quickly.".

Kathie was speechless.

She looked at Jonathan and quietly reminded him, "Don't make promises to the kids lightly. You might leave at any time,but Eileen will keep expecting you."

She didn't want Eileen to be waiting for him all the time.

Jonathan assured her, "If I promise them something.I'll make sure to do it."

Eileen hugged his neck joyfully. "Then, can you pick us up from school?"

Jonathan hesitated, and Kyle chimed in, "There's fun stuff near the school.You should come check it out."

"Yeah,that way we can see you right away," Zachary added.

Kathie felt the kids were getting too close to him, which wasn't a good thing.
"He has trouble moving around. It's better if he waits for you at home."·Kathie chimed in.
Seeing the kids' hopeful eyes, Jonathan agreed. "Alright. I'll come with your mom to pick you up from school in the evening."

Kathie gave him a look, signaling not to promise everything. If he couldn't follow through, the kids would be disappointed.

Jonathan understood her look. "I keep my promises."

And indeed, he had never broken his word.

Downtown, at the Berkeley Mansion.

Randy was leading his son downstairs. Randy's mother, Kaitlyn Foster,was having breakfast.

"Bob's up. Come over and let me see you," Kaitlyn said.

Bob ran over,grabbed the bread from Kaitlyn's plate, and took a sip of her milk,making her previously loving smile disappear.

Randy quickly pulled him aside and scolded, "What are you doing? Your school has breakfast. This is your grandma's."

Kaitlyn gave him a look. "Randy, no matter how busy you are with work,you need to discipline your child. You were so well-behaved when you were young. Look at him now."

Randy sighed. "Mom, Shirley usually takes care of him. I'll talk to her."

"Where is she? Still not up?" Kaitlyn didn't think highly of Shirley.She only let her stay because of Bob.
Randy explained, "Her momn's not feeling well. Shirley went to the hotel to be with her."

Kaitlyn's face turned cold. "The Cavendish family is not simple. You should divorce Kathie as soon as possible and not drag thisout."
"I know. I'll take Bob to school first." Randy felt disdain just thinking about Shirley's brash behavior.

Just then, the door opened, and Shirley rushed in. "Randy. something happened to mom."


Kaitlyn angrily scolded, "Early in the morning, are you cursing me? I'm perfectly fine."

Shirley quickly apologized, "Sorry, Kaitlyn. I meant my mother. She was arrested by the police. Only you can help her now."

Randy had the nanny take the child away and asked what happened.

"What exactly happened?" he asked.

Shirley had to explain everything, leaving Kaitlyn and Randy in shock.

"Melissa is crazy to do something like that," Kaitlyn said.

Shirley knelt and pleaded, "I know it's all her fault, but she's my mother.She helped you return to the Berkeley family back then. For Bob's sake,please help her."

Shirley had no one else to turn to and could only beg them. Although they were a branch of the Berkeley family, they still had influence in Eldoria.

Kaitlyn sighed. "Bob is going to enter the elite circles. Given Melissa's relationship with Bob, she really can't go to prison.."

"Mom, thank you for helping." Shirley said in gratitude.

"Get up quickly. I'll go find out and see if I can pull some strings.Kaitlyn was only helping for Bob's sake.
Shirley anxiously waited at home.Kaitlyn spent the whole morning trying.but no one dared to help. Even lawyers refused to defend her. She found out that a powerful figure had ordered no one to help, or they would be opposing the authorities.

The only person who could help Melissa now was Kathie. Unless the victim dropped the charges, Melissa would spend her life in prison.

Shirley didn't want to ask Kathie, but thinking of her mother suffering,she swallowed her pride and went to Kathie's villa in the Eldoria suburbs.

Kathie was drying herbs in the yard. Seeing the unwelcome Shirley,she turned and went inside.

"Kathie,wait," Shirley called out.


Kathie ignored her. Shirley hurried forward, startled by a faint dog bark.

"Kathie, don't go. I need to talk to you. I know you hate me,but at least hear me out," she quickly added.

Kathie turned back, looking at her coldly. "Shirley, I know why you're here.Do you see the pile of firewood outside the yard? Do you smell the gasoline? And do you see the dog lying in the cage, unable to stand? Can you imagine my despair last night?"

Just seeing these things made Kathie want to tear Melissa apart. No one could plead for her! Especially since Jonathan almost perished in the fire too. He would never let Melissa go. But Shirley didn't need to know that,or more trouble might arise.

She knew Shirley would try to save Melissa, so she asked Jonathan to ensure Melissa faced justice.

Shirley was horrified. "I apologize for what my mom did. I know she went too far. Please, for the sake of our past, give her a chance."
Kathie stepped forward, staring her down. "Shirley, do you know something?"

Shirley's fear grew. "What?"

Kathie gripped the iron bars, seething. "Your mom killed my mom and my newborn sister."


Shirley trembled. "Impossible. We came back after your mom died.Everyone knows she died in childbirth."

"Then ask your mom if that's true. I'm gathering evidence to send her to hell."

Kathie's fierce gaze terrified Shirley. She knew her mom had used some tricks back then.

If what Kathie said was true, her mom was accountable for two deaths.Kathie would never forgive her.

"Is there no room for negotiation?" Shirley ased.

Kathie retorted, "If I tried to burn you three alive, would you forgive me?"

Shirley staggered back. If it were her, she'd want to tear that person apart.

But the arsonist was her beloved mother.

"Kathie, I know my mom deserves to die. She knows she was wrong.Please give her a chance to change. I'll agree to any condition," Shirley pleaded.

Kathie sneered, "Cut the crap! Get out now, or I'll set the dogs on you!

Shirley watched her go inside, helpless. This ruthless Kathie wouldn't spare them.

###Chapter 53 Just Like a Young Couple

Kathie shut the door, not wanting to see Shirley outside.

Jonathan glanced over. "Want me to get rid of her?"

"No need, she'll leave on her own." Kathie had made her point clear enough. If Shirley had any sense, she'd get lost quickly.
Jonathan poured her a glass of water. "Here, drink some water. Don't let people like her get to you."
Kathie noticed he hadn't changed a bit, still thinking of himself as Seven.

"Thanks. We're out of spices at home, I'll go to town and get some," she said.
Jonathan nodded. "Drive safe."

Kathie gave a helpless smile. Their interactions were so much like a married couple.
As soon as Kathie left, the Stewart siblings' car arrived.

Jonathan saw they had brought two caregivers with them, feeling both frustrated and angry. He had made it clear yesterday, yet they still took advantage of Kathie's absence to try and take him away! Henry knew his decision wouldn't change, but they still defied him, risking exposure to his enemies, and came back to forcibly take him away.
"Why are you here again? Did you think I was joking yesterday?"Jonathan's voice was tinged with anger.
Patricia hurried forward to explain, "Jonathan, don't be mad. We're just ·worried about you. I brought professional caregivers. After all, Dr.Cavendish is a woman and has to take care of her children. She can't possibly have the energy to look after you too." Jonathan's face remained cold. Who needed their concern?

"Dr. Cavendish is taking good care of me," Jonathan replied.

Henry continued to persuade, "I still suggest you come back with us for a proper check-up. This place isn't suitable for recovery."

"I'm recovering well." Jonathan trusted Kathie's medical skills.


Henry pointed to the herbs in the yard. "Is she giving you those herbs?"

Jonathan nodded. "She's a healer."

Henry sighed. "Healers are outdated. If I were treating you, you'd probably be walking by now."

Jonathan couldn't tolerate anyone questioning Kathie's skills. He lifted his foot slightly. "I had both legs broken, a spinal injury, and multiple fractures. She fixed them all. Can you guarantee you'd have me in this condition in such a short time?"

Henry was silent,shocked.

If what Jonathan said was true, it only proved Kathie's medical skills were exceptional.
But Henry didn't believe it. No healer could be that good. Jonathan must be exaggerating to stay here.
"Let's not talk about that. Her character is questionable. I heard she has a husband but had children with another man. She doesn't even know who the father is. That says a lot about her character," Henry said.
Jonathan glared at him. "You shouldn't be saying things like that."

Jonathan was only slightly angry about their attempt to take him away,hearing HHenry slander Kathie made him question his character. A truly knowledgeable and insightful wealthy elite should not, like Henry, casually inquire and. after hearing a few distorted facts, slander Kathie in front of Jonathan. This proved Henry's character was questionable, and his intelligence was also in doubt.


"Jonathan, I'm afraid she's deceiving you. With your special status, if she clings to you, you might never get rid of her." Henry insisted.

He thought Kathie was too cunning, even managing to win over Jonathan,who usually kept his distance from women.

Jonathan's face grew darker. Patricía quickly pretended to be understanding. "Henry, don't say that. Dr. Cavendish saved Jonathan, so she's our benefactor. We should repay her."

Patricia signaled Henry to stop talking and not ruin the atmosphere.

Henry fell silent, and Patricia moved behind Jonathan to massage his back.

"Jonathan, I'm working on a new song and found inspiration here.I promise I won't disturb you," she said.

No matter what, Patricia didn't want Jonathan and Kathie to be alone.

Henry chimed in, "Patricia canceled all her work to find you. Now that she has inspiration, let her stay."

Jonathan's patience was wearing thin, his anger about to erupt.

Patricia picked up a photo frame, touching the three small faces in the photo.
"Jonathan, these kids are so cute. They even look a bit like you," Patricia said sweetly,but she was worried inside.
Jonathan's unique looks were unmatched in Eldoria.How did Kathie have three kids who resembled him? Hearing about the kids, Jonathan's eyes softened. "They're not only cute but also very well-behaved."


Seeing his tone soften, Patricia asked, "Jonathan, can I look around? This place seems interesting."

These people really didn't respect Kathie. What right did they have to tour her and her kids home?

Surprisingly, Jonathan, perhaps thinking of himself as the man of the house,agreed. Patricia arrogantly began to wander around.

Patricia looked around disdainfully, thinking, 'These rooms are small and old,worse than the servants' quarters at Jonathan's house. How could he stand this place?

Patricia despised the place but was willing to stay to keep Jonathan.

Henry kept trying to change Jonathan's mind, worried about his connection with Kathie.

"Jonathan, you haven't had a proper hospital check-up since your injury.To avoid hidden issues, I suggest a full body exam," Henry continued to persuade.

Jonathan was indifferent. "Dr. Cavendish has checked me. She knows my condition."

Henry frowned. What had Kathie given him to make him side with her?

"You need to trust science," Henry replied.

"Isn't my check-up scientific?" Kathie asked from the doorway.

.Kathie had just entered and heard Henry questioning her skills.These modern doctors always looked down on healers. Henty was dismissive. "Dr. Cavendish, it's the age of technology.Medical machines are more accurate."

Kathie smiled calmly. "Mr. Stewart, healer methods are the oldest in my country,treating patients for thousands of years, no less effective than machines."


"Do you have a medical license? Which hospital do you work at?" Henry arrogantly asked.

Kathie shrugged. "No, I'm just a wandering healer. Working at a hospital is too tiring. I'd rather travel and maybe find a few like Mr. Berkeley.Then I'd be set for life."

"You're being so stubborn!" Henry was furious.

Jonathan was amused. He liked her attitude.

Seeing Henry losing to Kathie, Patricia stepped in with a smile. "Dr.Cavendish, I brought two caregivers to look after Jonathan. I hope you agree."


Kathie looked at Jonathan, who blinked for her to refuse,but she nodded.

"Sure,having professionals take care of him makes my job easier." Then she turned to Jonathan."I'm thrilled."

Jonathan gritted his teeth. She was actually happy?

She clearly didn't like being disturbed.She was just being stubborn.

Patricia was delighted. "Jonathan, you heard that. Dr. Cavendish agreed,so I can stay."
.Jonathan was displeased. "Dr. Cavendish,are you serious?"

Did Jonathan not know if she was serious? They exchanged glances, subtle changes in their eyes.

Patricia was anxious, about to speak when Kathie's phone rang.

Kathie recognized the number. It was Randy's mother, Kaitlyn Foster,likely about the divorce.

Kathie stepped aside to answer.

Kaitlyn spoke first, "Kathie, you know who I am."

Kathie replied with a smile, "I know.So,what do you want?"

Kaitlyn commanded, "I need to talk to you. Come out now."
###Chapter 54 Why Don't You Go Rob a Bank
Kathie couldn't help but laugh at Kaitlyn's nerve. If Kaitlyn wanted to be rude,she shouldn't expect any courtesy in return.

"What makes you think you can boss me around? If you wanna see me,you can come find me yourself. Then I'll decide if I feel like seeing you,"Kathie retorted.

Kaitlyn was livid. "You're still my son's wife, and you dare talk to me like this? You have no manners!"

Kathie shot back, "The woman living with your son now is Shirley. To me,you're just a stranger."

Kaitlyn had hoped to use her status to intimidate Kathie, but she failed right from the start. Kathie wasn't having any of it, so Kaitlyn had to change her approach.
She softened her tone. "I won't take up much of your time. I'll be waiting for you at the café."
Kathie didn't want to stay in the house with Jonathan and the others anyway, so she agreed. "Fine, send me the location."
After hanging up. Kathie turned to Jonathan. "I have to go out for a bit."

Jonathan was a little upset. "You just got back, and now you're leaving again?"
Everyone in the room was surprised that Jonathan was concerned about such a small matter.
"I have personal business. You don't need to know," Kathie replied.

Was she going to see another man? Jonathan fel a surge of anger."When will you be back?" "You have company here. What are you worried about? I won't be back for dinner. Handle it yourself."

"Dr. Cavendish, don't forget, I paid for your care."

Kathie nodded. "I remember. I'll bring you sometakeout. Just stay home."

Patricia frowned, her nails digging into her palm. How could Kathie speak to Jonathan like that? And why wasn't Jonathan angry? What was their relationship?

Henry listened to their exchange, convinced they were bickering like a couple. Their relationship was clearly not ordinary.

After Kathie left, Patricia couldn't hold back any longer. "Jonathan, she just left you here and told you to stay home. She has no respect for you."

Henry agreed. "She's being unreasonable. We can't trust her."

But Jonathan smiled. They didn't understand. Kathie only spoke like this to people she cared about. If she truly distanced herself, she wouldn't say such things. Kathie's feelings for him hadn't changed; they were even deeper.

Aurora Café.

Kaitlyn sat by the window, waiting. She saw atall,beautiful woman outside, looking like a movie star. If only her son's wife looked like that.
But when the woman approached, Kaitlyn was shocked to realize it was Kathie. In the past, Kathie had poor skin and a slim figure, completely unremarkable. Now, she had surprisingly become radiant and enchanting.
No wonder Randy didn't want a divorce. Kathie was indeed attractive,but she wasn't a pure woman.
Kathie maintained basic courtesy as a junior. "Mrs. Berkeley, wha t do you want?"

Kaitlyn motioned for her to si. "Kathie, I'll get straight to the point. You have occupied the position of Randy's wife for four years, making Bob a bastard. Now that he's in school, this needs to be resolved."

Kathie smiled. "How do you plan to resolveit?"

Kaitlyn was displeased. "Divorce, of course. You just want money,right?Name your price. I'll meet it."

Kathie shook her head. "I want more money than you can afford."

Kaitlyn slammed the table. "Just tell me how much you want!"

Kathie thought for a moment and held up three fingers. Kaitlyn scoffed and sipped her coffee. "You want three million dollars? That's a lot, but for my grandson,we'll pay it."
Kathie shook her head. "No, you misunderstood. I want three humdred million dollars."
Kaitlyn choked on her coffee. She couldn't believe Kathie, so young, would demand such an outrageous amount.
"Are you crazy? Why don't you just rob a bank?" Kaitlyn was stunned.

"You asked me to name a price. Looks like I did scare you."

"You're impossible."

Kaitlyn's coughing worsened, her face turning red. Shirley, hiding behind a screen, rushed out to help her. "Mom, are you okay? I told you, she's a greedy, malicious woman, just trying to provoke you."
"She's... too much..." Kaitlyn continued to cough uncontrollably.Shirley turned to Kathie. "You're heartless, saying such things to upset Mom."


Kathie was puzzled. "I just answered her question. How is that wrong?And you've been hiding, watching. Isn't this the outcome you wanted? Are you trying to harm her?"

Shirley denied it. "I don't have such evil thoughts. I just want a title. Mom kindly stepped in to helpme, and now you've harmed her."

Shirley hated Kathie for not letting her mother go, so she seized every chance to attack Kathie.

Kaitlyn's coughing grew severe, her face pale, breathing rapid, as if an old illness had flared up.

"Call an ambulance." Kathie said.

Shirley kept arguing. "If anything happens to her, we won't let you off."

Kathie ignored her and tried to call for help, but Kaitlyn's condition worsened, her body going limp,starting to convulse.

Shirley was startled and tried to help Kaitlyn, but Kathie stopped her."Don't touch her."

The crowd grew, and Kathie waved them off. "Everyone, step back." Then she turned to the staff. "Open the windows for ventilation."
The staff quickly complied, keeping people away and waiting for the paramedics.
Shirley saw Kaitlyn convulsing and her eyes filled with hatred. "Kathie,you're trying to kill Mom. You're so cruel."
Kathie didn't respond. She saw Kaitlyn's weak breathing and checked her.Kaitlyn had a sudden cardiovascular issue, a critical situation, and couldn't wait for the paramedics.

Kathie took out acupuncture needles from her bag. Shirley screamed,"
Kathie, what are you doing? Are you trying to kill her?"

Kathie began the acupuncture, and Shirley called Randy.

Randy answered, hearing Shirley's frantic voice. "Randy, Kathie is trying to kill Mom."

Randy was confused. "What are you talking about?"

Shirley exaggerated. "We're at Aurora Café. Kathie said things to provoke Mom. Now Mom is collapsed and convulsing. Kathie's doing acupuncture on her. I think she's trying to kill her."

Randy knew Kathie hated them. Was she really trying to harmn his mom?

"I'm coming right over. Keep an eye on her," he replied.

Shirley hung up, her eyes filled with malice. If Kaitlyn, who always looked down on her. died at Kathie's hands, it would save her a lot of trouble.

Shirley silently prayed that Kathie wouldn't save Kaitlyn.

After the acupuncture, Kaitlyn suddenly gasped for air. The crowd applauded, but Shirley's face fell. Kaitlyn was alive again.
###Chapter 55 Out of Danger

When Randy arrived, the paramedics were already there, checking on Kaitlyn's condition, which was still critical.

Shirley grabbed Kathie, who was about to leave. "Doctor, she caused the patient to faint. but she also treated her. We can't just let her go."

Randy's face was full of anger. "Kathie, I never thought you could be so cruel. Even if you hate us, you shouldn't take it out on an elderly person."

Kathie rolled her eyes. "Shut up. Saving her is more important. I'll go with you."

Kaitlyn's condition was indeed dangerous. If Kathie hadn't performed acupuncture on her earlier, Kaitlyn might have already died. She wasn't sure if the hospital could arrange surgery in time.

Kathie got into the ambulance, monitoring Kaitlyn's condition the entire way.

Although she didn't want to talk to Randy, she needed to understand Kaitlyn's situation, so she asked, "Send me Ms. Foster's medical records."
Randy looked at her, puzzled. Kathie continued, "If there are no electronic records, just tell me about her condition in detail, including any medications she's allergic to."
Seeing his hesitation, Kathie snapped, "Do you really want her to die?Speak up!"
Randy finally told her that Kaitlyn had cardiovascular disease and chronic pneumonia, and she was very weak,always on medication.
No wonder,Kathie had noticed this during her examination.

At Hospital, in the emergency department. Kaitlyn was taken to the examination room, where the deputy director personally attended to her. He regretfully said. "The patient's condition is very bad. She needs surgery immediately, but our director is out of town.and the two cardiologists are in surgery, which won't be done for at least three hours. The other one is on a business trip and won't be back until tomorrow."


Randy panicked. "What about transferring her to another hospital right now?"

The deputy director shook his head. "It's too late. If someone hadn't treated her before she got here, she would have already died."

Randy stepped back, helpless. "What should we do? Am I just supposed to watch her die?"

Shirley angrily grabbed Kathie's clothes. "Kathie, did you hear that? It's all your fault. If anything happens to her, I won't let you off!"

Kathie pushed her away. "Get lost. Stop yelling in my face."

Randy, seemingly unable to understand the doctor's words,glared at Kathie with hatred. "If anything happens to my mom, I won't forgive you."
Kathie couldn't be bothered to even roll her eyes at Randy. She ignored him completely.
The deputy director issued a critical condition notice. "The patient is in respiratory failure. If we don't operate immediately, she won't make it."
Randy pleaded, "Doctor, please think of something. I can't lose my mother.I'll pay whatever it takes."
The deputy director explained helplessly, "It's not about money. In her condition, there's nothing we can do." Shirley, hoping for the worst, pretended to be concerned. "Doctor,there must be a way. Please don't give up on her. She can't die."

The deputy director shook his head. Kathie hesitated for a moment. As a doctor, she couldn't just stand by and do nothing. She stepped forward."Let me perform the surgery."

Shirley was stunned. "Kathie, I know you have some medical knowledge,but this is a major surgery that requires an expert. Who do you think you are to say you can operate on Mom?"

Kathie ignored her and looked at Randy. "You're the guardian. If you sign the consent form, I can operate. There's no time to waste."

As a doctor, Kathie couldn't bear to see a life slip away in front of her.

Randy hesitated. "Can you really handle such a major surgery?"

Kathie reminded him, "Don't forget, I wasa medical exchange student back in the day. I have more awards than I can fit in a cabinet."
Randy remembered that she was indeed very talented, once hailed as a genius in the medical field.
"Are you sure you can do it?" he asked.

"Randy, you need to understand that nothing is ever 100% certain. But if you keep hesitating, she will definitely die."
Randy nodded. "Okay, I'll sign."

Shirley wanted to stop him but then thought that if Kaitlyn died in surgery.it would be Kathie's fault, which wasn't a bad outcome for her.
She said deliberately, "Kathie, we're trusting you to operate on Mom. Don't use this as an opportunity for revenge." Kathie snapped."All you do is stir up trouble and twist facts. You're useless."

Shirleygritted her teeth. This damn Kathie, even now, she was belittling her.

She thought. Just wait. If Kaitlyn dies, Kathie will be finished too.'

Kathie called the deputy director aside. "Please notify Mr. Watson and have him assist me. Just mention my name, Kathie, and he'll understand."

The deputy director nodded and went to make the call.

Kathie also called Bradley Brooks. This kind of surgery required two people,and he was the best choice.

Bradley rushed over as soon as he got the call, and Randy saw Clayton arriving by helicopter.
Shirley was dumbfounded. What kind of connections did Kathie have to get these two big names here with just a phone call?
She jealously started spreading rumors. "Randy,did you see that? Kathie has some serious connections. She got Bradley and the hospital director here with just a call. Bradley is now the director of Starlight General Hospital, a highly sought-after single man. Getting him to treat someone is harder than climbing a mountain. Clearly, he and Kathie have a special relationship,"

Randy had taken Kaitlyn to Starlight General Hospital before, only to be turned away by Bradley. Now, Kathie had called him, and he came right away.
He had begged the deputy director for help to no av ail, but Kathie got results with just one call. What else was Kathie hiding from him?

"Bradley. the surgery is ready. You and Mr. Watson assíst me," Kathie said.


Clayton was thrilled. He had always wanted to work with Kathie and finally had the chance. "It would be my honor. Let's begin," he said.

Kathie took the lead, using acupuncture to stabilize Kaitlyn's blood flow,combining shamanic practices and modern medicine to ensure her safety.

After four hours of surgery, they finally saved Kaitlyn.

Outside, Randy waited anxiously, while Shirley worried that Kaitlyn might survive.

When the surgery light went off, they rushed forward.

"Kathie, how's my mom?" Randy asked.

Kathie nodded. "She's out of danger. We just need to monitor her closely."

Randy, still worried, turned to Clayton. "Mr. Watson, thank you for saving my mother. Is she really out of danger?"
Clayton felt awkward. He had only assisted, while Kathie did al the work.But he had promised not to reveal her identity,so he took the credit.

Clayton smiled. "The patient is indeed safe, and even her other ailments have been treated."

Shirley's face turned pale. How could this be? Not only did Kaitlyn survive,but her other illnesses were cured too. Now she'd have to endure Kaitlyn's oppression for many more years.

Randy, incredulous, shook Clayton's hand. "Mr. Watson, your medical skills are amazing. My mother has suffered for years, and I never thought
she'd be cured.

Clayton frowned. "Actually, it was all..."

"Mr. Watson, it's an honor to learn from you today." Kathie interrupted.preventing him from revealing her identity.
###Chapter 56 Emotions on a Roller Coaster

Kathie's words snapped Clayton back to reality just in time; he almost revealed her identity.

Clayton smiled and replied, "Dr. Cavendish, can't wait for our next surgery together."


Kathie nodded knowingly. "Alright, the patient's stable now, so we're heading out."

"Thanks for all your hard work today," Clayton said, admiration clear in his eyes. If only he could get Kathie, the Miracle Doctor,to work at his hospital.

Randy stepped forward. "Kathie, I really appreciate what you did."

Shirley immediately cut in, "Why are you thanking her? The real credit goes to Dr. Watson and Dr. Brooks. With her limited skills, she was just an assistant. Plus, Mom fainted because of her; sheshould be held responsible."

Kathie couldn't help but retort, "Shirley, don't get things twisted! Ms.Foster did have a relapse, but blaming me is just because I wouldn't let your mom off the hook."

Shirley's intentions were exposed, but she refused to admit it. "If you hadn't scared Mom, she wouldn't have relapsed so quickly."
Kathie countered, "If you hadn't pushed her to confront me, none of this would have happened."
Randy grabbed Shirley's hand. "You told my mom to go see her?"

Shirley panicked and explained, "Mom wantedI to resolve the divorce issue since it was dragging on. I didn't expect it to turn out like this." Randy's eyeswere filled with disgust. "You're always stirring up trouble and blaming others. I really misjudged you."

Kathie pulled Bradley away, not wanting to listen to their argument.

"You must be exhausted. Let me treat you to dinner," Bradley said, his eyes full of concern. She hadn't stopped for hours during the high-stakes surgery.

Kathie rubbed her wrist. "It's been a while since I did surgery. I'm a bit tired."

Bradley genuinely admired her. "Your hands are still so steady. With you around, there's hope for the medical field."

Kathie smiled warmly. "If you keep praising me like this, I'll get a big head."

They walked out of the hospital, chatting and laughing. Not far away,Ben captured the moment and sent the photo toJonathan.

When Jonathan saw the photo, he almost jumped out of his wheelchair,but his legs weren't healed yet.
He grabbed a cup from the table, ready to throw it, but the image of an angry Kathie flashed in his mind, so he reluctantly put it down.
Annoyed, he immediately called Ben. "What's going on?"

"Mr. Jonathan Berkeley, I'm not sure. I was at the hospital with Mr.Harold Berkeley and happened to see Dr. Cavendish and Dr. Brooks. I didn't have time to greet them," Ben replied.
So,shesaid she had something to do, and it was to meet Bradley.She really made him angry.
"What happened to Harold?"
"There was a disturbance at the branch office. Mr. Harold Berkeley went to stop it and got injured."

Jonathan frowned, his anger rising. "The branch office is acting up? Are Gerald and the others useless? They can't handle this?"

Ben sighed, "Mr. Jonathan Berkeley, things are chaotic everywhere. It feels like there's someone pulling the strings behind the scenes. If you don't come back soon, we might not be able to control it."

When the strong were absent, the weak tried to seize control. It seemed Jonathan had been quiet for too long and needed to step in.

"Get ready. I'll be back at the office tomorrow," Jonathan said.

Ben was relieved. Getting Jonathan to return to the office had been a struggle.

Jonathan wanted to see who was being so bold.

"Jonathan, I sent over a silk comforter. It should help you sleep better tonight," Patricia said,still preparing for their stay.

Jonathan waved her off. "No need. I'm heading back tomorrow."

Patricia and Henry exchanged glances,then clapped excitedly.

"Finally! You're going back. I'll help you pack." Patricia said.

Jonathan added, "I'm just going back for work. I'll be returning here."

Patricia was stunned into silence.

Her emotions were on a rollercoaster. She couldn't understand Jonathan's actions more and more.
Henry reminded him, "Jonathan, I heard there's a lot of unrest at your company. You should be careful. I think you should stay there to keep things under control."

This was another way to push him to stay, but Jonathan wasn't buying it. "I know what I'm doing. You all go back and stop bothering me," he said.

Patricia wasn't giving up. "Henry and I will go, but we'll leave a caregiver to look after you."

She couldn't let Jonathan and Kathie be alone.

Jonathan's sharp gaze swept over her, and he spat out a short command."Everyone out!"

Patricia was furious but didn't dare show it. "Jonathan, I just..."

Her words were cut off by Jonathan's glare, and Henry quickly stepped in to smooth things over. "This place is too small for so many people.Jonathan,you rest well. I'll take them back."

Henry pulled her away, and Patricia left, feeling wronged and tearful.

"Henry, I've done so much for him. Why can't he see my worth? He only thinks about Kathie," Patricia said.
"Kathie is no ordinary woman. She has him wrapped around her finger."

"I don't care. Jonathan can only be mine," Patricia said, her eyes filled with determination.

"Then you'll have to work harder."

Since Jonathan wasn't listening to them, they had to find another way.

At the restaurant, Bradley ordered all of Kathie's favorite dishes.

"You worked hard today. Eat up," Bradley said. Kathie looked at the spicy dishes and asked curiously, "I remember you prefer milder flavors."

Bradley smiled as he served her. "I can handle some spice. You usually avoid it for the kids' sake. Now you can enjoy it."

That was true. Her kids were too young for spicy food, so Kathie often made a separate dish for herself.

But it was a hassle, so she gradually adapted to their diet. She didn't expect Bradley to remember her preferences.

Kathie was touched. "Having a thoughtful friend like you is a blessing."

Bradley felt a pang of sadness but continued to serve her naturally. He had wanted to take care of Kathie for a long time, but she got married before he could express his feelings.

He changed the subject. "Kathie, our hospital received an invitation for a research project. I'd like you to join."

Kathie put down her fork. "Are you talking about the international medical research project? I saw it online."

Bradley nodded. "Five hospitals in the country are participating,and Eldoria has three spots. I believe you're more qualified than I am for this."
Kathie hesitated. "Research projects take a lot of time. You know my current situation."

Bradley understood. "Driving the kids back and forth every day is exhausting for you and them. You should make plans. If you need help finding a place, I can assist."
Kathie had considered this. Her villa in the suburbs was over an hour from the kids' school, which was inconvenient. Her grandmother had asked her multiple times. It seemed she should move the kids back to be with her grandmother.

"You're right. I've been thinking about it." Kathie replied.

"I still hope you ll join the research project. It offers a substantial bonus and exposure to international medical fields, which would benefit you."
###Chapter 57 Why Are You Whispering?

Kathie was genuinely excited. She'd always dreamed of exchanging knowledge with top doctors from around the world and honing her medical skills.

Bradley continued. "I can set it up for you. If you pass on this,you'll definitely regret it."

Bradley was offering her such a golden opportunity. She'd be crazy not to take it.

Kathie picked up her juice. "Bradley, I'm in. Thanks for giving me this chance."


Bradley smiled and clinked his glass with hers. "That's the spirit. I can't wait to see what you achieve."

Just then. Kathie's phone rang. Seeing it was Jonathan,she gave Bradley an apologetic smile and turned to answer it quietly. "Hey, what's up?"

Jonathan,hearing her hushed tone, asked irritably, "Why are you whispering? What are you up to?"

Did he blow a fuse? Why was he so aggressive?

"I'm at a restaurant. It's crowded, and I don't want to disturb anyone."

Jonathan listened carefully and indeed heard background noise,which made him relax a bit.
"Do you know what time it is? Why aren't you back yet?"

"Mr. Berkeley, do I need you to manage my time?"

"Don't forget, I paid you, You're supposed to take care of me." "You're in recovery. As long as you take your meds on time, you'll be fine.If you think I'm not doing a good job, didn't your girlfriend bring in some caregivers? Have them do it."


Jonathan caught onto something. "Are you jealous?"

Kathie replied, "I'm having dinner with Bradley. I'm not jealous."

Jonathan frowned. They were having dinner together?

"Tll pay you extra. Come back and take care of me right now," Jonathan said.


"By the way, I've already sent them all away. They won't bother you anymore. I'll give you an extra million dollars. You love money so much,don't you? Hurry back," he added.

Kathie laughed coldly. Did he think money could get him anything he wanted?

Kathie stillfirmly refused.

Jonathan tried another tactic. "I promised the kids we'd pickthem up from school together this morning. Are you going to make me break my promise?" He just wanted to get Kathie back.
"Don't worry, I'Il explain it to them." Kathie hung up the phone.,

Jonathan was furious.

Kathie was increasingly disregarding him. Not only did she refuse his request, but she also dared to hang up on him.
Jonathan seemed to forget that Kathie had never really cared about him.She wasn't one of those women trying to climb the social ladder by getting close to him. Why should she try to please him? She saved him out of her duty as a doctor, not because she wanted anything from him. Kathie turned back and gave an embarrassed smile. "Sorry about that.He's just a handful."


Bradley, ever the gentleman, didn't pry further seeing her discomfort.

At the entrance of Elite Tots Academy, many parents were already waiting.

Kathie arrived a bit late today and couldn't stand at the front. She craned her neck to look inside.


Kyle was the first to spot her and waved. "Mommy, we're here."

Eileen bounced up and down, her sweet voice calling out, "Mommy,I'm here."

Zachary held Eileen's hand, keeping Bob at bay.

Kathie noticed Bob trying to get close to Eileen several times, ónly to be blocked by Kyle and Zachary. Deciding to have them study together was definitely the right choice.

Eileen was adorable and lively, always the darling wherever she went.Without Kyle and Zachary's protection, Kathie worried someone might take her away.

Kathie gathered her three little ones into the car and noticed the Berkeley family's nanny picking up Bob. It seemed Shirley and Randy were at the hospital with Kaitlyn.
Eileen asked sadly, "Mommy, didn't Seven say he'd pick us up? Why didn't he come? I wanted to show him the medal my teacher gave me."
Zachary also held a medal. "I wanted to show Seven too."

.Kathie ruffled their hair. "Mommy had a surgery this afternoon and couldn't make it back in time. Next time, I'll bring him to pick you up." This was true. By the time Jonathan called her, she couldn't make it back to pick him up.

Kyle nodded. "Mommy, you work so hard and still pick us up."

Kathie gently cupped his face. "Seeing you all makes me happy. It's not hard at all. Is Bob still bothering Eileen?"

Zachary made a face. "He cried in class today because he wanted to sit with Eileen. The teacher moved him to the back so he wouldn't disturb the other kids."

Kathie sighed. It was a cruel twist of fate that they ended up in the same class.

"Just remember, as long as he doesn't cause trouble, you can coexist peacefully," Kathie said.

Kyle added, "If he does cause trouble, we'll handle it."

Kathie nodded. "That's my boy."

Back home, Eileen was always the first to rush inside, as if something precious awaited her.

"Seven, we're back!" Eileen called out.

Jonathan opened his arms to catch her, holding the adorable Eileen close.Seeing Kathie follow, his eyes showed a hint of displeasure,but he still smiled at the kids.

"Eileen, were you happy at school today?" Jonathan asked.

Eileen nodded sweetly. "Yes. I even got a medal."

Jonathan praised, "Good girl! You are amazing!" Zachary held out his fists playfully. "Seven, guess what's in my hands."

Jonathan saw the edge of a medal peeking through Zachary's fingers but played along. "Is it candy?"

Zachary laughed. "No,guess again."

Jonathan pretended to guess wrong.′′Iit a rock?"

Zachary laughed even harder, while Kathie watched, amused but silent.

"Seven, you're so silly. You can't guess it."

Jonathan pulled him close. "Oh, I know. It's a medal too."

Zachary proudly showed his medal. "You got it! I have two medals, more than Eileen."

Jonathan asked seriously, "How did you get more than Eileen?"

Zachary explained, "A gril cried in class, and I comforted her and helped pick up her things. The teacher said I was helpful and gave me a medal."

Jonathan gave him a thumbs up. "You're a true gentleman.Well done."

He then looked at Kyle, who stood with his arms crossed, not interested in showing off any medals.

"Kyle, what about you?"Jonathan asked.

Kyle shrugged. "I don't care about those things. They're for kids."

Jonathan saw a bit of his owna stubbornness in Kyle and couldn't help but pinch his cheek. "Kyle, you should try to join in. You'll find more joy that way,"
Kyle scoffed. "I think they're childish." Jonathan asked seriously, "Be honest, do you really not like medals?"

Kyle frowned. Even the most prideful child likes recognition. He was no different; he just didn't show it like Zachary and Eileen.

Jonathan said, "At home, you're the most responsible, always looking after Zachary and Eileen. You deserve a medal."

Kyle's eyes lit up, and he smiled. "Really?"

Jonathan saw his joy, knowing he was just like his mom, pretending not to care but secretly loving it.

"Of course! I'll make you one right now," Jonathan replied.

Jonathan gathered materials and made a medal for Kyle,who happily placed it on his bedside table.
###Chapter 58 You Bad Woman

Kathie watchedhim doting on the kids and thought, 'He's definitely going to be a great dad someday.'

She then said. "Alright, didn't your teacher give you homework? Go back to your rooms and finish it. Mommy's going to make dinner."

Eileen pouted. "But I still want to play with Seven."

Jonathan cupped her little face. "Be good. I'll play with you later.Right now, I need to help your mommy with dinner."

Zachary grinned. "Seven is just like Daddy. He's so good to Mommy."

Kathie was speechless. What on earth made him think Jonathan was being nice to her?

"I want Seven to be my daddy too. You both should get married soon,"Zachary added.

Kyle nodded in agreement. "I'm on board."

Kathie didn't want her three little matchmakers to keep pushing this, so she quickly waved them off. "Go back to your rooms now."
The three kids grabbed their backpacks and headed to their rooms. Eileen made a gesture to Jonathan. "Seven, wait for me. I'll come play with you soon."

Kathie couldn't understand what kind of magic he had cast on her daughter. Eileen liked him so much.
Jonathan followed her into the kitchen, and Kathie said bluntly, "You don't ·know how to do anything. What are you doing in the kitchen?"
Jonathan washonest. "I can keep you company."
Kathie was speechless, thinking, 'He's so shameless!

Seeing her busy with the vegetables and ignoring him,Jonathan wheeled himself closer. "I've already told Henry and Patricia not to come. You don't need to go out tomorrow."


Kathie shook her head. "You can let them come. It makes things easier for me."


Jonathan frowned. "Are you throwing a tantrum?"

Kathie continued handling vegetables. "You're overthinking it. I'm starting work tomorrow, and I plan to take thekids back to the Cavendish Mansion. My grandma misses them."

Jonathan was slightly taken aback. He didn't expect her to make such changes in just one day.

"What about me? Did you consider me in your plans?" he asked.

Kathie looked at him seriously, "Seven, you said you had amnesia, and I was willing to take you in. But now you know who you are, and your girlfriend has found you. You can go back to your place."

Jonathan was furious. "You promised to cure me."

"I can still treat you regularly. That doesn't change."

"In the end, you just want to abandon me. You're a bad woman."

That made Kathie angry. "You call me a bad woman, but you're a liar.Your friends invade my personal space every day, and your enemies could show up here anytime, Shoudn't I think about myself and the kids?"
.Jonathan had no response. He couldn't guarantee that Henry and the others wouldn't come back, nor could he ensure there wouldn't be any danger. "Then I'll go with you1." Jonathan said.

Kathie was astonished. "You, the president of the Berkeley Group,want to act like a child?"


How could this silly woman not understand his feelings?

"Say what you want. Until I can move freely, you're responsible for me."

"I find you quite shameless."

Jonathan smirked, "What can you do about it?"

Kathie grabbed some flour from the table and threw it at him. "I don't want to see your face."

Jonathan was covered in flour, even his hair. He stared at Kathie in disbelief. "You actually dared to do this to me!"

Kathie had many ways to deal with him, but she couldn't hold back anymore. This was the most direct.

"If you say one more word, I'll dump all the flour on your face," she said.

Jonathan took a deep breath, his eyes fixed on her. "Kathie, you'll regret this." Then he raised his voice, "Kids, help!"
Kathie quickly covered his mouth. "You're really shameless, calling the kids for help again."
Last time, Jonathan had framed her in front of the kids, and now he was doing it again.
The house wasn't big, and with Jonathan's deep voice, the kids' sharp ears picked it up, and they came running.
Kathie facepalmed and threatened him, "If you dare say anything,you'll 
get the most bitter medicine tonight."

Jonathan stifled a laugh. It felt like having a tigress by his side. He had to use the kids to handle her.

"What's going on?" Eileen's voice came before she did.

Kyle was the fastest, reaching the kitchen first and seeing Kathie cleaning flour off Seven's face. "Mommy, what happened?"

Zachary followed, equally puzzled by the scene. "Seven, why is your face covered in flour? Were you playing a game?"

Jonathan was speechless.

Kyle added. "Zachary, I think Seven looks like a scary ghost."

Jonathan's mouth twitched.

Eileen carefully approached and helped wipe his face. "How did you get flour on your face?"

Jonathan glanced at Kathie, who gave him a warning look. "Don't worry.I was trying to help and accidentally knocked over the flour. I couldn't see,so I called for you."

Eileen stood on tiptoe, noticing the flour was on Kathie's side, and asked,"Seven, the flour is on Mommy's side. How did you knock it over from your wheelchair?"

Kathie felt awkward. Her usually careless little one was suddenly sharp.She glared at Jonathan,signaling him to stay quiet.
Jonathan smiled. "It was here before. Your mommy moved it to keep me .from making a mess. She's very thoughtful."
Kathie sighed in relief. At least he was sensible. If he had said anything else,she would have given him the most bitter medicine tonight.

Eileen was half-convinced. "Alright, as long as everything's fine. Mommy,help Seven take a bath. He's got flour all over his head."

Kyle agreed. "We had snacks at school, so we're not hungry. Mommy,help Seven first."


Zachary nodded, and Kathie had no choice but to put down what she was doing. "Okay. Ill do that. You guys go back to your rooms and dIon't come out unless it's important."

Kathie pushed the wheelchair out, and the three kids huddled together,whispering.

Zachary was the first to ask, "Did you notice Seven seemed scared of Mommy? Do you think she's threatening him?"

Kyle nodded. "I noticed. Mommy kept staring at him while he talked."

Eileen looked worried. "I feel bad for Seven. Do you think mommy is bullying him behind our backs?"

Zachary thought for a moment. "Maybe. Let's finish our homework quickly and check on them later."

Kyle agreed, "Alright, let's hurry back to our rooms."

Eileen followed Kyle and Zachary back to their rooms.

Kathie pushed Jonathan into the bathroom. "If you use that trick again.I'll add the most bitter and smelly medicine to your treatment."
Jonathan chuckled. "You really go all out to deal with me."

"You forced me. I'm seriously doubting if you're really Jonathan." Kathie had heard he was cold and unapproachable, but the man in front of her was just a nuisance.
###Chapter 59 Spare Me,I'll Behave

Jonathan never would have believed he could change so much. His personality was nothing to brag about. even to himself. But everything changed after he started spending time with Kathie and her kids. He loved the new him and was increasingly addicted to the joy of being with them.This was what he wanted in a family.

Thinking about it, he patted his chest and laughed, "Absolutely genuine."

Kathie, unaware of his thoughts, sighed, "You should probably get your head checked at the hospital soon."

The warm feeling Jonathan had just experienced vanished instantly,replaced by annoyance. Was she saying he was crazy?

"My head's just fine. I only act this way around you," he retorted.

"So,should I be honored?"

"Kathie, cut the sarcasm. You're just jealous because you saw Patricia come looking for me today. I've already told her not to come anymore."

Jonathan, clueless in love,still hadn't explained his relationship with Patricia. Kathie had made it clear she wouldn't like someone who was already taken. Yet, he kept forgetting to clarify that Patricia publicly calling him her boyfriend was a misunderstanding.
As expected, Kathie was furious. She grabbed the showerhead and aimed it at him. "Say I'm jealous one more time, and I'll wake you up with cold water."

Jonathan was confused. "What's the harm in admitting you like me?"

"You dare say that again."

Kathie turned on the water, drenching Jonathan in icy coldness."Tur it off! It's freezing!" Jonathan screamed.

"Will you stop saying it?"

Seeing she wouldn't stop,Jonathan panicked and grabbed the handrail to stand up. Kathie was stunned.


It was the first time she saw Jonathan stand. He was taller than she expected, his handsome face and athletic build making even his wet hair look attractive.

"You...you can stand!" she said, her eyes wide with shock.

Jonathan,equally surprised, looked at her with joy. "I can stand!"

Kathie waved him over. "Try taking a step."

Jonathan held onto the wall, trying to move his feet, but they felt like they were weighed down by a thousand pounds.

"Don't rush. Take it slow," Kathie said.

Jonathan took a deep breath and forced himself to take a step. Kathie clapped excitedly. "Great job! Try again."

Though he managed a step, the pain was excruciating, pulling at every nerve in his body.

Seeing his pained expression, Kathie rushed to support him. "Don't push too hard.Sit down for now."
Jonathan shook his head. He had waited too long for this moment and feared he might never stand again if he sat down.
"I want to keep trying," he said.

"Okay, I'll support you. Don't strain yourself. You're doing great." 
With Kathie's help. Jonathan took another step. feeling more hopeful. He took a bigger step, but the pain intensified, causing him to fall forward.

Kathie tried to catch him, but her slender frame couldn't support his weight. They both fell, and in the chaos, the showerhead turned on,drenching them both.


Jonathan propped himself up, water dripping from him onto Kathie. They locked eyes, the air thick with tension.


Jonathan wiped the water from her face, his hand lingering on her cheek.

Kathie's heart raced. She tried to get up, but he held her down.

"Let me up. It's cold."

Jonathan smirked. "Now you feel cold? You didn't show me any mercy earlier."

Kathie wasn't in the mood for jokes. She struggled, but he held tightes.

"Seven, if you don't let go, I'm gonna get really mad."

"Dr. Cavendish, this is called sharing the good and the bad.Plus,I'm blocking the water for you."

"Jerk!"

The night air was chily, and Kathie, who was already sensitive to the cold,began to shiver.
Jonathan looked at her trembling body, her fluttering eyelashes making her look like a wounded rabbit, stirring a desire to protect and possess her.
Her lips parted slightly; Jonathan's breathing quickened as a primal urge rose within him, clouding his mind with a single dominating thought:he wanted to make love to Kathie.Kathie felt something hard against her thigh, her cheeks flushing.

"Jonathan, if you don't get up. I'm really gonna get mad. Believe me, I can make sure you never have sex again," she warned.

Jonathan leaned in. whispering. "Once we've been intimate, you won't be able to resist."


Kathie,both embarrassed and angry, freed her hand and slapped him."Shameless."


Jonathan snapped out of it, letting her go. Had he really just thought that?He used to only fantasize, but now he wanted to act on it.

Kathie pushed him off, turned off the shower, and was about to scold him when she noticed three little faces at the door.

Kathie froze. Eileen covered her eyes. "Mommy, we didn't see anything."

Kyle said seriously, "Seven, since you're at this stage, you should discuss when to get married."

Zachary cheered,"We can be the flower children!"

Kathie was mortified.

"Kids, have you finished your homework?" She tried to send them away so she could deal with Jonathan.

The kids nodded. "Mommy, we finished everything. You can check."

Kathie knew her kids were smart. Homework was a breeze for them.

"Then go shell some peas in the kitchen. I'Il make something for you later,"Kathie said.
Eileen asked excitedly, "Mommy, are you going to give us a little brother
or sister?"

Kathie's mouth twitched. "Absolutely not. Having you is enough. Seven just fell while walking,not what you think."

Zachary giggled. "Mommy, you don't need to explain. We get it."

Kathie was speechless. Jonathan's smug look made her want to strangle him.


Kyle waved. "We'll help in the kitchen. You two continue."

Kathie took a deep breath. She couldn't get mad at her kids.She had to send them away first.

Eileen turned, smiling. "I want a sister to wear dresses with."


Zachary shook his head. "A brother would be better. I want a little brother.
"

Kyle suggested, "They could have boy and girl twins."

Kathie was beyond embarrassed.

Her kids' comments were loud and clear. She wanted to disappear.

Jonathan, however, was enjoying it. "Kathie, as adults, shouldn't we make the kids happy?"

Kathie gritted her teeth. "What do you mean?"

Jonathan grinned."We could fulfill their wishes."

Kathie realized he was becoming more shameless.

.She cracked her knuckles, glaring at him. "Seven, you need a lesson."Jonathan raised his hands. "Kathie, have mercy. I'll behave." Kathie shook her head. "No.you need to remember this. Otherwise,you'll just get more and more unruly. It might hurt, but bear with it."

She pressed on his shoulder. hitting a pressure point, making Jonathan scream.


In the kitchen, the kids exchanged glances and laughed.
###Chapter 60 Kathie Has a Fever

Eileen sighed, "Mommy's probably bonding with Seven right now. Guess I'Il have a little sister soon."

Zachary didn't hold back, "Nah, it'll be a brother. I want a smart brother.Sometimes you're just toosilly."

Kyle jumped in, "We'll have both a brother and a sister. Stop arguing."

After Kathie finished scolding him, Jonathan felt like his bones were about to break. He regretted his moment of indulgence; it was his body that paid the price.

Kathie took off his clothes and helped him into the bathtub. Her cold hands touched Jonathan's back, making him shiver.

"Your hands are freezing. Go take a hot bath," Jonathan said.

"Oh, so you do care about me," Kathie said with a sarcastic tone.

They were so busy bickering that they forgot her clothes were wet.

Jonathan surrendered, "It's all my fault. Go quickly."

Kathie prepared a towel and clean pajamas. Watching her busy back,
Jonathan felt a warmth in his heart.

He knew that no matter how fierce Kathie seemed, she had a soft heart.

Kathie suddenly sneezed. Jonathan urged, "Stop fussing and go take a bath.11


Kathie put down what she was holding and left, feeling a bit dizzy.

At dinner, Kathie had no appetite.

The three kids watched Kathie and Jonathan, their eyes full of unspoken words.

Kathie knew her children too well and smiled wryly. "Just say what you want to say."


Eileen spoke first. "Mommy, when are you going to give me a sister?"

"I already said it'll be a brother. I want a brother," Zachary said, afraid Eileen would get her way first.

Kyle gave them a look, and Zachary and Eileen fell silent. As the oldest,Kyle still had authority.

Seeing this, Jonathan couldn't help but laugh. Kyle was like a mini version of him.

If only these three kids were his.

Kathie took a deep breath. Seeing their high expectations, she decided to set things straight. "Seven and I are just doctor and patient. We won't develop any other relationship. Don't get your hopes up and end up disappointed."

"What?" The three kids were visibly let down.

Kathie thought she'd feel relieved after saying it, but she felt strangely uncomfortable.

Jonathan wanted to say something, but Kathie cut him off, "Don't make promises to the kids you can't keep."
She didn't want Jonathan to say things on a whim and leave the kids waiting in vain.
."I'm full. You all take your time," Kathie added.

She then got up and went back to her room. The others exchanged glances,
the atmosphere heavy.

Seeing the kids' disappointment, Jonathan leaned in. "Don't listen to your mommy. My relationship with her will only get closer."

Kyle asked directly, "Seven, do you want to be our daddy?"

Jonathan knew this was no joke. After serious consideration, he nodded."I do!"


That simple statement reignited the kids' spirits. Zachary said happily,"Fine,we can help you."

Eileen was enthusiastic. "I know all of Mommy's hobbies. I can tell you."

Kyle nodded. "We'll help you win Mommy over. Just be good to her, and if you occasionally act a bit spoiled, she won't be able to resist."

Jonathan smiled awkwardly. "'Kyle, acting spoiled won't work with your mommy."

Kyle thought for a moment. "You're right. Sorry, I forgot you're an adult.Just try other ways. Buy her flowers, give her gifts she likes. Make her like you."

Eileen said seriously, "I can tell Mommy likes you. She's just too shy to admitit."

Jonathan rubbed her little face. "I love hearing that. She's just stubborn. I'll find a way."

Eileen extended her small hand, determined. "Let's form an alliance.We have to get Seven and Mommy together."
.Zachary put his hand on top. "We won't give up until we succeed."

Kyle added his hand, his face serious. "We'll do whatever it takes to make
Seven our dad."

Jonathan was momentarily speechless.

He was genuinely touched, but hearing such vows from the three little ones made him want to laugh.

But in this solemn moment, with the kids watching him, he placed his hand on top, gripping their small hands. "Thank you. When I become your dad. I'll take good care of you."

The four of them formed an alliance, and Jonathan listened to the kids'suggestions, finding them both amusing and endearing.

That night, after Kathie put the kids to bed, she felt her head getting heavy and her body weak.

She went to the living room to get a glass of water, but her legs gave out,and she collapsed to the floor.

Jonathan heard the noise and rushed out, seeing Kathie trying to stand up,holding onto the door frame.

"What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?" he asked with concern.

Kathie held her forehead. "I think I have a fever."

Jonathan approached, grabbing her arm and pulling her close. He felt her forehead,which was indeed burning.
"You must have caught a chill. Do we have a thermometer? Any fever medicine?" he asked.
Kathie nodded. "Yes, in the medicine cabinet under the TV."

Jonathan held her hand and maneuvered his wheelchair, guiding her  to the couch. "Sit tight. I'll get you some water." Jonathan fetched her water and found the medicine box, taking out the thermometer to check her temperature.


He felt guilty, knowing it was his fault she got soaked and caught a cold.

Kathie lay on the couch, sighing. "I haven't had a cold in years, and now I have a fever."


Jonathan looked at her with concern. "Everyone gets sick sometimes.Just rest. We'll deal with everything else tomorrow."

Kathie worried. "The kids have school tomorrow."

Jonathan took out his phone. "I'Il call Ben to come over. He can take the kids to school. Don't worry."

Kathie looked at him, surprised at how reliable he was in this moment.

Jonathan made sure she drank more water. When the thermometer beeped,it confirmed shae had a high fever.

"We should go to the hospital. Your fever is too high," he said.

Kathie smiled weakly. "Did you forget I'm a doctor? Get my acupuncture needles from the bedroom. I have fever medicine in the box. I just need to sweat it out."

Jonathan was still worried but followed her instructions, seeing the determination in her eyes.
Kathie took the medicine and performed acupuncture on herself. Jonathan watched her forehead break out in a sweat,feeling both anxious and concerned. "How do you feel? If it gets worse,we're going to the hospital."
.Kathie took a deep breath, and Jonathan could feel the heat radiating from her. "My head feels heavy. I want to sleep," she said weakly.

"Tll take you to bed. You've taken care of me all this time. Now it's my turn to take care of you."


Jonathan's gentlesmile made her feel at ease, but also a bit sad.

If only he weren't Jonathan, she would keep him. But there were no ifs.

Jonathan helped her lie down, tucking her in. Kathie curled up into a small bal, looking so vulnerable and pitiful.

Her forehead was still hot, her body like a furnace. Jonathan didn't know if he should take her to the hospital immediately or wait for the medicine to work.
###Chapter 61 He Wants to Make Love to Her
Jonathan sat by the bed, feeling a sense of responsibility for the first time.He wanted to protect Kathie.

Half an hour later. Kathie kept mumbling about being hot. Jonathan reached over to feel her forehead. It did't seem as hot as before,but she was drenched in sweat.


"Kathie,how are you feeling?" he asked.

Kathie half-opened her eyes, her cheeks flushed, her chest heaving. She looked uncomfortable, yet there was an irresistible allure about her that made Jonathan's heart race.

Her rosy lips slightly parted, exuding an enticing breath. "Seven, I'm so hot.Help me take off my clothes."

Jonathan's heart skipped a beat. "Are you delirious? Do you know what you're saying?"

With Kathie's temper, if he dared to undress her without permission,he wouldn't know how he met his end.
Kathie let out a soft gasp, the sound piercing the quiet night and making Jonathan freeze.

"So hot," Kathie muttered, trying to undress herself, but her hands were weak, and she couldn't manage it. "Take off my clothes. I'm so hot."
Seeing her frown,Jonathan grabbed her fumbling hands. "I'll help you, but you have to promise not to get mad when you wake up tomorrow.""
"Hurry up!" Kathie urged impatiently. He wasn't sure if she even heard him.
Jonathan saw that her back was radiating heat,her clothes soaked with sweat. She must really be hot.

He unbuttoned her nightgown, hesitating for a moment when he reached her chest, then turned off the light.

He wanted to look, but he couldn't take advantage of her. In the darkness,he fumbled to remove her clothes, his hand brushing against her soft,supple breasts. He tensed up, swallowing hard to stay calm.

Jonathan noticed her pajama pants were also wet and had to take them off too,even removing her damp underwear.

By the time he was done, Jonathan was sweating too, but it was from holding back his desire.

He kept reminding himself that Kathie was a sick patient with a fever.He couldn't have any inappropriate thoughts about her.
"Cold... so cold!" she murmured.

Jonathan was silent.

He had just helped her undress, and now she was saying she was cold.The change was so sudden. He quickly found a clean nightgown for her and coveredI her with a blanket.
Jonathan had never taken care of a sick person before and didn't know if he was doing it right. He could only follow her requests.
"Seven, I'm cold.," she said softly.

Jonathan found another blanket in the closet and covered her. "How about now?Feeling any better?"
."I'm still so cold." Kathie curled up into a ball, shivering slightly.

Jonathan felt her forehead. Her temperature was so low. It had only been ten minutes, but the change was drastic.

He added another blanket and asked with concern,"Is it better now?"

Kathie didn't respond, her teeth chattering,shivering violently.

Jonathan frowned, worried. "I think we should go to the hospital, justin case."


As he was about to call, Kathie grabbed his wrist, trembling. "Hold me tight; I'm so cold."

Her icy touch on his wrist, Jonathan lifted the blanket and held Kathie in his arms.


Earlier, she had been like a furnace, now she was like ice.

Feeling the warmth,Kathie burrowed into his embrace.

Kathie's soft body rubbed against him, her long legs wrapped around his waist. Jonathan didn't dare move,afraid of losing control.

But Kathie in his arms didn't intend to let him go.Her face pressed against his chest, her lips brushing his neck, making Jonathan's whole body tense.

"Kathie, are you trying to seduce me?"he asked.

"Cold," she uttered, the single word sounding almost like a whimper,softening his heart.
Jonathan held her tighter, trying to transfer all his body heat to her.

Kathie's lips moved up, gradually reaching Jonathan's chín. This feeling was strangely familiar, like the woman from that night.
As Jonathan was still thinking. Kathie's lips covered his,making his mind go blank.

Kathie's soft tongue touched Jonathan's lips, sending a jolt through him.

In an instant, Jonathan flipped her over, pressing her beneath him,deepening the kiss.

Jonathan's hands roamed uncontrollably over her waist. Her waist was so slender, he could hold it with one hand.

Her breasts was alluring, and he couldn't resist leaning down to suck them."You can't blame me; you were the one who tempted me," he murmured.

Kathie let out a melodious moan, and Jonathan, as if possessed,reached down to pull off her pants, eagerly spreading her legs and pinning her beneath him.

He was consumned by desire, but just as Jonathan was about to make love to her, he suddenly froze.

What was he doing? Kathie was feverish and delirious. He was supposed to be taking care of her. If he took advantage of her in this state, how was he any different from a rapist?

Jonathan slapped himself, quickly getting off her, dressing them both properly, and holding her honestly, rubbing her arms and back to warm her up.

After a while, Kathie finally calmed down, falling asleep in his arms.

Jonathan felt her forehead. It wasn't as hot as before. He sighed in relief and fell asleep too.
The next morning. Kathie woke up feeling hot.

She first felt a weight on her body. opened her eyes to see three blankets.and something pressing on her waist. Her first thought was that her three kids had crawled into bed with her, making it crowded.

But when she turned around,she saw Jonathan's handsome face.

Kathie thought she was hallucinating and reached out to poke his face.It was elastic.

Jonathan grabbed her hand. "Had enough fun?"

Kathie was startled and quickly moved to the side. "What are you doing in my bed?"

Jonathan sighed, liftingthe blanket and sitting up, his dark circles particularly noticeable. "Do you really not remember what happened last night?"

Kathie saw her changed nightgown and remembered she had a fever last night.

"You changed my clothes?" she asked.

"Yes. And you said you were cold, grabbed my hand, and asked me to hold you."

Kathie got out of bed. She hadn't been sick in years, and now she had a high fever, all because Jonathan made her get soaked in cold water.
"I would never ask you to hold me. You must have climbed into bed yourself," she retorted.

Jonathan looked aggrieved,pointing to his eyes. "Look at these dark circles.
You caused them, and now you want to deny it. You're a bad woman."

Kathie actually believed him but didn't want to admit it.

"T've taken care of you for so long. What's wrong with you watching over me for one night?" she said. Faced with the unreasonable Kathie, Jonathan was helpless. "I won't argue with you. You're still weak. Ben is outside. He'll take the kids to school later."

Kathie stubbornly said, "I'm fine."

As she spoke, she felt dizzy. Jonathan caught her just in time. At that moment of contact, some scattered images flashed in her mind.

Kathie wasn't sure if it was a dream, but it seemed like she saw them kissing.
###Chapter 62 Why Is There a Red Mark on Yor Chest
Kathie's face turned red as she took a couple of steps back to put some space between them.


Jonathan sighed, "You should just take it easy today. Whatever you need to do can wait until tomorrow. You don't want the kids seeing you like this,do you?"

Kathie remembered she couldn't let the kids worry about her, so she reluctantly agreed. "Afright, I'll leave it to you. I'll go wake them up."

As Kathie opened the door and stepped out, she saw the three kids coming towards her. Remembering that Jonathan was still in bed, she quickly stepped out and closed the door behind her.

Kyle looked puzzled. "Mommy, what's up? You look like you're hiding something."
Kathie gave an awkward smile. "You're imagining things. Mommy's just a little dizzy."

Zachary asked with concern. "Mommy, are you sick?"

Eileen grabbed her hand. "Are you feeling okay?"

Kathie gently led them to the living room, smiling warmly. "Don't worry,sweethearts. Mommy just didn't sleep well last night and feels a bit dizzy.I can't take you to school today, so Seven's friend will take you."
Kyle,always the considerate one, started massaging her head. "Oh, I see.Then you should rest up at home. Don't overdo it."
Zachary nodded. "You've been working too hard. You need to take care of yourself."

Eileen climbed into her lap and hugged her neck, giving her a kiss."
Mommy, take good care of yourself."

Kathie's heart melted. "I will,sweetie."

Eileen then noticed something on her chest. "Mommy, why do you have red marks on your chest? Did a mosquito bite you?"

Kathie looked down curiously. Her loose pajamas revealed two red marks on her chest.

More memories flooded her mind, and her heart started racing.

Those fragments weren't dreams; they were real.

Jonathan had taken advantage of her.

Suppressing her anger, she first reassured the kids."It was a really big mosquito. I'll get rid of it later. Now, go pack your bags and get ready to leave."

Eileen asked again, "Mommy, have you seen Seven? We went to his room,but he wasn't there."

Zachary added, "I woke up early to ask him to teach me some boxing."

Kyle chimed in, "We looked everywhere but couldn't find him.Where did Seven go?"
Kathie made up an excuse, "He had something to do last night. You'll see him when you get back from school."
Kathie forced a smile at the kids, who looked puzzled.

"Mommy, you look really angry," Zachary observed.

Kathie shook her head. "You're overthinking, Zachary. Mommy's just

really tired. Let's get you to the car."

Kathie led the kids outside,where Ben was waiting with the car door open.Following Jonathan's instructions, he had also prepared breakfast for them.

"Kids, this is Ben. Don't be naughty in the car," Kathie introduced.

The kids greeted him politely, "Good morning. Uncle Ben."

Ben,seeing the kids up close, finally understood Jonathan's feelings. They were so adorable and well-behaved that he couldn't help but want to be close to them.

He smiled at the kids, "Good morning, kids. If you need anything, just let me know. There's breakfast on the seats, so have some before we go."
"Thank you."

Despite her anger, Kathie was grateful for Jonathan's arrangements.

Ben got into the car and said politely, "Dr. Cavendish,I'll contact you after I drop the kids off at school."
Kathie nodded. "Thank you. I appreciate it."

She watched the car drive away, took a deep breath, and headed back inside to confront Jonathan.
When she reached the bedroom, Jonathan was already fast asleep,clearly exhausted.
Kathie raised her hand to hit him but then lowered it.

Jonathan was still recovering, and last night's situation must have been chaotic for him too. She couldn't remember all the details, so she couldn't place all the blame on him.

Feeling sticky and uncomfortable, she decided to clean herself up first.In the bathroom, she took off her pajamas and noticed the two red marks in the mirror. They were clearly from being sucked.

Just like that night four years ago, when that man had left her covered in red marks.

Feeling feverish, she assumed she hadn't fully recovered from her cold and quickly took a hot shower.

Jonathan woke up around noon, surprised that Kathie hadn't woken him.

He wheeled himself out to find Kathie had already prepared lunch.

"You're awake. Come eat," Kathie said.

Jonathan sensed something was off and wondered if she remembered last night.
If she did, he was in for a rough time.

Feeling guilty, he asked, "How are you feeling now? Any better?"

Kathie's response was calm. "Much better. Thanks for taking care of me last night."
Jonathan took the utensils she handed him. The atmosphere was a bit tense.
He broke the silence first, "I need to go to the office tomorrow to handle some work."
He had planned to go today,but he was too tired to deal with it.

Kathie had also planned to meet with some researchers today, but that was now impossible.

"I have to start work tomorrow too. I can't manage everything at home.Since you're going to the office, you might as well go home," she said.

Jonathan put down his utensils, displeased. "I made it clear last time. I'm not leaving until I've recovered."

Kathie stared at him. "Seven, why are you following me? Give me a reason to let you stay."

Jonathan looked at her seriously. "Because I like you."

Kathie was stunned. He said it so directly, without any hesitation.

"What about Patricia?" she asked.

Jonathan frowned. "I'll explain everything to her."

"I don't want to ruin someone else's relationship or be your backup. You've been together for years. It's not something that should be easily replaced." As a woman, Kathie knew how hurtful that choice could be.
Jonathan insisted, "It's not what you think..."

"Enough. You understand my point. If you want to stay, you're just my patient. Nothing more." Kathie cut him off. She could care for him as a doctor,but that was it.
Jonathan knew she needed time to process. Once he sorted things out with Patricia, he'd confess to Kathie properly. "Being a patient is fine. I'm not leaving,"he said.
Kathie felt a mix of joy and shame for her feelings.

She knew she should stay away from him since he had a girlfriend.

In the afternoon, Kathie gave him acupuncture, and Jonathan felt more sensation in his legs.

"T'll help you walk in the yard," Kathie suddenly said.


Jonathan was eager to try. As he reached out to hold her shoulder, she handed him a crutch instead.


Jonathan chuckled. He wanted to get closer to her, but she had a backup plan.


"When did you prepare this?" he asked.

"Not long after you arrived. I knew it would come in handy today. Use your strength to stand up and then use the crutch to move forward slowly.
"

"I think it would be more effective if you helped me walk."
###Chapter 63 He Is Irreplaceable

Kathie saw right through Jonathan's antics. "I think crawling suits you just fine.What do you think?"

Jonathan straightened up, trying to play it cool. "I was just messing around. This cane is nice, but it's a bit stiff."

Kathie teased. "Yeah, but you should be grateful you're tough. Falling off that high cliff didn't kill you, and now you get to use this cane."

Sensing the edge in her words, Jonathan knew he had to behave. If he really angered her, he'd be the one to suffer.

With the help of the cane, Jonathan managed to take a few steps. After two hours of practice, he could walk back and forth twice.

Seeing him drenched in sweat, Kathie handed him a towel. "Take a break.That's enough for today."
Jonathan asked, "Who's gonna help me practice tomorrow when you're not here?"
"You'll practice on your own," Kathie replied, then went inside to get some water,ignoring him.
Jonathan noticed she was deliberately keeping her distance and avoiding physical contact. She was probably thinking about last night.
So why wasn't she making a fuss and pretending not to remember?

The only explanation was that she liked him too.

Thinking about this, Jonathan couldn't help but smile, feeling quite pleased ·with himself.
At six in the evening, Ben still hadn't brought the kids back.Kathie stood

at the door, worried. She trusted Ben, but she couldn't help but fret when her kids weren't home on time.


Jonathan said, "Relax. Ben will bring them back."

Just as he finished speaking. Ben's car appeared.

Kathie quickly walked outside. The car stopped, and Kyle, holding a toy car, excitedly said, "Mommy, look! Uncle Ben bought us gifts. This is the race car I've wanted for so long."

Zachary held up a puzzle, beaming. "Mommy, Uncle Ben got me the special edition puzzle I've wanted for ages. I love it."

Eileen held a limited edition Barbie doll. "Mommy, Uncle Ben bought this for me."

Kathie understood why they were late. Ben had taken them to pick out gifts.

"Ben, you really shouldn't have. You didn't need to spend so much," she said.

Ben smiled. "Dr. Cavendish, you saved Mr. Berkeley, which is like saving my life. Your kids are so adorable, I couldn't resist. Consider these as welcome gifts. No need to feel burdened."
From inside, Jonathan said, "He makes a million dollars a year. You don't need to be polite with him."
Kathie was grateful that so many people cared for her three little ones."Thank you so much."
Ben nodded with a smile. "It's my pleasure. If you need anything in the 'future, just let me know."
Jonathan coughed twice. Then Ben stepped back.


Jonathan then sald. "What he just said goes for me too. If I'm not around.you can always contact him."

Kathie nodded. "Thank you.Come in for a cup of coffee."

Ben shook his head. "No need, Dr. Cavendish. The company is a bit chaotic right now. I have to go."

Hearing this, Kathie didn't insist. She thanked him again.

Jonathan gave Ben an approving look. Smart move.

Jonathan looked at the three kids, pretending to be hurt. "Kids, have you forgotten about me now that you have new toys? You didn't even say hello.1


The past few days, the kids had always run to him first when they got home. This was quite a change.

Eileen put down her toy and hugged his hand. "Seven, nothing in this world is more important than you."
Kathie found it a bit cheesy. When did Eileen learn to say things like that?

Kyle handed him the toy car. "Seven, do you like race cars? We can play together."
Zachary also came over. "And the puzzle. We can do it together. It's really fun."

Jonathan laughed. "Remember, no matter how many people come into your lives, you have to like me the most."
The three kids nodded firmly. "Okay, we promise."

Kathie didn't want to deal with Jonathan's childishness and went to the kitchen to prepare dinner.

She occasionally heard laughter from the yard. She had to admit, since Jonathan arrived, the kids were happier and more lively.

Kyle whispeed. "Seven, were you in Mommy's room this morning?"

Jonathan's brow furrowed. Kyle knew quite a bit, but Kathie had deliberately closed the door to keep them from knowing. If he said anything. Kathie would surely give him a hard time.

Zachary added, "Adults shouldn't lie to kids. Think carefully before you answer."


Jonathan was troubled. Zachary was too smart for his own good. Despite his soft and cute appearance, he was quite the little manipulator.

Eileen looked at Jonathan expectantly, waiting for his answer.

Jonathan glanced towards the kitchen, then beckoned them closer and whispered, "Your mommy doesn't want you to know. She'll get mad."

Kyle gave a knowing smile, making Jonathan laugh. "Just pretend you don't know, so she doesn't get upset."
Eileen excitedly asked, "When will Mommy give us a little brother or sister?11

Jonathan awkwardly smiled. "Well, that's hard to say. Maybe in a couple of years,"
Kathie noticed the yard had gone quiet. Curious, she came out and saw the four of them huddled together, whispering.
"What mischief are you up to?" Kathie teased.

.The four quickly dispersed. Jonathan grinned. "Is dinner ready? The kids said they're hungry."

Kyle quickly added. "Yeah, Mommy. I'm a bit hungry. What's for dinner?"

Zachary and Eileen also rubbed their bellies, indicating they were hungry.

Kathie laughed. "When you got out of the car, Kyle had ketchup on his mouth. Zachary had salad dressing, and Eileen had strawberry jam. If I'm not mistaken. Ben also took you for burgers and cake, right?"

The three kids looked at her in amazement. "Wow, Mommy,you're amazing.How did you know?"


Kathie raised an eyebrow. "So, what were you talking about?" She returned to the previous topic.

The three kids looked to Jonathan for help. He motioned for them to go inside,leaving him to face her.

"I can tell you, but you can't get mad," Jonathan said.

Kathie took a deep breath and smiled. "Alright."

Jonathan moved his wheelchair to the door, ready to make a quick escape if needed.

But Kathie's mocking look said it all. His move was a bit childish. A wheelchair couldn't outrun someone on foot.
"We were discussing how to get you to admit you like me."

Kathie was instantly flustered. "Who said I like you!"

"Never mind then. You continue cooking. I'll go supervise their homework."Jonathan then turned and left calmly, narrowly escaping.
Kathie felt conflicted. She understood the kids' feelings, but she and Jonathan were from two different worlds, like parallel lines that would never intersect.

The next day.

Kathie had fully recovered. After dropping the kids off at school,she went to see Bradley. She needed to report to the research institute today.
###Chapter 64 Kathie Proves Her Strength

The handsome Bradley and the beautiful Kathie arrived together at the research institute,catching everyone's eye.

"Bradley, I can handle this on my own," Kathie said.

Bradley gave her a gentle smile. "I have my reasons for sticking around."

Knowing how dependable he was. Kathie didn't push back.

Bradley knocked on the project team's meeting room door. Inside, a group of talented individuals were already deep in discussion. Among them was a familiar face-Henry.

"Dr. Cavendish, what brings you here?" Henry's questioning tone caught the attention of the others. Everyone in the room was a notable figure, but Kathie was an unfamiliar face to them.

Bradley introduced her, "Everyone, this is my assistant, Kathie. She was also my junior in school. She'll be representing me in this research project."

Bradley came from a prestigious medical school abroad, and by mentioning that Kathie attended the same school, he emphasized her background and capabilities.

Henry sneered, "Her? I've never heard of any of her achievements.She probably doesn't even have clinical experience.She only knows a few herbs.How can she participate in an international medical research project? Is she even qualified?"

Kathie stepped forward. "Dr. Stewart, whether I'm qualifiedor not,why don't we find out?"

Kathie now understood why Bradley insisted on accompanying her.He was worried that her youth and reluctance to reveal her identity would

lead to others giving her a hard time.

Bradley spoke up. "I can assure everyone that Dr. Cavendish's medical skills surpass mine."


His statement was met with skepticism. An elderly man named Stephen Diaz stepped forward. "Dr. Brooks, this young doctor looks like she's in her twenties. She's just your assistant. How could she be more skilled than you? Are you just trying to cover for her?"

Bradley retorted, "Every field has itsrising stars. Dr. Cavendish may be my assistant, but her medical skills, especially in acupuncture, are exceptional. I am not as skilled as she is."

Henry interjected, "That's all talk. When it comes to serious illnesses,modern medicine is what we rely on."

Kathie calmly replied, "Whether it's traditional practices or modern medicine, as long as it can save lives, it's good medicine. This gathering of medical talents from various countries is to learn from each other's strengths and save more patients. If you can't see that, have you forgotten the duty of a doctor due to your arrogance?"

Henry was left speechless, seething with anger. He looked down on Kathie and couldn't stand the idea of working with her, so he deliberately made things difficult for her.

"If you want to participate, can you even identify the thousands of herbs in the research institute? Each herb has its own medicinal value, unlike the few herbs you know from home!" Henry pressed on.

Stephen chimed in, "Although Dr. Stewart's words are harsh, they are true.
If Dr. Cavendish can't even identify the herbs. how can she be part of this important project?"

"She's probably just trying to use everyone's work to boost her own

reputation," others cut in.

Kathie was indeed young and unknown, so it was hard for them to accept her participation in such an important project. Despíte Bradley's introduction, they didn't show her any respect.

Feeling emboldened by the support of others, Henry continued, "Dr.Cavendish, you heard them. It's not just me who doubts you. If you're here with ulterior motives, you can leave now."

Bradley wanted to speak up, but Kathie stopped him with a look.She confidently stepped forward. "I get it. You have doubts. So, I'll prove myself with my skills. Dr. Stewart mentioned there are thousands of herbs here. Each of you can pick a few. If I can't identify even one, I'll leave immediately."

Henry sneered, "You're so full of yourself. This institute has herbs from all over the world, some of which even I haven't seen. You're making a big claim, which shows how boastful you are."


Stephen frowned. "Dr. Cavendish, even I, with decades of experience in herbal research, wouldn't make such a claim. You're overestimating yourself."


"Exactly, no one here would accept such a challenge," Henry snorted.

Bradley was worried. He knew Kathie's abilities, but identifying herbs from other countries was uncertain.

He whispered, "Kathie, don't act on impulse. If you show them your skills over time, you can dispel their prejudice and doubts."

Kathie smiled bitterly. "Bradley, I know you mean well, but no one .believes in me now. It will be tough for me going forward. It's better to prove myself now, and everything will be easier later."

"Are you confident? If not, you could reveal your identity."

"Don't worry; I've got this."


Kathie had traveled the world and studied herbs extensively. It wasn't for nothing.

Bradley nodded and spoke up, "Since Dr. Cavendish has made such a statement. I'll also pick a few herbs. I want to see her skills. If she can't identify them. I'll take her away."

Henry mocked. "Dr. Brooks, if you take her away now, no one will say anything. But if she fails to identify the herbs and embarrasses herself,she won't be able to stay in Eldoria."

Kathie glanced at himn. "Dr. Stewart, you talk too much. Why don't you go find the most difficult herbs for me to identify? If I fail even once,I'll leave immediately."


Henry gritted his teeth. He had never met someone so arrogant. "Fine, you said it yourself. If you lose, don't blame us for being harsh.I'm sure everyone here is curious about Dr. Cavendish's abilities. Let's all go to the herb library and pick some herbs."

Everyone had no choice but to follow Kathie's suggestion and went to the herb library to pick a few herbs each.

To be fair, Bradley picked a few random herbs, while Henry deliberately chose rare herbs from other countries.


Each of the ten people picked several different herbs, totaling nearly a hundred. If Kathie could identify them all, it would be impressive.

Kathie remained calm."Who wants to start?"

Bradley looked at Stephen. "You're the elder; you should start."

Stephen nodded and brought the herbs he had carefully selected.Seeing her youth, he didn't have high expectations.

"I have six herbs here. If you can identify four, you'll pass my test."Stephen wanted to give her more chances because she was young.

Kathie appreciated it. "Thank you, Professor Diaz. I should be able to manage."


Kathie took the herbs, examined them closely, and sniffed them.Everyone watched her intently, finding it quite interesting.

Henry,seeing her delay, mocked, "What's wrong? Can't identify even one?"

Kathie ignored him and addressed Stephen, "St. John's Wort,Oregano,Comfrey, Oregano Oil, Vervain, Lemon Balm."

Stephen looked at her in disbelief, while Henry sneered, "You're just making things up. Who can name herbs so quickly?"
###Chapter 65 Jonathan's Return

Henry couldn't believe Kathie could identify the exact herbs just by smelling them. Even the most seasoned herbalists needed labels to tell them apart. How could someone so young possibly do it?

He was waiting for Kathie to mess up, but to his surprise, Stephen nodded."Wow, you got them all right. I thought you were kidding, but you really know your stuff."


Kathie smiled. "Thanks for the compliment."

Next up was Bradley, and Kathie nailed his six herbs too.

Henry couldn't accept this. He shook his head furiously and shouted, "This is impossible! You all must be helping her by picking easy ones!"

Kathie calmly replied, "Then bring over the herbs you picked. They must be difficult,right?"

Henry handed over his carefully selected, rare, and hard-to-identify herbs.He had chosen the most challenging ones, and he didn't believe Kathie could get them all right.

Kathie examined them closely, sniffing each one. For some she wasn't sure about, she used a disposable cup to steep the herbs in water, taking her time.


To Henry, this all seemed like a show.

"Well, have you figured it out yet? You haven't named a single one,"he mocked.

Kathie tasted the herbs with the tip of her tongue and finally made her decision. "I'm ready."

Henry's eyes widened as Kathie began, "This is Rhodiola from Novara, also

found in Astrania and Luminara, but slightly different from our domestic variety. The second one is Angelica from Zypheria, the third is Gentian from Draconis..."


Henry was stunned as Kathie accurately named herb after herb, some of which he hadn't even heard of.


If the others had chosen domestic herbs to help her, he had picked one from each country, and she still got them all right.

How could this be? How did she know all of them?

No one had given her any hints, and it was her first time here.

Stephen clapped, and the others looked at Kathie with admiration. Bradley had no idea Kathie had this surprise in store.

It seemed that even if he hadn't come today, Kathie would have handled it easily.


To be fair, Kathie got all the herbs right, and the room erupted in cheers.

Even Henry had to admit that Kathie was truly remarkable.

Stephen extended his hand. "Dr. Cavendish,welcome to our project team.I believe your presence will be a tremendousasset."

Kathie shook his hand. "I won't let you down."


She glanced at Henry, who reluctantly nodded. "You're impressive.
Welcome aboard." Despite her skills, he still looked down on her personal style.

Kathie didn't care what he thought. Making a skeptic acknowledge her .was her skill.


Bradley sighed in relief. "Now it's up to you. I'm heading back to the

hospital."

Kathie was grateful and saw him to the door. "Don't worry, I can handle it.
"

Back in the office, the sound of high heels echoed outside, and a stunning woman with long hair walked in. Kathie thought she might be in the wrong place.

"Sorry, I'm a bit late," the woman said, scanning the room with a smile that quickly vanished when she didn't find her target. "Is Dr. Brooks not here yet?"

Henry teased, "You might be disappointed. Dr. Brooks isn't joining this project. His assistant Kathie is handling it. He left five minutes ago; you just missed him."

This was Amelia Griffin, the research director's daughter, known as the most beautiful doctor in Eldoria.

Amelia looked at Kathie with disdain. "What qualifies you to replace Dr.Brooks? Did you use some underhanded means?"

Stephen defended Kathie. "Dr. Griffin, Dr. Cavendish's abiliies are evident to everyone here. She is more than capable."

The others nodded in agreement, showing their support for Kathie.

Amelia laughed coldly, "Forget it, her presence will just add some fun.Since Dr. Brooks isn't here, I'll attend to other matters. Call me if you need anything."

She shot Kathie a disdainful look before leaving,exuding arrogance.

Kathie,targeted for no reason, found Amelia's hostility baffling.Did Amelia see her as a rival?

At the Berkeley Group. Ben wheeled Jonathan back into the company.

The entire place buzzed with excitement.

In the conference room, directors and shareholders were in a heated discussion, interrupted by the sudden opening of the door.

They turned to see who had interrupted, and their eyes nearly popped out."Mr.Jonathan Berkeley?"

Jonathan raised his hand and smiled. "It's my first time seeing you all so animated."

When he was in charge, no one dared to speak so boldly.

Harold glared at Jonathan, who was supposed to be dead,with hatred.

"Mr. Jonathan Berkeley, it's good to have you back."

"Yes, we finally have our leader again."

"Mr.Jonathan Berkeley, please take charge."


The directors eagerly welcomed Jonathan's return.

Jonathan signaled to Ben, who wheeled him over to Harold.

"Harold, I'm back," Jonathan said.

Harold clenched his fists. "It's good you're back. You look seriously injured;you should go to the hospital."

Jonathan's voice turned cold. "I mean, you should step down."

Harold's father, Gerald, quickly stood up. "Even though you're back,this position belongs to Harold. Are we supposed to let a cripple lead?"

Jonathan's icy gaze made Gerald uneasy, "Harold's head is bandaged, yet

he's sitting here. Me being in a wheelchair shouldn't be an issue."

He added. "Harold, you're the eldest of the Berkeley family. How could you let yourself be bullied and the shareholders oppressed? You and your father are truly incompetent."

Jonathan's harsh words left Gerald and Harold humiliated.

Gerald fumed. "Jonathan, I'm still your elder. How can you speak like this?
1

Jonathan retorted, "Am I wrong? While I was away, did you accomplish anything? From what I know, you didn't. You even lost several key projects and orders to competitors, didn't you?"

Jonathan's words cut deep, each one a blow to Gerald and Harold.

Jonathan's father, William Berkeley, nodded approvingly. "Since Jonathan is back, you should take Harold to the hospital. Don't delay his treatment."

Jonathan agreed, "Indeed, you being here is pointless."

Facing the critical stares, Gerald gritted his teeth and had no choice but to let Harold step down for Jonathan.

Gerald warned, "Don't get too cocky. The battle isn't overyet."
###Chapter 66 Will You Marry Jonathan?

Jonathan watched Gerald's pretentious display, arms crossed, glaring up at him. "Gerald, we might not know who's gonna win yet, but if I find out who tried to kill me. I'll tear them apart."

Gerald's expression shifted, but he quickly forced a smile. "Jonathan, with your arrogant attitude, you've made plenty of enemies. There are a lot of people in Eldoria who want you dead."

Jonathan shot back, "And does that include you?"

Everyone's eyes turned to Gerald, making him visibly uneasy. Rumors had been circulating that Jonathan's car accident was orchestrated by Gerald and Harold.


"Alright, Gerald, take your son and leave. If you stay any longer,you might not have any dignity left," Jonathan said coldly.

Gerald stormed off, vowing to one day dethrone Jonathan.

Jonathan took his seat at the head of the table, and the atmosphere in the conference room changed instantly. The previously defiant shareholders fell silent. Everyone knew Jonathan's methods-those who worked with him made a lot of money, but those who opposed him faced dire consequences.

"Everyone, I know a lot has happened recently. I'm already working to make up for all the losses. Within a week, everything will be back on track,"Jonathan said.

The room erupted in applause. He added, "You all know my temper.If anyone tries to mess with me, don't blame me for retaliating."

The board members quickly agreed, relieved to have him back in charge.
Those with other plans quickly abandoned them, not daring to challenge

him.

In the hallway. Harold was fuming. "Dad, wasn't Jonathan supposed to be dead? How did he come back without us hearing a thing?"


Gerald's face was grim. "Then we'll just have to make sure he dies again."

Harold grabbed his arm, nervous. "What do you mean by that? Did you have something to do with his accident?"


Gerald's eyes were unreadable. "Don't worry about it. In Eldoria, there are plenty of people who want him dead. The head of the Berkeley Family will be you."


The Berkeley Group traditionally had the eldest male of the main family as the head. This time, it should have been Gerald,or at least Harold, the first grandson. But Jonathan's grandfather had chosen Jonathan, the youngest grandson, causing much discontent.

Jonathan's business acumen had doubled the group's profits in just four years,making him the richest man in Eldoria. His subordinates were loyal,and Gerald and Harold's status had plummeted.

"Grandpa was biased. I have to fight for what's mine, no matter what it takes," Harold said.


"That's my boy. I'll help you."

Gerald patted his shoulder. Harold spotted a familiar figure ahead. "Dad,you go ahead. I have something to take care of."

Gerald left without asking questions, needing to find a way to eliminate Jonathan.

Patricia was just turninga corner when Harold blocked her path.

"Patricia, long time no see. You're even more charming than before," he

said.

Patricia tried to sidestep him, but Harold spread his arms to block her."Don't be so cold. I had my entire company vote for your new song. Can't you see? I'm the only one who truly cares about you."

Patricia rolled her eyes. "Harold, no one asked you to do that. Move aside,I don't like you."

Harold taunted, "Jonathan doesn't like you either, yet you still follow him around. He's crippled now. What fun is there in being with him?"

Patricia snapped back, "Who says he doesn't like me? I've been the only one by his side all these years."

Harold hooked a finger in her hair, a playful smile on his face. "Do you really not know why he keeps you around? It's because you saved him once. It's gratitude, not love. You won't be happy with him."

Patricia's eyes flashed with panic, but she shook her head. "No, Jonathan loves me. I've called him my boyfriend on TV many times, and he's never denied it."


Harold laughed. "Fool. He's using you as a shield. Everyone knows he doesn't like women, and they suspect his orientation. With you around, it dispels those doubts."

Patricia had considered this before. Despite her efforts, she couldn't make Jonathan fall for her. But he looked at Kathie differently; he clearly liked women.

"No matter what you say, I won't leave him unless he tells me himself that he doesn't love me," she retorted.

Patricia tried to push past him, but he pinned her against the wall and kissed her hard. She bit him, and he let go, wincing in pain.

Harold's lip was bleeding, but he wasn't angry. He wiped the blood away,eyes full of mischief. "Patricia, you're even more enticing than before. I wonder if your skills in bed have improved too."

Patricia looked around nervously, warning him, "Don't talk nonsense. I'll never choose you."

Harold grinned. "I like your fiery spirit. I've set my sights on you."

"You're crazy!"

Patricia stormed off. Harold wanted everything Jonathan had, includíng the women around him.

Patricia needed to find a way to shut Harold up. If Jonathan heard about this,it would be bad for her.

She stopped, realizing that Kathie's children resembled Harold. Could he be their father?

Harold was notorious for his affairs. It wouldn't be surprising if he had slept with Kathie and fathered her children.

If that were true, it could work in her favor.

Patricia entered the CEO's office, where William and his wife were talking to Jonathan.

She politely greeted them.

Tiffany Anderson beamed at her. "Patricia, come here. We were just talking about you."

Patricia's bright eyes looked at them innocently, making her even more .endearing. "What were youtalking about?"

William smiled. "We were saying you and Jonathan are a perfect match.

Now that he's back, we want you two toget married soon."

Tiffany held her hand. "Patricia, I want you to be Jonathan's wife.Will you marry him?"


Patricia was well-liked by the couple and believed Jonathan loved her.After all these years, he must have feelings for her.

She blushed and nodded. "Of course, I will. I've always seen Jonathan as my future husband."

"You're such a good girl. Jonathan, we're waiting for the good news."Tiffany hadurged him many times.

Jonathan,seeing their enthusiasm, frowned. It was time to have a serious talk with his mother.

At noon. Kathie had just left the research institute when she got a call from Clayton.


"Mr. Watson, what's up?" she asked.

"Dr. Cavendish, please come to the hospital. Kaitlyn is having complications."
###Chapter 67 He Does Not Agree to Divorce
Kathie was the one who performed Kaitlyn's surgery initially. Now that Kaitlyn was having complications, the doctors couldn't figure out the problem, so they had to call Kathie back to take a look.

Kathie understood the situation. Since she had operated on Kaitlyn,she felt responsible for seeing it through.

"Got it, I'll be there right away," she replied.

The research institute wasn't far from the hospital, and Kathie arrived in just over ten minutes.

Clayton met her at the entrance, handing her the latest test results and explaining Kaitlyn's condition in detail.

After listening, Kathie understood. "We did multiple surgeries on her at once. Her body was too weak to recover properly, and now she's been further stressed,causing poor blood circulation."

As they spoke, they reached the hospital room. Shirley's eyes widened in shock when she saw Kathie. "Why is that bitch Kathie here again?"

Randy scolded her angrily, "Shutup,Kathie is here to treat Mom."

Shirley wouldn't let it go. "I bet you just wanted an excuse to see her again and rekindle your old flame."

"Can you stop causing trouble? Didn't you see Mom was so upset she coughed up blood?"

No wonder the report showed Kaitlyn had liver congestion. Kathie had found the cause.

"Are you idiots? This is a critical recovery period for the patient. She needs peace and quiet. If you want to argue, do it outside. And Shirley, watch

your mouth."

Kaitlyn sighed weakly. Her biggest regret was letting Shirley into their family.


Shirley, a shrew, couldn't compare to Kathie.

Shirley tried to shift the blame. "It's not my fault Mom fainted because you upset her..."


Randy slapped Shirley, silencing her. Before she could react, he grabbed her hand and dragged her out, apologizing to Kathie, "Sorry, Kathie.Please take care of my mom. I'll deal with Shirley."

To avoid disturbing Kathie's treatment, Randy forcibly took Shirley away.

Kathie sighed in relief. At least it was quiet now.

"Randy, if you abandon me, I'll fight you to the end!" Shirley warned.

"Shirley, get a grip. Your dad disowned you, and your mom's in jail. What do you have left? You think you can trap me with a child? You should be keeping a low profile. If you keep acting up, I'll kick you out right now,"Randy snapped back.

Shirley's support was gone. Walter had abandoned her, and Randy was her last hope.

"You can't be so heartless. I've been with you for five years. You promised to marry me," she said.

"Look at yourself. You're no different from a shrew. We're not married.Breaking up is just a word away for me, so you'd better not provoke me.Now get out."

Their loud argument drew the attention of the nurses, who whispered among themselves.

"Tll leave, but you can't be with Kathie!" Shirley shouted.

Randy rolled his eyes,not taking her seriously.

Seeing his anger. Shirley didn't dare to argue further and left reluctantly.

Randy returned to the room, where Kathie was already performing acupuncture. Seeing his mother's face regain some color, he felt relieved.

"Kathie, I never realized you were so skilled," he said.

"There's'a prescription on the table. Give it to her twice a day. She needs to rest and recover during this period," Kathie replied.

Kaitlyn looked at her with admiration. "Randy, you need to thank Kathie properly. Without her, I wouldn't have made it through."

Kathie responded calmly, "I'm a doctor. It's my job to save lives.'I'd do the same for anyone."


Her words made it clear she didn't want to get involved with their family.

Randy looked at her tenderly. "Don't worry, Mom. I'll thank her properly."

Kaitlyn gave him a look, hinting that if he really liked Kathie,he still had a chance to win her back.

Kathie removed the acupuncture needles, and Kaitlyn took adeep breath."
It doesn't hurtanymore. I actually feel relaxed."

"If there's nothing else, I'll be going." Kathie said flatly.

Randy stood up, eagerly offering to carry her bag. "T'll walk you out."

Kathie took her bag back, replying coldly, "I can manage on my own."

Randy followed her out. "Let me treat you to dinner to thank you for coming."

"No need. It's best if we act like strangers."

"Kathie, I know I was wrong. Can you give me another chance? Ever since you came back. I can't stop thinking about you. I don't want a divorce.I want to be a father to your threekids."

Kathie stopped and stared at him. "Why don't you admit it's because I've become more attractive and successful that you don't want a divorce? You're tired of Shirley and the other women. You need something new."


"It's not like that. I've always loved you. I just realized it now. I'll treat you well."


"Forget it, Randy. I'm ready to divorce. Prepare the papers,and we'll finalize it tomorrow."


At this point, Kathie saw no reason to delay the divorce.

Randy grabbed her, insisting, "No matter what, I won't divorce you. I'll win you back."

Kathie shook him off, looking at him like he was crazy. He had chased her for a divorce, and now that she agreed, he refused.

"If you won't divorce, I'll sue. Don't forget, we've been separated for four years. The court can grant a divorce."

Randy realized he could have done this sooner.

"I won't divorce," he insisted.

Kathieignored him and quickly walked to her car, driving away.

Randy watched her leave, his eyes full of longing, while Henry shook his head behind him.

Henry had come to pick up some documents and saw Kathie and Randy's

confrontation.

Kathie really had a way of manipulating the Berkeley family. He couldn't let her get close to Jonathan.

Henry immediately called Patricia.

Patricia was with Tiffany when she saw Henry's call and stepped outside
to answer. "Henry, I'm in Jonathan's office. What's up?"

"Patricia, I just saw Kathie and her husband at the hospital. She's very manipulative. You need to secure Jonathan."

"Don't worry. Jonathan's parents are on my side."

"Good, I'll help you too."

Patricia returned to the office and overheard Jonathan talkíng to his mother.


"Mom. I've told you I won't marry Patricia. You need to let go of that hope.



"Why not? Patricia is a wonderful girl. Do you really like Kathie,the country girl? She has three kids and isn't even divorced yet."

"I have my own plans. I won't marry Patricia, so give up."

Patricia clenched her fists. She couldn't believe he would say such things after all these years. He showed no regard for her feelings.
###Chapter 68 The Spark Has Faded

Patricia gritted her teeth. Kathie was truly cunning-keeping Jonathan wrapped around her finger despite having a husband. She had to find a way to win Jonathan back before her chance slipped away forever.


After leaving the office. Jonathan called Kathie and learned she was at the school. He instructed Ben to drive him there.

Just as Kathie arrived at the school, she spotted Randy waiting at the entrance with a bouquet of flowers. It didn't take a genius to figure out he was waiting for her.

Kathie sighed in frustration. How was she ever going to shake off this human barnacle?

As students began filing out, Kathie hoped Randy would leave once he picked up his own child. Instead,he sent his nanny ahead with his kid and hurried over when he saw Kyle and the others emerge.

"Kyle, hasn't your mother arrived yet?" Randy asked eagerly.

Kyle glared at him with undisguised contempt. "Why are you asking about our mom? We barely know you."

Zachary made a face at him. "Go away! Mom always gets upset when she sees you."

"Yeah, you're so annoying," Eileen added with a look of disgust.

Randy laughed awkwardly. "I know I made mistakes in the past. but I want to make things right with your mother. I could be a good father to all of you."

Kathie couldn't stand it anymore. She strode forward and pulled him away from the children.

She shouted, "Randy, what's wrong with you? Don't fill the kids' heads with nonsense."

Randy thrust the flowers toward her. "Kathie, please give me another chance. I promise to take care of all of you and treat the children as my own. You don't want people gossiping about your children being illegitimate,do you? I'm willing to claim them as mine."

Kathie cut him off with a wave of her hand. "I don't need your sacrifice. I'd rather face a lifetime of judgment than let my children call a fraud their father."


She turned to leave with her three little ones, but Randy shamelessly followed.


"You can insult me all you want-I'll take anything if you'll come back to me. Kathie, I know I was wrong. Can't you forgive me?" he said.

Kathie clenched her fist, desperately wanting to hit him. If not for the children watching, she would have given Randy the thrashing he deserved.

As Randy followed them all the way to their car, Kathie was reaching her breaking point when suddenly a hand pulled him back.

"Ben!" The three children exclaimed, as if seeing their savior.

Kathie exhaled with relief. "Ben, your timing couldn't be better."

Ben glared at Randy. "Dr. Cavendish, do you need assistance?"

"Desperately. Keep him away from me."

"Of course. Mr. Berkeley is waiting for you by the road." Ben positioned himself between Randy and Kathie.

Kathie looked over and saw Jonathan waving from his car.He'd come personally.

"Thank you." Kathie said1, eager to escape Randy.

Randy shouted after her. "Kathie, don't think throwing yourself at him will get you into high society! The Berkeley family will never accept someone like you!"


Kathie wasn't naive-she knew perfectly well that aristocratic marriages were beyond the reach of ordinary people.

Yet as soon as she got in the car, Jonathan said,"His opinion doesn't represent everyone's."

Kathie looked startled. "What do you mean by that?"

Kyle explained, "Seven means you could marry him."

Eileen's eyes widened with excitement. "Is Seven saying he wants to marry Mom?"


"Obviously," Zachary chimed in.

Kathie rolled her eyes and playfully tapped each child's head. "Don't get any wild ideas."

Jonathan's lips curved into an amused smile. His meaning had been perfectly clear-this stubborn Kathie was less perceptive than her children.

"I'm planning to move back to the family home this weekend," Kathie said."Commuting to and from the cottage takes too much time, and my grandmother misses the children. It's a good opportunity for them to spend time with their great-grandmother."

Jonathan nodded. "Fine by me. I'll come with you."

Kathie frowned. "You'll be with your family and that girlfriend of yours.Why do you need to follow me around?"

Jonathan teased. "You sound jealous."

Kathie gave him a wickedsmile. "I think I need to increase your medication for tinnitus-you're clearly hearing things that weren't said."

Jonathan knew he needed another approach, but he was determined to stay with her. "You've taken my money, so you're responsible for me until I'm fully recovered. Besides, do you really think these three can bear to be separated from me?"

Kathie confidently began, "Of course they can manage without..."

Before she could finish, all three children had thrown their arms around Jonathan. making their position abundantly clear.

He had won their loyalty long ago.

Jonathan looked triumphant while Kathie was left speechless. She'd have to tolerate his presence for now, at least until he recovered.

Back at Maple Grove Residence, Kathie prepared dinner with Jonathan insisting on helping.

As he clumsily trimmed vegetables, he cleared his throat. "What happened today isn't good for the children. You should resolve this situation quickly."

Kathie sighed. "Don't you think I want to? If he'd just agree, I'd file for divorce today. I don't understand what's gotten into him-he was desperate for a divorce before, and now he refuses to even consider it."

"Would you like me to help?" With his family connections, Jonathan could easily solve the problem with a single word.

"Let's wait a bit longer," Kathie said. "If it becomes impossible, I'll ask for your help."

Jonathan wasn't pleased. The mere thought of Randy hovering around her

irritated him.

He set down the vegetables with a cold expression. "I'll go check on the children's homework."


Kathie wondered what she'd said to upset him. For a grown man,he could be remarkably childish.


That evening, after bathing the children and tucking them in, Kathie went to Jonathan's room. She found him drenched in sweat and immediately felt his forehead.


"Why are you sweating so much? Are you feeling unwell?" sheasked.

Jonathan wouldn't admit he'd been secretly practicing walking. He could now stand and take a few steps while holding onto the wall.

If Kathie knew about his progress, she might stop helping him with certain things.

"I tried standing up earlier, but my legs gave out. I almost fell," he lied.

Kathie examined his legs with concern. "You should be able to walk gradually by now, but your recovery seems slower than expected. I'll need to adjust your medication tomorrow."

Jonathan feigned worry. "Will I ever fully recover?"

"Of course you will. I've never failed to hea a patient. You need to have faith in yourself. Now, let's get you bathed."

Kathie wheeled him to the bathroom and had him lean his head back against her knee while she washed his hair.

.Every time her fingers ran through his hair, Jonathan felt a flutter in his chest.

As she leaned slightly forward, her full breasts occasionally brushed against his forehead, soft and warm, stirring unwelcome desires.

Jonathan watched her through half-closed eyes. Her lush red lips moved as she spoke, igniting something within him.

"Dr. Cavendish, what would you do if someone suddenly kissed you?"

Kathie answered calmly, "I'd paralyze them with my needle. Why,would you like to try?"


Jonathan grinned. "Try to be a bit more gentle; it makes you more endearing to others."

Kathie rolledI her eyes. "I don't care. I prefer living on my own terms without constraints. Don't try to box me into your expectations-it won't work. Close your eyes now, unless you want soap in them."

Jonathan closed his eyes. She really was a stubborn womnan who couldn't take even the smallest joke. She had effectively doused the flame of desire that had been building within him.
###Chapter 69 Tell Her the Truth

After helping Jonathan bathe, Kathie wheeled him back to his room.As she turned to leave, he caught her hand.


"T've been having trouble sleeping these past few nights," he admitted.

"And?" she prompted.

"It might sound inappropriate, but... would you stay with me tonight? I promise not to try anything. Besides, with your temperament, I wouldn't dare."


"How much is Mr. Berkeley offering per night?" Kathie asked dryly. ·

Jonathan blinked, realizing she'd misunderstood his intentions.

"I was just kidding. Goodnight!" he said quickly.

Kathie rolled her eyes and left. Jonathan sighed in frustration.How was he supposed to express hs feelings to this woman?

Back in her room, Kathie pored over medical textbooks, searching for better treatments for Jonathan. The sooner he recovered, the sooner she could return to her normal life.

The next day at the detention center, Shirley pulled strings to visit her imprisoned mother.

Melissa had been charged with conspiracy to commit murder, with irrefutable evidence against her. Her lawyers said she was facing at least ten years. She sat huddled in the corner, a shell of her former self.

When Shirley called out to her, Melissa's eyes lit up. She quickly stood and ·took her daughter's hands, noticing her swollen eyes.

"Shirley, what happened? Who upset you?"

Shirley broke down crying. "Mom, Randy refuses to divorce me. He's constantly chasing after that bitch Kathie. If they get back together, Bob and I will be thrown out of the house."

Melissa's face darkened with regret. She should have eliminated Kathie years ago when she had the chance.

"What about Randy's mother, Kaitlyn? She's always cared about her dignity. Surely she'd help you."

Shirley shook her head angrily. "Ever since Kathie saved her life, she's been on Kathie's side. I overheard her yesterday telling Randy to win Kathie back."


"And your father? Is he no help either?"

"Dad won't even see me. He's completely infatuated with his secretary and apparently plans to marry her."

Melissa felt the bitter sting of disappointment. After a lifetime of scheming,she was now alone and helpless. With Randy being so spineless,her daughter's situation looked dire.

Shirley clutched her mother's hands. "Mom, what should I do? Randy is ignoring me and even our child. If he throws me out, I couldn't bear the shame."

Seeing her beloved daughter in such distress broke Melissa's heart.

"The root of the problem is still Kathie. If she insists on divorce, Randy would have no choice."


"But what if she doesn't want to divorce him?"

'"Get her to come see me. I'll make sure she agrees to the divorce."

Melissa explained her plan, assuring Shirley that Kathie would comply

with their demands.

At the research institute, Kathie had just started her workday when her phone rang. Seeing Shirley's name, she immediately declined the call.

When Shirley persisted, Kathie blocked her number.

Moments later, an unknown number called. Noticing her colleagues'curious glances. Kathie apologized and stepped onto the balcony to answer.

"Hello?"

"Why did you block mhy number?" Shirley demanded.

Kathie was about to hang up when Shirley quickly added, "My mother wants to see you."


"Why would I care about seeing her?" Kathie replied coldly.

"Don't you want to know the whole truth about what happened years ago?My mother can tell you everything. I'll wait for you at the entrance in an hour.Don't be late."

The temptation was too great. While Kathie had uncovered some clues,she still lacked concrete evidence. If Melissa was willing toreveal everything,she could finally learn the complete truth.

"I'm on my way."

Kathie called Alan Griffin, the institute director, to request time off.Though taking leave after just two days didn't look good, this matter was too important to delay.

Alan understood her urgency and approved her request, though some .colleagues were visibly displeased.

Henry watched her gather her things and couldn't resist ajab," You get

special treatment to work here. leave early regularly, and now take time off whenever you please, holding up everyone's progress."

Kathie faced him squarely. "I earned my place here through the same evaluation process as everyone else. I have an emergency to handle, and I'Il make up for any lost time. Perhaps you should focus more on your own work rather than monitoring mine."

Henry's face reddened, but Kathie had no time to waste on him.

As she reached the main entrance, she encountered Amelia,who looked her up and down with disdain. "Well, if it isn't Dr. Cavendish,leaving during work hours. Do you think this institute is your personal playground?"

"I've beengranted leave," Kathie replied coldly.

Amelia smirked. "Off to meet a wealthy patron? With your pretty face,I'm sure you attract plenty of older men."

Kathie's expression darkened. "Your flamboyant style seems more suited to that purpose."

Amelia's smile vanished. Ever since hearing about Kathie's connection to Bradley, she'd been openly hostile.

"Everyone knows abouat your scandalous personal life-cheating on your husband,having three illegitimate children, carrying on with multiple men.Quite impressive."

"Dr. Griffin, as an educated person, you might try speaking with some civility."

Amelia sighed dramatically. "Thank goodness I don't have embarrassing friends like you. I couldn't show my face in public."

"I wouldn't befriend someone as ill-mannered and unattractive as you either," Kathie retorted. "Your nose job is crooked,by the way. You might want to keep wearing that mask to avoid frightening people."

"You..." Amelia sputtered.

Kathie had struck a nerve. Seeing someone approaching, Amelia quickly covered her nose, wondering how Kathie had noticed her rhinoplasty.

At the detention center, Shirley greeted Kathie with undisguised hatred. "Let's go. I've been waiting forever."

Inside,Kathie saw Melissa-once elegant and imperious, now aged and haggard.

Sitting across from her, Kathie got straight to the point, "How did my mother really die?"


Melissa fixed her with a serious look. "I'll tell you everything, but first you must agree to divorce Randy. I've had papers drawn up. Sign them, and you'll get your answers."

She pushed the divorce agreement across the table, which stipulated that Kathie would walk away with nothing. Without hesitation, Kathie signed.

"Now tell me the truth." She had never cared about Randy's money and wouldn't take a penny now.

Satisfied, Melissa handed the papers to Shirley, and they exchanged pleased glances.

Melissa began, "Since you're being so cooperative, I'll be direct. Yourfather wanted to be free of your mother's control. He bribed a doctor to kill her but keep the baby, hoping for a son. When another girl was born-his third daughter-he decided he didn't need another burden and had the newborn killed as well."

Kathie stared at her in shock. "You're saying my baby sister was born alive and he murdered her?"
###Chapter 70 Only You Treat Trash as Treasu
Kathie now knew that Waler was involved in her mother's death, but she never imagined that her newborn sister had actually been alive at birth.

She thought bitterly. 'To kill his own newborn daughter - he's an absolute monster!


"Do you have evidence that any of this is true?" Kathie asked coldly.

Melissa gave a cynical laugh. "I wouldn't have asked you to come if I didn't. The head of obstetrics back then was Abigail Rodriguez. She resigned and left the country after your mother died, but she's maintained contact with Walter all these years. She did your father's dirty work, and in return,he promised her a lifetime of wealth."

The name Abigail struck a chord with Kathie. While reviewing company finances, she had noticed annual payments to someone by that name,labeled as "equipment purchases."

So Walter had been using Scarlett's inheritance to support the very person who helped kill her. How could people be so cruel?

"Do you know Abigail's address?" Kathie asked.

"I'm not sure. A few years ago, I overheard your father on the phone with her. They mentioned Blackhaven. When I asked about it, he flew into a rage and told me never to bring it up again."

Kathie's eyes hardened. "So Abigail is likely in Blackhaven. Do you have any way to contact her?"

Melissa shook her head. "I tried investigating before, hoping to find something to use against them, but I came up empty. With Jonathan's connections, though, you should be able to find her."

Kathie stared at her intently. "Is there anything else you need to tell me?"Melissa visibly faltered before claiming, "I've told you everything I know."

Standing up. Kathie said icily, "If I find out you're lying to me, the person you love most will suffer terribly."

Melissa clenched her fists, knowing she couldn't hide the truth. "I admit it.I was responsible for your mother's death. I bribed the doctor to ensure she wouldn't survive. But I truly had no idea that the newborn was alive-Walter killed her."

The pain was almost unbearable. Kathie took a deep breath to steady herself.

"You both deserve to die," she said. "Turn yourself in, or I swear I'll make Randy throw your daughter and grandson out on the street."

"You..."

"Save your breath. I will divorce Randy, but you need to face the consequences of your actions. DDon't think that murder can be erased just because time has passed."

Melissa lowered her head. "I'll turn myself in. But if you don't divorce Randy, I'll haunt you even from beyond the grave."

As Kathie turned to leave, she thought of her mother's gentle face and felt tears silently falling. She had dealt with Melissa, but there was still one more person responsible whom she would never let escape justice.

Outside the detention center, Shirley rushed up to her. "I called Randy, but he refuses to divorce you."

Kathie frowned at Shirley's eagerness. Despite her hatred for what Shirley and her daughter had done, for her children's sake, she had chosen

forgiveness and wanted to move forward with the divorce.

"I will divorce him. If he doesn't agree, I'll file a lawsuit."

Shirley's face contorted with anger. "You must be feeling quite smug now.Randy revolves around you and has no time for us. All my scheming has turned into a joke."


Kathie could only laugh at the absurdity. "Only you would treasure garbage like Randy. I'm going to find him right now and end this marriage today."

"Really?" Shirley couldn't believe her luck.

"Unlike you, I don't have ulterior motives," Kathie said before walking away with the agreement.

Since she had already taken the day off, she decided to resolve everything now. She called Randy and arranged to meet.

Randy was thrilled to receive her call, but his face fell when he arrived at the café and saw the divorce papers in front of her.

"Kathie, you asked me here for a divorce?"

She glared at him coldly. "What else? Did you think this wwas a date? I've already signed the agreement. All you need to do is finalize it with me."

Randy refused. "This isn't my agreement, and I have no intention of divorcing you."

"I'm walking away with nothing. What more do you want? We've tortured each other for years-it's time to end this completely." Kathie's tone left no room for negotiation.

Randy sat down dejectedly. After a moment, he said, "If you really want a divorce, fine,but I have one condition."

She was already giving up everything, yet he still had the audacity to make demands. Kathie was curious to hear what he would say.

"Go on."

"We never consummated our marriage, yet you had three children with another man. This has caused me immense psychological damage.I need compensation."


"Compensation?" Kathie couldn't believe her ears.

Randy nodded self-righteously. "Yes. I need fifty million dollars for emotional distress. Once you provide that, I'll agree to the divorce."

Kathie threw her coffee in his face. "You're shameless! You were the one who got involved with Shirley first. She drugged me, causing me to be taken advantage of by another man and become pregnant. And now you have the nerve to blame me? Fifty million dollars? How dare you!"

Randy wouldn't back down. "I don't care. No money, no divorce."

Kathie was seething when a voice behind her thundered, "I've met shameless people before, but you take it to a whole new level."

She turned to see Bradley standing there.

"Bradley? What are you doing here?" Kathie asked.

Bradley apologized to his companion and asked them to leave.

"I was discussing business with a friend when I overheard this conversation. I couldn't stay silent," Bradley replied.

Randy lifted his chin defiantly. "This is between my wife and me. It's none of your business. Unless you want to take on a divorced woman? Or perhaps you're the father of her three bastards?"

Before Kathie could stop him, Bradley lunged forward and punched Randy. She hadn't wanted to cause a scene in public.

Bradley grabbed Randy by the collar. "How can someone as despicable as you exist? Say another word like that, and I'll end you."

Randy shouted. "Everyone. look! My wife has been promiscuous, had three illegitimate children during our marriage, and now wants to divorce me for this pretty boy!"

Furious, Kathie took out an acupuncture needle and inserted it into a pressure point on Randy's body. He immediately fell silent, staring at her in terror.


Kathie sighed. "You deserve to be mute. If you dare say another word out of line, I promise you'll never speak again."

Randy nodded fearfully, well aware of Kathie's medical skills.

Kathie removed the needle and said angrily, "I am getting this divorce.If you don't agree, we'll go through legal channeIs."

Randy shook his head. "I was just upset. I truly love you. Please don't divorce me.Come back to me."


Kathie looked at him with utter contempt. "Someone like you doesn't deserve to speak of love. Get out of my sight."
###Chapter 71| Can't Live Without You

Randy stood frozen in place as Bradley escorted Kathie out of the café.Unknown to them, Amelia was outside, capturing the entire scene on her phone.

Amelia had deliberately dressed up after learning Bradley would be meeting a friend here. She hadn't expected to witness such drama. So Kathie is that kind of woman,' she thought smugly. 'How interesting that Bradley wants someone like her.'

Outside the café. Kathie's emotions were in turmoil. "You shouldn't have hit him," she said worriedly. "He's vindictive. I'm afraid he might try to hurt you."

Bradley looked down at his fist. "If he dares come after me, I'll gladly teach him another lesson. That punch was letting him off easy. I'm just happy you're finally divorcing him."

His genuine joy and the affection in his eyes made Kathie's heart tighten.She had always viewed Bradley as a brother, never romantically.His reaction seemed far more intense than mere friendship would warrant.

"Thank you, Bradley. You're a wonderful man. I'm sure you'll find your soulmate someday."

Bradley smiled sadly. "I believe in God's plan and in destiny."

"A kind, gentle man like you is bound to meet someone who captures your heart completely-someone who loves you just as much. I need to go now."

Bradley wasn't a fool.He recognized her gentle rejection.

"Take care," he said, watching her walk away, unable to follow.


He had always been a step behind. Back when Kathie spent all her time with Melinda, he'd already thought she was special. By the time he realized he loved her, she had married Randy. Now that she was back, he'd finally gathered the courage to approach her, only to find Jonathan already in her life.


Perhaps he was destined to lose to the Berkeleys. But if anyone ever broke Kathie's heart, he wouldn't let them get away with it.

Later that evening, Kathie returned to the family estate with shopping bags to visit her grandmother Ophelia and prepare for the weekend move.
Ophelia beamed as she watched Kathie bustling around.

"When you called yesterday about moving back, I thought you were just humoring me. Now I believe it."

Kathie hugged her. "I'd never lie to you, Grandma. I want to be here with you. I hope you won't mind the noise the children will make."

Tears welled in Ophelía's eyes. "I've been longing for them! How could I mind? I'll have the housekeeper prepare plenty of food for when you arrive."

Seeing her grandmother's happiness. Kathie knew she'd made the right decision.

"There's one more thing-besides the three of us, we'Il have an injured guest moving in as well."

"A patient of yours?"

"Something like that. Do you mind?"

Ophelia smiled. "I trust your judgment. More people means more life in this house. I don't mind at all."

By the time Kathie finally returned to the villa that night after dinner with Ophelia, she felt strangely weak. The house seemed to spin as she stepped inside.


"What's wrong?" Jonathan asked,concerned. "You don't look well."

Kathie shook her head. "I'm not sure. Just dizzy."

She'd noticed her vision blurring while driving but had attributed it to fatigue. Now she realized something was wrong.

Jonathan reached out to steady her and felt the heat radiating from her skin.


"You're burning up. Sit down," he said.

Kathie nodded and took two steps before the dizziness overwhelmed her.She collapsed.

"Kathie!"

Ignoring his own pain. Jonathan stood and carefully lifted her to the sofa.The children, hearing the commotion, came running. He quickly sat back down.


"What happened?" Kyle rushed forward.

Jonathan kept his voice calm. "Don't worry. Your mom has a fever-her body is fighting off an infection to make her healthier. Now,I need your help."

The children immediately stopped their tears and stood at attention.

"What should we do, Seven?" they asked in unison.

"Kyle, get the thermometer. Zachary, bring some lukewarm water. Eileen,fetch some towels."

The children scattered to their tasks. Jonathan had given them jobs partly to keep them from worrying. Thankfully, they had medicine at home.He'd treat her symptoms until she woke up, and if necessary, he'd call Ben to take her to the hospital.

Kyle returned with the thermometer. The fever wasn't dangerously high.
Jonathan propped Kathie against his chest to help her drink some water.Though semiconscious, she managed to swallow.

He placed a cool cloth on her forehead and massaged her pressure points as she had once taught him. He prepared her herbal remedy according to her own formula,ready for when she woke.

The three children gathered around like faithful puppies,watching their mother with worried eyes but staying quiet so as not to disturb her.

"You've all been amazing today," Jonathan reassured them. "You deserve a reward tomorrow. Don't worry-your mom will wake up soon."

Kyle's eyes glistened. "Seven,thank goodness you're here."

"Seven needs to stay withus forever," Eileen choked out.

Zachary nodded. "What would we do without you?"

Their words tugged at Jonathan's heart. "Don't worry. I'll be with you for life," he promised.

The children smiled at his words. He leaned close to Kathie's ear and whispered,"Be strong. Your children are waiting for you."

As if by magic, Kathie's eyes fluttered open at his words. A mother's strength came from her children.

'"Medicine," she murmured weakly.

"Right away." Jonathan fetched the remedy himself. not wanting the

children to risk getting burned.

He returned and helped her sit up, feeding her the medicine sip by sip.

Through her blurred vision, Kathie found Jonathan's face strangely familiar.His silhouette seemed to merge with her memory of the man she'd spent that passionate night with years ago. In her feverish state, she wished he could be the father of her children.

After she finished the medicine, Jonathan helped her lie down."Some doctor you are, not even noticing when you're sick."

Kathie had been too busy worrying about her mother's case and dealing with Randy and Shirley's drama to notice her own health failing.

With her strength slightly returning, she whispered, "I was careless. Thank you for being here."

Jonathan smiled confidently. "Now you see-it's not justthe children who need me. You need me too."

Perhaps it was the vulnerability of illness, but instead of her usual retort,Kathie simply nodded.

"You're right. I do need you," she replied softly.

Jonathan's eyes lit up. He pulled the children closer to her side and asked excitedly, "Say that again-just so you canI't deny it tomorrow when you're feeling better."
###Chapter 72 Just Be Together!

Kathie wasn't delirious-just feverish. In her weakened state, she was simply expressing her most genuine feelings. She knew exactly what she was saying.

She then couldn't help but smile. "I said I can't live without you."

Jonathan beamed. "The kids all heard that. You can't take it back now."

Kathie closed her eyes weakly and whispered, "What difference does it make if I can't take it back?"

Jonathan was speechless. Eileen quickly chimed in, "If you can't take it back, then you should be together! You're going to get married anyway."

Kyle nodded. "That's right. People who love each other should get married.



Zachary took his mom's hand. "We can be the flower children!"

Kathie coughed twice to interrupt them. At this rate, she'd be marrying Jonathan by tomorrow. She wasn't that feverish-she understood the gulf between them all too well.

Taking a deep breath to gather her strength, she said, "I have a fever and I'm contagious. You shouldn't be near me. Go backto your rooms and rest."

Kyle's face was full of concern. "But we want to stay and take care of you,Mom."

"I want to stay too," added Eileen, who was always reluctant to leave Kathie's side.

Kathie smiled gratefully. "I appreciate your thoughtfulness, but I'd feel terrible if you caught this. You have school tomorrow. Seven can look after me just fine. Kyle, be a goodI boy and take your brother and sister to bed."

Jonathan chimed in. "I'll take care of her. Go back to your rooms and get some sleep. Don't worry your mom. I promise she'll be her lively self by morning."

Kathie gazed tenderly at the children. Kyle, seeing that his mother was worried about them even while sick, didn't want to add to her concerns.

He took his siblings' hands. "We'll do as Mom says and go to bed now.Mom,please get better soon."

Zachary nodded. "We'll be good and go to sleep. Don't worry about us,Mom."

Though Eileen was reluctant to leave Kathie, she knew staying wouldn't help and had to obey. "I'll listen to my brother. Rest well, Mom."

Kathie felt a warmth in her heart. Her three treasures always,gave her endless strength, no matter the circumstances:

Jonathan escorted the children back to their rooms, then brought her a glass of water.

"You said earlier that you need to drink plenty of fluids when you have a fever. How are you feeling now?"he asked.

Kathie's breath was scorching hot. She hadn't expected to come down with a fever. Since Jonathan had entered her life, she seemed to fall ill more often.She wondered if he was bringing her bad luck.

"What are you thinking about? Drink up," he urged.

Kathie snapped back to reality, took the glass and drank it all. "I'm still a bit dizzy, but much better. I feel sticky all over though. I'd like to take a bath."

"Can you bathe while you have a fever?"

Kathie replied weakly, "Bathing helps reduce temperature,but I'm too weak to stand up."

Jonathan smiled. "That's easy. Leave it to me."

He went to run the bath. A few minutes later, he returned to find Kathie flushed pink, shifting uncomortably. Sometimes she'd tilt her head back to breathe,sometimes arch her chest, her elegant neck forming an enticing curve.


Seated in his wheelchair, his eyes were drawn to the soft contours of her figure, the gentle curve of her chest catching his attention. A flicker of desire stirred within him, unbidden but impossible to ignore. He swallowed hard, his throat suddenly dry, and cautiously moved closer,his emotions a mix of longing and restraint.

"Can you walk? If not, I can carry you," Jonathan asked.

Kathie,eyes half-closed and lips slightly parted, struggled to sit up.

"You're injured. I should manage on my own," she replied.

She carefully got out of bed, but as soon as her feet touched the floor,her body went limp. Just as she was about to fall, Jonathan quickly caught her in his arms.

Kathie looked surprised. "I didn't realize you were so strong."

Jonathan settled her on his lap and maneuvered his wheelchair, smiling confidently. "There's a lot you don't know about me."

Logically, an injured man shouldn't provide much security,yet Kathie felt completely safe in his care.

At the bathtub, Jonathan began to undress her. Kathie startled and clutched at her clothes.

"What are you doing? Taking advantage of me?"

Jonathan couldn't help but laugh. "Dr. Cavendish, surely you weren't planning to bathe in your clothes? You'll soak them."

Kathie's face reddened further. "Help me down and I can undress myself.You should leave."

Jonathan disagreed. "Why the formality now? When I passed out before,you were the one who changed my clothes. You've seen everything and I didn't mind."


"That was different-it was an emergency," Kathie protested,wondering how they'd gotten onto this topic.

"How is this different? I promised the kids I'd take care of you. What if I leave and you fall again? Let me help you undress."

"I said I don't need help."

Wherever his hands lingered, her skin burned with heat, and soon her entire body felt like it was on fire.

Jonathan quickly said, "Then I'll go wake up the children and have them help you."


He helped Kathie to the edge of the bathtub and turned as if to leave.

Kathie reluctantly called him back. "Fine, but close your eyes. No peeking."

Jonathan,his scheme successful, smiled. "Don't worry, I promise not to peek."

He extended his hands with his eyes closed, but touched something soft..Kathie slapped his hand away. "Keep your hands to yourself!"

Jonathan wasn't offended. "I can't see with my eyes closed. I don't know

what I'm touching."

Kathie took a deep breath. "Just support me,and I'll undress myself."

Jonathan nodded. "All right."

Kathie placed his hands on her waist for support, afraid she might get dizzy again when standing.

Touching her burning skin, Jonathan felt his own body heat rising. He heard her removing her clothes, felt her bending to take off her pants.Because she was weak, her waist twisted softly under his hands.

She reminded him of the woman he'd made passionate love to that night-her waist so flexible, accommodating any position.

Why did Kathie evoke these feelings? That familiar scent enveloped him,and he couldn't help but squint. Just then, Kathie bent to remove her underwear,her perfect breasts just inches away. He felt he could almost taste them with just a flick of his tongue.

The birthmark on her chest looked strikingly familiar-it was the only mark he'd noticed in the dim light that night. Why were they so similar?

Kathie exhaled with exhaustion, nearly breaking Jonathan's composure.

It took remarkable self-control to remain calm when the beast within was threatening to break free.

"Don't open your eyes. Now help me into the tub."

"Don't worry,I won't peek."

His hands trembled slightly. As Kathie moved, his handsinstinctively slid lower, touching her full, shapely thighs. He felt her body tense,knowing she too was pretending to be calm.

With some effort. he finally lowered her into the bathrub. The sweat on Jonathan's brow rivaled her own.


Kathie took a deep breath, finally free from Jonathan's large hands.If he had kept touching her, she felt like her body would have been consumed by heat.
###Chapter 73 She Takes Advantage of Him We Sick
Kathie wondered if the fever was making her feel unusually hot.When
Jonathan accidentally touched her bottom, she bit her lip to stay silent.
That tingling sensation spread through her body, leaving her feeling both ashamed and exhilarated.

Now they were both tense.

"You can leave now. I'll call you when I'm done," she said.

Jonathan hesitated. "It's dangerous to have a fever in the bath. I'd better stay in case something happens."

Kathie was touched by his thoughtfulness. "Alright then. Thank you."

Jonathan was indeed suffering-struggling to contain his desire for her.

"How about I give you a massage? It would help you feel better. You can cover yourself with a towel, and I won't see anything," he suggested.

"You're being suspiciously helpful. I think you have ulterior motives," she teased.

Jonathan smiled helplessly."What ulterior motives could I have? If you don't get better soon, who's going to treat me? And who'll take care of the kids?"

"So that's your concern," Kathie said,slightly disappointed that his care wasn't purely for her.

Jonathan mnentally kicked himself for the misunderstanding.

Kathie's body was indeed aching all over. A massage sounded wonderful.She covered herself with a towel. "Ready."

When Jonathan opened his eyes, he could see her long, straight legs even with the towel draped over her. As the water rippled, the towel slid.occasionaly revealing glimpses of her curves. It was a torturous test of his restraint as he soothed her back.

The phone in the bedroom rang. Jonathan brought it to her, and Kathie answered without checking who was calling.

"Kathie, are you lying to me? Randy says he won't divorce me," came Shirley's tearful voice.

Hearing Shirley cry irritated Kathie. "I'm definitely getting divorced. If he doesn't agree, I'll file myself. Stop bothering me." She hung up and tossed the phone aside, already annoyed before Shirley's interruption.

"You're really going through with the divorce?" Jonathan asked.

"Yes. Randyrefuses and is demanding $50 million in compensation. He's lost his mind."

Jonathan laughed incredulously. Usually men paid women alimony, not the other way around. The audacity!

"Let me help you handle this," he offered.

Kathie yawned. "Do whatever you want. I don't want to talk about it."

She closed her eyes contentedly. Having someone care for her so attentively felt nice. If Jonathan truly had amnesia and was still the Seven she knew, she would have kept him by her side without hesitation.The problem was that he was the head of the Berkeley Group, far beyond her reach.


Jonathan noticed she seemed to be falling asleep and worried she might have passed out. He whispered in her ear, "Kathie? Are you okay?"

"Feels nice," she murmured. "Don't disturb me... I want to sleep."

Jonathan's face softened with affection. After rinsing her off, he laid a bath towel across his lap, closed his eyes, and lifted her out. He wrapped her up and carried her back to the bedroom.

He gently placed her on the bed and covered her with blankets before removing the towel. Though he'd stolen a few glances, he maintained some gentlemanly restraint.

As Jonathan prepared to leave. Kathie suddenly grabbed his hand. "Don't go.I'm so cold."


Seeing her glazed eyes, Jonathan knew she wasn't thinking clearly. He couldn't take advantage of her in this state.

"Ill get you another blanket."

"Don't leave!" she insisted.

Jonathan felt her hand-it was indeed ice cold,despite her earlier fever.She must be having chills now.

Kathie felt the warmth of his hand and slowly moved closer, wrapping her arms around his neck. She tried to bring her face to his but was too weak,looking utterly pitiful in her attempt.

Jonathan sighed. "I'll stay and keep you warm, but tomorrow morning,don't accuse me of taking advantage of you."

He pulled back the covers, saw her naked body, and quickly covered her again. He found her pajamas and awkwardly helped her into them before lying down beside her.

Kathie wrapped her limbs around him, her hands caressing his body.Jonathan held his breath, struggling to keep his desires in check.

Moments later. Kathie slipped her hands under his shirt to warm them against his firm chest, a smile spreading across her face at the contact.Then, her hands began to roam freely over his body.

Jonathan couldn't help teasng, "Who would have thought the prim and proper Dr. Cavendish would take advantage of me while she's sick?"

Perhaps understanding his words, Kathie withdew her hands and simply nestled in his arms without further exploration.

Jonathan contentedly held Kathie close. Kathie was the one for him.

The next morning, as dawn broke, the three children rushed to Kathie's room. Opening the door to find Kathie and Jonathan embracing tightly,they quickly covered their eyes.

"Are Mommy and Seven going to have a little brother or sister for us?"Eileen asked excitedly.

Hearing her daughter's voice, Kathie's eyes flew open in shock. Seeing Jonathan beside her and their limbs entangled, she kicked him off the bed in panic.

Jonathan rolled across the floor before coming to a stop,groaning in pain."How could you be so heartless? I'm injured! Are you trying to kill me?"
Kathie,relieved to see she was clothed, demanded, "Why are you in my bed?"

Jonathan wished he'd recorded everything as evidence. "I suggest installing security cameras in the house so certain people can't deny what happened.Try to remember last night."

Kathie's mind was blank. Kyle reminded her, "Mommy had a fever last night. Seven took care of you."

"I saw Seven taking you to the bathroom when I got up to use the toilet."Zachary added.


Eileen chimed in, "And then you slept together."

It came back to Kathie-her fever, Jonathan caring for her, giving her a bath and massage. She remembered feeling comfortable, and then...Though she couldn't recall what happened next, she could guess she had asked him to stay.


Jonathan caught the look of guilt on her face and frowned. "What should you do now?"

Kathie quickly got out of bed to help him back into his wheelchair, full of apology. "I'm so sorry for being impulsive. Let me check if you're okay."

Jonathan waved her off in annoyance. "It's always the same-I'm the one who suffers."


"I'm sorry, it won't happen again."

Eileen took his hand. "Seven, please forgive Mommy this time. From now on,you can cuddle with her whenever you want."

Kathie blushed, that wasn't what she meant at all.

Jonathan sighed, unable to stay upset with her. "How are you feeling? Any better? If you're still unwell, take the day off. I've already asked Ben to take the kids to school."

Though still a bit dizzy, Kathie felt well enough to work. She'd already taken yesterday off, and people at the research institute were already grumbling. If she missed another day,who knew what they'd say.

'"I'm fine. Ben can just drop me at work too." Kathie said.

"I think you should rest another day." Kethrin cheea Sry hosd. Tt be fine. I khow how in eake care of meatr
###Chapter 74 Following a Powerful Backer Ha Many Benefits
The research institute already harbored ill feelings toward Kathie.
Countless eyes were watching her every move. After taking just one day off,rumors had started, and she knew skipping another workday would only
fuel more vicious gossip.

She appreciated Jonathan's concern but couldn't possibly miss work.

Jonathan felt helpless-he could hardly tie her down to keep her home.

"In your condition, you shouldn't be driving. I'll have Ben take you.If you feel unwell at all, comne back immediately," he insisted.

Kathie laughed. "Mr. Berkeley, you sound just like a fussing mother."

Jonathan was speechless.

Never in his life had he cared so deeply for a woman, despite countless others who would have cherished such attention. Yet this obstinate Kathie had the audacity to compare him to a nagging mother.

Seeing his wounded expression, Kathie patted his shoulder. "I appreciate your concern. I'll give Ben the new formula. You stay home, rest,take your medicine on schedule, and don't wander around-understood?"

Jonathan frowned,feeling their roles had somehow reversed.

By the door, Ben turned away to suppress his laughter. In all his years working for Jonathan, he'd never seen his boss look so disgruntled.

Jonathan shot him a cold glance. "Ben, I saw that smile. Consider your bonus canceled this month."

Ben, an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire, looked pleadingly at

Kathie-the only person who could handle Jonathan now.

"Don't take your frustration out on others," Kathie sighed. "Ben is here to drive us. How could we live with ourselves if he loses his bonus for helping us?"

Kathie signaled to her three children. Eileen approached Jonathan and took his large hand in her small one. "Seven is too kind to take away Ben's money. You're just joking, aren't you?"

Zachary joined in, "Seven is wonderful and helps us deal with bad people.He'd never really take Ben's money."

Kyle added, "I know Seven is just kidding, right?"

Jonathan gave Ben a meaningful smile. He was impressed-Ben had somehow won over all three children.

Kathie patted his shoulder again. "Better clarify quickly. What if Ben gets distracted thinking about his lost bonus while driving? You wouldn't want to make the children late for school."

Jonathan nodded reluctantly, gritting his teeth. "Ben is clever, knowing exactly where to find allies. They're right-I was only joking."

Ben smiled coolly. "I learned from Mr. Berkeley himself. Always good to have powerful protection."

Jonathan gave him a thumnbs up-his assistant was learning well.

Ben dropped the children at school before taking Kathie to the research institute.

Kathie wrote down detailed instructions for the new formula,concerned the men might botch the preparation process.

"Ben,you must follow these heating instructions precisely," she

emphasized.

"Don't worry, Dr. Cavendish. Your instructions are crystal clear. I've got this."


Kathie nodded, then reminded him to keep an eye on Jonathan,who needed proper rest.

As Ben dropped her at the institute entrance, Amelia arrived in her BMW.She was stunned to see Kathie stepping out of a limited-edition Maybach,chatting amicably with an attractive driver. Her mind immediately jumped to conclusions about how many men Kathie must be stringing along.

Amelia quickly snapped photos with her phone, eager to expose this supposedly high-minded Kathie for what she realy was.

After waving goodbye to Ben, Kathie turned and caught Amelia,staring at her with folded arms and a contemptuous expression.

Not wanting to engage, Kathie tried to walk past her, only to be blocked.

"WVith looks like yours, why even bother showing up to work?" Amelia sneered. "If I had your way with men, I'd be living in the lap of luxury by now."


Kathie gave her a withering look. "You're right. Too bad you weren't blessed with either looks or brains. Reminds me of that old saying..."

"What saying?" Amelia demanded coldly.

Kathie smiled sweetly. "The plainest faces hide the most vicious hearts.Not familiar with it? Perhaps you should read something besides the gossip columns."

Amelia's chest heaved with anger. "You'll regret this, Kathie."

"I'm ready whenever you are," Kathie retorted, pushing past her.She

couldn't fathom what she'd done to provoke such hostility from Amelia from day one.

Amelia glared at her retreating figure, determined to make her life miserable.

In the lab, Kathie immediately immersed herself in work, determined to catch up on what she'd missed.


She worked through the morning without even a water break, completing yesterday's tasks and preparing a data report for Henry's review.

Henry examined the results skeptically. "Dr. Cavendish, you've only worked half a day and you expect us to accept these figures? Do you think we're fools?"


Kathie frowned. "Dr. Stewart, as the data reviewer, shouldn't you read my experimental report before questioning its validity? Judging without examining seems rather unprofessional."

Henry slapped the report onto the table. "I asked you this morning-this is your first time conducting this experiment, correct?"

Kathie nodded. "Yes, it is. Is that a problem?"

Henry placed the report in front of her. "Our entire team spent a week generating this data. You claim to have done it in half a day. How could anyone believe that?"

"Dr.Stewart," Amelia smirked, "you have to understand-with so many wealthy patrons, she doesn't care about accurate data. She's just submitting something to look busy."

"Dr. Cavendish, this behavior is unacceptable. We had high expectations for you."

"This is a research institution, not a place for your games."

"If you can't handle this position. perhaps you should resign."

Others joined the chorus of criticism, none believing she could complete the task so quickly.

Kathie took a deep breath. "You've been prejudiced against me from day one. If you'd simply verify my results before condemning me, that would be fair. But you've already decided I couldn't possibly succeed."

Henry frowned. "Don't act like we're persecuting you. With ten years in medicine, I can confidently say this is impossible."

Kathie glared at him. "That only proves your limited expertise and careless review process. I refuse to work with such an unfair team."

She had only joined at Bradley's suggestion, but now faced with such closed-minded colleagues, she'd rather leave.

Her words were a direct insult to Henry's professional reputation.He silenced the rising murmurs.

"Since you claim we're unfair, let's settle this definitively. I'll review your experiment data right now, and we'll see if you still want to stay when I'm finished," Henry said.
###Chapter 75 Conquer Everyone with Ability
Kathie shot him a contemptuous look and spat out, "You'll only embarrass yourself. And when I'm proven right. I expect apologies fromall of you."

"Such arrogance! I can't wait to see you leave in tears," Henry refused to believe her data could be correct.

Kathie stood confidently, waiting for him to verify it himself.

Henry took her report and began reviewing it step by step. Initially,it seemed chaotic, but the further he went, the more astonishing it became.She had managed to turn things around at critical points. Though some data looked unusual, everything checked out.

Incredulous, he tried three times, each yielding identical results. Even the onlookers were stunned.

Had everyone not seen her working diligently in the lab all morning, they wouldn't have believed she produced this work.

"How is this possible? It tookus a week to compile this data, yet you finished in half a day," Henry asked.

"Because your thinking is constrained," Kathie replied. "You all used a single approach, while I integrated multiple methodologies from comprehensive medicine, combined with my own experience. I boldly tried several variations and succeeded."

Everyone was astounded. Since Kathie had arrived at the research institute,they had witnessed her genius-her abiity to name over a thousand medicinal herbs.

She could instantly recall rare medicinals that would take them ages to look up on computers, and knew their properties too. This was beyond ordinary capability.

"I apologize for being so dismissive. I was wrong," Henry admitted.Though he disliked Kathie's lifestyle, he genuinely respected her abilities.

He had promised to apologize if he wronged her.

Others followed suit. apologizing and inviting her to stay.

Kathie, not being petty, agreed to remain after seeing their sincere entreaties.


Amelia had assumed Kathie was just a pretty face without substance. Now,seeing everyone's admiring glances at this genuinely talented woman,she worried that if Kathie stayed longer, she would captivate all the male doctors.


Back in her office, Amelia quickly composed a message and posted it online.


Kathie explained her methodology to everyone, winning their admiration.

Feeling their respect, she swelled with pride.

That afternoon, as Kathie went to the front desk for documents, she noticed female doctors and nurses giving her strange looks.

"That's her-the doctor who had an affair and an illegitimate child while married."

"She is beautiful, I heard she has several wealthy benefactors."

"She doesn't even have medical credentials. How did she get into our research institute?"

Kathie found these comments jarring. Were they talking about her?

Not wanting to make a scene, she approached the receptionist for her documents, only to have them thrown onto the floor, as if the woman

feared contamination from touching her.

Coldly. Kathie said, "You dropped them. Pick them up."

The receptionist responded with disgust, "Everyone here knows about your sordid affairs. It's revolting. Just don't seduce any of our male doctors.



Kathie pulled out her phone sternly, "Repeat what you just said--and this goes for anyone who's been pointing fingers at me. If you can't substantiate these claims, I'll sue you all for defamation."

Undeterred, the receptionist handed her a phone, "See for yourself. Your admirer beating up your husband, you two embracing, and a man dropping you off in a luxury car this morning. Can you deny any of this?"

Another receptionist chimed in, "That's clearly you. And everyone knows about your illegitimate child. Are we all lying?"

Kathie's fine eyebrows knitted together, murderous rage boiling inside her.

She never cared what others said about her, but she wouldn't tolerate her three precious children being dragged into this.

These messages had been posted to the institute's group chat-no wonder everyone had seen them.

But since she wasn't in the group yet, she had been completely blindsided.

In the video, only Bradley's faee was obscured, suggesting the source wanted to protect him. And only Amelia had seen Ben drop her off that morning.

"Use your brains and don't be manipulated," Kathie said sharply."'Standing on the wrong side will cost you dearly. I'll document every statement you make, and you can prepare for legal action."

Not wanting to waste more time. Kathie picked up her documents and left.


Back in her office, everyone's expressions told her they had seen the posts.

Henry frowned. "Dr. Cavendish. I respect your abilities, but please mind your personal life. Your affairs have become the institute's gossip."

"Exactly," Amelia added. "Many female doctors oppose her presence here.Didn't she say she wanted to leave earlier? Let's just let her go."

Kathie walked straight to her, "You posted those videos and rumors, didn't you? You're interested in Bradley and saw us getting close,so you decided to slander me."

Everyone turned to Amelia in surprise. Her crush on Bradley wasn't a secret in their circle-could she really have defamed Kathie for this reason?

Amelia panicked and denied it vehemently, "Stop making things up!I know nothing about this."

"Nothing?" Kathie said coldly. "Then would you let me check your phone or computer? Wrongdoings always leave traces. If I'm falsely accusing you,I'll apologize publicly."

Amelia raised her chin, "Why should I let you check anything?"

"Because I'm certain you did it, and I need a public apology from you,"Kathie insisted. She had to teach her a lesson, or Amelia would only escalate her behavior.

Angrily, Amelia retorted, "Your inappropriate conduct is a fact.How is that my fault?"

Kathie clenched her fists, "I'Il say it one more time: let me check, or I'm calling the police."

As the standoff continued, Henry intervened, "Dr. Cavendish,please

handle personal matters after work. Our project is urgent-focus on that."

Kathie took a deep breath. Despite her anger, she couldn't waste valuable work time.


She glared at Amelia. This wasn't over.

Amelia sighed with relief. She hadn't expected Kathie to be so bold.Rushing back to her office, she deleted all evidence to ensure nothing could be traced back to her.

At Maple Grove Residence, Randy arrived after being summoned by his cousin. He couldn't understand why Jonathan wanted to see him, but he came as requested.

Ben met him at the entrance. Randy still couldn't comprehend why Jonathan, despite not truly having amnesia, would choose to live,in such a place-it was completely incongruous with his status.

Even confined to a wheelchair, Jonathan's presence commanded more authority than Randy's.

"Jonathan, what did you want to see me about?"

"Sit down."

Randy carefully took a seat. Seeing Jonathan drinking tea, he hurriedly refilled his cup and asked with feigned concern, "How are your injuries?"

Jonathan replied coldly, "I'll get straight to the point. I hear Kathie wants a divorce and you're refusing unless she pays compensation. You're publicly disgracing the Berkeley family name."
###Chapter 76 Jonathan Backs Her Up

Randy's expression darkened, though he forced a smile. "Why are you suddenly interested in my marriage?"


"I'm not interested," Jonathan replied coldly. "But I can't stand by and watch this. You're going to divorce her-immediately."

Randy studied him for a moment, as if piecing something together.

"Don't tell me you've fallen for her?" he sneered. "I've seen you picking up her children, and now you're living here. Imagine the headlines: 'The illustrious Mr. Berkeley coveting his own cousin's wife.' Quite the scandal,wouldn't you say?"

Jonathan laughed. "You think being in the Berkeley family tree gives you immunity? The last person who threatened me is still in prison. Care to join him?"

Randy's face darkened. "This is a private family matter. You shouldn't interfere."

Seeing Randy's resistance, Jonathan decided to apply pressure.

"Whether I should or shouldn't, I already am. If you don't agree, starting tomorrow, I'll revoke all your Berkeley family privileges-your shares,your position, your father's job, and that mansion you live in. All gifts from the Berkeley family."

"You'd crush your own family for her? I'm your blood."

"If I don't acknowledge you as family, you're nothing," Jonathan stated coldly. "Refuse me, and I won't just 'crush' you--I'll make sure you can't show your face in Eldoria again. Grandfather will back me. I'm the one in charge,after all."

The words seemed to suffocate Randy. Everything at Berkeley Enterprises did ultimately answer to Jonathan.


If stripped of these privileges, Randy would have to return to his old neighborhood and wwork an ordinary job. Having tasted wealth, he couldn't bear returning to a humble existence.


Despite his intense reluctance, he didn't dare refuse Jonathan.

"Fine," he muttered.

Jonathan smiled with satisfaction. "A wise choice. Sign the agreement,and my people will handle the rest. And stay away from her from now on."

Randy grudgingly signed his name, teeth clenched.

Kathie has found herseIf quite the protector,' he thought bitterly. 'Too bad her status will prevent her from ever marrying into the Berkeley family properly.

The family would never allow Jonathan, their leader, to marry his cousin's ex-wife. The people of Eldoria would laugh them.

Jonathan was feeling rather pleased with himself, imagining Kathie's gratitude when she returned that evening.

Just as Randy finished signing, his phone rang-his mother calling.

"Mom? What is it?" he answered, turning away.


"Randy, have you seen the news? That business with you and Kathie is the talk of Eldoria Hospital, and it's spreading everywhere."

He was genuinely confused. "What business?"

Kaitlyn exploded, "I told you to thank her, not reconcile with her! And now you're brawling in public? It's all over social media! Someone's even

claiming Kathie has multiple wealthy lovers. I think it's time to end this for good. We have a reputation to maintain. We don't need a woman like her in our family."


Randy suddenly understood-someone had twisted the incident where Bradley had attacked him. But who would spread such gossip?

"That's not what happened..." he began.

"I don't care what happened! Get back to the hospital immediately and finalize that divorce."

Randy started to explain, but glancing at the divorce agreement on the table. he realized further protest was pointless.

"I'm on my way," he replied, hanging up.

He caught Jonathan's questioning look.

"My mother says someone's spreading stories about Kathie and me online.She wants me to handle it right away."

What could possibly be said about him and Kathie?

"Then don't let me keep you," Jonathan replied.

Randy couldn't leave fast enough.

After he left, Jonathan drummed his fingers on the table and turned to Ben. "Find out what's happening."

Ben nodded and quickly checked his phone. His face went pale.

"Mr. Berkeley, this is outrageous! They've even dragged me into it-claiming I'm one of Dr. Cavendish's lovers." He scrolled further. "There's even a doctored photo of her kissing me under a tree! Who would create such malicious lies?"

Jonathan took the phone, his expression darkening with fury as he slammed his fist on the table. "Find who posted this. Now."

Ben immediately tasked the IT department with tracking down the source,emphasizing maximum urgency.

This wasn't just about Kathie's reputation-it was about Jonathan's as well.Judging by his expression, Jonathan was ready to destroy whoever was responsible.

Within ten minutes, the IT department delivered results.

"Mr. Berkeley," Ben reported, "the posts came from Amelia, daughter of the Saint Charles Memorial Hospital Deputy Director. She's also on the research project team. She's apparently pursued Bradley multiple times and been rejected. Interestingly, Bradley's face is obscured in all the videos.



Jonathan's eyes narrowed with cold anger. "Alan's daughter? Isn't Alan the leading candidate to replace the retiring hospital director?"

As a board member, Jonathan was thoroughly familiar with all internal affairs.


Ben nodded. "Correct. He was the director's student and has considerable influence there."


Jonathan smiled icily. "If this is the daughter he's raised, it speaks volumes about his character. Issue the order: Alan is to be removed from consideration for the position."

Ben understood perfectly. "Consider it done."

Anyone who crossed Dr. Cavendish was clearly facing Jonathan's wrath.

When Ben returned from making the call,Jonathan handed him a list.


Ben looked concerned. "Mr. Berkeley, you don't expect me to cook all this.do you?"


Jonathan rolled his eyes. "Don't be ridiculous. Call the housekeeper to prepare everything, then deliver it to Kathie.She was feverish yesterday and needs proper nutrition to recover."

"How thoughtful of you, Mr. Berkeley. I'll arrange it immediately."

Ben had never seen Jonathan so concerned about a woman before. Despite the social gap between them, he secretly hoped Jonathan and Kathie might somehow end up together.

After Ben left, Jonathan felt the emptiness of the house acutely. It had only been a few hours, but he already missed Kathie and her son. He was beginning to realize that he was the one who couldn't bear to be without them.

At the reseach institute, Kathie had just finished a long day and was heading to the cafeteria, starving, when a delivery person appeared."Dr.Cavendish? Delivery from Mr. Cooper."

Kathie looked puzzled. "Which Mr. Cooper? And how did you know who I am?"

The delivery person smiled and held up his phone. Ben was on a video call, waving at her. "Dr. Cavendish, Mr. Berkeley had his housekeeper prepare this nutritious meal for you. I'll come back to pick you up after you've eaten."

"That's so thoughtful of you."

"All Mr. Berkeley's idea. You should thank him."

So that explained how the delivery person had identified her.

"I'll see you soon,then."

Kathie felt a warm glow of appreciation for everything Jonathan was doing for her.
###Chapter 77 The Way of Repaying Kindness Really Special
After dinner, Ben arrived with Kathie's three children to pick her up. To avoid further gossip, he had deliberately parked across the street from the research center.


As Kathie got into the car, they exchanged awkward smiles, neither having imagined they would become the subject of rumors.

"Dr. Cavendish, I'm so sorry about this situation," Ben said.

"I should be the one apologizing," Kathie replied. "You were just being kind by giving me rides. and now you've been dragged into this mess."

Ben smiled graciously. "I'm not worried about myself-I just hope it doesn t cause you any more trouble."

"Don't worry, I'll resolve this quickly." Kathie assured him, determined to make Amelia set the record straight. The way people at the research center had been looking at her today made her uncomfortable.If these rumors spread throughout Eldoria, they could affect her children as well.

Kyle piped up from the backseat. "Mommy, what are you talking about?"

Kathie ruffled his hair. "Just grown-up business, sweetheart. Nothing for you to worry about."

"Why did Ben park so far away today?" Zachary asked curiously.

"Mommy's been sitting in her office all day," Kathie explained gently."I asked Ben to park a littlefurther so I could stretch my legs."

Eileen joined in. "Why were you both apologizing to each other?"

Kathie pulled her daughter close."Because Ben works so hard-he has his

own job and still makes time to drive us around. I feel bad for adding to his workload."


"Exactly," Ben confirmed, playing along.

The children immediately began massaging Kathie's shoulders. "You collapsed from exhaustion yesterday. You need to rest. We brought you some treats."


Kyle pulled milk from his backpack, Zachary offered cookies, and Eileen placed her favorite lollipop in Kathie's hand.

Kathie felt a wave of emotion. "Thank you,my darlings. With you three around,I never feel tired."


Despite hating Shirley for the schemes that had destroyed her reputation years ago, Kathie never regretted giving birth to her beautiful,children.Even if she could never find their biological father, she was content to raise them on her own.

When they arrived at Maple Grove Residence, Kathie watched her children race toward Jonathan,giving her a sense of home.

"Seven,did you miss me?" Eileen asked.

"Of course I did. I missed Kyle and Zachary too," Jonathan replied,showing no favoritism.

He glanced at Kathie with a mysterious smile that made her raise an eyebrow. "What's that smile about? It's rather suspicious."

Jonathan's grin widened. "I have a surprise for you. Come with me to the bedroom."

Kathie followed him with trepidation, wondering if this was payback for her pushing him off the bed that morning.Though she doubted he would

risk antagonizing her while his health was in her hands.

Once inside, Jonathan closed the door, making Kathie even more suspicious.

"Why are you closing the door? Is this surprise so secret?"

Jonathan teased,"What harm could I possibly do? I can't even stand."

"You're capable of plenty," Kathie muttered under her breath.

He leaned closer. "What was that, Dr. Cavendish?"

Kathie straightened up, looking around the room. "Nothing. So where's this surprise?"

"I promise you'll be thrilled when you seeit."Jonathan said confidently.

Kathie's curiosity grew until Jonathan placed divorce papers in front of her.She stared in disbelief at Randy's signature and the official stamp. They were actually divorced,


"Seven, is this real?" she asked, instinctively using the nickname she saved for moments of happiness.

Jonathan smiled,never having asked her to stop calling him that."It's all there in black and white, complete with the official seal. Couldn't fake it if I tried."


Overwhelmed with joy. Kathie threw her arms around him. "This is wonderful! Thank you, Seven. You've solved such a huge problem for me."

She had been dreading the lengthy legal process of divorce. Now that hurdle was cleared.

Jonathan returned her embrace, his hands settlingat her waist."How do you plan to thank me?"
l

Kathie quickly pulled away as she realized how close they were. "I could give you a few extra acupuncture treatments. Maybe throw in some special medicinal herbs. How does that sound?"

Jonathan laughed. "Leave it to a doctor to show gratitude through more medical procedures."

"I'm in such a good mood, I'll cook dinner for you myself," Kathie offered sincerely.

Jonathan caught her hand. "You've had a long day-don't worry about cooking. Patricia has sent over a housekeeper who seems quite competent.I think we shoud keep her. You're working, caring for three children, and now dealing with me as a patient. You literally collapsed yesterday."

Even if Patricia hadn't sent someone.Jonathan had planned to hire help.He couldn't bear watching Kathie exhaust herself every day.

In the past, Kathie might have refused his kindness, but she recognized the logic in his suggestion. With her career, the children, and now a patient at home, she needed assistance.

"You're right. Please thank her for her thoughtfulness."

"By the way," Jonathan added, "that medicine Ben prepared today was absolutely vile,but I drank every drop. Don't I deserve some reward?"

Kathie laughed. "You're the patient-taking medicine is what you're supposed to do. Should I give you a gold star for good behavior?"

Jonathan took her hand,causing Kathie to freeze momentarily before pulling away.

"You can talk without touching.," she said firmly.

"You're divorced now-officially single. That means I can pursue you

properly."

Kathie's eyes widened. "What exactly are you saying?"

"Figure it out yourself," hesaid with a smirk. "Also, you kicked me off the bed this morning, which aggravated my injuries. And with Ben goneall afternoon. I've been holding my bladder for hours. Help me to the bathroom,please?"

"You poor thing. Let me help you," Kathie said, pushing his wheelchair toward the bathroom. She helped him stand, unfastened his pants, and quickly turned her head away.

Jonathan suppressed a smile. "I'd like to take a bath too."

"Tll ask the housekeeper to help you with that."

Jonathan grabbed her arm, his expression serious. "I asked for a housekeeper to improve our quality of life, not to handle intimate matters.I'd prefer your help-you're experienced with my condition. If she's not careful, I might fall again, and you'd end up taking care of me anyway."

Kathie shook her head with a smile. "You always have an answer for everything."

Despite her protests, she was already running the bath. When the tub wvas filled,she carefully tested the water temperature before helping him in.

Jonathan rested his head against her knee,grinning up at her. "Would you be so kind as to wash my hair?"

"Of course," Kathie nodded. "Apparently my job description now includes being your personal attendant."

Looking up at her, Jonathan admired how her blouse strained slightly across her chest. Her long eyelashes fluttered like delicate butterflies, each

movement seemingly finding its way into his heart.

He had made his decision: he would pursue Kathie aggressively.planning to win her over within a month. Then they could explore all the possibilities between them.


As Jonathan's thoughts wandered, a mischievous smile spread across his face,earning him a playful tap from Kathie.
###Chapter 78 At Her Beck and Call

"Why are you grinning like that? Are you thinking something naughty?"Katie asked,gripping Jonathan's hair as she washed it.

Jonathan opened his dreamy eyes and stared directly at her, making Katie s heart flutter. She quickly covered his eyes with bubbles.

Jonathan yelped. "Did you get soap in your eyes again?"

Katie immediately rinsed it away with water. "That's what happens when you stare. Keep your thoughts appropriate, or you'll regret it."

Katie really had no sense of romance.

"Did you have to be so harsh?" Jonathan protested.

"Then behave yourself, or tomorrow I'll have the housekeeper wash your hair instead."

Hearing her stern tone, Jonathan knew she meant business. He lay still, not daring to move again.

Feeling the gentle pressure of her fingers and inhaling the bathroom's fragrance,Jonathan smiled contentedly.

"This is nice," he murmured.

Katie paused, wondering what he was thinking.

The next day, Jonathan joined them in the car. He was heading back to the office to handle some business matters.

The three children couldn't have been happier in the car,acting as if their parents were taking them to school.

"This is awesome! Seven can take us to school," Eileen said, holding his

hand.

"Can Seven pick us up after school too?" Zachary asked excitedly.

Kyle thought for a moment before saying. "It feels like having Mom and Dad around."


The car fell silent. It was clear the children longed for a father figure.

Jonathan cleared his throat to break the awkward silence. "I don't have much to do today. Once I'm finished, Ben and I will pick you up. If we're early,how about we go have some fun before heading home?"

The children cheered, "Seven is the best!"

Katie gave him a look. "Don't just focus on having fun. Remember,absolutely no walking, and you must take the medicine I prepared for you.
"

Jonathan frowned slightly. She certainly knew how to ruin the mood when they were having such a good time.

"If I find out you've been secretly exercising, you'll be in trouble when we get home," Katie said sternly.

Ben caught Jonathan's submissive expression in the rearview mirror and fought back a smile. At Berkeley Family, no one dared speak to him like that.Only Katie could keep him in line.

If Jonathan and Katie ever got married, Jonathan would definitely be wrapped around his wife's finger.

After dropping the children at school, Ben drove Katie to the research institute.

As Katie stepped out of the car, she noticed the strange looks from her colleagues, This recent incident had significantly affected her reputation.


She probably couldn't stay here much longer.

Taking a deep breath as she prepared to enter, someone called out to her.

She turned to see Bradley standing behind her. "Bradley, what brings you here?" she asked.


"I came to pick up some documents, and to apologize. I heard about the rumors. I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've caused you."

Even with his face blurred in those videos. Bradley had recognized himself.
Furious after discovering Amelia was behind it, he'd come to confront her but didn't want to worry Katie,hence the excuse about documents.Seeing Katie hesitating at the entrance, he knew the incident had taken its toll on
her.

Katie forced a smile. "It's not your fault. You were just standing up for me.At least it didn't affect you."

She would have felt even more guilty if Bradley had been dragged into the mess.

"Don't worry, I'll make sure this is resolved," he assured her.

"You'd better not get involved, or else..."

"Bradley, you're here!" Katie was interrupted by Amelia's voice. Having just arrived, Amelia had spotted Bradley at the entrance and approached with a bright smile.

Bradley showed no warmth toward her, fixing her with a cold stare."Dr.Griffin,you uploaded those rumors about Katie, didn't you?"

Amelia froze but quickly denied it. "What are you talking about? I don't understand."

Bradley said gravely, "I strongly suggest you explain the truth to everyone,

or T'll take legal action against you."

Amelia hadn't expected him to investigate. She assumed Katie must have gone to him.


"I really didn't do anything. You're misunderstanding me," she insisted.

Katie stepped forward. "The truth will out!"

Amelia pushed past her. "I don't know what you're talking about. I have to go." She hurried away, determined not to let Katie remain at the institute.


Bradley called after Amelia, "I'm giving you one day to apologize publicly,or you'll face the consequences!"

Amelia thought, 'Damn! What did Katie do to have all these men wrapped around her finger?'

With people already watching Katie, now everyone's attention was focused on her.


Katie sighed, wishing she could disappear into the ground from embarrassment.

"Bradley,you should go now. I need to get to work."

Bradley nodded. "Keep your chin up. I'll help you through this."

Katie smiled awkwardly, not really wanting his intervention.

In the laboratory, Katie felt everyone avoiding her,which hurt.

Amelía made a snide remark, "If I were you, I'd be too ashamed to show my face here. Even with your skills, poor character isn't welcome in our research institute."

Henry said irritably. "Dr. Cavendish, I warned you yesterday about your personal conduct. Now everyone's talking about you, and our project team has become a laughingstock."


Katie frowned but remained silent.

Amelia pushed further, "Dr. Stewart, why not just let her go? She's only embarrassing us by staying."

Katie shot her a piercing look. "I wouldn't deign to work with people like you anyway. Instead of gossiping aboutothers, you should focus on your tasks. If you fail to complete them, you'll be the ones disgracing our country."

"Then leave! No one's begging you to stay," Amelia said, hoping to push her out.


Katie nodded firmly. "Don't worry, I will-after I complete this data set.
Even if you beg me to stay afterward, I won't."

Henry frowned slightly. Though he disliked Katie's attitude, her exceptional abilities consistently solved problems faster than anyone else.With her on the team, the project would progress swiftly, likely winning awards.


But her issues were too troublesome. If she left, he wouldn't stop her. The project could still succeed without her.

"Don't be overconfident," Henry said coldly. "Don't make promises you can't keep, or you'll regret it later."

Katie glared at him. "I know you dislike me, and I certainly don't like you either. Always finding fault with me-I stand by my word, and I don't .need your reminders."

"You don't recognize good intentions," Henry replied. He was actually

warning her not to speak so definitively, lest she change her mind about leaving later.

Katie didn't need his concern. If he wanted her to stay, it was only because he valued what she could contribute.
###Chapter 79 Jonathan Stands Up for Her

In the executive office of the Berkeley Group. Jonathan was handling company documents when Ben knocked on his door.

"Mr. Berkeley, Alan is here," Ben announced.

Jonathan smiled. "That was quick. Send him in."

Ben escorted Alan into the office. "Mr. Berkeley, I apologize for disturbing you." Alan said respectfully. "I wanted to ask why you removed my name from the hospital director candidates list?"

He had been absolutely certain of securing this position, but now Jonathan directly canceled it for him.

The key issue was that he didn't even know what he had done wrong, so he came over specifically to get a clear explanation.

Jonathan set down his pen calmly. "It's simple. Your family shows poor character,which reflects on your upbringing. I can't entrust someone like you with such an important position."

Alan looked confused. "Could you please be more specific?"

Jonathan fixed him with an intimidating stare. "You've heard about the recent incidents at the research institute, haven't you?"

"I'm not sure what that has to do with me," Alan replied.

"Perhaps you should ask your daughter why she's been spreading malicious rumors about Katie," Jonathan said coldly. "She's my doctor and she saved my life. I won't tolerate anyone mistreating her."

·Alan's eyes widened. "Are you suggesting my daughter is behind this?Surely she wouldn't be so foolish."

"Do you think I'm making false accusations? Why don't you ask her yourself?"


Alan grew visibly nervous. If his daughter was responsible, his career was in serious trouble.


"Tll investigate immediately. Mr. Berkeley. If she's involved, I'll make it right."

Jonathan continued,"Dr. Cavendish is a woman of integrity. She's divorced,and regarding her alleged pursuer-you just met my assistant. He was simply driving her to work when your daughter fabricated stories about themn. Congratulations on your excellent parenting, Alan."

Alan was sweating profusely. "I promise I'll resolve this to your satisfaction."

Jonathan dismissed him with a wave. "See that you do. If this isn't handled properly, your career ends here."

Alan nodded repeatedly before leaving anxiously.

Back at his office, Alan immediately summoned Amelia. When she arrived,she greeted him affectionately. "Dad, why did you call me? Good news?"

Alan pushed her away. "You fool! Do you realize what you've done?"

Amelia was shocked by her father's uncharacteristic anger. "Dad, why are you so upset with me?"

Alan raised his hand to slap her but stopped himself. "I should do more than yell at you. Did you spread those rumors about Katie?"

"Dad, why do you suddenly care about this? Do you have something going on with her? What would Mom think?"

This time Alan couldn't restrain himself. He slapped her across the face.

Amelia held her cheek in disbelief. "You've never hit me before, and now you're doing it for that woman?"

"You idiot! You're destroying us both! Do you know who Katie's patron is?Jonathan Berkeley! He's on the hospital board and has shares in the research institute. Are you trying to ruin our family?"

Amelia's eyes widened. "Jonathan is protecting her?"

"Yes, and after learning about this, he immediately removed me from consideration for the director position. Do you know how hard I've worked for that opportunity?You've ruined everything!"

Amelia knew exactly who Jonathan was-the most powerful mån in Eldoria.


"He said Dr. Cavendish saved his life," Alan continued. "If we don't make this right. our careers are finished."

"We can't let that happen after everything we've worked for," Amelia said.

"Then you need to apologize-beg on your knees if necessary. Make her forgive you, or you're no longer my daughter."

Alan normally spoiled his daughter, but when his career was threatened,family loyalty took a backseat.

Amelia clenched her jaw. She despised Katie and had worked hard to drive her away. Having to publicly apologize felt like trampling on her own dignity.

"Dad,I can't do it."

"If you can't, I'll cancel all your credit cards and disown you.Your choice."

Hearing this, Amelia panicked. She knew without her father's protection,she was nothing.

"Fine, T'll do it."

"Do it immediately."

At the research institute, Katie was focused on her experiment when a female colleague passed by and said, "I'm sorry."

Katie was confused. Even Henry was looking at her apologetically. She didn't understand what was happening.

Soon her phone buzzed with a notification. It was a public apology from Amelia: [I, Amelia, hereby publicly apologize to Ms. Cavendish. The rumors circulating at the research institute were fabricated by me out of jealousy when I saw her with a man I was interested in. I spread false information and insulted her children. I deeply regret my actions and beg for her forgiveness.]

Katie read it twice, confirming it was indeed from Amelia's account. The research institute had also issued an official statement condemning Amelia's behavior.


Katie couldn't understand this sudden change of heart. Just this morning,Amelia had been arrogant and dismissive. Had Bradley intervened on her behalf?


While Katie was still pondering this, Amelia appeared before her and bowed deeply in front of everyone. "Dr. Cavendish, I'm sorry. I sincerely apologize for everything I've done to you."

Katie looked perplexed. "Dr. Griffin, thisis quite a sudden change. Did something happen?"

Inwardly, Amelia was seething., 'She's playing innocent. She knows exactly what happened. I underestimated her-I had no idea her connections were so powerful.
###Chapter 80 Jonathan is Blinded by Love

Amelia forced a smile, attempting to appear sincere. "I've truly realized my mistake and how much trouble I've caused you. I sincerely apologize-can you forgive me?"

Kathie didn't believe a word of it. A spoiled, entitled socialite like Amelía would never humble herself like this unless something serious was at stake.

Kathie frown. "You're not playing some kind of trick, are you?"

Amelia replied, "To prove my sincerity. I've decided to withdraw from the project team."

This announcement drew surprised glances from everyone,especially Henry. He couldn't fathom what leverage Kathie had used to not only extract a public apology from the notoriously arrogant Amelia but also convince her to abandon such a crucial project.

Even Kathie was taken aback by this extreme gesture. "You don't need to withdraw. I was actually preparing to leave myself."

"You absolutely cannot go!" Amelia exclaimed passionately. "This was entirely my fault for causing you distress. I should be the one to leave.Someone with your expertise belongs on this project-I'm sure everyone here would hate to lose you."

She knew that if Kathie left, Jonathan would blame her,potentially removing Amelia's father from his position. Without his protection, her own career as an unqualified doctor would evaporate. As long as Kathie stayed,Amelia could withdraw from the project without losing her social standing.

-"Just take the win," Henry said impatiently. "Amelia has already gone above and beyond."

Kathie rolled her eyes. Of course he'd say that-he wasn't the one affected by any of this.

"Fine. I accept your apology."

Amelia sighed with relief. "Thank you, Dr. Cavendish. I'll go pack my things immediately. I wish you all success with the project."

Something didn't feel right. People rarely changed so dramatically-Amelia's character transformation seemed implausible. Could Bradley really have this much influence over her?

Later, Kathie followed Amelia to her office and asked curiously, "Dr.Griffin,would you mind telling me who put you up to this?"

Amelia gave her a contemptuous smile. "Are you joking, Dr. Cavendish, or do you genuinely not know?"

"If I knew, I wouldn't be asking."

"It was Mr. Berkeley. He threatened my father that if I didn't publicly apologize to you and ensure you stayed on the project, he'd make sure neither of us couldI remain in Eldoria. Are you satisfied now?"

Amelia stormed past her, seething with resentment. In all her life,she'd never been so humiliated. If not for Jonathan's intervention, she would never have apologized to Kathie.

Kathie was completely stunned that Jonathan had been helping her behind the scenes. He'd repeatedly come to her aid without ever taking credit.

Was he playing the anonymous hero?

The realization of everything he'd done for her sent warmth flooding through her chest. The walls around her heart seemed to be slowly opening for him.

She took out her phone and called him.

When Jonathan saw her number, he couldn't help but smile.

"Dr. Cavendish, to what do I owe the pleasure?"

"Thank you for helping resolve that gossip situation," Kathie said softly.

"It was nothing. Just try to be gentler next time you get angry," Jonathan replied, deliberately not mentioning his intervention to spare her any sense of obligation.

Kathie felt genuinelý grateful. "I'll remember this debt and repay you someday."


Jonathan laughed. "You might need a notebook then, because there will be more such favors in the future."

His meaning was clear-whenever Kathie faced difficulties, he woul there to help.

"Seven, I'm so glad to have you in my life. Remember not to move around too much and get plenty of rest. Don't overexert yourself. Your injuries will heal soon enough."

"Of course. I'll do exactly as you say."


After hanging up, Jonathan's smile stretched almost ear to ear.Ben couldn't help thinking that his boss was falling deeply in love.

"Mr.Berkeley, we should leave soon to meet Austin Roberts at the airport.Should we..." Ben asked.

"That won't be necessar. Have someone escort them to the hotel, and I'll meet them there later. Dr. Cavendish advised me to rest more, and I need to follow doctor's orders."

Ben was astonished. Since when had Jonathan become someone whose head was turned by love? He was actually following Kathie's instructions to the letter.

He replied, "Understood. I'll make the arrangements immediately."

Meanwhile at the research institute, Henry received an urgent call from the hospital. A critical patient had fallen into a coma and needed immediate surgery. However, due to the patient's advanced age and having been transferred from another hospital, the risk factors were extremely high.With the family being emotionally volatile, no doctor dared to perform the operation.


Henry was troubled. Such a high-difficulty procedure required collaboration with a supremely skilled surgeon, and he wasn't sure where to find one on short notice.

Kathie quietly raised her hand. "Dr. Stewart, I couldn't help overhearing your call. I'd be happy to assist you."

In the past, Henry would have been skeptical, but after working with her for several days, he'd come to recognize Kathie's exceptional abilities.

Henry said, "Let's go then. You can assist me. As it happens, this patient's condition aligns with our research direction and could provide valuable reference data."


Half an hour later, they arrived at the hospital. The patient was in the late stages of cancer with metastasis. Given his advanced age and deteriorating organ function, no other hospital had been willing to operate. If they didn't intervene now, the elderly man wouldcertainly die.

Henry had felt confident before arriving, but upon learning the full details,'his resolve wavered. The situation was far worse than anticipated-he estimated less than a 40% chance of success.

The family members were creating a scene outside, accusing the doctors of inaction. If the patient died here, Henry's reputation would be damaged,yet he hesitated to proceed without confidence.

Sensing his reluctance, Kathie volunteered. "Dr. Stewart, let me lead the surgery."


Henry's eyes widened in alarm. "I know you're brilliant, but this isn't like analyzing data. One small mistake and he won't leave the operating table alive."


"His current condition is practically equivalent to death," Kathie replied calmly. "We might as well take the chance. If anything goes wrong,you can place the responsibility entirely on me."

Henry frowned. "Are you genuinely confident?"

Kathie nodded with certainty. "I never fight battles I can't win. I can save him."

With thepatient already unconscious and time running out, Henry reluctantly agreed to let her take the lead. He was curious to see if Kathie truly possessed the skill to snatch someone from death's grasp.

In the operating room, Kathie began by using acupuncture needles to stabilize the patient's heart-a technique Henry had never witnessed before.

Soon after, she commencedthe surgery with Henry assisting. Watching her confident gaze, precise incisions, and flawless technique, Henry noticed something extraordinary about her-a quality he'd never observed in other surgeons,emanating from this woman he had previously underestimated.

For three solid hours, Kathie's hands remained perfectly steady,,completing the procedure with remarkable precision before finally handing over the suturing to Henry.

Henry, now acting almost like an admiring apprentice. eagerly performed tasks he would normally delegate to assistants, marveling at Kathie's extraordinary surgical prowess.

"Dr. Cavendish,you've truly astonished me," he remarked in awe.
###Chapter 81 Ever the Money-Grabber

Kathie rubbed her sore arm. "I've always said you should focus on medicine rather than gossip. Trust what your eyes see, not what your ears hear."

Henry paused, reflecting on his previous attitude toward her based on mere rumors. A pang of guilt washed over him.

"I owe you an apology for my past behavior."

"Consider it accepted," Kathie replied casually, waving her hand.She'd never dwelled on such matters and certainly didn't hold it against him.

Henry felt uncomfortable-compared to her magnanimity, his own mindset seemed petty.

His gaze fell on the acupuncture needles in the patient's body, triggering a realization.

"I've heard that Miracle Doctor uses these exact needle techniques to save patients-techniques that only she knows. How did you learn them? Are you actually the Miracle Doctor?" he asked.

"I'm hardly the Miracle Doctor," Kathie replied. "I simply learned a few techniques from my mentor. Please keep this between us to avoid misunderstandings. And since this success will boost your hospital's reputation, let's say you performed the surgery."

"That's completely unacceptable. I don't take credit for others' work."

Kathie smiled warmly. "When it comes to saving lives, does it really matter whose name is attached?"

Without waiting for his response, she left to share the good news with the family.

Henry watched her go, marveling at how easily she gave away recognition that others would fight desperately to claim.

Who was she, really? He found her increasingly enigmatic.

The patient's life was savedI and he was sent to the intensive care unit for observation. The family was extremely grateful to Henry and regarded him as their savior.

Henry didn't explain further. He knew he owed this debt of gratitude to Kathie, and he would repay it to her.

At the Berkeley Group headquarters, Jonathan was preparing to leave for the hotel when Ben rushed into the office, visibly distressed.

"Mr. Berkeley, we have a situation. The Roberts couple didn't go to our arranged hotel after landing-they went directly to Silverbrookinstead."

Jonathan raised an eyebrow. "What business do they have in Silverbrook?"

"Mr. Roberts' secretary says they're suspending our partnership," Ben explained anxiously. "They're evaluating a project in Silverbrook, and if satisfied, they plan to collaborate with the Campbell Family instead."

Jonathan's expression hardened. This was a major client he'd spent over six months securing. "Did they explain why?"

"According to the secretary, Flynn Campbell, the Campbell Group's CEO,offered them a rate one percentage point lower than ours, while guaranteeing superior quality. Mr. Roberts is apparently quite impressed."

Jonathan frowned. "The Campbell Family isn't stupid. The price I offered was already the lowest in the country-cutting it by another point would eliminate any profit."

"The Campbells aren't after immediate profits," Ben said urgently. "They're

looking at long-term partnerships. Mr. Roberts represents foreign investors-if he switches to the Campbell Family, it could trigger a domino effect with other clients."

"Someone's deliberately sabotaging me," Jonathan said coldly.

"Exactly. And the Campbell Family somehow knows our bottom-line pricing, which is why they dared to undercut us. This is extremely concerning."

"Clearlythe work of whoever wants me gone," Jonathan mused.

"What's our next move?" Ben asked anxiously. If this situation wasn't handled properly, Jonathan's position as CEO could be at risk.

After a moment's thought, Jonathan decided, "Prepare for an immediate trip to Silverbrook. I must stop them from collaborating before they meet."

Austin's reluctance to face him suggested some lingering guilt-Jonathan was determined to salvage the partnership by any means necessary.


Ben nodded, then glanced worriedly at Jonathan's leg. "But-sir, your leg requiresdaily treatment."

"Simple solution-I'll bring Dr. Cavendish with us."

As he finished speaking, he had already dialed Henry's number.Henry was the head of the research project, so getting leave approved through him would suffice.

After listening to the explanation, Henry felt a headache coming on. "Give her a few days off? Couldn't you find a local doctor instead?"

Jonathan responded impatiently, "This is urgent. I don't have time to look for another doctor. She knows my condition best. I'm already on my way.so just have her come out."

"Fine. I'll go get her and give her some instructions." Henry replied.

Henry found himself puzzled by his own reaction-why did the news of Kathie's departure make him feel so uncomfortable?

The project wouldn't fall apart without her, but he had to admit that whenever Kathie was present, every experiment seemed to run more smoothly. It was only at this moment that he realized he had actually grown dependent on Kathie.

When Kathie received the unexpected summons, she was baffled."He wants me to go on a business trip with him? What's this about?"

"I'm not entirely sure," Henry admitted. "He seemed quite urgent about it.He should be arriving any minute. Just keep up with the project updates I'Il send to the group chat."

Kathie nodded. "Okay."

Minutes later, Jonathan's car pulled up. Seeing his grave expression, Kathie immediately sensed something serious had occurred.

"Where are we going, and for how long?"

"About three days," Jonathan replied.

"Three days?" Kathie exclaimed. "That's impossible! What about my children? They've never been separated from me since birth."

"Ben will stay behind to look after them, along with the household staff.They'll be fine," Jonathan assured her.

Kathie shook her head firmly. "That's not the point. They're not accustomed to my absence, and I'd be worried the entire time.If you need a doctor, someone of your stature can easily find one- there's no reason it has to be me."

"Name your price," Jonathan offered.

"This isn't about money. My children need me-I'm not going."

As Jonathan frowned. Ben stepped in to explain, "Dr. Cavendish,Mr.Berkeley's largest business partner is being poached through underhanded means. If we can't salvage this relationship, Mr. Berkeley's position will be jeopardized, potentially triggering a major crisis for the entire Berkeley Group. The family would likely force him to relinquish control. You understand his medical situation best-interrupting his treatment could have serious consequences. Please, after all he's done for you, consider helping him this once."

Understanding the gravity of the situation, and seeing Jonathan's uncharacteristicallydejected demeanor, Kathie felt her resistance wavering.

Ben pressed on, "I swear on my life to take excellent cáre of your three little ones until you return."

Faced with such an earnest plea, Kathie couldn't refuse.

"Alright then. I'm entrusting my children to you. Call me on video when they return from school so I can explain the situation to them."

"Thank you, Dr. Cavendish," Ben said gratefully.

Jonathan looked at her with profound appreciation. In his current condition, he needed assistance with daily activities. While Ben could help,he wasn't a medical professional-Jonathan needed someone with expertise he could trust, and that person was Kathie.

Kathie smiled. "We're helping each other here."

After Ben exited the car at a corner, arranging for two bodyguards to escort them, they continued their journey.

With a playful smile. Kathie asked. "Does your name your price' offer still stand?"

Jonathan couldn't help but laugh. "You're still as money-minded as ever."
###Chapter 82 Falling into Crisis

Kathie had sacrificed her time to accompany him on this business trip, so asking for compensation was reasonable-especially since Jonathan himself had just said she could name her price.

She asked, "Just tell me if you'll pay or hot."

Jonathan looked at her affectionately. "Of course I will. Name your price."

Kathie thought for a moment. "Well, since too little would be beneath your status, I'll ask for a hundred million dollars."

Jonathan fell silent. Kathie's remark struck him as unexpectedly humorous.

"What's wrong? Too expensive for you?"

"Not at all. I'm just touched by how considerate you are of my reputation."

Kathie shrugged. She had three children to raise, a grandmother to care for,and Jonathan was staying with them on her dime. She needed the money.


Jonathan pulled a gold card from his bag. "This is my supplementary card.Use it whenever you need."


Kathie frowned slightly. "This sudden generosity feels strange."

Jonathan looked genuinely hurt. "Come on. when have I ever been stingy?Living together means expenses, and I'm covering all of them. No need to hold back."


He simply didn't want Kathie overworking herself.

Kathie happily accepted. "You're quite the friend-worth keeping around."

They chatted pleasantly during the drive until they reached a rest area.

Kathie encouraged him to get some air, but Jonathan's expression turned

serious as he looked around.

"What's wrong? Are you feeling ill?"

Jonathan's tone grew grave. "There's something I need to tell you."

Seeing his expression, Kathie knew it wasn't good news. "Go on," she replied.

"We're being followed. At first, I thought it was normal highway traffic,but I've noticed two vehicles that have been trailing us. They've stopped here too, and their occupants are watching me."

Kathie anxiously looked around but saw nothing unusual. "Are you being paranoid?"she asked.

"This is a trap. Whether I go to Silverbrook or not, I'm in danger."

Kathie suddenly remembered his prestigious position-and his many enemies who wanted him dead.

By traveling with him, she had placed herself in danger too.

"What should we do? Turn back?"

"I never retreat. Get in-we need to move faster."

With mixed feelings, Kathie helped him back to the car. Through the rearview mirror, she spotted several men in black getting into two vehicles,following as they pulled away.

"You were right-they are following us. Will they hurt us? I can't die-my babies already don't have a father, they can't lose their mother too."

"Don't worry.I'll protect you."

Remembering Jonathan's previous injuries. Kathie couldn't stay calm.He

immediately instructed, "Accelerate now and exit at the next interchange.We can't stay on the highway."

An accident at highway speeds would be fatal. They needed to get off immediately.


"Understood!"

When the trailing vehicles saw them accelerating and changing direction,they suddenly floored their gas pedals and rammed them from behind.

The impact threw everyone forward. In that split second, Jonathan pulled Kathie into his arms while he slammed into the seat.


Still in shock, Kathie realized Jonathan's first instinct had been to protect her.


"Don't be afraid. I won't let anything happen to you," he comforted her gently, his voice soft and reassuring.


The steady thud of his heartbeat against her ear slowly eased her anxiety.

"Mr. Berkeley, should we stop?"

"No, keep driving. How far to the nearest exit?"

"About three miles."

Jonathan watched as the pursuing vehicles closed in. They clearly wanted him dead.


He didn't fear for himself, but Kathie was with him-and he wouldn't let anyone harm her.


He freed one hand to call Ben, but remembering he was watching the children,Jonathan called Keith instead.

Keith answered quickly,his voice casual, "Mr. Berkeley, finally decided to call me?"

"Keith, I'm being pursued on the way to Silverbrook. Send help immediately."

Jonathan's directness told Keith how dire the situation was.


"Right away. Send me your location."

After hanging up, Jonathan sent his coordinates while Kathie sat up from his embrace. Since he was calling for help, she decided to do the same and dialed Raymond.


He answered instantly, "Dr. Cavendish!"

Kathie spoke urgently, "Mr. Barnes, I'm in trouble and need your help."


With few connections in Eldoria, Raymond was one of the only powerful people Kathie knew. She hoped he could help.

"Tell me what you need. Dr. Cavendish."

"I'm on the road to Silverbrook, being intercepted by two vehicles. They seem intent on murder. Can you send someone?"


"What? Someone dares threaten the woman who saved my life? Send me your location immediately. Dr. Cavendish. I'll dispatch protection right away."

"Thank you. Mr. Barnes. You're our lifeline now."

After sending her location, Kathie looked up to find Jonathan staring at her intently.

She smiled awkwardly. "Did I do something wrong? I just thought more help would be better. If your friend can't arrive in time, we'd have backup

to protect you."

Jonathan was deeply moved. Throughout his life facing countless challenges, he had always handled them alone. Never had someone stood shoulder to shoulder with him.

This seemingly fragile woman was thinking of protecting him in this dangerous moment.

His previously grim mood lightened, as if illuminated by a ray of warmth.

"No,you did exactly the right thing."

Kathie smiled genuinely. "Don't worry, we'll be fine."

Jonathan reached for her hand, and in that instant, a sense of unity washed over them.


The pursuing vehicles rushed forward, attempting to flank them from both sides.


The bodyguard swerved onto an access road, but their pursuers accelerated behind them.


Jonathan shielded Kathie, worried she might hit the window.

The bodyguard in the passenger seat pulled a knife from his bag and handed it to Jonathan. "Mr. Berkeley, take this for protection."

Jonathan instinctively offered it to Kathie. "Here,take it."

Kathie pushed it back, raising her silver needles. "Keep it. I have these."

They recalled their previous encounter with assailants at the cottage, never imagining they would face such danger again-this time even more severe.

The pursuing vehicles recklessly floored their accelerators; the terrifying

engine roar was audible even from inside theír car.

Approaching a curve, their driver had to slow down, but the pursuers maintained speed, ramming them off the ramp directly toward a large tree.

With a deafening crash. their car slammed into the tree.Branches pierced the windows, and their driver was knocked unconscious.

In the moment of impact. Jonathan shielded Kathie with his body, his arm slashed by glass shards.
###Chapter 83 Kathie is Really Amazing

A few moments afterimpact, the occupants regained their senses. Dennis Gonzalez, Jonathan's bodyguard, turned to check on them.

"Mr. Berkeley, Dr. Cavendish, are you both alright?" he asked.

Kathie was unharmed, having been shielded in Jonathan's embrace,though his arm was bleeding.

Jonathan peered outside-their pursuers were approaching fast. He released Kathie.

"Dennis, get Dr. Cavendish outof here." Though he could stand, he couldn't escape with them and needed to ensure their safety first.

Kathie shook her head firmly. "If we leave, we leave together. I won't abandon you."


Jonathan sighed. "They outnumber us. We have no chance. You run first-I'll hold on until you can bring back help."

Kathie insisted, "I'm absolutely not leaving you behind."

Seeing the attackers closing in, Dennis opened the door. "I'll hold them off.Mr. Berkeley,call for backup."

Jonathan called Keith again. "Keith, how long until you get here?"

"Hang on, Jonathan! Ten more minutes," Keith replied frantically.

"In ten minutes you'll be collecting my corpse," Jonathan retorted."What about your helicopter?"

"It's being repaired. Don't worry-I'm driving 120 mph. Almost there."

Kathie watched several attackers surround Dennis. He wouldn't last long.

and with Jonathan's leg injury, they were trapped in the car.

Soon, one of the assailants ran toward them, smashing the window with a rock.

As the window by Kathie shattered. Jonathan swiftly pulled her to him.When an arm reached through the broken window, Jonathan stabbed it with his knife. The attacker withdrew, screaming in pain.

When Jonathnan's window was broken next. Kathie immediately jabbed her acupuncture needle at the intruder, who retreated in agony.

They exchanged glances and smiled. "Great teamwork!"

An attacker tried to open the door, but Kathie flicked her needle with precision. hitting him in the neck. "Don't move, or you're finished," she warned.


The man ignored her and continued pulling. Within seconds, he collapsed,his body turning purple and convulsing-frightening the others into keeping their distance.

Jonathan gave her an admiring look. "Dr. Cavendish, you're quite impressive."


Kathie smiled ruefully. "What a shame. I learned acupuncture to heal, not harm.My teacher would be furious."

Jonathan took her hand earnestly. "That's not true. You're saving us."

Kathie looked at him, her heart racing. No one had ever protected her as he had, risking his life for her safety. She was acutely aware of her changing feelings for Jonathan, though she'd been suppressing them.

"What are you waiting for? Use the rocks!" a voice shouted from outside,snapping her back to reality. They couldn't stay in the car-it was a death

trap.

As the attackers began smashing the car with rocks. Kathie opened the opposite door and helped Jonathan out.

Jonathan pushed her away. "Run! I'm their target."

Furious. Kathie held onto him firmly. "Push me away again and I'll give you extra needles tonight. We agreed to stay together-I won't abandon you!"

Jonathan was stunned by her words, which touched him deeply and moved him to the core.

"But what about your children if something happens to you?"

"Then we'll both make sure nothing happens to either of us."

Supporting him as they moved awkwardly forward, they were quickly surrounded by knife-wielding attackers. Kathie's heart raced with fear. She wanted to save Jonathan, but she didn't want to die either. Who would care for her three children and grandmother? She readied her needles,prepared to fight.

Jonathan stepped in front of Kathie protectively. "Who sent you? If it's me you want, leave the woman alone."


The assailant raised his knife menacingly. "You're both dead!"

As they charged forward, Jonathan shielded Kathie with his body.Just as the knife was about to strike him, a furious shout echoed from nearby,"Stop! We're Mr. Raymond Barnes's men! Anyone who harms his lifesaver will answer to us!"

At Raymond's name, the attackers froze, then fled at the sight of over a dozen armed men rushing toward them.

The leader approached Kathie as his men bowed respectfully. "Dr.Cavendish. are you alright? I'm Kian Barnes, Mr. Raymond Barnes's nephew. He sent us to protect you."

Still shaken. Kathie realized they would have been killed without this timely intervention.

"Mr. Barnes, thank you for coming to our rescue," she said.

"My uncle said that since you saved his life, he'll protect you as long ashe lives."

Kathie felt immense gratitude-her past kindness had saved their lives.Learning of her danger, Raymond had sent his own nephew by helicopter instead of entrusting the mission to subordinates.

Jonathan spoke up, "Please convey my thanks tó Mr. Barnes. If he ever needs anything, I'll be there without hestation."

Kian nodded respectfully. "I'll tell him. Since your car is wrecked and our helicopter is nearby, may we escort you? It would put my uncle's mind at ease."


"That would be wonderful, thank you." With their car destroyed,helicopter transport and protection were exactly what they needed.

"No need for thanks, Dr. Cavendish," Kian said cheerfully. "If you hadn't saved my uncle, he'd be gone. It's our turn to repay that debt. Those attackers looked like professiona1 criminals-I'll look into it."

Kathie expressed her deep gratitude,"You're helping us tremendously.Please thank Mr. Barnes for me as well."

Jonathan, who had intended to protect Kathie, instead found himself saved because of her-the first time in his life he'd been protected by a woman.

Just then. Keith and his team finaly arrived, rushing toward them."Jonathan! I'm here! Are you okay?" he called out.

Jonathan couldn't helpbut roll his eyes. "Minor injuries. If we'd waited for you, we'd be with the angels by now."

KKeith laughed awkwardly. "Sorry about that. Cars can't compete with wings."

Jonathan punched him lightly. "Don't worry, I'm not blaming you. Mr.Barnes's men are flying us to Silverbrook. Get the unconscious bodyguard to a hospital, then watch the company for me. Also, arrange some protection for Kathie's children."

Keith gave him a thumbs up. "Worrying about them at a time like this?People might think you're their real father."

Jonathan glared at him. Keith shrugged. "Got it. I'm on it. Take care of yourself."


Kian helped Jonathan into the helicopter where Kathie treated his arm wound-fortunately not deep enough to cause complications.

Twenty minutes later, they landed in Silverbrook.
###Chapter 84 The Sharp-Tongued Secretary

Jonathan had just stepped off the helicopter when he got the latest news:Austin and his wife had arrived in Silverbrook, but his wife had fainted and was now in the hospital. There was no time to discuss business with Flynn.

Jonathan, with Kathie by his side, hurried over. In the car, he said, "From now on. you're my secretary."

Kathie nodded. "Got it. This way. I can help you better."

Introducing her as a doctor might complicate things.

Silverbrook Hospital.

Austin stood by his wife's bedside, looking worried, while Flynn tried to comfort him, "Mr. Roberts, don't worry too much. Our doctors here are top-notch. Mrs. Roberts is just experiencing severe morning sickness and some travel-related issues. It's nothing serious."

Austin watched his wife, who was vomiting and looked utterly exhausted,and felt a pang of sorrow.

He said,"Mr. Campbell, please have your doctors find a solution. My wife is in so much pain."

The doctor sighed. "Mrs. Roberts is three months pregnant. Long-distance travel isn't ideal for her, and the travel has made her morning sickness worse. We can't just prescribe medication without risking harm to the baby.
"

Austin was anxious. "So what do we do? Just let her suffer like this? Can't you think of something else?"

Flynn reassured him,"Have Mrs. Roberts drink plenty of water and rest

for a couple of days. She'll be fine."

Austin glared at him. "Is that your solution? She's been vomiting non-stop.How can she drink water? I've heard your country has excellent traditional healers. Why don't you find one to help her?"

Flynn replied, "Mr. Roberts, those are just exaggerated claims. Traditional healers can't solve these kinds of problems."

"Who says they can't? I can!" Kathie interjected.

Flynn turned around to see Jonathan in a wheelchair, a slight smile on his face. "Mr. Berkeley? Even with your condition, you cameall the way to Silverbrook?"

Jonathan shot him a glance. "Don't get too cocky. You might not even realize how you failed."

Flynn gritted his teeth, determined to see who would have the last laugh.

Austin, feeling a bit awkward, said, "Mr. Berkeley, what brings you here?"

Jonathan laughed heartily. "I was heartbroken when you stood me up, so I came over."


Austín,feeling guilty,quickly changed the subject. "Was it the lady behind you who said she could help my wife? Can she really?"

Jonathan nodded confidently. "Mr. Roberts, let me introduce you to my secretary,Kathie. She's trained in traditional healing and knows a lot about medicine. She can definitely help Mrs. Roberts."

Flynn, not wanting Jonathan to steal the credit, quickly said, "Mr. Roberts,don't be too quick to believe this. In our country, they say eight out of ten traditional healers are frauds. If something goes wrong,it could be disastrous."

This serious warning made Austin hesitate.

Kathie stepped forward. "I've observed Mrs. Roberts' condition. Severe morning sickness combined with travel-related issues is very serious. If it continues, it could lead to dehydration and endanger her life. I'm confident I can help her."

Flynn countered, "Stop scaremongering. We have traditional healers at our hospital too. I can have them treat her."

Kathie replied confidently, "If you want her pain relieved quickly, I'm the one who can do it. If you don't believe me, we can make a bet. Even if you bring in all the traditional healers in town, they won't match my results."

Flynn.seeing her confidence,hesitated to bet.

Jonathan chimed in, "Mr. Roberts, you knów my situation. My leg was healed by her. Her skills are exceptional. She can definitely help Mrs.Roberts. We wouldn't have come all this way to cause trouble."

Austin found this reasonable. Jonathan wouldn't risk his secretary's reputation without being sure.

Austin looked at Kathie. "Are you really confident?"

Flynn quickly added, "If anything goes wrong, you must leave Silverbrook.
Mr.Berkeley, do you dare to bet?"

Kathie looked at him. "If I succeed, will you withdraw from the competition?"


Flynn gritted his teeth, thinking this secretary was quite opportunistic.

He said, "I'm just concerned about your medical skills."

Kathie rolled her eyes. "You don't need to worry. I can absolutely handle

this."

Flynn was frustrated. Jonathan had indeed found a sharp-tongued secretary.

Jonathan gave her an approving look. He knew that curing Austin's wife would win Austin's favor.

Austin, seeing her confidence and knowing Jonathan's character,agreed.

"Alright, but my wife can't take medication or easily receive IV fluids."

Kathie nodded. "Ill use acupuncture."

"You know acupuncture?" Austin was surprised.

Flynn wanted to say something, but Jonathan quickly interjected, "She used acupuncture to heal me. Mr. Roberts, rest assured."

Seeing his wife in such distress, Austin agreed to let her try.

Flynn decided not to say more. He didn't believe Kathie,just Jonathan's secretary, could really do it. He hoped she would worsen Austin's wife's condition, making it easier for him to win Austin over.


Kathie took out silver needles and calmly performed acupuncture on Austin's wife under everyone's watchful eyes.

A few minutes later, Austin's wife, who had been pale, started to regain color. Even her morning sickness improved, astonishing the doctors.

Twenty minutes later, Kathie removed the needles. Austin's wife felt tired and wanted to sleep.

After being tormented by morning sickness for eight hours since the flight,she hadn't been able to rest.

Auistin. overjoyed, comforted his wife to sleep and led Kathie and the others out.

Flynn's face was grim. He hadn't expected Kathie to have such skills.

Kathie advised. "Mrs. Roberts will be fine after a nap. If there are any issues, you can contact Mr. Berkeley."

Austin smiled. "Thank you so much. Mr. Berkeley, you have remarkable people around you. I was worried about my wife and was planning to take her back soona. Now we can discuss business."

Jonathan,sensing hope, smiled. "We should find time to talk."

Flynn quickly interrupted, "Mr. Roberts, it's lunchtime. I've booked the best restaurant for you. You've had a long day and should eat."

Austin nodded.

Jonathan chimed in, "We just arrived in Silverbrook. Mr. Campbell, would you invite us too?"

Flynn gritted his teeth, thinking Jonathan was shameless. He was about to refuse when Kathie said, "I'm quite tired after treating Mrs. Roberts. Can I join you for a meal?"

As Austin's benefactor, Kathie had spoken, and Austin couldn't refuse. "Of course, no problem. Mr. Berkeley, please join us."
###Chapter 85 Unfaithful Men

Flynn was fuming. He had gone through so mch trouble to get Austin to Silverbrook just to get away from Jonathan, and now Jonathan had shown up in person.

Earlier, Kathie had helped Austin, and Flynn was now desperate to find a way to regain the upper hand.

Jonathan looked at Flynn. "So, Mr. Campbell, what do you think?"

Flynn forced a smile and nodded. "Always happy to host. You're welcome here."


Since Austin had extended the invitation, Flynn had no choice but to agree.

At the most luxurious restaurant in Silverbrook, Flynn had ordered a lavish spread. Once the dlishes were served, he clapped his hands, and a stunning woman in a revealing outfit walked out.

Flynn enthusiastically introduced her. "Mr. Roberts, this is my secretary,Eleanor Mitchell. She heard you were coming and insisted on joining us for a drink."

Jonathan and Kathie exchanged glances, surprised that Flynn would resort to such a tactic to win Austin over.

Eleanor swayed her hips seductively as she slowly sat next to Austin,picking up a glass of wine.

She said slowly, in a seductive manner, "Mr. Roberts, I've heard so much about you. It's an honor to finally meet you. Let's have a few drinks together."


Austin grinned, "Being on the mind of such a beautiful woman is my honor."

Kathie felt a bit disgusted seeing Austin practically ogling Eleanor. Just a moment ago, she had thought Austin and his wife were the perfect couple.and now he was flirting with another woman.

She thought. 'None of men are faithful.'

She glanced at Jonathan and found him staring at her intensely, which made her uncomfortable.

Flynn raised his glass. "Mr. Berkeley, it's rare for us to meet. We should have a drink."

Jonathan picked up his glass, but Kathie snatched it away."Mr. Campbell,
Mr. Berkeley is injured and can't drink. I'll drink for himn."

Flynn sneered. "A man letting a woman drink for him? That's not right."

Kathie shot back, "You knew Mr. Roberts has a pregnant wife, and you stiIl arranged for him to have drinks with an attractive woman? How is that appropriate?"

"You!" Flynn was so angry his mouth twisted, but he quickly calmed down. "Mr. Berkeley is injured, so iť's fine for you to drink for him.But you should drink three glasses to show respect."

Kathie downed the first glass. "No problem."


As she poured the second glass, Jonathan held her hand. "Don't overdo it."

Kathie whispered, "Don't worry, I-can handle my liquor. This is nothing."

Jonathan had never seen her drink before, but seeing how composed she was, he assumed she could handle it and let go.

.Flynn clapped as she finished the three glasses. "Ms. Cavendish, you're impressive. Let me toast you again."

Jonathan's face darkened. "Mr. Campbell,she just drank."

"That was for you. This is my toast to her. It's different." Flynn said, then he turned to Kathie. "Or do you look down on me?"

Flynn was trying to get her drunk.

Kathie smiled. "Fine. I'll toast you out of respect."

Flynn nodded in satisfaction as she drank, then signaled the waiter to refill her glass.

He smirked. "Ms. Cavendish, you're not only capable but also skilled in medicine. I admire you. Let me toast you again."

He drank first, holding up his empty glass to pressure her.

Kathie understood and picked up her glass with a smile. "Mr. Campbell, I should drink your toast. But if you keep trying to get me drunk, be careful.1


"What, are you gonna hit me?"

He was hoping Kathie would embarrass herself in front of Austin.

Kathie shook her head. "I don't hit people, but I do acupuncture.When I get drunk, I like to practice on others. If I accidentally cripple you, don't blame me."


Flynn's face stiffened. He had seen her acupuncture skills earlier and wondered if she could really hurt him.

Jonathan added, "Mr. Campbell, you might not know, but on our way here,we were ambushed. She disabled the attacker with a single needle. She .tends to practice on people when she's drunk. You should be careful."

Austin found this amusing. "Ms. Cavendish, you are indeed impressive.I'

d like to see your acupuncture skills."

Kathie happily said, "Then TIl keep drinking with Mr. Campbell. When I'm drunk. I'll give you a demonstration."

Flynn was unsettled by this and coughed. "I've had some stomach issues lately. The doctor advised me not to drink too much. Let's just have some juice."

Kathie asked seriously, "No more drinking?"

"No more. Let's have juice."

Flynn quickly had the waiter remove the alcohol to prevent Kathie from getting drunk and causing trouble.

Jonathan gave Kathie a thumbs up. She always had a way.

Eleanor poured Austin some juice, deliberately spilling it on his clothes.

In a flirtatious voice, she said, "Oh no, Mr. Roberts, I'm so sorry.Let me clean that up."

She leaned in, showing off her figure.

Flynn was pleased but pretended to scold her. "Ellie, you're so clumsy.You've soaked Mr. Roberts' clothes. I have a room upstairs. Take him to change."

Eleanor took Austin' arm and cooed, "Mr. Roberts, it's my fault. Let me take you to change. You can punish me however you like."

Kathie clenched her fists. Austin's wife was in the hospital, and he was about to go off with another woman?

Austin hesitated, and Flynn quickly said, "It's just a change of clothes. He'Il be right back."

Jonathan spoke up. "Mr. Roberts is known for being a model husband. I'm sure he knows his limits."

Austin's eyes cleared, and just then, his phone rang. It was the hospital.saying his wife was awake and asking for him.

"T'll be right there!" Austin hung up and quickly left after giving some instructions.

Flynn signaled Eleanor to follow and try to get close to him.

With the guests gone, Flynn had no reason to stay, especially with people he disliked. He stood up coldly. "Mr. Berkeley, I've already paid. Enjoy your meal. I'm leaving."

Jonathan raised an eyebrow. "Don't let the door hit you on the way out."

After Flynn left, Jonathan noticed Kathie's flushed cheeks and unsteady posture.Was she drunk?

"Are you okay?" Jonathan asked, concerned.

Kathie's vision blurred, and she asked curiously, "Why are there two Sevens?"


Jonathan facepalmed. "Didn't you say you could handle your liquor? You can't drink,can you?"

Kathie yawned and laid her head on the table, lazily saying,"Of course I can't. But I couldn't let him look down on us or make you worry."

If Jonathan knew she couldn't drink, he wouldn't have let her take his place.He would have drunk himself, affecting his health.

Jonathan felt a warmth in his heart. This seemingly fragile woman, who couldn't do much, kept protecting him and making him feel a unique warmth.

He brushed her hair aside and gently helped her up. "Don't sleep here.Let's get back to the hotel."
###Chapter 86 Do You Want to Kiss

Kathie opened her bleary eyes, feeling the effects of the alcohol.She was dizzy and saw two Jonathans in front of her.

She wiggled her finger back and forth. "Seven, which one of you is real?"

Jonathan held her hand. "Both of them are me. You're drunk. Let's get you back to the hotel."

"I'm not drunk. I stilI need to treat you when we get back."

Jonathan fell silent. Honestly, he could skip a day of treatment. With Kathie seeing double, wouldn't she end up giving him twice the needles?

Jonathan called Dennis in to take her back to the hotel.

To make it easier for Kathie to treat him, Jonathan had booked the presidential suite. As soon as they entered, Kathie opened her backpack and took out her acupuncture needles, looking quite determined.

"Come over here and lie down. Take off your pants."

Jonathan cleared his throat to remind her there was someone else in the room. Dennis quickly found an excuse to leave. "Mr. Berkeley, I'll go check the situation outside. Call me if you need anything."

Before Jonathan could respond, Kathie was already reaching for his pants.Clearly, this wasn't the right time for an audience.

"Go ahead," Jonathan said.

He grabbed her hand, looking into her bright eyes, and teased,"Dr.Cavendish, are you in such a hurry?"

Kathie,half-squinting,nodded seriously, "Of course, treating you is urgent.Once you're better, you won't need someone to take care of you every day."

"Don't you like taking care of me?"

"Taking care of someone is tiring.Who would like that?"

Jonathan felt a bit deflated but cooperated by taking off his pants.

Kathie, her body soft and emitting a sweet scent mixed with the smell of alcohol, sat on his lap. It was like a drug, making Jonathan's mind wander.

Seeing her body sway, Jonathan quickly supported her waist. The closeness made his face flush with heat.


"Dr. Cavendish, is this how you usually do acupuncture for your patients?"

"No, I only do this for you."

Jonathan admired her flushed face and curiously asked,"Why only for me?11


Kathie shook her head. "I don't know. Patients shouldn't talk so much.I'm about to start."

Jonathan was genuinely worried. "I know you're skilled, but what happens if you miss a point?"

Kathie answered nonchalantly,"You might become paralyzed."

Jonathan awkwardly pulled at the corners of his mouth. Honestly,his leg could go untreated.

Then he heard Kathie say, "I've never made a mistake. Even with my eyes closed, I can find the points accurately."

"Have you ever done acupuncture while drunk?"

"No,I haven't."

Jonathan was speechless. Was she drunk or not?

If she was drunk, she responded to everything he said. If she wasn't,she could barely keep her eyes open and was swaying.

"Alright. I trust you."

Kathie rubbed her eyes. "Then Ill start."

Jonathan nodded,feeling anxious as he watched her insert the needles.

He had been worried she wouldn't find the points, but despite her shaky hands,she accurately performed the acupuncture.

But as soon as she firfished, she fell asleep, leaving Jonathan in a bind.

"Dr.Cavendish, don't fall asleep. You haven't removed the needles."

Without opening her eyes, Kathie responded, "Don't worry. I'll wake up in fifteen minutes."


Jonathan chuckled helplessly. He didn't believe her. Everyone knew that once a drunk person fell asleep, nothing could wake them. He wouldn't let her drink like this again.

He pulled a blanket over her and couldn't resist stroking her face as she slept sweetly.

Fifteen minutes later, Kathie actually woke up on her own,like it was ingrained in her to never let her medical practice falter.

Jonathan wasn't sure if she was really awake or sleepwalking.

"Dr. Cavendish, are you still with me?"

Kathie propped herself up and looked at him, her dreamy eyes stirring Jonathan's heart.

With nimble fingers, she removed the needles and put them back in her

bag.

Feeling like she had completed her task, she relaxed completely."I'm so tired. I'm going to sleep."

Jonathan held her hand. "You forgot. My arm is still injured. You need to change the dressing."

Kathie perked up a bit, remembering he had been cut by glass protecting her. She dug out some ointment from her bag.

"Take off your shirt too."

Jonathan smirked. "Dr. Cavendish, if I take off my shirt, I'll only be in my underwear."


Kathie was unfazed. "I'm a doctor. I've seen it all. I don't mind.Go ahead."

Jonathan stared at her, his Adam's apple bobbing, and spoke in a seductive voice, "Alright,I'll take it off."

His long fingers slowly unbuttoned his shirt, each movement tantalizing.making Kathie feel parched.

As he removed his shirt, revealing his muscular chest and impressive abs.Kathie's heart raced.

She shook her head to clear her thoughts. This was a patient.She couldn't have inappropriate thoughts.

Jonathan cupped her chin and teased, "Dr. Cavendish, you're looking at the wrong place. My arm is injured."

Kathie quickly avered her gaze, turning her head only to meet Jonathan's eyes. They were so close,she could hear his heartbeat.

Jonathan, seeing her flushed cheeks, leaned in slowly. "Dr.Cavendish,do

you want to kiss?"

His deep voice surrounded Kathie, his body exuding a magnetic pull that made her head spin.

She licked her lips, her eyes full of desire.

Jonathan wrapped an arm around her waist. "If you don't answer.I'll take it as a yes."

Kathie's chest heaved, and the next second, Jonathan's lips were on hers,his tongue exploring her mouth with greedy abandon.

Kathie's body tingled, and she clung to his neck for support.

Jonathan lifted her, making her straddle his lap, pulling her closer.

Kathie was startled by his move and pushed him away. The string of saliva between their lips was intensely erotic, making her head spin.

This feeling was familiar, like the man who had passionately entangled with her that night.

Jonathan looked up at her. "What's wrong? Don't you like it?"

Kathie shook her head. She liked it, but she was too shy to admit it.

Jonathan leaned in to guide her. "Keep going if you like it, or are you getting cold feet now?"

Kathie pouted. "What's there to be afraid of? It's just a kiss!"

With that, she cupped Jonathan's face and kissed him. It was her first time initiating a kiss, and whether it was the alcohol or not, it had a huge impact on Jonathan.

He held her tightly, his hands slipping under her shirt, caressing her

smooth back. Slowly, his hands moved to the front. fouching her soft breasts.

Kathie moaned softly, not resisting. which gave him the courage to unhook her bra and gently knead her breasts.

Kathie felt her body heat up, like she was about to burst into flames.
###Chapter 87 Your Body is More Honest Than You
Jonathan had been holding back for a long time, and now he wasready to explode, desperate to make love to Kathie.

His kiss was fierce and domineering, only letting go when he felt Kathie struggling to breathe.

But he didn't stop there. He lifted her shirt, raised her waist, and took her nipple into his mouth.

Kathie let out a soft, delicate moan. "Jonathan,not here..."

Kathie's body trembled, and Jonathan was pleased that she wasn't too drunk to call out his name, knowing who was doing this to her.

He lifted his head, his tongue still teasing her. "Why not? Don't you like it?
1

Kathie's body shivered. It wasn't that she didn't like it; she just felt a bit ashamed.


"I... I feel like my heart is going to jump out."

Jonathan moved to the other side. His hand slipped into her pants,caressing her firm buttocks. Seeing Kathie with her eyes tightly shut,he lifted her chin. "Dr. Cavendish, open your eyes and see what I'm doing."

Kathie gasped for air, slowly opening her eyes, desire evident in them.

Seeing Jonathan's handsome face, she couldn't help but endure his touch. "Jonathan,you're so handsome."

Jonathan placed her hand on his chest. "Do you like this?"

Kathie shyly tried to pull back, but Jonathan held her hand in place.

blowing gently into her ear. "Don't hold back," he whispered.

Kathie's cheeks flushed, her trembling hand lightly touching his firm chest.slowly sliding down to his abs.


Wherever her fingers touched, it felt like electricity, making Jonathan's heart itch.


"What's this hard thing?" Kathie felt like she was sitting on a stick.

Jonathan guided her hand lower. "You'll know if you touch it."

Before Kathie could react, he led her hand to his crotch. When she touched his erection, she quickly tried to pull away, but Jonathan pinned her down, his elbows on either side of her, playing with her hair.

He said softly, "What, you've been teasing me all this time, and now you want to run?"

Kathie struggled, her loose clothes slipping off, revealing her flawless skin,now tinged with a pink hue from the alcohol, looking like a ripe peach,tempting and irresistible.

"Jonathan,you're bullying me."

"Aren't you feeling good? Ican make you feel even better."

Kathie shook her head in panic. "We can't do this."

Jonathan leaned down, his firm chest pressing against her, their bodies tightly pressed together, making Kathie's face flush down to her neck.

"Then tell me,how can we do this?"

"This is something only couples do."

Jonathan smiled."Kathie,will you be my girlfriend?"

Kathie was stunned. Did she hear that right? Was Jonathan teasing her because she was drunk?

"Jonathan, do you like me?"

"H I didn't like you, why would I keep you by my side? If I didn't like you,why would I be willing to live with you? If I didn't like you,why would I treat your three kids as my own?"

Kathie's eyes reddened. His words weren't sweet talk, but they touched her heart.


Jonathan looked at her deeply. "I've answered your question. What's your answer?"


Kathie turned her head away. "I don't have an answer."

Jonathan buried his head in her neck,giving her a gentle bite. Kathie winced and glared at him. "What are you doing,biting me?"

"Because you're not being straight with me. Don't you want to be my girlfriend?"

Kathie, though a bit dizzy, hadn't forgotten some things. "You have a fiancée,a famous star."

Jonathan held her face seriously. "Listen, she's not my fiancée. She once saved my life. To avoid harassment, she publicly claimed I was her boyfriend so no one would dare to harass her."

"I agreed to help her out of gratitude, and because I don't like other women getting close to me. So, she acts as my shield. We both get what we need," he added.

Kathie stared at him. "I see, but I can tell she truly loves you."

Jonathan kissed her. "That's her business. My heart belongs to you."

Kathie's eyes sparkled, her heart racing.

"Kathie, be my girlfriend."

Kathie,flustered, avoided his gaze, trying to get up, but the mnore she moved,the closer they got.

"I can hardly breathe."

Jonathan spread her legs, wrapping them around his waist, the position making Kathie nearly lose it.

"This..."

Jonathan kissed her, biting her ear. "Dr. Cavendish, your body is more honest than you are."

Kathie panted. After all, Jonathan was so handsome, she wouldn't be losing out.

"Alright. I'll date you. But if you get close to any other woman,I'll turn the Berkeley Family upside down and make sure you can't function as a man. I am..."


Before she could finish,Jonathan kissed her, and with her agreement, he stripped off her clothes, his large hands removing her panties.

Kathie's heart pounded. She grabbed Jonathan. "Isn't this too fast?"

Jonathan kissed her hard,biting her neck. "Not fast. I've dreamed of this moment so many times,"

Kathie blushed. "You pervert, you've been fantasizing about me."

Jonathan lifted her hips, kissing her lips gently.

Their breaths mingled in the quiet space between them,the air thick with

unspoken desire. He moved closer, drawn to her by an irresistible pull and slowly, he eased into her warmth.

Jonathan completely let go. unleashing his desires on her.

Kathie felt like she was back on that night, entangled with the man in the dark.


But she knew it was Jonathan with her now, so why didit feel the same as with that man?


As their rhythm grew more urgent. Kathie's senses honed in on the feel of his touch, the sound of his ragged breaths, the way her body seemed to melt into his. The edges of reality blurred, and she allowed herself to be swept away, lost in the moment and the man who enveloped her.

Meanwhile, Eleanor returned from the hospital to report to Flynn,

She said, "Mr. Campbell, Mr. Roberts wouldn't even look at me. I stayed by his side the whole time, but I couldn't get a moment alone with him."

Flynn pulled her onto his lap, lifting her skirt. "Didn't you say no man in the world could resist you? What happened with him?"

Eleanor pouted. "MaybeI'm not charming enough."

Flynn patted her firm buttocks. Such a sexy beauty, no man could resist.

"It's not your charm. His wife was with him. We'll find another chance.Tonight,just keep me company.".

Eleanor sat on his lap. "I like you best, Mr. Campbell. I'll find a way to help you get his contract."

"You're so considerate. If we land this project, I'll give you half the commission."

"T'll do my best."

"Then show me your charm tonight."

"Mr. Campbell, you're so bad."

Flynn was determined to get Austin's contract, no matter what it took, to cut off Jonathan's path.
###Chapter 88 Irresponsible Bad Woman

The next morning, Kathie woke up feeling like she'd just run a marathon.Every muscle in her body screamed in protest.

Groggily, she opened her eyes and immediatey felt a weight on her stomach. Out of habit, she reached out to grab it, mumbling to herself,"Which little rascal put their foot on Mommy's tummy?"

When her hand grasped a large hand instead, Kathie froze. She quickly realized something was off-there was someone else beside her.

Instantly wide awake, she carefully turned her head. Seeing Jonathan's handsome face, her mind went blank.

After a few seconds, fragmented memories began to resurface. In those fleeting glimpses, she saw herself and Jonathan, their bodies tangled in a heated kiss, their faces unmistakable.

Kathie's mind buzzed. What had she done?

A drunken mistake?

She had slept with Jonathan!

Jonathan's lips curled into a smile as he opened his eyes. Kathie quickly pulled the covers over her head.

"Dr.Cavendish,you were so passionate last night. Why so shy now?”

Realizing they were both naked. Kathie clutched the blanket tightly and moved to the side. "What passion? I don't know what you're talking about.
1


Jonathan smirked."Are you trying to play dumb? People always say men are the ones who shirk responsibility after sleeping with someone. I didin't expect Dr.Cavendish to be that kind of woman. You were dlearly enioving

it last night, and now you're pretending it didn't happen."

Kathie lunged forward to cover his mouth. "Don't say such things. I was drunk last night and not in my right mind."

Jonathan stared at her intently. "And then?"

Kathie gritted her teeth, her mind in turmoil. "We're both adults. You didn't lose out either. Let's just pretend it never happened and not mention it to anyone."

Jonathan fell silent.

So she had forgotten everything they talked about last night.

Facing his reproachful gaze, Kathie felt guilty and looked away.She wanted to slap herself. Although she had been somewhat attracted to Jonathan and had thought about sleeping with him, she shouldn't have actually done it.

Jonathan sighed. "I never thought I'd be the one getting played."

Kathie, flustered, jumped up, causing the blanket to slip of and reveal her naked body. She quickly grabbed the blanket to cover herself.

She screamed. "Don't look!"

Jonathan's sharp eyes had already noticed the red marks on her chest.He had left quite a few marks on her last night.

He hadn't had a drop of alcohol, so he remembered every moment vividly.

Kathie took a deep breath to stay calm. The deed was done. and she needed to find a way to resolve it.

"You were at fault too. You knew I was drunk. If I did something irrational you should have stopped me."

Jonathan, feigning innocence, said, "How could I stop you? I'm injured,my leg can't move, my arm can't lift. You pinned me down and took control.I almost screamed my lungs out."

Kathie bared her teeth.

She didn't believe a word of it!

Could she really pin Jonathan down?

He was lying through his teeth.

"What about Dennis?You could have called him to pull me away."

"He wasn't feeling well either. I told him to rest. What, am I not enough for you? Do you need both of us?"

Kathie gritted her teeth,trying to stay calm. "What's done is done. Tell me what you want."

Jonathan grinned mischievously. "Last night, you agreed to be my girlfriend. I want you to keep your promise."

Kathie looked up in disbelief. "No way. I would never agree to that."

Jonathan's face turned cold. "Do you really not remember, or are you just messing with me? Did you forget everything we talked about last night?"

Seeing him getting angry. Kathie spoke seriously."I really don't remember.You know I don't drink. Isn't this taking advantage of me?"

Jonathan rubbed his forehead. Now it seemed like it was his fault.

"If that's how you feel, then let's do as you said. Pretend it never happened."

Kathie felt uneasy. This was the first time she had encountered such a

situation and didn't know what to do.

She lifted the blanket to get out of bed, but her phone suddenly rang with a video call request. Startled, she quickly tríed to turn it off but accidentally answered it.


As the video connected, she threw the phone away and hid under the covers. The phone landed in Jonathan's hand.

"Mommy,where's Mommy?"

"Hey, isn't that Seven?"

"Good morning. Seven. Why do you have Mommy's phone?"

Kyle asked curiously, "Seven, why aren't you wearing any clothes? And what's with the red marks on your neck and body? Are you hurt?"

Jonathan looked down. There were still bite marks from Kathie on his chest.

He hadn't expected Kathie to be so wild during sex.

Jonathan put on a robe, needing to maintain his image in front of the kids.

"I ran into a wild little cat last night. It scratched and bit me all over."

Eileen looked worried. "That wild cat is so bad. Did you catch it?"

Jonathan glanced at Kathie hiding under the covers. "No, the wild cat ran away quickly. I couldn't catch it,"

Kathie pinched his thigh, making Jonathan wince.

How dare he call her a wild cat? He must have a death wish.

"Are you okay? You look like you're in pain."

Jonathan gritted his teeth and replied. "I'm fine. The wild cat heard us talking about it and came back to scratch me again. Next time I catch it,T'Il teach it a lesson."

Zachary said, "If we were there,we could help you catch the wild cat."

Kyle looked around the room. "Why can't we see Mommy? Isn't she with you?"

Kathie quickly got dressed and signaled Jonathan to keep quiet in front of the kids.

Jonathan gave a mischievous smile. Kathie picked up a silver needle to threaten him, and he cleared his throat to speak properly.
"Your mommy is in the next room. She helped me with acupuncture last night and left her phone here. I'll call her."
Jonathan pretended to call out to Kathie.

Kathie quickly washed up and covered her neck before coming out.

She knocked on the door, pretending to enter. "Are you kids there?"

Jonathan gave her a thumbs up. Kathie's acting skills could win an award.

Kathie took the phone, and the kids cheered.

"Mommy,Mommy!"

"Mommy, I miss you. When are you coming back?"

"Mommy, we miss you. Come back soon."

Seeing her kids, Kathie's bad mood vanished.

"Mommy misses you too. Once I finish things here, I'll come back. Be good and listen to Ben. Kyle vouethe1-

siblings."

Kyle nodded obediently. "Don't worry, Mommy. I'll take good care of them.
###Chapter 89 Do I Make You That Excited?

Kathie looked at the three innocent little faces and felt her heart melt. "Kyle is the best-behaved, and my Zachary and Eileen are good too."

Eileen asked curiously, "Mommy, Seven said he got scratched by a stray cat. Did you see it?"

Zachary chimed in, "What kind of wild cat is so fierce? Seven has a wound on his leg. You need to take good care of him."

Kyle nodded,"Mommy, make sure to close the doors and windows so that stray cat doesn't come in."

Kathie was silent.

Great,now she was the stray cat.

She shot Jonathan a glare. He raised an eyebrow and shrugged, as if it had nothing to do with him.
"Okay, Mommy will make sure to close the doors so the wild cat can't come in. If I see it next time. I'll chase it away."
Eileen shook her head, "No, Mommy, stray cats have lives too. We need to be kind to them."

Kathie bit her lip, not wanting to spend the whole morning talking about stray cats. "Aren't you guys about to go to school? Do you have everything you need?1 The three kids nodded in unison and showed her their backpacks. "Don't -worry, Mommy. We have everything. Ben will check our stufagain." Kathie smiled and gave them a thumbs-up."My three little ones are the best. When Mommy comes back. I'll bring you gifts."

Eileen's eyes welled up with tears. "Mommy, come back soon. I miss you."

Kathie blew a kiss. "Mommy misses you too. We'll be back as soon as we're done. Be good and go to school."

The three kids waved obediently. "Goodbye, Mommy."

Kathie hung up the phone and glared at Jonathan."What was that about telling them you got scratched by a stray cat?"

Jonathan pointed to the red marks on his neck. the scratches on his chest.and a very noticeable bite mark.

"I don't get it either. Why did you bite me last night? Did I excite you that much?"


Kathie screamed loudly, starling Jonathan,who widened his eyes.

She blushed. "Just don't mention it again. If I hear about it one more time.I'll stick you with a needle."

Kathie stormed out of the room.leaving Jonathan speechless.

Kathie really didn't know what was good for her, dismissing him like that and even threatening him to keep quiet.


So many women wanted his attention, and he never gave them a second glance. But she chose to run away.

Kathie quickly locked herself in her room, feeling her heart about to jump out of her chest.


She didn't remember much of what they said last night, but the wild scenes on the bed were still vivid in her mind.

Thinking about the marks all over Jonathan's body. she pulled at her hair,feeling like she was going crazy. How could she do such things to him?How would they face each other in the future?

Calm down!

Calm down!

After all, she was drunk. She could just pretend to forget. She didn't want to get involved with the wealthy families. nordid she want people to say he was a fool for being with a divorced woman with children of unknown
parentage.

Kathie took a bath to refresh herself. She was about to take a nap when Austin called. His wife. Kenna, wanted to invite them to dinner.


Kathie put on a sharp little suit,adding a scart to cover the marks on her neck.


She knocked on Jonathan's door. Dennis was helping him get dressed.

Their eyes met, and it felt like their gazes had changed. Kathie quickly looked away.


"Ms. Cavendish, could you help Mr. Berkeley with his tie? I can't seem to get it right."


Kathie cleared her throat. "He doesn't need a tie."

She really didn't want to get close to Jonathan right now.


Jonathan's deep voice cut through the tension, "I don't mind,but I wonder what people will think when they see the marks on my neck?"

Kathie glanced over. His first button was undone,revealing two hickeys.

Dennis turned his head to stifle a laugh. Jonathan and Kathie had really
gone wild.

Kathie gritted her teeth. glared at him, and grabbed the tie, tying it tightly on purpose. Jonathan didn't get angry; he just stared at her intently. "You smell nice."

"Stop talking."

"Whatever you say."

Jonathan was in a great mood after their night together.

Kenna,who had just recovered, didn't like noise, so Flynn had booked the entire restaurant. When Jonathan and the others arrived, they were chatting and laughing in the garden.

Flynn gave Jonathan a disdainful look, but his face wore a fake smile."Mr.Berkeley,you're here."

Jonathan nodded. "Mr. Campbell, youpicked a beautiful place."

Flynn replied, "It's all for Mrs. Roberts. This place is far from the city's hustle and bustle and has many interesting activities."

Kenna looked at Kathie and waved gently. "Ms. Cavendish, thank you so much for your help yesterday. I'm feeling much better now."

Kathie smiled. "No need to thank me, Mrs. Roberts. You should still rest for the next couple of days. I'll give you some herbal medicine to help you relax and recover."


Kenna was grateful. "Thank you, Ms. Cavendish. I didn't expect you to be so skilled in medicine, even though you're just a secretary."


.Austin also praised her. "We were planning to go back, but thanks to Ms.
Cavendish,my wife is safe and sound. I owe you."
Kathie nodded. "No need to thank me. Mr. Roberts. It was all Mr. Berkeley's arrangement. He knew Mrs. Roberts was pregnant and worried about her traveling. He knew I had medical skills, so he arranged for me to be here just in case."


Austin gave Jonathan a grateful look. "Mr. Berkeley, you're very thoughtful.11


Jonathan hadn't expected Kathie to give himn the credit, but it helped him out.


He smiled slightly. "It was the right thing to do."

Flynn gritted his teeth. He hadn't expected Jonathan, who was in a wheelchair,to be so capable. He had quickly won over Kenna, and Kathie,his secretary, was also very impressive. He needed to find a way to get rid of her.

Flynn quickly interjected, "There's a large pond of water lilies ahead. The scenery is beautiful. I've booked three small boats for us to enjoy the view."

Kenna was very interested. "On the way here, I saw water lilies everywhere.
They're so beautifu1. We don't get to see so many in our country. This is a dream come true. Mr. Campbell, you thought of everything."

Flynn beamed. "We live ín a noisy city. It's good to return to nature and relax,especially for a pregnant woman."

Austin was also pleased. "Mr, Campbell, you've arranged everything perfectly. My wife loves this."

Flynn looked at Jonathan, a smile playing on his lips. "I always take good care of my guests. Let's go. The weather is perfect."

Kenna looked excited. It was clear she was very happy.
Jonathan frowned slightly. Flynn was doing a good job of pleasing Austin.Right now, they were both equally important to Austin. Jonathan needed to find a way to win him over and not let Flynn get ahead.

Kathie pushed the wheelchair, admiring the vibrant water lilies and the many vintage buildings. It was no wonder Kenna loved it; even she was enchanted.
###Chapter 90 Her Beauty Outshines the Flovers
Jonathan cleared his throat to get her attention. "Kathie, don't get too lost in the view. Remember, we're here to impress the clients."

Kathie nodded. "I knoww, that's why I backed you up earlier."

Jonathan could be such a stickler. With such beautíful scenery right in front of them,why not enjoy it?

Flynn had rented a small boat that could only fit two people. He was at the front with Eleanor, Austin and his wife were in the middle,and Dennis helped Jonathan onto the boat, leaving him to wait on the shore.

Dennis said. "Mr. Berkeley, be careful!"

Jonathan nodded. "Stay on standby."

Kathie found the boat's paddles fascinating. Ever since she had her three kids. she had been so busy that she never had time for herself.

Seeing her so happy, Jonathan sighed. "Since we're here, enjoy yourself.If you like these flowers, you can take some home."

Kathie beamed. "I'll bring some back for my three little ones."

"They've all set off. Let's get ready."

Kathie happily started paddling, and Jonathan handed her a water lily.

Kathie looked at him in surprise. "Is this for me?"

Jonathan frowned. "Of course. It's just the two of us on this boat."

Kathie brought the flower to her nose and inhaled deeply. "It smells wonderful. It's been so long since I've smelled something so natural."
Jonathan watched her, the water lily in her hand making her look even more beautiful. Her beauty outshines the blossoms.

Feeling Jonathan's intense gaze. Kathie turned around slowly, her heart pounding.


The boat drifted into the pond, surrounded by lilies, making it feel like they were the only two people in the world.

"Kathie, I'mn giving you three seconds to prepare. I'm going to kiss you."

Kathie's heart skipped a beat. The next second, Jonathan cupped her face and kissed her. His tongue parted her lips, touching her soft tongue,bringing back memories from the night before.

Kathie tried to pull away, but he held her neck, preventing her escape.

Jonathan deepened the kiss until Kathie was breathless.

Looking at her flushed cheeks, Jonathan licked his lips meaningfully."Sweet."


KKathie blushed even more, grabbing the paddle to hide her embarrassment.
"Let's get going. We don't know where they went."

Jonathan could tell she didn't mind, maybe even enjoyed it, but she was too stubborn to admit it.


He was determined to make her say it out loud.

Kathie noticed something was wrong with the boat. No matter how they paddled, the boat kept veering off course,leading them into the densest part of the lilies.

Kathie decided to change tactics. "Maybe our technique is off. I'll paddle first, then you follow with more force,"
Jonathan, unfamiliar with boating, followed her lead.

But no matter how hard they tried, the boat just spun in circles.
Something was definitely wrong.

"This boat has a problem."

Jonathan frowned. "It seems like they left us behind on purpose."

Kathie inspected the boat and found it was taking on water. The seat she was on felt loose. "This boat is faulty. We need to get back immediately."

Jonathan pulled out his phone to call Dennis, but Kathie's seat suddenly gave way, and she fell into the water with a splash.

The pond was deep, and Kathie couldn't swim. She flailed desperately."Help! I can't swim..."

Jonathan shouted towards the shore. "Someone fell in! We need help!"

Dennis heard the commotion and ran towards them. "Mr. Berkeley, Ms.Cavendish,where are you?"

Kathie was coughing uncontrollably after choking on water. "Help..."

Jonathan raised his hand. "We're over here! Hurry!"

Flynn and the others turned around at the sound of the cries for help.
Flynn feigned surprise. "What's going on? Who fell in?"

Austin and his wife turned back, realizing Jonathan wasn't wvith them.Kenna said worriedly, "It sounds like Mr. Berkeley. Could Ms. Cavendish have fallen in?"


Austin nodded. "It seems so." He waved to the people on shore,signaling them to help.
Flynn called out insincerely,"Are there any rescue personnel? Someone get in the water!"


He had already sent the rescue team away. Jonathan, with his injured leg,couldn't swim. Once Kathie was out of the picture, their plan would go smoothly.

Dennis and the rescue team jumped into the water, but the dense lilies slowed them down.


Seeing Kathie sinking, Jonathan couldn't wait any longer. He jumped in,using all his strength to push her back onto the boat,leaving himself hanging onto the side.

Kathie gasped for air, coughing as she regained her senses. Seeing Jonathan half-submerged, she reached out to pull him up, but he stopped her."Don't move. This boat is unstable. If you shake it, it'll fall apart."

Kathie was worried. "But your leg is injured."

Thinking about how he had risked everything to save her and now gave her the only safe spot, Kathie's heart melted.

No one had ever treated her so well, giving her the best of everything.

Jonathan laughed heartily. "It's fine. You're a great doctor. You can just treat me again."

Kathie's nose tingled. "How can you joke ata time like this?"

Jonathan shook the water from his forehead, his hair clinging to his chiseled features, water streaming down his body, making him look irresistibly attractive.

They locked eyes, sharing a moment only they understood.



Dennis said."Mr. Berkoleu Me. Carendish we're herel"
Jonathan called out. "Over here!"

Dennis and the rescue team arrived, quickly pulling Jonathan onto the boat and covering them with blankets as they headed back to shore.

Flynn's boat returned as well. Seeing Kathie safe, he narrowed his eyes.How was she still alive?


Jonathan glared at Flynn. "Mr. Campbell, I'd like to know why our boat had such issues. If I couldn't swim, Kathie would have drowned."

Flynn was puzzled. Wasn't Jonathan supposed to be unable to stand? How did he manage to save her?


Feigning innocence, Flynn said, "Mr. Berkeley, I have no idea how this happened. The boats were chosen randomly. It must have been due to old age. Don't blame me."

Jonathan gritted his teeth. "I'll get to the bottom of this. For now, I need to take Kathie to change. We'll be back later."

Kenna nodded worriedly. "Go ahead. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital.Ms. Cavendish must be okay. We'll wait for you."


Jonathan shot Flynn a warning look as he led Kathie away. If anything happened to her. Flynn would pay.
###Chapter 91 JIonathan Falls in Love

Kathie sat in the car,shivering. Jonathan wrapped her in a towel and held her close.


"Feeling any better? Still cold?" he asked.

Kathie sighed, "Ever since I met you, I've been running into all sorts of problems. Even my health is getting worse."

Jonathan chuckled, "Maybe you're just getting older."

Kathie shot him a deådly glare. "If you can't say anything nice,just zip it."

Jonathan immediately shut his mouth. Dennis, who was driving, stifled a laugh. It was the first time he'd seen Jonathan so afraid of a woman.Usually, everyone was terrified of Jonathan. When he got angry, no one
dared to speak.

But now, Jonathan was completely under this woman's thumb.It seemed he had fallen in love.

Despite Kathie's harsh words, Jonathan still held her close to keep her warm.


"If I get sick, it should count as a work injury. You owe me compensation for emotional distress," she said.

Jonathan nodded indulgently. "I'Il cover it all."

Kathie felt a warmth in her heart, thinking about how he had risked his life to save her. Even though he could stand, swimming in the water must have been incredibly painful for him. Yet, he had come for her,letting her take his place while hestayed in the water. If he didn't love her, he wouldn't have gone to such lengths.
wondered how Jonathan was doing. With Dennis taking care of him,he should be fine.


Kathie knocked on his door to check on him, only to find him sitting in his wheelchair, still in his wet clothes.

"Jonathan, are you nuts? Why haven't you taken a shower?" she exclaimed,rushing over.


Jonathan gave a bitter smile. "I can't stand up to reach the showerhead."

Kathie was speechless. "Where's Dennis? Even if he's not here, you could at least change out of your wet clothes and wrap yourself in a blanket.
How can you sit like this? It's freezing. Come on, take them off."

As she helped him out of his wet clothes, she blushed at the sight of the red marks all over his body. She felt embarrassed,realizing how,much she had scratched him.


"Are you shy?" Jonathan teased.

"Say one more word, and I'll ignore you," Kathie warned.

Jonathan nodded obediently. "I sent Dennis to investigate the ship to prevent Flynn from destroying evidence. As for why I didn't change,I wanted you to help me. I didn't get into bed because I was too dirty."

Kathie sighed. "Your health is more important right now. Don't worry about being dirty."

Jonathan looked at her. "Alright, I'll listen to you from now on."

Kathie rolled her eyes and filled the bathtub with hot water, helping him in with her eyes closed.

Jonathan joked, "You don't need to close your eyes. You've already seen
"One more word, and IIl make you mute,"' she threatened.

"If you can bear it, I don't mind," he replied.

Kathie opened her eyes to glare at him but quickly looked away,embarrassed by what she saw in the tub. "I'll go find you some clothes."

Jonathan smiled, knowing Kathie cared about him.

At Saint Charles Memorial Hospital, Patricia picked up the DNA report for Kathie's three children and Jonathan. She had always thought the kids looked too much like Jonathan. Initially, she suspected they were Harold's children, but there was no connection between him and Kathie.

She had arranged for a housekeeper at Maple Grove Residence to get Jonathan's hair and toothbrusha for the test. Patricia was determined to find out if the kids were related to Jonathan.

Taking a deep breath, she opened the report. Seeing the 99% match,her mind went blank. "How is this possible? Jonathan is really the father?"

Patricia remembered Jonathan being drugged at a hotel years ago. He had been with a college student hired to entertain him. Jonathan had left the room with some awareness, ending up in someone else's room. Patricia had to pay off the student to keep her quiet. It wasn't Kathie.

What had gone wrong? Could it have been Kathie that night?

Jonathan and Kathie didn't know about this. Patricia couldn't let anyone find out. She needed to find that college student to understand what happened.

The thought of the kids being Jonathan's made Patricia tremble. If the Berkeley family found out, they'd welcome Kathie back with open arms,and Patricia would lose her chance.
No way. She had loved Jonathan for too long to let anyone else have him.

That evening at the restaurant, Austin had called to teIl Jonathan they didn't need to come. suggesting they rest after their ordeal. But Jonathan couldn't let them meet alone, unsure of what tricks Flynn might pull. He needed to keep an eye on things.


"Ms. Cavendish, you look unwell but still came. You're dedicated. Mr.Berkeley doesn't seem to care about you, making you come out to drink. If it were me. I wouldn't let you," Flynn said, trying to stir trouble.

Kathie smiled knowingly. "I'm fine. Mr. Berkeley was worried about Mrs.
Roberts and wanted me to be here to help."

Austin, grateful, said, "Mr. Berkeley is very considerate. I toast to you.
Knowing your condition, you can drink tea instead."

Jonathan raised his teacup. "It's our duty. Once I'm better, we'll have a proper drink."

Kenna smiled. "Ms. Cavendish's remedy was delicious and helped with my nausea. Your medical skills are impressive."

Kathie responded warmly, "It's my honor to help. If you need anything,just ask. I have experience with children and can answer any questions."

Kenna beamed. "That's wonderful. We're new parents and often overwhelmed. You've solved a big problem for us."

Jonathan gave Kathie an approving look. "Eldoria is a beautiful place. Mrs.Roberts should visit when you can."

"Absolutely. I have many questions for Ms. Cavendish. I'm lucky to have met her," Kenna said, full of admiration.

Flynn seethed. He hadn't expected Kathie, a mere secretary,to steal the
spotlight. He needed to get rid of her to succeed in this project.
###Chapter 92 Setting a Trap for Her

Flynn poured a glass of wine for Kathie, saying. "Ms. Cavendish, I'm really sorry about what happened today. It was totally my fault you ended up in the water. I'll drink three glasses as a penalty and hope you can forgive me."


Flynn downed three glasses in quick succession. Even though Kathie didn't want to forgive him, she had to play nice with Austin around.

Kathie replied. "It was just an accident. No hard feelings, Flynn."

Kathie picked up her glass to drink, but Jonathan gently stopped her."If you can't handle alcohol, don't push it."

Kathie smiled, her eyes sparkling. "It's just one glass. I'll be fine."

"Better safe than sorry," Jonathan said, worried she might not be feeling well after the fall.

Flynn jumped in, "Jonathan, what's that supposed to mean? Are you still mad at me? Or do you think three glasses aren't enough? I can drink two more if that'll help."

He pretended to be hurt and poured himself more wine.

Kenna added, "Mr. Berkeley, Mr. Campbell picked this place today to accommodate my condition. Please cut him some slack."

Jonathan let go of Kathie's hand, and she said, "Mrs. Roberts, Mr.Berkeleyis not mad at Flynn. He's just worried about my health and doesn't want me to drink."

Kenna looked concerned. "Kathie, are you sure you're okay?"

"I'm fine now. Let's use this glass of wine to put today's mess behind us,"
Flynn smiled, satisfied. "Ms. Cavendish, you're a straight shooter. Let's keep drinking."

Flynn enthusiastically introduced the evening's special dishes and had even prepared a special meal for KKenna, who was pregnant. It was clear that Kenna and her husband appreciated the gesture.

Kathie had expected Flynn to keep pushing drinks on them, but he didn't.Instead, he politely encouraged them to enjoy the food.

Kathie exchanged a glance with Jonathan, puzzled by Flynn's behavior.Sometimes, the most dangerous people were those who hid their true intentions.


Just when Kathie thought the dinner was about to end, Austin suddenly clutched his head in pain.

"Sweetheart, what's wrong?" Kenna asked, concerned.

Flynn also looked worried. "Mr. Roberts, you okay?"

Austin rubbed his temples. "I don't know. I suddenly have a headache."

Kenna held his hand. "Let me help you back to the room to rest."

Flynn stood up. "Mrs. Roberts, don't worry. Ms. Cavendish knows medicine. Let her help Mr. Roberts with some acupuncture. I also prepared a medicinal meal that's good for your baby."

Hearing that it was beneficial for the baby, Austin held Kenna's hand."Sweetheart, don't worry. Ms. Cavendish can help me."

As a doctor, Kathie didn't think twice.

She looked at Jonathan, who seemed worried. She smiled reassuringly. "It's okay. I'll help Mr. Roberts and be back soon."

Jonathan frowned but saw how unwell Austin looked and nodded. They couldn't ignore someone in need after making such a big deal about it earlier.

Kathie helped Austin back to his room, noticing a peculiar scent she had never smelled before. It was strange, but she focused on checking Austin's pulse and found he had food poisoning.

This was odd. They had all eaten the same food. How could he be poisoned?


Unless he had an allergy that caused a reaction when combined with something he ate.


But Flynn was so careful. He wouldn't make such a mistake,especially not with Austin. It must be a coincidence.


Kathie took out her acupuncture needles and treated him. After five minutes,Austin's condition improved. Seeing him calm down, Kathie sighed in relief. "Austin, how do you feel now?"


Austin loosened his tie, breathing heavily. "I feel hot and my chest is tight."

Hearing this, Kathie also felt hot and her chest tight. Could she have caught something from him?

Kathie unbuttoned his shirt to help him breathe,but he suddenly grabbed her waist and pulled her close. "Sweetheart, you smell so good."

He leaned in to kiss her. Kathie tried to push him away but found herself weak.


What was happening? She felt dizzy and saw Jonathan instead of Austin holding her.

"Seven, are you trying to mess around again?"Kathie said.
Realizing something was wrong, she shook her head hard, and Austin reappeared.

"Sweetheart, I want you." Austin's eyes were filled with desire, and he tried to undress her.


This was terrifying. Kathie struggled to break free and fell to the floor,her legs weak.


She noticed the incense on the table, realizing it was causing hallucinations.

Who would be so malicious to put this in his room? This wasn't for Austin and Kenna to spice things up. It was a trap for her.

Kathie said ina a panic, "Mr. Roberts, stay calm. There's something wrong with the incense."


Austin's face was flushed, his eyes dazed. He couldn't control himself.

Kathie's heart raced as she saw Austin turn into Jonathan again, igniting a fire inside her.


Austin crawled towards her, making seductive sounds. "Sweetheart, I want to kiss you. Come here."

Kathie couldn't resist raising her hand. As they were about to touch,she quickly used her needle to stab Austin's neck.

"Sorry!" She then used another needle to make him pass out.

Next, Kathie used the needles on herself, calming her body down.

No wonder Flynn insisted she bring Austin back. He was setting her up.

If she had slept with Austin, Kenna would hate Jonathan, and they would never work together again.
Flynn would get rid of her and achieve his goal.

Kathie struggled to get Austin onto the bed. She knew Flynn would soon bring Kenna to catch them. She had to leave quickly.

Kathie opened the door and slipped into the room across the hall.

At the dining table. Flynn checked the time and pretended to be puzzled."It's been twenty minutes. Why haven't Mr. Roberts and Ms. Cavendish returned? Could it be serious?"

He didn't imply they were having an affair, avoiding suspicion by focusing on Austin's health.


Hearing this, Kenna stood up, worried. "I'll go check on themn."

Flynn smiled. "We'll go with you. If there's a problem, we can help."

Jonathan sensed something was off. Flynn was up to something. He quickly had Dennis push him along.
###Chapter 93 Plan Failed

Kenna looked worried, and Flynn tried to reassure her, "Mr. Roberts is probably just wiped out, which is why he's got a headache. Ms. Cavendish is a top-notch doctor; I'm sure everything will be fine."

"I trust Dr. Cavendish, but it's been so long without any news. It's weird,"Kenna said, her concern clear. As a wife, how could she not worry about her husband being alone in a room with a beautiful secretary?

Flynn nodded, "You're right. If Dr. Cavendish had any issues, she should've told us. This silence makes it seem like something's up."

Flynn was deliberately stirring up anxiety, hoping that Kenna would be even more upset when she saw the compromising scene he had set up.

Jonathan, overhearing their conversation, had a hunch about what was going on. He pulled out his phone to message Kathie, but there was no response, which made him uneasy.


Someone as responsible as Kathie shouldn't be gone for so long without any word. Could something have really happened?


Kathie was still in the room, snacking. Hearing some noise, she peeked through the door and saw Flynn leading Kenna and Jonathan towards them, clearly ready to catch someone in the act.

As they reached the door, Kenna took a deep breath and opened it, only to find the room in complete darkness.

Flynn smirked, "Why are the lights off? Could it be they're doing something they don't want us to see?"

Kenna, with a stern face, turned on the lights. Flynn was expecting to see a scandalous scene, but instead, there was only Austin, fully clothed and asleep under the covers.
"What the heck?" Flynn muttered in disbelief.

Jonathan sighed in relief and asked, "MIr. Campbell, what did you expect to see?"


Flynn quickly covered, "I meant, why is Mr. Roberts alone? Where's Dr.Cavendish?"


Kenna was also curious, but just then, Kathie's voice came from the doorway, "Looking for me?"

Everyone turned to see Kathie holding a tray with a bowl of medicinal soup. She explained, "Mr. Roberts had food poisoning. I went to get some herbs to make this remedy. I hope you're not upset, Mrs. Roberts."

Seeing how dedicated Kathie was to taking care of Austin, Kenna felt guilty for her earlier suspicions.

She replied, "Dr. Cavendish, how could I be upset? Thank you so much."

Kathie smiled gently, "Mr. Berkeley instructed me to do my best. Unlike some people who didn't even know Mr. Roberts' allergens, causing his poisoning."

Flynn's face darkened. He had hoped to ruin Kathie's reputation, but instead, she had gained Kenna's favor and put him in a tough spot.

Kenna turned to Flynn, "Mr. Campbell, I remember our secretary specifically told you that Austin is allergic to soy products."

Flynn's face went pale, "I'm well aware. There were no soy products in tonight's dishes."

Kathie interjected, "I'm certain Mr. Roberts' reaction was due to something he ate. If Mrs. Roberts doesn't believe me, I can inspect the food to find the cause."
Flynn gritted his teeth. He hadn't expected Kathie to be so capable.

He couldn't let her investigate, so he lied, "It must've been a mistake by the kitchen staff. I'll go check it out. You stay here and take care of Mr.Roberts."


Jonathan added, "Mr. Campbell, make sure to investigate thoroughly. We can't have this happen again."

Seeing Kenna's displeased expression, Flynn knew he was in trouble.

"I'll give you a satisfactory explanation, Mrs. Roberts," Flynn said before leaving with Eleanor, his face livid.

Kathie brought the medicine to Austin, removed the silver needles from his head, and he groggily woke up, not remembering what had happened.

"Honey,why are you all here? Did something happen?"

Kenna sighed in relief, "You had an allergic reaction. Dr. Cavendish has been treating you."

Kathie handed him the medicine, "Mr. Roberts, drink this and get some rest. You'll feel better in the morning."

After drinking the mnedicine, Austin felt a bit better and said, "Even a trace of soy products gives me a headache. This allergy has troubled me for over twenty years."

Kathie checked his pulse, "Mr. Roberts, I can cure your allergy."

Austin and Kenna looked at her in disbelief. Austin asked, "You can cure it? We've tried treatments in several countries. Doctors were hopeful at first,but nothing worked."

Kathie confidently replied, "I saved MIr. Berkeley when he was at death's door. An allergy is nothing in comparison. I'm certain I can cure you."
Jonathan, knowing Kathie's abilities, said, "If she says she can do it. there's no doubt."

Austin was amazed. "Mr. Berkeley, if she can cure my allergy, our cooperation is guaranteed."

Jonathan smiled, "Then it's settled. Get some rest, and we'll leave you to it."Kathie nodded and wheeled Jonathan out.

In the hallway, Jonathan's expression turned serious, "Tell me,what really happened?"

Kathie sighed, "I almost lost my virtue. Luckily, I reacted in time.Otherwise, you would have found me and Mr. Roberts in a compromising position."


Jonathan's face darkened as he gripped the wheelchair. Kathie looked at him curiously, but he pulled her into his arms.

He inhaled her unique scent, feeling a surge of emotion. "What do you mean by that? Were you two in bed together? Did he touch you?"


Kathie pushed him away, "Calm down and let me explain. When I took Mr. Roberts back, someone had placed an aphrodisiac incense in his room,trying to make us... you know."

Jonathan's eyes narrowed. No wonder Flynn had said those things;he had expected to find them in bed.

Kathie continued, "I realized what was happening and used silver needles to block his acupoints, then detoxified myself and hid to observe. Shortly after,you all arrived."

Jonathan felt a chill at the thought. Flynn had used such despicable means against Kathie. He said coldly,′′I′V've heard that aphrodisiac incense is
potent. Once affected, there's no escape."

Kathie waved it off. "It is strong, but he's not you. Even dazed, I knew what was happening."

Jonathan raised an eyebrow. a slight smile on his lips. "So, if it were me.you wouldn't be able to resist and would...?"

Kathie fell silent.


Even in such a situation, he could say something so shameless.
###Chapter 94 Falling from the Sky

Jonathan immediately regretted his words when he saw her getting angry.

He quickly said. "I was just making a comparison, no big deal. You haven't given me my treatment today. Let's head back to the hotel."


Kathie noticed he was getting bolder, saying whatever popped into his head in front of her.


She couldn't let him get too comfortable, or he'd walk all over her in the future.


"Yeah, it's time for your treatment."

Jonathan had a bad feeling about this. Her tone didn't sound promising.

Back at the hotel, Kathie took a black pill from her bag, placed it in a bowl,and dissolved it in hot water. The strong medicinal smell quickly filled the room.


Jonathan was all too familiar with it; it was the medicine Kathie usually made him drink.


He thought he could escape it for a few days since they left in a hurry yesterday.How did she manage to bring the pills?

"Dr. Cavendish, where did you get this pill?"

Kathie pointed to the ceiling, and Jonathan was puzzled. "It fell from the sky,"she said.

Jonathan fell silent.

She was definitely angry. He needed to find a way to appease her.

"When we get back, I'll buy you a car. It'll be easier for you to get to work
and pick up the kids."

"No need!"

"The Cavendish Mansion is a bit far from the school. I'll buy a house near the school so the kids can get to and from school more conveniently."

"Not necessary!"

When she turned down his gifts, it was a clear indication that trouble was brewing.


Jonathan saw her také out acupuncture needles and swrallowed nervously."
Dr. Cavendish, you wouldn't take personal revenge, would you?"

"Of course I would. It's not the first time. What, are you scared now? I thought you were invincible, that nothing in the world could restrain you."

Jonathan gave an awkward smile. "I was just joking before. I was worried about your safety."


To others,Jonathan was always seen as a reserved man, never getting close to women, let alone flirting with them.

But with Kathie,he couldn't control himself.

Now he had made her angry, and he was going to pay for it.

Kathie added some powder to the bowl and handed it to him with a mischievous smile. "Mr. Berkeley, don't worry. I'm not that petty. This is your medicine for today. Drink it quickly, and then I'll give you acupuncture."


Jonathan felt a bit scared by her tone.

"What did you just add? It's not poison, is it?"
"I'm not that stupid. Poisoning is illegal, and I still have kids to raise."

Jonathan took the bowl and drank it under her urging gaze. It was the most bitter medicine he had ever tasted, almost numbing his senses.

Kathie kindly handed him a glass of water, which he drank quickly, but it didn't help much.

"What did you make me drink?"

Kathie smiled. "Don't worry. It's just a concentrated Artemisia powder I developed recently. It's a hundred times more potent than the original.I was thinking of testing it, and today was the perfect opportunity. For the next week, everything you eat will taste bitter. This is your punishment for talking nonsense."


She was so petty. He had only said a few words, and she punished him like this.


Seeing her smug look, Jonathan's heart hardened. He pulled her close and kissed her.


Kathie widened her eyes, but before she could react, Jonathan had pried her mouth open, his tongue invading hers, spreading the bitter taste.

Kathie squinted, trying to push him away, but the strength difference between men and women was too great. Jonathan held her on his lap,kissing her fiercely, transferring all the bitter medicine into her mouth.

"So bitter, Jonathan, you jerk!"


As Kathie opened her mouth, Jonathan took the opportunity to suck on her tongue, making her taste the bitterness.

'Kathie's initial resistance gave way to a hesitant response as his tender kisses sent a wave of warmth through her.
As Kathie melted into his kiss, Jonathan gently pulled her onto his lap.Their gazes locked briefly, and without speaking,they kissed once more.

Kathie was fully conscious now, Jonathan's large hand slipping under her shirt, caressing her smooth back.

Kathie's eyes were hazy, completely under his control.

Jonathan unclasped her bra, quickly cupping her firm breasts,kneading them. Seeing her lost in pleasure, Jonathan lifted her arms. "Dr. Cavendish,you're not drunk now. See clearly what I'm doing. Don't deny it later."

As he finished speaking, he buried his head in her neck, kissing down to her chest, then biting her supple breast.

Kathie's heart skipped a beat, snapping back to reality. She pushed him away and stood up, quickly fixing her disheveled clothes, her face full of tension and embarrassment.


She wasn't uasually this impulsive. Why did she always lose control around Jonathan,her heart racing uncontrollably?

"You agreed to date me last night. We're just doing what,couples do. You don't need to feel burdened."


"I didn't agree," Kathie denied.

Jonathan's face darkened. "Do you really not remember, or are you pretending? Is it so hard to admit you love me?"

Kathie, flustered, quickly changed the subject. "Lie down. I'll give you acupuncture."

Jonathan frowned. She was more honest when drunk. When sober,she wasn't as cute.

He lay down angrily, and Kathie sighed. "Take off your pants."
Jonathan grumbled, "You usually do it."

Kathie gritted her teeth. Fine, she'd do it. She had ignited his desire and then avoided it, leaving him in discomfort.

Kathie removed his pants, blushing at the sight of his erection pressing against his underwear.

"Put your pajama pants on."

"Dr. Cavendish, you're so strange. Before we had sex, you didn't say anything when I was naked. Why are you shy now?"

Kathie tried to stay calm. "Isn't the medicine bitter enough?"


Jonathan teased, "You know how bitter it is. You had quite a bit yourself."

Kathie blushed. "If you keep provoking me, don't blame me if I miss a needle."


Jonathan was unfazed. "You said you wouldn't miss even with your eyes closed, unless you did it on purpose. Besides, if you mess up, I'll just stay with you for life."

Kathie wavered. Did he really want to spend his life with her?

He didn't mind her three kids now, but if they were together, they'd likely have their own children. Would he still love her kids then?


Kathie couldn't even be sure herself. How could she rely on someone else?

Seeing her lost in thought, Jonathan encouraged her. "I hope you can be honest with your feelings. Don't overthink it. Life is short. Why make it so hard for yourself? I've faced death once. Now I just want to cherish the present."

Kathie's eyes sparkled. Jonathan looked at her seriously. "I truly like you."
###Chapter 95 Taking Care of Children is More Exhausting Than Working
Kathie could feel Jonathan's deep affection, but now wasn't the time for romance. She changed the subject. "So, are you planning to let this go?"

Jonathan raised an eyebrow and smiled. She still wasn't ready to face his feelings head-on. No matter, he had plenty of time to make her admit it herself.


"Not a chance. I never let things slide."

Kathie thought for a moment. "How about wve use his own methods against him?"


Jonathan played along. "What do you have in mind?"

"Did you notice something off between Flynn and Ms. Mitchell? They were giving each other looks, and when we boarded the ship this afternoon,I saw a lot of red marks on her neck."

"Like the ones on you?"

"Bring that up again and I'm out of here."

Jonathan quickly apologized. "MMy bad. Go on."

"I looked into Flynn. He's reliant on his wife's family for power, and she controls the finances. Word is, she's a tough woman who keeps him on a short leash. What do you think would happen if she found out her husband was cheating?"


Kathie was still furious at Flynn for trying to harm them multiple times and nearly ruining her reputation. She had to get back at him.

Jonathan gave her a thumbs-up. "That's a great idea. I'll have Dennis pull
the surveillance footage. With that evidence, let's see how cocky he can be."

Kathie nodded. "Get Dennis on it quickly before Flynn deletes the videos."

Jonathan immediately instructed Dennis to handle it, but all the footage from the previous day had already been erased. Flynn hadn't left any evidence behind.

Kathie scoffed. "Flynn must be a repeat offender. He probably deletes the evidence right after every time to avoid getting caught by his wife."

"Looks like it. He's covered his tracks too well. We're at a dead end."

Kathie pondered for a moment. She couldn't let Flynn get away with this.

"Who says we're at a dead end? Call Ben on video."

"Why?"

Kathie smiled. "You don't know how talented my three kids are. Kyle's
hacking skills are top-notch. He can recover the deleted footage."

Jonathan smiled proudly. "They're amazing. I'm impressed."

"Call them now, before it's their bedtime," Kathie urged.

Jonathan quickly sent a video call request to Ben. When Ben answered,three adorable faces crowded the screen.


"Seven, can you see us?"


Even Kathie couldn't resist their cuIteness, and Jonathan was equally smitten.


Jonathan smiled. "I can see you. What are you up to?"

Eileen held up some playdough, smiling. "Seven, we're making clay figures today, but we're not very good at it."
Jonathan smiled warmly."Let Ben help you." Then he turned to Ben."Ben, make sure they finish their project. If they don't pass tomorrow,you'Il be signing up for a training class."

Ben was silent.

He was exhausted. Taking care of the kids and studying child psychology in his spare time was more tiring than work. He'd rather be traveling with Jonathan for business than dealing with these three little bosses.

Ben asked, "Got it. Mr. Berkeley. I'll do my best. When are you coming back?"

He didn't need the kids to ask; he wanted Jonathan and Kathie back as soon as possible.

Jonathan replied, "If all goes well, we should be back tomorrow night."

Kathie took the phone. "Kyle, come here. Mommy needs your help with something."

Kyle immediately got serious, signaling his siblings to be quiet. His leadership impressed Kathie.

"Mommy,what do you need?"

"I'm sending you an address. I need the surveillance footage from there.How long will it take you to recover it?"

"Ten minutes should be enough.".

"Kyle, you're amazing. Thank you. Mommy will be waiting for your message."

"Okay, I'll send it to your phone once it's done."

Kathie watched him work, marveling at how mature he was.
Tha..Jonathan was curious. "Did Kyle study hacking professionally?"

Kathie nodded. "He met a hacking expert abroad. Despite their age difference, they hit it off, and the expert taught him some techniques. Kyle learned everything and practices at home every day."

Jonathan smiled. "He's like me, quick to learn."

Kathie laughed. "Are you praising yourself? My kids have been smart since they were little. They must have inherited their dad's genes,though I have no idea who he is..."

Seeing Jonathan's displeased expression, Kathie awkwardly stopped. She couldn't be blamed for not knowing who the father was after being drugged all those years ago.

The tension was broken when Kyle sent the recovered footage.

As Kathie suspected, Flynn and Eleanor were having an affair. The footageclearly showed Eleanor knocking on Flynn's hotel room door and Flynn leaving with her the next morning, even kissing her at the door.

No wonder Flynn was so quick to delete the footage. If his wife saw it, she'd tear hím apart.

"Now that we have this, should we threaten him directly?"

Jonathan shook his head. "Not yet. This video is useful to me. I need to find out who leaked my company's bottom line."

He had his suspicions,but he needed to confirm them.

In the next room, Flynn was pacing, furious. "You said it was foolproof!Why wasn't Kathie in the room? I wanted to drive a wedge between her and Austin, but now their relationship is stronger."

Flynn had hoped to ruin Kathie's chances, but it backfired.
Eleanor was exasperated. "I didn't expect Kathie to be fine. We should have just knocked her out and put her on the bed."

"It's too late now. We need to win over Mr. Roberts. If we can't, we'll use any means necessary. I need that contract."

Eleanor suggested, "Mr. Campbell, how about we get him drunk, and I'll take some compromising photos with him? We can use them to blackmail him."

Flynn smiled, pinching her cheek. "Why didn't I think of that? I should have sent you to his bedfrom the start."

"Mr. Campbell, would you really send me to him?"

Flynn hugged her waist. "I don't want to, but for our future, you need to make some sacrifices. Once we have something on Mr. Roberts,he'll have to cooperate."


Flynn regretted focusing on punishing Kathie. If he'd known it would turn out like this, he would have sent Eleanor to Austin's bed. But now,they'd missed the perfect opportunity.
###Chapter 96 The Marketplace is Like a Battlefi eld
Eleanor wrapped her arms around Flynn's neck. "I'm willing to sacrifice for you, but don't forget my kindness."

Flynn pulled her closer, his hand slipping under her shirt. "Don't worry,babe. You'll get your share."

Just as Flynn leaned in to kiss her, his phone rang, startling him. He quickly stood up and saw it was Jonathan calling. He frowned immediately.What could Jonathan want at this hour?

Clearing his throat, Flynn answered the call. "Jonathan, what's up? It's pretty late."

"Flynn, I need you to come to my room. We have something to discuss."

"I don't think there's anything to discuss between us."

"If you don't come,you'll regret it."

Flynn narrowed his eyes. What did Jonathan mean by that?-He decided to go and see what Jonathan was up to.

He grabbed Eleanor's chin. "Wait for me, babe. I'll be back after I deal with him."


Flynn arrived at Jonathan's room and got straight to the point. "Alright,Jonathan,what's this about?"

Jonathan took a sip of tea, smiling. "Flynn, business is like war, and everyone relies on their skills. But your methods are a bit too much."

Flynn feigned confusion. "I don't get what you're talking about."

Jonathan chuckled. "If vou don't understand, let me explain. You
tampered with the ship, trying to harm me and Kathie."

Flynn's eyes flashed with panic but quickly regained his composure. "That s nonsense. The store already said it was their issue. Don't accuse me without proof."

Jonathan nodded. "Then what about the hallucinogenic scent in Mr.Roberts' room? You personally arranged that room. The scent didn't just walk in on its own."

Flynn raised his head, denying everything. "Jonathan, you need evidence for such claims. No one will believe you without proof."

Jonathan smirked coldly and handed Flynn his phone. "Flynn, you covered your tracks well, but I have this."

Flynn remained indifferent. Without evidence, Jonathan's words were useless.


He calmly picked up the phone, but his eyes widened in shock at the video playing on the screen. "How... howdo you have this?"

Flynn had instructed his assistant to clean up the video thoroughly, and his assistant had assured him there would be no traces left. But Jonathan's video clearly showed Flynn and Eleanor entering the room and kissing. If his fierce wife saw this, she would skin him alive.


Jonathan raised an eyebrow, smiling. "Flynn, you must be wondering how I got this video after you had it cleaned up. I'm curious too. If your wife saw this, would she be furious?"


Flynn swallowed nervously, trying to stay calm, "We were just discussing work. Even if my wife saw it, she wouldn't be angry."

Kathie couldn't help but tease. "You and Eleanor seem to have a great relationship. Discussing work all night and kissing in the morning? I bet
your wife would be just as curious as I am."

Flynn gritted his teeth in anger. "Jonathan, this is beneath you.How can someone of your stature use such tactics to force me out?"

Jonathan laughed. "Now you think I'm noble? Fine. Just tell me who leaked my company's bottom price to you1,and I'll delete the video."

Flynn hesitated. He had worked hard to connect with someone inside the Berkeley Family. If he revealed the source, they would never forgive him.

Jonathan saw his hesitation and said, "You're worried about others now?Think about what will happen if your wife gets this video. You'll be in deep trouble."

Kathie chimed in, "I know women well. If my husband used my money to support another woman. I'd make sure he suffered terribly."

Flynn snapped out of it and quickly said, "It was Gerald. I paid him to let me steal your and Mr. Roberts' contract so he could bring you down."

So it was Gerald. Gerald was willing to harm the company's interests to oust Jonathan.


Flynn hurriedly said, "I've told you. Now delete the video as promised."

Jonathan deleted the video in front of him and handed over the phone for inspection. Flynn relaxed only after confirming there were no traces left.

Flynn glared at them angrily before leaving. Without the video, they couldn't do anything to him.

Kathie watched his arrogant departure. "Are we just letting him go?"

Jonathan smiled mischievously. "I said I'd delete the video from the phone,
but I didn't say I wouldn't spread it. Let's have Kyle post it on the Campbell Group's website for everyone to enjoy Mr.Campbell's charm."
enetd
Once the video was on the Campbell Group's website,it would be a scandal.

Austin valued his reputation and would never sign a contract with such a group.
Kathie gave a thumbs up. "You're brilliant. I'll have Kyle handle it."

Jonathan thought for a moment. "We should reward Kyle when we get back."

Kyle received the message from his mom and immediately hacked into the Campbell Group's website, looping the videofor everyone to see.

Flynn stormed back to his room. He had just confirmed with his assistant that they had indeed cleaned up the surveillance.

But where did Jonathan's video come from?

Luckily,Jonathan had deleted it. If his fierce wife got hold of it, he would be doomed.

Flynn angrily tore off his tie and ordered Eleanor, "Take off your clothes and get down."


Eleanor gave him a seductive look. "You're so bad, taking it out on me again."


Flynn had just taken off his jacket when his phone rang again. Seeing it was his assistant, he answered irritably,"What now?"

The assistant sounded frantic. "Mr. Campbell, there's trouble. Our website has been hacked."


Flynn snapped, "Why are you calling me? Get the tech team to handle it."

The assistant stammered, "They can't. The hacker is too skilled.Our team can't fix it. Mr. Campbell, the websiteis playing your video. You should
 check it yourself."

Flynn's heart sank, a bad feeling washing over him.

A video?

Could it be the one Jonathan deleted?

Jonathan was known for his integrity. He wouldn't do something so underhanded, right? Flynn swallowed hard and opened the website.Seeing the video of him and Eleanor playing on a loop, he collapsed to the floor.


It was over. He quickly grabbed his phone to call the tech team, but his wife's number appeared on the screen.

She must have seen the video and was calling to confront him. Sweat poured from his forehead as he took a deep breath and answered, "Hey,honey.What's up?"

"What's up? Flynn, you scumbag! How dare you cheat on me with another woman!"
###Chapter 97 | Give You This Right

Flynn's heart pounded at the sound of his wife Grace Hernandez's rough.gravelly voice. He could almost picture her towering frame,furious and ready to flatten him with a single punch.

Flynn's voice trembled. "Sweetheart, please don't misunderstand. That was for a guest. I would never betray you."

Grace snapped, "I saw everything. Just you wait. I'm coming to deal with you right now."

The callended, and Flynn was already drenched in sweat.

He quickly threw on his clothes and shouted at Eleanor, who was still lying in bed, "What are you doing just lying there? Get out, my wife's coming!She won't spare us."

Eleanor casually played with her long hair, unfazed. "Mr. Campbell,are you seriously afraid of your wife? If she's so fierce and unromantic, why don't you just divorce her and marry me?"

Flynn, exasperated, retorted, "A woman like you is only good for fun.Who would marry you? If you don't leave now, don't blame me when she comes after you."

Not daring to stay any longer, Flynn bolted out of the room.

Eleanor seethed, biting her lip. These men were all the same-sweet talk during the act, but they turned on you the moment it was over.

Flynn barely made it to the living room before Grace caught him.Seeing his guilty expression, she rolled up her sleeves and started swinging.

Dennis reported the commotion to Jonathan. The more people who witnessed this drama, the better.

Jonathan gave Kathie a knowing look. "Ms. Cavendish,we should go visit Mr. Roberts."

Kathie nodded in understanding and wheeled herself to Austin's room.

"Mr. Roberts, how are you feeling? Is your headache better?" Kathie asked warmly.

Austin, grateful, replied, "Much better, Ms. Cavendish. Thank you so much for your help. We've decided to go ahead with the collaboration with Mr.Berkeley:"

Jonathan was thrilled. "I promise you won't regret this decision, Mr.Roberts."


Austin had already heard about Flynn's scandal from his assistant.He wanted nothing to do with someone so morally corrupt.

"We'll sign the contract tomorrow and bring my wife to experience Eldoria.We hope you'll join us, Ms. Cavendish."

"Of course, it would be my pleasure. But I must confess, I'm not actually Mr. Berkeley's secretary. I'm his primary physician. I accompanied him because of my concerns for his health and pretended to be his secretary to support his work."

Austin anad his wife exchanged amused glances. "No wonder youI're so skilled. You're amazing. We hope you'll help us with our health in the future."


Kathie agreed readily. "No problem. I'm happy to help."

Jonathan felt a surge of gratitude. Convincing Austin had gone smoothly,thanks to Kathie. Without her, it wouldn't have been possible.

Austin turned to Jonathan. "We've also hit it off with Dr. Cavendish, and it

s because of our trust in you that I'm willing to reconsider the partnership.Mr. Berkeley, you're truly fortunate to htave such an excellent doctor."

Jonathan's eyes were filled with affection. "Dr. Cavendish is indeed wonderful. She saved my life and gave me a new lease on it."

Kathie felt her heart race under his sincere gaze. She took a deep breath to stay calm. "You should rest early. We'll leave together tomorrow."

Kenna smiled. "See you tomorrow."

Back in his room. Jonathan received a call from Keith.

"Hey.Jonathan,how's it going over there? Everything settled?"

"Yeah, all set. We're heading back to Eldoria tomorrow. What about the investigation?"

"We've made some headway. Mr. Barnes' people caught one of the hitmen.After some persuasion, he confessed that a woman hired them to kill you.She was heavily disguised and used a voice changer, so we couldn't identify her."

"A woman? And she went to such lengths to hide her identity?"

Jonathan was taken aback. He had suspected Gerald, thinking it would confirm Gerald's role in his fall. But now, it wasn't Gerald. Who could it be?


The fact that she used a voice changer suggested she was someone close to him,worried about being recognized.


Jonathan felt a pang of sadness at the thought of someone cose wanting him dead.


"Keep digging and let me know if you find anything."

"Will do. By the way, I heard you had a wildcat in your room that scratched you up. Looks like you finally found out what it's like to be with a woman."


Jonathan cleared his throat. "Who told you that?"

Keith chuckled. "I was with Ben picking up Dr. Cavendish's kids. They mentioned it. Seems like you've finally fallen for someone."

"Enough nonsense. I'm hanging up."

"Wait. I need to remind you. If you're just having fun, fine. But don't forget your status. Your parents will never accept her as your wife."

As a good friend. Keith felt he had to remind Jonathan of his position.
People of their status married to consolidate power, not for love.

Jonathan was resolute. "If I can't choose my own partner, then my position means nothing. Stop worrying and keep investigating."

Jonathan hung up and saw Kathie preparing acupuncture for him,feeling a wave of warmth.


He knew exactly what he was doing. From the moment he decided to stay by her side, he had chosen Kathie.

"Why are you staring at me?"

Jonathan didn't hesitate. "Admiring a beautiful woman."


With everything resolved, Kathie was in a good mood. "Tomorrow we can go back and see the kids.That's great."

Jonathan checked the time. "We still have time. Let's go to the mall and .pick out some gifts for them. You promised them,remember?"

Kathie smacked her forehead. "I've been so busy, I forgot. You're so

thoughtful."

Jonathan said seriously, "I consider them as my own. Whether you believe it or not."


Jonathan had felt a special bond with the kids from the first time he met them,as if they were his own.

"They really like you."

"And you?"

Kathie turned away,but Jonathan gently turned her face back, his deep eyes locking onto hers.

He teased, "Are you really gonna fight your feelings? Just admit you like me already. How are you gonna teach our kids to be honest if you're not honest yourself?"

Kathie, flustered, said, "Fine, I like you. Happy now? But that has nothing to do with teaching the kids. I can't just tell them to follow their hearts and be with whoever they want."

Jonathan pulled her close and kissed her deeply. "You can. I'll give you that right."

Kathie looked at him, seeing the sincerity in his eyes. But she pulled away."Let's go, or the mall will close,"
###Chapter 98 Jealousy

Jonathan asked Dennis to take them to the nearest mall so they could find a toy store and pick out gifts for the three kids.

Kathie watched him, touched by how much effort he was putting in. It was clear he genuinely liked her children.

Earlier, he had told her she had the right to choose to be with whoever she wanted, but was that really his decision to make?

Even Jonathan's friends were strongly against their relationship, not to mention his difficult parents.

Jonathan said, "What are you standing there for? How about this Barbie set? Do you think Eileen will like it?"

Kathie smiled helplessly. She shouldn't overthink things. It was already great that they could maintain this relationship.

She replied, "Pick the purple one. She doesn't like bright red."

"How about these two limited-edition race cars? I want to get them the fastest ones. Last time, Ben bought them some, and seeing how happy they were really annoyed me."

Kathie couldn't help but laugh. "Why would you be annoyed if the kids were happy with their gifts?"

Jonathan glanced at her. "You don't get it. I want to be the one who brings them joy."

Kathie was speechless. "You even have to compete over this?"

·Jonathan raised an eyebrow. Whether it was Kathie or the kids, he had a possessive streak and wanted them to like only him.

"We've got enough gifts for the kids. I see a women's clothing store up ahead. Why don't you pick out a few outfits as a thank-you for coming with me?"


"What about the payment you promised?"

"Don't worry, you'll get every penny. This is just a bonus."

Kathie nodded in satisfaction. "That's more like it. I won't hold back then."


As Kathie was about to push him into the store,she noticed someone following them.

"What's wrong?" Jonathan asked, seeing her stop.

Kathie whispered, "Someone's following us. I thought it was a coincidence,but I saw them in the toy store, and now they're here at the clothing store."

Jonathan glanced around. "You go in and pick out some clothes. I'll keep an eye on things."

Kathie nodded and went inside to shop.

Jonathan watched through the store's mirrors and indeed saw some suspicious people outside. He sent a message to Dennis to handle it.

A few minutes later, Dennis arrived with some men and escorted the followers away.

Kathie came out in a new dress, smiling. "How does this look?"


Jonathan gave her an appreciative look. "Dr. Cavendish, your figure is as good as a model's. You look great in anything."

Kathie smirked. "That's a unique way to compliment someone."

Jonathan pulled out a black card. "Pick whatever you like. It's all on me."

Kathie teased,"Tll buy everything then."

Jonathan nodded generously. "No problem. We'll have it all sent to your place."

The store clerk beamed, but Kathie wasn't one to waste money. Accepting all this would make her look like a gold digger.

"I appreciate the gesture, but I'll just take what I need."

Jonathan's eyes were full of affection. "Whatever you say."

The store clerks whispered among themselves. "That guy may be in a wheelchair, but he's so good to his partner. Rich, handsome,and charismatic."

Kathie picked out three outfits and pushed Jonathan out of the store,noticing the followers were gone.

Jonathan explained, "I had Dennis get rid of those pests. What do you want to do next? Head back to the hotel or go somewhere else?"

Kathie thought for a moment. "I heard the local cuisine here is pretty good.How about we grab a drink?"

Jonathan chuckled. "You're turning into a bit of a drinker."

Kathie gave him a look. "Are we going or not?"

Jonathan made a gesture. "It would be my pleasure."

They headed to the food court behind the mall. Kathie chose a bustling,affordable restaurant. Jonathan looked at the greasy tables and noisy crowd.frowning.


As a high-powered executive, he never frequented places like this. His suit and tie made him stand out.
He cleared his throat. "Dr. Cavendish, do we really have to eat here? How about choosing another restaurant?"

Kathie wiped the table with a napkin. "This is the difference between us.You like fancy places; I like places with a lively atmosphere. The food is fresh, and you can hear all sorts of sounds. I find it interesting; you find it noisy."

Jonathan frowned, not understanding the appeal.

"Aren't places like this supposed to be unhealthy?"

"Fancy restaurants aren't necessarily better. Stop complaining and order. I promise you'll love it."

Seeing her displeased, Jonathan reluctantly ordered a few dishes. Kathie ordered some specialty barbecue and two bottles of cold beer.

Soon,the fragrant barbecue arrived,sizzling and mouth-watering.

Kathie immediately dug in, her face full of enjoyment, eyes squinting with pleasure. "This is so good."

Seeing Jonathan hesitate, Kathie handed him a skewer. "Try it. You'll love it."


Jonathan was reluctant but, seeing Kathie enjoyit so much, took a bite.

The rich flavor and tender meat surprised him.

Kathie pointed to the other dishes. "Everything here is delicious. Try them."


Jonathan started eating, and Kathie poured him a beer. "A little won't hurt."


With Kathie, a doctor, saying it was okay, Jonathan relaxed and started

enjoying the food. They chatted and laughed,clinking their glasses.

Nearby,some shirtless men with tattoos were making crude comments.

"That woman is hot, but she's with a cripople. I wonder if he can even get it up."

"If he can't, we can help. She looks like she'd be fun."

"Look at her tight clothes. She's practically bursting out of them. Women like that love to tease."

"She probably can't get enough from her crippled man. Let's follow them and give her a good time."

The filthy comments reached Kathie and Jonathan. Kathie glanced over and saw five rough-looking men at the next table.

Kathie bit into her skewer, furious at their disgusting words.

Before she could react, Jonathan grabbed a fork and flung it at them.

Jonathan,trained in martial arts, turned the fork into a weapon, hitting the men and making them jump up in pain.

"Who the hell dares to mess with us?" one of the men shouted.

Jonathan raised his fork. "I'm the one messing with you."

Seeing it was the man in the wheelchair, they grabbed their beer bottles and approached. "You've got guts, but if you don't make it up to us,you won't be leaving here."
###Chapter 99 Asking for Her Help

Jonathan twirled the fork in his hand, a cold smile playing on his lips. "So,what's your plan to chill out?"

The blond guy eyed Kathie. "If you let that pretty lady next to you drink with us, wve'll let it slide."

"Yeah. let her drink with us, or we'll mess you up so bad you won't be able to stand," the other thugs chimed in.

Kathie shot Jonathan a look, her hand already gripping a silver needle.

Jonathan nodded. "Alright, you can have her."

The blond guy rubbed his hands together, grinning. "Today's my lucky day,meeting such a gorgeous babe."

As he eagerly reached out to grab Kathie, he suddenly felt a sharp pain and collapsed, convulsing on the ground. The others stopped laughing and stared at her in horror. "What the helljust happened?"

"What the hell just happened?"

Kathie feigned innocence. "What happened to him? Why'd he fall?"

Jonathan added, "I said you could have her. Whether you can handle her or not is up to you."


The remaining thugs, refusing to believe in any trickery, rushed forward.Kathie raised her hand, and they saw a flash of something before feeling their bodies go numb.

Jonathan picked up a bottle and threw it at them, causing them allto collapse.

"She's got hidden weapons," the blond guy finally realized.

Kathie smied sweetly. "You're right. If you dare insult me. I can mnake sure you never have kids."

She quickly moved to the blond guy's side, sticking several needles into his head, rendering him immobile and trembling with fear. "Who are you?"

Kathie dusted off her hands. "I'm someone who deals with scum like you.I've just put needles in your head1. If you ever insult women or commit more crimes, you'll be dead."

The blond guy shookhis head frantically. "I won't do it again, I swear."

The others didn't dare approach. Kathie removed the needles. "Pay up and get lost. Don't ruin our evening."

The blond guy quickly handed over money and left with his crew, not daring to think of anything else.

Everyone in the restaurant applauded, clearly having suffered from the blond thug's antics before.

The owner brought over two bottles of wine, grateful. "Thank you both for dealing with those thugs. They always bully our customers, and we've been too scared to do anything. Hopefully, they'll back off now."

Kathie and Jonathan exchanged a smile, surprised that a simple meal had turned into an act of justice.


Jonathan nodded calmly. "No problem, we just taught them a lesson."

The owner was enthusiastic. "Tonight's on the house. You're welcome here anytime."


The owner thought that if they came by often, the thugs wouldn't dare show up again.

Kathie shook her head. "We'll take the wine, but we'Il still pay. We just

don't like seeing people get bullied. No need to thank us."

The owner was deeply grateful. "Take your time eating. Let me know if you need anything."


Jonathan nodded, reflecting on how unexpected and interesting life had become with Kathie by his side. His life had once been all about work,never stopping to enjoy the scenery. Now, it felt pretty good.

Especially with Kathie around, he felt a sense of belonging.

They had just returned to the hotel when Dennis knocked on the door,looking anxious.

Jonathan frowned. "Dennis, what's going on?"

Dennis was tense. "Mr. Berkeley, Austin and his wife are missing."

Jonathan stood up, and Kathie glanced at him before sitting back down."
What do you mean they're missing? Did they go out and not come back,or is it something else?"

Dennis replied, "All their stuff is gone, even Mr. Roberts' assistant is missing. I checked their room, and they took all their luggage."

"They took their luggage? Could they have gone back home?"


Kathie was puzzled. "That doesn't make sense. They just agreed to work with you and were supposed to leave with us tomorrow. They seemed sincere."


Jonathan frowned. Even if they wanted to leave, they wouldn't do it so quietly.

"Check the hotel surveillance immediately and see if they really left. Also,check flight informnation."

"Got it. I'll get on it right away!"

Dennis ran out quickly, while Jonathan fell into deep thought. Something felt off.

Kathie thought for a moment. "I'll check their room. Maybe I can find some clues."

Jonathan nodded. "Tll go with you."

Kathie wheeled Jonathan to Austin' room. Their belongings were indeed gone, and the room was spotless, leaving almost no trace.

Jonathan sighed. "Could he have changed his mind and decided not to work with me, leaving like this?"

"From what I've seen these past few days, he doesn't seem like the type to leave without a word. There might be another reason." Kathie had a gut feeling they wouldn't leave like this.


But the situation was right in front of them, making it hard not to believe.

Kathie noticed the neatly made bed and curiously lifted the blanket,revealing a fresh bloodstain. "Look, there's blood here. It's fresh, less than an hour old. Something must have happened while we were away."


Thinking about how they were followed earlier, Jonathan's expression turned serious. "Could Flynn be retaliating against Mr. Roberts?"

"Possibly. Call him and find out." Kathie also suspected Flynn.


Jonathan immediately called Flynn, but a rough, aggressive female voice answered,"Who is it? From now on, if you want to talk to Flynn,you need my permission."

"Mrs. Campbell, this is Jonathan. I need to speakto Mr. Campbell urgently.
"

Grace knew who Jonathan was and said, "Hold on. I'll get him."

A few seconds later, Flynn's grumbling voice came through, "Jonathan, you hypocrite, you've got me in trouble. This fierce woman has locked me up.and I can't even leave the house."


Jonathan felt uneasy. "You haven't gone out? What about Mr. Roberts?"

Flynn snapped. "How should I know? Wasn't he with you? I'm telling you,this isn't over. Don't get too cocky. Someone will deal with you eventually.



Jonathan hung up, sensing that Flynn had nothing to do with this.

Flynn had no reason to do such a thing. Losing a big client, he could still find others; there was no need to resort to violence.

Jonathan gripped his phone tightly, a name flashing in his mind.

He quickly said, "I think I know who did this. Kathie, can you contact Mr.Barnes? Offer him any amount to help us find Mr. Roberts and his wife tonight."

Jonathan never thought he'd have to ask her for help.

In this special situation, going through legal channels wouldn't work.
These people would only use underhanded methods to take someone, and he had to do the same to get them back quickly.

Kathie nodded. "No problem, I'll eall Mr. Barnes right away."
###Chapter 100 Shameless

Kathie immediately called Raymond, and he picked up within seconds.

Raymond answered, "Dr. Cavendish, callíng me this late? Something must be up."

Raymond had been around long enough to know that a late-night call from Kathie meant trouble.


"Raymond, you got me. I'm in a bit of a jam. My friend and his wife have gone missing from their hotel. Do you know anyone in Silverbrook who could help me find them?"

"Don't sweat it, Dr. Cavendish. I got a buddy in Silverbrook. Shoot me their names and photos, and I'll get him on it right away."

"Thanks a ton."

"Hey, you saved my life. This is the least I can do."

Kathie quickly sent over the photos and names. "Raymond, I just sent their info to your phone. Seriously, I owe you one. When I get back,IlI bring you some of my special longevity medicine and give you a check-up."

Even though she had saved his life, she didn't want to take his help for granted.

Receiving medicine from the Miracle Doctor was an honor for Raymond.

"Thanks, Dr. Cavendish. I'll get on it and let you know as soon as I have news."


"Thanks a lot!"

Kathie hung up and noticed Jonathan staring at her.

"What's up? Do I have something on my face?" she asked curiously.

"No, it's just... you're more impressive than I thought. I'm curious,why does the famous Raymond Barnes from Eldoria listen to you?"

"I saved his life. He's repaying the favor."

Jonathan looked puzzled. "But I heard the person who saved him was the Miracle Doctor. Are you the legendary Miracle Doctor?"

Jonathan knewv she was skilled, but he hadn't connected the dots.

Raymond had helped her multiple tímes. Unless she was his savior, he wouldn't be so responsive.

"I'm not the Miracle Doctor. I don't know why people say that. Anyway,he can help, and that's what matters. You should focus on finding out who's behind this. It's clear someone wants to stop you from bringing them back."


Kathie intentionally kept her identity a secret. Her words reminded him that now wasn't the time to dig into her background but to find the mastermind and gather evidence.

If he couldn't bring Austin back tomorrow, the board would definitely have something to say.

The more Gerald and his cronies tried to stop him, the more determined he was to prove himself.

After anxiously waiting until dawn, Raymond finally called.

The next day, at the Berkeley Group in Eldoria.

Gerald sat back, smugly blowing smoke rings. "That useless Flynn. In the end, I had to step in. This time, I'll make Jonathan fall hard. If he can't bring Austin back, I'll rally the board to oust him."

Harold looked worried. "What if he does bring Austin back?"

"Impossible. They're strangers in Silverbrook. I had the mob lock up Austin and his wife. There's been no word, which means they haven't found them. I haven't seen any flight bookings either. They're probably still stuck there."

Gerald had made thorough preparations to ensure Jonathan had no chance to rise.

Harold sighed in relief. "Good. I can't wait to see him humiliated."

Gerald shot him a look. "Don't just wait for him to fail. You need to find ways to beat him. And Patricia-if you can marry into the Stewart Fåmily,you'll have a strong backing to compete with him."

Harold frowned. He and Patricia had been intimate, but she still ignored him, her heart set on Jonathan. She had rejected his advances multiple times.


"I'll find a way to marry her."

"Harold, I've always taught you to use any means necessary.Whether it's the company or women, you need to have control."

Harold gritted his teeth. "I understand.I'll get her."

Gerald stood up, satisfied. "That's my boy. Let's go. The board meeting is about to start. I'll stir things up. I want to see how Jonathan dares to show his face."


Harold looked at his father with admiration. "You're the best, Dad.Jonathan doesn't stand a chance against you."

Gerald scoffed. "He's nothing. He thinks he can compete with me?"

They walked to the meeting room, chatting and laughing, only to find it

bustling inside. Gerald walked in confidently, only to see Jonathan sitting at the head of the table, with Austin across from him,signing a contract.

Austin, grateful for Jonathan's help, had just renewed a ten-year deal,a huge win for the company.


Jonathan extended his hand. "Mr. Roberts, here's to a successful partnership."


Austin shook his hand with a smile. "Mr. Berkeley, I'm looking forward to our next ten years together."

Gerald and Harold froze at the door, stunned.

Wasn't Jonathan supposed to still be in Silverbrook?

Wasn't Austin supposed to be held by the mob?

Yet here they were, safe and sound, signing a contract.

Harold whispered, "Dad, what's going on?"

Gerald's face was rigid. "How should I know?"


He wanted to know how Jonathan had brought Austin back without him getting any word.

Jonathan turned to them, a knowing smile on his face. "Gerald,Harold,you're here. Come in. I have something important to announce."

Gerald felt a sense of foreboding. He gave Harold a look and whispered, "If anything happens, don't help me."

As long as Harold was safe, they still had a chance. Gerald couldIn't let him get involved.

Gerald forced a smile. "Jonathan, you're impressive.Gerald was worried

you wouldn't complete the task, but you've brought great benefits to the company."


Jonathan glared coldly. "Gerald, I must have disappointed you. You leaked the bottom price to Flynn and paid the mob to kidnap Austin and his wife.all to stop me from bringing them back."

The room erupted in whispers, everyone looking at Gerald in shock.

Gerald tried to stay calm. "Jonathan, I know you have issues with me, but you can't slander me like this. I'm still your uncle."

Jonathan looked at Ben, who played a recording on his phone. It was Flynn, admitting he had paid Gerald for the bottom price.

Gerald's face turned pale, swallowing nervously. "Even if I did that, it has nothing to do with Mr. Roberts."

Jonathan said coldly, "Gerald, you're shameless. If you won't admit it, I'll make you."

He then played another video, showing Gerald talking to the mob boss,discussing the kidnapping. It was all orchestrated by him.

Gerald couldn't understand how Jonathan had gotten such incriminating footage.
