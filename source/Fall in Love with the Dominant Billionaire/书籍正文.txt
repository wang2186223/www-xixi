###Chapter 1 How Could She Be So Ugly?
"Alright, fine, I'll marry, him," Reese Brooks muttered, her face throbbing with pain. She glared at her stepmother, Nancy Smith,with eyes that could cut glass. Just dragged back from the sticks by her dad, Kenneth Brooks, to The Brooks VilIa,and now this? She had to step in for her sister, Dahlia Brooks,and marry some man who couldn't even walk?


Dahlia was supposed to marry the paralyzed guy,but then she got a better deal with the Morris family. And somehow,that became Reese's problem? At first, she was like, "No way."


Ever since Kenneth hitched up with Nancy, Reese and her grandma got shipped off to the boonies. He didn't give a dlamn about her, and she had to fend for herself. So,during these tough years,she became capable enough to buy the whole city if she felt like it.



Nancy, with her smug face, acted like Reese hit the jackpot marrying into the powerful Flynn family. What a joke.
Couldn't they see the difference? Reese's grandma always said that even though Reese lived out in the country, she never looked like it. She had this vibe, this aura, and her delicate features could charm anyone.



Thinking about her grandma made Reese's blood boil. She clenched her fists so hard her knuckles turned white. Two months ago, her grandma went to the city and never came back. She died, just like that. Then, they dragged Reese back from the countryside.



Reese had one goal coming back to The Brooks Villa: find out what really happened to her grandma. Nancy mentioned that the last place her grandma visited was The Flynn Villa.



Just because Reese had snapped, "Even if I have to marry into the Flynn family, it's not up to a homewrecker like you to boss me around," Kenneth had slapped her so hard her head spun.



Nancy's smug face was unbearable. She sauntered over,trying to place a hand on Reese's shoulder, but Reese dodged it like it was the plague. They all knew how much her grandma meant to her  and that she'd cave in and agree to the marriage. But Reese made a silent vow to uncover the truth about her grandma's death and make whoever was responsible pay.



And that slap? She'd remember it.


The next morning, Kenneth didn't even bother to see her off.He just sent a driver to take Reese straight to The Flynn Villa.No wedding ceremony, nothing. It was like he was scared she'd back out last minute. He didn't even check how she was dressed.



When the Flynn family saw Reese, their jaws hit the floor. How could she be so ugly? Did Aiden Flynn even know what he was getting into?


She had these huge black-framed glasses covering most of her face,her skin was dark and spotty, and she was wearing a floral top with loose black bell-bottom pants. She looked like she just stepped out of a time machine from the countryside. If it weren't for the Brooks family driver, they would've thought a beggar had wandered in by mistake.



Butler Jason Tartt adjusted his glasses, trying to keep his cool,and led Reese inside with a bow. He might've been judging her hard on the inside, but he had to keep up appearances.



Reese was loving their reactions.She raised an eyebrow and strutted through the gates of The Flynn VVilla.
###Chapter 2 Fearless
"Alright,follow me to meet Mr. Flynn."


Jason, all respectful and proper, led Reese inside. The Flynn Villa,smack dab in the ritzy part of downtown, was worth a cool billion. Reese took a quick look around and,yeah, it was massive. The decor was low-key, but the furniture screamed money.


As they strolled, Jason started his spiel, "So, here's the deal with Mr. Flynn. He got into a nasty car wreck earlier this year and now he's paralyzed from the waist down. No feeling at all.We really need Mrs. Flynn to take good care of him."


"And, uh, Mr, Malcolm Flynn's got a temper. Mrs. Reese Flynn, you better not tick him off, or even Mr. Aiden Flynn won't be able to help you."


"And another thing..." Jason kept droning on, probably thinking he was being helpful,but Reese saw right through him.


"Are you done? If so, just point me to his room."


Reese cut him off, cold and impatient. She was all about getting things done, no time for pointless chatter.


Jason was taken aback, staring at Reese like she'd grown a second head. Everyone in the Flynn family knew Jason had been with Aiden since forever and was now a big deal in the household. Nobody dared to cross him,and everyone treated him with kid gloves. But this country girl...


Reese gave him a look.


It was a calm look, but it sent shivers down Jason's spine, like she had murder in her eyes. How could she look at himn like that? Jason felt a chill run down his back. HHe snapped out of it,remembering where he was, and cleared his throat.


"I'm the butler here. If you need anything, just let me know.
When Mr. Aiden Flynn isn't around, I run the show."


Was he trying to say that besides Aiden, he was the top dog in the Flynn family? Reminding Reese to show him some respect?


Reese shot him a frosty look and nodded, "Just tell me which room it is. I'll handle it myself."



Jason didn't expect Reese to be so bold, carrying herself with an air of untouchability. Especially those clear, pure eyes of hers-they made people think twice about crossing her.


He had no choice but to bow his head and lead Reese forward.As he opened the door, a nasty, stale smell hit them, and it was pitch black inside. Despite the bright sunshine outside, the room felt like a freezer, making him shiver. She turned to Jason and said, "Mr. Tartt, you can go now. I want to talk to my husband alone."



Jason looked puzzled. Were country girls this gutsy nowadays?She hadn't even met him yet and was already calling him husband like it was nothing?


Seeing Jason still standing there, Reese teased, "Mr. Tartt,you planning to stick around for the show?"



Jason shrank back and coughed awkwardly. How could the Brooks family be so fearless? Dismissing him right after stepping in, truly bold.


At that moment, a calm voice came from inside, "Mr. Tartt,you can leave now."



"But Mr. Flynn, she..."


"Leave!" followed by a light cough. Beese felt a chill run down her spine. She couldn't help but glance at the bed, but the stale smell and dim light made ft hard to see. She walked over and yanked the curtains open.



Reese said, "Getting some fresh air in here will help the patient recover better."



Jason, who was about to leave, paused. Was she seriously criticizing his methods right in front of Malcolm?



"Mr. Flynn doesn't like sunlight, so he orders us to keep the curtains closed every day. Mrs. Flynn just got here and doesn't understand the situation yet, so it's better not to mess with things too much."
###Chapter 3 Maybe I Can Really Do It
Reese was so done with that stuck-up butler. Seriously, who ever heard of dodging sunlight to cure an illness? What kind of weird disease was that? She knew Aiden had tried everything, from top hospitals to fortune tellers.


Aiden was desperate for Malcolm to get back on his feet.


Lucky for him, he found her. She could give it a shot. She'd been learning medicine since she was a kid, and she was a whiz at acupuncture.



But her grandma always told her to keep it on the down-low,no matter where she was. She'd wait until she saw him before saying anything.


Jason, not wanting to get in the way, bowed out and shut the door behind him. Reese squinted at Malcolm lying on the bed, the light from the window hitting just right. He was propped up, his black shirt making his face look like it was carved from stone, but it couldn't hide his noble and arrogant vibe.


Even though he was paralyzed from the waist down,his pride was still intact, and she had to respect that.


Malcolm was on the bed, hadn't expected this girl to beso gutsy, just yanking open the curtains without asking. He hadn't seen sunlight in months, and the sudden brightness stung his eyes.



He'd heard from his grandpa that the Brooks family was supposed to marry off Dahlia to him.



But then they found out Dahlia might not be able to have kids. No way his grandpa would let a woman who couldn't have children marry into the family.


So they swapped her out for Reese. Ignoring her old-fashioned  country-style clothes, just from her voice, she was probably a knockout.



"From now on, keep the room airy with fresh air and lots of sunlight. It's good for your recovery," Reese said. "Plus,it makes it easier for me to treat your legs."



"You can treat my legs?" Malcolm's dark eyes flashed with surprise.



Could this girl fix him? His grandpa had brought in so many top-notch doctors and visited countless hospitals, all with no luck. Thinking about it, the hope in his eyes faded again.


"Forget it. If even the top docs couldn't fix my legs, what makes you think you can?" Better to ditch the false hope right from the start.


 
Reese just shrugged."Well, we can at least give it a shot." She wasn't offering to treat Malcolm's legs out of pure kindness. She wanted him to owe her one, so he'd spill the beans about the Flynn family. Maybe he could help dig into her grandma's death. No one in the Flynn family knew more about it than he did. That was her real reason for being here.



Once she got the truth, she'd figure out a way to bounce.


Malcolm sneered, "It's better to close the curtain. I don't want to see you, and you probably don't want to see me either."



His voice was deep and magnetic, like it could echo in your soul.



Reese shot back,"But we're gonna be seeing each other every day from now on. You really wanna keep it like this?"


Avoiding it wasn't gonna solve anything.


Reese got it. Being that good-looking but stuck in bed had to be rough.


She raised an eyebrow confidently.


"Let me try. It won't hurt you. After all, so many doctors have tried and failed. Maybe I can pull it off."


Malcolm looked at her with a cold stare. "You really think you can do it?"



Reese knew Malcolm had a bad temper. At just twenty years old, he was running a company and had a stranglehold on Atlanta's entire economy. He was a big shot in the industry.One word from him, and the whole city's economy could take a hit.



She raised an eyebrow and shot him a sideways glance,challenging him, "Why don't we give it a try?"


Ever since the hospital told Malcolm his legs were done for, he'd locked himself away, trying to numb the pain. He was curious to see what Reese could do. He'd treat it like an experiment.



"So,what's your plan now?"


Hearing him agree to the treatment, Reese didn't waste any time. She pulled out a small bag from her suitcase, opened it up, and revealed a bunch of silver needles of different sizes.She walked over to Malcolm and started examining his legs from top to bottom.



Malcolm squinted and raised an eyebrow. Maybe Reese knew her stuff?



Only now did Malcolm get a good look at her face. The light had made it hard to see before. He rubbed his forehead in frustration. What kind of wife had his grandfather picked for him? This... this was too much.
###Chapter 4 Someone's Out to Get You


Reese was all in on fixing Malcolm's leg. It wasn't run-of-the-mill paralysis; this was more serious. She pressed down on a spot on his leg and pulled out a silver needle.
"Hold up," Malcolm said, eyeing those sharp needles like they were about to bite him. "You got a medical license or something?"



Reese blinked, looking up at him. A medical license? She was a professor; did that count? But even if she said that,he probably wouldn't buy it. Heck, she wasn't even sure she believed it herself right now.



"My license is left in the village, but trust me, I know what I'm doing."


Still, she knew she'd need to keep an eye on his situation for a while. "Alright, I'm gonna start. It might sting a bit, so hang tight."She lined up the needle again, but her hand shook, almost dropping it.


"Sorry, it's been a minute since I last did acupuncture. Got a bit of the jitters."



Malcolm's face was grim as a storm cloud. Seriously? This chick almost dropped a needle, and she was saying she can fix him? And she was just "nervous"? Was she messing with him?


Just as Reese was about to stick the needle in, Malcolm grabbed her wrist. She looked at him, eyebrows shooting up in surprise.


"Listen, my leg's been checked out by top docs from all over the country, even abroad," he said, his voice dripping with skepticism.


Now,given her earlier action, he doubted her ability. Reese shot back, "You sure you've seen all the famous doctors?"



None of those so-called famous doctors were like her, that was for sure.



Malcolm's mind flashed back to something his grandpa had mentioned-a young doctor at a professor level, supposedly a medical prodigy. This person was super mysterious, turning down offers from all the big medical schools. The last name was Brooks, just like Reese's, but he couldn't remember the full name.



Still, he figured it was probably just a coincidence. No way it was her.



Seeing Malcolm lost in thought, Reese decided not to waste any more time. She slapped his leg, grabbed the needle, and quickly inserted it into several acupuncture points. When she was done, Malcolm glanced at her work and noticed the needle placements were spot on. Even though MAalcolm wasn't a medical expert, he'd seen enough doctors to recognize the right spots. It seemed like Reese did know her stuff.


Alright, he thought,she seems confident. Might as well let her give it a shot.


Reese was an interesting character. Despite her plain clothes and average looks, there was something about her that set her apart.



Malcolm couldn't quite put his finger on it.


Reese carefully pressed on other parts of his leg, then pulled out the needles, examining them closely. Sheraised an eyebrow and said, "This isn't your typical paralysis, but I can fix you."



She had just checked that Malcolm's leg was gradually stiffening. In less than three months, he could be facing amputation. Malcolm frowned,"What are you getting at?"


"Someone's out to get you," she said seriously. "During your treatment, they slipped something extra in. But I need more time to figure out exactly what."



The idea that someone wanted to harm him wasn't exactly a shocker. In a wealthy family like his, there were plenty of folks who'd love to see him six feet under. But this girl, figuring out he was being framed just by poking him with a few needles?That was something else.



Reese hadn't even had time to put away her silver needles when Jason came knocking.



"Mr. Malcolm Flynn, Mr. Aiden Flynn wants Mrs. Reese Flynn to come downstairs."



Malcolm didn't respond,still watching Reese intently. This gave Reese the perfect excuse to make her exit.


"I'll head downstairs then. And don't close the curtains again,it's not good for your legs."



After Reese left, Malcolm looked at the sunlight streaming in.realizing it wasn't as harsh as he remembered. He called out to the servant.



"Mr. Flynn,do you need something?"


"Close the curtains."


"Okay." The servant stepped forward,ready to shut them.


"Wait, forget it, You can leave."



"Alright." The servant was puzzled, but she could only know one thing that this new girl, Reese, had some serious skills.She'd managed to get Malcolm, who hadn't seen, sunlight in years, to open the curtains and even agree to keep them open.
###Chapter 5 Better Not Mess with Me


"Get Justin in here."


"On it.”


The servant called in the assistant,  Justin Chabon.


"Mr.Flynn."



"Dig up everything on Reese. I mean everything,even the tiniest detail."



Malcolm had a gut feeling that Reese wasn't just some ordinary girl.



When Justin came in earlier, he had taken a quick look at Reese chilling in the living room. Her look and vibe were kinda hard to pin down. What was there to dig up about a girl like her? Word was she came from the sticks.



"Mr. Aiden Flynn picked her, so she should be cool, righe?"



Malcolm started unbuttoning his sleeves, his voice getting deeper and his eyes narrowing.



"If she was just some nobody, would a few stitches show that someone tried to mess me up on purpose?"



Justin was taken aback, "Wait, you mean she noticed something about your leg?"



"Get moving and find out!"


Reese had just come downstairs and was heading to Aiden's room when a voice called out to her.



"Hey,.. you are Malcolm's new wife?"Reese turned around to see a girl, maybe twenty, rocking some limited edition threads and looking pretty high-class. She had this trendy double bun hairstyle, flawless skin, and looked a lot like Malcolm, so definitely family.


The Flynn family had those good genes. no doubt.


But the way she was eyeing Reese was full of attitude.


Jason had made sure Alyssa Flynn was around. Alyssa had been spoiled by Aiden since she was a kid and couldn't handle any sass. She had a nasty temper, and in this house,only Malcolm could keep her in check. Even Aiden didn't mess.with her.



Reese smirked a bit. "And you are...?"


Alyssa gave a little cough, her eyes full of arrogance.


"I'm Alyssa, Malcolm's favorite sister. Juast a heads up, don't think marrying into the Flynn family means you can start acting all high and mighty. You ain't got nothing."


As she spoke, she looked Reese up and down, clearly unimpressed.



"And since you're part of the Flynn family now, you gotta represent us right. Seriously, what's with that outfit? Who even wears floral prints anymore? It's hideous. Mr. Tartt, take her to my room."


Jason was secretly thrilled. "Yes, ma'am."


He knew it. Reese was all bark and no bite. As the Flynn family butler, even Malcolm never talked to him like that.


Alyssa was the perfect one to put her in her place, Reese had been all sassy earlier, but now she was too scared to say a word.He stepped forward, raising his voice on purpose, "Let's go."



Reese's clear eyes locked onto him, her voice steady and unyielding.



"Why should I listen to you?"


Alyssa stared at Reese, a bit taken aback.



"I'm Miss Flynn of this house. Why shouldn't you listen to me? Plus, your outfit might freak Malcolm out. Can you handle that?"



With that, Alyssa turned and barked orders.


"Mr. Tartt, get a couple of people to help her."



Jason was already feeling smug. Alyssa was a force to be reckoned with in the Flynn family. No matter how much Reese resisted, she couldn't stand up to Alyssa. But he still played the part, acting hesitant as he spoke to Alyssa.



"But Miss Alyssa Flynn, if Mr. Malcolm Flynn asks..."


"Never mind, I'll take the heat if anything happens.Besides,Malcolm adores me. He wouldn't scold me over some outsider.Now hurry up..."



Jason had been waiting for this. He quickly ordered two servants to step forward. Reese frowned, a flicker of impatience in her eyes.


"I'm warning you, don't touch me."


For some reason, the two servants actually froze and didn't dare move.



Alyssa felt a bit humiliated. Two servants scared by this woman? She rolled up her sleeves and shoved the servants
"Useless idiots. T'll handle this myself!"	 
###Chapter 6 Someone's Got Their Eye on You
Alyssa had just grabbed Reese's arm, ready to yank her out,when Reese twisted her wrist and grabbed Alyssa's in return,squeezing hard.


Alyssa cried out, "Ow... it hurts, you witch, let go of me!"



Reese's eyes were cold and fearless.′′Itold you, don't touch me."



She didn't want to make enemies with anyone in the Flynn family; she just wanted to get her business done and bounce.But if someone messed with her, she wasn't about to just take it lying down.



The sharp pain almost made Alyssa cry.

 
"If you don't letgo, Malcolm's gonna make you pay." "I know you don't like me, bout I'm still Malcolm's wife. You don't have to accept it, but you can't just lay hands on me.That's just basic decency."



Reese held Alyssa's wrist tight, standing her ground, her vibe so intense that the servants didn't dare to step in



Alyssa's face turned red with anger, making her lash out even more.



"So what? You're just a stand-in bride. You really think you're Mrs. Flynn? Who give you the right to lecture me?"



"Idon't think I'm Mrs. Flynn, but I deserve some basic respect."



Seeing Reese still not letting go, Alyssa snapped at the butler and the two servants,



"Are you all blind? Get this crazy woman off me!" Jason snapped out of it and, along with the two servants, was about to step in when a commanding voice came from upstairs.



"What's all this racket?"


Alyssa looked at Aiden like he was her savior.


"Grandpa, this woman grabbed my wrist and hurt me.Get rid of her!"



Reese let go, and Alyssa quickly rubbed her reddened wrist,tears of pain streaming down her face. No one in the Flynn family had ever dared to treat her like this.



Alyssa ran to Aiden, crying her eyes out.


"Grandpa,you gotta help me."

 
"What happened?" Jason stepped up. "Mr. Aiden Flynn, Miss Alyssa Flynn was just trying to help Mrs. Reese Flynn change her clothes.Unexpectedly..."



"Yeah, I just saw how she was dressed and thought it might hurt the Flynn family's rep. But she didn't appreciate it and even hurt me!"



"Miss Flynn, didn't you have two servants drag me away?"Even in front of Aiden, Reese stayed cool and collected.



"You're lying, I..."


"Alyssa, cut it out. She's Malcolm's wife now. Is this how the Flynn family teaches you to act? Go back to your room!"



After all, they had a marriage alliance with the Brooks family;they couldn't just bully Reese openly.


Alyssa looked at Aiden in shock. Wasn't it clear he was siding with this plain-looking woman?


"Grandpa..."


Aiden shot Alyssa a look, and knowing her grandpa's temper she didn't dare push it further.


She pouted,feeling wronged."Fine."



Reese raised an eyebrow, surprised that Aiden from the Flynn family was so fair-minded.



As Alyssa passed Reese, she didn't forget to shoot her a nasty glare.



Aiden glanced at Reese. "Alyssa's been spoiled by me. Don't take it to heart, Reese. Take good care of Malcolm in the Flynn family, and we won't treat you unfairly."



"Yes, I will, Grandpa." That "Grandpa" made Aiden smile.



"Then go back to your room and rest."



Reese nodded and turned to head upstairs. Her phone buzzed just then. She glanced at it-it was Calvin Roth.



She looked around to make sure no one was watching,then slipped into the study and answered quietly.



"I told you, only contact me if it's urgent."



She didn't want to blow her cover and attract trouble.



"Reese, Louis just called and said someone's digging into your past. He's worried you might run into trouble over there."
###Chapter 7| Can't Give You What.. 
Reese's long lashes fluttered, a sharp glint in her eyes.She already knew the answer in her heart. "It's Malcolm."



"Malcolm? Isn't that your husband? Why's he snooping around on you?"


They were already hitched, so what's left to dig up? And why did Malcolm's name ring a bell?



Calvin quickly checked and immediately exclaimed, "Oh my God,Reese,your hubby's quite the big shot. You two are a power couple."


"But... it's a pity about last year's car accident. Since then, he's barely touched the company's affairs, but his reputation in Atlanta remains impeccable." "Cut the crap, get to the point. I don't have all day," Reese snapped, clearly impatient.



"Should we make him can't find anything or what?"


"That's a no-go. It'll just make him more suspicious. But we can't let him find out everything either. Just tell him I know some medicine. Maybe he can help me out later."



Given his current status, he had to be thorough. After less than half an hour with her, he was already questioning her identity.She'd have to tread carefully living in The Flynn Villa from now on.



"Got it. Also, there's a project at the company you might want to invest in. I sent it to your email. Check it out when you get a chance."



"You guys handle it. I might not be online much lately." "Understood,hanging up."


Reese deleted the call logand slipped out of the study


After dinner, she took the prepared medicine into Malcolm's room. A foul smell hit Malcolm's nose, and he couldn't help but frown.



"What is this? It reeks."



"It's the medicine I made for you. Drink it later, and I'll give you a couple of acupuncture treatments. Let's see how it goes in a few days."



Malcolm didn't expect Reese to be so attentive to his needs.Out of habit, he instinctively asked, "Why are you doing all this for me?"



Reese wasn't fazed. She placed the medicine on his bedside table and answered smoothly, "You're my husband now. l your leg gets better, I won't have to babysit you every day. ItT make my life easier."


"Make your life easier, huh?" Malcolm's lips curled into a slight smirk. His eyes narrowed. "I'm paralyzed from the waist down. Whatever you're after, I can't give it to you."



"I don't care about sex," she blurted out without thinking


Malcolm's expression darkened. Did she not care, or did she think he was incapable?



"You just need to cooperate with me," Reese said, squatting down. She took out the silver needles, disinfected them, and arranged them neatly, all in one smooth motion.



Just then, someone barged in from outside.

 
"Malcolm..." The intruder was Malcolm's second sister, Everly Flyrn. Reese was a bit exasperated. How many sisters does Malcolm have?



Everly's face turned pale when she saw the needles in Reese's hand. She rushed forward and shoved Reese away.



"You vicious woman, are you trying to kill Malcolm as soon as you got here?"



Reese was caught off guard and fell to the ground. Everly then saw Reese's face and covered her mouth as if she had seen a ghost.



"Oh my God, Grandpa must be crazy. Even if Malcolm is paralyzed, he doesn't have to settle for this."



Everly walked up to Reese and disdainfully tugged at her clothes with her fingertips.



"What are you even wearing? Did you time travel from some other era?"



Even the maids' aprons looked better than her clothes.



Reese adjusted her glasses, her bright eyes somewhat intimidating.



Everly felt a bit of fear when she met Reese's gaze.



"You.,. what kind of look is that? I'm telling you, I'm Miss Flynn of this house. You'd better show some respect."
###Chapter 8 What Can You Do About It?


Reese couldn't be bothered with this rude chick; she was always one to hold a grudge.



"I'm Malcolm's wife now. Shouldn't you be showing me some respect?"



Everly was taken aback for a second. She didn't expect this plain-looking woman to have such a sharp tongue.



"Don't think I don't know. If it weren't for the family deal and your sister's infertility, do you think you'd even have a shot?How dare you act all high and mighty? Have you looked in a mirror? Do you really think you deserve this?"



Reese gave a faint smile, but the look in her eyes was fierce,making Everly shiver.


 
"In that case, please leave and don't bother my husband while he's resting."


"Hus... husband?" Everly was stunned, then sneered, "You really have no shame. With a face like yours, you dare call Malcolm your husband? It's gross just hearing it."



Reese could see that Everly's feelings for Malcolm were more than just sibling affection; there was jealousy in her eyes.



She raised an eyebrow and smiled sweetly, suddenly wrapping her arm around Malcolm's.



"So what? Legally, he's my husband. Sorry, but please leave and don't disturb us while we're resting."



Malcolm lowered his eyes slightly. The way she called him "husband" was so natural, and it even sounded kinda nnice.Plus, she was really good at comebacks.


Seeing this, Everly's shoulders shook with anger, her pretty face darkening


"You shameless woman!"


"We're legally married. Got a problem with that?"


"You... just you wait!"



Everly stomped her foot, turned around, and slammed the door on her way out.



Reese let out a sigh of relief. Dealing with that brat was seriously draining. She was about to let go of Malcolm when he suddenly wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her close.



"Malcolm, let-go of me!"



She tried to wiggle free,but Malcolm was surprisingly strong,and she couldn't budge. Malcolm's breath tickled her ear.



"Who the hell are you?"



Reese was stunned for a moment, looking at Malcolm with an innocent expression.



"What're are you talking about? I'm your new wife."



"You know that's not what I'm asking."



"Then what are you asking?" She couldn't move in his arms,so she just gave up trying.



"Don't play dumb." His fingers pinched her chin,his eyes sharp.



Reese's clear eyes showed no panic, staying eerily calm. She exhaled softly, "You don't need to be so tense. I'm not gonna do anything to you."



Malcolm sneered. That tone was pretty cocky.


"What could you possibly do to me?"


Malcolm let her go and leaned back against the headboard.



"If you don't want to waste your youth here, you'd better leave soon."



′′I7'm not leaving. We're married now, and we have a marriage agreement. Grandma always told me to keep my promises and not back out,"



Besides, Aiden wouldn't agree, either.



Staying at The Flynn Villa, she could investigate her grandmother's death. And she could also treat Malcolm's leg, then she wouldn't feel ashamed of him when she left.


After speaking, Reese got up from the bed, collected the silver needles from the floor, and put them into her small suitcase.These were priceless items that Calvin had scoured all of Atlanta to find, and they were almost destroyed by Everly.



Malcolm glanced at the bowl of medicine on the bedside table.picked it up, and downed it in one gulp. His brows furrowed.and his face darkened.



The taste was indescribable.
###Chapter 9 Call the Cops


Reese stood up, noticing his expression, and pulled out a piece of candy, bending down to pop it into his mouth.The sweet taste spread,slowly washing away the bitterness, and Malcolm's frown eased up a bit.



Malcolm shot her a glance, "Did you plan this?"


"Nah, just a habit." When her grandma was sick, she hated taking medicine. Since then, Reese always carried candy in her bag. Sometimes, a piece of candy when you were feeling down could work wonders.



"Yeah, it's pretty sweet."


"Alright, let's get started." Reese held a needle, ready to hit the acupuncture point.



Suddenly, the door flew open and Alyssa stormed in, snatching the needle from Reese's hand and shoving her to the ground.


"You sneaky witch, trying to kill Malcolm with a needle!"


"Seriously?" Reese glared at Alyssa, annoyed.


Aiden, standing behind Alyssa, looked at the mess on the floor and the bowl of nasty-smelling medicine on the table, his face turning red with anger.


"What the hell is going on here?"



Before Reese could explain, Everly, whao had just come back,jumped in.


"Obviously, she's trying to kill Malcolm. A girl from the sticks treating Malcolm? You think that's a good idea?"



Alyssa, still holding a grudge, took every chance to put Reese in her place. She tugged at Aiden's sleeve, "Grandpa, I told you,she's got some shady motives for marrying into our
family. Look at her, she's dirt poor and wants to off Malcolm to get the Flynn family's money."



Aiden turned to Reese, demanding an explanation.


"Reese, what's your deal?"


Reese calmly got up, looking Aiden straight in the eye.


"Grandpa, I can fix Malcolm's leg. Just give me some time."



Everly sneered from the sidelines.


"Looking at you, I bet you haven't even set foot in a college,yet here you are, playing doctor."


Reese shot her a sideways glance, "How do you know I haven't been to college? If I'm saying I can do this, it's 'cause I'm.confident. If I mess up, you guys won't let me off the hook." "Grandpa's brought in the best doctors from all over the country for Malcolm's leg, and none of them could fix it. You think your little bag of tricks can do the job?"



Everly's tone was dripping with the intent to boot Reese out of the Flynn family.



Aiden looked over at Malcolm lying on the bed. "Reese, our Flynn family doesn't wrong anyone. If you can prove you can help Malcolm, I'll believe you."



Reese lowered her head slightly, thinking.



Alyssa, thinking Reese was cornered, got even more smug."What, cat got your tongue? Or are you just figuring out how to cover up your lie?"


Malcolm stayed quiet, curious to see if Reese could actually back up her claims. Everly, sensing an opportunity, pushed harder, "Come on, if you can't prove it, just admit you're here to harm Malcolm."



Reese was figuring out how to show Malcolm her skills without making a big scene. His trust was what mattered most to her;the rest of them, not so much.



Everly, losing patience, urged again, "Grandpa, call the cops.Only in front of the police will this woman spill the truth."



Malcolm glanced at Reese, noticing her calm,thoughtful expression.



Aiden stayed silent, which was as good as agreeing with Everly. With a smug grin, Everly started dialing the police.



Just then, Malcolm felt a faint sensation in his leg. It was brief,but it was there.



Unable to believe it, he shouted excitedly,"Wait a minute!"
###Chapter 10 The Leg Injury Seems Fishy


Everly looked up, totally floored.


"Malcolm, what's up?"


"Let her stay and keep treating me. You guys don't need to stress about it."



Alyssa got all worked up too, "Malcolm, she's trying to hurt you.How can we not care?"


"She's my wife, she won't hurt me." Malcolm's eyes flickered with a dark, cold light.


Everly glanced at Malcolm, feeling a chill from the murderous vibe in his eyes. She shivered, suddenly tongue-tied. Even though Malcolm was paralyzed, he was still as intimidating as ever, Reese smirked a bit, looking at Malcolm on the bed. He actually stood up for her; maybe he wasn't as scary as he seemed.



Aiden respected Malcolm's call, but Malcolm's leg was a big deal.



He hesitated and asked, "Malcolm, are you sure she's not out to get you?"



"She won't harm me, Grandpa."


Aiden couldn't push it further, "Alright,if you say so,we'll keep her around for now."



Alyssa stomped her foot in frustration, "Grandpa..."


"Malcolm's made his decision. Plus, if we call the cops without proof, what happens tothe Flynn family's reputation?" The media would have a field day, saying the Flynn family just got a new bride and already hit up the police station. We'd be a laughingstock.



As long as Reese didn't actually hurt Malcolm, everything else was small potatoes and didn't need to be blown up.


Everly tugged at Alyssa and shook her head slightly, signaling her to drop it. If they ticked off Grandpa, he'd side with Reese even more, making things tougher for them.


Alyssa, though pissed, had to back down.



When Vincent Flynn gets back, they'll deal with this damn Reese then!



Aiden spoke again, "You all head out. Reese, you too."


"Okay." Alyssa and Everly grudgingly left the room. They thought they had a shot at kicking Reese out, but Malcolm had to go and defend her.



Everly was fuming. She'd been all set to spill her feelings to Malcolm. If he was on board, they could tell Grandpa, and he'd probably give the green light right away.



But unexpectedly, the Brooks family had to send Reese today and mess everything up. Everly clenched her teeth and fists in frustration.



After everyone cleared out, Reese turned to Malcolm on the bed. "I'll step out for a bit and come back later. You stay put."She got ready to follow Aiden.



Malcolm gave a bitter smile, "Not like I can move anyway."


Reese thought he looked uncomfortable. Remembering how he backed her up, she tried to comfort him. "Um... Ill do my best to fix you up."


Malcolm saw the sympathy in her eyes and couldn't help but smirk. He was just sighing, did Reese really pity him that much?



As the door closed, Malcolm's eyes grew more thoughtful. Her calmness earlier was almost too much, definitely not your average country girl. Could she really have some serious medical skills?



Reese followed Aiden into the study. Aiden pointed to a chair in front of him.



"Take a seat."



Reese,focused on treating Malcolm, didn't want to waste time and preferred getting straight to the point.


"No need, Grandpa. Just say what you need to say," Aiden appreciated the directness and got right to it.


"Can you really cure Malcolm?"


"I can't promise it'll be quick, but I'll give it my all. Malcolm's leg is kinda weird," Reese raised an eyebrow.



Ajden frowned, "What do you mean?"



"For a while now, someone's been giving him some kind of drug. I'm still figuring out what it is, but I can tell you,if he keeps taking it, he's gonna end up needing an amputation."



"What!"' Aiden's face darkened, shock written all over it.
###Chapter 11 He Isn't That Fragile


Who in the Flynn Villa's got the guts to mess with Malcolm from the Flynn family?


Reese wasn't planning on spilling the beans to Aiden this soon.but seeing how much he genuinely cared for Malcolm and how sharp he was, she decided to clue him in.


Another big reason? Aiden was willing to trust her. She was also setting the stage for her own peace in the Flynn family.


This way, even if Everly and Alyssa tried to frame her again,they wouldn't be able to cause much of a ruckus.


"I don't know exactly who it is. Not my problem. I'm just here to fix Malcolm."



Aiden squinted at Reese, unsure if he should buy what she was selling, given her odd vibe. Then he realized Reese was their last shot, after all, they'd seen so many doctors who couldn't figure out Malcolm's issue.


"Alright, how much time do you need?"


Reese frowned, thinking it over. "At least half a month. If it takes longer.no promises."


She was still figuring out what kind of drug they used.She needed to study it to come up with the right treatment.


Aiden's face turned serious at her uncertain answer.


"I'll give you half a month to cure Malcolm, or I'll havre to treat you as the culprit."



"Grandpa, are you threatening me?" Reese's eyes flickered,a faint, cold smile playing on her lips.



"It's not exactly a threat. We're just out of options.Malcolm's leg... I've talked to so many top doctors, and every time, our hopes were crushed. I'm worried that if this keeps up. Malcolm might just give up himself."



"He isn't that fragile," Reese shot back confidently. From her brief time with Malcolm, she could tell his mental toughness wasn't lacking. Besides, no way was the guy she married some weakling.


She locked eyes with Aiden, determination blazing.′′NOmatter what happens, even if it comes to amputation,he'll handle it.Otherwise, Grandpa,you wouldn't still have hope for him,
right?"


It was clear Aiden had a soft spot for Malcolm.Word was,the Flynn family had more than one grandson. Given Malcolm's messed-up leg and Aiden still holding out hope, Malcolm had to have something special, He wasn't going down easy.


Aiden suddenly realized Reese might be just what Malcolm needed. Maybe she could crack open that window in Malcolm's heart. She saw things others missed. A smile slowly crept across his wrinkled face. This Reese,while not a perfect match for Malcolm in looks. was sharp and far from the fool she seemed.



"Malcolm's in your hands now."


"I'll do my best."


Don't worry about Alyssa and Everly. Those two have been spoiled rotten." Aiden felt the need to explain, given that his grandson's future was in her hands.


"Alright, Grandpa, don't worry. I gotta go."


As Reese left the study, the polite smile on her face faded.
Every single one of them in this rich family was a master actor.


Aiden might seem polite, but if she couldn't fix Malcolm...


She probably wouldn't even make it out the door.
###Chapter 12 Only Qualified for a Janitor


After dinner, Aiden dropped a bombshell.


"Since Reese is now part of our family, it's not cool for her to just hang around at home all day. Everyone in the Flynn family has a job. How about she joins the company as Malcolm's assistant?"



Alyssa, sitting nearby, couldn't help but snicker. "Grandpa,you seem to forget that even being Malcolm's assistant requires a master's degree. Reese is from the sticks and probably hasn't even been to college. If she joins the company, she'll just be fetching coffee and water for Malcolm. It'd be embarrassing to take her out."



Everly jumped in, not wanting to miss a chance to mock Reese."Grandpa, our family doesn't need her to get by. Why not just let her be a janitor?"



"Yeah, a janitor job would be perfect for her. Didn't she do a lot of housework in the countryside? Maybe she could even become the head janitor."



Aiden slammed the table. "Enough! Even if Reese hasn't had much education, she doesn't need to be a janitor. If word gets out, how could we explain it to the public and the media?"



Everly and Alyssa covered their mouths, laughing. Even if Aiden was defending her, it was only for the sake of the Flynn family's reputation.



In essence, not letting her be a janitor was just to save face for the family.



Reese's expression didn't change. She looked at Aiden with bright eyes and suddenly said something that left everyone in the room stunned.



"I want to go through a normal interview to join the company." Everly and Alyssa reacted like they had heard the funniest joke ever.



"Have you never seen a company before? Don't you know the current situation of our company? With your qualifications, if you go through a normal interview, you might only be able to apply for a janitor position."


Alyssa snickered and nudged Everly. "Maybe she really just wants to apply for a janitor job. Don't overthink it."



Everly pretended to have a sudden realization. "Right, maybe you just want to apply for a janitor job. That's fine, you can go through the formal process. After all, you're from the countryside, probably not good at anything else, but you might be good at cleaning."


"You two, cut it out."


Malcolm, who had been silent, suddenly spoke, his voice as cold as ice, making everyone shiver. Alyssa had always been quite afraid of him. Even from 10 feet away,she could still feel his strong vibe, which made her a shiver. She instinctively grabbed Everly's arm, her fingertips tightening.



Everly quickly explained, "Alyssa didn't mean it that way.She's just worried that this woman has no education at all,probably can't even read. Moreover, considering her outfit,she does look like the cleaning staff in the company."



Malcolmn's attitude was firm, and today he was wearing a black shirt and black pants, making him look both cold and noble."Even so, she is my wife. Are we abandoning the Flynn family's rules?"



Everly bit her lip, a surge of anger in her heart that she didn't dare to express. She couldn't understand why Malcolm,was.suddenly being so nice to this woman. If this continued, it would definitely beincreasingly unfavorable for them in the future. They had to find an opportunity to deal with her properly. Alyssa, intimidated by his piercing gaze, didn't dare to speak again. The atmosphere became oppressive and dreary.



Reese, on the other hand, looked at Malcolm not far away with surprise. She hadn't expected him to defend her, and she felt a bit more favorable towards him. A man who didn't protect his wife was not a good man.
###Chapter 13 She Just Didn't Want to Stand Out
Aiden cleared his throat and started talking. "Alright, let's just have Reese join as a regular employee for now. No need for an interview. And the media still doesn't know Malcolm's hitched.So keep it on the down-low for now; it'll be better for Reese."



That was exactly what Reese was thinking. She didn't want to become the target of all the female employees' jealousy.



"Okay, I'm cool with that."



Aiden seemed pretty happy with her response.



Back in her room, Alyssa threw all her fancy cosmetics off the table in a fit."Why does that woman get to join the company?Just look at her, she's a total embarrassment to the Flynn family."Everly had a different take. She grabbed Alyssa's hand before she could throw more stuff. "Chill out. Think about it, this could actually work in our favor. Grandpa only made her a regular employee, and we're all above her. Do you really think she's gonna have it easy in the company?"



"But didn't you see how Malcolm's already starting to protect her? I'm worried..." Alyssa felt Reese could become a big problem for them.


"Malcolm's always swamped with work. We'll catch him when he's too busy to look out for her. That's when we strike.
Remember,we're family,and Reese is just an outsider."


No matter how much Malcolm cared for Reese now,the bond and history they had as family would always outweigh any connection with an outsider like Reese.



Back in their room, Malcolm handed Reese a card. "Here's a no-limit supplementary card. Go buy whatever you need. Even if we haven't set you up with a great position yet, at least get yourself some new outfits."
Reese waved her hand dismissively. "Nah, É'm good. I seill have some cash. It's enough for clothes."



"Take it," Malcolm insisted,practically shoving the card into her hand. "You're my wife now. You can't be living like you re still in the sticks, looking al1 shabby."


Reese wanted to argue that she wasn't living shabbily at all.She just preferred to keep a low profile and not draw attention.



She didn't want to stir up any unnecessary drama. Even though she kept to herself, the Flynn familystill didn't like her.



"Alright," shesaid, deciding to hold onto the card for now,even though she had no intention of using Malcolm's money.


Seeing her accept it, Malcolm's frown eased up.

 
Just then, Justin had dug up some info and shot a message to Malcolm.



Justin: [Mr. Flynn. I've found out that Mrs. Flynn did study medicine, but it was just at some ordinary medical school for a bit before she left. Couldn't track her after that.J



Malcolm wasn't shocked by this. Given her skilled treatment methods, she must've studied medicine somewhere.



But none of the top docs could fix his leg. Could Reese really pull it off?



After just two treatments from Reese, he could already feel a bit of sensation, even if it was faint.



He always had a hunch that Reese was more than she seemed,definitely not just some regular doctor. Otherwise, how could his leg start to feel again so quickly?


Malcolm replied with a thoughtful look in his eyes: [Keep digging into her past. No matter what, don't stop!]


Justin simply replied: [Got it.]


Reese noticed Malcolm staring at his phone,lost in thought.She didn't shy away and leaned over to peek, her expression calm.



"Are you talking about me?"
###Chapter 14 Quick Reflexes

Malcolm's eyes flickered with a mix of embarrassment and disbelief.Seriously? How could she be so blunt?Most folks would just pretend they didn't see anything if they caught a glimpse of somneone else's phone. But not her. Nope, she's gotta confirm it.

Reese just grabbed his phone, skimmed through their chat, and handed it back like it was no big deal.

"Uh..."

"Chill,it's cool you wanna check on me. But if you're curious, just ask me straight up." She plopped down on the edge of the bed and wrapped her arm around Malcolm's. "We're married now, gotta keep it real with each other,right?"

Reese had this easy smile, but Malcolm's eyes dropped to her hand on his arm. "Let go."
His tone left no room for argument.

Reese picked up on the fact that he wasn't into being touched. She didn't mean anything by it, just saw him stressing over checking on her and wanted to help him relax.

She let go, pouting a bit. "Alright, alright."

Honestly, she called him out on purpose. If she really wanted to know what they were chatting about, she didn't need to make a scene. Being a top hacker, she could've checked that message in a heartbeat.

Malcolm turned his head and caught sight of the smooth,delicate skin behind her ear. But why was her face a different color?

Was she really hiding something from him? Lost in thought, he slowly reached out to Reese,his fingertips brushing her hair aside and pinching her earlobe. Nothing came off on his hand, proving that was her real skin color. But her face...

His hand was about to touch her face when Reese dodged, eyeing him warily.

"Why are you touching my ear?"

Malcolm's eyes sparkled as he said, "You're my wife now.It's only natural for me to touch you."

He figured,Touching her earlobe is no big deal. Heck,even getting intimate is reasonable.'

Reese looked up, her eyes sharp as she shot back, "Then why did you freak out when I just held your hand?"

"I've always been like this."

"Well, I don't like being touched by others either. Even if you're my husband, we're not that close yet."

Reese threw his own logic right back at him.

Malcolm didn't expect Reese to be so sharp. Having her around might actually help dodge some unnecessary drama. He figured he should make the most of her skills.

Not wanting to argue anymore, he switched gears and raised an eyebrow, "So, can you tell me your real identity?"

Reese had already decided not to keep it from him.Without his trust, the treatment couldn't go on.

More importantly, she was worried Malcolm had his own info network. If he dug up her other identities, things could get messy.

"I used to work in a hospital, but I got in through
connections.My grandma was a doctor and taught me a lot of medical stuff." Malcolm squinted at her, looking half-skeptical.

"Is it that simple?"

"What else? Some big shot? Come on, if I really were.how could I end up marrying some random guy?"

She said this, pretending to be super chill, and gave Malcolm a pat on the shoulder.

Malcolm was speechless. Did Reese forget what he just said?

Reese thought that treating his leg could bring them closer. She saw it as a chance. Even if she couldn't get him to spill everything, she could at least get a general idea.

"Let me massage your leg. It'll help with your recovery.I've got this unique technique that'll make you feel amazing." Malcolm nearly choked on his water, his face twisting in surprise.

Seeing him struggle, Reese quickly patted his back. "Take it easy, no one's racing you."
Once Malcolm calmed down, he suddenly grabbed Reese's wrist and pulled her towards him. She was caught off guard, and her lips bumped into his chin.

Both of them froze.

Malcolm stared at her face, mostly hidden by thick bangs and those black-framed glasses. He suddenly got curious about what she looked like underneath them.

He slowly reached out, his fingertips just brushing the frame when Reese quickly pushed him away.

Malcolm was caught off guard, his upper body swaying slightly, but he managed to stay seated. Reese eyed him warily. "Why are you tryingto take off my glasses?"

"I just want to see what my wife really looks like. Or are you hiding something from me?"

Reese's heart raced under his intense gaze, and she quickly adjusted her glasses.
###Chapter 15 No Way I'm Playing Along


"I'm so ugly, I might just ruin your appetite."

Malcolm had never heard anyone talk about themselves like that.

"Most girls wanna look all dolled up, but you're different. You dress like you're trying to blend into the wallpaper. Doesn't that make people wonder?"

Reese, not wanting him to dig any deeper, quickly waved her hand like it was no big deal.

"Who cares what I look like? The important thing is,let me fix up your leg."

She wasn't planning on sticking around the Flynn family forever. She'd be out of there soon enough. Better to stay under the radar and avoid any awkward run-ins later.

Malcolm,surprisingly patient for once, decided to play the long game.

After all, she was his wife. She wasn't going anywhere. No need to rush.

He raised an eyebrow at her. "Weren't you gonna give my leg a massage?"

Reese looked at him, confused.

"Didn't you just say you don't want to?"

"When did I say that? I just meant that from now on, you can only act cute in front of me."

Was this some kind of male ego thing? Reese finally got why Malcolm had freaked out earlier.

He clearly wasn't into it, but his pride and possessiveness were off the charts.Malcolm was just that kind of guy, she guessed.

On the outside, he seemed all cool and detached, like he didn't care about anything. But he could still get jealous. That was a curveball for her.


She'd never really dealt with other guys before and always thought they were boring and mostly driven by their primal urges.


Except for the idiots in her family, who only cared about making money and couldn't give a damn about feelings.


She smirked and pointed at Malcolm. "You're jealous. So, Mr. Flynn can get jealous, too."

Malcolm,realizing she'd caught on, felt a bit embarrassed and pinched her cheek.

"I just don't like others touching what's mine. Don't read too much into it."


Reese's eyes sparkled with a smile. "Don't worry, I'm just like you. Even though we don't have feelings for each other, we're at least a couple in name. Don't worry, hubby, I'll protect you from now on."

Malcolm sneered. "You, protect me?"

It wasn't that Malcolm underestimated her; it was just the plain truth.


Reese playfully blinked at him.

"But you still need me to figure out who's secretly messing with you, don't you?"


Malcolm stayed quiet.

The truth was, he already had it all figured out. But watching Reese puff up with pride was kinda entertaining, so he kept it to himself for now.

After dinner, Malcolm called Justin into the room. The vibe was tense, like something bigwas about to go down.


With a serious look, Justin addressed Malcolm respectfully.

"Mr. Flynn, what do you need me to do?"

At that moment, Malcolm's eyes lost any hint of warmth. He was all businéss, like a king laying down the law.


"Spread the word that my leg is gradually recovering."

Justin looked puzzled and worried. "But if you do that, the one behind this will try to hurt you again."

"It doesn't matter. Just do it. Only then can he get anxious. When people get anxious, they tend to slip up and show their hand."


Justin quickly caught on and nodded slightly.

"Got it."

Meanwhile,Reese was chilling on the steps in the backyard with her laptop, fingers flying over the keyboard.

The screen showed Calvin logging in.

Calvin: [Reese, you're finally online. I have good news for you. The stock you recommended last time made a profit.]


Calvin wasn't surprised at all. Reese was a big deal in the financial world,especially with her sharp instincts.Anything she touched turned to gold. Calvin: [Also, Reese, someone is eager to collaborate with our company lately.]

Reese frowned: [Do I need to handle this myself?]

She didn't think such a minor issue needed her personal touch.

Calvin knew this, too. He hesitated for a moment before typing a few more words on the screen.

Calvin: [But the other party isn't just anyone. It's someone from your husband's side.]

Malcolm?

This was more complicated. She didn't want to raise his suspicions. That guy was naturally paranoid, so she had to tread carefully.

It must be that Calvin and the others had been too high-profile latey,making the top-ranked Flynn Group in the financial world suspicious of them, who were ranked second. However, Malcolm didn't know she was the real mastermind behind the company. He couldn't find out even if he tried.

Reese thought for a moment and quickly replied: [I'll handle it in a couple of days. You guys stay put for now.]


Calvin: [Understood.]

After logging off, Reese pondered how to turn down Malcolm's cooperation·without raising any red flags.
###Chapter 16 Oh No, My Makeup's Ruined


"Hey, by the way, I'll whip up another batch of meds for you after work tomorrow. Been tinkering with this one for a few days. If it does the trick, it might speed up your recovery even more."

Malcolm noticed her eyes lighting up like she just found buried treasure,and she was grinning from ear to ear.

It was his legs being shot, but Reese seemed more worried about it than he was.

Still, having his wife fuss over him felt pretty nice.

He put a hand on her shoulder, his handsome face close to hers, and raised an eyebrow with a smirk.

"Well,that's your call."

Reese gave herself a confident pat. "Leave it to me."


With that,Reese headed to the bathroom to run a bath for him, tossing in the medicinal herbs she had prepped. These were supposed to be great for his legs.

When she came back out, she moved behind Malcolm.

"T'll wheel you in for your bath."

"Are you gonna help me bathe?"

Reese's eye twitched. "Me, help you bathe?"

That didn't seem right. Men and women are different, right? Plus, it was just his legs that were messed up.not his hands. But Malcolm didn't seem embarrassed at all. In fact, he acted like it was the most natural thing in the world.

"We're married. Isn't it normal for a wife to help her husband bathe?"

"Next time, okay? I still need to sterilize the needles, it's a whole process."

Reese's eyes darted around, a bit shy, her cheeks turning a light shade of pink.

Malcolm was just messing with her. If she was a bit shy, wasn't he,too?

"Alright,go ahead then."


Reese let out a sigh of relief and turned to leave, but Malcolm suddenly called her back.

"Aren't you gonna help me take off my pants?"

It was kinda tricky for him.


Reese quickly turned back and walked up to him, pressing down on his belt buckle. With a click, she unfastened the belt, then the zipper.

Her hands started to tremble for no reason, and her cheeks grew hot.

Malcolm watched her slender fingers trembling like crazy and suddenly grabbed her hand. Reese instinctively looked up and locked eyes with Malcolm's intense gaze, which seemed to be hiding some deep,complicated emotions.


His voice was deeper than usual. "I'll handle it."

Reese quickly pulled her hand back. Malcolm unzipped his pants, and Reese helped him pull them down. By the time she was done, sweat was beading on her forehead. She raised her hand to wipe it, and her disguise came off on her hand. She was startled,' Oh no, my makeup's ruined.'

"I'll head out first. You go ahead and bathe."


With that, Reese hurriedly ran out.

Malcolm frowned. Why was she so flustered? Was taking off pants that nerve-wracking?

Once outside, Reese quickly grabbed a mirror to check. Sure enough, her makeup was a mess. She swiftly took out her makeup kit and touched it up, finally feeling relieved.

Every moment spent with Malcolm was truly nerve-wracking.

When Malcolm came out, she had already prepped the needles.

During the treatment, she was super cautious and serious because each acupuncture point had different effects and side effects.


If she messed up, the Flynn family would definitely not let it slide.

After finishing, she put everything back in place and asked him, "Do you feel any better?"

Malcolm tried to move a bit. Although there wasn't much progress, he felt somewhat better than before, at least with some sensations.


This made him very excited.


"I can feel something.Does that mean it's working?"

"Really? You can feel it?" "Yeah."

Reese's face lit up with a smile. "That's awesome. It means it's working. I'll keep treating you like this. If all goes well, your legs should be able to touch the ground in a few days."

She wasn't just boasting; she was pretty confident in her medical skills.


Malcolm hadn't expected Reese's medical skills to be so top-notch. It seemed he had indeed married a capable wife.
###Chapter 17 Dahlia's Mlockery


The next day. Reese spruced herself up a bit. just slapped on some lipstick and did her eyebrows. Her skin was still as dark as ever, and she switched to a pair of glasses with golden rims. She was heading to work.after all, and didn't want to look like a total mess.


She wasn't in the mood to be the hot topic among her female coworkers.

She got to the mall an hour early, grabbed a cab. Not many folks around at this time, so she could snag some clothes and bounce.


She walked into her favorite brand's store and picked out a few outfits, but the sales clerk totally uninterested.just standing there like a statue.


No shocker there. In these high-end places, they always judged you by your looks.

With her cheap getup, it was a miracle they hadn't booted her out.

Reese was about to head to the counter to pay, ready to drop some jaws.

Then, out of nowhere, a sharp female voice cut through the air.

"Isn't this our dear sister who just married into the Flynn family?"


Reese knew that voice anywhere.Dahlia.


She turned around, forcing a smile.

"Yeah, what a coincidence."


Dahlia gave Reese the once-over, dripping with disdain. She couldn't figure out if Reese had lost her mind or what. Coming from the sticks, if her face was any less presentable,her days with the Flynn family would be rough.


But Reese had gone and made herself look like a total country bumpkin. Was she begging for trouble?

Well,it gave Dahlia the perfect chance to roast her.

"My dear sister, what happened to you? Playing dress-up or just too broke to buy clothes? The Flynn family is huge, can't they even get you a single outfit? If you're that hard up, just say the word. and I'll throw you a few."


Reese wasn't even paying attention to Dahlia. Her eyes were on the guy next to her, a middle-aged dude in his forties.


She'd heard the rumors about Dahlia dating an older guy, and here he was, in the flesh.

Reese smirked and tilted her chin towards the man.

"So,switched up your taste? Going for the older crowd now?"

Dahlia shot a nervous glance at the guy next to her and stammered.

"He's just my business partner. Stop making stuff up."

Reese nodded, clearly amused by Dahlia's discomfort.

"Oh, business partners are that close now? Holding hands and all?"

She'd seen Dahlia holding hands with the guy, and she recognized the limited-edition bag Dahlia was flaunting. That thing cost at least a hundred grand.

Kenneth might spoil Dahlia, but he wouldn't drop a hundred grand on a bag just like that. The company wasn't doing great lately, and even Nancy wouldn't fork over that kind of cash to Dahlia.


Dahlia snorted, "I know you're just jealous 'cause I'm living it up while you're stuck with that paralyzed guy.You're trying to get under my skin, but it's not gonna work."


Reese felt a pang at the word "paralyzed."

No matter what, Malcolm was a looker, and his legs could be fixed. Once he was back on his feet, Dahlia would eat her words.


She shot Dahlia a sharp,piercing look.

Dahlia's heart skipped a beat. How could Reese look at her like that? What was that feeling just now? Fear?No way!


A country girl daring to challenge her, did she even know whose turf she was on?

With that thought, Dahlia regained her confidence and glanced around the clothing store, her eyes lighting up.


"What,you think you can afford this place? You can't even buy a scarf here,let alone the clothes."

Reese shrugged and sneered, meeting Dahlia's provocative gaze head-on.

"How do you know I can't afford the clothes here?"

Not just the clothes, with one call to Calvin, she could buy the entire brand.
###Chapter 18 Global Limited Edition Card


Dahlia thought Reese was just showing off. "Alright. let's see what kind of magic you've got to buy clothes from this place." Reese started by picking out a couple of items, then grabbed a few more and dumped them on the counter."T'll take all of these."

Dahlia stood there with her arms crossed, ready to watch Reese crash and burn. She probably had no clue how pricey this stuff was-each piece was at least tens of thousands of dollars. And she was going for the limited editions, which meant the price was doubled since there was only one size available for each.

Looking at Reese's outfit, Dahlia thought, 'Even if she wore these clothes, she'd still be an ugly duckling.'

The sales clerk was just as shocked. This girl, dressed so plainly, had a knack for picking out the priciest items in the store. She couldn't decide if Reese was lucky or just clueless.

But hey, a sale's a sale. The clerk asked, "So, you paying by card or cash?"

"Card." Reese pulled out a card from her bag and handed it to the clerk. At first, the clerk thought it was just a regular credit card and didn't think much of it.


After all, lots of folks used credit cards these days, paying in installments to keep up appearances and all that.

But when she swiped the card, her eyes nearly popped out of her head. This card... was no ordinary card.

She looked at Reese in shock. Who was this plain-looking girl?

The clerk's gaze was a bit weird, and Reese knew exactly what was going through her mind. She glanced at the register. "What are you standing there for? Hurry up, I gotta go.""Oh, right. sorry. Just a moment."


After swiping. the clerk handed the card back to Reese, but before she could take if, Dahlia snatched if away.

"Let me see that." Dahlia examined the card. It was black, but the texture was different, not like a regular credit card. It looked understated, but Dahlia had a feeling this card was something special.


The guy next to her recognized it immediately.


"Isn't this the Centurion Black Card? Only three in the world. How the heck does she have one?"


Dahlia spun around. eyes wide. "Nicholas, are you sure this card is that valuable?"


Nicholas nodded. "I saw it once with a seriously rich dude. This card is like a golden ticket to VIP treatment everywhere. The person who owns it is literally a big shot."

Dahlia pressed on, "Do you know who holds these cards?"


"One is Malcolm fromn the Flynn family, and another is Simon Brown."


"And the third?"


"No one knows. It's a mystery. Rumor has it, it's a woman, drop-dead gorgeous, with an aura that could stop traffic. But that's just hearsay."


Nicholas's animated storytelling had everyone in the store buzzing with curiosity-everyone except Reese, who stayed cool as a cucumber, She even found it a bit funny. When did her reputation get so legendary? Sure,she kept a low profile, but this was next level.

Drop-dead gorgeous, with an extraordinary aura?


Dahlia couldn't help but think it sounded a bit like Reese. Despite her current plain look, Dahlia had seen her true face, which was indeed stunning. She just couldn't figure out why Reese would join the Flynn family looking so ugly.

But it suited her just fine. She liked Reese being unremarkable; it made her shine even more.

Dahlia stared at Reese, eyes full of doubt. "Would Malcolm really be so generous as to give you such a prestigious card?"


"My husband spoils me. Is that so hard to believe? Why doni't you get the guy next to you to give you a card.too? That way, you won't have to keep swapping boyfriends. If your mom finds out you're dating someone so much older, she might want to strangle you."

Reese never held back when it came to clapping back at Dahlia.


Only she knew how her mother had been driven to death by Dahlia and her mom, how Nancy had wormed her way into Kenneth's life and convinced him to send Reese to the countryside.

To this day, few people knew that the Brooks family had another daughter.

But she didn't care for that title at all.

Dahlia glared at Reese, furious. "You can say whatever you want, but evên if you do, my mom won't believe you."


"Really? What if I send her the photos of you at the hotel? Think she'll believe it then?"

"You... how do you know, Reese? Are you stalking me?"
###Chapter 19 Not the Beauty Route


Dahlia's face went ghost-white. Yeah, she had rented a room with Nicholas once, but that was just 'cause she had her eye on a sweet ride. Her family's finances were in the toilet, and the company was tanking too. So Nancy and Kenneth had slashed her allowance, let alone buying any luxury splurges for her.

And now, even that witch Reese was living better than her. No way she could let that slide.

Reese just smirked. Stalking her? Please. She was a top-tier hacker. If she wanted to dig up dirt on someone.it was just a piece of cake.


She snatched the card back, tossed it in her bag,and lifted her chin with confidence.


"If you don't want people to know, don't do it in the first place."

With that,Reese grabbed her clothes and strutted out of the store, head held high.


Dahlia watched her leave, fuming. She chucked her phone and let out a scream.

Damn it, I've gotta find a way to deal with her,' she thought.


Seeing Dahlia all riled up, Nicholas slid his arm around her shoulder.

"Come on, babe, don't let that bitch get to you. Weren't you gonna buy some clothes? Go ahead and pick something out."


Dahlia's eyes lit up with an idea. "If you really care about me, then get back at her. I want her totally humiliated."


Once Reese's reputation was trashed, no way the Flynn family would keep her around. Nicholas felt a pang of guilt, but he didn't want to look weak in front of Dahlía, so he made up an excuse.


"But babe, she's part of the Flynn family. If Malcolm finds out we messed with his wife... we're toast."

Dahlia didn't givre a damn about that. She was laser-focused on making Reese pay.


She shot Nicholas a look and started to pout.


"Didn't you say you liked me? Said you'd give me anything I wanted. Now you're backing out?"


Hearing Dahlia's sultry voice, Nicholas got all hot and bothered and decided to throw caution to the wind.


"Alright, whatever you say. But tonight, you better make it worth my while."

Nicholas practically pressed himself against Dahlia as he spoke.


After they left,the sales clerk shook her head.

"Man, some people will do anything for cash. That couple just now? Gave me the creeps."

One of them glanced at the computer."Why's the info still up? You didn't close the system?"


"The name on this card is Reese. It's a chick."


They exchanged looks, suddenly realizing. Could that plain girl just now be...


Reese took her clothes to the restroom, changed, and checked herself out in the mirror. She definitely looked way better than in that floral disaster she had on before.


Standing outside, she glanced up at the shiny, golden letters of the Flynn Group.


She walked into the HR department and slapped her acceptance letter on the desk. "I'm here to start."

The person barely looked up at her.

"Alright, go report to your department. They'll set you up with a seat."

Chewing gum. Reese turned and left. A few others huddled together,whispering.

"Is she the one who got in without an interview?"


"No clue what her deal is. I thought she must be a knockout to get in like that. But now, I'm not so sure."


"So,what's her angle?"

"Beats me."


Reese made her way to the director's office and knocked on the door.

"Come in."

That voice made her pause. Wasn't that Everly?


She had run her again. Neither of the Flynn family's two girls liked her, so it looked like a showdown was on the horizon.


Pushing the door open, Everly saw Reese and didn't look surprised. She had been expecting this.


Reese knew Everly didn't like her and didn't bother trying to get on her good side. That would just make her look weak, and she couldn't afford that.


"Where is my seat?"
"Follow me, Ill show you." Everly got up and walked pastReese, Reese blew a bubble and trailed right  behind her.
###Chapter 20 Can You Chill?


As they stepped into the elevator, Everly kept her eyes glued to the descending numbers, totally ignoring Reese.


"Listen up, just 'cause you got into the company doesn't mean it's all sunshine and rainbows. This is just the start. I'm not gonna make it easy for you unless you ditch Malcolm on your own."


Reese knew Everly couldn't resist stirring the pot. She'd seen these lame moves countless times before.


She let out an exaggerated sigh. "Man, you Flynn folks are so petty. My joining the family is a blessing. If it weren't for me, Malcolm's leg would be toast by now. Instead of treating me like a hero, you're all just throwing shade."


Everly shot her a look of pure disdain."You? My other brother, Vincent, is a medical prodigy and even he couldn't fix Malcolm's leg. And you think you can?"


Reese seemed to catch onto something.

"Wait, did you say your other brother is a medical genius?"


"Hillbilly, if you don't even know that, maybe you should Google it."


Reese's lips curled into a sly grin. Looked like she might've just figured out the root of the problem.
®
Everly gave Reese a once-over and noticed she was rocking the latest fashion. Everly hadn't even had the chance to snag it yet, but Reese was already flaunting it.


And she claimed she didn't marry Malcolm for the cash. Yeah, right. Who's buying that?


But... seeing her in professional attire instead of those baggy jackets, if you ignored her face, her figure was actually better than Everly's. Standing at 5'6", in a black shirt and tailored pants, with high heels,she looked way more feminine than before.


The only downside was her face... it just didn't match her vibe.


Thank goodness Reese's face wasn't a knockout. Otherwise, every single guy in the company would be falling over themselves for her.


Thinking about it made Everly uneasy. Why should Reese steal her thunder at the company the moment she showed up?


She snorted,"I really don't know what kind of tricks you pulled to get Malcolm to hand over his card. Enjoy your fancy life while you can. Soon enough, we will kick you out, and you'll be back in your shabby little hometown."


Everly touched the fabric of Reese's shirt with disdain, curling her lips.


"Clothes like these? You probably couldn't afford them in a million years."


The hillbilly had surprisingly good taste, picking out limited edition items.


Reese didn't care about these snide remarks, but she wasn't one to take it lying down either.


She smiled sweetly, looking at Everly with a playful glint in her eye.

"Your words remind me, while I'm still Malcolm's wife, I should hurry up and use his money to live it up Otherwise, what if he doesn't want me after his leg is healed?"


Everly's eyes widened, not expecting Reese to be so shameless.


"You... how can you talk like that? Don't you have any shame?" Reese looked at her innocently.


"Aren't you the one who told me?"


"I..." Everly rolled her eyes. Not only was Reese unattractive, but she also didn't speak logically. Anyone with a bit of shame wouldn't say such things.


Entering the office area, Everly glanced around at the colleagues and clapped her hands.


"Alright, everyone, listen up! I'd like to introduce our new colleague, Reese."


The colleagues looked over and the whispers started.

"What's up with this girl? She's so plain. Look at those spots on her face, her skin, and that outdated hairstyle.She looks like she's stuck in the past and completely out of touch with current trends."


"But did you notice she's rocking a limited edition outfit from a high-end brand? That brand only makes one piece per size. I saw this set in a magazine. It costs at least $100,000,maybe more."


"No way... looking like that and wearing such expensive clothes just makes it worse."


Everly felt a surge of pride. This department was notorious for its sharp tongues and gossip.

Malcolm hadn't officially acknowledged Reese's status in the company, which gave Everly plenty of room to maneuver. She had been worried about how to handle them, so she'd let Reese face the music first.


"Everyone, make sure to get along with our new colleague."
###Chapter 21 Betting on Yourself to Win?


Reese could tell there was more to Everly's words than met the eye.


As Everly kept yapping, Reese's frustration grew, her brows knitting together and her brown eyes flashing with impatience.


Out of nowhere, Reese raised her voice, "Miss Flynn, where do you want me to sit?"


Everly shot her a look that could kill. Was Reese trying to make her go deaf?

She pointed to a dusty corner. "Over there. And clean it up yourself."


Reese glanced over. The dust was so thick you could write your name in it, and the spot was totally out of the way.


Everly's plan was obvious. She wanted everyone tosee Reese as the unwanted newbie, hoping they'd all gang up on her.


But Everly was in for a surprise. If she thought Reese would just take it, she was in for a rude awakening.


Seeing Reese's frown, Everly thought she was about to get an earful, giving her the perfect chance to flex her authority.


"What, Reese,you got a probtem with my setup?"


"Nope, I love it. Nice and quiet for work. Thanks, Miss Flynn."

Reese's attitude was all sunshine and rainbows, complete with a smile.

Everly was thrown off. Why was Reese suddenly so chill? Seeing Reese smile like she just won the lottery only made Everly more ficked off. She snapped, "Wel, enjoy your peace and quiet."


And with that, Everly stormed off in a huff.


Reese's smile disappeared in a flash. She headed to her designated spot and started cleaning, humming a little tune as she worked.


The other colleagues exchanged confused glances.

"Is Reese clueless? Does she not get what that spot means? And she's still willing to sit there."

"If she's not playing some deep game, then she's just plain dumb."


"But we all know how Miss Flynn rolls. We all heard her. Reese better watch her back."

"I bet she won't last a month before she bails."

"Same here, I'm in. Loser buys dinner."


In the end, everyone was betting that Reese would be out of the company within a month. No one thought she'd stick around.


One colleague frowned, "What do we do? If no one bets she'll stay, we can't make a proper bet."

Suddenly, a voice cut through the chatter.

"I'll bet on winning."


That voice...


Everyone turned to look. Reese's eyes were bright and determined, showing no hint of doubt. It was like she was talking about someone else entirely.

A female colleague asked, stunned. "You're betting on yourself to win?"

"Yeah,you all think I won't last a month here, right? So I'll bet the opposite."

Since she got here, leaving was never on her mind.

But that wasn't their problem. As long as someone bet against them, they were sure they'd win.

"Alright, it's a deal then. Loser buys dinner."


"How about this? Since you're all so confident, let's up the ante. Loser buys dinner at the priciest restaurant in town."


Reese said it so casually, it nearly made everyone's jaws drop.

"Alright, then we can all look forward to a fancy meal," someone chimed in.

Reese flashed a devilish grin. Who'd actually enjoy that fancy meal was still up for grabs.

After the bet was set, Reese got down to cleaning her desk with meticulous care. She was a bit of a neat freak and demanded perfection in everything she did.


Just as she settled in, Susan Foster strutted over. With her brown hair and fierce eyebrows, she had a very mean look.


She dumped a hefty stack of documents onto Reese's desk.


"Get these done before lunch. Miss Flynn needs them."

Reese was here to work, and as long as it was her job, she'd do it right. She didn't argue, just grabbed the documents and got to it.


The girl next to Susan snickered and whispered, "I think she's really clueless. It's obvious Miss Flynn can't stand her. We're not gonna be nice to her either. And she bet on staying and dining at the priciest place? She probably can't even afford it."


Susan shook her head. "You probably didn't notice her outfit. It's a limited edition."


The girl was skeptical. "Could be a knockoff. There are tons of them online. My friend bought one, and it looks just like the real deal. You can't tel unless you look real close."


"Really?" Susan asked, already planning to snag one herself when she got her paycheck.

Reese heard every word but just smiled to herself.


They probably had never seen the real deal, which was why they thought the genuine article was fake.


By noon, Reese had wrapped up the documents and placed them on Susan's desk.

"All done. You hand them in, or should I?"


Susan stared at the mountain of papers, stammering in disbelief.


"You... finished already?"
"Yep. Want to check them?" 


Susan flipped through a few pages and was stunned to see that Reese had nailed it. The formatting,translation, and even the annotations were spot on.


She hadn't expectedReese to be this good. "Go have lunch," Susan said, trying to mask her shock.She needed a moment to process this and couldn't let Reese see her flustered. It'd be too embarrassing.


Reese headed to the cafeteria. While she was waiting in line, someone cut in front of her, shoving her asíde.She didn't want to stir up troubole, but she also wasn't a pushover.


She walked up and tapped the guy on the shoulder.


"Hey, no cutting in line. Didn't your moral teacher teach you that?"


Isaac Hayes was well-connected, known by the higher-ups. No one dared to mess with him. Usually, people just let him cut in the cafeteria line.


But Reese had the guts to call him out.

Seeing Isaac about to blow his top, the other colleagues quickly backed away.


Isaac was intimidating, with a fierce and menacing look. Even though Reese wasn't much shorter, she didn't have the advantage in size.


Isaac glared at Reese. "You're new here, right? If you don't know the rules, go ask someone else."


*****************


She was a pawn abandoned by her family, forced into a marriage with the rumored disabled and tyrannical CEO of a wealthy dynasty.


Everyone waited to see the tragic joke of this union, unaware that this marriage would mark the beginning of her shocking rise through high society.

###Chapter 22 What to Do When Your Wife Gets Hurt?


"Oh. no need. I'm right here, so get behind me. It's simple."


Reese stood her ground, not a hint of fear in her eyes.


Isaac rolled up his sleeves, showing off his inked-up arms.'"Oh,you wanna mess with me? Around here,nobody's got the guts to do that. Watch it, or I'll mess you up real bad."


"We'll see about that." Reese balled up her fists and charged, her presence fierce. Isaac was taken aback.


Was this really about to go down?


She had to be nuts. With her tiny frame, she thought she could take him on? She must have a death wish.


But as Reese got closer, Isaac saw a deadly glint in her eyes, and a chill ran down his spine. Even he couldn't figure out why he felt that way.


She was just a young, clueless girl, yet she had the nerve to challenge him.


Isaac shook off his brief moment of fear, grabbed Reese's fist, and was ready to slam her to the ground. The crowd around them gasped.


As Isaac flung Reese, she locked eyes with him, a smug grin on her face. Before he could react, she was already on his shoulders, laneling a solid punch to his face. The pain was intense. Isaac grabbed her hand and tossed her off, but she landed on her feet.


Isaac touched his swollen face, his anger twisting his features.

"You little witch, you hit me? You're gonna regret that..." The cafeteria erupted into chaos.


Justin burst into the office, not even bothering to knock.

Malcolm. a stickler for rules, frowned at Justin's abrupt entrance.

"Justin! Rules?"


Justin felt a pang of guilt. He didn't mean to burst in like that.

"Mr. Flynn, it's... it's Mrs. Flynn. She's throwing down with Isaac in the cafeteria."


Malcolm's brow furrowed."Isaac?"


Isaac was a big, intimidating guy. Most folks at the company wouldn't dare cross him. How did Reese end up in this mess?


"Yeah, the cafeteria's about to turn into a war zone. You need to check it out."


Malcolm gave Justin a light slap upside the head."Why didn't you help Mrs. Flynn first,you moron? What if my wife gets hurt?"


When Justin hustled Malcolm to the scene, they found Reese pinning Isaac to the ground, choking him so hard he couldn't move.


Justin was stunned. "What the...?"


Was this for real? Reese could fight? She could even take down someone like Isaac?

The other employees, seeing Malcolm arrive, quickly stepped aside.


"It's over. Both Isaac and Reese are in deep trouble now. Mr. Flynn can't stand troublemakers, especially ones who wreck the cafeteria."


"Good1. they both deserve it. Isaac's always interrupting others during the meak and not letting anyone talk without getting physical."


"But Reese is new. right? 1 heard she's not just any newbie. She got in through some connections and is a whiz at organizing files and data."


"That's pretty impressive."

Seeing the scene. Malcolm's expression softened, losing its edge. He hadn't realized his wife was so capable.She was turning out to be more and more intriguing.


What other secrets does she have that I don't know about?


He shouted, "Reese, let him go."


Reese turned to look at Malcolm and started to speak. "Mr. Flynn..."


She almost called him something else, maybe because Malcolm had earned her respect when he helped her.


Isaac,lying on the ground all bruised and battered, angrily shouted at Reese.


"Did you hear that? Mr. Flynn told you to let me go!"

Only then did Reese release Isaac, who quickly scrambled over to Malcolm.


"Mr. Flynn, this crazy woman, she..."


Isaac's voice trailed off as he saw the cold, dark glint in Malcolm's eyes, making him shrink back and speak more softly. "She hit me."


"Isaac,I've heard from colleagues that you're a bully and a troublemaker. Do you think the cafeteria belongs to you?"


Malcolm's voice was icy and stern, his brows furrowed, and the invisible pressure made Isaac break out in a cold sweat.


"I.. Mr. Flynn, they're just exaggerating. It was this woman who hit me first."


"So you think it's okay to bully female colleagues?"


Malcolm's gaze was sharp, his features hard and unyielding, sitting there against the light like an inviolable deity.


Isaac was at a loss for words, feeling like the point they focused on was quite different. He was talking about the crazy woman hitting him, but Malcolm not only didn't stand up for him but also held him accountable for bullying female colleagues.


"I..."


"Given that you usually bully colleagues, are unreasonable, and cause trouble in the company,you are demoted to a regular employee. If I hear about you bullying colleagues, especially female colleagues, again,you can submit your resignation."

Isaac was stunned on the spot. "Mr. Flynn, I..."


"Everyone,clear out. Isaac, clean up this mess. I'll have someone check it before the end of the day."


The other colleagues couldn't help but praise Malcolm's actions, finally getting rid of a major troublemaker.They had thought about reporting Isaac directly to Malcolm before, but Isaac always found out and threatened them. Isaac had warned them that if they dared to speak upin front of Malcolm, he'd have his people gee them fired.


Nowadays, finding a job outside isn't easy, and the Flynn Group offers some of the best benefits around.


None of them wanted to leave, so they endured until now. No one expected that Isaac would be dealt with by the new girl. Reese, and a woman at that.


After everyone dispersed, Malcolm called Reese to his ofice. When she entered, she hung her head, her small hands fidgeting in front of her, looking like a schoolgirl who had done something wrong. It was actually kind of cute.


Malcolm looked at her helplessly, wheeling himself forward, his voice soft, no longer as cold and hard as usual.


"Just started and already causing trouble. Did you assume I'd clean up after you?"


When he heard from Justin that Isaac was fighting with her, his heart inexplicably tightened. It was a feeling he hadn't experienced in over twenty years, yet it felt so real.


Who would have thought that when he arrived at the cafeteria, he would see Isaac being completely overpowered by her?


At that moment, his heart settled and he even felt like laughing. What was Reese's deal? She looked so frail,yet she dared to take on someone as burly as Isaac.
###Chapter 23 Can't Embarrass You


Reese naturally didn't want to tick Malcolm off. If he got mad, it wouldn't end well for her. She still needed him big time in the Flyno family, and pissing him off right now was a no-go.


Honestly, sometimes men were like kids and needed some sweet talk, especially guys like Malcolm with their big egos. They needed even more buttering up.

She slowly lifted her head, a smile spreading across her face, her eyes twinkling.


"Babe, my bad. I shouldn't have caused you trouble, but that fat dude pushed me too far. If I backed down out there. wouIdn't that make you look bad?"


Malcolm's heart softened when she called him"babe." Looked like she was ready to butter him up.


He wasn't mad at her; he was just worried she'd get hurt. If he, Malcolm, couldn't even protect his own wife.it'd be a joke if word got out.


Malcolm kept a straight face, hiding the storm inside him.


"You're pretty slick with words. You know how tough Isaac is; even the guys at the company don't mess with him.And you, a girl, dared to take him on. Also, as your husband, how come I didn't know you knew martial arts?"


Reese looked up, grinning.

"Well, you never asked, did you?"

"Well, I'm asking now. What else don't I know about you? Spill it."


His eyes were deep, staring right at her. Reese, who was used to facing all kinds of challenges, actually felt a bit guilty.

Those eyes seemed like they could see right through her.


She dodged his gaze. "There's really nothing else I'm hiding from you. I picked up some martial arts cause my grandma was worried I'd get bullied in the village, so she sent me to a teacher to learn some self-defense."


"Are you sure it'sjust a bit of self-defense?" Malcolm kept pushing, not ready to drop it.

Reese chuckled. "Well, I kinda ended up with a black belt by accident."


Malcolm's eyebrows shot up. His wife was a Taekwondo black belt? Did this mean she might throw hands if they had a fight? Why did he suddenly feel like his personal safety was on the line?


Reese caught onto his thoughts and quickly waved her hand to explain.


"But don't worry, I won't use it on family. Besides, you're my first husband, so I'll definitely be good to you."


Hearing this, Malcolm gave a wicked smile, a dangerous glint in his deep eyes.

"One husband isn't enough? How many more do you want?"


Reese's heart skipped a beat. Oops, she had misspoken again.

Reese quickly corrected herself. "Sorry, I misspoke.Just one, only you."


Malcolm's cold fingertips pinched her chin, his deep eyes filled with icy coldness.

"Yeah, that's what I mean. You can only have me."

Reese shot back,"What if you betray me in the future?" "I won't." He answered tirmly. his eyes dead serious.

Reese waved her hand. smiling as she said, "I was fust asking casually."


She never really thought about being married to Malcolm for a lifetime, nor did she want to pin all her hopes and the rest of her life on a man, an unrelíable creature.


However,she planned to be good to Malcolm while they were married.

Malcolm gave her a once-over. "You hurt anywhere?"

Reese shrugged it off. "How could he even hurt me?"


If they weren't at the company, she would've already turned Isaac into a meat patty.


Seeing her confident look,MMalcolm couldn't help but smile.

"Yeah, seems like it. Who could hurt you with those martial arts skills?"


A Taekwondo black belt-he'd better watch himself in the future to avoid getting his butt kicked if he ever made her mad. But... Reese didn't seem to know how many tricks he had up his sleeve. Once his leg healed,he'd have to show her.


Reese figured she'd been in there long enough. If the employees outside got the wrong idea, it would lead to gossip. She wasn't afraid of trouble, but it was best to avoid it if possible.

"I'll head out now."

"Okay." Malcolm let go of her hand.


As she reached the door, Reese seemed to remember something and turned back to him. "Tonight, I have a treatment and need to soak in some medicinal water. Don't work late."

Malcolm's eyes softened unusually. "Okay."


As soon as Reese stepped out, she ran into Justin. They nodded to each other and went about their business.


Justin pushed open the office door and went in.


"Mr.Flynn."


"Isthe issue with Isaac resolved?" The softness on Malcolm's face instantly turned to indifference, as if Justin had just imagined it. But it was Reese's private matter, and he didn't wantto pry.


"Yeah. The person above him is trying hard to protect him."

Justin was talking about the guy who had brought Isaac into the company, someone from another department. Malcolm hadn't dealt with it because recently, this guy had landed a big contract for the company. Plus, he was a veteran employee, and it wouldn't be good to hurt the old-timers' feelings over this.


What made it even trickier was that this guy was a relative of Malcolm's grandfather, making it even harder to handle. Since the position wasn't particularly high, Malcolm had let it slide.


But today, he wasn't planning to let it go because Isaac had messed with his wife.His wife had been bullied right under his nose-no way he was letting that slide.


Malcolm's long fingers tapped lightly on the desk, his profile especially cold and hard, like it was covered in frost.


"Deduct Isaac's salary for this month and announce his actions to the entire company."

"But... Mr. Flynn, isn't that a bit harsh?" Justin hadn't expected Malcolm to change his mind. Normally,he wouldn't personally handle such minor issues; it was usually left to the subordinates. Could it be because of Reese...


He didn't get what Malcolm saw in Reese. She wasn't particularly good-looking. Today, she was dressed nicely. but that face was still hard to look at.


Malcolm shot him a cold glance, his attitude domineering.

"Can anyone in the Flynn family be bullied so easily?"

This statement scared Justin into quickly lowering his head.

"I... I'll get right on it."
###Chapter 24 You Gonna Betray Me Later?


Reese plopped back into her seat, and suddenly, the vibe around her shifted. Folks weren't giving her the stink eye anymore, probably 'cause they saw her lay Isaac out in the cafeteria.


Who would've thought a tiny thing like her could floor a strong man like that? Wild.


People were still gossiping, though, and some even slapped a nickname on her.

The Hulk.


Seriously? That name sucked.


Reese chuckled, shaking her head, just as her phone buzzed on the table. It was Calvin.


"Yo,what's up?"


"Reese, there's an auction tonight with that bracelet you love. Wanna go?"


Her eyes lit up at the mention of the bracelet.


"Is this for real?"


She wasn't up for another letdown. Last time, they hyped her up for nothing, and it turned out to be a fake.
Total bummer.	®


Calvin sounded sure. "This time it's legit, but it's gonna cost a pretty penny."


"As long as it's the real deal, when have I ever cared about the price?"


"So, should I swing by to pick you up, or you coming on your own?" Calvin knew her current situation was a bit tricky. Being married now, she had to keep up appearances sometímes.

Not that Reese ever really cared about that.


"You pick me up. I'T text you the address later."

Calvin had hooked her up with a car before, but now that she was part of the Flynn family, rolling ap in a luxury ride might not be the best look.


Calvin was all in. "Oh man, I get to see Reese. I'm stoked."

Reese rolled her eyes.

"Alright, gotta bounce.Later."


She tucked her phone away, chuckling at the thought of Calvin's goofy grin.


The stack of documents Everly handed her were total breeze. Reese was a financial whiz, and organizing data was child's play.


Plus,she had a photographic memory. She could glance at data once and it was locked in, no need for double-checking, which made her super efficient.


By five o'clock, while everyone else was still grinding, she was already packing up to bounce.

As she walked past Susan's desk, Susan stood up and called out.


"Where do you think you're going?"


"Heading out. Workday's over, right?" She'd read the employee handbook; quitting time was at five. Besides,she was done with her tasks. Susan smirked.


"You're new here. Instead of sticking around to get the hang of things, you wanna leave early? Look around.your colleagues are still hustling."


Reese glanced around. Sure, people were still working, but so what?

"I finished mny work. I'm leaving on time, not early."

Susan didn't expect Reese to have knocked out all the tasks she piled on her. That was enough work for two people.Reese didn't have the background or the experience, so how did she do it so fast?


With a raised eyebrow, Susan looked intrigued.

"Alright, show me."


Reese wasn't dumb; she knew she had to set things straight.

"If I show you and everything checks out, can I leave?"

Susan couldn't believe Reese had plowed through that mountain of work so quickly. Even if she worked non-stop, it would take her until at least 8:30 to finish. She was itching to see how much Reese was bluffing.


"Alright, if you hand it over for inspection and there are no issues, you can go,"

Reese dropped a hefty stack of documents in front of her. "Go ahead, check it out. But I've got plans after work, so you might want to get someone to help you. It'll speed things up."


Susan shot her a disdainful look.

"Wow, not only can you throw a punch, but you're also full of yourself."
Reese stayed quiet. Whether she was full of it or not, Susan would find out soon enough. Calvin might fust have to wait a bit longer at the door.


Susan turned to a nearby colleague. "You take half and check with me. Be thorough and Hag any issues, no matter how small."


"Got it.Susan."


Reese stood there, casually scrolling through her phone, looking completely unbothered. Susan kept glancing at her, but Reese didn't care one bit.


Could she really have finished? No way.


After hal an hour, the two of them were done checking. Susan's neck was sore from all the scrutinizing, and she couldn't find a single mistake. She pinned her hopes on her colleague.


"Did you find any issues?"

"Nope, everything's filled out perfectly."

Susan's face darkened. Damn, she couldn't catch this girl's mistake.


Reese crossed her arms and asked nonchalantly, "So, Susan, can I leave now?"

What could Susan say? She had promised that if there were no issues, Reese could leave immediately. Even though she was fuming, she had no choice.


Susan waved her hand dismissively."Goon,get out of here."


"Later!" Reese swung her work badge and strutted out of the office.


The other colleagues groaned. "Even the newbie's oufla here. and we're stuack working overtime."


Still fuming. Susan snapped at the complainer. "If you don't want to work overtime, go tell Me. Flyan."

The office fell silent. the only sound being the clacking of keyboards.


Reese left the building and hopped into Calvin's car, a flashy red Ferrari, Calvin had tricked it out, making it a real head-turner on the road.


Calvin was about to greet her when he saw her dark skin, heavy bangs, and freckles. He was so shocked he almost swore,


"Who... who the heck are you?"


Reese smacked him on the forehead.


"You seriously don't recognize me?"


Calvin squinted, taking a closer look,still skeptical.


"Is that really you, Reese? What happened to you?"


Where had Reese's stunning beauty gone? The woman in front of him looked like a total country bumpkin.


Reese glanced at the time, eager to get to the auction for her jade bracelet.

"Just drive, dude. It's not like you're marrying me."


She still needed to buy an outfit, which would take some time. Her looking now would embarrass her in front of someone she knew. After all, in Atlanta, there was no one knew her identity yet.


Hearing her familiar tone, Calvin was now certain it was indeed Reese. They headed to a makeup artist, changed her clothes, and gave her a complete makeover. The makeup artist was a world-class professional, specially hired by Calvin for Reese.
###Chapter 25 Is Reese Gonna Turn Over a New Leaf?

When they rolled up to the auction, Reese practically jumped out of the car, dragging Calvin along. The security men were so gobsmacked by her that they totally forgot to ask for her invite.


Whoa, they'd never seen a drop-dead gorgeous woman before. She was like an angel straight outta heaven.


Just her figure, her flawless skin, and those perfect features had the guards, who've seen their fair share of high society,completely floored. That kind of beauty and grace combo? Super rare.


Calvin stood next to Reese, chuckling to himself about the guards' dumbstruck faces.


Any guy would be knocked out by Reese's looks. That was her outer charm. But her personality? Sometimes she was as sweet as honey, but one sharp look from her and people scattered.


She snagged a seat in the second row, off to the side, not wanting to be the center of attention. She was here to snag a bracelet and then bounce, no plans to stick around.


Calvin leaned in and whispered, "Reese, after this, come chill at the club with us. Everyone's been missing you,it's been ages."


"Nah, I gotta get home and take care of my husband's leg. The sooner he's up and about, the sooner I can grill him about Grandma."


She was sure Malcolm owed her big time and would spill the beans.


Calvin could barely wrap his head around it-Reese, their wild and carefree buddy, seemed to be changing her ways for some guy. She used to hit the club with them almost every other night. Now that she's hitched it's like she's lost her taste for it..

This was so not Reese. "Reese, come on. Aren't you getting a bit too wrapped up in this guy? You're only married todig into Grandma's death. Don't get all emotional, or you'll never get out clean. We've got bigger plans, remember?"


He was seriously worried Reese might catch feelings for Malcolm and lose sight of their big dreams. They'd sworn to become the richest folks on the planet.


Reese couldn't stand people yapping in her ear, and Calvin was the worst of them all.

"Enough already. Keep it up, and you can wait outside. You're getting on my last nerve."


Calvin awkwardly pulled back. "Alright, I'll zip it. But Reese, I'm just lookingout for you. Don't let your hubby's good looks mess with your head."


"Did I ask for your two cents?" Reese smacked him on the head with her clutch.


Calvin finally shut his trap.


The auction kicked off with some snooze-fest items like utensils and teacups, none of which caught Reese's eye. She was so bored she almost nodded off in her seat.


Finally, the bracelet she had her eye on came up, but by then, she was already dozing on Calvin's shoulder.

Calvin kept nudging her, "Reese, your bracelet's up,"


Reese finally opened her eyes and saw the person on stage holding the bracelet. It was exquisite, elegant,unique, and luxurious-a rare gem. She'd liked it from the pictures Calvin showed her, but seeing it in person was a whole different ball game.


She made up her mind right then and there. "No matter what, I'm getting that bracelet today."

"Got it,Reese." The starting bid was $5 million. This bracelet was no joke, and everyone in the know understood its worth.

"$6 million."

"$6.5 million."

"$7 million."


The bids kept climbing, bit by bit.

Reese sat back, cool as a cucumber. She wasn't into the whole back-and-forth haggling scene. She preferred to wait until the final price was called, then swoop in and snag it.


The price kept climbing and finally hit $8 million, with no one daring to go higher.

The auctioneer called out, "$8 million once, $8 million twice, $8 million th-"

"$9 million," Calvin shouted, raising the paddle.

The crowd went nuts.


This price was way over the bracelet's market value. These rich folks really didn't care about money.


Even the auctioneer was floored. $8 million was already a lot, and now it had jumped to $9 million.

"Alright, this gentleman has bid $9 million. Is there anyone else? $9 million once, $9 million twice, $9 million th-"


"$10 million!"


Suddenly,a familiar voice rang out. The crowd couldn't hold back their reactionS.

"How did it get to $10 million? My God."

"Isn't this bracelet being bid on by a woman? Why is a man so eager to get it?"

"You don't get it. He must be buying it for his girlfriend. Some guys are just that generous for their girlfriends."


"His girlfriend must be one lucky lady."

Calvin was fuming that someone dared to compete with Reese for the bracelet.

"What kind of guy bids on a woman's item? He must be doing it just to mess with us. No way we let someone else take what Reese wants. Reese, should we up the bid?"


Reese was already stunned, her face a bit pale.

Calvin nudged her, "Reese, what's up? Shocked by the $10 million bid?"


Reese still didn't speak. Calvin thought she was upset and started rolling up his sleeves, ready to stand up.

"Let me go have a word with that guy, How dare he compete for something Reese wants!"

"Calvin, he's my husband."
 

Calvin was floored, turning to look at Reese in astonishment. "Reese, your... your husband? Why is he bidding on a bracelet? Could it be that he has... another woman?"
###Chapter 26 The Woman Who Bolted


Things got a bit rowdy when Calvin stood up, catching Justin's eye.

"Mr. Flynn. that chick over there kinda looks like Mrs. Flynn."


Malcolm followed Justin's gaze and spotted a woman nearby. She was rocking a light blue dress, and her skin had this soft. glowing vibe under the lights. The way the light hit her, it showed off her curves and made her look even more stunning.


Just from her back, she had this unique aura, totally different from the usual high-society types.


But no way that could be his wife, right? Reese had darker skin and always wore those thick black-framed glasses.Comparing the two was like night and day.


Justin squinted, still unsure. "Yeah, the back kinda matches, but the face has to be way different."

Malcolm shot him a cold look, and Justin immediately shut up.

Since when did Malcolm start defending his wife? She was just the stand-in bride, not someone he'd actually keep around forever. Was Malcolm seriously thinking of keeping Reese as his wife for good?


Bringing her out would just mess with Malcolm's rep.


Malcolm decided to get to thê bottom of it. He told Justin, "Grab that bracelet. I'm gonna check this out."


"Got it." Justin thought it was about time Malcolm ditched this idea anyway.


Reese was still debating whether to bid on the bracelet when Calvin kept poking her.

"Reese, your hubby's heading this way. What now?" Reese's eyes went wide. "He's coming?"

Did he spot her?

Calvin watched as Malcolm wheeled himself closer.


"What the hell are you standing there for? Move it!"


Reese suddenly bolted towards the exit, her heels cacking against the floor. Calvin, caught off guard by her sudden flight, scrambled to keep up.


Malcolm spotted the woman hiking up her skirt and stumbling out in her high heels. Just as he was about to follow, the host's excited voice boomed from the stage.


"Ten million dollars, claimed by this gentleman! Congrats! Let's give a big hand and invite him up for a speech."


Justin stepped in and told the host, "Well, Mr. Flynn isn't exactly mobile."


The host glanced at the man in the wheelchair. Despite his legs, his chiseled face and stern demeanor screamed authority. His outfit alone marked him as someone important.


Mr. Flynn? Could it be Malcolm from the Flynn family, the legend himself?


Holy crap, Malcolm Flynn was actually here.
。

But with the assistant's words, the host knew better than to push. Big shots like this weren't to be messed with.


The host's tone shifted to one of deference.


"Alright, I'll have someone escort Mr. Flynn out." "No need."


Malcolm called up to Justin. "Let's head back,"


He needed to find out if the woman who bolted was really his wife.


Reese and Calvin finally made it to the car, both letting out a sigh of relief. Calvin was still scratching his head.


"Reese,why are you so scared of him? If he's bidding on a bracelet, he's probably got a side chick. Perfect chance to call him out."


"Are you dense? If I run into him, he'll start questioning my real identity. He might even think I have some hidden agenda for getting into the Flynn family. You're just making things worse for me."


Calvin finally got it. "You're right, Reese. My bad."


"Take me back to the makeup place first. I need to fill you in on some stuff you need to handle ASAP." She needed to switch back to her usual look.


When they got back to the Flynn Villa, Malcolm was already chilling in the living room. Reese thought,he must be suspicious, otherwise, why would he be here at this hour?


She walked up and asked, "Why aren't you resting in your room?"

 Malcolm looked up, his sharp eyes scanning her from head to toe, his face all serious and chiseled.

"Where'd you go after work?"


"I went to get some meds for you. And I saw this barbecue stand on the way. You know, this barbecue is amazing and you can only get it on that street." As she talked. Reese opened a bag and took a whiff, then held it out to Malcolm.


“Want one?"


Malcolm eyed her outfit, which was the same as what she wore to work today. Her skin was still dark, and her thick bangs covered her forehead. No matter how he looked, she didn't match the woman from the auction.


Sure, they had similar builds-both tall and slender-but that woman's skin was smooth and flawless, totally different from Reese's.


Did he mistake the auction woman for her, or was she just that good at acting?


"Did you go to an auction today?" Malcolm's deep eyes locked onto hers, trying to catch any hint of a lie.

"Auction? You mean where all the rich folks hang out?" She blinked her big, curious eyes at him.


Malcolm couldn't find any cracks in her story. She looked genuinely curious, like she'd never been to such a place.


"Do you really not know, or are you just playing dumb?"

Reese tilted her head, looking all innocent. "WNhat are you talking about?"


"Justin and I saw someone at the auction today who looked exactly like you."


Reese pointed to herself in mock surprise. "As ugly as me?"

Malcolm felt a twinge of awkwardness. How was he supposed to answer that? Honestly, she wasn't ugly, just had a kind of plain, unpolished look. With a bit of grooming, she could actually look decent.


He cleared his throat. "Actually, you're not that ugly. Stop saying that about yourself." Reese needed a confidence boost.


"But I am índeed ugly. Look at my dark skin and freckles. If it weren't for the folks at the clothing store helping me out, I'd probably get laughed at the moment I walked into the company."


Reese expressed her self-disdain, even pouting for effect, looking like she couldn't stand herself.

Malcolm was at a loss for words, feeling frustrated as he rubbed his temples


"Go do your thing. I have a meeting in the study."


"Okay, I'll go watch TV and eat something in my room. Call me when you're done, and I'll get the medicine for you."


Reese finished speaking and happily went back to her room, closing the door behind her.


Malcolm watched her retreating figure with a thoughtful look. Was the woman at the auction really not her?


He headed into the study, and Justin brought in the meeting documents.

"Did you check?"


"Yes, Mr. Flynn. After work, Mrs. Flynn went to a food street to queue for kebabs and had two cups of coffee at a nearby café."


Malcolm frowned. "Did we really get it wrong?"
###Chapter 27 Reese Lays Down the Law


When Justin frst caught a glimpse of that figure from behind, he was dead sure if was Reese. But then, after mulling it over, he realized that aside from their similar backs, these two were like night and day.


"Maybe we totally messed up. If Mrs. Flynn was rolling in dough. why would she shack up with the Flynn family?"


By this point, his meeting was about to kick off, so Malcolm shoved those thoughts aside.

"Alright. let's get this meeting started."


Reese,who was eavesdropping by the door, heard them drop the topic and snuck back to her room with a sly grin. Good thing she had Calvin set everything up beforehand.


Otherwise, if Malcolm really dug into her past, he'd uncover everything. It sucked she didn't snag that fancy bracelet today, but who was Malcolm buying it for anyway?


Could he actually be seeing someone else on the side?


If he was planning to give it to another chick, she'd rather have it herself. He could change a gift for that woman, but she couldn't just bring up the bracelet to Malcolm.


She was stuck and had to let it go, eventhough it bugged her.
。
After munching on some BBQ and zoning out in front of the TV for a bit, Malcolm barged in. Reese quickly cleaned up the table and got to her feet.


"You're done with work. I'll go get things ready."


"Yeah." Malcolm's tone was flat. Reese figured he was just beat and went to prep the herbs and needles for his bath and acupuncture.


When Malcolm finished his bath, he coughed lightly as he walked back into the room. "Considering how you've been all over taking care of me lately. I should show some gratitude."


"What kind of gratitude?" Reese asked nervously, hoping he wasn't hinting at something steamy.


Seeing her freaked-out look, Malcolm flicked her forehead.


"What are you thinking? I'm talking about a gift for you."


Reese instinctively touched her forehead,looking at Malcolm all puzzled.


"What's this about?"


Malcolm pulled out a delicate box from under the pillow and handed it to her.


"Open it."


Reese opened it, curiosity piqued, and was immediately floored, covering her mouth in shock.


No way... wasn't this the exquisite bracelet she was drooling over at the auction today?


She stared at Malcolm, wide-eyed. "You're really giving this to me?"
 
Such a pricey piece, and Malcolm was just handing it over?


"Who else would I give a woman's bracelet to?" His words had a deeper meaning.


Reese was at a loss for words. It felt like she'd been yanked from hell straight to heaven. Her eyes sparkled with excitement, and her smile stretched wider. She wasted no time slipping the bracelet onto her wrist. Under the light. it looked even more stunning.sparkling brilliantly.


Reese was in love with it.


Seeing her over the moon, Malcolm knew he'd nailed it with thisgift.


"Looks like you really dig it, huh?"


Reese couldn't stop grinning. "Of course I love it. This is..."

She paused, almost giving herself away.


Noticing her shift in expression, Malcolm raised an eyebrow.

"This is what?"


Reese threw her head back and laughed heartily. "This is from my dearest husband."


To show her appreciation, she even wrapped her arms around Malcolm's neck and planted a kiss on his handsome face.


Malcolm was momentarily taken aback, then a barely-there smile tugged at the corner of his lips.


This gift was well deserved.
 
The next morning, Reese was the first one downstairs for breakfast. She'd been tipped off about a regular meeting that morning and was specifically reminded not to be late, so she got up early.


While munching on her breakfast, Alyssa's sharp eyes zeroed in on the bracelet on Reese's wrist, and her eyes nearly popped out. "Waft a minute... isn't that the bracelet that went for ten million dollars at the auction yesterday? How the heck is it on your wrist?"


Reese thought to herself, she didn't expect Alyssa to recognize the value of the bracelet.


She admitted calmly. "Yep, my husband gave it to me."


Alyssa's face twisted in shock.′′IsMalcolm out of his mind? Giving you such an expensive bracelet."


Reese found it amusing and looked at her confidently."Why is it crazy for my husband to give me something? Isn't that perfectly normal?"


Alyssa shot Reese a disdainful look. "It's not a problem for Malcolm to give his wife something, but it depends on the person. Someone like you, wearing cheap clothes, flaunting such an expensive bracelet is a joke. Even if people see it, they'll think it's fake and it'll just devalue the bracelet."


"Look at yourself, do you even deserve to wear something so pricey?"


Reese didn't feel inferior at all. The fact that she liked the million-dollar bracelet was a blessing for the bracelet, wasn't it? But Alyssa's mouth was getting nastier.


She calmly glanced at her watch. "Hmm, I still have some time. Let me teach you some manners."


Alyssa didn't expect Reese to not only be unashamed but also brazenly claim she would teach her manners.


She scoffed disdainfully. "W/ho do you think you are to teach me manners!"


Reese stood up, slowly rolled up her sleeves, and walkedtowards Alyssa. Alyssa, for some reason, felt a bit scared seeing Reese's demeanor and watched her warily.


"Reese, what are you going to do?" Reese walked up to her, towering over Alyssa. her height and presence overwhelming her.

She picked up a cup and said naturally. "Teach you some manners."


With that, she pinched Alyssa's lips with two fingers, forcing her mouth open. Before Alyssa could react Reese poured the water from the cup into her mouth.


Alyssa struggled frantically. The more she fought, the more fiercely the water poured, making her cough violently.


When the cup was finally empty, Reese let go and stepped aside to avoid getting splashed.

Alyssa clutched her chest, her face red with embarrassment, glaring daggers at Reese.

"Are you out of your mind? How dare you do this to me!"


Alyssa kept patting her chest, coughing uncontrollably, almost feeling like she was going to pass out.


Reese placed the cup back on the table, her eyes cold and intimidating.

"Tm not crazy. It's you not respecting me. After all, I am Malcolm's legal wife. You have no right to be disrespectful to me. Whether I come from the countrysde or deserve this million-dollar bracelet is not for you to judge. If you think I'm not worthy of Malcolm, go tell Grandpa."


But even if she wanted to leave now, Aiden wouldn't let her go. Malcolm's recovery relied on her. Would they really miss such a good opportunity?


Alyssa was speechless. She had underestimated Reese. Reese knew she wouldn't dare to cause a scene with Grandpa,let alone Malcolm.


Malcolm was willing to give her a million-dollar bracelet. If she acted rashly, who knew who would suffer more? But she couldn't swallow her anger!


If she couldn't complain, could she not even win in a verbal attack?


Alyssa raised her head arrogantly."Doyou really think you're significant? Just because you married into the Flynn family, you think you can act all high and mighty? Officially, you may be Malcolm's wife, but no one in the Flynn family acknowledges your status. Don't think too highly of yourself. Be careful not to fall from a great height."


Reese didn't respond. She just slowly reached for the milk cup on the table. As soon as she picked it up.Alyssa stood up from her chair, looking at her nervously.


"What are you going to do now?"
###Chapter 28 No Wonder She's My Wife
Reese leaned in close, her lips almost brushing Alyssa's. "Having breakfast, what else?" she asked, all casual-like.


Alyssa,nerves jangling, thought Reese was about to force-feed her again. Reese was strong, and AIyssa knew she couldn't break free if it came to that. Feeling awkward, she plopped back down in her seat.


Reese found Alyssa's scaredy-cat look kinda funny.After downing her milk, she tossed a casuial comment Alyssa's way. "Look, it's a fact that I married Malcolm.You can't change that. If we argue, you'll lose. If we fight,you'll lose even harder. So, might as well chill out."


With that, Reese grabbed her bag and strutted out, giving Alyssa a little wave goodbye. Alyssa watched her leave, fuming, cheeks puffed up like a chipmunk.She slammed the table-Reese was just too damn arrogant!


But what could she do? She couldn't handle Reese on her own. So, she called Vincent, turning on the waterworks and whining.


"Vincent, you gotta come back quick.The woman Malcolm married is destroying our home."


Vincent was still abroad, caught up in some medical research. He rarely came back to The Flynn Villa because he hated the vibe there, especially seeing Malcolm-it just dredged up bad memories.He'd heard their grandpa had set Malcolm up with a fiancée, supposedly to fulfill some old marriage agreement. "What happened, Alyssa? Who's messing with you?"


"It's that Reese chick. She's hanging arouand,claiming she can fix Malcolm's leg. I want her out. Vincent, you gotta help me."


Vincent was taken aback by that. His voice got all tense. "She said she can cure Malcolm's Ieg?"


"Yeah, Malcolm says he can already feel something in his leg." Alyssa didn't think much of it; she just wanted Vincent to come back and boot Reese out so she could have another ally.


Vincent snapped out of it. "Alright, I'll come back in a couple of days to check it out. Don't start any fights,though. Remember, she's Malcolm's wife."


"Vincent... don't say that. I can't stand her." Alyssa pouted, looking all displeased. Vincent hung up, his calm demeanor shattered, his voice turning icy cold. "Book a flight for the day after tomorrow."


His assistant, Alex Evans, who was not only a doctor at the medical school but also a VP at the subsidiary company, stepped forward. "Mr. Flynn, there's a surgery scheduled at the hospital the day after tomorrow. Are you sure you want to go back then?"


Vincent's sinisterly handsome face filled Alex's view,his dark eyes flashing with a chilling coldness."If I don't go back soon, everything I've worked so hard for might be gone."


"Understood."


Malcolm got the news pretty quick. Justin said,"Mr.Malcolm Flynn, Mr. Vincent Flynn is coming back the day after tomorrow. He's already booked the flight." Malcolm sat in his chair, rocking that suit and tie combo. The black suit just made him look even colder and more unapproachable, but damn, his chiseled.handsome face had people swooning. Just sitting there.he had this king-like presence. His lips curled into a cold, charming smile. "He couldn't hold back after all."


As long as Malcolm stayed paralyzed,Vincent wouldn't be in a rush. But the moment he heard Malcolm might recover, he'd start freaking out and come running back. What a good brother,huh?


Justin bowed his head slightly. "What should we do now?"


A dark glint fashed in Malcolm's eyes. "He doesn't want me to get better, but I won't let him stop me."


Justin looked a bit worried. "But if that's the case, Mr.Vincent Flynn might target Mrs. Reese Flynn." After all, Reese was the key player now.Whether Malcolm's leg could be cured depended entirely on her.


Hearing this,Malcolm's eyes suddenly sharpened, and his aura became so intense that the temperature in the office seemed to drop. His voice carried a deadly
hostility. "If he dares to harm my wife, he won't live in peace."


Justin was dumbfounded. The once aloof Malcolm had turned into a wife-protecting maniac. Anyone who dared to mess with his little wife would be obliterated in an instant. No doubt about it.


He couldn't quite get what was so special about Reese that she had Malcolm wrapped around her finger.
Then he remembered a funny story he heard from the servants this morning and thought it was worth sharing with Malcolm. "Mr. Flynn, this morning I heard from the servants that during breakfast, Mrs. Reese Flynn and Miss Alyssa Flynn had a serious argument. Mrs. Reese Flynn ended up forcefully pouring water into Miss Alyssa Flynn's mouth."


Malcolm stayed silent, like he was frozen. Justin thought for sure he'd be pissed, given that Alyssa was also someone he doted on-the little princess of the house, whom no one dared to mess with. But then,Malcolm's smile grew wider, like he was actually pleased.


"No wonder she's my wife."


Justin was stunned by his reaction.


Around noon, Calvin came to see Reese and brought some bad news. The company had been hacked by another company's hackers, and their team couldn't handle it. If the information got stolen, they'd suffer heavy losses.


Hearing this, Reese packed her things and was about to leave when she ran into Everly, who had just learned from Alyssa that Malcolm had bought Reese a priceless bracelet. She was so mad she almost tore the office apart. But realizing she was still at the company and that throwing a tantrum would lead to gossip among her colleagues, she held back. But even fate would help her by letting her run into Reese. No way she was letting her go.


Everly put on a serious face, exuding the authority of a director."It's work hours, where do you think you're going?"


"I'm going out for a bit. You can dock my pay."


Reese said this in a hurry, trying to bypass Everly. But Everly wasn't having it and shouted sternly, "Reese,stop right there!"
###Chapter 29 Snatching the Flynn Group Project


Reese stopped dead in her tracks, clearly annoyed. "Look, I've got something super urgent. Can I fill you in when I get back?"



"Nope. Don't care what it is. It's work hours, and you're not going anywhere. Get back to your desk."



Everly's voice was loud enough to catch the attention of everyone around.



People started whispering, eager to see what would happen next.



"What's the deal? Is Reese seriously defying Miss Flynn? Does she have a death wish?"



"Yeah, Miss Flynn is Mr. Flynn's sister. Even if Reese got in through some connections, she can't compete with Miss Flynn."



"But Reese has guts. Remember Isaac last time? She was the only one who stood up to him and actually won." "That was just luck. If she wwas really that good, she wouldn't be just another employee here."



"Stop changing the subject. Let's bet on whether Reese can walk out of that door today."



Someone in the crowd got excited.



"I'm in! But I'm betting she won't make it. Miss Flynn is a hard-ass."



"Yeah, I'm betting on Miss Flynn too. Reese is just an egg trying to break a stone unless she wants to get fired."



Almost everyone was betting on Everly, After all, she outranked Reese,and no one thought a subordinate could win this.



Reese heard every word and couldn't help but smirk to herself.They really underestimated her.



She didn't want to waste any more time with Everly and cut straight to the chase.
"I'll take any punishment the company throws at me. Hell, f can also give up the paycheck this month. But I've got something urgent right now."



Everly narrowed her eyes."You might not care about your paycheck, but the company has rules. I said you can't leave today, so you can't leave!"



Her tone was ironclad, and the tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife.



Reese raised an eyebrow. "So, no room for negotiation?"



"Exactly!" Everly was dead set on keeping Reese here. If Reese tried to leave, Everly would have all the ammo she needed to report her to Malcolm. Breaking company rules would put Reese in hot water, and even if Malcolm wanted to protect her, he'd have to deal with the office gossip.



Reese couldn't care less about that. She was here for the project. If she got it,she was out. If not, no big deal.



Everly was clearly out to make her life difficult. No point in wasting more breath. Her patience snapped, and she waved dismissively.



"Do whatever you want."



With that, she didn't even glance at Everly and bolted out of the office.



Everly was pleased that Reese was in trouble, but she was still fuming that Reese didn't respect her authority.


She sneered, "A country bumpkin-will always be a country bumpkin. How.can someone like that be fit to work here? It's a disgrace to the company:"



The crowd was still reeling from the shock when someone finally broke the silence.



"Oh my God, did you see that? Reese just bolted right under Miss Flynn's nose!"



"Yeah, I saw it. No need to rub it in,"



"Man, she's got some serious guts. Looks like we all lost the bet." "Nobody bet on Reese winning, so let's just call it even."



"What a bummer. But Reese has surprised us twice now. Maybe I need to rethink my opinion of her."



Everly shot them a cold glare and snapped,′′Is the company giving you too little work? Is that why you have time to gossip?"



The group immediately ducked their heads and got back to their tasks,fear evident in their eyes.



Everly didn't head back to her office. Instead, she marched straight into Malcolm's office.



Meanwhile, Reese dashed out of the building and headed to the coffee shop across the street. Calvin, drenched in sweat, looked up and saw her like she was his saving grace.



"Finally,you're here. If you didn't show up, we'd be toast."



Reese sat down, grabbed the laptop, and said confidently,"We won't be." Calvin chuckled,"ofcourse not." After all. Reese was the top hacker.



Reese's fingers flew across the keyboard, her eyes laser-focused, a stark contrast to her usual laid-back demeanor. She could switch between life and work modes like flipping a switch.



Even though it wasn't the first time Calvin had seen Reese's incredible skills, he was always blown away. Her typing speed and reaction time were off the charts.



Reese had expected a tough opponent, but she handled it in no time.



She clapped her hands together."Done. And I snagged an order from their system as a little payback."



Calvin was in total awe. "Reese, you're a genius. We bow down to you."



"Alright, cut the crap. Just make sure to handle the order properly so they can't trace it back to us."
"Got it." Calvin took the laptop and checked the project source. His smile quickly faded. "Reese. I think we might have a problem."



Reese frowned. "What do you mean?"



Didn't they just snag an order? They should be celebrating.



Calvin looked worried. "The order we took is from your husband's company."



Reese was stunned."What!"



So, the project they hijacked was Malcolm's, meaning the system they hacked into belonged to the Flynn Group?



Calvin, seeing Reese's disbelief, moved the laptop closer to her."See for yourself."



Sure enough, the screen displayed "Flynn Group." What were the odds? In such a big world how did they end up messing with Malcolm's company?



Seeing Reese's embarrassed expression, Calvin couldn't resist teasing."Reese, are you scared of your husband?"



To Calvin and the others, Reese was always fearless. She couldn't lose her cool now.



She straightened up and said, "Are you kidding? Why would I be afraid of him? When it comes to profit, nothing else matters."



Calvin applauded. "Well said! Reese,we can abandon anything but money."



Despite her bravado, Reese couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that had settled in her heart since finding out the other party was Malcolm's company. It was hard to put into words.
###Chapter 30 Almost Busted


Over at Malcolm's end, the tech team was freaking out,faces white as sheets. He couldn't wrap his head around how their smooth operation got wrecked so easily.


Malcolm was sitting next to Carl Ward, and the office vibe was colderthan a polar bear's toenails. His eyes were a storm of mixed feelings.



Carl looked at Malcolm, guilt written all over his face, his voice shaky.



"Mr. Flynn, we... we blew it."


"Didn't you just say everything was going smooth?"


Carl had also mentioned he'd dug up some dirt on this company. Said it was a pretty impressive outfit, only hitting the big leagues two years ago. Before that, it was just some no- name studio. Then a woman took over it, flipped the whole thing around, and in a short time, they were on top.


Now, they were right on their company's tail, and Malcolm was just starting to realize how fast they'd climbed. He wanted to dig deeper, especially since last month, they snatched one of their projects. To Malcolm, that was a slap in the face.


Càrl's voice was trembling. "Yeah... it was smooth at first. But then, I don't know if they swapped out their team or what,but I couldn't get in anymore. Instead, they hacked us and even stole oneof our projects."



He could barely imagine how pissed Malcolm looked right then. Malcolm squinted, a dangerous glint in his eyes.


"Carl, we didn't hire you to make things easier for the competition or to make us look like fools!"


Carl was brought on board with a fat paycheck because he was supposed to be a top-tier hacker. And now, he got outplayed so easily?


Talk about embarrassing!


Carl, scared out of his wits by Malcolm's outburst,scrambled for a solution and blurted out, "But... but even though they hacked us, I can still trace their location."


'Malcolm's eyes lit up. "Well,track it down."


He was dying to know who this hotshot was that even the Flynn Group's best couldn't handle.


In no time, Henry pinpointed it. He pointed across the sreet.

 
"That person is in the café right across from us." She was a pawn abandoned by herfamily,forced into a marriage with the rumored disabled and tyrannical CEO of a wealthy dynasty.



Everyone waited to see the tragic joke of this union,unaware that this marriage would mark the beginning of her shocking rise through high society.


Search for "Flash Marriage: The Wife Who Shook High Society" to witness how the independent heroine turns her life around!



Malcolm's eyes turned icy cold, and he barked at Justin.


"Get over to that café and check everyone out."



There weren't many folks sipping coffee at this hour,and if it was a hacker, they'd probably have a standout laptop. Plus,if they moved fast, they'd catch them off guard.Perfect timing. Justin nodded. "On it."


He quickly made his way to the café across the street.


Meanwhile,Reese had no clue Malcolm was onto her. She casually took a sip of the coffee Calvin hadn't finished.


"This coffee's pretty good."


"T'll have them pack a cup for you to take back," Calvin offered,reaching for the waiter.


"No need. If Everly sees me bringing back coffee, she'll just nag me more. She's worse than you guys."


Reese wasn't scared of Everly; she could shut her up with a few words. But she really couldn't stand anyone yapping in her ear. It drove her nuts.


Calvin sighed and let it go. Reese was a knockout, no doubt, but she was no delicate flower.


As he glanced down, he noticed the bracelet on her wrist, and it threw him for a loop.


"Reese, how'd you end up with that bracelet?"


Reese, clearly smitten with it, touched it again, a hint of pride Hashing in her eyes.


"My husband gave it to me."


"Your husband dropped ten million bucks on that just for you?" Calvin chuckled, thinking back to yesterday. "If we knew Malcolm was buying it for you, we wouldn't have bid. We jacked up the price from a few million to ten million,and your husband's cash ended up in someone else's pocket."


"Yeah, no kidding." Reese hadn't expected Malcolm to be so generous, splurging on such an expensive bracelet for her. "Alright, but I wonder if your husband would be mad enough to crush you if he knew he bought you that pricey bracelet and you stole a project from him."


Reese raised an eyebrow. "Depends."


Calvin gave Reese a thumbs up. "No wonder I'm sticking with you till the end. You're definitely. not like other women."


"Is that a compliment or an insult?"


Reese raised her hand, ready to punch Calvin. He grinned mischievously, taking her punch and even patting it appreciatively.


"Of course, it's a compliment. How could I dare insult you?"


"Well..."


She didn't even finish her sentence when she spotted a familiar
 face out of the corner of her eye. She instantly ducked down.


Calvin looked puzzled as Reese squatted.


"Reese, what are you doing?"


"Shush. That guy in the suit is Malcolm's assistant. He must've tracked us down."



Calvin suddenly remembered. "Oh crap, I forgot to disconnect the internet."



"Cover me. If he finds me, you better start looking for a new boss," Reese warned him.



Calvin was brimming with confidence. "Leave it to me. Acting?I'm an Oscar-worthy actor stuck in the wrong career."



If Reese weren't in such a tight spot, she would've kicked him.How did she end up with such a boastful subordinaté? Justin scanned the café and finally zeroed in on Calvin. His laptop was closed, but the power cord was stilI plugged in. It was a high-end model, the kind software pros use, and it looked specially modified.


No one would need that kind of laptop for regular work.


He walked over to Calvin.


Reese clutched Calvin's pant leg tightly,accidentally pinching his flesh, making Calvin wince in pain.


"Reese,you're killing me."


"Sorry,grabbed the wrong spot." Reese quickly let go.


Calvin's eyes widened. Grabbed the wrong spot? Where else did she want to grab?


Just then, Justin approached and politely addressed Calvin. "Sir, excuse me, I have a document that needs to be sent out urgently, but I didn't bring my laptop. Could I borrow yours?"


Reese, squatting under the table, thought to herself, Malcolm really trained him well. Even if he's here to test, he wouldn't say it outright. Such a polite and friendly request-if Calvin refused, it would only confirm that he's suspicious.


She wondered if that fool had closed all the relevant programs.If Justin found even a trace, it would be hard to explain.


Calvin, smiling cheerfully, moved the laptop aside.


"No problem, go ahead. I was just playing a game, so it might be a bit slow."


"Thanks, buddy. You wanna coffee?" Justin's politeness was impeccable. If he wanted to ask Calvin anything later, Calvin would be more likely to answer. Calvin declined, "No need. I haven't even finished this cup.Just go ahead."
###Chapter 31 Someone's Getting Nosy


Justin plopped down while Reese slid to the side,trying to stay out of sight. Good thing the café had those tablecloths that could hide her. If Justin had spotted her earlier, he'd be all over Calvin, snooping around and eventually blowing her cover.


Justin cracked open his laptop and his fingers started dancing on the keyboard. Calvin didn't even bother looking, just chilling with his coffee like he didn't have a care in the world.


Justin shot a glance at Calvin, but the guy's face was a blank slate. The laptop had some game logins, but nothing juicy.Some programs were locked up tight, and Justin couldn't mess with them right there.


To keep things looking legit, Justin actually fired off an email.


Then he got up. "Thanks, man. If the boss had come down on me,I'd have been toast." "No sweat." Calvin waved it off.


"You're into software development,right? I saw some programs on your laptop that aren't out there."


Calvin didn't see that coming. Denying it would just make things sketchier.


'"Yeah, our company makes them. We dabble in game software too."



"Can I get your business card? Maybe we can team up sometime."



Justin handed over his card. Calvin had to give his in return,just to be polite. Luckily, it was from their new side gig, not the main company, so it wouldn't raise too many eyebrows.


Justin glanced at the card. Never heard of this company before.
 He flashed a polite smile. "Alright. I'm outta here. Take care and let's stay in touch."


"Sure thing, take care."


Once Justin was out of sight, Calvin finally let out a big sigh of relief and bent down to lift the tablecloth.


'"Reese, coast is clear. You can come out now."



Reese crawled out from under the table, her face all red and breathing hard.


"Man, that scared the crap outta me."


Calvin rarely saw Reese rattled, let alone hiding under a table.


"Reese, you used to be fearess. Now, just some assistant has you shaking in your boots. If the folks back home knew,they'd never let you live it down." Reese raised her hand, ready to smack him.


"If you breathe a word of this, you'll regret it!"


"You should go back." Calvin nudged.


Reese smirked but didn't actually hit him. Calvin had been with her the longest, and she could be herself around him,unlike with the others.



"Take care of the company and don't make any more messes for me."



She was different now. Malcolm was always sniffing around,suspicious of her true identity. He probably thought a small-town girl shouldn't be so skilled in medicine and martial arts,which only made him more curious.


People like them, who had climbed so high, were always suspicious and sharp as a tack. Even the tiniest slip-up could expose you. So, she had to be extra careful with everything.


Calvin walked Reese to the café's entrance and watched her head back to the company.


Justin returned to the office where Malcolm was sitting by the floor-to-ceiling window, staring outside with those deep.unreadable eyes.


"Did you find anything?"


"There's someone fishy, but we don't have any solid proof yet."


"Who?" Malcolm turned around,his voice cold but magnetic.


Justin handed over Calvin's business card. "Just a small startup in software development. I checked his computer, didn't find anything sketchy, but there were a couple of locked programs.Didn't wanna risk opening them." Malcolm took the card, which had Calvin's name and tifle as Vice President. The company's name sounded pretty low-key.


He handed the card back to Justin."Dig into this company. See if it's a front for something bigger."


"On it." Justin sat down and started digging up info on the company.Everything looked normal, nothing out of the ordinary.



Malcolm asked, "Who's listed as the legal rep?"


"Calvin himself."


Malcolm frowned, tapping his fingers on the desk, lost in thought.


"If it's really his company, why's he just a Vice President?"


Justin was stumped too. "Maybe he's some rich kid trying to get some real-world experience. He does have that vibe.not your average Joe."


"Where's Reese? Still not back?”


"Not yet, but when she does, she'll probably butt heads with Miss Everly Flynn again."



Justin had heard the office gossip about Reese giving Everly a piece of her mind that morning, leaving Everly fuming.



Reese was the only one in the company with the guts tostand up to Everly.



Everly was Malcolm's sister, not by blood, but Malcolm treated both his sisters like gold.


Still, it was typical for a country girl to be a bit rough around the edges and clueless to all the rules. Malcolm decided to stay out of it. "Let them sort it out:"


To him, it was just petty squabbling. If he took Everly's side.Reese would throw a fit. He couldn't afford to tick her off,
because she was treating his legs.


If he sided with Reese, Everly would be mad at him. Since they were all family, a little bickering was normal as long as it didn't get out of hand.


It was actually good to have someone to balance out the fiery tempers of those two girls, both spoiled by him and their grandfather.



When Reese got back, she was immediately called into Everly's office.She braced herself for the worst but wasn't too worried about getting her pay docked. Even if Everly took six months'worth,it wouldn't be a big deal.


But Everly just gave her a cold look. "Since it's your first offense, I'l let it slide. Docking your pay is pointless. If you run out of money, you'd just lean on Malcolm to bail you out."


Reese's eye twitched. 'Lean on Malcolm? No way, Icould take care of myseIf just fine.'


If Malcolm ever got on her nerves, she could take her money and find herself a hot new boyfriend.


But Reese didn't buy that Everly would let it go so easily.Everly had been so fired up earlier,ready to explode. How could she have cooled off so fast? It didn't add up.



Reese hated drama and cut to the chase. "What do you really want? Just spit it out."



Everly gave a sly smile. "Okay, fine, I need to give you some kind of punishment to show the others. There's a business meeting tonight. You handle it. Everything's been discussed,but the other party is pretty picky. Whether you can close the deal tonight is up to you."
###Chapter 32 Is the Project More Important Than My Wife?
Reese raised an eyebrow, her tone chill."That's ft?"


Everly smirked at her cocky attitude.


"Reese, don't think this is simple. Susan toId me you're quick with data, but this ain't your usual odd job. Screw this up,and getting fired will be the least of your worries."


Reese narrowed her eyes, but there wasn't a hint of fear. She calmly held out her hand.



"Hand over the contract."


Reese thought, 'It's just a project, right?'


Everly sneered, thinking, 'If the contract is so easy, why do I need to send her? But sending Reese wasn't just about the contract; it was about getting rid of her for good. No matter how smooth Reese was.if she botched this project or pissed off the partner,even Malcolm couldn't save her.


Everly didn't hesitate and handed the contract to Reese.


"Seven tonight, Tranquil Haven Hotel. Go talk to him."


"Got it." Reese took the contract and walked out.


Everly watched her leave, a smug grin on her face.'After tonight, let's see how cocky you are.'


Did she really think the contract was a walk in the park?


Reese didn't sweat the contract at all. She'd closed bilion-dollar deals before; this small project was nothing. As long as the other party was serious, it was a breeze. If they were just playing games, not even Malcolm could help. When she got to Tranquil Haven Hotel, she immediately spotted a guy in his forties with a few strands of hair.overweight, especially his belly, which jiggledf as he walked.


Her gut told het this wasn't gonma be easy. She walked up and greeted him politely. "Mr. Woods, I'm Reese from the Flynn Group. Our director sent me to sign the contract with you."


Mack Woods squinted his beady eyes and gave Reese a once-over, clearly unimpressed.



Reese could tell he wasn't thrilled with her appearance, but she didn't care. That was the plan-to avoid any unwanted attention.



But she underestimated just how sleazy this guy was.


Things started off smooth. Reese thought this was gonna be a breeze and kept it professional. Mack was a bit surprised,thinking she was just some clueless newbie at the begining.However, she knew her stuff. Suddenly, Mack got a little too interested and started getting.crecpy.



"Ms. Brooks, your job must be tough. Look at these hands.so delicate."



As he spoke, Mack tried to touch Reese's hand, but she dodged.



Considering the deal Everly handed her was crucíal for the company, she had to close it or face endless nagging.


Reese dodged without a word, but her eyes started to show a sharp edge



"If there's no problem, please sign the contract quickly."


But Mack didn't catch on to Reese's impatience, thinking she was just playing hard to get. "Ms. Brooks, what's the rush? I wasn't even gonna sign this project originally. But for you... Since I'm being so
accommodating, shouldn't you repay me a bit?"


As he spoke, Mack moved around the table and sat next to Reese,his hand reaching for her shoulder.


That crossed the line for Reese. Her eyes turned icy, and she twisted Mack's wrist, making him scream in the lobby.


Mack's face went pale, cold sweat dripping from his forehead in pain.


"You... let go of me, you bitch. It's your honor that I fancy you,and you dare to hurt me!"


From the moment Reese acted, her patience was gone.Her sharp eyes showed a killing intent that made Mack feel a twinge of fear.
How could an ordinary girl have such a look in her eyes?


She scoffed disdainfully. "Who'd want a greasy slob like you?Get a grip. If you dare touch me, you better be ready for the fallout!"



Even Malcolm hadn't laidI a hand on her, let alone this disgusting creep. Just looking at his greasy face was enough to make her sick.



The commotion drew a crowwd of onlookers.



Mack,known for his vanity, couldn't handle being restrained by a woman. He started cursing without any regard.


"You crazy woman, let go of me! If I tell Mr.Flynn,you'll be fired. Look at yourself, so ugly. If it weren't for your good figure, I'd be disgusted just seeing you."


Reese sneered, "Oh yeah? If you find me disgusting, maybe Mr. Woods doesn't need these eyes anymore."


She grabbed a dessert knife and fork from the table, flipping them with lightning speed and aiming them at Mack's eyes Mack froze in fear, and the crowd gasped.


Just as the knife and fork were about to pierce Mack's pupils,Reese stopped, holding the utensils inches from his face.


Even so, Mack was so scared his legs gave out, and he collapsed to the ground in a mess.



Reese scoffed contemptuously. "You don't even have te guts,yet you dare to harass women."


At that moment, Mack's assistant came down from upstairs after arranging the room and saw Mack on the ground,pale with fear. He quickly approached.


"Mr. Woods, what happened to you?" Seeing someone finally come to his side. Mack felt a bit safer.


There was still fear in his eyes as he pointed at Reese.


"That... that woman, call Mr. Flynn immediately!"



The assistant didn't know what had happened but had to follow Mack's orders.



Malcolm was still in a meeting when Justin rushed in.


"Mr. Flynn, Reese is in trouble."



Malcolm frowned, his sharp gaze sweeping over the curious shareholders, making them lower their heads immediately.


"So, about this project,you..."

 
He wheeled himself over, his narrow eyes slightly squinting.a dangerous aura flashing across his handsome face.


"Come with me."


Justin nodded, "Yes,sir."


At the door of the conference room, Malcolm asked,"What happened?"


"Reese went to discuss the contract, but she got into a fight with Mr. Woods and even hit him."



Malcolm's throat tightened, a deep darkness flashing in his narrow eyes.


"Who sent her? Isn't this Everly's doing?"


"It seems Reese went out during the day, which made Miss Flynn unhappy. When Reese came back, Miss Flynn sent her to deliver the documents and sign the contract." Malcolm was furious. "She knew Mack was a lecherous
scoundrel and still sent Reese."


Justin rarely saw Malcolm so angry. The air around him seemed to thin, and he couldn't help but shiver.


"So,Mr.Flynn, what should we do now?"


"Let's go there."


Justin glanced worriedly at the conference room."Mr.Flynn,but the meeting..."



"Dismiss the meeting. Is the project more important than my wife?"



Justin was shocked by his words.



What happened to Malcolm? Why was he teating Reese better and better? Was it because she was so different that he was getting used to her?


He didn't dare to disobey his boss's orders and went in to inform the shareholders.



The two of them headed to the hotel across the street. As soon as they entered the lobby, they heard Mack shouting at Reese.


You bitch, just wait. I'll make sure you can't stay here!"


Reese sneered disdainfully, not afraid of his threats,holding her head high.


"Then I'll wait and see who can't stay here first."


Mack squinted his eyes, his face bruised and swollen, looking particularly miserable, but his voice was louder than anyone else's.



"Stop pretending. There's no one backing you. No one has ever dared to talk to me like this. You'll definitely regret it."


"Mr. Woods, such big talk, huh? It's the first time l've seen it."


Suddenly, the atmosphere in the lobby dropped sharply,accompanied by the sound of footsteps.
###Chapter 33 Bankrupt Him


Reese spun around, her gut telling her something was up. Sure enough, there was Justin, wheeling Malcolm into the room.Malcolm had that kind of look that made people stop and stare-sharp features, a natural swagger, and eyes that could
cut through steel.


Mack felta shiver run down his spine. Malcolm wasn't the kind of guy you messed with, and Mack had already screwed up a few times before. Was Malcolm really here for some low-level employee?


Mack thought, 'No way. Malcolm has to be here to back me up.' After all, compared to some nobody employee, he was a business partner. Malcolm wouldn't mix that up,right?


With that thought, Mack put on his best "feel sorry for me"face and limped over to Malcolm.


"Mr. Flynn, you gotta help me out here. Your employee'sgot a serious attitude problem, and she even tried to hurt me.Just look at these bruises."



Mack made a big show of pointing out the marks on his arm.


Malcolm didn't even blink. His face was a stone wall,giving nothing away.


Reese stood off to the side, arms crossed, shooting daggers at Mack. Seriously, a grown man lying like that? What a piece of work. She couldn't wrap her head around how someone like him ended up in charge.


Honestly, it didn't matter if Malcolm showed up or not. Reese had plenty of tricks up her sleeve to handle this jerk.But Malcolm's intentions were a wild card. Mack was a business partner, and the contract was practically a done deal. If it were anyone else, the project would've been signed, sealed, and delivered by now.


But Reese wasn't about to put up with this nonsense.She'd already bent over backward to keep her cool, but everyone has their breaking point.


Malcolm gave Reese a quick look, then turned his gaze to the bruised and battered Mack. His face was a mask,but his words cut deep.


"Reese wouldn't throw the first punch. Mr. Woods must've dòne something to set her off."


Mack narrowed his eyes. "So, you're blaming me? Mr. Flynn,watch what you say. Without proof, don't go throwing around accusations."


"If you want proof, we can just check the surveillance footage,"Malcolm said coolly, about to give Justin the go-ahead. But Mack jumped in,cutting him off.


"No need for that, Mr. Flynn. It's a minor issue. I didn't fight back because she's your employee and I wanted to save your reputation. But she hit me first, and that's something we can't just ignore."


Malcolm's expression hardened. "Justin, take Mr. Woods to the hospital for a full check-up. Make sure the doctors do a thorough examination and cover all the medical expenses upfront. Let's make sure Mr. Woods is comfortable there."


Reese couldn't help but chuckle. This wasn't helping Mack;it was a clear dig. Who in their right mind would want to stay in a hospital indefinitely? Even a perfectly healthy person would go nuts.



Mack got the message loud and clear. He shot a glare at Malcolm, but one icy look from Malcolm made him drop his gaze real quick.


Malcolm didn't have time to waste on this clown. His handsome face was already showing signs of irritation, and his sharp eyes flicked over to Mack's assistant.


"What are you waiting for? Get Mr. Woods to the hospital, now!" Malcolm barked.


The assistant, scared out of his wits by Malcolm's glare,quickly helped Mack and hustled him out of there. They looked more like they were running for their lives than anything else.



Reese had to give it to her husband-he was a force to be reckoned with. Even stuck in a wheelchair, he commanded the room. She couldn't help but wonder just how unstoppable he'd be once he was back on his feet.



She shrank back a bit, thinking maybe she should be a little more cooperative with him. Not that she was scared of him,but stirring the pot wasn't exactly on her to-do list.


The hall fell silent again. Malcolm rolled over to Reese, one eyebrow raísed.



"You've got some guts, ticking off a company client," Malcolm said,his tone sharp. Reese shot back, "He harassed me first."


Then, without missing a beat, she darted to Malcolm's side,wrapping her arm around his. She didn't care who was watching and gave him her best puppy-dog eyes.


"I had no choice but to defend myself. If I let him get away with it, wouldn't that tarnish your reputation too? I was fighting for your dignity and honor."


Justin stood off to the side, completely floored by what he was seeing. Reese was something else-she could throw down better than most guys, and her smooth talking had Malcolm eating out of her hand. If she were just a bit more stunning,he couldn't even imagine the chaos. How had he never noticed Malcolm was such a softie for her?



Malcolm gave her a quick look, his voice cool. "You sure know how to spin it. Go on, get back."


"Okay," Reese chirped, all smiles. Seeing Justin about to push Malcolm, she jumped in, "Tll handle it."



Reese wheeled Malcolm back to the office, and when their colleagues saw them, their jaws practically hit the floor. As soon as they got into the elevator, people started buzzing.


"Did I just see that? What's going on? Reese actually pushed Mr. Flynn back."



"How would I know? Wasn't Reese just brawling with Mr.
Woods at the hotel across the street?"



"Wait, she fought with Mr. Woods, that big guy?"



"But she doesn't look hurt at all."



"No clue."


"And Mr. Flynn didn't seem mad at all." Everyone was buzzing with curiosity about this new employee.She'd just started and already tangled with Isaac, who everyone avoided, and had a spat with Everly. She strutted out of the office like she owned the place, not like she was there to work. Everly sent her to get Mack to sign a contract, and not only did she fail, she ended up decking him.


"What the heck is going on?"


Reese's actions left everyone scratching their heads.



As the elevator numbers climbed, Reese thought about the weird looks from everyone earlier.


"Mr. Flynn, maybe... you should give me a symbolic scolding later. Otherwise, the employees might think there's something fishy going on between us."



Malcolm scoffed, "You've got the guts to hit a business partner and now you're worried about office gossip?" Reese gave an awkward smile. "I'm just trying to avoid causing you more trouble."


"Haven't you already caused enough?" Malcolm replied,though his tone was more resigned than angry.


Even Justin couldn't resist chiming in. "Mrs. Flynn, you're the first person in company history to assault a business partner."


And get away with it, he thought but didn't say.


Reese felt a bit sheepish. "I'll be more careful next time."


Malcolm chuckled, "You think there will be a next time?"


"No, there won't be a next time. As long as Everly doesn't give me those kinds of tasks, I promise. But if someone really buallies me, would you just stand by and watch your wife get pushed around?"
Her eyes were a mix of innocence and hurt, making Malcolm think she might look even better without those glasses.


Just then, the elevator doors opened. Seeing that Malcolm didn't respond, Reese let it go and pushed him out.


Back in the office, Reese felt like she had wrapped up her tasks for the day.



"T'll head out now. Call me if you need anything."


"Vincent is coming back tomorrow. He's not an ordinary person. Be careful and don't fall for his tricks," Malcolm advised,watching her leave.


Reese knew about Vincent, Malcolm's brother who had been abroad for years and rarely came home. She had no idea why he was returning this time.


But Reese wasn't one to be intimidated. As long as Vincent didn't mess with her, they'd be fine.


She appreciated Malcolm's concern. "Got it. Besides, I have you, right? He wouldn't dare do anything to me."



Malcolm lowered his head, a faint smile spreading across his face."True enough."



Justin,watching the intimate exchange between the two,couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy.



Once the office door closed again, Malcolm's previously gentle face turned icy cold, his voice carrying a chilling edge.


"Justin, find out all the companies under Mack's name. By tomorrow morning, I want to hear that he's bankrupt."



Anyone who dared to mess with Malcolm's wife would face the same consequence.
###Chapter 34 Who Dares to Step Up


Justin was floored, totally taken aback by how Malcolm was blowing this up.


He tried to calmn him down. "Mr. Flynn, isn't this a bit overboard? A small lesson should do the trick."


Malcolm shot him a look that could cut glass.


"Say one more word of nonsense, and you're out of here tomorrow."


Justin gulped and nodded. "T'll handle it right away!"



After leaving Malcolm's office, Reese ducked into the nearby storage room: Her once clear eyes now burned with a deadly intent.



She dialed Calvin's number, her beautiful face as cold as ice. "Dig up dirt on a guy called Mack. By noon tomorrow.I want him bankrupt!"


Calvin didn't get why Reese was suddenly on the warpath,but he knew one thing for sure that Reese was pissed. Mack must've really stepped in it.


But making someone go broke? Easy peasy for them.


"Anyone who messes with you is toast. Just wait till tomorrow."



Reese hung up, a cold smile playing on her lips. She was eager to see who'd be the first to crack.



As she walked past Everly's office, she heard the sound of stuff being smashed. Looked like Everly was throwing a tantrum because her plan had flopped. Reese just kept walking,unfazed. Everly had nearly trashed everything on her desk. Not only did Reese come back without a scratch, but she also didn't get any punishment. Malcolm's favoritism was off the charts.


What kind of black magic did this witch have to make him fall for her like this?



He used to spoil her the most, putting up with all her fits.But ever since Reese joined the Flynn family, everything changed.He didn't care about her anymore; his eyes were glued to Reese.



Why!


Susan, seeing Everly so mad, tried to calm her down. "Miss Flynn, please stop. Don't be angry. Maybe Reese just got lucky."



"It's not luck, it's..." Everly suddenly stopped, then she continued inwardly, 'It's Malcolm playing favorites. How does a girl from the sticks waltz into the Flynn family,join the company,and get Malcolm's favor just like that?'


Seeing her hesitate, Susan's curiosity got the better of her.
"Does Reese have some kind of secret background?"


Everly shot her a look that could kill, making Susan shrink back.



Sorry, Miss Flynn, I just want to help you out."



"If you really want to help, then find a way to get Reese out of the company."


But even if she got Reese out of the company, Reese would still be in the Flynn family.


Reese must've used some kind of black magic to charm
Malcolm.


Suddenly, Everly had an idea and stood up."You handle the rest. I'm outta here."


"Yes,ma'am."


When Reese got back to the Flynn Villa, she was hit by a strange smell as soon as she walked in. Then she heard Everly yelling at two servants.


"Tie up this seductress!"


The two servants stepped forward but hesitated, remembering how Alyssa had suffered last time.


Reese wasn't about to let herself get caught. As the two servants moved to grab her, Reese's calm gaze turned razor-sharp,freezing them in their tracks.


Seeing them hesitate, Everly lost it and screamed.


"She's just one woman! What are you scared of? Get her!" The servants, caught between a rock and a hard place,reluctantly moved forward. Reese stood her ground,but the aura she gave off made everyone around her feel like they were walking on thin ice.


"I warn you, if you don't want to be thrown out by me, don't touch me!"



But what could the servants do? They couldn't afford to piss off Everly either. They pretended to charge at her, but before they could even lay a finger on Reese, she grabbed one of their wrists. A loud crack was followed by a piercing scream.


"Ah... it hurts, it hurts, my hand is about to break!"


Seeing her companion in such agony, the other servant froze,too scared to make a move.



Everly barked at the two servants again. "All of you, get her together!" A minute later, those servants were all sprawled on the ground,groaning in pain.


Everly looked at the chaos, a room full of people, yet not one could get close to Reese.



She was shaking with rage, pointing a trembling finger at Reese.



"You seductress, how dare you fight back? Do you think you can turn the Flynn family upside down?"


Reese's eyes sparkled with a hidden edge.


"You ordered the attack first. I was just defending myself.You're like Alyssa, need a lesson in manners. Since you don't know any, I'll reluctantly teach you today,"


Before Everly could react, Reese moved so fast she was a blur.In an instant, Everly's hands were restrained, and she was dragged to a chair. Reese somehow found a rope and had her tied up in no time.



By the time Everly realized what was happening,she was already bound to the chair. She struggled in panic, glaring daggers at Reese.



"Reese,how dare you tie me up? Who gave you the guts to do this?"



"I just wanna teach you some respect. Stop calling me a seductress. You should know my name."



Reese stood firm, and no one around dared to move. The servants stood by, only able to watch, too scared to provoke her again.



Everly had never been treated like this before. She shook the chair violently, her hair a mess, her eyes blazing with fury. She screamed at the stunned servants. "Are you all dead? Come to untie me!"


Two servants, trembling, tried to approach, but Reese's voice cut through the air.


"If any of you take one step closer, I'll break her hand."


The two servants exchanged terrified glances, not daring to move forward.


Everly, her face turning red with rage, could only curse at Reese,her voice shaking with anger.


"Reese, before Malcolm and Grandpa get back, you better untie me, or you'Il be in big trouble when they return!"


Reese looked-unfazed, even raising an eyebrow at Everly with a smirk.



"Sure, go ahead and tell Malcolm. Let's see if he sides with me or you."



Everly was livid. "You useless bunch, are you just going to let Reese tie me up? Untie me now, or you'll all be out of the Flynn Villa tomorrow."


Her voice was hoarse from all the yelling,but no one dared to move.



Reese bent down, looking at Everly's twisted face.


"Realizing your mistakes yet?"



Everly was truly uncomfortable being tied up, and her throat was dry. Realizing her situation, she softened her tone.


"I was wrong. Please untie me."



"Am I a seductress? You know better than I do. Have you ever seen such an ugly seductress?" She smirked self-deprecatingly.


Everly was genuinely amazed. She had seen people insult themselves, but never someone who could call themselves ugly so casually.



"If you're not a seductress, how could you make Malcolm treat you so well? He used to cater to my every whim. Ever since you came into this house, he barely has time to talk to me."


Thinking about this, Everly's hatred for Reese grew. No one had ever dared to defy her since she was a child. Why did Reese take her place in Malcolm's heart as soon as she appeared?


Reese found her thoughts a bit unreasonable. To put it bluntly,it was just a strong sense of possessiveness.


"So you think that even after Malcolm got married, he should still revolve around you,cater to your every whim, and have eyes and heart only for you? Then where does that leave me, his wife?"


Everly snorted, "That's none of my business."


"Okay, let me make it clear today. Malcolm is my husband now. His body, his heart, should be mine. You're his sister. If you have any other thoughts about him, you better put them away. It won't end well."



With one look, Reese easily saw through Everly's thoughts.


###Chapter 35 Is Malcolm Helping Her?


Everly was caught off guard, a flash of panic in her eyes. Reese looked like she had just read Everly's mind.


She knew her feelings for Malcolm weren't just sibling stuff;they were full-on romantic. Her beef with Reese was different from Alyssa's. Alyssa just hated Reese for messing up the family vibe and was scared Reese would steal her thunder.


But now that the cat was out of the bag, she wasn't gonna hide it. She doubted Reese would have the guts to spill the beans to Malcolm about her crush.



She lifted her chin a bit, all smug and proud.


"So what if you know? You can't do squat about it. Once Malcolm can stand up, you think you can still crash at The Flynn V illa? Keep dreaming." Reese smirked to herself. She never planned on sticking around The Flynn Villa forever, but as long as she was there,no one was gonna push her around or try to tie her down.


Her cold fingers grabbed Everly's chin, making her look up.Everly locked eyes with her and was totally freaked out.


Reese's stare was so intense that Everly started to feel a bit uneasy.


"Miss Flynn, whether you like me or not doesn't matter,but don't push my buttons. Otherwise, I don't care who you are,I'll fight back just as hard."


Even if Malcolm were here right now, she wouldn't back down.


The nearby servants were in shock. Just a mnoment ago,Everly was all mouthy, but now she seemed to have lost her voice.Reese was just too intimidating. Everly wasn't actually mute; she was just too freaked out by Reese's vibe to say anything.


Right then, footsteps echoed from the doorway. Justin wheeled Malcolm in.



"What's all the commotion here?"


Even though Malcolm's tone was calm, it felt like there were hidden threats, making the servants go dead silent.


Seeing Malcolm, Everly's face lit up with hope, her eyes full of expectation.


"Malcolm, help me! Reese tied me up and even tried to hit me.Kick her out of our family."


Even the servants thought Reese was done for. Everyone knew Malcolm had a soft spot for his two sisters, Everly and Alyssa.
Plus, Reese had just married into the family, and there was no emotional bond between them yet.


Not only did the servants think this way, but Everly was convinced of it too. Malcolm had seen everything; there was no way he'd side with Reese,right?


This time, Reese had really dug her own grave. Everly was just waiting for the fireworks.



Justin pushed Malcolm closer. His deep, ocean-like eyes scanned the disheveled and furious Everly, then shifted to his calm wife.



She seemed totally composed. Wasn't she worried about getting blamed?



"Got nothing to say for yourself?"


"Nothing." If Malcolm trusted her, he'd find out the truth on his own. If he didn't, no amount of explaining would change his mind.



She'd always been like this, steady as a rock, never expecting much from others, so she wouldn't be let down.


As a kid, she used to wait by the door from dawn till dusk,hoping her dad would come take her home. But day after day,year after year, he never showed. That's when she learned that hope only leads to disappointment.


Since then, she vowed never to hope for anything from anyone.No matter how tough or tricky the problem, she'd handle it solo.



Malcolm was momentarily taken aback by her reaction.He had expected her to cry and make a scene, but she was so calm.


Was she too lazy to explain, or did she just not care if he misunderstood her? Reese wasn't particularly stunning, but her thoughts ran deep.


Seeing Reese not explaining. Everly decided to lay it on thick for Malcolm, with witnesses and all.


She cried to Malcolm, tears streaming down her face.


"Malcolm, you have to teach this woman a lesson. She tied me up and even beat all the servants."


Malcolm's eyes were cold. "Is that so?"


His toneclearly showed he didn't buy it. He knew Everly's character well. Although not as wild as Alyssa, the twosisters were pretty similar.


After all, they were both spoiled since childhood. How good could their tempers be?


Plus, Reese was a bit of a rebel and didn't play by thé rules. Naturally, Everly and Alyssa were always butting heads with her.



Everly could see Malcolm wasn't buying her story and quickly added, "If you don't believe me, just ask the servants."


When Malcolm's intense gaze swept over the servants,they felt a wave of pressure.


"Tell me,did Reese really come in and start hitting you all,thentie up Everly?"



The servants exchanged nervous glances,too scared to speak,worried they'd say the wrong thing and piss him off.


Everly was getting desperate. These servants were useless. If they pointed the finger at Reese, Malcolm would definitely believe them.


 
Everly shouted,"Why are you all mute now? Speak up!" One servant timidly stepped forward, about to say something.when Malcolm's commanding voice cut through the air again.


"If any of you dare to lie, I'll cut out your tongues and feed them to the fish in the pond!"


"This..." The servant was instantly paralyzed with fear,not knowing what to say.


Malcolm didn't give her a chance to hesitate, urging again."Speak!"


The servant's legs went weak, almost collapsing.


"Mr. Malcolm Flynn, please don't be angry. Miss Everly Flynn said Mrs. Reese Flynn is a seductress and even hired a witch from outside. But Mrs. Reese Flynn wvouldn't cooperate and then they..."


"Seductress?" Malcolm's eyes flashed dangerously,and the servant quickly lowered her head,trembling all over.


Everly felt like she was about to die. This idiot had just exposed her.


She hurriedly tried to explain, "Malcolm, don't listen to her nonsense,I..."



"Lock Everly in her room. Without my orders,she is not allowed to come out!"



Malcolm's sudden command left everyone stunned.


Malcolm was actually going to lock Everly in her room? Wasn't she his favorite?



Malcolm's patience had completely run out, and he roared.


"Can't you hear that?" The servants quickly sprang into action, first untying Everly.then preparing to take her upstairs. Everly couldn't let Malcolm punish herself as he wanted.


She strained her neck, turning her head to shout,"Malcolm,she really is a seductress. You have to believe me. She's definitely up to something by marrying into the Flynn family."


The servants were about to take her upstairs when Malcolm suddenly called out.


"Wait,let her go."


The servants thought there was a turn of events and quickly released Everly.



Everly was delighted,thinking Malcolm must have believed her. She hurried to him, looking tearful.


"Malcolm,you finally believe me. She really has ulterior motives. This woman must have used some witchcraft to enchant you."



"Enchant me?" Malcolm's face darkened instantly at these words. "Everly, you spent the whole day at the company researching this? Tell me, how is she a seductress?"



Everly,looking confident, raised her head. "How is she not?Ever since she married in, you've been especially fond of her.neglecting Alyssa and me."



Malcolm seemed surprised that Everly would convict Reese for such a reason.



"So because of this, you hired a witch to come to our house?"


"Yes, I wanted to expose this seductress!"


"Nonsense!" Malcolm's face turned red with anger, veins bulging on his forehead, scaring everyone present. Even Reese, though she kept her cool, felt a ripple in her calm heart at Malcolm's outburst.



Was he really angry at Everly for her sake?


Everly was as shocked as she looked. When she came to her senses,her heart tingled with a sense of grievance and tears streamed down her face.



"You say she's not a seductress and hasn't enchanted you? But you used to never be this harsh with me. You would always give me whatever I wanted,but now you're scolding me for this ugly woman!"



"I've spoiled you, but that doesn't mean you can be unreasonable." Malcolm rarely got angry with Everly,and his strong presence scared everyone.



Everly pouted, "When have I been unreasonable? Malcolm, I'm doing this for your own good." "You bullying my wife is also for my good?" Malcolm spoke righteously, his expression slightly fierce.
###Chapter 36 Ungrateful


Reese's eyes flickered with some weird emotion. Last time with Mack,she thought Malcolm was just putting up with her. like he had no choice but to help. But now, at home, in front of his favoritesister, there was no need for him to fake it.



She always felt like nothing in this world was reliable. If there was anything, it was just herself. Now, suddenly, someone was standing up for her, and it threw her off balance.


But honestly, she'd rather Malcolm not do this. People tended to get dependent. If he kept this up and then one day just stopped,she'd be crushed.


One heartbreak was enough.


Everly never expected Malcolm to go all outprotecting Reese,even calling her his wife. Anger bubbled up inside her,making her feel super uncomfortable. Watching the guy she liked defend someone else felf like a knife to the heart, bleeding all over the place.


Reese didn't want them to keep arguing. She was scared she'd start hoping for too much from Malcolm.


"She already said sorry, so let's just drop it. I'm not holding a grudge."



With that, she headed straight upstairs.


Malcolm watched her go and quickly asked Justin to help him up.



"Honey,wait up!"



In the living room, only Everly and a few confused servants were left.



"Is this stil] our cool and composed Mr. Flynn? Ever since he got hitched, he's like a whole new person."


"You guys just don't get it. I think it's better this way. At least he's more lively now. Before, he was so cold, just looking at him gave me chills."



Everly heard them and shot a nasty glare, making them zip it real quick.


She turned back and glared upstairs. Just wait, she wasn't gonna let Reese off easy. Not only did she steal the guy she liked, but she also had the nerve to cross her.


Back in her room, Reese sat at her desk, checking today's stocks on her laptop. She heard the door close behind her and knew without looking that Malcolm had followed her.


Malcolm's eyes showed a mix of boredom and curiosity.


"Didn't think you had this side to you." Everly, like Alyssa in the Flynn family, was never messed with.Aiden adored these two granddaughters who were raised with utmost care. But Everly was adopted, not a blood relative,So she was more restrained and sensible than Alyssa in many ways.


But today, for some reason, she had a direct clash with Reese and even brought in a witch.


Reese was still fuming. When she was mad, she didn't spare anyone,not even God.


She snapped back coldly, "I've got even more surprising sides.Wanna see?"



"No rush. We've got plenty of time. Long enough to see all your strengths and weaknesses."


Reese felt there was something deeper in his words. She turned to look at Malcolm, whose deep eyes sparkled like a sly fox. What was he scheming now?


Just then, Justin knocked on the door outside. He didn't want to interrupt, but it was urgent.


Malcolm called out, "Come in."


Justin opened the door and scanned the room. Everything seemed chill. Reese was typing away at her desk,busy with something, her fingers flying over the keyboard. Malcolm was lounging on the bed, looking as bored as ever.


"Mr. Robbins from Tank Group just called. He wants to know if you're free to hit up their wedding anniversaryparty tomorrow."



Clifford Robbins from Tank Group had been tight with Aiden back in the day, so it made sense he'd invite them.


Malcolm's eyes drifted over to Reese, who was still glued to her
computer.


Since it was a wedding anniversary party,bringing Reese along seemed like a good idea.


Justin had been with Malcolm for years. He couldn't always read MIalcolm's mind, but he could usually guess what he was thinking from a single look.



Malcolm wanted to bring Reese, but with her current look,wouldn't that be a bit of a disgrace to the Flynn family?


Even though Malcolm had trouble with his legs, it was still a no-go to bring someone who might lower their status.


He suggested, "Why not take Miss Everly Flynn as usual? She knows a lot of people and can help you out."


If Reese went, she'd be clueless. She wouldn't know the names or jobs of these indlustry bigwigs, and Malcolm would have to explain everything to her.


Unbeknownst to them, Reese heard every word of their conversation. Justin's words were clearly looking down on her.


Since he underestimated her, she was determined to go.


While Justin waited for Malcolm's decision, Reese suddenly walked over.



"Since it's a wedding anniversary party, it's only right to bring your wife. Bringing your sister might not be the best look."



As she spoke, she instinctively locked eyes with Justin. When Justin met her gaze, he was startled. A flash of fear suddenly appeared in his eyes.


How could she have such a look?


Before Justin could recover, Malcolm spoke up. "Reese will accompany me."


Justin could only nod. "Alright, I'll get the stylist to pick out outfits for Mr. and Mrs. Flynn for the evening."


Reese flashed a sweet smile. "Thanks, Justin."


For some reason, Justin got goosebumps from her smile.He forced a stiff grin.


"You're welcome,Mrs.Flynn."


After Justin left the room,Malcolm suddenly reached out to wrap his arm around her waist. But before he could touch her,Reese swiftly dodged, her clear eyes turning cold and wary as she looked at him.


"What are you trying to do now?"


Malcolm clearly noticed that Reese was very agile, likély having trained for many years. Her sensitive alertness suggested she sensed his move the moment he made it.


Was thisgirl really just from the countryside? He had his doubts.


Or maybe her identity was more than it seemed, and she was hiding something from him.


This slightly rustic girl was becoming more and more interesting.


He raised an eyebrow and smirked. "I just wanted to hug my wife. Is there a problem? We are legally married."


"Even if we are legally married, you can't act like this. We have no feelings for each other. Please respect me."


Reese's brows furrowed tightly, her face extremely serious,much like when she had just reprimanded Everly. Malcolm's lips curled into a devilish smile, captivating and alluring.



"I remember someone holding my arm and affectionately calling me hubby' last time. Have you become ungrateful so quickly?"
###Chapter 37 Playing Each Other


"Last time was just me trying to save my own skin,alright?"Reese said, thinking, 'Does he seriously think he's my hubby?'


When Malcolm heard that, he figured it was time for a real heart-to-heart.



So,you're saying you were just using me?"


"Isn't the Flynn family using me too? It's all about the benefits,right? As long as both sides get it, no need to spell it out."


"What if I said I wanna make this real and turn you into my actual wife?"



Malcolm's eyes flickered, the faint smell oftobacco mixing with the floral scent from outside. The light gave him a golden glow.making him look softer. Still, he was as bold and dazzling as ever. Reese had to admit Malcolm was a looker, especially that face of his. He could turn heads wherever he went. But she had her own plans and didn't want to waste her life on some guy.



"Not interested." She shot him down without a second thought.



Malcolm's ego took a hit.


Was he not hot enough, or was his charm just not cutting it,that even a small-town girl would turn him down?


He looked genuinely hurt, his brows knitting together. "Why?"


"No reason. Marriage was never on my radar. It was just a fluke."



So, for the rest of her life, she hadn't planned on including any man in it.But she underestimated a man's pride. Malcolm had never been denied anything he wanted. Even with this project.
everyone thought he couldn't pull it off, but he was determined to prove them wrong.


Reese might not catch your eye at first, but the more he looked.the more he saw her unique charm. The key was, she had an intriguing soul, and he was into that.


It was like she had a ton of secrets just waiting for him to uncover, and that hooked him big time.


For now, Malcolm wasn't about to let Reese slip away that easily.



He decided not to argue with her. Everything had its own timing.



"Alright, but you gotta keep your promise and help me fix my leg first. There are only a few days left until the deadline Grandpa gave you, So you need to hustle."Reese had always kept that in mind. She probably knew his condition better than Malcolm himself.



She suddenly gave him a playful wink. "Maybe in a couple of days,you'll be up on your feet."


Malcolm doubted Reese had such mad skills. How could paralysis be something she could just wave away?


But he didn't want to kill her vibe.


"Alright, I'll leave it all to you."


Reese noticed Malcolm hadn't mentioned the banquet at all.Was he really not worried about her showing up with a face full of spots?


But considering he stood up for her in front of Everly today,she didn't want to let him down.As usual, Reese would help Malcolm with acupuncture before bed. Recently, they added a new treatment-medicinal baths.which involved him taking off his pants. It was a bit awkward at first. but after a few days, they got used to it. After all, to a doctor, patients have no gender. If it didn't work, just think of him as a pet.


But if Malcolm knew she thought of him as a pet, he might just lose it.


Two days later, Reese was chilling at home when Justin brought her the dress. It was a stunning gown, gray-blue with dark tones, probably considering her skin tone.


Initially, she hid her looks to test Malcolm's character. After spending time together, she found him decent enough.


The key was that walking around with a face full of freckles every day did invite some nasty comments.


But the dress was pretty sweet. She wasn't into bright colors anyway-they were too flashy. Low-key was more her style.


She headed downstairs to grab a bite and planned to wash off the freckles later. As soon as she hit the bottom step, she heard
Alyssa snarking while holding a cup of coffee.


"I heard you plan to show up at tonight's banquet?"


Reese raised an eyebrow, cool as a cucumber. "Got a problem with that?"


Alyssa thought, 'This ugly duckling is way too calm.She probably doesn't even realize how hideous she looks.'


Her face twisted with disdain, like she was afraid Reese might miss it.


"I mean, have you even looked in a mirror, you freak? With that face, you dare to show up at someone else's wedding anniversary party and make a fool of yourself?" Reese didn't flinch, even tilted her chin tip a bit to meet Alyssa's glare. Her eyes were full of spirit, not a hint of insecurity.



"So what? It's a wedding anniversary party, shouldn't we couple go together? Or should you and your brother go instead?"



Alyssa lifted her chin arrogantly. "Of course, I'm not into those events. Usually, Everly goes with Malcolm. Why should your ugly mug ruin that?"



"Because I'm his wife now. Is that reason enough?"



Reese's confidence was through the roof, her aura even overshadowing Alyssa's. Alyssa was usually the queen bee at home,but for some reason, she felt a step down in front of Reese.



For a moment, her brain short-circuited, and she didn't know what to say. But she wasn't about to let Reese get the upper hand,so she started throwing a fit.


"Just because you're his wife now doesn't mean you'll always be. It's only because of the engagement between our families.But even after marriage, there's divorce. Just wait, Malcolm will dump you sooner or later!"


Reese didn't get mad at all. Instead, she smiled, her eyes curving. "Then let's talk about it when Malcolm divorces me.At least for now, today, I'm still his wife."


Alyssa looked her up and down with pure contempt,arms crossed, her gaze dripping with disdain.


"Have you even looked at your ugly face in the mirror? Do you know what kind of people will be there? Socialites,all of them way more beautiful than you. The Flynn family is one of the top dogs in Atlanta. Don't drag them down. If you show up with Malcolm tonight, do you know what the headlines will be tomorrow?" She waved her hand dramatically, acting it out. "It'll definitely be Flynn family's Mr. Flynn's wife is hideous, lowering the family's standards."



No matter how much Alyssa tried to rile her up. Reese stayed cool and collected.



"If the Flynn family judges me by my looks, wouldn't that also lower your standards? No, it should be you lowering the Flynn family's quality."


Alyssa's face turned beet red, her shoulders shaking with rage.


She pointed at Reese furiously. "You..."


"T'll go if I want to. It's none of your business. Not even Malcolm can stop me."


Not only the Flynn family had the invite. Even without Malcolm,she could still get in. Alyssa couldn't get through to her. Reese was sharp-tongued.no matter what Alyssa said, Reese had a comeback ready.easily shutting her down.



When she looked into Reese's eyes earlier, she realized Reese wasn't like other girls. Her brows carried an unshakable arrogance,full of confidence.


Damn it, where did she get the nerve to think she could attend such a high-class event with that ugly face?


Since she couldn't convince her, it didn't matter. She'd just wait for Reese to embarrass the Flynn family and get thrown out by Grandpa. That was what she really wanted to see.
###Chapter 38 Shocking the Crowd


Once Alyssa figured it out, she stopped bickering with Reese."Fine,let's see how you make a fool of yourself at the party today,you country bumpkin!"


She practically spat out those last words through gritted teeth.


Reese just smirked. "Thanks for the heads-up, Miss Flynn."



She sat down at the dining table, cool as a cucumber,and started munching on her breakfast.


Alyssa was floored by Reese's appetite. 'What kind of feak is Reese? She eats like a horse but never gains a pound.' Alyssa glanced down at herself, noticing she'd put on a few pounds lately, which only fueled her rage. She stomped off upstairs in a huff.



Reese didn't even bat an eye and kept eating before heading back to her room.


After doing her makeup. she made a video call to Calvin.
Calvin was always on standby, ready whenever Reese needed him.



When Calvin's face popped up on the screen, he looked like he'd seen a ghost.



"Reese,you..."


Reese raised an eyebrow. "Why the shocked face? What's wrong?"


"Reese,why'd you change back?"


He'd gotten used to seeing Reese's less-than-stellar look lately.But today, bam, a total knockout. His heart skipped a beat.


Reese brushed her bangs aside. "No biggie. I'm hitting up a party tonight. If I showed up looking like I did before, it'd be a total embarrassment. He might not care, but I do."


"Oh,gotcha. But Reese, you look way better like this,easy on the eyes, never gets old."


Calvin started laying it on thick.


"Cut the crap. Has the Mack situation been sorted out?"


"I was just about to tell you. Right when I was about to make a move,Mack declared bankruptcy outta nowhere."



Calvin was scratching his head. Mack going under that fast?No way, his cash flow was solid. Someone had to be pulling the strings.


Reese only needed a second to figure it out.


"It was Malcolm." "Your husband?"


"Yeah, only he could tank Mack that quickly." She never doubted Malcolm's skills. If he hadn't been paralyzed in that car crash, the Flynn Group would probably be even more of a powerhouse now.


She'd studied the big projects he handled before. They all took these wild, out-of-the-box approaches that normal folks couldn't wrap their heads around. But that's exactly why he stood out and became a top dog in the industry.


Calvin's respect for Malcolm shot up. "You know, Reese, I used to think your paralyzed husband wvas kinda useless, especially in that department..."



"Watch your mouth!" Reese's usually soft eyes turned razor-sharp, and Calvin felt like he was about to wet himself.


Her stare was still as terrifying as ever. Calvin quickly backpedaled. "Alright, alright, I won't
badmouth your husband. Since he's your hubby now, he's my boss too."



Reese wasn't in the mood for his brown-nosing.


"Since Malcolm already took care of Mack, just drop it. Go handle something else."


"Got it, I'll hang up now, Reese."


After ending the call, Reese dove back into her work.She got so wrapped up in it that she didn't even notice it was getting dark. That's just how she rolled-once she was in the zone,time flew by.



When she was finally ready, Malcolm shot her a text,saying he'd be tied up for a bit longer and she should grab a cab.Reese wa s cool with that. After stepping out of the house, Reese flagged down a cab and headed to the party. The moment she stepped out of the car.all eyes were glued to her.


"Who's that girl? She's stunning. Look at her skin, like perfect porcelain."



"Beats me, but she looks like she just walked out of a fairy tale.Gorgeous."


"Think we should ask for her number?"


"Forget it. In a place like this, there's no way she's flying solo.She's gotta have a date."


Not too far away, Dahlia and Nancy were standing together.
Dahlia had planned to be the star of the show tonight,especially with so many big shots around. She was hoping to snag herself a rich husband. But now,everyone who had been fawning over her had their eyes on the girl who just got out of the cab. What the heck was going on?


Dahlia's face twisted in annoyance. "What's so special about someone who arrived in a cab?"


"Relax, maybe she's just too ugly. Today,my daughter is dèfinitely the belle of the ball. I heard Malcolm's coming too.Wonder who he'll bring as his date."


Dahlia's eyes gleamed with arrogance, and she let out a sneer.


"There's no way it's my ugly sister. But why does she go out of her way to look so hideous?"


"Just trying to be mysterious. Don't worry,even if she shows her real face, no one's gonna care. A country bumpkin like her can't hold a candle to my precious daughter." Hearing this, Dahlia's smile widened. She lifted her chin and straightened her back, like a proud peacock.


"Of course, I'm your daughter. How could those lowlifes compare to me?"


The mother-daughter duo strutted into the venue arm in arm.Meanwhile,Reese found a quiet corner and shot a message to Malcolm.


Reese: [When are you getting here? I'm already at the party.]


Malcolm must've been swamped because it took him a few minutes to reply.


Malcolm: [Walk around a bit. Don't cause any trouble.]


Reese rolled her eyes. Did she look like a troublemaker?


Malcolm probably thought she was a fish out of water at these fancy events and was worried she'd embarrass him.


Even sittingin the corner. Reese was a magnet for attention.Naturally, the guys couldn't resistand kept coming over to ask for her number, but she turned them all down. Nancy and Dahlia wvere on the prowl for potential suitors as soon as they walked in. But instead of finding any, they spotted the radiant Reese in the corner.


Dahlia pointed in shock. "Mom, isn't that Reese?"


Nancy followed her gaze. "It really is Reese. Why's she all dolled up today?"



"Mom, that dress she's wearing is from an international designer's latest collection. It's a one-of-a-kind,limited edition.You can't just buy it with money. I couldn't even get my hands on it, and she's wearing it." Nancy's face twisted with jealousy. "I didn't expect Reese to clean up so well. Anyone who didn't know better would think she's some high-society lady."



Dahlia gritted her teeth, her hands twisting the hem of her dress like she wanted to tear it apart, imagining it was Reese.



A sinister glint appeared in her eyes. "Reese must be trying to steal may thunder. If she wants to stand out so badly, I'Il help her."



Nancy noticed the devious look on Dahlia's face. "What are you planning to do?"
###Chapter 39 Catching Mrs. Flynn's True Colors



Dahlia's eyes locked onto the stage. "Isn't there a piano solo coming up?Let's make sure she gets her moment."



She was itching to make Reese look like a fool, especially in front of Malcolm. Once they got home. Reese would be in for it.



Nancy was all in. "No time to waste, let's go."


--
The two of them strutted over to Reese, who was so glued to her phone she didn't even notice them coming.



It wasn't until that snarky, sarcastic voice cut through the air that she looked up.



Dahlia stood there, smirking down at Reese.



"Well, if it isn't my sister who married rich? What,Malcolm didn't tag along? Or does he think you're too low-class to be seen with?"
Reese knew all too well the games this mother-daughter duo played.



But today, she wasn't in the mood to entertain them.



She stood up. and just like that. her presence was undeniable. She was already taller than Dahlia. and with her heels, she towered over her.



Dahlia,feeling Reese's commanding vibe, took a couple of steps back.Nàncy noticed and quickly grabbed her arm.



"What are you doing?"



Even Dahlia was confused. "I..."



Why did she feel scared just now? Reese hadn't even said a word, yet she felt a bit intimidated.



Reese, like a queen surveying her subjects, gave themn a look of pure disdain.



"You'd better don't mess with me. You two are here to snag rich
husbands. right? Don't mess up your makeup, it's not worth it."



With that, she strutted past Nancy and Dahlia in her high heels, heading straight for the center of the hall.



Dahlia and Nancy exchanged bewildered looks, not expecting the showdown to end before it even started.



They were actually spooked by Reese. What just happened?



But Dahlia wasn't about to let it slide. She had a golden opportunity and wasn't about to waste it.



"Mom, head backstage and have a word with the host. Slip him a little something. I want to make sure Reese can't even crack a smile later."



Nancy caught on immediately."Got it."

 

Ten minutes later, the host took the stage, mic in hand,and gave a deep bow to the guests. "Thank you all for coming to this party. We've got a specíal treat lined up.I bet all the young ladies here can play the piano. How about we pick a lucky guest to play a piece and spice things up?"



The crowd erupted in applause, all for it. It was a prime chance to show off.



"Alright, let's start the draw and see who our lucky performer is."



The lights above started to flicker. Reese was still glued to her phone,texting Malcolm. Was he really going to bail on her today? He still hadn't shown up.



Suddenly, the lights zeroed in on Reese, making her squint. She instinctively raised her hand to shield her eyes and heard the host call out.



"Let'swelcome this young lady to the stage to play a piece for us."



The applause was deafening.



Dahlia,standing behind Reese, gave her a nudge with a smug grin. The crowd erupted in applause, all for it. It was a prime chance to show off.


"Alright, let's start the draw and see who our lucky performer is."


The lights above started to flicker. Reese was still glued to her phone, texting Malcolm. Was he really going to bail on her today? He still hadn't shown up.


Suddenly, the lights zeroed in on Reese, making her squint. She instinctively raised her hand to shield her eyes and heard the host call out.


"Let's welcome this young lady to the stage to play a piece for us."


The applause was deafening. Dahlia, standing behind Reese.gave her a nudge with a smug grin.


"Reese, what are you waiting for? Get up there."


Nancy chimed in, "Yeah, hurry up. Everyone's waiting for you to play."


Seeing the eager looks on their faces, Reese,sharp as ever, instanly knew she was being set up.


But she wasn't fazed. She could turn the tables on them.


With all eyes on her, Reese gracefully made her way to the stage. Her smooth, delicate skin, combined with her stunning figure and those captivating butterfly bones, was a sight to behold. "She's a real stunner. I'm definitely getting her number later."


"What if she's got a boyfriend?"


"So what? I'm loaded."


Reese faced the crowd's stares with an almost eerie calm. When she stepped onto the stage,the host looked a bit surprised.


"Miss, the piano's over there."


"I can't play," Reese said, straight-up.


The crowd erupted in laughter.


"She's gorgeous but can't play the piano? Is she just pretending to be some high-society chick?" "But that dress she's wearing, I saw it in a magazine.It's by a famous foreign designer, and there's only one in the world."


"If she can afford a dress like that, how could she not know how to play the piano? What a joke."


Dahlia and Nancy sat in the audience, eagerly waiting for Reese to make a fool of herself.How could a country girl know how to play the piano.


Once it got out that she was Malcolm's wife, the Flynn family,who were all about their reputation, would definitely push Malcolm to dump her.


Reese listened to the whispers and mocking comments around her, her face as calm as ever, not even a hint of a frown. Anyone else would have been mortified and wished they could disappear. 
Reese's clear, sharp eyes scanned the audience as she spoke.


"It doesn't have to be the piano. Any other talent would do, right?"


She walked over to the host and whispered something in his ear. He nodded.


"No problem."


The audience was buzzing with curiosity about what Reese was planning.


A few seconds later, the stage lights suddenly went out, plunging everyone into darkness.


Someone panicked, "What's going on? Why is it dark?" "Is she some kind of assassin?"


"Have you been watching too many movies?"


"Maybe she's planning to bolt. I mean, it's pretty embarrassing for a so-called socialite not to know how to play the piano. Isn't there a trend online about people faking being socialites? Maybe she snuck in with some guy."


"Could be, but she's got that aura. If you hadn't pointed it out, I wouldn't have guessed she's a fake."


Dahlia and Nancy were convinced Reese had run off.Reese didn't know squat, not even the basics of any instrument. She was just a vulgar nebody.


Dahlia tugged on Nancy's arm, feeling over the moon.Finally, Reese was humiliated, and luckily, no one knew she was from the Brooks family. "Mom,you should tell everyone that Reese is Malcolm's new wife later. By tomnorrow morning, the whole circle will be buzzing."


Nancy's eyes gleamed wwith a dark light, smiling triumphantly. "Damn her. She didn't even show us any respect when she saw us. She really thinks we can't handle her?"


Just as they thought their plan was foolproof, the lights in the hall flicked back on. Reese stood in the center of the stage, now dressed in a ballet outfit. Her tall, well-proportioned figure shone brightly under the spotlight.


The music started, and Reese began to move her graceful arms, spinning beautifully. Her agile body performed exquisite dance moves that left the audience in awe. When Justin wheeled Malcolm in, he immediately sensed something was up. Even the lighting felt different. Following the crowd's gaze, he saw the petite figure on stage, dancing like a flowing river, spinning like a dazzling fairy, captivating everyone's attention.


Justin stood behind Malcolm, his mouth wide enough to fit an egg.


"Mr. Flynn... is that Mrs. Flynn?"


Malcolm didn't respond, quietly watching her dance,his eyes filled with confidence and a sparkling light.


A mysterious smile slowly curved on his lips. Well,she actually dared to deceive him.
###Chapter 40 So It Was Mr. Flynn's Wife
After the dance, Reese took a bow on stage,and the crowd went wild with applause and endless compliments.


"Oh my God, that dance was absolutely stunning. That young lady was as graceful and elegant as a swan."


"I suddenly realize that playing the piano can't compare to dancing."


"She must be some family's precious daughter who they usually keep hidden away like a treasure."


All the haters who doubted Reese earlier were all dead silent now.
Meanwhile, Dahlia and Nancy were in the audience.looking like they'd just seen a devil. Neither could believe what they were seeing.


Dahlia was the first to snap out of it, her face full of disbelief.


"Mom,what did we just see? Was that Reese?"


That dance, that light and agile figure, could only come from years of hardcore practice.


Dahlia knew a bit about dance herself, but she hadn't practiced in ages and felt stiff as a board. Ballet,especially, needed top-notch fitness and flexibility.


Nancy was also in a daze, her face pale.0


"Y-Yeah, but she seemed like a completely different person. Her demeanor on stage was nothing like her usual self."


A question suddenly popped into Dahlia's mind.


"Is she really from the countryside?"


Reese had just finished changing backstage and was about to bounce when Harold Garcia stepped in front of her.


"Miss, I'm a director. Your demeanor and appearance perfectly match what we're looking for in an actress.Would you consider it?"


Reese politely declined the business card he offered.


"Sorry, I'm not cut out to be an actress. Thanks for the offer." As she spoke. she tried to sidestep Harold to leave.The nearby staff were floored.


"Who is this woman? She just turned down Harold's invitation. He's launched so many careers. Anyone he picks, if they're talented, becomes a huge star. Even those who aren't that talented end up in the top tiers.Does she not know who he is?"


"Maybe she doesn't. Otherwise,how could she refuse such a big director's invitation?"


Harold was pretty chill about it. He was confident that anyone he set his sights on would eventually sign with him.Maybe this girl just didn't recognize him.


He pulled out another business card. "It's alright. Miss,you might be cautious around strangers, which is understandable. Here's my card. If you ever change your mind,feel free to contact me." Reese wanted to get back to thé hall quickly, otherwise.Malcolm would start looking for her.

She reached out to take the card, but just as she was about to grab it, someone else snatched it away


Both Harold and Reese looked over in confusion.Malcolm had arrived at some point and was now holding the card, glancing at it.


Reese asked him, "Why did you come backstage?"


"I couldn't find you. The staff said you were here, so I came over," he said nonchalantly.


Reese then noticed that he was wearing a black tailored suit today. His features were perfect,his lines sharp, exuding a strong masculine aura. The imposing air around him gave off a natural sense of nobility and distance, completely different from the playful
demeanor he had shown her that night.


Harold, of course,recognized Malcolm.Such a
prominent figure was not only famous in the business world but also a legendary figure in their film
industry, influencing the entire economy of Atlanta.
Who wouldn't know him?


"Mr. Flynn, what a pleasure to meet you. May I ask who this beautiful young lady is?"


"My wife," he said, raising an eyebrow, his voice full and carrying a hint of pride.


Harold finally snapped back to reality and laughed at himself.


"No wonder this young lady turned me down, she's Mr.Flynn's wife."
They didn't need money. so naturally, she wouldn't be interested in the film industry.


Malcolm quickly tried to dismiss Harold.


"Harold, if there's nothing else. we'll be on our way."


With that, Malcolm took Reese's slightly cool hand and held it tightly in his palm.


Harold could only step aside respectfully and say politely, "Alright."


Reese,being quick-witted, started pushing Malcolm's wheelchair towards the hall. Malcolm fiddled with the watch on his other wrist, his tone indifferent, making it hard to guess his emotions at the moment.


"I'm really honored today to see my wife's true colors."


His words were a bit sarcastic and somewhat bitter.Reese couldn't see his face, so she didn't know if he was angry. But he had every right to be; she had indeed hidden her true appearance.


However, she had already thought of a reasonable excuse. She never did anything without a plan.


Reese curved her lips into a smile, her tone light.


"Isn't it a pleasant.surprise?"


Malcolm shrugged, but his tone was tinged with coldness.


"It is quite a surprise." They shared a bed every night and although they hadn't had sex, he should at least know what his wife looked like.


Reese's eye twitched. Judging by his tone, he was probably angry. She bent down, wrapped her arms around his neck, and changed her previously serious demeanor. Dealing with men required complexity and unpredictability, making them unsure of your temperament and hesitant to provoke or underestimate you.


"Well, I was suddenly married off to you by my dad.How was I supposed to know if you had any weird habits? What if you were abusive or had strange preferences? If I looked a bit ugly, you wouldn't do anything to me."


He remained unmoved, letting out a cold snort. "Do youa think I haven't seen any beautiful women before? How could you come up with that?"


"I was just worried. But seeing how handsome,
elegant, and especially caring you are, I feel relieved."


Reese started to flatter him, a skill she had picked up from Calvin.


Malcolm could see through her flattery, but somehow,it was still pleasing to hear.


If she wanted to play this game, he would play along.


He began to bring up old grievances. "Who was it that treated me like a devil a fewv days ago, not even letting me touch them?"


"We both know that I married you because of the engagement between our grandfathers. Mr. Flynn is born noble; even if he were to marry, it should be to a socialite. How could someone like me, from the countryside, possibly spend a lifetime with you?"


Reese lowered her status, trying to make Malcolm clear that their marriage was only temporary and wouldn't last. She didn't want to spend her days in a wealthy family, constantly scheming against other women. It was too exhausting.


She preferred freedom, with no one to restrain her,doing whatever she wanted.


The Flynn family had many relatives, and in the future, she would inevitably have to deal with those eccentric relatives, constantly scheming. It was tiring.

She had indeed grown up in the countryside, so she was used to a free and easy life. If she had to stay in this environment forever, it would be like being in a cage.


For some reason, Malcolm felt a faint anger rising in his heart when he heard Reese's words,his brows furrowing tightly.


"Who I want to marry and spend my life with doesn't depend on their family background. Even if she's from the countryside, as long as I like her, that's all that matters."

Highly recommend "Flash Marriage: The Wife Who Shook High Society"! A substitute marriage to a disabled CEO, followed by a stunning comeback and face-slapping drama-tightly woven plot, absolutely thrilling!

###Chapter 41 Malcolm Takes First Place
Reese felt surprised to hear Malcolm's serious words.Usually, he was carefree, sometimes as cold as a statue,and it seemed like he didn't value emotions much. She didn't expect him to speak so seriously. The atmosphere became somewhat suppressed, and even Reese,who was usually sharp-tongued, didn't know how to respond to Malcolm's words.


Malcolm wasn't surprised by Reese's lack of response.After all, they hadn't spent much time together, and he didn't want to force it.


Turning around, his enigmatic eyes were filled with curiosity as he watched her shine today.Especially in her gray-blue dress, which made her skin look flawless. He admitted that seeing her shine on stage today had stirred something in him. Interest and surprise. The intrigue and delight she brought him far exceeded his expectations.


However, he had one question, and he wanted to clear it up, "Let me ask you again, at the auction the other day,was that you I saw from behind?"


Reese's heart skipped a beat, but she replied very seriously, "You must have mistaken someone else for me. If I truly had the money to attend an auction,would I still be coerced by my father into marrying you?"


Her response made sense, which led Malcolm to question his observation. However, his suspicion still lingered.


Malcolm couldn't find any counterargument, but even so,he couldn't fully trust her again. This girl had deceived him more than once; it was as if each revealed truth only uncovered another layer of deceit.


Malcolm also had his own plans. Regardless of her answer,he would have Justin investigate again. The people around him couldn't be so unclear.


Under Malcolm's scrutiny, Reese felt worried,afraid that he would ask something she couldn't answer.
This man was suspicious, and since her first day in his life,Justin had investigated her, aImost digging up her childhood as well.


But she didn't say any of this.


Fortunately, at this moment, Dahlia and Nancy walked over. Their expressions had shifted from displeasure to forced smiles,which seemed hypocritical. However, Reese felt that their arrival relieved her urgent situation and gave her some time to think.


Dahlia saw Malcolm, and there was still a hint of shyness in her eyes. After all, Malcolm's appearance was outstanding among the men, and his temperament was unparalleled.


"Good evening."


Malcolm only nodded lightly, without much response.


Dahlia's enthusiasm seemed to not receive much response from Malcólm, which made her uncomfortable. She believed her looks were not bad,and her temperament was beyond words.


She had been raised in the Brooks family since she was young, received a high-level education, and excelled in various arts and skills. Whereas Reese was just a wild girl who thought she was a swan after wearing clothes designed by famous designers.


Little did she know, lowliness emanated from within.


Nancy took the initiative to greet Malcolm, "MalcoIm,although we haven't met before, now that Reese has married you, we are family. You should call me mother."


Malcolm raised his eyelids, not saying a word, but it made Nancy pause. His gaze was cold and piercing,and a touch of strangeness flickered in his deep and dark eyes.


An invisible pressure enveloped Nancy and Dahlia,making it hard for them to breathe.


The atmosphere was awkward, and in the end, Dahlia came forward to smooth things over. "Mom, this is Mr. Flynn's first meeting with you.
Perhaps he is not very familiar. Reese just got married to Mr. Flynn, and their relationship is not particularly good."


Reese replied sharply, "What makes you say that my darling and I have a bad relationship?"


Dahlia was taken aback, not expecting that in front of Malcolm, Reese wouldn't be afraid that he would think she was too strong and lacked manners?


But what she didn't know was that Reese never cared about others' opinions of her. She had always been independent anddid as she pleased.


Nancy seemed to have eased off from Malcolm's attitude just now and responded to her, "Reese, your sister is also concerned about you. Don't be so harsh on her." She was polite, but it seemedI like she was blaming Reese for it.


Dahlia followed Nancy's words with a pitiful look,almost on the verge of tears, "Yeah sis! I just wanted to show my concern for you. I didn't mean to speak ill of you in front of your husband. Why do you have so much hostility towards me?"


Reese was truly enlightened. These two women had a special understanding between them. But even if Malcolm didn't like her because of this, Reese didn't care at all. She wasn't like them, willing to do anything to marry into a wealthy family. Reese was being true to herself, and if you liked her, then fine. If not, she didn't mind. Besides, she could live without a man.


While Dahlia discreetly wiped her tears, she noticed a slight change in Malcolm's expression. She was secretly delighted, thinking that Reese's reaction had caught Malcolm's attention. Indeed, who would like their wife behaving like a shrew outside? Just as crying children often get their way.


Just as she was about to witness Malcolm getting angry with Reese, he suddenly held her hand, and then sharp eyes were directed at them.


"My wife can do as she pleases. Even if she wants to tear this roof off, I will support her. And let me remind you both, my woman is not someone you can bully."


Reese was almost stunned. In that instant, she felt that Malcolm's image had been elevated in her heart.Especially with his last sentence, Reese's heart felt like it was about to burst. Could this be the feeling of falling in love?

Dahlia and Nancy, who were just gloating a moment argO,,immediately froze. Before the two could react, Malcolm said, "Honey, let's go back. It's already getting late."


Reese crisply responded, "Alright, darling." She pushed Malcolm past the dazed Dahlia and Nancy.


By the time the two regained their composure,Malcolm and Reese were long gone. Dahlia's face twisted in an expression of deep resentment,her fingernails tightly gripping her dress. Her eyes were filled with a desire to devour.


"Reese actually managed to make Malcolm defend her like that. Didn't they say he has a weird temper and likes to torment people?"


It was because of these rumors andI gossip from the outside world that she chose not to marry Malcolm and let Reese be the sacrifice instead. But now, Reese was living a much better life than before.Although Malcolm appeared cold, he didn't seem like the person rumored outside.


Those peculiarities, such a violent temper.


She didn't mind his paralysis as long as the Flynn family was prosperous. If Malcolm could think of her in the future and give her a share of the family fortune, she wouldn't have to worry about food and drink for the rest of herlife.


At the moment, it seemed like Malcolm not only didn't have a volatile temperament, but perhaps he also dotes on his wife.


Nancy was also surprised by how handsome Malcolm was, especially his features. They were sharp and distinct, and just sitting there, he seemed like a divine being. .But it's a pity that such a man is paralyzed.


However Nancy's eyes lit up with a new idea, which could allow her daughter to live a life similar to Reese's.
###Chapter 42 The Country Bumpkin Has Transformed
Nancy gently patted Dahlia's shoulder and reassured her, "Don't worry, I have a plan. Now that we know the Flynn family isn't as terrifying as we thought, and you've broken up with that guy, we can ask Reese for help."


Dahlia hadn't grasped the situation yet and asked,"How can Reese help? Didn't you see her attitude just now?"


"The Flynn family has more than just Malcolm as their son. Don't they also have a doctor named Vincent? Although he can't compare to Malcolm,if you marry into the Flynn family and give birth to a son,your position will be completely different from Reese's." After hearing Nancy's words, Dahlia started to have some thoughts, and her anger gradually subsided.


"But what if Reese refuses to help us?"


"If she dares not to help, you can go afterMalcolm.If anything ugly happens, she won't be able to stay out of it."


Nancy was determined this time, thinking that if they could succeed, the Brooks family would rise to great heights. When Dahlia took control, it would be a piece of cake to kick that wild girl out of the Flynn family.


A new light gathered in Dahlia's eyes.


"That's what we'll do. Once I marry into the Flynn family,Reese will suffer." She dared to be arrogant in front of her,without considering whether she was worthy or not. Reese and Malcolm left the venue before she finally spoke up, "Why are you leaving so soon after jst arriving?"


Malcolm glanced at her indifferently, "Do you still want to stay here and continue watching those two women? Waiting for them to set another trap for you?"

Justin had just checked for him and revealed that Reese's appearance on stage was a helpless act.
Originally, Dahlia and her mother wanted to make Reese look bad.


If things really went wrong, not only would Reese lose face, but Mr. Robbins might also accuse her of ruining his party, considering that high-end people were present today. However, Nancy and Dahlia were not surprised by this. Reese couldn't play the piano,but she could dance. Malcolm decided to go back and question her about this dance. He wondered how many talents his wife still had hidden.


Reese's face showed no surprise or resentment, "I knew from the moment I saw them that today wouldn't be so simple. Luckily, they only asked me to perform and didn't make me do anything else.Besides, I managed to escape unscathed. You even helped me shut them up, anad you should have seen the displeasure on stepmother's face."


Thinking about this, Reese couldn't help but smile. In the past, she had refrained from confronting Nancy directly due to the timing not being right. Even if Malcolm hadn't helped her get this relief today, she would never let Nancy and the others off easily. If it weren't for them, she should have stayed with her grandmother in the Brooks family, and everything Dahlia got would have been hers.


Her grandmother left the Brooks family for her sake.Without her grandmother, she wouldn't be who she is today.


Malcolm noticed how her previously gentle face suddenly grew cold, with a sharpness unbefitting of her age, as she seemed to have experienced countless trials and tribulations. This was not something she could fake.


After returning to the Flynn family mansion, Reese first took Malcolm to his room and then went downstairs to prepare medicine for him and check on his legs. However, she got distracted and forgot to change her clothes. As she held the medicine and was about to go upstairs, Alyssa suddenly stopped her. "Hey, who are you? How dare you come into the Flynn family mansion and steal things!"


Reese turned around, and Alyssa immediately froze on the spot. Her shocked expression seemed to have been frozen, and she didn't even blink.


After a moment, Alyssa managed to regain her composure and spoke hesitantly, "You... You're that country bumpkin?"


Reese raised an eyebrow nonchalantly. "Is there a problem?"


Alyssa found it somewhat amusing and even felt like she was dreaming, "How could you be Reese? Reese is dark-skinned with many blemishes on her face,and.she also..."


"And she wears black-framed glasses with thick bangs, right?" Reese helped her finish the rest of her sentence since it seemed difficult for her to speak.


Alyssa nodded absentmindedly, "Yes."


The woman in front of her was simply graceful and stunningly beautiful. Alyssa couldn't compare the ethereal beauty in front of her to the backwoods girl from a few days ago. They were incomparable. They were completely different people.


Reese was quite satisfied to see Alyssa's current dumbfounded expression. She looked somewhat like a fool. With a smile on her face, she exuded an air of confidence.


"Before, I just wanted to see what kind of people you all really are. It seems I wasn't far off with my expectations. You all judge people based on appearances." Now that she had revealed her true self, Alyssa was taken aback. She no longer acted aggressively or mocked herself. Alyssa was still trying to comprehend Reese's change, but Reese had no interest in playing along with her anymore.


"I have to treat Malcolm's legs, so I'll be going now."


Reese took the medicine kit and held the hem of her dress as she walked towards the room. It wasn't until the door closed that Alyssa slowly regained her composure.


Is this... still the same country bumpkin?


It felt like a completely different person. What is she playing at? Does she think she's in some sort of role-.play?


If it were someone else, they would have shown their best side. or at least not be ridiculed. However. this girl made herself look like a weirdo from the start.and now she transformed into a fairy, provoking jealousy, is that it? But, she does seem quite beautiful.If we're only talking about appearances, she and my brother really match.


When Reese returned to the room,Malcolm had just finished his phone call with Justin and saw Reese come in.


"Why did it take so long?"


"I was being held up by your sister," Reese said,taking out her usual clothes from the wardrobe and preparing to unzip her dress.


"Come here, I'll help you," Malcolm offered.


"No thanks," she replied. Being a dancer and practicing martial arts, her bones were even more Hexible than nnormal. Unzipping a dress was a trivial matter for her.

As Malcolm watched her smoothly unzip the dress, he felt that what he had said earlier was unnecessary.


Of course. Reese wouldn't undress in front of Malcolm.She took the dress with her to the bathroom, changed her clothes, and came out. Malcolm noticed that she had crumpled up the dress, causing his eyes to twitch,finding it somewhat amusing.


"Do you know how much this dress costs?"


"I don't know," Reese shook her head, showing no attachment to the dress as she hung it back in the closet. Throughout the process, she didn't display any sentimental emotions towards the expensive dress. .Malcolm was puzzled. Did she genuinely not know the price of this dress. or did she simply have no interest in luxury items?


"This dress is by a famous Italian designer. It's the only one of its kind in the world," Malcolm decided to let her know the price of the dress, which he had obtained through connections.
###Chapter 43 Will We Kiss?


After all, it was quite difficult for him to get his hands on it. Reese's reaction once again disappointed Malcolm.


"I already know. I've heard it from others."


Malcolm's lips tightened. "Then you should be more careful."


The woman deliberately keeps doing it, doesn't she?


"It's just a dress. I heard that in high society events like yours, formal attire can only be worn once. So for me, this dress is just an ornament. I can't wear it casually, and I can't wear it to any more parties."


Reese remained composed, as if she could remainunaffected even if someone placed gold and silver treasures in front of her.


Malcolm sighed and rubbed his forehead. What kind of treasure did he marry? She had a mind unlike anyone else, and she always liked to surprise him with new things.


Well, since he had given it to her, how she handled it was her own business.


"Are you going to massage the legs again today?"


"Yes, I'm going to soak them in an herbal bath and get a massage."


She had specifically consulted with a senior physician and found that Malcolm's legs could be treated. It was just a matter of finding the right method. At least he could already feel somesensation, which proved that it was effective.


The doctors there were also paying close attention to Malcolm's condition, as there weren't many cases of paralyzed individuals being cured.


Malcolm raised an eyebrow with a hint of interest in his eyes.


"Did you add any new treatments?"


Reese had just taken out the items when she heard his tone and couldn't help but find it amusing.


"Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?"


The first time Reese saw Malcolm; his room was pitch black, without a hint of light. It was enough to see that he had lost interest in life. But now, even though his legs hadn't fully recovered, his spirit had already made a significant comeback.


Malcolm's lips curved into an enticing smile.Reese had encountered many men, but there were few like him who were exceptional.


With just one smile, Reese felt her heart racing.


But his next words sent shivers down her spine..


He said, "It's all thanks to my wife taking good care of me."


Although these words sounded warm,Reese wasn't used to it.


She raised her hand and said, "Enough. We're only putting on a show of affection outside. There's no need to pretend here."


"But you can't deny that you are my wife now,"he stubbornly declared.


Seeing his domineering expression, Reese felt like she had no way of dealing with him.


That's fine, just ignore it.


After giving Malcolm an injection and helping him prepare the bath, Reese was sweating on her forehead by the time she finished all the tasks. Under the light,her skin looked crystal clear, displaying her original complexion.


This was her natural skin color.


Reese was about to stand up, but suddenly, Malcolm grabbed her wrist.


She looked at him curiously and accidentally fell into his deep gaze.


"What...What's wrong with you?"


"Honey, are you hiding something from me? Like, do you still have some other skills?"


Malcolm's words carried profound meaning,especially with his eyes fixed attentively on Reese.


She didn't plan to let even the slightest expression on her face go unnoticed. Reese's heart was pounding and she felt a bit flustered, but facing Malcolm's inquisitive gaze,she was afraid that she might lose her composure and reveal her emotions. Most likely, he was astonished by her dazzling appearance today, realizing that she didn't resemble a typical Backwoods girl. In addition,she had exposed some of her skills earlier, so it would be strange if Malcolm didn't suspect anything.


They were standing quite close to each other, and with the steam filling the bathroom,Reese could see the smooth movement of Malcolm's Adam's apple, creating an alluring line. Along with the scorching heat emanating from him, it enveloped her completely.


Reese's heart was racing, almost leaping out of her throat. A blush rose on her cheeks, making her appear even more charming and adorable.


Malcolm slowly approached her, his lips touching her ear as he spoke in a low and husky voice, "Can you kiss?" Reese quickly snapped back to reality,pushing Malcolm away in a fluster, and she stood up as well."Why would I have anything to do with you?"


Surprisingly, she felt shy.


Malcolm became even more interested and said, "If you don't know how, I can teach you,honey."


Reese had always been stubborn, a person who refused to give in. Seeing Malcolm's disdainful expression, she naturally couldn't back down. She suppressed the turmoil in her heart, lifted her face with clear and determined eyes.


"What's the big deal about a kiss? I can do it. Besides,I won't kiss you, I won't fall for that."


Reese opened the bathroom door, touching her rapidly beating chest. Finally, she let out a long breath and said to Malcolm inside. "Come out quickly. I'm tired."


She still had to give him a massage.


"You better dress me first," Malcolm reminded her with a hearty laugh.


Reese slapped her forehead, realizing her mind had been completely muddled by him. She had forgotten that his legs weren't healed yet, and he couldn't stand up.


But she also didn't want to go back in.


"I will go find two servants."


Malcolm sat in the bathtub, coughed lightly while trying to hold back his laughter, and replied with an affirming sound. When the servants supported Malcolm out,he suddenly felt a sensation in his legs. Although standing was still difficult, he was extremely thrilled.


If Reese had really healed him, he would be able to stand up and no longer rely on a wheelchair for the rest of his life.


The servants didn't notice the change on Malcolm's face, and they dared not look at him carelessly. After all,Master's presence was intimidating, and just supporting him alone was enough to instill fear in them. They were afraid of making mistakes and angering him.


After lying down, Reese approached with a natural expression and clearer eyes. She sat cross-legged on the edge of the bed, grasping his thigh with both hands and gradually exerting force. Atfirst,Malcolm couldn't feel anything, but as the massage continued,he could actually feel a tingling sensation. It meant that Reese's method was really effective.He didn't say anything and just let her slowly massage him. The little girl seemed to be quite skilled,just by looking at her technique, he could tell she was an expert.


Reese wondered why Malcolm didn't say anything.Just as she was about to ask him, she noticed that he had turned his face to the side, lost in thought. The light from above cast different shadows on his face,and the area under his eyes was shaded by his eyelashes. His iris was a lighter color, showing a hint of gentleness.


This person was actually pretty good. He always defended her openly or secretly. It was just that she didn't want to put all her hopes on one man. If he really changed in the future and treated her poorly,she would be the only one hurt. As she thought of this, the light in Reese's eyes dimmed, and her movements weakened noticeably. Malcolm was already sure that she was slowly gaining consciousness.
###Chapter 44 Reese Poisoning Malcolm
In the kitchen, Reese asked a servant to brew soup for Malcolm. Alyssa walked by at this moment and said."Can you take a look at why the flowers I planted died? I watered them just yesterday."


Sandra was a bit hesitant and said, "But I'm still brewing soup here. Can you wait?"


"I need those flowers for someone. It's my best friend's birthday in acouple of days, and I promised to give her this potted plant."


Alyssa forcefully dragged Sandra to the yard,and Sandra took a look.


"You might have watered them too much." "No. I didn't. They were perfectly fine yesterday.Besides, with this weather for the past two days,if I didn't water them, they would have died in no time."


Alyssa bent down and examined the flowers closely.


"Go to my room and bring some fertilizer. Let's give it a try. If it still doesn't revive in another two days, then I have no other options."


Sandra was not just a servant at home. She also took care of the Flynn family's plants and flowers. Alyssa got up and smiled, saying, "Alright, I'll go get it.Sandra, please continue to take a look."


Sandra was concerned about the soup in the kitchen and said, "Then please hurry."

Alyssa hurried towards the living room and passed by the kitchen, where she saw the soup on the stóve. She remembered what Reese had said to her earlier and couldn't help but sneer.


Just because she was beautiful, why didI she have the right to boss her around? Since she entered the Flynn family. Malcolm rarely spoke to her. Even when she asked him to accompany her, he would say he had no time. Yet, he spends his days with this annoying little girl.


As these thoughts filled her mind, her growing sense of injustice felt like an expanding balloon about to.burst. The anger in her eyes intensified.


Once Reese leaves the Flynn family, theirhousehold can revert to how it used to be.


Sandra waited outside for Alyssa for a while,but when she didn't come out, Sandra decided to check on Malcolm's soup in the kitchen. She entered the kitchen and saw that the water was about to boil dry, so she quickly turned off the stove and used a strainer to filter the residue of the soup into a bowl.


Alyssa came running down with fertilizer in her hands: "Sandra, where are you?"


"I'm here." Sandra came out of the kitchen carrying the soup. "You go ahead and spread the fertilizer,no need to water it. I need to bring this soup upstairs."


"Alright, now that you've explained it, I understand.You go do your thing."


Alyssa took the fertilizer and her gaze swept over the bowl of soup as she walked away.


Sandra approached the bedroom door and knocked on it. "Sir. I have finished preparing the soup."


"Come in," Reese's voice came from inside.


Sandra placed the soup on the bedside table,and Reese asked one more question.


"You've been guarding this soup, right?"


"Yes, no problem."


"Then please leave for now."

After Sandra left, Reese was about to bring the soup to Malcolm, but when she caught a smell of it,she hesitated. There was something off about the scent.


Malcolm noticed her unusual expression and asked,"Is there something wrong with the soup?" Reese couldn't be sure.


"In theory, there shouldn't be anything wrong, but I just have this feeling that something's not quite right How is your relationship with Sandra?"


"She has been with the Flynn family for a long time and has always been good to me. I don't think there should be a problem."


Besides, theperson who wants to harm him is not here. The Flynn family mansion only consisted of two sisters and their grandfather, and they wouldn't want to harm him.


Reese's tensed brows eased slightly upon hearing this."I must have been overly cautious. This soup is something I developed in the past few days, and it works both externally and internally." Seeing how much she cared and researched about his injured legs, Malcolm's gaze towards her became even gentler.


"Alright then, if I can really walk again, Honey, you've played a significant role. Do you need any rewards as my wife?"


Reese didn't need anything. She chuckled lightly,"What can you give me? I married into the Flynn family, and I don't have to worry about food or clothing. You even gave me a card before, so now I'm a wealthy woman."


Although she hadn't used a single penny from the card Malcolm gave her, it was better to accept and let him feel at ease, rather than letting him know she didn't need it and have him find other ways to give her money.
Malcolm took hold of her chin with his fingertips, a smile in his eyes. "Can I offer myself as a reward?"


Reese treated it as a joke. She self-deprecatingly said,"I dare not let you sacrifice yourself. Your family has two sisters, and I can't bear parting with them."


As soon as this matter was mentioned, a commotion could be heard outside, and the room door was forcefully pushed open, accompanied by a strong gust of wind. Reese frowned, a hint of displeasure passing through her eyes.


The people who came were not only Everly and Alyssa, but also Grandpa Flynn and Vincent. Vincent had just landed and returned to the Flynn family, yet he hadn't even had a chance to sit down before he heard Alyssa's scream from the kitchen.


As soon as Everly entered the room, she saw Reese holding soup in her hand, apparently preparing to feed it to Malcolm.


With a calm face, she quickly stepped forward and snatched the soup bowl from Reese's hand. A little splashed out, scalding Reese's hand, and her eyes were already filled with a storm.


"Miss Everly, is this your idea of manners?"


Everly stared at the bowl of soup and coldly snorted,"Reese, this time I want to see how you justify yourself. I have long said that she has sinister intentions and must have ulterior motives for coming to our house."


Reese disdainfully sneered, and her cold and deep gaze swept over Everly. Her tone was indifferent and calm, but it sent chills down Everly's back, freezing her triumphant expression. ."Then, Miss Everly, do tell, what do I gain from your family?"


Everly arrogantly lifted her face.


"Does that even need to be said? You and Malcolm are legally married now. If he dies unexpectedly, his property becomes yours. Everyone knows the company is under Malcolm's name."


The implication couldn't be any clearer.


Facing Everly's question, Reese showed no signs of panic on her face. Instead, she turned the tables and questioned Everly in return.


"You accuse me of plotting against Malcolm, but where is the evidence?" "The evidence is in this bowl of soup."


Reese suddenly realized why the aroma seemed so strange earlier. It turned out someone had added other substances to it.


She smirked, leisurely stood up, and walked in front of Everly.


"Then how can you be sure that there's poison in here? If Malcolm really dies, you won't let me go either. Am I that stupid?"


Malcolm sat on the bed, not intending to help Reese,as he wanted to see how she would handle her predicament.


If it was their first meeting,he might have kindly assisted her. However, after spending time together, he increasingly felt that this girl was no ordinary'person. In terms of both thinking and language, she was not inferior to anyone present.

Moreover, she always managed to surprise him. This time, he also wanted to see how she would resolve her own crisis in the face of so many people's questioning.


Everly pulled Alyssa over and said, "Alyssa, you tell them."


Alyssa said, "When I went to the kitchen just now, I found some leftover powder in the trash can. I picked it up and was wondering why Sandra's soup had that kind of colored powder. Just then, Vincent came back and I showed it to him. That's when I realized it was a poison. If someone consumes it, they will become disoriented and paralyzed, and their organs will fail within seven days, leading to death."


Upon hearing Alyssa's words, Grandpa Flynn, who had experienced many trials and tribulations.showed a fearful expression on his face.


"There is poison in this soup. Reese, are you trying to kill my grandson?"
###Chapter 45 A Moment of Understanding
Reese remained calm and composed. Even when confronted with Alyssa's testimony and evidence,she did not show any fear, and her gaze remained bright and clear.


"Even if there is poison, it has nothing to do with me."


Everly glanced at Reese sideways, her tone unfriendly.


"If you say it has nothing to do with you,then it doesn't. You were the one who collected this medicine and brought it from outside. If it wasn't you, then it must have been Sandra."


Sandra, who had just been brought in by Mr. Tartt, rushed in to explain..


"Miss Everly, Miss Alyssa, this really has nothing to do with me. I only followed Madam's orders to make medicine for the Master. I didn't add anything to it.Miss Alyssa can vouch for me. When she came into the kitchen earlier, I was still making the medicine,and she was there watching."

If Sandra were to be accused of trying to harm the Master, she would end up in prison. She had dependents and couldn't afford such a thing to happen.


Alyssa shrugged, looking like she was watching a play.


"Well, it's either you or Reese."


Reese remained composed and had already caught on to the clues from their conversation. But before clarifying everything.she needed to ask Malcolm a question.


Reese turned her gaze towards the man lying calmly on the bed.


"Malcolm, do you believe me?"


Malcolm stared at her, his fair face devoid of any expression of fear, displaying confidence as if victory was assured.


Afterward, he curved his lips and gave a devilish smile.


"Of course, I believe you."


Reese inexplicably felt relieved in her heart.She wasn't afraid of false accusations from others, but rather afraid that the person she needed wouldn't believe her.


But now, with Malcolm's words,she had the courage to confront everyone in this room.


Perhaps,besides Malcolm, no one else wanted her to stay in the Flynn family.


But she wasn't someone to be toyed with. If someone insisted on framing her unjustly, they shouldn't blame her for disregarding their feelings.


She stood tall and straight, her gaze bright. She didn't look like someone who had malicious intentions.


Despite not fully understanding Reese's words, She still didn't want to miss this opportunity. So, she vaguely replied, "If it's not Sandra, then it must be you. You were the one who brought the medicine for Malcolm, so you have the highest suspicion Reese already knew who had poisoned Malcolm. but Alyssa had no solid evidence or preparedness to bring her down. Thus, when faced with questioning, she became flustered and responded with a flurry of words.


"The highest suspicion on me? Do you have any evidence? Without witnesses or physical evidence, you have no way to accuse me of wanting to harm Malcolm. However, I have evidence that proves you are the one who poisoned him."


Reese, with her sharp, gleaming eyes fixed on Alyssa,made her increasingly nervous. It was as if Reese could see right through her, peering into her thoughts.Though Alyssa was only in her twenties,she couldn't understand why Reese possessed such piercing gaze,reminiscent of when her brother was angry.

Before Alyssa couId defend herself, Everly couldn't restrain herself any longer and yelled at Reese, "Reese, stop talking nonsense! Judging from what you imply.you seem to be suggesting that the culprit is among us. Don't forget that everyone present, besides you, is Malcolm's family. Why would we harm him?"


Reese didn't even look at Everly with her sharp eyes,but rather straight at Alyssa.


Alyssa's heart raced even faster, and her face turned pale. If this continued, she was afraid she wouldn't be able tohold herself together, even without taking any action.


She had underestimated this girl. She thought Reese was just an insignificant person, but who knew that her eyes alone could be so intimidating? It was on par with Malcolm. Whenever Malcolm glared at her, even before he spoke, she felt chills running down her spine. In the entire room, only Reese's voice remained,without any diminishing of her resolve. On the contrary, it grew more confident.


"In fact, you never intended to harm him. You just wanted to frame me. You calculated the timing perectly, coming in to stop me before I could feed him the medicine, just like you did now."


Malcolm, with a strained neck, defended himself, "Do you have any evidence to support what you're saying?"


"Proof? That's simple. The packaging you had just now was probably bought from a pharmacy, and it probably wasn't obtained through proper channels.Would you like me to give you the specific address?"

Alyssa furrowed her brows, her heartbeat skipped a beat. How did this girl know where she bought her medicine?


Reese was skilled at observing the subtle expressions on others' faces. And Alyssa's reaction didn't go unnoticed.


At this moment, the fear on her face was already quite obvious. She just needed a little more push to expose her true colors.


How could Everly not know that it was Alyssa's doing? Reese didn't seem that foolish, but since Alyssa wanted to bring down Reese, she naturally had to help.


"Reese, don't think we'll believe you.Maybe you bought this medicine yourself from the pharmacy.Otherwise, how could you possibly know where it came from, based on just the packaging paper?" Alyssa, catching Everly's intention, nodded along.


"That's right, this medicine clearly was bought by you.You're trying to frame me, but I don't even know which pharmacy to go to."


"Then are you brave enough to go to the pharmacist with me to confirm? If they say they haven't seen you before, I'll drink this bowl of medicine."


Alyssa couldn't help but widen her eyes.


Is this girl crazy? Playing such a dangerous game,this medicine looks like it might be truly poisonous.


Reese was resolute, while Alyssa seemed a bit guilty,her face turning extremely unpleasant. 


Even if Grandpa Flynn couldn't fully understand, he knew Alyssa, and she clearly felt guilty.

With Reese pressing on step by step, capturing every detail without giving Alyssa any chance to argue back.


Vincent stood at the back, but he was the tallest and most conspicuous. Despite being outnumbered, he emitted an intimidating aura that no one dared to provoke.


Especially his eyes, laden with so much world-weariness, instead giving off a sense of composure. His logical thinking was meticulous, with no flaws visible.He captured every detail ruthlessly, and the outcome of this contest was already apparent.


The fact that she could determine which pharmacy the medicine came from just by its packaging showed that she was not ordinary. Alyssa had told him on the phone before that Malcolm's legs regained feeling, and it seemed to be related to the girl in front of him.


It seemed they needed to send someone to investigate her background thoroughly, to decide whether to keep her or get rid of her. They needed to think it through carefully.


Just as the tension became unbearable, Malcolm suddenly spoke from the bed.


"Alyssa, apologize to your sister-in-law now.There's still time."


Reese turned around, looking meaningfully at Malcolm. Now she understood why he spoke up to help her. It was like watching a play. This man was confident that he could resolve the situation.


His scheming and strategy were not simple at all. Alyssa. unexpectedly caled out by Malcolm. flashed a hint of panic and embarrassment on her face.


"Why should I apologize to her? I didn't buy the medicine."


Malcolm furrowed his brows, his eyes as cold as an icy abyss, causing Alyssa to shrink her neck and dare not say another word.

What kind of expressions did these two give? Did they want to scare her to death in order to feel at ease?


Grandpa Flynn had also seen through everything. It turns out that this was all a plan.


Alyssa staged the whole thing and nearly fooled them all.
###Chapter 46 Apologize to Your Sister-in-law!
However, Grandpa Flynn,always protective of his granddaughter and thinking that Alyssa didn't truly intend to harm Malcolm, began to mediate.


"Well, since it's a misunderstanding,let's just forget about it,Alyssa. I must say, jokes like this shouldn't be made. Reese is already married to Malcolm and she is your sister-in-law. It's one thing to not show respect,but you must never do something like this again in the future."


Grandpa Flynn's tone seemed reproachful, but Reese could tell that it was all an act meant to appease her.He didn't genuinely intend to seek justice on her behalf.


In the eyes of the Flynn family, she was insignificantJacking in a prestigious background, and merely a bride who had been married into the family. Naturally.she wasn't favored. and Grandpa Flynn wouldn't really care.


No one would pay attention to her feelings.


Alyssa pouted and her previously tense expression Yinally relaxed.


"Alright, Grandpa, I won't make jokes like this again.I'll go back to my room now."


Grandpa Flynn nodded.


Alyssa happily lifted her foot, ready to make a quick escape. However, Malcolm spoke up again, his voice this time not as calm as before but filled with anger. The temperature in the entire room suddenly dropped.and even Reese, standing next to him, felt a chill and subconsciously hugged herself.


"Alyssa,stop!"


As Alyssa's right foot was about to step over the threshold, she heard Malcolm's voice and instinctively retracted it, turning around somewhat awkwardly.


With a trace of fear in her eyes, she cautiously asked,"Do you have something else to say?"


"You ignored what I just said?"


The way Malcolm looked at Alyssa seemed as though he was staring daggers, emitting a frigid light. Alyssa even felt beads of cold sweat rolling down her cheeks. "What... what did you say just now?"


"Apologize to your sister-in-law!" His tone was clearly impatient.


Alyssa rarely saw Malcolm push her this way for someone else. Coupled with his imposing presence and that look in his eyes, as if he could devour her any moment, her nose tingled, and tears streamed down her face.


Shouting at the top of her lungs, she exclaimed, "Why should I apologize to her? She doesn't deserve you in the first place!"


"You're not allowed to say such things anymore. Now that she's married to me, she is my wife. Whoever intends to bully her should consider the consequences beforehand." His voice sounded calm but carried an intensity that left everyone in the room breathless.


Grandpa Flynn understood Malcolm's temper,but he never expected him to be so protective of Reese.However. if Alyssa doesn't lower her head, it seemed like there was no way to turn the situation around.


He said to Alyssa, "Alyssa, apologize to Reese. We're all family, she won't blame you."


Alyssa pouted while holding Grandpa Flynn's hand,"Grandpa..."


Grandpa Flynn's gaze at Alyssa turned serious for a few seconds, almost like a warning as he said, "Listen,you know Malcolm's temper."

If things didn't go his way today, this matter would never end. Alyssa also feared Malcolm. When he wasn't angry, he emitted an aloofness that kept everyone at a distance. If he were to get mad now,she doubted she could handle it.


Everly, seeing Malcolm defend Reese in this manner,felt a deep resentment in her heart. But there was nothing she could do. He was used to being dominant,and even Grandpa couldn't do anything about it if Malcolm set his mind on something.


If Alyssa insisted on not apologizing to Reese,she would certainly suffer today.


Everly lightly touched Alyssa and suggested,"Alyssa,it's okay to say sorry to your own family. After all, you didn't mean it, it wasn't intentional."


Alyssa glanced back at Everly and instantly understood what she meant. She could only nod, "I'm sorry." Malcolm didn't let it go and sternly said, "Call her sister-in-law."


Alyssa bit her lip, feeling a surge of humiliation rising from within. Her voice instantly trembled with a hint of tears, "Is this how you force your own sister to do something for the sake of an outsider?"


At this moment, Vincent behind them spoke up,seemingly wanting to mediate and also find out more about Reese.


"Reese definitely won't hold it against you. Malcolm is just like this. Reese is usually the one who advises and calms him down. We're all family,why force each other like this?"


Reese followed his gaze and noticed the man standing behind Everly. He wore gold-rimmed glasses, a khaki long coat, tall stature, and a refreshing aura,attracting attention wherever he went. His facial features were delicate, with smooth lines, and his eyes revealed a hint of darkness. As she looked into his ink-black pupils. Reese felt like she was falling into a whirlpool.but she quickly snapped out of it. Though her tone remained firm, she chose to stick to her principles.


"I suppose you must be Mr. Vincent, the physician who has been practicing medicine abroad. If this medicine really was poisoned by me and if Malcolm did end up drinking it, would you all just let it end with an apology?"


At that time, she might really be taken to the police station, and it would be best if they could come up with another charge to get rid of her. Vincent narrowed his eyes slightly, his gaze at Reese holding some deep meaning. This girl was indeed not ordinary, and her appearance was also outstanding.


The pairing with Malcolm, there's nothing wróng with it. But he didn't care about whether these two are a good match or not. The key point for him is the girl's background. Everly said she was from the Brooks family in Backwoods. How could she be so insightful?He just doesn't believe it.


Alyssa had underestimated Reese. She knew that if she continues to argue with her, Malcolm might really turn against her. This time, Alyssa was obviously not as reluctant as before, and her attitude was relatively sincere.


"Sister-in-law, I'm sorry."


Although Reese doesn't want to argue with her anymore, compared to Everly, she was more straightforward.


"Even if you don't like me and kick me out of the Flynn family, do you think Grandpa won't find Malcolm another one? When that happens, you'll still have to fight with her. I'm a simple person. If you don't provoke me. I won't even touch you. But if you play these tricks behind my back, don't blame me for fighting back."


Reese exuded an imposing aura and her words carried weight, stunning everyone present. Malcolm,lying on the bed, flashed a smile in his eyes. He not only didn't find her hot-tempered, but also anticipated that interesting things might happen in this family in the future. He was worried before that Vincent might plot against her, but now it seems that it's anyone's game.


Alyssa was completely subdued by Reese's imposing aura, even more wary of her than before. Grandpa Flynn was tired after being here for a while, and he had something to discuss with Malcolm. He spoke up "Let's end this matter. Everyone, disperse."


Everyone left the room, and Reese remained standing inside. Grandpa Flynn spoke to her. "'Reese, can you excuse us for a minute? I have something to discuss with Malcolm."


"Okay." Reese closed the door for them as she left..
###Chapter 47 Let me handle it


In the room,only Malcolm and Grandpa Flynn were left. Grandpa Flynn's serious expression had slightly eased, and he walked up to Malcolm's bed.


"What were you doing just now? Reese is just a marriage replacement. If it weren't for our engagement with their family, do you think she, with her background, could marry you? Alyssa is your own sister, and yet you sided with Reese instead of her."


He still remembered very well Malcolm's intense reaction when he told him that he wanted to marry someone.


Malcolm raised an eyebrow and asked Grandpa Flynn in return, "So,according to Grandpa, are you saying we should have let Alyssa falsely accuse Reese and then call the police to take her to the station? Don't forget. Grandma was an intellectual. If news of us bullying one person spreads, it won't look good."


"Wouldn't it leave us ashamed?"


This question immediately left Grandpa Flynn speechless, his face showing a hint of embarrassment.


But when facing his grandson, he had to be more relaxed than with outsiders.


"I didn't mean it that way, but Reese is not worthy of you. When she entered the house,she directly confronted Everly and Alyssa. Is this how a daughter-in-law should behave? With her background,she should be humble and submissive. Why does she act as if she owns the place?"


Malcolm's expression turned serious his dark eyes seemingly ice-cold. "Grandpa, now that she has married me, she is my wife and a part of the Flynn famly. I hope you can treat her fairly. If you're unwilling to, I'll make sure justice is served."


How could Grandpa Flynn not understand this statement? It was clearly a pledge of allegiance.


Grandpa Flynn's face turned ashen with rage,
"Malcolm,why are you sidng with an outsider?"


"She is my wife! How can you call her an outsider?"


Malcolm's words resonated with conviction,seemingly proud of his stance.


Grandpa Flynn was so furious that he couldn't find words to retort, "You... are really trying to drive me to my grave." ."Grandpa, since our families have a marriage agreement with the Brooks family,we should treat others well, at the very least be fair. Moreover.when she goes out, she represents my image. If she is mistreated in the Flynn family, will she still uphold our family's dignity in the future?"


His argument was logical and supported, leaving Grandpa Flynn unable to come up with a counterargument.


He was only amazed as to why Malcolm suddenly stood up for Reese like this. It had been less than a month, yet he was defending her so fiercely.


Grandpa Flynn changed the subject, focusing on his own legs, "How have your legs been lately? Is her method effective?"


"Well, recently I've been able to feel some sensation in 
my legs."


He didn't tell Grandpa that he had just tried to move them a bit, and it seemed to have worked. However.after being paralyzed for such a long time,he still needed to get used to it.

Grandpa Flynn was overjoyed to hear this, "Vincent is outside, let him come in and take a look at your legs."


"No need, Grandpa."


"Vincent, come in and check Malcolm's legs."


He intended to refuse, but Grandpa moved too quickly and was already at the door, calling Vincent.


Vincent heard Grandpa Flynn's voice and walked in, a bright smile appearing on his handsome face. "Has Malcolm's legs shown any signsof improvement?Let me have a look."

With that, he stood up and was about to approach,but Malcolm evaded his touch, their eyes meeting.


Malcolm's eyes were very cold, while Vincent seemed to hide everything in his heart, but his gaze was complex and ever-changing.


The atmosphere in the room was oppressive and dull.


After a moment, Vincent spoke with a friendly smile on his face, calling affectionately.


"What's wrong Malcolm? Let me see if there's any improvement."


"No need." Malcolm's voice was icy, emanating a chilling aura that kepot people at a distance. Especially his eyes, captivating and few could withstand such a gaze with composure.


But Vincent insisted, his hand ready to reach out and hold Malcolm's wrist, but Malcolm swiftly turned around, and his hand grasped at thin air.


A hint of gunpowder seemed to linger in the air.


The eyes behind Vincent's gold-rimmed glasses flickered, his lips curved in a seemingly ironic smile.


"What's wrong with you, Malcolm? At least let me know the situation. In case there's a mistake, won't that make you happy for nothing?"、


Grandpa Flynn had no idea that these two brothers had already clashed in secret, and he kept persuading Malcolm. "Malcolm. although Reese's methods are effective, it's always good to have another person take a look. In case Vincent comes up with something that can help you recover more quickly, wouldn't that be better?"


Malcolm stared at Vincent standing beside him, his face expressionless and devoid of any emotion,showing no respect.


"No need, Grandpa. I trust Reese. Vincent has treated me for so long, but my legs didn't improve. It just shows that Vincent's medical skills still have room for improvement."


Vincent shrugged and sneered, "Is Malcolm questioning my medical skills now?"


"The facts speak for themselves. You just came back,and you're definitely tired. Go rest. From now on,Reese will be in charge of my condition." Malcolm used a combination of soft and hard persuasion, and Vincent couldn't find any loopholes.


Even if he wanted to investigate Malcolm's condition today, it wouldn't be easy. Malcolm made it clear that he was wary of him, or perhaps that girl named Reése had said something to him.


"That's fine too. With my sister-in-law here, I feel relieved. Malcolm, rest up. I'm leaving," Vincent finished speaking; he opened the door and left.


He saw a servant and specifically asked, "Where is Mrs.Flynn?"


"I think she went to the backyard."


Vincent went downstairs and directly headed towards the backyard.
Reese was squatting on the ground,examining if there were any suitable places to plant some herbs. She had initially studied medicinal plants because she found it fascinating. Although the effects were slow, they were beneficial for the body.


The medicines Mlalcolm had used before had caused significant damage to his body, so she wanted to restore the condition of his body.


She didn't have much to do, so she grew some plants here,which were both fresh and convenient.


Suddenly,she felt someone behind her. Her eyes sharpened, and she turned around, only to see Vincent standing behind her. A faint smile adorned his handsome face, and his tall figure was impressive.However,Reese didn't feel comfortable but instead sensed something hidden in his gaze. Vincent was Malcolm's second brother, who had been practicing medicine outside for a long time, So, does that mean he was the one in charge of Malcolm's leg before?


Could it be that the medications she found against him were administered by this man in front of her?


How dare he treat her husband like this? Reese's eyebrows furrowed.


Vincent quickly assessed her from head to toe. He had a refined appearance and a fresh and elegant charm.especially his fair skin, which seemed as if it could almost exude mist.


"It seems Malcolm has married such a beautiful wife..Not only are you beautiful, but your medical skills are also superb." The latter sentence was somewhat cryptic.but Reese couldn't help but understand his meaning.


She remained calm and unchanged in her expression.


"I apologize for any misunderstanding."


"I am curious, though. You know so much, even more than someone like me who has studied abroad since childhood. Now, Malcolm doesn't even let me treat him anymore."
###Chapter 48 She isn't some big shot,Is she?
Reese smiled lightly. "Everyone has their own methods. If there are too many people, it's actually difficult to make decisions. Since he is gradually improving now, you don't have to worry."


"With your remarkable medical skills, I am sure I'm not needed. It's just that Malcolm, as a person,is reserved and somewhat cold. Please forgive him if his words make you uncomfortable."


Vincent gave the impression of a modest and caring gentleman. His way of speaking was also mild, which indeed contrasted greatly with Malcolm's personality.


However, they hadn't seen the tender side hidden within Malcolm, which could make one drown in it with just one look. Like today, facing so many people from the Flynn family. he still stood up for his wife. This touched her.


For so many years, besides her grandmother, no one had fought for her dignity and innocence.


Suddenly, someone stood up and spoke up for her,regardless of everything, and her icy heart seemed to warm up.


She raised her head, looking proud as she said,"A husband and wife are one. Besides,my beloved husband is very good to me. Yesterday, at the banquet,he bought me a dress designed by an Italian designer,the only one in the world. He would never say anything hurtful to me."


Reese said this with great certainty.


Vincent was genuinely stunned, especially by the overwhelming sense of happiness displayed on Reese's face. They hadn't been married for long,according to what Everly said, and Malcolm wasn't very fond of this girl before.


How did things suddenly change? They looked like a loving couple.


He forced a smile, tugging at the corners of his mouth."I'm relieved to see that you and Malcolm get along so well. I'll leave Malcolm's matters to you from now on."


"Of course, of course," Reese mimicked his fake sincerity. It was all just acting and who couldn't do that?


At that moment, Vincent's assistant, Darwin,
approached and whispered something in his ear.


Vincent's eyes dimmed for a brief moment,then he politely addressed Reese in front of him.


"Tll take my leave then. I have something to attend to in my room."


"Take care."


As Vincent walked away, the smile vanished from Reese's face, replaced by a disdainful snort.


"Don't think I can't see through your little scheme,"she scoffed.


He just wanted to fish information out of her, probe her secrets. If she was really that easy to expose,would she still be alive and marrying into the Flynn family?


Vincent and Darwin returned to the room and locked the door behind them.


"Did you find anything?"


"I did, but this woman's information was not easy to dig up. I had to go through several channels to find even a little bit."


Darwin handed the information to Vincent, who glanced at it briefly.


The earlier part was a simple resume, stating that she had been studying at a certain school since the age of 15, but it didn't specify the location.


Vincent didn't bother looking at the rest. He simply took out a lighter, burned the papers, and threw them into the ashtray. Darwin was puzzled as he asked, "Could it be that we're overthinking it? Maybe she's just an ordinary person, coming from backwoods with no special skills."


Vincent's eyes turned icy. "If she really hadno skills,could she make Malcolm, who was paralyzed,almost stand up again?"


Surprised, Darwin asked, "How is that possible? Mr.Vincent, weren't you always giving Master medication that should have worsened his condition over time?"


"That's why I find this woman suspicious. Just now, in Malcolm's room, she was able to determine the pharmacy from a medication package, and if it hadn't been for my foolish sister, she would have revealed the batch number as well. I even doubt she can recite every single word written on the package." This time, the Flynn family had married an extraordinary daughter-in-law. They couldn't even find her true identity, let alone know of her abilities.


Darwin emptied the burning ashes from the ashtray into the toilet and flushed it before returning.


"What should we do now? This woman has ruined your plan, and we can't proceed as originally planned."


"Continue investigating. We must find out everything about this woman's background for me." Otherwise,she might become their downfall.


"T'll go and find someone to continue the investigation," Darwin said without delay,hastily opening the door and leaving.


Before Reese went back to her room from the backyard, she made a phone call to Calvin, who was busy at the moment.


"What can I do for you?" Calvin asked.


"I need you to check Alyssa's whereabouts these past couple of days, especially when she went to the pharmacy. Make sure to investigate thoroughly and send the information to my phone, down to the exact time," Reese instructed.


Calvin didn't understand and asked, "What's the purpose of this investigation?"


"It's important. HIurry up and do it," Reese replied.


"Alright, I haven't even finished this game yet."


Reese ended the call and headed towards her room. Just as she was about to go up the stairs, Calvin sent a message.


After reading the message, Reese deleted it and a cunning smile flashed across her eyes.


Passing by Everly's room, she happened to overhear Alyssa complaining to Everly.


"That girl really knows how to hide her true colors.Despite being so good-looking,she deliberately disguises herself to deceive us. You should have seen her face today, it almost knocked me unconscious. It's on a goddess level."


Although Alyssa genuinely disliked Reese, she couldn't help but admit that among them, Reese had one of the highest levels of attractiveness which even rare in entire Atlanta. She rarely came across anyone with the elegant demeanor as Reese's. She looked at Everly and asked, "What kind of skincare products is she using? Or is it natural? How could she be so fair? Did you not notice how her whole body practically glows?"


However, Everly didn't seem to care about these things. Her expression was serious, and her eyes were sharp.


"Don't you think Reese is suspicious?" Everly asked.


Alyssa touched her chin. "Is it because she's too beautiful?"


Everly gave Alyssa a speechless look and mocked,"Are you stupid? Of course, it's because of her identty.It was said that she was raised in the Backwoods since she was little. For so many years, her father never showed any care towards her. Her life couldn't have been easy in Backwoods. Haven't you heard about Backwoods? People work tirelessly there every day.Can hard labor give you such flawless skin?"


She continued: "And wasn't it said that she never studied anything? Even if she did, she wouldn't have such extensive knowledge in the medical field. Just by looking at the packaging, she could figure out where your medicine was bought from."


Alyssa suddenly remembered. "Right, this girl is quite skilled. Could she be someone important?"


"I'm not someone important, and there's no need for you to speculate so hard here," Reese interrupted.


Suddenly, Reese pushed open the door and confidently walked in, without a hint of embarrassment or guilt for eavesdropping outside the door.


It startled Alyssa and Everly. Alyssa didn't know why she felt so nervous and shouted at Reese, "Who gave you the right to barge into someone's room? Didn't your parents teach you any manners?"


"Square,huh?"
###Chapter 49 Just Attention-Seeking
Everly pulled Alyssa's hand down and pointed at Reese.


"Okay, you say she's resourceful, but she doesn't even have basic manners. You're deluding yourself if you think she is anyone important."


Reese didn't bother with Everly, not considering her at all.She disdainfully rolled her eyes and shifted her,gaze back to Alyssa.


This small action infuriated Everly, distorting her face adorned with delicate makeup. She tightly gripped Alyssa's arm with her fingers.


"What was that look just now?" .Was she looking down on herself? Who does she think she is? Even if she's Miss Everly, she's way more noble compared to someone with no background like her.


Reese completely ignored Everly's words and spoke directly to Alyssa.

"Aren't you curious how I could tell which pharmacy you bought the medicine from just by the packaging?"


Alyssa nodded. "Yes, tell me."


"You bought this medicine at noon today, around twelve fifty, right?"


Upon hearing Reese's response, Alyssa suddenly realized,exclaiming, "You've been following me!" ."What do you mean following? It just so happened that I saw you there today. Otherwise, how would I know you were there?"


Reese spoke nonchalantly, but it made Alyssa's face turn red, displaying a near frantic appearance.


"You...you clearly saw me, yet you stood by and watched me fall into your trap, Reese, you're so scheming! Malcolm's marriage to you is a disaster."


Even though this woman clearly saw her purchasing at the pharmacy, she didn't say anything and watched as she embarrassed herself in front of so many people today.


If she weren't physically weaker, she would have wanted to punch her.


Reese wasn't angered at all, and instead smirkéd, seemingly in a great mood.


"I am Malcolm's lucky star. Otherwise, those legs of his would probably be crippled for life. But for you, it seems like a disaster."


Alyssa gritted her teeth, her eyes fixedly glaring at Reese, unable to do anything else.


Normally, as the spoiled daughter of the Flynn family,she was domineering and powerful. She didn't expect to encounter an opponent outside and even at home.

The problem was, she couldn't physically beat her, and even with words alone, she couldn't out-argue her.


Compared to Alyssa, Everly remained much more composed. She earnestly looked at Reese. "Now that you know Alyssa bought medicine at the pharmacy, why did you have to let her embarrass herself in front of so many people earlier, Reese?What is your intention?"


Reese found it hard to understand how they could say such things. She raised her eyebrows with a hint of cold laughter, counter-questioning Everly.


"What about Alyssa? What is she up to? If I hadn't accidentally seen her buying this medicine, letting her falsely accuse me, you would've definitely handed me over to the police. I would have not only faced divorce with Malcolm but also a lawsuit. My whole life would've been ruined because of this. Have you ever thought about that? Since none of you consider me,accusing me at will based on your mood, why should I give her this meaningless dignity?"


Every word she said was heartfelt. Alyssa and Everly stood still, feeling like being scolded by a teacher, unable to rebut.


Alyssa, with a sulky face, surprisingly felt a twinge of guilt as Reese spoke. She had indeed not considered the consequences of her actions; she merely wanted to teach Reese a lesson.


She didn't like anyone competing for her brother's Yove.


Though unwilling, Alyssa reluctantly spoke up, "Im sorry. I didn't think it through this time. I didn't actually want you to go to the police station. I just didn't want you to get too close to Malcolm."


Before Reese arrived, she was the princess of the Flynn family, everyone doted on her and indulged her.

Ever since this annoying girl came, her love and her brother were snatched away. And what she couldn't tolerate the most was how this useless girl could be so arrogant in her own house.


This was clearly her territory, right?


The reason Reese didn't hold Alyssa accountable was that she could tell Alyssa wasn't malicious,just attention-seeking and possessive.


Like a child who doesn't want to share love with others.


But seeing Everly next to her, Reese's gaze split into bone-chilling coldness, realizing that Everly was not as simple as Alyssa. Everly had more cunning in her schemes.


Reese walked up to Everly, her imposing presence suddenly manifesting. Even though Everly was already shorter than Reese by a foot, she inexplicably felt a surge of fear. Why would a regular person like Reese emit such a strong aura?


Was it her own cowardice or was this Reese in front of her not an ordinary person? Was the information they gathered about her incorrect?


Reese could see her unease and a clear flicker of panic in her eyes.


"Well, Miss Everly, you knew very well that Alyssa was the one who drugged the medicine, and you also knew that she wouldn't succeed. Yet, you encouraged her to continue making mistakes."


Everly stubbornly retorted, "You're talking nonsense."


"Whether I'm talking nonsense or not, you know it in your heart. It's better to restrain these thoughts of framing me, or else you will only end up harming yourselves."


This was Reese's final warning to the two of them.After that,she left.


Unaware of what had just happened, the room gradually became colder after her departure,and Everly regained her senses.


"Where's Reese?"


Alyssa shook her head, her face full of confusion.
"How would I know? Let's go. Reese really scared me just now. Did you see that look in her eyes?"


Just the thought sent a shiver down Everly's spine.
Such a sharp gaze. She had thought that the only person she would fear in her entire life was Malcolm,and Vincent didn't scare her either. But today,she was actually frightened by a girl of a similar age. Everly stood silently, not saying anything. If everything before was considered coincidental,then what was the meaning behind the coldness she felt just now? Despite being around the same age,their personalities were so different, as if they were from different worlds.


Alyssa chatted with Everly for a while,but she remained silent. When Alyssa turned her head,she noticed that Everly was standing there like a statue,motionless.


"Everly, what's wrong? Did it scare you?"


Everly collected herself and spoke, "Nothing, I just feel like she's different from us."


Alyssa pouted. She was still angry about how Reese had scolded her earlier. Not even her grandfather had spoken to her like that. Who did that girl think she was?


The next day, Reese sat on a dining chair while the servant brought in the food. Reese grabbed a sandwich and started eating without even letting the servant stop her.


"Mrs. Flynn..." the servant began.


Reese had already devoured almost half of the sandwich and then looked up at her."What is it?"
###Chapter 50 Giving Honey a little treat
"We have a rule in our house that if the elders are not present, the younger ones cannot eat without permission."


Before the servant had a chance to explain, Vincent,who had come downstairs,interrupted.


Reese raised her gaze slightly, her eyes showing a faint sharpness. Vincent could tell that this girl was hostile towards him,probably because of his paralyzed brother,Malcolm.


He didn't expect the little girl to stand up for herself.

Reese didn't pause with her fork; she continued to stuff food into her mouth, her cheeks bulging as she muttered, "But I'm so hungry. I'll be late and get fined if I wait."


Vincent was taken aback, as it had been a long time since he had heard someone mention fines for being late. They weren't short of money.


Hearing such words from someone else's mouth suddenly made him want to laugh.


If she really had a different identity, why would she worry about money? She didn't even need to go to the company. The amount of money the company gave wouldn't even be enough for a girl to buy a piece of clothing.


"Even if you'll be fined for being late, in the Flynn family, rules still matter, Reese!" Suddenly, a dignified voice echoed from the staircase. Interrupting his thoughts, Vincent respectfully called out, "Grandpa!"


Grandpa Flynn came downstairs and sat on the dining chair, his expression stern. The servants quickly retreated to the side, and a suffocating atmosphere filled the living room.


Reese, holding a sandwich and taking a bite, put it down again upon seeing Grandpa Flynn's serious face.


"Well, I'll leave then," she awkwardly stood up,just as she turned around, she heard Grandpa Flynn speak again.


"Wasting food is disgraceful, Reese, you should understand this principle."


Reese's eye twitched a little. To eat or not to eat,to sit or not to sit, there were too many rules in this prestigious family.


Everly came downstairs and snorted, "Backwoods people have no manners, they don't even understand this much. Looks like Mr. Tartt should teach you some manners."


Reese could accept Grandpa Flynn criticizing her,but she couldn't accept someone younger than her speaking to her in such a manner.


Her clear, cold gaze conveyed her displeasure to Everly.


"Miss Alyssa, if I knew everything like you do, having lived under such good conditions since childhood,would you still dare to speak to me like this?" Reese's words were always capable of choking people.


Everly had just applied exquisite makeup, but at this moment, a restlessness emerged on her beautiful face that was uncharacteristic of her social status.


She growled lowly, "Reese,with Grandpa present,how dare you be so unruly."


However, Reese remained calm and composed,with no trace of fear in her eyres.


"I'm just speaking the truth. Does the Flynn family not allow people to speak the truth anymore?"


If Everly dared to nag at her again, Reese was certain that she could say something that would make Miss Alyssa pale in comparison.


Grandpa Flynn listened to the banter between the two,growing increasingly irritated. But Reese was prickly all over, and as a new daughter-in-law, how could she be allowed to be so defiant?He instructed Jason, who was nearby,"Mr. Tartt,starting from tomorrow, take some time to properly teach Mrs. Flynn some manners. Otherwise,she will become a laughingstock when she goes out."


It was clear that he scorned Reese.


Everly smiled triumphantly, provoking Reese with a gaze that seemed to say, "I may not be able to tame you,but there are plenty of people who can."


Reese dared not argue with Grandpa Flynn's words anymore.


But she didn't realize that she had willingly married into this family. If she didn't want to, no one could force her.


Having grown accustomed to freedom and disliking these strict rules, it was impossible for her to let Jason teach her manners.


Vincent crossed his arms, looking calmly at Reese. The more he looked at this young woman, the more likable she became.


Strange, although no one was on her side, if it were anyone else, they would probably feel isolated and cry in grievance.


But she was different, with bright and spirited eyes,and a cool temperament. Just by standing there,she caught everyone's attention.


Malcolm was truly lucky. Despite his setback, he managed to marry such a unique girl.


Reese raised her eyebrows, showing a meek and respectful attitude towards Grandpa Flynn. "Grandpa, I'm just a wild girl. It's not necessary for you to use Mr. Tartt to teach me. Even if he does, I'm afraid it wilI only further compromise the dignity of the Flynn family when I am outside. I cannot bear this responsibility."


With her words, she made it clear that she didn't care about the title of Mrs. Flynn. Whether Malcolm takes hèr out or not, it didn't matter. If Grandpa Flynn really wanted Jason to teach her manners, it would be redundant since in case she causes trouble outside, it will still be the responsibility of the Flynn family to resolve it.


Grandpa Flynn heard her and the previous anger in him diminished. He stroked his beard filled with whiskers.


"Well, since that's the case, we can spare Mr. Tartt.However, there are still some rules in the house that you need to know. In case there are guests in the futuare, you shouldn't avoid them. Let Mr. Tartt give you a brief explanation."


Reese curled her lip and agreed, "Alright, Grandpa."


Upstairs, Malcolm's profound and exquisite eyes captured the entire scene.


Malcolm realized that he liked this girl even more. She was intelligent and beautiful, and now that she revealed her true self, her face became even more pleasing to the eye.


He smiled in satisfaction. This wife of his was really satisfying.


Justin, standing off to the side, happened to witness Malcolm's smile and was suddenly shocked, as if he had seen a ghost. Mr. Flynn actually smiled? How satisfied must he be with his wife?
"Justin, instruct the servants to bring Mrs. Flynn's favorite dishes to her room in the morning."


"Mr. Flynn, this... Isn't this against the rules? If Grandpa Flynn finds out, he might give you trouble."


Justin couldn't believe it. Reese had received such an honor, even Miss Alyssa, who was most favored in the family, had never received this treatment. They never prepared the dishes and delivered them to anyone's room separately.


This meant that Reese would no longer have to dine in the living room in the future.


Mrs.Flynn was really lucky.


Malcolm's gaze towards Reese was tender, "Isn't it normal for my wife to have some privileges?"
###Chapter 51 Thorny Fairy


Downstairs, Reese had no idea about Malcolm's decision.


She still had things to attend to.


She didn't want to listen to Everly and Alyssa nagging,so she bade farewell to Grandpa Flynn and left. But instead of heading towards the company, she took a taxi straight to an apartment in the suburbs.


A renowned doctor lived there, a teacher she had known during her studies. Although retired now,he still held a distinguished reputation in the medical field. Today, she came here only to get medicine from him. It wasn't available on the market and was difficult to find. Applying this medicine to Malcolm's legs would be the icing on the cake. .Once his legs were healed, she could inquire about her grandmother. Even if he doubted her intentions, he would owe her for helping him with his legs.


She raised her hand and knocked on the door, and soon a maid arrived. Seeing the maid, she was about to introduce herself, but the maid had already stepped aside.


"Sir has been waiting for you for a long time; please come in."


"Thank you." Reese walked in and followed the maid to the backyard.


It was filled with precious herbs, exuding a familiar scent that made Reese feel at ease. She didn't like the.smell of flowers and plants, but preferred the aroma of these herbs. Her mood improved significantly as soon as she arrived here, at least happier than when she was at the Flynn family's.


From afar, she saw Grandpa Robert and called out cheerfully, "Grandpa Robert!"

Robert turned and saw Reese standing not too far away, waving at him with a sweet smile on her face.


"Reese,you finally came. How have you been lately? Is your grandmother doing well?"


When her grandmother fell seriously ill, Reese's medical skills were not advanced enough, so she had asked Grandpa Robert to take a look. They became somewhat acquainted through this, But mentioning her grandmother inevitably made Reese feel a bit melancholic, and she forced a bitter smile.


"Grandpa, my grandmother passed away two months arg"How could she have passed away?"


This news startled Robert. Reese pulled Grandpa Robert to sit on the nearby chair.


"It was an accident. Let's not dwell on that. Grandpa,do you have the medicine I asked you about on our last phone call?"


"Of course I have it. But that medicine is especially rare. I had to ask around extensively to find it for you." Reese affectionately linked her arm with Grandpa Robert's, acting like a little girl.


"I knew you would always dote on me, Grandpa."


"But Reese, that medicine is considered a divine remedy. Who are you going to give it to?" ,"Um... to my husband," Reese answered truthfully.


"When did you get married? Why didn't I know?"Robert was taken aback by this revelation.


Reese was already married,and her heart had grown cold. He still planned to introduce his grandson to her so that the two can get to know each other. It seemed that he was a step behind.


"This is a long story," she said.


"Alright, bring him over when you have time. When do you plan on going back to the medical school? The dean called me last time and said that you suddenly left, and there are many patients waiting for your appointment. Thinking back to those days, you were,my most valued successor. At such a young age,you had such incredible talent in the field of medicine. I can't even compare to you now." Robert's eyes filled with proud smiles as he reminisced about the past. Reese was his favorite as she was smart, quick-witted, and capable of figuring out things that even he couldn't understand. She was a rare talent in the medical field.


"I have some matters to take care of during this period, so I may have to wait a bit longer," she replied.


"Then let me get the medicine for you first. You seem busy, so make sure to eat before you go back today,"Grandpa Robert insisted.


"No need, Grandpa. I have to go back to work," Reese politely declined.


"You still need to work? With your salary, you won't have to worry about food and clothing for your whole life, even without doing anything," Grandpa Robert teased. Robert used to have the highest salary until Reese appeared, and now she has to be deferential to him to some extent.


"Grandpa, don't make fun of me. I really need to work. Besides, there's nothing elsefor me to do, so I need to pass the time," Reese explained. As they chatted, Robert went back to his room and fetched the medicine for her, handing it directly to her. Reese accepted it gratefully.


"I'll transfer the money to you, Grandpa, when I get back." Even though Grandpa Robert didn't need that money, Reese felt obligated to give it.


Just as they were talking, a cheerful voice rang out,"Grandpa, I'm back."


Upon hearing the voice of his grandson, Robert quickly pulled Reese over. "Reese,you haven't met my grandson yet. Let me introduce you."


As Remington stepped into the living room, he saw his Grandpa Robert holding hands with a fair-skinned,delicate-looking girl, her face filled with a radiant smile. It was rare for him to see Grandpa Robert so happy in front of someone. He considered himself to hàve seen countless beauties, but seldom had he come across someone with such a unique charm, especially those eyes which were clear and pure,with a slight upward tilt at the outer corners, exuding a captivating allure.


Reese had no interest in men and declined, "Grandpa,there's no need. I have something to attend to and need to leave."


She walked past Remington without even glancing at him,leaving him feeling quite deflated.How could a small girl like her be so dismissive and dare tó refuse Grandpa Robert's request? Everyone else would be respectful when they encountered Grandpa Robert,after all, he was a heavyweight in the medical field.


He shouted arrogantly at Reese's back, "Stop right there! Do you think you can leave without even acknowledging me?"


Robert sighed. This grandson of mine is looking for trouble. He actually dared to speak to Reese like this.That girl has a personality harder than a stone. Unlike ordinary girls who are soft, as long as the other person is strong, she can become even stronger.


In his lifetime, he had the fortune of seeing her arguing with a medical genius. Everyone advised Reese not to provoke that genius, but she daredto stand up and argue with him. What was even more surprising was that she actually won. Reese stopped and turned around. Her previously clear eyes instantly became as sharp as a blade,scanning Remington, startling him.


"I have paid for this medicine. Besides, did you help me find it? Even if I owe someone a favor, it's to your grandpa, not you. What does it have to do with you?"


Remington didn't expect her to look so beautiful and speak with a sting. And where did his inexplicable fear come from just now? Could it be that he, a grown man,can be scared by this girl in her twenties?


He straightened his back and looked at Reese with disdain.


"Do you know my grandpa's identity? Anyone who comes to my house treats him respectfully. Yet,you talk to him so casually. Do you understand manners?And when you see me, you don't even boter to say hello and just want to leave as if nothing happened.Truly uncultured."


A coldness flashed in Reese's eyes, a complete contrast to her meek appearance from earlier.
###Chapter 52 Reese Doesn't Brag


"You don't even know who I am, so how can you be sure if I have etiquette or not? As soon as you entered,you began scolding me. Is that the manners a host should have towards guests?"


If it weren't for Grandpa Robert's dignity, she would have turned this person into mincemeat already.


Robert stood on the side, sweating nervously forhis grandson. He was afraid things would escalate and couldn't reprimand his own grandson quickly enough.


"Remington, how can you speak like this? Apologize to Reese right away!"


Remington widened his eyes, looking at Robert in astonishment, "Grandpa, am I hearing correctly? Are you actually telling me to apologize to this brat? Why should I? Even if the dean of the medical school came,they would show proper respect to you."


Reese sneered, "Do you know that at the medical school, Grandpa Robert's position is lower than mine?"


"What are you blabbering about? How can your position be higher than my grandpa's? Do you know how powerful my grandpa is? It seems I underestimated your lackof manners."


Remington found it hard to believe.


Robert interjected sheepishly, "Reese isn't boasting.Her position is indeed higher than mine. If it weren't for her respect towards me, I should be the one personally receiving her."


This couldn't be possible! His grandpa had always been a legendary figure.
Grandfather had retired, but many medical
professionals came to visit him. Even a few words
with him were a rare opportunity for those people.


Remington looked blankly at Robert and asked,
"Grandfather, is what she said true? Is your position at the medical school lower than hers?"


Robert nodded, "Yes, I wouldn't lie to you about
something like this. Well, since Reese is busy,you can take her home."


"I...I take her home?"


Was grandfather joking with him? He had just been scolded by that girl, and now grandfather wanted him to take her home.


"Yes, you take her home. Otherwise, do you want me to go? Stop talking nonsense. If you don't take Reese home,forget about your monthly allowance next month. Hurry up," Robert said, while pushing the two of them towards the exit, speaking to Reese politely at the same time.


"Reese, my grandson is straightforward, but he means no harm. Don't mind him."


Reese smiled lightly, "Don't worry, grandfather, I won't argue with a child."


"Who do you think is the child? You seem to be around the same age as me, thinking you're so mature."


Remington hurriedly argued with her, not wanting to be left behind.


Reese didn't even bother to look at him, clearly not interested in engaging with him.


After getting into the passenger seat, she gave him the address, and Remington drove in that direction.


"You work at the Flynn Group? Let me tell you, I have an uncle who is a supervisor there. How about I introduce you to each other? Maybe he can help you get a promotion."


When Remington heard that Reese worked at the Flynn Group, his eyebrows raised with pride.


Reese,who rarely smiled, lazily glanced at him and casually said, "No thanks. My husband is the CEO of the Flynn Group."


Why would she need his uncle's help for a promotion?She could easily make his uncle lose his job with just a word. Remington was dumbfounded, "Your... Your husband is Malcolm?"


What explosive news! How many identities does this girl have? One moment, she's a powerful figure even stronger than his grandlfather, and now she's married to Malcolm, who holds Atlanta's economic lifeline.Just with a word from him, the whole world would change.


"We're here; just park here," Reese didn't answer his question. She didn't want to say much to someone'irrelevant.


"Let's talk a bit more. What else haven't you told us?Wait a moment," Remington, filled with curiosity,hastily got out of the car, grabbing her wrist.


Reese turned her head, eyebrows furrowed tightly,but her eyesshowed a fierce determination that startled Remington,causing him to involuntarily release her hand.


"What... What's with that look in your eyes?"


She was a twenty-year-old girl, how could she have such a daunting gaze, as if she were a demon capable of taking his life at any moment.


Before Reese could even speak, a car sped past them.Reese quickly grabbed Remington's arm and pulled him to the side. A gust of wind whistled past their ears,leaving Remington's face almost pale with fear.


He glanaced at Reese, who had a calm expression on her face. Her eyebrows slightly furrowed, and her eyes were as calm as a still pond, without a ripple in sight.


Despite the danger just now, she was able to react immediately and pull him away.

  .Trembling, Remington asked her, "Aren't you scared?"


"Fear is useless. In this world, fear is the most useless thing. Instead of being afraid, it's better to think about how to avoid danger. You should go back," she replied.


With that said, she turned around and started walking towards the company gate.


The car that had just passed by stopped steadily by their side.


The commotion behind them made Reese pause and turn around. Her cold eyes narrowed slightly. If she wasn't mistaken, this car was the newest model. Even just the seats inside the car were expensive,not to mention its exterior. Without exaggeration, anyone driving this car would have an extraordinary identity. There are only two of these cars in the world,and one of them was in her possession. The other one was in Malcolm's hands.


Justin got out of the car and helped Malcolm into a wheelchair. With a refined appearance, he casually rested his hand on the armrest. His gaze seemed to linger for half a minute before his thin lips opened,and his deep voice sounded, engulfing the surroundings.


"Who are you?"


Remington was momentarily overwhelmed by the man's presence before he snapped out of it.


"I...What does it matter who I am to you? And who are you?"


Why did this person ask who he was right after getting out of the car?


Malcolm's eyes were deep, like a vast sea,cold and merciless.


"You don't need to know who I amn."


His voice sounded cold and detached, with a hint of displeasure.


Both these men completely shattered his confidence.When had he ever been in such a sorry state? No,he had to pull himself together. He might be a cripple,but his height was still an advantage.


Straightening his back, Remington looked down at Malcolm. Despite having the advantage in height, he always felt suppressed by the man's presence. He kept encouraging himself in his mind. He was just a cripple, what was there to fear?


Remington stiffly questioned, "Do you know that your car almost hit us just now?"


The man coldly glanced at Remington and asked, "But did it hit?"


"You can't say that you have no responsibility just because it didn't hit. Do you know how dangerous it is to drive like you did earlier?"


Remington just couldn't let it go. It was the first time he had encountered someone as unreasonable as himself.


Reese felt a kinship with Malcolm in terms of their similar personalities. Malcolm, however, had no interest in reasoning with this kid. !"Stay away from her, understand?"
###Chapter 53 Did He Marry a Goddess?
The warning was blunt and direct, without any trace of tactfulness. Remington found it amusing and replied,"Why should I stay away from her? She's not your wife."


Justin remained silent, silently watching this young man court trouble and dare to challenge Mr. Flynn. It seemed that he was tired of living. Reese scratched her head beside them, feeling a bit awkward.


"He is my husband," she said.


Remington was dumbfounded once again, looking at Reese in disbelief, then at Malcolm.


"Are you saying that... this man is your husband? Isn't your husband Malcolm?" Remington was muttering to himself, and as soon as he finished, he snapped back to reality,staring incredulously at the man sitting in the wheelchair in front of him.


He was Malcolm, that man who resembled an emperor.Speechless, Reese looked at Remington's idiotic expression and walked past her to stand behind Malcolm,pushing the wheelchair. Without saying a word,she headed towards the company.


Malcolm's facial features softened slightly, and he instructed Justin, "Park the car."


"Yes, Mr. Flynn."


By the time Remington processed what had happened today, Reese and Malcolm were nowhere to be seen. It felt like a dream. As Reese pushed Malcolm into the elevator, she sked,"How are your legs?"


Malcolm's eyes flashed with a hint of darkness, his tone indifferent. Reese, being perceptive and sensitive,immediately sensed his displeasure. If it were someone else, they might have asked, but Reese was used to doing her own thing and didn't bother with these things at all.


The mood and emotions of anyone else were not as important to her. As if oblivious,she continued nonchalantly, "I'll make some more of that medicine for you when I get back. As long as you absorb it well,your legs shouldn't be a problem."


"Mm," Malcolm responded in the same indifferent tone,showing little emotion. He had been waiting for Reese to ask him, to take the initiativeand explain who the young man was just now. The elevator doors opened with a ding, and Reese pushed Malcolm out,
then handed the wheelchair to Justin who had come up behind them.


"You push him over there, I have things to do," she said. Justin clearly noticed the strange expression on Malcolm's face, a menacing presence behind his brows and eyes, but Reese paid no attention. Now was not the time to soothe him.


Is that her husband? He actually has the mind to go work.


Mrs. Flynn was indeed remarkable, no one dared to neglect Mr. Flynn.


After handing Malcolm over to Justin, she was about to turn and leave, completely indifferent towards Mr.Flynn. Justin felt that Mr. Flynn's face was getting darker and the temperature around dropped to freezing point. Just as Reese was about to enter the elevator again,Malcolm stopped her.


"Stop!"


Justin instinctively tightened his grip on the wheelchair,beads of sweat forming on his forehead.Mr. Flynn was about to get angry, is Mrs. Flynn in trouble?


But Reese calmly turned around and looked at Malcolm, raising an eyebrow and speaking in a relaxed tone.


"Is there something else?"


Malcolm looked at her delicate face,her eyes shimmering with clarity. But he somehow felt that something wasn't right, her demeanor was completely different from what he perceived. It was as if all these years, wherever he went, others treated him with caution and dare not be
disrespectful. Yet she, disregarded his words and now even ignored his emotions.


At this moment, Justin received a phone call, "Alright.I understand. I will inform Mr. Flynn."


He lowered his head and said to Malcolm, "Mr. Flynn,the person in charge is here to discuss further cooperation with us."


Malcolm kept staring at Reese, raised his hand,wanting to say something, but in the end, he could only give up.


"Let's go to the meeting."

"Yes," Justin finished speaking and gave Reese a signal to leave. However, Reese was still clueless, onlý looking at Justin, blinking repeatedly.


What's wrong with him?


Inside the elevator, Reese finally connected the dots from the previous situation and suddenly realized.It turns out Malcolm was about to get angry, but was interrupted by the meeting. The words he was about to say probably weren't nice ones.


Since they weren't good words, there was no need to listen.


She stepped out of the elevator and returned to the office. Susan and a few others were laughing and gossiping, but suddenly caught sight of a familiar figure. When they turned to take a closer look, their eyes nearly popped out in shock.


What's going on? Did they see wrong? The other colleagues gathered around.


"Did we see wrong or did Reese get plastic surgery?"


"Even if she did, how could it happen so quickly?"


"But she really became prettier, not just pretty,she's like a goddess."


"Her freckles and skin tone have also changed. Could she have been playing some kind of role before,intentionally making herself ugly?"


Susan crossed her arms, her face filled with jealousy.


They never expected that Reese would turn out to be this beautiful.


The simple shirt and pants she wore exuded a unique charm. Her hair was neatly tied up in a bun, and the smooth and natural contour from the back of her neck to her shoulder was flawless. Despite the efforts of her colleagues to meticulously groom themselves an hour earlier every day, they couldn't hold a candle to her natural beauty without any adornment.


Earlier, when Reese was still unattractive, Susan had felt somewhat superior. After all, she was a long-standing employee of the company, and she believed that she had more authority than someone who had just joined.


However, now she hadn't even spoken to Reese yet,and she already felt as if she had been overshadowed in terms of grace.


From a distance, Reese appeared to be the kind of cold and poised beauty who made others feel inferior even when they wanted to approach her for a conversation. Her presence made the surrounding women pale in comparison. Susan clenched her fists tightly, a subtle ironic smile appearing on her face.


"You guys just don't understand. She's playing a dangerous game. Mr. Flynn must have looked down on her before when she was plain, but now that she.suddenly looks beautiful, he must be pleasantly surprised. It's all about catching people off guard. You should all learn from her. Nowadays,women are so preoccupied with trying to seduce their bosses rather than focusing on their work."


As she spoke, Susan couldn't help but glance at Reese,who completely ignored her. Susan thought that Reese was intimidated by her silence, and she became even more arrogant, sitting in her chair with her legs crossed. Of course, the other colleagues would not support someone who had just arrived and always wore such an arrogant expression like Reese.


"That's right! Who would bother playing this kind of face-changing game for no reason?"


"I heard that Mr. Flynn is already married and has a wife."
###Chapter 54 Are You Blind?


Susan felt even more proud after hearing this.


"Then someone truly has no chance at all. Otherwise,they can only become Mr. Flynn's mistress."


Reese didn't let her defamation go unchecked. Instead,she focused on the report that needed to be submitted soon. Although she didn't attach much importance to the task, she always completed what was assigned to her with great efficiency. As she typed the final word,she let out a sigh of relief.


"Finally done."


Then, she sent the report via email, and the notification showed that it had been received. Reese slowly got up from her chair, a cold aura briefly flashing in her delicate eyes. Finally,she had some time to deal with these gossiping people. She calmly walked towards Susan and the others, and her presence instantly became imposing. Susan looked at her, feeling a sense of unease deep within. Reese stood in front of her,looking down on Susan, making her feel even more inferior. Additionally, Reese's captivating eyes added to the pressure, causing Susan to grip the chair tightly with her fingers.


"W-what are you doing?"


"Just because I ignored you doesn't mean I didn't hear you. Do you have any evidence to support your claim that I'm trying to seduce our boss?"


Although Susan was afraid, she couldn't let it show.

However,she was unwilling to be suppressed like this by Reese. She tried to raise her head and speak loudly, wanting to add some momentum to herself.


"Do we even need evidence for this? Everyone saw it clearly, Justin was right there, but you still insisted on pushing Mr. Flynn in. Isn't that intentional? Do you think you can just strike up a conversation with Mr.Flynn and think you've made it, dreaming big, aren't you?"


Reese sneered disdainfully.


It was just a pity that Susan didn't understand the concept of keeping a low profile. She was always gossiping about things, and it had already become an annoyance for Reese.


She wasn't in a hurry to explain herself but instead,she followed Susan's lead and said, "Since you think I can easily get close to Mr. Flynn, then I will try my best and use my beauty to get Mr. Flynn to fire you." Susan's face turned ferocious with anger, and a surge of fury was building up in her chest. She slapped the table and stood up abruptly.


"Reese, you have no shame! A shameless woman like you,how did you even enter the company?"


Reese tilted her head and had a mocking smile on her lips, "Are you blind? Of course, I walked in. Could it be that I flew in?"


Susan couldn't manage to say anything in response.She had never seen someone so difficult to deal with.No matter what you said or how you tried to attack her,she always remained calm and found unexpected words to dodge the situation.


She pointed at Reese, her voice trembling with anger,"You..." "I advise you to cherish today because you might not be able to come here tomorrow," Reese said,holding her water cup and walking out of the office.


Susan snorted coldly, "You think you can kickme out of the company? Dream on!"


Inside the office, Malcolm had just finished a meeting and was sitting on his chair, lightly pinching his brow with tiredness evident in his cold voice.


"What did you see?"


Justin couldn't help but get excited when he recalled the altercation between Reese and Susan just now. He hadn't witnessed such a fierce confrontation in a long time.


He felt it was necessary to tell Mr. Flynn about this glorious event. "Didn't Susan have a fight with Mrs. Flynn? She was speaking so rudely, and I almost wanted to step in for Mrs. Flynn. But then Mrs. Flynn said a few words,and Susan suddenly couldn't say anything anymore."


Justin used to think that Reese looked dumb,with her dark skin, heavy bangs, and a pair of incredibly unfashionable black-framed glasses.


Naturally, he preferred the current Mrs. Flynn. If she could stay with Mr. Flynn and become an assistant in the Flynn family, wouldn't that be a win-win
situation?


Malcolm listened with some interest.


Justin gave an interesting description, "She's like covered in thorns,completely different from how she usually is in front of us." .This girl was increasingly winning his favor, but it seems like she didn't care about herself right now,which puts him in a passive position. However, there's still a long road ahead, so he can take it slow.


"You mentioned earlier that Susan is targeting her?"


Justin clearly felt Mr. Flynn's aura turn cold as he uttered those words.


"Yes, I heard that Susan has been targeting her since Mrs. Flynn arrived at the company."


"Fire her, deduct her salary and bonuses for this month. Whoever bullies my wife must be tired of living."


"Did you find out the identity of the person at the company gate earlier?" Malcolm continued to flip through the documents with his head down. "Yes, we found out that he is the grandson of a famous doctor in the medical field. It seems that Mrs.Flynn went to see him this morning, and it was the doctor who asked his grandson to bring Mrs. Flynn back," Justin spoke quietly, fearing that Mr. Flynn would become jealous and order someone to ransack their house. He never expected that such a cold and proud man would be so doting on his wife.


Mr. Flynn's future motto would probably be, "Anyone who dares to bully my wife will lose everything and be buried with their entire family."


Malcolm raised an eyebrow. "What was she going there for?"


"It seems like she went to retrieve something."


Justin didn't pay much attention to it, and besides,Mr.Flynn only mentioned checking the person's identity, without mentioning anything else. After contemplating for a moment, Malcolm remembered Reese mentioning his legs in the elevator, as if she had found some kind of medicine.


As long as this medicine was absorbed well,standing up would be just around the corner. So, it turns out his wife went to such lengths for the sake of his illness. No wonder she left in such a,hurry this morning.


Perhaps Malcolm didn't notice it himself, but Justin'witnessed Mr. Flynn's fierce eyebrows and deep eyes drowning in utmost delight, to the point where that joy was on the verge of overflowing. This change in attitude was even faster than flipping through a book.


Since Mrs. Flynn entered the picture, he felt that Mr.Flynn was becoming increasingly strange. Previously,he wouldn't let anyone affect his emotions, but now,anything related to Mrs. Flynn garnered special attention from him.


Malcolm concealed his smile and instructed Justin,"Handle Susan's matter quickly."


"Yes."


Since Mr. Flynn said so,he could only obey the command. If anyone was to blame, it would be Susan for daring to offend Mr. Flynn's honey. In the afternoon, just as Reese had some free time and was about to call Calvin to find a way to get rid of Susan,Justin came in.


Susan had always wanted to climb up to Malcolm through Justin's connection. Even if she couldn't be his lover,it would be good enough to have him look at her a little more.


Justin was Malcolm's most valued assistant, so naturally, Susan had to please Justin in every way possible. When she saw Justin entering, she quickly approached him, full of enthusiasm.


"Is there anything you want to instruct our department on behalf of Mr. Flynn?"


Justin placed a document on the table, his face expressionless, "Did you make this priceestimate last time?"


Susan picked it up and glanced through it, and said,"Yes, I did. Is there a problem?"


"The problem is quite significant. You omitted a zero in this quotation. If it weren't for colleaguesin the document submission department discovering it,do you know how much money the company would have lost?" "That's impossible. I double-checked everything."
Susan looked at the document again in surprise,and indeed, there was a missing zero in the quotation.
###Chapter 55 I'm not that easy to bully
Susan's face turned pale as she pleaded with Justin."Can you forgive me this time, considering that it's my first mistake? I promise to pay more attention in the future."


"I'm sorry, but you won't get that chance. As a long-time employee of the company, you should know how much Mr. Flynn detests employees making such basic mistakes. Write your resignation letter and hand it over."


Susan raised her head in shock."What? I'm going to be fired? Why? I didn't cause any loss to the company,and it was discovered in time. Why fire me?"


"You made even the most basic mistake, proving that you're incompetent for this position.Just leave gracefully. You can still find another job. If you cling on, we'll have to use other ways." After taking care of business, Justin turned and left, not giving Susan a chance to argue.


If Mr. Flynn wants you to leave, he will never keep you until tomorrow.


The other colleagues did not expect Susan to be fired.Just this morning, she was arguing with Reese, but within a few hours, she had to leave the company.


Everyone was afraid, except for Reese, who remained indifferent.


Half an hour later, Susan packed her things and left.Before she left, she couldn't help but threaten Reese,"Don't think that by using these tricks to drive me away, you can rest easy. This company doesn't lack enemies. Are you planning to drive them all away?"

Reese casually sat in the chair, her gaze coldly sweeping over the angry Susan, a smirk on her lips."If you think I'm the one who got you fired, then it proves that I have some talent. Otherwise, why would he fire you just because of me being bullied?"


Susan was about to explode in anger, raising her hand to hit Reese.


Reese's eyes narrowed,ready to dodge.


Reese grabbed her wrist and swiftly dodged, only to hear a cracking sound as she stood behind Susan.


Susan's hand was twisted behind her, the pain causing tears to flow uncontrollably.


"Ah... it hurts, please... please let go of me." She was furious, forgetting that Reese had some combat skills.


Reese's clear eyes were filled with coldness as she held onto Susan's arm without loosening her grip.


"Some people are inferior in their own abilities yet still try to defame others. Even if I were to dismiss you from the company, it would require you to be caught with evidence. The issue with the document you saw was your own fault, yet you tried to shift the blame onto me."


She presented her case with reason and evidence,exuding an intimidating aura. Some colleagues wanted to step forward to intervene but hesitated when they met Reese's captivating gaze.


Pale-faced, Susan looked around, realizing that no one dared to come to her aid. "Are you all cowards? I've been so good to you all this time for nothing."


A female colleague wanted to help Susan,but another held her back.


"Do you want to end up in the hospital? Can't you see the hostility emanating from Reese? She's not even afraid of Isaac."


Recalling the recent incident where Isaac was mercilessly beaten to the ground, the female colleague became apprehensive.


With no one coming to her aid and the pain becoming unbearable, Susan had no choice but to plead.


"Reese, I'm leaving the company, so please let go of me." "Apologize," Reese's voice was as cold as ice,leaving no room for resistance.


Susan gritted her teeth, appearing reluctant, but remembered that this girl was crazy enough to even dare to fight Isaac. Who knew what else she was capable of?


In order to protect her arm, she had to temporarily surrender.


"Okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said those things about you. Please let go of me, otherwise my hand will truly be useless."


Seeing her somewhat begrudging attitude, and knowing they would never meet again, Reese finally released her. Susan staggered a few steps before regaining her balance. Turning around, Reese glanced at everyone and spoke.


"Consider this a warning. I, Reese, won't allow anyone to bully me. Whether you want to sabotage me behind my back or confront me directly, as long as you're not afraid of losing your job, it's all the same to me."


With Susan as an example, no one dared to trouble Reese anymore. They obediently sat down and continued with their work as if nothing had happened.


However, every word Reese said in the office was relayed to Everly's ears without missing a single detail.


Her face revealed a hint of disdain and coldness, "She really thinks she's the CEO's wife, daring to show off in the company. Let me handle her."


"Give the order. Tomorrow, have Reese meet with the t herself. Don't cause any more trouble."


"Something happened, otherwise the company won't spare her."


"But Miss Everly, didn't Mr. Flynn from Ocean Group say that he wanted to find someone else to negotiate?"the assistant asked cautiously.


Everly gave her a cold look, "Since she's a newcomer,she needs more experience. Having someone accompany her is just fine. There's no need to worry."


Knowing Everly's temper, the assistant didn't dare to argue and could only comply.


"Then I'll go take care of it now." Just the thought of Reese not being able to feel proud soon made Everly feel relieved.


After work, Reese received a last-minute notice that she would be accompanying the Ocean Group for a discussion tomorrow. She generally wouldn't refuse arranged work, and since she was busy preparing medicine for Malcolm, she agreed without much thought.


The assistant called Everly and informed her of Reese's response, which surprised Everly.


"She actually agreed so readily without any suspicion?"


"Don't worry, Miss Everly. She didn't have any doubts."


"Well, that's good." Every was worried that things would be difficult if Reese had any suspicions.


Reese returned to the Flynn family mansion and went straight to the kitchen, where she personally tended to the stove while making medicine for Malcolm. This medicine was not only expensive but also required great effort and resources to find.


If she hadn't been lucky to find some at Grandpa Robert's, Malcolm's legs would have had to wait even longer.


"It seems you have quite a few connections, even able to find such high-quality medicine," Vincent said as soon as Reese closed the lid. He stood at the kitchen door, with his handsome features and vast, unsettling gaze.


With her vast experience in reading people, Reese could tell that he was like a smiling tiger. He probably had a hand in Malcolm's legs' condition, even if Malcolm was clever, he couldn't match an expert.


Thank goodness she came, or else it would be a waste of his handsome face and figure.


Her expression remained indlifferent, lacking any interest in talking to him.


"It's just luck. If you had the same luck, I'm sure you would have found such good medicine to treat Malcolm's legs," she replied, sensing a hint of irony in his words.
###Chapter 56 You've Gone Too Far


Vincent could also sense it. He approached and stood next to Reese despite being much taller, showing no trace of superiority.


"You're really good to Malcolm. I didn't even know there was such good medicine. You must know more than just the basics. I heard that there was once a wizard in the medical world, also a woman,who specialized in herbs, acupuncture, and became a paragon in the medical world at a young age."


Reese was stirring the medicine in the pot with a spoon, sniffing, her tone was calm as she responded,"Well, I've heard of it too, it's impressive, she's my idol, if I had that kind of honor and title, I wouldn't have to marry your Malcolm right?"


Vincent laughed brightly, "That's true, she is from a wealthy family,she has no worries about food and drink in this life, if she continues to specialize in this area, in the future, her future is even more promising.she will become a Tarzan in the medical field."


Reese nodded, rather recognizing his words.


"Yes that's true, but it has nothing to do with us, I want to cure Malcolm's legs now, or else walking out,always pushing the wheelchair it'd be quite_troublesome. I don't want to let great face value go to waste."


Vincent listened to her words so lightly, his heart doubts even more, could it be that he guessed wrong.she is not that medical wizard?


Then why was her technique and specialty so similar to that person.
He would have to try it out, justin case he was able to turn the tables on him.


Vincent and Malcolm had two very different styles.Malcolm's face was cold, always exuding an aura of uninviting. He was also decisive in his work. He never hesitated and the company's employees saw Malcolm always with only one expression.


If you can see him smile, it is like winning a lottery.


Vincent was different, long and refined, even if already twenty-five or twenty-six years old. Hissmile was also very gentle, but Reese just couldn't like it.


Probably just the type these young girls liked.

He leaned forward slightly, and the distance between him and Reese was instantly closed, and he could see her small white earlobes when he turned his head eways, and when he opened his mouth, his voice was seductive.

"In fact, I'm also very good looking, do you want to consider me, at least what you want, I can give."


Reese was so smart, how could she not hear Vincent's meaning,she sneered and turned her head sideways,brightly confronting him.


"So you're trying to use your beauty to attract me?"


Vincent's evil smile scratched up from the corner of his mouth, "That still depends on whether or not you are willing to be attracted to me."


Reese scoffed down, "I admit that you do have a tasteful look, but I'm a person who doesn't really like to deal with people who have a lot on their mind." She already had a lot on her mind, and then another person who thinks about how to count all the time, is there any sincerity left?


The smile at the corner of Vincent's lips froze slightly,"Doesn't Malcolm have a reason to have you around?Do you know what will be waiting for you once you.cure Malcolm's legs?"


Reese spread her hands, not a trace of nervousness visible on her clean, white face, as if she were having a normal conversation.


"I know, how simple it is, either you guys just find a random reason to get rid of me, after all, Malcolm can already stand up and have no worries, it's perfectly fine to find a girl with a good condition and background, so that you can also expand your family's business, keeping someone like me, who can't do anything, and whose education is not high enough,and who doesn't even want to learn the rules isn't it
just additional burden to yourself?"


Vincent's eyes were full of approval and astonishment.He initially thought that this girl was too indifferent in dealing with things. It was as if even if the sky were to collapse,she would remain steady.


Now it seemed that she knew everything in her heart.


"I don't understand then, if that's the case, why did you still help me treat Malcolm's legs? If you had let him stay like that, Grandpa wouldn't have a reason to drive you away."


Reese chuckled, her voice filled with irony."It's not like everyone wants to stay in the Flynn family, nor is everyone greedy for wealth and glory."


She had already achieved these things on her own. Vincent became more interested in this girl in front of him. She was different from other girls, hiding her thoughts too deeply. The words she spoke always brought surprises.


"Well,consider being with me," he suggested.


Reese raised an eyebrow. "Are you not bothered by the fact that I'm Malcolm's wife?"


Vincent seemed to have very few requirements.


Just as Vincent was about to speak and say that he didn't mind, Malcolm's gloomy and hell-like voice suddenly rang out at the kitchen door.


"Do you think I'm dead then?"


Reese's body trembled slightly, but she didn't feel any fear. Instead,she pressed her lips together and smiled,as if she was waiting to see a good show. She believed that whether it was due to the dignity of the Flynn family or Malcolm's own pride as a man, Vincent would not be allowed to be insolent in front of him.


In fact, even if Malcolm hadn't come, she would make sure Vincent would never dare to say such things in front of her again.


The atmosphere in the kitchen suddenly became icy.Vincent's corner of the eye twitched like he had clearly touched a tiger's bottom, causing a big trouble for himself.


"Malcolm, I was just joking with Reese," Vincent immediately retreated. He didn't want to provoke Malcolm.


A cold anger emitted from Malcolm, "Are you scared?It seems like you're very gutsy. If I catch you doing this again, I'll make you stay outside for a few more years before you can come back."


"Malcolm, don't joke. It's already been a little while since I came back like this, and you want me to stay outside for a few more years."


There was still a smile on his face, but only Vincent himself knew that in these years he had been struggling outside because he had no other choice.If Grandpa Flynn hadn't entrusted the company to someone who was crippled rather than him, he wouldn't have had to fight outside.


But it didn't matter. No matter what kind of wife Malcolm found, he would get back what belonged to him.


Malcolm's gaze fell on Reese. "Come with me to the room."


Reese pointed at the medicine in front of her and said,"This will work immediately."


"Let Sandra stay here," she hinted.


"Sandra stayed last time," implying something.


"Hmm," Malcolm responded, then noticed Vincent still standing beside Reese, with a cool frost covering his face. "Aren't you leaving yet?"


Vincent chuckled softly,"I'm leaving now."


It's unlike Malcolm to react this way.Seems like Reese is his type, they might have some fun in the future.


With everyone gone, Reese suddenly felt like the kitchen had become much bigger. She turned off the stove and carried the medicine back to the room.


Malcolm sat with his back facing her by the window,and the sunlight that poured in now cast a golden edge on him, making him look like a beautiful painting.
###Chapter 57 Falling hurts, Having a Wife Comforts You

However, there was a strange atmosphere in the room.


It's not hard to guess that Malcolm was upset about what happened earlier.


It's surprising to see the usually proud and cold Malcolm feeling jealous. Just thinking about his gloomy face earlier made her want to laugh.


She approached Malcolm with the medicine in hand,"Drink this first."


Malcolm glanced slightly,′′Is this the medicine you went to get early this morning?"


Reese admitted frankly, "Yes, this medicine is hard to come by, but it's very effective for your legs. Drink it quickly."


Malcolm took it and looked at the dark color, couldn't help but frown.


"Is it bitter?"


"Go on, if you drink it, I'll give you candy," Reese spoke gently, sounding more like she was talking to a child.


Malcolm hesitated for a few seconds but decided not to disappoint his wife's kindness. He tilted his head back and drank it all, with Reese standing at his side,this angle gave her a view of his attractive Adam's apple moving up and down, making her imagination run wild.


Realizing that she was actually fixated on a man's Adam's apple, Reese quickly snapped back to reality.She took out a piece of candy from her bag, tore open the wrapper with her pristine fingers,and placed it directly into Malcolm's mouth.


Her slightly cool fingertips touched his warm lips.which were soft.


The sweet taste gradually spread in his mouth, and Malcolm's furrowed brows gradually relaxed. Seeing him like this, Reese couldn't help but tease him.


"You drink medicine and still want to eat candy.Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?"


"I have nothing to be afraid of. After all, I've married my wife. Let them laugh if they want," Malcolm responded, as if enduring bitterness was a noble deed.


"Oh, by the way, this medicine has a bit of a side effect. Forgot to tell you," Reese said.


The man's expression froze for a moment, "Why didn't you say earlier?"


"You didn't ask, but it doesn't matter since you don't need that anyway," Reese smirked, her eyes filled with mischief, but also very charming.


Malcolm noticed that she was smiling, her face
bloomed like a hundred flowers. Sweet, refreshing, and delightful. But when she turned cold, it was bone-chilling, a world of hardship.


Impatiently, he urged, "Come on, tell me,what are the side effects?"


"Well,you might experience some slight physical reactions,but they should be bearable. Even if you can't bear it, there's nothing you can do about'it." Either way,she would never have any real marital relations with him, as she had no intention of doing So.


Malcolm lifted an eyebrow and asked, "Isn't it your job to solve this problem?"


"Why should I help you solve it?"


"You're my wife. If you don't help me, should I go find someone else?" Malcolm thought his reasoning was sound.


He believed Reese would surely agree. After all, she was so strong-willed, how could she allow him to seek other women? Just as he was silently smug, Reese's tone suddenly shifted, and she responded enthusiastically.


"Sure, if you can't control yourself, I'll find someone for you. What do you like? Tall, thin, fair,dark,big,small?" She rattled off without realizing the man beside her had an extremely unpleasant expression.


Malcolm had remained silent the whole time. Only now did Reese turn and notice his tightly pressed lips and the faint anger in his eyes.


With a seemingly innocent face, she asked,"What's wrong? Don't you like any of them? I'll bring some photos for you to choose from tomorrow if you want...Ah..."


Reese hadn't finished speaking when Malcolm stretched out his long arm and pulled her into his embrace. Wide-eyed, she instinctively struggled,but Malcolm's grip on her waist prevented her from moving.


In an instant, her smiling face turned frosty, her captivating eyes warning him, "I don't want to fight you. Let go of me in three seconds."


However, Malcolm remained unperturbed and even pressed her closer against him, "You're just taking advantage of my current condition. When my legs are healed, little wildcat, you may not be my match."


He wasn't joking with her. Her quick and agile hands were indeed impressive, clearly well-trained. But she overlooked one thing which was the vast difference in physical strength between men and women.


Reese never liked to admit defeat, so she taunted him with her eyes, "Don't be too confident. Falling down will hurt."


She had won second place several years in a row. Did Malcolm think he could defeat someone who sparred regularly? Malcolm leaned in closer, his formerly handsome features now revealing a devilish smile that could charm all living things. His warm lips brushed her ear.his voice low and magnetic.


"If you get hurt, you'll have me,your husband,to comfort you."


Reese squinted her eyes, forcefully pushing him away.This time, Malcolm allowed her to leave. When he could stand up again, things between them would surely be even more interesting than they were now.


She held the bowl,feeling somewhat annoyed,especially with the man's annoyingly playful and teasing appearance. Since someone had challenged her,she couldn't back down.

 
"Not a chance," Reese said. "In that case, don't cry for mercy," the corners of Malcolm's lips curved deeper, as it was uncertain who would be begging for mercy then.

Neither of them had ever lost to anyone before, so they were both eagerly looking forward to this show.


During dinner in the evening, Reese finished eating and was about to leave the table when Grandpa Flynn,with a serious expression, said, "Reese, don't leave just yet, I have something to ask you."


As a younger generation, Reese had to listen when the elders spoke. She sat back down, her face filled with a smug smile, facing Everly sitting across from her.


"Grandpa, what is it?"


Reese was very audacious and she never got nervous just because an elder asked her something.She believed in standing her ground when faced with challenges, just like a soldier facing an enemy or water covering earth, it was her survival rule.


"I heard that you had a physical altercation with a female colleague at work today," Grandpa Flynn began the interrogation. His words silenced the entire living room. The seriousness on his face, coupled with his history of having a hot temper in his youth,commanded a presence that could intimidate anyone.


Reese didn't defend herself strongly, instead calmly responding,"Yes."


"You've only just started working, and you're already getting into conflicts with your colleagues. Isn't that problematic? You didn't even join the company through proper channels, and now there are rumors of you bullying others, which, if spread outside,would impact the company and subsequently tarnish the reputation of the Flynn family. Do you understand?" Grandpa Flynn was starting to reprimand her. His words instantly silenced the entire living room. With a grave expression on his face, he exuded an aura that could intimidate everyone, despite his old age.


Reese didn't have an entirely righteous position,but she calmly asked her own question in response to Grandpa Flynn's reprimand.


"ShouldI just bear it even if that female colleague accused me of seducing our boss? She wasn't merely targeting me but she insulted my character. I believe that if people outside know that Mrs. Flynn has been insulted by a colleague in this manner, it would also damage the reputation of the Flynn family."


Everly suddenly chimed in, "You're becoming more and more disrespectful. You even dare to argue with Grandpa when he's reprimanding you." Alyssa also gave Reese a disdainful glance. "Exactly,when Grandpa reprimands you, even Malcolm doesn't dare to contradict him like this. But you dare to argue with Grandpa. People who come from the Backwoods clearly lack manners and courtesy."


Reese didn't find it strange at all to be attacked like this. Everly's intention in speaking up was to burden Reese with the crime of disrespecting her elders.


Grandpa Flynn was highly respected in the Flynn family, and his grand presence combined with his temperament made it difficult for him to change, even as he aged.


Feeling that his authority had been offended, Grandpa Flynn's face turned dark. He slammed the table and sternly scolded, "Reese, even if you didn't receive a proper education while growing up, respect for elders should have been taught by your teachers. Who gave you permission to speak to me like this?" The room fell silent as everyone awaited Reese's response.


The atmosphere in the hall grew even more gloomy.The people at the table dared not move. Vincent squinted his eyes slightly, crossed his arms, and had the look of someone enjoying the show.
###Chapter 58 Let go of me,youhooligan!


This girl was becoming more and more intriguing. She dared to defy even Grandpa Flynn. What else was she not afraid to do?


"Grandpa, I fired the female employee in the company.It has nothing to do with my wife. She has always been straightforward and unassuming in her speech.I apologize on her behalf," Malcolm explained.


Alyssa couldn't help but widen her eyes. So Malcolm was blinded by this girl's beauty? How could he still think that she's not someone who overthinks things?She clearly resembled a cunning fox, and just her eyes alone were enough to make one shudder.

Reese's pupils suddenly contracted, a hint of surprise flashing through. Was he really speaking up for her? Grandpa Flynn's anger only grew instead of subsiding after listening to Malcolm's explanation. "She is causing trouble, and do you just let her run wild? It's true that you have control over the company, but you can't simply fire someone based on a whim. If the other employees find out, they'll surely speculate about your relationship with Reese."


Malcolm chuckled and said, "Grandpa, we are indeed husband and wife. There's nothing much to speculate about. Even if they do, it's just a passing matter."


Grandpa Flynn was getting frustrated. He didn't know how to talk to Malcolm anymore. What's wrong with his grandson lately? He always defends Reese in everything.


"Even if you are husband and wife, the people in the company don't know that. And although Reese's appearance is acceptable now, her background is far from ordinary. It's completely unrelated to our family. The media is paying a lot of attention to the Flynn family now. If this gets out, who knows how they'll report it."


"Let them report however they want. Regardless of Reese's background, I won't allow anyone to bully my wife."


Reese looked at this man beside her, his gaze determined. The contours of his face were profound,with knife-like lines. Under his straight nose, his beautiful lips were tightly pressed together. Dressed in a black suit, he stoodI tall and imposing, exuding a chilling aura.


Everly and Alyssa were intimidated by his presence and didn't dare to make a sound. Everly tightly gripped the chair, her face that was slightly proud just moments ago now filled with anger. Had he stopped listening to Grandpa just for Reese?
What is so special about this woman?


Alyssa had always been outspoken, saying whatever she thought. She couldn't stand how Malcolm was protecting Reese.


"Malcolm, she's an outsider. Everyone here is your blood relative. How can you blur right and wrong for the sake of this woman?" Alyssa voiced her disapproval.


As soon as she finished speaking, a shadow passed through the man's eyes, and his gaze shot towards Alyssa.


Alyssa was merely gazed at by him, and she immediately shrank her neck, feeling intimidated.


The man's gaze was dominant, and it was clear that his anger had escalated.


"If anyone dares to target my wife again, I will show no mercy."


Perhaps it was his intimidating presence, but not a single person dared to utter a word. Grandpa Flynn was so frustrated that he sat slumped in his chair,unsure of what to say.


Then, he looked at Reese, and his sharp eyes softened slightly.


"Honey, let's go back to the room."


Reese was momentarily stunned before realizing he was calling her.


"Oh,okay." She approached and guided Malcolm towards the room, while the people in the living room downstairs watched them in confusion.


Alyssa looked at Grandpa Flynn in astonishment, then stomped her foot in anger.


"Grandpa, aren't you going to do anything about this?"


It had escalated too much.

The wrinkled corners of Grandpa Flynn's mouth twitched, and his expression wasn't too good either.
Then, he got up, leaning on the chair.


"We'll talk about everything when Malcolm's legs get better."


Alyssa couldn't believe it. After Grandpa Flynn left, she turned to. Everly.


"Did Grandpa mean to let Malcolm pamper and protect Reese like this?"


Everly was also helpless. "What elsecan we do?Malcolm wants to protect her, and there's nothing Grandpa can do about it."


Alyssa looked unwilling. She had originally wanted to watch Reese embarrass herself and be scolded by Grandpa. Who knew it would turn into a public display of affection?


Reese was about to help Malcolm up to return to the bed slowly. However, Malcolm stood up with the support of the chair armrests.


This startled Reese, and she quickly went up to steady him. "Don't act recklessly now, rest a few more days."


There was a touch of tenderness in Malcolm's eyes as he said, "You care about me."


This remark almost made Reese send him back to the wheelchair.


"You've misunderstood. I promised your grandpa that I would help you stand up. I'm the kind of person who keeps my word."


She was simply fulfilling her promise to others. As for caring or not, she was really embarrassed. She only cared about her wallet.


Malcolm raised an eyebrow, his smile becoming more pronounced. He wasn't affected at all and even lightly pinched her round earlobe, his voice seductive. "Has anyone ever told you that your ears turn red when you lie?"


Startled, Reese immediately touched her own ears,feeling nothing. Then, she saw Malcolm smirking mischievously. Reese had never been played with like this before, so she punched his waist. However,Malcolm swiftly dodged the attack.


Reese's eyebrows narrowed as she caught his arm,ready to throw him over her shoulder.However,Malcolm anticipated her every move as if he could read her mind, like a tapeworm in her stomach. In the end, instead of teaching Malcolm a lesson, Reese found herself being pinned down by him on the bed.

She struggled, glaring at the man above her with angry eyes, "Malcolm, let go of me,you ruffian!"


Malcolm held her hand, which was about to strike down, and instead of anger, his eyes were filled with excitement.


"I am your lawful husband, how did I become a ruffian? And there are even more ruthless things I can do,would you like to try?"


Reese,fully aware of his implication, shouted, "Don't you dare. I'll hurt you!"


Malcolm curled his lips devilishly. It had been years since he had encountered such a prickly woman,truly interesting. With his other hand wrapped around her waist,he was slightly surprised. Her waist was extraordinarily soft, not just like that of a taekwondo practitioner, but more like a dancer's flexible and graceful waist.

The warmth of his fingertips lightly brushed against her petite nose, her eyes filled with rage while he was overflowing with tenderness. "If you hurt me, what will you do in the future?"


Reese was about to be driven to the brink of collapse by this shameless man. Her cheeks flushed white and she looked ferocious, but there was not a single aspect that made her uncomfortable. On the contrary, it was rather cute.


She stared fiercely at Malcolm with her chilling eyes,"If I had known you had such intentions, I wouldn't have saved you."


"I am your husband, saving me means saving yourself.Otherwise, you won't be able to leave the Flynn family."


Reese sneered. Confidence exuded from her bright eyes.′′Iwon't say anything else, but as for leaving the Flynn family, the door really can't stop me. I come and go as I please."
###Chapter 59 Playing with Fire


No one could stop her.

And if one day she truly decided to stay,it would be because she wanted to, not because she was forced to.


Malcolm's curiosity about this girl was growing. Her temperament and character were different from any woman he had met before. She dared to act and was direct,always following her heart.


It seemed that there was nothing in this world that could restrain her, not even the freedom that everyone,including himself,longed for.


"If I were to hold you in my arms, how would you still plan to leave?" The man's magnetic and seductive voice, like a melodious sound, inexplicably entered Reese's heart. She held her chest, feeling her heartbeat gradually quicken.


Why was she feeling so flustered? Could it be that she was developing some kind of sympathy towards Malcolm?


She tried to shake off this thought and issued one final warning to Malcolm, "I'll count to three.If you don't Yet go, don't blame me for being impolite!"


As she started to count, Malcolm had already released her, "I won't bother you any longer."


Reese finally put away the silver needle from her sleeve cuff. She had forgotten to take it out today. If Malcolm didn't let go of her, she would have to stab him with the needle, and he would be uncomfortable for several days.


Seeing him regain his serious expression, Reese secretly hid the needle back into her sleeve. But how dare he take advantage of her without permission? If he wasn't given any punishment, should she still call herself Reese?


Malcolm returned to his wheelchair, smoothing out the wrinkles on his clothes, when suddenly Reese spoke.
up.


"I was passing by the supermarket today and bought some candy. In the future, if you still need to take medicine, would you like to taste it first?"


He turned his head to look at Reese beside him. There was still a blush on her cheeks, and her eyes were bright and lively. But despite having such beautiful eyes, Malcolm felt that there was something more to her, as if she had another motive.


Malcolm explicitly refused, saying, "No need." However, Reese still insisted on taking out the candy from her bag, tearing open the wrapper, and reaching out to feed it to Malcolm.


"But it really tastes good, why don't you try it?"


"Reese!" She kept teasing him with the candy in front of her. Malcolm frowned and warned.


His warning might work on others, but it had no effect on Reese. She held the back of his head with one hand and forcefully fed the candy into his mouth with the other.


Malcolm wanted to spit it out, but Reese said, "This candy is my own creation, unique. You can't spit it out."

He didn't spit it out and Reese couldn't help but smile in satisfaction. However, before she could celebrate for Jong. Malcolm spoke up again.


"Since it's unique, why don't you also taste it?"


As soon as he finished speaking, Malcolm grabbed Reese's arm. Caught off guard, she stumbled and sat on his lap. His lips landed precisely on hers, delivering the sweetness of the candy into her mouth.


Reese widened her eyes, wanting to struggle, but after their earlier interaction, Malcolm had already become familiar with Reese's tricks. This time, he cleverly held her hands in front of her, and Reese tried to kick, but Malcolm used his leg to hold her down. Reese was no match for his strength and couldn't move.


It wasn't until the candy in her mouth gradually melted away that Malcolm let her go. Reese became infuriated and tried to slap Malcolm's face, but he firmly caught her delicate wrist, feeling her strength. He couldn't help but furrow his brows. This girl was for real.


Yet, in an instant, he considered something and his expression turned into a smile.


"Could this be your first kiss?"


Reese's cheeks reddened even more, and she struggled harder.


"Malcolm, if you dare take advantage of me,believe me,I'll disable you!"


Malcolm raised an eyebrow teasingly at her, his smile carrying a hint of sexiness, almost blinding Reese.


Malcolm felt a surge of anger and confusion as he found himself unable to move. He looked at Reese, his brows furrowed and his handsome face clouded with darkness.


"What have you done to me, Reese?" he demanded.


This time, it was Reese's turn to revel in her victory.With a mischievous smile,she gracefully rose from Malcolm's body and circled around him.


"I've told you before, don't touch me and don't take advantage of me. Don't worry, I just wanted to render you immobile for a couple of hours."


Malcolm couldn't help but feel intrigued by Reese's audacity instead of getting angry. Her every action and word were unpredictable, as if she had abandoned her struggle just moments ago with an air of resignation.Who would have expected her sudden attack?

 
It was like she wore a mask, and unless that mask was removed, he would never know her true intentions.
Malcolm began to suspect that Reese's identity wasn't as simple as it seemed. He had to dig deeper. The Flynn family couldn't afford to have someone unknown infiltrate their ranks.


Malcolm's lips curled into a chilling smile as he gave Reese an ultimatum, "You have five minutes to release me, or else, once I call for help, my grandfather won't spare you!"


Reese sat on the table, swinging her fair and slender legs leisurely. She asked, "And if I don't?"


A glint of sharpness flickered in Malcolm's eyes, "Then don't blame me for being impolite."


Before Reese could react, Malcolm swiftly grabbed her waist and pinned her down, ignoring her disbelief,"Do you really think your little tricks can outsmart Jne?"


"You dodged?" Reese exclaimed in disbelief.


"The weather has gotten colder these past few days.
I've layered up," he said, tilting his head slightly,
unable to conceal his pride.


Reese was furious with herself for making such a careless move. She was now pressed against Malcolm's legs, just like when she was a child,getting a shot while lying on someone's leg. This position was embarrassing enough for Reese.


If Calvin were to see this, she would become the laughingstock. Her frustration made her hurl threats at Malcolm.


"Malcolm, I warn you, it's best if you let me go,or you won't be able to leave." "After the way you just treated me, how should I punish you?" Malcolm said, raising his hand and patting Reese's buttocks. Reese looked at him in disbelief.


"You dare to hit me!"
###Chapter 60 We Are Husband and Wife
Since she could remember, she has never been hit by anyone,especially in this manner. Is Malcolm going crazy?


Malcolm raised an eyebrow, finding it amusing, "I just gave you a light tap."


Reese was about to argue back when they heard a noise at the door.


"Malcolm, are you in here? I had the maid cook a bowl of soup."


Reese was still being held down by him and could only glare at him.
 "Let me go quickly."


Seeing her so nervous, Malcolm suddenly became interested in teasing her.


"We're husband and wife, not having an affair. Are you afraid of someone seeing us?"


Seeing his slender eyes smiling like a fox, Reese knew he had something up his sleeve. She had never been this passive before, so that was simply impossible.


Her eyes were bright, sparkling with a glow, and she asked Malcolm again.


"So you want her to see, don't you?"


Malcolm raised an intrigued eyebrow, his voice slightly louder.
"Then I'll indulge you." But he would have to bear the consequences himself.


As soon as he finished speaking, Reese pushed herself up, smoothly turned around, and sat back on his lap.wrapping her arms around his neck and leaning in to kiss his lips.


Malcolm's brown eyes flashed with a moment of surprise.


"Well, I coming in."


Everly pushed open the door while holding the bowl of soup. When she looked up, she saw this embarrassing scene. Malcolm still sitting in the wheelchair, Reese sitting on his lap, her hands around his neck, and the two of them passionately kissing.


She was dumbfounded, her hand trembled and thebowl slipped fromn her hand, spilling onto the floor.She turned red with anger, walked over, and pulled Reese off Malcolm's lap.


"Malcolm, even when you're like this, you still let her seduce you!"


Everly raised her hand, intending to slap Reese, but Reese agilely evaded, causing Everly's hand to miss.She lost her balance and was about to crash into Malcolm.


But Malcolm was faster. With a swift movement of his wheelchair, he leaned to the side, and Everly fell onto the bed in an awkward position, her legs in the air.


Reese stood on the side, covering her mouth to hold back her laughter.
 Everly struggled to sit up with a dignified but embarrassed expression. Seeing Reese laughing at her made her even more furious.


"You dare to laugh at me! Malcolm, don't you care at all?"


She grabbed Malcolm's arm and stomped her feet on the ground, her voice becoming coquettish and affected, which made Reese's skin crawl.


Damn it all.


With her own objectives accomplished,now Everly must have a good time bothering him.


Reese waved her hand at the helpless Malcolm,"Darling, I won't disturb you two in fostering your  relationship." She said that, like a triumphant fox, she even gave him an air kiss before taking the opportunity to slip away.


Malcolm wanted to call her back, but Reese had already disappeared.


He pushed Everly aside, "Stop it."


"Then tell me, why did that woman just kiss you?Doesn't she know about your condition? How dare she seduce you at a time like this."


"Everly!" Malcolm suddenly wore a stern face and spoke in a low voice, clearly unhappy.


Everly froze. Although she knew Malcolm was generally more gentle towards her and Alyssa,whenever she crossed his boundaries or stepped on his sensitive spots, he wouldn't let it slide. She cowered in fear, shrinking her neck, "I'm just concerned about your health. Why are you angry with me? In the past, you never got angry at me for others."


"I've told you before, Reese is now my wife;which means she's your sister-in-law. Watch your words and show some respect, don't overstep."


He stared at Everly, his gaze deep and dark, lacking any hint of brightness.


Everly pouted, looking dissatisfied, "How is she even worthy?"


"If I hear similar words of you vilifying her again,then you'll face house rules punishment!"


The man's voice coldly interrupted Everly's words,freezing the air. Everly's face turned pale, and she took a small step back, speaking with a trembling voice.


"You're punishing me for her sake?"


"She's my wife." One sentence summed it all up.


He actually admitted that this unpleasant girl was his wife.


She was unwilling to accept it and pointed at Reese raising her voice, "When your legs get better, Grandpa will make her leave!"


Everyone knew that the mighty Flynn family would never truly let the daughter of a small family become Mrs. Flynn. Allowing her in was just a temporary strategy. A coldness engulfed Malcolm's handsome face instantly, with raging anger visible in his eyes.


"Everly! Since she has married me, she is my legally wedded wife, even if my legs recover, I won't divorce her. If you say such things again in the future,don't blame me for disregarding our sibling relationship."


Everly was at the brink of madness but couldn't do anything to Reese. Malcolm was protecting her so fiercely that she couldn't even lay a finger on her.


In the end, all she could do was stomp her foot in discontent.


"Grandpa won't allow you to keep her."


Everly stormed out in anger, and the room gradually quieted down. Reese leisurely played with her own hair. "I didn't expect your sister to be so deeply in love with you."


The gloomy expression on his face vanished without a trace when facing Reese, and his lips curved into a slightly joyful smile.


"Is my beloved wife jealous?"


"What's there to be jealous of? Only a boring woman would be jealous because for a man."


She joined the Flynn family not to be jealous of these little girls. She would rather spend her time buying stocks and making money. After all, money would always accompany her, as for men, they were useless.


Malcolm wasn't affected at all. His slender fingertips lightly grazed his lips, wanting more. "The kiss just now was good. Can you give me another one?"


Reese suddenly had the urge to punch someone.


"Don't even think about it!"


With those words, she turned around,opened the door, and walked out. Malcolm's eyes and eyebrows were filled with a smiling expression. How could he enjoy seeing her wife angry so much?


She looked good no matter what.


Throughout the journey, Reese couldn't help but think of Malcolm's seductive appearance, coupled with his high attractiveness. It was really tempting, and if she couldn't control herself, she might not be able to escape a calamity. However, this man's kissing skills were indeed good.


When she arrived at the company, Reese was about to pour herself a cup of coffee when she heard a woman calling her from behind.


"Are you Reese? I'm Lilly,your new team leader."


"Yes, what can I help you with?" Reese tore open the coffee sachet and poured it into her cup.


Lilly didn't expect Reese to be so indifferent to her.Today,she came here and all the other employees were enthusiastic and welcoming, but this girl, a new employee, didn't even give her a proper look.

She felt a bit unfair in her heart and decided to reveal her true identity to gain a bit more respect from her.
*****************


She was a pawn abandoned by her family, forced into a marriage with the rumored disabled and tyrannical CEO of a wealthy dynasty.


Everyone waited to see the tragic joke of this union,unaware that this marriage would mark the beginning of her shocking rise through high society.

###Chapter 61 Ill Break Your Arm if I Have To
"Don't make the mistake of crossing me, okay? My uncle, Winston Moore, mentioned there's a new hire here who started off on the wrong foot by picking a fight on day one. I can't stand people who cause trouble instead of working hard. I swear,if I catch them slacking, they won't last long in this company!"


Reese kept silent, giving the impression she wasn't listening at all.


Not getting a response, Lilly was livid. "Are you even hearing a word I'm saying?"


Reese,sipping from her cup, replied casually,"What does your uncle being Winston Moore have to do with me? But yeah, those who stir up trouble instead of working? They should be dealt with, lest the office turn into a cesspool."


With that, Reese walked past Lilly and left.


Lilly watched her go, her face twisting with rage.


One of the female colleagues, quick to cozy up to power, approached Lilly. Seeing as her previous ally Susan had left, she was on the prowl for a new patron.


"Team Leader Lilly, my name is Claire Hamilton.Reese is the new girl, and rumor has it she got in through connections. It was also her doing that Susan was pushed out. She's a force to be reckoned with,Team Leader Lilly. Better watch out."


Lilly's uncle being Winston Moore of ZS Group meant that from a young age, she was used to being the center of attention. She could enter any company through the back door, and everyone would have to respect her because of her connections.


But Lilly had never encountered someone as arrogant and brazen as Reese.

She glared at Reese's desk, seething. "If she thinks she can show off in front of me, I'll make sure she's fired."


"Absolutely," Claire nodded eagerly in agreement.


"When she comes back, remind her about the project discussion tonight at seven," Lilly said, her eyes gleaming with malice. It was a difficult client, and with the tight deadline looming today, if Reese failed, she'd face the consequences from above.


Perfectly aligning with Everly's wishes, Lilly would be justified in kicking Reese out, should she fail. Claire understood perfectly: "I'll let Reese know once she's back."


After taking a sip of her coffee, Reese frowned. It was nowhere near as good as the specialty beans she brewed at home-like drinking tap water. Next time,she resolved to bring her own specialty coffee from home. Yes, that would do.


Returning to her desk, she was instantly stopped by Claire Hamilton.


Reese,don't forget Team Leader Lilly's reminder to head over for the project negotiation at seven tonight.Today's the final deadline-if that contract isn't secured,you will be held responsible"


She wasn't afraid to tell Reese; after all, she didn't believe the deal could be closed.
 "Got it," Reese replied with ease.


Claire Hamilton watched her casual demeanor and decided to rattle her a bit. "Word is even Mr. Flynn himself couldn't seal the deal last week. Don't boast now and end up embarrassed later."


Reese shot Claire a cool glance. "All this concern for me, Claire-if I don't land this project, are you willing to share the fallout? If not, spare me the pointless chatter."


Reese had no time for those who paraded borrowed power. Her life's mantra was straightforward: show me respect, and I'll double it. Cross her with baseless claims,and she'd crush the opposition without a second thought.


Even if the highest powers intervened, she wouldn't hold back. Life was about happiness, after all. Why live stifled and upset?


At seven sharp, Reese headed to the club with the contract in hand, solo-despite suggestions for backup,which she'd flatly rejected. Tag-alongs wwere just dead weight,potentially more of a hindrance than a help.


Taking a seat upon arrival, it wasn't long before an overweight man plopped down beside her, exuding casual impatience. "You're from the Flynn Group,right? How many times must I say it-I'm not interested in signing anything. Why do you people keep..."


Henry Kim stopped mid-sentence as his gaze fell on Reese.


He fancied himself well-acquainted with beauty,but the pure-yet-chill essence exuding from Reese was something he'd never encountered. Even in her modest attire, she radiated an undeniable allure.


She stood out like a diamond in the rough, captivating his full attention.


Men are often powerless against beauty, and Henry found Reese's composed allure extraordinary-a perfect blend of enchantment.


Such a rare gem, he thought.


His demeanor shifted swiftly."Miss Reese, it is?Pleasure to meet you. Just you then?"


"Just me," Reese affirmed, her voice cool and businesslike. "If there are any concerns with the project, Mr. Kim, feel free to lay them out. I'll clarify any doubts." Reese's expression remained neutral, her tone detached -not the least bit desperate for his signature, but rather as if he were the one eager for her consent.


And sure enough, she had the clout to back it up.


Henry Kim's chubby face was slick with grease,squeezed into a grease-slicked smile as his gaze fell lecherously on Reese, making her skin crawl with discomfort.


Still, Reese kept her cool. If he dared cross a line with her,today would mark his end.


"You think you can handle what Mr. Flynn couldn't?You must be overconfident, Miss Reese," blurted Henry,his corpulent body leaning forward with an unbridled glint of greed in his eyes.


Reese's lips twisted into a smirk. "Mr. Kim, your time is just as valuable, so let's cut to the chase. The company has already offered a two percent concession on this project. Any lower, and there's no deal-our firms needn't bother with further discussions."


But work was the farthest thing from Henry's mind;he was consumed with how to make Reese his.


He chortled, "I own this hotel. It's getting late... Why don't we head upstairs, have a drink, and chat?"


From the moment Henry set eyes on her, Reese had seen through his intentions.


With a face like that, the audacity to covet her.


Her smile curved ever so slightly-a dazzling radiance that could be describedas devastatingly beautiful,captivating onlookers. "Sure, but touch me, you'll regret it," she teased.


Henry was almost drooling, but he didn't really believe this slip of a girl could break his hand. He took her words as a playful way to save face.


He nodded eagerly. "Yes,yes,let's go."


Reese followed him to the room, where Justin Chabon,passing by the door, caught a glimpse of her silhouette and that of the overweight man. He immediately
called Mr.Flynn.


"Mr. Flynn, I think I just saw your wife at the hotel getting into the elevator with Henry Kim. Not sure if they're going to a room."


"Send me the location. I'm on my way."
###Chapter 62 Never Cross Mr. Flynn's Wife
"Got it."


Justin hung up and sent the location via text before waiting patiently at the entrance for Mr. Flynn.


As soon as Henry pushed open the door, he was eager to push Reese onto the bed, thinking she was a sure thing,his true nature laid bare.


"Sweetheart, there's no running from me now. I just can't wait any longer."


Reese gently pushed him away, her face still painted with an irresistibly charming smile, which made Henry's heart burst with joy.
"Mr. Kim, what's the rush? We haven't even talked about the contract yet. If you don't sign today, I'm going to catch hell from the bosses back home," the words hung in the air as tension simmered.


"Happiness first," Henry Kim blurted out as he shrugged off his jacket, eyes locked onto Reese with a predatory gaze.


Dodging nimbly, Reese retorted, "Sign first, then we can talk."


But Henry Kim, transfixed by the rare beauty before him, hastily scrawled his signature on the contract and cast the pen aside, lunging forward with the hope of ensnaring Reese in an embrace.


"So, can we get on with it now? Come on, beautiful,"he crooned, a hint of smugness in his voice. The smile on Reese's face vanished. Ice replaced warmth as her gaze, sharp as blades, stabbed into Henry Kim. He felt an unexpected chill,almost believing he was dealing with two entirely different people.


"What's the meaning of this, beautiful?" Henry Kim stammered, taken aback by the sudden change.


With a wicked smile that could captivate anyone,Reese picked up the contract, confirming the inked signature. "Signing a contract. Can't you see?"

Realization dawned on Henry Kim, his face twisted with anger. "You little trickster, you dare play me!"


"Shut your trap. I'm not wasting my time here with your nonsense," Reese snapped, stepping past Henry Kim with the contract in hand, but there was no way he'd let her off the hook easily. "Think you can trick me and just walk away? You won't be leaving through that door today," Henry Kim declared, determined to have Reese, and reached out to pull her into his arms.


Unfortunately for him, he had sorely underestimated her. At the moment his grip settled on her wrist, Reese swiftly rotated, using his own bulky frame against him. With a sharp kick, pain sent Henry Kim tumbling to the floor.


She scoffed with disdain, "As if you could ever lay a hand on me."


Henry Kim, seething on the ground, refused to accept defeat, certain he could not be bested by a 'little girl.'


With another charge at Reese, her eyes glinted with a bloodthirsty coldness. "Suicide," she whispered, her body gracefully flipping.hands grabbing Henry Kim's arms and executing a swift reversal. The sound of snapping bones echoed,followed by Henry Kim's agonizing howl.


"Ah... It's killing me!"


Curled on the floor and bathed in cold sweat, Henry Kim writhed and shook uncontrollably as his face turned an ashen hue.


Reese dusted off her hands, then mockingly consoled Henry Kim, "Mr. Kim, didn't I warn you? If you dared to lay afinger on me, I'd break your hand. You should've listened."


"You really think you can threaten me with a lawsuit?" Reese scoffed, unfazed by the bold accusation. Her eyebrows arched in defiance above her fair cheeks, a picture of utter nonchalance. "Go ahead, I'll be waiting for the subpoena."


Henry Kim was livid. HIe'd never encountered anyone with such gall-a mere employee daring to be so audacious.


With a decisive slam of the door, Reese made her exit,taking the elevator straight to the back door and leaving without a backward glance.


When Juistin Chabon and Malcolm finally reached the room, they were greeted by a scene of pristine order,save for Henry Kim writhing in agony on the floor.


"What in the world happened here?" Justin mumbled.searching for the Madam.


Malcolm loomed over Henry, his gaze captivating and intense. "Where's the girl that was with you?" Clutching Malcolm's pant leg as if it were a lifeline,Henry pleaded, "Mr. Flynn, that Reese, she's with your company, right? She actually dared to break my hand.You need to punish her, and make it harsh."


Malcolm knew Reese wasn't the type to start trouble without reason. His eyes darkened with a chilling intensity as he pressed, "What did you do to her?"


"I just wanted her company for the night. Who knew the lady could fight? And she tricked meinto signing some contract-I'll never acknowledge it," Henry said in a panicked rush, fearing someone else might getthe upper hand.


Standing off to the side,Justin Chabon cringed,mentally facepalming. Henry was digging his own grave, even admitting to unwelcome advances towards the Madam. Malcolm's fury was palpable, a swirling storm of rage.His voice was a cold hiss. "Since the contract's signed.it's done. Justin Chabon, break his legs. We take care of family matters in-house."


"Yes," Justin replied, almost casually.


Henry's face drained of color, confusion and terror taking over. "Wait, Mr. Flynn, what are you doing?I didn't do anything wrong!"


Justin's mocking laughter filled the room. "You just messed with Mr. Flynn's wife."


Henry looked up in disbelief. "What? That woman,she's... she's Mr. Flynn's wife?"


"You'd better consider yourself lucky. Right now,you're just looking at a few months in the hospital.If you really tick< Mr. Flynn off, a hospital stay is the Jeast of your concerns."


Justin Chabon couldn't even be bothered to shout out a "911" as backup for Henry Kim before he just up and left. Henry practically blacked out from the pain.


"I mean,talk about ruthless," someone muttered.


Not only did they break his hand without a second thought,but they also snatched the contract. Mr.Flynn was even more brutal, going so far as to break Henry's ankle too.


Reese walked back into the office where most of the staff were still burning the midnight oil, the end-of-year evaluations always kicked things up a notch.


Claire Hamilton was just tidying up her desk when she looked up and saw Reese returning. She strode over,ready for the usual banter. "Look who's back, our very own hero. So. did Mr.Kim give you a dressing down, and that's why you're so late? Hope you weren't off somewhere crying your eyes out."


Reese didn't give her the satisfaction of a response,simply tossing the contract onto her desk.


"There, the contract you wanted."


Claire's eyes widened in disbelief as she glanced at the papers on the desk. "No way,you actually got the contract?"


"It's signed by Mr. Kim himself. You think that's a forgery?"


Reese reveled in the shock on the faces of those who'd mocked and underestimated her, as they gaped,looking as if they'd swallowed something foul. Never underestimate anyone, and don't mock others.You never know the extent of someone's capabilities.


But Claire Hamilton refused to believe it. How could someone as new as Reese swing a deal like Henry Kim's project without pulling some strings?


"You're not pulling a fast one on us, are you? They forge contracts all the time, Reese. If you're trying to scam the company with a fake, you're asking for a lawsuit."


Reese was fed up with Claire's logic. She hadn't wanted to stoop to her level, but Claire just wouldn't let up and kept pestering her, so it was time to put an end to it.


"If you think I'm duping the company, let's make a bet. If the contract's a fake, then the loser buys dinner for the entire staff." The mention of a free meal got the other colleagues swarming around.


"Claire Hamilton, take the bet. I don't believe for a second that she, a newbie with nothing but good looks, could pull it off."

###Chapter 63 Mr. Flynn Looks Up to Madam with Admiration
"Exactly. If she were really so capable, the company would've promoted her long ago."


"Even Ms. Flynn couldn't seal this deal, so what chance does she have?"


The taunts from the other colleagues only strengthened Claire's belief. Reese was probably just trying to bluff her because, really, what skills did she have to get a signature from Mr.Kim?


The company was about ready to throw in the towel on the project, but Ms. Flynn's command seemed all too transparent-it was a power play aimed at squeezing Reese. Why did that brash girl have to strut in like she owned the place? Everyone could see through her cocky demeanor, and worse yet,she'd managed to steal everyone's thunder upon her arrival.


Claire Hamilton, gritting her teeth and stomping her foot,looked like she was ready to risk it all.


"Fine, I'll take that bet," she declared. "Let's go clear things up with Ms. Flynn right now."


"Why bother him? Just call Ms. Flynn here," Reese replied with a relaxed ease, her heart secretly leaping with joy. Someone had actually taken the bait. She'd treat the whole office to dinner on Claire Hamilton's dime until she was bankrupted, if possible.

Reese typically had little mercy for those who spun truths out of thin air; it wasn't in her nature to be soft. Claire Hamilton was utterly shocked. In Reese, she saw what could only be described as otherworldly-a
woman who seemed to fear nothing, daring to say or do anything.


"Ms. Flynn is here."


At the sudden announcement, all heads turned.

Ms. Flynn, sensing an unusual tension between Reese and Claire Hamilton, asked, "What's going on here?"


Claire Hamilton, trying to dominate the conversation,said, "Ms. Flynn, Reese has been parading around with a fakecontract. She even had the gall to claim she'd secured Mr. Kim's deal."


Ms. Flynn looked surprised, her gaze shifting to Reese.Her eyes sparkled with intelligence and determination;not a trace of guilt was visible on her face. If she were dealing in forgeries, she wouldn't be able to stand so confidently. Unless, of course, she was just that good of an actress.


Pulling the contract from the desk and flipping it open, Ms. Flynn's eyes landed on the signature of Henry Kim in the bottom right corner, causing her pupils to narrow sharply.


It was indeed Henry Kim's genuine signature.The contract was real. How had she pulled it off?


Colleagues in the office watched as if it were a play,and even those in the hallway couldn't help but take a peek.


Justin Chabon pushed Malcolm to the doorway.

"Never would have guessed the lady was so shrewd,"he  commented. "To land Henry Kim's deal is no small feat. The women we usually send his way either get rejected for not meeting his standards or end up in a last-minute retraction, despite whatever...agreement they might have reached. But most of them were just chasing the money, thinking a payoff from Kim would smooth everything over."


"But our dear Madam here played a different game,"said Malcolm from his wheelchair, a gleam in his deep-set eyes directed toward Reese, his face alight with merriment. "Sure, she used her charms effectively,but in the end, Henry Kim not only lost out, but ended up with a broken arm and leg to boot! And she clinched the deal to boot."


Justin Chabon twitched, sensing Ms. Flynn's near reverence for Madam.


Everly, after reading the contract,still found it hard to accept but  couldn't deny the undeniable-Reese had actually pulled it off. Claire Hamilton, noticing Ms. Flynn's silence and sour expression, felt even more assured that the contract was phony. "Looks like Reese has no shame, touting a fake contract as real. What're you planning, treating the company to a meal?"


Reese's scoff carried as her piercing gaze landed sharply on Claire like a cutting knife. It was the first time Claire had seen such a look in Reese's eyes, and she couldn't help but feel a jolt of fear.


"What are you staring at me for?" Claire shot back,defiance masking her alarm. "You're the one in the wrong,are you trying to intimidate me now?"


Then, with a sudden curl of her lips, the tension in Reese's eyes melted away. "Ms. Flynn hasn't said a word yet, so could you stop making noise all by yourself?" Her sarcastic tone, paired with a smug smile, only added fuel to Claire's ire. She turned to Everly and demanded, "Ms. Flynn, announce the results,please."


Ms. Flynn put down the contract, her face grave as she made the pronouncement. "The contract Reese brought back is legit."


"What?" Claire stared at Ms. Flynn as if she'd seen a ghost, her smile freezing on her face. "You must be joking, Ms. Flynn? How can her contract be genuine?"


Ms. Flynn was inwardly impressed by Claire's folly,casting aspersions without any knowledge. She was shocked too-Reese had actually managed to land the project.


But there was nothing he could do-Reese had indeed succeeded. They would just have to find another way next time. "That's enough, everyone. Let's break it up," she finally said, dispersing the crowd of downcast colleagues.


Claire remained, fuming and incredulous, her disbelief written all over her face.


"How could she possibly have agreed to sign, Mr.Kim? We've dealt with each other before; he never intended to give us the project in the first place."
Reese spouted the words sarcastically,yet brimming with confidence.


"Just because you can't do it doesn't mean others can't. And don't forget about our little bet. Loser treats the entire company to dinner. Don't forget about tonight." A smirk glittered in Reese's eyes.


With that, Reese turned around with a proud posture and left. Claire Hamilton simmered with resentment,vulnerable to Reese's maneuver.


The colleagues nearby began to tease her.


"Dinner's on her tonight!"


"Looks like I don't have to bother with groceries and cooking this evening."


Claire,perturbed by the jeering yet concerned about her reputation, could only grit her teeth and swallow the bitterness silently.


"Fine,we'll do barbecue."


"Awesome, barbecue works for me."


Reese skipped the outing, disliking the insincere banter of clinking glasses and forced pleasantries often involved in such events. Why pretend to be friendly when people are insincere?


She'd rather take a soothing bath and get a good night's sleep, especially after her skin crawled from the thought of being touched by that sleazeball today.


Were it not for her fear of arousing suspicion from Malcolm,she would've had Calvin ruthlessly take over every company under Henry Kim's name and tank his stocks to bottom out, leaving him in utter despair.


Exiting the office late, the night had already fallen, she found the roadside was empty of cabs. Not wanting to draw unnecessary attention with Calvin's flashy wheels, Reese decided to wait for a taxi.

While waiting, she casually checked her phone and discovered the news about Henry Kim had hit social media. Someone had broken his arms and legs in a hotel, leaving him in a ghastly state, currently under care in the hospital, but refusing to reveal the assailant's identity.


Reese wondered. She had only broken Henry Kim's arm; when had his legs been folded in the fracas? The media could be so reckless with facts.


Heading back to the Flynn residence, as Reese walked by Alyssa's room, she caught wind of a heated exchange.


"You think you could do better, then show me! Who told you that she loses her edge in late-game? She's a powerhouse in group fights, okay? Do we have to resort to insults, really? Think about the fans watching, or I might just report you."


"I lost earlier because I wasn't at my best. Did you fail to see that my so-called teammates had no clue how to guard their mage?"
###Chapter 64 A Cure for Discontent


Reese was actually a bit taken aback - she hadn't pegged Alyssa for someone who'd get so wrapped up in a childish game like 'Arena of Valor'. It's just a bit of fun, but a squabble? She held her surprise in check,figuring it had nothing to do with her.


As she was about to leave, Alyssa's ears caught another burst of male bravado from inside.


"Can't believe you're squabbling with me over this,"the voice sneered.


Alyssa's temper was already short fuse, and insults like that just lit her up. She threw caution to the wind and leapt into the fray.


"What's the big idea, calling me out? Who do you think you are?" she shot back fiercely. His voice grew cockier, "So what? Come at me if you think you can, rookie. You're such a noob streaming and you still dare to step up? Look at your stats.You've lost every match against me."


Alyssa was seething. Sure, she had lost before but that was because of lousy teammates-always stuck with dead weight dragging her down.


If only someone could help her turn the tables,she'd be eternally grateful.


Left with no other option, Alyssa bit back, "Have you no decency? Arguing like this with a lady?"


Laughter erupted on the other side. "Lady? If I hadn't heard that tomboy voice of yours,I might have thought you'd gone through a gender transition" Before Alyssa could finish her retort, her phone was whisked out of her grasp by a slender, pale hand that swiftly ended the call. Then she heard a voice, cold yet somehow melodiously pleasant.


"Just invite him to the game and stream it live," the speaker instructed.


Turning around, Alyssa's eyes widened in surprise at the sight of Reese.


"You jerk... How did you get into my room? Did you totally ignore grandpa's words? No decency at all," she accused.


Reese,with an air of indifference, asked her, "Do you want to win or not?"


Was it Reese's intense gaze or her own helplessness that mnade her want to reach out for help? "But... I can't beat him."


"I will."


"You?!" Alyssa's eyes bulged, "You Backwoods folks play 'Arena of Valor'?"


The mention of Backwoods sent a smile across Reese's face. "Backwoods isn't in the dark ages. We have electricity, water, internet-everything you city folks have."


Feeling helpless and almost at her wit's end with irritation, Alyssa resigned herself. After all,losing again wouldn't be so different from the usual.


"Fine, I'll trust you this once."


Handing the phone over to Reese, Reese booted up the game and searched for her bold and boastful challenger who boasted the name "Undefeated Master."


Reese almost laughed. With an ego that inflated,referring to himself as 'Master' was downright nauseating.


She first glanced at Alyssa's in-game name.


"'Bun'? Really? Gotta work on that intimidation factor."


She played her wild card and changed her screen name to "Queen of Comeback."


The platform buzzed with excitement. Spectators everywhere were ready for the showdown.Reese leaned over to Alyssa and chuckled. "There's gotta be some skin in the game. Tell him if he loses.he's gotta livestream calling me 'daddy' in front of all his fans."


Alyssa couldn't help but laugh at the thought.


"Well, that sure sounds good. But are we betting too high here? I sure don't want to be calling him 'daddy'if you lose."


"I won't lose."


Something about Reese's unwavering conviction seemed almost innate, as if in that moment, an aura of gold wrapped around her, shining brilliantly.


Snapping back to reality, Alyssa threw down the gauntlet on the platform. "Holy smoke! That jerk actually agreed."


"He took the bait because he has no clue who the player is."


Look at that arrogance...


Alyssa burst into laughter. "What's the difference if it's you playing? A loss will still look bad for us. I was pretty much in despair until I heard you. Now I can't help but findit funny."


Reese didn't blame Alyssa for doubting; after all, only Reese knew her own capabilities, and judging someone solely by their looks was pure folly and could lead to being outwitted with ease.


A defiant smile danced on her lips as she raised an eyebrow.

"Want to make a bet with me?”


"Bet on what?" Alyssa wasn't intimidated by the young woman. Despite their similar age, Reese always had this air of mystery around her,acting like some enigmatic boss.


But sometimes, she quite pulled it off.That gaze was like a sharp sword, ready to cut through you.


"Let's make it interesting."


Alyssa rolled her eyes dismissively. “You're not thinking I'll call you 'big sis,' right? Dream on. You're barely older than me. Plus, you just married into the family. For all we know, Malcolm might replace you sooner rather than later."


Reese smirked."That's not likely. Malcolm's totally committed to me now."
"Quit Hattering yourself. Malcolm's a catch. Why he's chosen you-a woman without connections, lacking degrees, and with quite the temper-I'll never understand. It's like you've married up into our family, and now we're the ones reaching."


Alyssa simply couldn't stand Reese's indifference,as if nothing, not even the sky falling, would faze her.


Not even Grandpa could intimidate her.


Reese shot back with confidence. "Malcolm married me fair and square, not as a concubine. Besides, I haven't taken a dime from your family, nor am I eyeing a high position in your company, What's there for you to reach for?"


Reese may come from humble beginnings, without the backing of an influential family, but she refused to let these external factors define her character. No outer circumstance was going to dictate how she felt about herself.


Even if I'm as insignificant as an ant, I've got to live a beautiful life. Not to cling to any man, not dependent on anyone else. When times get tough and you're at your most helpless, the only one who won't abandon you is yourself.


Alyssa was really having her eyes opened here, and she did so with such righteous fervor.


With a helpless shake of her head, she remarked,"You've got to be the most unconventional person I've ever met, in actions and words alike."


"Cut the chit-chat and place your bet," Reese quickly interjected, as game time was approaching.


"Fine. Beat them for mne and avenge my loss, and I'll be your disciple."


"Who needs another disciple?" she scoffed,
unimpressed. She already had plenty and wasn't looking for more.


That hit a nerve, and Alyssa, hands on hips and full of defiance, retorted, "Hey, do you realize that there are very few people I admire in this world, Malcolm being one of them, and you're just brushing me off?"


"Okay, okay, I can't think of anything else at the moment. Just thought a wager would make things a bit more interesting."


Otherwise, she really wasn't drawn to such low-stake games.


Alyssa, overhearing the game prompts, nudged Reese excitedly,"It's starting!" Reese redirected her attention to the smartphone screen. From the get-go, she had no intention of dragging the game out. After powering up to level three, her gameplay was fierce. Her moves,her anticipation of the opponent's actions, frighteningly precise.


She anticipated all of Angela's ambush spots as if the entire map was clear to her, as if she had some kind of divine vision.


Alyssa was astounded; every time Angela showed up,she was taken out. Mid-game, the cursing started.


Reese ignored it, intent on wrapping up the game within ten minutes.

As the end neared, Reese scored a pentakill, and Alyssa was just short of leaping up to celebrate.
###Chapter 65 Boudoir Bliss


The trumpets of victory sounded as Alyssa's face lit up with a delighted smile, and she excitedly hugged Reese, planting a kiss on her cheek.


"Girl, you're incredible! It's like you've had practice at this."


Reese handed her the phone, her porcelain complexion betraying no sign of exertion, her calm almost excessive.


"You could totally rub it in his face now. Make him stick to his promise and call you 'daddy'."


Alyssa laughed heartily.′′Ican't wait! You must play all the time to be that good." Any previous irritation Alyssa held toward Reese evaporated.Now, Reese was her idol, her recent display of skill nothing short of miraculous.


"Not really. I only played when Arena of Valor was new, but I got tired of it fast and deleted it."


Alyssa was even more astonished. "You're this good without playing often? That guy probably won't believe it was me playing."


"It doesn't matter who played, we won.Just wait for her to call you 'daddy." Reese glanced at the clock;it was getting late and she wanted to get some sleep.


Alyssa shook her head."Poor Malcolm, getting pricked with needles every day."


Reese was just about to open the door when she heard this and warned, "You might want to keep comments Jike that to yourself, in case Malcolm hears..."


Alyssa quickly covered her mouth.


After Reese left, Alyssa clenched her fist, her face alight with excitement. "Yes!" she exhaled. Revenge had finally been hers.


Reese entered the room to find Malcolm had just finished a call with Justin Chabon about Henry Kim.Hearing that Henry wouldn't be out of the hospital for a month, Malcolm felt a wave of relief.


Surprised, she asked, "You're back early?"


Malcolm's smile was tinged with delight."Wanted to see my wife."


Reese was caught off guard by his sudden display of affection. She'd never met a man like Malcolm,who gave the impression of being cool and distant but turned out to be incredibly clingy with her.


Rolling up her sleeves, she reached for the acupuncture needles in the drawer,issuing a playful warning. "If you don't start talking normally, I won't go easy on you. I'll make you experience a whole new level of pain."


Malcolm teased her in his nonchalant way. "I know you wouldn't bear to."


Reese raised her chin defiantly."Wanna bet?"


She advanced towards Malcolm, needle in hand, but with lightning-quick reflexes, he scooped her into his embrace and captured her lips in a kiss. Reese's eyes flickered with a sharp edge, seizing the chance to drive the needle towards Malcolm's skin. But the man wore a sly grin, having already seen through her intent. His hand snapped out, gripping her wrist just as she made her move.


"Darling, would you really hurt me?" he teased.


"Malcolm, stop it, or I won't be so nice!" Reese warned.


Reese had never been treated this way by a man before, and she realized, to her irritation, that she was no match for him. With Malcolm's agility even in his current state, she dreaded to think how formidable he'd be at full strength - she could end up being easy prey.


Pullíng her close, their bodies pressed together, his warm breath caressed her ear, sending her pulse racing. "You know." he murmured, "they say this is the wedding night."


Her normally still heart was inexplicably sent into a burst of warmth, a blush spreading across her cheeks.


"Who wants your 'wedding night bliss'? Let go of me!"she snapped.


She was nearly livid. How could this man be so domineering and shameless? Anyone else would have taken the hint and left, but he seemed to thrive on the challenge.


And what annoyed her even more was the fleeting tension and excitement she felt earlier. What was that all about?


Malcolm enjoyed watching her bristle. She was always so calm and collected in front of others, never letting anyone affect her emotions. It was eerily composed for someone in her twenties.


He wondered what she had gone through to temper her personality so, as if it had been forgedI over centuries.


Suddenly, he was overcome with the desire to know about her past, to understand what she had endured.


Malcolm wasn't in a hurry. After all, she wasn't going anywhere now that she was in his grasp.


He released her but was careful to avoid her hitting the sharp corner of the bedside table, Reese,thinking he was making another move on her, pushed him away.


"Malcolm, how long has it been since you've been with a woman?" she asked, skeptical. "Darling. I've encountered countless women," he replied with a chuckle, "but someone as intriguing as you? Never."


His smnile reached his eyes, which had a restrained intensity that was unexpectedly alluring.


Reese internally scoffed. Life wasn't fair. Not only was he born handsome, but he was also so smooth-talking she could barely resist.


This man, she supposed, was a force to be reckoned with.


She had no interest in further conversation; once the affair at hand was dealt with, she was going to rest.


Once Reese was ready, she began inserting the needle.Malcolm watched her hands and the profile of her face, stern rather than soft, with bright, spirited eyes. She must have been a woman of strong convictions.


He couldn't help but think about the scene at the hotel earlier, where Henry Kim cursed at her through gritted teeth. Malcolm secretly wished he could watch a replay of that moment.


"Did that Henry Kim cause you any trouble today?"Malcolm inquired.


Reese paused her needlework slightly, glancing up at him with her beautiful, puzzled eyes. "How did you know about that?"


But then, in the next second, she had an epiphany.


"Did you break Henry Kim's leg?" she asked.


"Mmm-hmm." He wouldn't let anyone bully his girl. She was under his protection.


As long as she was someone Malcolm looked after, no one could lay a finger on her.


Reese rolled her eyes at him, "That was unnecessary.Even without you breaking his leg, I could have had him bedridden in the hospital for weeks."


She lowered her head and continued with her acupuncture, clearly distracted. Despite her outward bravado, she was inwardly moved. It was like someone was willing to shelter her with their own wings.


The idea of someone standing up for her, of someone being afraid of her getting hurt, warmed her chilled heart like a caressing flame.


Malcolm's eyes softened, the corners of his lips curling slightly.


"But now, he'll be staying in the hospital for a month."


Reese fell silent, a rare occurrence. Usually, she'd have a biting retort for Malcolm's meddling, but she found herself not only comfortable with his kindness but also longing for it.


For the first time since she could remember, apart from Calvin and his crowd,someone had gone out of their way to help and protect her. It was a bizarre yet magical feeling.


Reese, lost in her thoughts, managed only a couple more pricks before losing interest. She stood up.


"Let's call it a day." Malcolm frowned and, as she turned to leave, reached out to pull her wrist, drawing her back into his embrace. Reese felt her ire rising, compounded by the turmoil in her heart and Malcolm's previous advantages, and was ready to lash out.


But then he cradled her face in his hands, his eyes brimming with tenderness, his voice low and patient


"Are you angry?"


Reese stubbornly tried to turn away,but she couldn't move. She remained defiant.


"No, I don't get angry over trivial people or things."


Because they're not worth it.


Malcolm lifted his warm palm, gently and soothingly stroking her hair.


"Don't be upset, darling. A touch will make it all better."
###Chapter 66 Tender and Passionate Kisses

Reese was stunned, his hand softly caressing the crown of her head, his voice enchantingly sweet,almost like consoling a child.


A shadow of unpleasant memories flickered across her heart, shifting the color on her face.


Malcolm noticed she was somewhere else in her mind and saw a hint of loss in the depths of her eyes. He felt an inexplicable ache for this girl-so outwardly tough, yet so fragile within.


Reese,head bowed, suddenly felt a finger under her chin, lifting her gaze to meet his deep,mysterious eyes. Then something soft pressed against her lips. The room's cold, white light accentuated Malcolm's features, with his thick lashes framing his dark.intense eyes that glimmered with specks of light.


Reese's heart trembled once more, her body heat climbing, engulfed by his scorching breath.


Her mind went blank in that moment, succumbing to the tenderness of his kiss.


They were inches apart, trapped in an increasingly warm, dreamlike haze.


Then his lips brushed her ear, his voice low and husky, like a siren's call, "Honey, don't worry,from now on, darling will take great care of you."


Reese's world exploded like a fireball had struck her.She opened her eyes wide,questioning her recent actions. What had he done to her?!


Sensing Reese snap back to reality, Malcolm quickly let go, and she scrambled away from him, their eyes suddenly frosty.


"Malcolm, do I need to show you I mean business?Stop calling me 'wife' and don't you dare kiss me again!"


She began to question herself-was her brain malfunctioning? Had she not come to her senses,who knows how far things might have gone.


Reese was starting to doubt whether helping him regain the use of his legs was a blessing or a curse.Even now, he didn't miss an opportunity to tease her.


If he fully recovered, she feared becoming a sitting duck for him. The thought alone made Reese shiver. No, she had to put a stop to this.


Malcolm,on the other hand, touched his lips,seemingly lingering on the moment, his look suggestively charming rather than repulsive.


This was maddening.


"So,if I can't call you 'wife', what should I call you?'Baby' or 'dear'-just tell me, and I'll make sure you're pleased," he teased.


Reese was at her wit's end. Couldn't this man maintain a shred of dignity? Weren't her words clear enough?


It seemed words wouldn't suffice; it was time for action.

Determination gleamed in her eyes as she reached for the needle in her hand, ready to jab at him...


A glint of cunning flickered in Malcolm's eyes. As Reese lunged with the needle, he seized her wrists in a flash, the sharp point mere millimeters from his eyeball.


Reese was infuriated by her powerlessness. How could this man be so skilled, as if he could anticipate her every move?


She pushed harder with the hand holding the needle,brows knit in frustration. Malcolm suddenly flashed a mischievous grin.


"Sweetheart, that's quite heartless. If I went blind, I'd miss gazing at your beautiful face."


Her resolve wavering, Reese knew she was outmatched. Dropping her hands, she huffed dismissively.


"Don't think I can't handle you. I helped you get back on your feet, and I can just as easily take you down again."


If she couldn't beat him in a fair game, who said she couldn't play dirty?


But Malcolm wasn't intimidated. Leaning casually against the headboard, he replied with a half-smile.


"If I were to lie down again, well, then you'd just have to wait to divorce me until I was back on my feet."


Reese snorted in disdain. "You think you're invincible?Go ahead, try me. Let's see if I can't walk right out of the Flynn family's door."
What she wanted to do, no one could stop; what she didn't want to do, no one could force.


"Isn't it good here? Food, drink, and my tender care.Who would take care of you out there?"


His words carried weight, and Reese couldn't help but replay their recent kiss in her head. She was still reeling from it, nearly losing her composure.


Feeling flushed with embarrassment, she bit her lip.How could he be so conceited?


Reese realized she couldn't bear to spend another night under the same roof with him.


"I'm going to sleep in the guest room."


She brushed off the prior coniversation, not asking for his opinion, merely informing him.


Malcolm's handsome face showed no sign of concern,as if Reese had just told him a joke.


Seeing no objection from Malcolm, Reese turned and left the room.


As the door slammed, Malcolm's interest deepened.


"What a fiery little thing," he murmured with a smirk.


Alyssa, having recently washed away her humiliation,was grateful to Reese, who came through in a clutch.Otherwise, Alyssa's career in live broadcasting might have been over before it even began.


Cheerfully gearing up for a drink of water, Alyssa bumped into Reese storming out with a dark expression.


"What's the matter, master? Did my Malcolm upset you?"


Reese had checked the guest room earlier, finding it bare, not even a bedsheet in sight, and nothing in the wardrobe. How could she possibly sleep there?


The thought of returning to his room was suddenly repelling; his own teasing mind the culprit, speculating what might unfold in the solitary dark.


Seeing Alyssa, an idea sparked to life.


"I'm crashing in your room tonight."


Alyssa blinked, not opposed to the company-especially today, after Reese had served her a slice of sweet revenge, vanquishing the so-called national champion Angela, and raking in thousands of new fans for her.


A swell of pride inflated her chest at the thought.


On a usual day, had Reese suggested bunking with her, the offer would've been shut down with a side of sarcasm. But not today...


Except...


"Don't you usually bunk with Malcolm? If he finds out you spent the night in my room, I'm as good as dead by morning."


The mere thought of Malcolm's cold, dangerous glare sent shivers down her spine. She was practically walking head-on into peril. "I got your back," Reese assured her, thumping her chest confidently.


Alyssa shot her a skeptical look. "Oh please, you're new to the Flynn fammily. If Malcolm gets ticked off,you can sense his fury from a mile away without him saying a word, and I'd rather not risk it."


Though Alyssa was truly grateful for Reese's help today,challenging Malcolm was overstepping her courage.


Reese wasn't fazed, brimming with schemes to persuade Alyssa.


"Let's make a deal. You name a condition, and in exchange, I get to sleep in your room."

Her mind was set; nothing would compel her to share a roof with Malcolm tonight, in fear of tearing it down in a fit of rage.


Alyssa pondered, her eyes glinting mischievously. All those new fans demanded she stream "Arena of Valor"nightly. The problem? She couldn't fake the skill of the player who'd won the fans over.


Impersonation was one thing, but gaming skill was another. If her new followers glimpsed her true,less impressive abilities, her prestige would crumble.


Running out of patience and overwhelmed by sleepiness, Reese pressed,"Decided?"


"Okay, I got it-a condition."


Reese scoffed, "No matter what it is, I might not  agree." "Just play a match of 'Arena of Valor'for my stream every night, and I'll let you stay."


Alyssa calculated the potential gain of fans if Reese stepped in-this deal was a sure win.


"A week," Reese countered.


A week wasn't enough for Alyssa; her brow furrowed.Once the week was up, she'd have to play herself-wasted effort.
###Chapter 67 Apparently, She Likes That Position

Reese sneered, "I won't agree to anything you ask."


"Just stream one game of 'Arena of Valor' for me every night, and you've got yourself a deal."


Alyssa's mind was buzzing with the prospect of Reese pulling in more fans for her. It was a gamble she couldn't lose.


"One week," Reese bargained.


"A week? No way." Alyssa's frown deepened. After a week, if she took over, it'd all be for naught.


"It's completely unreasonable to expect me to stream for you every single day just because I crashed in your room for one night," Reese retorted, feeling a bit cornered. Alyssa was all about good deals, never letting herself be on the losing end of a bargain.


Alyssa awkwardly scratched her head, seeming to recognize the logic in Reese's argument. "Fine," she conceded,"You help me with the streaming for a week, and I'll figure something else out after that." She was clearly playing for time.


"Let's caIl it a night then," Reese yawned, visibly exhausted by the day's events.


Neither Reese nor Alyssa wwas used to sharing a bed,and that night they each clung to their own blanket,leaving a wide gap down the middle of the king-sized bed. Reese wasn't particular about where she slept;any spot was fair game for her to catch some shut-eye.


Curiosity kept Alyssa up for a bit, wanting to engage Reese in a bit of late-night chatter. "You know, you seem to have a real knack for gaming. I'm surprised you don't have a stronger educational background.What's your story?"


Reese's info was full of fabrications-her true history remained a mystery to most, even to the likes of Calvin who were unaware of just how little she couldn't handle. Once she set her mind to something,she'd go through hell or high water to get it done.


"Got too caught up in playing games to bother with school," Reese replied nonchalantly, barely giving it a thought as she gave Alyssa the brush-off.


Alyssa pondered over Reese's exceptional gameplay earlier that night and mumbled to herself. "Guess that makes sense. If you'd been all about the books, would you still be gaming like a champ? But, why aren't you crashing with Malcolm tonight? What, did he give you the cold shoulder or something?" After a barrage of questions went unanswered, Alyssa turned to find, to her amazement, Reese had already succumbed to sleep. Wow, knocked out in a flash!


In the dead of the night, Reese felt an unsettling presence inching closer, the air carrying a familiar scent. Suddenly awake, she swung around, her hand ready to strike at the intruder.


But he caught her wrist with ease, his deep-set eyes glimmering with a hint of amusement in the darkness."Malcolm!" she exclaimed, her foot flying up instinctively towards him.


Malcolm,anticipating the move, held her ankle firm,his eyes twinkling playfully. "Sweetheart, you wouldn't want to damage the goods. That would ruin your happiness," he teased.


Fury flared up in Reese's eyes as she spat out, "Shameless!" Shoving him aside, she jumped out of bed and flicked on the light. The room, once shrouded in darkness, was abruptly flooded with brightness.
Malcolm lay on the bed, squinting against the sudden glare.


"These lights are blinding compared to the ones in our room," he muttered, still adjusting to the light.


Reese stood by the bed, grabbed her jacket, and slipped it on, her brow knitted as she watched the calm figure before her.


"Malcolm, what on earth are you doing in my room in the middle of the night?" Reese's tone was exasperated but tinged with curiosity.


"You're my wife. It's not comfortable sleeping without you next to me," Malcolm retorted with a playful twinkle in his eye, a sly smile playing across his face. Reese's gaze swept the room, "Where's Alyssa?"


"She's downstairs in the living room gaming with some friends," Malcolm replied, his voice light and his demeanor radiating positive energy.


Speechless,Reese knew she should've never trusted Alyssa. Ever since they were kids, Alyssa was so easily intimidated by Malcolm-a stern look from him was all it took to fold. Reese felt betrayed.


All Reese had wanted was some peace and quiet,to be alone in her room and get some sleep, especially since she was feeling a bit off today. That Malcolm had managed to rile her up to this extent was unprecedented.


"I'm giving you two minutes to get out!" she said firmly, pointing to the door. Her usually serene and refined face now set in a mask of frosty resolve. Initially, Reese had thought Malcolm was as cold and arrogant as she was-which would mean minimal social interaction between them. Turned out,he was quite different in private.


If it weren't for her determination to clinch the Flynn Group project, she would have left already, making sure the Flynn family couldn't trace her whereabouts.


With a fluid movement, Malcolm turned and sat in front of her. He reached out to guide her waist down,and Reese instinctively pushed to resist, surprised by his strength. Amidst their tussle, Reese stumbled on something, her body involuntarily leaning forward,landing on top of him.


Panic flickered in Reese's clear,bright eyes.


Wasn't she rejecting him? How did she end up on top  of him, in such an awkward position? Her heartbeat kicked up a notch.


Malcolm cradled her waist and let out a suppressed cough,which seemed suspiciously like a stifled laugh,then hummed meaningfully, "So the wife likes this position,hm?"


Reese's cheeks flamed as red as ripe tomatoes, her neck stiff as she shot back, "I don't like this position.Let go of me, Malcolm!"


"I can't do that. If I let go, you'll start fighting with me again, and if you get hurt, Darling, I'd be distressed."


His voice was a low, pleasant rumble, and with the flicker of a smnile in the corner of his eyes, he looked as devilishly charming as ever.


Reese felt like her head was about to explode. She had met her nemesis, her inner turmoil roiling. Anyone else would have been sent packing by now but here he was, shamelessly flirting with her.


"Malcolm, did you bring Master back to her room? I'm coming in," called a voice from the other side of the door.


Alyssa had barely finished speaking when she pushed open the door and walked in, only to find two people wrapped in an awkward embrace.


She quickly averted her gaze, her voice a mix of excitement and surprise.


"How can you two be doing this in my room?"


Reese,nnoticing Alyssa's arrival, hurriedly pushed Malcolm away. This time he let go. Reese smoothed her clothing and considered that if she didn't return to her own room today, Malcolm wouldn't let the matter
rest.


Continuing to sleep in Alyssa's room seemed pointless;she was a traitor, one who needed no bribes from Malcolm to betray.


She stood and headed straight for the door, but paused as she passed Alyssa. Unaware of Reese's close presence, Alyssa felt a chill run through her body as if encased in ice, trembling-until Reese's calm, cool voice broke the silence.


"Our deal is off."


Alyssa's face fe1l, and she reached out, pleading with Reese.


"Please, don't abandon me, Teacher. How will I ever explain it to all my fans?" "That's your problem." Reese disliked those who broke promises. Since Alyssa had violated their deal first,
Reese felt no obligation to meet her commitments to Alyssa.


Alyssa didn't dare to intercept further,fearful of getting lost in that piercing gaze again.


Ultimately, when Malcolm arrived, Alyssa had no choice but to beg him-her last lifeline.


"Malcolm, I'm begging you, please talk to your wife for me. I've already promised my fans. If I break my word, they'll definitely unfollow me."
###Chapter 68 Let My Wife Sleep More


Malcolm's voice was cool and distant, his thick brows arched, his deep and alluring eyes emanating a sense of danger.


"I haven't even dealt with you for kidnapping my wife, and now you dare ask for my help?"


Alyssa was stunned, unable to reconcile the gentle Malcolm she had just seen with the intimidating figure before her.


In front of Reese, he had been gentle as a lamb,careful with his tone, but with Alyssa, he seemed indifferent. Were they still family at all?


After Malcolm left, Alyssa was still in shock, her mind reeling. She had tried to assist them both, so why did she end up feeling like she couldn't do anything right? She tugged at her hair in irritation, muttering to herself about the day's complexities.


"What are these two up to?"


And Malcolm, he wasn't like this before. Why did it suddenly feel like he had become a completely different person?


Reese retreated to her room and tucked herself into bed, wrapping the covers tight to ward off any possibility of Malcolm disturbing her sanctuary.


Malcolm wasn't in the mood to tease her anymore. It was late, and all he wanted was for Reese to get some sleep. If the servants or Grandpa found out she was still awake at this hour, they'd definitely scold her.


That girl had a fiery temper. The word 'yield' just wasn't in her vocabulary. When it came to doing what she wanted or saying what was on her mind, not even the Almighty could stop her.


Malcolm wondered if her stubbornness was a blessing or a curse. At her age, shouldn't she need someone to protect her? Yet she seemed to need no protection,tough as nails.


Switching off the light, Malcolm turned to her and said,“Goodnight,sweetheart."


Reese ignored him on purpose. Engaging him now would only wind her up, and she wasn't up for that.


The next morning, Malcolm was having breakfast in the dining hall when Finn Sawyer asked him,
"Where's Reese?"


"Still asleep," he replied. Finn Sawyer's face darkened instantly. "What time is it, and she's still in bed? Sandra,go wake her up, will you?"


"Yes, sir," Sandra said, turning to head upstairs, but Malcolm suddenly called out to stop her.


"Let it be. Let my wife sleep in. She had a rough night."


Finn Sawyer: "..."


Everyone at the table looked at Malcolm with astonished eyes, and Sandra stood frozen, unable to believe that these words had come from the master himself.


Alyssa was also stunned. Wow - Malcolm's voice was so tender when he spoke those words, it sent warm ripples through her heart.
She wouldn't have guessed that Malcolm,usually so reserved, could be so smooth with romantic talk. She wondered if her own defenses could hold up against his charm.


Finn Sawyer was just as incredulous. Reese had married into the family not long ago, and she'd already transformed his grandson. In all his seventy or eighty years, he had never heard Malcolm speak with such a tone. It was always all business,every conversation strict and serious.


Yet with Reese, he was unbelievably tender.


Overhearing this, Everly felt a surge of anger.


"Brother, aren't you spoiling that girl too much?" she fumed."The Flynn family has never tolerated late risers. Why should the rules be broken for her? What gives her the right?""Because I say so," Malcolm responded with confidence.“She's my wife now. Don't I have the right to let her sleep a little longer? Unless you can find me an exact replacement if she's not well-rested?"


"Brother, you... you used to dislike her so much,"Everly hissed, her face flushed with anger and at a loss for words. "She's plain, without a family background, not good enough for you!"


Everly was so visibly upset, words seemed to fail her,but it was clear-she was infuriated.


Malcolm bristled at the comment as if a raw nerve had been struck, his dark eyes ablaze with an icy hostility."Whether or not someone is worthy isn't for you to decide-it's my call," he declared with a steely resolve.To Malcolm, it mattered not whether the person he chose was good or bad, beautiful or plain; he was committed to the person, not their exterior shell. His time with Reese was genuinely comforting, and that was all the justification he needed.


Meanwhile,Reese descended the stairs, having overheard the conversation above. Malcolm had stood up for her in front of Grandpa Flynn, setting ripples across the calm pond of her heart, albeit momentarily.However, her emotions were not so easily swayed.


She wasn't about to be seduced by Malcolm's smooth talk and glib charm.


Alyssa, sharp-eyed, noticed Reese's arrival and hurried to greet her with excessive eagerness. "You're up, sis!Come, I saved you breakfast. It's still warm." Alyssa guided Reese to sit beside her and even started to peel a boiled egg for her.


Everly watched in disbelief, questioning if the Flynns had suddenly become a bunch of quirky characters. First, it was Malcolm; now Alyssa joined in.


Everly stood up, her gaze burning with annoyance."What has gotten into everyone today? Has this brat fed you some kind of love potion?"


It was odd enough with Malcolm, but Alyssa, who famously disliked Reese, was suddenly doting over the 'brat? What on earth was happening?


Alyssa quirked an eyebrow, "To be hones,sis is pretty alright. We just got her wrong before." She narrowed her eyes endearingly at Reese and passed her the peeled egg. "Eat this for now, I can peel more if you want."


Unbeknownst to the others, Reese knew exactly what Alyssa was up to. She wanted Reese's help with gaming, especially since yesterday's agreement no longer stood. Nevertheless, Reese had made promises
to her fans and wasn't one to go back on her word.


The egg might be Alyssa's way of apologizing,but it didn't mean Reese was ready to forgive. Unreliable people grated on her, and she steered clear of them.
Otherwise,she couldn't count the number of times she would've been betrayed.


"No need, one is enough." Reese's response was cool and nonchalant, her demeanor unchanged despite Alyssa's newfound enthusiasm.


"Okay, okay," Alyssa replied, not offended in the least but rather compliant with Reese's wishes.


Finn Sawyer was starting to feel uneasy about the situation. Despite Reese being somewhat out of her league marrying into the Flynn family-a small and tightly-knit group - now both Alyssa and Malcolm seemed to have switched sides, showing a conspicuous favoritism towards her.


If things kept on like this, Reese might soon surpass his own standing and start calling the shots in the Flynn household.


With a gentle cough to announce his seriousness,Finn said to Malcolm,"Follow me for a sec."


Before leaving, Malcolm didn't forget to hand over his portion of eggs to Reese.


"Here, honey, eat up," he said warmly.


Alyssa pouted in protest,“Bro, aren't you playing favorites? Just now you wouldn't even share your eggs with me."


"What do you need extra nutrition for with all that gaming you do every day?"


Alyssa fell silent, taken aback by the blatant
favoritism. However, who could blame them when Reese was so adept at gaming? She had looked it up online only yesterday and discovered that Reese had actually won the championship in the last Arena of Valor tournament.
###Chapter 69 Has Everyone Lost Their Minds?
Reese had only played in one public game and then vanished from the scene,yet the views on her impressive gameplay videos were skyrocketing.


Alyssa had initially just wanted to give it a try;although she was a novice, she could tell that Reese's play style and reflexes were no match for an average player. Reese's reaction time and her ability to anticipate the opponent's movements were those of a master, much to Alyssa's surprise.


She was now a confirmed fan of Reese and planned to have her as a mentor, hoping to someday experience what it felt like to compete at the national level.


As Alyssa mused on this, she poured Reese some milk,her smile broadening. "Sister-in-law, drink up," she offered cheerfully.


Reese cringed a bit at Alyssa's smile, feeling a wave of goosebumps


Standing up, unable to take the cloying atmosphere any longer, Reese announced, “I should get going."


"I'll walk you out, sis. We're almost late as it is,"Alyssa promptly replied.


Hearing Reese was leaving, Alyssa stuffed the rest of her eggs into her mouth and hurried to follow.


Everly, witnessing the scene, was livid, her face contorting with rage.


"All of you have gone mad,fussing over some backwoods girl as if she's the next best thing,"Everly ered.


Back in the study, Finn Sawyer's face was grave, a hint of anger lurking as he turned to Malcolm and accused,“Did you just ignore my words last time?She's just a girl you married for luck. If she hadn't claimed she could heal your leg, I'd have had the two of you divorced already. And yet here you are, taking hèr side at every turn. How does that look to our staff? You're the heir to the Flynn family and here you are, indulging a woman like a spoiled fool!"


Unruffled, Malcolm's voice held a firm resolve as if he'd had the words atthe ready. "Grandpa, if Reese is the one who can heal my leg, then we, the Flynn family,owe it to her to treat her right. If word gets around that I'm not standing up for her, how do you think that will look?"


"I'm not saying you can't defend her," his grandpa responded measuredly, "butyou need to keep things in perspective. Our family rules can't be thrown into disarray by someone from outside."


Turning the age-old family rules on its head because of a young girl was inconceivable to him. How would he face his ancestors if such a thing came to pass?


Yet the anger flashed in Malcolm's eyes, sharp as the sunlight streaming through the window.


"I don't want to have to tell you again, Grandpa. Now that Reese is my wife, she's a member of the Flynn family. Once my leg is healed, we'll be trying for a child," Malcolm declared, his cold demeanor unchanged.


Finn Sawyer's eyes widened. "You want to have kids with her? A backwoods girl who's clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed and has a temper to boot?No telling what the kid will turn out like." "Grandpa, don't let me hear you talk like that again.And certainly, don't let my wife hear it."


Malcolm's gaze returned sharper than before, piercing as the sun.


Finn Sawyer cared about Malcolm's well-being too much to keep needling him. Malcolm was stubborn;once he set his mind on someone or something,it was almost impossible to sway him.


There was one more card up his sleeve, though, that he hadn't played yet.


Alyssa drove up just then and spotted Reese by the roadside,pressing down on the accelerator eagerly.


"Sis-in-law, hop in! Let me take you for a drive." "It's work hours; who has time for joyrides?" thought Reese. Miss Third must've grown up quite pampered to not understand the struggles of the working class.


Despite her own comfortable financial situation, Reese wasn't about to let herself be docked pay for not showing up.


Alyssa parked the car and approached to tug at Reese but the gesture was neatly sidestepped.


She noticed Reese's look of distaste and paused,puzzled. "What's the matter with you?"


Reese replied coolly, "I'm not fond of people touching me."


Alyssa asked awkwardly,"Do you have social anxiety,or is it something psychological?" She even made a sensitive g esture to soften the inquiry, But Reese had read Alyssa's thoughts from the get-go.


"If I had social anxiety, you'd have noticed by now,"she retorted with an edge.


Alyssa shrugged. "Seems that way. Your wit cuts deeper than most."


"If you're heading that way, you can drop me at the office."


Reese wasn't in the mood for a leisurely drive; she had plans to stop by the office today to see if she could pry some information from the higher-ups at the Flynn Group about that project.


The thing about the Flynn Group was, whenever they had a new project, secrecy was the name of the game.Unless you were part of the project's inner circle, you were in the dark.She had to tread carefully, though. If Malcolm got even a whiff of her snooping, he'd leave no stone unturned investigating her, and by the time the dust settled, it might be too late even to consider a divorce as an escape.


Alyssa felt powerless around Reese. She had a hunch that any attempt to drive Reese somewhere else would backfire with a fierce argument, derailing the plans even further.


"Fine, I'll take you to the office," Alyssa resigned, "And hey,if you need cash, just get Malcolm to give you a credit card. Save you from counting pennies every time you shop."


"He did." Reese replied, her voice distant. The card had been lying untouched in the drawer of her nightstand. "Good to hear. Now, sis, buy whatever you want, don't worry about pinching pennies for Malcolm's sake."


"Mhm." Reese responded absently. Her mind was busy weaving strategies to extract the location of the project's plans from the executives-just a glimpse could be enormously beneficial to her.


Alyssa caught a glimpse of Reese in the rearview mirror-sitting in the back seat, brows furrowved,gaze vacant, exuding an intense sharpness that seemed to be lost in thought.


There was an uncommon edge to Reese's allure that set her apart from other women-a poised beauty with an underlying keenness.


Stunning indeed, but those eyes, those eyes seemed to hide a multitude of secrets-impenetrable,ungraspable,Alyssa was curious about what kind of life could sharpen a girl's gaze like that, but her contemplations were cut short as she turned her attention to her own pressing matters.


"Um... about that favor with the live streaming,"
Alyssa ventured again, "could you reconsider? I'm willing to trade it for any condition."


Reese was no longer surprised by Alyssa bringing this up again. Having been raised with privilege and a strong sense of self, and after having a rare moment of self-satisfaction the previous evening,it was understandable how distressed she would be with the threat of being exposed.


Still, Reese loathed people who broke their promises.


She offered no response. Desperation growing, Alyssa was nearly at the point of begging on her knees. "Please, please give it another thought. I swear, I'll never break my promise again.Whatever you say goes-without you joining, I can't save face. I'm counting on a winner like you to take me under your wing."


Reese raised a querying brow. "Since when did I
bècome a champion?"


Sure, wasn't it? A couple of years back, weren't you competing in that international tournament? I even have the video clip right here."
###Chapter 70 It's Reese, not Rose


Alyssa's head was spinning, courtesy of Reese. She was sure she had seen her clearly. There could be no mistake,could there?


She quickly pulled out her phone and showed it to Reese.


"Look, isn't this your name?"


"She does go by Reese, but it's Reese,not Rose."


"Wait, what?” Alyssa blinked in disbelief. Was she getting that old, mistaking names now?


She leaned in closer and almost cursed out loud. It really was Reese, not Rose. But just yesterday she had clearly seen Reese's name, and wasn't there even a video of her?


"Look, that right there is obviously you." Alyssa was adamant about not being wrong.


"The person in this footage doesn't even show their face clearly. Besides, if I had competed in a world championship, I'd definitely be boasting about it to you.”


Reese laid it out like it was the most natural thing in the world.


Alyssa paused,almost convinced by Reese's ruse.


"That does sound like you. With your insufferable arrogance, if you had ever made it to the global stage.you'd have rubbed it in my face to show off," she mused. Reese said nothing further; over-explaining would only fuel Alyssa's suspicions.


When the car stopped in front of the company, Reese stepped out and saw a man emerging - if she remembered correctly, he was one of the project leads.He'd bring new proposals or refined documents daily,but the Flynn Group was strict about their protocols.


He stood guard by the data room every day,allowing no one near the core files of the Flynn Group.


She cast a glance at the troubled Alyssa, whose bright eyes briefly flickered.


Stepping out of the car, Alyssa heard Reese call out to her.


"I'm willing to trust you one more time, but you've got to do me a favor." Alyssa perked up at Reese's offer to help again,
nodding eagerly.


"Say the word, sis. Whatever it is, I'Il go through fire and brimstone for you."


"It's nothing big. That guy who just came out,a friend of mine wants to have lunch with him. Could you set it up for noon?”


Reese nodded towards the direction the man had gone.


Alyssa glanced that way, feeling a bit awkward.


"That friend of yours has quite a taste for older guys.Plus, he's got a family. We shouldn't be meddling in his personal life, right?” "We're not trying to steal someone's affection.She's just heard that he's quite skilled and wants to see if he can give her company a competitive edge."


"Oh, so that's the situation. But the guy is in charge of the data vault every day. It won't be easy to get him out."


Alyssa hesitated. After all, this was an important figure in the company. If she managed to spirit him away,
Malcolm would chop her head off if he found out.


Reese didn't seem in a rush, arms crossed and looking completely indifferent.


"It's okay. If you don't want to help, I won't force you.You can handle your live broadcast tonight on your own."


With those words, Reese turned and strode towards office.


"Wait, wait, sis!" Alyssa hurried after Reese,reaching for her sleeve, then suddenly remembering Reese wasn't keen on being touched. She withdrew her hand immediately.


Reese turned around, her expression as still as calm waters,seemingly unfazed by such matters.


"It's up to you. I'm just helping out someone else."


She said it with such indifference to avoid Malcolm getting suspicious if the plan were to backfire.


"Alright, I'll do it, But you gotta have my back,sis.
Otherwise, I'm doomed."


She had made a promise in front of millions of followers.Failure to deliver would make her the laughingstock of the livestreaming world.


"Don't worry. I won't break my promise like you,"Reese retorted casually.


Alyssa felt embarrassed, especially recalling MalcoIm's commanding presence and piercing gaze that nearly scared her to death.


"Talk to me at noon. I'll come down as soon as I'm done,"


With an hour for lunch, she should have enough time.She planned to have Calvin and the others remotely monitor the situation. It shouldn't be a problem.


Reese already had a plan in mind. At lunchtime, the other coworkers headed to the cafetería or out to eat. Reese made a quick stop in the bathroom to make sure it was empty.


Then she called Calvin.


"Can you hack into the surveillance of the Flynn Group?"


"I... uh, I'll have to try. I almost got caught last time.If it hadn't been for your swift action, boss, I would have been spotted."


Calvin was familiar with the Flynn Group's system.It was tough to crack, and their security was top-notch.He could have been discovered even before breaking in.


It was a tough job, avoiding their watchful eyes,made tougher by the limited time. Only Reese could handle such high-level maneuvers.
Calvin was just an amateur who'd learned a few trick<S.


Reese was close to cursing him out. "I've always told you to study hard, but you insist on fiddling with video game software companies. Now when I need you,you let me down!"


"I'm on it right now, boss. Go over the program with me one more time."


"You better remember, or you're toast!" Reese warned.


She then loaded Calvin with a barrage of jargon. He got it, sure, but the real fear was screwing up when it was game time.


"Boss, you're seriously my hero. How do you figure all this stuff out?" "If I didn't have at least that much skill, how could I be calling the shots? Now chop chop, I'm pressed for time."


After hanging up, Reese left the bathroom and made a beeline for the records room, texting Alyssa as she walked.


You get our guy at the front?


Yeah,he's out.


Talk to him, see if he bites. I'm heading down soon.


With Alyssa on it, Reese paired her Bluetooth to catch up with Calvin.


"You got everything squared away? I'm two minutes out from the records room. That floor's cameras need
to be dead."


"It's almost done," came the rapid-fire tapping of keys on Calvin's end.


Reese neared the door: "I'm heading in."


"Done, but you've got ten minutes, tops. I can't cover you longer. And the exit's on you. If you get nabbed,it's all over."


"Just focus on your part," Reese responded as she scanned the corridor before slipping out the device she'd prepared beforehand, designed to unlock doors by fingerprint. Staff fingerprints were easy pickings,but Malcolm's were the real prize. And she'd had enough interaction wwith him to lift his print without hassle.


The door clicked open. A smirk played on Reese's lips as she slipped inside,scoping out the room. Her eyes landed on a nondescript cabinet under a table, conveniently placed for quick access.


Approaching,she spotted a blinking red light. To anyone else, it'd seem like a standard signal device.


But she knew better-it was a sophisticated camera,designed to blend in, indistinguishable from a network signal light to the untrained eye.


That had to be it.


She retrieved a prepped white cloth from her pocket and covered the camera. Now, even if Malcolm suspected an intrusion, he'd be clueless as to who or how.


###Chapter 71 My Sister-in-law Has Disappeared
Cracking the safe turned out to be a Herculean task.Its digital keypad boasted an unusual lock-one that Reese had rarely encountered. But what really threw a wrench in the works was its requirement for facial recognition.


Where in the world was she supposed to get facial recognition? Reese thought, irritated at the thought of smashing the stubborn device to bits.


On the other end of the line, Calvin's voice came through with a sense of urgency, "Boss, you gotta hurry it up. I can't hold them off much longer. They're starting to take measures, and if things don't switch back soon, they'll send someone to check."


Reese's fingers flew over the numeric keys-those shecould guess--but the facial recognition was a hurdle she couldn't clear. After three failed attempts, she knew the alarm would blare. And then, Calvin's efforts would all be for naught.


As if on cue, Alyssa's call came through at the worst possible moment.


"Sis, please hurry it up. I've got your guy all lined up,"came Alyssa's voice.


"Almost done, Just... battling a bit of a stomach bug.Give me a few more minutes," Reese replied,already abandoning the facial recognition feat. Without Malcolm's face, the safe was impenetrable.


Her only option was to dismantle it. From the lining of her jacket, she extracted an array of neatly packed miniature tools-custom-made by Calvin. Small, yes,but ridiculously expensive-each worth the price of a 
car.


Moments passed with no word from Alyssa,leaving Reese to wonder if she had hung up.


"You still there?"


"Brother, what... what are you doing here?" Reese's voice faltered, now disguised as Alyssa's. "I was just...just asking him about something. We misplaced a document in our department, and I was hoping he could come up and help us look."


A sinking feeling gripped Reese. Alyssa had the worst luck; she seemed to bump into MalcoIm everywhere.


She swiftly hung up to quash any suspicion, her movements becoming even more frantic. Calvin's voice crackled with urgency, "Boss, it looks like Malcolm's heading toward the archive room.
You've got to move fast; I can only give you two more minutes."


"Stop nagging me," snapped Reese.


Calvin's incessant chatter only heightened her irritation. Annoyed, she ripped off her Bluetooth earpiece,sweat gathering on her brow and her complexion turning pale.


If Malcolm caught her, she would have no other option but to leave the Flynn family. She wouldn't just lose her chance to uncover the truth about her grandmother's death, but she'd likely wind up behind bars,courtesy of Malcolm's charges.


This lock was a beast-the toughest Reese had ever encountered. But when her stubborn streak kicked in, there was no stopping her. Today, she was determined to crack this thing.


"Welcome,master. Welcome, master," a synthetic robotic voice greeted her.


Reese couldn't help but be slightly amused.This gadget had a few tricks up its sleeve.


She hastily snatched the documents from inside and began to scan them, her hands moving so fast,they were almost a blur.


She paused on one file named "Shoal Bay," bingo,that's what she was after.


However, she couldn't take it with her. It'd be too easy to get caught. She flicked through the pages and committed the gist to memory. Suddenly,Justn Chabon's voice erupted from the doorway.


"Mr. Flynn, we've had another system breach that we just contained. No suspicious activity was detected,though.”


"Let's make sure the files are still there."


Reese's face paled as she watched the door to the records room swing open...


"Any trace of who did it?" Malcolm's handsome brow was marked by a brooding presence.


"Not yet. The timing was meticulous, and it seems the breach was just to disable the cameras on this floor.The tech team tried to restore them, but no luck." Justin Chabon and Malcolm entered.


Malcolm surveyed the room with his sharp gaze,finding no sign of intrusion. Justin led him to the desk,where Malcolm bent over to input a series of digits and engage facial recognition. The document cabinet unlocked.


Then, with a frown and an icy tone, he said,"Someone's been in here.”


Justin looked puzzled. “Really? Everything appears normal. Are we missing any files from the cabinet?"


"We'll see." Malcolm began to remove thefiles,with Justin assisting. Not a single document was missing.


Justin asked,"Mr. Flynn, could someone have copied something from the files?" "That's unlikely. This cabinet is specially designed to set off an alarm when it detects electronic devices, like phones, directly alerting our tech department."


Hidden in the shadows,Reese let out a quiet sigh of relief. Lucky for her, she hadn't used her phone for photos, or she'd be toast.


Malcolm certainly ran a tight ship when it came to security. Breaking through all those layers just to get to the files would be no small feat.


But now,how was she going to get out? The floor's surveillance had been restored; if she walked out in plain sight, the cameras would surely catch her.


Calvin had breached their system once already, and the Flynn Group's tech team would've doubled down on security by now. Another attempt by Calvin could lead to discovery. Justin appeared to be reassured as well: “Let's not overthink it, Mr. Flynn. Maybe our intruder came in,saw they couldn't open the cabinet or use their phone to take pictures, and left. It's the most logical explanation,"


"It's not like it could have memorized everything in just a few minutes. I've yet to see anyone with a memory like that, apart from you, Mr. Flynn, right?"


Following Malcolm for so many years,Justin Chabon had his reasons for being ready to walk through fire for him. Malcolm was a rare talent, his decisions often dazzling and bold. He dared to tackle what others shied away from, turning overlooked projects into gold.


Malcolm didn't see it that way, though:


"Don't jump the gun. There's always a bigger fish, and you never know. Have the tech team keep digging and try to restore the surveillance on this floor."


"Got it."


"I need to change clothes-I've got a client meeting."


"Sure."


Hearing Malcolm was about to change,Reese's heart tightened. She was hiding in the very closet he was about to open. What on earth would she say if he found her there?


She couldn't recall ever being cornered like this.Absolutely ridiculous.


Justin wheeled Malcolm towards the closet. Reese held her breath, her palms slick with sweat as she intently watched the door. If Malcolm pulled it open, her game was up. She braced herself to come clean.


The door slowly inched open with his movement,but then a commotion interrupted, followed by Alyssa's urgent voice.


"Brother, we've got trouble..."


Malcolm paused, his brows knitting together.


"Alyssa,how many times? You're a director here. Act like one, okay?"


Sure,it was only a title, but appearances mattered.


Alyssa was frantic: "But, brother, this is serious,You'll be more upset than me. I can't reach your wife, and she's missing."
###Chapter 72 Has Mr. Flynn Lost His Mind Over Madame?
At that, Malcolm's expression darkened a shade, his voice laced with severity.


"Could she have gone out?"


"No. I was supposed to have lunch with her because she said she had an upset stomach, so I waited downstairs. She never came down, and I even checked the bathroom-no sign of her,"


Alyssa carefully omitted her search for the document room to avoid her brother's probing


Malcolm turned to Justin Chabon, giving quick orders:


"Start a search party. Ask if any colleagues have seen Reese. If we can't find her, get everyone in the company on it."


Alyssa exchanged a look with Justin Chabon, their eyes wide with disbelief. Had Mr. Flynn completely lost his cool over Madam?


Calm had replaced Alyssa's earlier bluster. "Look,bro,you really don't need to get so worked up. Your wife's not a kid; she can handle herself. She'll be fine."


"It's my wife who's missing; of course, I'm freaked out." Malcolm's voice was laced with barely concealed urgenacy. When his piercing gaze swept over Alyssa,she shivered involuntarily.


Feeling like they were third wheels, Alyssa, and Justin couldn't help but feel a bit sour on the inside.


Alyssa volunteered her exit strategy."I'll go checksome other places for her. I'm out of here."


"Get your team to help with the search," Malcolm commanded in a deep tone.


Alyssa pouted, muttering to herself, "I'm already doing them a favor by looking. Now you want my crew to join the hunt? No way am I taking that hit to my pride."


Justin's eye twitched as he delicately offered a piece of advice to Malcolm. "Mr. Flynn, Madam will come back. Maybe we should keep a lid on the 'cold CEO'image. If word gets out you're whipped, it might dent your reputation."


"What do I care about others' opinions? Only my wife will be with me for life, Don't waste time here-get moving and find her." Malcolm was completely ensnared by thoughts of Reese; she was all he could see, all that was in his heart.


Justin nudged Malcolm, and they hurried out of the office. Reese waited until she heard the door close before she allowed herself to breathe a sigh of relief.


Yet, the words Malcolm had just uttered left her with an indescribable feeling in her heart. She had thought perhaps he had been nice to her only in hopes that she would heal his leg. But now, it seemed he truly saw her as his wife. And here she was,planning to leave as soon as she cleared up the mystery surrounding her grandmother.


Reese,who always followed her own path, suddenly found herself unsettled by someone else's words.


Silently, she pushed open the door to the cloakroom and made her way to Malcolm's desk.


Now it was up to her; if she just walked out and got caught on camera, no explanation would clear her name.


Shrugging helplessly, Reese thought to herself, "Sorry,Malcolm, looks like I've got to crash the Flynn Group's system on this floor... again."


While attempting the password, her first few tries were incorrect. Not Malcolm's birthday, nor his phone number, not those of Zhan Lin, Alyssa, or Everly worked.


She had run through all the possibilities to no avail.


With only one password attempt left, she gambled on it, punching in the numbers. To her astonishment, it clicked open.Malcolm had used her birthday as the password.Why would he do that?


But this was no time for questions. She had to move fast,to breach the next layer of security.


Reese was laser-focused, her fingers flying over the keyboard. In less than two minutes, the tech team at the Flynn Group noticed the fresh intrusion.


They scrambled to intercept, but Reese smirked with a sly satisfaction. Did they/ really think these amateurs could stop her?


The tech department was in disarray, forced to alert Malcolm.


Malcolm and Justin Chabon rushed over, radiating anger,with piercing eyes. “What happened?”


"Mr. Flynn, we've called in everyone from the tech team, but the attacker's evading skills are beyond us.We can hardly hold them off," a technician reported."They'll break through our defenses in under a minute.”


Justin Chabon was stunned, "Who could it be? Even with the best hackers in the world on our payroll,could it be someone from the earlier breach?"


"No, the person earlier had sloppy execution, likely inexperienced. But this one, if they get through our firewalls, it'd take the entire evening to recover. And if our rivals learn our system's compromised, they'll steal our secrets."


The situation was growing dire. The air around Malcolm grew icy as the tech department's tension mounted.


"Keep stalling," Malcolm ordered. "If they're after the surveillance on that floor, it means they're still on the seventeenth. Justin, secure that floor. Make sure no one gets out."


“Understood.”


Reese quickly caught on to their delay tactic. Malcolm must have figured her out.


She had to pick up the pace. But their little tricks wouldn't hold her back.


She crashed their system, then powered off and made her escape.
Just as she stepped into the elevator, she noticed someone had beat her to this floor. Malcolm was faster than she expected.


Glancing around, she bolted for the bathroom.


Malcolm and his team swept the floor, sparing no corner-not even the server room they had just secured. Malcolm felt the machine-it was still warm.


Justin Chabon saw the storm gathering in Mr. Flynn's expression.


"What's wrong,Mr.Flynn?"


"Did that person just hack into our company's system using this computer?"


Justin's face drained of color.′′Itslipped through our fingers, right under our noses?"


Malcolm's eyes gleamed with a dangerous intensity as he barked sharply, "What good is it to have you all here if someone can cripple our system right under your watch?"


Justin saw Malcolm's sudden outburst and instinctively shrank back, his voice lost in his throat.


Nothing like this had ever happened at their company;even when competitors had hired hackers to try to breach their security, they'd never succeeded. And yet,now it had happened right inside their own building.Malcolm's handsome face was ashen, his lips atight line.


Justin scrambled for an excuse. "I'll get on it and lock down this floor tight. Whoever it is hasn't left yet. Rest assured, Mr. Flynn, I'll bring the culprit toyou." "If you don't bring me that person, don't bother showing up tomorrow!"


In that moment, a cloak of darkness seemed to engulf the man, his deep-set eyes clouded over with a foreboding storm, making the office temperature dip
precipitously.


"Yes, sir!" Justin bolted, his only thought to escape the lethal look in Mr. Flynn's eyes.


The man was downright terrifying when angry.


Justin sent his team to comb every nook and cranny of the floor, not sparing even the stairwells, when someone approached him.


"We've already searched the men's restroom. Should we check the women's as well?" "Why wouldn't we? If our hacker is hiding out there,we're all out of a job come morning!"
###Chapter 73 Suspicion


Justin Chabon was in a state of high anxiety, his agitation growing by the minute. "Who's the genius that managed to cripple our system right under our noses? I need to meet this mastermind!"


Before long, a woman's shrill scream pierced the air."Hey... What are you doing? How can you barge into the ladies' room?"


As soon as Justin heard an outsider, his spirits lifted.He knew the person they were looking for had to be still on this floor. This could save his job and catch the culprit-it was a stroke of luck.


Justin waited outside,expecting the crowd inside to bring him the perpetrator. When the individual emerged, he was taken aback,"It's you?" His surprise was no less intense than when he'd learnt of the system being sabotaged.


Reese was there, frowning in exasperation. "Let go of me!"


Justin saw two burly men gripping Reese's shoulders and quickly ordered, "Let her go, now!"


The men hurriedly released Reese. She rubbed her shoulders, looking indignantly at Justin. "The restroom on our floor is out of commission, and just when I finally find a decent one to use, it gets stormed by men.What's going to happen to my reputation?"


With that,Reese covered her face as tears welled up,putting Justin in an awkward position. It was baffling to see Reese, usually fearless and confrontational,trouble even Old Man Flynn, easily intimidated by these two.But Justin didn't dare speculate carelessly. This lady was Mr. Flynn's prized jewel; any harm to her would be a cost he couldn't afford.


By then, the search was winding down, and everyone else had come back to report. "Assistant Chabon, we didn't find anyone suspicious, except for Reese."


Seeing the fuss, Reese walked over to Justin,curiosity getting the better of her. "What's with all the commotion? Is there a thief in the company?"


Justin was in a bind. HIis gaze flitted over Reese's face,hinting at something unsaid. He wanted to tell her there had indeed been a thief, yet from the looks of it,the thief seemed to be her. Yet, how could he suspect her without proof?


Besides, Reese looked so innocent; it seemed unlikely she'd be linked to a scheming hacker. But despite any doubts, there were no other suspicious characters found on the floor.


Justin Chabon sidestepped gracefully, making way for Reese.


"Mr. Flynn wants to see you."


Reese looked puzzled. "See me? Why does he want to see me?"


Justin played it cool. "You'll find out once you're in there."


He swung the door open and announced to Malcolm inside.


"Mr. Flynn, I've brought her in." Then he shut the office door behind him, turned to the crowd in the hallway, and gave a firm command.


"Let's keep today's events to ourselves, everyone."


The others murmured in confusion, whispering amongst themselves.


"What's the deal? I thought we were on hacker hunt,why the sudden backpedal?"


"Who knows,could Reese be...?"


"No way. Reese is all elegance and those icy stares of hers can't hide that, she's no hacker."


"Yeah, if you had mentioned the Reese from before,that I'd believe-she always looked like trouble." After dispersing the crowd, Justin stationed himself by the door. Subconsciously, he couldn't buy the idea of Reese being the hacker. Having dug deep into her past, the Flynn family had cleared her of any such doubt.


Every member of the Flynn family, including the staff's lineage spanning three generations, had been thoroughly vetted, ensuring transparency and preventing future troubles.


Unaware of who was behind him due to his position,Malcolm's voice was frosty.


"Which company documents did you steal? Hand them over, and I might just spare you. But if you continue to play dumb, I'll have no choice but to handle this officially."


"So that's what Justin's fuss was all about. Company documents stolen, huh."


Hearing the voice, Malcolm frowned, turned around,and saw his delicate wife standing in front of him,looking as if she was caught in a maze.


"Reese? What are you doing here?"


"What do you mean 'what? The restroom on our floor is out of order and I couldn't find any others. I finally found one on a quiet floor, and then those people barged into the ladies' room-I was this close to throwing punches."


Reese spoke, her fine features momentarily marred by anger.


Malcolm's expression darkened, his aura flickering on and off. Suddenly, he roared. "Justin Chabon, get in here!"


Justin hurriedly entered.′′Mr.Flynn?"


Dark eyes smoldering with an almost tangible fury,the man demanded.


"What the hell happened?"


Justin shrank back a bit, replying cautiously.


"Mr. Flynn, I have no idea either. Didn't you ask us to check this floor? I didn't find anyone, only Madam in the ladies'room."


Reese approached Malcolm, her eyes reflecting her curiosity.She wore an air of casual serenity that betrayed no hint of panic."Our company's confidential information has been stolen.Why not review the security tapes?" she inquired.


"They've been shut down by the intruder. Do you happen to know which computer was used to hack into our system?"


Malcolm's demeanor lacked its usual gentleness.Today, a sharpness set his features, his gaze icy and intense, almost too much to bear with a single glance.


His piercing eyes would intimidate most,but Reese was different. She had weathered storms, facing life and death with equanimity-she was not short on mental fortitude,


Yet, if Malcolm persisted with his suspicions, Reese wasn't confident she could maintain her composure. Feigning ignorance now might only heighten Malcolm's doubts, especially since her stance was quite clear.


A slight twitch at the corner of her eye, her gaze drifted to the computer beside Malcolm.


"Could it be this computer?"


"This floor... you're the only one here," Malcolm stated bluntly, his suspicion on Reese unmistakable.


Reese didn't seem alarmed, meeting his stare with equanimity.


"Where's the proof?"


A chilling darkness flickered in Malcolm's eyes as he gazed at Reese, soon followed by a cold,mocking twist of his lips.


"Justin Chabon, step outside!"


Caught off guard, Justin quickly nodded in agreement.


"Yes."


After closing the door, Justin scratched his head,increasingly confused about Mr. Flynn's intentions.With no evidence, even if they suspected Madam,it seemed they had no grounds for accusation.


Reese kept her eyes on Malcolm, equally curious about what he had planned by deliberately sending Justin away.


In the next moment, Reese discerned his intent.
Malcolm shifted towards her, and even seated,his presence was undiminished. She felt at no advantage.


His gaze was direct and incisive, as if peering through her eyes into her soul.


"Honey, tell me the truth. Darling won't be mad at you," he coaxed.


Reese arched her eyebrows in surprise. Was he attempting to soften her with charm?


"The truth is, I haven't touched your computer."


Malcolm reached for her arm, gently pulling her down to sit on his lap. A flash of coldness swept through her eyes as she tried to stand, only to be firmly held in place by Malcolm.


Her tone held a certain annoyance with an icy warning, "Malcolm, let go of me. I don't want to get physical with you here. Imagine if Justin Chabon walks in and sees you getting thrashed by me,it would shatter your pride."
###Chapter 74 Relax, Darling Won't Hurt You
Malcolm actually found her fieriness appealing. She wasn't afraid to take on anyone; it seemed like the word 'fear' didn't exist in Reese's vocabulary.


But then, Malcolm was no pushover,himself. When it came to handling others, he was masterful. Even with his leg not fully cooperative, Reese was still no match for him in a scuffle.


He had to admit, the girl had skills almost as good as his. But he had the upper hand, being a man-and Reese, no matter how tough she tried to appear, was still a girl, an innocent who'd never been in love, and wouldn't withstand his allure.


Malcolm wasn't just holding her. He blatantly pecked her lips. "Easy there," he cooed, his voice teasing. "If it was you,Darling would just give you a little punishment.Nothing too severe."


Reese let out a contemptuous snort, "And if it was me,what could you possibly do to me?"


It was a blatant challenge, unapologetically direct.


Malcolm lowered his head, tilted it, and gently bit her smooth, white earlobe. Reese shivered involuntarily.His voice was husky and seductive, irresistibly pulling her in.


"A husband's punishment is always tender. Relax,Darling won't hurt you."


Reese's hazel eyes squinted, a flash of coldness shooting through them. "If you dare touch me, I'll cripple you!"


His deep, pleasant laugh resonated near her ear as she glared at him furiously.


"Don't believe me?"


She was not one to hesitate to strike,especially not against a mere man. Disabling him was no big deal;even if the Flynn family gave her trouble later,she'd walk away unscathed.


"I just kissed you and I'm still holding you. Yet, I haven't seen you trying to take me down. Seems like the wife can't bear to do it."


Reese was livid: "You jerk!"


In the next instant, her hand raised, poised to slap Malcolm's handsome face...


But Malcolm's eyes hardened, and he caught her wrist in mid-air. Reese struggled, unable to break free. As her other hand came up, Malcolm swiftly pinned both her hands and flipped her over, enclosing her tightly from behind.


Reese tried to kick him, but his legs clamped around her firmly.


She looked back at him in surprise, "Your leg can move now?"


Malcolm raised an eyebrow at her playfully,"Want to find out?"


"Sure, my leg's working now thanks to you," Reese admitted, suddenly losing the urge to continue their physicaI skirmish. Right now, all she wanted was clarity on whether the medication and the method were actually effective and to what extent.


If it proved beneficial for Malcolm, it could revolutionize medical treatments, offering a new lease on life for countless patients.


Truth be told, Reese had stumbled upon the treatment by sheer luck-she was no miracle worker, after all.Even with her skills, there were no guarantees without considering the patient's specific condition and the practicality of the approach.


In light of recent progress, though, it seemed her combat efforts hadn't been in vain,


Malcolm wasn't entirely sure if releasing her would prevent more underhanded tricks. on her part. "Just a reminder-I'm your darling. If your kick paralyzes me, you're signing up for a lifetime of responsibility," he warned her.


"I can handle responsibility. You think I can't take care of you?" Reese's proud defiance shone through.


Malcolm gave her a knowing smirk and said something that left her pondering his true intent."Looks like my wife's got quite the guts, claiming she could support me."


He was determined to put her boast to the test and find out if there was any truth behind it.


Reese was growing impatient. "Cuit the crap and let me go, or I'll end you here and now!"


Her tone told Malcolm that his previous remark had captivated her. He released her, and as Reese was about to stand,she felt a smack on her rear. Whirling to face a grinning Malcolm, she glared at him.


"Malcolm, touch me again and you'll regret it!"


"That was for trying to take a swing at your darling earlier. Next time, it won't be so simple," he cautioned.


His leg was nearly healed; all he needed was the right moment. Then, would she still be able to elude his grasp?


Reese decided not to engage further. As soon as his leg fully recovered and she gleaned information about her grandmother's situation from him, their marriage would be over.


She pulled up a chair, ready to give him her
undivided attention. "Your leg's mostly fine now? I bet the rest of your body's just suffering from too much bed rest, including your... brother, who's also waiting for you to fully recuperate, huh?" Malcolm noted,making an indirect reference to a personal matter.


Reese had no interest in the Flynn family's brotherly feuds. "So you're saying you felt your leg before?"


Yes."


"You mean you felt everything when I was giving you those acupuncture and massage sessions?"


Her voice had an edge to it, and as Malcolm noticed her clenched fists, he had to wonder if he was on the cusp of reigniting a war.


To keep the peace and avoid upsetting his beautiful wife-whose complexion would suffer from stress-Malcolm had to tread carefully with his response.
"No, I didn't feel anything before. It's only been recently," he lied, for the sake of appeasement.


Reese's furrowed brow gradually smoothed out, and the fist she had been clenching tightly began to quietly relax.


But she couldn't just let him off the hook-not without a final word of caution.


"We're only pretending to be a couple until your leg heals. After that, we're done. So don't hide anything from me," she warned him.


No matter how powerful the Flynn family appeared,she was not the type to lie down without a fight.


Instead of being intimidated by her fierce display,Malcolm found himself increasingly enjoying the fire in her when she was angry, even if it was all bluster on the surface.


Noticing that Reese had fallen silent again, Malcolm's handsome features assumed a rare seriousness when he brought up the earlier topic. "You haven't touched this laptop, have you? The password is your birthday,did you know that?"


Reese thought she had deftly changed the subject,but he was still dwelling on it.


Attempting to joke it off again, she said,"Why would you use my birthday as a password? If someone else learns my birthday, won't they have access to your laptop, too? Seems like an invitation to steal."


"I'm not joking. Everything in this room is vital to me.
If it ever gets lost, I won't let the culprit off easily."
Malcolm's tone was calm, yet Reese felt a chill from his icy undertone of warning, especially in the piercing look he gave her now.


She shivered involuntarily. Malcolm was definitely easier to deal with when he was in his usual flirty mood. His serious side was a bit too much for her.


Suddenly, there was a noise at the door.


"Have you found Sis-in-law yet?"


Reese's eyes flicked to the door, a slight smile playing on her lips. "Your sister is here."


Malcolm had no intention of acknowledging Alyssa.


But Alyssa kept knocking persistently, “Malcolm,is Sis-in-law in there? Oh, come on Justin Chabon,what are you doing blocking the door? Let me in!"
###Chapter 75 I Don't Like Women


The next second, the door was flung open. Alyssa looked at Reese and Malcolm and immediately sensed that the atmosphere in the office was off.


A pit formed in her stomach. Had her brother found out about the errand Reese had her run with the man from the archives department?


Alyssa hurried to explain, "Listen, it's not what you think. It wasn't Reese who went to see that guy;it was for a friend of hers. She really wasn't going behind your back."


Reese's heart sank. Right now, she wished she could just tape Alyssa's mouth shut.


She was living up to her surname indeed. Malcolm's previously eased brow furrowed again as his piercing eyes swept over Alyssa and Reese.


"Which guy? What are you two hiding from me?"


Seeing Malcolm's puzzled look, Alyssa covered her mouth in shock.


"This is bad. Malcolm, you don't know? Then what were you just..."


Reese gave Alyssa a look and made a throat-slitting gesture.


You're done for.


Alyssa wished she could turn back time.She would have kept her mouth shut. Knowing Reese wouldn't crack under pressure-her mental fortitude was much stronger than most-Malcolm turned his questioning to Alyssa.


"If you want your paycheck this month, you'd better spill the beans."


Alyssa was used to living large, spending as she pleased, and her director's salary was hardly enough for her shopping sprees, let alone a new handbag.Malcolm used to transfer funds intoher account every month.


If Malcolm cut her off, it would be a financial disaster for her.


This wasn't her fault. If only Reese had given her a hint, she wouldn't have blabbed and possibly angered Malcolm. "Alright, the truth is Reese...


Alyssa recounted the story to Malcolm,who listened with a mix of skepticism and curiosity.


"You're sure it's just her friend who's interested in the archives guy,and you were helping out?"


"What else could it be? I waited at the door for so long. Reese said she felt sick, and then you...you got robbed."


Alyssa's voice trailed off, becoming quieter as she realized how unlucky Malcolm had been. Someone dared to pull a fast one right under his nose.


Malcolm pondered for a moment, then glanced at Reese,his long fingers resting on his thigh. "Yeah, just a brief fight, and suddenly there's a thief in the archives. Too much of a coincidence."


Even the naive Alyssa could read between the lines of Malcolm's insinuation. Her eyes widened.


"Reese, are you suspecting Reese is the thief?Impossible!"


She laughed out loud, looking up.


"You might believe it of Justin Chabon, but Reese...look at her, She doesn't fit the bill of a thief, and frankly, I don't think she's that clever."


Reese, who had been holding back her laughter,found Alyssa's antics amusing. Her time pretending to be less than she was had paid off, at least for today.
Otherwise,Malcolm would have kept digging.Others might be fooled, but Malcolm was another story. He had seen too many wolves in sheep's clothing. For now, though, he seemed to have hit a dead end with his questioning.


"Everyone get back to work. Justin Chabon, stay behind."


Alyssa exchanged a look with Reese, and they both left the office.


Once in the elevator, Alyssa couldn't contain her excitement and grabbed Reese's hand.


"Did I do well just now?"


"You practically sold me out, and you're asking for credit? Didn't you see the way Malcolm was looking at me? He was about to devour me." While Alyssa had helped diffuse a critical situation,Malcolm would surely investigate which friend of Reese's was interested in the archives guy. Only Alyssa would be naive enough to believe her.


Malcolm, cunning as a fox, was just short of evidence.Once he had time to think it through, he would understand everything.


Alyssa pouted, "I did my best, Reese. You can't back out now."


She clung to Reese's hand, ignoring Reese's signaling eyes,refusing to let go.


Reese had no choice but to give in. If she didn't,Alyssa might spill something to Malcolm.


"I promise you, okay? Can you let go now?" "Really? That's great, thanks, Reese."


Alyssa, elated, went to plant a kiss on Reese's cheek but was swiftly dodged.


Reese warned her coldly, "Don't be like Malcolm,getting handsy with me. I don't like women."


Alyssa caught the keyword and smirked.


"So,you and Malcolm have already..."


Reese almost stamped the word "idiot" on Alyssa's forehead.


"Don't you know Malcolm can't move around well?"


Alyssa suddenly remembered, "Right, so you guys can't... you know. Reese, you better hurry up and get Malcolm's leg fixed so you can have your wedding night."


Reese saw that Alyssa's mind was off track.


"Have you never been in love? Where did you learn such risqué language?"


Alyssa chuckled, scratching her head, "Just because I haven't done it doesn't mean I don't know how it works."


"I'm going out on business. Call in sick for me."


Reese needed to arrange things with Calvin to prevent Malcolm from catching her off guard.


Alyssa leaned in, her curiosity piqued, "You're not still hung up on that archives guy, are you? Be careful, or
Malcolm will find out. Once his leg's healed, the first thing he'll do is take care of you."


Reese rolled up her sleeves, a stern warning in her eyes.


"Believe me, if you say one more word, I'll take care of you first."


Alyssa immediately recoiled. She didn't dare provoke Reese,having seen her in action.


"Then,.. you go ahead."


Reese patted Alyssa's head with a smile.


"I'll cover your live stream tonight."


Alyssa watched Reese get into her car and then turned back to the office.


After Reese got into the car,she called Calvin, her usual smile fading away, leaving a cold expression on her delicate face.


"Meet me at the hideout later and gather everyone.I have orders for you."


"Boss, are you okay? Did anyone catch on?"


Calvin's voice was anxious. He had been on edge, not daring to call in case he accidentally tipped off Reese duríng a critical moment.


The mention of the incident irked Reese, and she replied irritably.


"Thanks to you, Malcolm's starting to suspect me now."
###Chapter 76 A Gentle Touch


"Did he catch you?"


"Just a lack of evidence, but if he starts to suspect, it's going to make everything I do more difficult."


If anything goes wrong with the Flynn Group, even if it's not her doing, the blame would naturally fall on her.


This time, Calvin had really landed Reese in hot water.


"I'm sorry, you know I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. I'll stick by you and learn, okay? I love you, so please forgive me this time."


"If there's a next time, you're off the team." Reese hung up the phone,fuming.


On the other end, Calvin was patting his chest,feeling like he just dodged a bullet.


When Reese arrived at their secret base, she pressed her fingerprint on the door lock and scanned her face before the door swung open.


The so-called secret base was actually her original startup studio, where they conducted operations too sensitive for the public eye.


As Reese pushed the door open, a line of people inside rose to their feet and greeted her in unison.


"Miss Brooks,"


The respect in their voices was palpable. Reese raised her hand to quell the formalities, "Cut the ceremony, let's get down to business. I've secured the project from the Flynn Group."


Calvin ran over,gripping Reese's arm in admiration.


"Reese, how did you pull it off? That's incredible, to get the project details right from under Malcolm's nose. Where are they?"


The others couldn't help but snicker at Calvin's overzealous approach.


Someone teased, "You're like Miss Brooks' number one fan."


Calvin shot them a glare, "Back off! I've been with Reese the longest. She's not just my boss, but family. If it wasn't for fear of her darling getting jealous-jealous of my dashing good looks-I'd follow her to the ends of the earth."


Reese's face was stern, her delicate features betraying no hint of amusement.


"I called you here for serious matters; I'm short on time."


The room fell silent, with only Calvin continuing to babble, "Reese, come on, show us the project details so we can start preparing."


"It's all up here," Reese tapped her temple.


Calvin's eyes widened in disbelief, "You memorized everything!"


Reese slapped him on the back of the head. ".You've been with me long enough to know better.Malcolm's file cabinet would trigger alarms throughout the building if any electronic device got too close. Do you think I could have walked out of that building if I'd used my phone to take pictures?"


Lucky for her, she had heard about this special cabinet beforehand, or she would have been caught red-hànded by Malcolm.


Calvin scratched his head, now understanding the gravity of the situation.


"Reese, I'm sorry, I won't let you down again."


Reese gave him a withering look, "You've let me down enough already."


"Yeah, yeah, I know, I'll cool it. Let me give you a shoulder rub, ease the tension." Calvin quickly came over to knead her shoulders and massage her legs.


Reese turned to the tall, slender man with delicate features.


"Louis, I need you to find a woman who can pose as my college friend. Malcolm will surely investigate.
Also, take the project details I've given you and study them closely. We need to start on this project before the Flynn Group does."


Calvin carefully broached the subject, "Reese, if your darling finds out you've blatantly stolen their company's project details, won't he retaliate?"


Reese scoffed, "Retaliate against me? The person capable of that hasn't been born yet. Besides, who's to say it wouldn't be me taking care of him?"
The room erupted in laughter.


Louis, who was usually reserved, blushed at the banter.


Reese was used to joking around with them; they were like family, so there were no holds barred.


"Get the job done right, or find your owwn way.I'm tired of babysitting you all, always causing me headaches."


Calvin stood up straight, responding earnestly,"Will do!!"


Louis affirmed, "Don't worry, Miss Brooks,we'll handleit."


Reese typed everything she had memorized into the computer as the others gathered around in awe.


"Miss Brooks, your memory is just phenomenal. It's like you've got a photographic memory or something..."


"You don't know the half of it. I bet she even remembers every mole on her darling's body."


Reese raised her hand to swat at Calvin again, but he dodged with a laugh.


"Hey, hey, a girl should be gentle, no hitting."


"One more peep out of you, and I'll shut you up for good."


After delegating the remaining tasks, Reese made a swift exit. With Malcolm's suspicions aroused, lingering too long would only invite trouble.


If her primary identity was discovered, Malcolm,with his nature, would dig until he uncovered everything.


She didn't need that kind of hassle or attention.


Passing by the Brooks family estate, she thought of retrieving something her grandmother had left her before passing away. Lately, she'd been dreaming of her grandmother frequently, probably a sign that she should keep that item close.


The servants were surprised to see Reese; since her marriage, she rarely visited, and rumors had it she wasn't faring well.


Coming from a small, rural town, Reese felt the staff looked down on her; they greeted her only out of politeness, without a hint of respect. She didn't care; these people, irrelevant to her life,were beneath her notice.


Stepping into the living room, she found Nancy and Dahlia Brooks leisurely sipping tea, seemingly enjoying the peace and quiet without her.


But Reese would never forget that their comfort was bought with her mother's death.


Nancy had climbed over her mother to climb to her current status as Miss Brooks.


That's why, despite the fatigue and pressure,Reese strived to excel, to one day be beyond the reach of anyone's harm or contempt.


A woman had to rely on her own strength because sometimes, not even men or family could be depended upon.
###Chapter 77 Debts of the Father


Reese breezed past them, heading upstairs without a second glance.


"Reese," Nancy called out abruptly, "didn't you see your sister and I sitting here?"


"Of course, I did," Reese replied, pausing but not turning to face them. "I'm just here to grab something I'll be out of your hair in a minute."


Small talk and false pleasantries were never Reese's forte, and she saww no need to feign them now.


Nancy's temper flared at Reese's nonchalant dismissal.and she rose from her chair in a huff. "Since you saw us, would it kill you to say hello? Or has marrying into the Flynn family erased your sense of basic decency?" Reese's unfazed and frosty demeanor irked Nancy to no end, as if nothing could ever ruffle her feathers.


What was Reese's heart made of? Ice? Stone?


Dahlia Brooks casually watched the drama unfold,munching on some chips, and tossed in a taunt for good measure. "Exactly, sis. Think you're too good for us now that you've climbed up to the Flynns? You think you can just ignore our mom? Without her, do you think you could've landed a spot among the elite like that?"


Reese had no intention of arguing with themn,but their inability to read the room or assess their own weight left her no choice but to respond.


Her brows arched in a challenge, she threw a direct barb back at Dahlia. "If that's the case, why didn't you take the opportunity to be part of high society?" After that, Reese delivered a deliberately provocative parting shot, disregarding Dahlia's furious comeback look. "Oh, I know. That balding man I saw you with recently-your new boyfriend, right? Are you telling me you passed on the chance with the Flynns for him?"


Dahlia's face twisted with rage, her foot stomping in indignation as she pointed upstairs. "You don't know what you're talking about. He's just a client."


Reese nodded thoughtfully."Oh, a client? I suspect he's just one of many. You're quite the busy woman-quite admirable,"


Nancy was oblivious to the shady characters Dahlia was mingling with or didIn't care to believe it. She naturally sided with her daughter.


"Reese, you little tramp," Nancy seethed. "Thinkingyou're untouchable because you married a Flynn?
What kind of values did your grandmother teach you?Clearly none, you're no different from your worthless mother."


No sooner had Nancy finished her words than Reese had closed in on her, piercing her with a gaze sharp as knives, as if slicing through Nancy's skin inch by inch.


Even Dahlia Brooks was rattled by Reese's icy stare.


Before she could even speak up, the crisp sound of a slap cut through the air.


In an instant, everyone in the room was stunned...


Dahlia's eyes widened in disbelief, her voice rising to a piercing shriek. "Reese, you lunatic, why the hell did you hit me?!" With a cocked head and a smile that sent shivers down one's spine, Reese replied, "Well, I couldn't very well hit an elder, could I? There's a saying, The sins of the parents fall upon the children.' You're your mother's doing, so you leave me no choice.”


Dahlia, her face searing with pain and her eyes blazing with fury, had never heard such twisted logic. "What kind of reasoning is that?"


"Your mother, as an elder, insulted my mother-who should be her elder-and my grandmother, who most certainly is. With one sentence, she disrespected two women who deserve her respect. So, what's next? Are you going to insult every ancestor of theBrooks family?"


Reese stood her ground, unassailable and formidable,every word unassailable. Dahlia, her eyes red with pain or anger-her voice octaves higher-retorted, "Your logic is insane! My mom insults your grandma, and somehow you're justified in hitting me?"


"Dahlia!" Nancy chided sharply. That naive girl had easily fallen into Reese's trap.


It took a moment, but the realization washed over Dahlia, her face flushed with rage, fists clenched tight."Reese,how dare you set me up; I'll give you what you deserve!"


As Dahlia lunged forward, Reese effortlessly dlodged.A smug smile flashed in Reese's eyes as she extended her foot, sending Dahlia tumbling down in a clumsy heap.Feigning shock, Reese offered,′′Oh,dear,you really should watch your step. Here, let me help you up." Reese approached, grasped Dahlia's wrist, who
immediately howled in pain. "Oh, it hurts..."


Nancy couldn't stand by any longer. She stepped
forward,yanking Reese away with a sharp rebuke.
"Reese! This is the Brooks' home; how dare you be so insolent!"


Reese's gaze turned frosty. "I'm the insolent one? If only you could control that mouth of yours,I wouldn't waste my time here."


Nancy shot Reese a venomous look, clearly seething.As Mrs. Brooks, the dignified matriarch of the Brooks family, the thought of being pushed around by a youngster was more than her pride could stomach.


No matter how cunning Reese thought she was, Nancy refused to believe that she couldn't get the better of a mere girl. Nancy commanded several staff members at her side, "Reese has been insolent, attacked her sisters -tie her up and lock her in the attic. She doesn't get released without my say-so."


"Yes, ma'am," they replied without question.


As the staff moved to grab Reese, she smirked
contemptuously, her eyes glinting with an icy resolve.
"You think you can catch me?" she taunted.


Somehow,despite their advance, the staff found themselves hesitating, intimidated by the sheer force of her presence. They looked to one another uncertainly.


Red with rage and casting aside her image, Nancy bellowed, "What are you waiting for? She's just a little girl-tie her up now!"


Egged on by her fury, the staff lunged towards Reese again. But Reese, ready to spring into action,was stopped by a voice even more commanding than hers thundering from the entrance.


"No one touches my wife, Reese. I dare them to try!"


Nancy and Dahlia Brooks turned their heads towards the deep voice to see Malcolm, pushed in his wheelchair by Justin Chabon. Despite being seated,his aura was undiminished, and the room's temperature seemed to plummet with his entrance.


Dahlia instinctively clutched Nancy's hand, wary of his presence. "Mom,why is Malcolm here?"


"Stay calm," Nancy reassured, squeezing her hand.


After all, Reese was still theirs by marriage, part of the Brooks family-not for the Flynns to meddle with.
Steeling her resolve, Nancy straightened up and walked over to confront Malcolm. "What brings you here?" she said with a disingenuous warmth that belied her eagerness to speak ill of Reese. "I was just about to discuss her behavior. She's turned the house upside down during her brief visit. A child raised in Backwoods without any manners, she must have given you quite the trouble, hasn't she?"


Nancy's smile was all pretense,her every word dripping with unsavory hints about Reese.
###Chapter 78 Mr. Flynn's Silver Tongue
Listening to Nancy's insinuations, Reese remained unflappable, as if the comments didn't concern her.


Malcolm,sitting in his wheelchair, was dressed in a stark black suit, an aura of dark chilliness emanating from his figure, sending an inexplicable shiver down one's spine. His gaze captured Nancy like a hawk seizing its prey.


"So,it sounds like Reese was the one who got under your skin?" Malcolm posited, his wwords sending a shock through the room. The most startled among them was Reese herself, who couldn't suppress a twitch at the corner of her mouth. He had said it with such endearment.


To the uninformed, one might think they weré the epitome of marital bliss, given the fondness in his voice.


Justin Chabon was utterly dumbfounded. One would never guess Mr. Flynn, who seemed as impassive as stone and utterly clueless about romance, let alone public displays of affection, had a penchant for sweet talk.


Nancy was genuinely thrown off by his use of 'Reese',casting a puzzled glance at Dahlia for some kind of explanation.


Dahlia shared Nancy's bewilderment. Hadn't it been said that Reese didn't fit well with the Flynn Family?Treated worse than the staff, and her-a girl from the backwoods with nothing but looks to her name-how could she compare to someone like Dahlia, who had been groomed in high society since birth? Seeing Dahlia's blank expression, Nancy realized she wasn't going to be of any help. But Nancy wasn't one to be easily intimidated by Malcolm's words or presence.


"It's hardly about getting angry. Reese isn't my biological daughter, so normally,she might take liberties in how she addresses me. However, as for her hitting her sister, that's something I, as her stepmother,must address. If she starts throwing punches at other Flynn Family members, it would reflect poorly on us.-we're supposed to have better manners than that."


Today,Nancy intended to play the role of the elder,and no matter what Malcolmn argued, it was only natural for an elder to discipline their kin. Her status as matriarch trumped even the influential background of the young Flynn heir.


But she had underestimated Reese's importance to Malcolm. No one was allowed to mistreat his woman. No one.


Malcolm forced a smile that chilled Nancy to the bone.


"I find it strange. Reese is normally the gentlest girl you could meet; she wouldn't even say a dirty word.How is it that you have driven her to the point of violence today?"


Dahlia couldn't help but widen her eyes and blurt out,"Gentle? Not cursing? You must be..."


She was about to spill everything, but a sharp look from Malcolm silenced her. Subconsciously, her mouth snapped shut.


Malcolm stepped forward, wrapping Reese's slightly cool hand in his warm, broad palm as he fixed his gaze  on Reese's face. "I would have addressed you as mother like Reese," he began, "but since Reese herself isn't keen on that,
"ma'am' will have to do. Even Reese's patience has its limits when it comes to the way she's been treated here."


Nancy was on the verge of losing her mind with frustration.


"When have we ever mistreated her?" Nancy retorted,"Rather, he's the one who showed disrespect to his elders right off the bat and even had the nerve to lay a hand on Dahlia. Mr. Flynn, you don't need to speak for Reese. Raised in the Backwoods,how could she possibly understand decorum? I don't expect her to be as sensible as Dahlia; I just hope she doesn't cause any trouble."


"Undisciplined?" Malcolm's mouth tightened in visible displeasure at Nancy's words.
 Malcolm added, "Why don't you have your staff recount what just happened then? I'm eager to see who's actually at fault. If it turns out to be Reese, we will personally apologize for her. But if it's not, then I can't stand by and let my wife be wronged unjustly."


Seeing Malcolm's determination to get to the bottom of this incident made Dahlia feel uneasy. His presence alone seemed to thin the air around them,commanding everyone's silent attention.


Dahlia dared not speak again, fearing the weight of his gaze might topple her resolve.


Nancy almost wanted to laugh, thinking about how everyone was talking about Reese's miserable integration into the Flynn family. Gossip had painted a picture of a Backwoods girl, constricted by rules and etiquette, constantly making mistakes in the aristocratic household. Grandpa Flynn of the Flynn Family was known for his strict adherence to etiquette; he surely wouldn't have approved of Reese.


But the rumors, it seemed, were far from reality.Malcolm,typically restrained, found himself openly defending a mere girl today.


Nancy couldn't help her sardonic tone, "I never expected this. Malcolm is treating her like she's some kind of treasure."


"Am I not supposed to cherish my own wife? Or are you vying for that privilege?" Malcolm shot back,his words sharp and cutting, leaving Nancy visibly shaken.


Nancy tried to shift the focus by mentioning another name, "Malcolm, does Finn Sawyer know how indulgently you're doting on Reese?"Malcolm's patience had worn thin.


"Ma'am, let's not waste more time. Have your staff come forward and speak. Once this matter is resolved,I intend to take Reese home. Grandpa's waiting for us for dinner."


Nancy was in a tight spot, with no easy way out-admitting she was wrong now would only highlight Reese's innocence.


Glancing at a nearby employee, she motioned discreetly, "You tell us what transpired!"


The staff member, evidently nervous, was met with Nancy's persistent eye signals. "I.., I saw the eldest daughter strike the second one, be defiant towards the lady, and utter some rather unsavory remarks."


Malcolm's gaze was fixed on the staff member with an icy intensity, his features sharp, his entire demeanor exuding grave seriousness.


"Then spell it out for us. How exactly did the eldest daughter defy her? Are you telling me our lady and the second daughter didn't exchange a single word when she walked through the door?"


The staff member, shaken by Malcolm's commanding tone, felt a tremor in their shoulders.



"I...1


"If you can't articulateit, on what grounds do you accuse our Reese of defying the lady first? That's illogical,isn't it?"


Malcolm's presence was chilling and hostile. Reese couldn't help but wrap her arms around herself,rubbing her arms-his aura was truly formidable,even she could feel it.


Malcolm's words, sharp as blades, had significantly undercut Nancy's earlier arrogance.


And now,Malcolm wasn't about to give them any quarter.

"If you can't provide specifics, then it's clear Reese has been wronged. Shouldn't you apologize to our Reese?"


Reese fought to keep her laughter in check although her quivering shoulders might have given her away but luckily, no one noticed her at the moment.


Standing alone in the past, she never felt undercut,yet now, with someone ready to shield her, it was an unfamiliar feeling, but she found delight in seeing the mother and daughter falter.


Dahlia was on the brink of exploding, disregarding her image, she bellowed, "Why should I apologize to her? She hit me-she should be apologizing to me!"


Nancy tugged at her sleeve, "Enough."


"Mom..." Dahlia was perplexed as to how Malcolm's few words had suddenly made Nancy back down.
###Chapter 79 Not Sincere Enough, Try Again
But, for Dahlia to apologize to Reese? That was out of the question. As the second Miss of the Brooks family,born into prestige, why should she apologize to someone like Reese?


Malcolm's intent seemed to be to see this through to the end,wvhich spooked Dahlia, especially his dominating presence that seemed to thin the air around them.


Dahlia didn't dare make another sound for fear of Malcolm's gaze sweeping her way again, as she might not be able to hold her ground.


Nancy realized she was in a situation akin to riding a tiger-difficult to dismount without losing face.Admitting they were wrong about Reese now would only make it seem like they had been unjust to her in the first place.


"Go on, apologize to Reese already," someone urged.


"I won't apologize!" Nancy retorted. "She hit me first!Does being a Flynn mean you're above everything?Even the Flynns have to make sense!"


"Of course they should, though I'm afraid later you might not see it that way."


Reese,silent up to that point, suddenly stepped
forward, pulled out her phone and played a recording.


Nancy's and Dahlia Brooks' voices filled the room,their words about Reese's mother and grandmother dripping with such malice it could only be described as biting. Their expressions immediately transformed into a vivid mix of shock and horror. No one had anticipated that Reese was so well-prepared, going as far as to have an audio recording.


Malcolm's lips curled into a sly, sinister smile, "Ready to apologize now?"


Dahlia Brooks bit her lip, her face the picture of discomfort.


"I..."


Nancy nudged Dahlia Brooks. They were reluctant but left with no choice-if Malcolm truly lost his temper,they couldn't handle it. And when Kenneth found out they'd crossed Malcolm, they'd be in for far worse.


"Quick, do it. Otherwise, when your dad gets back,he'll have a go at us again," Nancy whispered urgently to Dahlia Brooks.


Though she was inwardly rebellious, Dahlia Brooks dreaded the thought of Kenneth docking her allowance over this.


Pouting, she very reluctantly apologized to Reese with a murmured, "I'm sorry."


Nancy, aiming to smooth things over with a smile,said, "There now, it's all good. It's normal for siblings to have a little spat now and then, no need to take it so seriously. We wouldn't want to ruin their relationship,"


"Hold up..."


Malcolm spoke again, startling Nancy. Her smile froze as a bead of cold sweat trickled down her forehead.They had apologized; wasn'tthat enough? Was he really going to be that unforgiving?


She smiled stiffly, "Malcolm, is there something else?"


"That wasn't sincere enough. Do it again," Malcolm replied with a cool, compelling tone that left no room for objection.


Dahlia Brooks felt a surge of anger, incredulous as she stared at Malcolm.


"Do it again? I already apologized! Are you doing this on purpose?"


"If your initial apology had been sincere, you wouldn't need to do it again," Malcolm responded with an icy chill in his voice, as if it were laced with a biting wind.


Dahlia Brooks felt tears threatening to spill as she grasped Nancy's hand tightly.


"Mom..."


"Just listen." Nancy said helplessly, her heart aching.Who would've thought Reese would be enough trouble, but now there was Malcolm-and he was not someone they could afford to offend.


Dahlia swallowed hard, then turned to Reese with an earnestness that hadn't been there before.


"Reese, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have bad-mouthed you,let alone insulted you. Please forgive me."


Reese's fair and delicate face bloomed with a radiant smile as she replied with ease, "It's okay, Dahlia. Big sis won't hold a grudge."
Dahlia's lips trembled, her eyes shooting daggers at Reese. If only Malcolm wasn't there, she wouldn't have held back her fury.


Malcolm finally seemed to have enough, and told Reese, "Let's head back."


"Wait for me, darling. I need to grab something from upstairs."


Reese seemed to be in an exceptionally good mood,almost gleeful- even speaking to Malcolm with more warmth than usual.


"Sure."


Malcolm's patience with Reese was strikingly apparent.


When Reese came back down, Malcolm politely addressed Nancy, "We'll be taking our leave now."


Nancy managed a strained smile. "Say hello to Finn Sawyer for me, and I'll make sure to visit another day."


Once Malcolm and Reese were gone,Nancy's forced smile crumbled, her eyes flashing with venom. With a sweep of her hand, she sent teacups crashing to the floor, her voice rising sharply.


"That girl set a trap for me!"


She was humiliated in front of her staff today, gaining no favors and losing face as Mrs. Brooks.


Dahlia's sense of injustice grew, her hand still on her burning cheek, tears welling up. "Mom, we can't let Reese walk all over us. We need to find a way to get back at her."


"She slapped me and Malcolm mocked me. I feel like I'm going insane," Dahlia fumed.


"Don't worry. Even if you didn't ask, I would've handled it. I used to think Reese was just a simpleton.but seeing them together, they're cunning. Had I known Malcolm would be this triumphant, I should have arranged for you to marry into the Flynn family.Look at Reese now-being pampered like a princess."


The more Nancy thought about it, the less she could contain her indignation.


Malcolm was nothing like the washed-up,nearly dead figure rumors had painted him to be-quite the opposite, His vitality was evident; he radiated a kind of inner light that made him stand out, in spite of his paralysis.


Dahlia Brooks, on the other hand, was running out of patience. She wanted to see action, and her mind was spinning with plans. "Mom, isn't Finn Sawyer's birthday bash just around the corner? Since Malcolm is so fond of Reese, and apparently has a good impression of her, why don't we seize the opportuinity?We can orchestrate a scandal so disgraceful for Reese that the Flynns, for the sake of their reputation,won't want anything to do with her. Once she's divorced from Malcolm, I can slide into her place. Then,everything the Flynns have will be within our grasp."


The scheme was enticing, and Dahlia could almost picture Reese's humiliating downfall.


Nancy couldn't agree more;′′IfReese was reluctant to marry Malcolm in the first place, let's help her out of her misery." Exchanging a glance, both wore a triumphant smirk.


Once Reese was in the car, she curiously asked Malcolm, "What brought you to the Brooks' place out of the blue?"
###Chapter 80 Dream On


"If I didn't show up, do you think your stepmother and sister would have let you be?"


There was a softness in Malcolm's eyes that seemed almost to spill over. He reached to smooth a stray lock of hair from her forehead, but Reese instinctively dodged his touch, her gaze wary.


"What are you doing?"


Amused by her apprehension, he chuckled. "Just fixing your hair, sweetheart. What's there to be scared of?Unless, you think I might bite?"


Reese couldn't help but laugh at the thought. "You?Try anything?" She wasn't boasting, but even if Malcolm had intentions, he'd have to consider her own capabilities first. She wouldn't want him ending up hurt, especially not with Finn Sawyer ready to throw a fit.


Her bold laugh was full of confidence, and as the sunlight streamed through the car window, it made her all the more radiant.


The more Malcolm watched her, the more he was convinced that Reese was a treasure. Her personality,and the very words she spoke, set her apart. She had a streak of independence that made her distinct in a crowd.


She was the woman Malcolm should have married, the unique one amidst thousands in his heart.


He leaned in closer, his cool lips brushing against her earlobe, his voice deep yet teasing. "Well then, let's just wait and see. Just don't come crying to me later."


Reese didn't quite catch the hint in Malcolm's words.She thought he simply wanted to challenge her to a little test of skill, and she gamely accepted the offer.


"Alright, let's see who ends up crying first," she playfully taunted.


Malcolm laughed heartily, "Oh, that's definitely going to be you."


He hadn't yet witnessed a situation where a man could be brought to tears by such a thing.


Justin Chabon wished he could disappear.


The mere thought of Mr. Flynn regaining his full mobility filled Justin with anticipation. He imagined the spark and fireworks between these two headstrong figures could brighten up anyone's life, not just their own.


As Malcolm recalled Reese descending the staircase earlier, he noticed the bracelet in her hand that looked like it had seen better years -nothing to compete with the gifts he'd lavished upon her. He was curious why she would risk facing Nancy head-on just to retrieve that particular piece.


"What's with the bracelet?" he inquired with a hint of curiosíty.


Reese's expression softened, "It was my grandmother's.She gave it to me before she passed away. I had to marry into the Flynn family in such a rush that I didn't get the chance to bring it with mne."


The mention of her grandmother brought a shadow over Reese's usual bright smile, a touch of melancholy that could tug at anyone's heartstrings.


Malcolm had heard bits and pieces about Reese's grandmother, mostly through her files. It seemed she had passed away a few months ago under mysterious circumstances, found dead in the streets after just stepping out for a while.


"Do you know how she died?" he asked.


Reese turned to him sharply, surprise flickering in her eyes, "You know about my grandmother's death?"


The suddenness in her voice alarmed Malcolm, a flicker of surprise crossing his deep-set eyes.


"No, I just heard you mention it," he responded calmly. Reese slumped her shoulders in disappointment,her mouth twisting slightly.


"Then why ask," she retorted, annoyed for getting her hopes up that Malcolm knew something about her grandmother.


Watching her reaction, Malcolm wondered if Reese suspected there was more to her grandmother's death.


He coughed lightly, feigning nonchalance,"Maybe if you ask your Darling nicely, I could look into your grandmother's death for you,"


Reese scoffed disdainfully, "In your dreams."
###Chapter 81 She Never Asks for Help
Reese never asked anyone for help, especially not from men. Despite Malcolm being her "Darling" in name,she knew well enough the deceit that a noble façade could hide. Her past naivety had led her to trust too easily-a mistake she wouldn't repeat.


Better to leave some questions unasked, some suspicions buried. She wouldn't dwell on the dark hunches anymore.


Malcolm watched her, radiating a pride that was at once alluring and unapologetic, and he couldn't help but let slip a husky chuckle.


"Feeling feisty, huh? Just think about it-if you go digging yourself, it'll be such a hassle. You have no clue where to start. Just sweetly call me 'Darling'and let me do the searching for you. It's quick and, easy, and it'll save you a whole lot of trouble. Besides, I'm only asking for a 'Darling,' not for you to sleep with me."


Reese's fists clenched at his teasing words, a defiant fire burning in her voice. "One more word, and you'll have to believe I'm this close to shutting you up for good."


Malcolm leaned in, his eyes twinkling with mischief as he locked gaze with Reese's furious ones. "And how would you do that? Seal it with a kiss? Like this..."


His words hung in the air as he planted a swift,teasing peck on Reese's plush, rosy lips before quickly pulling away. In that instant of retreat, her fist swung at him, the force of her punch buzzing past his cheek.


Malcolm could almost feel the rage emanating from her. That punch, had it landed, would have left half of his face swollen for sure-the girl didn't know her own strength.


Justin Chabon, sensing the brewing storm between them, hit the brakes hard. Reese, caught off-guard and unable to steady herself, tumbled straight into Malcolm's arms, her head thudding against his abdomen. It wasn't hard, but it packed enough force to elicit a muffled grunt from her, her usually composed demeanor flushed with unexpected embarrassment.


"Mr. Flynn, are you alright?" Justin Chabon called out anxiously from the front seat.


"Look away!" Malcolm barked, his tone sharp with authority.


Justin, instantly retracting at the awkward encounter,shrank back and resumed driving, all the while thinking, My God, did I really see the Madam falling into Mr. Flynn's arms, blushing like a shy schoolgirl?


Malcolm looked down at Reese's petite head against him, a playful smirk tracing his lips. "So, wifey enjoys making an entrance into my arms?"


"Get off me!" Reese snapped back, quickly lifting her head and scooting away from him. Her porcelain cheeks turned a brighter shade of red; her eyes hinted at a flustered panic, her heart racing like it was about to leap out of her throat.


Malcolmn rarely saw her this flustered and found it utterly delightful, his gaze fixed on her discomposed state,his mood considerably brightened.


She's getting more beautiful by the day.


The tension in the car was palpable. Reese, feeling Malcolm's intense gaze,started to panic and shifted her focus to Justin Chabon.


"Justin Chabon, you did that on purpose, didn't you?"she accused.


Justin Chabon shivered, "Madam, I wouldn't dare,but Sir has instructed me to always protect Mr. Flynn's safety."


"Do I look like I'm going to bite him?" Reese pouted,frustrated by the perception everyone seemed to have of her as some sort of tigress. She had her graceful moments too, didn't she?


Justin Chabon chuckled, "Whether Madam could 'devour' Mr. Flynn, that's for Mr. Flynn to decide."


As long as Mr. Flynn was on board, anything could happen. But judging by the current circumstances, Mr.
Flynn seemed quite pleased with Madam-Reese to be specific. If she showed the slightest interest, he'd willingly offer himself up.


The atmosphere in the car suddenly charged with an undercurrent of intimacy.


Even Reese, who was usually unflappable, couldn't help but react to Justin Chabon's teasing.


Determined to change the subject, she asked, "How did you know I was at the Brooks'?"


"We got a delivery of food from our business partners today. I thought you'd be working late, so I considered having Justin Chabon bring some to you. Turns out,you weren't there."


Reese's eyes turned frosty in an instant, "So you had someone check up on me?"Justin awkwardly retreated, sensing the tension in the air.


Malcolm frowned and countered, "My wife's whereabouts are unknown, and I'm not supposed to enquire? What if something happened to you? Who would I rely on for the rest of my life?"


A question that should've sounded like an accusation,somehow, from his lips, it carried a hint of concern that left Reese momentarily lost.


She hated this unfamiliar sensation. Reese had always been a self-directed woman, never swayed by her surroundings or anyone else, let alone her emotions.Her moods were consistent year-round-only the thrill of making money brought her any real sense of joy.


But now, since marrying Malcolm, her life and emotions seeme d to fluctuate with him. She experienced heart flutters, sometimes even blushing in his presence-what was that about?


Reese preferred the predictability of her life.Marrying Malcolm had been a calculated move, not one of romance. She vowed to guard her heart so she could walk away unscathed when the time came.


If her mother hadn't poured all her energy into men,with her talent, she could have led a better life by now. Therefore, men weren't important; making money was.


Men might leave at any moment, but money stays.


Turning away, Reese unapologetically doused Malcolm with a splash of cold truth.


"Find someone else to take care of you if you wish.I'm only here to heal your leg, As for your personal happiness, perhaps Everly would be interested. I'm sure she'd welcome the opportunity."


It might have sounded like he was just passing the buck, but to Malcolm and Justin Chabon, it seemed like Reese stank of jealousy.


Justin couldn't help but snicker at her earlier, and Malcolm, ever the show-off, raised an eyebrow and leaned in close to Reese, his lips practically brushing against her ear as he spoke. The heat of his breath sent shivers down her spine, and she instinctively tried to dodge away, only to find herself against the car window.


Noticing her flushed earlobe and the startled look that made her seem as vulnerable as a deer caught in headlights, Malcolm found her irresistibly charming.He hooked a finger under her chin, and with a glance full of entrancing laughter, his gaze was pure seduction. "Jealous, are we? Don't worry, darling, you're the only one for me in this life. Everly's just like a sister.
###Chapter 82 Roots Out the Truth


Reese, humiliated and seething,abruptly shoved Malcolm away, her hands fumbling through her hair in embarrassment.


"Who said I was jealous?"


The very fact that he knew-or presumed to know-her feelings made it worse.


Rather than getting annoyed, Malcolm only smiled wider when Reese pushed him. "I know my wife gets shy," he teased. "We'll have our little talk back in the room."


Reese shot him a withering look, her wrist twirling with mock menace as she smirked.′′Oh,,we'll definitely have a talk." After disembarking the car, Reese received a message from Louis.


Miss Brooks, I've discovered important information about your grandmother.


Reese's eyes lit up, and Malcolm, who noticed her change in demeanor, looked up but saw no ripple of emotion on her face. She was cool as ever, even as she faced Justin Chabon's direction.


Had his instincts been wrong?


Justin approached, and Reese guided Malcolm indoors.


Close to the study, Justin murmured in Malcolm's ear,"Mr.Flynn, there's something we need to discuss."


"Alright," Malcolmn turned briefly to Reese, " Darling, I'll be busy for a bit. Why don't you gorelax in your room?"


Letting go of the wheelchair, Reese passed it to Justin."Take your time with your business."


She had things of her own to sort out, anyway.


Once back in her room, Reese closed the door behind her, turned on the bathroom faucet for cover, and stepped out onto the balcony. Dialing Louis back, her youthful face was streaked with a seriousness beyond her years.


"What did you find?"


"Gram had indeed paid a visit to the Flynns before she passed, but she was there to see someone." "Who was she there to see?"


"A man named Jason."


Reese felt a sudden pang of tension. Jason was the
Flynns' butler, wasn't he? Why would her
grandmother need to see him?


She struggled to suppress the shock in her heart. "Did you find out what sort of connection Gram had with this Jason?"


"No leads on that yet."


Reese didn't push it-Louis had already done plenty for her.


"If you find some spare time, could you dig a little deeper,see if more information comes up?" "Miss Brooks, are you planning to approach Jason yourself? Just a heads up, Jason is not a simple character. He may just be a butler for the Flynns,but he's influential,been to significant meetings. As for why he would take a butler's position at the Flynns',the reasoning might be quite complex."


Louis felt compelled to warn Reese of potential dàngers. It would be tragic if she fell into a trap or came to harm.


"I've got to go now," she hurriedly ended the call.


Reese worried that Malcolm might walk in again and cause complications.


She hastily booted up her computer and tapped into specialist channels to look up Jason's information. A standard search wouldn't yield much. Luckily, she was skilled in bypassing systems, getting inside quickly. However, time was of the essence; if the other party detected her and traced her location, it would spell trouble.


After skimming the information, she logged off, her mind reeling with the details she'd just uncovered.


Jason's true status was astoundingly complex-not only a significant figure from somewhere, he'd also been to important meetings, and his net worth far exceeded any normal expectation.


He owned several properties on the outskirts of the city, which made her wonder why he would debase himself to serve as a lowly butler at the Flynns'.


Did Finn Sawyer know Jason's real identity?


Questions piled up in Reese's mind, and she khew she
had to find the answers one by one. Initially, if Jason had been just an ordinary butler, she could've directly questioned him.


But now it appeared she couldn't act hastily; the man was deep, not to be underestimated.


The Flynns really had a lot more going on than met the eye, even a butler was not to be taken at face value.


Meanwhile, Malcolm sat in the adjacent study, his typically handsome and gentle face now devoid of warmth, enveloped in a chilly aura.


His gaze sharp, he cast a swift look at Justin Chabon. "Did you find anything?" "I did check," Madam's restroom on that floor is certainly out of order. Although we got the surveillance back up, there wasn't a trace of any tampering-no evidence whatsoever that can decisively pin the deed on Madam."


Malcolm's brow furrowed, his frustration peaking as he swept the files off his desk, sending papers fluttering to the floor.


"So, you're telling me, the culprit slipped right under our noses, and now we don't even have a suspect?"


It was uncharacteristic for Malcolm to be caught off guard. When it came to digging up dirt, he had a knack for unearthing what he sought after. No individual or matter could hide from Malcolm's prying eyes.


Indeed, since the establishment of Flynn Group,there lad been numerous hacking attempts. While Malcolm couldn't recall all the culprits, never had they been unable to at least identify the perpetrator.


This time was absolutely ludicrous-the perpetrator had the audacity to paralyze his company's system right from his own office. A blatant slap to his face,wasn't it?


And now Justin Chabon had the nerve to report back with absolutely nothing.


Chabon,visibly rattled by Malcolm's imposing demeanor,stepped back, the tension in the study becoming nearly suffocating. He nervously tightened his collar, cautiously responding.


"Mr. Flynn, it likely isn't Madam.We've vetted her thoroughly.Although her medical training is superficial, it'sirrelevant here. But as for being a master hacker? That just doesn't seem to be the case."


"You think just because she doesn't look the part she's innocent? If you've learned nothing else in all these years with me, it's that appearances are deceiving. The cunning are experts at masquerading and she could very well be fooling your 'trained eye.'"


Despite lacking proof, Reese had crept onto his list of suspects. Guilty or not, Malcolm was determined to have his resolve.


Chabon,head bowed, was on tenterhooks, dreading another outburst that could cost him his job.


Leaning back in his chair, Malcolm tapped his long fingers on the desktop. His tone was low and grave,his displeasure unmistakable.
"Keep investigating. Start with those closest to Reese.The company projects will proceed as planned."


Chabon, perplexed, dared to question, "But Mr. Flynn.if our project details have been compromised, what if someone uses them to draft their own plans and accuses us of plagiarism?"


The reputation of Flynn Group was at stake.


"Nothing ventured, nothing gained. How else will we uncover who swiped our project details?"


He would rather sacrifice a hundred-million-dollar project than let the thief escape his grasp.


Justin Chabon watched as a fierce fire blazed in Mr.Flynn's eyes, sensing that this man had ignited an ambition within Mr. Flynn that had lain dormant for a long while. "I'm on it," he pledged.


When Malcolm returned to the room, he found Reese already in bed. A lone nightlight cast a soft glow across the room, where she seemed to rest uneasily,her brows knitting together even in sleep.


He couldn't resist the urge to smooth the worry from her face. But before his fingers could grace her skin,Reese's eyes-sharp as daggers-snapped open, her hand raising in a swift strike towards Malcolm.
###Chapter 83 Tenderness of Darling


With a swift side-step, Malcolm caught Reese's wrist,his own brow furrowing.


"Why are you always on such high alert, girl?"he chided gently.


It wasn't the first time she had lashed out unexpectedly. At her age, she should have been carefree, but there seemed to be shadows lurking in her eyes that Malcolm couldn't quite understand.


His gut told him that Justin Chabon hadn't fully unraveled Reese's story-there was surely much they were still unaware of. Files and data could deceive,but the truth was in the way she moved, the way she acted, the look in her eyes that couldn't be concealed.


Only now did Reese recognize Malcolm; a flush of embarrassment crossed her face as she sat up, tousling her hair.


"Sorry, I thought a burglar had broken in. Just a reflex. I didn't hurt you, did I?" she asked warily.


"I'm getting used to it," he replied with a wry smile.


Time and again, if he touched her without her knowledge, she would sense it even before his hand drew near.


Reese saw the doubt in Malcolm's eyes.


"When I was a kid, I lived with my grandma in Backwoods. The lock on our door was unreliable, and the place wasn't too safe. We had our fair share of break-ins, so I had to be extra vigilant," she explained. She hoped that her story about Backwoods would dispel his suspicions; it was true the area had its issues with thieves, but fear had never quite taken hold of her.


Malcolm pulled out a cigarette from his suit jacket pocket and lit it, propping his chin in his palm, the gesture one of ready attention.


"And your medical skills, where'd you pick those up?"he inquired, smoke curling between them.


"My grandma knew an old Chinese medicine practitioner,Worried about my limited education,fearing I wasn't the sharpest, she entrusted me to his tutelage for a few years."


Her words flowed smoothly, her facial expressions utterly relaxed-there was no hint of deceit, her narrative seemed as natural as recounting her own life story.


Malcolm drew on his cigarette, exhaling a perfect ring.His slender, pale fingers, as if made for playing the piano, held the cigarette with an elegance that matched the mysterious and alluring depths of his eyes.


He remained silent, and Reese was left to wonder if he believed her. Whether he did or didn't, the real details about her past were safe from his probing. But,she thought, it would be far better if he harbored no doubts-keeping up with lies was exhausting, and the more they multiplied, the greater the risk they might unravel during long nights filled with too many dreams.


It would probably be best if she looked into her grandmother's situation first. By the time Malcolm got around to digging, she'd be long gone, off the radar. Malcolm roughly gathered the gist of it:′′SOwhat you're saying is, your grandma raised you and always worrying whether you'd be able to fend for yourself in the future?"


"Of course," she snapped. "Did you think my deadbeat dad who ditched his family would give a damn about me?"


From the moment Kenneth abandoned them, she had become numb to the world's coldness and her heart had turned to stone.


A person could be so heartless as to disregard their own flesh and blood-since her father could do it,how could she expect any better from a man who wasn't even related to her by blood?


No matter how nice Malcolm was now, she was done putting her trust in men. They'll say anything when they love you, but will find a myriad of ways to hurt you when their love fades.


A woman's life is like a direct ascent to the peak as long as she steers clear of men.


Malcolm flicked his unfinished cigarette away,stepped forward, and wrapped his arms around Reese's shoulders, drawing her close and gently patting her back.


"Don't worry,sweetheart. From now on, I'm gonna cherish you like nobody else could, with unconditional love and adoration, making up for all the love you've missed."


A twitch flickered at the corner of Reese's eye,an instinctive urge to puash Malcolm away rising within her. But he held on tightly as if he wanted to meld her into his very marrow. His warm palm softly patted her back,soothing as if comforting a child, his voice gentle and patient.


"It's just us here, honey. No need to be shy, just lean into your darling's embrace."


Reese had the gnawing urge to slap him for his nonsensical babble. As if she was that fragile-but the warmth of his hand felt unexpectedly comforting,especially since she got chills all the time,a chronic condition except for in the summer months.


Wrapped in Malcolm's arms, warmth not only returned to her body, but her icy heart seemed to be slowly thawing too.


For now, she might as well treat him as her personal heater.


Perhaps it was the comfy embrace, but before sheknew it, Reese drifted off on his shoulder, clueless as to how she ended up back in bed.


The next day, when Reese woke up,the sun had already flooded the room, and she could hear Everly's ruckus outside.


"This is getting ridiculous! What kind of newlywed sleeps this late? It's less of having a wife and more like serving an ancestor," Everly complained.


A staff member tried to hush her, "Please, Miss Everly,keep it down. The young master instructed us to let Madam sleep a bit longer."


Everly's heart seethed with jealousy as she overheard the staff's comments. She'd never been on the receiving end of such preferential treatment. Only when she was sick would Malcolm break the routine and let her rest longer, unlike those early-riser roosters. The Flynns had their own set of strict rules, and lazy mornings were simply not an option for anyone in the family.


Yet there was Reese, who despite lacking the pedigree to match Malcolm, had the nerve to strut around,breaking the Flynn family's longstanding traditions on her very arrival.


In this household, Grandpa and Malcolm called the shots. Malcolm's dominance silenced any potential challenges, leaving no one daring enough to provoke him, let alone contradict him.


But Everly didn't believe for a second that she couldn't handle Reese.


Rolling up her sleeves, Everly barged through the door,yanking off Reese's blanket, intending to drag her out of bed. But Reese was not a morning person.Before she could even wake up properly, Everly was already trying to muscle her out of bed forcefully.


A cold demeanor washed over Reese's face, and the temperature in the room plummeted. Even Sandra standing by the doorway couldn't help but rub her arms to fend off the chill.


"Why is it so cold in here?"


Reese didn't lift a finger. One piercing look from her eyes, and Everly's bravado dropped by half as she glanced around anxiously.


"You... Do you even realize what time it is? Malcolm's long gone, and here you are still sleeping.How can you have the nerve to stay in bed?"


Clutching the blanket around her, Reese cast a disdainful glance at Everly. Oh, are you jealous because you can't sleep in?"


Everly crossed her arms in front of her chest. "Jealous of what? You lack social standing, and you can't even understand the basic rules."


Reese curled up on her bed, with no apparent intention of getting up.


"You may not envy anything else about me, but you can't deny that my darling adores me... extremely so..."
###Chapter 84 Someone's Competing For Your Darling

Seeing Reese's smug appearance and remembering how lovey-dovey they were together almost blew Everly's mind.


She clutched her head and let out a shrill, desperate scream.


"You shameless woman, I'm going to teach you a lesson today!"


With that, Everly raised her hand, aiming a slap at Reese's face. But the look in Reese's eyes turned sharp as she flashed a contemptuous smile. Before Everly's hand could make contact, Reese grabbed her arm and tossed her onto the bed, nimbly flipping over to sit on her back, pressing down on her legs. Everly's cries of agony filled the room.


"Ah... It hurts so bad! Somebody, help! This brat is trying to kill me!"


Hearing Everly's cry, the staff hurried in. Their numbers were strong, but none dared approach Reese.who stood her ground with fierce, piercing eyes.


They even blamed Everly internally, who knew Reese was not like the other girls, yet still provoked her.


Now intervening seemed like a futile march to their doom.


Everly, seeing them hesitate at the door like statues,bellowed in embarrassment and rage.


"What are you waiting for? Get her off me, now!" A skinny woman nudged the plump woman beside her.


"You're stronger, you go first!"


"I'm too clumsy, you're nimbler,you go."


"You're taller, go on."


"I'm not going, I'm still sore from being laid up in bed for days after tangling with Miss Alyssa. If I go,it's bed rest for life."


Reese sneered, "See? They're all scared. But you,you're brave enough to come at me first thing in the morning. It seems Miss Alyssa's been brought to heel,but you're out of line."


The pose Reese struck now was an immense humiliation for Everly.


Ever since she was a child, like Alyssa, she'd been coddled by Malcolm and Grandfather.When had she ever been treated like this?


The hurt and anger boiling inside made her confront Reese despite the pain.


"Reese, don't think just because you're a fighter that you can lord over the Flynn family. I'm warning you -I'll telI Grandfather if you don't let me go!"


Reese,who never backed down from anyone, was not intimidated by Everly's threat; if anything, it egged her on.


"Go ahead, I'll also tell him how you've been pining after my darling, troubling me time and again." Even though there was no blood relation between Everly and Malcolm, any whiff of scandal would disgrace the Flynn family.


In the public's eye, they were as good as siblings,and here they were, kindling flames of forbidden love,especially while Malcolm had a wife. Such chaos in an illustrious household.


The Flynns were all about their reputation. The family would be the talk of the town, a laughing stock, and as for Finn Sawyer, it would drive him sick.


Struck at her core by Reese's words, Everly was at a loss for words, her face flushing pale and then red.


"Just let go of me!" she exclaimed.


She knew she had to change the subject; confronting her grandpa about such matters was out of the question. The secret had been safely hidden in her heart for years, but to think that a young and inexperienced girl like Reese would see right through her was unimaginable.


When Reese first arrived, she seemed so awkward and clueless. But now, it appeared she was getting sharper by the day, with eyes that seemed to penetrate straight into her soul.Sometimes, she couldn't even bear to meet Reese's gaze.


Reese arched an elegant eyebrow, clearly unafraid of the staff rushing over to intervene. It wouldn't matter if it were just these two or three, or even the entire fleet of the Flynn family's staff-they were no match for her.


"I can let you go, but you need to apologize to me."


Everly had always looked down on Reese, and given that they were rivals in love, the thought of apologizing to her was ludicrous. If she backed down now, Reese would have her under her thumb forever.She would never allow it.


Everly glared at Reese with venom in her eyes."I'd rather die than apologize to you!"


"Oh please, dying is easy. But you can't even handle a little pain. You're in no position to talk about death."


With that,Reese tightened her grip, and Everly screamed in agony, sweat beading on her forehead.


"Reese,you wretched woman, I'll kill you! Do you actually think the Flynn family wanted you to marry in? You're nothing but a pawn to cheer Malcolm up.Once his leg heals, you'll be out of here!"


Reese's face remained untouched by the tirade, like punching a pillow. The nearby staff grew increasingly nervous, fearing Reese might actually cripple the young miss.


There was a chilling ferocity and apathy in the young girl's eyes, captivating and intimidating to those who witnessed it.


Should anything happen to Miss Everly because of Reese,the staff knew they wouldn't escape blame either.


"Madam, please, spare Miss Everly. She didn't mean to cause trouble."


"Please, Madam, have mercy. If anything serious happens,how will you explain it to Sir and the Master?"


Reese stood her ground firmly:"I've already made myself clear. An apology is all I want,nothing more."


She wouldn't allow anyone to insult her without consequence.


Everly ought to be thankful; were it not for the fact that she was Malcolm's sister, Reese wouldn't have been so lenient.


Everly remained stubborn, "I'd rather die than apologize to you-ah... Reese, are you insane? Are you really going to do this?"


She never believed Reese would take things this far.Had the girl lost her mind? To secure an apology,was she actually willing to ruin her?


Reese exuded an intense aura of authority. Last chances Don't push me too far!" She warned.


Everly, who had lost all her earlier arrogance and was feeling the crunch, thought that if she didn't compromise today, Reese might genuinely harm her.


"Alright, I apologize. I was wrong to bother you and to be jealous," she conceded.


Only then did Reese relax. She stood up, releasing Everly, and straightened the wrinkles on her clothes.


"We better stay out of each other's way, or you're the one who's going to suffer," she told her-her final warning.


Finished, Reese walked past the staff members, who parted to make way for her. Everly lay on the bed, seemingly unable to move,her anger manifesting with a furious punch against the wall.


"Reese, I won't let this go!" she vowed.


Reese didn't take her seriously. It wasn't out of cruelty,but if she didn't teach Everly a lesson now,troubles like this would keep coming. Better to deal with it directly and give her enough pain to deter her from stirring things up again.


As she was getting ready to get into her car, Reese's phone rang. Alyssa was on the other end,sounding frantic.


"Reese, you've got to come quick, someone's trying to steal Darling from you."


Without thinking, she asked, "Who?"

###Chapter 85 To the Funeral Home


"Who else but your sister? She's here spouting nonsense,claiming Malcolm was originally going to marry her, but you swooped in and stole her man.She's evensaying Malcolm's people are coming to pick her up," Alyssa reported, her disgust palpable.


Alyssa watched from a distance, her skin crawling.This woman's exaggerations were beyond belief.


Having never been a fan of Reese, Alyssa found Dahlia Brooks even less likable, with her sharp, irritating demeanor, truly asking for a smackdown.


Reese was somewhat surprised: "Dahlia Brooks?
Where is she now?"


"She's by the entrance of the X Mall, boasting to her entourage of girlfriends. The things she's saying about you... it's unbearable. I can hardly stand it," Alyssa complained.


If it weren't for the risk of looking like a lunatic by confronting her, Alyssa felt tempted to give this Dahlia Brooks a piece of her mind. How couId Malcolm have ever been interested in her?


Reese knew the reason behind Dahlia's boasting. The whole Brooks family thought she was struggling with the Flynns,which was why there hadn't been any other moves.


Things were different now since Malcolm had personally knocked on the Brooks family's door,showing unmistakable favoritism toward her, sparking Dahlia Brooks's jealousy.

After all, being addressed as Mrs. Flynn was far more prestigious than being known simply as the big boss's mistress.


Even though Malcolm had a bad leg, hardly anyone dared to mess with her,given the Flynn family's renowned reputation.


Dahlia felt slighted yet lacked the guts to confront her.resorting to slandering her instead.


"If she's digging her own grave, she can't blame anyone when we give her a push," Reese said with a sly smile in her eyes. "Let her boast. Go up there, play along, and tell her that Malcolm will send someone to whisk her away to his villa for a romantic getaway."


Alyssa was taken aback. "Are you1 out of your mind?She's spreading these wild stories, and you want to help her spin this web of lies?"


Reese was running short on patience."Do you want tosee how this plays out or not? If you do, then do as I tell you."


Alyssa's curiosity was immediately piqued. "You've got a plan?"


"Just wait and you'll see. First,go up there and keep her occupied. Don't let her slip away, or you'll miss the show."


"I'm on it," Alyssa replied eagerly.


Dahlia was still on the steps,animatedly chatting with her clique. "If it wasn't for my sister practically begging me, I would be Mrs. Flynn right now. But no worries, Malcolm still has eyes for me. He's secretly dated me a few times behind my sister's back and is even picking me up for dinner at the restaurant later."


A girl, obviously post-cosmetic surgery, listened with envy. "X Restaurant? That's the city's finest, and of course, the priciest. The starting tab is in the five figures, but the service is superb. Once, an ex-boyfriend took me there."


"Oh my gosh, Dahlia, I'm so jealous. Even if Malcolm married your sister, it's clear his heart is still with you.You'll definitely have opportunities in the future."


Dahlia gave a coy smile. "No, it's better this way. My sister has been alone since childhood. We owe her.I couldn't destroy her happiness."


"Ah, Dahlia, you're too kind-hearted. Malcolm made the right choice. As long as he's devoted to you,you'll never have to worry about a thing in life."


"Dahlia, when's Malcolm swinging by to pick you up?We've all been dying to catch a glimpse of that blue-blood charm," one of the girls teased with a snicker. Dahlia Brooks managed a tight smile, "He... he might be a little while longer."


"Why don't you give him a buzz and see where he's at?"another chirped.


"I heard Malcolm has a voice that could make angels jealous," someone added with a wink.


On the surface, Dahlia maintained a polite grin, but inwardly she was seething, itching to give these girls a piece of her mind. How could she have Malcolm's number? She cursed their incessant prying, which had cornered her into spinning such a tale.


"Look, he's probably tied up in a meeting by now.It's getting late. Why don't y'all head on home, and I'll introduce him when we get a chance," Dahlia replied,her voice strained with effort.There was a girl nearby, draped in designer threads from head to toe, exuding an air of aristocracy that set her apart from the others.


"You haven't just made all this up, have you? If
Malcolm were really coming to get you, he'd be here by now," she said, skepticism in her tone.


Dahlia's face soured instantly.


"Who said he wasn't coming? Just you wait, I'm caling him right now," she snapped, defensive pride coloring her tone. The comparisons these girls often drew between her and Reese stung. Prancing around,they'd say Reese had better looks, more grace, more of everything.


How could Reese compare to her? Dahlia was the true heiress of the Brooks family,while Reese was merely an outsider from a small town, overshadowed by her father Kenneth's reputation. When it came to grace and beauty, Reese couldn't match Dahlia's level.


"Well, then get to it. Call him over and prove it," the girl goaded.


With a rigid neck, Dahlia retorted, "Fine, I will."


With that, she fumbled for her phone, thumb trembling as she scrolled through her contacts.Her trained smile was on the brink of collapse.


Just then, Alyssa stepped forward, "Hey Dahlia, is Malcolm not here yet?"


Dahlia was caught off guard, the color draining from her face as she faced Alyssa, Malcolm's sister. The last person she expected to encounter here. "You..." Dahlia stammered.


"Hi, everyone. I'm Malcolm's sister,Alyssa."


"It's true, Alyssa is Malcolm's sister. Looks like Dahlia is really with Malcolm," someone in the group whispered.


The chorus of envy arose among them, "Gosh, they're treating Dahlia as if she's already Mrs. Flynn of the Flynn family."


Meanwhile, Reese had already begun to spread the word.


"Just tell them you're here on behalf of the Flynn family to pick someone up, but take them to the funeral home." "Wait, the funeral home, as in for someone who's passed away?"


"No, they're very much alive. The name's Dahlia Brooks. Just do as you've been instructed, and you'll get your full payment."


Money talked for these guys. For the right price,it didn't matter to them if they were transporting the living or the dead.


"Alright, we're on our way."


"Thanks for your efforts."


Reese hung up the phone, a dismissive smirk flickering in her gaze. The idea that anyone would dare vie for her Darling without considering their own standing was ludicrous to her.On the other end, Alyssa was getting quite impatient.If it weren't for wanting to wvitness a spectacle unfold.she wouldn't even bother exchanging words with that sharp-tongued witch.


Dahlia Brooks didn't understand why Alyssa would go out of her way to speak up for her, but if it could smooth over this lie, she was grateful.


About fifteen minutes later, eyes widened as a procession of luxury cars rolled up, and cheers broke out.


"Dahlia, that's gotta be Malcolm's ride. So posh."


"Seriously, Dahlia, you're so lucky."


Dahlia herself could hardly believe her luck. She exchanged a meaningful glance with Alyssa,overflowing with gratitude. Alyssa played along. The poor fool likely thought this was her doing. But what was Reese's game,rustling up all these fancy cars out of thin air?


Soon enough, the sleek vehicles pulled up right in front of Dahlia, drawing the gaze of many onlookers.


The girls huddled around Dahlia were nearly bursting with envy.


"Why can't I see Malcolm?"


"Probably waiting in the car."


The lead car door swung open, and a man in a black suit stepped out, walking up to Dahlia.


"Excuse me, which one of you is Miss Dahlia?" Dahlia, blushing, replied, "I am. Did Malcolm send you?"


"Yes, the car is ready for you, please."


Something felt off to the man. Why head to a funeral home of all places? Was this some kind of sick joke?


With a glow of triumph, Dahlia sashayed towards the car,her slender waist twisting, as the grim-faced escorts began to sing something eerily resembling a dirge.
###Chapter 86 Reese's Cool Composure

Dahlia was struck dumb for a moment.Considering the crowd, she couldn't lash out - only force a smile while asking, "Is there some mistake? I mentioned Malcolm,as in Malcolm."


The man in black chuckled, "No mistake. We received a call to come pick you up."


The women standing alongside Dahlia Brooks,including Anna, who'd just been buttering her up,now erupted in laughter.


“Dahlia, looks like Malcolm's love for you is rather unique,huh? Instead of a mansion, he sends a luxury car to take you to a funeral home?"


“Seriously, what's up with that? It's almost like he's mocking you. I've never heard of anyone showingaffection by shipping someone off to a mortuary.”


Dahlia Brooks, who'd been so smug moments before,now looked utterly flustered, unable to preserve even a semblance of composure.


She whirled around, lashing out at them."Cut the crap! They must've made a mistake. Don't believe it?Ask Alyssa-she's Malcolm's sister, and she's right here. Would she be in on a lie?"


At that moment, Dahlia pinned all her hopes on Alyssa.


All eyes instantly snapped onto Alyssa, who merely let out a couple of awkward chuckles.


"Yeah, the ride was arranged by my brother Malcolm,that part's true. But him sending you to a funeral home? That's news to me. Seems like your love for him is a moth to a flame-destined to turn to ashes."


Dahlia's eyes nearly bulged out of her head, her face instantly turning ashen.


"That's not what you said earlier.”


"And what exactly did I say? I didn't say a thing. As for you,when did Malcolm take a lover on the side?This is the first I'm hearing of it. Sure, Reese wasn't exactly our family's first choice, but compared to your wild fabrications, she's a saint."


Alyssa was done putting up a front with Dahlia Brooks. She couldn't stand women like her who had nothing but pretended to be something they weren't.It was Dahlia who, upon hearing Malcolm might never walk again, worried she couldn't rely on him anymore and pushed Reese onto them. Now Dahlia had the gall to show up, fawning over them-it was downright revolting.


The realization finally hit Dahlia that she'd been played by Alyssa.


“You...”


Alyssa called out to the drivers,"What are you waiting for? Help her into the car. Miss Dahlia is too overwrought, probably can't even wvalk.”


The men in black, who had been well-paid by Reese,were there to carry out her instructions.


They approached Dahlia, one on each side, ready to escort her to the car.


Realizing it was a ride to a funeral home,Dahlia panicked and began to struggle desperately.


"No...let me go, I'm not getting in!"


Alyssa watched as Dahlia Brooks' once haughty face now resembled a deflated balloon wilted eggplant,and she couldn't help but feel a surge of glee.


With deliberate sarcasm she called out, "You better appreciate what Malcolm has done for you-riding in a luxury car like this isn't for just anyone."


"I'm not going! Let me go, you jerksjerk!"


Alone, Dahlia stood no chance against the group of men who promptly hoisted her into the car and slammed the door shut.


As the car drove away, Alyssa clapped her hands in triumph and strutted off.


Dahlia's entourage stood there, their mouths agape in utter shock.


The next time Reese's phone buzzed with a call from Alyssa,she couldn't contain her laughter on the other end.


"Oh my God, you should've seen your sister's face.I almost died laughing. She was all puffed up bragging to her little posse, acting like Malcolm had never seen a woman before. Then your crew showed up with the cars, and it was a total smackdown."


It was just a little lesson for Dahlia Brooks. Even if she wasn't into Malcolm, he was hers until she said otherwise, and certainly not for someone else to covet.


Dahlia really had some nerve, strutting around fooling everyone. If she wasn't taught a lesson, who's to say others wouldn't try to walk all over her,too?


"After all this, she'll probably think twice before showing off."


"By the way, where did you get those fancy cars? They must've cost a pretty penny, even to rent."


Alyssa had been meaning to ask; after all,Reese had just started at the company straight out of Backwoods -she most likely hadn't even gotten her first paycheck.


Reese couldn't blow her cover,so she casually deflected.


"Last time I saw him, Malcolm gave me his card." "Oh, that works. Feel free to splurge-Malcolm's looking for a girl to burn through his cash anyway.Reese, make sure you cover for me on the livestream tonight."


Alyssa remembered the upcoming challenge with other popular streamers-a gamble for the title of top broadcaster with the prospect of attending year-end conferences and meeting industry bigwigs. This was her dream, and it wasn't something money could buy;it had to be earned.


Reese, a person with little tolerance for dishonesty,also valued keeping her word.


"Don't worry, if I've made a promise, I'll keep it."


"Muah," Alyssa cooed,ending the call with audible joy. It didn't take long for Alyssa to recount the event with delighted laughter to Malcolm. Surprisingly.he had an unexpected take.


"Is Reese jealous or something?"


"Yeah, must be, or why go to all that trouble to set up Dahlia Brooks? You should've seen her face; it nearly cracked me up."


Alyssa felt a day's worth of amusement swell within her. Turns out,you didn't always need to confront sharply,sometimes slipping a sly one behind the scenes to embarrass someone worked even better.


Mhm,she made a mental note to learn a few tricks from Reese.


Malcolm, chuckling, had the shareholders around him utterly gobsmacked. There was Mr. Flynn, answering personal calls during meetings was one thing, but laughing? That was unheard of.


A shareholder couldn't help but ask his neighbor,as if he'd seen a ghost, "Am I seeing things, or did Mr.Flynn just laugh?"


"No, you saw right; he did laugh. I've been with the Flynn Group for years, never seen Mr. Flynn crack a smile. Every meeting, it's always that stern face. I feel like I need a heart check-up after each one, make sure it's still ticking."


"What can you do, Mr. Flynn's always tough on business. Every time we have a meeting, I feel as heavy as if I'm going to a funeral, half-scared my old bones won't be able to take a few harsh words from him," "I heard Mr. Flynn recently got hitched to a lady whose family isn't much to speak of."


"No wonder Mr. Flynn's been in high spirits,nothing like happy events to put a spring in your step."


Malcolm hadn't noticed the chatter below; he was fully engrossed in Alyssa's stories about Reese,even
picturing Reese's bright eyes twinkling with mischief,lips curved in a faint smile.


His wife, a true mastermind. Now, all those
troublemakers looking to get close to him would be dealt with.


"Bro, my friend's here; gotta go."


"Alright." Malcolm ended the call, quite pleased. He then turned to Justin Chabon and said, "When Reese arrives, send her to my office."


Justin's heart was pounding. What could Mr.Flynn want with Madam? Was it trouble, or just another public display of affection?


The thought made him shiver-not more lovey-dovey stuff; he'd die an early death from all the PDA.


Still, he dutifully responded to Malcolm's request, "Yes,Mr.Flynn."
###Chapter 87 Time for Action


As Reese walked into the office, she hadn't even punched in wwhen she ran into Isaac. He had been scarce around the office ever since their last confrontation, keeping a low profile. Surprisingly, he was here today, and as he passed by her, his face was a mask of displeasure, not even bothering with a greeting.


Reese was the kind of person who could outdo anyone in a battle of pride. To her, Isaac was hardly worth a second thought, especially after having bested him before.


She had just scanned her card and was about to hit the elevator button to close the doors when she heard Justin call out, "Reese, hold up!”


He hurried in, panting heavily. Reese casually asked, "Just got back?"


"Mr. Flynn had me fetch some documents,and he wanted me to tell you he's waiting in his office," Justin said,still catching his breath.


"Waiting for me?” Reese was puzzled. There didn't seem to be any reason for him to want to see her during work hours.


"Yes.”


"Did he say what it's about?" She had other tasks to attend to and planned to use her lunch break to dig into Jason Tartt's affairs.


"You'll find out when you get there," Justin replied,not daring to speculate. "Alright." Reese said, not objecting. In the company.Mr. Flynn was her boss, and she respected the chain of command.


Justin pressed the button for the seventeenth floor and followed Reese into Malcolm's office.


Malcolm Flynn sat in his executive chair, dressed in a sharp black suit that gave him an air of serious business acumen. He exuded an aura of pride that made most people wary of approaching him.Reese had seen many successful people in her life, but few possessed the imposing presence that Malcolm did,especially those eyes that seemed to intimidate with their piercing gaze.


Justin hesitated at the door, unsure of what was about to unfold inside.


"Mr. Flynn, Reese is here," he announced. "Okay,you can leave us," Malcolm's voice was low and magnetic, echoing pleasantly in the spacious office.


Justin quickly nodded and exited. As Reese closed the door,Malcolm gestured for her to come closer with a subtle, almost seductive tilt of his eyes.


“Come here.”
\

Reese was not one to take orders lightly. She stood her ground, arms crossed, gazing at Malcolm with an air of indifference.


"If you have something to say, just say it. I can hear you just fine from here.”


“I have something to discuss that shouldn't be overheard," he said mysteriously, insisting she come closer. Reese, who had been mentally preparing to investigate a matter, but also had pending work, reluctantly approached.


“Speak.”


She had always been indifferent to him unless Malcolm played a certain card. Otherwise,Reese remained as calm as a still lake, completely undisturbed.


Malcolm felt a twinge of frustration. Was he not good enough, not handsome enough, or lacking in charisma? Why did his wife seem as impassive as an iceberg that couldn't be melted?


Perhaps, he mused, it would take a more personal touch for her to warm up to him. But that was a minor challenge. They were, after all, husband and wife; fostering affection was just another task on his list.


He cleared his throat subtly, "I heard you've been name-dropping me around town. You even dragged your sister to the funeral home?"


Reese's bright eyes instantly darkened, and she gave Malcolm a cold,fleeting glance.


"Alyssa told you, didn't she?"


She should have known better than to trust that girl.


Malcolm raised an eyebrow. His demeanor softened when he addressed Reese as a hint of warmth crept into his usually icy gaze.


"So,using my name without permission is off-limits now?" Reese's eye twitched at his gentle tone. She was used to more straightforward,brash communication.
Malcolm's tenderness made her wary;she feared drowning in his gaze and losing herself in a charm she may never escape from.


She needed to stay alert to carry out her remaining plans.


"Should I let Dahlia slander me openly and tarnish the reputation of the rightful wife?"


Malcolm's lips curled into a sly smile as he reached for her delicate hand, his voice laced with pleasure.


"So,my wife is jealous?”


Reese recoiled at his words, instinctively pulling her hand back.
"I'm not the jealous type."


"Don't I deserve to be the object of jealousy?"


He reached to pull her closer, but Reese sidestepped his advance.


Why was he always so eager to embrace her?


"There's nothing that can affect me that deeply.Our marriage is merely a mutual arrangement. You want me to help you recover, and I'm here to fulfill a promise. It's best not to harbor feelings that shouldn't exist."


She knew men could easily detach from their emotions, while women often found themselves at a disadvantage, becoming pitifully entangled. She refused to become one of those women. She constantly reminded herself to guard her heart.knowing that the moment she allowed herself to feel.she would be doomed to suffer a crushing defeat.


Malcolm was curious, “You're barely in your twenties and haven't been around many men. How can you be so sure your husband is unreliable?"


"It's simple. You're a man. If you were a woman,maybe I'd have a shred of trust. But men like you rarely take feelings seriously. All you men do is chase fleeting thrills. If you don't want me mentioning your name in the future, I can apologize for this incident."


Reese was stern, but Malcolm's lips twitched with amusement.


"Alright, apologize to me. But I don't want just words.I want action."
Reese's expression turned icy, "What do you want me to do?"



Malcolm tapped his lips thoughtfully, “A kiss will suffice for forgiveness.”
###Chapter 88 Reese, the Actress


Without a second thought, Reese flatly rejected the idea."In your dreams."


"Well, then I'll just kiss you," Malcolm retorted without a hint of concern, yet before he could even lean in, Reese had already pushed him away.


Her heart raced, especially as Malcolm closed in. His presence was overwhelming, almost monopolizing the air around her.



It wasn't that Reese hadn't been around men, but one with Malcolm's blend of dashing looks and flirtatious charm was a first for her, leaving her reeling.


What made it worse was his unpredictability. Here he sat in front of you, and yet you had no clue what he might do next. She was partly annoyed with his antics.


What if she really fell for him, only for him to claim it was all just a laugh?


Reese knew that kind of blow mnight be more than even she could withstand. She much preferred her impassive, unaffected self.


Her gaze suddenly sharpened, a strong warning resonating in her voice.


"Malcolm, any more nonsense and I'll seriously consider annulling our marriage sooner than planned."


Malcolm had to admit that Reese's stare wasn't exactly intimidating to him, but for someone her age, it was surprisingly piercing. He couldn't help but chuckle. The soft overhead lighting bathed his face as his warm smile shined like the sun, seeming to chase away the chill in her heart.


"Once you enter the Flynn household and become my bride,leaving won't be so easy," he teased.


Reese was not one to be threatened, defiance sparkling in her eyes.


"You're welcome to try."


Malcolm saw her serious, intense expression-prickly as a hedgehog, ready to defend itself with all its might -and just smiled, raising an eyebrow.


"Upset again?"


Reese was so vexed she felt like hitting someone. Shealways thought of herself as composed, but this man always managed to provoke her with ease.


Yet sometimes his gentle look made her heart soft. He was her husband in name, after all, and there was no denying his striking and captivating appearance.


"T'll be leaving now unless you have something else,Mr. Flynn?" Reese said,her face still cool.


She didn't want to waste her time bantering with him,potentially ending up all frazzled.


"Actually, I do have something," Malcolm responded,placing a document in front of her. "I need this by noon."


Reese took it and skimmed through it nonchalantly-it was the plan she'd previously swiped. What was Malcolm playing at? He had always kept a tight grip on this project.He was basically locking it away, so why was he suddenly making it available to her?


Was it a test, or something else entirely?


They were both playing a guessing game, trying to decipher each other's thoughts, with one vital difference - Malcolm's identity was an open book,so there was no guessing required there; it was his true intentions that remained a mystery.


Malcolm had a reputation in the industry for having only one expression, a poker face that made it impossible to predict his next move. He always chose the path less traveled, which was exactly why the Flynn Group remained the unparalleled leader in the business world.


Reese couldn't figure him out entirely either, but she was determined not to let on.


"I might need a little time to go through this." Reese said,closing her file. "Is it okay if I get back to you before lunch?"


Malcolm's gaze rested on her as his lips twitched with a hint of teasing amusement. "It's that tough that you need till lunch? I thought you'd be quite familiar with this project."


His implication was clear, and Reese certainly didn't miss his probing tone, especially with his relentless stare that would unnerve most. But she stood her ground, "You're just holding a grudge and making fun of me. You know about my education, my family -aren't you simply mocking me by bringing this up?"


She pouted in displeasure and looked away. Her acting was so convincing that anyone might think she was genuinely upset.


Seeing Reese show a side so unlike her usual icy demeanor piqued Malcolm's curiosity anew; it was a change he found quite appealing. Temporarily shelving his suspicions, he approached Reese, reaching to pull her close,but she sidestepped.


"Don't touch me," she said, the irritation in her voice softened by a hint of coyness that made his heart flutter.


No matter her mood, be it anger or cold aloofness, she captivated him - she was juast his type.


"Are you angry again?" His voice was low and seductive, stirring something inside her. Reese's calm heart began to beat faster, and her pale cheeks flushed pink. Malcolm was dangerously irresistible.
She would have never played coy if it wasn't for her need to dispel his doubts and get past this hurdle. "If you suspect something, just have Justin Chabon check it out. No need for passive-aggressive comments."


Reese's eyes shone with an openness that almost convinced him of her innocence.


Malcolm wanted to say Justin Chabon wouIdn't find anything but admitting that would bruise his pride.Her pitiful look melted his heart after all. The allure of his charming wife was a hurdle he couldn't overcome,nor did he want to. Who could resist when one's spouse was so perfectly endearing?


"If you don't want to tackle it, I could pass it off to someone else."


He reached out to snatch the documents from her grasp, but Reese was having none of it."No need, it'll be on your desk before lunch," she said.straightening her back and striding out of the office.


Malcolm watched her go, a gut feeling telling him his petite wife had layers hidden beneath the surface-maybe even a thwarted actor, lost to the entertainment world.


A bit more teasing and she might have even shed a tear.


Justin Chabon stood at the door, his features clouding with displeasure as he watched Reese exit. He couldn't help feeling surprised.


Had Mr. Flynn upset Reese? That didn't make sense-with how pleased Flynn seemed with her lately,shouldn't they have been all lovey-dovey inside?


He pushed open the door and stepped in. "Mr. Flynn, about Reese-"


"Don't worry about it. Come here, I have instructions for you."


Justin approached and Malcolm handed him a file.Justin's eyebrows shot up as he looked it over.


"Mr. Flynn, if Reese finds out about this, won't she be upset?"
###Chapter 89 A Difficult Decision


Malcolm's expression darkened. None of the
tenderness he had shown to Reese remained, and his tone was now ice-cold.


"Who told you to inform her?"


Justin bowed his head. "Ill get in touch with the platform right away."


Outside Malcolm's office, Reese's ivory complexion returned to its usual unemotional poise.


They both knew the other's gambits all too well; it just wasn't time to tear down that facade yet. Malcolm's repeated probes came from his lack of concrete proof.


Absence of evidence was no trouble for her-she could onjure up ways to stay unscathed even if there were any.


After reflecting on her own acting,she found herself cringing slightly.


Settled back at her desk, Reese opened the files and got to work, when Sophia Linden approached. As the department head and undoubtedly the most beautiful woman in the office, Sophia was the popular favorite among the male colleagues, her delicate charm never went unnoticed.


Recent rumors of a sensation named Reese had reached her before her plane touched down;a supposed ugly duckling who had somehow transformed into an uinrivaled beauty with an elite aura-an impeccable ice queen. Of course, Sophia had to see for herself.
 She was a sight in a red sheath dress, cut low enough to reveal a generous hint of cleavage. With every coy smile and subtle gesture, she exuded a sensuality that was in stark contrast to Reese's understated demeanor.


Reese, for her part, was entirely focused on the spreadsheet in front of her. The task wasn't particularly tough, just incredibly time-consuming, and her fingers were flying over the keyboard to the point of exhaustion.


Sophia Linden had been standing beside her for a while now, not that Reese gave any indication of noticing. Fixated on her computer screen, Reese's slender fingers danced across the keys with such speed that, were it not for the accurate taly of numbers on the display, Sophia would have thought Reese was just hitting keys at random.


Turning her head, Sophia shot a glance at Lilly,
"Didn't you say she got the job through backdoor channels and only had a high school diploma? This speed, this accuracy, does that seem like highschool work to you?"


Lilly couldn't quite figure Reese out and pulled Sophia aside. "Look, I've only recently taken over here, and don't have all the details on Reese. But her resume does say she's only a high school grad, that's true."


Sophia Linden felt Reese was all smoke and mirrors.She'd seen all sorts, and to her, Reese was nothing special - just someone with a pretty face and a certain poise. She had no curves to speak of, absolutely flat as a board where it counted.


Pushing past Lilly, Sophia marched up and rapped her knuckles on the desk in front of Reese. "Hey, newbie."


Without so much as a glance, Reese responded, "In a minute."Tension filled the office once more, and their colleagues craned their necks, anticipoating the newcomer's next move. Sophia Linden, an old hand at the company and a crafty leader,waited with impatience.


Reese was just a regular worker; what waves could she possibly make?


Never one to be ignored, Sophia now knocked more firmly on the desk again . "Reese!"


With an unhurried tap on the 'Enter' key completing her input, Reese finally looked up, languidly."What's up?"


Her tone was so nonchalant and devoid of any formality.


Sophia knew of Reese's growing presence in the department-aloof and defiant, not deigning to acknowledge anyone. But Reese's casual indifference caught her off guard.


This woman was far too cavalier for her liking.


Since Reese wasn't extending any pleasantries,Sophia felt no need to offer any herself. Throwing a project file onto Reese's desk, she said, "I've heard you're quite capable. Even managed to land a deal that Mr. Flynn himself couldn't secure."


With a lazy flick of her eyelid, Reese responded,"And?"


Sophia's face, carefully made up, tensed slightly with a flicker of anger starting to surface.

"Reese, what's with the attitude? I get that you might not see eye to eye with Lilly as your team leader,but
I'm the department head. I've been here since this company was founded. Don't you have anyrespect for your superiors?"


They had seen many newcomers, but never one as brash and overbearing as Reese. She acted as if she owned the place.


Reese remained unfazed. Ever since she started at the company,she had faced her fair share of troublemakers,and ordinary employees probably wouldn't dare cross her.


But those who fancied themselves as team leaders or department heads? They seemed to make it their mission to get under her skin, and it was starting to really get to her.


Why couldn't everyone just mind their business and live in peace?
"I haven't disrespected you. If you have work-related instructions. I'm all ears. But you come at me.
accusing me of disrespect without even a hello? That, I can't accept."


Though somewhat of a loner, she had a clear sense of right and wrong. Whether these people were genuinely assigning her work or just looking for trouble, Reese could see right through their facade without them having to say a word.


Her pointed response caught Sophia Linden, who had been so haughty moments before, off-guard.


"There's a contract, a partner wants to terminate it.You handle it.”


Reese didn't even glance at the papers as she took them on board. “Got it.”


"And one more thing, we have a mixer tomorrow night. Everyone from our department is expected to attend. Prepare a talent or something."


At the mention of the mixer, Reese frowned. She wasn't fond of these bustling events, filled with people faking pleasantries.


"Can I skip it?”


“No,”Sophia Linden said with finality.


Lilly whispered cheekily, "Miss Linden, from what I've heard,Reese is a country girl with limited edlucation.She probably doesn't have any talents to show off."


"That's okay. It's just a welcome gathering for new colleagues. Since she's here, she can perform whatever she knows. We're all colleagues; no one's going to laugh at you."


Sophia Linden's words left Reese without an out.


Her standoffish personality, along with an incident where she'd had a physical altercation with Isaac at work, made her colleagues wary. Many even mocked her behind her back.


If she refused, her relationship with her coworkers would only sour further.


Some of her colleagues couldn't help but gossip, "It's clear as day, they're just setting Reese up for embarrassment.”


“What can you do? That's how it is. Besides, Miss Linden has been the star of the company for years, and Reese has just swept in and stolen the spotlight."


"Yeah, if she wasn't so full of herself, I might have considered riding her coattails. Who knows,maybe one of the guys at work would take a fancy to me,"the voice dripped with a mix of sarcasm and wishful thinking.


Sophia Linden waited with thinly veiled anticipation for Reese's response. If Reese agreed, great. If not,she'd likely become even less popular among her coworkers.


It was a lose-lose situation for Reese.


The whole office held its breath, waiting for her decision.
###Chapter 90 Malcolm Makes a Hefty Offer
After an awkward silence that stretched over several seconds, with Reese not uttering a word, Sophia's smile grew wider as her eyes glittered with triumph.She assumed Reese was chickening out.


"If you're too scared, we'd all understand. Coming from the sticks and handling this job is already impressive enough. We don't really expect much from you," Sophia sneered, turning to flash a knowing look at Lilly, who nodded subtly before addressing the office onlookers.


"Alright, everyone, back to work. Since Reese is opting out of joining our social gathering, let's not push her.After all, she's not one of us, We should be more understanding," Lilly said in her mock-sympathetic tone, her voice dripping with condescension.
Just as Lilly and Sophia were about to strut away.
proud of their perceived victory. Reese finally spoke up.


"Tll do it."


The two shared a glance, smirking at their apparent manipulation.


"Great, let's make it even more interesting. How about we have Miss Linden and Reese go head-to-head? It's all in good fun, right? What do you all say?" One of the onlookers suggested, igniting murmurs of agreement.


"Miss Linden and Reese are the department's most attractive ladies. If it's between the two of them,the turnout will be huge. It's gonna be quite the show."


Reese couldn't help but inwardly scoff at their idea of 'entertainment.' They just wanted to see her make a fool of herself.


Sophia's eyes shone with pride. She was well-trained in dance, having practiced since childhood,which explained her graceful moves.


Reese, while she wasn't lacking in looks, was just a country girl. Getting three square meals a day was achievement enough, let alone having time to hone any dance skills.


Sophia was confident she would outshine Reese and reclaim the spotlight.


But Reese had a plan of her own and confidently accepted the challenge.

"Okay, but don't expect too much; dancing isn't really my thing. Just don't laugh at me," Reese conceded with a sense of nonchalance that belied her nerves.


Lilly responded with a victor's grin, "We're all colleagues here. Why would we laugh?"


Sophia's heart was already racing with anticipation for tomorrow's social event.


"See you tomorrow then, Reese. Better get ready,"Sophia said,barely containing her eagerness.


Reese nodded slightly, and Sophia Linden exited with Lilly following.


The office returned to its usual quiet as lunchtime neared. Reese hadn't yet finished her workload,which should've been wrapped up by eleven. Unexpectedly,Sophia Linden dropped another contract in her lap,and now she needed to carve out a moment to revi ew it. She always kept an eye out for new business opportunities. She was indifferent to most things except the prospect of making money.Reese never let a chance slip by if there was even a sliver of potential.


Her colleague, roughly the same age and possessing a delicate beauty, seemed particularly reserved and was quite small in stature, eliciting an instinctual protectiveness in others.


Initially,the young woman seemed intimidated by Reese,so she kept her distance. But when Reese sensed someone near, she looked up to find a pair of hesitant eyes watching her cautiously.


"Need something?" Reese asked.


"I got an extra meal from the cafeteria. Here, it's for you," the girI said, offering up the boxed lunch.Reese didn't take it immediately. She was curious why the girl would bring her food when no one else in the company seemed to want any unnecessary contact with her. Their glances often bore a mix of alienation and fear, as though she were a creature from another world.



Misunderstanding the hesitation, the girl hurriedly clarified, "Don't worry, the meal is clean."


"That's not what I mean. I just findit strange that no one else talks to me, and yet you came over on your own," Reese said.


The girl, clearly timid, even in speaking up, was practically invisible around the office.


"Because you're the only one in this company whocan stand up to them," the girl said simply and then walked away. Reese watched her petite figure retreat, remembering the look of apprehension and fear in her eyes.
Instinctively, she knew the girl must have been
through some sort of trauma or unfair treatment to end up so faint-hearted.


Her observations since joining the company suggested the usual workplace targets and isolation, which could easily break someone without inner strength, just like this girl.


After looking at the steaming boxed meal in front of her and then glancing at the time on her computer screen, Reese realized there was no chance to grab lunch out. She still neededto call Calvin.

Lifting the lid without any fuss, she started eating with the fork, t hen got up and headed outside.


Stepping off the curb, her phone rang-it was Calvin, saving her the trouble of calling him.


"Reese, there's a gig with a six-figure bounty. You in?"


"Six figures!" Reese was taken aback. She had only created a profile on that platform for kicks, never expecting someone to actually drop that kind of money.


"Yeah, a six-figure gig to investigate someone."


"Just take the message for now. Did they say when they need the results?" She never passed up a chance to make some cash.


Calvin chuckled on the phone, "Reese, why don't you ask who's asking, or who you're supposed to look into?”"As long as they pay on time. I don't care about the who or why."


Something about Calvin seemed off to Reese today.


He grinned through the phone like he couldn't wait to spill a secret. "I think you need to know-the target
they want information on is you. They sent everything,pictures too."


Reese laughed, "Someone's digging up dirt on me?And they've got photos?"


Looks like they came prepared.


"Yup,take a wild guess who's willing to pay top dollar for the scoop on you?"


"Do I really need to guess? Who else but Malcolm?" It wasn't rocket science to figure that out. especially since Malcolm's suspicions never eased after his files were stolen.



Who knew how many secret searches he'd commissioned since then, though apparently, he hadn't found what he was looking for.


The thought alone made Calvin chuckle.


"Reese, you have no idea. When I saw your name,
Louis and I nearly died laughing. It's like, he's paying you to investigate yourself."


"It just proves that our security is solid if he's come up empty-handed."


There was a reason for Reese to celebrate. With Malcolm, what you see wasn't always what you get-it was often just a smoke screen.
Calvin's curiosity got the better of him. "So, Reese.are you taking it?"


Reese pondered, her hand stroking her chin.


"Turn it down."


"Why not? Even if your 'darling' doesn't hire us, he'll just find someone else."


"Reject him flat out. Trust me, he won't give up."


Her voice was confident, the picture of a master strategist.


Calvin sounded incredulous, "For real? Reese, think it over. If he gives up, we miss out on a good payday."
###Chapter 91 Reese Ambushed

"Do I sense some skepticism in your voice?" Reese countered. "When have I ever steered you wrong?"


Calvin paused to consider. Actually, she was spot on-her predictions always came true. She had a fitting nickname in their circle: the oracle.


Whenever she foresaw something, it tended to happen,even if not immediately, the outcome was inevitable.


And that was one of the many reasons they held Reese in such high regard.


Calvin decided to trust Reese as he always did,"Alright, Reese, I'll do as you say and turn him down for now." "Go handle that; I've got a meeting."


"Who you meeting with, Reese?" Calvin wondered to himself, half-joking that Reese might be sneaking off to see a secret lover behind Malcolm's back.


"I've got a new contact who claims to have dirt on Jason. What I found out before doesn't seem complete enough."


Reese had stumbled upon this source online during a morning search at the office. They demanded a steep price, but given Jason's extraordinary circumstances,Reese thought it was worth taking the risk. Besides,if it turned out to be a scam, she wouldn't pay a dime -no harm done.


"Then go, but be careful. I'lllet you know if anything comes up here."
 Okay,gotta go."


She ended the call and made her way across the street to a narrow lane, the agreed meeting spot. It seemned she had gotten there a bit early; the person hadn't arrived yet.


She was about to dial the person's number when her phone lit up with Malcolm's name.


Reese hesitated before answering.


"The contract has been reviewed and is ready on my desk. Just have Justin swing by to collect it."


"You're not at the office?"


"No, I'm...” Before Reese could finish, she spotted several men closing in from all sides, their approachmenacing.


Malcolm, sensing the sudden chaos on Reese's end and her abrupt pause, furrowed his brow in concern,"Reese, where are you?"


Those men were clearly targeting her. Reese's eyes flashed with resolve, and even her tone hardened as she spoke, "Got something to handle,I'll call you back."


"Reese..."


Malcolm's call went unanswered, leaving nothing but a chilling dlial tone.


He barked towards the door, "Justin, get in here!"


Justin burst through the office door, "What's up, Mr. Flynn?"


"Locate Reese, now." The urgency was evident in his voice, and his expression was grim.


Justin had never seen Mr. Flynn so rattled,but he knew better than to ask questions,"On it."


When Justin returned, he reported without delay,"Reese is down the path near the office."


"Check it out."

Meanwhile,Reese stood defiantly surrounded by towering figures, not a trace of fear on her face.


She surveyed the intimidating men, "Who sent you?"


Being able to pinpoint her exact location like that,they must've had tabs on her movements beforehand.


The leader of the pack had a bat resting on his shoulder and a toothpick danglng from his lips.giving him the look of a street thug straight out of central casting.


"We just do what we're paid for. As for who's got it out for you, we're not at liberty to say."


One of his cronies, who was eyeing Reese up and down without a shred of decency, piped up, "Malcolm,this chick's pretty hot, and what a figure!"


The rest of the group smirked and snickered in agreement.


"Malcolm, you get first dibs, eh? We're just here for the show."They rubbed their hands together in anticipation, as if they couldn't wait to get started.


The toothpick guy cut to the chase with Reese,
"Someone wants to try you out for a little. Play nice,and we might make it somewhat pleasurable for you.Otherwise, if you get hurt, don't expect us to care."


"Yeah, babe, relax. We'll make sure you're more than satisfied," another chimed in with a sleazy grin.


As one of them moved to caress Reese's cheek,she gave him an icy glare, grabbed his wrist, and launched a kick straight to his gut,sending him stumbling backward.


Clutching his belly in agony, his face turned ashen,and a cold sweat broke out across his forehead.


"My stomach...it hurts so bad...""Malcolm, that bitch knows how to fight!" One of the men exclaimed.somewhat shocked.


Toothpick guy was surprised too, but he remained unfazed. They had the numbers, after all. A lone girl was no match for them.


He raised his hand, signaling a pause, and looked at Reese. "Sweetheart, no matter how well you fight,you can't beat all of us. If you know what's good for you,you'll take care of us."


His shameless words were met with loathsome snickers from the men behind him.


Reese's gaze swept over their despicable faces with the sharpness of a knife. "You think you can touch me?Please." The man Reese had hit, still holding his stomach, felt the chill in her eyes and something deep inside him panicked.


He tugged at Malcolm's sleeve. "Maybe we should just drop it, Malcolm. There's something about this girl,man. Her eyes...I get the chills just looking at her."


He felt like the eyes of death itself were bearing down on his soul.


One of his buddies couldn't help but laugh at him."Scared by a single kick? That's pathetic, man.Just watch us handle her."


Toothpick guy gave his orders. "Take her down."


Reese sneered. "Come at me all at once. I've got better things to do than waste time with you losers."Her words were brazen, and her expression was the cherry on top of her defiance.


Malcolm and his crew erupted in jeers, mocking her bold defiance.


"She must be out of her mind; she thinks wve'll all take her on together?"


A chuckle rippled through the group, "Hey, we don't mind at all. It's your pint-sized frame I worry about not holding up."


The innuendo was clear, and the others burst out laughing alongside him.


Reese casually picked up a stick from the ground and brandished it with fierce determination. "Cut the crap; let's get this over with."


The toothpick guy tossed his toothpick to the ground and sneered, "Alright guys, let's do this."


They charged at Reese with a menacing ferocity, but she gripped her makeshift weapon tightly, her movements agile and eyes flashing with an icy resolve.


The toothpick guy had underestimated the gil;her agility infuriated him, and he bellowed, "Don't hold back on her; any of you!"


Even with Reese's quick skills, the numbers against her began to tell, and injuries started to mark her body. Yet, the ferocious light in her eyes never once dimmed.


From a distance, Justin suddenly raised thealarm. "Mr. Flynn, that gang's picking a fight with the lady!"


Malcolm caught sight of Reese's petite figure amidst the crowd. Even surrounded, she stood out to him.


He frowned, feeling very annoyed, "That girl is playing with fire!"
###Chapter 92 Just Another Day


It wasn't like Justin hadn't been around the block; he had seen his fair share of crazy situations. But witnessing a girl going toe-to-toe with more than a dozen guys was something else entirely, a true rarity.


Was she overly confident, or was it the fearlessness of youth? Justin couldn't tell. He turned to Malcolm and began, "Mr. Flynn,should I-"


Before he could finish, Malcolm rose from his wheelchair like it was nothing, grabbing a stick from the ground and striding towards the crowd.


Justin froze, his mind racing. What the heck? When did Mr. Flynn's legs...?


Overcome with rage, Malcolm swung the stick with bone-crushing force, landing blows on the thugs while kicking the one sneaking up on Reese.


Spinning around, Reese caught sight of Malcolm.
"What are you doing here?"


With a cocky smirk, Malcolm said, "They're messing with my wife. You think I'd stay away?"


"But your legs..."


"They've been fine for a while." He hadn't found the right moment to tell her.


Reese thought she could handle these guys no problem, but nobody could fight forever. They were wearing her down, and she could only stand her ground for so long.


With Malcolm here now, at least she could buy some time.


"Watch your own back then. I might not be able to help you," Reese said, thinking of his recent recovery and doubting that he could match her agility.


A lethal glint flashed in Malcolm's eyes. "Don't underestimate me."


No sooner had he spoken, than Malcolm took the lead like a seasoned pro. Reese watched, eyes wide as Malcolm knocked down five men with rapid,precise strikes, leaving them howling in pain on the ground.The man was truly a force to be reckoned with.


This wasn't the sluggishness associated with injury;this was expert agility.


Malcolm quickly subdued the men with clean,
practiced moves. It was clear to any onlooker that he was no amateur; his skills were world class.


Reese always thought that she was well-trained, even receiving accolades from national coaches and holding a title herself. But seeing Malcolm in action proved the old saying was true: there was always someone better.


No wonder she struggled when sparring with Malcolm, even when he was supposedly handicapped.His facade was just that, a facade.


He had hidden his true abilities well. After this, Reese knew she had to reassess this enigmatic man named Malcolm, who was now even more mysterious than ever.


Not only Reese but even Justin was left slack-jawed.The last time he'd seen Mr. Flynn throw down was before his car accident. Back then,Flynn could strike terror into any adversary with his swift moves-clash with him once, and you wouldn't dare come back for seconds.


Now here was Reese, a ferocious contender herself-a young woman in her twenties bold enough to take on a group of muscular men single-handedly.She had guts, the kind very few possess.


The Flynns had always been a formnidable clan, and with the arrival of the enigmatic Reese, their ranks swelled with even more talent.



Watching Reese, it was clear she was a perfect match for them, fitting right in with the Flynn aura.


Toothpick guy was sprawled on the ground, twitching in pain, his face ashen as he glared at Malcolm. "You... you hit harder than she does," he hissed.Malcolm tossed aside the stick and bent down slightly.his long fingers grabbing Toothpick guy by the collar,a chilling ferocity in his eyes.


“Who sent you?”


Just meeting Malcolm's gaze sent shivers down Toothpick guy's spine. He had been genuinely frightened by Malcolm's pounding; each punch was delivered with ruthless force.


If he didn't spill the beans soon, he feared it might be the end of him.


"A woman... named Susan. She told us to ruin this girl's reputation, take pictures, and send them to her.”


Reese's expression shifted instantly. Susan... wasn't she the one Malcolm had fired?Malcolm's brow furrowed subtly,simmering with a quiet rage.


"How much did she pay you?"


"Fifty... fifty thousand," Toothpick guy replied,cringing backward despite Malcolm's grip on his collar, his presence as unnerving as a brewing storm.


Malcolm flung him away like trash, turning his head slightly and giving Justin a nod.


"Give him a hundred grand. Whatever Susan told him to do, let him do it to her instead."


Justin's heart skipped a beat. Mr. Flynn was ready to retaliate, to have whatever Susan had ordered done to herself. "Understood."”


Malcolm approached Reese with a measured stride,the menace on his face melting away as his warm hand gently caressed her cool cheek.


“Are you hurt anywhere?"


Overwhelmed by the softness in his eyes, Reese's heart fluttered, and, flustered, she turned her face away.


"It's nothing serious; just some scrapes."


"Even a minor injury needs attention," Malcolm said,taking Reese's hand and leading her towards the trail outside. Reese's mind went blank at that moment; she usually despised the touch of strangers, yet now she found herself being led by the hand without protest.
She couldn't recall exactly how she ended up in the car until she heard Malcolm's voice jolt her back to reality.


She stared at him, perplexed, "What did you say?"


"Lift up your shirt; let me take a look," he commanded, his voice firm and undeniable.


Instead of doing as told, Reese clutched her shirt tightly and eyed Malcolm warily.


"No need. I can handle a little scratch."


He casually rested a hand on the back of the seat,in no rush.


"Maybe, but some spots you just can't reach." Her resolve was firm, "I've got it; I don't need your help."


"I'm your husband," he stated, using his status as a card to play, insinuating that as spouses, who else but him could apply the first aid cream on her?


Reese recoiled subconsciously, "Even if you are, it doesn't matter. We haven't... There's been no real marital intimacy between us yet."


No man had seen an inch of her skin hidden beneath her clothes, and that included MMalcolm,her husband.It was understood between them that their marriage was in name only, devoid of any intimate gestures.


Justin returned to the car after handling matters and offered up the first aid cream.


"Mr. Flynn, I got the first aid cream here."
Good. Grab some water too; she might get thirsty."


Justin glanced at Reese, who looked as guarded as if she were warding off thieves. He held back a smile and headed to the store.


Malcolm,holding the first aid cream and determination flickering in his deep eyes, said,"I'll apply it only where you can't reach yourself. It's better to take care of this now than to stubbornly wait and risk an infection. Do you want to end up at the hospital? Filled with male doctors, no less. Aren't I more pleasant for you than them?"


He made a compelling argument, leaving Reese without a good counter.


Her back did sting, possibly from a lucky blow from some thug earlier. If only she wasn't so out of shape,she might have sent those bullies to the hospital for a lengthy stay.


Having Malcolm apply the first aid cream wasn't out of the question; it was just a mmatter of being unaccustomed. She may have even felt a bit shy.


She'd never been the delicate type; she never even flinched when she received wounds in fights that would make others scream. Why would she fear Malcolm's medicinal touch?


She had to admit, each time he came close, especially with that gentle tone, she found it hard to maintain her defenses.


She never expected to be charmed by any man,yet here she was, heart racing and tooflustered to meet his gaze.


Malcolm had been waiting for Reese's answer for a while. He wasn't annoyed; he just glanced down at his watch.


"I have a meeting later."


The hint couldn't be any clearer; it would seem almost rude if Reese didn't agree.


Reese turned away hesitantly:“Okay...”


Hearing her tone, Malcolm couldn't help but chuckle,"It's just applying some first aid cream,why do you look like you're heading to the gallows?"


Her tone carried a sense of resignation; what was she really implying?
###Chapter 93 I Got You Covered


Malcolm couldn't help but let out a soft laugh, "Why all the nerves?"


"Aren't you in a hurry? Go on then," Reese urged impatiently, her restlessness born more of anxiety than annoyance.


When Malcolm lifted her shirt, a cool breeze brushed her skin, causing Reese to shiver.


Her skin was soft and delicate, except for a deep bruise on her waist; it looked like someone had really let her have it. She must've borne the pain because most people would be down for the count with that kind of hurt.


His fingers cool yet gentle, touched the bruise, making Reese inhale sharply. "Ouch...”


"How come you didn't feel it earlier? Picking a fight like that, are you out of your mind?"


Malcolm's words were usually soft and tender towards Reese, unlike today, his tone laced with an unspoken reprimand.


Reese bit back her pain and retorted stubbornly,
"What would you have me do? Let them violate me and wake up to scandalous photos of myself in the news the next day?"


After all, she wasn't just fighting for her own dignity but also for the reputation of the Flynn family. And yet,instead of gratitude, he was scolding her.


Malcolm applied the first aid cream gently, his voiceas patient as ever. "I'm worried about you, silly girl. Other women your age are thinking about love or basking in their boyfriend's affection. But not you; you're ready to battle like a warrior, leaving me feeling rather inept as a husband."


The thought of rumors getting out,claiming that Malcolm couldn't even defend his own wife against a bùnch of street thugs...


Reese's troubled heart rippled with his words,a strange sensation blooming deep within,a feeling unfamiliar to her, for no one had spoken words of care to her in all her twenty-something years.


Even to Calvin and his friends, she was the indestructible and all-powerful Miss Brooks, as if suach a grand title denied her the right to weakness.It seemed she had to embody strength and,indeed,be strong.
 Malcolm's focus on Reese's injury meant he missed the girl's downcast eyes and the dimming light within them.


Reese had never known the feeling of being cherished.But she knew full well thatno one chose to be invulnerable. Without strength, who would see her vulnerability?


She couldn't help but mock herself, "Like you said,some people are cherished. I'm not."


No matter what happened, even if the sky came falling down, only she could hold it up.


Malcolm's fingers, applying the first aid cream, stopped as Reese felt his warm breath on her delicate skin. She wanted to disappear.


"How can you say no one cherishes you now?'Isn'tyour husband caring enough for you?"


Hearing Reese's voice, he sensed her story-a girl shielded by a frosty distance and distrust for others,like a hedgehog who wrapped herself up in solitude whether in sorrow or hurt.


Even on her loneliest nights, she chose to remain by herself.


His chest felt as though it was being tugged,aching slightly.


Suddenly, Reese felt warmth envelop her back as the man behind her held her tight. Her spine stifened,her body tense.


She heard his deep, resonant voice next to her ear,"From now on, I'll take good care of you. No more suffering, no more injustice. For the rest of our lives, I'll be there to protect you."


Reese's eyes narrowed, and her heart skipped a beat;she was momentarily at a loss for a response.


Malcolm's words dropped likea stone on her calm heart, rippling its surface.


This moment of harmony was soon shattered by Reese as she remembered her mother. Kenneth had also promised lifetime care and undivided attention. In the end, what burdens had she been left with?


Utterly ruined, her mother hadn't even retained her life.


If her mother had possessed half the sense and indifference Reese had now, she might still be alive. To be happy and strong as a woman, one had to keep her distance from men. Without men's cruelty,the world wvouldn't have so many piteous women.


The emotional stir within her was brought back under control by reason, and the chill returned to Reese's eyes. She thrust her elbow into Malcolm's waist.


Caught off guard, the man winced in pain and reflexively stepped back.


Reese turned around, straightened her clothes, and told him firmly.


"I don't need anyone to protect me. I can protect myself."


After saying that, she tugged open the car door.With determination etched into her movements,she stepped out, her figure gradually fading from Malcolm's line of sight.


At that moment. Justin hurried over with a bottle of mineral water. "Mr. Flynn, your water," he said,about to hand it off as he took a quick glance around the interior of the car. "Where's Reese?"


"She left," Malcolm said, his hands fidgeting with a tube of first aid cream as a wry smile danced acrOSS his lips.


Malcolm had never felt such a sense of defeat with women before-Reese had coldly rejected him.


How deeply had she been hurt?


"What about Reese's injuries...?"

  
"I checked them out, no big deal. By the way,have you reached out to the contact from the platform yet?What's the word?"


Justin looked troubled. "They turned me down."


"Turned down?" A flicker of surprise crossed the depths of Malcolm's dark eyes. "Even after the six-figure offer?"


He had made a generous offer.


Justin's expression grew somber. "I'm not exactly sure of the details. They just didn't agree."


The more Malcolm thought about Reese's words and actions, the more he wondered about the secrets his spirited wife was keeping. The inability to uncover them only confirmed his suspicions that there was indeed something amiss. He never left things unfinished.


"Increase it to seven figures."


"Understood."


After exiting the car, Reese found a coffee shop, took out the first-aid antiseptics she had bought, and started applying them to her wounds. Some were so severe that even a light touch caused her agony, let alone applying medication.


Reese shivered in pain, especially when the sting of the antiseptic hit her open wounds yet, she clenched her teeth so tightly that she didn't make a sound.


Pain like this was something she had once been accustomed to; she even considered it a good thing,since it kept her sharply alert. Once she had taken care of her wounds, she stepped out of the coffee shop and received a call from Calvin.


Her voice was frigid as she slid to answer."What's up?"


"Reese, you called it - they raised the offer."


"What's the new figure?"


"Seven figures." Calvin could barely contain his delight. "Looks like your husband is still suspicious about who you are. Be careful, Reese."
###Chapter 94 Not One Bit Gentle


"Forget about it - let's just get the money first," Reese thought, still unsettled by the exchange with Malcolm in the car.


She didn't need anyone to change her situation, and she certainly didn't want someone patronizingly trying to comfort her.


In fact, she disliked the feeling of being transparent, of having others peer into her inner thoughts. It was like being stripped of her armor, laid bare for all to see.


Calvin chuckled with a hint of mischief, "So Reese,are you gonna take the job?"


"Transfer the cash to me, and I'll give him some intel.If the cash goes to someone else, he might as well be throwing it into the ocean,"The information they had was the result of Calvin and Louis spending two whole months covering their tracks. Although there were still some leads they needed to look into when they had the time,finding the holes was just a matter of time for someone as skilled as Malcolm.


Once a single vulnerability was found, everything else would unravel on its own.


Calvin was in the same boat as Reese;if Reese hadn't been holding out for a bigger score, Calvin would have jumped at the six-figure deal in a heartbeat. It was like getting money for nothing-who would refuse that?


But it seemed Reese was still one step ahead.


"Alright," Reese decided, "I'm in."


"Do it," Reese instructed, "Release what you can and  on the rest."


Calvin was at a loss now, "But what's okay to release?"


It seemed to Calvin that Reese was shrouded in secrets; divulging any one of Reese's varíous identities to Malcolm could be overwhelming. After all, the image Reese presented to the Flynns was night and day from the real deal.


Reese snapped back, clearly irritated, "Figure it out yourself. Do you really need to ask me that?"


Calvin could sense the tension in Reese's voice. It seemed like someone had lit her fuse.


"Reese, why are you so on edge? Menopause hit you early?"  Normally, their exchanges, while not exactly soft-spoken, weren't as explosive as they were today.


"If you spout any more nonsense," Reese threatened over the phone, "you'll have a very personal introduction to what an early menopause feels like."


"Goodbye, Reese." Calvin quickly hung up, not wanting to get burned.


Glancing at her phone's home screen, Reese chuckled."Well, at least you're quick to hang up."


But the person she was expecting hadn't shown up.What could be the reason?


Malcolm couldn't know she was investigating Jason,so it was unlikely he sent someone to test her. Trying another call, she found the number was already turned off.


Reese wondered if she had been played.


She should know better than to trust people online;she'd have to find other ways to dig deeper.


And Susan, she was bold to try to play her, but Malcolm had already instruicted Justin to handle it;otherwise, Reese surely would have made her regret ever crossing her path.


It turned into a wasted trip; all Reese could do that afternoon was head back to the office.As she stepped onto the front stairs, she encountered Justin.


After approaching her, Justin took Reese aside. "Reese, Mr. Flynn said you don't have to come in this afternoon. Go home and rest up," Justin offered with a considerate tone.


"No need, I'vé pretty much patched myself up; it won't interfere with work," Reese declined Justin's offer.


"Mr. Flynn said even if you're patched up, you should still take a rest. Besides, he's already approved your time off. Let me drive you home."


"Really, it's not necessary. I've got things to handle this afternoon. I'm heading in now, and you should get to it as well."


Before Justin could say more, Reese was already past him and on her way.


"So stubborn..."' Justin stood there, about to call out to her, but Reese had already entered the building. He shook his head, resigned to the fact that Reese was as bullheaded as they come.


Back at her desk, Reese got the reports Malcolm had requested in order, considering their earlier encounter;she felt reluctant about seeing him.


She caught Sophia passing by.


"Could you do me a favor and give these documents to Mr.Flynn?"


Sophia looked at her skeptically, perhaps fearing some sort of setup.


"Don't get the wrong idea, I twisted my ankle earlier,and it's hard to get around."


"Alright then." Sophia took the reports and knocked on Malcolm's office door.


"Come in."


With her head bowed, Sophia walked in and placed the documents on Malcolm's desk.


"Mr. Flynn, here are the documents you requested."


Malcolm took a moment to glance at them and then looked up.


"Where's Reese?"


"She said she twisted her ankle and couldn't walk comfortably, so she sent me."


Malcolm's deep and commanding voice made Sophiarush to explain, thinking he was on the verge of anger.


Malcolm frowned but soon his lips curled into a mocking smile. He had given her leave, but she didn't take it, and now she was claiming a twisted ankle?She had left briskly, slamming the car door,moving too smoothly for an injured person. It was clear she was avoiding him.


Well, he'd settle scores with her later.


"You can go now."


Sophia let out a sigh of relief, "Okay, Mr. Flynn, I'll leave you to it."


Reese spent the rest of the afternoon in her chair,surprisingly stationary. Thankfully, Sophia didn't come back to hassle her-not that Reese was worried, but after the tussle with those thugs earlier, her injuries
 were acting up, and it was still painful. It looked like she would have to swing by Dr. Robert's later for some of his bruise-healing remedies.


It would also help her dodge another encounter with Malcolm.


After a long workday, Reese called Dr. Robert, only to find out he had gone to a seminar that day.


These seminars were not much different from any professional gathering where there was always someone envious of another's success.


Reese remembered how Dr. Robert had once given her an effective medicine that helped Malcolm's leg heal quickly. She decided to swing by after work to support him.


Upon arrival, access to the venue required a pass,not just anyone could waltz in. Reese showed her med school ID to the security who couldn't hide his amazement.


"Miss, you're quite impressive. Only the brightest get into med school, many of whom will make significant contributions to the field."


Used to such praises, Reese was unfazed.


"May I go in now?"


The security snapped back to reality,′′Ofcourse,of course."


Reese walked in and spotted Robert. Heading straight to him, she greeted, "Dr. Robert."


Turning around to see Reese, a warm smile spread across Robert's wrinkled face.


"Reese, what brings you here?"


"I was hoping to get some medlicine from you,but your assistant said you had a seminar today. I thought I'd come by for support."


Hearing this, Robert beamed with pride.


"Your presence alone is an honor."


Reese's achievements and stature in the medical community far exceeded his own, and it was rare for her to attend such events. But for those she respected,she'd make the time without needing an invitation.


Dr. Robert had helped her when she was younger,and even though she had long since surpassed him professionally,she still held great respect for him.


"Dr. Robert, perform well, I'll be cheering for you."


"Great,with you here, I'll be confident. My grandson will join later; sit with him if you will."


Robert hadn't given up on the idea of them getting closer. Even if Reese wasn't particularly interested in his grandson, them building a friendship could be beneficial. Learning from Reese would be invaluable for him.


"Alright, don't worry, Dr. Robert," she said, ensuring today would go smoothly. Today was monumental for Dr. Robert, and though she wasn't keen on sitting with Remington, she wouldn't refuse, trying not to disappoint him on such a day.


As the seminar kicked off, journalists flooded in, joined by enthusiasts and veterans alike. Robert's seminars were a decennial event, integral to advancing medical science and developing drugs to improve public health.


For a physician, the helplessness in the face of a patient's agony was torturous.


When Remington arrived, forsome reason, his eyes instantly found Reese sitting in the second row.
Without even a complete view of her face, he spotted her in the crowd.


There was something about her, something different-her aura, her character, even her startlingly frank speech.


It was odd to find her here today. Dr. Robert must've summoned her. Otherwise, why would someone like her show up here? With his hands casually stuck in his pockets,
Remington sauntered over and took a seat beside Reese.
###Chapter 95 Ingrate


Reese snorted at the insinuation. She'd been to countless seminars, but she didn't feel like schooling a green kid on that.


Reese ignored Remington. She didn't even spare him a glance,which battered his ego. He reached out to touch her, saying, "Hey, I'm talking to you-do you not-ow,ow,ow!"


With a swift move, Reese grabbed his wrist just as his fingers nearly touched her and with a gentle twist, a sound of misalignment echoed. Her face, framed by cold and detached features, seemed even more aloof.


"I don't like being touched unwarrantedly."


Remington, sweating from the pain, hastily pled,"Alright, alright, I won't touch you-just let gó!" Once released, Remington rubbed his arm,looking at Reese with a mix of fear.


"Jeez, don't you have a gentle bone in your body? Do you treat your husband the same way,twisting his arm for no reason?"


Reese shot Remington a disdainful glance,"My husband isn't as bothersome and childish as you."


Remington scoffed, "Of course he isn't childish.His face is as cold as an iceberg-untouchable."


He knew of Malcolm's reputation as a ruthless businessman who left no roomn for his competitors.Seeing him in person, his reputation held true; an air of menace enveloped him, and his piercing gaze was sharp enough to make one's heart skip a beat with just a few glances. "Quiet, it's starting," Reese whispered as she watched Robert take the stage, microphone in hand.


"I'd like to extend my gratitude to my colleagues and the members of the press for attending my seminar. In recent years, our clinical case studies have saved the lives of many patients diagnosed with terminal diseases. If there are any questions, feel free to ask at any time."


Journalists clamored with inquiries, to which Robert responded with ease. But Reese had a hunch the event wouldn't go off without a hitch.


Even before Robert had considered retirement, there was one man who was his absolute nemesis.


At one time, they were close friends until they diverged over a significant medical discovery, Each held a strong opinion, leading to an inevitable split. Now, Charles; Robert's arch-rival, stood up.


"I'd like to ask-now that Dr. Robert has surpassed many of his medical predecessors-how do you respond to the patient fatality that resulted from your research back then?"


The room erupted into a frenzy once this question was voiced. Robert's face paled, and Reese's brows furrowed in worry; she knew Charles would dredge up the past medical incident to sabotage Dr. Robert's seminar.


Remington,seated nearby, couldn't remain silent and stood to defend his grandfather.


"That was an unforeseen accident, and it had nothing to do with my grandfather."


"Accident or not, that patient still died from the drug your grandfather researched."


Back then, the dispute was over whether a particular drug should be included in the treatment of a terminally ill patient. The patient's vital signs had been improving, but suddenly he suffered a fatal cardiac arrest. Although the hospital provided an explanation later on, Charles was adamant that Robert was to blame for the death.


The media's gaze was fixed on Robert, awvaiting his response.


Others might not have known, but Reese was well aware that the patient's death had always been Robert's greatest burden. Over the years, he continued to visit the patient's grave and pay his respects annually.


Now that Charles had brought this up, his intention was clear-to ruin Robert's seminar.


If there was one thing Reese couldn't stand,it was liars and those who frame others. She knew the full scope of Dr. Robert's contributions to the clinic,whereas Charles had done nothing - except attempt to pin his own failures on Robert.


Reese was clued into the original incident,unlike Robert, who could not engage with Charles without seeming defensive. But this was not the case for her.


Charles,seizing the opportunity of Robert'ssilence,pressed him further. "Come on, Robert, explain to everyone what really happened that year. Wasn't it your reckless prescription that led to the patient's fatal heart failure?"


Reese stood up, her presence commanding.“Why don't you mention that the patient had a heart condition and was explicitly advised against taking that medication? You knew that, yet you failed to speak up. Now, you're pushing all the blame onto Dr.Robert? That seems quite a stretch, doesn't it?"


All eyes turned to Reese, who had unexpectedly voiced her support for Robert. Most would have been flustered by such attention, but Reese stood firm, her gàze fierce.


Charles had left the hospital long ago and hadn't kept up with the goings-on, especially not someone like Reese. He was aware that Robert had taken on a new protégé-likely this young woman.


But how could she know about the incident? He thought he kept it well under wraps; the others in the hospital were oblivious. Either Robert had told her himself, or worse, stabbed him in the back.
Undaunted by turmoil, Charles scoffed,“Young lady,what's this got to do with you? Did he feed you some story about me and now you're here to hold court so he can reap the benefits unchallenged?"


Megan,beside Charles, chimed in condescendingly,"Who even are you? Looking all raggedy. I doubt you were even invited. How dare you interrupt your elders?”"


The crowd began to murmur and jest.


"Look at her, acting as his spokesperson. Since when do we listen to some girl when the man himself hasn't said a word?”


"Maybe she's a hired gun, just look at her clothes. She was probably paid to be here."


"She's not even from the medical community, yet she dares to speak on medical matters."


Reese was bombarded with taunts and jeers,but her composure remained unshaken - a testament to her character and resolve.


Remington was beside himself, trying to figure out what Reese's angle was. Despite the accusations thrown her way, her expression remained unaltered,but her eyes turned colder, emanating a chill that he could feel down his spine as he sat next to her.


He wanted to speak up for Reese; after all,she was standing up for his grandfather. But seeing herso composed, he decided to wait and see wvhat she had up her sleeve.


Though slight in frame, Reese's presence was undeniably commanding, especially her piercing gaze that made those around her feel uneasy. "Let's put aside whether I'm some paid supporter. I have a question for you. You were in charge of that patient back in the day, right? You and Dr. Robert were responsible. You were supposed to do the thorough check-up while Dr. Robert handled the surgery and medication. If you knew the patient had a heart condition, why didn't you inform Dr. Robert?You were aware of the medication he used, so surely,you knew some of those drugs are harmful to patients with heart problems?"


That incident had caused quite a stir, almost sending shockwaves through the entire medical community.It was only after the hospital negotiated with the family that things were downplayed. Yet, Robert still ended up with a tarnished reputation, which would have been far worse if not for that settlement.


Even so,Robert took the fall. He was thinking about Charles nearing retiremnent and didn't want to tarnish his future, Otherwise, Charles wouldn't even be able to step foot here.


Dr. Robert had preserved his reputation,and instead of showing gratitude, Charles had the audacity toturn the tables and play the victim. It was infuriating.


Charles's complexion was clearly changing. He figured Reese had no leverage, no connections, and with most of the people present being his allies, who would believe a word she said?


Robert wasn't one to argue over such matters,and even if Charles had to defend himself, he doubted Robert would be a match for him.


Emboldened by this thought, Charles regained his courage.

"Young lady, I don't know how much Robert paid you to spout this nonsense, but the incident back then was public knowledge. Now, he's revered in the medical community, and no one seems to recall the patient he killed. After all, the dead can't crawl out of their graves to defend themselves. That is why I must speak up."
###Chapter 96 Miss Brooks Arrives


Reese looked at Charles with disdain. Dr. Robert had been too kind-hearted,taking the fall to protect his honor,and now Charles was betraying him and attempting to shift the blame.


If she didn't speak out for Dr. Robert today, she would Yeel as if she were betraying the kindness he had shown her over the years.


"Maybe it's time you dug up those old case files and really looked into wvho messed up,huh?"

Charles hadn't expected this fiery young woman to be so tenacious. He decided to pull out the big guns.


"No one's going to listen to your nonsense here.Security! Get her out of here, pronto! The standards for this seminar have really dropped if just anyone ran stroll in."


Megan stood up and yelled toward the door, "Who let this troublemaker in? Get her out now!"


The security guards, clueless about the situation,only saw a young woman in her twenties arguing with a medical big shot. Obviously, they didn't want to get on Charles' bad side, who held the high ground in society.


Two guards quickly approached, reaching out to haul Reese away.


"Hold on, gentlemen," Remington hastily interjected."I'd advise you not to touch her if you don't fancy a hospital visit yourself."


But security wasn't about to take Remington's advice. "If she's causing trouble, she's got to go," one of them said decisively.


Remington sneered and took a few steps back.


"Hey, it's your funeral. Don't say I didn't warn you."


As the two guards reached for Reese, planning to escort her out, she hadn't even been touched when she used the table to propel herself into a roundhouse kick,sending them tumbling to the floor.


Megan had never imagined this seemingly unimpressive girl would be so skilled in combat; she simply couldn't stay, as she could jeopardize their plans.


She shouted at the rest of the security team, "This girl's here to cause mayhem! What are you waiting for? Throw her out already! The guards, too, were now convinced Reese was there to start trouble, especially since she had resorted to violence.


Remington had seen Reese in action before, noticing her fierce aura and absence of fear; he was confident she could handle these men. And if worst came to worst,he could still call Malcolm in time.


The guards circled around Reese, who stood amidst them, her piercing gaze fixed on Charles.


"So, the moment someone speaks the truth and hits a nerve, you can't wait to have security throw them out?" She challenged.


Charles's face reddened with anger


"That's slander, and I'm getting my lawyer!" "Fine by me. Let's not get physical-bring on the lawyers," Reese retorted, not in the mood to fight anymore. She was already nursing wwounds from a previous scuffle and didn't need fresh ones to explain to Malcolm.


At the thought of Malcolm, a realization struck Reese -why was she even thinking about him right now?


Megan quickly assessed the situation,realizing that even if all the security guards went at Reese together,it would be futile.


"In my opinion, we should call the cops. They're the only ones who can handle people who cause trouble like this."


Upon hearing the suggestion to involve the police,Remington felt a twinge of panic. Sure,Reese may have been in the right, but she had thrown punches, and there were several witnesses to that fact here. If they ended up at the police station, even if Reese had a solid case, the fact that she hit someone would be hard to justify. Complicating matters, Megan, Charles'daughter, had a boyfriend who apparently worked at the local police precinct. When it came down to it,they would likely support their own, leaving Reese out in the cold.


Remington knew he didn't want his grandfather,at his age, to get wrapped up in this mess. The only person who could save Reese now was Malcolm.


Quietly, he slipped his phone out of his pocket, found Malcolm's assistant's number, and dialed it.


When Justin received the call from Remington, he thought he'd misheard. After confirming the issue, he rushed to Malcolm's office. Malcolm was in the middle of a business negotiation when Justin barged in,causing immediate discomfort. The man frowned, a chill emanating from his gaze.


"Justin, have you forgotten the rules of this company?"


"It's not that, Mr. Flynn. I just got a call from Robert's grandson, Remington. Reese is in a fight again."


Yes, again. Reese had just brawled with some thugs at noon, and now she was at it a second time. What kind of woman had Mr. Flynn ended up marrying? While other men's wives were gentle and virtuous, constantly thinking about how to please their husbands,Mr.Flynn's wife was out there causing him trouble day after day.


If the other Flynns got wind of this, they would be furious.


Upon hearing Justin's news, Malcolm's grip on his pen tightened momentarily before his face turned grim. "Where is she?"


"At the M Hotel."


Malcolm got to his feet quickly, "Victor, I apologize,
but my wife is in trouble, and I need to go."


Victorwas still perplexed.


"But Mr. Flynn, our contract..."


"We'll sign it another day; I have to leave." Malcolm left Victor hanging and walked out with Justin.


What surprised Victor the most was that Mr. Flynn was supposed to be paralyzed, yet he had just stood up with ease, looking anything but handicapped. Were the rumors false? And when did MIalcolm get married? Why was there no news about it?


Meanwhile, Megan was on the verge of calling the police, when Charles stepped in, playing the good guy.


"Megan, it's Dr. Robert's seminar today, and there's a ton of media around. Let's not turn this into a spectacle. The poor girl was probably duped. Give her a chance. If she apologizes for what she said,we'll let it slide," Charles reasoned, his voice measured to avoid any unnecessary drama.


Megan instantly grasped the subtext. If the girl apologized, it would admit her accusations were false -casting doubt not only on her integrity but on Robert's as well. Who would idolize him then? Who would see him as a respected leader in the medical community? This was an opportunity for Megan to shoot two birds with one stone, and she wasn't about to let it pass.


Feigning magnanimity, she sighed, "Considering you might also be a victim, we'll go by my father's suggestion. In front of the media and everyone here,tell us how Dr. Robert orchestrated this frame-up against my father, and we won't hold it against you."


On stage, Robert almost fainted with frustration.His body swayed. Remington, quick to read the room,dashed to the stage to support him.


"Grandpa, are you okay?" He asked, concern in his voice.


Robert pointed through the crowd at Charles, barely choking out his words, his face ashen. "You...you're spouting nonsense. I thought our past friendship meant something when I chose not to expose your mistakes. And now, you dare to accuse me!"


Remington steadied Robert, fearing he might collapse with anger.


"Grandpa, don't argue with an ingrate. It's not worth it. Justice will prevail in the end and then we'll see who's right and who's wrong."


Reese usually didn't involve herself in these matters,but she was not about to stand aside when it came to Dr.Robert.


She challenged them confidently, "Alright,you want the truth? Everything I said is true. Charles, do you have the guts to accompany me back to the hospital to double-check that patient's record? It's all there,intact.Are you brave enough?"


To onlookers, Reese seemed at a disadvantage, but her gaze was sharp and her voice full of conviction.
leaving Charles breathless.


He couldn't possibly revisit the hospital to check the medical records with Reese; it would be like putting the blame back on himself.


No one there seemed to support this young girl.
Charles didn't believe for a second that someone so naive could cause this much trouble.


"If she refuses to tell the truth, let's have the owner throw her out and then contact a lawyer to sue her for slander."


Charles exchanged a knowing look with Megan.
Without hesitation, she pulled out her smartphone and called the establishment's owner, who happened to be one of her admirers, although she had never reciprocated his interest. Handling a troublesome girl like this would be a piece of cake.


In just a few minutes, Ethan showed up, his eyes brimming with adoration at the sight of Megan.


He approached her and asked, "What's going on,Megan? I heard someone caused a commotion and even got physical with our hotel's security?"


"It's that little punk over there. Get someone to kick her out, will you?" Megan pointed towards a girl not too far off with a smug look in her eyes.


She was curious to see what the youngster would do next. Sure, the kid might have some moves, but that didn't mean she could run amok.

So, what if Robert was a big shot in the medical field?He practically had one foot in the grave already. What could he possibly do to help this brat?


When Ethan's gaze followed Megan's pointing finger and landed on Reese's face, he was stopped dead in his tracks.


Well,this...
###Chapter 97 Honey, Come Here


A face asdelicate as an almond, no bigger than the size of a palm, with skin soft and smooth. A cool indifference was etched in her features, making her elegant appearance seem even more aloof and unfeeling.


Her eyes,however, with pupils clear and pure, ended in a slight upward tilt, casting an enchanting allure that was hard to resist. These contrasting traits were harmoniously integrated into her visage.


Even amidst a crowd,she stood out markedly, but for some reason, she seemed eerily familiar.


A moment later, Ethan almost let out a curse.


Isn't this Malcolm's new bride? Megan stepped forward and stood by Ethan's side,her presence loud and self-satisfied, as though eager to let everyone know of their acquaintance.


"Ethan, it's this woman," she said, her voice tinged with accusation. "She's spouting nonsense about my father.Get her out of here, now!"


Reese, in that moment, emanated a natural aura of commanding presence, especially narrowing her eyes slightly, signaling a dangerous vibe. With a bold,carefree curl of her lips, her words were reckless to the extreme.


"Let's see if he dares."


Unbeknownst to Reese, Ethan had already recognized her, yet even if he hadn't, Reese showed not a hint of fear. Her company had acquired this hotel last month;
Ethan was merely an employee here. How could he even think of expelling her?


Ethan shrank back a little. He truly didn1't dare.


Seeing Ethan rooted to the spot, Megan gave him a shove.


"Come on, call someone to get her out.



11I2,uh..."


"He doesn't have the guts."


Suddenly, a sharp and deep voice resonated from the entrance, drawing everyone's gaze in unison.


There, the man in the lead exuded a sense of superiority and disdain in every motion,an air of aristocratic elegance emanating from his very being.


Malcolm's arrival stirred the crowd once again.


"Isn't that the young Mr. Flynn?"


"How did he end up here? The man is a legend. At twenty, he took over the Flynn Group, forging a business legend in just two years."


"But wasn't it rumored that he was paralyzed from the waist down? That he can walk again only if a miracle happens? They said all the top doctors couldn't cure him."


"And now he's just suddenly better? Look at that stature, the golden ratio - like an emperor in his own right." "No idea, perhaps the miracle did happen."


As Reese stood there, Malcolm's appearance didn't bring her joy, but irritation at whoever had informed him of her whereabouts.


It was a medical conference where he shouIdn't have appeared, and seeing his prepared stance, it was clear he had come with a purpose in mind.


Malcolm's gaze shot straight through the crowd,landing firmly on Reese. He didn't even deign to glance at the other faces.


There she stood, alone, her slender frame seemingly frail, and yet she radiated a queen's aura, her eyes void of fear, exuding an air of fierce independence.

This was his wife, Malcolm's Reese. Even surrounded by a sea of people, she stood out - never one to be overshadowed. Pride flickered in Malcolm's eyes with a hint of possessiveness.


How blind could Ethan be, daring to cross the line with Malcolm's better half?


Megan caught sight of Malcolm; her eyes locked onto him as if magnetized, unable to look away.


The man was dressed simply in a white shirt and black trousers, his fabric clearly high-end, tailored to perfection, enhancing his distinguished presence.


She couldn't resist approaching, trying to catch his attention.


"Mr. Flynn, hello, I'm Megan."


Buat Malcolm's focus didn't waver in her direction, treating her as though she were invisible. Megan's smile began to falter. With everyone watching,she couldn't just walk away without losing face,so she stubbornly tried again.


"Mr. Flynn, I am-"


"Is it you who's been troubling my wife?" His gaze dropped down to Megan, a look of sovereignty and menace brewing in his eyes, drowning her in intimidation.


Megan's face turned stiff, her mouth opening with difficulty as she stammered, "Your... wife?"


Malcolm extended his arm, pointing towards Reese."The one you were just about to throw out, she's my wife."


Megan was thunderstruck, incredulous. Reese,
Malcolm's wife? Impossible!


Reese herself struggled to process this reveal; she had never imagined Malcolm would blow her cover in such a setting.


The disdainful looks from the crowd moments ago hadn't fazed her, but now their piercing gazes made her uncomfortable.


Ethan stepped up and took Megan's arm. "I was about to tell you, this Reese, she's actually Mr. Flynn's new bride."


Megan nearly lost her footing, teetering until Ethan quickly steadied her.


She shot Ethan a glance, "Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Who would've thought this unremarkable girl would be Malcolm's wife? Megan had really stumbled into a mess.


And what was Reese's relation to that old man,Robert?


But, with all eyes on her now, including the media's.and Malcolm's influence looming, Megan had no choice but to face the music. How else could she stand by her father's side in the future?


Megan took a deep breath, trying to muster her courage once more,but when she spoke, the steam seemed to go out of her sails.


"Just because you're Mrs. Flynn doesn't mean you can go around hitting people. Everybody knows the Flynns are strict with their upbringing and have such class. To think Mr. Flynn would marry someone so rude-I can't imagine who gave you the nerve to behave this way."


"It was me," the man admitted frankly.


"What?" Megan was caught off guard.


"My wife naturally has my support. Any other concerns?"


"You..." Megan was utterly taken aback by Malcolm's candid response. "Isn't this just indulging and spoiling her,aiding and abetting a tyrant?"


Malcolm lifted his eyelids coldly. "So what? If she desires, I'd give her the whole of Atlanta on a silver platter."


Megan's face turned a patchy mix of red and white with shock, but even more so, jealousy.Why did that wretched girl receive Malcolm's affection when all she wanted was for him to glance her way, something he couldn't be less bothered to do?


Reese,hearing Malcolm defend her time and again,felt as if someone was chiseling away at her tough exterior. She feared that one day she might actually be moved by him, that she might start to accept him.


She would have preferred if Malcolm had never shown up-as if she couldn't handle things on her own.


After living alone for the better part of twenty years,having a man suddenly enter her life, break her rules,and disrupt her rhythm, had caught her completely off guard. She wished her heart could be harder, that no matter what he did or said,she could remain indifferent. And then she remembered what he said in the car that day, how he promised to protect her for the rest of her life.


Such a heart-stirring promise, but how many people out there could truly deliver?


When Malcolm made his declaration, everyone in the room was stunned, bursting into whispers among themselves.


"If she wants it, I'll hand over Atlanta toher as well.Man, I'm green with envy."


"Mr. Flynn is so manly."


Suddenly, Malcolm beckoned Reese with a wave. His once icy gaze softened in a moment, and even his voice was filled with indulgence. "Honey, come here."
###Chapter 98 Watching PDA


At his call, all eyes converged on Reese.


Under his unabashed gaze, her heart skipped a beat,and a faint blush rose to her cheeks.


Remington, standing to the side, watched in awe.
What's with her, she's actually blushing?


She still had that innocent blush, but damn if Malcolm wasn't a charmer-model looks with a voice as rich and deep as velvet, probably too much for any woman to resist,


Reese might come off as tough as nails, but at her core,she was all girl, through and through.


Well, he'd taken notes, that's for sure. Flirting had to be done the Malcolm way.


With an audience watching, Reese couldn't let Malcolm lose face. The next moment, she made her way over to him.


Malcolm gently placed his hand on Reese's slight shoulder, his gaze shifting to Charles, who had started the commotion.


"Is it true you were about to cal the cops on my wife?"


Reese, puzzled, looked at Malcolm, "You know them?"


Malcolm's warm palm patted her shoulder reassuringly, "I didn't get the chance to tell you, the Bennetts are family friends with Grandpa Flynn. Mr.Bennett here even treated my leg once before."
Charles chuckled awkwardly,greeting Malcolm.


"Malcolm, your leg seems fine now. Did the medicine I gave you work?"


Malcolm's eyes went icy, his arm wrapping securely around Reese's shoulder.


"My recovery is all thanks to my wife. She sought out medicine from Mr. Robert, and that's what got me back on my feet."


Charles was utterly baffled. "Mr. Robert? Since when does he have a cure for your condition?"


After all, Charles had seen Malcolm's injury himself and even attempted a diagnosis-it wasn't something easily treated, let alone cured by some remedy Robert allegedly had. With all his time in med school, he had never seen a paralysis case resolved so effortlessly. Sure, Robert had skills, but fixing Malcolm? Highly doubtful.


Yet here Malcolm stood, defending them. Was that the play?


Reese spotted the vanity painted on Charles's face and couldn't squash her irritation, her voice laced with mockery.


"What's wrong? Jealous that your medical skills fell short and someone else's succeeded?"


Her words were a clear jab at Charles's medical prowess.


Megan,standing by and witnessing Malcolm's tenderness with Reese, felt a sting of bitterness,This girl, withouat a shred of reputation to her namé- laughable. Was she running some scam?


"So you claim you're Malcolm's wife? For all we know,you and that Robert could be conning us. Last I checked,Malcolm wasn't married."


Remington steadied Robert as he took a seat, trying not to chuckle at Megan's relentless questioning."Would Reese be Malcolm's treasure if she wasn't his wife?"


Megan grew more daring with Reese's silence: "Maybe you're just using the Flynn name to dodge disaster.You claim you're Malcolm's wife-prove it, then."


She couldn't believe that MIalcolm, with all his merits,would settle for such an ordinary girl-lacking both background and grace. How could the Flynns ever accept her? Malcolm remained quiet, not because he couldn't intervene, but because it wasn't his place.Reese,with her fiery spirit, wouldn't let Megan get away with this.It was time for her to show her true colors,and he didn't need to join the fray.


Reese could see Megan's jealousy written all over her face-clearly,she had feelings for Malcolm. But if she and her father insisted on giving Grandpa Robert a hard time and upsetting them, they couldn't blame her for what came next.


Raising an eyebrow, Reese said, "I migt not meet your other standards, but this-I can do.Watch closely."


In the next second, Reese tiptoed, wrapped her arms around his neck, and Malcolm humored her by leaning down slightly, a spark of amusement in his eyes, as their lips met. Whispers of awe rippled through the crowd.


"My god, kissing right here? Crazy!"


"Such a beautiful moment-somebody take a picture!"


"Reese is so cool; I love her attitude."


By the time the onlookers regained their composure,Reese had already let go of Malcolm, whose eyes were full of laughter. He affectionately ruffled her hair,displaying their affection in full force.


Megan stumbled back in disbelief. "Impossible! How could you marry her, Malcolm? She doesn't deserve you!"


Malcolm looked stern, his eyes piercing. "Whether she's worthy isn't for you to decide. And stop calling me Malcolm; we're not close."


He'd be thrilled if Reese called him that affectionately but coming from another woman, it just made him sick.


Humiliated in front of everyone, Megan lost all face.Charles,seeing the situation slip beyond repair,nudged her.


"Let's get out of here before we embarrass ourselves further."


Megan's mind was still a blur as Charles pulled her towards the exit. They hadn't even reached the door when Reese's voice rang out, icy and firm.


"Think you can just waltz out after ruining Grandpa Robert's conference? Not on my watch." Reese wasn't one to be trifled with; there was no way she'd let them leave without consequence. That just wasn't her style.


Charles paled, turning to face Reese. Despite being just an ordinary girl, she exuded a potent presence. Her gaze, deep and clear, yet icy and aloof, bore down on him as if he were less than a bug.


"How dare you intimidate me?" Charles retorted,defying the fright that crept up his spine. "I haven't even pressed charges for your slanderous rant. Do you think you can just tarnish my reputation because you're a Flynn?"


Reese narrowed her eyes, filled with disdain.


"I don't need the Flynn family's influence to ruin you.I have evidence of your misconduct from years ago.Care for me to share it with the press right now?"
###Chapter 99 I'm Malcolm's Wife


Charles stood frozen; his world rocked as if by a thunderclap, nearly toppling from the shock.


How could this young woman possess such evidence?It wasn't possible. If she did, then what about Robert...In front of so many witnesses, an admission from him would be tantamount to confessing his own slander against Robert. His reputation in the medical field would be shattered. Once respected, he'd become the target of all his past adversaries. He couldn't allow that.


He feigned composure, yet his fists clenched tight.


"If you're so confident, then show me the evidence,"Charles challenged with false bravado.


A chilling smile played on Reese's lips as she looked down on Charles, who was still in denial of his impending doom.


She might have spared him if only he had apologized to Grandpa Robert, but since he refused to see the writing on the wall, she wouldn't hold back now.

Just as Reese was about to retrieve the file from her phone, Robert approached, supported by his aide.


"Reese, let them go," Robert said gently.


Remington was startled. "Grandpa, we can't just let them off the hook. This mess is all because he disrupted your conference,"


People like Charles deserved to be exposed to the public's scorn. They choose death over an easy life,and this time, Remington firmly took Reese's side. Robert's face was pale, and even speaking seemed a struggle. Reese knew Grandpa Robert had a history of Jung problems, and any emotional outbursts or agitations could easily leave him gasping for afr.


He approached Charles, his face a mask of kindness with no trace of bitterness. "Charlie, out of respect for our past as partners, I'll save you the embarrassment this time. But if there's a next time, don't expect me to be merciful."


Years had passed, and he couldn't place all the blame on Charles; he had his own share of responsibility. If he had been more careful, double-checked everything.clarified the patient's records, perhaps the tragedy wouldn't have occurred. That's why he chose to forgive Charles today.


Charles hadn't anaticipated that Robert knew everything about that fateful error, which ultimately led to a patient's death. Robert had never mentioned a word about it.


He had assumed ignorance, but Robert understood the situation better than anyone. Suddenly,Charles felt ashamed of his own baseless suspicions and couldn't bear to face Robert.


Megan, watching the silent Charles, called out, "Dad..."


"Let's go," he replied.


"But... just like that? What about them?" The recent confrontation with Reese still stung Megan.She was not ready to let it go.


In her eyes, apart from Reese's good looks, shehad nothing valuable to offer. Only she herself was worthy of Malcolm. "Let's go. Staying here will only make things worse."Charles said, his earlier dominance withering away as he led a dejected Megan away from the scene.


The commotion settled down, and the media's attention shifted from Charles and Robert to Reese and Malcolm.


Flashbulbs turned their way, and microphones were thrust forward. "Mr. Flynn, when did you get married.and who is this lady? What's her connection to Mr.Robert?"


"What about your leg, Mr. Flynn? Who helped you recover?"


"And who is this lady, such a fortune to marry Mr.Flynn?"


Questions bombarded Malcolm and Reese, making her despise the nosy reporters more every minute.


Reese's expression was cold, and she gave no answer,ignoring the barrage of inquiries.


She tossed a miffed glance sideways and gave Malcolm a playful twist.


"Who invited you? I'd like to give them a piece of my mind."


Malcolm's slitted eyes followed a gaze not far off,finally resting on Remington, who seemed clueless as to what was going down but could feel Malcolm's eyes boring into him, a hint of amusement flickering at the edges.


What was going on? Before he could process the situation, he caught
Reese's stare fixed on him too-her gaze piercing and intimidating, chilling him to the bone.


He ran through his recent actions in his mind but couldn't pinpoint anything that might've ticked off Reese. So why look at him with such intensity?


Remington had the feeling that he was on someone's radar and that it wasn't good.


He nudged his Grandfather Robert, "Grandpa, let's get out of here."


"But Reese, she..."


"Reese will be fine with Mr. Flynn around, nothing will go awry. Plus, do you really think she's someone who can be easily pushed around?" Wasn't it usually Reese doing the pushing?


Already winded, Robert felt the toll of the night's drama on his aging body, now struggling even to draw breath.


His medication, left at home, compounded his discomfort, but seeing Malcolm's protective stance over Reese gave him some reassurance.


"Okay, let's go."


Relief washed over Remington. He dreaded his grandfather insisting on staying for Reese's sake. Just her intense gaze alone made him feel extremely uncomfortable.


Reese watched as Remington beat a hasty retreat,realizing perhaps he knew where he stood. He may dodge the bullet today, but there was no escapíng the inevitable.


Badgered by incessant questions from reporters, she finally grabbed a microphone from one.


"Stop guessing about my identity. I'm Reese, no connections, not born with a silver spoon - just an ordinary person. As for Malcolm's miraculous recovery? Well, marrying me brought a stroke of good fortune. That's all there is to it."


Without another word, she thrust the microphone back into Malcolm's arms.


"I'll leave you to handle this."


"Reese..." Malcolm's response trailed as Reese breezed through the crowd and exited the venue. He watched her determined departure, a small smile curling his lips. Holding the microphone, he addressed the eager media.


"I don't care what her past was. All you need to know is that she's now my wife, Malcolm's wife, and that's enough," he declared with unwavering conviction,staring down at the assembled press. "I expect no negative coverage about her. Cross that line, and your careers are at stake."
###Chapter 100 No One Needs to Stand Up for Me
Malcolm's voice had an undeniable presence,commanding the room and quelling the murmurs of the journalists. No one dared to mess with the big story when the Flynn family's eldest son laid down the law.


"Stick around to handle things, Justin," Malcolm ordered his assistant without even a glance in his direction.


"But Mr.Flynn-"Justin protested,hesitantly.


"Cut the chatter. Any more delays and I'll miss catching up with my wife," Malcolm said sharply, and with that, he strode out, his long legs carrying him swiftly past the parting crowd of reporters. Stepping outside, Reese unexpectedly stumbled upon a disgruntled Megan,who was griping to Charles.


"How can Malcolm be with such a woman? She's as warm as an ice block and tough as nails. Look at her face,stern like someone owes her money. Has the Flynn family lowered its standards so much?" Megan lamented indignantly.


"People like you wouldn't make it past the doorstep,"came Charles' blunt retort.


Meanwhile, from a short distance away, a cool yet compelling voice chimed in, stopping Megan cold.


She felt an inexplicable fear wash over her, the origins of which even she couldn't grasp. As she turned,there stood Reese, already close. Towering and commanding,Reese's presence alone overwhelmed Megan. Megan, without thinking, stepped back, her pride wounded yet compelling her to stand her ground against Reese.


"Just because you're married to Malcolm doesn't mean you can lord it over everyone with the Flynn famnily's power. What goes around comes around, and one day,Malcolm will move on from you," Megan challenged resentfully.


Reese raised an elegantly arched eyebrow, her gaze laced with mockery.


"Oh? Are you implying that once he's done with me,he'll marry you?" Reese countered coolly. "Let me clarify something. I don't need the Flynn name to outclass you in every way,"


Megan, defiant,chin held high, scoffed."What makes you think you're so special?"


"It's simple. My husband loves me. That something you can compete with? Besides, I'd advise you to save your words, if only to cling to a shred of dignity,"Reese responded,her voice calm yet filled with a commanding chill.


Megan was left speechless, unable to fathom Reese's confidence which seemed to know no bounds. Her face a palette of conflicting emotions, Megan's hand,poised to point at Reese,faltered under the sharp edge of Reese's piercing gaze, and she withdrew it hastily.


"Just wait, I'll get you for this," Megan hissed, fully aware she was no match for Reese, be it in a war of words or a physical confrontation. She was outgunned in every way by this girl standing before her.


Try as she might, Megan couldn't grasp where Reese's natural dominance came from. Although they appeared to be about the same age, Reese exuded an air of authority that seemed without reason or explanation.


Charles was taken aback by Reese's fearlessness-the nerve she had in the face of such a media circus and the flurry of debate.


An ordinary person would have been scared witless,complexion drained of color, unstable under pressure,but Reese remained bright-eyed with unwavering determination. Even Charles found her aura overwhelming. She was surprisingly well-versed in past events, almost like someone with inside knowledge.


Unable to help himself, Charles blurted out a question."What exactly is your relationship with Robert, and who are you,really?" Reese shot him a cold glance, "You're not worthy of that information:"


The very idea that someone like Charles, so pitifuland low,would be privy to her identity was absurd.


Fuming inside, Megan challenged Reese, "Howw dare you speak to my father like that! I'll teach you a Yesson!"


With a raised hand, Megan aimed a slap at Reese's face.


"Megan!" Charles tried to intervene, but it was too late.


In the moment Megan's hand descended,a
bloodthirsty calm flashed in Reese's eyes. She seized Megan's wrist and counter-attacked with a swift,
decisive slap. The sound of it echoed around them. Megan was stunned, feeling a sharp pain on her cheek, and as she came to her senses, her eyes glaring at Reese, she screamed, "You little monster, how dare you hit me!"


Megan moved to strike back, but Reese's lips curled into a chill smile as she prepared to put Megan in her place. Suddenly, a strong grip on her shoulder yanked her back, and she found herself steadied against a warm embrace.


Looking up, Reese met the handsome features of Malcolm and gasped in surprise, "How did you get here?"


With tenderness overflowing in his eyes, Malcolm pinched her soft cheek, "Leaving your husband alone back there, you little troublemaker. You'll get it when we're home." It was a line that should've been of annoyance,but coming from Malcolm, it sounded almost like playful banter between lovers. Megan, on the other side,felt her face- and heart-ache with a different pain.


Pointing at Reese furiously, Megan addressed MMalcolm,
"Look closely, Malcolm. This woman is two-faced,bullish, and insolent. You didn't see her talking back to my father. How can a woman with no manners be
worthy of you?"


There was an eerie gleam in the man's eyes that grew more pronounced by the moment, his brows furrowed in a silent display of displeasure.


"When it comes to Reese, I, Malcolm, have the final say. What gives you the right to come here and poke your nose into our business?" he demanded.


"But she hit someone! If you're with her and she goes

Megan, cradling her burning cheek, was on the verge of tears, shaking with fury.


"Nonsense. My wife is the gentlest and most virtuous woman at home. She's never lifted a finger before.
That just proves how out of line you were to make her resort to violence," he retorted with conviction.


"You're both..." Megan neary gagged with the revulsion she felt towards them.


What spell had this girl cast on Malcolm that he was going to such lengths to protect her?


Megan had always thought, with his cool, aloof demeanor, he wouldn't easily fall for a woman.
Especially since there hadn't been anyone else by his side all these years, she felt she still had a chance.
Who would have guessed he'd end up marrying Reese,a woman without any manners to speak of, and now he was even backing her up against Megan herself.


Malcolm had no time to waste bantering with someone who didn't matter.


"My wife, Reese, can slap you if she wants. Even if she slaps you again, I'd still indulge her. So, do yourself a favor and stay out of her way. You can't handle the consequences," he said coldly.


Then, wrapping an arm around Reese, the harshness vanished from his face, his voice turning soft and gentle.


"Let's go home."


Reese didn't resist this time, simply nodding her head in agreement. Megan watched them leave, her fists clenched. She wasn't going to let this go; she wouldn't just hand Malcolm over to Reese. That slap would be returned,sooner or later.


Out of Megan's sight, Reese shivered slightly,and Malcolm's hand slipped away.


She stopped, regaining her standoffish composure.


"From now on, I'd appreciate it if you kept out of my affairs. I don't need anyone fighting my battles for me."


With those words, a chill settled between them.
